1355094,10666188,2014-03-02,11760898,Evan,Great place to stay in the best neighborhood in Seattle. 
1355094,11383982,2014-03-31,3721677,Alyssa,Staying with Michael and his roomies in Seattle was great! The apartment was in a perfect location in capitol hill and everyone was so friendly and fun to hang out with for the little time I wasn't out seeing the city. 
1355094,11782521,2014-04-14,2796726,Christina,"Michael and his roommates are simply wonderful. They greeted me with warmth and smiles, gave me tips for traveling around the city, and provided everything that I needed to make my stay safe and comfortable. The house itself is situated in a stellar location, right in the heart of Capitol Hill. The bus line is a three minute walk from the house but I was able to walk to Pike's Place in less than twenty minutes. I also walked to lots of bookstores, coffee shops and restaurants - all within a ten minute walk from the house. There is even a grocery store and library within a block or two if you need to pick up some literary content or essentials. I would highly recommend staying here to any of my friends who are traveling and hope to stay again the next time I'm in town. "
1355094,12253267,2014-04-27,13976392,Pat,"I stayed at Michaels for a few weeks after moving to Seattle, it's a fun place to stay! The location is amazing and the people living there are really friendly. "
1355094,13615202,2014-06-01,13365058,Caitlin,"It's hard to imagine a warmer character than the one and only Michael. I know it's cliche to say so but I genuinely felt like I had known him forever as soon as we met. He will make you laugh and he listens with wide-eyed interest, and if you listen back, you'll probably learn a lot of things you didn't know. His enthusiasm for life is entirely contagious. The other housemates were great, too, laid back, interesting, welcoming and accommodating. 

The house is truly in the heart of Capitol Hill and you can find almost anything you want (groceries, restaurants, nightlife, clothing stores, banks) within easy walking distance. In addition, the house is situated on a fairly low traffic street so there's no worry about waking up to honking, etc. If you will need parking, I would suggest checking with Michael first. Normally it's not a problem; it's just that there are many ongoing construction projects in CH these days which sometimes makes parking a creative exercise. 

Overall, I had a fantastic experience here. I met some awesome people while getting a feel for the pulse of this beautiful city. Thanks, MT! Hope to see you soon!"
1355094,14176640,2014-06-13,16666750,James,Super cool host! Warm and inviting. Wish I had more time to hang out. I was able to walk to some great places to eat then walk to market place. 
1355094,14611779,2014-06-23,14521283,Pilar,"GREAT location and people! I wish I had more time to actually hang out with them.  The location is absolutely perfect- it's a couple of blocks from everything. So, you can walk to ev-e-ry-thing but have a cool place to just chill and relax afterwards.  The bus stop with the lines that take you to the cool areas (Pike Place, etc.) is also just down the block.  You really don't need a car if you stay here.  Just about everything worth checking out in Seattle is within walking distance or a bus ride (mayyybe two) away.  Bonus that the hosts are super chill.  Michael really does offer scooter rides!"
1355094,14891982,2014-06-28,17131356,Carlos,This was my first time utilizing this application and it was an excellent experience. Everyone in the house was exceptionally friendly and laid back. They immediately made me feel welcome and relaxed. I'm hoping to stay with them again when I come back.
1355094,15214009,2014-07-05,3553782,Rachel,"This is a wonderful house and great airbnb stay: can't beat the location, friendly and welcoming hosts, and a comfortable bed!! Would absolutely recommend this place and would gladly stay again. Thanks for having me!!"
1355094,15534730,2014-07-11,3114291,Elena,"This was an ideal please to stay during my 3-day Seattle adventure. It's the perfect location, comfy bed, and despite the bustling house it was quiet at night and I slept well. It was easy to check in and out at times that suited my travel schedule, and I got some great ideas of places to check out nearby—I wouldn't have discovered Volunteer Park on my own! Wish I'd been able to stay longer :)"
1355094,15712208,2014-07-14,4924058,George,"My stay at Michael's & Leah's place was 100% positive and as advertised! Cool people, too! Everyone was super friendly and welcoming; they even hand-wrote instructions for me on how to get to Safeco Field for a Mariners game. The place was clean and cozy. The neighborhood was exactly what I was looking for - close to shops, bars, and restaurants, within a mile or so from downtown, very walkable. I definitely recommend staying here!"
1355094,15926493,2014-07-18,13710425,Sunthavy,"My stay in Seattle was very short but it was awesome! The room and the apartment are really great, all the roommates and other guests are very friendly, and make you feel at home! Plus, its very well located (i actually did everything by walking), and the neighborhood is lovely. Truly recommended ++"
1355094,22628570,2014-11-10,2545889,Jennifer,Cozy room in Capital Hill. It was perfect for my short stay in Seattle. It's a great location within walking distance to several delicious restaurants. Communication with Leah was efficient and simple. I would stay here again.
1355094,23128647,2014-11-23,2811723,Eliot,"Amazing location perfectly situated in Capitol Hill. While I was only able to stay for 1 day, I felt completely at home and welcome."
1355094,23197617,2014-11-24,2408406,Josh,"Nice hosts, easy check-in, great room in a great location."
1355094,24393131,2014-12-27,25033523,Steve,"My initial expression was very welcoming. Leah (the host during my stay) was flexible with my late arrival and very helpful providing directions from the Airport. 

Would definitely recommend this place to other visitors in Seattle. "
1355094,24570393,2014-12-30,21175736,Lisa,"Room was precisely as advertised, and Leah was very helpful with instructions about check-in, check-out. I didn't get to see too much of my host, but it was a comfortable stay. Great location. "
1355094,24767204,2015-01-02,23919280,Christian,"Leah was the host for the 2 nights we spent there. The room was perfect for what we needed, which was really just somewhere to sleep at night. The location of the neighborhood is excellent as it is close to a bunch of shopping and restaurants nearby (5 min walk). The only thing that could be fixed is really the water pressure of the shower as others had mentioned, but otherwise everything is fine."
1355094,24980251,2015-01-04,25098023,Anna,"Thanks! The room was in a great location, clean and simple. The host was organized and easy to reach. I had a great trip."
1355094,25215085,2015-01-09,4055211,Brittany,"This was a good place to stay for the price. It was clean enough for me, and checking in and out was easy. As everyone has said, the shower is more of a mist than a normal shower so be prepared. That being said it worked well enough for my thick hair, it was more of the rinsing off your body that was the challenge. I ran into an issue with them only having one bathroom when someone was in it for an hour and I was trying to shower before I left and caught my flight but other than that I was able to get in when I needed to. Didn't even meet the people that lived there but enjoyed hanging out with the other guests! Great location in Capitol Hill - close to Broadway and pine/pike where there's a lot going on! All in all I would stay here again if I was coming to Seattle on a budget. "
1355094,25393089,2015-01-14,1336344,Kaitlyn,"I had a wonderful and very easy stay at Leah's in Capital Hill. Leah was very easy to communicate with and was flexible with my schedule. The room and house was clean and fit the description very nicely. The location was excellent for exploring many of the fun neighborhoods in Seattle. The place is super close to markets, great coffee shops, bookstores, etc. I would definitely come back again!"
1355094,25661077,2015-01-22,10912871,G,"Pro: welcoming, tidy, and well-run household; within walking distance of anything and everything worth visiting in the neighborhood; super-affordable.

Contra: I stayed a week and did not encounter any stand-out issues that could offset all the reasons you'd want to stay here.

You're seeing lots of positive reviews for a reason - if you're looking for a cozy hideout in the heart of Capitol Hill with gracious and affable hosts, this is your place."
1355094,26370592,2015-02-10,18106476,James,"No complaints. Room was clean, comfortable, and well suited for a longer stay than I made. Check in and check out were a breeze. "
1355094,26716835,2015-02-17,8795337,Zack,"The experience here was great. Keys are made available without a physical exchange for convenience, and the host was very communicative and quick to respond.

The bedroom is a no-frills, basic room with some extra blankets and some towels. There was plenty of closet space and wiggle room to comfortably host my girlfriend and I.

The house was very quiet when we were there and that was splendid.

The kitchen had some free tea, coffee, and snacks. Nice touch!

The only negative I can mention is that there are a few unpleasant smells around the house. You can tell young people live here and deep cleaning is not their specialty. If you've got a really sensitive nose and are a clean freak, this place might not be right for you.

All in all, great host and great place for the price."
1355094,27064325,2015-02-24,6642803,Thomas,"This last-minute booking was great! Leah quickly -approved my booking and was great at communicating when the room would be ready. The room was basic, but in a great location. Met another roommate, Austin, who was very nice and made us feel at home. I would definitely reccommend this place to a friend looking for a place to crash over the weekend."
1355094,27310271,2015-03-01,9794526,Melina,"The host was very communicative via emails, and very helpful to let us book last minute. We appreciated the ease of access and getting to come earlier than the posted check-in time, very helpful for us since we were tired from traveling. Either way, the host offered to provide access to drop off our luggage-that's nice. The space was not exactly as photographed. It is the same room, but decor has changed since the photos and looks less ""fresh and modern"" and more ""obscure and moody artist's bedroom."" The apartment overlooks a beautiful street. This is a space with more of a ""roommates"" vibe than a home vibe, just fyi for future guests. We got to meet one of the roommates, but not the person with whom all the communications took place (as was communicated with me as a possibility via an email upon booking). Great location in the city overall and definitely a budget-friendly option! Thank you!!"
1355094,27714892,2015-03-10,12654181,Karen,"I had a great stay at Michael's. Everything was exactly as described and pictured. The location could not have been better. It was a quick walk to the bus downtown, coffee shops and restaurants. 
I was welcomed with custom instructions. There was always fruit and snacks on the counter to share. 
I would absolutely stay here again!"
1355094,28089598,2015-03-17,11258178,Gill,"I had a great time staying with Michael, Leah, and Austin. The space was exactly as described and in an amazing location. They were very welcoming and had food in the kitchen for guests. They even left some chocolate on the night table!

I would stay here again. Everything was perfect, I didn't have to meet them to get the key which was nice and they let me store my bags in their living room on my checkout day. 

They made everything easy!"
1355094,28419961,2015-03-23,1659986,Matthew,"Neighbourhood was excellent, prime location, my late check-in was well organised with Leah. The only feedback was the bed, the slats supporting the mattress had come loose or collapsed so half of the bed was dipped and uncomfortable but should be an easy fix. Sadly i didnt get to see or meet any of the roommates."
1355094,28944098,2015-04-01,1130091,Vitaly,"Nice house, big shared living room, clean kitchen, was easy to walk and cab from it to downtown area and all the necessary things.
"
1355094,29282612,2015-04-06,5792592,Andersen,The host was kind and provided us with a little welcome gift. The neighborhood they are in is very convenient. House accommodations are good and the living situation is pretty cozy.
1355094,30465735,2015-04-22,16620306,Evelyn,"The room and house were clean, comfortable, and accessible. Really nice neighborhood and I was happy to have the flexibiity to leave my bags stored for a few hours the day I was leaving. Thanks for a great stay!"
1355094,30808093,2015-04-27,19205189,Naomi,"Leah was a great host! We didn't see much of each other because I was out all day, but she was really kind and considerate or anything I might need. Very thorough also with making sure I had all the information I'd need to get to there place and also leave. Their house is also in a lovely location. Really recommended for anyone looking to spend time in Seattle!"
1355094,31075140,2015-05-01,18495169,Kath,"The room was as described - this is a sharehouse, so that's how the vibe is. I didn't see much of the hosts, but Leah was helpful with good local places for coffee, food, very chilled. The house is in a great spot for Capitol Hill. 15th Av is less than 10 mins walk and you're then in amongst many good watering holes, boutiques and foodie places. Great to stay somewhere local! And not in amongst a million tourists."
1355094,31490933,2015-05-05,30861793,Meghan,Perfect location to explore the city even if you travel without car. It is a sharehouse.
1355094,31832897,2015-05-10,24728445,Beverly,"We didn't get to meet Michael, but Leah his roommate was just lovely! We were there with other airbnb guests which was no problem. Considering the circumstances of how many people there were, the bathroom and other common areas, such as kitchen and living room were pretty clean. Also our room was freshly made and we had all we need. If you like a lively place I would highly recommend staying here. Also the neighborhood is really nice and relatively close to downtown. We walked everything. Seattle is definitely a place worth visiting!"
1355094,32276428,2015-05-16,17614561,Julie,"Leah was a very lovely host, and the room and the house very nice and tidy. Awesome location to discover Seattle over a few days, walking distance from the CBD, and nice cafes and restaurants a few blocks away. I highly recommend this place for anyone travelling to Seattle!"
1355094,33302634,2015-05-26,8258990,Kelly,"Accurate description. Nice place and neighborhood. Didn't see the host all weekend, but that is OK. Everything was still accessible. There were a fair amount of bathroom rules, but it wasn't a problem. Overall good experience."
1355094,34436955,2015-06-08,9408469,Hans,This was a good place to stay.  Very close to downtown Seattle with a QFC grocery store and coffee shops nearby.  The room I stayed in is small but good enough for one person and probably two.  My room was clean and the bathroom was pretty clean as well.  These hosts have done this plenty before and have the process down.
1355094,34892455,2015-06-13,34326101,Jingming,"Very good.  The host was very friendly and the place was clean and quite.  The location was also convenient, with several grocery markets and restaurant within a short walk."
1355094,36060201,2015-06-24,3480268,Tuomas,"Very good experience. These guys are really pro; communication and coordination were top-notch. There were ""user instructions"" all over the place and they even had labeled stuff for visitor's convenience. Nice and quiet residential location."
1355094,36812121,2015-07-01,29192766,Jacob,"Great host and great stay. Place was clean, stocked, and in a great part of town! Very convenient. "
1355094,38860871,2015-07-19,33863494,Sarah,"This listing is exactly as described. It is located in a great area, and the hosts are all very friendly!"
1355094,39795354,2015-07-26,35996530,Lizzy And Peter,"We highly recommend staying at the Capitol Hill Excursion. Our room was very clean, the bed was big and comfy and we had lots of space to store our luggage. Our room had a useful binder full of the host's recommended places to check out during your stay.
Leah was a very friendly and helpful host. The kitchen and bathroom were both clean and spacious. We had coffee, basic breakfast food and extra toiletries made available to us.
The house was fairly quiet but we did briefly run into other travelers. The house also features a large common room for guests to hang out.
I highly recommend staying in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. Great food and bars! We really enjoyed Jai Thai (which is just around the corner from the house) for a late night meal. 

"
1355094,42702831,2015-08-15,7834382,Brian,"My wife and I stayed here for four nights. Overall, it felt like a well run hostel. We had our own room which was small but adequate since we spent most of our time exploring the city. We did also take advantage of the shared food instead of buying breakfast a few mornings. The only very small issue we ran into was the one communal bathroom. Occasionally we did have a short wait. Otherwise, everything was very smooth, clean, and well run. We would stay here again in the future. It was a good price for what we got!"
1355094,43998700,2015-08-23,37774041,David,"Michael's roommate, Leah, was very communicative from check-in through check-out.  Although I never met Leah or Michael face-to-face, the clarity of information they provided -- both electronic and via an in-room binder -- helped my girlfriend and I feel welcome in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle.  We'd definitely stay here again if we're in the Seattle area!"
1355094,44663325,2015-08-28,4934845,Sarah,"We had a lovely time here. This place was set up to be hostel-like, but with the coziness of a home. We didn't get the pleasure of meeting Leah but she was incredibly helpful and provided us with all of the amenities (and more!). Would definitely come back. "
1355094,45570122,2015-09-04,1175820,Filip,"Both the room and the house were clean and had a really pleasant vibe to it, it felt like a home away from home. It's in a good location, in an area full of bars and restaurants, but still relatively close to downtown. Since Michael was out of town when we came, Michael's roommate Leah greeted us and was very helpful about anything we needed. Thumbs up for this listing!"
1355094,46984203,2015-09-14,43432095,Mengqi,"I have to say it's really a nice place to stay. The room is big enough for a single person, extra clean not only the room but also the restroom and kitchen, you can find thoughtful notes everywhere in the house. Very quite in the night. There's free street parking. It's located at downtown area, 10 mins drive to space needle. If there's another chance I could visit Seattle I'm sure will choice this house again, and also will recommend to my friends."
1355094,48339733,2015-09-25,24984140,Jonathan,"Michael and Leah's place was absolutely perfect.  Great location, great room, great price.  Would highly recommend and would stay again."
1355094,49692817,2015-10-05,6454177,Leiszle,"Similar to what other folks have said, this was a great place to stay! Comfortable, quiet, private, and in close proximity to a lot of the fun Seattle has to offer. I actually used to live in this very neighborhood, so I might be a little biased, but everything about the place felt great. 

As advertised, there is one bathroom, which was a little tough once or twice, but generally worked out fine. I'd compare it to a very homey and accommodating hostel (in the best possible sense of the word). Wifi was fast, too! Overall, highly recommended."
1355094,49957438,2015-10-07,3106898,Matteo,"Great stay only for one night.
Didn't spend much time at Michael place but room was very comfortable and quite."
1355094,50500068,2015-10-12,42033334,Patrick,Michael and Leah were such great hosts and their place was everything we wanted/needed for our trip. So many little amenities in every room all for guests to use. The room itself housed both of us comfortably and was very clean and quiet. The apartments location was unbeatable. The charm and character of Capitol Hill was perfect and all within a 20ish minute walk to downtown. I HIGHLY recommend this place and will gladly stay again on my next visit. Thanks guys! 
1355094,51501091,2015-10-20,46312796,Di,"Michael and Leah are very nice. The bedroom is not very big one, but totally enough for me and my friend.  Everything is convenient and comfortable.  There are a lot of notes for guests everywhere, and even a handbook in the room.  The location near downtown is perfect, which has the view of Space Needle far away."
1355094,51820179,2015-10-24,8772997,Garmon,"The room was in a great area, we walked to everything we needed. The house was clean and tidy, and host was helpful and friendly. Would recommend to young travellers like ourselves. "
1355094,53142076,2015-11-05,25865770,Douglas,"Very nice location, communication excellent, a great place to explore Seattle."
1355094,53299616,2015-11-07,44537732,Jeongmin,"There was a room without a room key. It means anybody can open and enter into my room without my permission. So I had to carry valuable products and it was inconvenient. I naver expected that I would stay a keyless room because there were no explanations about that. Thanks to Michael and leah, I learned that I should ask about a room key before deciding Airbnb house. such as ""Can I lock the room with a key?""  
Honestly, there was bad smell. The room was not bad whithout smell.
현관문 열자마자 꼬랑내 남. 방은 그래도 작은 air supply(?) 와 방향제로 꼬랑내를 감추려 했지만 그래도 조금 남. 주방과 거실 사이에 방들이 있는데, 주방에 식탁이 없어 거실에서 먹어서 그런지 방에 냄세 다 들어옴. 욕실 쓰려고 욕조에 있던 머리카락(?) 제거 할때마다 토할뻔;; 왜 다른 사람이 후기에 clean 하다고 썼는지 노이해.
"
1355094,55268549,2015-11-29,47930337,Meng,it was a wonderful stay. the bed was great for sleeping. The location was very convenient to get around.
1355094,56194757,2015-12-10,2289094,Fiannah,"This place is great!! Michael was away during our stay but Leah is a great host. She responded quickly and provided heaps of information, making check in and out very smooth. The room and house were all very clean and tidy and we immediately felt welcomed in all of the communal areas of the house. Everything was very clearly labelled. The area is awesome, we walked everywhere from the house, and there are heaps of great bars and restaurants just 2 mins away! Would definitely recommend! "
1355094,57313931,2015-12-24,41284444,Suishan,"This is my first time to use Airbnb, and leah is  so helpful, she text me a lot and tell me what to do. And they have really detail information so no worry. The location is quiet and nice,some times u can even see the night view of city. The house is clean and warm~ everything is prepared . I love it "
1355094,58271484,2016-01-02,36091887,Ziliang,The room is safe and it's not necessary for me to lock the door.
3925573,20041321,2014-09-22,1834412,Freya,"The apartment was very cozy and homey. Everything was clean, organized, and the apartment was easy to find. It was a nice welcome after a few hours drive. The listing information was (website hidden) is a few minutes drive to downtown too and the cab ride to public market was $12 cab ride (awesome!). There was ample parking on Dexter Ave street as indicated. I highly recommend this to any small groups (2-4 people). Thank you for the comfortable stay! "
3925573,37519684,2015-07-07,15450873,Debra,"Great location, close to Fremont, Gas Works Park, short drive to downtown, and the Space Needle! Communication with hosts was very good, checkin and out went very smoothly. We'd definitely recommend this place for anyone visiting Seattle!"
3925573,37896790,2015-07-11,16706554,Brandon,"Awesome location, and great setup for our stay in Seattle. "
3925573,40870541,2015-08-02,22813896,Alex,"Lovely apartment! Very clean and cozy. Amber was very friendly and super responsive, and left handy instructions and a guide to the neighborhood for me. Great location (walking distance to cute Fremont restaurants and the Fremont troll!). Would stay again!"
3925573,46998620,2015-09-14,1016961,Fanny,"Amber's home was a delight. I felt very welcome, and had one of my best Airbnb stay. Thank you for everything!"
6101613,50625854,2015-10-13,9008994,Neil,"Mayza was very helpful. He met us at the house and showed us around and made sure we didn't have any questions. He had coffee, eggs and OJ for us to use. 

The view really is as good as it looks. The deck would be a great place to hang out in the summer. The house layout worked well for us. My mom stayed upstairs and my wife, children, and I stayed in the two bedrooms downstairs. 

It is very well located. It's an easy drive to UW and downtown Seattle."
6101613,51259102,2015-10-18,6534299,Karina,"The home was perfect, it was in the perfect location close to UW and downtown Seattle. The host was very accomodating. Everything in the home was spotless and the high end decor was beautiful. The view was gorgeous. We were five people and all had space and could easily have had more people accommodated very comfortable. The garage also a bonus. The pictures were accurate. The process was seamless and we didn't have any issues checking in or checking out. Highly recommend this property!"

Michael was really easy to get in touch with and did everything he could to make our stay relaxing and pleasant! We had a great time on our short trip and can't wait to go back! "
7665415,49630335,2015-10-05,4835486,Susan,Absolutely great place in West Seattle.  Both spacious and cozy.  In a neighborhood but a step or two from Downtown.  It was perfect for our needs.  Thanks.
7665415,50781839,2015-10-14,1384700,Todd,Michael and Bob are great hosts. The other neighbors nearby are very friendly as well and helped my daughter and I feel very welcome.
7665415,54490428,2015-11-20,45989903,Michael,"Great little spot.  Felt like my own apartment.  Ran into the folks downstairs who were super nice and offered any help.  The entrance is off-the-beaten-path.  It was a quick trip for me, and enjoyed every minute!"
7665415,55437488,2015-12-01,47987259,Kevin,"Our stay at Michael's place was wonderful !! It just as described clean, great neighborhood, great location and close to our daughter who we were visiting for Thanksgiving. My and I would highly recommend Michael's place for a stay in West Seattle !!!"
7665415,57779254,2015-12-29,48367329,Kay,"This was our first air bnb experience and we are off to a great start. Michael communicated with me with all details of our stay. The Hideout is cozy and comfortable with plenty of space. We appreciated the breakfast items - did not have to make an immediate run to the grocery store. The view from the kitchen window of the water was another treat. And the location... It doesn't get any better this. Literally, every shop, restaurant, bar, grocery store is right around the corner in The Junction. Also, the Rapid C bus is a block away-express service downtown.  After long days of sight seeing, the Hideout apt. made us feel at home and met our needs."
7665415,58056223,2015-12-31,47061498,Michael,"Wonderful stay in aa apartment above a West Seattle cottage. We used to live in the area, remember it. The apartment is not new, but a great re visit to how those houses were back then."
4226386,56541010,2015-12-14,33557502,Patrick,"Ben was very flexible after my arrival was delayed about 2hr.
I didn't get to meet him, but his gf was friendly (and his cat!), and the place itself was both nice and conveniently placed, great for a short stay."
4226386,56822421,2015-12-18,459545,Tiffany,"I had a wonderful stay with Ben and Johanna. They have a beautifully designed apartment in a great part of town and an adorable cat. I left something behind, and Ben kindly overnighted it to me the very next day. Would absolutely love to stay again.

557126,2061740,2012-08-21,2890972,Dennis,"Chad & Ruben were amazing hosts. My brother and I were stuck in Seattle--all hotel rooms in the city were booked. Literally last minute we found Chad and Ruben's place. It was perfectly located in funky Capitol Hill. It was an excellent homebase for exploring the city. 

C&R's place was clean and the bathroom was big. They were very accommodating. They changed the front door lock code to the last four digits in my phone number so it would be easy for us to enter. We also cooked a tasty breakfast in their stocked kitchen. 

Overall our experience was amazing. We were from being screwed to an ideal situation. Great house, great location, great hosts. Chad and Ruben even left of travel goodie bags for the road! I'll definitely be back."
557126,2129933,2012-08-28,2743598,Anna,"Chad and Ruben were great hosts for our stay in Seattle! Their apartment is convenient in a hip part of town, clean and spacious - with a great private bathroom!  They were very accomodating to a change in my travel plans and had even offered me a ride from the airport the day I landed!  I would highly recommend this stay and thank you both so much for a great experience!"
557126,2183098,2012-09-03,3304686,Ted,"I needed a place to stay for PAX, and found Chad & Ruben's place. They are very friendly and accommodating hosts. They were easy to contact and offered lots of suggestions and insights into the Seattle area. The location is just a short 10 min walk down to the Convention Center.

The room is a spacious den area with a twin size bed and a full bathroom. A bottle of water, an iPhone charger, maps of Seattle and ear plugs were conveniently provided for use in the room.

This was my first time using Airbnb and it was a great experience. The room was nice and hosts were great. I would stay stay here again in the future. "
557126,2257058,2012-09-10,578872,Tammy,Chad and Ruben (and their adorable pup)'s place in Capitol Hill was perfect for my quick stay in Seattle! They were both welcoming and communicative before and during my stay. They were very helpful when I was trying to figure out where to go and the best way to get there. They even took me on a quick driving tour and graciously offered me rides when they were out and about! The location is great! Getting to and from major attractions was easy by foot and by bus. Their property is also close to lots of places to eat and hang out in the Capitol Hill area. The room itself is inviting and comfortable with a good wifi connection if you need it. I would totally stay here again if I'm back in the area! Highly recommended!
557126,2341300,2012-09-18,494486,Sara,"I had a perfect stay at Chad and Ruben's listing! My time in Seattle was brief, but thanks to Chad and Ruben's tips, I ended up having memorable experiences I wouldn't have had otherwise (I highly suggest checking out the Public Library and taking a ferry). Their listing is in a perfect location for exploring Downtown, but the neighborhood itself is worth checking out as well. The room is incredibly cozy, quiet, and serene, with an attached bathroom that is generous in size. The room has the type of ambiance that beckons you to hit the snooze button. If you're traveling solo, I highly suggest Chad and Ruben's quiet Seattle sanctuary. "
557126,2387045,2012-09-23,3593942,Genevieve,"Chad and Ruben were delightful hosts. They were super friendly and eager to accomodate. Their house is conveniently located in Capitol Hill and is a short walk from amazing cafes, eateries and pubs. My girlfriend, and I felt right at home. We would stay here again--and so should you!"
557126,2757382,2012-10-29,62605,Sandeep,Great place located right in the cultural epi center of seattle. Capital hill is where its at and staying with Chad and Ruben was great!!! Nice room and very clean. Thanks guys! 
557126,3589622,2013-02-19,2776636,Jessica,"Chad and Ruben were great hosts and we really had an enjoyable experience staying with them in their lovely home.  Our room was cozy and very clean and they made sure we had everything we needed during our stay-- towels, shampoo, water, etc. The bathroom is huge and has a really nice luxurious rain-like shower head and the bed was buried in fluffy down comforters and loads of pillows. They kept the house nicely heated, which was a great comfort to return to after being outside in the cold all day. Their dog, Rush, is also the cutest, sweetest little hotdog I've ever seen. He was wagging his tail so hard when we met him, we thought his butt was going to fall off. :) Overall, it was a great stay and we would highly recommend Chad and Ruben's home to anyone."
557126,3609986,2013-02-26,2315832,Abbie,"Chad & Ruben's room is not only charming, it is peaceful and comfortable and well-appointed, and was exactly what I needed. I came to Seattle (my home-town) for a job interview. This location is so easy for public transit, and anything else you could need can readily be had within a 3-block radius. The room is beautiful, the bathroom is enormous, the wi-fi is solid, and coming and going was easy and quiet. There is even an impressive supply of high-end hotel toiletries, and a hair dryer. There is a little bit of normal urban neighborhood street noise at night, but your hosts provide a white-noise fan and ear plugs if you need them (I was fine).

Best of all, you will have the best hosts here. Chad was very friendly and a pleasure to talk with, and communications were wonderfully smooth. With flexible check-in and check-out, we arranged for me to let myself in when I got there a little before 1pm, and I had to get going early on the day I left. I didn't get to meet Ruben this time, but even so he sent me a text wishing me luck for the interview! Chad took very good care of me, and it was a delight to meet their mini dachshund Rash (such a welcoming little gentleman). 

I had everything I needed staying in Chad & Ruben's charming room on Capitol Hill. Come and have your own perfect stay!"

Chad and Ruben gave us some great places to check out around the city. We would definitely recommend this place. 
557126,3851050,2013-03-20,5214673,Hugo,"I moved to Seattle looking for a home, work, and school, and was fortunate enough to have AirBNB assist me in my transition. Chad and Ruben were great hosts, courteous, considerate people with a wonderful home. This is a great deal! I would definitely stay here again, if I was just visiting."
557126,3929226,2013-03-28,5244076,Kate,Wonderful hosts and a great location! It was so easy to walk from the apartment to great restaurants and cafes. Chad and Ruben created a cute bedroom/bathroom set up that made us feel like we had our own private space. It was perfect! 
557126,4058223,2013-04-06,5611849,Joel,"One word: Beautiful! Chad and Rueben have done an amazing job of creating a soft and very welcoming room near the entrance of their super cool home so you feel comfortable as either the daytime busy body or social night owl. LOVE their sweet little puppy, and as hosts they are fun and easy going. The room is in the perfect spot for the city, and we will definitely be coming back. Thanks for everything guys!! (Becky and Joel)"
557126,4104148,2013-04-09,5701772,Sidnee,This was my first Air BnB adventure. I loved staying with Chad and Ruben (and Rash!) I will definitely repeat the experience when I'm next in Seattle. My room was beautiful and tranquil. My hosts were friendly and easy-going. I only hope that all my future Air BnB experiences are as delightful.
557126,4228872,2013-04-20,5897262,KateLynn,Perfect first air bnb  experience! The place was clean and adorable and a great location!
557126,4253021,2013-04-22,486298,Garrett,"Wonderful location within walking distance to restaurants, cafes, clubs, and other attractions in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle. Convenient to downtown, Space Needle, transit and other attractions. Chad and Ruben were very sweet and down to earth. We'll definitely stay again next time we're in Seattle. "
557126,4318215,2013-04-27,311524,Nick,This room is awesome. It's basically like your own private apartment but Chad and Ruben are there if you need help or have questions. The shower is also fantastic. 
557126,4352305,2013-04-29,6040388,Paul,"Well-kept, modern, and welcoming, the room you find behind charming french doors was absolutely wonderful. Their home is in an ideal location, within easy walking distance to a main drag of Broadway. 

Chad was very gracious, friendly, and helpful, and Rash the dachshund was adorable. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our one-night stay and will definitely look to stay here again!"
557126,4454178,2013-05-06,5828464,David,"Chad and Ruben offer ideal accommodations with privacy and a location close to everything.  We had a car but walked nearly everywhere, including downtown to the Opera.  Street parking is very difficult and public garages are scarce in this area.  Still, the location and friendly hosts make this an excellent choice."
557126,4524289,2013-05-10,3579546,Lisa,Our stay at Chad and Ruben's place was wonderful. We felt very comfortable and it's a beautiful apartment and vicinity. The room was clean and had everything we needed and more. I would definitely stay there again.
557126,4540770,2013-05-11,1226103,Rick,"I've paid twice as much for hotel rooms that could not hold a candle to this space. It's not only clean and beautiful, but they really paid attention to little details like a bottle of water next to the bed. And the shower head in the guest bathroom... oh boy, words fail. A great experience. "
557126,4580119,2013-05-13,1373814,Anthony,Chad & Ruben are wonderful hosts.  The room was great and we received wonderful hospitality.  The location was perfect for us and the parking is available but you may have to park a block away but no big deal.  We look forward to staying again!
557126,4648979,2013-05-18,5739106,Anna And Stan,"For our first airbnb experience we had found the ideal place at Chad and Rubens house.
The room is very cozy, the private bathroom very convenient and clean! The whole 
Going to town was in walking distance (about 15-20 min.) but there is also a busstation close by with a starbucks at the corner ;)
The whole ""booking-process"" was very easy and also the access to their house.

Thanks Chad and Ruben, we had a great stay.

557126,4687172,2013-05-20,2093586,Angel,"This room was perfect! Chad and Ruben really went above and beyond - from lovely decor to upscale sheets, bedding and lots of pillows, to water bottles and mints beside the bed! The attached bathroom was also very clean and luxuriously outfitted with cushy rugs and a fancy shower head! I felt very comfortable coming and going and I never felt like I was disturbing anyone, regardless of the time. The location is amazing, with a bus stop into town just a block away, and Capitol Hill nightlife an easy walk down Broadway. I felt safe walking alone in the area, even late at night. I really have only glowingly positive things to say about this place and my hosts! Hope I get to stay with them again!"
557126,4747039,2013-05-23,4506559,Anthony,"I was looking for a convenient and clean place to crash and shower.  I was running around Seattle like a crazy person so this worked out beautifully.

Chad and Ruben made it so easy for me to come in at my own time with no hassle with keys, etc...

the bathroom is 100x better than my own bathroom, so I appreciated that - and the bed was super comfy - i wanted to sleep in.

great place - i recommend!

Thanks C&R!

Best,
Anthony"
557126,4839726,2013-05-28,5734754,Elizabeth,"Chad & Ruben were wonderful hosts!  The room was clean and spacious with an adjoined, private bathroom.  While our schedules didn't give us an opportunity to meet in-person, they were polite and communicative via email and very instructive on how to access the house and its location.  I'd highly recommend their place and it was a wonderful introduction to AirBnB for a first timer.  Thanks!"
557126,4954081,2013-06-03,4546163,Julie,"Great room, bed, location and shower. "
557126,5014339,2013-06-07,2520325,Nina,"This place was beautiful! Great neighborhood, safe and quiet location, easy access to Capitol Hill's Broadway and downtown. I only stayed here 2 nights, but would love to stay again the next time I am in town. The room was very cozy and the bathroom was equipped with any necessities in case you forgot them. The booking and check-in process were really easy with Chad and he was very quick to respond to my messages. Chad was very friendly and he was polite to give me some space after a very long day at work. Highly recommended."
557126,5089101,2013-06-11,6495057,Camille,"Chad and Ruben were wonderful hosts! Chad was very quick to respond, making check-in and check-out run very smoothly. The private room and bathroom were nicely decorated, and they even provided water bottles and some toiletries. We hardly ever saw Chad and Ruben, but they were incredibly friendly during our brief interactions. Ruben even suggested a few food places to check out nearby. The location is walking distance to night life in Capitol Hill and about a 25-minute walk to Downtown and Pike but coming back is quite the uphill trek. Great place to stay if location and privacy are key priorities. I would definitely recommend this place!

Thanks Chad and Ruben! :)"
557126,5123513,2013-06-13,4175531,George,"These guys are friendly and easy-going. I barely saw them, but their place is very convenient, clean, and comfortable. "
557126,5162339,2013-06-16,6246101,Joanna,"Chad and Ruben are exemplary hosts.  The accommodations are top notch.  Their home is lovely.  Light and beautiful.  Room is super clean, roomy, private and had everything we needed.  Comfy bed.  Perfect location.  The neighborhood has wonderful places to eat, walk and shop.  All our Seattle sights were within walking distance or near transit. Street parking is available, but certain times or days of the week can be a challenge. Lots of construction around the house at the time we stayed, but our schedule was up and out early, return late, so not a problem.  Ruben offers friendly and helpful suggestions, maps, your wish is his desire.  If you need a place to stay in Seattle, stay with them!"
557126,5350955,2013-06-25,1622408,Heidi,Chad and Ruben were excellent hosts. They have a very lovely and clean home and our room was perfect -- even included a private bathroom. Located in a cool area of town so we were able to walk around and explore the neighborhood. Would absolutely recommend!

Thank you and will book with you guys again if I come back to Seattle again! "
557126,5514662,2013-07-03,4243299,David,Chad and Ruben's place in Capitol Hill is the best!  The location couldn't be better if you are looking to experience the best social scene in Seattle.  We were just a few minutes walk from upper Pine and Pike streets with great bars and breweries (like The Elysian).  Also just a short walk down to Melrose Market where I would recommend Taylor Shellfish for the freshest seafood I've ever experienced.  Chad and Ruben were incredibly friendly and accommodating.  Their guest room was conveniently located at the front of the house and both the bedroom and bathroom were spotless.  Parking can be a bit challenging but that's Seattle for you.  I'd give my highest rating to Chad and Ruben.  Definitely check them out if you are planning a trip to Seattle.

Staying with Chad & Ruben was my first Airbnb experience, and it couldn't have been more perfect! Communication, accommodation, hospitality, convenience, and location were all top notch. It really was an amazingly comfortable experience...especially coming from a single female traveler. Chad & Ruben were really great people and hosts....but the leader of the welcoming committee was their adorable dachshund Rash! He was the best! I highly recommend staying with C&R if you are in the Seattle area...as I will not hesitate to book with them again if I am in town. Thanks guys!!"
557126,5703009,2013-07-12,7292041,Julie,"Chad and Ruben were very welcoming. They let us know in advance that they would not  be home when we arrived, but had everything organized a couple days before so that we could get into the house. The house was clean, quiet and safe. I liked their personal touch of leaving mini dachshund soap in the bathroom to welcome you.  "

557126,5913407,2013-07-22,203713,Vivian,"Chad and Ruben's place was everything you could ask for from an Airbnb listing -- extremely clean, quiet, private, and comfortable. The shower head in the bathroom is amazing! Checking-in/out is very convenient; we didn't have to wake them to accomodate our late check-in/early check-out. We would definitely stay with them again on our next Seattle trip!"

I barely saw them because they rarely use the first floor where the room is located, but the two times I ran into them they were really pleasant and informative. They room itself was super clean, cozy, and quiet. In addition, I really like the coded entry system into the home because I didn't have to wait to be let in or worry about carrying a key with me my entire trip. The location is pretty perfect too. It's right in the heart of Capitol Hill. There's plenty of cafes, bars, and restaurants within walking distance from their home. All in all a great experience!"

Loved the location -- quiet but a short walk to either the Broadway or Pike/Pine corridors for nightlife and restaurants.  Spacious and quiet. Had a bit of trouble staying connected to the WiFi, but otherwise everything was great!  "

Hope we can come back again one day, would recommend to anyone to stay here. Catch the 49 or 43 bus not the 60 as Metro Trans told us, it's easy to get to and from town on. Room is great and heaps of space and lovely bathroom, excellent value.

Words cannot express how great the both of them are and how welcome they made us feel.  Their accommodations are so warm and comfortable and their hospitality was just perfect that we can't wait to return!  Their home is located in a perfect location so close to everything fun but quiet as well so it's a lovely retreat in the middle of the city.  We are so happy that we chose to stay with Ruben and Chad and little Rash, the cutest little dachshund around!!  Thank you guys for the wonderful hospitality and give Rash a little snuggle from us.  We can't wait to come back and visit again!  And if you two are ever down in Dallas, our door is always open. :)

The house and room were very well kept and in a fantastic location; walking distance to a ton of great bars and restaurants. We even walked to the space needle and pike place market. Chad and Ruben were very friendly and professional and the keyless entry system made the logistics of they stay super easy. Highly recommend staying here to anyone looking for a comfortable stay in an awesome neighborhood.  
557126,7234662,2013-09-11,1499019,Eric,"My girlfriend and I got stuck in Seattle and needed a place last minute. Even though they had someone check out early that day, Chad & Ruben got the room turned around for us so we could stay that night. The room was really nice. The bed was comfortable. It was quiet and the shower is amazing :) After a stressful day, this was exactly what we needed. We even went out to get a bottle and when we got back, Chad has placed two wine glasses and a bottle opener next to our bed on a silver platter. That was really cool! Thanks guys! If we're ever in Seattle again this is where we'll be staying."
557126,7415708,2013-09-19,2012291,Christian,Last time I was in Seattle. I stayed at Chad's & Ruben's place and I really enjoyed. Perfect location near Broadway with good restaurants and I also like pretty much the fancy Capitol Hill area. Also the room and bathroom was perfect for me. So five stars and thank you very much!:-))
557126,7752941,2013-10-01,4397874,Claire,Chad and Ruben were warm and welcoming. I had no trouble coming and going as needed. The bed was incredibly comfortable. Two thumbs up from me!
557126,8111505,2013-10-16,7362361,Jenny,"Chad and Ruben were fabulous hosts.  The room was clean and neat and everything about the stay was easy.  Honestly, the place was so quiet, we hardly knew we were sharing with Chad and Ruben.  When we did bump into them they were warm and genuine.  Their house is walking distance (less than 10 min) from two to-die-for coffee shops: Top Pot (damn fine donuts) and Vivace's Brix location (other-worldly caramel macchiato).  We were without a car and the central location was appreciated; the International district is about a 30 minute walk and Pike Place Market is about 25.  My husband had a meeting in the convention district and that was only a 15 minute walk (or $6 cab).  Would totally stay here again on a return trip!   "
557126,8213687,2013-10-21,1375042,Stephanie,"What a beautiful house! We were in Seattle for less than 30 hours and I wish we'd had more time to explore Capitol Hill because we had such a great place to stay. Our room was cozy, comfy and was much better appointed than our own house (and most hotels). I love the keyless entry as well, which makes things super convenient. Chad and Ruben were extremely responsive via text and I was disappointed to not had a chance to meet them and their little doggy. The dachshund soaps had to make do. :) Thanks, guys!"
557126,8533767,2013-11-04,1530405,Justyn,Chad and Ruben were great hosts. Their place was perfect for our weekend getaway. Location was ideal for easy access downtown.  Would definitely stay there again if we're in Seattle. Excellent choice!
557126,8631358,2013-11-09,4331326,Ariel,"Chad and Ruben's place was great!  They were really helpful and immediately responded to all of our emails.  We were only there overnight and didn't get to meet, but their messages were friendly and their place was really comfortable.  Its in a great location (right off of Broadway), but its still really quiet.  It ended up we were coming down with colds when we got there and the bed was so comfy and the room was so quiet that we were able to fall asleep by 8:45!  Also, they have a great shower/tub and in general we couldn't have asked for anything more!  "
557126,8753906,2013-11-16,1711244,Beth,"We had a great stay in Seattle, and the room was very comfortable with a large private bathroom. Convenient location, easy to find, and communicative hosts. Thank you again!"
557126,9140558,2013-12-09,1318240,Jamie,"Quiet, cozy room in a great location.  Very communicative and gracious hosts."
557126,9725467,2014-01-06,788695,Aditi,"My boyfriend and I were in Seattle for a weekend in Jan and stayed with Chad & Ruben. We got in pretty late on a Friday, but their house was very easily accessible because of the key pad. The room was very comfortable and we had the bathroom to ourselves. You really can't beat the location - we walked everywhere and really enjoyed the coffee, restaurants, and nightlife of Capitol Hill. "
557126,9790544,2014-01-10,10796889,Luigi,"It is a creepy experience to be watched by someone you have never met, through hidden cameras and surveillance videos.  During my stay with Chad and Ruben, I was never able to meet them face to face, but I know for certain that they were watching my every move while I stay in the room in their house.

Some feel Edward Snowden is a hero and other feel he is a traitor.  If you feel Snowden is a traitor, then you will feel right at home with Chad and Ruben.

But if you feel that Edward Snowden is a hero, and you like your privacy (even if you are not doing anything wrong), do not stay with Chad and Ruben.

Although I would hope they did not have cameras pointed at the bed or in the bathroom, I would not be surprised if they did."
557126,9847100,2014-01-13,1465081,Panos & Eduardo,"We had a wonderful night at Chad and Ruben's place. Very clean, exactly as described and in an ideal location. Chad and Ruben were very friendly and communication was very easy. Thank you so much, we hope to visit again soon!"
557126,9999718,2014-01-24,3596437,Sa,Excellent location and cute room. Getting in and out of the flat is a breeze with the keypad system. Was a perfect place for a short business trip. Very friendly hosts and an adorable dog!
557126,10198414,2014-02-05,10185648,Ricky,"Chad and Rubin are great hosts. I haven't met them until the third day. Everything was set up for me when I arrived and it was perfect. The room looked exactly the same in the picture. I just met Chad for a few minutes but I knew he is a really nice guy. Great location and I could walk to downtown and space needle within 20 minutes. I will definitely recommend the house to people who travel to SEATTLE. 
"
557126,10426017,2014-02-18,6234171,Faith,"Chad and Ruben were wonderful hosts. Their home is warm and lovely and in an ideal location. We were within a half mile of dozens of amazing restaurants, bars, coffee shops, bookstores, and local boutiques and markets. We would highly recommend staying with Chad and Ruben, the accommodations were excellent. Thanks for a great weekend, Chad and Ruben!"
557126,10532324,2014-02-24,7587689,Jonathan,"Chad and Reuben were great! The room was comfortable and clean, as was the bathroom. I loved the neighborhood and the convenience to downtown.  "
557126,10755768,2014-03-06,9047180,Kali,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and I can't think of any way it could have been better - well, except for the weather.  The room is great and both Chad and Ruben were excellent hosts.  We did not see much of each other (I was out and about), but they managed to communicate welcomeness, and I knew that if I had truly needed anything they were there.  They had thought already of everything that might make a traveler/visitor comfortable.  If I get back to Seattle, I will book this one again."
557126,10867105,2014-03-10,12804976,Kyle,"I decided to make a last minute trip up to Seattle from Portland to visit some friends and contacted Ruben and chad. They accepted my reservation openly and were very happy to have me. The room was beautiful and just as depicted in the pictures. Huge bathroom! Parking was difficult being in the Capitol Hill neighborhood but I was able to find a spot a couple blocks away. 

Because I was gone virtually the entire time except to sleep, I didn't get to meet Ruben or chad but I had a very nice time staying at their place!"
557126,10972506,2014-03-15,4124342,Steven,"Chad and Ruben's room is clean, simple, and tastefully decorated. The location is quiet, but very close to the heart of Capitol Hill restaurants and shops. Chad was very responsive to our room request and very accommodating.  "
557126,11035179,2014-03-17,13005400,Kayo,"Although I have known about Airbnb for a while, it wasn't until this stay that my partner and I actually used the service. Chad and Ruben's home was the perfect choice for our first Airbnb experience and we couldn't be happier. From now on, every one of my trips will include an Airbnb reservation. If you are coming to Seattle, we highly recommend staying with Chad and Ruben. The location is perfect. So much so that one of their windows frames the Space Needle as if a picture of it was hanging on the wall. The home is beautiful, comfortable, intimate and private. There are lots of restaurants, bars, fun spots and stores at walking distance. And of course, the hosts were excellent! I'm sure I will reserve with Chad and Ruben in our future trips to Seattle. We loved it! "
557126,11213911,2014-03-25,2213041,Francisco,"We cannot recommend Chad & Ruben highly enough.  They were terrific, sweet hosts and the room was comfy.  Super sweet bathroom too.  The location is perfect, close to where you really want to be.  Thanks, dudes!"
557126,11418042,2014-04-01,5901239,Francesca,"Ruben is a great host! Made me feel right at home and worked very hard to accommodate my special needs. Very clean room and convenient to downtown. Made the trip very easy. I am an older person, they were great with me!  Would do so again. Loved staying here! "
557126,11458367,2014-04-03,5897944,Virginia,Chad and Ruben were wonderful hosts and the apartment was charming. The location was great. It had very easy access to capitol hill which has a lot of wonderful restaurants and stores. Chad and Ruben both gave me excellent suggestions on my apartment searching in Seattle. Thanks guys! I would recommend staying at Chad and Ruben's home to anyone. 
557126,11549063,2014-04-07,12988677,Karen,"Great hosts, beautiful home. They didn't mention the super comfortable bed, awesome shower, and a view of the Space Needle from the living room! Chad was very cool (we didn't meet Ruben, but I'm sure he's cool, too). They gave us the perfect safe-haven for our honeymoon. Much appreciated. "
557126,11803379,2014-04-15,1964453,Victor,Great place and great hosts.
557126,11963208,2014-04-20,1353969,Darren,"Lovely place right in the centre of Capitol Hill, perfect for the bars and restaurants. Also on several bus routes from downtown, great for everywhere. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay, the place was perfect."
557126,12288156,2014-04-28,6212784,Allison,"This was my best Airbnb experience yet! Chad and Ruben are super considerate hosts with a charming, clean, and conveniently-located house. They even helped us out with restaurant recommendations and directions around the city! I highly recommend this one. "
557126,12546808,2014-05-05,11524112,Nichole,"I had such an enjoyable stay! Great location for coffee and brews. The room was charming, very clean, and the private bathroom was much appreciated. I had the chance to meet Chad and Ruben on my last night in Seattle, and both were very friendly and welcoming. If I am ever in town again, I will definitely be staying with them!"
557126,12806741,2014-05-11,2699277,Robert,"My stay was Brits, 2 nights only and limited, I was out at a seminar for 2 days returning with only enough time to wind down and go to sleep.  My needs on this trip were simple, to have quiet comfortable private space with no interruptions:  this is exactly what I got. I would rate this b'nb very highly, right in the heart of the city, making inner city transit very easy...I will never stay in another hotel chain again!  Chad and Rubin know what they are doing!!"
557126,12881936,2014-05-13,11707680,Alexandra,We had a great stay with Chad and Ruben in Seattle - we stayed two nights but wish we had longer! The place is centrally located and tidy and their dog is gorgeous. We also got lots of tips on local restaurants and sights for our next few cities. We loved our stay and would definitely stay with Chad and Ruben again. 
557126,12988561,2014-05-16,13100467,Patrick,"Chad and Ruben were great hosts! The bedroom and bathroom were both  beautiful and clean. 
My flight was canceled so I missed an entire evening with them. I was super bummed! But they were so sweet. To make up for the lost day they gave me a gift certificate to a great restaurant (poppy. Check it out!) 
What nice guys! 
I would definitely recommend staying with them "
557126,13150749,2014-05-20,6887079,Ashley,The location and room we were provided was PERFECT. We flew and took the light rail from the airport to find our room ready and in impeccable condition. Chad and Ruben's home is nestled in Capitol Hill on a quiet street. Less then a 5 minute walk from the night life Cap Hill is known for. We walked everywhere. It took us about 15 minutes to walk to the space needle and from there maybe 10 more minutes to walk to pike place market. Coming and going couldn't have been more convenient. They are very friendly and their dog is the sweetest! I only wish we could have stayed longer! 
557126,13293170,2014-05-24,560743,Zachary,Very comfortable stay with very nice hosts! Could not have been more pleasant.
557126,13515060,2014-05-29,14898073,Catherine,"An amazing getaway vacation!  The room had ample space for my boyfriend and I, and the house was extremely clean!  Very straightforward instructions on how to get into the house.

For any travelers who plan to bring a car, be prepared to spend anywhere from five to twenty minutes looking for street parking!  There is a lot of construction going on around the Capitol Hill district, and many streets have sections blocked off.

Other than that, great stay, comfortable bed, nice fresh sheets, well working shower!  I had the chance to meet Chad and Ruben and they were extremely welcoming and kind!  I would love to stay here again!"
557126,13886018,2014-06-07,2005955,Elaine,"Chad and Ruben's place is really cute.  I had my own really quiet room with a nice closet, comfortable bed and all of the sitting, electricity and privacy accommodations I could have needed.  I never met either of them because I was there for a busy convention and gone all day but it was so easy to get in and out of the house and I had use of the kitchen if I need it (I didn't!).  The bathroom is spacious and lovely.  The location is convenient and I was able to get what I needed at all of the local establishments right in the area.  DEFINITELY would stay again! (tip: if you need total darkness for good sleep bring an eye mask)"
557126,13978928,2014-06-09,15735039,Dorothy,"This was my first AirBnB experience and it was great! I would highly recommend Chad & Ruben's Charming Capitol Hill Room. It was a clean, welcoming room with a bathroom, which was super convenient. The location was prime as well. It was a 15 minute walk to downtown and it had tons of restaurants/bars around. Awesome stay!"
557126,14165116,2014-06-13,4406837,Sarah,Chad and Ruben were great hosts. Our room was as described with a direct connection to a large bathroom that had everything we needed. Very happy with our stay thank you!
557126,14557476,2014-06-22,14565051,Brenna,"This was the first time my boyfriend and I used Airbnb. We were incredibly happy with the experience. Chad and Ruben were excellent hosts. The room and bathroom space was more than enough, and everything was exceptionally clean. Their place is located near all the sites, making it easy to explore the city. Plus, they were great at communicating before and during our stay. We highly recommend their place.  "
557126,15089816,2014-07-02,12396101,Juan,"We had a wonderful time at Chad & Ruben's place. The room was as described and the location even better. Very central, close to many nice shops and restaurants, you could walk everywhere or take a quick bus at a nearby stop. I would book it again without hesitation. Thanks guys!"
557126,15490111,2014-07-10,15199651,Jeremy,Worked great with door code. Everything was clean and easy. Bed comfy and location was close to restaurants and public transportation. Very nice hosts!
557126,15675730,2014-07-14,422958,Michael,Just returned from a great stay with Chad & Ruben. The room was stellar. Our hosts were very thoughtful and took care to ensure our comfort during the recent heat wave. We were delighted with the neighbourhood and were able find an overnight parking garage right around the corner (a little pricey but convenient). Highly recommended. 
557126,15952378,2014-07-19,7700838,Ian,"If you are looking for a great room to stay in Seattle, then look no further. Chad and Ruben were fantastic hosts with a wonderful room available. The room was clean, the bathroom was spacious, and the bed was very comfortable. They welcomed me to their home and were available if I needed anything, but generally left me to my own devices. A door code allowed me to not need to worry with a key so I could come and go as I please. 
I would absolutely stay here again and fully recommend the room for anyone looking for a great place near downtown Seattle. "
557126,16132868,2014-07-22,17047441,Amber,This location is perfect to everything and everywhere I have planned for my Seattle trip as I used to lived on Capitol Hill and their house is close to public transportation and close to coffee shops I wanna go. The hosts are very quiet and they were nice and very accommodating when I asked for leaving my luggage early in the morning. They were super patient with my messages and tried to work out the room for me as soon as possible. The room and bathroom itself is very clean as well! It's a nice and safe neighborhood as well. I definitely recommend this host and this bnb. 
557126,16344186,2014-07-26,374347,Jessica,"We had a lovely stay at Chad & Ruben's room. Their house is in a perfect location, quiet and comfortable. The bed was comfy and we had our own bathroom, and we liked being able to use a code for the door and not have to worry about keys. Great hosts, beautiful home, would love to return!"
557126,16549450,2014-07-29,5777574,Chris,"Chad and Ruben's room was perfect for what we needed in Seattle's cool Capitol Hill neighborhood. Walking distance to great places to eat and drink, shopping and convenient to downtown. The room was very cozy and bigger than what it seemed in the photographs. The bathroom was spacious and private. Plus a very cute dog!"
557126,16782226,2014-08-02,13853941,Colleen,"This room was wonderful! Comfortable and clean. The location is  unbelievable - close to great restaurants, bars, and shopping. Sadly I didn't get to meet Chad or Ruben, but will definitely stay here again next time I'm in Seattle!"
557126,17097560,2014-08-07,4623396,Claudia,Great place to stay - covenient & comfortable.  Only complaint was street parking is difficult to find in the area.  Better off not having a car and using cabs to get around.
557126,17372319,2014-08-11,5734643,Lisa,"This was the perfect room for a weekend in Seattle! Great, quiet location, just steps away from coffee shops/restaurants/bars. Chad and Ruben (+ cutest wiener dog) were super hospitable hosts: clean and comfy, our bedroom was prepared nicely, and the best part is that they have an electronic lock system. No keys, no fuss. Just a special code you need to know. Would definitely recommend to any solo/couple travellers. Oh, and did I mention the big bathroom? "
557126,17517382,2014-08-13,1028326,Jenny And Alex,"Chad & Ruben's place was great. Very conveniently located with some great restaurants around. The room was very neat, with a comfortable bed and spacious bathroom. Our schedule's were such that we only crossed paths with them once, but they were helpful and responsive over email, and very accommodating of our arrival / departure schedule. In all, a great place to stay. "
557126,17621806,2014-08-15,5097685,Trista & Jason,What a beautiful home in a perfect location! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and will come back on our next trip to Seattle!

557126,18309614,2014-08-25,16668281,Yori,"Chad and Ruben's beautiful home was a delight to stay at. They made it super convenient and I felt extremely welcomed into their home. The room itself was wonderful and exactly as described. I especially appreciated that it felt very much separate with its own bathroom so I never felt like I was intruding during my stay.

The location was also perfect, right in the best part of Capitol Hill within easy walking distance to anything you might want. From the cafe with excellent coffee around the corner to the diner-esque breakfast place just a few blocks away.

Both of the hosts were welcoming, friendly, and very attentive throughout my stay. I can't recommend staying here enough. Thanks so much Chad and Ruben!"
557126,18478403,2014-08-27,5863885,Catherine,"Highest recommendations for this lovely room, it exceeded all expectations. The room was welcoming, beautifully furnished, and extremely clean. It also has an enormous private bathroom attached. The bed was giant and also extremely comfortable, and the room was full of thoughtful touches like an AC fan, guides to Seattle, extra blanket and pillows, and reading lamps. Honestly, it felt like staying in a nice hotel. I did not have much contact with Chad & Ruben as I was out of the house most of the time, but they were swift, helpful and friendly over email.
The neighborhood was walking distance to cute shopping, food and cafes, and I actually easily walked to downtown as well (about 1.5 miles)."
557126,18788699,2014-09-01,15927635,Christine,"Accueil chaleureux , appartement très agréable tel qu'il est décrit , bon quartier restos à proximité "

557126,19321428,2014-09-10,137667,Matthew,"We enjoyed our stay at Chad and Ruben's. The room was nice and clean as depicted. Chad and Ruben where not home during our stay, but where nice enough to allow us to stay there regardless. The Capital Hill area is pretty cool and very walkable.  We enjoyed Poppy, Native, and Sun Liquor. The only challenge for us was finding street parking.  It's possible, but one day it took 30 minutes."
557126,19521053,2014-09-14,5917905,Karla,"Everything about our stay was great. The room was exactly as pictured/described.

557126,19671658,2014-09-16,17019005,민희,"we couldnt see much each other but i bet they are more kind and wonderful than i experience them. the house was nice and clean also was the bathroom. they prepared some supplies that we may need such as shampoo, soap, towels, and etc. (we prepared our own tho) And, other thing we love about is the transportation. All the bus stops are near around the house, easy to get to downtown."
557126,20082124,2014-09-23,9370377,Daniela,It was a brilliant experience. Chad and Ruben are so kind and at the same time they have given space and freedom to us. We have felt confortable all the time.

We met Ruben just 5 minutes but he was a very kind person and carefull. They also have a lovely pet named Rash . Even if we didn't have many contact with our hosts ( they were working and we were on vacation ), it was very easy to get in touch with them by e-mail. 
We recommand Chad and Ruben at 100 %.
Thanks again for everything .
Yves and Daniel "
557126,20413551,2014-09-29,17739551,Eva,"We had a wonderful stay at Chad and Ruben's home! The room was perfect, with a great private bathroom. We were very comfortable. They gave detailed instructions regarding access to their home well in advance, and were very respectful of our space. Whenever we did cross paths, they were both very friendly and hospitable (and their dog was a complete sweetie). Their home is in a fantastic neighborhood, and we were able to wander all over Capitol Hill and downtown on foot without any problems. This was our first AirBnB experience, and we can only hope that all of our future stays are as positive as this one. We loved it, and definitely recommend them as hosts to other prospective guests. 

E & J"
557126,20649670,2014-10-03,18686311,Dennis,"Such a great stay in Chad & Ruben's house, they are very nice to me. The house is very sweet and warm, just like the picture, more than clean and comfortable; the location of their house is very centre-located, 15 mins to downtown by walking and also have convenient public transportation nearby. All in all, great people, great house. Next time I come to Seattle, I will again stay with them! "
557126,20749421,2014-10-05,284103,Michael,"The place was great!  The directions to get to the place were on point, and the instructions for getting in worked well.  We didn't get to see our hosts much during our stay, but they made sure we felt right at home.  Everything was as advertised and if I'm ever back in Seattle and would like to stay in Capitol Hill, I will definitely consider this place again. "
557126,21130963,2014-10-12,3512792,Anna,"We had a lovely time with Chad and Ruben. They were so welcoming to us, giving us lots of great suggestions of restaurants and bars around their home. We also really appreciated how they let us keep our bags in their living room after we checked out so that we could explore the full day without lugging suitcases around. Their home is beautiful, and our room and bathroom were warm and comfortable. Their home was a great place to come back to at night after traveling all around. We would definitely stay there again! "
557126,21665963,2014-10-21,3738771,Saad,"Such a great stay! Chad and Ruben were so kind, helpful, and accommodating. Ruben generously chatted with us about Seattle even though he was sick during our stay. The room's location is right in the heart of Capitol Hill, so it's walkable or quickly uber-able to just about everywhere we wanted to go. Also, that shower is luxurious. Definitely recommend staying with these guys if you find yourself in Seattle. "

557126,22067645,2014-10-29,16116336,Hans,We had a great time.  We came for a convention for work.  The place was awesome!!
557126,22203339,2014-11-01,1183702,Koren,The description was as described and very nice. The bathroom was large and modern. I asked for restaurant recommendations before we came and we ended up eating at and loving all three - we went back to the Malaysian take-away 3 times. Great haven in the noise and bustle of Capital Hill and downtown.
557126,22360544,2014-11-04,10828355,Vincent,"Very easy to get in this nice and comfortable accommodation , very clean ,  large bathroom with monochromic and Picasso's painting decorated ! 
Close to down town and from the nice broadway road district up town with many restaurants and bars
I have just meet Ruben and the home pit bull Rash because we never be at home in the same time !  
Will stay there again next stay in Seattle with pleasure . 
"
557126,22503551,2014-11-08,22647946,Zach,"Wonderful stay with Chad and Ruben. Great area of town walkable to all major sites, and the room and bath were comfortable and private. Will definitely schedule again on any return to Seattle."
557126,22790802,2014-11-15,1781507,Ben,"Chad and Rubens room is just perfect in size and has its own huge bathroom attached to it, very much to my convenience. It is located in capitol hill, just arround the corner of most of the action and only a ten-minute stroll to downtown. Een though we rarely ran into each other I felt welcome throughout the whole time."
557126,22914438,2014-11-17,23180352,Cédric,"it's was very clean, it was like i expect and the area around is very pleasant. 

Cédric. "
557126,23079143,2014-11-22,794507,Kyle,"I had a really comfortable time at Chad & Ruben's. Everything was super clean, neat, and spacious. The location couldn't have been better (try Glo's for breakfast and In the Bowl for every other meal).

I never actually met my hosts as our schedules didn't line up, but check-in was incredibly convenient and Chad & Ruben were very communicative. All told, a great stay. "
557126,23658863,2014-12-07,8994409,Alastair,"Chad and Reuben were very welcoming in their lovely home.

Facilities were excellent and the code key access meant I could come and go as I pleased.

I'd certainly recommend this to anyone visiting the city"
557126,24146308,2014-12-21,17115788,Sean,"Great location and awesome hosts. Really nice neighborhood. The room was really nice and felt like our own private suite. Didn't spend lots of time in the listing but it was really nice to feel at home after a busy day on the city. 

Only met Chad who was really nice and let us know if we needed anything they were there. Really helpful in recommendations of things to do before we even got there. Highly recommend this place if you are in Seattle."
557126,24938651,2015-01-04,13637693,Scott,"Chad & Ruben have a lovely home in the hip neighbourhood Capitol Hill. The room is fantastic - lovely spacious bathroom, closet space, cozy atmosphere & great bed - although a bit darker than the picture suggests. They are warm hosts and we'll definitely be back. "
557126,25267693,2015-01-11,22862862,Lucy,"What a cozy home! The bedroom is big and has it's own, also large, private full bathroom. Very clean, lovingly clean actually. So important. And I can't say enough about how comfortable the mattress is. Good night's sleep every night. Plus the neighborhood is very quiet even though it's a hip, lively neighborhood. I easily walked to and explored downtown one day, but on another day just stayed and explored the Capitol Hill area. Plenty to do but the best is eating. Ask the hosts for recommendations. You will not be disappointed."
557126,25550447,2015-01-19,2796401,Chad,"Chad and Ruben get all the little details right, right down to setting the entry code to the last four digits of my phone number so that I could remember it easily. The room felt plenty spacious for two people and our luggage. The bathroom was roomy enough to do some post-flight yoga in, and everything was clean, well-lit, and comfortable. We only met them on our last morning there, shortly before leaving, but felt completely welcomed even in their absence. As for the neighborhood: it's delightful. Right off of the main road through Capitol Hill"" A few blocks in another direction from Top Pot donuts (worth a visit), and in another direction from a fabulous coffeeshop that seems to be a favorite weekday morning stop for many people in the neighborhood. "
557126,26268290,2015-02-08,22331798,Mari,"Chad and Ruben were amazing! Super friendly and helpful. They were flexible with our check in time and the place was very clean. We had everything we needed there. The location was perfect as well, everything was in walking distance. Even when we took uber to downtown it was only $5 - $7.
Great experience. Definitely would wanna stay with them again if we make a trip there. "
557126,26451159,2015-02-13,25773391,Christopher,"The listing and pictures portray perfectly what you can expect, which is an amazing value for a private room.  Chad and Reuben were extremely friendly and willing to offer suggestions about the area - food, transportation, things to do, etc."
557126,26702119,2015-02-17,9656004,Eddy,"I really felt at home. Chad and Ruben are charming.
The location is great and the neighborhood so lovely.

"
557126,26950484,2015-02-22,5678236,Judd,"Lovely room in a perfect area!

The space was clean, private, and comfortable and couldn't be more perfectly located to explore/experience the city. Chad and Ruben provided great recommendations and were extremely welcoming. When we visit again, we will definitely see if their place is available. Thanks guys!"
557126,27594704,2015-03-08,25723475,Jill,"This experience was the absolute BEST. The house was easy to find, the room was so easy to navigate and the overall feel was just so relaxing. The door code system made coming and going a breeze. I ran into Chad and Ruben twice, and they were just great! The location was super convenient to everything I wanted to do in Capital Hill. I look forward to staying here again in the future. "
557126,27935288,2015-03-15,8967263,Donna,"There was a nice little 'hello' note on my bedside table.  Everything was clean and the furnishings and bathroom were well-appointed.  There was an extra blanket at the  food of the bed for this thin-blooded Californian for coziness during a rainy, cold Seattle night.  Very quiet and a nice counter-point to the busyness of my visit.  I had several questions about the proximity to my workshop and restaurant recommendations. They were generous and forthcoming."
557126,28368269,2015-03-22,21398541,Peter,"The best location - easy to access to route 5 and walking distance to everywhere including all the coffee shops, local restaurants (Crumble and Flake is the best), super nice bed (high end mattress), very clean house with high ceiling, big and nice bathroom with a nice shower head, and the most, your own privacy (you will feel like you rent the whole house).  Chad and Ruben are very friendly and professional.  Highly recommended."
557126,28558953,2015-03-26,13954424,Lusia,"My friend and I had a very nice stay at Chad and Ruben's. We only met them for a few minutes, but the room was lovely and clean, just as pictured and with very nice touches. Thank you for a lovely stay!"
557126,28722027,2015-03-29,19394472,Amber,Great host and cozy room. The location is perfect and the price is reasonable! 
557126,28913332,2015-03-31,717900,Ryan,"First of all, let me tell you how amazing this location was for my trip. It's literally within easy walking distance to nearly every Capitol Hill destination that you could imagine. Top notch.

But with the amazing location comes difficult parking—something that was explicitly said in the listing. One night I drove around for 45 minutes looking for a spot. You probably shouldn't bring a car anyway, but I had one, and it was tough.

Chad and Ruben are excellent hosts. I only met Chad, but he was kind, helpful, and welcoming. He knew the right balance of talking but also allowing me to rest.

The room itself is exactly as described, tastefully colorful but dark for sleeping, and quiet. I had a great time and felt extremely comfortable."
557126,29841847,2015-04-13,20698996,Jose,"The room is nice and comfortable and so is the private bath. It is a 15 min walk to downtown Seattle (or 2 min to the bus stop). Chad and Ruben were very good hosts and I will definitively stay again should I return to Seattle.
"
557126,30444422,2015-04-22,1397261,Thomas,"Great place, awesome location in Capital Hill. Close to everything and it worked out really well for my conference within walking distance at the Convention Center. Chad and Ruben are very nice hosts."
557126,30780320,2015-04-27,27438776,Chloe,This was a fantastic introduction to Seattle. Chad & Ruben's house is very lovely and is certainly in a fantastic location. They were very welcoming and we would certainly recommend staying there to anyone. Thanks guys. 
557126,31033767,2015-05-01,4205197,Cristina And Steve,I did not meet hosts. They have a lovely quiet home. Great location. Clean and tasteful decorated place and lovely bathroom with tub. Plan to stay again.
557126,31782294,2015-05-10,12147239,Yifei,"The home was amazing, and the room was better than we could have imagined. It was very well decorated with lots of helpful brochures and pamphlets for things to do around the city. Unfortunately, we didn't get to meet Chad or Ruben during our stay, but after this experience, we look forward to staying with them again in the future! "
557126,32340265,2015-05-17,3177759,Chema,"El lugar es hermoso y muy convenientemente ubicado. Es posible caminar desde allí a otros puntos de la ciudad. Idóneo para explorar Capitol Hill.
La habitación estaba impecable. El baño compartido realmente no tuvimos que compartirlo. La ducha es perfecta, con agua caliente y toallas disponibles. Espacioso y agradable.
Los anfitriones son muy flexibles y no necesitan estar presentes para tener acceso a la casa. Ideal para personas que requieren especialmente privacidad o independencia.  
La amabilidad de los anfitriones también fue muy grata. Satisficieron todas nuestras necesidades. Incluso nos prestaron una plancha y una tabla para planchar.
Ninguna queja al respecto, todas nuestras recomendaciones."
557126,32973606,2015-05-24,1972502,Josh,We had an awesome time with chad and Ruben. Great house in a great location and they were super friendly. A++
557126,33452093,2015-05-28,32095322,Kort,"All was just as described in the listing. Chad and Ruben were very good about providing the necessary information for the stay. This was our first Airbnb stay, and in our view a total success! The neighborhood was quite 'European' in character (we spend a lot of time in Germany), close to downtown, and well-stocked with coffee/bakery/meal options. "
557126,34052955,2015-06-04,27004883,Amanda,"The room was very comfortable and location was convenient to walk or bus to many sites.  We stayed here while attending a conference and unfortunately our schedule didn't line up to meet the hosts, but it was very accessible and felt welcome.  We loved having the suggestions for local businesses/restaurants on the bookshelf.  Definitely recommend!"
557126,34625174,2015-06-10,28580171,Ariel,The stay with Chad and Ruben was outstanding. They provide a great quiet room with an adjacent bathroom. The room feels completely separated from the main living areas in the house which gives it a fantastically quiet  and private experience. Everything was clean and tidy. Ruben and Chad were so very welcoming and sweet. They made our stay feel very warm as if we were staying with very close friends. At one point I pointed out something in the house I really liked (a food sign) and by the end of the day Ruben got me one from the market. So very sweet! The house is at the best location in town - a quiet part of Capitol Hill. We walked everywhere and felt so close to home. Bottom line - great experience and I highly recommend this fantastically charming room in Capitol Hill.  
557126,35065503,2015-06-15,27976281,Lauren,"We met Chad who was very friendly and welcoming. Our flight was delayed but that was no problem because we had our own security code to enter the house. The room and neighbourhood were exactly as described. Even though we were in an area with lots of foot traffic, the bedroom and the house were quiet and we slept well.  The house is close to cafes, pubs and shops and we could walk to downtown. Buses were easy to access. We definitely would stay again. "
557126,36267254,2015-06-27,608592,Victor,"Chad and Ruben's private room in Capitol Hill was perfect for a weekend getaway. It was clean, comfortable, and impeccably decorated. The location was perfect for a nightcap, some bar crawling, or a nice walk to many of Seattle's attractions. All in all a wonderful place to stay."
557126,36952854,2015-07-03,11404301,Ian,The listing was very accurate.  Chad and Ruben made everything straight forward and comfortable.  The neighborhood was very walkable.  
557126,37478634,2015-07-07,2714867,Nick,"Jackie and I had a wonderful stay at Chad and Ruben's lovely apartment. Though our interactions were brief, I could tell that both Chad and Ruben have put considerable thought and care into their apartment and making sure that their guests feel welcome and accommodated.

The neighborhood is great -- with restaurants, parks, bars, and a large grocery store all within easy walking distance. It's also a quick 30 minute walk or $7 uber ride to downtown/belltown.

Thanks, again, Chad and Ruben for your hospitality! All the best to you both."
557126,38429728,2015-07-15,18032953,Michael,"We spent two days at Chad and Ruben's place on Capitol Hill. The area is very lively with lost of place to eat, supermarket around the corner and a 20min walk downhill downtown. Chad and Ruben made us feel very welcome and right at home. The room is quiet and comfortable, clean and nicely decorated (as is their house). Warmly recommended!"
557126,38834154,2015-07-19,32094147,Grace,"Our stay in the house was great, and although we only saw Chad and Ruben on our last day, they were incredibly helpful and responsive. Also, the keyless entry was a major plus - really simplified things and allowed for flexibility!

The location is perfect, steps away from tons of restaurants and the energy of Capitol Hill. From the house, we also easily walked to downtown, Pike Place, Union Lake, and many other locations. The room itself was lovely with everything that we needed. Weather was hot (90 degrees!) but the room came with a fan that helped cool it down. I would recommend this to anyone hoping to stay near Capitol Hill!"
557126,39336413,2015-07-22,15720471,Gabe,"Quiet, cosy, and comfortable this was the perfect place to stay on Capitol Hill.

Everything was great, the location, the room, the bed and the private bathroom.  I hope I can stay here next time I come to Seattle.

Also the way they handle entry is perfect. No key to receive, return or lose.

My schedule was pretty busy so I didn't get to see Chad and Ruben much, but when I did they were great. I hope to get to spend more time with them next time. "
557126,40319199,2015-07-30,32856381,Tim,"Due to our schedules, and as much as I was hoping to, I was never able to connect personally with my hosts.  The house and room was lovely and easy to get to.  As I was on a budget, I took the train from the airport and then walked from downtown.  

It was also an easy 20 minute walk to the Space Needle and downtown from the house.  The room was large, very comfortable and in very good condition.  The bathroom is also quite large and roomy and the shower head was so good, I loved taking a shower.  If I had any complaint, I would have like some brighter light in the bedroom.  The overhead light was dim.  Overall, no real complaints.  I highly recommend it!"
557126,42331394,2015-08-12,9078996,Vinita,"What may have otherwise been a decent experience was marred by the horrendous parking situation.  There is NO street parking within blocks at any time of the day or night.  I wish the hosts had noted this prominently on their website, or provided some potential solutions (my flight was late -- I got in around 3:00 am, dealt with parking until 5:00 am, had to wake up again before 8:00 am to re-park my car.  The room itself is decent -- the pictures show it to look brighter and bigger, and more sophisticated than it is.  Overused bedding and towels, and the carpet covering the wood flooring seems a bit grimy. However, the bed and pillow are comfortable, and the bathroom is nice and roomy.  Room colors are great ... Did not see (but did hear) the hosts although they responded promptly to my couple of messages about the area via email.  "
557126,43034432,2015-08-17,32797152,Alicia,"Chad and Ruben were welcoming hosts. They were friendly and helpful. The place and neighborhood met most expectations. The room and bathroom were clean, which was huge for us. The bed was comfortable. The room was darker and smaller than what the picture shows. A good experience overall."
557126,44755937,2015-08-29,31689055,Collin,"Chad and Ruben offer an excellent clean, private, and quiet room in a great neighborhood which offers something for everyone, and just a short walk from downtown. Unfortunately we did not meet Chad and Ruben directly, but that speaks to the respect and privacy they provide with the separate room and bathroom, as well as the tailor made house access provided via your own key code. "
557126,45484545,2015-09-03,38174859,Marly,"What a great first-time Airbnb experience! A lovely home and comfortable surroundings. Chad and Ruben anticipated every need; even had bottled water out for us, with a ""hello"" note. The neighborhood was wonderful for walking, dining, people-watching, house-looking, and some shopping. My first trip to Seattle and I felt like I experienced it the way I was hoping to. Easy bus riding from their home, as well. They even have reading lights by the bed, which we did not find in our subsequent lodging!"
557126,46127086,2015-09-08,3750198,John,We had a good visit and stay. Everything was as advertised. Chad and Ruben were available for any questions. Clean neat. Recommended for a Capitol Hill stay in Seattle. 
557126,46736564,2015-09-13,16887028,Jia,"The space is excellent, it is very clean and private. The bathroom is especially huge and clean for two people. The neighborhood is also quite nice and is in a great location. Chad and Ruben are super nice and helpful but respect our private time.  Everything is accurate as described. Would strongly recommend to stay in Seattle!"
557126,47139080,2015-09-16,23251884,Andy,"Chad and Ruben provided everything that is good about the AirBNB experience. They have a lovely stylish home and the guest room is of the highest standards, the check in procedures the best we have encountered so far, and Chad and Ruben were able to answer any questions that we had. The neighborhood is good and not too far from Downtown Seattle for either walking or buses. We would certainly use this residence again for future stays"
557126,48533621,2015-09-27,1098918,Richard,"We really enjoyed this spot in Cap Hill. Just a 1/2 block off the main drag with many a spot an easy walk. Also an easy walk to downtown and even the Space Needle if your feeling frisky. The Starbucks Reserve store is maybe 10 min away. A must see on my list!!! Unreal dedication to Coffee.

This was my very 1st Air BnB experience.

The key less entry is brilliant. The room and bed are super comfy and the bath ROOM! is huge. Nice to have that a few steps away. A full bath tub for soaking. Shelves for your ""stuff"" and a small down comforter for chilly nites. 

Used the kitchen very little, mostly to microwave my coffee.

Needed to add a 3rd night and they accomadated that with little hassle.

Only met the pooch once, he's adorable. Didn't really see our hosts much either. 

The best thing was their recommendation for Taylor Shellfish Farms. OMG!! Do Not miss it. 1/2 block from the Starbucks Reserve. 2 other locations but I think this is the orig.

I could rattle off numerous more fun spots we found.

Thank you both."
557126,50444185,2015-10-12,22170089,Zachary,"The house and are room very nice. Excellent shower, great bed, and nice decor. I would highly recommend. "
557126,51080053,2015-10-17,5012646,Martin,"Chad & Ruben were wonderful hosts. Their room was nice and had everything you would need for a few nights including a lot of leaflets, maps and some guidebooks about Seattle. The new queen bed offered the best sleep I had on my whole trip. The neighborhood was also nice, quite calm in their street but with more life (bars and restaurants) only some steps away. I would absolutely recommend to stay with them and also would so again."
557126,51975530,2015-10-25,1556318,Elham,The room was really cute and cozy and so was the whole house. We really liked having our own bathroom connected to the room and felt like we had our own private corner in the house. The whole process was really easy and smooth. Chad and Reuben were super accommodating with the times we arrived and left. They even left us an extra little heater for the more chilly nights. The location is great and walking distance to all the great places in Capitol Hill. We met Chad and Reuben on our way out and enjoyed the small interaction that we got to have with them. 
557126,53493681,2015-11-09,8066863,Deven,"Chad and Ruben were fantastic! Didn't get to meet them unfortunately, however, the home and the room is fantastic! No issues with anything and the water pressure is awesome! 

Tons of Car2Gos around as well :)"
557126,56617942,2015-12-15,3902098,Victor,"Super comfortable, conveniently located, and easily accessible room! "
557126,56987790,2015-12-20,36308008,Erica,We really enjoyed our stay at Chad&Ruben's place. It was very cozy and we loved the color of the room. Great location. There's a great place for breakfast just across from the street on Olive Way. We hope to stay there again during our next visit. 
7110923,52315029,2015-10-28,40829237,Celly,Very cute house located in a great location
7110923,53018025,2015-11-03,1786903,Emily,Our family of 4 stayed at Cathy's place this past weekend. We had a wonderful time. The house is lovely. Well decorated and very comfortable. The kitchen is gorgeous and the finished basement was a serious hit with our kids. Thank you so much for letting us stay at your place. We would love to stay again. 
7110923,53155712,2015-11-05,30286277,Rick,"Cathy was the perfect host.  She communicated well regarding the method of entry / key placement, timing of arrival, etc. The house was perfect for anyone needing three bedrooms - quite a spacious place. Located in a good neighborhood with lots of restaurants, bars, and other amenities nearby. The decorations and finish for the home was very well done - just as shown in the photographs.  There is a nice back yard area, and a kitchen well stocked with utensils (although we did not cook).  Overall, an A+ experience.  Highly recommended."
7110923,53682715,2015-11-11,30023073,Duyen,"Cathy was a great host. Her response time to questions was always very quick and she made sure we knew that she or her husband were available anytime we needed help with the house. We forgot our toddler's ""ok to wake"" clock at the house and Cathy mailed it to us a couple days later without even asking us to pay for postage. 

The Ravenna house is very comfortable, nicely remodeled and in an extremely desirable location. The street that the house is on is a very busy street and there are lots of parking rules, but the one off-street parking spot behind the house was convenient. We had a baby with us, so the room with the crib and twin bed was perfect for our needs. There was even a white noise machine in the baby's room. The daylight basement was full of toddler age appropriate toys and really made our stay in Seattle much easier--we didn't have to worry about finding things to entertain our two toddlers. Thank you for letting us stay at your house!"
7110923,54168402,2015-11-16,11551473,Tess,"This is such a lovely home and space! It was the perfect place to stay for a girl's weekend trip. We had four but it could easily sleep more -- the two queen size beds were really comfortable. It is well decorated, just like the pictures, and the kitchen space and two living rooms make for a great hangout area. Cathy was unbelievably accommodating, answered any questions quickly and provided clear directions for entering the house. She was flexible when we needed to change the reservation to add an additional night. She even had balloons! (maybe that was a coincidence but it certainly made the birthday girl feel special). I hope to stay here again and would absolutely recommend to friends or family visiting Seattle.  "
7110923,55185203,2015-11-29,1427646,Aylisha,"Cathy was a wonderful host! Instructions on accessing the house were clearly communicated. The Ravenna house was spacious, cozy, beautifully decorated and had everything we needed. The neighborhood was great, we loved the Sod House Bakery a few blocks away on 65th and found the nearby Ravenna Park to be a great place for a jog with the dog. Would love to stay here again!"
7110923,55735160,2015-12-05,12174449,Tania,"The house was beautiful and well-appointed. Cathy was kind, quick to reply to questions, and accommodating with arrival and departure times. I loved the open kitchen and living room and you can't beat the water pressure in the shower either :)
I went for a work trip with colleagues but it would be also perfect with kids, with a room with a crib and twin bed and thoughtful touches like bath toys and room to play."
7110923,57418516,2015-12-25,50162018,Harold,The host canceled this reservation 167 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7110923,57880725,2015-12-30,32055945,Susan,"Cathy went beyond being a great host by putting up a 6 ft Christmas tree with lights, so my family could feel at home on Christmas morning.  The house was comfy and we cooked a chateau Briand to perfection in the kitchen.  Easy access to Green Lake, or the Univ. area.  Will miss the croissants at the bakery I walked to every morning. "
7110923,58413911,2016-01-02,34614285,Colleen,"Great House, great host, great location! We booked this house based on the great reviews, and now we have another one to add. The house has been renovated nicely but still felt relaxed enough to let our kids enjoy as well; there were lots of toys downstairs as well. The open kitchen and living room make a nice sized room for us all to enjoy hanging out together. Cathy responded in minutes to our original request and checked in to make sure we had everything we needed. The location was great, within 15 minutes to downtown, the zoo and Bellevue. Thanks Cathy!"
6652199,35153116,2015-06-15,14484399,Nan,"Katrina and Sumner are fabulous hosts - friendly,  welcoming,  knowledgeable, and energetic.  Their home is very nice, clean, and bright. The bed and bedroom were perfect - I slept very well.  Private,  clean bathroom.  They shared their living area and kitchen,  and even a meal,  with me. I highly recommend stayng with them,  and plan to go back myself. The neighborhood is walkable, Greenlake is wonderful, restaurants and Whole Foods are all nearby. "
6652199,35438539,2015-06-18,17454009,Robin,"Katrina and Sumner were very nice and welcoming! Their home is beautiful and super close to downtown Seattle and the University of Washington campus. Nice hosts, great location, beautiful home, very clean room and bathroom, ... The perfect spot to stay in/around Seattle!"
6652199,37895246,2015-07-11,20952457,Martina,"Great place, clean bathroom, stocked with the essentials! Comfy bed, cozy room! Dogs were not disruptive at all, great hosts! "
6652199,41094515,2015-08-04,14484399,Nan,"If you are looking stay near Greenlake north of Seattle, definitely consider staying with Katrina and Sumner. They are a super nice couple, keep a very clean house, and know the area to be able to give suggestions. The accommodations are exactly as presented, very comfortable, private, clean and relaxing. I slept very well! Highly recommended. They even gave up their parking spot for me. "
6652199,41640334,2015-08-08,37745280,Marcus,"We had a nice and quick one night stay.  The room and bathroom were perfect - clean, very comfortable, and private.  Katrina was a great host - communicative and friendly.  "

Place was nice and clean!

Recommended! +++++++"
6156470,33044534,2015-05-24,6390099,Timothy,Anna was wonderful.  Her house was clean and beautiful.  We had a great stay.
6156470,33198637,2015-05-25,33837960,Kate,We had a great time staying with Anna for our night in Seattle. She was very welcoming and gave us great ideas for things to do around town. Her house is very cozy and had everything we needed!
6156470,33737264,2015-05-31,34063138,Geo,"There isn't enuff good I can say about my stay with Anna.  She is a gracious host, to say the least.  I was in an adjacent room during my stay.  Aside from a few mistakes on my part (I booked a day earlier than my flight left), everything was smooth.  

The place is clean and tidy, which are not the same thing.  I was allowed to use the amenities of the home as long as I cleaned up behind myself, which I did with little effort.  The home reminded me of being at my mother's house where I clean up as much as I can, but never to the degree of my host.  I thought I was in for some laborious cleaning routine, but it was easy.  I even wanted to help!  Anna kindly offered me use of any room visible, which only excluded her room.  I made oatmeal, used the fridge, and watched YouTube on the living room TV.  I got the sense I could leave and return as I wished, but I had no desire to go out and about after dark.  I could have easily since she lives in a Pleasantville sort of neighborhood, but I enjoyed my space.  I also had solitude.  My host was very respectful of my privacy and attended to my questions with a humble alacrity that made the stay most pleasant.

Nearby are plenty of restaurants of the non-chain sort.  Oddly, I got lost a few times thinking the shops were farther than they were.  I was that close to food and beverage, it was unbelievable.  There is also a very nice park nearby with a lake.  I went kayaking twice and could have gone paddle boarding, rowing, among other activities.  

Honestly, I would and do intend to go back.  I would not choose any other residence, if given the choice.  The price is reasonable and the host is respectful of your preferences, including but not limited to recreation.  She is also a great conversationalist.  She also has good taste in food.  We went to the local grocery store and had the same appreciation for unadulterated foods.  

The Bad:  Too many reasons to stay in and chill
The Good:  Too many reasons to stay in and chill
The Verdict:  This host is guilty of giving me everything I needed in a vacation and more.  It's perfect for a little time away from the job, the family, and whatever else makes you want to be off the grid for a few days."
6156470,33868954,2015-06-01,34200110,Kelly,"Anna provided a warm welcome and made us feel at home. the neighborhood is cute and vibrant, and her home is right in between Wallingford and fremont neighborhoods. The blue room is lovely and as described. we will be back!"
6156470,33969652,2015-06-02,10134755,Kelly,Anna's place was a fantastic stay.  She is super warm and welcoming and I enjoyed being in her home and presence.  I travel often for work and will definitely be staying with Anna again!
6156470,35481649,2015-06-19,32542620,Can,"Anna is awesome! If you stay long enough at Anna's place, you will not only like Anna as a great host, but also like her as a sweet friend. 

She's a very encouraging and positive person, whenever I see her (before I go to work/ after I come back) and talk to her I feel happy! She's also super kind and willing to help, on arrival she picked me up and when I moved away she drove me to the new place, and took a tour in her car! She's also a great person to seek advice about Seattle -- e.g. she recommended Green Lake and I had an enjoyable afternoon kayaking there.  And I can still keep writing when I think of more. 

And for the house itself, it's exactly as pictured! Clean, tidy and beautiful, Anna takes good care of everything and I felt like home. I stayed in the blue room it's bright and cute. There is a big closet with LOTS of hangers. There's a guitar too! Sadly I forgot the cords of some of the songs.  Bathroom is super clean, doing laundry is also quite easy, and you can cook in the kitchen too. 

For dog lovers, you will definitely want to meet Nala (the cutie as you see in the photo). She's very calm and just so CUTE! I accidentally locked myself out (was my mistake) one evening when Anna was already asleep, and Nala barked and barked until Anna woke up :D. "
6156470,36116132,2015-06-25,26708596,Robin,Anna is a great host. She made me feel right at home and I had a blast in Seattle. The room was spacious and comfortable. The location was perfect. Easy access to public transportation and the lake. Thank you Anna for a home away from home. Hope to see you again!
6156470,36234299,2015-06-26,30877040,Hannah,Had a lovely time at Anna's. Great first night in Seattle. Would recommend her. Anna is an eclectic and colorful host with a clean and tidy place. Was flexible with the check in and check out times. Friendly dog. 
6156470,36443280,2015-06-28,32708478,Daniel,"Anna was a gracious host!  She was very friendly and welcoming. Checking-in was really simple, her availability was perfect for us. The room was a good size with space for hanging clothes. We mentioned that we were going on a hike and she let us use her hiking guide, which was so helpful! Her home is in a great neighborhood, just a few blocks from the main street in Wallingford, we had easy access to buses, shops and everything we needed. She was incredibly accommodating and went above and beyond our expectations. We couldn't be happier with our first Air bnb experience!"
6156470,36907934,2015-07-02,31477686,Elizabeth,"My friend and I's stay at Anna's was wonderful! She showed us an incredible amount of hospitality and made us feel very welcome during our entire stay. It's in a great location nearby a grocery store, several restaurants, a zoo & Green Lake. Anna's dog Nala was such a sweet heart! We didn't hear her bark once and she was very chill. Overall, we highly recommend this Cannacation!!"
6156470,37005162,2015-07-03,36667033,Lindsay,"Anna was a gracious, open and warm host. She let us come and go as we pleased, but offered great conversation and life nuggets while we were there. Thanks again Anna for opening up your home! It was perfectly located and we would recommend to all. "
6156470,37484689,2015-07-07,23484551,Hannah & Matt,"Anna's place is an awesome location with a grocery store and restaurants in walking distance. The lake is nearby and Golden Gardens beach isn't a very far drive. Anna is a fun host with a lot of energy and a great personality! We enjoyed chatting with her and her dog NaLa is very sweet. Overall we'd recommend Anna for anyone wanting to stay in Seattle's Wallingford neighborhood. 

As she mentions in the description of her place, she is 420 friendly so if you have any allergies or sensitivities to smoke I wouldn't recommend but we personally didn't have any issues. "
6156470,38471082,2015-07-15,14279397,Dominique,"We had a great time exploring seattle with Anna's home as a base. Anna was a great host. Her home is adorable and our room was comfortable and clean. We booked our stay with her that day, and even with the short notice she responded quickly and was willing to host us. She was extremely welcoming, fun, and friendly. We had a great time getting to know her and had some great conversation. I would recommend staying with Anna without reservation and would point out that she is also LGBTQ friendly."
6156470,38544881,2015-07-16,14540077,Molly,"Anna was so sweet and welcoming! She was extremely responsive to texts as we arrived and greeted us at the doorstep with her sweet pup, Nala. The home was beautiful and tidy. The neighborhood was perfect for walking to doughnuts (Mighty-Os), ice cream (Molly Moons), and other great edibles in Wallingford. The proximity to Green Lake was superb for going on a morning run. I wish we could have stayed longer and hung out more with Anna."
6156470,38670228,2015-07-17,21653977,Schaeffer,Anna was a fantastic host. Very warm and welcoming. She made us feel right at home. We were only there for a night but would definitely stay again!!
6156470,40749197,2015-08-02,17266630,Helena,"A lovely home and a lovely host...we were very comfortable and made to feel welcomed...sharing the kitchen and bath was easy...great location, restaurants and stores within walking distance. Overall positive experience! Anna is a sweetheart!"
6156470,41246583,2015-08-05,1971733,Caroline,"Anna is the perfect host - she loves her home and the neighborhood!  She was great about our indefinate arrival time, but made it easy for us to get into her house without any trouble.  She was very gracious when we got there; we had the opportunity to chat with her as well as have our own time.  We are airbnb hosts too, and though we weren't there very long, just one night, we loved being in her house.  The house is located in the Wallingford neighborhood of Seattle, on a fairly busy thoroughfare but close to restaurants, Greenlake, I-5, and buses to downtown. "
6156470,41407881,2015-08-07,37479921,E.Y. (Robert D),"Anna is a welcoming and gracious host, who opens her nice bungalow to us and our dog. Her dog was just as welcoming. The B&B has accurately described and was perfectly appointed. It's location is on a connective route between Interstate 5 and Rte 99, on rolling hills...timing is important to arrive, but Anna will help here, and with future parking.
A haiku might describe this best:
     Steel ridden stonewalls
      Fragrance four square porch view
       Wave pound on stonewalls
We will find our way back here for the next Seattle session.
Dog loved the walks and parks!"
6156470,42739566,2015-08-15,13935756,Gen,"very lovely place and very hospital host. We had a great time staying with Anna. She introduced many good places (farmers market, green lake, etc) to us. Definitely will come back again if I come to Seattle. And her dog is super quiet and peaceful. Strongly recommend. "
6156470,43074213,2015-08-17,25198940,Alyson,"Anna's house is quite central to a lot of nice places in the area. The park and lake for kayaking, a nice street with restaurants and shopping, and even better: there's parking! Her house is very welcoming and she made everything easy for us when we arrived quite late. She is a very thoughtful woman with a lot of spirit!"
6156470,43336095,2015-08-18,38793976,Ryan,My girlfriend and I decided on an impromptu trip over the border a few days prior since we both had the same days off from work. Anna's home is beautiful and we were warmly welcomed by her. Anna made us both feel more than comfortable and supplied us with lots of useful tips regarding the city proper. Right from the beginning Anna made it abundantly clear that we should treat her house as an extension of our own and that's exactly what we did. Anna's home is only a ten minute drive away from the city core which when we used Uber was a very inexpensive way to visit the local sites.  
6156470,43577223,2015-08-20,2027068,Nick/Alex,"Anna was super nice and affable. The house was clean and open, with several places to hang out (front porch, living room, back porch). She had friends over at times and I felt welcome to join the conversation, not at all excluded or awkward. The street noise was an issue for me since 50th St. is a busy lane and the bedroom is in the front of the house; what worked for me was closing the window and putting the fan Anna provided up on the end table for white noise."
6156470,43730926,2015-08-21,25230985,Max,"Anna and her place were both welcoming and unique. Her charm is found in every nook of the house. Practically, the available room was in perfect condition, with loads of open space for us to toss our bags. We stayed for an overnighter, but once I saw the place, I wish we could have spent more time there. Recommended!"
6156470,43885827,2015-08-22,7139169,Maria,"We had a wonderful experience staying with Anna. She was the most kind and welcoming airbnb host we've ever had, and we felt sincerely at home with her. We would 100% recommend staying in her relaxed, beautiful home. "
6156470,44327208,2015-08-25,17953055,Michael,"Anna is a good host. Communication on arrival was great. Picture of front porch helped find it on our arrival. Anna was helpful with neighborhood and what's to see in Seattle. 
Walking distance to a lot of nice restaurant choices, an excellent ice cream shop, and a grocery/pharmacy. Large park and zoo close by. 
Not to deter from Anna's hospitality:              1. Blue bedroom is on street side of house and 50th street is very busy. Traffic noise can not be shut out. It took a couple of nights to adjust to noise level. You can't park next to house between 4-6 PM during the week although side street parking is close by.
2. Our bed was not that comfy. "
6156470,44583946,2015-08-27,41287121,Gabriel,"Anna was amazing and really down to earth!  She was very amenable to when we showed up later in the day and was happy to call and explain the whole thing to a first time AirBnB-er.  

Her home is absolutely charming and the room we stayed in was perfect for myself and my girlfriend.  We both would be happy to stay with her again and connect, next time we come through town!  

Great location, great house, great host.  And, a great dog!  ;-)  Thanks Anna!"
6156470,45807668,2015-09-06,27384718,Stacey,"Anna was very communicative, and easy to get a hold of, which made planning our trip easy. She is a very gracious host, accommodating and friendly. She loves to share her beautiful little home with visitors, and is quick to suggest great ideas for sightseeing, local attractions, and entertainment. Her house is a quick Uber ride, or bus trip to downtown. It was so nice having a full-sized kitchen to use while we were there, to save from going out to eat for every meal. We would highly recommend staying with Anna and her dog NaLa!"
6156470,46245158,2015-09-08,24139,Eric,"Oh  this was so great she could have a place where when our friends came into town, and it was important to get some quick shelter four our friends. Anna was so gracious host our friends who are eternally grateful Their experience was beyond (email hidden)na does a wonderful job!

Eric and Stacey"
6156470,46454131,2015-09-10,19919102,Susanna,"So lovely, Anna is a wonderfully kind, caring and courteous host and her home is very inviting, clean, and as described. I found her listing very last minute but I am so glad I decided to stay even if it was just for 1-2 nights. Highly recommend, she is a perfect host and hope to see her again. Everything was perfect and she was incredibly helpful and polite!"
6156470,47275404,2015-09-17,6162253,June,"Anna was a wonderful and accommodating host who went above and beyond to make sure our travels were exciting and safe. She was very welcoming and seemed to genuinely love sharing her knowledge and home with us. She was very good about texting and communicating with us. The house, carefully decorated with style and charm, was a perfect place to call home during our trip. The bustling neighborhood allowed us to be close to anything we needed and was only a short bus or cab ride to downtown. The lovely presence of Nala the dog, the very generous Anna, and the serenity and cleanliness of this house really makes this a fantastic rental.  We absolutely could not have asked for a better place to stay or a better host."
6156470,47838984,2015-09-21,43734409,Skyler,"We had such an amazing visit to the city of seattle, thans in a large part to anna's wonderful hosting. Her house is located in a wonderful spot, centrally located, very near many parks, restaurants, farmers markets and a beautiful lake. Anna was very respectful and took us in with open arms. She went out of her way to provide us with very helpful details about the surrounding areas and great advice for fun ways to spend our time. The house is clean and accomodating and felt more akin to a visit with a long time friend than it did a short term rental."
6156470,49272641,2015-10-02,44749871,Nathan,"Beautiful home in Wallingford - location ideal for those who appreciate walking, running. The Woodlands Zoo, the rose garden, Green Lake trail were all within a mile. Anna is kind and sweet and considerate of your interests. She is also well versed in the medicinal uses of cannabinoids, whether for recreation, pain management or fitness. Perfect option for the adventurer who values a relaxed home base. "
6156470,49725868,2015-10-05,45310348,Judi,"Anna left the door open for us to arrive our leisure since we were not sure exactly when we would get in.  She arrived home shortly afterwards and was very welcoming.  Her home was clean, pretty and calm.  Everything was as described in the listing.  Her street is busy and I had to trust her that is was alright to park after certain hours on the street because it seemed the lane was still open.  She was right, I am just from a small town."
6156470,50413746,2015-10-11,5595351,Matt,"I had a great stay at Anna's place, very comfortable and she is welcoming and easy to get on with."
6156470,51571053,2015-10-21,45997100,Hope,"Anna was an incredible host, so warm and welcoming.  She had a lot of great info about the neighborhood, Seattle, and life in general.  I thoroughly enjoyed my talks with her the morning.

The neighborhood itself was great, parking was a dream and there was much to do all within a 5-10 minute walk, and downtown is merely a 15 minute drive!

I would highly recommend this spot to anyone, and will definitely stay with her again if I find myself in Seattle."
6156470,52002743,2015-10-25,38602162,Holly,Anna made me feel right at home. She was so sweet! Everything about her place was perfect. I almost wanted to ask her if I could move in. 
6156470,52451950,2015-10-29,24346166,Sichen,"Anna's home was very clean and cozy. The location was great, very convenient to downtown, and close to grocery shoppings and lots of good restaurants. Anna was a great host. I relocated to Seattle for work. So I was staying in her place as temoprary housing. She made it feel like my own home. She was welcoming and caring. Since I was new in the town, she even dropped me off to work for the first two days, so I could have enough time to figure out my way. I had great experience here. Thank you!"
6156470,53126131,2015-11-05,34934539,Diana,"Anna was an amazing host. She is so generous, knowledgeable and easy to talk to. Her house is beautiful, the bed is wonderful...I highly recommend staying with her! "
6156470,53658530,2015-11-10,48188986,J,Anna was a very gracious host and my first airbnb experience.  Her home was as described in a beautiful neighborhood and walking distance to everything you could want. And very close to downtown. 
6156470,54568048,2015-11-21,2305727,Chuck,"Anna was exactly what I needed when arriving in Seattle before a family trip. Just wanted to relax and enjoy some legal herb that was local and clean. That is exactly what I got along with great conversation and a new friend. The bed was comfy, room was private, jacuzzi was wonderful. It was everything I could have wanted, better than any hotel for sure. "
6156470,54893036,2015-11-25,2222944,Stephen,"Anna was an excellent host.  Her cozy home was warm and welcoming, just as she was.  She went above and beyond to make sure my stay was a good one, even going so far as to drive me to the airport!  I wouldn't have necessarily expected such generosity and helpfulness, but her prior reviews were accurate, and Anna really does all she can to make you feel at home.  I can't wait to go back to Seattle!"
6156470,55551542,2015-12-01,25268064,Samantha,Anna was an amazing host and of course Nala was wonderful too! My boyfriend and I were celebrating our anniversary and wanted to take a little stay-cation in the city and her place was wonderful! Literally within a quarter mile of every different kind of restaurant you could imagine but in a charming residential neighborhood. She even let me bake tons of goodies in her kitchen! I would recommend her to anyone who needs a nice get away on the city and have already told all of my friends!
6156470,56330872,2015-12-12,6741799,Ellen,"Anna is such a charming host. Her home is very comfortable, and she definitely went out of her way to make us feel welcome. We were in and out all week, seeing friends and catching up on our visit to Seattle and Anna's home was a perfect spot for us to roost!"
4862719,25115506,2015-01-06,5900394,Roxy,Chantel's rental provided a safe place to sleep with convenient access to my work.

The bed was comfortable.
The room was warm.

I did not use the common area or kitchen.
"
4862719,25579557,2015-01-19,26059192,Bernie,"I had a very nice stay. The bed was quite comfortable and the area nice and quiet at night. The house is located within walking distance from several restaurants, a coffee shop, and a great donut shop.
"
4862719,26581312,2015-02-15,27697100,Kacy,It was so easy to stay at Chantel's and the bed was super comfortable. Beat part was the fantastic neighborhood with great food nearby and Green lake park. A great stay overall!
4862719,26950547,2015-02-22,27565000,Angeline,"Lovely house in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood. My partner and I really enjoyed having cafes and the best donut shop within walking distance, and finding parking was easy at any time of day. The private entrance was perfect for coming in quietly during late hours. Our suite had convenient shelving and coat racks for belongings, and I appreciated the provided bathrobes! Chantel was even able to provide an iron and board when we needed one. The bathroom was well-stocked, clean, and had soaps and shampoo. We were well-provided for a cozy stay."
4862719,28110433,2015-03-17,3079625,Kristyn,Love this place so much I extended my stay. One of my favorite homes away from home. 
4862719,28292424,2015-03-21,29599298,Eric,Great experience! The place was very nice and in a great neighborhood. Chantel was very friendly and easy to work with. I'd recommend to anyone looking for a good place in Seattle close to downtown.

4862719,28725474,2015-03-29,28589166,Hannah,"I had a great stay at Chantel's. The neighborhood was quiet and pleasant, the space was cozy and accommodating, and I was able to navigate the city easily on foot or by bus from the apartment. I'll be back again, and I'll be sure to factor in enough time to explore out the impressive book collection!"
4862719,29196996,2015-04-05,26820981,Jennifer,"Our stay with Chantel was great. Our flight came in late, but it wasn't a problem to get into the house since there's a door code. Street parking is easy and the location is convenient to downtown. I would stay here again."
4862719,29758389,2015-04-12,6949782,Amy,"I spent the night after driving to University of Washington to see a dance performance. I met Chantel shortly after arriving in the afternoon. She was sweet. The suite was as described, and the bed was quite comfortable. 
The house is located close to a school, which on a weekend, made the neighborhood pretty quiet. 
The location was quite convenient for me, as I was able to exit and enter I-5 within blocks, but you would not know the highway was so close. 
Also, it was a quick ride to University of Washington, and an easy walk to Green Lake, for a leisurely walk around the lake. 
I would definitely stay there again if the opportunity arose. IT was a lovely neighborhood, and the suite had everything I needed, except for maybe larger mugs for serious coffee drinkers. ;-)"
4862719,30115925,2015-04-17,31221255,Brad,Great experience. Go for it.
4862719,30241535,2015-04-19,13505647,Jihae Susan,"Although I did not get to meet Chantel in person, she was very sweet and communicative leading up to the day I stayed at her listing. She made sure I had all the information I needed before, which I greatly appreciated. 

The listing comes with a shared kitchen, a shared bathroom, and of course your own private room. Everything was well maintained and very clean. The only weird thing I noticed when I walked in was that there was a weird musky smell, which didn't exist in the rest of the house, so it didn't bug me too much. 

I absolutely LOVED the neighborhood. It is safe, quirky, and unique, and has lots of food options in the area. The park was really nice to take a stroll in as well.

I definitely recommend staying here! "
4862719,30651938,2015-04-25,466499,Elizabeth,Comfortable bed and very clean room! It was exactly as described. Vey easy to come and go independently - although I did meet Chantel and she is delightful!
4862719,32042435,2015-05-12,11347446,Lucy,"I didn't get to meet Chantel but her response to email was quick and was very welcoming. The room was as described, and it is quiet and clean. Parking was easy to find (plenty of spot right in front of her house). She even provided robes. Easy access to I-5 and downtown and close to eateries and bus stop. Highly recommended. "
4862719,32211139,2015-05-15,25743496,Monika,"Chantel´s place is just awesome!!-and so is she! Chantel´s being  an artist the apartment we stayed in that provided everything you can think of to make your stay more than pleasant also shows wonderful pieces of her artwork.; you could see her artistic touch in every detail. My sister and I, a former art teacher, just loved the inspiring stay!! Chantel is such a warm, sensitive, open hearted person, a great host- and a place in a wonderful and  quiet neighborhood, even though close to the center. Thank you so much for your warm welcome and making our stay like feeling at home! "
4862719,32635563,2015-05-19,26059192,Bernie,"I've stayed here before. I often make trips to Seattle, and I really enjoy staying here. It's in wonderful neighborhood - particularly when you want to see some of the less-touristy parts of Seattle."
4862719,33111484,2015-05-25,16109599,Danny,"This great little guest suite has all the necessary amenities, in an awesome neighborhood 1 block from the 26 bus. Chantel was kind and timely in responding to anything we needed. Highly recommended!"
4862719,33533198,2015-05-29,18135278,Katie,"I had a lovely stay! Excellent location, wonderful communication, clean room, comfortable bed, great value. 

I highly recommend this listing! "
4862719,33801893,2015-06-01,21984339,Olga,"We met Chantel and her husband the evening of our arrival. They were sitting on the front porch with their dog.  It felt like any regular day in our own neighborhood sparking up  a chat with the neighbors. Chantel is charming and sincere.  I felt an instant trust.  
The fresh flowers on the kitchen counter and my name written in chalk on the fish plaque hanging from the door not only confirmed for me her anticipation of our arrival but made us feel very welcome. It was also really nice to see the other borders names on the other door (the common area is shared between two rooms that are let out) as they came and went.  Which, btw, Chantel ALWAYS informed us of in advance.  Very nice touch. "
4862719,33991772,2015-06-03,17273140,Christine,"My parents stayed at both of Chantel's listings, each for one night. They had a great time there. It was a comfortable room for two. While they were there, Chantel also had other guests staying in the other room. It wasn't a problem and my parents enjoyed the company. We didn't get a chance to meet Chantel but she was always reachable and provided easy and private access to the rooms. Chantel's house is within walking distance to Green Lake. My parents had pleasant walks around the lake in the mornings. Will definitely recommend other to stay here. "
4862719,34479920,2015-06-08,34029449,Yang,The bed is very comfortable and the kitchen is good for cooking yourself. Thanks to Chantel
4862719,34634419,2015-06-10,25295097,Camille,"A wonderful experience—friendly hosts who let you do your own thing, reliable internet connection, tranquil clean apartment in a gorgeous neighborhood!"
4862719,34737421,2015-06-11,30549255,Michael,"This was my first AirBnB stay and I was kinda anxious about it. Based on this experience I would eagerly do it again (and plan to). Chantel was very helpful and responsive before my visit, and made me feel very comfortable and welcome when I arrived. Thus place is great. Comfortable , convenient, with any amenity I could possibly have wanted. I'm very grateful. "
4862719,34895336,2015-06-13,23436920,Deborah,"The place was quiet, clean and worked out well for our quick trip to Seattle for a 1/2 marathon.  We would have loved to have more time to explore the area but this one was a quick turn around trip."
4862719,34959518,2015-06-14,4405690,Lisa,Very pleasant and quiet home in  quiet and peaceful neighborhood.  The bed was very comfortable!
4862719,35470198,2015-06-19,9010696,Justin,"Chantel was a gracious host and her space in Greenlake was fantastic. It's a great area, the amenities are numerous and generous, and it definitely enhanced my 5 day stay in Seattle. Highly recommended."
4862719,36024914,2015-06-24,33441045,Calin,"The room was perfect for our stay in Seattle, close enough to the city and the UW for everything that we needed to get done. The place itself was very charming, clean, and private.

Our host was very accommodating when we got in way before check in time, and was very nice to both my husband and I. You should stay there!"
4862719,36298472,2015-06-27,34326299,Blythe,Felt welcome...Great neighborhood and all the amenities you could need! Perfect little basement suite!
4862719,36426145,2015-06-28,13640426,Crystal,"Chantel's place was perfect to rest up after traveling all day.  Quiet, private and welcoming. Just what a needed for a stopover. Would definitely recommend!"
4862719,36699359,2015-06-30,739202,Erin,"I enjoyed my stay here. Great location (especially if you're vegan! Wayward, Vegan Haven, Pizza Pi, etc are all nearby) near the lake. Bed was comfy, place was clean, and while I didn't meet Chantel, communication was good. I would stay here again. "
4862719,36777789,2015-07-01,3132464,Liam & Leeanne,"The space is comfortable, clean and evidently well-cared for. We really enjoyed our short stay and hope to book in again soon! Excellent base from which to explore Greenlake and the University District. Chantel is lovely and welcoming. Thanks so much for a great stay!"
4862719,37025237,2015-07-03,36483702,Julie,"I arrived at about 5 pm and everything was prefect!  There was a lot of street parking and I was able to park right in front of the house! There was a lot more room in the bedroom than the pictures show!  Chantel answered all my questions right away.  The bathroom and common space was great!! 

I can't wait to visit again!!!  "
4862719,37257477,2015-07-05,4005215,Vania,"Chantel's place was great.  Clean and comfortable. The location was perfect for my weekend trip in Seattle. Before I checked out, I met Chantel. She's very nice. I would stay here again!"
4862719,38714538,2015-07-18,33433687,Sheldon,"Chantel is a wonderful host and I enjoyed my two week stay at her place. Everything was clean, and I had everything I needed (living-wise) provided to me, to ensure my stay was a great one. I had conference work that lasted throughout the day and into the night, however, this was of no issue to Chantel and Zack to ensure I was made to feel as at home and comfortable as possible. They were great and I would recommended this place to anyone I know who will be staying in Seattle!"
4862719,39509521,2015-07-24,35262534,Kim,It was nice place located in quiet neighborhood. I enjoyed staying there.
4862719,40112800,2015-07-28,31553962,Bret,A cozy and convenient stay in Seattle.   My wife an I enjoyed our stay and the speedy internet while we were visiting family over the weekend!
4862719,40478177,2015-07-31,21617627,Brooke,"Great location, clean, quiet, easy check-in and check-out!"
4862719,41436763,2015-08-07,1520664,Tracy,"Chantel was very communicative while booking as well as just before my stay when providing address, etc. I met her husband briefly and he was lovely. The home is in a very quiet neighborhood (plenty of street parking), code access to gain entry, and is a basic but very comfortable room. The bed was great, plenty of windows to open for fresh air, semi-private from the shared living room/kitchen with a screen and shelving just outside the door. The bathroom is clean and roomy with a great shower. "
4862719,41708815,2015-08-08,11235001,Stacy,"Listing description was exactly as stated and was perfect for my one-night stay.  Had what appeared to be a ""double-booking"" issue that turned out not be that and was cleared up immediately by Chantel's husband, Zak.  Zak was extremely friendly and quite helpful and a pleasure to interact with.  I had checked out early so that I could go on a bike ride and Zak had allowed me to return later in the afternoon to shower before heading on my way.  I'm familiar with the Greenlake area and found it a very convenient walk to the lake for dinner.  Overall, I was extremely pleased with the room and all of the amenities.  I will definitely stay here again when I return to the Seattle area for a short visit."
4862719,42267597,2015-08-12,33152369,Raven,"This place was great and comfortable!!! in a really nice part of town with easy access to downtown, the suite was really cute, well kept and worth the money! "
4862719,43228995,2015-08-18,20534814,Christi,Chantels home is always welcoming. It's my favorite place to stay when I visit Seattle.
4862719,43541879,2015-08-20,40172793,Dan,"You get what you pay for. Nicely set up basement suite with full kitchen, although everything but your bedroom is shared with whoever is in the second room. We had considerate, quiet temporary neighbours while we were there, and it was nice and cool even during a hot summer day. Nice neighbourhood and Chantel was very helpful - even let us use her printer at one point to print off tickets. Recommended. "
4862719,43881110,2015-08-22,454469,Emily,"I traveled to Seattle for work, and found Chanel's home convenient, cozy and clean. She greeted me immediately and showed me around the place.  I didn't realize it going in, but the rental included a great shared kitchen. It was all very inviting."
4862719,44076869,2015-08-23,3076979,Ila,"Chantel created a very clean and comfortable environment to stay at. We arrived at night, so a bit hard to see the numbers of the house and where to enter. A lighting system would have been helpful for recognizing the numbers on the house and seeing the code on the door a bit easier. I got B and 8 confused in the dark :-)
My mother and nephew stayed and suggested a railing on the wall to assist with getting down the stairs. Great warm neighborhood, easy access to many seattle park and dining experiences and comfortable environment. We would stay again - Thank you."
4862719,44208698,2015-08-24,5624023,Chrissy,"We had a great stay in the suite here.  The place was very clean, spacious and comfortable and was just what we needed.  It's really like a large hotel suite, we loved the privacy of it.  There were great shops and restaurants within walking distance, as well as the beautiful lake, and downtown was just a short Uber ride away.  

If you want a quiet escape in Seattle, close to parks and nature, this is the spot."
4862719,44790112,2015-08-29,5005760,Ron,"Nice room 
Close to Greenlake"
4862719,45072542,2015-08-31,15975725,Yimei,很好的房东，晚10点到达，房东还在等待，卧室不算大，但是厨房，客厅，卫生间一应具全，生活还是挺方便的。
4862719,45419325,2015-09-02,32680188,Paula,homie and comfy apartment in a basement. very cute neighborhood not too far from downtown and/or touristic places (space needle)
4862719,45544371,2015-09-03,1543338,Rhoda,"We made a very last minute decision to stay overnight at Chantel's.  She was quick to respond to our request and get us the information necessary for our stay.  The place is on a quiet street and nice neighborhood.  It was walking distance to our daughter's which was a big plus for us.  

There was another couple staying in the other room.  We were just there to sleep and didn't really interact with them.  They were quiet and did not disturb us at all.  We had a comfortable night's sleep which was exactly what we were looking for."
4862719,45715432,2015-09-05,6847162,Rodolfo,"Chantel is super friendly she greeted us and showed us to our room. The room is fairly quaint yet very comfortable. There is a nice common area, shared bathroom and kitchen. There are a lot of nice touches, some amenities such as towels and good reading material. This is a nice spot. Thanks Chantel!"
4862719,46002027,2015-09-07,41111687,Rionna,"The listing description was accurate. Chantel's place was clean and very comfortable with a full kitchen. We also made great friends with the house mates. The location was convenient for public transportation, too. "
4862719,46330902,2015-09-09,35252525,Tammy,"Chantel was wonderful. She was helpful and was really nice when I asked if I could come early and just park my car to uber downtown. Also, when I forgot to print my citypass, she helped me with that as well. The room was cozy and everything was supplied. It was a wonderful experience!"
4862719,47053778,2015-09-15,39553873,Kara,"I loved the place!! Very very nice, definitely would stay there again next time I'm in Seattle! I really enjoyed the chalk boards on the door saying our names on it. I had no issue with the other guests and actually never even met them. Definitely 100% better than staying at a hotel & is very clean! Also, the location is awesome. A few cafes are less than mile away and there is a nice park near by as well. :-) "
4862719,47682237,2015-09-21,3525676,Izabela,"Great, great, great. Chantel and Zac are lovely hosts, friendly, kind, respectful, and accommodating.  I found the suite cosy, clean, and comfortable. The kitchen is equipped if you prefer to fix your own meals and there is plenty of room to just chill out. It really isn't hard to feel at home there! The neighbourhood is quiet, with coffee shops and restaurants only a few minutes away, and the streets are lined up with charming houses. The Green Lake and the Woodland Park are also near, so get your running/walking shoes ready! I very much enjoyed my stay."
4862719,48392467,2015-09-26,14379389,Gary,I had a very pleasant 5 night stay here.  This is a quiet easily accessible neighborhood.  The accommodations were comfortable there is a nice kitchen to use and is well equipped. Chantel made us feel welcome. I would definitely stay here again. 
4862719,48735276,2015-09-28,8489487,Harrie,I very much enjoyed my stay at Chantel's residence. Beautiful area and nice neighborhood. Room was very clean and comfortable. bed was very comfortable.  coffee was excellent. 
4862719,48968557,2015-09-29,42543649,David,All was laid out perfect. The contact before was very on point and easy to access. Chantel marked all out and had everything laid out for me. Would stay again with out question 
4862719,50239936,2015-10-10,5653286,Michael,I had a great 2 night stay at this location. Booking was easy and Chantel was excellent with quick communication and providing helpful advice about the area. The room is private and as pictured with a shared common area with one other room. I rarely saw the other guests and space was not an issue. The location is in a beautiful area close to the lake and is very walkable. There is an excellent coffee shop and donut place nearby. Great value and had an excellent stay.
4862719,51863830,2015-10-24,27483614,Emily,"Wonderful little place to stay! Great location, quiet neighborhood, and kitchenette stocked with tea and coffee. I did not get to interact with Chantel becuase of a work event that went late and an early morning that followed, but I enjoyed sleeping in the comfy bed provided."
4862719,53421683,2015-11-08,48017052,Randolph,Great location for the U district and university area. The amenities provided were perfect. Everything you need for a short or prolonged stay.
4862719,54049277,2015-11-15,6949782,Amy,"This is the second time that I have stayed with Chantel so that I could go to University of Washington to see a dance performance and didn't have to drive 2 hours home afterward.

So I knew what to expect and it did not disappoint. I didn't want to bother Chantel, so I just came in and found I had a welcome message on the chalkboard on my door. I shared the suite with a lovely couple from Winthrop. 

The location is perfect for getting on and off I-5, and for getting to the University.  The bed is nice and comfortable, and the heat is plentiful on these cooler nights.

In my rush to drive down, I forgot to pack a book. Fortunately there are a couple bookcases in the suite with a variety of offerings. I learned lots about landscaping with stone, and learned a lot about human anatomy with the Anatomy coloring book. And for the two minutes before I fell asleep, I was amused by the first few sentences of ""Drink, Slay, Love"". 

I had a swell time!"
4862719,54551654,2015-11-21,42416808,Nicholas,"This was our first time staying at an air bnb and it was a great experience. We checked in quite late so we did not get to meet the host, but the directions were clear and the suite was lovely and clean. Would recommend for future guests. "
4862719,55251354,2015-11-29,25526676,Markus,"Chantel's house is located in a lovely neighborhood, some good bars and restaurants are right around the corner (definitely recommend the Elysian Tanglewood) and it takes about 20 minutes by bus to get downtown (and not even 10 if you have a car). 
Room and utilities were as described, the small kitchen works great if you do not want to eat out and also there is a toaster and coffee maker for breakfast. 
Chantel and Zach were quick to respond and helpful when we needed something, but otherwise respected our privacy. Definitely recommend their apartment. "
241032,682061,2011-11-01,479824,Bro,"Excellent all the way around. 

Maija was an excellent host and kindly invited me to movie night on my last evening in the apartment. 

The apartment's warm and modern design and furnishings cannot be fully appreciated with photos. I am a Seattle native and this part of Queen Anne is one of the best parts of the hill.The extremely private front porch/deck area hides behind a lush bamboo screen but a view of Elliott Bay and Puget Sound is three steps out into the welcoming yard. Very close to major transit lines and ample on-street parking for your vehicle makes traveling south into downtown (15 minutes, tops, to Pike Place Market by car, not much more by bus!!!) and traveling north across the historic Ship Canal into Ballard (which is far cooler than downtown Seattle) is almost instantaneous. 

If you want to live like a native, connected to the city and the sea, give Maija's space a week or two. "
241032,691712,2011-11-04,357699,Megan,"Maija's apartment was a wonderful place to stay! Extremely comfy and relaxing with a beautiful view. The location is very convenient and close to a lot of things to do, weather you have a car or are taking the bus around town. I would recommend anyone traveling, weather for business or pleasure, that this is a great spot with a great host! Thanks Maija!

Megan Johnson"
241032,702999,2011-11-08,1285567,Marylee,one of the most pleasant stays i've had in my travels. maija is a wonderful host!
241032,717262,2011-11-14,647857,Graham,"Maija's suite is beautiful, cozy and conveniently located. I love that armchair! One tip: when she offers you detailed directions: take them, especially if you're arriving after dark! ;)"
241032,730226,2011-11-19,1389821,Franka,Our stay was short and pleasant. With its own porch space the flat boosts a lot of privacy! Wish we could have made it in summer to barbecue. 
241032,739809,2011-11-23,620277,Robin,I had a wonderful 4 night stay in Maija's apartment. Her place is crisp and clean and in a fantastic location. Walking around the Queen Anne neighborhood each day showed the real charm of Seattle and I hope I have a chance to stay again!
241032,746462,2011-11-27,1261162,Mara,The apartment was really nice and homey. It was located  in a good area. Majia was very friendly. It was just right for our little family. We would love to stay there again on another visit to Seattle.
241032,755647,2011-11-30,719078,Kiran,I stayed at Maija's place for 3 days and had no problems with the house or the owner. One of my fren decided to join us at the last minute and Maija had no problems with the extra person. The house was pretty comfortable for us and was as described in the ad. We found parking near the house always and the location is great as its just a 15 min ride to downtown. I would be willing to stay at Maija's place again when visting Seattle. 
241032,764019,2011-12-05,693268,Tatyana,"I did booking for my sister, and she liked the place very much. It is conveniently located,  comfortable and private."
241032,773602,2011-12-09,1243196,Sal,"We were unintentionally poor guests; we broke the cork screw and stayed an extra day thinking that we had actually rented for 3 instead of 2 days. Maija was kind and cool and collected. Very nice apartment!
We would rent it again if she allowed us back...."
241032,784989,2011-12-14,482299,Christopher,"the apartment is spacious, comfortable, and very usable - nice simple decor. as walkers the location was perfect - but if required a bus stop was never far away. lower queen anne, ballard, and the fremont neighborhoods are all quite accessible. take the walk over queen anne hill via kerry park with its view of the city and down to the the waterfront art park and bell town."
241032,795862,2011-12-20,814238,Alison,"Maija was very welcoming to us. She showed us around the apartment and handed us the keys. We were on our own the rest of the stay. We basically just needed a place to stay for a friend's wedding, so we really did not stay at the apt the whole time, only to sleep. 
Everything was smooth. Found the place right away and it was about a 5-10 minute drive from her place to Pike's Place Market. There is a Whole Foods market and a Pete's Cafe down the hill from her. Definitely need a car.
If you are a light sleeper, don't know if the noise from the walking on the floors above, would bother you. You can pretty much hear everything.
Very nice stay and great price! Thanks Maija for hosting us!"
241032,815052,2011-12-30,1471446,Wilhemina,"We stayed in Maija's wonderful space for two days. Maija provided  detailed directions to the flat, as it can be difficult to find. Everything is as described, but better in person. The apartment itself is very private and clean, with ample free(!) street parking. The rooms are beautifully simple, with artful decor and an open layout. Noise was not an issue for us. The location is central and a close drive or decent walk to everything Seattle has to offer. We would love to stay there again in the future. "
241032,854486,2012-01-10,1382578,Sara,"My husband, mom and I thoroughly enjoyed our weekend stay at Maija's apartment. It was clean, peaceful and very comfortable. There was minimal noise from the footsteps upstairs, and you wouldn't know there is a busy road just down the hill. The location was a little difficult to find at first, but it didn't take long to sort out. The bed was more comfy than any swanky hotel room's and my mom was very comfortable on the fold-out futon in the living area -- with a nice, plush comforter and pillows provided. Our host even stocked hot tea to prepare with a kettle on the stove -- a very welcome treat as it was cold and damp outside that weekend. We are looking forward to staying there again on our next visit to Seattle!"
241032,860550,2012-01-13,1266005,Anne,"My husband and I stayed here for three nights and thoroughly enjoyed the  lovely space. The apartment is very functional"" private, quiet; good kitchen layout, comfortable bed, everything we needed. Had a small glitch with the internet connection but we were able to resolve it with Maija's help. Maija was good about responding to our questions, and flexible on our arrival and departure details. FYI, the location is slightly off the beaten track and requires climbing some stairs, so not so good if you don't have a car or have mobility challenges -- but for us it was perfect. Thank you Maija! "
241032,865460,2012-01-16,1509172,Jonathan,I was very comfortable at Maija's apartment.  A great overall experience and she really went out of her way to provide some good recommendations.
241032,890978,2012-01-30,335342,Diane,"This was a perfect spot for our stay! We needed access to the Arts Center and it was a beautiful walk along the scenic Highland Drive. We found the apartment charming, very comfortable and a perfect price!"
241032,911807,2012-02-10,1544991,James,We absolutely adored Maija and her lovely apartment!  It was the perfect spot to help us ease into the Seattle community upon our relocation to Seattle from N.Y. while waiting for our things to arrive... 
241032,932490,2012-02-20,751416,Erna,"Great apartment in Seattle, very comfortable. Maija was great and answered all of our questions. We did not have any problems and really enjoyed our stay. Parking is on street, but there were always spots available. The neighborhood felt very safe and we had no problems leaving our rental car out of sight even though we were a little paranoid since they gave us a much more expensive car than we had expected!


We had no trouble finding the place, and although it is not in the most walkable area it is pretty centrally located and there is a Whole Foods nearby for supplies. Although you can hear footsteps from above, it was not an issue for us at all and I tend to have sleep issues. Also a bonus: plenty of hot water! Nice, as is can get pretty chilly in Seattle, and there is only one heater in the apartment (and it took us a while to figure out we had to turn it wayyy up to get enough heat!) One reviewer did mention that this is not the place for you if you have mobility issues and I agree: the steps that lead to the apartment are wooden & with the rain can get slippery, and there is no railing. It's probably best for a couple if you want privacy since there is no door to the bedroom, just a curtain, and the bathroom is through the bedroom.


Overall we had a great stay here and would not hesitate to return.

241032,945726,2012-02-24,893874,Melanie,"Maija welcomed us warmly and provided lots of materials about Seattle. She was a very gracious host.

Maija's apartment was great -- everything was extremely clean and comfortable, and she had added a lot of decorative touches. Queen Anne was a great neighborhood, and it was a short drive to downtown Seattle. There was plenty of street parking.

"
241032,1096041,2012-04-08,1487451,Lynne,It was great! Maija is an incredible host. We and our kids stayed there and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Was maybe a two minute walk to the bus stop (if that) and everything was just as Maija describes it.  We have recommended her place to family we have that live in the area for when they have company from out of town that they don't have room for. We would stay there again if in the area.
241032,1313496,2012-05-21,1600460,Ausrine,"Es ist ein sehr gemütliches und schönes Appartement mit einer besonderen Atmosphäre - ich blieb dort 6 Wochen und fühlte mich sofort wie Zuhause. Es ist minimalistisch und geschmackvoll eingerichtet, mit sehr schöner eigenen Terrasse, es hat alles was man zum Leben braucht, und Maija ist eine sehr nette und hilfsbereite Gastgeberin. Es ist relativ nahe am Zentrum - zu Fuss (sehr schöne Aussichten unterwegs) zwischen 35 und 60 Minuten - kommt drauf  an, wohin man will;), aber es gibt auch gute Busverbindung. Durch eine sehr schöne Lage - auf der Hügel, von Grünem umgeben und mit dem Blick aufs Golfplatz - hat man das Gefühl, das man  nicht wirklich in der Stadt ist. "
241032,1380839,2012-05-30,209246,Meg & Josh,"My husband and I visited Seattle for a conference and had a great time staying at Maija's flat. The apartment has got a great vibe and she's stocked it with all the trappings to make cooking, sightseeing and snoozing a breeze. We had easy access (via rental car) to downtown and Maija offered some good tips for local restaurants, shopping, hiking and live music. And, while staying in her quiet neighborhood with a view of the golf course from the patio and Whole Foods just down the street, we felt right at home during our stay!"
241032,1431692,2012-06-07,2115606,Liz,"My college age daughter and I spent a week in Maija's apartment. Although it's the bottom of the house, kind of a daylight basement, there was enough light and a lovely view on the back porch into vegetation and the garden and a farther view to the driving range at Interbay.  It worked perfectly for us and we slept well on the queen size bed (me) and the futon bed (daughter.) Loved the spacious kitchen. The garden is lovely and the apartment is quiet and cozy. Parking is very scarce in the evening on the street but because of the oddity of that part of Queen Anne, you can usually find parking on the upper level of the street and just come back down via stairs in the middle of the block. Maija is a welcoming, easygoing accommodating  host and made us feel instantly at home. At the same time, we had all the privacy we needed."
241032,1506643,2012-06-18,1555983,Sheri,"Maija's apartment was comfortable and spacious. Very comfy bed. All the essentials in kitchen and bath. Very clean. Great internet. Good privacy. Very convenient location. Charming side entry garden area that leads to the basement apartment. 
Our college age daughter was able to stay with us a couple nights on the futon couch in the living area.  Maija was delightful. We appreciated her quick responds to pre -arrival communications and her ready availability the day of check in. "
241032,1564625,2012-06-26,1686671,Lee Ann,Great apartment conveniently located.  We really enjoyed the garden setting.  Maija has nicely appointed the apartment with everything from laundry detergent to travel brochures to condiments in the kitchen.  It was a very peaceful place to return to after a long day of sight-seeing.  The parking was a little dicey but we did learn how to parallel park on the left side of the road!
241032,1581750,2012-06-28,2498189,Jacqueline,"Very nice, clean, comfortable and convenient. Ideal for a couple, but room for one more if needed. Maija was very helpful and accomodating. "
241032,1648503,2012-07-07,115213,Brian,"This worked out quite nicely for our family. The location was convenient via car to both downtown and Ballard.  The bed was very comfortable, the futon worked nicely for our kids and the bathroom, while small, was nice with a good shower.  The kitchen was also quite usable and nice.  Laundry facilities were available with little hassle.  

The floor is a bit thin, so if you are hypersensitive about noise (which we are not), the occassional walking of the people above might be a detraction.  Host was readily accessible via email during our stay and helped us figure out the wifi access."
241032,1675305,2012-07-10,2357343,Pat,It was great to have our own apartment while in Seattle. Apartment was clean had cable tv and internet access.  Maija was a friendly host that welcomed us and then left us alone.  She was available to us if we had questions about sites.  Her beautiful cat came the next day to greet us and check out who was in her garden apartment. We would recommend this apartment and host to anyone seeking lodging while in the Seattle area.  Public bus service was down the street from this apartment.  Whole Foods within walking distance and golf course across the street. House hard to find because front or entrance to house is on 14th Street.
241032,1805923,2012-07-26,2798556,Steven,"Just as advertised. Stylish, comfortable, with privacy and conveniently located within easy walking distance to cafes, Whole Foods, etc. Clean, neat, utilitarian. Low ceiling beam to be aware of for those over 6' 3"" but worth the price of admission. Very economical given location and amenities. Maija makes it easy to locate, move in and feel completely at home without being intrusive. I'll be back."
241032,1847987,2012-07-31,2295014,Michelle,"Great location, short drive to everything!  Our stay was very comfortable this place had everything we needed, so nice to have the comforts of home.  The host was very reachable when we needed something.  I highly recommend this place!"
241032,1921849,2012-08-08,1992136,Felicia And Matt,"The patio view faces the sunset and is beautiful, great garden patio, the grill is a great touch.  It's right on the bus line.  Comfortable bed.  If you're a tv fan, this place has a LOT of channels!  Maija responded quickly to any questions or concerns and you get a lot of privacy.  Located in a great neighborhood very close to downtown and Seattle Center."
241032,2027601,2012-08-19,2021200,David,"We were here for only two nights and out most of the day between, but we found the apartment to be exactly what it looked like in the photos and exactly what we were looking for:  a cool, contemporary, sparsely but tastefully decorated and furnished retreat from the demands of our kids and their kids (love them as we do).  We were very comfortable.  Maija is a charming young woman who was very helpful in accommodating our arrival needs and our other questions.  We loved this place and would recommend it to our friends.     "
241032,2120859,2012-08-28,1715760,Veronica,"Loved our stay there, everything so clean and a beautiful scenery, Majia was very welcoming and made sure we were at comfort. thanks so much, what a cozy place."
241032,2221139,2012-09-07,532819,Heather,"What a fantastic space to call home-base while visiting Seattle. Great location, Maija was a pleasure and the space was perfect- just like in the pictures, mid-century mod and the bed was soooo comfortable! We had our privacy but Maija responded right away when we had questions. Easy to park on the street out front and such a perfect example of the pleasures of Seattle living. We were even able to host a little dinner barbeque on the patio in front of the space. I will definitely be back if I can! "
241032,2249127,2012-09-10,169520,Jan,"It was a lovely, very comfortable apartment with a nice outside porch and total privacy.  Maija was very accomodating as I wanted to invite our niece to stay with us on the second night.  We didn't use the kitchen, but it was fully equipped and we could have cooked a dinner there had we wanted to.  I highly recommend it.  Only downside would be if someone needed a railing to go down the back stairs..  There isn't one.  "
241032,2357473,2012-09-20,1993670,Garrett,Great space.  Great location.  Easy to get to and easy to get around.  Will definitely be my first choice next time I'm in Seattle.
241032,2407774,2012-09-25,958813,Laura,"Stylish, comfortable space, convenient location, and a friendly, easy going host made this a great home base for our Seattle adventures. We appreciated the laundry facilities and good water pressure in the shower, too. The garden space was lovely to walk through as we came and went, and we felt quite at home in no time. No hesitation in recommending Maija's place!"
241032,2724638,2012-10-26,786142,Carter,"This is a very cool spot, spacious, well appointed and private and truly my new favorite Airbnb place in Seattle.  Maija communicates well and is a conscientious host.  Certainly a place I would recommend. "
241032,2771972,2012-10-31,1407685,Kristal,"Thanks for a really comfortable stay in Queen Anne! Though that hill can be a pain to climb if you're taking the bus, it was worth the stay in the apartment. The bed and futon couch were extremely comfortable. It was like sleeping on a cloud. It's close to public transit to Downtown and Fremont. A ten minute walk to a yummy burger place called Red Mill, a Starbucks and a QFC Grocery Store (CA Residents: Ralphs!) One of my favorite things about the apartment was hearing the rain outside on the garden. The light switch in the bathroom was a little tricky but I think Maija had an electrician coming in the day we left to poke around. Thanks again for a great time in Seattle!"
241032,2827765,2012-11-07,2529102,Daniel,Maija's apartment was in a great location to spend the weekend in Seattle. The apartment was clean and had more than enough room for two. Maija was prompt in her responses and gave great directions. I would stay here again.
241032,2866749,2012-11-12,3948941,Katie,"We had a beautiful time in Seattle, walked Everywhere and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The place is clean, elegant, welcoming and very well equipped for four. Maija, while we never met her in person, due to our taking in of the town was a communicative and gracious host.
We'll be back!"
241032,2906274,2012-11-18,3750904,Alexandria,"For my first stay in Seattle, Maija's apartment was wonderful!  It was shared between a friend and I, and it was private, quiet, and a nice resting spot to come home to after sightseeing all day.  The apartment made me feel like a local, and the neighborhood was lovely.

It was close to public transportation and very easy to navigate to and from downtown and other neighborhoods.  Maija was easy to get into contact with and a pleasant person to deal with.  I would recommend this apartment to anyone looking to stay in Seattle."
241032,2931363,2012-11-20,4095250,Yuri,"The one bedroom apartment was clean with central heating already started for us. It was warm and very inviting with a nice nightlight view from the private veranda. We enjoyed making breakfast in the cozy kitchen before we started our day. It was initially a bit difficult to find the place but we had great communication with our host. We rented a car to get around. Street parking was tight but we didn't have any trouble finding a spot and parking was free! 

We would definitely book with Maija again!!  "
241032,2979859,2012-11-27,3924979,Kathleen,My family and I stayed at Maija's for a week over Thanksgiving. We had a great time. Maija was always prompt in replying to any inquiry we had. She gave great directions to find her place. The apartment was homey. The location was convenient to downtown Seattle. We'll stay there again. 
241032,3016859,2012-12-03,2845205,Amelia,"My husband and I had a great stay at Maija's. The apartment is very clean, comfortable, and attractive. The suite is very private, and has it's own little patio, which would be lovely in the summer. Maija was very communicative and friendly. Some minor drawbacks include: the suite has very low ceilings, which might be a problem for tall people; it might be a challenge to stay there without a car, as it was a 10 min. drive to downtown and not very close to a commercial area. That being said, we would definitely stay at Maija's again."
241032,3049602,2012-12-09,1406172,Elizabeth,"Maija's apartment was clean and peaceful. It's very convenient to public transportation. Whole Foods is a short walk nearby, although there are no restaurants within easy walking distance. Maija made the whole process very easy. I would definitely recommend her place to others."
241032,3078510,2012-12-12,4234665,Cialin,"Sweet, clean, pleasant and well-appointed apt. Close to public transportation to downtown, nice outside porch. Great experience overall! Would definitely stay there again, and recommend to others."
241032,3098784,2012-12-16,4331818,Trent,"It was a fantastic place to stay, really quiet and close to everything downtown.  We would stay here again in a heart beat.  Majia was very helpful with everything.  The place was very spacious and had everything that someone would need.  First time as airbnb user, it was awesome.  Got more than I expected."
241032,3140674,2012-12-23,2378826,Frank,"Lovely , well appointed space. I liked the style...the comfort and the well thought out furnishings etc.. I recommend this site."
241032,3483214,2013-02-05,4385857,Cindy,"Maija is very friendly and we had a lovely time staying at this apartment! The location is secretly tucked in the back in a very quiet neighborhood that is literally 5-10 minutes away from the Seattle Center, Downtown Seattle, Ballard, Fremont, Capitol Hill, etc. This apartment was very clean and spacious, and the furnishings were carefully laid out that provided an enjoyable experience. 

Things to note: 
- Very low ceilings and I'm five feet tall so this suite will definitely be a problem for tall people. 
- Parking was easy unless you're coming back home after 10pm where you might only have to walk for a minute or two to the apartment. I can't complain too much since it's free parking!
- Toilet needs to be flushed twice, no matter if it was your light or heavy load.

Overall, great stay and I would consider renting this place again in the future! Thanks Majia!"
241032,3601330,2013-02-22,4690089,David,We had an excellent time at Maija's apartment...a wonderful quiet place in a great location.
241032,3621870,2013-02-26,2484880,John,We enjoyed a comfortable 2 nights in Maija's apartment. Thank you Maija for your helpful travel instructions to locate the property and also for useful   tips on how to enjoy an interesting area of Seattle. We had convenient free street  parking and the location was an easy drive to downtown Seattle. Very private and quiet with a comfortable bed and good kitchen facilities. We would love to return to enjoy the patio and private garden  when the Summer weather arrives!
241032,3636776,2013-02-26,5095845,Tina,"Stayed here with our two small kids.  Loved the location, clean safe space."
241032,3684491,2013-03-04,4743978,Sreeram,"It was a pleasant stay at Maija's apartment. The apartment was neat, beautiful and private. "
241032,3718996,2013-03-07,2076020,Gilles,"Maija's place is really nice and spacious. 
It's basically a separate 1 bed flat underneath here own house (not in a basement as it's build on a hill) with kitchen, living space and you can use the washing/drying machines, which is very convenient.
The area is an affluent residential area and there're relatively good connections into town and other nice areas like Ballard.
Maija is very nice and interaction is smooth. I'd recommend this place to everyone and this is really good value."
241032,3788450,2013-03-15,4918956,Brian,"I had an excellent experience in Seattle. This was my first time using airbnb, and I couldn't be happier. For half the price of a hotel, I got my own apartment. It's cute, well-maintained, and clean. The host was unobtrusive and helpful. The location is a little hike from amenities, with restaurants a mile or so up the hill, and the grocery about a half mile down the road, but it's doable. The apartment has low-ish ceilings, so if you're super tall this may not be the place for you. Stoked on my experience. I'd definitely stay here again."
241032,4016851,2013-04-02,367748,Joseph,"She responded so quickly to almost every email and text message, was very courteous and kind.  The Apartment was just great and, although a bit confusing to find, was a perfect city hideaway, complete with a bamboo grove out the front windows."
241032,4150451,2013-04-14,3794701,James,"Maija's apartment in Queen Anne is a very serene place to live in. I was pleasantly surprised that it is tucked in a very safe and quiet neighborhood. Maija provided very succinct details on how to get to her place and was very friendly and respecting of my privacy through my entire stay.

The entire apartment is clean and tidy, the kitchen is ample with utensils, the bedroom is just downright comfortable. There was a few mornings when I had trouble waking up because it was as comfy as a hotel bed!

Thank you Maija for the great Airbnb experience! I recommend staying at her place if you're looking for a no hassle stay!"
241032,4323254,2013-04-28,5235716,Murielle,Lovely place but very noisy in the evening. Not to recommend to people who do not want their sleep to be affected.
241032,4405531,2013-05-03,393003,Jami,"We loved our stay!  Great location - very easy to get around all the different neighborhoods of Seattle. The place was perfect for us- very comfortable and clean, close to Trader Joe's/Whole Foods and full kitchen to stock everything. If you have your own car - you can find a parking spot relatively close by (if not directly in front) which is excellent for Seattle.  Last but not least, Maija was a gracious and accommodating host.  We highly recommend her place!"
241032,4501958,2013-05-09,4889479,Karen,"My husband and I had a pleasant stay at Maija's place. She was a gracious host. Her place is quaint and clean.  It was conveniently located (Trader Joe's, Whole Foods Market, Starbucks, Pike's Place, and downtown). 

Aloha from Hawaii      May 2013"
241032,4554817,2013-05-12,1489535,Joan,I really enjoyed staying at Maija's apartment. The bed was really comfortable and there was also a comfortable sofa bed. The location was very convenient and street parking was not too difficult. Maija was a great host and made us feel welcome. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again when I come back to Seattle
241032,4638845,2013-05-17,5893732,Shannon,This apt is so well kept and beautiful and in such a perfect location!!!!  It's quiet and secluded and the kitchen is well equipped.  What a perfect place to stay
241032,4760565,2013-05-24,1675806,Brandy,Very comfy and spacious. Maija was very quick to respond. Apartment was well appointed. Nice towels and there was always street parking available close to the house. You can hear a lot of road noise./traffic so that may bother you if you are not used to it. Other than that everything was great and I would stay here again. 
241032,4825981,2013-05-28,1614379,Charlene,"the apartment was great and provided perfect accommodations
for our needs.  the only comment as an improvement to
make it more comfortable/safe/secure feeling is to have window
coverings that completely block out seeing into the space.  neither my travel partner and I are comfortable with close next door living quarters being able to have full view into our  'living' space.  also, hard to sleep past daybreak with morning light not blocked out fully. 
love the look of bamboo reed coverings, just not the coverage they provide on their own.  other than that, the communication was great, we were left to our own devices (like),  the space was exactly as offered, street parking was available easily. would love to stay here again when in seattle.   thanks maija!"
241032,5032801,2013-06-09,2538713,Elyse & Jonathan,"Very cute place in great location, our stay could not have been better!"
241032,5114547,2013-06-13,1999991,Margarita,"Very nice place to stay, optimal location. I don't think there are better deals for staying in Seattle!
"
241032,5149313,2013-06-15,3341233,Pam,"Maija's apartment was spacious and very nice.  Had a little trouble initially finding her home and parking but generally all was very convenient and very pleasant.  We only saw her on that first day of two days/nights.  Would have liked to thank her in person that last day but instead, emailed our thanks.  Would recommend Maija to friends who are traveling to Seattle."
241032,5290529,2013-06-23,5325505,Donna,"The place had everything we needed for our visit. It was a clean, comfortable little apartment. Maija was quick to reply, she was really sweet and professional to work with. We would love to rent again next time we are in Seattle! Thanks! Donna and Clint Schnecksville PA"
241032,5383904,2013-06-27,1135213,Jessica,"The apartment is a walk out basement unit that is very clean and super cozy! It's a little hard to find at first, but once you do, it's smooth sailing. The bed was comfortable and street parking was easy to find in our rental car. "
241032,5563729,2013-07-06,3076881,Dorothy,"Majia""s place was perfect for us.  The apartment was spotless, roomy and very comfortable. We enjoyed the sunny deck in the late afternoons.  Maija was very accommodating and responded promptly when I called or texted her with questions.  This is definitely the first place I will look for the next trip to Seattle. We had a wonderful time there!  We didn't want to leave!  Great location and very private.  "
241032,5643134,2013-07-09,3300723,Eric,Great value and interesting digs in a quiet and cute Seattle neighborhood.  My wife Nancy and I recommend this place for anyone.
241032,5822929,2013-07-18,5606005,Martina,"Great location for acclimatization the first two days in the US. Parking in front of the house. Separate private entrance, we met Maija only at our arrival. Well equiped appartment.
Closed to Queen Anne restaurants and shops.

"
241032,6022574,2013-07-27,5153064,David,Everything could not have been easier! The apartment was clean and comfortable - and a great central location. Definitely glad we stayed in the apartment rather than a hotel.
241032,6133736,2013-07-31,7207966,John,Wonderful space in a convenient location.  Maija was very accommodating of our schedule and our kids.  A super experience all the way around.  THANKS!!!!
241032,6220538,2013-08-04,4063813,Jessie,"We had a very pleasant experience! The apartment was clean, tidy and had everything we could have required during our stay. We only got to meet/speak with Maija in passing, but she was lovely and a very accommodating hostess! I'd definitely stay here again if I were to return to the area. Thanks, Maija! "
241032,6385881,2013-08-11,3893702,Juliet,"We stayed with Maija for a week, and the suite was wonderful-- we spent many happy hours sitting on the porch/terrace admiring the landscaping and just relaxing. The suite was very clean, and well supplied with linens, towels, dishes, etc. (with one exception-- would have loved a toaster!). We saw Maija mostly in passing, as she was gardening or coming in or out, but she was very prompt with returning any texts or emails and answering our questions. Would certainly recommend her suite to anyone who wants to spend some time in Seattle-- the location is excellent and you can be downtown very quickly, as it's close to a major road-- the downside of that is some traffic noise, but it quiets down at night. We were very happy with our time there and would definitely return. Thanks Maija!"
241032,6464866,2013-08-13,2556969,Georgia,"Maija's lovely apartment was a wonderful sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of Seattle.  It was truly amazing to return home each day to such a relaxing environment, particular at sunset when we were able to take in stunning pink and orange skies from her cozy porch facing the water. "
241032,6914098,2013-08-30,4418610,Kevin,Maija was a great host with a cool spot in Queen Anne.  We really enjoyed our stay there.
241032,7157257,2013-09-09,4018453,Gabe And Magen,"We had a great stay at Maija's apartment.  The apartment was very clean and well appointed.  Being its own self-contained space it felt just as private as having our own hotel room or apartment.  Having the kitchen available was a great way to save some money on eating out as well.  Concerning others' comments about the reed window blinds not offering enough privacy, there are accordion-style window shades hung behind the reed blinds which you can lower for complete privacy. Maija was very helpful and responsive to any questions we had.  Being a lifelong resident of Seattle she was a great resource for questions we had about the town itself.  We wouldn't hesitate to stay with her again.  Overall, it was a great experience and just what we needed for our trip."
241032,8158380,2013-10-18,9215895,Ben,"Our family had a wonderful time in Maija's Queen Anne apartment.  The room was clean and exactly as pictured.  The neighborhood was quiet and it was an easy 20-30 minute bus/walk to downtown.

We would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone planning a Seattle visit.  "
241032,8260680,2013-10-22,696587,Nancy,Maija's apartment is on the ground floor of her house with a separate entrance through a garden.  It's clean and simple and tasteful and comfortable.  The kitchen is very usable and spacious.  Don't miss walking up the hill for coffee and goodies at one of the cafés... A good climb through a beautiful neighborhood.
241032,8415096,2013-10-29,9349617,Ryan,"The place was perfect for a couple to spend the weekend in Seattle! It was quiet, spacious, comfortable and affordable. And the view was SICK!!. Maija was a great host to us from the beginning. Our flight didn't land in Seattle until around 11PM and she stayed up all night waiting for us to arrive. And when we did, she greeted us at the door. She was very responsive to any text/messages I sent and was very polite and respectful. My girlfriend and i had a fantastic stay and we would do it again in a heartbeat! Thank you so much Maija!"
241032,8491165,2013-11-02,7272647,Laura,"The place was nicely located right off a central avenue and in a great neighborhood. Maija was very accommodating to our travel schedule which was a great help. The streets are a little tough to navigate (but that's all of Seattle) and parking can be tight (especially in the evening) but it usually works out alright. 

It's a great place especially if you're on a budget as it has a bed and a futon as well as a nice little kitchen. "
241032,8993283,2013-12-01,8684565,Adrianne,"We recently moved to Seattle and stayed in Maija's apartment while we searched for a perm place to live. From start to finish our stay couldn't have been better. The apartment was very comfortable for the two of us. It was beautifully decorated and nicely appointed. Internet was super fast and reliable, cleaning supplies/linens were always stocked, and the laundry room was very convenient. Also parking was no problem at all - on the rare days when we couldn't find a spot right in front of the house, we didn't have to go far for another. 
The neighborhood was perfectly positioned - close the the D bus, which will get you to many neighborhoods: Downtown, Lower Queen Anne, Fremont, Ballard...You can also hike up the hill to the boutiques, restaurants and coffee shops of Upper Queen Anne, taking in the beautiful houses and gardens along the way. Maija was super nice, laid back and responsive throughout our stay. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it! "
241032,9075392,2013-12-04,3570196,Rebecca,This was a really lovely apartment to stay in while in Seattle! 
241032,9163636,2013-12-10,1770720,Kevin,This place was fantastic for me and 3 friends who went to Seattle for vacation (me to see Pearl Jam close out their tour). We had absolutely no complaints and communication with Maija was wonderful. Location is Perfect for getting around Seattle. We took advantage of the BBQ grill even though it was cold out. A top notch vacation rental experience.
241032,9188231,2013-12-11,10475510,Teresa,A delightful little place. Cute and quirky but everything you need. Careful if you are a very tall person as the ceiling is low in some places. 
241032,9227654,2013-12-15,9431557,Jeannette,"Maija's space is lovely, clean, peaceful and private. We particularly enjoyed the sense of calmness permeating the space. The bed was comfortable, as were the pillows, and we liked the spaciousness of the apartment. We hope to return in warmer weather! Only quirk we encountered was a somewhat temperamental toilet, but it was no big deal. And, although the address is on Gilman, the door seems to be on14th, which took some getting used to. We enjoyed walking up the hill (take the stairs whenever possible!) to Macrina Bakery at the top of Queen Anne."
241032,9274223,2013-12-17,3390621,Kyle,"Maija was a great host, answered questions promptly and the accommodations were very comfortable."
241032,9310956,2013-12-20,6130817,Rachael,"Maija's apartment was such a treat to stay in. Not only did it have all the comforts of home, but it also had the most delightful details that really made me want to stay in rather than go out! Queen Anne is such a great neighbourhood, and Maija is located perfectly for strolls around the hill. I would recommend you stay here if you want to enjoy the neighbourhood and have a cosy, private and beautiful space to stay in during your stay in Seattle. Thanks Maija!"
241032,9404839,2013-12-27,9671519,Claudia,I highly recommend Maija's place. It was quiet and private. I was surprise with her attention to detail. She has little things in the apartment that just makes you feel at home. I stayed for a week and was able to run to the gym in the morning and walk to the grocery store. The neighborhood is safe and quiet. I would definitely stay there again on my next trip to Seattle. 
241032,9497344,2013-12-31,1212587,Owen,"My wife and I really enjoyed our time at Maija's place. Super comfortable place to relax. In terms of location, if you come by car, you can't beat it. Five to ten minute drive to downtown, five minutes to Ballard, absolutely a convenient place. Great restaurants very nearby in Ballard. Saved a bit of money by taking out and eating at home which was awesome. Maija was super friendly and knowledgeable about the neighbour. Thank you Maija! We will be back again! "
241032,9534245,2014-01-01,6623,Gina & Jeremy,"We loved our stay at this apartment! Maija was friendly, quick to get back to us, clear with directions and information and very accommodating. The apartment itself was stylish, a great size for two people, clean and adorable overall. The neighborhood is cute and tucked away from loud city life but within walking distance of stores and cafes. We also loved the bamboo surrounding the patio and enjoyed eating breakfast among it. We will definitely stay again when we are in the Seattle area! "
241032,11268457,2014-03-27,5873316,Mike,"Maija has a great little apartment. We had all the comforts we were hoping for, including everything we needed to prepare light meals. We planned this as a really touristy trip, committing our budget to entrance fees, etc, so being able to make breakfast and dinner was perfect. There is a QFC grocery store close by. We really enjoyed sitting on the covered porch with a beer in hand after walking miles around the city. Although we didn't take advantage, you can catch public transit pretty easily from here. We really appreciated the location as being right between Ballard and downtown, making day trips in any direction really convenient. Also, she has fun stencils for drawing and a ""Finding Nemo"" dvd. Rad."
241032,11466198,2014-04-04,4996921,Jennifer,"Staying in Maija's apartment was amazing. She had all of the amenities a person could dream of - laundry, a closet with hangers, towels, extra linens - you can tell she put a lot of thought in putting together the space. We ended up cooking a lot and this apartment had a wonderfully stocked kitchen. It's a bit far away from restaurants and downtown, but Seattle is a gorgeous place to walk around and we had a great time hunting around for places in nearby Ballard, Fremont, and Capitol Hill!"
241032,11526261,2014-04-06,13795607,Devin,"This is a beautiful apartment in a cute part of town. It's close to the arty Fremont District (cool statues, Theo chocolate factory), has some of it's own fantastic restaurants, and even houses a wonderful distillery worth checking out (Sound Spirits). The bed is remarkably comfortable, plenty of space, and a gorgeous garden if you're there during the day. The one caveat is this is a part of town with twisty streets and limited parking, so be aware it may take a moment to find a place to leave your car. Definitely keeping this place in my back pocket for my next trip."
241032,11621132,2014-04-09,13137987,Martha,"What a wonderful experience.  Maija has a very beautiful place. It was exactly as she described.  All our needs were met .  It was very private and peaceful.  This will be our home away from home in Seattle and we will recommend the place to our friends traveling to Seattle.  Thank you so much Maija!





"
241032,11867126,2014-04-17,2226049,Kerry-Ann,"I had such a wonderful stay at Maija's place--the perfect sanctuary to unwind after a long day. The property is absolutely beautiful, and the apartment is appointed with everything to create a feeling of a true home away from home. The kitchen is well equipped, so having the option to cook at home was an added bonus. Maija was prompt in responding to any inquiries I had also.
The house is within close proximity to public transportation, but be prepared for a bit of a hike up and down the hill in order to get to and from the bus station.
I would most definitely stay here again on my next trip to Seattle!"
241032,12067554,2014-04-22,12965724,Nuria,"This apartment is lovely, clean and cozy. Maija has decorated it with a very nice style. It is very lose to a stop of the D bus, which will get you to Downtown in 15 min. My husband and I had a great time there. We even were able to cook a romantic dinner because the kitchen is fully-equipped. We would definitely recommend this place. Thanks Maija!

Este apartamento es muy bonito, limpio y acogedor. Uno se siente en casa enseguida! Además, Está cerca de una parada de la línia de bus D que te lleva en unos 15 minutos al centro de Seattle. Lo pasamos muy bien. Gracias Maija!"
241032,12413945,2014-05-01,6955783,Tile & Freddie,"Maija and her apartment were absolutely wonderful! The photos on AirBnB don't do the place justice! I wish we had more time to stay and chat, but she was a wonderful host - welcome at our Brooklyn home anytime. 

If you're looking for a quiet and beautiful place to stay in Seattle, I would definitely recommend Maija's apartment! "
241032,12568580,2014-05-05,3570275,Liza,"Maija's place was perfect for our trip! Far enough from the hustle and bustle of the city, but close enough to get there in no time. We actually went back to the apartment in the middle of the day each day (rented a car) to take a break from exploring. We were basically 15 mins or less from everywhere! The apartment itself was very spacious, had a cute set-up, and a cozy feel to it. There's also a cool patio area designated for the space that overlooks the garden. Maija was really friendly (not to mention very accomodating - our flight was delayed over 3 hours, arriving to her place at 2am!) and responded promptly. I would definitely stay here again!"
241032,12705764,2014-05-08,3137758,Kelly,"We had a wonderful experience.  We had to reserve this apt in a hurry due to a family emergency and Maija was very accommodating.  Unfortunately, we didn't get to meet Maija, but she was always responsive via text or email.  The apt. is very cozy and spacious.  We liked that it had a full kitchen.  We had a car and parking was not a problem.  All in all, we would definitely reserve again!"
241032,13030958,2014-05-18,5480561,JeeYeun,"This is a lovely sweet place. There's no privacy in the place - there are no doors that close between the bedroom and the living area. But if you don't need that, the common area is spacious for a small apartment, the kitchen has everything you need, the porch is lovely, and there's even a grill for BBQ if you want. Maija was very accommodating. "
241032,13320554,2014-05-25,13414664,Greta,"The best of what AirBnB has to offer. Our host was easy-going and the place was perfect. Top notch, hassle-free lodging. "
241032,13509879,2014-05-29,14418022,Catherine,"This was a wonderful apartment! It was very true to the photos and very comfortable. Maija did a great job setting up a place that has all the comforts of home. Even the little amenities like umbrellas and curling iron were nice touches! The kitchen is fully furnished, this is wifi, cable TV, and the outside ambiance (patio/garden) is lovely. The apartment is a short walk (less than 10 min) from a Whole Foods and several bus stops. It's a quiet neighborhood with awesome scenery (even a strawberry patch). Maija was communicative throughout the entire process, easy to work with, and was even available for our late night arrival. I absolutely loved this stay and would come back again. Thanks, Maija!"
241032,15206913,2014-07-05,9920164,Willem,"Our journey by plane went not as planned, which led to different arrival and in meeting Maija later in te week. She is a friendly person. The neighbourhood is residential and very nice. Seattle is a true discovery. Vibrant. Great restaurants and super coffee and more. The apartment is spacious, compleet and clean. Price/quality OK"
241032,15401488,2014-07-08,12882826,Amy,"Wonderful, spotless, spacious apartment. Loved the outdoor sitting area. Would highly recommend it."
241032,15627063,2014-07-13,15329096,G,A great place to stay.  The apartment had a great feel to it and was very comfortable.  Furnishings were elegant and the futon was comfortable.  Very well equipped kitchen.
241032,15864972,2014-07-17,14630738,Nicole,We had a fantastic stay in Seattle at Maija's lovely place. Really well situated for what we wanted to see and do - my only negative (which was our fault) was we only got up to the little shopping area a few blocks up on our last afternoon and just wished we had gone up there earlier in our stay. Thanks Maija for all your help and certainly would come back and stay if we ever return to Seattle.
241032,16078316,2014-07-22,14295312,Hilary,"We couldn't have asked for a better experience at Maija's apartment. It was clean, comfortable, and had everything we needed. She was very accommodating to our travel plans (we were delayed nearly a day in our arrival, and our luggage came several hours later), and she has thought of absolutely everything you could need - a hairdryer, extra pillows and towels, a map of Seattle, access to a washer/dryer, even a curling iron! Our favorite parts were the full kitchen (we made our own breakfast every morning) and the lovely patio, which was private and secluded thanks to a wall of bamboo in the yard. 

The apartment is also in a convenient location in Queen Anne. We didn't have a car, but were able to easily get around using the bus system and a cab once or twice (to get to a wedding, which was a little farther away). We so enjoyed wandering around the various neighborhoods in Seattle, and Maija's place is definitely in one of the best ones.

Overall, we were very happy with our stay and would do it again/recommend it to others. For the price and place, you can't beat it."
241032,16705296,2014-08-01,13497562,Sydney And Damian,"My husband and I spent our honeymoon in Seattle and had an absolutely wonderful experience in Maija's home!  The apartment is in a beautiful section of Seattle and is close to everything you could imagine.  We had all of the comforts of home...a kitchen, a place to do laundry (and believe me, after climbing Mt. Rainier and swimming in Sauk Valley we needed to), a coffee maker, a couch/chair/coffee table, wifi, cooking utensils, and a great shower.  We felt like Seattle was home for us and enjoyed very much coming back to Maija's every evening after a long day of adventure.  We were greeted like old friends, treated with much respect, and felt very welcome.  My husband bought some flowers for me at Pike's Market and I didn't have a vase.  Her lovely roommate graciously gave me one and I enjoyed them the entire ten day visit.  Queen Anne is a stunningly beautiful area of Seattle and is so much fun to explore on it's own.  Just minutes from the grocery store, great restaurants, the bus line, and gorgeous Kerry Park, Maija's home is the place to stay.  I would highly recommend staying here.  Thank you, Maija, so very much."
241032,16888486,2014-08-04,6607983,Lindsey,"Maija was an excellent host before and during our stay! The QA apartment is located on the west side of hilly QA in a gorgeous location overlooking the Magnolia neighborhood. There were four of us staying at the apartment and there was ample space to hang out and cook between our weekend activities. The private outdoor patio space was definitely an added bonus. One small thing to note that isn't evident in the pictures is the bathroom is located off of the bedroom - so you need to go through the bedroom to access it...not a big deal, but just something to keep in mind for guests sharing the space. 

If you're looking for a centrally located, stylish apartment, this definitely fits the bill! "
241032,18006047,2014-08-20,17173392,Michael,Maija was very welcoming and helped so much before our stay by answering all of the questions we had. Her home was beautiful and the view/surroundings made it so peaceful and relaxing. We enjoyed staying there and had a great experience!
241032,18402725,2014-08-26,15752256,Ron,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The apartment was lovely, clean, and exactly as shown in the photographs -- it had everything we needed. We particularly liked watching the sunset from the cozy patio.

Thanks again.
Ron & Karen (NZ)"
241032,18783534,2014-09-01,13937444,Tom,"Our host had everything ready for us to enjoy a pleasant stay.  The suite was tidy, clean, and welcoming.  There were fresh linen, towels, dishes and kitchen staples.  Maps and city magazines were at hand.  Several works of art were on subtle display; everywhere you looked, there was something pleasant to see.  The house was surrounded by lush plantings, creating a tranquil oasis in an already quiet neighborhood.  "
241032,19192976,2014-09-08,5080211,Tram,"We enjoyed our stay at Maija's place. The neighborhood is quiet and is easy to find parking. Maija welcomed us as we arrived. Her apartment was very clean and comfortable. The bed was very comfortable. She is very good at the art of feng shui. The artwork and small details of her apartment make it very welcoming. The garden and back porch of the apt was very peaceful. A charcoal grill is included so you stay at home and cook a meal if you wish. The apartment is within walking distance of the D-line bus, it will take you downtown within minutes. Overall it was a good experience. I would stay again. "
241032,19474692,2014-09-13,17338175,Scott,Our stay was absolutely relaxing. The place we stayed at was very private which we enjoyed. Before going out to enjoy the night in Seattle we sat on the back porch and drank a glass of wine which was a perfect way to start the night. The private patio was full of plants which made our visit even more relaxing. Maija was excellent at answering our questions via email and phone when we had questions to ask. The location was great and very easy to get to downtown Seattle. You only had to take one main stretch of road and you were there. I would highly recommend staying at this apartment. 
241032,19730767,2014-09-17,19070523,Jonathan,"Maija' apartment is very nice but I have to note a major caveat. On the first morning in the apartment I slammed my head into a ceiling beam that separates one half of the unit from the other half. Needless to say this was both shocking and very painful. Afterwards I measured the beam and the bottom of it is just 5 feet 11 inches from the floor.  As the beam is painted the same color as the walls, it doesn't really stand out.  It's actually amazing that I'm the first guest this seems to have happened to.  I'm 6 feet 1 inch and anyone under 5'11"" in shoes won't hit the beam, but anyone over that height needs to duck every time he or she walks through the apartment and if you forget just once you'll wind up with the same near concussion that I did. Other than that everything was great but I cannot recommend the apartment for tall guests after my experience. "
241032,19930807,2014-09-21,8501115,Michelle,"Our stay was amazing! My boyfriend and I said a couple of days on our (email hidden)e apartment was clean, quiet and close to downtown. The outside sitting area was really nice. The kitchen was great. The bed was so so so comfy! We often didn't want to get out! We would recommend this apartment to anyone!  "
241032,20078126,2014-09-23,1458876,Michael,The reservation was canceled 197 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
241032,20603259,2014-10-02,16023759,Brianna,"Great little spot,  easy to get to downtown via bus. The apartment was neat and tidy with all the basics. The bed was very comfortable! 

I definitely recommend Maija's to anyone."
241032,21279598,2014-10-14,4476651,Saige,"Lots of nice little touches that made us feel at home like throws on the patio sofa & a tea kettle.  A super comfy bed and simple but beautiful decor.  I also appreciate how much of the work Maija has done herself.  

The apartment is close enough to everything we wanted to see.  It was wonderful being so close to a grocery store with the full kitchen to make some of our meals.

Overall, a most enjoyable stay."
241032,21826868,2014-10-25,20659383,Christina,We really enjoyed our stay at Maija's. The area was spacious and it was great to have some of the amenities of home! The kitchen and access to laundry were very helpful. It is a couple blocks from a major bus line which made it very easy for is to navigate the city. Everything was very clean and was exactly like the pictures. 
241032,21896162,2014-10-26,12972233,Nancy,Maija made me feel very welcome.  The apartment was lovely; very comfortable.  Lots of privacy.  Nice neighborhood.  I hope to stay there again.
241032,22108277,2014-10-30,21843324,Dale,"The place was awesome, even better than the pictures made it look.  Really comfortable and had everything you'd need. Maija was great and I'd absolutely stay here again. "
241032,22170099,2014-10-31,1278395,Tim,"We stayed just done night at the little apartment under Maija's beautiful house in the Seattle hills, but it was lovely. The apt is quite large for just 2 folks and it seems (based on what seemed like a pull-out couch) the place could accommodate 4. There is even your own personal terrace sitting area which alas we couldn't enjoy because it was raining. When we got there, we knocked to say hello to Maija and in 5 minutes she gave us a great list of Seattle places to eat, dance, etc. No complaints whatsoever!
"
241032,22212525,2014-11-01,3666876,Krystle,"We only stayed at Maija's place for 1 night, but had a lovely time. The apartment provided more than enough space for the 3 of us, with the bed and pull-out couch. Styling in the apartment made it feel very cozy, and we definitely felt comfortable during our stay. There is free street parking available right in front of the home, which was very valuable to us. We unfortunately did not have the pleasure of meeting Maija, who was very responsive and flexible with our check-in time, but we were still able to check in and out with ease.

Overall, an enjoyable stay and definitely a place we would recommend."
241032,22369208,2014-11-04,22158131,Frank,"The beautiful home up the hill is the more than I thought I'd get, more lovely and updated than the pictures posted. So close to Kerry Park view point, Seattle Center, Ballard Locks, Sculpture Park and only one express bus ride from downtown Seattle.

Meija's home was easy to find but, having arrived after dark, it did take us some minutes to locate the gate to the apartment, which blends in so well with the wooden fence. She constantly communicated and updated us with all possible routes to the house.

You need more days to enjoy the place; spacious, full of light, peaceful and delight. All the fine things override the famous low beam from which instinct (and forewarning) saved the 6'2.5"" that is me. I met our host once and she was friendly and charming.

I'll recommend it to friends, home away from away."
241032,22761996,2014-11-14,5864188,Marissa & Nestor,Thank you Maija! My parents just thought your apt was wonderful and peaceful. They talked about how comfortable the bed was and how tranquil the space felt:) everything for them was perfect...thank you again from Nestor and myself!
241032,22820557,2014-11-15,7120671,Paul,"Completely met all our expectations. Quiet, comfortable and cosy. Street parking was easy. Location is very convenient for Seattle. We will stay again if available when we travel to Seattle."
241032,22933244,2014-11-17,1705668,Laura," This little gem is just right, with a great bed, ample kitchen, and a front porch/seating area we can't wait to use when we visit during the summer. Her placement of plants was just the right touch. And it is close to downtown and to Ballard where our daughter now lives. We are so thankful for Maija's fast response to our request as our other place cancelled on us last minute.  She was so accommodating and her directions were spot on! "
241032,23200936,2014-11-24,8115706,Angela,We had a great stay at Miaja's. The apartment had everything needed for a comfortable stay and a lovely outdoor space to use in better weather. Miaja was easy to communicate with and we were glad to find a space to so near some friends with a new baby. We're hoping to come back for more visits! 
241032,23424291,2014-12-01,13649737,Troy & Carla,"Place was great. Maija was great. Can't wait to come back.
Everything clean, comfy, cozy, spacious. Fast internet. 
One heads up: be prepared to juggle some parking."
241032,23658893,2014-12-07,24241645,Luis,"Maija responded quickly to any questions. I loved how the place looked (better than the pictures in my opinion). The place was so nicely decorated, clean, and comfortable. Maija's directions to the place were really helpful (GPS can be tricky) and we found it in no time. Street parking was a little tricky, but we managed to always find a spot no more than 5 minutes walking distance. The location itself was great too, with a bus stop right around the corner, and downtown Seattle a short bus ride away. Overall, had a great experience, no problems at all. Would totally come back again :)"
241032,24067296,2014-12-18,6298113,Lizzy,"Maija's apartment was perfect for our stay. She provided everything that we needed for our time there. It was cozy, well furnished, and felt like home. 

The apartment is a little more out of the way than we had hoped but it was easy to take lyft, uber, and busses everywhere we needed to go."
241032,24586892,2014-12-31,22736667,Linda,"We very much enjoyed our stay here.  We were here over the Christmas holiday week and Maija was away so we didn't meet her in person but she stayed in touch and made sure we knew where to reach her in case of a problem.  The space is roomier than we thought it would be. We enjoyed having our own kitchen and dining table and the living room couch made a very comfortable bed for our son on the nights he visited.
We appreciated that we were able to walk to Whole Foods (less than 1/2 mile away) and our daughters home in Queen Anne neighborhood.( be aware that this walk required a fair amount of stairs uphill.)
We will definitely consider staying here again next time we visit Seattle.  The outdoor seating area looked quite pleasant though we weren't able to enjoy it in December.  Overall, Maija's place felt like home away from home."
241032,24866500,2015-01-03,24559096,Jackie,"Loved our stay at the Apt. Close to everything we wanted to see and do. 
So much better than a hotel! Felt like we had a great ""home base"". Love the live plants. Again, thanks!"
241032,25211681,2015-01-09,25136933,Kathleen,"The apartment was lovely. Everything was clean, well-kept, and the bed was very comfortable. The neighborhood was very nice, although it was a mile uphill walk to the nearest market. The only drawback was that the walls were pretty thin, so I could hear everyone upstairs and outside."
241032,25386394,2015-01-14,8001753,Braye,"We had an absolutely amazing Seattle experience and the primary reason was the excellent conditions that we stayed in. Maija provided my group with everything we required and was very helpful and prompt with any enquiries that we had regarding travel around Seattle. Located just across the road from a RapidRide bus which took us directly into the heart of downtown, Maija's abode is perfect for those who want to be close to the city without being right in the thick of it. The establishment itself was impeccable and we had all we needed at our disposal. Highly recommended and my wife and I will definitely be staying there when we return to Seattle! "
241032,25525511,2015-01-18,25974453,Julie,"Everything stated and presented was accurate. I so enjoyed my stay. The first night, I had a few friends over for dinner. Everything I needed was there to do so, and Maija warmly supported me in my choice to have guests upon my arrival. This is my first visit to Seattle without a rent car. Although the street a little tricky if I used a cab, the bus route was very convenient from this location. I also took the light rail from airport, and it was all a breeze. I feel my stay here was the perfect choice. I hope it will be available when I again visit."
241032,26652198,2015-02-16,2408295,Anna,"This was a fantastic place to stay. Maija was very flexible and accommodating, the place was very clean and comfortable and well supplied with everything we need. It felt like home away from home!"
241032,26723310,2015-02-17,8550360,Rosalind,"Maija's space was lovely and very cozy. Although we didn't end up meeting in person, she was very responsive and accommodating. We had everything we needed for our quick trip to Seattle.

 The location was easily accessible to major bus lines and popular neighborhoods and felt private and secure. I would definitely stay here again!"
241032,26771264,2015-02-18,3292772,Audrey,"I loved Maija's place. Cute mid-century modern decor, very clean, comfortable bed. Maija was easy to communicate with and very prompt and helpful. I especially appreciated that she allowed me to book very last minute. Another bonus was the home's lovely gardens and the flower petal-lined steps leading down to the apartment. I'll definitely check to see if her place is available the next time I'm in Seattle. "
241032,26811756,2015-02-19,2213516,Chris,Maija's home was wonderful and perfect for my needs. Even though I was unexpectedly in Seattle and booking late she contacted me promptly and greeted me warmly. 
241032,26993547,2015-02-23,22716357,Melissa,"Great stay, the home was very cute and cozy."
241032,27154673,2015-02-26,26129318,Matt,"Maija was quick to respond to my request and we found her apartment as advertised. Cute little place, good price, no complaints!"
241032,27181152,2015-02-27,27440906,Amanda,"My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay at Maija's apartment. We loved the way it was decorated inside, from the plants to furniture. The bed was super comfortable and the surrounding gardening was perfect. Maija have great directions for an easy check in and was quick to respond to questions. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would love to come back. "
241032,27231627,2015-02-28,24013603,Geneva,"It was so cute! My fiance and I wished we could have enjoyed the balcony and the yard but even with our quick trip in and out of Seattle, it really was a perfect little spot for us to retreat to at the end of some very long days. It was clean, coming and going was easy, her directions were perfect. We had no problems. If you have a car it's close enough to Ballard Ave -- Maija was kind enough to offer up some recommendations for food. One thing I didn't ask about was parking, there is only street parking, and the first night took us a few rounds on roads nearby to find a spot, but we did get to the house pretty late.  "
241032,27451988,2015-03-04,28528102,Derek,"A night's stay in this apartment was perfect! It is minutes away from downtown, but still a great price. Everything was clean, and the bed was very comfortable!"
241032,27553147,2015-03-07,28225074,Brionne,"Maija was very helpful in communication before and throughout our stay. She was warm in her tone even when there was a leak of water. The description of the listing was accurate, The atmosphere and setting were great!"
241032,27753468,2015-03-10,4280981,Miki,Great spot and a good value. Easy parking and access to a main road that will get you downtown quickly. Would definitely stay here again. 
241032,27773850,2015-03-11,28255575,David,"Great communication!! Maija did a wonderful job of getting me all the info I needed to ensure a pleasant, trouble-free stay."
241032,27942535,2015-03-15,11280134,Kristen,"The home was cozy - it had a bed, pull-out couch, full kitchen, dining table, and a clean bathroom.  The space does have low ceilings (maybe 6.5'?), but there is a beam in the middle that my husband almost hit his head on (he's 5'11"").  Other than that, everything was clean and in working order.  The garden area is beautiful and there is a nice view.  You can hear traffic a bit, but only if the doors/windows are open.  I did not actually meet Maija, but my husband and I were running around a lot so I'm not surprised.  The neighborhood was nice, very residential area.  It didn't seem like there was a whole lot within walking distance (a couple of restaurants and an Irish pub), but it was very close to public transit which was able to take us everywhere we needed to go. "
241032,28100772,2015-03-17,27415246,Dylan,"We stayed here for a quick overnight stop in Seattle on our way up the coast. The space is so adorable. I wanted her to come decorate our own house. We loved it. The bed was insanely comfy. It was a little difficult to find street parking at night but during the day was fine. I have no complaints, everything was easy and comfortable. Thanks!! "
241032,28306447,2015-03-22,3050753,Madeleine,"Maija my host gave me all the info i needed to find her place..the apartment was lovely,spacious and felt very welcoming!
She was available via text if there was an issue.She made a point to check in with me and making sure I was fine.
I loved the Queen Anne area and enjoyed the peaceful surroundings."
241032,29175467,2015-04-05,27023641,Jessica,"My partner and I had a wonderful experience at Maija's place. Her patio was inviting and quaint with flowers, and foliage everywhere-- definitely a place I would want to relax! 
 The apartment was stocked with the essentials (hair dryer, towels, curling iron, extra pillows, etc). The bed was very comfortable, and we had everything we needed for our 4 day stay.  We didn't realize until the last day that no one was home in the main house above us, when we spoke to Maija for the first time. She was a very friendly and open person, and it was apparent she cared about her guests' comfort. 
  We would definitely stay here again. "
241032,29339148,2015-04-06,28308819,Kaelyn,Beautiful space. Perfect for the two of us. We'll be coming back!
241032,29912142,2015-04-14,6745390,Faye,"Maija is a welcoming and friendly. The apartment is in a nice quiet neighborhood and we were comfortable walking around it. We were so pleased that it was only a few blocks from our daughters so we could easily visit her without driving from a hotel. 
The apartment is roomy, clean, and well supplied.The cost is very reasonable.  We enjoyed staying there and hope to again. Thanks for sharing the apartment with us Maija!"
241032,30762218,2015-04-27,1609879,Joanne,"This spacious apartment was perfect for us as our daughter lives right next door.   The apartment was clean, comfortable and homey and was just like the description.  We loved sitting on the deck, having a full kitchen(everything we needed) and use of a washer/dryer as we stayed for 9 days.  Maija was welcoming and warm.  
Street parking was easy and easy access to downtown.
We would surely stay here again.
Ron and Joanne"
241032,31042539,2015-05-01,28827464,Joan,"Maija was a warm, welcoming person. She greeted us, gave us the key and said if we needed anything we could send her a text. Her home is gorgeous and peaceful. There were 4 of us staying and we all had a wonderful time. The beds were super comfortable, the place was kept very clean and everything we needed was available to us. Fridge/stove/microwave, washer/dryer, dishes/silverware, central heating/cooling & wifi. It was really, SO nice. I highly recommend this place!"
241032,31630735,2015-05-08,22539081,Elissa,"Beautiful, peaceful apartment with absolutely everything we needed. Gorgeous scenery absolutely everywhere. Thank you Maija for being so quick to respond and so helpful. Our trip to Seattle was so perfect and public transportation was amazing (and so close to the apartment!)"
241032,32114196,2015-05-14,13964085,Ashitha,"The apartment is lovely and feels really secluded, but with good bus links v close by. Maija was very accommodating. Would definitely recommend! "
241032,32678355,2015-05-20,13089109,Gary,"Maija was a fantastic host. Her directions to the apartment were perfect. The apartment itself is great, nicely decorated, very comfortable and had everything I needed for a three night stay. The outdoor space was wonderful and a great place to relax after a day’s walking around the city to enjoy a drink and watch the hummingbirds. I would definitely stay here again."
241032,32862870,2015-05-22,30558166,Andrew,"Staying in Maija's tucked away accommodation for two days was a wonderful experience. The space was clean, well-designed and oriented, and was easy to access from public transportation. Maija was very helpful with checking in before the stay and gave me detailed logistical information so that I would not face any issues. I would definitely recommend this accommodation for anyone looking for a relaxing, comfortable stay."
241032,33098168,2015-05-25,10972904,Niyati,"We had to make a last minute change to our dates and Maija was very flexible. She provided recommendations for various activities that we were interested in. The apartment is a bit difficult to find, but Maija gave us fair warning and helpful directions. We loved the Queen Anne neighborhood where the apartment is located. It was tranquil and central to most of the places that we wanted to visit. Parking was easy to find as well."
241032,33388093,2015-05-27,32448721,Natalie,"Great area.  A bit difficult to find, but very nice.  "
241032,33855735,2015-06-01,11728798,Chris&Ali,Lovely place at a super affordable price! Great communication with host. We loved the outside garden and back patio especially!
241032,34055077,2015-06-04,29232072,Manon,"We stayed in Maija's apartment for 3 nights. It was a perfect place to start our holiday in North West USA! The apartment was cosy, clean and comfortable. "
241032,34420830,2015-06-08,17572563,David,Had a lovely time and the apartment was as described.  Thanks Maija!
241032,35088919,2015-06-15,26876254,Randy & Linda,"This space was perfect for our stay in Seattle! Maija met us at the house and was very nice. Everything was ready for us, even though we were early. The apartment was very clean and comfortable. We were about a mile from SPU and getting to the Key Arena and downtown Seattle was a snap! Parking was never a problem and we always parked close by.  We got really good at parallel parking. The available washer and dryer was a bonus.  We will be back again. "
241032,35222513,2015-06-16,6119403,Ron,"We just spent 1 night here, and it met our needs.  We liked the decor, and the garden path we walked through to get to the apt.  "
241032,35307619,2015-06-17,32540568,Leonardo,"Maija -  was very attentive and helped be flexible to accommodate our late check-in to  Seattle.  The apartment was very well located and had everything we needed.  We only stayed one quick night but there are no complaints.  Street parking is a little strange because the street is very narrow and cars park/drive in both directions but we didn't have a problem finding a spot.  Maija, did a great job in providing clean towels, sheets, and kitchen supplies."
241032,35779990,2015-06-22,30022836,Jim,"The apartment was (email hidden)fortable with plenty of space for the three of us.  Maija was in touch with us before and during our stay, providing directions, welcoming us and with an invitation for assistance if we needed it.  A gracious hostess.  

Would certainly recommend that others check out this listing and will stay here again when back in the area."
241032,36273660,2015-06-27,15517732,Tina,"The apartment was exactly as Maija described.  It was private, had lots of open space, and a lovely deck to sit outside.   The bed was amazing and once you put your feet up and laid back, you are asleep!  Plenty of room for my cousin and I to spread out and watch T.V. or read or write.  The guestbook is a nice touch to see who else has stayed there and the nice comments they had for Maija.  "
241032,37040669,2015-07-04,1660851,Evelyn,Staying here was a seamless experience. Thanks Maija! 
241032,37154628,2015-07-05,14063693,Gabriela,"This place is beautiful, exactly what described in a very peaceful zone with lots of nature around it. We really enjoyed our time there "
241032,37738599,2015-07-10,1452570,Emily,Great place! So spacious and beautifully furnished! The place is so breezy and comfortable! And AC- what a treat!
241032,38486436,2015-07-16,30987915,Tara,Cute little place in a perfect location for getting around Seattle. Had plenty of room and everything we needed for a long stay.
241032,39370113,2015-07-23,28944049,Rene,Wonderful hostess. Very helpful and attentive.
241032,40311664,2015-07-30,16776527,Judy,"Very nicely decorated and laid out. Comfortable, gardeny feeling to the whole place. Great location for getting around Seattle. We had a problem with a door closure, which was fixed very quickly and efficiently. As advertised, it is pretty easy to hear the upstairs neighbors, so if you are very sensitive to noise, that might be an issue for you. Otherwise - I strongly recommend this place and Maija, the host."
241032,40722382,2015-08-02,13354589,Toby,"We had a lovely stay. The apartment is cute, clean and private. It was a nice oasis in the city and an easy place to hang out. We came with our 3 yr old and she enjoyed it too. We didn't get to meet Maija, but she was available to answer questions and help us find it. We would stay here again."
241032,42372837,2015-08-13,10638109,Kristy,"The good:  Good location, comfortable space, comfortable bed, washer and dryer
The bad:  It smelled musty (it's an exposed basement), street noise is loud, there were many cobwebs, the only bar soap was soap used by previous tenants (I did bring our own just in case), very few towels, found bathroom floor mats in laundry room which seemed clean, found coffee maker in laundry room (after we bought one)."
241032,42692115,2015-08-15,6979934,Samantha,Maija was very helpful. She met us late at night when we arrived and showed us to the apartment. Thanks for a lovely visit!
241032,44103849,2015-08-24,226146,Jane,"Our hostess was very pleasant and was responsive to some problems that we encountered.  The apt is fairly spacious with a nice sized kitchen/dining/living area and a good sized patio with grill and comfortable L shaped lounge area furniture.  We, however, had a less than satisfactory time.  Our major problem was the plumbing:  the one toilet backed up 4 times...no unusual use.  The bathroom sink also ran so slowly that we had to wait in between uses.  By the 4th back up in the toilet, we contacted the owner who did respond and fix it, but it seems like an ongoing problem.  My other disappointment was in the general condition of the place:  bed quilt (smelly), grout on bathroom floor dirty.  Generally dinginess.  The photos make the place look lighter/cleaner than it looks in person. Finally,  there are people who live upstairs and there is a lot of foot noise from them dancing (?), jumping (?), running (?) even at night as well as constant noise from a main traffic artery just below this property.    "
241032,45388804,2015-09-02,38863400,Lindsey,"Enjoyable stay, with everything you need to be comfortable away from home.  The apartment itself is a little difficult to find (we arrived on a rainy night, which made it even harder), but it is in a very convenient location.  Close to public transit and a cheap cab fare to get downtown.  We were grateful for all of the kitchen supplies and were able to cook dinner one night with all of the provided utensils and cookware.  The kitchen/ dining area is large and there is a full size refrigerator and stove/ oven.  It was very rainy in Seattle during our stay, so the provided umbrellas and dehumidifier were great additions as well. "
241032,45707756,2015-09-05,13643653,Cori,Maija was a great host. The apartment is secluded and has a very relaxing lounge area on the patio. All our meals were cooked in the fully stocked kitchen. My friend and I stayed three nights and did not want to leave. Thank you Maija 
241032,46577577,2015-09-12,32607300,Michi,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.  We spent the week enjoying the beautiful sites, great food and friendly people of Seattle.  Maija's place was the perfect base camp.  It is clean, cozy and relaxing.  We slept great in a very comfortable bed.  I loved looking out at the green foliage from the front windows and porch with seating.  My brother joined us for one night, and the pullout sofa came in handy. Maija was very friendly and accommodating.  I definitely recommend staying here."
241032,47054478,2015-09-15,39195523,Jenna & Louis,"Very easy communication with the host, cute neighborhood, very clean and comfortable space. As mentioned in other reviews, you can hear noise from upstairs, so if you're sensitive to noise it might be problematic. It was ok for us, and the bed was super comfortable - we had a wonderful stay. Beautiful little porch / outdoor space as well.  Super easy and quick to get downtown on the D Rapid Line. Highly recommend this space!"
241032,47234444,2015-09-16,42921015,Joseph,"Great experience.  The apartment was as described; very pleasant and private.  Maija was very professional and prompt in her communication, even accommodating an early check in."
241032,48161370,2015-09-24,20695373,Katie,Very close to delicious restaurants and just a short hop away from downtown. This is a great location! Maija was super friendly. We would stay here again. 
241032,48400626,2015-09-26,19253767,Michael,We had a wonderful stay. Great location. Host was second to none! Would stay here again. 
241032,51006612,2015-10-17,31213449,Jim,We loved the space. It's very private and close to Queen Ann and Ballard. I enjoyed playing the well kept par 3 golf course just across the street. We were quite comfortable and will absolutely return.  
241032,53043358,2015-11-04,2865581,Jennifer,"Nice, quiet location close to downtown Seattle.  Apt was clean and had nice light.  Kitchen had all I needed to cook which was a great $ saver!  Recommended!"
241032,53345663,2015-11-08,30858918,Brandee,"Just like others have said, perfect location. Everything is under 10 mins (including the space needle!)from the apt, can't get much better than that! The place is so cute, and has a view overlooking the city. Loved it would def stay again."
241032,53573260,2015-11-09,17333245,Michelle,Thank you for letting us stay at your gorgeous apartment.  This is one of the nicest places I've retired to while traveling.  I recommend anyone visiting Seattle to stay here.
241032,53834718,2015-11-13,19118866,Alexander,"Clean, beautiful accommodations in a quiet Seattle neighborhood with easy access to great restaurants and bars and downtown nightlife."
241032,53920296,2015-11-14,19985643,Ashley,"Our stay was extremely short, we were only at Maija's rental for one night. The place was a little difficult to find, especially in the dark & rain, but Maija's directions made it much easier to find. The place was cozy and looks exactly like the photos. It was a little hard to find parking but I'd chalk that up to a late night arrival on a Friday night. If you're looking for a cozy place, not too far from downtown Seattle, I'd recommend this place. "
241032,54693773,2015-11-23,17644549,Al,"Maija's apartment was great and Maija was a fantastic host. A couple of days before we arrived Maija sent us detailed instructions to help us find the place and always responded promptly to all correspondence.

The apartment itself was lovely. Stylish and well furnished. It would be fantastic for 2 people but did the job fine for the 4 of us with a really nice double bedroom and a   comfy fold out sofa in the living room. The location is amazing. 10 minutes walk up the hill is Queen Anne and then Ballard is a 5 minute drive north. Both are great neighbourhoods for shopping and eating/drinking. Downtown is 10 minutes south. Buses either way are a 5 minute walk away."
241032,54980051,2015-11-27,8631573,Kate,"Great place, Maija! Very comfortable space & comfy bed! Thank you for providing a nice, private getaway!"
241032,55849480,2015-12-06,10144515,Ramey,Amazing place in a great location. Highly recommend.
241032,55971781,2015-12-07,16860585,Alexis,"It was a wonderful stay! Beautiful, clean apartment. A bit tricky to find on a dark, rainy night. Also a little hard to find parking. Would stay again!"
241032,56765240,2015-12-17,2772019,Matt,"Maija's place is wonderful and exactly as described, and she provided very clear directions on how to find and access the apartment. 

Clean, well-furnished, quiet, and comfortable! Perfect!"
241032,57116731,2015-12-22,33390495,Wendy,"The apartment was perfect for our stay!  It was clean and ready on time and very comfortable.  I imagine the porch would be very nice in the warmer months to enjoy an afternoon, but we were there in December!  The location was great!"
241032,57357433,2015-12-24,9664864,Vas,"The home is a little tricky to find because of Seattle's streets, but following the directions closely gets you there. It's very easy to access once you're there, and it's easy to check-in and check-out at one's convenience.  Everything inside was as described. If I had to complain about something, it'd be that it was a bit far to walk to places in the cold weather. That said, the place was great, and the location information is accurate - I would stay again in the summer. Highly recommended!"
241032,58298677,2016-01-02,11106274,Naras,"We never met Maija, but the place was wonderful! It was a bit hard to find at night, however the listing is strategically located in Seattle. The place itself really feels like home; it is clean, comfortable, and just as described."
8925878,52023461,2015-10-25,22169329,Ryan,Staying at Kevin's place was fantastic! The views were incredible and the apartment was vary centrally located. They way he handles key handoff was very clever as well! Our stay made it very difficult to leave.
8925878,56781793,2015-12-18,23510694,Angela,"I lived here for 8 weeks, it was just perfect.  Kevin was an excellent host and took care of everything I needed.
The house itself was just beautiful, the views amazing, the bed totally comfortable.  I felt like I was at home! There is nothing I would change and I high recommend staying here. I would definitely come back.
The Queen Ann area is stunning, close to everything, parking was easy, café and shopping close by."
7368959,40017971,2015-07-27,38513810,Jeremy,"Eric had everything ready to go for us at our check-in time, and his apartment is small but highly functional.  The bed is comfy and the neighborhood is pretty quiet.  Will definitely look to stay here again next time we're in Seattle. "
7368959,41258652,2015-08-05,12029399,Kelli,Eric was great. Place is small but is exactly what we needed. Location could not have been better in the center of Capitol Hill. Def would stay again. Side note if you are from a warm state like we are ac's are not common in Seattle but he did have a portable unit which we totally appreciated. 
7368959,41671067,2015-08-08,39357589,FrederickandAdrienne,It was a nice clean studio right in the middle of downtown  the AC unit worked well but I didn't need it as the cross breeze was enough. Had a little trouble with the WiFi but the owner provided a solution. All in all a very enjoyable stay 
7368959,42329034,2015-08-12,10569329,Laurie,The location is great and so easy to get to nearby restaurants etc. the house is compact and efficiantly furnished. 
7368959,43147168,2015-08-17,19053242,Samuel,"After arriving after check in time in Seattle we tried to get in touch with Eric (several phone calls and several messages), who finally texted us 4 hours later. At this point we were ready to cancel, not having received the door code to enter the apartment. We did finally receive the code and opted to stay the night. The apartment is in a nice location, with nice places to eat within walking distance, and the kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom were small but clean and inviting. We did unfortunately come across a closet full of trash, which was less pleasant. With a bit more attention from the host this could have been a much nicer experience."
7368959,43469074,2015-08-19,41773075,Izaak,Ridiculously comfortable bed. Great location. Chat with Eric was very much business. Pleasant experience overall. Be aware of the AC unit's exhaust hose and extremely small drip bucket.
7368959,44268427,2015-08-24,14909243,Ciprian,"The studio is compact and communication by text message/Airbnb messages with Eric is good. The neighborhood is nice, a Safeway within walking distance, but parking can be tight and there is a zoned system in place. Eric was waiting in the studio and provided assistance when the wi-fi password was not working shortly after check-in. One small drawback was the inability to open the bathroom window for ventilation, as well as some minor cleanliness issues. Considering the price and the added cleaning fee, more attention to details should have been provided. Otherwise, the bed is very comfortable. The TV system can be glitchy at times, but is fine. "
7368959,44986249,2015-08-30,16400080,Leanna,"Not a glamorous space but very functional, quiet, and a great location with excellent walkability to restaurants/bars (Ada's is adorable and delicious for morning coffee and eats). The bed was a little on the soft side but comfortable. A/C worked great and we had a very pleasant stay. Eric was very responsive to communication too. "
7368959,45115856,2015-08-31,17814958,Bridget,"The listing was accurate. This apartment consisted of a bedroom, bathroom, and small kitchen. Eric left out a couple towels and washcloths for my friend and I to use. 

We loved being in the Cap Hill neighborhood and in close distance to restaurants/bars. Thanks!"
7368959,47010573,2015-09-14,14973077,James,"Eric was fantastic with communicating and making sure we got into the apartment with no issues. Location was solid, a quick walk to bars and food. Apartment was cozy as described. We didn't have trouble finding parking so that was nice as well. Only negative was the cleanliness of the apartment. Not a deal breaker but if you are going to charge a cleaning fee than I feel the space should be a little more clean and tidy. Besides that we were happy with our stay. Thanks!"
7368959,47337818,2015-09-17,15493058,Kerry,"Outstanding host - Eric helped us out and was very responsive and on the ball. The spot was in a great location, clean and exactly what we needed for a couple of days in the city. "
7368959,48331948,2015-09-25,4096926,Christopher,Eric was very nice and communicated very well. The studio is in a very convenient location in capital hill. I should note that while the place was relatively clean it does smell like cigarette smoke. There isn't cable just Roku which I didn't really have time to figure out.
7368959,50735951,2015-10-13,45775003,Charlene,"Eric was a fabulous host, from booking through leaving. He was an email away and eager to help with everything we needed. We hope to be repeat guests."
7368959,51495493,2015-10-20,829596,Carlos,"Small, but comfortable place. Location cannot be beat. We had some issues with the key on our second night, but Eric replied promptly and had it fixed within the hour."
7368959,53579316,2015-11-09,3158964,David,"Eric was very responsive and communicated clearly and timely.  The place is an great location, but it's very basic ""no-frills"" kind of place. If all you need is a place to crash, it gets the job done.  The bed was very comfortable, but the apartment lacked some of the features that make it an easy place to stay - no end tables, no bedside light or floor lamp - just the big ceiling light. Small kitchen has a coffee maker, but bring your own coffee, cream and sugar, etc...  Like I said, decent for crash pad, if that's all you need. "

6951415,40985770,2015-08-03,3729803,Sarah,Mireya was extremely accmodating and communicative. The apartment is centrally located in the amazing Capitol Hill neighborhood and provided easy access to the downtown area as well. Highly recommended! 
6951415,42147363,2015-08-11,34072323,Jenna,"We loved this studio. Lots of light and so relaxing. We couldn't wait to return to the apartment after our adventures. Mireya had just bought a brand new bed, which was really nice. Great location! Near Capitol Hill shops and near lots of cafes and restaurants. Mireya was happy to recommend places to eat for us. I would be happy to stay here again and would recommend it to a friend. "
6951415,42475775,2015-08-13,40681603,Galen,"This was a great apartment and knowing this was my first experience, my host was incredibly communicative and thoughtful. She recommended local places to dine and enjoy and I did just that. I will definitely use this service again and I look forward to staying in the same place!"
6951415,42752115,2015-08-15,40038338,Rawson,"Mireya was really helpful with questions- responsive and considerate. She was great to accomplish our needs. Her place was open and airy, lost of natural light. Mireya even moved around furniture to best meet the needs of our party. "
6951415,43268096,2015-08-18,18830538,David,"Mireya was a wonderful host. She gave us good restaurant suggestions and overall was extremely kind and helpful. The neighborhood is full of good coffee, bars and restaurants. The apartment was exactly as described and ideal for two people."
6951415,45292717,2015-09-01,4748724,Christian,Mireya was a very communicative. Place was great. Really liked the neighbourhood and we could walk to everything we wanted to go to. Would stay here again.
6951415,46196149,2015-09-08,16354753,John,Mireya's home was exactly what we were looking for in Seattle. I. In the city and we'll situated to take advantage if everything Seattle offers.  She is also a wonderful host as she checked in with us periodically to ensure we were enjoying our stay. I would recommend Mireya's home to others looking to visit Seattle.
6951415,46974565,2015-09-14,17298841,Chris,"Had a wonderful time in this beautiful and light apartment. Located in the HEART of cap hill, two blocks from anything. Mireya also has great taste in books and knick-knacks: take a look around : )"
6951415,47339959,2015-09-17,2019385,Robin,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6951415,48436876,2015-09-26,42068836,Bruce,Mireya was super nice and an excellent communicator. Her place was in a primo location! 
6951415,52706201,2015-11-01,1435011,Tarso,"Mireya was amazing! Her apartment is really nice, the location is the best you can hope for and the hospitality, oh the hospitality. Five stars!"
6951415,54924246,2015-11-25,1510399,Kelly,"I only got to meet Mireya once when she was helping me get settled into the place, but she was super helpful throughout my entire stay! The studio is close enough to everything in Cap Hill (as well as downtown via bus) but still in a quiet residential area - the best of both worlds, really! Couldn't have asked for a better place and host :) "
6937071,36837288,2015-07-01,2663394,Andre,"It was a pleasant stay, and he made us feel welcome by leaving a little welcome package at the front door. Nice neighborhood, very walkable.
"

5306727,28676859,2015-03-28,13767774,Austin & Ani,"Great location, very clean space with lots of natural light. You can see the sound from the window and you can walk to all the Seattle Center activities very readily. We walked to and from downtown/Pike Place as well - only a 20 minute walk.  

Santosh and his roommate were very kind and welcoming. I'd definitely stay again."
5306727,30267544,2015-04-19,31242795,Simon,This worked out really well for me - the room was really comfortable and Santosh and his roommate went out of their way to assist me.
5306727,33295188,2015-05-26,32640599,Tommy,"Santosh was a great host. He was on vacation, so we basically had the entire place to ourselves. He checked on us regularly to make sure that we're going great. He even made sure that there is food in the refrigerator for us! Will definitely come back again!"
5306727,37254219,2015-07-05,13241435,Jon,"Great place to stay! Super clean, and Santosh and his roommate were very kind and gracious hosts. Santosh was out of town so his roommate took care of us, gave us suggestions, and even took my friend and I to see July 4 fireworks!"
5306727,38040751,2015-07-12,36132692,Emily,"Santosh was great! We had a late flight in and was extremely accommodating. He made sure we would have the key to the place, and set up an alternative (a friend to help us) if something didn't work. He also helped us figure out the best way to his place from the airport. He checked on us through the entire process. 
The bedroom was clean and comfortable, as was the entire place. I was shocked two boys lived in this place normally! 

Thank you for the help and a great place to stay!"
5306727,50026967,2015-10-08,45030743,Lucas,I enjoyed my stay! The place was nice and in a good location (just around the corner from the space needle and other tourist attractions). The host was friendly and attentive. Would stay again. 
8956631,52018030,2015-10-25,46339147,Suzanne,"A definite perfect location to experience Seattle! Walk or ride - all easily accessed. No detail is overlooked as far as ""must haves"" to feel at home at Marianne's place. Modern, clean, comfortable -- a refreshing experience. Her responsiveness, hospitality and generosity are superior. So appreciate her accommodating our extended stay and allowing us to enjoy her new place on short notice. Thank you, Marianne! Your place is definitely our ""home base"" during our next visit to Seattle."
8956631,52540623,2015-10-30,46987809,Alejandra,"Marianna's place was perfect. Location was amazing, blocks away from Pike's and all the good stuff. Her place was clean and safe. She had a small washer and dryer and full kitchen. Would definitely return. "
8956631,53014205,2015-11-03,29339299,Lizette,"The host was very welcoming and the studio was lovely, nice, clean and also conveniently located within walking distance to everything just as it was described in the listing.. Also the Top Shop Donut right next door was a plus. I'd recommend this studio and would stay again. :)"
8956631,53523505,2015-11-09,11886919,Devin,The apartment is very nice. We were at a conference and it was very convenient to walk to the conference center.
8956631,53667729,2015-11-10,48437934,Sean,"Marianne's place was great. Super cozy, very clean.  Included all of the things one would need (kitchen stuff, towels, sheets, etc) , so that was a total plus. This was my first AirBnB and Marianne was super helpful with the whole thing. Clear instructions via email, and easy to reach via text.
The area was a little noisy, but it's downtown Seattle, that's to be expected, and in no way reflects the opinion I have on the room.
A+, would definitely rent from Marianne again!"
8956631,54146858,2015-11-16,45231350,Steve,"Marianne's place was amazing.  Her communications and instructions we exactly what was needed.  The apartment was very close to Jazz Alley, and is ideal for catching a show their, or walking to Seattle Center of Pike Street Market."
8956631,54397584,2015-11-19,46984403,Hilary,The host is very nice and responded my messages very promptly. The apartment is vey cozy and located in a good location downtown area. I like the studio myself. 
8956631,54631049,2015-11-22,11111056,Patti,"Marianne's place was located perfectly in Seattle downtown. We were able to walk everywhere from Pike Public Market to the space needle to Capitol Hill. 

The place is small and kept clean, but makes for a great ""base camp"" when visiting. Marianne is very easy to get in touch with and she makes every effort to accommodate her guests. "
8956631,55229961,2015-11-29,30287597,Hermanni,"Perfect location, nice little flat. "
8956631,55698140,2015-12-04,21292525,Rosie,The place was great!! We walked everywhere (when it was not raining). 5 min walk to pike place. Coffee shop right next door. I would come back here in a heartbeat. Studio was bigger than I thought we a very decent size kitchen. Thank you very much for letting us stay. :)
8956631,55916909,2015-12-07,12275531,Tess,"Marianne's place was everything we could have hoped for a great stay in Seattle. The location was perfect for us. We walked a lot + discovered a ton. EMP museum, space needle, pike place are all just a short walk from the apartment. When we arrived, there was a mishap with the keys however Marianne handled it as quickly as she could. Within an hour, we were able to enter the apartment no problem. The only strange thing was the cleaning lady insisted on us leaving the bottom lock unlocked. Later during our stay, she texted us telling us she was coming by to drop something off. She must have a top key so that's why she insisted on us leaving the bottom unlocked. We were home when she stopped by and I'm honestly glad - I found it to be a breach of privacy but I'm sure she didn't mean it that way. Beyond that, the stay was really great. Super amazing bed, lots of towels, full equipped kitchen, cable tv, and great location! I'd come back :) "
8956631,56421096,2015-12-13,50066593,Amy,"Very nice and clean place. We absolutely loved it. It was very close to everything in downtown Seattle - 14 mins walk to the needle, 10 mins walk to the market and 10 mins to all the downtown shopping. "
8956631,56671552,2015-12-16,35449156,Ida,"Great communication with Marianne. She always made sure everything was accommodating. The location is very accurate and convenient (between downtown and the Space Needle). I absolutely love how she furnished the place - it felt home! Even with her recent busy schedule, she made time to answer all my questions and concerns. What an amazing host! I couldn't be happier. Thank you Marianne! Hopefully, I'll be back in Seattle soon!   "
7630155,45756630,2015-09-05,9351084,Tracy,"We had so much fun at Sebastian's house! We took a chance on booking a room that had no reviews but it was SO worth it! 

The room is HUGE, it could be its own apartment. I like the separate entrance and private bathroom. There's a nice porch directly off of the bedroom too, great for relaxing. 

Sebastian was a wonderful host, very attentive to our needs, great conversations and extremely interesting to hear about his professional life! His kitties are super adorable and the house is really clean and quiet. 

We will definitely be back soon! 5 star host ;)"
7630155,53443373,2015-11-08,811251,Trevor,"Beautiful home and a wonderful host! The room for rent is huge and has its own bathroom and outdoor entrance. Beautifully decorated house with several nice areas to relax. I really enjoyed sitting on his porch and drinking my morning coffee. Sebastian had lots of advice on where to eat and sites to see around Seattle. The house was only a 15 minute walk to the local organic grocery store, PCC. The light rail is very close to his house too and can easily be taken to SODO area for shopping and cannabis! Sebastian is a very interesting guy to talk to. I highly recommend aligning your trip with one of his cannabis events!! Too much fun. "
1556170,8072944,2013-10-14,2798907,Ryan,"this place was great! everything was in tip-top shape, clean and comfortable. cute and safe neighborhood within a short walk from coffee shop, bar, convenient store, grocery store, and light rail.

and anna was a fantastic host! i came in late, so we did not meet, but the key was in the lockbox and everything was ready for me. she went above the call of duty by leaving a personal gift bag and some treats in the kitchen."
1556170,8199577,2013-10-20,1908298,Tifi,"I've use Airbnb a few times and this was, by far, my worst experience.  The pictures are deceiving.  This place is very small.  The furniture is cheap and tiny.  I swear the chairs in the living room are made for infants.  She lives right across the street from a Fire Station, so you can imagine how loud it gets at night.  The bus stop is right outside, which is convenient, but contributes to the noise.  It was good exercise hiking up and down the stairs that lead to her unit.   "
1556170,9518991,2014-01-01,1911237,Joan,"This apartment was perfect for our needs.  We stayed almost a week from Christmas to New Years Eve and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Bed was comfy, and the location with the bus stop steps away was very convenient.  Anna even left us a bottle of wine, snacks, and a miniature Christmas tree.  I highly recommend it!"
1556170,10211697,2014-02-06,1520764,Abdul,"It was my first time with airbnb. 
•Overall my experience was good. 
•Communication was really good, Annan replied to my inquires and  questions really quickly. 
•The please was very nice just like the photos. 
•Annan welcomed me with beverages, snacks, coffee and tea. ( I didn't meet her but she made me feel welcomed through our communication.) 
•Towels and slippers were provided. 
•The only thing that you might not like is the noise coming from the streets.  "
1556170,10303788,2014-02-11,7302505,Emre,"I stayed at Anna’s apartment two nights and it was a great experience. Apartment was very clean, everything was well-organized and had everything I needed during my weekend stay in Seattle. I didn’t get to meet Anna in person but she replied all my questions very quickly and sincerely. I strongly recommend her apartment to other travelers and I’ll definitely prefer to stay at her place during my upcoming visits to Seattle. "
1556170,10404564,2014-02-17,4441034,Heidi,Very good communication. Thanks Anna!
1556170,10669649,2014-03-02,786142,Carter,"I work often in Seattle and really appreciate places that take me out of the tourist element and into ""real"" Seattle.  Anna's place is very nice, clean and well-appointed.  I felt very comfortable there and appreciate the little extra touches that made it feel homey and comfortable. I really hope I can use her place next time I come.  I also really appreciated the parking space."
1556170,10984651,2014-03-16,12246448,Elcin,"The apartment was very clean, organized, and comfortable. Ana was so kind and considerate that she had left some cookies and snacks before I arrive at the home. Also, she was very responsive. I had a great time at her apartment. "
1556170,11185624,2014-03-24,11003064,Kenneth,"It is a lovely apartment. Great location. We were there for over a week, Everything was in great shape, clean and comfortable. Great neighborhood, close to coffee shop, bar, convenient store, grocery store, and light rail.  Great having a parking spot as well.  Always better than a hotel."
1556170,11267289,2014-03-27,9773303,Charhys,"Anna's place was awesome! Stylish decor and very cozy furniture. Well insulated so you really didn't have to run the heat much (which is a huge plus given how cold it can get in Seattle). I love that the 36 bus stop is literally right in front of the building and it's a reasonable walk to the Beacon Hill light rail station, Red Apple, Jefferson Park, the library and a slew of other little shops, restaurants and such. And if you happen to drive, the place is located just a couple minutes from I-5. There can also be some Car2Go vehicles around the area (if you're into that) and there are two ZipCars at the light rail station. I appreciated the prompt and thoughtful communication from Anna and the ability to come and go with ease. The place is very clean and personalized so it feels like your own apartment for the duration of your stay. I said I didn't want a touristy experience since I'm from Seattle/Tacoma visiting home and I most definitely felt at home, but always a text or phone call away from assistance if I needed it. This experience is ten times better than a hotel. Such a comfortable place, supportive and attentive host, and an all around beautiful community. Thank you, Anna! "
1556170,11489627,2014-04-05,12781337,Michael,"This place was great! I needed a place to stay for a few nights, as I finalized plans to move away from Seattle. And Anna's place suited me perfectly. Gorgeous little apartment with TONS of natural light, right on a major bus line. It took me minutes to get downtown. Anna was very communicative regarding any questions I had about the ins and outs of the place, and made me feel right at home, providing snacks and bottled water. I'll definitely stay here again when I visit the city!"
1556170,12040998,2014-04-21,2479412,Betty,The reservation was canceled 18 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1556170,12197446,2014-04-25,6560543,Paula,"This was the perfect place for a get away with my husband; roomy, stylish but not fancy, and a good kitchen too. Anna was a responsive and attentive hostess and the instructions for our arrival were very clear and easy to follow (late at night in the rain)
Thanks Anna! "
1556170,12540508,2014-05-05,12461936,Marcel,"Clean and comfortable, looking forward to staying here again."
1556170,12984124,2014-05-16,206203,Amanda,"Anna's place is very clean and brightly furnished. It is close to easy transit options. She offers a welcoming atmosphere with coffee, snacks, tea, and more. It is a good value. Anna's place is within a very active area and can be noisy although everything is pretty quiet after 10 pm and before 6 am. I was not able to connect to the internet upon my arrival but she came the next day and fixed it, which I appreciated.
"
1556170,13042699,2014-05-18,14459539,Diana,The place was very clean. Anna was professional and made it easy for us to find and stay at her place. Go choice for seattle visitors! 
1556170,14076416,2014-06-11,12849530,Maaria,Wonderful place in a very central location! Loved that Jefferson Park was literally right around the corner. Very quiet area (except at night). Anna is a great host and is always there to answer your questions! Wonderful experience! 
1556170,14427727,2014-06-19,9106456,Veronica,"I knew my experience with Anna and her apartment was going to be great before it even began.  I requested an early check-in because I had to bump up my flight to an earlier time to get to a meeting.  Anna was quick to respond and accommodate my needs immediately on short notice.  Anna sent detailed instructions on how to get into the apartment.  The apartment is LOVELY.  I was in Seattle apartment hunting for my move the following month, and I kept thinking that I could only hope to get an apartment as nice as hers.  The apartment is tastefully decorated and has all the amenities a person would need.  It was easy to get anywhere from her apartment using either the lightrail a few blocks away or the 36 bus right outside the doorstep.  All in all, my experience here was fantastic.  I would highly recommend Anna and her apartment for anyone's stay in Seattle."
1556170,15067737,2014-07-01,3819881,Carol,"Anna was very responsive. Check in was easy, the apartment was very clean. The bottled water in the fridge was a nice touch. 

The only thing folks should know is that it is on a busy street. There is significant traffic noise, but it quiets down after 11pm. Also if you are sensitive to scents, she uses a Glade plug in air freshener. I just unplugged it, put it outside, and opened the windows for awhile. It was much better. 

The price and location are excellent. I recommend it as a good place to stay."
1556170,15417065,2014-07-08,3286580,John,"Very nice, comfortable and clean apartment. Nice fully equipped modern kitchen. As others mentioned, there is road noise but I was able to sleep comfortably with earplugs and my companion slept well without. It is a reasonable walk from the metro and there is a bus stop just out front. The only real complaint was internet connection which was very spotty. We both work online when we are away and it was extremely frustrating to lose the connection so frequently. The modem is not located in the apartment so it's difficult to say why.  "
1556170,15970396,2014-07-19,984558,Benny,"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle! This apartment is by a lovely park I went jogging in, with a gorgeous skyline view of Seattle. You can tuck your car in at the back of the apartment, and then drive to downtown Seattle in EIGHT minutes!
The apartment itself was a little warm in July, but if you leave the windows open it's fine. The host was excellent with communication, and we would totally stay here again!"
1556170,18873328,2014-09-02,14362018,Jay,My experience at Anna's place was awesome. The location was great and the unit was exactly as described! I would highly recommend her place to anyone.
1556170,19012417,2014-09-04,10706060,Pete,"Appartment was awesome.. Clean.. Plenty of sunlight.. Very private.
No concerns at all.. Anna was a great host.

Tip:
I have rented from AIRBNB before and it seems that majority of the places do not supply soap, shampoo or conditioner??? Bring some with you or keep it in mind cuz many of the places dont have them"
1556170,19136941,2014-09-07,15437675,Tom,"Anna was a great host, very responsive and courteous.  The place was well stocked and very clean.  The location was perfect for a low key place near (~0.3 miles) the light rail that goes right into the city. The neighborhood felt very safe and was a welcoming place to stay. There was traffic noise from the street, but it did not bother us."
1556170,19699417,2014-09-16,20782670,Deborah,"Great apartment, convenient location.  Clean, comfortable and inviting.  Would definitely stay here again.  Yes, you can hear the road noise, but otherwise it was a quiet spot.  "
1556170,19850168,2014-09-19,20133853,Steve,Great little space! Very well decorated and clean. Communication sw clear and appropriate. A bit of road noise but I knew that before reserving the unit. Close to lots of things. I'd stay again!
1556170,20082730,2014-09-23,16287866,Sherry,"I had a wonderful stay in Seattle. This Beacon Hill location was perfect and trips downtown only took 15 minutes. If I had flown instead of driven the bus that was right curbside would've been perfect.

I enjoyed my not having to worry about parking as it was readily available for my personal vehicle that I drove from Montana.

Anna was available and very responsive via message, and the location felt very safe.

There were even plum trees with ripe plums falling to the ground! And the little slippers waiting within the front door as well as the bottled water in the frig were greatly appreciated.

Lovely apartment and host. Would definitely stay there again. Thank you Anna!"
1556170,20604085,2014-10-02,19052720,Lisa,I had a great stay in this pristine and light filled apt.  It was inviting and I felt safe and secure.  Very convenient also.  Loved staying there!
1556170,20764513,2014-10-05,8614940,Rachael,Such a cute and comfortable space!! Easily one of the nicest and most convenient places I've stayed in Seattle! Anna was available but the space was totally private - it was awesome and I want to stay there now every time I come to Seattle. 
1556170,21026029,2014-10-10,14077564,Claire,"Really gorgeous apartment grat facilities, having bus stop in front was really handy getting around, easy to get to and from airport, thanks so much!"
1556170,21164323,2014-10-12,14102974,Todd,"Anna's place was perfect! Just as advertised and better. The apartment was exceptionally clean and in a great location close to everything. There were little touches that made me feel very comfortable and at home. I will definitely be staying here again! Thanks, Anna. "
1556170,21312983,2014-10-14,21526330,Jimmy,"The apartment was as advertised, very clean. The location is very near downtown Seattle -- nice, easy access. "
1556170,21705326,2014-10-22,7940875,Danielle,"I really enjoyed staying at Anna's! So much better than a hotel. The location was super convenient to downtown and other parts of Seattle (there's a bus stop right in front). The apartment was safe, clean and very comfortable. Anna was nice enough to arrange for an early check in since my flight arrived early in the day and let me know about public transit options as well as where I could park if I had a car.

Such a great host and stay! "
1556170,22401721,2014-11-05,8738539,Jenny,"Anna's place is beautiful, located conveniently near public transportation, and had every I needed for a comfortable and easy stay. Check-in/check-out was a breeze, the space was spotless, and essentials were stocked in the kitchen and bathroom.

Anna was quick to reply and kindly offered to make herself available should I need anything during my visit... of course, I didn't need a thing because she had already thought of everything.

I highly recommend Anna's place and hope I'll have a chance to visit again soon!"
1556170,22609670,2014-11-10,20528248,Philip,"Great location, very clean, no problems getting in or out. Loved the ceiling beams! Having a parking space is a great benefit for those with cars."
1556170,23217666,2014-11-25,22976115,Ragnhild,"I had a great stay at Anna's place. The apartment met my expectations exactly. It was cleaner than the average hotelroom, and a lot cleaner than my home usually is. Anna was quick to reply in all comunication and was available for questions on both email and text. Her place had a perfect location for exploring Seattle and other areas with easy acsess to the freeways by car, and the bus to downtown Seattle right outside the door. I would defenently stay here again. 

Ragnhild"
1556170,24106868,2014-12-20,23265482,Ralph,"Anna provided a very clean, recently remodeled, and conveniently located place to stay for a few weeks.  Having a spot for off street parking was a huge bonus.  I was completely satisfied with the accommodations and service.  "
1556170,24869711,2015-01-03,147769,Andrew,"Working with Anna was easy with fast and accurate responses - the location and amenities were exactly as advertised.  Loved the apartment and would highly recommend for other travelers looking to experience Seattle in a cool neighborhood.
"
1556170,25747139,2015-01-25,24964992,Erica,"The apartment was clean, modern, and overall nice. Anna (the host) was responsive and friendly. The apartment was thoughtfully furnished. The only concern about this apartment is the noise from the street, the apartment can be a bit noisy but this was not overwhelming  for me. Overall, my stay here was very nice. "
1556170,25920061,2015-01-29,20523702,Gabe,This apartment is awesome!! My Seattle friends were super jealous and wanted to move in. Anna was really accommodating with my same-day booking. Neighborhood is close to downtown and in a decent area. 
1556170,26010443,2015-02-01,18700442,Jeremy,Anna has a really nice and modern place in a great location. We had a rental car and it was only a couple exits away from down town. Even more great is you have the option to use the light rail system that's close by if you don't feel like driving. We had no problems whatsoever during our stay and Anna was most helpful to us. I will definitely recommend this place to stay when coming to Seattle. 
1556170,26374934,2015-02-10,11762812,Duane,"Ann was accommodating, and I appreciated she was able to be flexible when my co-worker Trevor and I had some last minute changes.
"
1556170,26703057,2015-02-17,3047335,Jomay,"Note: Anna had us stay in her other unit so this review is actually for ""1 Bedroom Apt In North Beacon Hill.""

Anna was a friendly and responsive host. We got clear instructions for check-in, and she messaged later that night to be sure everything was fine. The unit was very clean and as pictured. There is a nice park across the street, and it's just a couple blocks from a good coffee shop and restaurants. 

The only issue we had was with the wifi, which we found to be unreliable. We needed to do some work on a laptop during our stay and ended up having to go to a coffee shop. To Anna's credit, she responded quickly when notified about the wifi troubles, but given that we were only staying a short while, the issue couldn't be resolved before our departure. She was going to have Comcast look into it so hopefully it will be resolved for the next guest."
1556170,27263511,2015-03-01,26077962,Jon,"Anna was a great host and help.  Answered any and all questions in a timely manner and was very accommodating to the many requests and questions I had. 
The space listed is quite beautiful and within easy reach of both the bus stop out front and the Light rail station just blocks away and a free parking space to boot. 
Great and spacious kitchen with a standard fridge with basic cooking supplies and utensils. 
Beacon hill is a great neighborhood and the apartment is located near parks and golf courses. 
If I'm in Seattle I would definitely stay at Anna's place again. "
1556170,28485562,2015-03-24,28199564,Justin,"From the first message with Anna, she was super helpful and very good with getting back to you. Even with some silly questions, she graciously answered everything. The apartment was bright, clean and exactly what was advertised. The bed was super comfy as well. I had a great nights sleep every night There was everything basic you would need. She even came by the second day to drop off toilet paper and paper towel. It was pretty central to everything as well, being only 20 minutes from the airport and 10-15 minutes from downtown or West Seattle. The neighbourhood was nice as well, although the only complaint I had was that I did find it quite noisy, as there is a fire station across the road, as well as being on the corner of 2 busy intersections. But I would hardly fault Anna for that. If you can tolerate some traffic noise, I would 100% recommend anyone to rent this place. Between Anna and the great apartment, your stay in Seattle will be comfortable and easy."
1556170,29046626,2015-04-03,15584008,Katie,"Anna was very easy to communicate with about or travel plans and always responded quickly. Our arrival time changed multiple times due to airline delays and it was no issue for our arrival. Everything we needed was at the apartment and in good working condition. There was plenty of space for the two of us. There are enough kitchen utensils/pans to cook if you need to, although there is so much good eating in the city. We just cooked breakfast.

Of note, the thermostat is automatically set to a very cold temperature, be sure to modify it upon arrival to the unit if you plan to be there. I think it might need to be modified daily, as it will reset to the cold temperature in the morning.

We had a car but did use public transportation some of the time. The location of this apartment is very conveniently located to public transit options and you truly can get around easily, from the airport to the apartment to the city with out a car.

I highly recommend this as a place to stay."
1556170,29841255,2015-04-13,2032277,Neal,"Residential Neighborhood.

15 minutes to down by bus. Bus runs every 30 minutes or so.

Big city park located across the street. Pleasant for a stroll.

As for Anna's place it was clean. Very clean, Spotless.

It was also quite spacious with plenty of room for an individual guest or a couple.

A few (minor) negatives:
- No Cable TV (I am a political news junkie)
- Place was somewhat charmless.
- Could occasionally hear noise from the street.

3.5 Stars out of 5."
1556170,30753469,2015-04-27,17151671,Lori,"We came out to visit our son and his fsmily who live in Seattle. Anna's place was just about 4 blocks away so it was very convenient for us. The unit is just as described. We didn't spend a lot of time in the unit (most of our time was spent with our granddaughter) but it was very well equipped. The bed is VERY comfortable and everything was VERY clean. Location was great; close to coffee shops, restaurants, a golf course and a beautiful park. It's also a nice quick walk to the light rail and only 3 stops to downtown Seattle. There is a bus stop right in front of the building as well. We went to a Mariner's game while in town and it's only 2 stops on the light rail to the stadium. You definitely do not need a car to stay here although there is parking on site.  Anna was very responsive to any of our emails and everything went very smoothly.  The unit is on a main road so there is some traffic noise but we didn't notice it after the first night. If you need a dark room to sleep in I suggest bringing an eye mask as there is a bright light on the building next door that lightens the bedroom through the blinds. It didn't bother either of us but I thought I should mention it. We will definitely stay here again and we thank Anna for her attentiveness and for providing such a nice, clean home for our stay in Seattle."
1556170,31778912,2015-05-10,4660548,Breyden,Anna was a great host. Left easy details on getting set up in the apartment and had a nice clean space that was close to almost everything you need! Loved it 
1556170,32496550,2015-05-19,26426090,Conner,"This was my first time using AirBnB and I must say, it was terrific. I got in to town a littler earlier than expected so I reached out to Anna to see if an early check-in was possible. She responded to me immediately and told me the apartment was ready and waiting. The apartment was great. Clean, cozy and in a great location. Bus stop right outside. Small market and convenience stores/gas stations about a half mile down the street with everything you might need. The apartment is close to freeways which made it easy to get around Seattle, plus you have your own parking space(as well as off street parking if needed).

Anna was always quick to respond to any questions I might have had leading up to and when I arrived. I received a very detailed check-in email explaining anything I might need to know regarding the apartment.

Given the opportunity I would definitely rent Anna's apartment again."
1556170,34124288,2015-06-05,29010025,Danny,I had a great time staying at Anna's apartment.. It was clean and good size. The bus stop right out the front and the light rail just down the road made it easy to get around Seattle.. I would stay here again when I'm back in Seattle.
1556170,34525545,2015-06-09,29604908,Hengky,"Anna is very responsive and provides very clear instruction how to access the apartment on the day of the arrival. The apartment is very clean and neat with modern appliances in the kitchen and living area. There's a bus stop right in front of the apt although we don't get to use it as we had rented a car, which we parked at the designated parking. The location is very strategic with only 15 minutes away from downtown and 10 minutes away from Chinatown. Unfortunately we arrive at one of the hottest weekend in Seattle so the indoor temperature gets really warm without AC, but we know that before booking in.  Also Anna is kind enough to provide a rollaway bed so that my wife and toddler can use the queen bed themselves.  Overall a pleasant experience and would love to stay here again."
1556170,35070091,2015-06-15,17248104,Tracy,Anna was great to work with in leading up to our trip.  She was so easy to contact and her instructions for check in was very easy to follow.  The place was exactly like the pictures and it was very spacious for the two of us.   Parking was sufficient on the street and city center was only 10 minutes away!  
1556170,35424326,2015-06-18,35479920,Guillermo,"This place was just as advertised. It was clean and very suitable for my 3 day stay. Although there i no cable, the tv has an antenna and with the wifi you can hook up your laptop to the tv an watch whatever you want. It's in a nice quiet neighborhood and i felt safe. All the appliances worked so i was able to keep some groceries in the apartment.  The location was ideal (10-15 minutes to the pike market) and i would highly recommend it to anyone visiting the Seattle area. "
1556170,36118671,2015-06-25,1370636,Farideh,"We were very happy with our stay at Anna's apartment. It was very spacious for the two of us and has many windows for great natural light. The apartment was very clean and is exactly as in photos. We appreciated the private parking space outside the apartment. The location of the apartment is ideal, ... we were particularly happy with not encountering any traffic while getting around in our rental car. The bed was firm but very comfortable and the shower had good flow and drainage. We enjoyed the access to a balcony on the evenings."
1556170,37093591,2015-07-04,4690472,Max,"Everything exactly as described, the place is clean and new, spacious and with a comfortable bed.  We went in summer and with no air conditioner it was kind of hot.

Downtown is 10 minutes away using the Link Light train in Beacon Hill."
1556170,38045521,2015-07-12,9412471,Rachel,"This apartment is extremely convenient for public transit and is super clean. It is probably the cleanest place I have stayed via Airbnb. And the pictures are very accurate. This is truly a nice place to stay. There were more than enough towels, blankets, and fans (it was quite warm when I visited - what a life saver!)

Kitchen is fully stocked with dinnerware, nice appliances, big refrigerator, etc. If you are looking for a week long place to rent, this is the place to be. I am not terribly picky, but other homes I have rented had very old, dirty appliances. There is a fire station on the corner. If you are a light sleeper it would be worth bringing some ear plugs.  I only remember hearing a fire truck once during my two night stay. The rest of the time it was very quiet in the neighborhood.

Anna checked in on us our first night and stayed out of our way. She seems kind and available in the event there are problems. Thinking back, I may have forgotten to clean something up in the kitchen. Hope she doesn't hold it against me!"
1556170,38477083,2015-07-16,6533040,Audrey,"From the beginning, Anna was a wonderful host.  My aunt and I wanted to book about five months in advance, so I appreciated that she has her calendar up to date and that she was quick to respond.  

The apartment is very ideally located for anyone wanting to be near downtown, without being too close to all the busyness of the city.  It was clean and light, just like the pictures show, and had everything we needed.  The light rail station down the road was so convenient for getting to/from the airport and into downtown, being about five stops away in both directions.  We had a car for a few days, and had no trouble getting around, and loved having a free parking space.

Any time I had questions, Anna always answered promptly and was extremely helpful.  She was even kind enough leave the fold-a-way bed with clean linens for me so my aunt could have the bed/bedroom to herself.  And since my aunt had an earlier flight than I did the day we left, Anna let me keep my things at the apartment a little later than her usual check out time so I didn't have to tow my bags all over while I did a few last minute errands, which I was soo thankful for! 

Overall, we had a great stay at Anna's apartment, and I recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle! 
"
1556170,39004823,2015-07-20,33055206,Kristina,"Anna's place was perfect for our weekend stay in Seattle. We did not rent a car, so it was great to have a bus stop right outside the front door. The neighborhood was a little noisy with the fire station across the street, but it didn't bother us. I would absolutely recommend staying at Anna's apartment. She was easy to communicate with, her directions were easy to follow, and the apartment was very clean. Thank you, Anna! p.s if you're looking for a good restaurant in the area, I recommend The Oak (just a few blocks down the street)."
1556170,43028160,2015-08-17,4566190,Nino,"Nice place outside the busy-ness of the city, but still close enough to get to get into the city. Easy access with a direct bus which stops right outside the building, and also easy access to the airport via the train which was a quick bus ride (or you could do a 10 min walk). Supermarket near the train station was also handy.

Anna's place is exactly like in the photos and Anna was also quick to respond to questions through airbnb or sms which was also appreciated.

Thanks!"
1556170,43636134,2015-08-21,36145152,Daniel,"Amazing place in the right place , close to everything. Very clean .
The owner Anna helped me a lot!!!
Anna was always available for questions.
Place was clean like a new Appartment
10 minutes drive to downtown Seattle
Will love to come back to Anna's place
Top A+
Thank you Anna"
1556170,44274757,2015-08-25,90231,Jill,"The apartment was very clean, bright and spacious and as documented in the listing and all essentials were provided. The large fan was very necessary as the apartment heated up during the day. The location was near a busy intersection and so was noisy, as was Seattle in general to our ears.  The environment was pleasant with a large park closeby and Italian, Mexican and Phillipino restaurants a short walk away. Bus stop was at the door and light rail station was accessible by bus or on foot. Stairs were not very suitcase-friendly.
"
1556170,46145236,2015-09-08,38492783,Maysam,The place was super close/convenient to downtown and the apartment was more than I was expecting. This was my first time using Airbnb and I intend on using it again.
1556170,47959482,2015-09-22,25559418,Lori,"I stayed here while visiting Seattle for a workshop at a studio in the Stadium area. The apartment's proximity to the light rail made it easy to get to where I needed to be each day and to get to downtown. The interior is exactly as it looks in the pictures. The apartment is remodeled and very clean. Anna was very helpful with tips for the area and answered questions quickly. 

I travel alone all the time so I'm used to paying special attention to my surroundings. The 10 min walk to the light rail station was no problem at all during the day, but I'm not sure how I would have felt walking around alone late at night. If I had not had friends drop me off each night, I likely would have taken an Uber versus the walk, but bus 36 does stop right in front of the apartment. The market right next to the rail station was nice for snacks. There were 3 or 4 cute restaurants nearby that I definitely would have tried had I not had plans downtown. They looked to be very popular. The park that is on the opposite corner from the apartment was hopping on Saturday morning with runners, walkers and youth sports. It was a nice place to get in a short run with a great view of the city. "
1556170,48893748,2015-09-29,15217410,Michelle,"I stayed at this apartment over a long weekend in September. This apartment is located fairly close to the airport, which was very appealing. There are several bars, restaurants, and cafes within walking distance. 

The apartment was clean and the host, Anna, was easy to communicate with. I would recommend this apartment. "
1556170,50438702,2015-10-12,10195361,Erin,"Working with Anna was wonderful. She was super accommodating and very helpful. My in-laws were visiting to meet our newborn and don't have much money to spend and Anna allowed them to check in for a couple of days and then stay with a relative in between and check back in for the remainder of their trip. She was lovely and always checked in with us to make sure they got in ok. The apartment is clean, in a wonderful location and easily walkable to restaurants, the light rail, the park, etc. I'd recommend this place for sure."
1556170,50858133,2015-10-15,210763,Wendy,"Apartment was exactly as listed. Everything was very clean; kitchen was outfitted with the basics. Conveniently located on a bus line; bus stops just outside the apartment. The traffic sounds are quite noticeable in the apartment, particularly in the living room, but I had no trouble sleeping at night. If you have a car, there is parking available behind the building.

Anna was an extremely responsive and thoughtful host."
1556170,52315570,2015-10-28,38483015,Jerry,"We really enjoyed the condo.  Anna answered all of my texts promptly and with excellent information.  Condo was spotless when we entered.  My wife commented that she didn't think anyone had ever stayed there.  It looked exactly like the pictures online.  It is located in an older neighborhood, but a clean one.  A little noisy due to traffic, but we live by a busy street so that didn't bother us at all.  Just a couple of suggestions:  A TV channel lineup would have been helpful.  Also an extra blanket in the colder months.  And a pen and some paper would have been nice.  We discovered a great shortcut to the downtown area avoiding the freeway, and we loved that.  It took us right by the two sports fields on the way.  All in all it was much more fun than a motel.  We love Seattle!"
8072850,45880464,2015-09-06,42874379,David,"I spent 4 nights here and had a great time.  The room was clean and lined with art, the bed was comfy, and the hospitality was awesome!"
8072850,47820426,2015-09-21,16042572,Ivar,"We had a great stay here. Quiet neighbourhood, relatively central. Easy street parking. The room is big, with its own bathrom and entrance. Meg and the others were very friendly and helpful. "
3630581,17299677,2014-08-10,15183672,Ping-Kwan,"This apartment was close to the University of Washington, restaurants, bars, and bus stops on University Way NE. The room was big and very clean when I arrived. The room did get very warm during my stay for a couple of days during a heat wave.

Melissa was a great host and responded quickly to my emails and calls. Check-in and check-out was easy.

I feel this was a better deal for staying near the UW campus than the hotel that was nearby."
3630581,19131905,2014-09-07,18296667,Betty,"Melissa was very responsive via the intercom outside the building when I arrived late Saturday afternoon. My room was not quite ready, but she had a room for me to wait in with television, etc. She came by the next day to check if everything was OK. 
       The apartment and furnishings were clean. During the stay Melissa brought by some things I needed.  I mentioned that I like having a small lamp by my bed to read before I go to sleep which she brought up for me.
       Any time that I have had concerns, she has answered very quickly by phone or text message. 
        I appreciated that it is close to stores, the bus line, etc.  My apartment faced Brooklyn.  Since it is on a  busy street and somewhat close to I-5, I heard traffic in early morning until late in the night. "
3630581,29895496,2015-04-13,30908390,Brian,"Our host was very responsive and able to accommodate our arrival on short notice. The check in system / key handoff she has is very easy. Good access to the University District, Trader Joes, cafe's, etc.

This unit is a basic landing spot in the heart of the U-District and is good for anyone that does not have a car and wants to walk or bike."
3630581,33997279,2015-06-03,15786738,Sarah,"Melissa was a great host. She was very easily reached by email and phone. The apt was very basic, but fit my needs. The neighborhood is in the heart of a very busy neighborhood in Seattle. It was convenient to get around, and felt relatively safe late at night."
3630581,34663031,2015-06-10,4540172,Matthew,"Melissa was very helpful in helping my solve my parking situation. The apartment was well kept and clean. Nice, big desk for getting some work done."
3630581,35079288,2015-06-15,15792437,Loree,The apartment was exactly as described. The host was responsive when we had questions or issues.  We were glad to be in such a great location - the heart of the U-District - for our daughter's graduation from college.  
3630581,35426231,2015-06-18,35282354,Hang,"This place is really close to the UW, clean and tidy with a kitchen if you feel like cooking. "
3630581,35685548,2015-06-21,33890869,Ning,"Very close to the UW, lots of restaurant, easy access to bus. Anyway, the smell in the building was not good, the furniture was too old.  If you want stay alone in university district, it will be a right place. But if you want spend some time with the house owner and share the local experience, not this."
3630581,46165324,2015-09-08,40542098,Jonathan,"Melissa was available to let us in and give a quick tour of the room. The facility came as described, including towels and soap/shampoo. She was also accessible and responsive via text messages. Very professional. The neighborhood felt very safe."
7844444,43577811,2015-08-20,26030561,Cecilia,"Tara was very accomodating! We had a change of schedule and she was willing to work with us. Thanks, Tara!"
7844444,43734115,2015-08-21,1181586,Eli,Tara was very friendly and welcoming and gave excellent instructions on how to get into the place.  Made herself available for any questions/concerns.  Location is really pretty stellar.  
7844444,43878853,2015-08-22,3826626,Molly,Tara was very responsive with my questions and directions on getting to the apt. We stayed only one night and the apt was sufficient. Street parking is relatively easy to find.
7844444,44361874,2015-08-25,38458385,Nikita,"Great, cozy apartment with a helpful host. Tara was very nice and had a well thought out plan ahead of time for me to obtain the key, as well as to return it after my stay. The apartment was great for a single person or a group, very homey. Also in a nice neighborhood - right by the lake and with a local bar and convenience shop around the corner.  Pleasant walk to downtown. Stay here, have a great time!"
7844444,44486391,2015-08-26,16238488,Michael,Tara's apartment is in an amazing place in Seattle. Less than a block from Voxx Coffee and near beautiful Lake Union it really is in a fantastic location. The apartment has a great deal of potential to be a very fine place as well.
7844444,45350795,2015-09-01,10798771,Patrick,Tara was very quick to respond and the directions for entry and access was easy to understand. The studio was VERY basic and description should possibly be revised. 
6913706,36250516,2015-06-26,36569489,Stephanie,My stay was amazing.  They even included a bottle of wine.  The real thing is even better than the pictures 
6913706,36613527,2015-06-29,36328876,Junie,We enjoyed stay here and very nice location for me as well.
6913706,37812871,2015-07-10,2929116,Vanessa,"My boyfriend and I were here for the week on business and this was PERFECT. Eve was very friendly and available if we had any snags, not that there were any :-) The space is fantastic and comfortable, quiet, and clean, not to mention the fact that the location is extremely accessible to pretty much everything. I love being able to walk everywhere! We'll definitely be booking with Eve when we're back"
6913706,38429432,2015-07-15,36940134,Tim,"Very nice place, very nice neighborhood. Host was very courteous and helpful. Would recommend to anyone! "
6913706,38887332,2015-07-19,4144395,Brenna,"We had a great stay here. The location was beyond perfect, the building was nice, everything was clean, the apartment was very quiet with a comfortable bed and good size bathroom. Eve and Michael were very accommodating and attentive. I would highly recommend them and their properties. "
6913706,39660860,2015-07-25,8073812,Benjamin,"This apt is ideal.  Wonderful hosts, convenient location, clean space, and good features.
Don't hesitate to stay here."
6913706,40117484,2015-07-28,36294641,Erica,"Eve's apartment was in a great location in downtown Seattle just a 5-10 minute walk to the Space Needle. The block the apartment building was on had a whole foods close by, a bakery and sandwich shop so food was very accessible. The interior of the unit was very nice and clean. The weekend we stayed was pretty warm so the air conditioner was nice to have. Checkin and check out was also very easy. The only downside I would say is the bed. For our preference it was not very comfortable (pretty hard mattress) and the pillows we all soft/down pillows. We did ask Eve after the first night we stayed if she had extra pillows/firmer pillows but she did not respond to our email request until after we had checked out three days later. Overall, a good stay. "
6913706,41101706,2015-08-04,36558264,Beth,This home was perfect and I would definitely stay there again! The pictures are very accurate.  I was impressed and completely satisfied.  There were four of us staying here for 6 days.  The location is also fantastic- you are very centrally located.  We rarely needed to use our rental car.  Parking was not difficult on the street.  I highly recommend this beautiful location!  Our host made us feel welcome and was very accommodating. 
6913706,41395961,2015-08-07,3210475,Laura,Great floor plan in a convenient location! Stayed here with my husband and kids for central location in a stylish spot. The host was gracious enough to meet us after hours to let us in. We were comfortable and had a great time! 
6913706,41777508,2015-08-09,22331871,Abbey,"Morgan was incredibly communicative and helpful throughout the process. She provided detailed instructions, checked in both leading up to and during our stay, and overall was a truly excellent host. We would stay with her again in a heartbeat!"
6913706,44935647,2015-08-30,28375635,Mayumi,"very clean and spacious apartment, nicely furnished, has all the essentials, nice deck and convenient location. Morgan was very accommodating, and easy to reach, overall great stay"
6913706,45393832,2015-09-02,17729165,Demetrius,"This apartment was swanky and seated in the heart of Westlake/South Lake Union, a perfect location that is pretty much close to everything (the Seattle Center, downtown, Capitol Hill) but just quiet enough for a relaxing stay.  The apartment is as pictured and Morgan was an excellent host, leaving a bottle of wine and some chocolates along with a nice note to welcome.  Though we don't drink, my boyfriend and I loved the thought.  The building is across the street from Whole Foods, near some very nice restaurants and shops and has a really nice gym in it. "
6913706,46324093,2015-09-09,23509150,Lori,"Very much enjoyed our stay, location terrific, very nice place overall. Were extremely flexible about possible late check in time (not needed after all and brought keys to us at my daughter's place as we were unloading uhaul nearby); they also allowed us to add extra night after we checked in. Very clean and pictures/description very accurate. Great to be just steps away from Whole Foods and so central to cool places in Seattle. Bed not as comfortable as I expected. I usually am fine with firmer beds (but sleep on tempurpedic), however my husband slept fine. Free parking was always available on the block, never had to pay during 4 days we stayed. Would consider staying here again (especially if they add memory foam topper!)"
6913706,46771622,2015-09-13,74227,John David,"Terrific host and the apartment are fantastic. I used to live in Seattle bu I hadn't been there for some years. It is amazing how much this neighbourhood changed in the last five years. Cafe, walking streets, shops all within a few blocks. There is a Whole Foods half a block away! The apartment itself is located right in the heart of it all and was absolutely perfect. I would without reservation take the place again. One of the best parts was the amazing 1gig Internet connection. "
6913706,47316504,2015-09-17,43878972,Eric,"Excellent representation, perfect living space, and highly organized check=in/check-out"
6913706,47900071,2015-09-21,356784,Shannon,Apartment was exactly as described.  Very clean!  The water pressure in the shower was wonderful.  Bed was comfortable.  The unit was very quiet.  Loved that it was a block away from Whole Foods.  There is a parking garage under the building but it can get pricey.  We used street parking.  I didn't need to contact Daniela with any issues but she checked in with us to make sure everything was okay.  I'd stay here again.
6913706,49635204,2015-10-05,42513898,Kristin,"We had such a great time at 98 Walkscore!  Daniela and Michael made it super easy to find the location, and gave detailed instructions regarding parking, entering the building, and providing a wonderful space for us to stay.  This place is probably the best location you can find in Seattle.  Great neighborhood, close to all attractions!  Hosts were fast responding on a couple questions we had about Apple TV that they had, and were a pleasure to speak with.  Would definitely stay here again if we come back."
6913706,50876425,2015-10-15,22458501,Adrian,"Daniela is the best host! She is such a good host that I always get the same apartment she hosts. The apartment is always clean! I always do the self-check in and Daniela makes sure that I'm always comfortable in the apartment. They always leave me a wine in the apartment, which I think is a really nice touch. I'm very grateful that I found this apartment and Daniela as such an excellent host.
I definitely recommend Daniela as a host and I will definitely continue renting the airbnb."
6913706,53138626,2015-11-05,22458501,Adrian,"I always feel very welcomed by Jocelyn, Daniela & Michael. They are always very attentive and helpful. The apartments are always very clean and the pictures are 100% accurate. For these reasons and many more I'll definitely keep renting their apartments."
6913706,53853394,2015-11-13,4626228,Antonio,"The apartment is perfectly located walking distance from city centre and had amazing restaurants and bars.  the area has a working professional vibe and is very laid back.

Jocelyn is am excellent communicator and went out of her way to make me feel at home.  Great place to stay i highly recommend it"
8597800,49579177,2015-10-04,8618406,Karen,"We were Joan's first guests, and she was an excellent host! We got to the apartment a little later than expected and she was very easy-going about it. When we arrived, we were floored by how beautiful and modern the apartment is. The pictures do not do it justice. The entire basement suite is private with its own bathroom and organic shampoo and conditioner. The bed was super comfortable with some extra cozy blankets in case we needed some. Parking was a breeze- we could park on the street or right in front of Joan's place. We especially loved Joan's cat, Cheeto, who is a real sweetie. We didn't have a chance to experience Columbia City nightlife, but enjoyed walking around its charming neighborhood on a Sunday afternoon-- brunch at Geraldine's and iced coffee from Columbia City bakery (recommended by Joan). In all, it was an awesome place to stay, and we would recommend it to anyone wanting to check out a cute neighborhood in Seattle. "
8597800,54077774,2015-11-15,16113799,Forrest,"Joan's place was waaaaaaay bigger than expected. The pictures do not do justice to the amount of space that you have to utilize. The bed was ridiculously comfortable too!  Also, huge shower with instant hot water!  Definitely worth staying here. "
8597800,55826663,2015-12-06,14444135,Eve,"Joan and Ross were great hosts. Joan was really responsive to my messages with questions before the trip and they were really flexible. Although I didn't end up meeting Joan in person because she was under the weather, Ross showed me around and was very friendly. Their place is new and beautiful. The guest space - including private connected bathroom - is the entire bottom floor so it's very private. At the same time, they were very open to my using the shared kitchen or living room if I wanted. The location is very residential and quiet. Short walk to the heart of Columbia City, somewhat far from light rail, but still walking distance (maybe 15-20 mins)."
1983713,12024155,2014-04-21,4289562,Marc And Katherine,"Thank you Scott for your kind words, we would love to stay in touch.
I didn't know we got reviewed as well?? hahah ...
This too was out first time using AirBnB, we have heard so much about it from friends that finally we tied it out. 
Scott was a great first host. Loving this personal care, trust and sharing I must say. 
Scotts little place is great….Located on a lovely street, close to a bus stop that has the most stunning views over Lake Washington.... Loved it the moment I walked in… for something as small it felt spacious as there are french doors opening out onto a private patio… which gets the sunshine, when it shines, with a natural tree view and squirrels to watch as they play. The fire pit was tempting but the rain kind of didn't support that idea, next cool season however, whoever gets that chance will love it.
The kitchen was brilliantly equipped, except for a kettle ??!! I was able to cook anything I fancied.. and i did. top notch. I luckily brought my own kettle with me as I love my cup of tea and so I was set. I do recommend Scott for you to perhaps get a kettle for those English or Canadian guests who love their tea. 
The bed was comfy….careful of your shins on the corners though when walking around the bed… we both got it. The shower was great too… ..all in all we really enjoyed our stay…thank you Scott, you were personable, friendly and helpful where needed. We would have stayed on longer if it had been free, alas others booked it up.
Yes we would highly recommend this lovely private place to stay when visiting Seattle."
1983713,13611300,2014-06-01,5532014,Chuck,"We stayed at Peaceful Retreat in the City for one month.  It was the perfect location in a great neighborhood to look for permanent housing as we were making the transition to Seattle. The unit is very private and thoughtfully planned out and includes everything you need, even a washer and dryer. The bed is very comfortable and the kitchen is well equipped, including a dishwasher.  We enjoyed relaxing evenings by the fire pit sipping wine. There are great restaurants, bus stops, parks and trails within walking distance. Scott was a great host and we would definitely recommend staying at Peaceful Retreat in the City."
1983713,16709215,2014-08-01,15083283,Sarah,"Scott was extremely responsive to all our questions and requests. The rental looks exactly like the pictures, modern and nicely furnished, with a lovely yard area. I will note that the unit has a roof deck on top for the use of the front house, and very occasionally (about 4 times during our two month stay) there was quite a bit of stomping around late at night. The neighborhood is very peaceful, we enjoyed the local coffee shop and we found it easy to use the bus line a few blocks away to get around.  I will definitely be recommending this listing to friends and family. "
1983713,41636415,2015-08-08,37510988,Tianyi,"Scott and his daughter were very friendly and the room was clean. Location is great, just 15 mins driving from downtown but very quiet. great location!"
1983713,45379194,2015-09-02,1335943,Natalie,"We had a lovely time at this rental.  The neighborhood is very nice, it's really pleasant to walk around.  The rental was clean and cozy, we came with our 10 month old son, so for any parents traveling just know that you can fit one of those pack'n play cribs just fine in the bedroom!  The patio is great for a glass of wine in the evenings too!"
1983713,46137472,2015-09-08,11671641,Sasha,"This space was absolutely wonderful and Scott was a great host - we felt like we had our own private getaway in Seattle.  The space was very modern, clean and comfortable.  We loved the big windows in the living space.  The location is only 10 minutes from downtown and most major attractions, yet we felt like we could get away from the bustle of the city at night.  We would recommend Scott's place to anyone visiting Seattle!  "
1983713,47174729,2015-09-16,25470912,Misha,"Our recent stay at the Peaceful Retreat was nice; we were met upon arrival by Skip who made sure we had what we needed.  The in-law style unit is well equipped and spacious with a private entrance and walkway, you don't really see anyone from the main house.  The neighborhood is wonderful- there are three decent restaurants and two great places for coffee- all within a short walk.  You can also  walk to the lake through one of many parks where there is a running/biking trail that is beautiful. We lucked out on the weather, which was sunny, and were able to run every day.  The only issue we had was with some work being performed on the back retaining wall (right outside the main window) that Skip warned us about (scheduled last minute due to weather); the situation was less than ideal in terms of privacy, so we let Skip know we were a bit uncomfortable- he resolved the issue as best he could and we were happy with the outcome. "
1983713,48012856,2015-09-22,42914467,Daniel,"The house was great! Scott was a great host and greeted us upon our arrival. He was very accommodating and was even able to help us out to bring us skewers because we wanted to roast some sausage over the fire at night.  

The house itself is great.  Prefect for 2 people.  Very clean and spacious."
1983713,49328650,2015-10-03,20658274,Flip,"Although we never had a chance to meet Skip (he and his daughter were traveling during the seven days we spent at his apartment), he made us feel welcome by checking in frequently to make sure we were having a good experience. He also offered to have someone come to welcome us. We arrived to find a nice bottle of red wine that he had left for us, which we thought was very nice!"
1983713,50515554,2015-10-12,37116539,Shane,"Excellent apartment in a beautiful neighbourhood. Host was very nice and came down to chat to us after check in. He gave us tips on where to visit in Seattle, tips on some nice restaurants and on public transport around Seattle. Would definitely visit again! "
1983713,51179748,2015-10-18,41312395,Heidi,GREAT PLACE!!! Clean and had all the necessities! Very nice and modern getaway after a long day from downtown Seattle! Nearby local restaurants and bus stops! Made it very easy for us to get around :) A must stay when visiting Seattle!
1983713,52408244,2015-10-29,37147390,Stefan,"My husband and I stayed in Peaceful Retreat in the City when we visited our son in Seattle. We will definitely come back. Our host Scott was great. He was in contact during our stay to make sure we had everything we needed and to answer questions. We also had the chance to meet him. The place and location was exactly as advertised and very clean. It was nice having a full kitchen and washer/dryer.  It's a quiet location. Don't be fooled by the map because it looks like it's right next to the interstate. In that neighborhood, I90 is underground, so the place was very quiet. It was central to most areas in Seattle and east, so it was easy to get on all the interstates and a short ride to downtown. Thank you Scott for a great week!"
1983713,57652093,2015-12-28,13600764,Robin,"My parents stayed with Skip over Christmas (writing a review on their behalf, per their comments) and really enjoyed their stay. The location was perfect, the place was super tidy and well stocked, the bed was comfy, and the floors were warm! Skip met my parents the evening that they arrived when he popped by to day hi - they noted that he was super friendly. My folks will definitely consider staying at this location in the future. I think that the only downside for my parents was that they like a colorful place and - while well decorated - the tones of this airbnb are gray/modern. Personal preference, I suppose!"
4623541,23961566,2014-12-15,23988200,Niki,"This was a great location. The house was cozy. We had a great time here with many things in walking distance. Laura was a great help and very quick to respond with any questions we had. Thank you Laura:)
"
4623541,24548772,2014-12-30,5387378,Jaime,"Our stay in Laura's flat was perfect.  The location was amazing, Capitol Hill is a great neighborhood and it's an easy walk to downtown Seattle as well.  The place was clean, plenty of towels and bedding and everything you could want in the kitchen!  Easy getting in and out and Laura was very responsive when we had questions.  I'd recommend this place to anyone!"
4623541,24755251,2015-01-02,24385620,Katie,"Great location on capitol hill, very accommodating and responds really fast. Place looks exactly like pictures."
4623541,34888887,2015-06-13,30922825,Novis,"Laura was great, easy to work with & very helpful. Would absolutely work with her again :) "
4623541,35322167,2015-06-17,17784482,Samantha,"We had a wonderful stay at this cozy house! My family and my brothers family came to seattle for a family vacation with the kids and we had a blast! The location was great with a nice little coffee shop right around the corner, trader joes a couple blocks away and the bus line literally drops you off right in front of the house. Each day we would walk about 25 mins to downtown, pikes place, space needle etc. and then just ride the bus back to avoid the uphill climb. The beds were super comfortable with amazing soft sheets! The showers were great and well stocked, each room has a bathroom and shower, the upstairs was very bright and spacious with a little half bathroom so you didnt need to walk downstairs to go. We had small children so we barricaded the stairs but had no problems at all. Laura was super friendly and very prompt with responses. We will most certainly stay here again and again and I would recommend her place to anyone! It felt like home! :)"
4623541,36295494,2015-06-27,33765878,Yuliani,I did not meet the host when I came. The host just left a message about how to get into the apt. 
4623541,36692837,2015-06-30,16295843,Susana,"Laura made sure we arrived and checked in safely. She made sure we knew that if we had any questions, she was just a phone call/email away. The house was exactly as described and very cozy! We loved that everything was walking distance. I would definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Seattle!"
4623541,37661524,2015-07-09,2656683,Elizabeth," Laura's apartment was as described: Spacious and in a great central location.   Check in and out was easy, and questions were answered by email in a timely manner.  We happened to be there on the hottest day of the year, but fans were there to cool it down a little.    The apartment, because it is centrally located, is on a busy street and with windows open, it is noisy, so bring your earplugs.  The apartment was well supplied with condiments, etc.  I would definitely stay there again."
4623541,37982460,2015-07-12,13349459,Jing,"We had a great stay at this place.  Laura was very responsive and gave clear instructions and followed up to make sure we had a good stay.  The apartment is very spacious and clean.  Seattle was the last stop of our trip and my parents said I reserved the best to the last :-)  It is fairly close to all the sights.  We have a car (no problem parking) so location is ideal for us.  Overall, we had a very pleasant stay.  Thank you Laura. "
4623541,38394572,2015-07-15,33758784,Tara,"The place was very clean and instructions to enter her flat were very clear. We would definitely stay there again if we visited Seattle again
The location is a bit noisy at time, but as the flat was so good we didn't mind.
"
4623541,39013966,2015-07-20,34125832,James,"Great location, even better accommodations. Clean, spacious, and generally very cool spot. Laura was welcoming, flexible, and communicative. This was our first try with airbnb and it couldn't have went better. "
4623541,39798232,2015-07-26,20121477,Meredith,"Beautiful home and perfect for two couples or more.  Great space for cooking and relaxing, excellent balcony and wonderful light.  Good location too-- a bit off the beaten path of Capitol hill but nice that it's not in a crowded area. "
4623541,41080658,2015-08-04,34274221,Chris,"My host made it super easy for me to get into her home and I felt totally welcome & it was exactly as described with everything one would need for a comfortable stay.  It is situated on top of a hill halfway between lake Washington & downtown, a perfect neighborhood with easy bus access and two great markets a few blocks away.  I would most definitely stay there again!"
4623541,41944392,2015-08-10,33610815,Evan,"This place is awesome. It is very spacious, easily able to fit four guests.  The place is clean, well kept, and nicely decorated. 

The surrounding area has a TON of quality restaurants within walking distance, making it very convenient to explore and enjoy a bit of the neighborhood.

Laura is personable and prompt in her communication. I highly recommend both the unit and house!"
4623541,42407943,2015-08-13,10365037,Alex,"This place was great! It was SO roomy and spacious for three guests. We loved the porch outside that overlooked the sunrise and we really loved that Laura had extra things available for her guests (e.g., soap, shampoo/conditioner, and other toiletry items). The beds were very comfortable and it was great to have access to a washer and dryer. The place was a few minutes walk to a number of bars and restaurants and extremely close to a bus station, which was very convenient. 

Laura was very accommodating and provided great instructions about the location, check-in, and check-out. She was very responsive and we appreciated all of her help. I would definitely stay here again when I return to Seattle! "
4623541,43043492,2015-08-17,26882232,Daisy,"Loved Laura's place. Conveniently located, walking distance, by the bars in Capitol Hill. Cozy place, two floors, with a nice view from the balcony. "
4623541,43690797,2015-08-21,28013758,Mark,"Excellent experience from start to finish! The house was in a great location and was very spacious, so perfect for our group of 5. Laura was a great host and made accessing the apartment a piece of cake! 5 stars!"
4623541,44771174,2015-08-29,5754104,Danny,"The host super quick to answer any questions we had. I loved how close the location was to everything we needed to do in the rest of Seattle, and the place itself was spotless."
4623541,45704523,2015-09-05,4610735,Brittany,"Laura's home was inviting and gave us plenty of room. We were initially suppose to stay with another couple but they canceled last minute so we had the whole place to ourselves. Even if our friends had come, we would have had plenty of room. Both the bedrooms have an attached private bathroom. The kitchen was stocked with plenty of cooking utensils and allowed us to save some money by cooking our own meals. The neighborhood was a quick walk to Capitol Hill, downtown busses, and a Trader Joes. This place was a great price for it's value."
4623541,46300255,2015-09-09,16868215,Nipuna,My experience at Laura's place was really great throughout the stay. I was pleasantly surprised how close to most of the attractions in the city of Seattle. Really great location. Everything at the house was great and there was plenty of amenities for us to use. The house was also bigger than I thought it would be! Great place for a family to spend a few days in Seattle. 
4623541,51612167,2015-10-22,40981196,Lander,"This is the perfect place to start looking for an apartment in Seattle. We stayed here a month and immediately felt at home. The view from the many windows is amazing: you see Mount Rainier, Redmond and the cascade range. Capitol hill is in walking distance so you have a big choice of restaurants and nightlife without the noise when you need to sleep. If you want to cook yourself: the indoor grill is perfect! Beds were really comfortable. 

Highly recommended, actually cheaper than renting a two bedroom apartment in the surroundings.."
4623541,52944980,2015-11-02,43516396,Grace,"Laura's house is lovely and really spacious! The beds were comfortable and it was really convenient to have a bathroom for each BR (stayed with my husband and 12 yo daughter). It was close to a lot of good restaurants and bars, and a short walk to trader joe's. Parking was easy as well. Laura was very easy to reach and she gets back to you quick. Would love to stay here again and I definitely recommend! "
4623541,54877752,2015-11-25,3016630,Antoinette,Laura's place was great! Exactly as seen in the description (if not more beautiful). Saw a beautiful sunrise from the balcony. Ended up renting a car and there was ample parking in the area. It was a wonderful trip. 
4623541,55397842,2015-12-01,46571891,Jackie,"Laura's place was very spacious, was in a great location, and had wonderful views of the mountains. The walkability was amazing and there were lots of restaurants near by. Very easy instructions to get into the place, I would definitely stay here again. "
4623541,55909700,2015-12-07,45353346,Stephen,"Laura's place was BEAUTIFUL and SPACIOUS! Exactly as described. Beautiful view from the living room of the mountains. Had a rental car and did not have any problems parking.  The place had more than enough room, everything was provided per the listing.  Would stay with Laura again if the need arises."
2825852,14917664,2014-06-29,15262165,Molly,"Miranda and Michael were very accommodating and welcoming hosts. The apartment was exactly how the pictures show it to be, bright, clean and well furnished.  I stayed there with my boyfriend for a month and it was not only the perfect location to our work in Lower Queen Anne, but also the mid-point between Pike Place and Capitol Hill.  The apartment was also in a very safe and residential location. The apartment complex's pool and rooftop were both amazing perks to this rental.  We highly recommend this apartment and any rental from Miranda and Michael. Enjoy! "
2825852,15149094,2014-07-03,6589111,Svein,Mike and Miranda was very responsive and got me into the apartment even though I was one day delayed.  The apartment was great and met all my needs.
2825852,15266918,2014-07-06,15877759,Wendy,"Although the hosts were out of town, they arranged for a friend to meet us with the keys. He was very welcoming and inviting! The place was exactly as described.  
We had an overall great time.  "
2825852,15499761,2014-07-10,181085,Brent,"This place was great!  It was super convenient and centrally located.  Miranda was very receptive, helpful, and easy to get in contact with.   Thanks so much!"
2825852,15653757,2014-07-13,3378558,Thawan,The location is good and the apartment is in great condition. I enjoyed staying as well because of the view. The host is friendly and quite flexible with check-in time. 
2825852,16088111,2014-07-22,5708503,Robert,"The unit was exactly as described. Clean, easy access, and a great location in town, close too all attractions. Great for anyone who visits Seattle. We had a great stay.  "
2825852,16348903,2014-07-26,13648452,David,Incredible location and fabulous apartment with great views! I will definitely try and stay here whenever I visit Seattle. 
2825852,16552645,2014-07-29,10928249,Jeremy,"The apartment was great and everything was as described.  The location was walkable to all central sites, or you can take an Uber for around $5-7.  The pool/hot tub was a nice option as the weather was warm and sunny during our stay.

For breakfast Top Pot donuts is right up the road and there is also a great French bakery on Madison street.  Sushi lovers should check out Shiro's in Belltown!

Owners were great to work with and were very responsive to all our questions and logistics!"
2825852,17045182,2014-08-06,16013718,Donna,"Miranda was a great host and was in constant communication with us from booking until our arrival. During our stay, she was very accommodating and provided us with extra linens as soon as we requested them.  The apartment was very clean and well equipped with everything you could possibly need, and the champagne in the fridge on arrival was a lovely touch! You couldn't ask for a better location, near Pike's Place, convention center, movies, restaurants and tons of shopping! You could probably walk to Pike's Place, but we didn't because the hills are really steep!

The building was very quiet and the view was amazing, overall we had a very enjoyable experience and would stay again if ever in Seattle.
"
2825852,17229905,2014-08-09,9335481,Alan,"This is a terrific apartment in a great location. It's very convenient both to the touristy parts of Seattle (e.g., Pike Place) as well as some great bars and restaurants to the east. Although there's no A/C, the breeze from the high floor balconies are great and Miranda quickly brought us a fan when we asked for one. A great place and one I would happily go back to next time I'm in Seattle."
2825852,17749346,2014-08-17,5340327,Vanessa,"We had a wonderful stay at Mike and Miranda's apartment. It was in an amazing location a few blocks away from all the sites. Very easy access, very clean and comfortable. The pool was a added bonus as the weather was hot while we were there. We also used the gym that has everything you need to get a good work out in. I would highly recommend this apartment to anyone who is visiting Seattle. Mike and Miranda were very personable and nice. The check in and check out went so smoothly without a hitch. I highly recommend this apartment! We had an amazing stay!"
2825852,18019159,2014-08-20,17225332,Angie,"I was a wonderful experience staying at Miranda's place. The location is especially good - just 5minutes walk from the city shopping center. Clean and pretty one bedroom. It might be a little bit noisy if your are sensitive to sound (apartment by the highway),  but my experience was really good."
2825852,18562451,2014-08-28,18361337,Samantha,"Miranda and Mike were wonderful hosts! Check in and check out was very easy and stress free. The apartment was lovely, clean and very nicely located in the beautiful city of Seattle. It more than suited my needs. Thank you for everything guys! I hope to stay again for a longer period of time!"
2825852,18789227,2014-09-01,16094826,David,"Listing was completely accurate. The place was fantastic. Beautiful space, completely clean and fresh, and superbly convenient. Communications with the hosts was great - quick responses to any questions you might have."
2825852,18987007,2014-09-04,17596982,Blair,"Mike and Miranda's place was great. The location is perfect, as it is an easy walk to downtown shopping, bars, sightseeing. Everything was clean and check in/out was quick and easy. Miranda even checked in to make sure I had everything I needed."
2825852,19670519,2014-09-16,16650850,Mary,"Miranda was accommodating and approved an early check-in. A chilled bottle of Prosecco, as well as, water was waiting for us. Bobby, a good friend of Miranda's, was the friendly face who greeted us in front of the building. He touched base with us regarding any needed supplies during our week long stay. The bathroom was well-stocked with shampoo/ conditioner/ soap. Seeing the Seattle skyline, as soon as we entered the front door, was a welcome respite after a tiring day of walking up and down the hills. Michael provided a duplicate key and solved dilemma of meeting w/ family members living in Seattle w/o a cell phone. We enjoyed our Seattle visit, made more comfortable by an airbnb stay, complete with the conveniences of a home, instead of a hotel. "
2825852,20010313,2014-09-22,5228063,Raina,"We had a fantastic time at Miranda's place while we were in Seattle. The location was perfect walking distance to so many neighborhoods. The apartment was clean and comfortable and getting and returning the key was easy. The apartment building itself is older and could use some updating, but we were always glad to wake up to that view."
2825852,20666096,2014-10-03,17519869,Vanessa,"Miranda was a wonderful host! She met us at check-in and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. 
The apartment had a good view to downtown and was clean. We did find it a bit old and noisy. 
But overall we had a nice stay.
Thank you, Miranda, for all your tips :)"
2825852,20923221,2014-10-07,412810,Nicole,Great location and Miranda made the whole stay seamless.
2825852,21133400,2014-10-12,295791,Jeric,"Miranda & Mike were very gracious hosts. They allowed us to check-in early and check-out late. Upon arrival there were champagne and chocolates waiting for us! Mike even drove us to the Pike Place Market.
The apartment is very close to the downtown area. Many excellent restaurants and shopping places are located nearby. 
The only not so positive thing was the slow internet service. Mike, however, is working on this.
Overall, we had a lovely stay at this young couple's place. Highly recommended!"
2825852,21428248,2014-10-17,18919544,Tasha,This was our first Airbnb experience and it exceeded any expectation we had. Miranda and Mike were both so great with communication leading up to our trip with answering all and any questions we had. Once we got to their apt in downtown Seattle we were blown away by how beautiful and clean the apt was. It was a perfect location to downtown and it made our first visit to Seattle an unforgettable one. The best thing is that they were call/text away anytime we had a question regarding the accommodations. We are already planning our next visit and we will definitely be staying at one of their apts! Thanks again!
2825852,21549924,2014-10-19,22175645,Manali,Miranda was an amazing host. She made us feel at home. The apt had all amenities and was walking distance to many restaurants and shops. she was very helpful and quick to respond. It was my first time using Airbnb and I would definitely stay here again!
2825852,21723419,2014-10-22,19579766,Tricia,This was our first Airbnb experience and we approached with mild expectations. Turned out to be a very pleasant experience and property was as described just off the downtown area. Mike and Miranda were quick to respond when needed and Uber transportation alternative was excellent!
2825852,22269987,2014-11-02,8618970,Victor,Miranda was very nice and accommodating.  The apartment was comfortable and had everything that I needed.  It really felt like I was home in another city.
2825852,22450024,2014-11-06,6951356,John,Miranda and Mike were great hosts for this unit in downtown Seattle. I was impressed by the convenient location and the flexibility of check in times. This unit was a much better option than the hotels I usually stay in around Seattle. The unit was well equipped and included a very comfortable bed and some of the softest towels I have ever used while traveling. 
2825852,22533196,2014-11-09,22173567,Felice,"MIranda was a great host and very accommodating. She let us know that if we need anything, that all we needed to do was just call her. She also responded very quickly as soon as we arrived to Seattle. 
The unit we stayed at was exactly how it was shown in the pictures and it was also a great location. We'll be definitely contacting Miranda next time we visit Seattle!  "
2825852,22735578,2014-11-13,22116306,Éric,"Miranda nous a accueilli avec  un immense sourire et beaucoup de gentillesse. L'appartement était exactement ce que nous en attendions , bien situé , propre et suffisamment équipé pour 2 personnes.
Super dans l'ensemble."
2825852,23686090,2014-12-08,1881412,Ali,"The entire stay was wonderful. Miranda is an incredibly gracious host, greeting me with chocolates and champagne. The building is very centrally located and has an amazing hot tub and roof deck that I enjoyed. I needed to stay close to the convention center and I could not have asked for a better location (less than a 3-4 minute walk). The building is secure. The bed was comfortable. The kitchen had everything you need. The views speak for themselves. All in all, an awesome stay. Miranda was also great with tips about places to go and restaurant recommendations. Better than most hotel concierges to be honest. Stay here, you will not regret it!"
2825852,23969550,2014-12-15,24329851,Jonathan,"This place is wonderful.  It's very centrally located in the middle of the city.  The living room and kitchen have great city views which look pretty great.  The rooftop deck is great with panoramic 360 views. I lift weights.  The gym doesn't have as much as a commercial gym, but it has a selection of weights and cardio machines. I used it every day and was satisfied with it.  The residents of the building are very nice. The hot tub is great! It was too cold to try the pool, but it looks very nice and lit up. I wouldn't think twice of taking it again provided the opportunity. "
2825852,25169519,2015-01-08,21957703,Britt,"Miranda was a good host, and the apartment worked perfectly for our week-long visit for a meeting at the nearby convention center.  There were minor things that could have been better, but the apartment was generally spacious and clean, with a beautiful view of downtown.  The location was perfect - only a few blocks away from the convention center.  While staying here we felt like locals, with a great apartment only 5 minutes away by foot from the meeting venue.  I'd highly recommend this place for people visiting Seattle for a few days or more (especially those in town for work), who are looking to avoid being trapped in a sterile and cramped hotel room!  "
2825852,25440959,2015-01-16,23025587,James,"
I was in Seattle for a period of five days, mainly for business.  I knew that I would be spending a considerable amount of time working online, and thus hoped to find lodging that would somehow help me enjoy Seattle even while stuck inside.  When I saw Miranda and Mike's place at Airbnb, I grabbed it.

The view from the apartment is indeed fantastic, and I have no doubt that I accomplished more in my online work than I would have otherwise, simply because when I'd become bored of the work, I'd look up from my laptop to take in the Seattle skyline, a perfect momentary distraction.  Wheres typically when traveling I go to a coffee shop to work online for a few hours each day, on this trip I instead found myself wanting to stay at the apartment.

The apartment is spacious and well appointed.  The decor is a bit funky, but still I became fond of it. The building is quiet, and of course there is little street noise as the apartment is on the 13th floor.  

Miranda and Mike take seriously the comfort of their guests.  For example, having wine waiting after a long travel was much appreciated, as was having freshly ground coffee for the next morning.  Moreover, Miranda made a point of being present upon my arrival, to show me the place, to answer any questions I might have, and to convey their willingness to be contacted should I have questions later, either about the apartment or Seattle.

In all, I had a great stay.  I will definitely be looking to again rent this place when I next travel to Seattle. 
"
2825852,25581943,2015-01-19,26118493,Kevin,"Very nice place that suited my needs. Within walking distance to anywhere you would need to go or want to visit. Clean apartment as well. No complaints. Hosts were willing to offer suggestions as to transportation, food, sightseeing, etc. "
2825852,25861213,2015-01-27,2282835,Jean,"Miranda was a great host, and welcome us with champagne and chocolates. The place was very clean and just as pictured. I would be happy to stay again!"
2825852,26072053,2015-02-02,26224078,Angel,"Less than a mile from the pike, pretty much walking distance. Amazing view from the rooftop deck. Fresh towels and toilet paper. We just stocked the fridge with water and we were set. I wish this place has available parking. We rented a car and paid for parking directly across the apartment which is $16.00 a night plus taxes. I couldn't really find parking on the streets at all. Other than the parking, this is a really great location and nice apartment. Pictures are pretty accurate and would defiantly stay here again."
2825852,26277362,2015-02-08,16550931,Drew,"Nice arrangement, clean house, nice location, couldn't complain at all. Apple TV was a nice plus for the little downtime we had, but mostly we were out of the house the whole weekend. Thanks for the great stay! It was very comfortable. "
2825852,26645521,2015-02-16,27337574,Derek,The listing was very accurate! Our stay was very delightful and very easy walk to both pike place and Seattle aquarium. Miranda is a fantastic host! Great place to stay. 
2825852,27543314,2015-03-07,27479836,Gwenael,Everything was perfect during our stay. It is nice to feel welcome as we did in that  flat. As promised the view was amazing and the location was ideal.
2825852,28256957,2015-03-21,27314106,Ricardo,Great unit and experience! Everything was as described and Eve was a pleasure to work with. 
2825852,28717794,2015-03-29,3418700,Matthew,A very nice experience. Great location for what I needed. Easy check in and easy checkout. Thanks Eve for the place to stay. 
2825852,29750437,2015-04-12,28877903,Adam,"Super great and smooth experience. Eve is extremely communicative and helpful at ever step of the process. The unit was beautiful, clean, and welcoming as a visitor. Highly recommend this unit, and I will be staying here next time I am in Seattle!"
2825852,30498116,2015-04-23,28055052,Douglas,"Eve was great at communication both before, and after checkin. I had a few questions after looking around, and Eve got back to me immediately with the information. The apartment was just as described, and it fit my needs perfectly. Everything was clean and tidy. The bed was super comfy. I loved having the great views! Having a well-equipped fitness center in the building was a big plus for me. Great location, convenient to downtown, bus stops, and the Capitol Hill area. "
2825852,30727196,2015-04-26,11476668,Jeremy,"Eve was awesome (we didn't get an opportunity to meet Michael). Our flight landed really early relative to the standard check-in time, and Eve was more than accommodating on helping us get our bags put up early. I really appreciated that.

The apartment was spotless and very welcoming. The bed was really comfortable. I slept better than I have in a while. The view is really great as well. I didn't have anything to complain about.

The apartment is nicely removed from some of the downtown traffic, but still really close to everything. We walked to most places (Pike Place Market, Waterfront, etc.) and use Uber for the rest.

Other tenants in the building were incredibly friendly. "
2825852,31013025,2015-04-30,30015129,Saskia,"Great apartment and Eve was very helpful in getting everything arranged. Only downside is the apartment is pretty close to the i5 and can be a bit noisy outside but then being downtown in a big city, is is not unusual. Great location for everything downtown and everything is within walking distance. Eve was a fantastic host."
2825852,31260517,2015-05-03,4656502,Brooke,"Eve was wonderful. Easy to obtain the keys and an easy leave. She even brought us a bottle of wine and snacks, this touch was a very nice additional to our stay. 100% hospitable. "
2825852,31918261,2015-05-11,18079956,Siyuan,It's a good experience  in Eve's house. She is very fridendly and nice.
2825852,32974554,2015-05-24,11086709,Jens Christian,Every thing was as promised. It was a nice location only 5 min walking to downtown and 10 meters to coffee shop. 
2825852,33673347,2015-05-31,15955570,Yigit,"Great experience overall. Eve met me as soon as I arrived at the apartment. The place is clean, bright, and spacious. Though it can be somewhat noisy due to traffic, this is only a consideration if you are not used to big cities. The location is extremely close to the convention center and downtown, so I walked everywhere for the duration of my one week stay. Highly recommended. "
2825852,34531658,2015-06-09,30563380,Adam,Great apartment!  Eve is very accommodating and worked with us for an early check-in.  We loved the location.  Everything was nice and clean.  I had to contact Eve once during the duration of our stay and her response was prompt and helpful.  Very recommended!
2825852,34853516,2015-06-13,30006631,Sheren,"This is our first airbnb experience. And it is definitely an experience to learn from. But I'm happy to have experienced it with this location and with eve/michael. 

This place was wonderful. The location is the best part. We spent a lot of time downtown as well as belltown. It was accessible for bus, taxis, and walking. 

Eve was also great. She responded to text messages immediately. And did not waste time fixing a problem. She was professional and easy going. 

 "
2825852,35548816,2015-06-20,30499336,Judy,This was our first airbnb experience and our first visit to Seattle for a week. Both were great. Eve was great and responded quickly to text messages. The apt. was nice and so was the location. We had a great stay and highly recommend this place.
2825852,35968056,2015-06-23,27613667,Jordan,"Loved the apartment! We were in Seattle for 3 nights, 4 days, and we walked everywhere! Such a wonderful location! The apartment is clean, easy to get to, and has amazing views. I noticed a few had mentioned the noise but I found it to be quieter than other cities I've stayed in."
2825852,36383628,2015-06-28,31619127,Heidi,"Had a great time staying in Seattle, apt is close to lots of things. Was a little hot in the apt, but Eve was very accommodating and made sure to check up on how we were doing! Good restaurants are close by too!"
2825852,36968074,2015-07-03,34173066,Kanika,Fantastic experience at this downtown Seattle apartment. Great location and surprisingly good pool and gym facilities. 
2825852,38114905,2015-07-13,9424068,Tiffany,"Eve was great!  My husband and I stayed here for our Seattle wedding.  Great central location for Capital Hill, stadiums and waterfront.  Apartment was clean and comfortable.  Great views and quiet!"
2825852,38748659,2015-07-18,36621789,Mark,Eve was great to work with. The location of the apartment was great for a traveler.
2825852,39531180,2015-07-24,35923069,Marty,"This place is well-located and, with Eve, has great management.  She was very communicative and responsive to all my questions/concerns.  The unit itself was a bit ""worn"" -- carpet stained, paint cracked, etc. -- for its pricing at the time (I paid $219/night, before fees).  Eve said she'd take care of it and even offered a 10% refund, which she didn't have to do but did because she is fully focused on her guests' satisfaction.  I appreciated it and the unit now appears to be better priced.  Potential visitors should note its proximity to the freeway and its constant hum.  For some, that won't be an issue; for others, it might be."
2825852,40085090,2015-07-28,31516161,Brian,"The apartment was as advertised and is conveniently located. Morgan did a fine job of greeting us at check-in and provided helpful information about the apartment and the surrounding area.

I would recommend this apartment to anyone staying in the downtown Seattle area."
2825852,40611613,2015-08-01,36117697,Michael,"Overall we had an excellent experience with Eve's listing. Located in scenic high rise in downtown Seattle, this location is central to many popular tourist attractions, shopping and restaurants. The apartment itself was very accommodating! Eve was very responsive to any inquiries and checked in once in a while to make sure we had everything we needed. Thanks for being a great host!"
2825852,41328037,2015-08-07,7626847,Alexandra,The apartment is in a great location - walking distance to a variety of restaurants and shops as well as Pike Place.  Morgan was a wonderful host and promptly replied when we asked a few questions.  Thanks for hosting us!  
2825852,42116834,2015-08-11,31747568,Chris,The whole check-in process was great and the view was amazing. The room is very close to the city attractions and easily within walking distance of the train from the airport. Morgan and Eve made the whole process very easy. 
2825852,43248689,2015-08-18,37093453,Dorothy,"We had a great time. The apartment was spacious, clean and comfortable, and offered everything we needed. The location is perfect for exploring in Seattle. There were some minor issues with the building (the unlocking system for the front door wasn't working and repairs hadn't been completed by the time we left; windows were being replaced in the building, which caused quite a bit of noise one afternoon) but those were out of the control of our hosts and presumably transitory.  Traffic noise might be an issue for people who are sensitive to that.
Morgan was very helpful when we contacted her about the door problem and made it clear that we could get in touch with her at any time. All in all, a very pleasant stay."
2825852,44188517,2015-08-24,37504005,Artemio,"I stayed at this location with a couple family members in late August. The experience was wonderful. The apartment was clean and well stocked with every item you could need. The location was fantastic and is close to everything downtown. Morgan was extremely helpful and accommodating. As she told us, she wants guests to have a five-star experience and that is exactly what we had. Overall, a great experience and I would recommend to anyone. "

The space is located in a fun and safe neighborhood with transit options just a short walk away.  Mary welcomed me to her home with her always delightful and cheerful personality and really made me feel like I was returning to my own place every night.  She has two large dogs who are very awesome to spend time with, always up to things that amuses me greatly.  If one word sums up this experience, it would be wonderful.  I had an awesome stay and time at this home.  As long as the sun is out, there is plenty of natural lighting sources that helps to maintain the positive vibe that Mary creates.  Additionally, be prepared to have a selection of homemade treats that Mary prepares for her guests.  

Thanks Mary!!"
4639040,26934918,2015-02-22,26994267,Laurent,"It was great to stay at Mary's place. She was very great and supportive and gave lots of backed goodies and lots of recommendation.
At Mary's place I was never alone.
Thank you very much!"

4639040,28907391,2015-03-31,577122,Lisa,"Mary was a most welcoming host. She showed me the rules of the house, I met her two senior dogs - both sweet - and saw the house and my room and bathroom. The room is very clean, and I was pleased to have my own bathroom right next door. She provided toiletries and towels, and even included snacks in my room. Speaking of snacks - Mary likes to bake and she also likes to share her baking. So I partook of sweet bread, apple pie, oatmeal cookies (absolutely fabulous by the way - yum!) and she even made dog cookies the last day and sent me away with a bag for my own dog back home. (Note to Mary: Sadie LOVED those cookies!) Mary was very caring in checking with me about heat in the room, making sure the dogs were not bothering me in any way and giving me directions to places I needed to go. She has a table full of information on Seattle - things to do and see, restaurants, etc. Very helpful if you are on holiday.
I was in SEattle to do a 3-day workshop so I came home pretty tired every night. The bed was comfortable and warm and the area is very quiet.
The dogs are both seniors and don't move around much. They were very friendly and loved to be petted. This was nice for me because I was missing my own dog who stayed home this trip.
Mary was open to my using her kitchen and watching her tv. I even played around a bit with her player piano!
Mary is a lovely host. And you will never go hungry - a bonus!"
4639040,29152147,2015-04-04,30570335,Harish,The reservation was canceled 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4639040,31980639,2015-05-12,31894434,Simon,"Everything was fantastic. I rented a room from Mary for 13 days. I was working on a TV show and was coming and going at all hours. She never once had an issue with my odd hours. At one point I had to take a shower and be out the door by 3:30 AM. We had the chance to talk a couple of times during my stay, she was not only a great hostess, but a good friend.

She was always trying to feed me, which was much appreciated because I would often times not bother. She would have bags of snacks ready for me each morning with fun pictures and my name on them.

Over all it was a great first air B&B experience. Highly suggested."
4639040,33531200,2015-05-29,31201442,Jonas,I had a great time in Seattle staying at Mary's place. She always made sure I had the best experience possible by supplying me with food and information about the city. The house is also conveniently located close to a bus stop that takes you straight downtown. 
4639040,44099506,2015-08-24,31216684,James,"Mary was incredibly welcoming. Always went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable. Frequently checked in with me to make sure all was well. And her snack bags are delicious (and artistic!). Great experience, would highly recommend."
4639040,48897580,2015-09-29,32722714,J. Elaine,"While working in downtown Seattle for a month, I had the pleasure of staying in the Bunny Room. I loved how much light the house gets. House of the Light is the perfect name. Mary is such a gracious host and her home is a REAL Bed and Breakfast. Mary is an avid traveller so she knows what it's like to be a guest and she makes sure you feel at home.  
Since I am kinda particular with my diet, she was so sweet to ask me what I would like for breakfast and voila! Ask Mary and you shall receive. Every morning coffee would be ready, with my soy creamer, stevia, fruits galore (the fridge was PACKED) and she even found some extra vegan goodies for me to try. She even cut a pineapple for the first time for me (if you have ever done it, it's not easy) and I thought that was so thoughful. She loves to bake so there are always plenty of delicious baked goods. If you have a favorite baked good, I would highly recommend you tell her because it will be made for you the next day. 
I biked to and from downtown and on some days when it was raining, she would offer me a ride. Mary was always checking in to make sure everything was ok and if she could do anything more to make my stay more enjoyable. 
 I loved having full use of the kitchen. I really felt at home making my meals, and she freely shared everything. 
Her home is close to Columbia City and there are so many cute restaurants and bars there that you don’t get downtown. I enjoyed going to the Columbia Theater one night by myself and met some very cool friendly people.  I went back the next night for Karaoke night and it was a blast. Very friendly neighborhood. Seward Park and Lake Washington are close by for a wonderful bike ride or walk.
The House of Light is the perfect place when you are away yet but you still want the feeling of a home, use of a full kitchen, access to a pretty backyard patio to sit and have coffee, enjoy fresh baked goods and enjoy the Seattle weather. Thanks Mary!"
4639040,51186664,2015-10-18,45377017,Jennifer,I had a great time staying with Mary. I recently moved to Seattle and needed a place to stay while I looked for somewhere to live permanently. I had never been to Seattle before this trip so having a local help guide me was very helpful. I was hesitant about staying with a stranger at first but Mary made me feel very welcome and comfortable in her home. Now she is no longer a stranger but my first friend in Seattle.
4639040,52989575,2015-11-03,45903711,Michael,"Mary was extremely welcoming and provided better hospitality than any hotel! Very knowledgable about the Seattle and the cities in and around Washington. Short walk to the bus station, makes for a quick trip downtown. Excellent stay, and I would recommend to anyone."
4639040,55263978,2015-11-29,10921491,Pete,"I had just gotten a job in Seattle when I stayed at Mary's house and I can't imagine a warmer welcome to the city. Mary is a true fan of Seattle and was happy to provide all kinds of information (and even a lift in her car). The Ranier Valley neighborhood is a fascinating mix of cultures (Ethiopian restaurants and Buddhist monasteries, to name a few) and is easily accessible to downtown, and from there to anywhere. Plus, if you like fresh-baked cookies or breads, or homemade soups, you'd love Mary's house for that reason alone. 

The house is high energy—both Mary and her dog, Gracie :-) —so come prepared for lots of coffee and friendly conversation. But if you're not into those things, you'd probably still enjoy a visit. "
4879013,24350719,2014-12-26,510057,Ravindra,Suzanne was excellent host. Every thing is as described. They even have nice breakfast. House is very sweet and classy. They arranged everything so good that we didn't even have to contact them once.
4879013,24627147,2014-12-31,25176837,Tina,Suzanne was a great host and her place had everything you would need. Loved how her door had a code to enter which made it easier for  both parties for not having to meet at a certain time to transfer the key. Everything was arranged so well that we wouldn't have even seen Suzanne if we didn't bump into her while she was in her driveway. I highly recommend! 
4879013,24799266,2015-01-02,8036656,Lauren,"What a wonderful stay we had at Suzanne's apartment!  It's a cute neighborhood, great location, and easy to find.  The space was bright, spacious, impeccably designed, and well stocked.  We did not want for anything!  The process was easy- fast booking and she sent a code to get in on the afternoon of our arrival.  While it didn't bother us, there was the pitter-patter of little feet running upstairs by about 9am.  For folks sleeping in, it might wake them.  We look forward to staying at Suzanne's place in the future!  "
4879013,25488789,2015-01-17,8012712,Michele,"Suzanne's place was gorgeous! I only needed to stay one night, but I found myself wishing I had booked it longer rather than heading out to stay with family:)
"
4879013,25698999,2015-01-23,2031156,Anna,"Really good location close to university district and some amazing nearby views. Its a cozy, very well laid out apartment. Private entrance and code for easy check in and check out. The beds where very comfy, linen fresh with plenty of towels. What makes this place stand out is the extra touches, coffees, snacks and emergency items. The host, Suzanne lives upstairs and replies really quickly to messages. 
She made our business trip very comfortable and even helped with difficult circumstances and accommodated a booking extension. "
4879013,26271587,2015-02-08,26793551,Lydia,"We were completely happy with the Seattle Art Suite. We found it fresh, artfully decorated and fun to be in. The  beds, linens and thoughtful  touches reminded us of a world class hotel.  The kitchen is outfitted with  prostyle range and we found everything we needed to make wonderful meals effortlessly.  The private entrance leading into the charming Green lake Neighborhood was the frosting on the cake. Our hosts were friendly and gave us the right mix of privacy and attentiveness. We can't wait to come back!"
4879013,26332537,2015-02-09,204939,Lindsey & Candice,"Me, my wife, and my mother in law stayed here for one night, but I would love to have stayed for more. Suzanne and Craig's place was absolutely beautiful. The space was clean, vibrant and was very comfortable. The apartment is in a great, quiet, location and it was very easy to find parking close to the apartment. Not to mention it is four blocks from Mighty-O Donut. We really enjoyed the art and other personal effects, it brought unique character to the space. Although we did not meet Suzanne or Craig, they let us know we could contact them for anything, which was not necessary as the apartment was well stocked and we were well taken care of. They were also very accommodating by letting us arrive earlier then the normal check in time. I would absolutely love to stay again."

4879013,26769488,2015-02-18,27804333,Zhaoying,"This place is great!!! It's clean, conveniently located and beautifully decorated. The hosts really put effort into making the guest feel at home. You can feel that from so many details in the apartment. The only regret I have is that I didn't have the time to meet with the hosts. My bad! I will definitely stay here again during my next visit in Seattle."

4879013,27329374,2015-03-02,26273200,Ryan,This place was perfect. It was our first air bnb and is going to be tough to top.
4879013,28026257,2015-03-16,28290244,Chalane,"This was our first Airbnb and we loved it!  It was perfect for our little family of 4 with all the amenities--very clean, awesome kitchen, beautifully decorated throughout, comfortable beds and lots of white fluffy towels.   It was a quiet yet very convenient location--close to I5, very accessible to family attractions like the zoo, pacific science center, imagine children’s museum.  There’s even a playground a block away.  Craig and Suzanne were quick with communication and very accommodating with all our questions and requests.  We hope to stay again the next time we are in town!"

4879013,32204949,2015-05-15,12934633,Ryan,"Suzanne & Craig's place in Green Lake is fantastic!!  Great location-close walk to restaurants and bars, as well as Green Lake Park.  Arrival was very easy, as Craig sent me a code for the lock.

The space is very well appointed, super clean and comfortable.  The coffee maker with fresh coffee and snacks came in very handy.  The bed was incredibly comfortable--I slept perfectly.

I loved my stay here and hope to stay again on my next trip to Seattle.
Highly recommend!"
4879013,32534233,2015-05-19,437206,Jonathan,"Suzanne and Craig were extremely accommodating and efficient. Whenever we needed them, they were prompt to help ( we only really needed them once, because the internet was down for a little bit).

The place was incredibly clean, everything well organized and stocked. The place is cute, cozy and functional. Close enough to Green Lake even walking and some nice shops and restaurants. 

My family stayed there, while visiting me from overseas, and they had a blast. I visited them often at the apartment, and though they loved Seattle, they enjoyed staying in the apt just as much!

Book it, I don' t think that there is anything it won't be pleased with."
4879013,33115757,2015-05-25,27242109,Andrea,"This place is really what it says....Fabulous Green Lake House. Clean, immaculate, artfully decorated and it had everything we could ever need. Comfortable beds, fluffy pillows, soft duvets, soft towels, everything was superb. Craig and Suzanne made us feel welcome and assisted in every way. 
Suzanne is tasteful decorator and pays attention to every little detail to make the guest feel at home. We had everything we needed and more. The house even has a little seating area outside to enjoy glass of wine in the evening.
The area is lovely. Green Lake is short bike ride away. Restaurants and shopping is nearby. 
We highly recommend this place and hope to return again."
4879013,34009705,2015-06-03,4804681,Pat,My friends and I loved your place. It's very cute and  we loved the décor. It's also very clean. The place is close to everything as well as the lake. The neighborhood is nice and safe. And the yogurt in the fridge was truly a nice touch and we ate it all. If we are in the Seattle area again we will definitely stay here. Thank you for having us and accommodating our needs.  We enjoyed staying in your place.
4879013,34165430,2015-06-05,15587631,Heather,"This apartment was everything they advertised it to be and MORE!! it was clean, super cute decor, and all the amenities you could EVERY ask for! The price was fantastic, the neighborhood was so nicely located with tons to do with in walking distance.
The little touches like the yogurt and fruit in the fridge... The great selection of coffee were all so appreciated. 
Greg and Suzanne were wonderful to work with and I hope we will be able to stay again!! "
4879013,35061743,2015-06-15,26750848,Anne,"Our stay was incredible! Suzanne and Craig were great with communications about how to get there, parking, public transportation etc etc. When the day came, they left instructions on how to get into the apartment which were perfect. As soon as we arrived they texted us a welcome message and made themselves available if we needed help but totally respected our privacy. 

The space itself was amazing. Immaculate, spacious, and very well equipped. We actually chose to cook one night instead of going out because the place was so much fun to be in.

I can't wait to come back!!!"
4879013,35299714,2015-06-17,25665271,Lauren,"We truly enjoyed our stay at this Green Lake apartment.  The communication prior to arriving was seamless. Craig and Suzanne have done a beautiful and thoughtful job with this apartment. It was spotlessly clean. The bathroom was stunning. There were plenty of fresh, clean and plush towels provided.  The beds were comfortable. The apartment had fresh coffee, yogurt, fruit and other snacks if needed. We had the ability to do laundry or iron if needed.  We truly appreciated the numerous extra touches that Craig and Suzanne provided.  We were two couples staying, and the size was perfect. The entrance has a nice outdoor area with two chairs to enjoy the weather and sunshine. It was nice to sit outside and read a book. We loved the neighborhood. It is located a short walk from Green Lake itself which has a nice path to run, walk, bike around. There are coffee shops and restaurants nearby.  "
4879013,36019576,2015-06-24,32737470,Danette,"Great location in residential area of Seattle with Green Lake and its various neighborhoods within easy walking distance - restaurants, coffee shops, etc.  Public transportation nearby to downtown Seattle.  The apartment was very nice - clean, and comfortable.  The full kitchen was well appointed with new appliances, fixtures, cabinets and the hosts include lots of nice amenities such as breakfast items, coffee (of course), trail snacks for hikes, and fresh fruit. The beds were very comfortable and the bath had lots of amenities as well - many nice thick towels, shampoo, conditioner, soap, etc. We felt very much at home and would definitely stay there again."

We highly recommend this place.

Suzanne and Craig have anticipated every need, such as yogurt in the fridge, which was much appreciated after getting in late and waking up hungry. The house is within walking distance of good restaurants, coffee and bars, and Green Lake is just a short walk away.  You won't be disappointed if you stay here! "
4879013,49099524,2015-10-01,24302222,Moustafa,"
The list discerption was accurate and the location was very good. The place was very clean. The hosts are very organized and made every thing available and easy to find. What I missed was that the unit is a basement apartment, more on the dark side and the noise level from children above a little excessive specially early in the morning. "

This living space looks like it was recently renovated in a professional manner.   It was super clean and quiet.  The beds were very comfortable.   There was an assortment of yogurts, beverages, teas, coffes and oatmeal which was a nice touch the first night we arrived.   The full laundry made our stay easy."

We could not have been happier. It was walking distance to a little down town area and just a short drive away from Capital Hill.  We loved how Eco friendly they were with the compost and other amenities. Shower was awesome.  Extremely clean yet very cozy at the same time! I would highly recommend this place to anyone! "

I would definitely stay here again."

Every thing  has been carefully  thought out so everything you might need is  there for  you.  The central location  is  very good, I-5 is a few blocks away.  Parking is on the street  but there has been space every time.  

The space itself is fun.  Lots of character here.  Most everything  is very new and they used quality components for  the  new cabinets, stainless steel appliances, and it has a very usable kitchen.

Its no wonder this place is so popular!  I'll be back if there is an opening on my next trip to Seattle."

8869680,55740522,2015-12-05,45377981,Emilie,"I stayed here while interviewing at the University of Washington, and this place was very conveniently located.

1455908,7207620,2013-09-10,6328699,Karla,"Before ever arriving I had a good feeling about the decision we made to rent from Jesse & Thuy. Jesse communicated with me frequently and responded quickly. He seemed very thoughtful and conscientious of our needs. When we arrived the place was spotless and felt very comfortable. On the table he left several local travel brochures, a packet of helpful information he typed up himself (rules for staying there, WiFi login, local restaurants & attractions, etc...), and a note with a gift for being their first airbnb guests. Above & beyond!! He made himself available if we needed assistance (which we did not, since he did such a good job of covering all the bases) and checked in with me via text message just to make sure we got in okay. Aside from how great he was, the home is modern/up to date, and in a great location; tucked into a cozy neighborhood just minutes from downtown via car or bus. The bus stop was only a few blocks away. Coffee is also within walking distance (as it should be in Seattle! lol) To say that all of our needs were met is an understatement! These two are fantastic hosts and you can feel secure that should you choose to stay here you will be very pleased. Thanks for everything, Jesse & Thuy!"
1455908,8863650,2013-11-22,9600339,Satya,"This was a great rental.  Thank you Jesse for making this easy and accommodating.  cozy place with lots of light, close to downtown and everything.  
Loved the little fire place, it was comforting.  And there is a great coffee shop 6 blocks away down the hill that I love.  
I can see this being a great place for someone that needs to commute to something they are attending daily, but still be a little out of the major hub of city craziness and have a neighborhood feel. 
Also, I love the little kitchen with the nice appliances. "
1455908,9543845,2014-01-02,9643203,Wangye,"The host is very friendly, they give us a bottle of wine as gift for new year, the house is tidy and clean, it's fabulous for two couples to stay. "

1455908,11571419,2014-04-07,13795607,Devin,"A beautiful home in a great location.  It's easy to get to Downtown or Capitol Hill from here, and always has easy parking. The rooms are bright and the master bed has one of the most comfortable mattresses I've slept on, even if the room got too bright in the morning to sleep in. Jesse was responsive and helpful. Definitely keeping this place to rent again."
1455908,12139696,2014-04-23,2367021,Kevin,Had a wonderful stay at Jesse's. The townhouse exceeded our expectations and the wine and the card is a nice touch. Jesse promptly answered our questions via airbnb during our stay. This our first airbnb experience and we're glad Jesse made it a great one. We would highly recommend staying here.
1455908,12563843,2014-05-05,10050787,Débora,"Jesse is a caring person. 

His house is very nice, clean, beautiful, cozy, close to bus stop. 

My trip would have been perfect if I had not been very sick all the time. Luckily the hospital was close too! 

The city of Seattle is beautiful, modern, urban, organized, clean. 

I need to get back to enjoy all that I could not enjoy it. 
And for this, the Jesse's house is my first choice!"
1455908,12979806,2014-05-16,14413837,Theresa,"Jesse and Thuy were amazing host during our stay! Always in constant contact with them, even while they were in Vietnam! My family and I were impressed with their home and all its amenities. If me or my family/friends are visiting Seattle in the near future, we are going to want to stay here again. "
1455908,13076947,2014-05-19,3414769,Jen,"Stayed here for a girls' weekend with 3 other people, so it was the perfect amount of space. The place was clean and had plenty of bed space for all of us. Jesse was super responsive and helpful in providing information and recommendations for the area.

The only complaint I have was that it was incredibly hot the first night inside the house. I'm guessing it's because it was a warm week prior to our arrival and the heat was trapped inside the house. It was unclear if the HVAC system actually included AC or if we were supposed to use the portable fans (which I don't prefer when I sleep). By contrast, the second night was a lot more comfortable though still rather warm inside the house compard to the outside temperature.

Would not recommend to people who have trouble going up and down stairs since it's 3 stories, but I found it to be great cardio!

The place is farther from the main tourist/going outscene in Seattle, but we had rented a car, so it was perfect for our weekend."
1455908,13217874,2014-05-22,14548240,Anthony,"Great place! Full amenities including pillows, towels, utensils, etc. Feels like owning your own home. Love the neighborhood and its closeness to downtown and Pike's Place too! "
1455908,13474637,2014-05-28,2127135,Jason,Jesse's place was amazing. It worked out really well for our group. We were able to function without having to worry about waking our late sleeping friends due to the configuration of the floor plan. The location made it easy to get to Cap Hill and Pike Place. We are runners and it was nice to be able to get to some flat land on the eastern side of Seattle. Would totally come back and stay with Jesse.
1455908,13569696,2014-05-31,4485286,Elaine,"I stayed at Jesse's for 2 nights in Seattle. Jesse has a beautiful home in a very convenient and accessible location that is just a bus ride away from everywhere else. We arrived to find a bottle of wine at the dining table, it was a nice surprise. Jesse has taken great care to ensure that the place is very clean and stocked with amenities. My family of 5 had a great stay and we would definitely come back again if we were to visit Seattle again. Jesse has also been a very responsive and helpful host."
1455908,18703455,2014-08-31,12567731,Eric,"The house was great, Jesse and Thuy were very welcoming and even gave us access to the mailbox for the duration of our stay. I would definitely consider staying here again!"
1455908,21334189,2014-10-15,17476914,Erick,"The experience at this apartment was fantastic. Everything was as advertised, and Jesse was a very gracious and generous host."
1455908,22183636,2014-11-01,20454556,Philip S,I had a great stay at Jesses house. it was beautiful & cozy. it's also a great location to everything in Seattle. Jesse is very nice and quick to reply. 
1455908,22560141,2014-11-09,15105416,Lindsay,"Came to Seattle for a girl's weekend and this looked like the perfect place to stay. There was two of us and this place had more than enough space! Communication with Jesse before and during the stay was awesome.  Very responsive and we were even greeted with a bottle of wine on arrival! Place was very clean, beds were soft and comfortable. Lots of towels. Great location. Less than a 10 minute drive/cab ride to downtown. We went out both Friday and Saturday nights, and didn't wait long at all for a cab. One item to note on the heating - make sure the vents are switched to ""on"" since when you get there they have them on off or low settings to conserve power. Took us awhile to figure that out, but it was all good once we did. I highly recommend staying here. It's clean, comfortable, centrally located and the hosts are great.  The place looks exactly like the pictures. "
1455908,26701129,2015-02-17,1248946,Nethra,"My roommates and I had a wonderful stay in Seattle, thanks to Jesse! The house was beautiful and clean, and the rooms were very comfortable. Jesse was extremely good at communicating both before and during the trip, and was very accommodating. He also left us a card and a bottle of wine to welcome us, which we thought was very sweet. The location is great and a short commute to downtown. I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for accommodation in Seattle! "
1455908,31796994,2015-05-10,6991416,Cindy,This is a great location.  When we arrived Jesse had thoughtfully left a card and bottle of wine to welcome us to his home.  The house was clean and comfortable with pretty much any amenity you might need.  Jesse is very responsive and even contacted me that I had accidentally left an item behind so I could easily retrieve it before leaving town.  Recommended!
1455908,36385187,2015-06-28,23942238,Kevin,"The location is pretty convenient to downtown Seattle. This town-home is clean and easy to use, but not very organized. Host left a lot stuff at the place, especially in the kitchen, you can reach pretty anything you need. 

Jessie left a bottle wine and thanks note for us. He is easy and nice communicated. Highly recommended for a family!"
1455908,37994636,2015-07-12,24468604,Miyaki,Jesse is a good host and we enjoy our trip in Seattle!
1455908,38903592,2015-07-19,21067671,Sang,"Jesse was responsive and quick to answer any questions/problems we had. He had a welcome packet for us that was very clear with directions and notes regarding the house. 
The house was very clean and organized and had everything we needed. It was a pleasant stay. 

Thank you again Jesse!"
1455908,39737099,2015-07-26,30061731,Daryl,"Jesse was excellent in communicating with me prior to my arrival, and checked up with me via email after arrival to ensure everything was ok. They left a  bottle of wine for us on  which was very nice. Place was  very comfortable and close to downtown Seattle like the listing mentioned. We have no complaints about this listing, perfect spot for 3-4 people to stay and hang out in Seattle.

Thank-you for letting us stay with you."
1455908,40748560,2015-08-02,30024776,Jennifer,"We enjoyed our stay in this town house.  Jesse was very flexible in allowing us to drop our bags prior to check-in time so that we didn't have to leave them exposed in our car for the day.  He met us upon arrival and provided some useful info on the bus system.  It was very convenient in that the bus stop is right across the street and we could take a single bus (#27)  to downtown and within walking distance of all the attractions we wanted to visit (Pike Market, Space Needle, etc).  We also liked that we were only ~5 blocks from Leschi Park & Lake Washington, which made for a good running route.  The house had everything we needed and beds were comfy.  We would definitely stay here again."
1455908,42910320,2015-08-16,12682755,Anne,"Great place! Jesse was super responsive and flexible, the apartment is clean and cozy - it was super comfortable and easy. Would definitely stay here again. "
1455908,46769713,2015-09-13,4087739,Sameer,"This was a great experience and place to stay. The neighborhood is about 10 min from downtown, 15 min from Capitol Hill and 30 min from the airport. There is a Starbucks and market that is walkable from the townhome. 

There were three of us staying in the townhome and it was so spacious. We really enjoyed being there and hanging on the deck (the weather was perfect). The rooms were great, the place was extremely comfortable! It was a great home away from home. 

Thank you Jesse for allowing us to use to the place and for the bottle of wine on arrival! That was very kind! 

Thanks!"
1455908,48547593,2015-09-27,19457600,Peggy,Jesse was an excellent host.  He responded to all our questions and requests promptly.  He left a welcome note with a bottle of wine for us when we arrived which was very thoughtful.  The House Rules that he emailed us were very reasonable.   The location is great - walking distance to Leschi Market and a convenient bus ride to downtown.  There is a great Ethiopian Restaurant within walking distance as well.  
1455908,50371437,2015-10-11,16510791,Christine,"The house was very accurate to it's description and exactly what we needed.  We were confused with the address and went to the wrong side of the street at first but when I called Jesse he immediately answered and directed us to the correct location.  It also was a perfect shot to our event downtown where we are going for the weekend so the drive back and forth was easy. Overall, I recommend this location.  It was an easy drive to downtown, it was clean and the host was very accommodating, thoughtful and helpful!"
1455908,53402075,2015-11-08,13869595,Holly,This was my first time renting with Airbnb and it was a great experience. Jesse was a wonderful host and the place was exactly what we needed. We had a fantastic time in Seattle!
1321090,6280591,2013-08-06,7187784,Steve,Serina was a great host at the Seattle Center Inn. She was flexible with our arrival time and even let us check in a little early at no additional charge. The place was clean and even had some nice touches like a Keurig coffee maker. Location was even better as it was centrally located to everything we wanted to do in Seattle. I would highly recommend staying here.
1321090,6347204,2013-08-09,7273042,Fietje,"Had a wonderful three night stay at Serina's place. We arrived at around 8pm and were welcomed by Serina to get access to the apartment and garage, that we had rented for our stay. It was very convenient since we planned to walk during our stay. The apartment was clean and very comfortable she even had some wonderful pastries on the counter for us upon arrival. The place is located in a quite area close to the space needle and a 20 min walk to pike place market. there were some wonderful restaurants close by and good access to transit. Only down side was no air conditioning, there was a fan provided so once we got back from the days adventures we would just open the windows and turn on the fan which worked pretty well to cool the place down. Overall it was a fabulous place to stay and would stay there again if I ever come back to Seattle."
1321090,6711039,2013-08-22,7429594,Leona,"My mom and I were pleased with our stay at Serina's rental. It was clean, well stocked, and in a convenient location for public transportation. I would stay here again. "
1321090,6763040,2013-08-24,7815045,Haley,"This was our first time staying somewhere through airbnb and it was great! Serina's place was well-located (close walk to bus stop and Space Needle). The house was spacious for the two of us and very clean! Serina was a great host. She even had pastries for us to enjoy in the morning! If I were to go to Seattle again, I would definitely stay there again. "
1321090,6812321,2013-08-26,4917713,James,"Serina's apartment is fantastic and perfect for the ""functional"" traveler who is looking for location and likes some creature comforts but isn't looking for the ultimate in posh settings. It's close to dozens of great bars and restaurants in Bell Town and Lower Queene Anne, and it really couldn't be more convenient to the Space Needle/Chihuly Gardens. The apartment was clean and well-appointed with an extremely comfortable bed and a nice-sized bathroom.

Pros:
-Location is excellent.
-Serina is a very gracious host who was flexible with our arrival schedule.
-Nice sized TV with a sound system that is Bluetooth-compatible so I had music playing from my iPhone whenever we were at the apartment.
-Basic kitchen amenities available if needed.
-Quick wifi connection.

Cons:
-No air conditioning, which isn't a problem with the windows open, but that can be a bit noisy and perhaps a bit of a safety concern.
-No cable TV.
-The garage parking space ($10/day) was EXTREMELY small, and my rental car (a Chevy Malibu) could only barely fit when I backed in, and it didn't fit at all when I tried to pull in nose-first.
"
1321090,6935735,2013-08-31,5339648,Wendy,"We can only agree with everything said by the previous reviewers. A great apartment, well equipped, clean and comfortable. Don't be put off by the slightly scruffy building - inside is fine. Amazing supermarket - Metropolitan - nearby which supplies everything. Plenty of places to eat and great transport links. Loved Seattle."
1321090,7010387,2013-09-03,52799,Jen,"We had a wonderful time staying in Serina's Seattle Centre Inn. Serina was very accommodating when we first made the reservation and created a whole new unit for us. She was very good at keeping in regular contact with me and answered all my questions. When we arrived, Serina took the time to walk us through the apartment, answered all of our questions and even bought us pastries from a local bakery. This space is near a ton of great restaurants, pike place, the water and Seattle Centre. I highly recommend this place and will be back next year!! "
1321090,7140678,2013-09-08,7967304,Lynn,"This is a great location for visiting Seattle Center - two blocks! Also good restaurants and shops within a few blocks and great bus service almost at the door. Had no trouble getting to the airport, Pike Place Market and Fremont. The apartment is comfortable, spotlessly clean, and furnished with everything needed for cooking and eating. I was surprised that Serina also furnished shampoo, hair dryer and such, just like a hotel. I slept on the pull out bed and it was fairly hard, but doable; probably a child or younger adult would be fine with it. My friend had the bedroom and was very comfortable. Definitely would stay here again and recommend it for anyone who wants to be in this area."
1321090,7302722,2013-09-15,3726682,Michael And Kirby,"Serina is totally awesome! She went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed and provided us with a clean, comfortable, safe place to stay. 

First, because of some poor planning on our part, we contacted her for the first time about an hour before being at the apartment.  Check in is at 4PM, which is really clearly laid out in the info you receive from the host a day before arriving. We hit Downtown Seattle at 11AM and realized pretty quickly we didn't want to haul our bags around with us for the next 5 hours. Serina met us early and let us drop off our stuff in the apartment.  We went off to eat lunch and wander around Miner's Landing, then came back around 4PM to check in officially.  We bought a cheap bouquet of flowers at pikes market, and Serina  immediately offered to get us a vase from her apartment for us to display the flowers in our apartment.  She gave us a run through of the area and features of the apartment and made us feel very welcome. 

Lower Queen Anne was a very safe neighborhood located just north of downtown proper, between Seattle center and the coast. Once you get the hang of the bus system, it's actually pretty perfectly located - there was public transit to just about anywhere we wanted to go with a stop only a block from the apartment. 

If you're looking for a good time in Seattle, this apartment and Serina's hospitality will set you up for a great start. "
1321090,7509470,2013-09-23,7717954,Patricia,"Everything was as advertised and Serina was very helpful.
The site is ideal for walking to many of Seattle's top attractions, for using public transportation, for parking a car. The upkeep of the apartment is top notch, the kitchen is fully furnished and within convenient walking distance to an ideal grocery. If you are a light sleeper or not used to city street noises, ear plugs are recommended. We would happily return."
1321090,7968508,2013-10-10,6252948,Jihye,We stayed in here 2 days and it was a great place to explore Seattle. Very very close to Seattle Center and close enough to downtown. And Serina prepared everything so there was not a thing I could ask more. Thanks.
1321090,8112835,2013-10-16,1927119,Alexandrea,"My friend and I had a wonderful stay at Serina's apartment. We loved our living room view of the Needle and its fantastic location to everything. The apartment was clean with all the comfort of home amenities. We cooked dinner a couple of nights and there were everything we needed. We met Serina upon checking in and she was always happy to assist with any questions we had prior to our arrival and accommodating to our changing plans right up until setting foot at the apartment.

We rented a car to drive out of Seattle and had no problem with street parking. 5 out of our 6 nights we had a spot right on the front door. The one odd night we parked just around the street so that was also not a hassle.

From the apartment you can walk to many places (Teatro Zinzani, the Needle and other great stuff in its vicinity), even Pike Place if you fancy a short 15-20 minute walk.

Thank you, Serina! We have already decided that we will stay with you again whenever we are back in Seattle!! :-)"
1321090,8153605,2013-10-18,8866128,Marit,"We had a great stay and found the location perfect! Spacious and ""hotel feeling"" apartment on a quite area of the center of town. We would defensively come back of we get the chance. "
1321090,8256811,2013-10-22,8860136,Jenn,"The place is charming, clean, and ideally located.  If you are in Seattle for any event located at the Seattle Center, this is definitely the very best location one could ask for.  Parking is tight, but there are parking garages near by if your car is not compact.  Serina was very helpful and accommodating.  We had everything we needed for the weekend.  Itis easy to get disoriented when looking for the address itself because W 1st Ave and N 1st Ave run parallel in this neighborhood.  Make certain you are on N 1st Ave when arriving.  We had trouble finding the building, but that was because we took a wrong turn.  We were able to walk to all the main attractions in downtown very easily.  I will definitely try to stay here again if I'm in town for any concert or event in Seattle in the future.  Thanks to Serina for standing outside to help us find our way to the parking spot.  "
1321090,8632484,2013-11-09,7273328,Jason,"Serina's place is amazing and in a perfect location. Clean, convenient, spacious, quiet, comfortable. The bed is comfortable, the bathroom is immaculate, the kitchen is complete. Serina left pastries next to the coffee, which was a nice touch. The laundry machine (washer/dryer unit) is also quite handy. The neighbors were quiet. I walked to the market area, and there were several bars and restaurants within walking distance (the chili at the Rabbit Hole was pretty good). The space needle is staring at you as you walk out the front door. Transportation is excellent in seattle. I would have stayed a week at Serina's place!"
1321090,8727674,2013-11-14,2961001,Auralee,"Seattle Center Inn was a great place to stay, the location is perfect! It's right by the Seattle Science Center which makes it super easy to hop in the monorail and go downtown, didn't have to worry about parking. The place was clean & comfortable in a safe neighborhood, it really doesn't get much better. I would definitely recommend it! "
1321090,8823016,2013-11-19,4723392,Alexander,"Awesome location and perfect for walking around to all the cool places.

The apartment is very clean and quiet.  Serina met us upon arrival to explain everything and give some local tips.

Would definitely stay again!"
1321090,8873600,2013-11-23,6940727,Jonathan,The Seattle Center Inn has all the amenities you would hope to have in a studio apt. It us located in a very walkable part of town with coffee shops and grocery stores close by. Parking was always easy as well. This place works fine for someone looking to stay in a modest studio apt while visiting. 
1321090,8977267,2013-11-30,7038614,Christopher,"The location and accommodations were ideal for us.  The location, on the west edge of Seattle Center, was perfect for walking downtown, enjoying the Chihuly exhibit and Space Needle at Seattle Center, and populated by many excellent restaurants.  We didn't use it, but the city bus is available right out front.  The housing was great---a fine kitchen and ""family"" space with a futon/couch, a separate bedroom with a comfortable mattress, and a bathroom--plenty of room for the three of us.  Access was easy, controlled, and safe.  Serina, our host, let us in, showed us the ropes, and let us be.  Of course, we were running around Seattle most of the time anyway.  I highly recommend the place!"
1321090,9024572,2013-12-02,6068221,Peggy,"We had a wonderful stay at Serina's apartment. Serina was there to greet us on Friday evening to show us the lovely apartment and answer any questions we might have.  The place was exceptionally clean, well-stocked and convenient for walking all over Seattle's sights.  It was the perfect apartment and location for us and I would happily stay there again."
1321090,9072292,2013-12-04,6110606,Loretta,"Good (email hidden)ose to Space Needle and 20 minute walk to downtown. Nice to have convenience of kitchen and lots of restaurants nearby. Parking was tricky...alley parking or garage was limited and very small spots even for compact car. Choose pay parking, which had to be re-paid each day/evening, but I was forewarned by Serina."
1321090,9158507,2013-12-10,2048394,Paul,"Serina and The Seattle Center Inn are top notch...perfect!  Clean, great location and a great view of the Space Needle.  We were in town for a concert at the Key Arena.  The Seattle Center Inn is about a two block walk.  What a great time we had!  Don't hesitate to make your reservation with Serina.  Thank you!"
1321090,9404461,2013-12-27,9586283,Rafael,"Serina is what you would hope from a host...her place was clean and comfortable, and she is very friendly and easy to work with.  I would recommend her and her place without hesitation. "
1321090,9456943,2013-12-29,4612315,Charlie,"My stay at Serina's was perfect.  There were three of us that stayed there.  My couple friends stayed in the bedroom and i slept on the pullout sofa bed.  The bed was comfortable,  the apartment was roomy, with a washer dryer, big bathroom, good location.  We parked our van on the street and just paid the parking meter cause Serina's garage could not accommodate the size of our van and walked to downtown the whole time we were there.  And it's pretty quiet for a  place close to the Seattle Center.  I would recommend her place.."
1321090,9587529,2014-01-03,5658337,Carol,"What an awesome stay!  Clean, spacious, gracious host, and everything we needed!  Serina was an amazing host!  

She greeted us on our arrival, and answered all the questions we had, and throughout our stay, she was prompt to help us with what we needed and more.  

Her apartment is clean, well equipped, cozy, and just a great spot to relax after a long day of exploring the city.  She has a stash of make up removers in the washroom which is SO thoughtful, and also little bottles of body lotion- very hotel-like.  

I would definitely stay here again!  Thanks again Serina!"
1321090,9805393,2014-01-11,10866171,Ifbb Pro,"Serina's place is in a fabulous location for the first time Seattle traveler. We were able to walk to the grocery store, stroll through Seattle center with our coffees in hand, and even eat at Dicks's the Seattle burger staple. The apartment was clean and inviting. Sincere thanks to Serina for making it so easy for us. "
1321090,9850485,2014-01-14,10108519,Celia,"Excellent value within short walking distance of the Arts Center and fine restaurants. Comfortable and clean, my friend and I will definitely be returning. "
1321090,9901673,2014-01-18,10052827,Lana,"Roger and I enjoyed staying at Serena's apartment.  It was conveniently located, exceptionally clean and had nearly everything we might need for a comfortable stay.  There were even sweet rolls provided for our first morning.  We would return another time when we come to Seattle.  Our only small suggestion for future improvement would be a second comfortable chair in the living area.  "
1321090,10039494,2014-01-27,1763259,Ann,"Sernia Hsu was quite easy to work with - communication was prompt and concise.  Easy-to-follow directions were a bonus.  Condo/apartment was exactly as listed.  

We had a grand experience and found this condo to fit our needs quite well:  it is easy and inexpensive to get to from the airport by taking the light rail, and then the monorail or a taxi.  Its location makes for easy access to Seattle Center, downtown, and  the Queen Anne area. There are good restaurants with walking distance that have varied selections.

We would welcome the chance to stay here again.  "
1321090,10151349,2014-02-03,10857661,Czarina,The apartment was located in a quiet area but still a walking distance to bars and fantastic restaurants. The Space Needle is literally around the block. Its also less than $10 cab ride to all attractions. The house was very clean & had all the commodities we need. We were greeted with a box of Danish next to a Keurig! Serina fulfilled all our requests & was nice enough to let us check in early. I would recommend her to anyone visiting Seattle. 
1321090,10198037,2014-02-05,2414382,Rob,"Great communication, extremely helpful and understanding. I will definitely be booking next time I'm in Seattle."

1321090,10609374,2014-02-27,8261247,Jacqui,"Serina's apartment in Seattle was in a GREAT local. It was clean, cozy, and well equipped with all necessities needed. There were even surprise blueberry muffins on the counter to munch on when we arrived, which my daughter absolutely loved. Worth every dollar!!!
Thanks for sharing your space with us Serina, we will definitely be back again. "
1321090,10767451,2014-03-06,743047,Muhiba,"The apartment was nice and lovely, had all the necessities me and my friends had a wonderful time. The only issue we had was with the parking, the space is extremely tight, and no matter how close to the wall we parked, it seems not good enough and seemed to keep causing issues. Other than that - it was a lovely 2 days spent and I would recommend the place to my friends. Than you Serina :) "
1321090,10936588,2014-03-14,10915899,"Claudia, Carsten, Helena, Felix","We had a great stay at Serina's apartment. It was beautiful and clean. The kitchen and bathroom were equipped with everything necessary! The apartment is in walking-distance to downtown Seattle and to the water. Also, communication with Serina worked out perfectly and we were even allowed to leave our luggage for a few hours before check-in and after check-out! We would definitely recommend a stay at Serina's apartment!"
1321090,11007193,2014-03-17,5523559,Katherine,"The apartment was in a perfect location, clean, and perfect for our stay! We walked to downtown every day! Serina was a wonderful host and incredibly welcoming :-) when we visit Seattle again we will definitely book with her again! Thank Serina!"
1321090,11084996,2014-03-19,13062506,Elizabeth,"Serena's apartment was fantastic! My boyfriend and I came into town from Portland for a few days and stayed at Serena's one bedroom apartment in Lower Queen Anne. The location was central to all the stops we had on our itinerary, and the living room window looks right out to the Space Needle! The apartment was very clean, spacious, and had great light. It also came with many amenities and toiletries. Basically all we needed was a toothbrush and toothpaste. Both mornings we sat and had coffee (made with a Keurig machine) and flipped through some basic cable channels before starting our day. There were plenty of towels, clean linens on the bed, extra pillows in the closet, and an iron and ironing board. There was also a washer/dryer with detergent, although we didn't use it. 
Serena was easy to work with and was very accommodating when we needed to check-in late. She simply gave us a code for the door and had us let ourselves in, which was exactly what we needed! She even left a yummy pastry on the counter for us! Nice touch! She was also cool with us taking our time to pack up our vehicle and check out about 15 minutes late. I would definitely recommend her apartment, for short or extended stays. Thank you again, Serena! "
1321090,11277817,2014-03-28,1352620,Allen,"Serina was awesome. She was very helpful when we got lost while coming in late. The appt was well equipped where we could was dishes, cook and do our laundry. All of which came in handy with our daughter. Would love to come back again."
1321090,11354630,2014-03-31,918905,Aaron + Kelsey,"Serina is a wonderful host!  We enjoyed our stay very much and the location of this apartment is extremely convenient to the Seattle Center.  We certainly felt at home, which is the way we like to travel--having a full kitchen is key for us as we like to be able to dine in as well.  There is more closet space than you would ever need too!  Super clean overall, and the amenities are fabulous.  Communicating with Serina was extremely easy, as was getting in and out of the apartment.  Thank you Serina!"
1321090,11468137,2014-04-04,6882612,Michele,"We had a great time at Serina's place in Seattle! The rental is so convenient to the space needle and monorail terminal that you don't even need a car while here. We took the train from Portland, OR and were able to walk or monorail almost everywhere. 

Serina was very attentive to our needs and answered our requests promptly. She was a great host and I hope to stay again in the future.

Thanks again! Michele and Sister, Min."
1321090,11593808,2014-04-08,3308332,Marge,"We had a wonderful time staying in Serena's place on our visit to Seattle. The apartment was clean, the location was perfect! Just steps from the Seattle Center and Space Needle.  We really enjoyed the little extras such as the DVD player, pastries, fun coffee machine. We would definitely stay here again. "
1321090,11637147,2014-04-10,12246566,Rachael,"We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay.  Serina's place was spotless and central to everything.  We were able to park our car and walk everywhere we needed to go.  She is courteous and helpful, and we will recommend her place to anyone.  Hoping we can stay again someday. "

Clean and simple inside the apartment, love the decor! Bathroom is clean and comes with a bunch of toiletries, hair dryer, and a bunch of towels. Kitchen comes with a coffee machine, basic tableware, and a water filter. She even left us 2 danishes! yum!
Overall comfortable and safe, a good experience :)"
1321090,12421904,2014-05-02,10436922,Alex,"Lovely, clean & spacious apartment. Great location, easy walk to town, space needle, sculpture park, etc. Serina very friendly & helpful on our arrival, and the breakfast pastries were a generous treat (and tasty!). If we ever get the opportunity to return, we'd definitely stay here again."
1321090,12682205,2014-05-08,11493317,Eugene,We were pleasantly surprised at how well equipped the apartment was. Serina was also very helpful and quick to reply to questions. We enjoyed our stay in her apartment and would choose it again should we visit the area once more.
1321090,12771863,2014-05-11,8471731,Biljana,"We are family with two small kids and this was the best and the most spacious accomadation we had during our two-week trip in the US.
Serina was great host - we could enter the appartment earleir and she brought us sweet buns for the next morning :) the place is super clean, more that enough space for your guarderbe, equipt with everything you need to feel ""at home"" - great cofee and even washing tabs. Nice view on the Space Needle, especially in the evening. Downtown easily accesable by different types of public transport in a mum of time,
Thank you Serina for your hospitality :)"
1321090,12919764,2014-05-14,13089109,Gary,"Great well equipped apartment and a very comfortable bed. Serina was a great host and provided all necessary information in advance of my stay. The pastries left in the kitchen for my arrival was a thoughtful touch. Good location too, walking distance to downtown Seattle. I would definitely stay here again."
1321090,13207724,2014-05-22,802030,Tracy,"The apartment location was very convenient to Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP, Pacific Science Center, etc) - just a 10 min walk  -- and very close to downtown (or, if preferred, public transportation to downtown).  Most of the time, we walked downtown and to the piers (20-30 min walk - depending on where you were going) because we liked taking our time and people watching along the way.  The apartment is spacious and has all of the extras you like in a b-n-b like a full kitchen and living room.  Serina is a thoughtful host and provides coffee, cocoa, some extra toiletries, an umbrella (nice!), pastries when you check-in (YUM!) and other such things. There was also a stockpile of movies and several brochures/guides for the local attractions.  The TV is modern, so we just connected our computer (via HDMI cable) to the TV and watched Netflix in what little down time we had.  I especially liked that the lock is not key operated.  Rather, it is a combination lock, which afforded easy access without having to carry around and keep track of a key.  Brilliant!  

Because you are in the city, please be mindful that there are city noises at night.  There is much activity (foot and car traffic) on the street, so if you have the windows open (as we did) you will hear this noise.  You may need to close the windows or turn on the fan (provided by Serina) to drown out the noise so that you can sleep.  

We had a rental car and Serina graciously allowed us to use a space on site, but I will warn you, the space is VERY, very small and you have to park next to a brick wall on the driver's side.  We had a compact car and still had to climb out of the passenger side once parked.  Convenient if you need it, but hopefully you can avoid needing it.  Otherwise, there is a parking garage across the street.  

We had a great experience staying at the Seattle Center Inn.  Serina is a wonderful hostess; she is very communicative and answered all of our questions before and during our stay.  I would highly recommend her as a host and Seattle Center as an optimal location while you are visiting Seattle.  :-)  Thank you, Serina!"
