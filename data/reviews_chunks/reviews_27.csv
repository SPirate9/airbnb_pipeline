3821663,29777841,2015-04-12,30217881,Mark,Fabulous apartment. Great neighborhood. Easy check-in. All in all one of my best Air BnB experiences. 
3821663,30378359,2015-04-21,2044622,Joel,"I only saw my host briefly, when she was cleaning the building.   The bartender in the restaurant below was very helpful and welcoming.  It was easy to get the key.  The neighborhood was great, with a view overlooking Pioneer Square.  The area is in transition between being a little  seedy and hip.  The place was clean and spacious, although it was lacking in a place to sit down when eating and there was no place to store clothes other than a closet for hanging them.  However, Darcy brought a bar stool to make it possible to sit at the counter.  This should have been provided as a standard feature.  "
3821663,30665501,2015-04-26,26694464,Scott,"Check-in was easy - the bartender at the cafe where you pick up the keys was friendly. The apartment is super cute and clean.. very cozy. Love all the antique accents and exposed brick walls. Plenty of linens and towels. Having a kitchen was very convenient. Way better than a hotel! The area is convenient transportation-wise. Walking distance to a lot of touristy things, and close to a public transportation hub. As other reviews state, the only major negative was the weekend night noise. Our first night there was totally fine, but Friday & Saturday nights were very, very loud, as there is a nightclub right downstairs. Heavy bass from 11ish-2 am, yelling and bottles crashing kept both of us up until around 2:30. Definitely bring earplugs!! Otherwise, a great stay - still much preferable to a hotel. "
3821663,33068722,2015-05-25,5799447,Pat,"Great location to walk everywhere (one of the few Seattle areas that is not yet gentrified....which I appreciate.)  Unit was as described; easy check in; it was great having the Merchant's Cafe below -- bartenders and staff friendly.  The unit had all the basics; however, there is no microwave or toaster, no coffee table/side table/kitchen table; no chest of drawers in the bedroom.  I loved the big windows looking out on the street scene, and the TV was the best of any airbnb I have stayed at, as it included lots of cable channels, including ROOT for local sports coverage."
3821663,33503590,2015-05-29,29884652,John,"The apartment was fantastically decorated and up to date, with all utilities as described. We were able to check in very late with the bartender at the cafe below getting us set up despite it being after 10pm. In terms of location - the apartment is right on Pioneer Square so within staggering distance of the sports stadiums to the south and the city centre to the north, with public transport links nearby. No noise from the bar or neighbours. Good, prompt communication. "
3821663,35537977,2015-06-20,1897936,Rebecca,"This was a great place--excellent location, just as described. :)"
3821663,35658672,2015-06-21,7355578,Judy,"Our flight from San Francisco to Seattle was cancelled and we were put on another, later flight.  We did not arrive until midnight.  I was in contact with Darcy about what to do with our late arrival and how to get keys even if we arrived after 2am.  She even approved an hour later check out.  The apartment is quite charming: the pictures really show the historic appeal.  We really appreciated the ceiling fans in the living room and bedroom, the great water pressure in the shower, and the comfortable bed.  The location was perfect to walk to Safeco Stadium for baseball the next day.  We will definitely think about a return visit."
3821663,36203438,2015-06-26,34518705,Hillary,"This was my first experience with airbnb, and I would definitely use it again. The apartment was well furnished and clean. It was clear that the building and apartment are historic. The bed and couches are comfortable. The location of this listing is AMAZING, so close to (almost) everything you want to see in Seattle. We did experience some noise from the alley below the apartment very early in the morning, but didn't have much trouble going back to sleep. The wifi was spotty."
3821663,36954159,2015-07-03,29874008,Jeanette,It was great to have this as our home base while we were visiting Seattle. Darcy provided everything you could need while staying there and it was nice to know Merchants cafe was just down the stairs if we needed assistance.
3821663,37444227,2015-07-07,27806392,Matthew,"We had a pleasant experience staying here. Location is close to public transportation (busses, farry's, and light rail all within a few blocks). Easy access to and from the airport. Area does include some homeless folks, but it's a major city. Again, it's the heart of downtown so it's louder than the suburbs are at night. Our visit was during a heat wave, and with no AC we had windows open at night.  The area nightclubs do stay open late into the night.  It was nice to have some good couches and space to spread out and relax after a long day of walking and exploring the city. We didn't use the kitchen (too many restaurants very nearby to try), but it appeared to be well stocked. "
3821663,38379018,2015-07-15,15396401,Francis,"Wonderful location. Great looking appartment. No real eating facilities since the appartment has only one stool, no chair and no table, not even coffee table. Lack of basic kitchen tools like a real pot cooking simple things like pasta. Darcy was to slow to respond to sms to be really helpful with ou question. A chance that the employee of the Café are helpful. Darcy was also mixed up with dates an reservation (she send us an email 2 days after ou arrival, askign if we did cancel !). The room was not ready when we arrived (3 pm), the maid wa feeling so bad about that she forgot wet laundry into the washing machine and the dryer. More a ""(website hidden)"" kind of place than the real Airbnb spirit. Knowing that, still a good place to stay in this wonderful city."
3821663,38712213,2015-07-18,2500290,Yaroslav,Very clean and cozy apartment with an awesome location. Neighbourhood can be noisy. 
3821663,39013827,2015-07-20,34115242,Emily,"Great location, easy walking distance to the market and metro station.  Very cute, historic apartment, all the amenities you could need...minus A/C in unexpected 90 degree weather!  But heat aside, fantastic experience and would highly recommend."
3821663,39241435,2015-07-21,38594118,Kyle,"My wife and I had a great stay in Darcy's apartment, #302, which had a corner/end unit living room with views as well as a kitchenette, a nice sized bath equipped with a washer and dryer, and a separate bedroom with a comfortable bed. All towels and linens were clean and nice. It's nothing too fancy but the place was a fair price in a historic location and within spitting distance to Link light rail and Amtrak. The only negative for us was the outside noise level, which was considerable at times throughout the night."
3821663,39587426,2015-07-24,39233825,Eric,"It was good, the description was accurate.  The location was perfect and was close to many attractions that we wanted to see.  For my taste the bed was too soft.  When we first arrived it seemed like there was a double booking for our room, the guy checking us in gave us free drinks to keep us happy, thankfully our room was not double booked.  Good experience overall!"
3821663,39724937,2015-07-26,16290815,Matthew,"The location was perfect. If you are visiting Seattle without a car this is where you want to be. 1 block from the light rail station to SeaTac. Short walk to the stadiums and Pike place market.

The price was great. The room was nice and clean and the exposed brick In the 120+ y/o building was cool. 

The staff at merchants cafe were friendly and helpful.

This location is in the middle of a busy neighborhood and it will be loud at night. We were aware of this and were OK with it. If you are a light sleeper or easily annoyed by a car horn or drunken argument you have been forewarn.

The neighborhood is trendy with lots of restaurants,cafés, bars,galleries but also a neighborhood where you'll find homeless on the streets and pan handlers. Again this did not bother us. It's an issue in every city.

The only issue we had was with the WiFi not working.  We contacted Darcy and she had a staff member bring up a booster for the signal but that did not work either. She offered us a drink down stairs while we used the WiFi in the bar. While it was a very nice gesture and not having the internet in our room didn't ruin our weekend in was  disappointing.

We would stay again"
3821663,40202949,2015-07-29,30560876,Jarod,We had a great stay here. The pictures and description were accurate. This is a very cool building in a great location!
3821663,40455188,2015-07-31,104129,Brooke,"Fantastic location, clean and as pictured. No fuss."
3821663,41591170,2015-08-08,31825430,Amanda,"First time using air Bnb, could not be more pleased! Super easy check (email hidden) next door. Amazing location. Adorable little apartment. Great experience! "
3821663,42038634,2015-08-10,39763672,Ben,Everything was exactly as described and expected. Cute place in a cool location downtown. Great central location for everything in Seattle. Checking in and out was simple. Bedroom is in the back so the street noise wasn't a problem at all.
3821663,43169233,2015-08-17,35828761,동원 (Dale),I couldn't meet Darcy but other person in charge was kind and explained how to use the room well. Easy to find it with the information posted in airbnb. Location is very good to reach good tourist spot. There are good restaurants and Safeway next to this apartment so it was very convenient. Room is pretty broad compared with the price.
3821663,44106474,2015-08-24,254356,Shirley,This was our second stay at Darcy's.  The apartment is extremely comfortable and has everything you could need - washing machine and dryer very helpful.  The location is unbeatable - great bars and restaurants but being  inner city that means a bit of noise - wasn't a problem for us though.  Would happily stay again and also happy to recommend.
3821663,45304038,2015-09-01,41089553,Ben,"Before booking this apartment, allow me to share the good and the bad aspects of this rental unit.

First, the good. The apartment was a clean and tidy and pretty much as described. The bed was comfy and clean. We had no issues checking in, getting the key and felt warmly welcomed.

So far, so good.

Now, the not so good. For someone not familiar with the city of Seattle, it's hard to know prior to booking what the neighbourhood will be like. In this case, we were in for a real disappointment. Directly across the street from the second floor apartment is Pioneer Square, which at night turns into a hangout for drunks, drug addicts, and homeless people. With the sounds of fighting, bottles smashing, and yelling all night long, it becomes hard to get any sleep.

If you want somewhere peaceful to spend the night in Seattle, this is not the place. Be warned."
3821663,46155801,2015-09-08,38247905,Lyndee,"Overall, our stay was very nice. The property was listed accurately in a historic building that had both charm and intrigue. The only hiccup that we had was upon our arrival, trying to find parking. We recommend the parking garage, not directly across the street, but one street further--used by Best Western guests. Our first parking choice (behind the building) made us honeymooners from Kansas very uncomfortable. The area, while safe, holds many of the city's homeless because of the nearby social services. It was mostly a non-issue once we figured out where to park, but we did encounter a few aggressive panhandlers in the area. The bartender downstairs was GREAT, offering some fun insight into the area. He took care of us, to the extent of moving a microwave from another unoccupied room to ours. Overall, WE RECOMMEND--the history and experience are worth some discomfort outside the building. If you're used to the city, this is a non-issue anyway."
3821663,46485178,2015-09-11,346281,Gordon,"This is the place to stay when visiting Seattle!  A beautiful apartment within walking distance to pike market, safco field, capitol hill neighborhood, EMP museum and international district. Darcy made is super easy to check in/out and quickly responded to all questions.  I'm definetaly staying here the next time i come through Seattle. Also, another bonus you're a block away from the light rail which you can take to/from the airport.

"
3821663,47173707,2015-09-16,27180360,Lindsay,Great! Thanks! 
3821663,47377148,2015-09-18,41100541,Sach,"Place was quaint and good location between the stadiums and downtown tourist attractions. Neighbourhood is ""up & coming."" If didn't feel like walking, cabs were around $8-$10 to the (website hidden) staff were very friendly and helpful in Darcy's absence. Biggest complaint is the WiFi - never worked"
3821663,48023112,2015-09-22,18101884,David,"Awesome little apartment, great location in Pioneer Square.  Easy walk to everything downtown.  Check in/out couldn't be easier.  

One caveat- no decent overnight parking.  The area has a LOT of homeless people at night, and made me very nervous leaving our car. Darcy also warned us about many recent break-ins in the parking lot next door.  

So if you don't have a car(or can find a secured lot), I absolutely recommend the place."
3821663,48136401,2015-09-23,20553514,Claudia,"Good location, we like to walk so it was perfect for us. The apartment feel was very cute felt at home. The bed was extremely comfortable, we had a great sleep. We will definitely be back here when we are in Seattle again"
3821663,48188024,2015-09-24,28218888,Emily,"Let me start with the positives. Darcy let me check in early and and check out late. Also, the bartender that provided me with the keys, carried my 50lb suitcase up three flights of stairs for me.  The apartment is cute and in a great location for sightseeing. I walked to Pikes Market and the Space Needle.

On the negative side, I found out when I was checking in that the building was said to be haunted.  It was even featured on a TV show.  I didn't have any ghostly encounters, but I wish I had known that prior to my reservation.

However, if that kind of thing doesn't bother you, Darcy was very accommodating and it's a great location."
3821663,48540683,2015-09-27,21751512,Tom,"We had a great stay above the Merchants Cafe. We didn't get the opportunity to spend a lot of time there, too busy being out on the town, but the location and the turn of the century feel of the apartments was definitely the kind of place worth staying at again!"
3821663,48765011,2015-09-28,43415614,June,"This was a great place and a great stay right in downtown Seattle. It's two blocks from the waterfront, across the street from some yummy eats and about half a mile from Pike Place Market. The pictures accurately show the apartment and it was as close to a hotel stay as I could get for a very reasonable price. The apartment looks just like the pictures for the listing. Linens were provided, the bed was very comfortable, WiFi worked well and there were nice amenities like a coffee maker, small fridge and stove available for use. I'd definitely stay there again -- it's a super convenient, great and safe place right in the middle of everything!   
A few things to consider (that I considered) based on others reviews of the property:
- Yes there is noise. The apartment is in downtown, on top of a bar. If you are a light sleeper, this place will not work for you. Between the folks who are leaving the bar late at night or the trash truck coming at 3 am, you will not sleep. But, if you're like me and can sleep through pretty much anything, you will be all set.
- Stairs and walking. If you have any sort of physical impairment or really large luggage, this may not be the place for you. Darcy was very explicit in saying both in the listing and in-person that it is a historical building. That means lots of stairs and no elevator. The apartment is on the top floor. It wasn't a problem for me, but may be a problem for others."
3821663,49233355,2015-10-02,25639967,俐桦,The apartment itself is great. The location is (website hidden) just 1km far to the Pike Market.But there are so many homeless around the building.And my husband lost his wallet in the street .Maybe it was stolen.
3821663,49652902,2015-10-05,33861657,Justin,"Darcy actually bumped me to a different, better apartment in the same building. She gave me the option to switch, with plenty of advance notice. The location was nice, within walking distance to many bars, restaurants and local attractions. The apartment I rented was clean, well decorated and had everything I needed. 

I would strongly recommend this location as long as you're comfortable with the standard noisy nature of being in a vibrant downtown area. "
3821663,50993741,2015-10-16,795353,Brad,Had a great experience - super easy check in/out and the place itself was clean and as described. The location is about as good as it gets in Seattle: very transit connected and walkable to most downtown locations. 
3821663,51544173,2015-10-21,43816759,Don,"This was a great apartment in the oldest part of town. The Pioneer Square neighborhood has a great feel for art and historic venues. The apartment was clean and secure. I would gladly stay here again. There is a prevalence of homelessness in the area surrounding the location. We were able to receive over 100 requests for handouts during our stay. It is unfortunate that we were unable to enjoy the park across the street from the apartment. I hope that the City of Seattle works to resolve this problem, so that Darcy can fully capitalize on the Merchant's Cafe location."
3821663,51798772,2015-10-24,20446123,Tung,"If you're looking for a place that's conveniently located to many of the popular attractions (Pike Place Market, Space Needle, etc.) and also walking distance to the Amtrak King Street Station, this would be a good choice to consider. However, I wouldn't recommend staying for more than 1-2 nights here.

In addition to what many reviewers have already mentioned about this apartment being noisy, we found this apartment to be far from a pleasant, restful stay. The wifi signal was weak and erratic. If wifi is important to you, I wouldn't recommend this apartment. 

Also, the communication with the owner was very poor. We never received any greeting or proactive communication aside from the automated message after we put down the deposit. This is very much unlike most of the Airbnbs that we've stayed at all over the country where the owners are so proactive to help and welcome their guests.

The greeting by the female bartender was (email hidden) downstairs, which is where you check-in. My wife and I found this check-in process to be a bit awkward, and the bartender that particular afternoon was not very friendly to us at all. We were the guests and we felt like we were burdening her for some reason. It was not the welcome we anticipated from Airbnb as you are usually greeted by the host -- not a bartender. We actually never saw the host during our stay. 

The only time we communicated with the host was when the toilet overflowed upon our first flush. There was no plunger anywhere to be found in the apartment. We were concerned that the single toilet would be broken for the night so we reached out to the host right away. She responded by instructing us to talk to the bartender downstairs. As a paying guest, I was expecting someone from the bar to come upstairs to help us as the toilet was actively overflowing. Eventually, someone came up with us to plunge the toilet. No Lysol or disinfectant was used. The gentleman was nice, but he basically wiped the urine with a towel to clean up the overflow. No apology or follow-up was ever given to us by the owner. 

Needless to say, we will spend a little more money next time to find a better apartment with much better service."
3821663,52091327,2015-10-26,24915109,Dmitriy,"The apartment was nice. Having a kitchen and washer/dryer was great. I've read some comments about the neighborhood but those people must have never visited a city before. Don't look like an obvious tourist, and the beggars won't approach you. It felt perfectly safe coming home at night. One issue--The apartment I received was not the one I booked, which was annoying because it put us right above the bar instead of on the third floor. "
3821663,52272573,2015-10-27,778456,Bob,A comfortable place in the heart of old Seattle. Very conveniently located close the light rail link to SEA TAC. Perfect for me short stay. 
3821663,52697759,2015-11-01,35654662,Guy,"We never met Darcy, but it was easy to get the keys from the restaurant downstairs and the apartment was incredible. This apartment is beautiful, clean, and in a great area of town for sight-seeing and enjoying the city. 

It is a little loud at night, but that should be expected when staying in downtown Seattle. We highly recommend this apartment to anyone staying for a weekend in the area, it has a unique and historic vibe. Plus, there are a lot of great restaurants nearby and things to see. 

Thank you, Darcy! "
3821663,53255052,2015-11-07,45111314,Jason,"Great location if you're looking to do stuff downtown (it's VERY walkable to a TON of concert venues and the stadiums).  LOTs of great food and drinkin' to be had in very close proximity.  

Only drawback is it can be a bit noisy in the wee hours (mostly due to the recycling truck making rounds at 3 a.m.!) but, hey, you're in the City.  It's to be expected.

Apartment was clean and easy to access.  Be prepared to climb some stairs though.  Easy to get the key and easy to return it."
3821663,53577674,2015-11-09,40497712,Christina,"Good, comfortable, as advertised.
Great location, comfortable bed, comfortable furniture."
3821663,53972414,2015-11-15,44918127,Nisa,"This place is adorable. Directly across from the park it doesn't get more historic than this. Very clean! Quiet. Interesting building and location. But beware of the stairs--26 steep steps just to the second floor and we were on the third. For travelers with mobility issues the stairs really are a consideration. For travelers with good knees, it's a great choice--reasonably quiet for the location, close to public transit, great neighborhood with wonderful restaurants and watering holes. There is a popular nightclub in the building and a great old fashioned historic saloon on the first floor. We enjoyed our stay."
3821663,54726248,2015-11-23,31422422,Holly,Amazing experience. The apartment was beyond adorable and very clean. 
3821663,54852905,2015-11-25,9209980,Nancy,"We never met Darcy nor conferred with her directly, but her employees were pleasant when they showed us the apartment. Aside from the considerable nighttime road noise, we enjoyed our brief stay. It was very convenient to public transit and downtown Seattle sites. The bed was very comfortable, but the space (and shower walls) could have been cleaner. Generally, the feeling was more impersonal, like a hotel, than what I have come to enjoy about Airbnb stays. "
5538874,33438085,2015-05-28,3004696,Theresa,It was great staying at Cheryl's place. its clean and comfy! and its close to the mall and downtown. Public transportation there is super convenient. I would totally recommend staying at Cheryl if anyone is going to Seattle. 
5538874,43305349,2015-08-18,40691724,Gaowa,I had happy experience with Cheryl. Her address  is convenient to commute. Her house was clean and comfortable. Cheryl is knowledgeable and nice. Thanks to Cheryl.
5538874,46619417,2015-09-12,15690939,Thiago,"Cheryl, her family and the place are so great that I decided to be back one year later. Easy to take buses to everywhere, friendly neighborhood, and helpful tips from the host.

O lugar é exatamente como mencionado na descrição, a vizinhança tem tudo que você precisa (ônibus para toda a cidade, lugares para comer, shoppings) e a Cheryl é muito prestativa, paciente e gente fina. Ela me ajudou bastante com dicas sobre a cidade! Recomendo o lugar."
7075948,44797937,2015-08-29,17068845,Akhbar,Great townhouse in Seattle! Everything you need to have a very comfortable stay. 
1244053,5468594,2013-07-01,5888251,Stefan,"Had a great stay with Dan. He has a nice small room on the ground level for you where you can really be on your own. You enter the apartment throught a sliding door in a small and shady backyard, which is great as the place stays cool on hot days and you can keep the sliding door open for a bit of fresh air. There is a curtain to keep you protected from any unwanted sights at night.
The room has just enough space for one person and its belongings, but you can also stay there with two persons in a queen-size bed, which I found very comfortable to sleep in.

You enter the actual apartment through a door with a keypad lock which sometimes fails to lock again and then constantly retries to lock itself. It helps when you unlock the door again once or twice without it being shut.

There is a small bathroom on the first level together with kitchen and living room. You can make use of the kitchen but I didn't as there were so many great places to eat just around the corner. Upstairs once more there are private bedrooms and a bigger bathroom with a shower, that you can also use if you want.

Dan and his housemate Michael are really nice guys and they will surely help you where they can - also with recommending entertainment options. Unfortunately, I haven't had much time to spend with these guys but they are really up for it so you shouldn't be shy.

The biggest plus of this place, however, is its great location in the center of Capitol Hill close to the main streets with bars and restaurants of all sorts. So you really have no reason to stay in your room for a longer time.

I really enjoyed my time there and would gladly come back for another stay.

-- Stefan"
1244053,5743073,2013-07-14,1211814,Sarah,This was such a great place!! Dan's place is absolutely beautiful in a really cool location of Seattle. Within walking distance are more stores/bars/restaurants than you could ever imagine not to mention some wonderful parks to relax in. Capitol hill is one of my favorite places in Seattle and to be able to enjoy it then come back and relax in a nice clean room was the icing on the cake:) The room is the perfect size for one or 2 people with private access and wifi. Dan provided me towels and access to the rest of his home where I felt completely comfortable and safe. He was prompt with answering questions and was great about texting me back when I needed something. I'll def be back!! 
1244053,5813448,2013-07-17,2545308,Wendy,"Dan and his housemate were wonderful! Accommodating and friendly. The house is beautiful and the room is clean, private, and perfect for budget travelers :)  The bed fit two people easily. Location was also great -- quiet neighborhood within 5min walking distance to lively restaurants, bars, and coffeeshops (stumptown just around the corner!) Easy walk to downtown Seattle."
1244053,5956168,2013-07-23,2749978,Bradford,"I was in town for a week for a shoot & just needed a place to crash at night. Dan's place was perfect for it. Located in a great part of Capitol Hill with free parking all around. Although I never met Dan, everything was ready when I arrived & he checked in several times to make sure the stay was going well. I give it a strong 5 stars. "
1244053,6039062,2013-07-27,2631216,Daria,"Dan is an amazing host! He has arranged everything for my stay in less than an hour. Very responsible and helpful.
Dan is very hospitable and made me feel welcomed. I had a feeling that I had met an old friend whom I haven't seen for a long time :)
I was blessed to meet such opened and kind person as Dan!
"
1244053,6116753,2013-07-30,47242,Virginie,Dan's appartment is perfectly located in a great neighbourhood! The appartment is clean and the room very private. Dan was a great host and he made sure I had all the information I needed to get there. Once I arrived he walked me through the neighborhood and invite me to join him and his friend for dinner. It was fun hanging out with him and I would recommand his place to anyone in Seattle. 
1244053,6250969,2013-08-05,7410764,Arran,This is a great spot - waking distance to most of where I wanted to be in Seattle. The room has sliding door on to a small shady patio which was lovely. 
1244053,6906013,2013-08-29,766675,Ivan,"Dan was amazing - he and his roommate welcomed me with open arms, shared stories and traded tips. His place was right in the middle of Pike/Pine and near to amazing array of food!"
1244053,6987577,2013-09-02,3510661,Michael,"Dan is a charming and accommodating host. He is responsible, responsive, and professional. His place is clean, beautiful, and located very close to downtown Seattle. I had fun getting to know him and his roommate Michael over the weekend that I stayed there. I would highly recommend staying here when visiting the city."
1244053,7079429,2013-09-05,8388491,Joe,"Dan and his roommate were pleasant, very hospital and accommodating. Enjoyed my brief stay and would recommend Dan's place to anyone."
1244053,13527038,2014-05-29,15178088,Jenny,Dan and his housemate were friendly and generous. The room has a great outdoor space attached to it and the house is in an excellent spot. Great place to stay!
1244053,14748977,2014-06-25,2359525,Martin,"Dan was a great host, very welcoming and helpful at all points. The room is nice, set at the bottom of the house and though not massive certainly not small either and very comfortable. The rest of the place is great with good kitchen/bathroom facilities etc. The place is really a short walk from the heart of Capitol Hill so thoroughly recommendable for anyone wanting to check out that area! Good stay, thanks Dan!"
1244053,16016037,2014-07-20,15853236,Hannah,"Both Dan and his housemate Michael were really welcoming and friendly it was great hanging out with the pair of them during my stay.

The house is great - really conveniently located near to Capitol Hill (but not so near it's noisy); and it's just a 20 minute walk to the downtown area.

I'd recommend it to anyone looking to stay in Seattle and would definitely stay there again next time I'm in town."
1244053,16137303,2014-07-22,17429102,Gabe,"Dan was a wonderful host and his home is extremely comfortable. Also, the location is fantastic. Great place. "
1244053,16365565,2014-07-26,2779882,Marcus,"My 1st time trying airbnb.  Wow - great choice.  Dan is a really great host, everything was exactly as described.  Bed's comfortable and location is great.  So many great bars, restaurants, coffee shops (and a Ferrari dealership....) within 5 minutes walk.  You can walk to downtown (20+ minutes?) or catch a bus, or Uber it.  Great value place and I'll aim to stay again next time I'm in Seattle."
1244053,17109513,2014-08-07,3229431,Kieran,"Dan was very welcoming and friendly throughout my stay. I would describe him as jovial and easygoing. The house is nice and Dan was gracious enough to let me do laundry while I was there. The bed is comfy and the room nice and cool. You have to go upstairs to reach the toilet and two flights up to the shower but that wasn't a problem for me.

The location is good - easy bus routes to downtown and walking distance to plenty of Capitol Hill eateries. Someone told me it's not so safe to walk round at night time, but I felt completely fine. Also, ""not safe"" by Seattle standards is still safer than most places!"
1244053,18433201,2014-08-26,12035164,Renaud,"My stay with Dan was great! His apartment is very well kept and the room is actually pretty spacious. I had to move up and bring all my boxes with me, Dan lent me a visitor parking pass and even gave me a grace period to move my boxes out.

I would definitely recommend his place in the future. As a host he is very friendly and knowledgeable about the Seattle area."
1244053,19044176,2014-09-05,17160701,Anke,"Comfy bed, great location, walking (or in my case, biking) distance to all kinds of restaurants. Thanks, Dan!"
1244053,19318476,2014-09-10,17893566,Kangsan,that room was really great and house was so nice!!! there was very bright and clean space. so I felt comfortable. and Dan was too kind host to me.
1244053,19567757,2014-09-14,7150074,Hannah,"Dan was super helpful before my arrival and communicated accommodations and directions super clearly. The room was spacious and the house was very clean and nice. Great location - lots of food spots nearby. Michael, his roommate, showed me around Seattle a little bit and was super gracious. I would definitely recommend this spot if you're looking for a space walking distance to downtown and in a quiet area. "
1244053,36444480,2015-06-28,5887614,Courtney,"Dan is an excellent host, and his location is extremely convenient for interstate access, easy walk to downtown,  great proximity to bars and restaurants,  easy walk to the pike place market and very clean and safe area. The room is cozy and spacious with a walk out to a lovely outdoor area. Would absolutely recommend."
1244053,39649920,2015-07-25,36622269,Leverett,"It was great. He clearly puts a lot of thought and effort into making sure his guests are comfortable. He set up a system to provide a key at 3AM, and throughout my 2-3 weeks he was constantly making improvements to his service. The situation is great, his place is very nice and perfectly clean, and you have a very isolated, individual place to stay. Extremely good value. I was incredibly and pleasantly surprised."
1244053,40166626,2015-07-28,7422754,Gabriel,Dan was really welcoming and had a very nice downstairs space.  Very clean space and private bathroom to use. Location was unbeatable for exploring the city!
1244053,40524200,2015-07-31,4050812,Katherine,"Dan's home is a beautiful 3-story home in a fun, conveniently located neighborhood. However, the quality of my stay was affected by the fact that I was accidentally locked in my room overnight. The door of the bedroom has an electric keypad I suppose to prevent intruders entering the house from the patio off of the bedroom, but unfortunately when I closed the bedroom door it locked behind me and I was trapped overnight in the bedroom until Dan saw all of my texts and calls asking him to let me put early that morning. It of course was not intentional, but it definitely affected my stay and was a pretty significant oversight."
1244053,41225315,2015-08-05,36640454,Robin,"Dan's place is amazing. The location is great, and Dan is very friendly and welcoming. Everything is clean, and all facilities you would want are present."
1244053,41769799,2015-08-09,27241527,David,Dan is an amazing host. He has a beautiful home and I would recommend it to anyone. 
1244053,42702749,2015-08-15,35520166,Ian,"Dan made me feel very welcome by contacting me before I arrived with the access arrangements, by being friendly and helpful and making me feel very comfortable in using his house. I also enjoyed the conversations I had with him and he appeared comfortable and relaxed with my being there."
1244053,44430197,2015-08-26,37204101,Jakub,"My stay was really pleasant one. Everything was clean, place looked even better than on pics. 
We hanged out for a beer with Dan and he was very kind and friendly. 
"
1244053,45271930,2015-09-01,38615880,Kain,"The place looks exactly as the picture described. When I got in, Dan introduced himself, and we had a great conversation about random things. He is very personable and friendly, and it became somewhat apparent that Dan has an innate interest in meeting interesting people, and that is why he is opening up his swank home to select strangers. I'll also note that his bathroom shower has an excellent shower handle in that you set temperature separately from water volume."
1244053,46292811,2015-09-09,40120798,Dallas,"Dan was really nice and friendly, a great host if your not from the area! He suggested some good restaurant to check out which were great, room was nice with my own patio had a great time thanks Dan!"
1244053,48099863,2015-09-23,8684022,Steffi,"I really had a great time staying at Dan's place. It's a wonderful, modern apartment perfectly located in Capitol Hill. Easy access to several bus lines going downtown, lots of breakfast, lunch and dinner options close by. Dan was a great host, welcoming and friendly, he even gave me the bigger room in his apartment since it was not occupied. I can definitely recommend this place."
1244053,56271477,2015-12-11,22777516,Cole,"My stay was great.  Dan's place is clean, handsome and inviting.  Dan is a fantastic host."
6691873,34265656,2015-06-06,19143765,Elaine,"My son and I were Becca's very first guests!  This little room is cozy, and though it is in a basement, plenty of light comes in from the east and the walls and furniture are cheery. It was very cool inside as well.  It feels very quiet and private.  

Becca's is so sweet too.  She really wanted to make sure we were well taken care of.  She didn't miss a single consideration."
6691873,34683804,2015-06-10,34825629,Alexey,"Very nice basement, tidy, quite and got everything you'll need during your stay.
The hostess was very helpfull and attended to all our needs.
Thanks for the small treats as well!"
6691873,34908667,2015-06-13,3294721,Bonnie,"Every little detail was thought of, honey for my coffee, tea, and even a tasty chocolate treat.  Private and cozy, it is a good location within walking distance to green lake.  "
6691873,35023227,2015-06-14,22619582,Paloma,"Becca was a perfect host. The air B&B was better than described in the pictures. Very cute, quaint, and adorable private room with separate entrance which was nice. Highly recommend her as a host. She even gave me a wonderful chocolate bar! ❤️
Thanks Becca! "
6691873,35164903,2015-06-15,9872206,Agita,"We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay-- home away from home. Would recomend to everyone who is looking for a small, cozy and private place to stay in Seattle. Becca is an amazing host."
6691873,35427834,2015-06-18,3831130,Lisa,"Becca's cute little downstairs basement room was perfect.  Comfy bed. Hot shower.  My boyfriend and I found awesome bars and enjoyed an awesome breakfast place minutes away.  Super easy to get the Space Needle, EDM, etc... 6pm traffic to downtown for the Underground tour wasn't too bad.  Loved being so close to Ballard district!  Id recommend Becca's place!!"
6691873,35846905,2015-06-22,15911238,Tor,"Cozy space, nice garden, good neighborhood, great host!   Very welcoming.  Even allowed us to charge our PHEV.   Our stay in Seattle was tops due, in part, to our stay here.  Note to 'long' people (>6ft) - the ceilings are low (it's a basement after all), so gotta watch your head. "
6691873,35971543,2015-06-23,34714761,Shannon,Becca was great! We rolled into town quite late and she stayed up to show us the apartment and give us keys. Almond milk in the fridge and a chocolate bar were a great touch. Just as cute as expected!
6691873,36802877,2015-07-01,23745649,Amit,"Becca runs one of the best Airbnbs I've ever seen. She's an experienced traveler, so she knows how to make her guests feel comfortable. The room is perfectly equipped and has a comfortable separate entrance. The house is an a quiet area but close enough to downtown Seattle and SLU. I'd definitely recommend Becca to others."
6691873,36922640,2015-07-02,36833798,Whitney,"My husband and I had a lovely stay in this apartment.  It's located in a great part of Seattle and close to bus stops. I loved the ""little touches"" provided.  We would absolutely come back again if we're in town."
6691873,36977153,2015-07-03,18664777,Elle,"Becca sets the standard for Airbnb hosts! Not only did she greet us as we came in, but she showed us to the space & provided a tour. She even brought down additional condiments for coffee in the morning. This spot is perfect. It has everything you need, plus a cozy atmosphere."
6691873,37584766,2015-07-08,31981121,Daniela,"Becca was the ideal host! My friends and I have been traveling via Air Bnb for a month now and this was our last stop. Becca made everything so easy, comfortable, and homey that we really appreciated her as the end to our cross country trip. 

Not only was check-in super easy, even though we made it to the apartment fairly late, but when we arrived we were greeted with chocolate, coffee and beer in the refrigerator, a bathroom stocked with toiletries, and a clean cozy space. After a long drive, it was exactly what we needed. We could tell how much thought she put into her rental. 

We were able to meet Becca the next day - and her cute dog - the next day where she provided a ton of super helpful information about Seattle and the surrounding area. 

Overall, the stay was exactly what we needed and Becca was one of the most accommodating hosts we've had so far, I would definitely recommend staying at her place for your trip to Seattle! "
6691873,37699748,2015-07-09,15414432,Jim,"This was a great apartment!  Everything was as described, the space was private, clean, and quiet.  Communication with Becca was easy and straightforward.  I would definitely recommend this apartment."
6691873,38245275,2015-07-13,8944024,Robin,"I reserved this place for a friend of mine who needed it last minute. It was my first time on BnB and it was confusing to navigate. Becca was understanding, and made the navigation easier for me. She was able to respond very quickly to my inquiry, was very kind and accommodating. Becca's studio was CUTE, clean, comfortable, equipped, and cheery. Becca left a kind note, and a rose by the bed. Plus coffee was there for the morning. I will definitely be saving this listing for when family comes into town again. Thank you Becca!"
6691873,38538354,2015-07-16,18004281,Alyssa,Becca was very accomodating and helpful! She was always available when we needed her. The description of the apt was accurate. The neighborhood was cute and quaint and like she described as well.
6691873,38877302,2015-07-19,35634202,Domenic,My girlfriend and I loved Becca's basement apartment. It was just what we needed for a nice weekend in town. Her place is filled with lots of charm and made us feel at home.
6691873,39199072,2015-07-21,36671849,Jordan,"My fiancee and I stayed in Becca's for two nights - it had everything we needed, and Becca was very helpful if we needed anything. My fiancee commented multiple times on how much she liked the style/design of the space; it's very colorful. There was also plenty of parking in front of the house. 

The one issue for me was the height of the ceiling. It's not something that's going to affect a lot of people - I'm 6'5 - but if you're a tall person, you will have to duck your head to move around at times. "
6691873,39424852,2015-07-23,13160670,Janine,"We had a lovely time at Becca's basement apartment. She was a gracious host leaving snacks and chocolate with her welcome note. This little spot had everything we needed (even a washer/dryer!) for out two night stay. The location was on point - close to Ballard and Fremont and a great little spot called Vif. Everything else was a short ride away. Bonuses were the cute little garden entrance and her sweet doggie, Bowie."
6691873,39779345,2015-07-26,35508070,Layton,"My girlfriend and I really enjoyed Becca's Cozy Basement Apartment. It is just as she describes it. It's quiet, clean and comfortable. It's easy to find, and in a great location. We spent 3 nights, and would stay there again. We also enjoyed the Ballard area restaurants and coffee shops. We'll certainly recommend this apartment to our friends."
6691873,40066777,2015-07-27,20919654,Kevin,My brother and I stayed at Becca's home for a night. The apartment was comfortable (even though the ceiling felt a little low). Becca and her dog were very welcoming and gave a good recommendation for breakfast. There were also a few good bars about a half mile from the home to have a nightcap.
6691873,40346207,2015-07-30,36665241,Natalie,"Our stay at Becca's apartment was perfect! Everything was lovely, clean, nice - perfect size for two people to stay. Getting in and out was easy - I wish we had gotten to meet Becca, because all the notes in the guestbook couldn't say enough good about how great she is! We would definitely stay at Becca's again and would recommend her to anyone."
6691873,40483701,2015-07-31,20673298,Davy,"Becca was such a kind and gracious host!
Her place was cute, comfortable, and a great stop for us on our honeymoon. Her dog is friendly, it's in a great location, and it is in a great location. We would recommend to anyone, and will be back next time we visit Seattle!"
6691873,40658413,2015-08-01,8521908,Carrie,"Becca was a great hostess. . . super accommodating and welcoming. The local chocolate and apple snack was an unexpected perk. . . and waking up with coffee available to make was rad.
The #28 bus runs right by and takes you to the heart of downtown Seattle. This and the free street parking make this a great spot to adventure from. "
6691873,41093974,2015-08-04,2300474,Sarah,"Becca's place was just as described-comfortable, clean and well equipped for my husband and I. Location was great, close to some gems including Chucks Hop Shop (great beer & food trucks) and Four Spoons (best breakfast ever!). Also within walking distance to groceries and public transportation. A longish, but totally doable, walk to Green Lake. Overall, a great value and a nice place to stay."
6691873,41440035,2015-08-07,7321470,Michelle,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at Becca's basement apartment.  The location was great, loved getting away from the main Seattle downtown area and into a more locals scene.  The apartment and grounds were clean, cute, and comfortable.  We didn't have a chance to meet Becca but she kindly accommodated our late evening arrival and arranged to get the key to us.  "
6691873,41766122,2015-08-09,35464344,Michael,"In a pinch I would recommend this listing. If not, pass. After all it's a basement and smells like one too! Very low ceilings and musty. My girlfriend and I had a wedding to prepare for during our stay and we encountered a blown fuse issue which meant no light or power in the location we needed it most, and that was the bathroom. With the hostess at work we were not able to take care of the situation. At that point we really missed the ease of staying at a hotel. It was a good experience but would definitely chose a different location next time."
6691873,43054149,2015-08-17,6397001,Sarah,"We found Becca's apartment to be perfect for our stay in Seattle. It's cozy and clean, with a very comfy bed. It's in a great neighborhood, and between the bus and Uber we had a very easy time getting around. Her recommendations for places to eat and drink are excellent, and we found we could walk to all of them. We didn't get to meet Becca face to face, as she was away during our stay. But she responds to emails very quickly, is a great communicator, and had friends available, had we needed anything. (We didn't) We found her to be a thoughtful and kind host, and had a great experience!"
6691873,43295947,2015-08-18,40312115,Gina,Becca was an accommodating host with her flexibility in our check in and out times. The home was in a safe neighborhood with ample street parking. The space is in a basement so it is cozy spot for 2 people. Becca's personalized touches in the decor helped make this an inviting place to stay for a night. Having access to a washer/dryer in the apartment was fantastic. We enjoyed a quick drive (15 minutes or so) to the heart of Seattle and returned to this space for a quiet retreat.
6691873,43429376,2015-08-19,5061133,Lindsay,"Becca's place was perfect for our stay in Seattle.  Though described as small, it was more than enough space for 2 of us, and had many additional amenities.  Becca also has a beautiful yard, and we enjoyed sitting out there in the evening.  The neighborhood was quiet, with several restaurants/bars and a grocery store within easy walking distance. Becca was easy to communicate with, and responded very quickly to any questions we had.  Everything was great!"
6691873,43592683,2015-08-20,1809464,Rudy,Accurate listing! I had a great experience. Becca makes you feel very welcome. There was coffee and creamer as promised. Definitely recommend! 
6691873,44142776,2015-08-24,36155027,Michael,Becca was a very generous host. Friendly but also private. I will definitely check with her first next time I come to Seattle.  
6691873,44810341,2015-08-29,2423382,Shaina,"Becca was nothing but warm and welcoming. My Fiance and I had such a wonderful stay in her cozy basement apartment. It literally had everything we could need! And an adorable patio/courtyard area out front to enjoy our coffee. She gave us great dinner recommendations, and pointed us to the best place to watch the sunset with a bottle of wine - Golden Gardens State Park :) Thank you, Becca!! "
6691873,45661120,2015-09-05,11023190,Deborah ( & Glenn ),"Becca's apt was really great, yes it's  small  but it is set up in a really clever way with all you need.  Beccas personal style is evident throughout with  lots of art and quirkiness.:) my husband is 6ft 6 and he did have to bend (we knew it was height challenged when we booked) but even that didn't detract as everything else was perfect! Great bus access close by and suoer mkt 15 min walk woukd def stay again Becca was really nice too :)"
6691873,46728174,2015-09-13,38978161,Bernard,"The place was spotless when we got there, all the amenities were available, and it was exactly as described. There was a grocery store and an excellent brewhouse close by, and many great restaurants within walking distance. About a block away, there was a bus that went straight downtown, which was very convenient, and the neighbourhood felt very safe and secure. The space was small, but did not feel like it, as it was skillfully decorated. I enjoyed staying here, and would highly recommend it -- Becca was an excellent host. "
6691873,47310517,2015-09-17,3766917,Sean,"We had a nice 4 night stay in Becca's basement apartment.  The host was very communicative, and answered questions promptly.  The ceilings are fairly low, so you'll probably only feel comfortable if you're less than 6'.  Having a washer and dryer was convenient, and the house is close to bus lines downtown, and roughly a mile to Green Lake.  "
6691873,47887619,2015-09-21,5878584,Ty,Becca's little studio was perfect! She did a great job to make it feel comfortable and private.  Becca also went out of her way to make sure I had everything I need on different occasions. Great host and wonderful studio. 
6691873,48239702,2015-09-24,5419530,Shawn,"I had a great stay at Becca's. She was very communicative and helpful!  I think it's a great price for what you get, which is a very simple, comfortable, cozy apartment.  I will definitely stay again. "
6691873,56465948,2015-12-13,23538119,Jeremy,"Becca was very hospitable and flexible, allowing me to check-in an hour early than our pre-coordinated time.  She was very friendly and even invited us to an event she was hosting.  This was a cozy apartment with all the amenities could want (coffee, laundry, etc...).  This is a great launching point for a night in Ballard and the shower is amazing too!"
6691873,56997793,2015-12-20,14207615,Steve,We had a great stay at Becca's place. Highly recommend this spot if you want to see Seattle outside of the tourist areas. She was very easy to communicate with and coordinate our arrival and check in time.
7035498,39890160,2015-07-26,2795861,Gabriel,"The place is flawless.  Super convenient and close to tons of interesting parts of Seattle.   I would definitely recommend it, my one reservation was that there was a management company handling the property which required a complicated agreement in addition to airbnb and dealing with them was a bit impersonal.  I understand I was the first stay so maybe they will be able to work that out.  "
7035498,40181569,2015-07-28,13222324,Stacy,The studio was very clean and comfortable and most importantly close to everthing!
7035498,41006288,2015-08-03,39075003,Michael,"John was a very helpful host and quick to respond. The studio was very clean when we arrived. It was exactly as advertised: close to the major landmarks of Seattle, spacious yet cozy, and clean. There's a Whole Foods close by and if you want to take public transportation, especially to explore the other neighborhoods of Seattle, there are many bus routes that stop within a block and Westlake station is just a 10 min walk."
7035498,41467698,2015-08-07,31607450,Omar,"The place was nice. It's a cool older building (not really old, just compared to some of the newer stuff popping up in Seattle). The location & neighborhood is great!"
7035498,41675725,2015-08-08,8815369,Cari,We loved the house! It was set in a peaceful area of town but only a short drive to a small market and pub. We would definitely stay there again! 
7035498,42442923,2015-08-13,33663815,James,"My wife and I greatly enjoyed our stay in this jewel of an apartment.  The location was perfect; situated about half a mile south of the Needle and in the midst of several good restaurants. There is a small grocery store nearby and a donut/coffee shop next door -whether that temptation is a good thing depends on your level of self control :) the unit itself had everything we needed: a kitchen,  washing machine,  nice bathroom,  sizeable closet (with wooden hangers! ), and comfortable bed. Netflix and free wifi were a nice touch as well.  John was a great host.  He responded promptly to every request and was extremely helpful. We look forward to our next stay in this jewel box!"
7035498,42633181,2015-08-14,41108783,Pj,"John and the ""Jewel Box"" were a true gem, Being a hotelier this was my first AIRBNB and the city was full and overpriced. The studio was comfortable, clean and secure. The location is prime. Thanks John and Jewel Box."
7035498,42937610,2015-08-16,40060068,Ben,Everything was described. A perfect location for all we wanted to do. Walked to a Hawks game. Restaurant choices galore. Absolute pleasure. 
7035498,43661430,2015-08-21,39453187,Jay,"A great place to stay while visiting Seattle! Very central location downtown. Plenty of cool places to go nearby for food and drink. Walking distance to the Space Needle / museums and also the aquarium / Pike Place / the ferry.

The apartment was plenty big for my gf and I. More affordable than all the hotel rooms we looked at as well.

Clean, quiet...we'd stay here again!"
7035498,43842476,2015-08-22,42642,Antonia,The studio is ideally located and was very clean. I had a nice stay.
7035498,44561834,2015-08-27,39875598,Gabriela,"John was an amazing host who answered all emails promptly. The apartment was clean, comfortable, and in a fantastic location. This was our first time using Airbnb and we couldn't be happier with our hosts and the apartment. Thank you for making our Seattle stay such a  great one! "
7035498,45117597,2015-08-31,37825135,Rie,I really enjoyed staying there. There were everything that we needed. There were manuals about the house and I could find everything that I wanted to use easily. 
7035498,45711768,2015-09-05,1536163,Cecilia,"The Jewel Box was sweet, emaculately clean and well appointed and in a hip neighborhood. It looked just like it did in the Airbnb photos and was close to great restaurants and the ferries. John thoughtfully left a welcoming note and a basket of snacks to enjoy.  These were really lovely touches. 

Also, the Jewel Box is on the ground floor so it made getting in and out with luggage easy. 

My two recommendations are if you're a light sleeper bring an eye mask, and *make sure* to read the instructions for getting into the Jewel Box before arriving. It is an elaborate entry process and not one you want to figure out tired and late at night. 

Also, the third party hospitality manager who manages this property has a 24 hour customer service line. If you call and get disconnected a couple times, keep trying. The customer service representatives are helpful and have good customer management skills, like patience."
7035498,46291011,2015-09-09,28661446,Marlys,"This could not have been a better location for us. We were able to walk everywhere and it was a real pleasure to be without a car. The space is well appointed and beautifully decorated. There are clever details everywhere, including cell phone and iPad connectors inthe bedside drawer. The kitchen has all the right equipment for food preparation and service. We didn't really feel the need to cook with all the fine restaurant fare nearby, but it's all there in the kitchen-- plus washer/dryer and dishwasher. The generous closet accommodated all our luggage and provided enough hangers and space for our stay. We were so comfortable that we could easily enjoyed this space for a month or two!"
7035498,46835634,2015-09-13,25484821,Cassi,So incredible! Best stay I've had yet at an Airbnb :) went above and beyond-- the place was perfectly clean and was right next to my favorite donut shop! Surprisingly quiet at night for being so centrally located!
7035498,47287507,2015-09-17,2649601,Kristin,"What a great place to stay in Seattle! John's studio is carefully and thoughtfully designed to give you a really comfortable, home-away-from-home experience. Though it's a studio, we never felt like space was tight. Loved the location, though I won't ever admit how many times I went next door for donuts. "
7035498,47986886,2015-09-22,20806975,Zoe,"My husband and I had a lovely few days staying at The Jewel Box. Perfectly and centrally situated on 5th Ave, it was a pleasant stroll to Pike Place Market (10 minutes). Lots to see and do in the immediate neighborhood - great restaurants, bars, and shops. Also very close to the Space Needle. 

The condo itself is in a nice, clean, and quite block. We rarely heard any of the neighbors. It felt safe and secure. The condo has everything you need - comfy bed, bathroom essentials, kitchen is fully stocked. John also had some nice touches - a welcome card, some coffee in the freezer, and some snack foods on the kitchen counter. Perfect! 

Everything was organized and spotless. The instruction binder had everything you could need for your stay in the condo, including step-by-step instructions for washer/dryer, Internet, if issues who to contact. 

We had a few questions while in Seattle. Pillow and John were very responsive and helpful. We loved Seattle, love The Jewel Box, and will be back for sure. Recommend The Jewel Box, 100%, without any reservations. Thanks John!"
7035498,49067917,2015-09-30,44905822,Philip,"I spent 2 nights at the Jewel Box, and it was exactly as advertised and exactly what I was looking for -- very nice accommodations and very conveniently located. There was even a bountiful basket of snacks and goodies and handwritten welcome note, which made it feel like coming home. You will hear some city noise even though the windows do not face the street, but that comes with being in the city and was never a problem. No complaints, I would happily stay there again."
7035498,49301272,2015-10-02,45399207,Cameron,"This space is located in a great neighborhood within walkable distance of both the Space Needle and Pike Place market (we walked to both while we stayed there).  There is a Top Pot coffee and doughnut shop right next door and other restaurants and small grocery stores within 2 blocks.  The space is arranged efficiently with all the amenities you might need.

Our reservation was accepted quickly and professionally and the entire process went very smoothly.  The place was very clean when we arrived with a very well organized and helpful guidebook along with plenty of maps and guides for out-of-towners like ourselves.

We were glad we chose this location and would recommend it to anyone else looking for a great place to stay in Seattle."
7035498,49794810,2015-10-06,22901232,Tim,"The place was great.  Seemed brand new.  Very clean.  Plenty of room.       Great location-walked to everything-such as Seahawks game, Elliott Bay on Fuget Sound to ride the ferry to Bainbridge; Pike Place Market; Chihuly Art Exhibit, etc.  John was awesome too!  We had a small issue that was mainly due to my mechanical incompetence and John handled it promptly and then followed with a very kind gesture to my wife and I.  We recommend this place highly.  Thanks John!!!!"
7035498,50892803,2015-10-15,4870479,Tim,"The rental was clean and convenient. The hosts provided coffee, snacks, and a welcome card written specifically for us.  In addition, the hosts had a binder of great info about the apartment, what to do, where to go, and what to eat. We felt comfortable the moment we settled in. The website provided simple and easy instructions for getting into the rental, checking out, and even helpful tips for parking. We had a great time in Seattle, made even better by the hospitality John showed us. 
Thanks John!"
7035498,51166120,2015-10-18,39754697,Sam,John was a great host.  There was a hand-written note for us when we arrived.  He left some snacks for us since he knew we were getting in late.  The apartment is exactly as described.  The neighborhood is perfect fore exploring downtown Seattle and Belltown.  Would definitely recommend. 
7035498,51444551,2015-10-20,1483057,Jenn,"John was an excellent host. The Jewel Box was a great, fun little space from which to easily explore Seattle on foot. Highly recommended!!

And the lite treat basket was a lovely surprise. Thanks, John. "
7035498,51723658,2015-10-24,36218310,Holly,"How happy we were to find the Jewel Box situated close to the Seattle Center and downtown shopping. It made walking pleasant and convenient. We loved our ride on the monorail from shopping to Seattle Center. Great restaurants, pastry shops, the Cinerama and a wine/cheese shop were all within a block. The apartment was in beautiful condition, clean, well-maintained and comfy.  The kitchen is well-equipped and the bathroom perfect. Truly, we wanted for nothing during our stay. Thanks, John!"
7035498,52525757,2015-10-30,2372701,Dee,"Our experience at  "" The Jewel Box"" was relaxing, amazing and fun.  The location of this property is centrally located to Seattle's ""Best"" things to do! The eateries in the area are beyond delicious. The host leaves recommendations in the manual and they are all spot on. I suggest walking and exploring the neighborhood in all directions so many places to grab tea and treats. 

My only suggestion would be bigger bath towels and a mat when stepping out of the shower as you stepping on to tile. 

The other thing was the storage of luggage. The next group doesn't come til 3:00 & that would have been perfect to catch the train for our flight. As the Westin luggage is storage is done at the front desk, not the garage as stated.

We had an excellent time in Seattle and love coming back to ""The Jewel Box"" every evening. "
7035498,52878388,2015-11-02,21021208,Bobae,I had a great time at the apartment it was nice and clean and everything was in 10 minutes walking!! So much good food and it was awesome.
7035498,54002800,2015-11-15,10352442,Samira,"The listing description was accurate. Very clean and quiet apartment. The location is close to everything, all shops and public market. The place has everything you need. We enjoyed our stay and would book again.
"
7035498,54454175,2015-11-20,1483057,Jenn,This is my second time staying at the Hip Flat and it was the perfect place from which to do my business with Microsoft. About a ten minute stroll to the office and close to easy groceries and good restaurants. The place has everything you need to be comfortable for a week or more. Highly recommend!
7035498,54987838,2015-11-27,44962201,Jessica,The Jewel Box was wonderful. GREAT location! Everything is within walking distance. The apartment was clean and cozy. John and Pillow were very attentive and made my stay easy. I'd stay there again without a second thought. 
7035498,57042032,2015-12-21,2387518,Lawrence,Nice place in a decent location.  Really clean.  The host responds quickly to emails and texts.  It was a little noisy on the weekend but it was mostly people walking around so it didn't bother me too much.
7035498,58623227,2016-01-03,14723160,Jeanine,"John's place was the perfect stay for my short trip to Seattle. It's a well cleaned, stocked, and situated little studio right in the middle of everything I wanted to do in Seattle. I was able to walk to most places, which is a big plus for me! 

John was an excellent host with great food suggestions and detailed check in and check out instructions! This unit is on the first floor so occasionally you can hear some noises from the street but between my long days of exploring Seattle and the comfy bed; I barely noticed it. Will definitely try to stay here again when back in Seattle!"
1252147,5777692,2013-07-15,7424589,Magnus,"Erin, Vince and their cute dog Tucker were absolutely fantastic! Their cozy apartment is located only a few blocks from a bus stop; it's a short easy ride to downtown Seattle, really convenient. Make sure you save a day to walk by the water in West Seattle. Alki beach is beautiful, best views of Seattle's skyline! We couldn't have stayed at a better place while visiting Seattle, Vince and Erin were great hosts, they gave us the best advice about the rest of our trip down the West Coast, from hotels, to restaurants, to car rentals. The room was big and clean and really comfortable. They made us feel like part of their family, if we ever find ourselves back in the West Coast we most definitely will contact them!"
1252147,6096386,2013-07-29,6586927,Phoebe And Al,Fantastic hosts with lots of good tips on exploring Seattle.  Bed very comfortable and house super clean.  Thanks Erin and Vince! 
1252147,6883620,2013-08-28,8048344,Ariane,We had a wonderful time at Erin & Vince! We felt home 900km away from our homes! West Seattle is a great area it takes 20 minutes to downtown Seattle and you can use bus or the water taxi from which you can see the skyline of Seattle - a must see!! They were great hosts and gave us super recommendations for our travels along the west coast! It was so cozy and very clean! We loved our stay at their house! That's how airbnb is meant to be!!! 
1252147,7442172,2013-09-20,8529383,Kathi,"Thanks Erin and Vince - and Tucker! Thoroughly enjoyed my stay - wonderful, comfortable accommodations. If I am back in the area, I will definitely book again."
1252147,7542790,2013-09-23,4121038,Jasmin,Erin and Vince were very nice hosts. They picked us up from the ferry terminal wich was really convenient. They were really helpful in telling us interesting things about Seattle and what to see. Their house is really nice and clean.
1252147,13396763,2014-05-26,2721133,Alexander,"Erin and Vince are charming hosts. The room was clean, and the bed was very comfortable. We had a great time! "
1252147,14057162,2014-06-10,16152323,Dominique,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was great! Erin and Vince are such great, nice people. Enjoyed my conversations with them and they have a lovely home, I was very comfortable. I would definitely stay with them again. West Seattle is a great area and so easy to get to downtown. 

I LOVE SEATTLE even more now! 

Thanks Again Erin and Vince!! "
1252147,14323368,2014-06-16,16579959,Ruthanna,"Erin and Vince were lovely hosts! This was my first Airbnb experience, and I have to say, it couldn't have been better. They made me feel completely at home while I was there, and even helped me plan out some fun things to do while I was there (sadly, only for a weekend).

I would definitely stay there again next time I’m in Seattle.

Thanks E&V! Oh, and Erin, BTW, I just made the Moroccan-Spiced Bean Dip from your book. Sooooooo good! I’m eating it now "
1252147,16280508,2014-07-24,3291758,Sara Grace,"My stay with Erin and Vince (and Tucker) was absolutely delightful. The space was very clean, comfortable and quiet. The location is very convenient - close to bus lines, grocery stores and other services. The kitchen was spotless (with room for me, which was really nice) and morning coffee was a treat. On top of the place, Erin and Vince were gracious and welcoming hosts; I was nervous about a room rental but was so pleasantly surprised by the mix of social time and quiet time (and look forward to staying in touch with my ""host family"").  Finally, their corgi Tucker is a hoot - he didn't make a peep during most of my comings and goings, and if you follow Erin & Vince's coaching you'll win him over and be treated to snuggles.  All in all, highly recommended!"
1252147,16579912,2014-07-29,18107434,Betsy,"Erin and Vince make the perfect hosts! My mom and I stayed with them for 3 nights and had a wonderful experience. We felt welcomed and comfortable, loved their house and suggestions of things to do, and would certainly return!"
1252147,17544333,2014-08-13,19572727,Diana,This was our first BnB experience and we couldn't have had a better one! Vince was such a wonderful host making us feel welcomed and at home very quickly. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. We had a rental car so it was easy to get into downtown Seattle for here. We stayed out of the house most days till after dinner but the time we were at the house was relaxing and just what we needed! Their dog Tucker is sweet as can be and he might do some tricks for you - if you're lucky! 
1252147,17975851,2014-08-19,10105231,Eliya,"Erin and Vince were absolutely great hosts. They are both very welcoming, funny, and easy going. They have given us advice on what and where to go, offered their kind help by driving us to the bus and have just been extremely nice. They are both very intersting people, and in my opinion that's also an important part of airbnb- getting to chat and to know, a little, the local people in the place you're off to. 

The room and the apartment in general were great: great location (single bus that goes to all the main attractions in Seattle in a 5 minutes walk), beautiful apartment, very comfortable room, 
what else could you need?

I forgot to mention Tucker, their ever so cute dog!
We would definitely recommend them for future travelers! 
Thank you for a wonderful stay in the beautiful city of Seattle
"
1252147,18138213,2014-08-22,19550986,Tess,"Erin and Vince have a beautiful home in West Seattle. Immediately on arrival Erin was warm and welcoming and totally cool. She offered us some advice on where to go and let us know that we could make us feel at home. Vince was busy most of the time we were there but when we did meet him, he was just as sweet as Erin. The bedroom was kept very neat and the bed was a really beautiful hide-away Vince had made. Their dog was staring contest champion of the world!"
1252147,18578719,2014-08-28,14506443,Dimitri,"One of our best airbnb experience!!!Erin and Vince were wonderful hosts and amazing people.
The room was bigger than on the picture, cosy and comfy. We really felt at home. The neighbourhood is quiet and we needed that after a noisy stay in San Diego :-) 

We took once the taxi boat to go to Downtown (you need to walk 5mn to a bus stup and from there there is a free shuttle bus that drives you to the taxi boat). From the same bus stop, you can directly go to downtown and it will take you more or less 20mn.
For us, travelling every day to and from downtown was not a big deal when you know what we have once we arrive ""home"".

All in all, we highly recommend this place!"
1252147,18949971,2014-09-03,7158092,Kelli,"I just can't say enough nice things about my stay with Erin & Vince! Their place is immaculate and inviting, and the location in West Seattle puts you close to a variety of shops and restaurants, Lincoln Park and the Ferry to Vashon Island. It is also a great base from which to explore the amazing variety of Seattle neighborhoods. Erin and Vince were generous and hospital, making sure my coffee needs were met each morning and my towels were spanky clean, providing local advice on my day's activities, and sharing a lovely dinner with me on one occasion (Erin is an accomplished chef, who has put out a lovely book. Ask about it!)They even kept me entertained by having their corgi, Tucker, perform a repertoire of cool tricks for me. Did I mention that Vince helped me cart my 50 -pound suitcase to and from the car and up and down the stairs? I really feel these two embody the spirit of Airbnb, sharing a part of themselves as they shared their home. I would definitely recommend this place to others. P.S. The bed is really comfy! You may need to set an alarm!"
1252147,19231795,2014-09-08,20547440,Huiying,"This is our first Airbnb experience and it couldn't be better. Erin and Vince are very welcoming hosts. They gave us great recommendations on restaurants and sight seeing places. Besides, the house was really nice: the room is clean, the living room is fantastic, and everything looks just like the photos they posted, even better! For people who travel with a car in Seattle like us, the location couldn't be better. The community is pretty and nice. It was just 15-mins drive to downtown Seattle. We can go to everywhere around Seattle easily and enjoy a home-like town in West Seattle at the same time. 
We feel warm and comfortable during our stay. It was really nice to share the valuable time with Erin and Vince. By the way, Tucker the smart puppy was superb!"
1252147,19637297,2014-09-15,12131959,Laurie,"Erin and Vince are absolutely charming hosts who have turned their spare bedroom into comfortable accommodations in super cool West Seattle.  Their hospitality and friendliness made us feel totally welcome, like honored guests in their home, and Tucker the adorable Corgi is a bonus.  They were able to give us helpful tips on restaurants and ferry schedules, and the house always smells delicious with Erin's prep for cooking classes!  We would definitely stay with Erin and Vince again."
1252147,22511284,2014-11-08,6962389,Dhiren,"Our hosts Erin and Vince were very friendly. Place was clean, tidy and good overall. Bedroom felt little small because of the computer table and two office chairs. Bed was decent for a convertible bed but squeaked little as you twist and turn. Bathroom and toilet were good. If you just need a place to crash at night this would fit the bill because you won't be able to hang around after 10am as they also use the room as an office after 10am, so just know that. "
1252147,28428949,2015-03-23,12131959,Laurie,"This was our second time staying with Erin and Vince, and we were welcomed like old friends.  Their home is lovely, clean and comfortable in every respect.  We love West Seattle, so location couldn't be better.  Highly recommended!"
1252147,33459470,2015-05-28,3510323,Hilary,"Staying with Erin & Vince in Seattle was such a wonderful experience. As soon as we walked in the door on our first day, the two treated us like old friends and were so welcoming and kind. We especially loved learning about Erin's adventures as a chef, and hanging out with their adorable corgi Tucker. During our many chats they gave a myriad of great Seattle recommendations, from restaurants to transport to activities. Their ideas enhanced our Seattle experience, particularly Erin's suggestions of gluten-free-friendly restaurants! The private bedroom we stayed in was very nice and had lovely light every morning. Also, the shower pressure in the bathroom was glorious! Erin & Vince gave us the freedom to use many of the amenities throughout the home, including the gorgeous living room (with TV, Hulu, Netflix, etc.), kitchen and outside grill (the latter of which we didn't take advantage of but should have). We loved the beautiful West Seattle neighborhood around Erin & Vince's home, and it was not too far from any place we wanted to go. It was so nice to come back to their clean, cozy home every night -- it was the perfect place to relax and wind down from the day. Upon departure, they kindly gave us a copy of Erin's fantastic cookbook, which we can't wait to use and will always remind us of our Seattle trip."
1252147,33964197,2015-06-02,16412213,Elise,"Vince and Erin are SUPER friendly, lovely people. The room we stayed in was big, airy, with a lovely comfortable bed. The house is gorgeous, beautifully decorated with a cosy, homey feel. We loved chatting to the hosts, and wished we could have stayed longer to follow all their great recommendations for Seattle. We DID follow some, and had a fantastic time. Had a delicious bacon and egg breakfast (spoilt) with vanilla coffees. An absolute treat staying with you, thank you both for having us."
1252147,34805464,2015-06-12,4015722,Lizzy,Staying here was one of my best AIRBNB experiences so far! Erin and Vince were very nice and accommodating. Erin even let us try samples of some of her gourmet food products. The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. It was also nice to stay in a quieter neighborhood with easy bus access to downtown Seattle. Would definitely stay here again! 
1252147,35244325,2015-06-16,30741380,Raymond,"Erin and Vince were simply amazing. This was our first trip to Seattle and we couldn't have asked for better hosts and place to stay. They were so hospitality from the very beginning. They helped us with directions with public transportation, recommendations on where to eat and things to do. They also have a corgi named Tucker who is a character haha.

Their home first off is very welcoming and inviting. They gave us full access to everything and made us feel comfortable. And since Erin is a chef, we got to sample some of her treats, including her tea and lavender & lemon sorbet she made (so good). The room was comfortable and spacious, and they always had fresh towels for us everyday. 

We stayed there for 4 nights and it felt like home. On our last night there we ate at their friends restaurant Marination Mai Kai (really good) and ended up watching the season finale of Game of Thrones with them. 

Erin and Vince really make you feel welcomed and feel like family. Thank you guys and Tucker for a first great AirBnB experience :)"
1252147,35513076,2015-06-19,25472310,Suzanne,"I'm an Airbnb host myself, so I can clearly see that Erin and Vince have the gift of hospitality and really enjoy hosting. I agree with all the reviewers that their home is beautiful, immaculate, and comfortable. I'd like to add that it's also very quiet. But the highlight of my stay was getting to sample what Erin had made that day -- grilled apricots topped with mascarpone cheese and almonds, drizzled with lemon verbena gastrique! And I got a singed copy of her cookbook!"
1252147,35960241,2015-06-23,35087207,Jing,"Erin and Vince are awesome, Erin is a great chef and she could not only make fantastic food on her own, she is also a very good adviser on restaurants based on your requirements. The juice she made is so tasty, and thanks so much for the English muffins you prepared for the breakfast. 
The house is very warm and clean, it gives you a home-like feeling. The neighborhood is also very nice, plus its only walking distance to different beautiful parks.  
"
1252147,36714926,2015-06-30,14484731,Joe,"The house rule of ""notify us if you'll be out after 10pm"" can be surprisingly difficult to comply with. For example, when you have a dinner event scheduled for 6:30... will you be out after 10pm? It's hard to say. And if your phone dies, well, then you just look like an inconsiderate person. And be aware that bus travel from the downtown area takes 30 minutes minimum, so if you're going to be out past 9:30, then you won't be back before 10. Unless you're in Ballard, then it'll take an hour.
Besides the stress of trying to know what time I was going to be out each evening (and the desire to be a good guest), our stay was quite pleasant. 
Erin & Vince were very hospitable and accommodating, the location is close to bus access and the neighborhood shops and restaurants.  
The bedroom is only a few feet down the hall and separated from the hosts' room by a bathroom. The house is very quiet and easy to sleep in, although you will find yourself tiptoeing back to the room if you're out past 10. And since the bathroom shares a wall with the host's bedroom, you'll probably rather sleep dirty than risk a shower that wakes the host. And the dog might bark if it hears you, so that increases the stress of being quiet at night.
If you don't plan on being out at night, this is a fantastic place to stay and I'm sure you'll enjoy the wonderful company of two obviously amazing hosts. Otherwise I don't think that the layout of the home is accommodating for people who wish to come and go after hours while not disturbing the host."
1252147,37494435,2015-07-07,35709142,Josephine,"Our hosts were very friendly and understanding. The house was absolutely immaculate, the pillows ridiculously comfortable, and there were lots of good, current magazines available for us to choose activities in the city. 
We needed a safe, soft place to sleep and a place to shower. They provided this as well as a welcoming environment. Of course, Tucker was adorable, and good company. Will look into staying here again next time I'm in (website hidden) - West Seattle is so very friendly and clean, with plenty to do and see, without the grime and grit you find in downtown Seattle. (Not that I mind getting a little dirty to have a good time!) "
1252147,38175713,2015-07-13,36529595,Christine,Erin & Vince were great hosts and the room was super comfortable. It was easy to come and go from their place and make it downtown by bus in 20 minutes. It was also great to explore the neighborhood of West Seattle and Alki Beach.
1252147,38438769,2015-07-15,18953054,Janie,"Great location!  It was our first time using AirBNB and it really couldn't have been better.  My husband and I were a little hesitant, mostly afraid of being a bother.  Erin and Vince went out of their way to put us at ease. Their home is very nice, very clean, and the location really couldn't have been better for access to Seattle.  We took Erin's suggestions for both the water taxi and a tour of Seattle's underground, and both were terrific!  I really enjoyed chatting with our hosts a few times and think Erin and I would be good friends of we lived on the same neighborhood.  I can highly recommend staying at their home. Thank you, both, for your hospitality and thoughtfulness.  The breakfasts were such a help, too, and I appreciate your efforts to provide what worked for us, specifically.  It was wonderful meeting you, and should we come that way again we'd love to stay at your place."
1252147,39116957,2015-07-20,12437323,Olivia,"Erin and Vince are a lovely and welcoming couple. Very comfortable place to stay, I slept amazingly. Nice to stay out of the chaos of the city but a bus, ferry, or taxi ride from Alki beach or downtown. Erin and Vince were around when I arrived and when I left to make me welcome, show me around, and for interesting chats."
1252147,40277455,2015-07-29,410348,Amanda,"Erin and Vince were kind hosts - Erin even picked us up upon our arrival in West Seattle (which was above and beyond because it was earlier than our original check-in time).  Their home is incredibly clean and the kitchen was a great space to prepare our breakfasts each morning.  The guest bedroom is quite cute and the mattress is incredibly comfy.  Erin and Vince communicated clearly before and during our stay.  Although the bathroom is shared, they would let us know when they needed the bathroom each morning so we could make plans accordingly.  My husband and I are pretty communal people, so sharing the kitchen and in-kitchen dining area worked well for us, but may not be ""ideal"" for those wanting more privacy.  

Erin was quite gracious - picking up English muffins, peanut butter and bananas for our breakfast, sharing her tomato appetizer with us, and making fresh coffee each morning.  She also gave us fresh towels daily and had several maps of the area for us to use. 

The bus stop is about a 10 minute walk from their home and the ride itself takes about 20 minutes (into downtown Seattle).  

Erin even cleaned our breakfast dishes one morning as she hadn't emptied the dishwasher yet.  Again, she goes above and beyond!

We had a lovely time exploring Seattle and it was so nice to have a warm, comfortable place to and each evening!  I would recommend staying with them if you have an opportunity.  "
1252147,40849774,2015-08-02,19970957,Patty,"Room was very nice, very clean space.  Hosts were awesome, had a great time in Seattle!"
1252147,42279355,2015-08-12,17785775,Antonia,"We had a great time in Seattle with Erin and Vince who made us feel at home in their super clean house! The room was very cozy and comfortable! To share the bathroom with them was so easy and never a problem. Tucker, the dog, was well behaved and trained. Seattle was easy to reach by puplic transportation. 
We had a wonderfull stay, friendly chats and a fun eveining with Erin and Vince and I would defintely recommend their home and would love to stay there again! We met  some terrific people in Seattle! Thank you!
"
1252147,46936256,2015-09-14,23384161,Ashley,"Erin and Vince were incredibly kind and generous. They easily make you feel at home in their beautiful space. I had a short, but enjoyable stay and would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a comfortable place in West Seattle. "
3582883,16377499,2014-07-26,10132034,Ramani,"Julian and his family couldn't have been nicer.  They even lent me an umbrella when it rained unexpectedly on my first day in Seattle.  The photos of their space are accurate--it's simple, neat, and tidy with a full closet and bureau to hold your things, a desk and chair, and your own bath.  Transportation into town couldn't be more convenient--light rail is just a short walk away.  No unpleasant surprises; the listing is exactly as it shown and described."
3582883,16511785,2014-07-28,18269729,Kathleen,"Very nice, clean room. Helpful hosts, but they'll admit a bit of a language barrier. Close to downtown, about a 10 minute drive, which is very convenient, and affordable price. "
3582883,16592147,2014-07-29,3362828,Meghan,One block from the Columbia city Light rail station. Comfortable room and met all needs! Would stay again.
3582883,16687798,2014-07-31,13378837,Trent,"Julians place was very nice! The bed was extremely comfortable and his family was very welcoming and nice. The house itself was extremely clean and well maintained. The neighborhood wasn't amazing, but the inside of the house made up for that."
3582883,16743558,2014-08-01,17288817,Jasmine,Julian and his wife Jasmine were excellent hosts! The home felt very safe and comfortable. It was one of the cleanest rooms I've ever stayed at! Their family was very sweet. Bonus for the super easy access to the Link light rail--only a block away!
3582883,16815461,2014-08-02,9862218,Alan,"Jullian  is a excellent host. Room was perfect for the two of us, with a big comfy bed. Would definitely recommend a stay with Jullian. The city is at your calling being so close to the rail. "
3582883,17604254,2014-08-14,14136215,Lexis,"This is a good place to stay if you need a place to crash for a night or two when you're visiting Seattle.  The location is good because you're a few steps from the light rail.  There is a private bedroom with a clean bed with sheets, towels and bathroom-but not much else."
3582883,17785904,2014-08-17,6097415,Pete,Very clean place and VERY close to the Link Light Rail.  Super easy to get to downtown Seattle.
3582883,18030014,2014-08-20,5248437,Paul,"Stayed here for 3 nights this past week. Julian and his wife are the nicest and were very accommodating. Even though the check-in time was listed as 3:00pm, they were okay with us checking in at around 12:30. They speak mandarin but do speak some English (especially Julian). We didn't have too much trouble communicating. You get a key for the front door and a key to lock your bedroom (huge plus).

They keep their place very clean. Sheets were spotless and mattress was on the firmer side, which we did not mind. Towels that were provided were very clean and sparkling WHITE. (If there's one thing I'm more anal about it'd be clean towels.) They had shampoo and conditioner in the bathroom but we brought all of that with us anyway. One thing I wish they had was liquid hand soap. I'm sure they would've done their best to provide that if we asked. Shower was plenty hot and had good water pressure.

Julian's wife also brought a big bag of bottled water to to room which saved us a trip to the local drug store or market.

We didn't have trouble getting around because we had a rental car, but it looks like public transportation is easy to access from the house. Driving to downtown was a snap. It only takes about 15-20 mins to get to downtown, which is where most of the attractions are.

All in all, we were very satisfied and would definitely stay here again. Can't beat their reasonable rates also!"
3582883,18159351,2014-08-22,20315836,Rose,Julian and his wife were amazing hosts. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay in your lovely home and for a warm welcome. I will most definitely share this beautiful space to my friends and family when they visit Seattle. 
3582883,18214114,2014-08-23,19845286,John,Julians place was very nice! The bed was extremely comfortable. The house was very clean and well maintained. It was the perfect place to spend the night. Close to downtown.
3582883,18432017,2014-08-26,4277167,Kate,"Julian and his wife Jasmine were sweet and welcoming. The room was exactly as advertised, and they had bottled water and towels for us to use and keys both to the front door and the door to our room. My sister and I stayed here for a weekend visiting Seattle and Julian always had good suggestions for what to do every day. The transit line, the Link, literally could not be closer to their house. It was a lovely weekend in Seattle and I'm so glad we went with Julian's place rather than staying in a hostel"
3582883,18596732,2014-08-28,20362321,Lisa,"Julian and his wife Jasmine were great hosts.  My son and I stayed in their home while looking for housing for school so were weren't there much but when we were it was just what we needed.  Very quite, clean and the bed was very comfortable.  ESPECIALLY the pillow.  I am a stickler for pillow comfort when I stay in hotels and am usually VERY unsatisfied so when I say that this is a plus I MEAN IT!!!!  ;-) "
3582883,18676148,2014-08-30,19579579,Raina,Julian and his wife were very sweet and welcoming. The room was just what my boyfriend and I needed during our crazy northwest adventure. Tucked away in cute Colombia City right by the light rail made this an accessible and pleasant place to stay just a few short stops away from the hustle and bustle of the downtown. I highly recommend going to the Vietnamese restaurant/bar/billiards place that's walking distance from Julian's.  
3582883,18746509,2014-08-31,136061,Alison,"Julian was very easy to communicate with, and very accommodating of our late arrival after a Mariners game. The LINK train is a two minute walk and such an effortless way to get into town. We only spent one night, but the room and bathroom were immaculate. The neighbors were noisy, and a fan would go a long way in covering the noise/keeping the room cool.  The neighborhood seems a little rough around the edges, but we felt fine walking to and from the train, and leaving our car parked on the street.   This is the perfect place to stay if you're looking for a crash pad for lots of Seattle exploring without spending a ton on lodging. "
3582883,18948753,2014-09-03,17838727,David,"We stayed with the Lius from August 30 to Sept 2, 2014. The room was simple but very clean, and the Lius were most welcoming. For example, we had lots of camping equipment in our car, and Julian offered to park on the street so I could back my car into his driveway. They let us do laundry, make breakfast in the kitchen, and were generally helpful. They try hard to please.

The neighborhood is not fancy, but did not feel at all dangerous. And they are not kidding when they say that the light rail to downtown and the airport is practically outside the front door; it was a 2 minute walk at most; definitely a good location for people who don't want to drive in to town or rent a car at the airport. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the occasional distant sounds of the light rail line, and (not very loud) strains of Chinese music coming from next door. "
3582883,19045487,2014-09-05,20318030,Jami,"房東夫婦很熱情友善，地點很好，離Link超近，不論是到市區或機場都20分鐘會到,很方便，沿Alask St往東也可以走到很美的華盛頓湖，房間乾淨價格合理。"
3582883,19420012,2014-09-12,19739359,Annika,"I didn't talk much with Julian and his family too much (due to my shyness), but they were very accommodating of my schedule and seemed like genuinely nice people.

The house is in a very good location. It is very near Sound Transit's Central Link, and I was able to rely on the light rail exclusively for my travel.

The room is clean and well appointed, and appears as shown in the photos. The bed was very comfortable."
3582883,19567929,2014-09-14,19038818,Aleks,"Clean and comfortable room. Friendly and welcoming host, and gave directions so it was easy to arrive. Less than a minute's walk to the Light Rail station, and the journey to downtown was not long. Thoroughly recommended :)"
3582883,20203456,2014-09-25,14722480,Florian,welcoming host. apartment well connected to go to the airport and the city center 20 mn. clean room but noisy morning. 
3582883,20450069,2014-09-29,13649301,Selena,"The Lius greeted me and my friend upon arrival.  Julian's wife insisted on helping me with my luggage up the stairs, which I really appreciated.  The room is very clean and the bed comfortable.  The location is convenient, as it is easy to access the I-5 to go downtown.  I would recommend staying here. 
"
3582883,20774040,2014-10-05,11879735,Patricia,Julian allowed me to check-in early and leave my luggage so I could spend the rest of the day sightseeing. The room is as described in the listing. If you are looking to travel by public transportation this is the place to stay. Light-rail and bus stops are located within a few steps. Also within about 0.5 mile there are several great restaurants and a bakery on Rainier Street in Columbia City. Tutta Bella had one of the best pizza's I have ever eaten. Thanks for a great time.
3582883,20981569,2014-10-08,18773606,Qihua,"房间很干净,被铺超舒服，邻近公共交通进入市区逛街方便。"
3582883,21291378,2014-10-14,20198445,Yuqiu,Hosts are nice. The house is very clean and friendly. Location is perfect. 
3582883,22401413,2014-11-05,21837546,Sarah,We had a great stay! Our flight got in late and Julian met us at the Link and walked us back to his house. That was really nice and much appreciated. The room was clean and as described. 
3582883,22639126,2014-11-10,23463189,James,"Julian is a wonderful host! My friend and I requested this room very last minute and Julian graciously accepted our request. When we arrived in Seattle we didn't have a way of getting to his house so he offered to pick us up. Once he picked us up, he gave us an awesome tour of the city--that was very thoughtful of him because this was my first time in Seattle. His home is very clean and tidy and is also extremely close to public transit. I highly recommend staying at Julian's!"
3582883,22726317,2014-11-12,23508312,Zoe,"非常好的住宿選擇，離""LINK""極近，到市區或機場都非常方便。Julian 和Jasmine都非常親切，到車站接我們，我們聊得非常愉快。床很舒適乾淨，提供瓶裝水，浴巾等，衛浴也很方便，可使用Wi-Fi。"
3582883,23908237,2014-12-14,21424768,Wei,"Julian的房子很方便，很干净，可以做我暂时的家。他们对我出行提供了很多的建议，很有用。由于我行李多还送我去火车站，真的很感谢。下次有机会去西雅图还会去住的。
"
3582883,24329230,2014-12-26,18127773,Hao,"The host was extremely friendly. Julian picked us up in the train station and walked us back to his home. He also recommended many attractions and food for us. On the last day of our visit, he gave us late check out because our flight was late at night.

The public transport around his house was super convenient. We could take train directly to downtown without any transfer."
3582883,24762045,2015-01-02,23751804,Jiamin,"I have such a great time stay in Julian's house. 
The bed is big and the room is nice. We have the whole closet to use. The bathroom is nice too. Julian and his husband is so helpful. They recommend the places of seattle for us to visit. So helpful for our plan of trip. The location is so nice. It's like 2 min walk to bus stop and link stop. 
I recommend this place."
3582883,25362349,2015-01-13,25077285,Citra,"Julian and his wife, Jasmine, were both really friendly, welcoming and helpful. Julian knows the city well and gave us a lot of ideas on places to go in the Seattle. The listing description is accurate. Our room and bathroom was clean and really comfortable. Julian also provided us with basic necessities for shower (clean towels, shampoo, soap, etc) and bottled water for drinks. The neighborhood was also great; quiet and safe. The one thing I find most convenient is the commute. The Link train station is literally less than a minute away walking distance from Julian's place. Overall, we had a great experience and a pleasant stay."
3582883,26610952,2015-02-16,979986,Jenny,"Julian was great - he met me, gave me the key, and oriented me to the place. The room was clean and the bed quite comfortable. The location is great - between downtown and the airport. It has a cute business district and is really close to the light rail to get you to other places. "
3582883,26968340,2015-02-22,25446373,Talal,"Friendly host.. the room is very clean. The bed is very comfortable. 
The place is a bit of a distance from restaurants and after 8 it was hard for me to find something to eat since I arrived late. However the train station is few minutes away. If you will come in late bring some food just in case.

Julian also invited me tye next day for dinner which was super nice of them. Very lovely couple."
3582883,28046472,2015-03-16,27868120,Yanqing,很开心入住刘叔叔家，步行2分钟便有Link和Bus，无论到airport还是Downtown都很方便，最后临走时刘叔还起早送我到车站，还准备水饺，饼干和泡面，特别感谢！有机会还会入住！
3582883,28227488,2015-03-20,6104207,Ben,"Our bed was clean and comfy, and Julian was thoughtful in providing fresh towels and water in our room. Quite conveniently located! Close to the Link light rail, but not noisy at all."

I will definitely choose them again if I have another chance to Seattle.
It was so glad to stay with them and the room was quite and clean. Therefore the position is awesome. It only takes u 1min to walk to rail station where u can take rail to airport or downtown:)

"
3582883,28802197,2015-03-30,2648126,John,"The room was very tidy, and the bathroom was in good shape--though the shower curtain could be replaced. The house is extremely close to the Link (so close you can hear the train signals, in fact). A quick ride to downtown and the airport."
3582883,29100726,2015-04-04,27247806,汪洋,julian夫妇使我们感到非常快乐和温馨，像家人一样。在到达的前一天他们就联系我们并再次详细的描述地址，使我们很快就找到了。他们的家在樱花丛中，漂亮，干净，舒适，房间，厨房和卫生间设备齐全。房子离轻轨站非常近，对旅游者来说是非常方便的。每天晚上我们一起聊天，相互学习到很多。我们喜欢他们并且成为好朋友。
3582883,29876980,2015-04-13,30446347,Jayme-Jo,Perfect airbnb experience. Very clean and welcoming. Extremely easy to get to downtown Seattle. I also enjoyed Columbia city and recommend going to Seward park if you want a nice walk/jog. 
3582883,30951338,2015-04-29,17256588,Patrick,"What a great place to stay! The communication with Julian was very easy. He gave us loads of information in advance of our arrival. Everything was perfectly prepared for us. The bedroom and bathroom were sparkling clean. The location is quite centrally located and the LINK (metro) assure a good access to downtown. The Columbia City Station is just a 2 minutes walk from the flat. Furthermore there are plenty of delicious restaurants in the area. To sum up, it was a great experience and I highly recommend this place.
Thank you Julian & Family"
3582883,31246926,2015-05-03,31749648,Melissa,"I never met the homeowners, only his wife when we were leaving. The room is exactly how it looks in the picture. Getting a separate key to the home and room was a plus. The bed was comfy, towels and a separate bathroom was available. The neighbourhood seems like an older area, its right off a main road so it wasn't too bad."
3582883,31397468,2015-05-04,32003567,Ryan,Overall we had a nice experience on our one night stay. Our hosts were not home during our stay but the room was small but clean and we're provided towels and bottled water.
3582883,32548654,2015-05-19,15697269,Spencer,"Julian was a great host who really cared about giving us an easy experience.  He picked us up from the light rail station when we first got in, and gave us a few tips on where to explore in the city.  The place itself was clean and well-kept, with a private bathroom and a nice bedroom.  The light rail was easy to use, and took about 20 minutes to get to downtown.  I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle."
3582883,32866230,2015-05-22,33441450,Sidney,"The listing was exactly as described. Clean, efficient, very easy to get to from the airport.

3582883,33345083,2015-05-26,1816365,Husain,Julian and his wife were fantastic hosts. They gave me clear instructions on getting into the place and were super nice.

3582883,33815606,2015-06-01,13716424,Mariana,"Julian's house was very well located. It was very easy to access downtown Seattle. Because I was at a conference I had to leave very early and came back late, so I only met once with Julian. Unfortunately, we had a misunderstanding about the lock for the main door and the use of the towels, but we were able to talk and work it out. "
3582883,33925677,2015-06-02,28968115,Vicky,"I had a great time in Julian's place. Both he and his wife are super friendly, making me feel like home. The location is really near Link station as described, and the room is clean and comfortable. Julian cooked breakfast for me and drove me to Lake Washington since I travelled alone. Overall a pleasant experience! I definitely will stay here again!
我在刘叔叔的家里度过了愉快的一天。叔叔阿姨给我介绍了西雅图好玩的地方，而且因为我自己旅行，还开车带我去华盛顿湖边欣赏湖景。阿姨把房间打扫得特别的干净，家里也很温馨。下次再来西雅图我一定还会住在他们家:)"

Our room was clean with a comfortable bed. We had had some bottles of water. WIFI worked well. The bathroom was clean too. Really a good place to come few days visiting Seattle. It was just perfect, no doubt.

Julian and his wife were very friendly and accommodating during our stay - always there to answer questions or chime in with suggestions, but only if need be and not too overbearing.  The room was exactly as expected and the proximity to public transit and some great nearby food was wonderful to boot.  Fantastic host and I would definitely stay again."

3582883,38855235,2015-07-19,34533552,Owen,Nice home in a great location next to many bus stops and the LINK station. We particularly enjoyed the neighborhood and local shops next door where we spent most of our mornings. My girlfriend and I were out around the city most of the days so we unfortunately didn't have the chance to talk with Julian too much. Julian and his wife made great hosts though by accommodating our check in though and making sure we found everything we needed during our stay.
3582883,39189114,2015-07-21,30167544,Adriana,"Julian fue muy amable y atento, colaborador y explicó muy detalladamente las indicaciones para llegar a su casa. El lugar muy limpio y muy bien ubicado.
Quiza lo único que observaría es que es caluroso y sugeriría un ventilador"
3582883,39309714,2015-07-22,33850290,Thomas,Clean Place to stay - Good Public Transportation around
3582883,39393379,2015-07-23,33054329,Kristina & Boy,Julian is a very polite host and showed us around when we arrived. We stayed at his place only for a night and didn't get a chance to walk around the neighboorhood. 
3582883,39530122,2015-07-24,34616512,Kara,"Very clean and quiet stay, close to the Columbia city station and very accessible to downtown. The hosts were nice enough to let us leave our luggage with them after we checked out and before our flight later that night, which we greatly appreciated."
3582883,39941835,2015-07-27,4134454,Jasmyne,"Julian and his wife welcomed us as soon as we arrived. We had arrived a bit early but they allowed us to check in and put our bags to the room and head into town. They were very helpful with directions and giving us the inside scoop. The room was perfect, super clean and they even left us water bottles each day. Location was ideal as we were literally a 3 min walk to the train to either the airport or downtown.  Thanks Julian, look forward to our next visit!"
3582883,40227444,2015-07-29,8755096,Perrine,"This really has to be the easiest commute in town as Julian's house is situated about halfway between the airport and downtown. Besides it's so close to the Columbia City link station that it's really no problem if you are wheeling big bags.
The room itself is on the first floor of the house along with 4 others and 2 shared bathrooms. I'm not a big fan of sharing a bathroom but it was never an issue here as I was always able to access one when I needed to. 
The room isn't particularly big but it's bright and very neat making it feel spacious enough. You've got a big comfy bed to sleep in, a desk, a chest of drawers and a big wardrobe. And Julian provides you with plenty of bottled water.
All in all, I would definitely stay at Julian's again if I ever were in Seattle again."
3582883,40398485,2015-07-30,1989488,Nikole,"My stay was pleasant and peaceful. I felt very comfortable at their home and was very quiet. Extremely nice hosts and explain everything very clearly. Several bathrooms to be used, clean comfortable bed and very accommodating on the time for check in. Location was a bit tricky to find but once there it's a nice little place, very spacious. "
3582883,40781494,2015-08-02,23789792,Grace,"房东夫妇很热情，我们是晚上10点30左右到轻轨站的，房东特地到轻轨站接站，并告诉我们出去游玩的交通及推荐了景点。
房东太太还开车陪我们去COSTCO购物。
房间很干净，也很安静。
厨房的冰箱很大，可以存放食品。厨房可供使用，我们自己煮东西吃。真是很方便。
下次出游还选这家，并且会向朋友推荐。"
3582883,41207994,2015-08-05,30962110,Claire,"Room was a good size, clean and very well located. Close to the train station that takes you into town. Julian was friendly, helpful and very accommodating. Would definitely stay there again. "
3582883,41743194,2015-08-09,28094303,Timothy,"Comfortable and convenient stay with Julian. The hosts were very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and bed was very comfy. Although we had to share the bathroom, there was never a problem with not having one available for us. The location was great. The Link was very close. Would definitely stay here again."
3582883,42714304,2015-08-15,38131453,Angela,"Our hosts were very gracious and gave good directions that were easy to follow, with great access to public transportation.  The neighborhood seems like it's diverse and improving in safety from reviews 5 years ago when doing an internet search on safe neighborhoods in Seattle.  We felt very comfortable walking to their house from the station nearby.  The rooms were very clean, and bottled water was included for our convenience.  It was a very positive experience and a quiet place to relax when returning from touring the city.  "
3582883,43315002,2015-08-18,15925566,Gavin,"My wife and I stayed here for two days and had a great experience. The house is very clean and tidy. Julian and his wife are very nice and helpful. We wanted to buy something when we arrived the first day, and they helped us find the supermarket in the night. I highly recommend to stay here."
3582883,43696367,2015-08-21,40994477,Shannon,"Julian and Jasmine were the perfect hosts.  They communicated well in advance of our stay. Our plane arrived late and Julian stayed up to direct us to his home and welcome us to the house.  The bedroom and bathroom were clean and the bed was super comfortable with premier bedding.  Their home is right next to mass transit right into Seattle but we had a car.  Even with a car, the drive was easy and fast.  The room was great but the best part about airbnb is meeting amazing people like Julian and Jasmine!  "
3582883,44799551,2015-08-29,28705464,Shih-Wen,"Julian and Jasmine are good host, they are kind, friendly and helpful :) Their place is clear and very convenient, that is definitely a place I will recommend people who travel first time in Seattle!!!! Nice experience there :)"
3582883,45071043,2015-08-31,34147402,Geoff,"We had a lovely stay at Julian's place. The room was clean and spacious with plenty of storage and just as described in the listing. The bed was large and comfortable. Julian's wife was there to make us welcome on our arrival, and Julian was there most of the time during our stay. They both made us feel at home. Also very prompt to respond to our emails. For us a big plus was it's so easy to get to Julian's place by light rail from Seatac airport or to and from downtown. I would recommend this place to anyone. Thanks Julian!"
3582883,45375954,2015-09-02,15858754,Eric,Nice clean room with a very comfy bed. About a 2 minute walk from the Link which takes you downtown and to the airport cheaply and on time. Quick communication with Julian made arrival easy even when we were unsure of when we would be there. Overall it was a very nice stay and would definitely love to stay here again.
3582883,45780155,2015-09-06,22137470,Robert,"The owner was very friendly. We arrived late and he picked us up from the train station so we wouldn't have trouble finding the house. The house is about 2 minutes from the train station, which is very convenient. The room was exactly as shown on the picture. There were free water bottles and a second blanket in the closet. Outside the room were two shared full bathrooms that were clean and had shampoo, conditioner and body wash. We went to an organic supermarket that was open till 11pm and within walking distance (about 10 minutes). Overall, very convenient location and perfect to stay on the way from or to the airport."
3582883,47660289,2015-09-21,38138954,Teresa,This was my first air Bnb experience and I was very pleased with it. Super clean and comfortable! 
3582883,48009628,2015-09-22,42738043,Kimberly,"Julian and Jasmine were GREAT hosts! This was mine and my boyfriend's first time using AirBnB and we had a great first experience thanks to Julian and Jasmine's hospitality. We arrived a day late but kept in contact and Julian was very welcoming nonetheless. The room (A) we stayed in was very clean with fresh bedding... And the bathroom was even stocked with shampoo, conditioner, and soap for the guests. The location was literally a minute walk to the link, which Julian suggested we used to get to Pike's and the Space Needle. WAY better than driving and dealing with traffic, and we would have never known if it wasn't for his friendly advice. If I'm ever back in Seattle, I'll be making another reservation here. Thanks for everything! "
3582883,48208022,2015-09-24,33875546,Shihya,"Great location-very close to Link station, easy to go to downtown. You can easily come back home to take a rest and go out again. There is also a supermarket and some restaurants nearby. I spent 2 nights there and will also come back to Julian's house after my trip to Vancouver."
3582883,48898777,2015-09-29,39193143,Yakun,"Julian couple are very kind, they even pick us up to their  house from link station. The room is so cozy and clean, I think  I am fall in love with the bed. The location is very convenient, you can take the Link to everywhere in Seattle.叔叔阿姨都特别好，以后有机会来西雅图还要住这里，太喜欢他们的房子了。"
3582883,49635610,2015-10-05,42622148,Jordan,"Bedroom and bathroom was extremely comfortable and clean. The access to the Link was super easy, which was wonderful for a woman travelling alone. My only problem was with the ants-- they were in the bathroom and bedroom, and I woke up with new bites every night. But those perhaps were seasonal, and Julian mentioned that he would do something about them once I left. Would consider staying here again!"
3582883,50322550,2015-10-11,10423777,Andrea,The room is perfectly clean and Julian came to LINK station to pick us up which is very considerate and kind. The whole house is quite and is very close to the LINK station which will save a lot of time. Great experience!
3582883,51140387,2015-10-18,33875546,Shihya,"This is our second stay. Julian's house is so nice and got great location in Seattle. I highly recommend it :) 

PS.  So sorry for not giving my arrival time in advance."
3582883,51420493,2015-10-19,28376719,Tuesday,We booked only an hour and a half before we arrived in Seattle. Julian gave us directions to his place on the way and responded promptly. He had complimentary bottles of water on the upstairs landing where 4 rooms and 2 bathrooms are. We had neighbors but didn't hear them until morning when the house was waking. Plus: free wi-fi!

3582883,52970578,2015-11-03,43446921,Kerstin,"Julian war ein freundlicher und hilfsbereiter Gastgeber, der uns gute Tips für unseren Aufenthalt in Seattle gab. Sein Haus liegt sehr günstig in unmittelbarer Nähe einer Link Rail Station. Das Zimmer war sauber und ausreichend groß. Die anderen Gäste des Hauses bekamen wir kaum zu sehen und nur selten zu hören. Im Flur stand kostenlos Trinkwasser bereit. Wir bedanken uns für den angenehmen Aufenthalt."
3582883,53516447,2015-11-09,9823968,Lin,房主夫妇是热情和周到人，给予周到的服务。甚至带我驱车到西雅图海湾。对我的个人计划也是百问不厌，权力解答。房屋所处的位置无论起机场还是市区搜非常方便。房间干净舒适。如果你选择此处作为西雅图之行的小住之地，一定不会后悔你的选择。再次去西雅图，我就不会费心再找其他地方了，真好。
3582883,54774732,2015-11-23,48600407,Victoria,"The place is right next to the lightrail giving easy access to downtown, and there's a new PCC within 5 minutes walking distance.  The room and bathroom was clean and Julian is nice and helpful!"
3582883,56960847,2015-12-20,50036967,XuanEr,"Thank you for being great hosts! The room was clean and well prepared before our arrival. The location is really accessible to the LINK, which gets you downtown in 15mins. Had a really pleasant stay. Thanks again!"
9939359,57085516,2015-12-21,3672967,Joshua,Corey was very nice and helpful. The check in went smoothly and the place was clean. Definitely not fancy but the building had a quirky charm and at $80 was a good deal for a perfect location. 
9939359,57613549,2015-12-27,42542829,Brandon,Corey was great! Very responsive over text and easy to get a hold of. The apartment had a lot of personality and was very clean. The location was amazing. Very close to many great bars and places to eat.

10695,541589,2011-09-18,710344,Elizabeth,"The two rooms and bathroom were a great place to land in Seattle.  We stayed here 2 of 4 nights, spending the last 2 nights downstairs in Joey's mother in law unit.  The two bedrooms were comfortable and outfitted with a desk, tv,  small fridge, microwave and dishes.  The bedroom we stayed in also had a sink and mirror, which was great for getting ready for bed or for the day. The bathroom was very big and the space worked well for us overall.

Thanks Joey!"
10695,4237296,2013-04-21,5709313,Sierra,This was an awesome place to stay! Jess and Joey were very welcoming. They let us do our thing but were always there when we had questions or needed anything. We had a great time!
10695,5602174,2013-07-08,4859681,Qian,Excellent location with the awesome hosts! Beautiful and tidy place to welcome the guests:) thanks for everything Jess! :D
10695,5850432,2013-07-19,3481308,Svetlozar,"Great house at a great location. Very clean, spacious rooms, private bath - excellent experience! Thank you very much Jess and Joey for contributing to a terrific time in Seattle and will be happy to return one day ..."
10695,5969525,2013-07-24,6574882,Jessy,"This was my first time using AirBnB and the experience couldn't have gone smoother.  Jess and Joey were always just an email away up to and during our stay.  Luckily, there was little communication needed because everything leading up to our arrival was discussed ahead of time and very clear, and once we were settled there was nothing they hadn't already thought of.  If I am ever in need of a place to stay in Seattle, Jess and Joey will certainly be the first place I look!"
10695,7123994,2013-09-07,8190326,Lucille,"Lovely place! We accidentally checked into the apartment downstairs instead of the two bedrooms upstairs but Jessica gave us a call and was super understanding and accommodating. The rooms are adorable, amenities are great, and our stay was extremely comfortable. Would stay here again for another visit to Seattle! We had a rental car which also made getting around very easy--plenty of street parking. "
10695,8182429,2013-10-19,3820831,Carman,It's very nice for stay! we would love to live again! :)
10695,15337728,2014-07-07,16531456,Christopher,The place was great!  The neighborhood was quite and we had no lack of privacy.
10695,17053233,2014-08-06,16534603,Aaron,"The whole experience of staying in Jess and Joey place was excellent.  It was what we expected and things went as planned.  It was clean and quiet and we enjoyed the neighborhood.  We felt comfortable and safe there.  Easy to get to everything we wanted to do and we did a lot while we were there.  Out everyday and then sometimes back for a nice nap before out again.  Great place for the kids 6 and 9.  Highly recommended!  Thank you Jess and Joey.  Marc,Taryn, Siena, and Max.  "
10695,23434875,2014-12-01,22203385,Barbara," Excellent location for our needs. The rooms were clean and comfortable and the bathroom was large and the shower adequate. Only one bedroom has a microwave and a sink, but hot water on demand is available downstairs. If you are sensitive to smells or have allergies to scented candles and potpourri, staying here may present a problem. Check with the host."
10695,45769385,2015-09-06,28102263,Chadanuch,Jess is a very nice host and the place makes us feel like home.  It is so much convenient to go to Northgate Mall or to buy grocery at Safeway. We would highly recommend this place to everyone. 
7274556,38791156,2015-07-18,38361101,Bobby,"Ourania is an excellent host.  Her place has an open, clean, and  beautiful feel.  The location is fantastic - well within walking distance of the university, with places to get food close by.  Her place felt safe, and comfortable, with classic charm.   The room for rent is cozy, so don't expect to fit a whole family there.  But it was certainly accommodating enough for me. I would definitely stay there again! "
7274556,40001841,2015-07-27,424392,Lucia,"Ourania's home is very charming and comfortable. Although I was there for work and couldn't enjoy the staying so much, I had very good time in the morning sipping a great coffee and viewing the outdoor's activities in the back yard, from squirrels to birds to Ourania""s two cats. The room is lovely and everything is oretty neat and clean. The upstairs hardwood floors play a fun part during the night.
A beautiful place in Seattle that I recommend!"
7274556,40807678,2015-08-02,38302610,Cesar,"Ourania was an amazing host: friendly, helpful and thoughtful. I'd just moved to Seattle and she was great at helping me get settled in, giving me information about the restaurants, things to do in Seattle, and how to get and move in the University. The room is exactly what she describes, and the location is just great, you can walk to the University. Also the U-Village is really close with nice restaurants and stores. I totally recommend staying with her."
7274556,43966541,2015-08-23,5080621,Izzy,"Ourania is such an amazing host! I stayed there for 3 days to visit UW, and the location was great to go to UW (its about 25 mins walking, 15-20mins bus). Every room is super clean and elegantly decorated. The room is small but enough size for one person. The bed is single size and very comfortable to sleep (not too soft or too hard). The shower is easy to use and very good quality. The neighborhood is quiet and safe, and there are some restaurants around the place so its very convenient too. Ourania provided water and coffee every day. She has a binder for Airbnb guests that we can get many information about UW or Seattle. She is really nice and comfortable to talk to too! There are two adorable cats in the house. Overall Ourania and her house is amazing and I definitely recommend anyone stay there. I would love to stay there again!! "
7274556,45823337,2015-09-06,40793538,Brian,"All of the other extremely positive reviews on this page are indeed accurate, so I simply need to reaffirm what everyone else has said.  I had a thoroughly enjoyable stay in a beautiful house and with a wonderful host -- this room comes highly recommended!"
7274556,47865017,2015-09-21,44031785,Sriram,This was my first stay using airbnb and I was pleasantly surprised. Ourania's awesome! She is very friendly and professional. I got everything I needed during my stay including wireless access and coffee in the morning! 
7274556,48530710,2015-09-27,40521906,Matthew,"The room was clean, comfortable and well appointed.

7274556,50331325,2015-10-11,9361270,Elizabeth,"Ourania was a delightful hostess.  She was very friendly and helpful.  She has put together a notebook with things to do in Seattle and ways to get around.  Her lovely home, which she has recently done an excellent job of restoring, is located in a pleasant residential neighborhood within walking distance of the University.  Public transportation to reach many areas in Seattle is very accessible.  I definitely enjoyed my stay."

Ourania is very kind.
My English skill is not good,but I enjoyed talking with her,because she spoke clearly.
Her house is very clean and comfortable.
I want to stay there again."

7533901,49116140,2015-10-01,40686386,Chelsea,"I really enjoyed my time in downtown Seattle - largely due to staying here! The location was AMAZING - I was able to walk everywhere. I was less than 5 minutes from the convention center (where I was attending a conference), there were several restaurants and bars within just a few blocks, and then the Pike Fish Market was about 10 minutes away. Marc was absolutely fantastic to work with throughout the entire process! I had never been to Seattle or used Airbnb before, so I had several questions before and after booking. Marc was incredibly responsive and always answered within an hour, and most times it was within a few minutes. He was there to welcome me and show me around the apartment and building when handing over the keys, and was readily available to answer the few questions I had after arrival. The apartment was clean and comfortable, and perfect for my weeklong stay - there was a great living space complete with a kitchen and laundry, a very comfortable king bed in the bedroom, and views from rooftop patios were amazing! I would definitely stay again!  "
7533901,52682346,2015-11-01,40959276,Jenny,Stayed at the apartment for a month. It's in a wonderful location to explore the city on foot and if I needed to go any farther it was a cheap uber ride. It is in an older building but the apartment is nice and clean with fresh linens and a washer and dryer in unit which was amazing. The kitchen is well stocked with all of the basics which made cooking at home easy. It is well lit with natural light and everything is really well maintained.  Overall I had a great experience and would definitely stay again. 
7533901,53520817,2015-11-09,790340,Megan,"Marc was a very helpful and responsive host. The condo is great-- it is literally right around the corner from the convention center (and anything else downtown), so super convenient. The place was very clean and had all the amenities we needed!"
2103939,9579126,2014-01-02,3861254,Fern,Great location! We loved the area and it was close enough to downtown. It was awesome that Ann was able to host 4 of us with a little bit of a short notice too. The only thing was that it was kind of disorganized meeting with her. She was really kind and helpful on what was in the area though and it was a cozy and comfortable place!
2103939,9934409,2014-01-20,10919018,Jason,"The place is larger than it looks in the photos, and the location was fantastic.  I didn't rent a car and took the bus everywhere, as there is a bus stop one block from Ann's place.  I did not meet Ann in person.  Her uncle Ernest checked me in and out and was exceedingly kind.  Ann supplied a list of restaurants in the area within walking distance and sent along other ideas via voicemail and text message as she thought of them.  It's a beautiful neighborhood with easy access to capitol hill and downtown without a car."
2103939,10715720,2014-03-04,11067853,Tony,"Given that our flight was significantly delayed, Ann was really accomodating about when to meet up and she steered us to a place near the apartment that had very good drinks. The apartment itself was perfect for the three of us and it was a great home base from which to access Seattle. The bus is right around the corner and there are restaurants and grocery shops within a couple minutes walk. We even got to see some nesting eagles while walking around the neighborhood. Would definitely stay here again!"
2103939,11624823,2014-04-09,13524990,Rachel,"Staying at this apartment was great. The neighborhood is beautiful and there is a small grocery store nearby, as well as a Starbucks and the bus station. It made it really easy to get around Seattle. 
The apartment has a bed and futon so it was good for my cousin and me, there was a desk to work at, and it was comfortable overall.
One small note is that the wall outlets are all two-prongs, but Ann did have a powerstrip that accepted plugs with a ground."
2103939,13391586,2014-05-26,15728082,Angie,"Ann was very nice and easy to work with. My travel plans were last minute and I flew in late and she was flexible on meeting my friend and flexible with checkout as well. Her apartment was very cozy and the grounds were beautiful. I loved the neighborhood it was in, felt very safe and it was convenient to get where we needed to go. We mostly used Uber taxi and it took about 10-15min to get to downtown. I would recommend staying at her apartment to others!"
2103939,13627757,2014-06-01,13372379,Madhavi,"We hesitate to give such an honest, positive review because this place is a jewel that we want to keep a secret! The flat is a perfect size for a couple and not only is the bed in the bedroom a dream, there is an incredibly comfy couch, as well as a futon, in the living room in case someone snores. The complex is quiet and the grounds are beautiful. Ann is a gracious host and keeps a clean, well lit apartment that easily feels like home. Madison Park is like Mayberry and we never left the neighborhood. Two thumbs up for the flat, the host, and the hood!"
2103939,14878196,2014-06-28,14090507,Aaron,"Ann was very welcoming and really did what she could to make us feel at home.  I stayed there with two other guys while we went to UW, it was perfect and comfortable. The neighborhood was really great, It was a quiet retreat from the Seattle distractions. bus access was perfect, and the place was very close to the water and madison park. There was no internet, but it was nice to disconnect.  I would rent this place again in a heartbeat.  "
2103939,15072127,2014-07-01,6635656,Sandy,"I booked this place for my friends. Ann was a really nice host, and she had been very helpful. The place was really nice and clean. "
2103939,15648124,2014-07-13,12589557,Jennifer,"My husband and I stayed with Ann for two nights and absolutely loved her neighborhood.  It’s close to shops, restaurants, and a public access beach.   As the listing suggests, the apartment is quite cozy and it is also very clean.  Ann is a friendly, welcoming host and had great recommendations for our daily travels throughout Seattle."
2103939,15883057,2014-07-17,13758373,Janet,We were confused at first b/c she was going to be out of town but the plans had changed so she was staying. She still let us have the apartment to ourselves and she stayed elsewhere. 
2103939,16109218,2014-07-22,130500,Marna,"Very pleasant apartment with Madison Park amenities only a short walk away.  We were pleased to find how easily the space could comfortably accommodate our daughter joining us, but were disappointed when  car problems related to a nasty traffic snarl in Eastern Washington prevented her arrival."
2103939,16372698,2014-07-26,1034824,Heric,"We had a great week staying in your place. Thank you for everything.

2103939,17783675,2014-08-17,2848954,Malcolm,"Wonderful stay in a well-maintained, traditional complex in Madison Park. I worked a full-day in California and then our flight was delayed, so we got there late in the evening. Ann was very gracious. The apartment was quite cozy."
2103939,18503545,2014-08-27,20230677,Yaniv,"A nice and cozy apartment with easy public transport into the city center.
Lovely location in peaceful neighborhood, near the water with great view and access.

Ann made me feel very welcome and tried to make my stay as comfortable as possible, as well as pointed out a lot of information regarding Seattle. 
 "
2103939,18900994,2014-09-02,1833317,Ashley,Quiet area. Quick walk to shops and a very good bus line.
2103939,20193701,2014-09-25,5905955,Teresa,"Staying at Ann's apartment was my home away from home for my four day business trip.  It was quiet, clean and comfortable and the bed was great. I was close to all the places I needed to go to in the city, but enjoyed retreating to the residential neighborhood near the lake, instead of a downtown or airport hotel. Ann was a very gracious host; vibrant and fun to talk to.  Parking at night was at times a challenge, but not that big of a problem. I'd definitely recommend her place to anyone visiting Seattle."
2103939,20982871,2014-10-08,10162990,Richard,Nice place. Great sleepy area of town. Ann was very accommodating for our special requests.
2103939,24267883,2014-12-24,1832499,Sophis,"My stay at Ann's place was very pleasant. The apartment was cozy, clean and located in a safe neighborhood. I'd certainly recommend this listing to anyone wishing to visit Seattle. Plus Ann was a wonderful host."
2103939,25929821,2015-01-30,25110148,Tricia,"Ann was very accommodating and the neighborhood is great.  Quiet and close to bus line.  Nice secure building, perfect for what I needed to recuperate after my oral surgery.  

Great restaurants and grocery store near by."
2103939,28529095,2015-03-25,15126577,Anne,"This was a delightful place to stay. I especially appreciated the bed! It is definitely the most comfortable I have encountered. The host had books about Seattle, maps, and walk information available. She also provided an umbrella which came in very handy. I like being on the third floor with no one above me. The location is great with bus service a block away, also grocery, hardware, drug stores, and Starbucks all with in easy walking distance. "
2103939,29366265,2015-04-06,14414374,Helga Marín,"Ann responded very quickly and was very friendly. Her apartment was clean and as described. It is well located in Madison Park, with coffee shops right around the corner. There was no internet however, but like Ann suggested, there are coffee shops are close by and provide Wifi."
2103939,29868023,2015-04-13,9522506,Genevieve,"Ann was a gracious host. The complex is very conveniently located. Her apartment is just as advertised. We misunderstood and were not specific about requesting internet as instructed in the listing, but Ann went out of her way to get it set up for us while we were there anyway. Very appreciated!

We did notice significant nighttime noise each night we were there, unfortunately. The complex is old, which is definitely part of its charm, but as such we could hear people coming and going, neighbors playing loud music in their apartments into the wee hours of the morning, and conversations in the hallway. 

Overall price to value was good. 
"
2103939,33448654,2015-05-28,7775516,Meryl,"Greeted by fresh flowers and a nice tour of the apartment by Ann.  The place was in a great location, easy to get downtown on the 11 bus.    Apartment complex was quiet, and the apartment was very spacious.   Easy parking in the area.  Secure building was reassuring too! "

She was great to deal with in our situation specifically,  we were returning to the USA after 10 months in China and moving to Seattle at the same time as our return.  The apartment is super too! Well equipped and comfortable! Thanks!!!!!!"
2103939,40507658,2015-07-31,25826898,Kevin,"My girlfriend and I spent a weekend at Ann's place near Lake Washington. I would describe the overall experience as positive, however, there were ups and downs without question. In order to book this place, it required more effort than it did for me to find my job and we dealt with a fair amount of stress in the process as well. Ann asked for multiple references from both of us; not a big deal, we understood that she only wanted upstanding citizens to stay in her house. However, even after our references cleared, she seemed reluctant to give us an address or a phone number to contact her at. In fact, by the time our flight landed in Seattle from California, we still only had a general idea of where we were going. Luckily, we were able to get in contact with her uncle, who was generous enough to meet up late with us to exchange keys. It was only on the cab ride there was the address even revealed to us. I understood her concern for who is staying at her house and keeping her information private, but after clearing multiple references and paying her, I thought she should have been willing to share her information with us at this point, and this aspect proved to be inconvenient and stressful.

With that said, the location of Ann's place is amazing. It is less than .5 miles away from lake Washington. Her place was very clean, the bed was comfortable, and the neighborhood seemed very safe. It is about 15-20 minutes from downtown. It costed approximately $20 on uber to get into the heart of the city.

Overall, we enjoyed our stay at Ann's place. Outside of the stressful start, it proved to be a very positive experience."

2103939,46073958,2015-09-07,16359676,Ramon,"It was a pleasure staying at Ann's place.  The apartment is comfortable and quiet and in a pleasant residential neighborhood.  I would absolutely go back.
Here's what I think her potential guests should be aware of:
Her place is about 3 and a half miles from downtown Seattle, which takes about 20 minutes via bus.  During the day the bus runs twice every hour, after hours it runs once an hour.  If you aren't thinking of taking a cab or Uber you'll want to keep that bus schedule handy.
Also, If you are a night owl like me, you are not likely to find anything open nearby past midnight during the week."
2103939,47308209,2015-09-17,32627262,Weishi,"Ann is a great host. Her uncle met us downstairs at 2:30 and gave us a tour. The place is tidy and cozy. It basically has everything we need. The neighborhood is also a quiet and safe place if you want to walk around. 
I left my stuff in her room. Her uncle was very nice to let me pick up my stuff after we checked out. He even gave me guest passes for the museum of flight. "
2103939,47989967,2015-09-22,9217266,Todd,Ann's place was great.. Exactly what we wanted.. easy parking around and lots of nice little places to walk to in the morning. Ann was great and meeting her uncle Ernest was a treat! 
2103939,50025407,2015-10-08,20448298,Jeff,Great neighborhood. Very comfortable bed. Nice thoughtful touches like stocking coffee for guests to use. I have a big car and parking was easy.
2103939,52498935,2015-10-30,44715577,Misayo,"Ann was such a lovely host. Her warm welcome and kind considerations, not to mention the charm and comfort of her spacious place, made me feel so at home and at ease. She treated me as if I were an old friend and even took me out for a sightseeing! Loved walking in the neighborhood. Very convenient with one bus to downtown, and a grocery store and cute restaurants nearby. Thank you, Ann, for making my stay in Seattle wonderful. Can’t wait to return already!"
2103939,54060388,2015-11-15,42628023,Priscilla,"Ann was a gracious and generous host and went out of her way to make me feel welcome.  Although the place is usually available as an entire apt, she happened to be in town that week and offered to share with me, which I happily accepted.  We got along splendidly!  The place was very clean and the bed very comfortable.  It's a wonderful neighbourhood, close to the Lake, very walkable to stores, restaurants, grocery stores, and (of course) Starbucks; the there's convenient bus service to downtown and other points in the city. Unfortunately the internet was down at the time, but wifi was close by at Starbucks so it wasn't a problem. "
5640722,28757016,2015-03-29,10132034,Ramani,"Elfie's space is exactly as it appears on her listing:  open, modern, and spacious.  It's on the first floor of her home, so you have lots of privacy.  RapidRide bus to downtown is just a short walk away, and you should take the time to walk around Green Lake; it's beautiful.  She was kind enough to take me along to buy groceries and fresh fruit from local vendors, and I got things for a song!  She is kind and responsive to her guests' concerns; you will enjoy your stay here as much as I did.  I would be happy to stay with her again."
5640722,29954713,2015-04-14,30817161,Zena,"one word to describe Elfie. Empathic. 
Listing accurate.
lovely area, safe easy public transport.
European elegance of the listing could not be more correct.
The lady is a class act and very humble full of joy and love.
I hope to stay here on my next trip to Seattle. 
Elfie will be a friend of mine.
Thank you Elfie. "
5640722,30265012,2015-04-19,31275832,Alex,"My partner and I made a special arrangement ahead of time with Elfriede to arrive late on the first day of our booking. She was very friendly and courteous on the phone, and we could tell already that we were lucky... Unfortunately, we arrived even later than expected due to traffic and some unforeseen circumstances. Despite this abuse of her hospitality, which we feared would test her patience, Elfie greeted us with warmth. She was eager to help us in every way over the weekend, even providing a little tour of the neighborhood, and an overview of some local history.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at her home. The amenities were highly adequate--the room and lavatory were well stocked with the appropriate necessities, and some snacks were even provided, in a mini fridge. The place is delightfully and tastefully furnished, the host is kind and caring, and the location is convenient and quiet. I cannot recommend this room enough!"
5640722,32438484,2015-05-17,10082848,Borja,"Elfie was a warm, considerate, friendly host from start to finish. The next time I travel to Seattle I will definitely stay at her place. 100% recommended.

The room is as spacious as it looks in the pictures. Clean, comfortable... Just great."
5640722,32851367,2015-05-22,15416045,Olivier,"I contacted Elfie to rent a room for a couple of my friends visiting Seattle for a week. As I was living nearby, Elfie let me come at her place so that we could talk a bit together and prepare for the arrival of my friends. From the beginning, Elfie has been a very nice and warm, perfectly mannered lady. And I must say, my friends received a very warm welcome and have been delighted with their stay.

Greenwood itself is a nice neighborhood, and a relatively convenient place from which to explore downtown (the E line comes close to Elfie’s and goes to downtown in less than 30 minutes). Elfie’s place was perfectly taken care of, the room (with its associated bathroom) was great, and its location in the house (with a direct access to a closed garden) makes it really private. Elfie was a perfect host - respecting the full privacy of my friends, but always here in case something was needed. She even had a number of attentions for her guests that were beyond what we were expecting. I can only be highly positive about the experience me and my friends had with her!

I would definitely recommend a stay with Elfie!"
5640722,33182542,2015-05-25,29771213,Mike,"Elfie is a wonderful hostess!  She gave us an inviting place to stay in Seattle, complete with warm muffins and jam for breakfast. Elfie provided guidance on where to go and what to do in the surrounding area.  She is a genuine and kind human. We highly recommend staying with Elfie in her lovely home."
5640722,33707444,2015-05-31,32937519,Hang,"I and my wife lived in Elfie's house for more than three weeks. In one word, it is like home! Everything is clean, comfortable and organized. Elfie is warm, elegant and humorous. If we come to Seattle next year, we will surely stay again with her. The neiborhood is quiet, safe and beautiful. It is convinient to get to downtown, northgate mall and green lake, so almost every thing! I highly recommend it!"
5640722,34804153,2015-06-12,32096758,实,"Quiet, clean and cozy. I lived in Elfie's house with my husband for three weeks and felt like at home. Elfie is a warm and nice lady, I likes chatting with her. I would love to stay with her again. Highly recommend."
5640722,34955175,2015-06-14,31248265,Randy,"Elfie contacted before I was to arrive and kept me posted as to the availability of the room.  My schedule was fluid and dependent upon others and Elfie was quite gracious in waiting for my much later than anticipated arrival on a Friday evening. The room was lovely and EXACTLY how it looks in the picture.  There was a bottle of water for me, a bowl of cherries and some cheese for snacks in the refrigerator. I can't remember if the listing states whether there is parking but it is there and Elfie told me immediately upon arriving where I could park (in front - so convenient).  I was quite please with my stay and plan to come back again because my son lives in Seattle."
5640722,36109728,2015-06-25,155040,Prem,"Elfie is definitely ""the hostess with the mostess.""  Arriving in the late evening after a long flight, she offered a warm welcome and a quick introduction to the living space...and an icecream dixie cup in the freezer.  Sadly, I had a very minor car accident.  Elfie buffed out the mean-looking scuffs and led me to a local body shop.  The living space is huge, filled with trophies from her adventures and reminders of her European heritage.    After full days and evenings out of the town with family, Elfie inobtrusively checked in the me to see if I needed anything.  Kudos for Elfie! "
5640722,36448777,2015-06-28,35804476,Troy,My stay was great. Elfie was wonderful and gave us a lot of great suggestions for things to do. The room was very spacious and the deck was very nice to spend the hot evenings on. Was only a 3 min walk to the bus stop that takes you directly to down town. Would definitely stay again and recommend to anyone.  
5640722,36970990,2015-07-03,33328089,Dan,"Elfie was an amazing host. The room was exactly how it appears in the pictures, and the fridge was already stocked with water and some snacks for us.  We were pretty regularly out of the room (the bus to downtown is only a few minute walk away) but when we were back at night we would sit on the deck outside and Elfie would always ask how our day was and if we needed anything else.  We were looking for an apartment to move to Seattle and she always gave us insight into the neighborhoods we looked at, and even gave us coupons for restaurants and shops in Greenwood and Downtown.  She even offered to take us out for a drink with her friends!  She provided the perfect amount of care while always respecting our privacy.  I would highly recommend staying with her to anyone."
5640722,37514169,2015-07-07,11501972,Josh,"We had an amazing stay! Elfie was a fantastic host, was so welcoming and gave us excellent recommendations for Seattle. The room was very comfortable, nicely decorated and had everything we needed. We would really recommend staying there! Thanks Elfie!"

5640722,38737762,2015-07-18,34633505,Dave,"Staying at Elfies place was a great start of our holiday. The room is neat, spacious and there is a private patio! Elfie is a great host and makes sure you are happy. The neighbourhood is quiet and a bus line is right around the corner to downtown. Restaurants like a great pizza place and a micro brewerie are a 5 minute walk. I Would recommend this place to anyone staying in Seattle!"
5640722,40458385,2015-07-31,16779710,Christina,"We stayed at Elfie's for two weeks and her private room is just great. The room is spacious, and Elfie has added little things -- a small fridge, microwave, coffee, extra towels, tv -- that make a stay very comfortable. The garden patio is sweet and peaceful and having a reserved parking space is helpful. 

Elfie is a super host. She is thoughtful, kind and hospitable. One of my favorite things is her offer to put fresh sheets on the bed while we were out. Not only did she change the sheets, but she left chocolate on our pillows. I loved that! And she is flexible and accommodating - as evidenced by her willingness to provide me with her schedule and work with mine to be sure that we had a key for our.

If I were traveling to Seattle and in need of a space I would absolutely stay at Elfie's."
5640722,41036882,2015-08-03,39646111,Lu,We had a great time at Elfie's place. The house is located in a quiet neighborhood and we really enjoyed our stay. Elfie gave us the coupons to the local museums and dropped us off at the bus station. Thank you for your hospitality Elfie! 
5640722,41409757,2015-08-07,14929480,Leeanne,"Elfie was a fantastic and exceptional hostess! We spent three nights at her cozy and comfy first floor space with a private bathroom and porch space. The room was clean and featured a desk space, dining table, mini fridge and kitchenware. We could have stayed another month!

Elfie was very generous with her advice and tips for enjoying the city. We spent all of our days on the go, but heard about her many adventures all over the world. What a  wonderful city and a wonderful stay!"
5640722,41971767,2015-08-10,36752882,Kaitlyn,"Elfie was our first host trying out Airbnb and we couldn't have been more at home with the place. Very safe neighborhood! Elfie genuinely cared about us but was not nosey. When traveling to Seattle again, will seek to stay with her again. :)"
5640722,42434061,2015-08-13,38874665,Andrea,"Elfie was communicative from the beginning and was interested to know us. Room was private with its own bathroom and private deck in quiet neighborhood. It's on the first floor, so really easy to go in and out. Everything was clean and many things were provided, even a mini fridge. Elfie was so helpful with getting to know Seattle. Sadly, we didn't get to spend too much time with her because our travel schedule was hectic. She was so nice! Bus stop is close by and convenient to get to downtown Seattle. Not far from anything you'd want to visit!"
5640722,42687922,2015-08-15,5839396,Penni,"This is a comfortable and spacious suite.  It is ideal for longer stays in the Seattle area because it includes a small fridge and dishes/flatware, a desk and plenty of reading material for fun and for tips on Seattle.  Elfie is very helpful and I particularly appreciated her flexibility when my flight kept getting delayed and my arrival time kept getting later and later.  Thank you!"
5640722,43393907,2015-08-19,38538359,Matus,"Everything was perfect. Elfie communicated with us leading up to our arrival, and she was a friendly and very helpful host. We also appreciated the snacks she offered us, that was a very nice touch. All in all, highly recommended."

The room has any amenity you could need - large bed, nice bathroom, sliding door that opens up to a patio, a small fridge, tons of cabinet space and loads of information about Seattle and the surrounding areas! The house is in a beautiful quiet neighborhood with easy access to the best parts of Seattle. The parking space right by the house was a definite plus!

Elfie was such a wonderful host! She was very helpful and gave us many great recommendations, especially for gorgeous hikes! I will most definitely be back :) "

5640722,45726491,2015-09-05,9831260,Betsy,Elfie's place was comfortable and clean. Elfie was very kind and welcoming.  She was very concerned about how we were getting along with our vacation plans and offered suggestions and had helpful material to assist with our planning process. We would stay there again.  It is quiet and away from the hustle & bustle of downtown. A five minute walk for those using public transportation.  A twenty-five minute bus ride to city center.
5640722,46903211,2015-09-14,25795304,Sahily,"This is my first time staying at an Airbnb and Elfie made my stay a fantastic experience. Elfie was always available when we needed her and even gave us coupons and a lovely bread dish. She was very informative and always had tips for us about Seattle. The room is exactly as it looks in the photos and it's very spacious and clean, in a nice neighborhood. This is a great room for an extended stay because it has everything you may need, from a fully-equipped eating area, to a desk. All in all, I couldn't have asked for a better hostess and I will definitely stay with her in the future! "
5640722,47745922,2015-09-21,5051508,Mary,"My husband and I just returned from staying at Elfie's place for four nights while visiting our daughter, who's a student at UW. We had lots to do while we were there! Elfie was a most open and friendly hostess. She provided everything we might need: mini-fridge, microwave oven,  coffee maker, the works! I especially appreciated the private bath and private entrance. The room is quite spacious, and we were very comfortable. It's right off a major thoroughfare, but feels very private and is very quiet. Elfie was there when we needed her, offering suggestions, but not at all intrusive. She even offered us a ticket to a piano competition when she learned we were interested in classical music! Unfortunately, we couldn't take her up on it, but her kindness was very much appreciated!
We highly recommend Elfie and her hospitality!!!"
5640722,49129718,2015-10-01,23789975,Susan,"Elfie is a friendly and helpful person and a good judge of character. Every detail was thoughtfully attended to for arriving guests, including lots of breakfast items in the reefer. It was a perfect place to stay. Good neighborhood, lots of privacy, good light, a little outdoor private space, warmth, good hot water, my own entrance, easy access, etc. She has lots of helpful information available for visitors, good reads, etc. You will never regret booking with this energetic and interesting woman."
5640722,49603073,2015-10-05,8371110,Rich,"My host, Elfie, was easy to work with throughout the reservation process and for check in/out.  The room was as described and pictured, and an excellent choice for my needs.   I was visiting my son and his family, very nearby, so I spent little time in the unit and interacting with Elfie.   It was quiet and comfortable for sleeping, and the bath was well supplied.  Off street parking was a great bonus.

Overall, the room was clean, comfortable and a great value in a location that was perfect for me."

2882641,13431711,2014-05-27,8025820,Katie,The house was exactly as described.  It is very comfortable and quiet.  It was way more inviting and homey than staying in a hotel.  I love the neighborhood!  Capitol Hill is so fun and vibrant!  There are great bars and restaurants all within walking distance.  There is a bus stop just on the other block that runs straight to downtown.  We used UBER the whole time we were there and it was very convenient. We loved staying at Adam's home.  He is very accommodating and so nice. He had fresh flowers waiting for us when we arrived.  We will definitely be staying here again!!!
2882641,13921089,2014-06-08,15182375,Michael,"What a great location! Close to everything and definitely a quiet house.  The pictures definitely do not do justice like the other person said.  House is super comfortable and has pretty much everything you need. I would highly recommend this location if you don't want to stay downtown, and have a car.  Parking is plentiful and not an issue whatsoever. A quick 10 min drive up Madison and you are downtown, another 10 min on 23rd ave and you are at UW.  This was the perfect location and Adam definitely made you feel at home.  He left us fresh flowers and made everything cozy for us, just as if you were at home.  I unfortunately did not get a chance to meet Adam, but someone in my party did and said that he was super friendly and nice.  We didn't get a chance to use the kitchen but it is definitely a chefs kitchen.  Safeway/Trader Joes is within walking distance and we should have utilized it more, but there are so many good restaurants in Seattle that we couldn't resist.  

If you are definitely looking for a big space, that has the old charm but with modern amenities look no more.  We were REALLY happy with this place and I would highly recommend it.  Did I also mention that he radiant heating for the kitchen floors?  Absolutely awesome!"
2882641,14282425,2014-06-16,14456856,Solomon,"Loved this place- clean, great location. Adam is friendly and responsive. "
2882641,14739190,2014-06-25,4180788,Michelle,"The listing and neighborhood are fantastic! We had 3 people in our party, which worked out perfectly with the bedrooms, privacy, and shut eye. The kitchen is a dream, and the apartment is an excellent blend of old world charm and hi-tech efficiency and comfort. Adam was a very responsive host (with a good sense of humor to boot), and always a text or email away. Looking forward to booking with him again next year, if not sooner!"
2882641,14963624,2014-06-30,14417049,Juliana,"Adam was great.  The place is really cute.  I loved all his geek art on the walls.  (legos , Game of Thrones, ect.)  Very clean.  It felt like home.  The kitchen is to die for.  I wanted to stay in and cook.  It is on a quiet street.  The beds are comfortable.  I really felt at home here.  We walked down to brunch and coffee a few times.  Easy to get to Madison and (website hidden)/DR: Clean, Charming, Fun, Walkable."
2882641,15818988,2014-07-16,4233617,Lindsay,"We really enjoyed staying at Adam's home in Capitol Hill.  The neighborhood was great and there were many restaurants in walking distance, or a short bus ride away.  The kitchen was very big and although we didn't get a chance to cook anything because of our busy schedule, it would have been great!  We needed an ironing board to iron clothes for a wedding we were attending, and at first there wasn't one in the house, but Adam went right out and purchased one for us; that was very sweet of him.   "
2882641,16065539,2014-07-21,14569333,David,"This place is fantastic!

Clean and modern, great amenities (total kitchen envy), located in a great neighborhood, extremely close to the bus stop we needed. 

Adam was a great host, offering to be around when if we needed him (we never did), and making himself scarce most of the time. 

10/10, would stay again. "
2882641,16459257,2014-07-28,1901175,Cat,"Adam was a wonderful host! Great location in Capitol Hill and a beautifully updated home. We were a family of six (including two small kids, two parents, and two grandparents) and it was perfect for all of us. Even has a beautiful outdoor patio space on those sunny Seattle days that we used for grilling our dinner outdoors one night. Kitchen was very well stocked, washer/dryer was super useful for our long stay, parking was easy, and the games were an added bonus for entertaining the kids. Adam was a very friendly and laid back host. Would definitely stay here again and again!"
2882641,16891209,2014-08-04,15322991,Chris,Great place! Even better location! Excellent host. 
2882641,17676415,2014-08-16,15618275,Maria,"Adam was very welcoming. The first night was very hot, usually so for Seattle, and there was no a/c or fans. When we asked about fans, Adam went out and bought two fans immediately that night. They came in very handy. The kitchen seems almost completely new and is very nice. The capitol hill location was perfect for us. It is relatively quiet urban location and there are nice restaurants, shops and ice cream within walking distance. I would highly recommend this apartment.    "
2882641,19329267,2014-09-10,17966129,Adam,I can't say enough good things about Adam and his space! The location was very convenient and safe. Super easy free parking. The neighborhood is very quiet and just a few blocks walk to restaurants. The unit was exactly as described and very clean upon arrival. The kitchen is top notch! Everything you need to cook a delicious meal or two. We took advantage of the amazing weather and patio grill to cook a few meals. Adam was extremely responsive with any questions I had prior to arrival and checked in on us while we were there. Great guy with a great spot. We travel to Seattle every 3 months and we will definitely be staying here again.
2882641,20562275,2014-10-01,5671948,Nicole,"Staying at Adam's house was awesome! I would schedule a trip to Seattle just to stay there again. It was clean, well decorated and stocked with everything we needed- tons of clean towels, paper towels, toilet paper, condiments in the kitchen etc... The kitchen is lovely and totally set-up to stay in and make a great meal at home. The neighborhood is quiet and cute but it's super close to Capitol Hill where you can find tons of restaurants, shops and bars. There's also Trader Joes nearby. The patio has a fire pit, BBQ, waterfall and was the perfect place to hang out when the weather was nice. Adam was totally cool and there to answer questions and chat but also completely not obtrusive. The beds were so comfortable that one of the days we were there we stayed in bed long into the morning instead of getting up and exploring the city. If you're going to Seattle - I highly suggest staying here. Seriously, I can say enough nice things about Adam and his lovely house!"
2882641,20928623,2014-10-07,2383162,Nancy,Adam was a great host! He came down and said hi the first night we arrived to check in and make sure we felt welcome. He addressed any need or question with care and attention. The house itself is a beautiful zen retreat just a few blocks away from the heart of Capitol Hill.  It was a really magical stay. Thank you so much Adam! 
2882641,21677964,2014-10-21,22098178,Kate,"A big, huge thanks to Adam for being a terrific host. The property is charming and well-appointed with everything my partner and I needed for a five-night stay. The house is spacious and comfortable with a wonderful patio. The neighborhood is the perfect mix between urban and residential on a quiet street in Capitol Hill, yet walking distance to numerous coffee joints, restaurants, as well as a supermarket and drug store. Parking was easy! Adam is a great guy who is really thoughtful about both being there to help and give great recommendations on the neighborhood, or leaving guests on their own (I personally love a combination of both). I highly recommend this property as an alternative to Seattle's many downtown hotels with their high prices, difficult and expensive parking, and ever growing traffic snarls. I hope Adam will let us stay again!"
2882641,22061459,2014-10-29,11069591,Hanna,"Adams house was really lovely ! Super convenient and quiet and clean.  About a 15 minute walk from lots of restaurants, bars and coffee shops.  My only regret was not using his kitchen ! Adam was very helpful and responsive when we needed something.  I would definitely stay there again "
2882641,22374116,2014-11-04,20827569,Whitney,"The house was really nice and very close to everything we wanted to see and experience. Adam was great! He came down to chat with us and even hung out with us for a bit. Anything we wanted, he made sure we had and he was very informative about the area. We would totally book his place again. "
2882641,22659786,2014-11-11,5606711,Gia,"Adam's spot was clean, comfy, and very well-equipped. Not to mention, it was in a safe neighborhood with restaurants, bars, shops, etc all within walking distance, and just a short drive to downtown. It was a wonderful stay, and he made sure we felt extremely welcome. I'd recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle!"
2882641,23641042,2014-12-07,2733519,Sara,We had a fantastic stay in Seattle and Adam's place was the perfect retreat!  Quiet neighborhood ~ super comfy beds ~ a great kitchen and living space... We will return for sure on our next family visit to Seattle!  
2882641,24653060,2015-01-01,22043506,Claire,"Adam was an amazing host. He was prompt from day 1 and his house was everything we hoped for while staying in Seattle. Perfect location with lots of parking. Nothing but great things to say about the house itself as well. It's got old charm but with many updated amenities. Even just the kitchen in itself is amazing. Would definitely recommend staying. Thanks for hosting, Adam!"

2882641,49443967,2015-10-04,30420268,Scott,"Adam was a great host during my family's stay in Seattle! Unfortunately, my wife had to do some work on our trip, but Adam went out of his way to help, providing a printer, scanner and office space! The neighborhood was very quiet, always found a parking spot out front, and we enjoyed the short walks to many parks, shops and restaurants. Adam had a lot of fun games and books to read. The beds and appliances were top of the line and all worked great! We thoroughly enjoyed the open space and front patio area to BBQ. The weather was awesome the entire week! I'm not sure if he gets credit for that or not, but his name is Adam! Ha!    "
2882641,49932647,2015-10-07,3031130,Nick,Great place - easy process with the lockbox. lovely neighborhood. 
2882641,51783504,2015-10-24,35023629,Tamara,Adam was a great host! Very friendly and responsive. The kitchen is a master piece and the apartment layout is ideal for multiple guests that wish to stay in separate rooms. 
2882641,54861376,2015-11-25,2595771,Adam,"Adam was an excellent host, and our family enjoyed our extended stay in his townhouse. It's beautifully done and in an excellent location. "
2882641,55187393,2015-11-29,28496187,Christina,"Adam was the perfect host:  friendly, accommodating, helpful, and never intrusive.  He has renovated this older home with taste and style and, more importantly, with an eye to function.  We stayed over Thanksgiving week to prepare a feast, and had as our primary search criteria a good kitchen and large enough dining area w/ table for 8.  This house did not disappoint, with its Viking stove, excellent 2-part dishwasher, double-door fridge, and stainless steel/wood island.  Excellent location, yet quiet.  We also saw that there were features that we could use in warmer weather, such as the delightful outdoor dining space and grill.  We'd be delighted to return."
2882641,56498253,2015-12-14,47425665,Pen,"Adam was really welcoming and helpful during our visit to Seattle. He knows the neighbourhood well and had some great recommendations about where we could find what we needed. The apartment was spacious, warm, charming and comfortable - just what we wanted. Fantastic kitchen, really well equiped. We had a great time. "
2882641,57767029,2015-12-29,240348,Kristine,"The rental was great! It is beautifully furnished and very comfortable, with a lot of amenities. The apartment was on a quiet block in a fun neighborhood. Very nice of Adam to provide a lot of good books and some board games. Our family of 4 (including 2 elementary school-aged kids) had a wonderful Christmas holiday here. Would definitely come back!"
5686435,34973050,2015-06-14,6278975,Tisha,"This is a Beautiful Queen Anne Home indeed. My family and parents (2 couples and 1 baby) LOVED this home. It is simultaneously beautiful and comfortable. 

The neighborhood is peaceful and sweet, and only a couple blocks from Macrina Bakery, Ken's Market, and other niceties. 

Jennifer was the perfect hostess - reliable, prompt, sweet, and generous. She shared her home without reservation, even offering up her children's toys for play. We will try to stay here again on future visits to Seattle. "
5686435,35736937,2015-06-21,35782112,Monique,This lovely home was extremely charming and very family friendly.  The home was very comfortable and clean.  The kitchen was beautiful made you want to stay in and cook!  Jennifer was very responsive and added small touches such as slippers to make one feel at home.  Parking was very convenient and the neighborhood felt very safe.  I would definitely stay there again.
5686435,38728220,2015-07-18,35098833,John,"The home was perfect!  Just as shown on the profile, and Jennifer had a cleaning crew make it shine before we arrived.   Fresh flowers and clear messaging with the key made this smooth and enjoyable!

I would definitely stay here again when we come back to Seattle.

5686435,39944659,2015-07-27,27088716,Zhengbin,"The hose is cozy, comfortable and beautiful. It is fully equipped for everyday life of a family. The neighborhood is quiet and convenient, within minutes of driving to Space Need and the Pike Market. 

Jennifer was very responsive. 

We will come back again when we are in Seattle next time. 

Thank you,"
5686435,40927343,2015-08-03,13272018,Lynda,The host provided us welcome by having fresh flowers throughout the home.  The home is exactly as advertised.  The home was very clean and the neighborhood was quite and quaint.  We loved the area there is a market and multiple restaurants within walking distance we felt very safe walking in the area.  Jennifer was great she communicate with us prior to and during our stay.  I would stay here again whenI travel back to Seattle
5686435,41954742,2015-08-10,12372104,Linda,"Jennifer was very welcoming and wonderful. The house is spacious and beautiful. There were fresh flowers everywhere when we arrived and space made in the house specifically for our things. The neighborhood was close to shops and restaurants that we walked to daily. 
This was a really great experience for our family thanks to the host family. It exceeded our expectations. "
1827586,9941445,2014-01-20,6727432,Dylan,"My family and I traveled down to Seattle from Vancouver for a one-night stay at Leanne's house.  She has a very beautiful and funky home, with an overhead walkway, an open kitchen and dining room, tons of natural light, and a great location.  The place was very clean, the beds were comfortable and the kitchen was very well equipped.  I will definitely be staying here again if we do another trip to Seattle."
1827586,10292931,2014-02-11,10785020,Yingli(Edward),"Leanne is a nice and friendly lady. She has a nice family and very good house just nearby the Washington lake, very beautiful view and very easy to airport, downtown,supper market,gas station.you could find everything you need in her house for accommodation, heating system, hot water for shower, clean bath towel, clean bed sheet and blanket. Thank you so much and if I have chance to go Seattle. I will visit her."
1827586,10374460,2014-02-16,12098686,Elena,Had a wonderful one night stay in Leanne's home.  She made the checkin simple and even left us typed out notes to answer any questions we could have about the home. Absolutely stunning view of the lake! She was very nice and welcoming. The family pictures threw the house were lovely the house all around was just breath taking. Would book this location again in a heartbeat!
1827586,10680783,2014-03-03,5787055,David,"Leanne's house is even more beautiful than shown in the photos.  Great living space, well-equipped modern kitchen, cozy beds, great downstairs den, clean.  Leanne was a wonderful host:  Easy to work with and flexible."

1827586,11758004,2014-04-14,13271202,Cynthia,"My colleagues/friends and I enjoyed a ""writer's retreat"" at this lovely lakeside home and it was perfect. Just steps from Lake Washington and Seward Park we walked each morning and came back to an light and art-filled space to work. The kitchen was well-equipped with everything we needed to cook in, and we also enjoyed the vibrant Columbia City shopping and restaurant community. We hope to make this a quarterly retreat!"
1827586,13399375,2014-05-27,9448239,Kate,"Our experience at Leanne's house was extremely positive.  The house was clean, well-stocked with towels and kitchen supplies, and located in a very attractive neighborhood near the Lake and an easy drive to downtown Seattle.  Leanne was a wonderful host who responded to our questions on a timely basis and left a very clear (and humorous) set of ""house rules"" and helpful information about local eateries and other attractions.  We would go back in a heartbeat!"
1827586,14602406,2014-06-23,13466201,David,The hosts were gracious and welcoming and we got all the instructions we needed to turn on and off the stereo system and TV etc The house was very comfortable and had a great view of the lake and a relaxing back yard perfect for an evening BBQ and glass of wine. I would do it again in a heartbeat and would advise others to do the same.  
1827586,14961716,2014-06-30,1622541,Derek,"My friends and I had a great experience staying at this house and interacting with Leanne. Leanne was always very responsive and pleasant in her communications. The house is located in a pretty lakefront neighborhood, and includes a beautiful landscaped back yard with multiple sitting areas, plus a small deck overlooking the lake. The house is a nearly full-time family residence - so don't expect a generic hotel-like interior - but the master bedroom and two kids' rooms served our needs very well. Plus, it comes with a well-stocked kitchen. The house is a good distance from Downtown Seattle, but it was an easy drive to popular destinations. This was a lovely retreat at the end of our long days of sightseeing."
1827586,15856433,2014-07-17,11237230,Cyndi,"We had a beautiful time visiting Seattle and staying at Leanne and Kerry's house. The hosts were out of town when we arrived, and the house had not been cleaned, but they still managed to take care of our concerns quickly. They were even able to find us a pack n play for our baby to sleep in while they were out of town. 

One thing to note-you are responsible for feeding the cat while you are there. Which was fine, except when we first arrived the cat had an empty bowl and not sure when it was fed last. Our daughter (15 months) went to pet the cat, and he lashed out at her and bit her. Not the best moments upon arrival, but once the cat was fed-there were no more incidents. 

There was a moment of concern at 1:00 am  on our last night there. I awoke to a loud banging on the bedroom screen door. Unsure of what it was at first, I came to the conclusion it must be the cat trying to get in-when I pulled back the curtains expecting to see the white cat outside, a BROWN cat came running-meowing and hissing-from behind the curtains. Apparently it had gotten in the house and didn't know how to get back out. Scared me half to death (and woke the baby-not a pleasant night either). 

All in all this house is amazing-beautiful views of the lake and the surrounding area. The hosts left some great food suggestions and places to visit. We really enjoyed our stay!

"
1827586,19922311,2014-09-21,15247685,Carol,"The house was very nice and had a great view. There were six of us women who have been college friends since the 70s and we had a wonderful time. The house was quite comfortable, including a nice big sofa that all of us could fit on. The dining table also had plenty of room. The back yard is lovely and we enjoyed sitting outside. Bedding and towels were great and everything we needed was there. Leanne was very accommodating when one of our group had to arrive early. Thank you!"
1827586,23144807,2014-11-24,9150166,Meghan,"We had a wonderful time at Leanne's house! We hosted our family Thanksgiving there and it was perfect. They have a very well appointed kitchen, that's fun to cook in. There was plenty of space to mingle, hangout and eat.  The downstairs room was hit with the kids. And the upstairs family room has a very comfy couch and great view of the lake! Thanks Leanne!"
1827586,24461229,2014-12-29,21133195,Paul,"Leanne went above and beyond by building a wheel chair ramp for 2 guests in wheel chairs. 

She handled a plumbing problem quickly, calmly, and professionally. 

She left all of her beautiful Christmas decorations to give our visit that holiday glow. "

1827586,34939760,2015-06-14,22021676,Mary,"Very clean, comfortable home in a great neighborhood.  Beautiful setting right next to Lake Washington. Very open floor plan, lots of light.  This is not a rental home, but a personal home that is rented out, so it's not a sterile hotel-like setting.  All amenities you can think of are provided. Fully stocked kitchen. Lots of towels and linens.  There is a cat that comes and goes.  We had no issues with the cat but he/she did want to come in at 2am and woke me by banging on the door to be let in. Leanne and Kerry were very responsive to our questions."
1827586,35452335,2015-06-19,16956640,Andre,The place was great. House was as expected and very clean and comfortable with a great view of the lake. We had a great time in Seattle and was close to downtown.
1827586,38460475,2015-07-15,433147,Lyndsi,"Leanne's Seattle home was perfect! My girlfriend and I stayed there for a few nights. It's got an amazing lake view, especially from the upstairs patio where we enjoyed our morning coffee. The home was incredibly cozy, with a fun downstairs area to watch television. Great backyard as well, equipped with a grill and a smoker! Can't recommend this place enough"
1763809,10710022,2014-03-03,2270428,Christina,Quiet place to stay -enjoyed the place very much
1763809,11202359,2014-03-24,6168762,Evan,"Paul was a great host and extremely helpful with making my stay go smoothly. The house is gorgeous, cozy, and very well located. I was fortunate enough to have good weather and walked to most downtown attractions quite easily (~1 mile). When I was feeling lazy, a quick uber ride brought me where I needed to be for around $10.

Overall, a highly recommended place to stay and a house I plan to utilize for future trips to Seattle."
1763809,11386045,2014-03-31,70584,Mike Y Bine,"My husband and I stayed 3 nights at Paul's place (room 3) and it was excellent. We could use the kitchen to make our own breakfast in the morning and our room was nice and quiet.
To get into the Seattle downtown area we walked for approximately 20 minutes, however I think there is a bus too. The neighborhood is beautiful and seems safe - we even walked home at night.
We would come back!"
1763809,11670321,2014-04-11,13635708,J. Eric,"Awesome experience! The place was clean, pleasant, and in a great location. Paul, the host, was very responsive and helpful. If business brings me to Seattle again, this is where I want to stay."
1763809,12037728,2014-04-21,14375433,John,"I was anxious about finding a good place to stay in Seattle, but Paul was very hospitable.  I felt comfortable and at home.  Conveniently located within walking distance, the Spring Street Center was well situated.  I highly recommend staying here if you visit Seattle, this place is wonderful."
1763809,12319107,2014-04-28,1524200,Joseph,Excellent accommodations! Paul was extremely supportive and helpful. Great location and very clean! I have nothing negative to say. Would definitely stay there again.

1763809,13121690,2014-05-19,14640945,Drea & Jeff,"Paul was very prompt in accepting our request and provided all of the information we needed to check ourselves in right away.  The location is great (right across from a small park) and the room/house is very comfortable.  We knew it was going to be difficult finding a parallel parking spot so we waited until one opened up and left our car parked all weekend.  We found it really easy to walk downtown, to Pike Place Market and take the bus everywhere else we wanted to go.  

A few notes:  The room is really bright with natural light but, possibly too bright if you are trying to sleep in late.  There were other guests staying at the same time we did, but we didn't really see or hear them.  We never saw or noticed if they had any meetings in the downstairs space while we were there.  Overall we had a great first airbnb experience and would stay here again."
1763809,13223559,2014-05-22,4265327,Cheryl,"The house is in a great neighborhood and very conveniently located off the #2 bus route (stops all along Union) that takes you into downtown and even up to Queen Anne Hill. It is also just around the corner from a number of great restaurants. If the bus really isn't your thing, the walk into downtown is really reasonable, especially if it is not raining :). The room was nice and I had absolutely no problem with the hand-held shower up stairs or the more standard shower downstairs. 

Host was really great at keeping in touch and was extremely accommodating. 

I guess the only negative would be the other guest that was staying there at the same time. They were fairly noisy and I found the front door consistently unlocked. (None of this is the hosts' fault of course!) Just be mindful to keep your door locked!"
1763809,13828474,2014-06-05,11588420,Jeongmin,"He is very kind and responsible.
House is good and nice bathroom.

I recommend you.

1763809,13937667,2014-06-08,13666516,Javier,"Un lloc molt agradable al centric barri de Capitol Hill, Seattle. Les habitacions eren molt netes i l'ambient realment tranquil. Val a dir que hi vam anar entre setmana. Tot està molt ben muntat doncs la casa és un espai de meditacieo o alguna cosa així i viure-hi no hi viu ningú. Però tot està perfectament preparat per acollir hostes a través d'Airbnb, la cuina sempre a punt, els lavabos nets. Una experiència propera a un hotel si no fos epl fet que s'ha de compartir lavabo. Tot i això sós dos lavabos per quatre habitacions més dos vàters extres al soterrani en cas que algú tingui una emerència. Un lloc molt recomanable i molt econòmic."
1763809,15245390,2014-07-05,16996125,Jim,"Comfortable room, clean home with everything you need. Great location, easy to get to downtown Seattle, Public Market etc without getting on I-5. Parking can be a challenge.  "
1763809,15826764,2014-07-16,6046400,Natalie,"I absolutely LOVED my stay at the Spring Street Center.  I felt like I was staying at a good friend's house instead of renting a room.  The whole house has a very welcoming vibe, with all the amenities you'd need, and was in a super quiet and friendly neighborhood.  My room was so cozy, safe, and clean, and I loved eating my breakfast out on the front porch every morning.   Paul also gives really great directions and information to access the house and your room, and was great about getting back to me with any questions I had before I arrived.
I also loved that it was just a 10 minute walk to tons of restaurants and bar options, and easy to get to downtown and all the tourist attractions.  Honestly, I could not recommend this AirBNB more highly!"
1763809,15962034,2014-07-19,5055999,Steven,"Staying at Spring Street Center was a wonderful experience. The house itself was very clean and well-stocked. The electronic lock and key for the front door was very convenient and handy. The location is the real kicker, though. It allows for a fast, easy, and safe walk to and from Capitol Hill at night as well as a moderate walk to the water (Pike's Place/Seattle Center) during the day."

1763809,16999434,2014-08-05,17787512,Angèle,"We loved the Spring Street Center! The room was perfect, very clean and bright. The neighbourhood couldn't have been better, so quiet but right on the edge of the bustling areas of Capitol Hill. We were able to explore the best of Seattle easily form this Air BnB and the logistics of Spring Street were effortless. Overall a great experience and we'd definitely go back next time in Seattle. Thanks Paul!"

It was very clean, in a wonderful little neighborhood with great access to Capitol Hill and public transport to downtown, and had a large number of bathrooms available for guests, so you never had to worry about being able to use one.  Thanks, Paul!  I would definitely stay again."
1763809,18939010,2014-09-03,16072817,Ryan,"Paul was very accommodating in making our requirements work. There were some complications with conflicting bookings, and in the end, we were provided with more than what we asked for. Excellent value for the price, would totally stay there again.

Also, a great neighborhood for good food."
1763809,19093536,2014-09-06,20189073,Koyo,"We had an awesome stay! The room was big enough, the bathroom was clean, and we could drink delicious coffee. And he replied really quickly to my questions. "
1763809,19545626,2014-09-14,19623346,Pauline,"Paul's house is great, the room was like expecting but we have seen once there that there are different types of rooms: separate beds or double bed. I do recommend this place to stay in Seattle."
1763809,19704897,2014-09-16,4084453,Brady,"The Spring Street Centre was fantastic for our weekend trip to Seattle! It was in an awesome area (Capitol Hill) and on a quiet street. The house is charming, quiet and welcoming, with a really nice kitchen. The room was also great. Paul met us and gave us some great tips for things to do around town. Thanks for the great stay! "

1763809,21684858,2014-10-21,6155629,Jonathan,"I did not meet Paul on this visit, but communication via email was easy. I knew I'd be arriving well past midnight; and because of Paul's clear instructions beforehand, I didn't have any trouble with the keyless entry code. Positives: LOCATION, my sheets were clean, I had a hot shower each morning, & there's a Keurig-like Mr. Coffee in the kitchen for a quick a.m. cup. Challenges: the house smells bad, a mix of smells of moldy/musty carpet & dirty old furniture/body odor, like it needs a deep cleaning. Also, the walls are thin and the rooms close together, so if someone gets up in the night to use the restroom or otherwise goes into the hall, you will likely hear them. "
1763809,22322843,2014-11-03,3859151,Stephanie,"The listing was accurate, and the neighborhood was nice! Really close to the main street of Capitol Hill, so there was good food and coffee close by! I met Paul on our way out the morning of our departure and we was very nice. Throughout our stay he was helpful and responsive.
 
I didn't realize the house was a public space until we got there (I guess there was something I missed in the description before booking?). We stayed for 2 nights, and we were the only ones at the house the first night then the house was full the second night because of an event. Nonetheless, it was a good place to stay."
1763809,22678435,2014-11-11,13666516,Javier,Paul has been really helpful and we really have enjoyed our stay at Spring Center.
1763809,22996693,2014-11-19,13666516,Javier,"Com sempre el a Spring street ens han tractat molt bé. A en PAul no el veureu mai però s'encarrega de que tot estigui perfecte, hi em anat ja tres vegades, és un lloc molt recomanable per anar de visita a Seattle."
1763809,23919719,2014-12-14,13666516,Javier,"As always Paul has been really helpful. My parents spent 8 days at Spring street center and they enjoyed it a lot. They don't speak english and Paul made an effort to speak in Spanish with them, that was great. I would like to thank Paul. My parents will be happy to stay at Spring street center next time they come visit."
1763809,24784780,2015-01-02,25120222,Yueming,It's wonderful experience staying at Spring Street Center. It's a big house and room 3 is full of sunshine. Thanks for hosting us!

i asked him for a good places to go and a nice restaurant and he did. I enjoyed staying at the house. The house was clean and the location is perfect because u can get the volunteer park in 25 m walk or down town in 25 m walk. i like the place if i visit Seattle again this place will be in mind. "

 Lovely neighborhood, nice to walk in and  convenient to bus lines. We really enjoyed our short walk to the Co-op store to get dinner and breakfast supplies which we brought back to eat outdoors on the little back porch. Heavenly! 
Paul was just the kind of host we needed--helpful and kind. 
We like attending events in Seattle and are definitely looking forward to staying here again.  "
1763809,33367028,2015-05-27,30168972,Jim,"The host was pleasant and articulate; and provided verbal and written information on transportation, food, sightseeing, and events.

We really enjoyed our stay!  Quiet, comfortable bed, nicely furnished room, great to have use of a full kitchen and living room.   WiFi was a huge bonus."
1763809,34416419,2015-06-08,29827688,Jacques,"Mon épouse et moi avons séjourné toute une semaine au Spring Steet Center dans la chambre 3. Nous avons été agréablement surpris de l'endroit, un coin paisible, un quartier sécuritaire à quelques minutes du centre ville accessible à pied et par d'autres moyens de transport en commun. De plus nous avons eu accès à toutes les commodités pour cuisiner et manger sur place dans une ambiance chaleureuse. Nous avons apprécié, dès le début, de rencontrer notre hôte Paul qui nous a donné une multitude d'informations d'endroits à visiter. Nous recommandons cet endroit sans hésitation.  Jacques (et Louise)"
1763809,34645053,2015-06-10,32628982,Erin Nicole,Listing description was accurate and was a great neighborhood to walk around and explore with great restaurants. Host was very informative of how to get in for the keys and lock up also offered local restaurant suggestions.
1763809,35107576,2015-06-15,242335,Karen,"This is a wonderful, spacious airbnb homelike setting, in a great location on a quiet street in Capitol Hill in Seattle, close to great restaurants and public transportation. Paul is a wonderful host, taking care to make sure everything is o.k., and responding instantly to any emails or texts. He went out of his way to make sure our stay was comfortable. The house has a large living room, study, and kitchen for use by the guests, nicely decorated and kept very clean. There are two bathrooms to serve four rooms, so plan showers accordingly. I had no trouble with bathroom access when I was there, and everyone was very careful to observe the rules of courtesy for the other guests. There are plenty of clean linens and towels, and a lovely little balcony upstairs and front garden to sit and sip a cup of tea! I had a great stay with my family to see Seattle and attend my son's graduation. I will certainly use this airbnb again and am happy to give it a great recommendation. Thanks Paul! "
1763809,35954324,2015-06-23,33289547,Alireza,My wife and I stayed at Spring Street Centre for two nights and enjoyed it. The room was clean and had all listed items in the listing description. More important than that is the people you will find at Spring Street Centre. All the people are nice and welcoming. Especially Paul. I will definitely stay at this place if I visit Seattle again. 
1763809,36210368,2015-06-26,34687296,Riz,"I have stayed in the Spring Street House twice now - once with my entire family of seven where we rented the whole house (that was really cool!), and this time, I was traveling on my own and rented Room 3. When my whole family came, it was great to have the park across the street. The bed in Room 3 was very comfortable, and the guests were all very respectful and quiet. It was nice to have access to a full kitchen stocked with Koureg coffee, and a laundry room downstairs. Everything was very clean and well taken care of. The location of Spring Street Center is ideal - we had a view of the Seattle Space Needle and could walk to Pike Street Market among other things. Paul went out of his way to look for housing for me on a few nights when Spring Street was full. Thank you Paul, Marston, and Rachel for helping to make my stay enjoyable."
1763809,36890885,2015-07-02,35118299,Coen,"We did not get to meet Paul, but we enjoyed our stay in Spring Street Center.  It's a generally nice area, and the living room was very spacious and cosy."

1763809,40917993,2015-08-03,23400152,Rebecca,"I had a wonderful experience staying at the Spring Street Center. Being a first-time Seattle visitor, the house was in a prime location near amazing restaurants, bars and bus stops. I loved the ability to explore Seattle by foot and walk all over the place. The room was very clean and cozy and perfect for two people. The house was quit, clean and safe which made us feel at home. Although Paul was not there, he made me feel very welcome by answering all my questions beforehand and providing great recommendations of things to do in Seattle. I would definitely stay at the Spring Street Center again. "
1763809,41367150,2015-08-07,33330918,Shadan,"It's a clean house .the location is very good . Paul is very kind , and helpful . I love this house ,and like to stay here again ."

1763809,44786289,2015-08-29,13107281,Ting,"Pros: 
1. Great location
2. Free parking on spring street 
3. Clean house 
4. Has computer and printer 

Cons:
1. Room 3 - hot and humid during nighttime in summer 
2. The bed is size double(full), suit better for couple who can cuddle 

Paul responded quick. He offered me a air bed in the basement due to the hot and humid environment, which unfortunately was not something that I would go for. Overall, the house was feasible considering the price. 
"
1763809,46600176,2015-09-12,38855016,Kelvin,"Overall, this place was fantastic. It seems as if the four house bedrooms are dedicated AirBnB rooms, but everything is super cozy. The location is in a nice, sweet neighborhood a nice 20-minute walk from downtown. I never got to meet Paul, as he was away during the time, but he gave me a detailed set of directions and tips for anything I would potentially need, and also offered advice on restaurants around the area.

Besides that, there's a few nice perks with the house - a very nice patio to enjoy the perfect weather, a coffee bar by donation, a cool map that shows all of the places people have come from to visit, and a laundry/dryer for those who are staying longer.

Everything was organized and set up nicely prior to my visit, and it would be a no-brainer pick for me when I visit again."
1763809,48700835,2015-09-28,1323021,Ka,The Spring Street Center is a perfect place to stay in Seattle. It is located near Seattle University and close to restaurants and markets. The atmosphere inside the center is welcoming and peaceful. I highly recommend this listing.
1763809,49441565,2015-10-04,39900302,Donna,"The house is in a great location, and the space is welcoming and home-like. Paul met us as we arrived and carried my heavy suitcase upstairs, which I appreciated!"
1763809,49807438,2015-10-06,12696387,Fan,"I just had a great time in Paul’s house. It’s tide and nice-equipped, with wonderful neighbourhood around. Plus, with lost of good restaurant I found in yelp with 10 minutes’ walk.

Paul is a very nice guy too. I missed my flight that I arrived much later than expected, but Paul just showed great patience and helped me check-in.

I highly recommend Paul’s apartment, and wish I could come back and visit again."
1763809,50515929,2015-10-12,39085138,Jie,Great! Very well maintained apartment. Situated In a lovely neighborhood. Walking distance to major attractions. 
1763809,50790146,2015-10-14,7776627,Elizabeth,"This was my second ( and will definitely not be my last) stay at the Spring Street Center.  Both times I've stayed here have been great.  The place is quiet, peaceful, and pleasant.  It's pristine and comfortable.  It has been no problem to share bathrooms and kitchen with other guests.  The SSC is located a few blocks from Seattle University and within easy walking distance of good bus lines.  Would not be difficult to find a Car2Go car nearby, either.  "
1763809,51458290,2015-10-20,24816985,Town,"That was an awesome place to stay, clean cozy bed, tidy, quite, beautiful view, equipped-well bathroom, kitchen, everything here just so nice and with pretty reasonable price! I will have no hesitation to decide where to stay next time I go to Seattle!"

Paul kindly helped me get settled in on the first night even though I had overlooked information he already sent me and I called him in a slight panic. Highly recommended."
1763809,53476002,2015-11-09,10533994,Linh,"Very nice room, cozy, clean. Wonderful visit. I'll choose to stay here whenever I visit Seattle."
1763809,56045700,2015-12-08,48213634,Tuyen,It was a pleasant experience for my first time using airbnb.  The house was as described and even better than expected. Paul was very polite and courteous.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for an easy accessible location around Seattle.  We had 2 people supposedly taking room #4 which has 2 twin beds.  Another Airbnb customer arrived early and mistakenly took our room.  Paul was very nice to give us 2 separate rooms available at the time instead to resolve the situation.  I was very pleased of how nice the house was and how clean everything was.  Thank you Paul.  We will stay here again if we happen to be in the area again.  
1763809,56319384,2015-12-12,49304658,Luke,Great spot! Paul did a fantastic job about coordinating everything prior to my arrival. My first stay in an Airbnb and I would stay again!

7921278,45179841,2015-08-31,12848281,Harvey,"Staying with Quay and Wren was an awesome experience. Their place was clean and organized. They have really cool birds that fly around. They will land on your finger if you let them. (The birds are small)

The private itself was prepared and clean when we got there. Wren was able to provide us with an extra air mattress upon request. It was easily able to fit next to the real bed. My friend is 6""3 and I'm 5""6, and we both share the room comfortably. It's a decent sized room. We also had our own mini fridge in the room which was a nice surprise. 

As for location, it's about 8-10 mins away from downtown. Uber is recommended although you could take the bus. During our stay, we had to go to the Washington State Convention Center. Each Uber trip costed us about 8$ together. (About 4 dollars each when you fare split.) You can also ask Wren about relay rides if you're planning to rent a car during your stay. 

If you're into Vegan, Wren knows all the good vegan restaurants in the area. 

And also, Wren and Quay made us cookies. :) "
7921278,46543950,2015-09-11,43225139,Alison,"Wren and Quay were wonderful hosts - they made me feel welcome to their space, gave me advice on how to get around the city and where to eat, and even offered me homemade meals.  I would absolutely stay with them again."
7921278,49385213,2015-10-03,42795006,Miles,"Had a great stay for a week at Quay and Wren's.  They are the definition of hospitality...the room is comfortable, memory foam mattress is great. They have a lot of experience with the sharing economy.  I could not ask for anything more!  Great hosts."
7921278,49740389,2015-10-05,30289781,Jule,"It was very nice spending my time in Quay's and Wren's apartment. Everything was in perfect condition and I can in every way recommend this place. The place was clean, safe and very quiet. Also super convenient to bus routes, grocery and drug store. Netflix was good, too :-)"
7921278,50379877,2015-10-11,42795006,Miles,Another great stay at the nest :) Nice to wake up to birds chirping Sunday morning ;) super convenient to bus routes and grocery and drug store. Netflix is good too.

7921278,52183789,2015-10-26,45987277,Annie,Quay and Wren were lovely to stay with. The room was perfect and close enough to the city with easy access to transport. The girls have really thought of everything when it comes to providing their guests with everything they might need. 
7921278,53089461,2015-11-04,15943520,Steve,Quay and Wren’s room was what I was looking for. I stayed there five nights. The whole apartment and the rental room are clean and tidy. The room is quiet in a quiet neighborhood. There is a small refrigerator in the room. Quay and Wren were helpful and friendly. They gave me directions to their favorite grocery store and café. They lent me a large tote bag for use during my visit. The room has a TV and computer but I didn't use them because I was out most of the time except to read and sleep.
7921278,53536199,2015-11-09,4678956,Curtis,Quay&Wren were delightful and very welcoming during my first ever visit to Seattle and the west coast.The place is clean and I felt at home especially with the free ORCA card I was able to travel virtually anywhere in Seattle which helped my pockets in the long run. Quay recommended a few good spots to eat One was Araya's place it's a vegan restaurant but don't sleep on how good the food will satisfy your appetite. Also I had a red eye flight back home and even though I had to check out early I was able to leave my belongings their for day as I got my last exploration of the emerald city. I'll definitely keep Quay&Wren in mind when I visit again in 2016. Overall a good trip and great place to call home if you plan to visit Seattle.
7921278,55579170,2015-12-02,2488348,Yanyun,"It was a wonderful stay at the Nest! Very comfortable, and easy to get around with rail and Uber. Wren and Quay are lovely and very generous, and the birds are a treat. Highly recommended!!!"

4468524,24630268,2014-12-31,6296574,Benjamin,Jerome is a  great guy. His house is clean and tidy and he is very prompt in communicating with you about whatever questions you have. Definitely ask him about his grandkids - he has some very cute pictures! 
4468524,33050262,2015-05-24,1225435,David,"Jerome was a great host. He was flexible with my arrival time, even staying up to meet me when I got in late at night. He offered helpful travel tips to get around Seattle and British Columbia, and filled me in on the local history. Clean room and bathroom, too."
4468524,33856256,2015-06-01,17250306,Anthony,"I can't say enough about Jerome. He's by far one of the most likeable, caring and helpful people I have ever met. He's very knowledgeable about local bus routes, and always happy to offer tips and advice about the things to do and  best ways to get around. He helped me wrap my souvenirs, and even offered to let me leave my baggage in the house past checkout. The home is clean and well-taken care of, and the neighborhood is in an excellent location. 

One thing though: he does not accept reservations over a week, so take that into account when requesting a room. "
4468524,34035459,2015-06-03,10993240,Kenneth,"A no frills, affordable place in a suburban location. Stayed for 2 nights, the place is in a quiet neighborhood that's away from the bustle of the city yet close enough to to make commute there easy. Perfect place to retreat after a day of exploring Seattle. Jerome's a really warm and welcoming host too!"
4468524,34387248,2015-06-07,34997757,Marilee,"I arrived late and left really early on the morning of my last day so I actually never met Jerome in person. I can tell you he responds to emails and inquiries rather quickly and was very accommodating to my requests. Bed is a bit soft and ceiling fan didn't work. Other than that, quiet neighborhood with easy parking. Had a great stay!"
4468524,34654481,2015-06-10,29989054,Jimmy,Jerome is kind and generous host. He was able to accommodate all my needs. He was always available and even offered to drop me off at the  station .
4468524,35005099,2015-06-14,19707227,Sarah,"Jerome was a wonderful host! He was very accommodating when my original flight was cancelled and my arrival time changed. Throughout my visit Jerome was kind and welcoming,  always offering suggestions of where to go in the city and how to get there. The room I stayed in was small with a beautiful view facing east. The perfect place to return to after a long day exploring the city. I really enjoyed my stay with Jerome and would highly recommend staying in the Yellow Room!"
4468524,35589750,2015-06-20,27188461,Omer,Jerome is the best host ever!  Starting with easy check in and show you the house.  The room was as described and it was quite and comfortable!  Jerome is also always there to help in whatever you need.  The other guests are very nice and its fun to meet pwople all over I recommend everyone to stay there!  Im going to go back there again!
4468524,36132251,2015-06-25,6633660,Alexander,"Jerome was an excellent host with a great attitude! My friend and I rented the Yellow and Grey rooms and it was perfect because of the shared balcony and beautiful view! It felt like a suite. 


Like i said, Jerome is super friendly and made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived. The home was easy to find and very accessible to public transit. The yellow room is smaller but with the blinds open you don't register. Also, there are four rooms total so the signage and color coding by room is a big help to keep from stepping on your fellow guests toes.  

By the last day, I was ready to stay longer. Can't wait to come back and stay here again!"
4468524,36709899,2015-06-30,27488877,Mohamed,Jerome was a great host. The room is exactly how its described with a beautiful view. I had a very pleasant stay while visiting Seattle
4468524,37353462,2015-07-06,2401563,Arturo,It was a great experience to stay at Jerome's place.  He is great host. The room was clean and he  help me to know the city with information. 
4468524,38466627,2015-07-15,38204628,Scott,Jerome made me feel welcome as soon as I arrived. The description and the photos of the room was spot on
4468524,38635904,2015-07-17,34915182,Valerie,"What a great experience! My first time using airbnb and I was very impressed. My primary concern before my trip was safety but it turned out to be a non-issue. The home has a double deadbolt and is in a very quiet and safe area. Each room @ Jerome's house has an individual keyed lock. The home and the view from the yellow and gray room is quite beautiful.  It's a ten minute bus ride or uber downtown and even quicker trip to the fun and unique Capitol Hill area. Jerome has covered all the details to make your stay enjoyable. Access to a washer and dryer, water bottles and fresh fruit in the fridge. Jerome himself is gracious and charming host who truly cares about his guests and his wonderfully maintained home. I stayed for two days but could've easily stayed @ Jerome's place the entire week I was in Seattle. "
4468524,39029905,2015-07-20,18622548,Joe,"Jerome is very friendly and welcoming host, the room and house were in very good condition. Highly recommended."
4468524,39337199,2015-07-22,19849454,Justin,"Jerome was very welcoming opening his beautiful home. Extremely kind, generous person."
4468524,39446830,2015-07-23,38509766,Dave,"Jerome is an excellent and welcoming host, always available by cell, and often on the premises. The house is immaculate and in excellent condition. It's on a classically pretty Seattle street, 2-3 blocks from Lake Washington, one of the beauty spots of an area full of beauty spots, and about 15 minutes or less by car from downtown, and from the University of Washington in non-rush hour (I don't know what it would be like in rush hour). All that said, there is airplane noise--not enough to bother me, especially at the current price. 

I hope to get to Seattle again within the next year or two, and I'd like to stay here again.
"
4468524,39688172,2015-07-25,38533615,Laurent,"It was my first stay with airbnb , and it has been a perfect stay. Jerome is a wonderful host, very helpful, open minded and i had a great time chatting with him. His house is nice and quiet , located in a very peaceful area, with 3 bus lines passing near by taking you to downtown Seattle within 15 minutes. I had a beautiful view on lake Washington from my room. The house was very clean and comfy. Thank you Jerome for this very nice experience."
4468524,40012890,2015-07-27,6195130,Tristan,"For the price, it was a good stay. The home was clean and the room/house were as described. The neighborhood was beautiful and I felt safe. And Jerome seemed like a nice guy: He offered me fresh fruit, bottled water, and use of his washer/dryer. The view from the balcony of Bellevue is great.

Jerome kindly greeted me, but within minutes after I arrived, he began trash talking his neighbors who apparently left their cars parked in front of his house for extended periods of time, which made him frustrated--so much so that he told me he put dog poop on their cars to get the point across that he wasn't happy with them. I understand having beef with your neighbors, but I didn't need to hear it from my AirBnB host when it had nothing to do with my stay there, especially when there seemed to be plenty of parking in the area.

While I was there, one of his neighbor's cars that was parked in front of the house had dirt and rocks poured all over it from front to back; I heard the owner come out in the middle of the night and freak out about it. I don't know who did it, but that, combined with Jerome's story, made me want to avoid his neighbors in case they thought I had something to do with it.

There was a lock on my door and I had a key, so I felt secure in my room from other guests, but I admit I was a bit uncomfortable staying with a host who was so vocal about his frustration with his neighbors: I was worried I'd do something wrong in the house and get on his bad side.

I think Jerome's heart is in the right place, and he was a good host overall, but  there are some things that are better left unsaid."
4468524,40298709,2015-07-29,5619292,Emily,Jerome was a wonderful host. He is full of energy and all sorts of interesting info!  The space was clean and comfortable and Jerome had a fridge stocked with water and fresh fruit at all times.  Next time I'm in Seattle I would love to be Jerome's guest again! 
4468524,42159173,2015-08-11,37803355,Ben,"Staying with Jerome was a true pleasure. Nothing else enhanced the enjoyment of my stay in Seattle than knowing I got to come home to Jerome's beautifully maintained and extremely comfortable home. 
Not a thing was inaccurate about the description of this bnb and the only surprises were how graceful and hospitable was. He definitely exceeded what he needed to do as a host in my eyes; fresh fruit and cold water with jovial conversation and insightful advice on the city were without limit. 
When you stay with Jerome you truly feel like you're coming back to your own home at the end of a day in the city, even to the point where you feel like a true local. 
And on top of every other positive thing about Jeromes bnb...it has a great view. Waking up to see the Cascades every morning was half the joy in my trip to Seattle. 
I highly recommend staying with Jerome whether you're in Seattle for a day or two weeks. When I return to Seattle I will definitely stay with Jerome again.  "
4468524,43105393,2015-08-17,17267652,Karen,"Jerome was very welcoming, the location is nearby the cute Madrona neighborhood and lake, within walking distance to bus stops. There was always fresh fruit and bottled water available in the fridge (major plus as I like to maintain my healthy habits while traveling). To indulge, however, check out the Cupcake Royale coffee/cupcake shop on 34th, you will not regret it! "
4468524,44715921,2015-08-28,2861455,Reina,"Jerome was extremely warm and welcoming and I immediately felt like we were family, which was very comforting as a solo traveller visiting Seattle for the first time! He was very responsive and helpful from the very beginning. We had many great conversations, not to mention his house and the room were very clean and super comfortable to stay in. The neighborhood is also very safe with easy access to many different bus lines. And of course waking up to the view of the Cascades and Mount Rainier was the absolute best! I was sad to leave this amazing house but I will definitely be visiting again! "
4468524,46019370,2015-09-07,41828839,Jimmy,"Jerome was an excellent host and storyteller! The room, description of the area/view, and the house rules are spot-on. I was in town for the Bumbershoot music festival and this was my first time staying at an Airbnb. Needless to say, I was blown away by Jerome's hospitality and will definitely look him up the next time I'm in town! Although Central District may seem a bit far, it's actually within walking distance from a lot of major areas of Seattle. An uber or a busride should also be fairly inexpensive. Kudos on the fresh towels, fresh fruit, and bottled water!"
4468524,46807138,2015-09-13,33278324,Paul,"Jerome was the best host you could wish for, very friendly and helpful. The room was great as well, especially the view from the big balcony. I would definitely come back, couldn't recommend it more!"
4468524,47604686,2015-09-20,44536356,Predrag,"Jerome accepted my request after 15min.
House is nice, room and bathroom clean. Host is interesting person. I felt welcome and safe.
I recommend this place."
4468524,48110437,2015-09-23,24024227,Sam,"Jerome is friendly and the most thoughtful host I've come across on airbnb.
The room is cozy with a beautiful deck view of the lake, mountains, and Bellevue.
The neighborhood is quiet yet close enough to various neighborhoods.
Would absolutely stay again."
4468524,48362915,2015-09-25,2234440,Scott,"Jerome's home is clean, comfortable and in a great location. The morning view from my room was awesome. I enjoyed my stay and hope to visit again. "
4468524,48477542,2015-09-26,44585290,Aaron,Very welcoming host! Everything was perfect and I look forward to another visit!
4468524,48919131,2015-09-29,1568296,Tim,"Jerome was an amazing host! Friendly, communicative, welcome, and all all around great guy. You can't beat the location and price!"
4468524,49269279,2015-10-02,44741000,Vance,"Jerome is an excellent host.  He was welcoming and was generous in sharing stories and advice about the area.  It felt a little like staying with a quirky uncle.

The house is impeccably clean.  Furniture & finishes are nothing fancy, but everything was in good working order and comfortable.  This particular room had a deck with expansive views to the east, which was a nice bonus.

Location is very good.  Close to downtown, but far enough away that it was easy to park on-street. 

Tip: try Assimba Ethiopian on E Cherry while you are in the neighborhood!"
4468524,50510948,2015-10-12,23012077,Jen,"It was overall great experience! The place was clean and nice. The host, Jerome, was kind and interesting individual. It was great having to meet and have a conversation. I recommend his place to anyone who is looking for a place to stay during seattle trip!"
4468524,50824314,2015-10-14,44378201,Aruni,Great host. Nice room. I really appreciate for the effort he takes to make the stay pleasent 
4468524,51091619,2015-10-17,44378201,Aruni,Nice and comfortable stay. Everything was taken care by him to provide a pleasant  stay
4468524,51559042,2015-10-21,16420104,Emile,"I spent 5 days in the yellow room, and Jerome was perfect host. He knows the area very well, will give you tips and is always available to talk. The house is very clean and quiet, and perfectly located for a thorough exploration of Seattle !
Will return.
Thank you Jerome !
Emile"
4468524,52103881,2015-10-26,15351234,Martina,"Ich hatte eine wirklich fabelhafte Zeit bei Jerome. Das Zimmer war wie beschrieben super sauber und hatte einen tollen Ausblick auf die Berge und die Skyline. Tolle und ruhige Nachbarschaft, aber man konnte trotzdem schnell zu Seattle's Hotspots gelangen. Jerome legt viel wert auf eine gesunde Ernährung, sodass stehts frisches Obst zur Verfügung stand. Absolut weiter empfehlbar ! Vielen Dank"
4468524,53082985,2015-11-04,25537694,Juan,The house was very clean and beautiful. The room was very comfortable. The bus stop is just 5 minutes away to go to downtown. I needed to stay en Leschi so the location was amazing. Jerome is a great host.
4468524,53280813,2015-11-07,19803110,Miguel,"Jerome was all the time very nice and well disposed to help all the time. The room was as described in the description and the photos. Small but enough space for me to sleep and sit in the table available by the window (by the way, beautiful view from there). The neighborhood was beautiful, specially in Fall, with all the different colors of the surrounding trees and the park that is between the lake and the house."
4468524,55165410,2015-11-28,39609361,Hiro,Room was compact but enough to accommodate for one night. Jerome was so friendly and showed nice hospitality for everything I requested. I recommend you to stay here on your visit to Seattle!
4468524,56078761,2015-12-08,8033187,Cristián,"Jerome is very nice and friendly, and is completely willing to help out. He helped me wwith receiving packets and even driving me.

The room was nice, and so was the house.
The place is a little far away from downtown, but it's very easy to get there through several metro buses that are nearby.

Highly recommend it"
4468524,58094433,2015-12-31,46470553,Amirtha,Pretty and clean room with a beautiful view. Jerome was very welcoming and had good suggestions about what to do.
6992387,38234879,2015-07-13,40883,Melissa,Alex was very quick to reply to my last minute and very urgent need for accommodations.  Great host!  Would highly recommend!
6992387,39817515,2015-07-26,8650597,Engputer,"We had a very good time by staying at this house. It has a very big living room and the kitchen almost has everything. There is a yard too. The neighborhood is very nice also also, just a few minutes drive to Safeway. If you want to stay in Seattle, this is definitely a wise choice."
6992387,40956589,2015-08-03,37609742,Randi,The home and property were just as described and very nice. Checking in and out was easy. The home and garden are beautiful and very comfortable and relaxing. The location is great with plenty to do nearby while being located in a quiet and parklike setting. I'd definitely stay again and recommend it highly. 
6992387,45033589,2015-08-30,5610349,Sarah,"Good instructions, easy to follow. Neighborhood is great.  Lovely neighborhood to walk around.  We walked to the zoo, two blocks away, and to many restaurants.  Front porch is a great spot to sit and watch the world go by."
6992387,47727508,2015-09-21,41580171,Sharon,"Even nicer than in the pics. Alex left logs in the fireplace and a bottle of wine and smoked salmon to make us feel at home. He invited us to pick kale from the garden. Wonderful living room and lovely porch. Felt ""at home"" away from home."
6992387,48344041,2015-09-25,183866,B.J.,"Alex's home is beautiful and extremely comfortable. I had a very nice stay and felt at home in his lovely neighborhood.  

Very comfortable bed, great art around his house.  It's set apart from the street as well; it was very refreshing to be in a ""city"" with so many trees and so little noise.  Beautiful yard and garden. "
6992387,55208673,2015-11-29,42934191,Sonya,"Alex was a great host! He went out of his way to obtain a Pack n Play for our son for the house; he was also extremely responsive to the many questions I had. He also left great instructions in the home. 

The house itself is very comfortable and charming--we particularly enjoyed the common areas. 

The kitchen in the house is also excellent. Alex has it stocked with great kitchen equipment and wonderful coffee making supplies as well. 

One of the best things about the rental is the neighborhood. There is a nice zoo just a block up the street with a playground right across the street, coffee shops within walking distance, and great views all around. The neighborhood is also very quiet. 

The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is that the stairs leading down to the second bedroom are very steep and might not be safe for all guests. For example, I did not feel safe carrying my baby up the stairs. 

"
9374358,54218269,2015-11-16,38293205,Andrea,"This was our best AirBnB experience yet! 

The studio is nicely decorated, spacious and comfortable. Parking in downtown Seattle is expensive so having a space right across the street was incredibly convenient. Nick was very responsive and made sure we had everything we needed. There is a laundry room which was an unexpected plus after our evening of oysters. Although we weren't planning on watching TV, we were glad to be able to catch the Seahawks game on cable.

The building is very quiet - populated by young professionals, as described in the ad. The studio is on the ground floor and there is some road noise in the morning and at night, but I was fine with earplugs.

Pike Place market is just a short walk away and there is a Kress IGA pretty close. 

All in all, we had a great experience and highly recommend this space for Seattle travelers. "
9374358,54471770,2015-11-20,36054201,Heather,"Sharayah made sure her boyfriend was there to greet us at the time we had agreed upon. He was super polite and made sure everything was taken care of for us. We felt very welcome and he was more than happy to provide us with information about the neighborhood. It was super convenient to have a parking spot included in our stay!

Sharayah followed up later that day with a phone call to make sure things were going well. They were very wonderful people and I highly recommend staying here, especially if you are wanting to be within walking distance of downtown Seattle. She even let us check out a little later than we had planned, since we had a tour that ran later than expected.

Thank you for being so welcoming and flexible!! "
9374358,54824617,2015-11-23,26764690,Mark,"A fantastic apartment in the heart of Seattle won't disappoint. The hosts are helpful and friendly and the premises is clean, convenient and cozy. This was one of the best finds of our entire trip. "
9374358,55830671,2015-12-06,5692641,Diego,"Clean and comfortable place in an amazing location. Easy walk to Convention Center, Pike Market and Monorail. Nice view of Space Needle from the entrance! Really convenient parking spot. Good dining places in the same block. The hosts were attentive and helpful, and flexible with our check-in and check-out times. Would definitely stay here again. "
9374358,56334383,2015-12-12,49496891,Priscilla,"Sharayah's place was perfect for my trip, super cozy space with everything you need to feel at home. Centrally located to food and nightlife. Will definitely recommend to anyone visiting. Thanks Sharayah!"
9374358,57255525,2015-12-23,6216253,Rocío,"The studio is a great place to stay! It's excellently located, just few minutes from Pike's market, and few minutes from the Needle. There's a small supermarket 2 doors away in case of need, and the parking is super easy to access. The suite's kitchen has anything you need to make breakfast, and everything was perfectly clean and in place when we arrived. A thing that we appreciated was the wifi, which was reliable and strong. 
Although we didn't get to meet Sharayah, she left us clear instructions of how to access the suite, and her husband was available in case of need -- very nice people both. We'd stay here again and recommend it to everyone!"
5386937,26967799,2015-02-22,3609532,Ben,"My parents stayed the night at The Princeton and thoroughly enjoyed the apartment. Everything was clean and we felt very at home!

We learned that the unit has many unique features and attention to detail. The bed and couch seem to be brand new, and the kitchen is obviously recently remodeled.The place even has walk-in closets in both the bedroom and dining room, the latter of which includes a washer and dryer. Very convenient for us as we did need to do some laundry.

Getting in and out was a breeze, with no need to contact Alyssa for extra help. She provided us with great and easy instructions for gaining access to the building.

The internet was especially speedy, as apparently the building has fiber optic quality service.

The atmosphere of the building is cool and quiet and the location is central to the city."
5386937,27948594,2015-03-15,767386,Joan,"This apartment was perfect for a weekend trip visiting friends who live in the Capitol Hill area. There's tons to walk to from this location. Very close to bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and groceries. Didn't have a car, but the host provided a parking permit.  The apartment was comfortable and very clean, and had everything we needed! Electronic keypad entry meant no extra keys to keep track of and no need to coordinate arrival time with our host, which was convenient since we got in late.  I'll definitely stay here again if I'm back in the area.  "
5386937,28996213,2015-04-02,2890002,Jan,"We stayed at the Princeton Coop for a week and had a splendid time there! It's located in a beautiful and safe neighbourhood of Seattle with lots of restaurants, bars, cafés, shops, and grocery stores close by. There is a Trader Joe's and an organic supermarket two minutes away. Our hosts made our stay very comfortable and uncomplicated; they always responded to our inquiries very quickly and were very helpful with anything we needed. We would come back anytime and recommend the place highly."
5386937,29420919,2015-04-07,8140700,Curt,"A great place and a nice location. Close to supermarkets; restaurants; a great bakery; shops and nightlife for all nearby. Quiet and cute neighborhood. Downtown only 15-20min walk. Easy check in and out, and everything was as we expected. Clean and nice. Would totally stay again. 

Thanks!"
5386937,29694763,2015-04-11,158230,Mark,"I really enjoyed staying at the Princeton Cooperative. The hosts were responsive and helpful even offering to keep my bag while I was out prior to a late flight. The apartment itself is wonderful and as shown in the pictures. Comfortable bed, good kitchen / dining area and a nice clawfooted tub to relax in. Capital Hill is a great place to stay with lots of restaurants, shops and coffee. Easy access to downtown walking / cycling and to the rest of the city with public transportation. Highly recommended place to stay. I will certainly be back when next in Seattle."
5386937,30313367,2015-04-20,29538263,Andrew,The Princeton Coop was a charming apartment perfectly located for our needs in Capitol Hill.  The space was clean and ready for us when we arrived.  There was no need for us to contact our hosts as everything was as it should be.  
5386937,30523169,2015-04-23,2158894,Jake,"Fabulous place to stay in a quiet street of Capitol Hill. Super-easy communications and all-electronic access made check-in and check-out a breeze. Do note that there are several steep steps up from street level to the building, so plan your move-in accordingly. Apartment was clean and spacious. Normal footfalls and other noises from above, as befits an older building. Kitchen was ok equipped (I couldn't find any wine glasses), but I didn't cook on this trip. Host left street parking passes for each day, and parking within a block or two was no trouble. Would definitely stay here again."
5386937,31156597,2015-05-02,7938277,Hayley,"The Capitol Hill Apartment was only a short walk from some of my favorite Capitol Hill restaurants and bars. The pictures accurately illustrate the cleanliness and comfort this property has to offer. Would definitely recommend this apartment to friends and family if they were to stay in Seattle. Additionally the hosts provide temporary permits for parking which was definitely a plus! 
Thanks again!  "
5386937,31538247,2015-05-06,24881750,Lindsay,"We had a great time staying at the Princeton Cooperative during our 5 day vacation in Seattle. The apt was just as advertised in the pictures and was in a location convenient to fun shops and restaurants in capital hill. The other tenants in the coop were very friendly too. Very clean,nice, and well-organized air bnb experience. And we loved the bed! So comfy!"

We were not planning on having a car, but we ended up renting one so the parking permit provided was definitely a plus! Walking distance to a lot of restaurants, bars and cafes. Even close enough to walk to the market/downtown, if you dont mind a bit of a walk.  The host was very quick to respond to any questions. The unit has a well equipped kitchen and even a washer and dryer. Great place to book again."
5386937,33594474,2015-05-30,22920800,Pia,"Such a cute spot in a great location. Apartment is huge, comfortable, clean - wish we had more time there! Alyssa was super helpful leaving us parking permit and lots of literature about what to do and see in Seattle. "
5386937,33880811,2015-06-01,15852793,Leaza,"The rental was truly charming! We would absolutely come back and stay here again. Celebrating our anniversary, my husband and I were searching for a property that was near downtown. This was in a great location--plenty to do in the neighborhood and an easy drive to downtown. We brought our two babies, and there was ample space for all of us. Our two year old has asked to go back to our ""vacation home"" many times since! The host, Alyssa, was very prompt in answering our questions and offered some great ideas for things to do right in the neighborhood. The parking pass was also very helpful. We had a wonderful time!"
5386937,34166538,2015-06-05,33874155,Shane,Great place! Had all I needed and was really close to the busses I needed to catch. Would stay again :)

We stayed there because it was close to our daughter and son-in-law. We didn't need the parking passes that were left, but, it was a nice touch. We would stay here again!!!"
5386937,36069069,2015-06-24,36172221,Dipock,Had a wonderful stay in this apartment. Was just what we expected. Easy access and convenient parking. The location is great - within walking distance of several exceptional restaurants.
5386937,36381108,2015-06-28,31313322,Kristen,"My husband and I stayed several nights at the Princeton and had a GREAT time! The description of the place was spot on.  The pictures are exactly how the space appears.  It is an older building with tons of character that is well kept up and extremely clean.  A beautiful and comfortable vintage space with modern accommodations.  

Access to the apartment was so simple, we didn't have to worry about meeting anyone at a specific time to check in or out.  We easily had access in and out of the building when ever we wanted and never felt like we may disturb someone since it really was like a small community apartment building. 

The host was easily available through email and the AirBnB app and would respond quickly to any messages sent.

The area was the best we could have asked for.  The apartment is about a block away from restaurants and shops making for a quiet area right around the apartment.  Walk anymore than a block and you will find many options of restaurants and bars; the majority being small businesses with unique items to offer.  There is so much to explore with downtown being a few miles away (down the hill) and even more options if you have a car. 

Many options for tourist activities that are less than five miles away or the option to hang out like a local might.  This is the place to be if you want a taste of what it is like to actually live in Seattle.  "
5386937,36768848,2015-07-01,2623416,Gretchen & Andy,"Spacious and well-appointed place in
a great Capitol Hill location. Walking distance to everything you would need and right on the bus line to downtown. Cleaning service is used so place was very clean for our visit. Comfortable bed and place in bedroom for travel baby bed. Also, shade in bedroom gets room totally dark :) Would highly recommend!"
5386937,37693152,2015-07-09,17375010,Kelsey,"This apartment is in a great location. We really enjoyed walking around Capitol Hill. The apartment itself was clean and cozy. The hosts were extremely nice, helpful and easy to reach. We had one minor mishap with the air mattress that they quickly fixed and gave us a bottle of wine to make up for it. "
5386937,37960034,2015-07-12,20122435,Mark,Great location within walking distance of many shops and restaurants.
5386937,38597803,2015-07-17,7343735,Ryan,"A terrific experience. Comfortable apartment, very clean, host was prompt in answering questions. A great location too. Would recommend. "
5386937,39202823,2015-07-21,26331246,Christopher,"The apartment had a good amount of space and everything we needed. It was on the first floor but had plenty of light and was generally quiet in the back of the building.  It might be a bit close to the alley and neighboring buildings for people not used to city apartments, but we were comfortable. 

The parking passes were very helpful because Seattle has a complex parking system and somewhat of a parking shortage, but we were able to park within a few blocks each night. The neighborhood is also great for walking and close to many places we wanted to visit. 

Our host was very responsive and helpful.  We appreciate the chance to stay in a cleans and comfortable space!"
5386937,39304409,2015-07-22,6249882,Jonathan,"My only complaint about this place is that I only got to stay here for one night! I booked this accommodation for three people and found that it was still very comfortable. 

Very spacious apartment, very nicely decorated. And check in was easy with specific instructions given a week prior to travelling dates. 

The best thing about this apartment is the location. You walk on the street and turn left, bars, microbreweries, distilleries, restaurants, you turn right more of the same thing! Very hip area to be staying in that's for sure. You can also walk about 20-30 minutes into the downtown area.

There's also parking permit available for those who's driving in or renting cars. Be prepared to spend a bit of time driving around but you will find a parking spot. 

All in all very cozy and absolutely amazing location. Highly recommended to anyone visiting Seattle. "
5386937,39624377,2015-07-25,11418340,Eveline,"We had a wonderful stay in seattle! Great location, very clean and  cute appartement!!! Thank you..!"
5386937,39906269,2015-07-27,28396179,Chad & Liam,We had a great time.  The apartment was perfect! Nice and spacious. I would certainly stay there again on my next trip to Seattle.  
5386937,40922661,2015-08-03,16408993,Fred,"I couldn't have asked for a better spot to start my trip across America. It's very well laid out, very well equipped, clean and has been a joy to stay in. It's close enough to town to be no more than a 5 minute walk from the first bar or restaurant, but far enough away to be quiet. Pikes place market is a leisurely 20 minute walk, and the transport links to everywhere are close. 

Alyssa and her neighbour Nathan couldn't have been more helpful. Incredibly attentive, and genuinely only an email or call away. Although none of us met, I never feel alone. I'll definitely be coming back, and next time for longer. For anybody planning a trip to Seattle, this is the place you need to stay. "
5386937,41053863,2015-08-03,26850596,Kelsey,The host canceled this reservation 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5386937,41103161,2015-08-04,8596647,Nichole,"We had the best time! The Princeton is in the most perfect location. Its next to everthing that we love. Very clean and comfy apartment.  Lots of charm. Washer and Dryer, so rad! The pull out couch was glorious.  Such a good stay, wish we could have stayed longer! We visit Seattle once a month and this has been our favorite.  Nice job guys."
5386937,41403573,2015-08-07,33813604,Samuel,"This apartment is clean, tidy, and well located. It's also quiet and secure. It's roughly a mile from Pike Place Market, which is a decent walk. If you're into Starbucks, there's a really fancy one along the way. Everything is as advertised, and the washer/dryer is great for those who travel lightly. The only caveat is the age of the bathroom: though it is spotless, the old clawfoot bathtub can be a bit cumbersome for taking showers. That aside, I recommend this property for couples and small groups."
5386937,44654984,2015-08-28,10401218,Florian,"Très bon séjour passé à Capitol Hill, le quartier est super (très animé), il est très facile d'accéder au downtown (en bus 10min ou à pied 30min environ). L'accès à l'appartement est très pratique avec le code, pas besoin de clés. Les murs sont très fins donc il vaut mieux prévoir les bouchons d'oreilles la nuit. Je recommande vraiment cet appartement, qui a beaucoup de cachet"
5386937,44895074,2015-08-30,2731060,Carolyn,"Great location; easy walking distance to lots of great restaurants and transit. Apartment was spacious, bright and open, and very comfortable and clean. We immediately felt at home! "
5386937,45278423,2015-09-01,20221062,Kait,"Very cool apartment in a trendy neighborhood and I was actually able to find parking right in front of the building which was amazing! Super easy to walk to a lot of the main sights like Pike Place, space needle, etc and so many good places to eat around. The apartment was very clean and had everything I needed to feel comfortable, welcome, and at home. Definitely staying here again whenever I visit Seattle again."
5386937,49072248,2015-09-30,25171785,Jeff,"The apartment was clean and ultra-convenient to everything in Capitol Hill.  Quiet neighborhood.  I would stay here again when in the area.

5386937,49432977,2015-10-04,38117469,Kathleen,Cute and comfortable apartment!
5386937,49932465,2015-10-07,4233168,Kim,"Entry was easy and convenient. Apartment is located in a nice building in a safe, fun area in capital hill. Thanks!

5386937,50447131,2015-10-12,2504605,Sara,"Loved loved loved this place!  It was in a great location, comfortable, clean, just about everything you need to feel at home.  The decorations were quirky and beautiful, looks just like the pictures.  I would definitely stay here again for my next trip to Seattle :)"
5386937,50762028,2015-10-14,4974374,Tom,"Apartment was clean and well appointed. Great spot in the city, would stay again while in Seattle. "
5386937,51061275,2015-10-17,43819231,Linda,"Place was so lovely and in a great location! The parking permit provided was a plus. Alyssa, who has been in contact with me when I reserved the place for the weekend, even brought my boyfriend and I a portable heater because it was getting a bit chilly. Thank you, again! I had a great experience. "
5386937,52220191,2015-10-27,41673966,Shannon,"The place was pretty much as described.  It was cleaned before our arrival we were able to drop off our bags before check-in time, which was appreciated. Decent neighborhood, within walking distance of restaurants and super markets.  I never did meet my host.  It's an older building but has been updated. The unit is under the stairs so it's very noisy starting around 6 in the morning.  As long as your planning on getting up early, you will be fine.  "
5386937,52625496,2015-10-31,249723,Marianne,"The apartment was clean, comfortable, spacious and in a great location. The host was responsive to any issues and flexible in allowing us leave luggage since she had no other guest coming. A few downsides though – spotty internet, you won’t really want to open the shades because the windows are almost at ground level and the upstairs neighbors are sometimes very loud – once at 6 am. 


"
5386937,53130516,2015-11-05,46511337,Katie,"We had a great time staying here! Super cute apartment, cozy and well decorated. I wanted to move in. The location was perfect - close to some of the most popular bars and restaurants in Seattle. Our host was phenomenal. Very quick to respond and happy to offer recommendations. Couldn't be more pleased with our experience. "
5386937,55020572,2015-11-27,32618965,Colleen,"The apartment was very clean and looked exactly like in the pictures!  The area was great - really convenient to get around and lots of fun places nearby!  The building is old and the walls thin so you can hear the neighbors upstairs at times, but that was expected."
5386937,55159051,2015-11-28,49459668,Taehlor,This place was an excellent choice for our one night stay! It was very close to all the Cap Hill nightlife and very well kept. It was really pleasant and I would recommend it to anyone ! 
5386937,55835858,2015-12-06,5034708,Sherrie,"Very efficient system, excellent location. I would gladly stay there again. "
5386937,56447223,2015-12-13,1623722,Van,"The location can't be beat. Walkable to the Capitol Hill scene and near a convenient number of bus stops to get you wherever you need to go in Seattle. To echo the experience of previous guests, the walls are thin and the building is older so you'll hear neighbors and others running around. "
5386937,56866702,2015-12-19,14527618,Keith,"I stayed 4 nights in this charming, well-located apartment. I immediately felt as though I was at ""home"". The place has everything you need, including a fully kitted kitchen and a VERY comfortable bed. I truly appreciated the fact that a residential parking permit for my rental car was included in the deal, and the keyless entry system is very efficient. The other folks in the building made me feel very welcome. Five stars!"
5386937,57669845,2015-12-28,6323865,Christel,"The apartment was very charming and good for a week's stay. Location as mentioned in the description is very close to the busy Pike / Pine area of businesses (shops, restaurants, bars); also, very walkable to other parts of the city (under 2 miles to Pike Place market). Felt safe and the building / area was very quiet. The host had a parking permit and it wasn't too difficult to find a space close by. Alyssa was very communicative and accommodating. Would definitely stay here again."
5386937,57958425,2015-12-30,7914460,Danielle,"We had a fantastic stay! The apartment is very centrally located--easy to walk to many of the areas hot spots. The apartment itself was very clean, spacious and welcoming. The apartment building is extremely quite and safe. I needed to reach the host and she was very prompt in responding. Overall, a perfect trip."
5386937,58181382,2016-01-01,24387315,Sophie,"Lovely, cozy, and convenient! We could walk to so many great restaurants and bars and seemed to be a short drive to anything else in the city. We love Seattle and will definitely remember The Princeton on our next trip! So nice to stay in a place that feels like home-thanks!"
6528192,36692630,2015-06-30,15130650,Phoebe,Jennifer was a wonderful host! She is a very nice woman and is willing to chat and help you find your way around.  She gave me excellent advice of which shops to go to and informative on what types of things were in our close vicinity.  The listing was as described and is in a really great location! It's super easy to get downtown and the apartment is close to many other bus stops that make it really easy to get around town! I would highly recommend staying with Jennifer! She is very sweet and super welcoming.  Thank you :) 
6528192,38878969,2015-07-19,1523489,Casey,"I stayed at Jen's place in order to familiarize myself with the various Seattle neighborhoods while I started a new job and looked for an apartment of my own. The neighborhood felt quiet and residential but was very convenient to downtown and Capitol Hill on foot and U District one bus away. 

Jen was a great host and very knowledgable about the area. The apartment was cozy and the private room was large enough to accommodate several big suitcases I had stuffed into my car for the move. Plenty of closet space and clothes hangers. 

I couldn't have asked for a better temporary first home in Seattle. Thanks so much Jen! "
6528192,45098513,2015-08-31,4023544,Paul,"Jennifer is a super host with cats ;-)
The neighbourhood is very close to the nice Capitol Hill area and public transportation is super (also for your bike). The listing is well described and you are free to use the apartment, kitchen and bathroom. It is al together not very big, but the room is sufficiently big. It was a very nice week in Seattle and I rented a bike nearby. You'll need gear for the hills!"
6528192,45659473,2015-09-05,29820104,Carol,"Great location very near coffee, shops, small grocery, bus line. Comfortable. Very accomodating host."
6528192,46905843,2015-09-14,21358093,Charles,"Jenn was a great host.  My room was clean, comfortable, and ready for me when I arrived.  The neighborhood was conveniently located next to lots of restaurants and shopping.  Uber is very prevalent and I felt safe walking around the neighborhood after dark.  She was very knowledgeable about the area and pointed out some great places to grab some local goods and great meals, including a farmers market and a restaurant that her friend started.  Jenn was very friendly and went out of her way to make me feel comfortable in her home.  She has 2 cats, and as a cat person it was one of the reasons I chose her property for my stay in Seattle.  The cats were definitely curious and one of them was very friendly and loved playing and having her chin scratched.  I'd definitely stay with Jenn again in the future. "
6528192,47689900,2015-09-21,32347028,Ekaterina,"Jennifer is a friendly lady who loves to cook :} and lives in a small but  very cosy apartment.  Always  responded to messages. My stay was short, all I needed is a bed and was out most of the time. 
Cleanliness is guaranteed."
6528192,48268593,2015-09-25,395554,David,"Jennifer is a excellent host. I had great conversations with her, her cats are fun, and if she's making food and offers, take her up on that. Delicious.

The place is cosy and well located. An easy walk down Pike and Pine street, and close to downtown. Just easy all round."
6528192,49356628,2015-10-03,6005176,Jeremy,Jennifer was a welcoming host and the room suited my needs very well. 
6528192,49629601,2015-10-05,2293902,Garrett,"Space was as advertised, great location. Friendly and courteous host, I'd stay here again. "
6528192,50087254,2015-10-09,648763,Jim,"I had a great three-night stay w/ Jen, and her cats. She is very easy-going and interesting. Her kitties are as animated as I've seen.
   Great location for the money. Within a block are two major bus lines. So, getting in from SETAC was easy ($6-8)and an hour...vs $50 taxi. A bus to downtown sights is 15 minutes. Out to UW is ten minutes, etc. Within a few blocks of her flat are two recreational pot stores, a few cafes, an alternative/indie cinema, a beer garden, Ethiopian restaurants and one or two great BBQ rib joints. Within a 20 minute walk are a Trader Joe's. Safeway, an Seattle's Co-op organic store.
  The neighborhood doesn't look tops, per se, nor is her flat glamorous, but it's great value for money. She is a great hostess, and the neighborhood has lots going on if you look."
6528192,50684157,2015-10-13,44462403,Johny,"Jennifer is a great host. And her apartment is located in a nice area, close to everything!"
6528192,51935323,2015-10-25,17947804,Cristian,"Jen is a lovely host, very welcoming and nice. She's got some naughty cats always trying to get into the room where they are not allowed to.
Her place is at the top floor of a house in a very quiet neighbourhood. Nice stay."
6528192,52691186,2015-11-01,43013644,Keshia,"My boyfriend and I had an awesome time in Jennifer's space. I was heading down to Seattle to work and was going to be pulling some very later overnight shifts and she was very accommodating with my comings and goings at odd hours. As well at the last minuet when my boyfriend decided to join me she was more than welcoming to the both of us even though she feels the space is too small for 2 people and I had only booked for myself.
He space was gorgeous and the neighborhood was amazing. We live in East Vancouver, Canada and this area and her space felt just like home to us. 
Jennifer was super awesome about giving us our space but also was up for chatting and hanging out.
All and all we had an amazing weekend in a great area of town. "
6528192,53681864,2015-11-11,44014516,Andreana,"This listing was exactly what it described. The neighbourhood was quiet, yet close to bustling Capitol Hill amenities and across the street from a cannabis dispensary (for those interested, as it's legal in the state). Jennifer was incredibly thoughtful, kind and helpful when it came to places to check out for food and exploration. Her cats were delightful and very friendly (which was fun for us, as we had left a cat behind to travel). "
6528192,54033862,2015-11-15,6720976,Richard,"Thanks, Jen, for the great place: easy parking, friendly cats, good tea, easy access to restaurants, museums, and more. I loved my weekend in Seattle!"
6528192,54338859,2015-11-18,5792592,Andersen,"Had a fantastic time staying at Jennifer's Cozy Attic Apartment. Her cats are wonderful, curious, and friendly. The location is great and close to some small boutique coffeeshops, if that's your thing, and also a trader joe's. I really love Seattle and had a cozy stay here. Definitely recommend."
6528192,54457346,2015-11-20,28163200,Domenic & Saskia,"Jennifer ist ein großartiger Gastgeber, sehr nett und zuvorkommen, die Ankunft lief reibungslos ab, es war nur etwas schwierig den Eingang zu finden, da die Wohnung im Dachgeschoss liegt. Das Apartment selbst war durchschnittlich was Sauberkeit (wobei hier eher unter dem Durchschnitt), Lage und sonstige allgemeine Aspekte anbelangt, es ist ein altes Haus und ganz ehrlich gesagt etwas heruntergekommen, chaotisch und um diese Jahreszeit sehr kalt. Mit Jennifer leben drei Katzen, die etwas nervig sein können da sie oft versuchen in den Raum zu kommen. Alles in allem war mein Aufenthalt in Ordnung, ich habe jedoch nicht viel Zeit dort verbracht, lediglich zum schlafen."
6528192,54852825,2015-11-25,43305405,Lars,"Jennifer is a great host, friendly, open, even shared some dinner. She alway responded to messages 
The apartment is cosy and authentic, the house is in a quiet neighbourhood, but not too far away from interesting places and (most of) the cats are friendly, curious and playful.
I had a great stay at the apartment. "
6344566,32220522,2015-05-15,28892687,Eric,The room was absolutely spotless and in a great location! We had a lovely little stay here. Charlotte was helpful and provided very detailed instructions for getting in. This helped accommodate our late check in time.
6344566,32859391,2015-05-22,8917764,Lori,"This place was great!  It was clean, easily accessible, centrally located, felt very safe.  Charlotte was a terrific resource, answering questions prior to reservation and prompt!  The bed was wonderfully comfortable.  The apartment surprisingly quiet (right downtown).  

Neighbors were friendly and helpful."
6344566,33303018,2015-05-26,33075482,Kevin,"The apartment met all of our expectations: clean, safe, and central location. The apartment looked as was described with all the items one would need for a long weekend in Seattle. We never felt any reason to feel unsafe in a part of the city where most other common  hotels are located. It was a perfect location for walking anywhere, being within a mile of many key sites and restaurants that we had prior reservations and tickets for. 

I will definitely be staying here again on my next trip to Seattle."
6344566,34153159,2015-06-05,33682613,Michelle,"The location for this apartment is great! It's right up from the Link train station and close to Pike's Market. The building is very secure and quiet. Of course, you're downtown, so some street noise is to be expected.  I will definitely be staying here when I come back to Seattle."
6344566,34261744,2015-06-06,31627138,Kent,"I booked this space with very little notice and Charlotte was very accommodating insuring it was clean and ready for my stay. The apartment was very nice, tasteful and conveniently located. I highly recommend this place. "

I love it"
6344566,35312376,2015-06-17,25542919,Zach,"I had a great time at this apartment. It was clean, comfortable and in a wonderful location. The directions to get the keys and enter the apartment were easy. I could not believe how close the apartment was to all of the top sites in Seattle. For one person, this apartment was a perfect place to relax, enjoy the city, and have a private place. I highly recommend this apartment to anyone visiting Seattle.  "
6344566,35497948,2015-06-19,33911442,Daniel,Great location downtown right by the light rail near the market. Apt was clean and exactly what we expected.
6344566,35705543,2015-06-21,8904528,Jason,Really enjoyed my stay here.  The apartment was exceptionally clean and exactly as pictured and described.  Access was simple and the location is great for exploring downtown Seattle.
6344566,36309756,2015-06-27,33812845,Carey,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay here. The condo was clean and conveniently located to attractions. It is also located right next to light rail and bus access. However, you can walk to most locations right from the building. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone traveling to Seattle. "
6344566,36837843,2015-07-01,17149974,E,This apartment is gorgeous – very modern and a fantastic location in downtown Seattle. Very close to public transportation and in the middle of the city – lots of shops and restaurants nearby. 
6344566,37212530,2015-07-05,11941445,Christopher,"Easy to find, very easy to get key and gain entry.

Apartment is exactly as described and immaculately clean upon arrival.  We had no problems with noise or traffic below.

Location cannot be beat.  

Kitchen has everything you need to make a meal, if you want to take a break from eating out every night.  

Wife had spent the previous two weeks in Hong Kong so having a w/d in the unit was more than appreciated.

All-in-all, it was a terrific experience.  Would, and probably will, stay here again on our next trip."
6344566,37796874,2015-07-10,34070780,Paige,This place was a great location and totally convenient for my husband and I to really check out the heart of downtown seattle. We would stay again for sure! 
6344566,37937635,2015-07-11,6606380,Casey,"The apartment was nice and clean. It was exactly as pictured. The couch was a bit uncomfortable to sleep on but the bed was great.

I took the light rail from the airport and it dropped me off right next to the apartment (for only $3). The system to check-in/out was very easy and allows for timing to be flexible.

Overall, it was a great stay for 1 night."
6344566,38080124,2015-07-12,37929729,Bryan,"Charlotte's listing and apartment accommodations were great. The studio was exactly what I was anticipating. Also, Charlotte allowed me to drop my bags off before check in. Great spot.  "
6344566,38536155,2015-07-16,37138235,Krista,This was a great studio apartment in the downtown area. The location is just about perfect. Very close to the Pike Place and a lot of the tourist hot spots. Great restaurants are literally right next door. The Purple Cafe & Wine Bar was fantastic. I really enjoyed this location and the apartment was in pristine condition. Very pleased with my stay and would recommend for someone exploring the area. 
6344566,38655192,2015-07-17,37786767,Steve,"Great location, easy access, clean and updated space. Charlotte made the experience easy and stress-free by her responsiveness to questions. Would absolutely book this unit again in the future. "
6344566,38805706,2015-07-18,13829415,Brandon,"The Listing was exactly as described. It is right downtown, easy 5 min walk to Pikes Place. There are tons of great restaurants nearby and the light rail from the airport literally drops you off a half block from the listing. The listing itself is spotless and has everything you can need. The check-in was simple and easy, overall great experience. 
"
6344566,39248821,2015-07-21,20915182,Silvia,"Very comfortable appt in downtown Seattle. 10min walk from EVERYTHING.
The appt is a mini loft with the perfect amenities: very comfortable king bed, huge fridge, full kitchen and great view. Internet was amazingly fast and had on demand HDTV as well.
Did not meet Charlotte in person but getting in was easy. You get a few instructions to get in the first time, but they are clear to follow.
Pictures reflect the appt as it is: incredibly clean and neat.
Would stay here again."
6344566,39768778,2015-07-26,31830808,Stephanie,"The listing was absolutely accurate.  The place is great.  The studio style apartment was big enough for our needs and it was nice to have the big fridge to store our drinks and leftover food.  The apartment was immaculately cleaned and had all the amenities you'd expect of a hotel.  

The locations was the BEST part of this listing.  3 blocks from pikes place, 3 blocks from westlake center, 0.5 blocks from the University Link Light Rail Station and 4-6 blocks from pioneer square.  You can walk to nearly everything!  It was a delight staying at such a convenient location that was clean and classy.  If you rent a car, there's even an easy and accessible place to park it during your stay.  Loved it!"
6344566,40497801,2015-07-31,1809814,Ted,"Charlotte's place was beautiful, in a great location. Easy to check in and check out, too!"
6344566,41026750,2015-08-03,39246703,Chris,"Charlotte was very responsive with all of my questions, and the unit was just as described in the photos. The check-in/check-out process was also a breeze. I will definitely be staying here again next time I am in Seattle!"
6344566,41362734,2015-08-07,35291259,Michael,Great location and host! Charlotte was responsive and helpful when I had questions. The apartment is in a great location in downtown Seattle and was very clean and well maintained. I definitely recommend it!
6344566,42194412,2015-08-11,12434707,Signe,Great place to stay. Perfect location for our business trip to Seattle. Would stay there again.
6344566,42535071,2015-08-14,35665912,Mike,"Our first AirBnB experience was great.  Responsive host, accurate descriptions, clean and perfect location!  Light rail at University Station is very close for those without cars."
6344566,43334068,2015-08-18,15936411,Ed,Charlottes place was perfect for my stay in Seattle.  She communicated clearly and was very gracious. 
6344566,43824423,2015-08-22,12901288,Rita,"Very good location. Small and sweet studio, I love it! It is clean and tidy, very comfortable. "
6344566,44272988,2015-08-24,27712194,Patrick,Perfect
6344566,44702002,2015-08-28,41470435,Anne,"This was a perfect location for anyone spending time downtown.  Walkable to all downtown neighborhoods, restaurants etc.  The place was extremely clean, comfortable and instructions for getting in were easy to follow."
6344566,44935891,2015-08-30,24845721,Mike,"Charlotte did a great job with all aspects of this listing, from check-in to check-out and everything in between. The description of the residence was quite accurate, and communication was excellent.

Of course the neighborhood is great, with numerous food and coffee options, and naturally the Pike Place Market was a fun tourist stop.

My stay was fantastic. Thank you very much."
6344566,45193206,2015-08-31,1655398,Ines,"Absolutely great location near Pike Place and the Seattle Art Museum. Very clean and comfortable, and the attached public garage comes in handy for those with cars. Charlotte is also quick to respond to messages and very communicative!"
6344566,45618005,2015-09-04,42539887,Susan,"The studio was very nice, clean and just as described. Getting into the apartment is a little complicated, but we were given excellent, detailed instructions and had no problem.  The location is perfect for walking to all parts of downtown. There was a parking garage beneath and the building is very secure. Only downside was lots of emergency sirens all night."
6344566,45734883,2015-09-05,63221,Matthew,Had a great date night with my wife in this perfect apt in Downtown Seattle.  Had all the amenities we needed and was very comfortable.  I would recommend it to everyone for a little getaway downtown
6344566,46726880,2015-09-13,24289304,Gwendolyn,"My husband and I stayed here for a few days last weekend and it was the perfect place for a short stay in Seattle. Clean, awesome windows, and great walking distance to so many things.  Would stay here again!"
6344566,47135949,2015-09-15,44105038,John,"This property was just as described.  Clean and very well kept.  We loved it!  It was so easy to walk to Pike Place Market, Restaurants, groceries, etc.  I can see how some might find the initial access through the garage a bit confusing, but that's just it, it was only for the initial access with luggage and all.  After that, you can easily come and go through the front door.  Honestly, we found it all a bit ""James Bond-ish"".  You'll understand if you rent this great place.  Thanks again to our great hosts who were easily reachable for questions."
6344566,47328557,2015-09-17,44121818,Elise,Great space! Walking distance to everything we wanted. House was clean and quiet. Loved it. 
6344566,47543688,2015-09-20,37836296,Ryan,Great location! Clean place! Just what we wanted. 
6344566,47876631,2015-09-21,4332183,Bill,"Thorough, specific communication re: keys, location, procedures. Great location. Clean place with nice view. Place was exactly as described."
6344566,48053262,2015-09-22,44627759,Rebecca,"I did not get to meet Charlotte but she responded to my request within an hour and was very courteous and helpful throughout the duration of my visit, directing me where I could park and was super understanding regarding being late for checkout as I was worried I would not be able to make it in time for check out as I was in the city for some job interviews with some local companies. She was very kind and wished me luck! The apartment itself was very clean, had all the amenities I needed. I actually enjoyed the view, sure you may hear some sirens at night but when you're downtown in a busy city such as Seattle you have to expect that. IT IS FASTER THAN CHECK IN AT A HOTEL.  Getting in to the building was not hard, Charlotte's instructions are pretty straightforward. However the only struggle I had was finding  the key, but only because Google Maps had me go behind the street where I needed to... so keep that in mind if you're using google maps to find the location. The location of the apartment itself is great and is within walking distance of shopping, bars and groceries (if you want to have a romantic meal inside). The bathroom Clairols Herbal Essence Shampoo & Conditioner (the blue bottle coconut scent one) and soap, Q-tips, and sanitary items. In summary, this truly is a luxury apartment and I would definitely have this be my first choice for a trip to Seattle."
6344566,48233356,2015-09-24,34067978,Jim,Great neighborhood.  I liked the space and the instructions were impeccable.  I had no problem accessing the space at all.  
6344566,48557048,2015-09-27,14124877,Mike,"Great, easy, safe, comfortable stay. Location was perfect for seeing the sights. My wife and I visited for our 10yr wedding anniversary and had an amazing time. When we make it back to the nw, this will def be where we stay again. "
6344566,49017003,2015-09-30,4104353,Brett,Great apartment in a very nice building. Centrally located with easy access to everything. The apartment was as described and you're able to arrive at any time.
6344566,49257396,2015-10-02,1107092,Joslyn,"This studio was ideal for me: easy check in/out for a quick trip, convenient downtown location, central to Link and my conference, and some extra space and kitchen that indeed make it more luxurious than any hotel room.  Charlotte was a great virtual host too. Responsive and informative.  If I'm in Seattle for a similar situation, I would definitely stay here again."
6344566,49881366,2015-10-07,5108233,Robert,This place is fantastic. Extremely clean and well decorated. It is small and quaint and in the middle of everything. We walked everywhere. The check-in and check-out process was perfectly smooth. And communications with Charlotte were prompt and detailed and friendly. She is very accommodating.  I highly recommend this very nice place!!
6344566,50277327,2015-10-11,17147822,Vanessa,"The apartment was just as shown! Great location and an easy walk up to Capitol Hill, Pioneer Square or to Pike Place Market! The apartment itself was very clean and she provided clean towels as well..which really helped us in lightening our load while packing! It was also nice to have access to a full-sized kitchen for cooking things fresh from the market.  "
6344566,50607714,2015-10-12,24845867,David,"The studio is centrally located, very well-kept and clean.  The check-in/out process is very streamlined with detailed instructions.

The building interior is very new, but I think because the exterior is preserving a historic look, the windows are of an older style so street noise does come in.  It did not bother us, but just note that it's not like a typical new high-rise where the interior is near-silent.

Parking is $35/day at the building; street parking is extremely limited in this part of downtown.

If you want a hotel-like, hassle-free experience, then this is it."
6344566,51528555,2015-10-21,15768955,Ronald,"Amazing apartment in downtown Seattle.  Description/pictures were accurate.  Great communication with host prior to arrival.  Easy check-in and check-out.  No need for a car, as public transportation is close by and easy to use.  I would highly recommend this property and host.  "
6344566,51800306,2015-10-24,29594188,Jessica,Nice place ! comfy bed. 
6344566,52481581,2015-10-30,213452,Robert,"Well, upon arrival the place was a total mess - dirty sheets and towels, stuff tossed around the room, dirty dishes, etc.  The host was gracious, though, and it appears that their cleaning schedule was messed up that day.  But the host did make good and the rest of the stay was very nice.  The location can't be beat if you want to walk around the retail part of the city and the waterfront markets.  It is a very secure building too, with mostly professionals living there.  I would stay again - but only if the place is clean when I arrive."
6344566,52801325,2015-11-01,31922960,Michelle,"Our stay at Charlottes downtown Seattle apartment was excellent. From start to finish Charlotte was super attentive making sure my boyfriend and I had everything we needed for a satisfying stay. Once we got there the stay was just as great. A very comfortable, and beautiful spot in a fantastic location in downtown Seattle. We had the perfect staycation! I would 100% recommend this spot to anyone of my friends and family. "
6344566,53073963,2015-11-04,46904900,Michael,"We really enjoyed staying in this studio apartment in the heart of downtown- it's located within steps of the University link rail stop, and is walking distance to Pike Place, Pioneer Square and Seattle Center. Charlotte was very helpful and gave precise instructions for accessing the apartment. The unit was clean and had useful amenities including a refrigerator, microwave, stove, washing machine and dryer. Highly recommended for a short stay in downtown Seattle."
6344566,53166475,2015-11-05,24302620,Jacqueline,"The check-in/out experience was seamless. The location was perfect one block from the train from the airport. I had a wonderful stay, and everything was to my liking."
6344566,53324332,2015-11-08,40989137,Shereen,Charlotte was a wonderful host and the luxury apartment in the heart of downtown Seattle was perfect for our weekend stay. It was very clean and spacious and in short walking distance to many of Seattle's top destinations. There were great options for food and drinks in the area and I would highly recommend staying here to get the full Seattle experience! 
6344566,53830533,2015-11-13,9942815,Ryan,"Exactly as advertised. Charlotte was very responsive, the location was great and the apartment was very well maintained. If you are looking for a hotel experience in your Airbnb this is the place. "
6344566,54000836,2015-11-15,37443924,Sylvia,"This place was very nice and clean. It was spotless and well-kept. It is located in a nice area, a very centralized location. It is about a 10 minute walk from Pike's Place. Additionally, it is right above the light rail station, which is a huge added bonus! Only things I didn't like were: 1. noise level- windows are paper-thin; they let in all the noise and is especially noticeable during the night and 2. you have to be discreet about the place, which made me feel a little uncomfortable."
6344566,54362192,2015-11-18,5273694,Leah,"The location is near everything downtown. Great area and cool view. It was a clean and chic apartment and it was in a lovely historical building. If you have a car, be ready to spend a lot of money on parking, $35 a day. "
6344566,54845270,2015-11-25,41408646,John,Great spot - it was very clean and was within walking distance to many of the places I wanted to visit. Free wifi and netflix was a nice bonus too. Located on the same block as the light rail stop which got me from the airport in 30 mins for $3.
6344566,55043632,2015-11-27,39425356,Nanyu,"Charlotte's apt is awesome, all the stuff in home is good and even prepare some tableware. So kind. If next time I go to Seattle again, I will definitely choose this apt again. "
6344566,55351776,2015-12-01,8479427,Thom,"Excellent communication by the host. Explicit directions of how to get there and get in. 

Immaculate unit. Clean, well appointed and in an amazing location."
6344566,55666220,2015-12-04,35735332,Janet,Charlotte is an excellent host who provides clear instructions and impeccable lodging. Thanks again. 
6344566,56217090,2015-12-10,22883855,Lindsey,"Charlotte's place was perfect for a quick Seattle stay, and it was exactly as described in the info and comments. Initially, I was a bit concerned about the arrival instructions - they did seem complicated, but they are spot on, and I the building was easily accessible and very clean. I would definitely stay here again!"
6344566,56647982,2015-12-15,34481587,John,"Great place to stay in downtown Seattle. If you have the chance book this place. Super clean large bed, laundry, full kitchen and great view of downtown Seattle. Easy walking distance to downtown, Pike Market & Capital Hill."
6344566,56750797,2015-12-17,26586416,Rae,"The host was extremely easy to get ahold of. They left an umbrella, coffee, toiletries and made the apartment feel extremely comfortable. "
6344566,57101074,2015-12-21,29036274,Wendy,"The apartment was just as described, very clean and centrally located. She provides clear and concise instructions which were of great help. No negative feedback!"
3773700,17712000,2014-08-16,19332909,Aaron,"My family had a wonderful stay at Lisa's house--close proximity to restaurants and the UW.   We walked to dinner more than once with two young kids.    The house is very well appointed and Lisa really made us feel welcome and handled all the ""little stuff"" like a (website hidden) room was very comfortable and nice for the whole family to gather around at night. Gigi the cat is absolutely adorable and I resisted the strong urge to borrow her when we departed:)
Do yourself a favor and stay here on your next visit to Seattle, you wont be disappointed!"
3773700,23403828,2014-11-30,23906639,Ken,My family and I got to spend Thanksgiving with our daughter attending U of W thanks to Lisa. We had a wonderful experience and would love to stay here again. It is a very charming house located in a cool neighborhood. Its close to the U and Greenlake and all the wonderful things that come with that. Thank you Lisa!
3773700,37616230,2015-07-08,37260578,Jialin,"This is my first experience with Airbnb and it worked out fantastic!!! It really feels like home living in a house that is delicately renovated and fully equipped. And especially for family travelling with young kid, nothing is sweeter than having a full kitchen and (amazingly) a separate bedroom for the little one!! The very thoughtful host Lisa also provided enough supplies which are almost comparable to what a hotel would normally provide. On top of these, Lisa is very responsive and proactively follows up on us to make sure we have a smooth lodging experience. Hope we could still live in this cute house next time we come to Seattle! "
3773700,41833840,2015-08-09,8274429,Lara,This place was big and and homely. The outdoor deck was beautiful and it was in a great area. We had a lovely time.
3773700,42427932,2015-08-13,1513251,Erika,We had an incredible stay at Lisa's Wallingford home.  The location was perfect for our trip to Seattle.  Central to drive anywhere yet we could walk to so many fantastic coffee shops and restaurants.   We traveled with our 1.5 year old.  Lisa's home was set up to accommodate us.  She had toys books and a perfect baby's room.   Traveling with a baby is hard and Lisa's place is truly a home.  It made all the difference in our daughter feeling rested and making the most of our trip. We will be back to stay again I'm sure of it ! 
3773700,46195528,2015-09-08,4703931,Moira,Wonderful house.  Great location very central and comfortable.  Gigi was a such a sweetheart.
9797000,56348861,2015-12-12,50760820,Rebecca,"Excellent stay!

Lovely room and kitchenette arrangement for someone or a couple looking for a nice place to stay close to downtown Seattle. 

The owners are kind, courteous, and helpful. The room is clean and spacious with room to relax. "
9797000,58194103,2016-01-01,6670896,Helen,"Abigail and Justin were extremely welcoming. Although they had made previous arrangements to be away for part of the Holidays, they left their numbers and the name and number of friends who would come if needed. Not needed.  They supplied generous goodies for our breakfasts They were also happy to allow us to have a small family party which was ideal because my grandson had room to play with his toys. There were some small difficulties, like dealing with the futon. Justin came and helped us.  The location is excellent, not far from Columbia City (yummy eats) and very convenient to the light rail. All in all an excellent value."
6575380,43889734,2015-08-22,11216884,Dana,Thank you for the last minute help! My friends had an excellent stay and LOVE your location in the hart of Queen Anne. 
6575380,44080582,2015-08-23,42052080,Emily,"My husband and I had a wonderful time staying with Sam and her family in Queen Anne in Seattle. The bedroom, bathroom, and lounge area were all very comfortable and clean, and the location was excellent! Queen Anne is a quaint, quieter neighborhood that is still extremely accessible to downtown Seattle.  I would highly recommend staying here and would certainly stay here again myself!"
6575380,45181212,2015-08-31,15220326,Jake,"Sam did an excellent job of communicating before and during our stay (and gave some great suggestions for our time in Seattle). The space was a very comfortable, and located in a nice, quiet neighborhood walking distance (1-2 miles) from the downtown area. It should be noted that this seemed to be a very residential area, so it seemed like you would be headed elsewhere for restaurants, bars, sites, and/or nightlife.  Washer/Dryer access was a nice touch after a week on the road. "
6575380,46196199,2015-09-08,41678242,Emily,"Such a great house in a wonderful neighborhood! 

The location: Close to everything touristy, but still in the quiet of a residential neighborhood. My husband and I didn't have a car and we either walked or took a really cheap Uber ride to the science center, EMP Museum, space needle, Pike Place Market, and pier (boat tour, aquarium, Ferris wheel). There are also great places to eat that are all very close (5 minute walk), like The 5 Spot and Queen Anne Cafe. 

The space: So much room and windows for a basement! If I had been blindfolded and placed in this space, I wouldn't even know it was a basement. One thing left out of the pictures is the full bathroom and it is very nice. Well lit, plenty of towels, huge shower, and a variety of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash to choose from. The bedroom and bathroom also have their own temperature controls for heating. It was a little chilly at night so this was an exceptional feature. We didn't use the washer or dryer because we were only there for the weekend. The bed was comfortable and we slept very well. Although we didn't use it much, the TV and couch in the  main room were a great amenities. The couch was roomy and relaxing and the TV was huge! It was overall, very clean and very quiet for being a basement. All you can hear is the occasional footsteps from above.

The host: As it says on the page, Sam really was flexible with check-in/out times, and I appreciated that. Instructions were clear. I didn't meet Sam in person, but she was good in communicating via the airbnb messaging. The only thing I had to ask for was an iron and ironing board which her son was very helpful in getting for us. "
6575380,47091476,2015-09-15,42649880,Rick,  The host was very helpful as I told her we would be coming in about noon and leaving for lunch right away.  She gave me many places to check out to eat lunch at.  We will be back to stay at this Airbnb again.
6575380,47184309,2015-09-16,31740518,Alex,"Sam's place was fantastic for our one night stay - the place was spotless and the area was great too, very close to downtown Seattle. Sam was communicative and very accommodating, and if I was coming back to Seattle I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again, definitely worth the money."
6575380,47328878,2015-09-17,16442513,Francois,Sam had a very beautiful house on Queen Anne. The basement where we stayed was clean and very convenient. We would love to come back again.

9448215,56349855,2015-12-12,6101202,Andre,"Savannah was a great host - she welcomed me and showed me around her place, gave me WiFi access and told me about the neighborhood. Thank you for a pleasant stay :)"
3884805,55313997,2015-11-29,3821779,Michelle,"Zachary and Angela are the most incredible hosts. I can't speak highly enough about these two and our stay here. Let's break it down:

1/ Cozy, comfortable space: there's warm lighting, comfy furniture, a soothing record player, and a homey feel.
2/ Unique, artsy vibe: art and photography covers the place. I loved the decor. Not a single corner left me bored, there were so many charming details all over their place. You could really feel the personality of the hosts come out through their stuff.
3/ A personalized experience: Angela left adorable little notes all over her house (e.g., explaining how her faucet worked or welcoming us). Really felt welcome.
4/ The nicest hosts: finally, Zachary and Angela were so understanding and flexible. My friends and I were touched by how accommodating they were to our needs. These are two awesome hosts. I wasn't sure if I was more sad about saying goodbye to their space or if I was more sad that I couldn't grab a beer with them.

Literally, this place rules. But, in the interest of providing as accurate of a review as possible, here are the drawbacks:
1/ Parking around here is pretty impossible. Honestly, that's expected in an area as hopping as Capitol Hill, but just throwing it out there.
2/ There aren't curtains in some of the windows, so bring a sleep mask if you're sensitive to light! This didn't bother me, but my friends noticed it.

Again, these are nitpicks. Look at the space. There are plants! There are mannequins! There are dope photographs! Stay here!"
7510776,41007519,2015-08-03,13793886,Sheree,Very nice loft style apartment. Beautiful views of waterfront. Easy walk to everything. Hosts very attentive. 
7510776,41842480,2015-08-09,16549053,Tiffany,"Love the detailed instructions that I got upon reservation confirmation!  Covered a lot of questions that I might've had about the area, what sort of resources I could use, etc.  Very helpful! 

Morgan made me feel very welcome, and was super accommodating of my flight delays!  My flight was originally supposed to arrive around 10PM, but got delayed 2 hours, so I didn't arrive at the location until around midnight, but Morgan still wanted to personally check me into the unit, and even left me some snacks and a yummy bottle of wine!

The unit itself was very nice and cozy (quite new too), and comfortably furnished.  The kitchen bar could use a few more items, such as a pitcher (maybe a Brita?) or something for making/holding drinking water, but otherwise, there wasn't anything else that I wanted to use that wasn't already provided.  I did struggle with the Smart TV a bit, mostly b/c the Apple TV wasn't connecting to my Mac laptop, but I was still able to pass some time by watching Netflix via the Smart TV.  (Maybe add a Chromecast in the future as well?)

The building was right by the waterfront, and quite close to a lot of shops, eats, etc.  Pike's Place is a couple (felt like a 10 min walk or so) of blocks away from the location, which was great.  If you're a walking kind of person, you could definitely make a slightly longer trek (1+ miles) and get to Belltown, the Seattle Center (aka where the Space Needle is), etc."
7510776,42750224,2015-08-15,8612870,Salvador,"Morgan is a superstar host. Very prompt & professional with a clear and precise communication style. We are highly appreciative of her gracious personality and her knowledge and recommendations. The apartment is absolutely fabulous and has stylistic decor throughout. The locations is exceptional, within walking distance to everything that is great in downtown Seattle. It is a great place to retreat and relax!"
7510776,44688799,2015-08-28,14295067,Mike,"Morgan was very helpful and responsive during the check-in process and stay. Apartment is beautiful, cool and modern. Super comfy bed, huge TV and an awesome roof top deck with amazing views looking west over the Sound! Location was great since I was working downtown / pioneer square. Would definitely stay here again."
7510776,45845660,2015-09-06,314739,Venessa,"I can give enough positive for this Airbnb! Morgan was easy to communicate with.  Flexible.  Nice and very accommodating. I was familiar with Seattle and really wanted to find a place to stay close to Pike's Place.  This AIRBNB could not have been in a better location.  There is a public bike sharing station 1 block away, which was really fun.  We were able to walk and bike to Pike Place, walk and bike to Belltown, walk and bike to Capital Hill... we walked to a Sounders Game.  Just on an on and on!  The apartment itself was immaculate.  So so clean.  Quiet. (which is a must for me)  It had a washer and dryer in the unit which was great.  I loved being able to work out in the onsite gym and grab coffee every morning at the onsite cafe. The bed was super comfortable - the rooftop view was amazing, I mean literally I'm sad to be back to my home.  lol  You can't go wrong with this rental!"
7510776,47391021,2015-09-18,3106238,Saira,"I always LOVE staying at their place, they are the perfect hosts.  Awesome apt., check-in/out is very easy--all around A+.  Thanks!!  See you again soon."
7510776,48793981,2015-09-28,8579662,Song,"every thing was perfect. clean and spacious room, nice location, packed with basic supplies, big television with Apple TV! and Daniela always reply me immediately. here a little bit pricey but it worth enough."
7510776,49708857,2015-10-05,13907898,Eugenio,"The host did a great job throughout--before and during the stay.  Plenty of info on the check-in, on the apartment, on the location.  The apartment is nice, and I found everything in great conditions when i got there ...and the bottle of wine as a welcome gift was the icing on the cake!  "
7510776,50147616,2015-10-09,4346130,Shannon,Daniela & Michael are terrific hosts. This is the second brand new apt they own that I've stayed in. I loved the layout and there's simply nothing not to love with being new. It had a great layout. 
6119821,32598299,2015-05-19,4971317,Nicola,"Proud to be one of the first to feedback this marvellous hostel.
From here you can reach everything in Seattle just by walking. It's in front of the famous pike place market, and downtown is just a few blocks. The hostel and the bathrooms are very clean. If I'll come back in Seattle, then I'll definitely stay in this hostel again."
6119821,34872436,2015-06-13,3630696,Bryon,"Wonderful stay, easy check-in and check-out. AWESOME bathrooms with new showers and great finishes. Good amount of privacy in the rooms. Great breakfast options and social activities for those interested. "
6119821,36112559,2015-06-25,5202628,Maggie,"This hostel was great. Staff were all really helpful as friendly. Good vibes as soon as I came up the stairs! Even had a slight booking issue they cleared up immediately. Met some rad people on the pub crawl. The hostel is actually literally across the street from Pike Market so you're downtown and it's super easy to walk/ bus to wherever you want to go. The rooms were perfect. All the stuff I needed: soft place to land, secure lock up for my duffle, outlet to charge my phone, and light to read by. The bathrooms were great too, epic shower! Wish I had stayed longer so I could have done more of the events they put on. Oh also, discounted tickets for stuff like Emp. Overall, great experience. Thank you thank you!"
6119821,37062635,2015-07-04,33456798,Marie-Chantal,Thank you for an amazing stay !
6119821,46231779,2015-09-08,14269091,Li,"Great location, nice experience"
6119821,48277375,2015-09-25,4586034,Daichi,"Perfect location, people and service.
I had a great experience.
Next time when I come back to Seattle,I will stay here.
Thanks a lot!!"
6119821,48734244,2015-09-28,37802257,Jenny,"First and foremost, the location was absolutely ideal. Steps away from the Pike Place Market, downtown, waterfront, and space needle made my trip so convenient. 

The hostel is kept clean and tidy and the employees are not the friendliest, but professional.  I expected to meet more people staying at the hostel but then again, I didn't join in on the activities that they had planned. The room I stayed in had 8 bunk beds and everyone was very respectful, quiet, and to themselves while in the room. The bed itself wasn't the most comfortable, but wasn't the worst. The only real negative I can think of is that two out of the three bathrooms that I had used smelled of urine even though it looked fairly clean. 

Would recommend just for the prime location and cheap stay! "
6119821,49332470,2015-10-03,38042289,Jennie,Such a great stay here! Cozy place and super nice staffs! I was having a lot of fun in Seattle and this would not happen without the Green Tortoise! Will come back one day! 
6119821,49554374,2015-10-04,41021957,Michele Piero,"The hostel was great, especially in terms of location. Close to the waterfront and right next to the Pike Market. Nearly everything is within walking distance and for the rest the hostel offers bikes to rent. The personal was very nice and there is a very friendly atmosphere all around the hostel. On some days there is free dinner and every morning they provide ingredients for you to make your own pancakes or eggs for breakfast. 
I enjoyed my stay there a lot and I can absolutely recommend it. "
6119821,50322087,2015-10-11,39774767,Dustin,"This was a great place to stay and the staff were very helpful. They answered questions, got us set up and helped when we needed it. Never stayed in a hostile before but this felt identical to when I used to live in a dorm room. Shared sleeping space, kitchen but with private bathrooms. That means if you're looking for a nice, quiet place to sleep be by yourself, you're out of luck unless you get a single room (it's available, but cost a bit more).

My only complaint was I wasn't aware of the $20 per person cash deposit that was required and also that the personal storage requires your own lock. It makes sense and there is a Target right next door, so I was able to get what I needed but I was caught a little off guard.

Overall though, great experience. Free breakfast in the morning plus a happy and helpful staff make this a place I would stay at again!"
6119821,51670608,2015-10-22,45477270,Brett,I have stayed in hostels in Europe and South America and this is far by the best one I have ever stayed it. EXTREMELY welcoming.
6119821,51900355,2015-10-25,31377356,Janelle,"It was my first time staying at a hostel and it was pretty awesome. The employees were nice (and had good taste in music). We were able to drop off our bags before check-in and get the paperwork out of the way, which made check-in super quick and easy. The location was perfect- it was walking distance to many shops, the pier, and restaurants. The suitcase cubby was huge! I was able to fit a carry-on suitcase, my backpack, and a few shopping bags with plenty of space to spare. Tips: there's a $20 cash deposit upon check-in (you will get it back when you check-out), bring your own lock for your cubby, and I suggest bringing shower slippers. All in all, it was a good experience and I would stay here again. It's cheap, convenient, and you meet awesome/new people. "
6119821,52331625,2015-10-28,44707494,Debbie,"The Green Tortoise Hostel provided the perfect accommodation for my overnight stay in (email hidden)e staff was very friendly, it was located directly across the street from Pike Place Market and was close to the Link Light Rail Station.  I was looking for a place to keep my luggage
safe while exploring the area and to get a little sleep before heading out early the next morning to catch a train.  No need for an upscale hotel room with a high price.  The shared room was clean and comfortable, and the private bathrooms in the hallway were modern and I never had to wait to get into one.  Great value for an overnight stay."
6119821,52649234,2015-10-31,38305114,Billy,地點方便。
6119821,52783516,2015-11-01,19458732,Vincent,"VERY GREAT FUN, particularly it was Halloween, and free beers all night !
Cannot do closer to the hear of the city center, since it is in the city center, and just cross the road and you'll find the Market.

Well organized in terms of activities and facilities :
Internet, wifi, self-service computer, parties, free breakfast, ..."
6119821,53615605,2015-11-10,35403068,Nathan,Great experience. Sleeping arrangements are great and host has plenty of advise about what to do in the city. Breakfast is delicious. Bring cash for deposit. 
6119821,55225599,2015-11-29,47065448,Brooke,The Green Tortoise is located in a great place! It's right next to downtown and the Pike Place market. It was my first experience staying in a hostel and I definitely will stay in more. The hostel is clean and the setup is very charming. It's also a great place to meet other young travelers. A wonderful place to stay if you enjoy hostels! 
6119821,56217516,2015-12-10,45387261,Becca,"I had a great stay at the Green Tortoise Hostel. Though the energy was a bit different than what I was hoping for, the hostel itself is extremely clean, quiet and the location seriously can't be better. I'll be looking forward to my next stay!"
6119821,58186613,2016-01-01,43427129,Christina,"This was my first experience at a hostel and I really enjoyed my stay at Green Tortoise Hostel. Location of Green Tortoise is absolutely undefeatable. It's literally right across street from the Pike Market and is surrounded by all the cool places to eat, drink and shop. The owner Rex was very responsive to my questions before the trip which helped with my trip planning. Staffs working at the hostel are always willing to help and shared with me a lot of tips for where to go and what to see. The hostel was pretty clean and well organized. They do room cleaning every day to take out the trash and vacuum the carpet in each room. They also change the beddings as soon as people check out. There are plenty of private bathrooms for people to use and they are all pretty well maintained (no sharing). Overall, this place really is a good deal for people who are traveling on a budget and willing to make new friends."
6093756,33390188,2015-05-27,19204394,Alex,"Justin was really helpful and his apartment is fantastic. It's really spacious with a nice kitchen and comfy living space. He left us a bunch of snacks, breakfast items, and other treats which we really appreciated. Would definitely stay here again when visiting Seattle!"
397117,1069714,2012-04-01,1972773,Cynthia,This apartment is great and just what we needed for a couple of nights. Lauren is very friendly and communicative and she made sure we were all set before leaving us to our stay in Seattle. I would surely refer anyone needing a place in a good location. The hotel next door has coffee just steps away.
397117,1080983,2012-04-03,2042734,Lina,"I had a wonderful stay at Lauren's place for 2 nights.  It's the best location to find in Seattle.  It is close to Amtrack, shoppings, restaurants, and ocean.  The view from the apartment was stunning.  I would definitely stay at this place again.  Thank you Lauren again!"
397117,1128748,2012-04-14,1159273,Bill,"Lauren's place is wonderful - beautiful hardwood floors, GREAT views of the city and VERY centrally located. Literally a block to the amazing Seattle public library, to the YMCA (I was able to swim/workout), free daytime buses just a block or two away, and of course great hangouts like Bauhaus Books n' Coffee or Hotel Sorrento.  Her building is 1920s and sits amid modern skyscrapers - a wonderful throwback to an older Seattle.  

Lauren was great  - when I casually asked her about Seattle guide books she dropped off a couple the next day. She really has a knack for listening to each visitor's concerns - she directed me to Hotel Sorrento's wonderful fireplace reading room, a short walk from her place and answered my many questions about Seattle. "
397117,1171650,2012-04-23,2097288,Lana,"Lauren is pleasant ,well organized  host; her place is sunny, clean, in great location, definitely will recommend to anybody visiting (email hidden)na"
397117,1241387,2012-05-07,2164828,Tracy,Super easy to coordinate with.  Really enjoyed our stay at her place. 
397117,1261943,2012-05-11,103522,Jim,"Nice aptartment, bright  and within couple of blocks to the shopping district downtown. Also a nice walk to Safeco field for games. Lauren is wonderful and and a thoughtful host. "
397117,1304670,2012-05-19,1814035,Toni,Lauren's place is absolutely fabulous; it felt like home immediately. Everything I needed was at my fingertips from a french press to make a great cup of coffee to perfect little reading lights well placed by the bed. Lauren was totally engaged and available to answer any questions and to make certain my stay was comfortable. She is a terrific host and truly welcomed me into her space. 
397117,1334801,2012-05-23,2015647,Parveena,"The space, location and the host couldn't have been more perfect. The apartment is spacious and cozy. The location is very central, I walked everywhere. And Lauren really went out of her way to make sure I was warm and got everything I needed. Would definitely stay here again and I recommend anyone looking for a place in Seattle. "
397117,1348513,2012-05-25,2421405,Carl And Marianne,"I was hoping for the apt to be ok, but found it to be wonderful.  I had the nicest experience.  GREAT location!  I walked through a park to the convention center; walked 2 blocks to work out at a great YMCA fitness center.  The apt is older but utterly charming, airy and romantic.  The second the charming hostess, Lauren, left me I called my wife and begged her to fly up to enjoy the charming place with me."
397117,1503318,2012-06-18,1822974,Luke,"First I want to say that Lauren was a great hostess. She was responsive and easy to work with. The second floor apartment we had was old but tastefully decorated, clean and roomy. Lauren provided us extra towels. It had a small kitchen that had the basics one needs to make or heat up a breakfast.  The queen/full bed was a bit soft without a headboard but adequate. The biggest asset and drawback of the apartment is its location. It is very conveniently located basically 1/2 mile from the waterfront, the international district, and the downtown shopping area. The drawback is that it is across the street from a high rise that has exhaust fans roaring 24/7. (Sounds like commercial kitchen hoods going 24/7 just outside the windows). Closing the windows shut doesn't help much. We knew from other reviews to bring earplugs to sleep with. But during the day I used noise cancelling headphones just to have peace and quiet. Fortunately we weren't in the apartment most of the day. Traffic noise was really not a problem in comparison because it dies out at night. So beware if you are a light sleeper and noise bothers you. If it wasn't for the noise from the fans across the street, I would give it 4 stars."
397117,1595549,2012-06-30,2260527,Eli,Lauren is kind and helpful and her place is super! 
397117,1607676,2012-07-02,973798,Dan,Great location and Lauren was very friendly and helpful!
397117,1655669,2012-07-08,2374271,Tiffany,"Lauren was great and extremely helpful with tips on getting around and places to see when we first arrived. The apartment is in a great location, well kept, and has everything you would need or want. Thanks!"
397117,1729255,2012-07-17,613111,Sonya,"I stayed at Lauren's place in July and I absolutely loved the place and the location. It's in the old building but that's what I liked the most about it.  The bed was super comfortable and Lauren is very friendly and helpful.

The only concern is if you are travelling by a car, make sure you know where to park a car for your stay. We arrived too late and we couldn't park it on the closest parking lot so we had to park it in the nearest hotel. But besides that I'd totally recommend  the stay for everyone who wants to experience Seattle!"
397117,1795517,2012-07-25,1316568,Mindy,"We did not want to rent a car, this place was FANTASTIC.  We did so much walking that I would highly recommend good walking shoes!  I did not realize the city was so steep, so I ended up purchasing some new shoes.  The breeze off the ocean was perfect for sleeping and waking up to the view, WOW!  The water flow in the shower was a bit low but that was it.  Lauren was SO accommodating to our arrival and departure.  Lauren was always on hand if we need help."
397117,1847425,2012-07-31,2104892,Shawn,My son and I stayed at Lauren's apartment for five nights in July while we were in Seattle for a wedding.  The apartment is centrally located to lots of  Seattle's downtown attractions making walking to and from a pleasurable experience.  Everything inside the apartment and building works and looks great.  It's an older building with lots of charm and a very nice place I would be happy to call my own home.  It's in the city so there are lots of city noises you will hear at night as you fall asleep.  These were most noticeable the first night but by the third night I was sleeping very well and my young son had no problems falling asleep each night.  And the comfort offered by the bed in her apartment is beyond anything you will find at a high-priced hotel.  You will enjoy your stay too.
397117,1866025,2012-08-01,3085589,Amy,"This place had everything we wanted/ needed. Close proximity to Safeco field and downtown Seattle, it was clean, tidy and in a very beautiful, historic building. Lauren was a very gracious, helpful hostess. I peppered her with questions before and after we reserved the space and she answered promptly and with generosity.
We really appreciated the flexibility afforded by Lauren in her beautiful apartment, she had no problem allowing us a last minute add-on guest.
Thanks so much! We're already planning our next visit.
"
397117,1912868,2012-08-07,497686,Kate,"Lauren was a brilliant host and we had a great stay in Seattle. Her apartment is lovely and the location was great, although it is was quite noisy. Lauren was really flexible, not complaining at all about our late arrival and even offering to be available to receive my suitcase from Fedex after our airline has mislaid it. "
397117,1957296,2012-08-12,1556331,Susan,"Excellent location.  Everything downtown was within walking distance.
The apartment is very charming with a lot of character.  It was equipped with everything that we needed. We appreciated the big windows and all the light.  Our host made herself readily available. We would definitely stay here again!"
397117,2037547,2012-08-20,459630,Mariela,"Cute apartment in a great location.
We met Lauren and she was very helpful in answering our questions.
This is a nice place to stay while in Seattle."
397117,2107669,2012-08-27,2455483,Angie,This apartment is in the perfect location in downtown Seattle- easily accessible to the waterfront and attractions.   Photos of the place are completely accurate- it's a quirky little place with all the amenities.   Cheaper than and better than a downtown hotel!   Highly recommended!
397117,2189983,2012-09-04,788269,Ted,"Location was fantastic. About 10 minutes leisurely walk to the convention center. Couch and bed were both comfy. The locations of the light switches was kinda weird, but that's pretty standard for older buildings."
397117,2234139,2012-09-08,3212587,Maria,"Absolutely loved this space, it was so nicely decorated and so comfortable :) Lauren was awesome. met us at the door when we arrived and told us the good spots around town. The location was perfect walking distance to Pikes, the needle and all stores downtown, would definitely stay again!
"
397117,2342197,2012-09-19,1022093,Melissa And Andrew,"Lauren's apartment was fantastic, excellent location, was spacious, fresh and airy with loads of natural light!  Facilities were great with an extra comfy bed, speedy wi-fi and lots of books/brochures about the Seattle area! Lauren was a great host, very friendly and easy to contact. We really enjoyed our time here and would highly recommend Lauren's apartment and we will definitely be staying here again on our next trip to Seattle! :) Thanks Lauren :)"
397117,2359284,2012-09-21,2462442,Dylan,"Great location & place.  Lauren met us on time, set us up in minutes & we had a terrific two day stay.  We would stay there again."
397117,2377738,2012-09-22,3198455,Jamie,Enjoyed our stay at Lauren's place!  Our stay turned out to be a last minute booking and Lauren was very accommodating on such short notice.  It is a cute apartment and quite a comfy bed and even a nice view!  Such a great location in the middle of everything.  Lauren was very laid back and was quite helpful with parking.  She made it too easy!!   
397117,2385618,2012-09-23,2175349,Drew,"Lauren was an amazing host! She met me at the apartment, showed me around her very warm and charming abode, and also offered suggestions on things to do and see in Seattle! She made herself available to answer questions and coordinate the departure. Every part of the stay went so perfect. And after a long day of sightseeing and then a night on the town, it was incredibly nice to come back to such an amazing place. I would definitely stay here again! Thanks Lauren for your hospitality! See you in Seattle on my next trip."
397117,2418866,2012-09-26,3121058,Jessica,"Great location as far as where it was in relation to all of the touristy spots you'd want to visit! We had less than 2 miles to anywhere we wanted to go, and also loved that we could ride the Link Light Rail transportation system for such a low fee. We also enjoyed the clean atmosphere of the building and knowing that we had security coming from all sides of the block was also a great sense of relief! Lauren was great at giving us information in regards to great food places and sights to see, also had a nice, clean and spacious apartment. Great for couples! We didn't have towels when we first arrived, but Lauren was only a phone call away since she also resides in the same building. Overall, wonderful stay and would definitely recommend Lauren to anyone looking to visit Seattle and I'm certain we will visit again one day as well! If there was any downfall at all, it would just be the traffic noise that is heard throughout the night. Solution-close the window! haha Thank you Lauren for making our stay in Seattle so memorable! "
397117,2438766,2012-09-28,3491251,J.M.,"Had an awesome experience with Lauren and her place. The room was furnished as described with a bunch of thoughtful extras such as books, local maps, and shoes! Just kidding about that last bit. ;-).

The apt. was in a great location as described in the heart of the downtown area with buses literally stopping in front of the building. Everything was so much easier with that convenience. Taxis dropped off and picked-up right outside also so getting around late at night wasn't an issue either.

Lauren was easy to get a hold of and very professional and prompt in answering any questions I had for her. She was also very understanding of my request to delay check-out for a bit to make it more convenient for my out-going flight. Lauren really made the experience wonderful!"
397117,2449188,2012-09-29,249507,Kenneth,"Very easy to work with! Ultra nice. Although I was only there a night she made me feel welcome and provided me with a lot of info. 

Thanks!!"
397117,2461729,2012-10-01,616870,Marcy,"Lauren was gracious as always.  Love staying in her home.  So close to all downtown Seattle, Safeco and Centruylink fields.  "
397117,2536706,2012-10-08,1183325,Aimee,"My husband and I had a great stay at Lauren's place in downtown Seattle. The place was spacious and cute. Lauren met us to show us the apt and was very helpful with recommendations on things to do as well as parking. (We rented a car.) The location was about a 15 minute walk for us from Pike's Place (we live below sea level, so it took us a few more minutes than most people, I'm sure!) Overall great experience! Would definitely recommend this place !"
397117,2582715,2012-10-11,3078281,Sue,"We stayed in Lauren's place enroute to Hollyhock in British Columbia. The plan was to arrive in Seattle around noon, have the day there, then take the Ferry to Victoria and travel from there. Unfortunately, our plane was delayed for 5 hours, so we arrive quite late at Lauren's place. We were tired and bedraggled after a long day of travel.

Lauren welcomed us with a bottle of wine and a sandwich, which was incredibly sweet. The place was great, close to the train from the airport. A sweet apartment. And Lauren was sweet and gracious - she even waived the cleaning fee because of our late arrival - we left the next morning at 6am - because she felt bad charging us for that, since all we did was fall exhausted into the bed. 

We are returning to Hollyhock next year and hope to stay with Lauren again if we go through Seattle!"
397117,2590836,2012-10-12,657796,Jessica,"I recently traveled to Seattle for my sister's wedding and Lauren's place was perfect. It was close to where we wanted to go downtown (walking or quick cab ride) and just as described on Airbnb. Lauren was a terrific hostess - she was flexible with our check in, informed us about parking, and made herself available in case of questions. The apartment itself was very comfortable, stylish, and roomy. Great view and lots of light too! Hope to be back there on my next Seattle visit - I highly recommend!"
397117,2701201,2012-10-24,3629184,Dave,"I was going to a conference at the hotel next door, and this turned out to be just the right place. The rooms were very comfortable, and the view was nice. I would definitely come back."
397117,2781565,2012-11-01,557965,Suzaynn,"I loved this apartment!  It is just the sort of place I always wanted to live in when I was in my 20's, but could never afford.  It is in a very old-fashioned building.  At first glance it isn't promising: linoleum-covered hallways, elevators as an afterthought.  However, the unit has high ceilings, wood floors and a view of Puget Sound.  The neighbors were quiet and despite being right across from the freeway, the apartment was quiet.  Everything was clean and nice.  I had a relaxing stay and Lauren was a kind hostess.  "
397117,2823047,2012-11-07,2205027,Jane,"Lauren is a great host, was easy to communicate with. The condo is in a great location for walking around Seattle. Loved the view from the windows. Condo all exactly as describe. "
397117,2851710,2012-11-10,3414832,Christopher,My wife and I had a quick stay at Lauren's place on our way through Seattle.  Lauren was a gracious and communicative host.  Check in process was very easy and the apartment is in a very good location for accessing down town Seattle.  We would definitely stay again!
397117,2859903,2012-11-11,4071938,Ben,Lauren was awesome. She communicates very well and in a timely manner. She was very hospitable and the place was absolutely perfect. It had all we needed for a comfortable stay. I almost felt like I was an actual Seattle resident staying here! I recommend Lauren and any this space to anyone looking to visit the city.
397117,2877167,2012-11-13,3856394,Francois,"Best place to stay in Seattle! Nice, clean and an excellent location. Lauren was awesome! "
397117,2893844,2012-11-15,3702973,B Kay,"This place was awesome!!! she is so super sweet, and accommodating as well!  She even worked with me on a special request. Very clean, spacious, close to everything!!! Walking distance to all touristy things!

 Thank you Lauren!"
397117,2911668,2012-11-18,3729395,Jade,"So, Airbnb's website was down when I wanted to book the apartment, which was... hectic... Luckily, Lauren is totally wonderful and kept in touch and worked with me until Airbnb fixed the problem. 5 BIG gold stars for her! This was my first Airbnb stay and despite the website glitch, I couldn't have been more satisfied with the apartment; location ruled (if you have a car, very easy access to the highway and roads, if not, the place is central enough that you can everywhere!) and it was equipped with everything we needed. I will definitely be in touch with Lauren whenever I am in Seattle."
397117,2917339,2012-11-19,288769,Elliott,"Just a lovely apt. in an older building.  Located near the hotel Renaissance, you have instant taxi service.  The apt in located on the 2nd floor with a wonderful view of the downtown.  We slept well.  Lauren has added wonderful personal touches throughout.  First rate."
397117,3010628,2012-12-02,3435343,Nicole,"If you are looking for a cheap place to stay, this is your spot. However, if you are looking to get a good night's sleep, then it is not. 

Lauren is an incredibly gracious host, however her place is located in an apartment building right next to the freeway, which makes for very loud nights. The windows are paper thin, and the bed is very small and uncomfortable for two people. On top of that, the cleaning ladies used an excessive amount of bleach to clean before we arrived, which made the apartment smell fowl for our entire two day stay...and there was still hair on the floor of the bathroom, so the cleaning was not thorough. 

I hate to leave a negative review, but I would have not chosen to stay here had any of the reviews I read mentioned anything about the noise and uncomfortable sleeping situation. Hopefully, this review offers a balanced perspective.  "
397117,3035418,2012-12-06,2771508,Lucy,"Lauren's brilliant. Very quick to reply, kind, brings emergency wine, funny, good books. Apartment is great. Location is brilliant. (Yes, it's near the highway, but it's more a low grade purr in the background than anything else and it didn't bother us.)  Transport very easy -  bus stops to everywhere within 5 mins' walk and a taxi rank right outside.  Building is older (in a good way) and charming: high ceilings, loads of light, very cozy. If you really like hermetically-sealed super-modern condos, or want a 'hotel experience', this isn't for you; but if you want somewhere you can properly relax and feel at home in, then you'll probably like this place as much as we did.  "
397117,3072632,2012-12-11,4304630,Vishal,"Fantastic cozy apartment in the heart of Seattle! Lauren is fantastic--she's friendly, communicates promptly, and even takes the time to help you with some local tips on getting about. Highly recommended! 
"
397117,3117379,2012-12-19,1835506,Heidi,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this apartment. Lauren is genuinely friendly and a good host making herself available to answer any questions. Good location we walked to the city and pike place market. Even took advantage of laundry as we had travelled through the states.
397117,3141008,2012-12-23,3248982,Noah & Laurel,"Lauren was an awesome host, and the place was great.  Very clean, comfortable, and was very accessible from Downtown and Pike Place Market.  Apartments (including this one) can get a bit cold / drafty in the winter, but Lauren made sure to have a space heater on hand in case we were cold.  Great, easy stay! "
397117,3238745,2013-01-03,3597092,Donald,"Review from my daughter and son in-law who stayed 7 nights over New Year’s:




Pro’s:

-The apartment is in a perfect location for walking to the best of the best that Seattle has to offer

-Taxi stop just right outside the door to the building

-Bus stops just outside

-Check in was smooth

-Apartment had everything we needed

-Nice light and views in the space







Con’s:

-The noise at night is pretty epic, we had to sleep with earplugs in our entire stay.  From the sound outside to the hissing whistle of the heaters inside count yourself lucky if you don’t have a broken sleep, and the electric heater was very noisy as well.




-Even though the heaters were on, where your head rests, gets quite cold- being that your head is right next to a window.




-if you’re someone that needs a good mirror for dressing up or doing your hair this suit is not for you.  You get one smaller bathroom mirror and the light in the bathroom is no good.  The bathroom has no space for putting your bathroom stuff.  Getting ready to go out was quite a hassle.




-The bed is more suited to one person, but it is comfy.




-It’s on a hill, so you have to walk up to it from wherever you’re coming from.  That was the hardest after a long day of walking around.




All that being said we still had a great time and would recommend staying here for maybe one or two nights.




Tips:

-Earplugs a must and perhaps sleep aids

-Bring a facecloth as one was not provided

-Bring your own coffee/tea/cream/sugar

-Don’t bring a lot of bathroom stuff

397117,3307151,2013-01-08,1626552,Caroline,"We stayed in Lauren's place instead of a hotel for a conference at the convention center, and it was fantastic! Very comfortable and clean, cheaper than a hotel, and tons of personality. Lauren was a great host and made sure we had everything we needed."
397117,3338591,2013-01-13,4440563,April,"This was my first experience on Airbnb and I don't think I could honestly have asked for a better host. To say that Lauren was awesome is such an understatement.  On the front end, Lauren was so responsive and quick to return email, which is great because I had a ton of questions. As a host she was responsive to all our needs. She met us at the door to exchange keys and give us a lay of the land. Her place is so centrally located and things are definitely walking distance. It has a great view and is very quiet perfect for two people. I really felt at home in Seattle because of the place. Lauren was good at checking in to see if we need anything. She even delivered extra blankets and goodies- I felt like a VIP suite at a hotel but this was better. Lauren was so cool and down to earth- we wanted to hang out with her. We even considered staying an extra day! The price is beyond fair and I think that you get more bang for your buck! All further Airbnb hosts have a lot to live up to now. Lauren you are the best and I definitely wouldnt stay anywhere else in Seattle when I visit! Thank you!!"
397117,3445895,2013-01-31,1696033,Ceci,"Wonderful home--central to everything, view of Puget Sound, really great place! 
Lauren was a wonderful host, waiting up for us when our plane got in late and taking extra care toward the end to be sure we had everything we needed. 
highly recommend staying with Lauren for the apartment, the location, the amenities, and the city. "
397117,3519285,2013-02-11,2519446,Joel,"Overall we had a really great experience. Lauren was a good host and gave us a great orientation to the neighborhood and space. The apartment is clean, comfortable and quirky. In a neighborhood that is full of glass high rises, this building is one of the few beautiful older buildings remaining. The neighborhood is downtown so the immediate area is high rise commercial buildings, but all the bars and restaurants near first ave and the waterfront are only a few blocks away. Additionally, Capitol Hill is a short bus ride away. There is typical city and traffic noise outside, but this is not a problem if you are used to it. Very little noise filters through from adjacent apartments as well. The bed is small (a full I think) but was still fine for two people if you don't mind being close. If you like to sleep in, you should know that the although no window gets direct sunlight in the morning, it is still pretty bright with really only blinds to cover the windows. The only annoyance we had was that there was no soap in bathroom and we only had one towel. We expected more towels the first night, but they were not delivered until the second night. In summary, good location for the price and a comfortable space."
397117,3545155,2013-02-15,2574271,Gordon,"Lauren has been extraordinarily helpful during my stay. I did become ill and she helped me with getting in contact with the doctor and even did some shopping! Being her guest is really a privilege!
The apartment is extremely nice and tasteful. The location is very central. I can absolutely recommend staying at her place!"
397117,3635240,2013-02-26,380179,Yi-Wei,Lauren was an amazing host! We loved her place as it was at the heart of the Seattle downtown core. A 10-15 minute walk away from the main shopping areas. We managed to find street parking for free during the night as well.
397117,3701252,2013-03-05,1570699,Jimmy,"Lauren has an amazing place and located within walking distance to where ever you need to go in downtown.  She met with us at check in and answered all our questions(Starbucks across the street).  Her restaurant recommendations were phenomenal.  The apartment is near a busy street so you do get general city noise during the day.  At night you may get noise from the heater and rain, so if you are a light sleeper earplugs will help.  Overall, Lauren's place was exactly what we wanted and she was only a call or message away if we needed help."
397117,3787993,2013-03-15,409074,Mehrzad,"The place was amazing! My girlfriend and I couldn't have asked for a better host. Lauren was there for our every need, which seemed like quite a lot. We were constantly asking her questions about what places she thought we should visit and she answered every question. The apartment was much better than staying in hotel. Hotels are normally plain looking and simple but the decorations of the place made it an awesome place to stay. The location of the apartment also made our visit to Seattle amazing because it was very close to the center of downtown, which is exactly what we wanted. Traffic at night can be a little bit noisy but it didn't bother us at all. I recommend staying at Laurens place!!! She was an awesome host and you won't be disappointed!!"
397117,3908147,2013-03-26,5140471,Ariana,Great location. We walked everywhere. Very cute one bedroom with a view of the water! Lauren was so helpful. 
397117,4063045,2013-04-07,2197877,Lara,"Lauren's place was the perfect place for me during my 8 night trip to Seattle. I was traveling on my own scouting out areas I may want to move to and this place was a perfect home base. The location was great quick and easy walking distance to Pike Place Market and shopping, also easy walking distance to some of the other neighborhoods around the city center.  I also liked having the hotel right next door, there were always valet guys out so I felt really safe walking back at night.  
Lauren was very accommodating the place had everything I needed for my stay.  Opening the large windows got the perfect breeze going through when it got too warm!  The kitchen even had basic cooking ingredients as well as many things others had left behind which made things easy.  The bed was right by the windows and so it was a little noisy at night and since it is near the freeway there was that background noise as well, but I found that after a night or two the freeway noise became hardly noticeable. The rest of the building, neighbors and area was pretty quiet.  Will be back again and suggest to friends!"
397117,4129345,2013-04-12,5441333,Kerry,"Lauren was very welcoming and her place was so cute and clean. The location was great! Less than a mile to most attractions like Pike Place Market, Seattle Center, and Capitol Hill. The hills are pretty steep so we sometimes took a cab around which was usually around $5. The apartment is located next door to the Renaissance Hotel and there is always a cab available. "
397117,4138511,2013-04-13,547357,Megan,Lauren was a great host.  She gave me excellent directions on how to find her place and gave me the run down when I got there.  Her place has a fantastic view of the water and the city and is very centrally located.  I enjoyed the time I spent there and would recommend it.
397117,4329410,2013-04-28,2506663,LaRee & Matt,"Although Lauren was pleasant and helpful at getting us settled in, the otherwise decent apartment is noisy. It's located right across the street from Hwy 5 in downtown Seattle. Our bad was to not read enough of the comments but we did review the street scene, which did not show the freeway because it's just over a rise from the camera shot. We also looked at the general map but missed the proximity to the freeway as the map is not specific. We emailed before booking to ask how noisy it was and Lauren said it's ""pretty quiet, particularly at night. There is very little activity and traffic in the neighborhood at night."" When we got the exact address after making our reservation, we were still concerned with the location and called Lauren to ask about the noise. She assured us that the building had been upgraded with dual paned windows, and the apartment faced away from the freeway, and that it would not be too noisy. Not so. The windows proved to be old and ill-fitting, there was a bay window overlooking the freeway, and the unit is surrounded by much bigger skyscrapers that bounce the sound around and down the street. If we hadn't brought good earplugs, we would have been kept awake all night, even with the windows closed. The ambient building temperature was warm  enough to almost force keeping the windows open, in which case it would have been intolerable. To Lauren's credit, she did offer to refund us for our 2nd night if we wanted to find another place, but that would have meant using our last full day in Seattle looking for new digs, so that didn't help. Otherwise, the location is great for walking around downtown, and there are lots of cool things to see and do in the vicinity. Lauren was also helpful about where and how to park if you have a car. (Street parking is $4/hour but you can get a 24-hour lot at about $17.) But because of the noise, we wouldn't go back."
397117,4389413,2013-05-02,1891803,Joe,"Lauren's place was great. Very clean, comfortable and close to downtown. She was also quite helpful in orienting us to our surroundings quickly. Hers was an oasis amidst the downtown huge hotels!
"
397117,4436654,2013-05-05,4606188,Joe And Stella,"My stay at Lauren's was great. People have commented that the apartment has a lot of street noise, but I found it to be no noisier than many hotels I have stayed in with air-conditioning units, and it certainly didn't effect my nights sleep. Also, it is in the centre of Downtown Seattle (there is going to be a bit of noise). The apartment was really comfortable and bigger than it looks from the photographs (Lauren's photos don't do it justice).  Its close to everything the visitor to Seattle might need, and as its next to a major hotel it is always easy to get a taxicab. 

Lauren's communication was great and she gave me good tips on where to go in Seattle. I would highly recommend her place, and good value for money."
397117,4544381,2013-05-12,997763,Leanne,"Lauren was great. She helped us get settled and gave us advice about getting around. The apartment was in a great location, easy access to downtown, the market, ferries, etc. There was plenty of hot water in the shower. Being close to the highway, there was a lot of traffic noise. "
397117,4646932,2013-05-18,3831163,Steven,"Lauren has an incredible apartment very near downtown Seattle that has great views of the sound! Her apartment is tastefully decorated and spacious. Everything worked great and she was extremely helpful in guiding us from the airport to her apartment. She also had tips for how to get to the shopping district and nearby transportation options - of which there were many. Overall, can't say enough good things about this location. We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again if we return to Seattle!"
397117,4720248,2013-05-21,6367298,Jane,"Wow! Best host ever and I want this apartment as my own. Lauren has styled it perfectly and everything you need she has catered for, plus some. Lauren is amazing! She not only greets you with a friendly smile but also provides all the information for an incredible stay in Seattle! I will absolutely be coming back and my friends that were staying in a nearby hotel that saw this apartment wanted to swap with me, they just loved it! If you want a great place in downtown and a seamless stay in Seattle, Lauren is your girl! Couldn't recommend highly enough, 5 stars! I will be back Lauren!! X"
397117,4825943,2013-05-28,4524328,Emily,"Lauren was a great hostess! She was easy to reach before and during our stay and was flexible regarding our arrival and departure plans. The apartment is adorable and in a great location for visiting any part of the city on foot or by bus. We arrived via the Light Rail, which was very easy, but opted for a taxi back to the airport as we were running late and were happy to find that the apartment building is located on the same block as a taxi stand. I highly recommend this property to couples with or without small children visitng Seattle for any length of time."
397117,4869273,2013-05-29,3973381,Rebecca,"My boyfriend and I spent a night here as a staycation, we both live in Seattle, but wanted to experience a night downtown and Lauren's place was the perfect place! Lauren was the most accomodating host and we couldn't have asked for a better time. Everything is so well decorated and there was a kitchen so we could buy groceries and cook dinner. I recommend this place to anyone interested in staying close to downtown. Also, the building is wonderfully old with piping visible in the hallways. Also, definitely try the elevator if you stay here, totally trippy! Thanks Lauren!!"
397117,4935198,2013-06-03,5405978,Mae,"This apartment was an excellent choice in many ways!  Great location, awesome layout, had the amenities we needed most, and we felt very comfortable and at home during our stay.  I would definitely recommend this apartment for your next excursion to the city!"
397117,5173786,2013-06-17,886894,Chad,"Lauren is a great host! We had a wonderful time in Seattle. The place was as described, great location, easy walking distance to everything. No issues with anything at all and place was clean, inviting and comfortable. Would recommend and stay again. Thanks again Lauren!"
397117,5256482,2013-06-21,713349,Allison,"Lauren's apartment was a great find and a great place to stay during a short conference in Seattle. The meeting I was attending was literally in the hotel next door. It was so nice to be able to get away and have a great home away from home. Lauren was super accomodating after my flight arrived late and the place was spotless. I unfortunately did not get a chance to meet her, but communication was very easy and I felt at ease in my travels.  I loved the whole decor of the apartment and enjoyed the great natural light in the place. I could not have asked for anything better. Unfortunately, due to a family emergency, I was unable to spend the whole time I had planned in Seattle. Yet, it was also very easy to check out quickly and hop on a cab as there is a taxi stand right outside. I would highly recommend staying at Lauren's awesome pad and will hopefully return soon to finish out my Seattle adventure. "
397117,5280223,2013-06-22,1663165,Jessica,"My fiancé and I were looking for a room in Seattle for one night and this was a great one. Location was an easy walk to the water and pikes market. The apt was very comfortable and we slept great. Couldn't be happier, wish we could have stayed longer. "
397117,5306678,2013-06-24,930981,Sodeth,"Lauren was a great host and very accommodating.  I use to live in Seattle so I can vouch that the apartment is in a great location if you want to explore the city without needing a car.  I had no issues with the place but there are a few things you should keep in mind.  You are in the city and close to the freeway so there will be traffic noise.  It didn’t bother me but bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper.  The place felt large with 2 adults and a small child.  Also, even though it is an older apartment building we only heard neighbors once or twice which is always nice.  If available make sure you book this place on your trip to Seattle."
397117,5365620,2013-06-26,855067,Jo-Anne,"I was only in Seattle for a couple of nights, and Lauren's place was PERFECT!  The location was ideal for someone who was walking everywhere.  The cab stand next door was great when I needed to get to the Pier early in the morning.  Lauren was a wonderful host, meeting me upon my arrival and making sure I had everything I needed.  The apartment felt home-y and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a central location in downtown Seattle.  I would certainly stay here again!!  Thanks Lauren..."
397117,5383738,2013-06-27,2761416,Yaman,"Lauren's place was great -- super clean, stylish, and conveniently located to the downtown area. Although it is near a freeway, I barely noticed any noise -- I was able to catch a full night of sleep without issue. Lauren also worked with me to accomodate my late-night arrival and early departure. "
397117,5514101,2013-07-03,3720631,Julien,It was great! Very close to the center. Lauren was a perfect host and very helpfull .

Perfect for a couple of days to discover Seattle!"
397117,5871354,2013-07-20,7262954,Kristin,Very accommodating and great location! Would use again Forsure!
397117,5911675,2013-07-22,6783734,Lyle,A bit noisy with the ancient water heater or something in the early morning hours but this 1902 building is classy. Lauren was helpful and  the location is great.
397117,6100717,2013-07-30,5532905,Jules,"GREAT LOCATION AND COMFORTABLE APARTMENT. LAUREN GREETED US AND WAS ALWAYS AVAILABLE SHOULD WE HAVE HAD ANY QUESTIONS. WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND HER APARTMENT.

LAUREN, MANY THANKS!.....ANN&JULES"
397117,6141467,2013-07-31,837495,Martijn,"This was another great AirBnB experience. The apartment was located at one of the hills overlooking Seattle, and had a fantastic view. Lauren was very kind, helpful, and there upon our arrival to show us around. She gave us very good advice about how to go around in the city. We strongly recommend her place, but be prepared for the Seattle inclines when you walk / climb home. "
397117,6151581,2013-08-01,6770799,Hector,"We loved our stay at Lauren's. She met us there and had lots of information on what to see and how to get around. I was so nice to have such a bright, light filled space to ourselves. The apartment is in an old building and if someone wants everything modern , this is not the place  to come. There are things are just part of being on an older building ( like low pressure  for the shower)  We loved the place. It was clean and nicely decorated and spacious. It is next door to a large hotel so taxis and other transportation are easily accessed.With the windows open, the apartment was cool and comfortable. There is a lot of street noise which might be an issue for some folks but it did not bother us.
Great location. We walked and used buses to get around. We walked to Pike's Market. Easy walk to light rail to go to the airport.
Lauren was very helpful!"
397117,6236088,2013-08-05,4074781,Diane,"Lauren was great and very friendly, her place was perfect, good location, near pike place. We had a wonderful time in Seattle. Do not hesitate, come!!! "
397117,6286258,2013-08-06,3012470,Kristen,"I loved this cute, historic apartment. Lauren wasn't available when I arrived, but she left clear instructions and was nice enough to let me bring my bike into the apartment. I enjoyed my stay, especially with the ability to watch cable TV before hitting the road for five days of camping. Be aware that it's a little noisy because the freeway is right outside. I had no trouble getting to sleep, however. It's also just up the hill from Pike Place. :-)"
397117,6417156,2013-08-12,2558792,Brian,"Lauren was an amazing host and the space was charming. 

A comfortable one bedroom seems to be the perfect rental for airbnb. The space itself was VERY well kept and clean. The building was a in a perfect location. But Lauren was the best! She checked in on me when I was late checking in and even after my phone died she was attentive and accommodating to my hectic plans. She treated me better than my friends would have, had I been staying with them! Truly an excellent host. 
I guess the room was a little loud with the windows up, but definitely not enough to knock off a star. Just close the windows...

I would highly recommend Lauren as a host and I can't wait to rent from her the next time I'm in Seattle!"
397117,6484714,2013-08-14,6362755,Elenor,"Lauren was very friendly and helpful and we felt at home in her apartment.
Location was great and there's a cab rank right outside the door for those unable to walk.
Thanks Lauren!"
397117,6528473,2013-08-16,4658324,Jess,I had a great stay at Lauren's. The apartment was amazing and was the perfect size for just myself. The location was really handy being right in the city I didn't have to use public transport very much as I could walk. Thank you very much for having me stay! 
397117,6682363,2013-08-21,6198896,David,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Seattle this past August, 2013. It was most convenient staying downtown. We walked a lot, which was great exercise, and easily hailed cabs, as they were parked in front of the Hotel next door. A convenience store was only blocks away for any food, liquors, or other necessities one might need. We would recommend ear plugs for sleeping, due to the immense traffic noise. However, having the windows open for the breeze was nice. We also liked having our friends be able to rent an apartment down the hall from us. Lauren was most helpful with details of how to get around the city. Overall my husband and I had a spectacular stay and we would love to return with our family sometime."
397117,6779941,2013-08-25,6763696,Julie,"My lovely Seattle trip with my boyfriend was elevated to a spectacular experience thanks to Lauren Foster and her incredible rental.  Lauren was gracious from the moment I contacted her and the warm hospitality only grew throughout our stay. The apartment is perfect for a couple, small group of friends or a lone traveler. So very charming, chic and clean, it was easy to feel right at home. The location is fabulous and quite quiet considering it is in a central part of Seattle. The comfy bed is located under windows that offer a stunning view of the Puget Sound- what a wonderful way to wake up! Each morning we walked a few short blocks to the fantastic Pike Place Market where we could sample a new bold coffee and scrumptious breakfast item. Additionally, Lauren generously offered her sophisticated expertise in wine and food, leading us to the top hot spots of the city. Pintxo, a dashing tapas bar in Belltown, had some of the most decadent food I have ever had (ask for the Spanish goat cheese when you go!). My modest expectations for my Seattle trip were absolutely blown out water thanks Lauren and her fabulous apartment. I will be absolutely thrilled to return for another stay!

397117,6931547,2013-08-31,5971751,James,"My girlfriend and I chose Lauren's apartment because we thought the pictures looked nice and it seemed to be in an ideal location. If I had to do it over again I would still choose her apartment. Lauren was incredibly friendly, knowledgeable, and inviting. The apartment was everything described in her listing. The building was great and so was the location. I honestly can't say enough nice things about the experience and I would book any property listed by Hey in a heartbeat. Having a place that's as centralized as this apartment made our vacation amazing. My girlfriend and I will be back again for PAX next year and I'm incredibly hopeful that we'll be able to book Lauren's place again!
 "
397117,7004920,2013-09-03,4069491,Skyla,"Lauren is fantastic and her apartment lovely. She was extremely accommodating for me, as well as kind, and I could not have asked for a better experience. 

The apartment was just a few blocks away from where I needed to be for the weekend and the building is secure (and adorable). Lauren leaves a note with any information you need about the immediate area, which was a nice touch. The bed was very comfortable - not too hard, not too soft - and the view from the bedroom is lovely.

No complaints, everything was great, and I highly recommend Lauren's apartment!"
397117,7133882,2013-09-08,1103588,Jenny,"Lauren was great at communicating from the time I booked til we left her apartment. She went out of her way to ensure we were set up for our stay from the time we arrived in Seattle and was only too happy to make herself available to help with any questions we had. The apartment was clean and just as the photos portrayed, even roomier than we expected. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this little apartment and its host Lauren to anyone wanting the convenience of downtown Seattle. Keep in mind it is right in the city and therefore you have to expect traffic noise. "
397117,7322217,2013-09-16,5367310,Amber,Lauren was a great host. The apartment had a perfect location for downtown Seattle. We were able to walk everywhere. The apartment was decorated very well and clean. 
397117,7448627,2013-09-20,8693406,Joshoah,"Lauren's place is a fantastic location at a fantastic price. It is super clean and has everything you'll needs for a short or long stay, including a great view down the hill towards the sound."
397117,7545813,2013-09-24,2246670,John,"Great place, great location. Great price.  Lauren very accommodating and accessible to get a hold of.  Been coming to Seattle regularly for numerous years and this definitely one of the better accommodation set ups I've had.  "
397117,7620345,2013-09-27,7465045,Michelle,"Staying at Lauren's apartment was my first airbnb experience, and she did not disappoint! Lauren was extremely responsive in setting up our reservation and was flexible to meet our arriving/leaving times.  The apt is right in downtown and a close walk to the water/fish market. We were able to walk to Capitol Hill bars/restaurants and to the monorail for the Space Needle, etc.  My boyfriend and I managed to walk everywhere (something we do not normally do). There are some steep hills in Seattle but there is not much distance like in LA. The apt is exactly as pictured - very spacious for two people - with a pretty view.   I would recommend this apt to anyone!  "
397117,7923778,2013-10-08,2416572,Elizabeth,"Lauren was a lovely breath of fresh air after my cross country trip to Seattle. She was warm, friendly, and accommodating to my needs. I think she may have even offered to let me wear her shoes at one point (I didn't)! She was incredibly generous about letting me stay until the evening because my plane didnt leave until later. The apartment is in a prime location. Highly recommended. "
397117,7974125,2013-10-10,5214545,Sarah,My husband and I needed a room last minute and we are so happy we were able to stay at Lauren's. She was very accommodating with our late check in and communication was stellar. The location was perfect and the decor warm and inviting. It was very special to have stayed in such a beautiful and historic building! We will definitely book this in the future on return trips!
397117,8079951,2013-10-15,7763068,Sarah,"At the end of a long day of sight seeing, we felt like we were going home. The apartment was clean, comfortable, and convenient and Lauren was a great host.

I would rent from Lauren again in a heartbeat. She was always quick to respond to my emails and was very generous with thoughtful and clear directions and suggestions. She was kind, knowledgeable, and easy to talk to. She made sure we always knew how to get in touch with her if we needed anything. 

The apartment is very charming and Lauren has it fixed up very nicely. The location is perfect -- so close to the waterfront, Pike Place Market, downtown shopping, lots of great restaurants and cafes, and even the Space Needle. The hills are definitely manageable and there are always lots of cabs parked outside.

This was our first trip to Seattle and we fell in love with the city from the instant we landed. "
397117,8206278,2013-10-21,909329,Bianca,"This place is in a great location, the bed is super comfy, and Lauren is very nice and helpful.  It is close to some really great restaurants too. You can hear a few trucks going by outside in the night, but shouldn't be an issue for city-dwellers.  It was a great place to stay and I totally recommend it to anyone looking for a centrally located place in Seattle.  "
397117,8301457,2013-10-24,9073481,Chris,"This was a great little space in a central location for a great price. The apartment is cute, the building has historic charm, the bed is comfy and the location is within walking distance of just about everything in downtown Seattle. Lauren was communicative and helpful, and I had no problems checking in and out or getting what I needed. The building is quite close to I-5, but the apartment is at the opposite end of the building, so there is some traffic noise, but it is relatively muted. Given the value, I would stay here again."
397117,8323227,2013-10-25,3058880,Liz,"Lauren is a lovely host, very approachable and accommodating. I only stayed one night, but it was perfect for my getaway... affordable, cozy and an amazing view.... plus I felt safe in the area as a woman travelling alone.

Thanks again, Lauren!"
397117,8374129,2013-10-28,159863,Desiree,"So far with my experience using AirBnB, Lauren has been the best host by far. Her place was clean, cozy, and located in an ideal spot for our stay. She was there to greet us when we arrived and thoroughly walked us through simple procedures. Wifi and heater were a plus! She made herself available for local suggestions and was very knowledgeable and reassuring about the surroundings. Printed instructions were also provided for easy reference. Overall, our stay was very hospitable in this quiet, private place. Would definitely recommend staying here to anyone."
397117,8517373,2013-11-04,6129031,Jessica,"Great place to stay! Lauren was super helpful and very quick to respond with questions. The place is located right next to a hotel with a taxi stand should transportation be needed and we could check our bags there till our flight left later in the evening. The place is also just a couple blocks over from a light rail stop so coming from the airport is very easy!

The apartment was nicely furnished, had everything I could need, and had great views for when we were just lying around. The location was great and was within walking distance to everything we wanted to do (downtown and Lake Union).

Great place and we'd love to stay again!
"
397117,8730154,2013-11-14,1994622,Christian,"Great place, short walk to Pike St, shopping and cinema. Clean apartment, room and bed was quite comfortable. Very friendly and helpful host. Checked-in within 5mins. Solid WiFi, good choice of TV channels. 

Highly recommended!"
397117,8814659,2013-11-19,6644406,Andrea,"Lauren was a great host. Her apartment is in a great location and easy to get to public transportation. She was really knowledgable about how to get around, things to do and was really help full. She was flexible with check in and check out times. I would stay there again the next time I'm in Seattle.  "
397117,9153651,2013-12-09,10416414,Ryan,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it went perfectly.  Lauren is a thoughtful and generous host.  Her beautiful apartment was ideally located for my stay in Seattle.  And I could not have felt more comfortable or at ease.  Such a great experience.

I will definitely try to reserve with Lauren on my next trip. "
397117,9261336,2013-12-16,10568366,Ernie,Lauren is a genuine and kind.  She's easy to connect and communicate with and is very responsive.  She's made her place i super comfortable and welcoming.  Great light and views of the cityscape.
397117,9309327,2013-12-20,662051,Kate,Checking in was super easy.  The place was very clean and well stocked with necessary supplies.  Perfect location for being in the business district.  Lauren was easy to work with.  I would stay here again.
397117,9456426,2013-12-29,7301787,Michael & Leslie,"Lauren was wonderful to work with setting up our reservation. We got into town late so she arranged for us to pick up our keys at the hotel next door -- very convenient. ...AND we could always catch a cab very quickly at the hotel's cab-stand.  She also provided excellent dining suggestions to us.

Lauren's apartment was cozy and inviting and outfitted with everything we required.  We would definitely stay here the next time we're in Seattle.  Thanks Lauren!

Mike & Leslie"
397117,9749930,2014-01-07,9251955,Jackie,"I enjoyed Lauren's place. Her 1 bedroom rental has sweet decor and charm. A great location to get around downtown as well--taxi cabs are stationed right outside the building, and not a far walk to the piers. Lauren's apartment is a cozy abode for Seattle site seers. "
397117,9824689,2014-01-13,6004427,Natalie,"I travelled with my boyfriend to Seattle for a few nights and we really loved Lauren's place. Lauren is a great host who kept great communication with me throughout the entire process.  Even when we arrived she let us know that she was always just a text away.
The apartment is full if character and charm and we immediately felt like home. In a particularly wintery few days we were warm and cozy and the wifi and cable was fantastic.
The place was clean and the bed super comfy.
Another awesome thing about Lauren's place was that it was so close to everything. We didn't need to catch public transport once as downtown was about a five minute walk. 
I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Lauren! "
397117,9880520,2014-01-16,9165282,Richard,"Lauren is fantastic! She is genuine, has a warm personality and is a joy to be around with. Because she lives in the same building Lauren was always there when I asked her for something. The apartment is beautiful, clean and has everything you need, bathroom, kitchen, living room and a very nice bedroom. The twin bed is fantastic and slept really well. Although, there is some traffic it was no problem since the bedroom is on the back of the building.  The location is perfect, everything is on walking distance. I will most definitely return to Laurens apartment."
397117,9908374,2014-01-18,6201700,Tim & Donna,"The location is absolutely perfect.
This is an old building with lots of character. If you are looking for a modern place this is not for you. It is located on the second floor. The hallway is very wide and has lovely old, dark wood. I bet there are a lot of stories to be told about this building and the people who lived there. It does have a small lobby.
It is very clean, with wood floors that creek as they should and has lots of windows in the bedroom. It's a really pretty sight at night. The bathroom is small but has everything you need. The same goes for the kitchen.  Although there is no table for eating in the kitchen,you can use the coffee table in the living room.
My husband and I both slept quite well here. There is a lot of traffic and we thought it might be noisy but it was not in the least. There are lovely old, sliding doors to separate the bedroom from the living room.
The living room was very comfy with 3 big windows.
Do remember to draw the blinds when going to bed.
Lauren is very nice and she is there for you if you have a problem. She can give you recommendations on places to dine and places to visit. We had a wonderful breakfast at Planet Java. Also try and see the Chihuly Glass Garden . Take your camera. It was amazing."
397117,9954925,2014-01-21,6358920,Peter,We stayed at Lauren's rental apt Jan 17 through Jan 20.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Although yhe apt is in a very old building everything worked nicely.  Heating proved more than adequate and water stayed very hot.  Lauren obtained a parking stall for our rental car during our stay at a very reasonable rate.  Compared to nearby hotel parking it was cheap.  The location is convenient to all downtown attractions within walking distance.
397117,10192302,2014-02-05,8093783,Kendal,"Lauren is great and her place is charming.
Pros: Location/Charm/Lauren/ Wifi
Cons: Street noise and the place was a bit cold (heater wasn't working perfectly)

I would stay here again!"
397117,10248613,2014-02-09,4568305,Justin,"Lauren's place is in an awesome location. It is comfortable, clean and the whole building has a really lovable character. When I travel to Seattle, I'll be checking to see if Lauren's place is available first. "
397117,10511598,2014-02-23,10969690,Bonnie,"Lovely place with a great location. The apartment has everything you need and most things are within walking distance. Lauren (the host) is very friendly, incredibly helpful and accessible, and I recommend the place for anyone WHO needs a place to stay in Seattle. "
397117,10610476,2014-02-27,7389670,Chris,Lauren was a gracious host and her place is wonderful. I enjoyed my stay here and would recommend to others. 
397117,10673548,2014-03-03,724404,Vicente,"Lauren's place was the perfect sanctuary for a professional conference in downtown Seattle. I was able to walk six minutes and be in the heart of convention madness, then retreat back to the apartment and take a nap. With its high ceilings and natural light, the place was peaceful. And Lauren was a wonderful host. She greeted me personally, gave advice on coffee, and even offered to overnight a charger I left behind. Public transit from the airport was effortless, and when I needed to save time, taxis were parked right in front of the apartment building.  If there was a sixth star, I would gladly give it! "
397117,10783290,2014-03-07,12315829,Akinwole,"Lauren's place was great as well! Very cozy and centrally located. It was very secure and in a great neighborhood. A very quick walk to Pike Place Market, a short cab ride to the Space Needle, and a short walk to the Piers. We took a 10 minute cab ride to Capitol Hill and were surrounded by great restaurants and coffee shops during the day and evening. Lauren personally was very welcoming and extremely flexible, as we made a last minute modification to our reservation to come a day earlier. She was very accommodating and personally welcomed us for check-in. She gave us a rundown of all there is to do in Seattle and made herself available throughout our stay if we had questions. My fiance and I would certainly stay at Lauren's place again if we find ourselves in Seattle!"
397117,10837160,2014-03-10,3323215,Adam,"We loved staying in Lauren's apartment. The bed left a little bit to be desired in regard to size and comfort, but our overall experience was wonderful and we would recommend her place (and would stay again ourselves). Lauren is very friendly and helpful!"
397117,11003428,2014-03-17,1421653,Cassy,The flat was SO great and very quiet considering how close to I-5 it is. Lauren was a hoot and super accommodating. Can't wait to book with her again. 
397117,11167898,2014-03-24,4264701,Melissa,"FAVORITE. Not only is Lauren friendly and funny and wildly knowledgeable about downtown Seattle, but this apartment is even cuter in person than it is in the photos.  It was so wonderful to have a quiet spot to retreat to during my work conference.  Easy to walk to and from the Sheraton, Paramount and other hotels hosting the conference.  8 million restaurants and bars nearby. Also, my friends staying in other spots complained about getting cabs, but since Lauren's apartment is immediately next door to a hotel, every single time I walked out the door there was a cab waiting. 

I wanna go back to Seattle just so I can stay in this apartment again. "
397117,11222916,2014-03-25,4502153,Anthony,Lauren's apartment was beautiful. She was very welcoming and helpful. Highly recommend!
397117,11391872,2014-04-01,10477971,Melissa,"This was my first time using AirBnB and Lauren made our experience enjoyable and easy! Her apartment is close by everything, just a 5-10 minute walk to Pikes Place if you go straight down to 6th ave. The apartment was very clean and cozy. I'm a very picky person when it comes to cleanliness and I felt right at home for the week we stayed. The traffic noise didn't really bother me, and I'm also a very light sleeper. She made sure we were comfortable and told us to give her a call anytime. She was easily reachable via cell. Thank you so much Lauren for your apartment! I will definitely be staying at the lovely Dover the next time I'm in Seattle. "
397117,11464371,2014-04-04,11126976,Yuliya,"Lauren is a wonderful host, met me at the door and helped to settle in. You have everything you need in the apartment, really feels like ""home away from home"". The view is really great, the whole apartment has lots of light from huge windows (I was lucky enough to be in Seattle when the weather was sunny). The kitchen had everything I needed for quick meals. Yes, there was a bit of highway noise - but I never travel without earplugs :), so it was not a problem for me. Will definitely try to contact Lauren first if I ever need a place to stay in Seattle."
397117,11713893,2014-04-13,7140997,Jia Min,"I had a comfortable stay in this cute apartment in downtown Seattle. I was in town for a conference at the Fairmont Olympic, which is about a 6 minute walk away. The apartment is spacious and exactly as depicted in the pictures. The freeway is nearby so there is some noise, but it wasn't too bad-- I still slept well. Lauren was extremely accommodating and helpful! I'm grateful to have been able to get a better feel for Seattle by staying in this airbnb rather than a cookie-cutter hotel room."
397117,11775884,2014-04-14,2468133,Mariu,"Lauren is a the perfect host: friendly, easygoing and efficient. Her place is a beautiful, charming apartment in a perfect location to walk around Seattle! Gracias/Merci Lauren"
397117,12124407,2014-04-23,13240379,Brenda,"What a great little apartment!  Right downtown, within walking distance to many great restaurants and shops.  Lauren gave us excellent directions as we were driving in late and had never been to Seattle before.  She arranged a parking spot for us as well.  The apartment is so full of character and was a great place to relax after a long day shopping and wandering about.  Thanks Lauren for making our first airbnb experience so enjoyable!"
397117,12192642,2014-04-25,14296611,Rachael,"Lauren was a great host, super available and helpful. The apartment was just as described, plus well stocked. Perfect! Some people have commented about noise, but I didn't have any problems. This is right in the middle of the city, so if you are light sleeper, ear plugs would do you just fine. "
397117,12436473,2014-05-02,7965808,Kane,"Lauren was a gracious host to me when I came. Her home is lovely and the street sounds are not bothersome, actually they are soothing. Very clean and in an excellent location close to Pike Place, various parks, and the Space Needle all within walking distance. There's also a taxi stand in front of the building so you'll never have to worry about needing a ride."
397117,12709309,2014-05-09,10397004,Rob,"Positive experience all round. Perfect location in Seattle CBD, with easy access to most of the city. Comfortable apartment with everything you need to feel at home. Lauren was a great host: friendly, easily contactable and helpful when it came to managing a late arrival due to a missed flight connection."
397117,12793990,2014-05-11,14568068,Steve,"This is everything listed and more. The charm of the rooms and host are welcoming. Lauren was a real help. We like to walk and were concerned with the Seattle hills. She was very helpful in pointing out how to access downtown easily without the hills. It worked out great. Walking to Pikes Market, the Underground, restaurants and more was a breeze. The character & charm of the apartment is nothing like a cookie cutter hotel room. Well worth it and we'll be back. This also was the first time using airbnb. The experience was great with the help of Lauren. She was very responsive and helpful."
397117,12995739,2014-05-17,9623754,Sally,"This was our first AirBnb experience and I don't know that any other will ever live up to it! My husband and I loved Lauren (she's friendly, charming and completely hilarious) and we loved this apartment. The suite is beautiful, clean, and in an ideal location in downtown Seattle. We walked to the waterfront (you can see the water from your bedroom window!), multiple grocery stores and tons of restaurants. It's also really, really close to public transit, and we were able to get to Capitol Hill within like 15 minutes. I can't recommend Lauren and her gorgeous apartment highly enough!"
397117,13062857,2014-05-19,11081908,Amber,"This was our first experience with Airbnb, and Lauren made it a great one!  She is super responsive, helpful, and incredibly nice and easy to work with.  Her place is in a great location (walkable to everything), and has all the amenities you need.  It's clean and cute--what more could you ask for!  Highly recommend!"
397117,13210122,2014-05-22,12730936,Gladys,Highly recommended.  Lauren is a fabulous host and this is lovely apartment that is centrally located in Seattle.  We were able to walk almost everywhere easily or take a cab from the taxi stand on the same block.  Apartment has great sunlight and views of the harbor - reminds me of Carrie Bradshaw's apt with its high ceiling and lovely hardwood floors. We would definitely stay here again.
397117,13267124,2014-05-24,6436408,Bronwyn,Lauren was a great host. She was waiting for us after our late flight. She had spare air bed ready for our extra guest. The apartment is well located and we walked everywhere for the 3 days we were there. Would recommend to our friends and definitely stay there again. 
397117,13321203,2014-05-25,15081602,Owen,"An absolute gem! Lauren was incredibly helpful, and her place is absolutely perfect! Super location and a comfy place to rest your head. A serious steal for the price, looking forward to staying there again! "
397117,13467289,2014-05-28,2946322,Rachal,Lauren was super helpful and sweet! She made sure we were settled and had lots of tips for us. We highly recommend staying here!
397117,13819115,2014-06-05,14523424,Catherine,Lauren is such a awesome host! Super chill and got right to the point. Her apartment was major comfortable and has just the right amount of space. We really loved the apartment and location. Lauren answers quickly and was accomodating to us. Will definitely consider her place again. :D 
397117,14144392,2014-06-13,5869279,Kim,"Great little apartment. In an older building but adds character. We did not rent a car, but were able to walk to get places. Some attractions are not as close as others but doable. Lauren was fantastic. Always available if we had questions and had a lot of info on the city and public transit. Great place to stay with an awesome host!"
397117,14221808,2014-06-15,693446,Norman,The apartment was fantastic ... the period decor and building structure especially struck a chord with me (the bay window overlooking the street view was awesome!!).  Everything to hand one could ask or hope for ... comfortable and homey.  We'd definitely want to stay here again if ever back in Town.
397117,14335229,2014-06-17,8460736,Jessica,"Lauren is the perfect host. She is friendly and knowledgeable and so approachable if you have any questions. The apartment is lovely, we walked everywhere from it. We would have loved to have stayed longer! Would 100% recommend to anyone."
397117,14433163,2014-06-19,1258006,Alice,"We had a great time at Lauren's apartment in Seattle!  The location is absolutely fantastic - it is right in between Pioneer Square (bars, bars, bars!) and the more touristy areas near Pike's Market.  We were able to walk everywhere with ease.

The apartment was clean and bright.  We were very comfortable.  The bed is not huge - so if you need room to sleep, you might have to use the pull-out sofa for the second person."
397117,14898689,2014-06-29,11046696,Mary,"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle.  Lauren greeted us when we were dropped off and took us up to the apartment to show us around and give us info.  We were comfortable the week we stayed here and Lauren was very helpful in giving us restaurant tips, grocery shopping tips and how to get around the city.  The apartment is in a historical building so it has that historical ""charm"".  We would recommend this place if you need a convenient place to stay in Seattle.  My husband had a conference at the Conference Center and it was a very easy, short walk for him.  I enjoyed being close enough to walk to Pike Place Market and other sites around the city.  Thanks to Lauren for helping to make our stay in Seattle a memorable one!"
397117,14957522,2014-06-30,10972995,Lamont,Lauren was terrific.  Was very helpful getting us settled. A perfect host.
397117,15042106,2014-07-01,6866350,Jon,Lauren was the perfect host and her condo was the ideal spot for our family trip to Seattle.  The condo was very clean and we felt very comfortable during our stay.  Highly recommend this condo to everyone. Thx again Lauren.
397117,15481250,2014-07-10,7903096,Brian,"Excellent location, major hotels only  a few blocks away. Lauren was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Probably best to get  a cab, not like me and drag a bag uphill from nearest station. Also I suggest loading up with quarters if you want to use washing and drying facilities. Lauren offered to help but I was able to get some. Being  a foreigner I had been getting rid of small change where possible. The motorway traffic noise could be a drawback for some but I became use to it after the first night. "
397117,15561362,2014-07-11,3741776,Jacob,"Lauren was great!  Showed us around and was fun to talk to!  Also gave us great directions on how to avoid walking up too many hills. :)  The area was really close to everything we needed, and easy to get to from I5.  

Host also has a great collection of books, if you are there long enough to read them."
397117,15668803,2014-07-14,1516962,Lauren,"I can't say enough to explain how glad we are to have stayed at Lauren's apartment. The apartment was in a great location, just up the street from the water taxi and an easy walk to the market. The apartment itself is in a charming, safe, and secure building. The interior is spacious with everything we needed. And finally the host - Lauren was an accommodating and generous host and helped us celebrate our anniversary. She didn't miss a beat when I told her our inconvenient check-in and check out times and gave us great recommendations for restaurants. We will definitely stay here again if we return to Seattle. "
397117,15810651,2014-07-16,10179579,Kathryn,"We had an incredible stay in Seattle at Lauren's apartment! She was very easy to work with and prompt in responding to us. When we arrived, she met us outside and showed us around the apartment, gave us the key, and filled us in on the city and answered all of our questions.

The space was perfect for the two of us, and even had a view of the water in the distance. Although we didn't use the kitchen, it was fully stocked with everything you would need to cook a meal (except the food of course).

The only downside to the apartment is that it had no air conditioning — which would normally be completely comfortable, but the weekend we visited, Seattle had unusually high temps in the 90s.

Overall it was a great stay! We especially liked that it was walking distance to everything we wanted to do in town."
397117,15901607,2014-07-18,723755,Theresa,"Lauren was a great hostess and her apartment was very cute and clean, and in a great location downtown. The apartment building had a lot of historic charm and we never heard a peep from the neighbors! It's a great spot to rent! Thanks Lauren for your hospitality!! "
397117,16072811,2014-07-22,5529435,Liisa,"Lauren was superb! We arrived late at night and she greeted us warmly. The apartment is everything we could have asked for: spacious, full-equiped kitchen, comfy bed, excellent view and close to downtown, bus lines & services. The Columbia Tower is just around the corner to enjoy the views and Starbucks' coffee on the 40th floor :)

Lauren has made excellent instructions and anything else u need to find out is available on the web, through the wi-fi offered by Lauren. Parking was easily found next to the building. I recommend this place for anyone visiting beautiful Seattle. We drove up to Canada and the I-5 was 1min drive away. "
397117,16338514,2014-07-26,3468466,Mary,"We arrived into Seattle via Amtrak.  Lauren was waiting for us upon our arrival.  She is very sweet and was willing to go above and beyond to make our stay pleasant.  The apartment was clean and very comfortable and we enjoyed coming ""home"" each night knowing we could have space to spread out.  The neighborhood was very good.  Lots of places to eat within walking distance.  There is a coffee shop right next door at the Renaissance Seattle Hotel, there were always taxi's to be found and the tours we booked actually picked us up in front of the hotel.  
We had a red eye on the return and Lauren was more than willing to allow us to store our bags all day if we wanted to.  We opted to change our flights and departed during the day.  All in all this was a very enjoyable stay in Seattle and Lauren was a big part of making it so.
I will recommend her to my clients. ( I'm a travel agent)"
397117,16574397,2014-07-29,16883953,Brendan,Great place close to all the sightseeing. Lauren was very accommodating and the apt was very clean. We had a wonderful overnight much better than a downtown hotel.
397117,16601754,2014-07-30,12405558,Leslie,"Lauren waited patiently for our arrival, even though we were half an hour late.  She gave detailed instruction about her place, and even invited us to a soccer game.

The apartment is in a historic building, which lends it tremendous charm.  It's located a block away from the Seattle Public Library and within walking distance to the Pike Market."
397117,17143948,2014-08-08,13848505,Erik,Lauren was very responsive and helpful to ensure we arrived at her apartment easily. She was willing to help in any way she could. Definitely would recommend. 
397117,17496965,2014-08-13,11682111,Joris,"We had a great four night stay at Lauren's lovely, cosy place in Seattle, nearby all downtown attractions, restaurants and even Capitol Hill area is walkable! In the appartment, you'll find everything you need for a relaxed stay in this great city. Thanks Lauren!"
397117,17620977,2014-08-15,12222319,Lushi,"Lauren was the best host I ever met. Also, the place was clean and nice.
I will definitely go back to Seattle again to visit her in the near future :)"
397117,17741924,2014-08-17,13658959,Pip,"We loved it here! Lauren was a delight from start to finish. And the apartment was great also - roomy, comfy and in a great location. Close to pike place and the stadium - Go Seahawks! Would highly recommend staying here, we had a great time and Lauren really was a fantastic host. We will stay here again if we come back to the states for sure!  "
397117,17933546,2014-08-19,12486483,Davida,"Great location. Walkable to the waterfront, Pike's Market, and other attractions. Cute and fun apartment. Lauren was easy to communicate with and gave us great restaurant recommendations. She knows the city well. Nice stay. "
397117,18045379,2014-08-20,20187839,Molly,Lauren was extremely accommodating! Great experience
397117,18121374,2014-08-22,6897530,Emily,"The host was friendly and accessible. She worked with us on check-in and check-out, and she made us feel right at home. We didn't spend much time in the place, but we were very satisfied. It was clean and beautiful, with lost of charm! We'd recommend this host to anyone!"
397117,18301002,2014-08-25,7196712,Aj,"We had an emergency which altered our travel plans and arrival times and Lauren was quite accommodating and kind. She was flexible with our departure time which was greatly appreciated.
The apartment is located right next to I5 which makes for easy in and out of the city. The sound of traffic didn't really bother me, it sounds like a constant breeze which becomes more of a background noise.
Located right next door to a major hotel where you can get fresh coffee in the morning if you don't want to bother making your own. Easy walk to everywhere. Straight down the hill to the ferry to Bainbridge Island."
397117,18517866,2014-08-28,11579539,Camille,Lauren was extremely accommodating. We flew in early and she was nice enough to meet us before the check in time and take our luggage off of our hands. She answered all of our questions and gave us recommendations about places to see. The apartment is clean and is in a great location. The combination of the fan and the breeze from the ocean coming in through the windows felt wonderful considering the summer heat.
397117,18618388,2014-08-29,12524718,Alice,"Lauren was incredibly helpful and nice. She went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable and stressless. Due to our own negligence, we ran into some issues and had to leave our luggage in the room past checkout time until evening. Lauren was extremely understanding and helped us with this. The apartment itself is lovely! There's also a lot of amenities, including a curling iron haha. It's also in a great location. My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We will definitely be coming back!"
397117,18934560,2014-09-03,5856151,Gill,"My stay in Lauren's apartment was very comfortable.  All the necessities are provided and Lauren was available by phone if I had any questions.
Entry to the building is easy and, as there is a hotel next door, you'll always find a taxi just outside.
Seattle's shopping/tourist sites are all within walking distance.
Thanks, Lauren, for your hospitality.  I'll definitely keep you in mind if I'm back in Seattle."
397117,18997138,2014-09-04,3058917,Lindsay,"Lauren was great! She met us outside the building to show us where to go and give us keys. She had many great recommendations about where to eat and what to see, as well as how to get there. The apartment was very clean and comfortable in  a great area. Next to a hotel, so plenty of cabs anytime you need one. "
397117,19117113,2014-09-07,5055150,David Scott,"Lauren's apartment was great for our three nights in Seattle! It was perfectly located in a really cool, old building downtown - a great feel for being in Seattle. The apartment was bright and sunny (okay, we were there in September - the sunniest part of Seattle's year) and there was plenty of space for the two of us. We even entertained friends for dinner (note: there is no dining table - we used the coffee table). The bed was really comfortable and, yes, there is noise from I-5, but we always travel with earplugs. Really, if you are staying in a large metropolitan city, noise is to be expected. There were lots of great books to read when we were resting after our long walks, and Lauren was the best host - always offering to help us in any way. She met us at the apartment and communication with her was great. "
397117,19211256,2014-09-08,6117470,Christina,"Lauren and her apartment were great! She was very responsive and easy to stay in touch with. She met my friends and I in front of the building, gave us a tour of her apartment, left us a list of things we might need nearby, and even left us extra towels just in case we might need them. The location was the best, just a 15min walk to Pike Place Market. Overall the apartment was very clean, cozy, and comfortable."
397117,19668301,2014-09-16,15757791,Gary,Lauren is a great host and made us feel welcome right from the start. The apartment is centrally located and is very clean and tidy. Would recommend staying here to anyone wanting to visit Seattle. Bear in mind the apartment is in an old building so does not necessarily have all mod cons but bearing in mind the price its is an excellent place to stay. Traffic is noisy and there is no double glazing but if you are a city dweller non of this should be a problem.
397117,19923525,2014-09-21,15966558,Jeffrey,"TLDR version: AMAZING!

Arrangements: Lauren was beyond helpful communicating with us as we arrived in Seattle and made our way to her place.

Arrival: Upon arrival, Lauren met us outside and welcomed us into her apartment. All amenities were taken care of and I really felt like we had access to everything we could possibly need. She had extra towels, a handly blowdryer for my wife and she even had a few beers in the fridge. 

The neighbourhood was very safe and accessible. We were able to cab, Uber and use public transit equally well. Her apartment is a quick 10-15 minute walk to Pike and 1st which is a great hub for tourism. There are a bunch of great local restaurants nearby.

The apartment was clean and tidy and she had a great guide for getting around Seattle. A lot of light and a very warm home to rest at while taking a break from the city.

Leaving: Wrap-up was a breeze and Lauren was beyond accessible (although we didn't need her much). We are about a 5-10 minute walk to the light rail that took us to the airport ($5 total for both of us). 

I hesitate to leave such a nice review because we will DEFINITELY try to rent from Lauren again and I would hate to have competition. But we had such a great stay, it is only fair!


"
397117,20223270,2014-09-26,12194805,Kathryn,Lauren was very helpful.  Our flight was delayed and we had a very late arrival.  She was very easy to work with and very flexible with our delay.
397117,20329211,2014-09-28,10828465,Jane,"Our stay with Lauren in Seattle was WONDERFUL! Lauren came and met us when we arrived (in advance of check-in, mind you!) and was so incredibly accommodating. The place is great. It was SO NICE to have a bit of extra space and to have a kitchen! We didn't cook any meals, but a good place to store snacks! The apartment has everything you might need. Even a hair dryer! And it is so central to everything downtown Seattle has to offer. We walked everywhere. THANK YOU!"
397117,20556587,2014-10-01,16698663,Jeremiah,"Our host was very helpful in getting us set up in the apartment. Great views, clean, convenient location downtown!"
397117,20946251,2014-10-08,11765039,Joseph,"Lauren was such a great host! She was fun and friendly, very accommodating to any of our needs. Her space was awesome! Perfect location, GREAT city view from the bedroom window, and best of all walking distance of all the must sees of Seattle city life. If we ever make it back we will def be looking her up again."
397117,21045775,2014-10-10,3343229,Niki,"We had a short stay, but the apt was ver accommodating and in a great location. Lauren was very helpful too! Thanks!"
397117,21354141,2014-10-15,20869793,Mark,Lauren was an awesome host and her place was very quaint and clean. It is in an awesome location. My wife and I really enjoyed our time there. Seattle is an awesome city!
397117,21462633,2014-10-18,19933070,Kimmie,"Lauren was a great host-very friendly, very attentive, and definitely made us feel welcomed! My best friend and I decided to explore Seattle and this location was prime to get that job done. It was within walking distance of many great landmarks and within a short taxi/uber distance away from many other great areas of Seattle we toured. The apartment was clean, had a lot of character, and was more than enough space for the two of us! After a full day of walking around and resting up before exploring the night life, we enjoyed utilizing the apartment's wifi, cable, and lovely selection of books!! 

Thank you for everything Lauren!!!

397117,21558626,2014-10-19,5147918,Jonny,"We had a great time staying at Lauren's place! It was very conveniently located and the perfect size for two people. 
Plus, Lauren was a phenomenal host! She was friendly, responsive, and helpful. I would happily recommend staying at her place."
397117,21659267,2014-10-21,5740688,Anita,"Lauren was a great host.  She always kept in contact with me in prior to my visit.  She gave very detailed instructions about her apartment and if I needed anything or had any questions, she was willing to help.  The apt was a great location, within 10-15 minute walking distance to major attractions in the downtown area.  The apartment had all the essentials that we would need.  There's construction going on right now but I was always awake before it started and I never spent too much time in the apt to realize the noise.  Absolutely great place to stay if you're visiting Seattle."
397117,21748288,2014-10-23,1801276,Delanie,"This was a great apartment for two people. We walked everywhere to see the basic sites (most within 2 miles) and the area was SO easy to navigate. (There's also plenty of public transportation options if walking isn't your thing)
Lauren, the host, was amazing. She was totally accommodating to our arrival and departure schedule and gave us the BEST restaurant recommendation for dinner.  The apartment was basic and cozy and exactly what you need. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat. Getting to and from the airport was beyond easy. If you are just doing basic tourist stuff, don't wast your money on a car rental."
397117,21936883,2014-10-27,8750113,Brooke,"Lauren is the best host I've ever met on airbnb, and I've traveled with airbnb a lot.  She was warm, friendly, answered all my questions.  She was extremely helpful with getting me to her apt via text messaging and told me how to take the light rail from the airport, none of which she had to take the time to do.  When I arrived, I got there early and she grabbed my bags for me while the apt was finished cleaning.  She made sure I had everything I could possibly need before leaving me to explore seattle on my own.  I would highly recommend her and her apt.  Great stay, thanks again for everything!"
397117,22090847,2014-10-29,235099,Liza,Lauren was super friendly and accommodating!  The space was very clean and it's a great neighborhood to be in too! 
397117,22333241,2014-11-03,8804842,Gian,I was only there for a short time but it was a great place. Lauren was incredibly helpful and met me outside and took me through everything. Will definitely stay again - next time for longer!
397117,22484042,2014-11-08,16464419,Matt,"Lauren welcomed me to the apartment with a complete tour.  She went out of her way to make sure that I knew all of the amenities the apartment offered and what was in the area.  Having visited Seattle a few times I had a good idea what was around, but I learned a few things I didn't already know.  Lauren also provides a laminated sheet of valuable information so that you have key information conveniently available for reference.
The apartment is located in a nice neighborhood close to I-5 and just a few blocks from the Washington State Convention Center.  There is some traffic noise from I-5, but that was just background noise that didn't impact my stay.
The apartment building is over 100 years old and still retains much of the character associated with a building of that age.  There is even a good view down the road to the water.
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would recommend it for anyone looking for some old world charm just a few blocks from all the downtown action."
397117,22583399,2014-11-10,70868,Mei & Candace,"Lauren was great and super friendly!  Welcomed us personally into the condo, and had recommendations for local grocer and eateries.  Easy to communicate with.  The condo was well equipped, a little snug for 4, (the air mattress was not a hit, lol) - but would be perfect for a couple!

Easy walking distance to Century Link Field and shopping, plus got our fix for Pike place (Crab Pot).  

It can get a little noisy as its close to highway, but not excessively so.
"
397117,22825311,2014-11-16,17934224,Tatum,"As this was our first Airbnb experience, Lauren was totally awesome! Even though check in is in the afternoon, Lauren helped watch our bags and delivered them to our room while we walked around since our flight landed so early. She was super welcoming and helpful. The neighborhood was in a perfect location - 10 min walk to Pike Market and right next to a cab line up. The apartment was very cute and had all of the necessities. If I lived in Seattle, I would love to live in this complex. Thank you again Lauren for everything! 
"
397117,22918023,2014-11-17,21270733,Josh,Great location. Great host. I'd recommend to anyone! 
397117,23263975,2014-11-27,8762347,Dennis,"Lauren made us feel quite at ease and guided us into the apartment during the pouring rain.  The apartment was quite cozy with the 12 foot ceilings, with plenty of windows, and a natural wood floor.  Location is within 30 minutes walking distance to the Stadiums, the wharf, Pike Place, and the monorail to the Space Needle.  One warning in that the apartment is on top of Mars Hill before the I5, so expect a 30 Degree climb up the hill from 2nd Ave.  Definitely check out the Seattle Underground Tour if you can."
397117,23641738,2014-12-07,8292422,Evan,Totally charming apartment with an equally charming and accommodating hostess. We had a lot of travel issues on the way there and Lauren went out of her way to make sure the lodging portion of our trip was totally friction-free. Highly recommend!
397117,23808960,2014-12-11,16687719,Hugh,"Lauren was absolutely fantastic. She is very organised and kind, everything was organised and easy. The apartment was fantastic and in a great location. I hope to return soon. "
397117,24405855,2014-12-28,5799447,Pat,"The apartment was in a great location, easy walking distance to downtown, the ballparks, Capitol Hill, the waterfront, etc.  Lauren was a great host, was there to greet me on arrival, explained all aspects of the unit, and was friendly and helpful.  The unit has lots of character, big windows, and high ceilings.  Very comfy.  Would stay again, for sure!"
397117,25179124,2015-01-08,23547502,Drew,Lauren was very friendly and accommodating! She is very connected and easy to communicate / meet with. When an unforeseen issue came up with the room she went out of her way to immediately make it right. The room itself is great. The kitchen was very nice and the location could not be better for my purposes. There was a bit of road noise - not a problem for me but bring earplugs if you are very sensitive.
397117,25306049,2015-01-12,20705162,Brett,Lauren was the best and the most helpful host. She couldn't do more to help us. 
397117,25457161,2015-01-16,12124214,Ben,"My stay was short but sweet. Lauren was very nice and welcoming. She accommodated my early arrival, which was a relief after many days on the road. The apartment was well-located for me as I was coming and going via train. The bed was comfortable, and I slept like a stone."
397117,26042267,2015-02-02,3361110,Sarah,Thank you Lauren for a nice extended stay at the apartment. The location was ideal for us! :)
397117,26594344,2015-02-16,13967742,Meg,"Lauren was great, friendly and communicative! Myself and my friends had a great time at the apartment; it's cozy and was in the perfect location for us. I'd recommend it!"
397117,26739058,2015-02-18,12059324,Wesley,"Host was great! Did everything to make sure we were well taken care of. Unfortunately a bit loud due to the consutrction occuring outside. Besides that, great location and services."
397117,26929421,2015-02-22,1829822,Aaliyah,"Lauren was a very welcoming host and reliably prompt in responding to my inquiries. Her manner is relaxed and easy going. For another plus, the location could not be more central-- all of downtown and capitol hill are well within walking distance. I feel obliged to state one slight negative... As for the flat itself, it was more tidy than clean. There was some residue on the bath mat and other bathroom fixtures for example. This may not be the right choice for those who prefer living spaces with a sterile feel. Also, the washer and dryer are not in the unit itself but instead are in the basement and available on a coin-operated basis. All in all I had a good stay and would be happy to return. "
397117,27203642,2015-02-28,20994006,Tristan,"Lauren was very responsive throughout the planning process of our trip. She gave excellent directions to the apartment and was waiting outside when we got there. The apartment was adorable and just as the pictures showed. 
The apartment is within walking distance to pretty much everything downtown. It's also very close to the light rail. 
The only negative thing about the apartment is that it's located near a busy road and noise from the traffic would sometimes carry up. Also, there was construction going on in the lot right outside the bedroom window while we were there. If you're a light sleeper you might want to bring earplugs. This definitely wouldn't deter us from staying again though. This was a cute apartment that was perfect for our 3 day stay. Lauren was an excellent host. I would highly recommend staying in any of her listings."
397117,27665107,2015-03-09,17939542,Padraic,"Lauren was great.  She was in contact with me as soon as I landed.  After getting off the light rail she waited for me outside to make sure I was in the right place.  After a tour of the apartment, she made herself available at any time if needed.  All major points of interest were easy and very accessible!"
397117,28307351,2015-03-22,12451771,Stephanie,Lauren was a fantastic host! Easy to get in contact with and really knows her city. She's a great resource for the weekend warriors. 
397117,28516077,2015-03-25,26309254,Maggie,Lauren was a great host and the apartment was perfect for our short trip to Seattle. Lauren was very helpful and accommodating--she met us when we arrived early in Seattle and held onto our bags until the apartment was ready. The apartment was just as pictured. It is a great location within walking distance to downtown and capitol hill. 
397117,28606057,2015-03-27,12378355,Will,A great stay in an apartment that had everything I needed.
397117,28693450,2015-03-29,16247321,Krystine,"Lauren was amazing, and the apartment was beautiful, and completely convenient. I would absolutely stay here again. Thank you for making our trip perfect!"
397117,29157237,2015-04-05,46446,Katherine,"Lauren was a fantastic host - easy to contact and very helpful. The apartment was located in the perfect place to explore Downton Seattle. A lovely apartment - clean, tidy and really well laid out.
Thanks so much Lauren!"
397117,29541142,2015-04-09,23603981,Matt,"Lauren was a great host, welcoming and helpful. The apartment had everything you need (from a hairdryer to kitchen condiments for  cooking), was very cosy and secure, within a lovely building. Some city/street noise could be heard, but it wasn't an issue considering the fantastic location! Right next to Seattle's wonderful public library designed by Rem Koolhaas, and walking distance to the lively Pike Place Market, both must sees. Thanks Lauren for everything!"
397117,30072345,2015-04-17,27896895,Laurie,"Headed to Seattle for two nights for a conference and decided to try Airbnb for the first time. Took the train, which arrived just after 10 pm. Lauren had recommended that I take taxi which came to about $6. She and I were in contact via text and she met me at front of the apartment building. Lauren was very welcoming, friendly and provided some recommendations for late night eats. Her apartment is very centrally located, nicely furnished and clean. Loved flipping through the interesting titles on the bookshelf. Kitchen was well equipped with dishes, pots, pans, a toaster, spices and condiments. Comfy furniture in the living room and cable TV with lots of channels. Bathroom was stocked with little bottles of shampoo, conditioner and lotion. The only downside was some noise from heavy-duty trucks on Madison Street and the construction next door. However, I was able to sleep fine with earbuds playing white noise. Lauren was available nearby if I needed anything. I felt very taken care of! Thanks Lauren for a lovely stay."
397117,30442585,2015-04-22,575633,Ryder & Amanda,"My two colleagues and I stayed at Lauren's apartment for five days and it was perfect! We were afraid the space might be too small for the three of us, but it was just right. We loved having a kitchen and being able to walk to the Washington State Conference Center for our conference event. 

Lauren met us at the door and was ready to help us with everything!! She was super responsive and kind about providing anything we needed. We would highly recommend staying with Lauren to see the sites or if you need to stay somewhere for a conference! This place is great!"
397117,31035396,2015-05-01,27602469,Judith,"After a hideous 24 hour journey, Lauren greeted us with a big hug and a bottle of wine. The pictures on AirBnB don't do justice to the apartment - a beautiful period building, stylish but understated interior and gives you a real feel of what it's like to live in Seattle/the USA. Lauren was great, on hand for any questions, charming, funny and kind. Great location for all sights etc - we walked everywhere. Incredibly flexible on arrival and leaving times, which made a huge difference on both sides of our journey. Highly recommended. "
397117,31281613,2015-05-04,8846234,Marja,Lauren was so accommodating.  We needed a place to leave our luggage before check-in time and she had no problem letting us do that.  The apartment is so centrally located.  It's a great place to stay.  We hope we'll come back.
397117,32157486,2015-05-15,3885185,Susannah,"Lauren's place was fantastic-it had all the home comforts a traveller needs including a hair dryer and olive oil so you can really enjoy your stay! The views are perfect and everything is in walking distance - the sports fields, ferries, EMP, transport and shops and there are even taxis right outside the door of the building. It was so awesome to stay in an old-style apartment building too! Lauren was so friendly and welcoming and helped us out with foodie advice and we felt comfortable contacting her with questions. The noise from outside is pretty constant however we were so tired from exploring beautiful Seattle each day it wasn't much of a problem. Thanks Lauren!"
397117,32962697,2015-05-24,27837621,Jocelyn,"Lauren was very helpful in regards to navigating Seattle and accessing apartment. Apartment was perfectly sized and equipped for long weekend trip. Location was great, but there was construction going on right outside the bedroom window.  I did not enjoy the low water pressure in shower."
397117,34113397,2015-06-05,20746131,Michel,"Lauren nous a très bien accueillis. Elle s'est montrée disponible. On ne peut lui faire que des compliments. Quartier d'affaires, un peu mort le soir. Le bruit de l'Interstate était prévu, mais i y avait aussi des travaux qui commençaient tôt le matin. C'est dommage car l'appartement, très bien décrit, nous convenait parfaitement. Hors ces questions de bruit, nous sommes très satisfaits."
397117,34928424,2015-06-14,23051304,Christine,"Lauren was an amazing host. She was so accommodating and had great recommendations for what to do in Seattle. The apartment was perfect for our needs, clean and close to just about everything. Lauren was great with communication and even helped us find parking! Lauren went above and beyond our expectations. I highly recommend staying in this apartment! "
397117,35340626,2015-06-17,35246806,Kevin,Apartment was just as described. Lauren was very accommodating even with our late arrival. Great place to crash in downtown Seattle.
397117,35455927,2015-06-19,26069707,Kira,"This place was great. Lauren was super helpful and the her apartment was clean, convenient and very centrally located! I would recommend this place to anyone coming through Seattle"
397117,35635423,2015-06-21,27807315,Rick,"Central location of apt was great, right in the heart of Seattle.  On booking our host, Lauren, contacted us with helpful directions and greeted us warmly upon our arrival.  (Very easy to get to from light rail.)  A bit of street noise, felt very safe, and had a view of the water."
397117,36002117,2015-06-24,28858593,Jennifer,Perfect space and location for our stay!
397117,36257698,2015-06-27,7340515,Mitch,"Lauren was so helpful.
She met us at the apartment, then told us all about the local area.
She lived very close by and was easily contactable if need be.
If we come back to Seattle we will definitely stay here again."
397117,36511971,2015-06-29,11349653,Vicky,"Lauren's apartment is at the great location, if you dont have a car, you will be able to reach at lot of places within walking distance. The decoration style of the room is very romantic. My parents and I like it a lot!"
397117,36757955,2015-07-01,23251112,Daryll,"I had a great time staying at Lauren's place. She was very accommodating and flexible. We were able to check in and check out hours earlier/later than what was on the reservation. The place is just as listed. It's quaint and very charming. Perfect for two people! The bed is super comfortable and relaxing after the exploring Seattle. Do know that there is some construction going on right next to the building. It didn't bother us but for some it may be a problem. She gave great directions from the link station to her place. You are able to walk to some attractions and food places but just be prepared for some very steep hills. Overall, it was a great first Airbnb experience! Thanks Lauren!"
397117,36857083,2015-07-02,25395224,Shannon,We loved Lauren's apartment. The location is great for exploring the city and Lauren was a great help in suggesting places to go out for dinner and sight-see. 
397117,37048976,2015-07-04,31305809,Nick,"Lauren was great and reached out to me prior to my reservation to sort out details. The space is located at a prime location near Pikes Market and the water; it is very centralized to all the touristy stuff. The apartment is very spacious and clean, and Lauren met us outside upon arrival with a parking pass so we wouldn't have to pay for street parking. Ultra deal of all time. "
397117,37545760,2015-07-08,18668658,Sarah,"My boyfriend and I spent 4 nights in Seattle. It was our first time here and we very much enjoyed our vacation. Lauren was very accommodating, allowing us to drop our bags off early as we had an early flight into the city. She was easy to contact through text or through the AirB&B app. The place was perfect. The bed was extremely comfortable. We didn't cook at all because we wanted to take advantage of all the wonderful restaurants Seattle has to offer, but it seemed as though the kitchen was well equipped. The location is very central. We walked to most places. We took the subway to and from the airport and to a couple of ball games. We also used Uber to get to a couple of restaurants and home from Alki beach (we took the passenger ferry there). Warning: if you are looking for a quiet place to stay this is not it! This apartment is located centrally in downtown Seattle. You can hear traffic and sirens. It was worth it for us because we wanted to stay downtown, but it was a bit noisy for sleeping. Unfortunately there was some construction going on, which made the noise even louder, but this is the luck of the draw and we managed to get a good sleep most nights. Bring ear plugs just in case! In the end we very much enjoyed our stay and would stay here again. "
397117,37670510,2015-07-09,32779132,Laura,"GREAT location, adorable decorations and art. Lauren was very helpful with recommendations and help with parking. The place was nicer than the pictures"
397117,37745585,2015-07-10,32220210,Hilary,"We had a great stay in this apartment. It is within a ten-minute walk to Pikes Place Market and most other downtown attractions. The apartment itself is clean and it's great to have access to a full kitchen while staying in Seattle. One of the buildings next door is being renovated so it was noisy from 7am onwards - the freeway is also quite noisy overnight. For the price and location you can deal with the noise as you won't likely be spending much time in the apartment while exploring the city. Lauren was a gracious host and made sure we had settled in and didn't need anything. There are a number of bookshelves in the apartment with tourist and non-tourist books available for reading. One note on the actual building - it's old and smells like old floor varnish. This can be quite off-putting when you first walk into the building, but once you're in Lauren's actual apartment you can't notice it very much. The apartment itself is very clean and bright - not at all like the building entry or hallways. Thanks Lauren!"
397117,38096026,2015-07-13,26478696,Kym,Lauren's place was conveniently located in the business district of Seattle. Everything was within walking distance and her place was clean and cozy. She was an amazing help in getting us to where we needed to go and was always readily available. Thanks Lauren!
397117,38297652,2015-07-14,1374526,Catt,"This charming and spotless flat is located in easy walking distance of...well, pretty much everything in downtown Seattle, with bus lines nearby if you're heading farther afield. The stunning view almost escapes notice since it's in the bedroom nook, but don't miss it. Strong internet and good water pressure in the shower cover the essentials of life, and the minimalist kitchen was enough for our short stay. Lauren is wonderfully accommodating, and helped us out when we needed to leave luggage after check out so we could go to a meeting. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat!"
397117,38480541,2015-07-16,16441884,Jennifer,"We had a fantastic stay at Lauren's apartment in Seattle!  She was so responsive and helpful, even greeting us on our arrival and offering advice.  The apartment is just as described...cute, comfortable and convenient to everything.  It is in an older building with lots of character and high ceilings.  There is construction nearby, but the crew was always finished early and there was no noise to interrupt sleep.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!"
397117,38982877,2015-07-20,17009586,Alan,"The apartment was perfect, with a comfy bed in a great location! Lauren is friendly, accommodating, and answered all my questions promptly. Highly recommended :)"
397117,39609233,2015-07-25,30594839,Hannah,"We had a lovely stay at Lauren's place. She made us feel very welcome - even waiting up for us to arrive from our overnight flight from the UK! The apartment was clean, ideally located and provided all the amenities that we required. 

Lauren was great at recommending things to do and restaurants to eat at! Would happily recommend to anyone wanting to stay in Downtown area of Seattle "
397117,40116355,2015-07-28,34919412,Heidi,"Lauren was great!  Right there to meet us and get us settled in.  Very nice apt.  Clean, great location.  I would say the only negative thing is that if you are a light sleeper I would bring ear plugs and a sound machine.  Very busy area and construction that starts very early right next to apt building.  Other than that, I would highly recommend this apt and Lauren!  "
397117,40428417,2015-07-31,14968802,Sara,"It all about location within a ten-minute walk to Pikes Place Market and most other attractions.

One of the buildings next door is being renovated so it was noisy from 7am onwards - the freeway is also quite noisy overnight, but for the price and location you can deal.

397117,40612333,2015-08-01,34956701,Scott,Lauren was so nice and accommodating. Great location. Her place was very clean and organized. The view from the bedroom was unbelievable. She made sure we had everything we needed and even offered to pick something up for us. When we come back to Seattle we will definitely stay here again. It was wonderful! Would recommend to all!
397117,41572382,2015-08-08,25338835,Melissa,"We enjoyed our stay at Lauren's apartment. We found the apartment very clean and spacious. Lauren was great to deal with and very easy going. The apartment was within walking distance to Pike Market and the city centre. Unfortunately there was construction noise adjacent to the building that started early morning but otherwise it was an enjoyable stay.
"
397117,42148388,2015-08-11,8687388,Michelle,"A+++ Very cool apartment in a perfect location!  Lauren is an excellent host- easy to talk to, full of recommendations , and super helpful.  Apartment is clean and comfortable in a nice building with charm.  Perfect for a couple looking for a nice stay in downtown Seattle, walkable to all points of interest, no car necessary.  Some reviews mentioned the noise... Its no more than you would expect from any city, but if you are not used to the white noise of passing cars and the occasional siren, then you may want to consider ear plugs.  We slept great with windows open and were not bothered at all. Wish we were staying longer!!  Highly recommend!"
397117,42824706,2015-08-16,30672459,Amanda,A cute place near every tourist attraction. You can walk to Safeco and pikes place from the apartment. Nice place to go back to after a long day of walking around and seeing the city. Seattle is full of hills; if you aren't into walking there are almost always cabs right outside of the apartment too. The only downfall I would say is the construction. The regular street noise is easy to fall asleep to. Early in the morning the construction crew starts banging right next door. That isn't in her control though! She was great. 
397117,43140029,2015-08-17,5985986,Emily,"Lauren was a great host! We came in late, but she still gave us a warm welcome to the apartment. She even had an air mattress prepared even though I only told her earlier that day that a friend would be joining us. The apartment is next to a highway but centrally located and has guidebooks too for perusing the area."
397117,43360601,2015-08-19,16273602,Roger,"Lauren was very helpful and considerate both on our arrival and during our 2 day stay. We arrived early on the plane from Honolulu and were able to leave our luggage on arrival at her unit while she sorted out the cleaning for an hour and we had some breakfast. We were able to move in to the unit early which allowed us to unpack and then begin our tour of Seattle.
The unit is on a noisy road but you got used to it after a while.
Most things were available and we had a comfortable stay.
On departure we were also able to leave our bags until the last minute before we caught the taxi for the airport.
The unit was clean and tidy even though in an old block of units. The situation is perfect for getting around Seattle. Close to restaurants and facilities, all mostly within walking distance. We enjoyed our stay."
397117,43902224,2015-08-23,18239455,Nils,Lauren's place was wonderful. All the comfort you need. Perfectly located. Enjoyed staying there a lot.
397117,44521595,2015-08-27,5971751,James,Lauren was helpful and communicative leading up to and during our stay. She was a wonderful host and her apartment is in the best possible location to experience downtown Seattle. This is my second time staying here and I can't wait to go back!
397117,45654201,2015-09-05,13961798,Michael,"Lauren's place was really great.  A well furnished, comfortable, vintage apartment located near several downtown destinations.  About a 12 minute walk to Pike's, shopping, etc.  My girlfriend and I felt like the building was safe and secure and parking was a breeze as well.  We were very satisfied!"
397117,46114921,2015-09-08,4491565,Anna,"The apartment is in a great location, as stated, only a few blocks away from Pikes Place Market and in the heart of downtown.  The place is fully stocked with amenities including linens, towels, and shampoo.  In addition, everything in her kitchen was fully functional, and had lots of channels on TV. Lauren was super accommodating by letting us check in early and also checking out later than listed. "
397117,46370655,2015-09-10,7890935,Barbara,The location of Lauren's apartment is incredibly convenient and Lauren was very helpful with advice about what to see on our brief stay in the city.  The place was clean and the bed comfortable.  Lauren was very accommodating for our arrival and departure schedules.  As other reviewers said there is construction going on literally next door but we slept well.
397117,46690627,2015-09-13,27974255,Christina,This place was great. Very clean. Walkable to everything a tourist wants to see. Convent location for uber to pick up and drop off as most know the hotel near by. 
397117,46876330,2015-09-14,13414032,Darrell,This is our second time staying at Lauren's place and both times the experience has been great. Exellent location and an attentive host makes this our go to spot in Seattle!
397117,47179620,2015-09-16,3172022,Emma,"Lauren made us feel incredibly welcome, helping to check us in earlier, and also offer some great food tips and places to go. The flat itself was great, interestingly furnished and well stocked with everything we could need. Our friend slept comfortably on the giant blow up mattress in the living room space, and we were able to shut the doors between us. As others have mentioned, I would definitely bring ear plugs as the road and construction can be quite noisy without. Thanks for a great few days in Seattle!"
397117,48676080,2015-09-28,937233,Kevin,"Lauren's place is nice and cozy, and in a convenient part of town. Just a few blocks away is the Link, Pikes Place, and downtown. We came in town for a Seahawks game and to see the city, and this was a great place to do that. Lauren's place had everything we needed, my wife was particularly glad to find a hair dryer. Good overall stay!"
397117,48969363,2015-09-29,45091678,Sean,"The apartment was exactly as described and extremely cozy. Even though Lauren wasn't there, the entry into the apartment itself is incredibly easy. The place is kept well, neat and clean. 

Location is superb for walking anywhere downtown Seattle. I would recommend staying here with groups of 1-3 individuals.

Sean"
397117,50193628,2015-10-10,43609827,Beatrice,"Lauren was a great host, she was easy to get in touch with and made our stay very nice!  The apartment was in a great location, very near to Pike's Market and easily walkable to many other tourist sites.  The bed was very comfortable and I felt at home in the apartment.  I would definitely recommend a stay at Lauren's apartment."
397117,50952000,2015-10-16,18847910,Spencer,"Lauren wasn't there when I arrived, but had arranged in advance and easy entry.  It is a nice apartment in an old building with a lot of character.  The location was close to the office where I was working and is also an easy walk to lots of shops and restaurants.

The one caution is that a building is being built next door and construction is 24 hours a day, so it is noisy.  Otherwise, I'd be happy to stay again."
397117,51009436,2015-10-17,6591789,Meghan,We only stayed a night in Lauren's place but it was the perfect stop over. Lauren's communication was excellent and there was everything you needed in the apartment which has lots of charm in a great building. We wished we could've stayed longer! 
397117,51690562,2015-10-24,32947423,Stephen,"Lauren was easy to communicate with and very helpful and friendly when fielding my various questions related to Seattle, not just the apartment. 

There was some traffic noise in the apartment I was in but not so it was overbearing but something to keep in mind if this bothers you. It didn't bother me. 

Lauren was a great in her dealings with me before, during and after my stay :)"
397117,53101202,2015-11-04,633774,Fontaine,Nice BIG space-- I felt like I was in a hotel suite! Great spot near the convention center. Really enjoyed my stay; Lauren made it super easy to check in.
397117,53332267,2015-11-08,11461539,Buzz,Lauren's apartment is a wonderfully furnished and located place to stay. I was visiting for a conference at the convention center and the walk was perfectly fine. Lauren was a charming host who offered expert advice on local fare (which she can back up professionally). She was quickly responsive to any type of communication and made life easy for me during my visit. Would absolutely seek out her space for future stays.
397117,53665130,2015-11-10,2681744,Mark,"Awesome experience at Lauren's apartment.  It's why I use AirBnB, I get the feeling like I'm still in my own place rather than some hotel with no character.  Perfect location.  Thanks again !"
397117,53795696,2015-11-12,46185166,Laura,Beautiful place and couldn't have asked for a more helpful host. I would gladly recommend this place to anyone :-)
