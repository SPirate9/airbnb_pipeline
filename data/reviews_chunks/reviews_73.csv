1069562,26555284,2015-02-15,27079100,Haley,"My partner and I had a lovely stay at Allison's Fremont apartment. We were welcomed with a bottle of wine and a sweet greeting card. The unit was cozy and clean - and super stylish to boot. It was a sunny weekend, and the whole unit was wonderfully light. Additionally, her space is conveniently close to the downtown Fremont area, where we were able to grab a craft cocktail and shop around. Highly recommended!"
1069562,27770485,2015-03-11,27921091,Andre,"The apartment was absolutely fantastic! Allison really went out of her way to make my girlfriend and I feel welcome. She even went as far as to change her schedule because our flights were cancelled on the original day we planned on arriving in Seattle. 

We very much enjoyed our stay and would recommend staying at Allison's apartment to anyone. "
1069562,27882070,2015-03-14,3973627,Krystal,"Allison's apartment was perfect for our weekend in Seattle!  It was just as described -- awesome location across from an adorable park, quiet neighborhood, comfortable and cozy with mid-century modern charm.  It is close to all of the fun restaurants in both Ballard and Fremont.  Allison was a great host and always available when we needed her.   We would stay here again in a heartbeat! "
1069562,28357186,2015-03-22,29348599,William,"My wife and I spent one night at Allison's place located between Ballard and Fremont. Check-in was easy, the apartment was clean and comfortable, parking was plentiful, and Allison thoughtfully provided a list of her favorite local spots. Overall, we had a nice time and would recommend to others."
1069562,28893724,2015-03-31,721219,Evgeniya,"Allison's place is amazing! It's huge, with charming decorations and can boast a balcony and a player for vynils. You can feel that Allison put a lot of care into the place, and she was no less caring to us in her communication.
The area itself is a lot of fun and the city is very close. 
Overall a great experience!"
1069562,29539535,2015-04-08,4661996,Colette,The reservation was canceled 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1069562,30130758,2015-04-18,4315795,Elias,We were very pleased by our accommodations. Allison’s home was in a beautiful location with the balcony overlooking a park constantly used by community families. Parking was easy and free. The apartment was simply furnished in a youthful and eclectic way and was very comfortable. Allison was available by email and was always helpful and generous. We will be back.
1069562,30815749,2015-04-27,86978,Vanessa,"All things about this listing were lovely. Allison's home is very warm and inviting. The beautiful light streaming into the living room was such a gift, the neighborhood was nice, close to public transit and pretty close to Fremont shops, restaurants as well as Ballard. Allison was available for answering questions throughout my stay. Thank you, I would definitely stay again. "
1069562,31804682,2015-05-10,725335,Brent,"My wife and I being lovers of all things mid century were very much looking forward to staying at Allisons space. And we were not disappointed. Her space was a relaxed getaway destination that accommodated us with welcome charm.  The location was perfect: close enough to Fremont so that it was only  a short walk to get there, but far enough to feel like you were actually living in a local neighborhood.  We would definitely recommend this place to others. "
1069562,32484302,2015-05-18,28137449,Chien-Yu,My boyfriend and I stayed in Allison's apartment for 3 nights during our trip to Seattle. It's in a nice neighborhood and very close to restaurants and shops. It's also a short drive to downtown Seattle. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend anyone who is visiting Seattle to stay in Allison's apartment.
1069562,33692027,2015-05-31,7120929,Ria,We had a great one night stay at Allison's apartment. Her place was in a quiet neighbourhood overlooking a park and within walking distance to Fremont's shops and restaurants. A great jumping off point to explore other parts of Seattle without having to be right in the thick of it. 
1069562,34317569,2015-06-07,12968723,Vicki,"Allison was a perfect host. She left us with books about the area and was accessible for questions and recommendations. The apartment's view of the park and water was a big plus. The bedroom mattress was possibly the most comfortable I've ever slept on; however, the kitchen and bath are original so be prepared to step back into the 60's.  Walking up to Fremont Peak Park at sunset was taxing but well worth it! 
The neighborhood was very peaceful and only a 20 minute walk to the center of Fremont. We would highly recommend the apartment to anyone visiting the Seattle area. "
1069562,35593565,2015-06-20,16814782,Stewart,"Allison was a perfect host. Her apartment was clean, nicely furnished, and within easy walking distance to both Fremont and Ballard. She was quick to respond to any questions. I look forward to staying with her again."
1069562,35711404,2015-06-21,32580519,Heather,"Great location walkable to Ballard and Fremont but still quiet 
Friendly, helpful host who was kind enough to leave us a bottle of wine
Clean apartment with a pretty view"
1069562,37999839,2015-07-12,35259846,Sonder,"Allison was a great host - the apartment is bright, clean and beautifully appointed. She was kind enough to welcome us with a bottle of wine and some sightseeing books. We very much enjoyed our stay."
1069562,40069562,2015-07-27,33040049,Katherine,The host canceled this reservation 24 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1069562,42940764,2015-08-16,40154997,Susan,"Allison's place was Awesome! Clean, clutter-free & comfy. We were welcomed with a lovely bouquet of flowers, bottle of wine and books of interest for activities in the Seattle area. Apartment location was excellent to access all areas of city. We had a beautiful breeze & view from the Patio. The carport made parking easy. Communication with host was clear & concise. Great value and highly recommended
"
1069562,44733325,2015-08-28,4597454,Ben,"Allison's apartment was clean, cozy, and very welcoming.  We were greeted by a welcome note, bottle of wine, and stack of books on interesting things to do in Seattle.  Communicating with Allison was incredibly easy, and she always responded promptly to our questions. Her unit's parking spot also made driving around Seattle a cinch. I would recommend her apartment to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Seattle."
1069562,46224211,2015-09-08,30321232,Chris,"Great host, place, and location. Will definitely visit again!"
1069562,53388480,2015-11-08,1394012,Natasha,Great location. We were able to walk to Ballard. Nice neighborhood. Very clean and quiet.
1069562,55470193,2015-12-01,3429394,Stanislav,"Very friendly host, nice apartment!"
1069562,55835840,2015-12-06,9237329,Logan,"
Allisons' home was the definition of charming. Clean, cozy and everything I had hoped for.  Great natural lighting, lots of plants, lovely neighborhood and a bed that felt like sleeping on a cloud. Thanks again Allison. "
1069562,57448907,2015-12-26,22531802,Bruce And Mary,Peaceful one bedroom apartment in a quiet neighborhood with a bright view of the water from the living room. Allison has an impeccably tidy place with comfortable sheets & soft towels. I love the lofty down quilt on the cozy queen bed. In the dark of the northwest winter I felt at home here. 
8446689,48809181,2015-09-28,3058054,Maria,"Nice place. Great design touches. Full of natural light. Minimal yet comfy. The view is simply amazing and though it is very close to the viaduct, it was quiet.
Central to everything, you will want to walk around & explore. Parking can be annoying but that was the only downside.
This place feels like a calming urban oasis. Would stay here again and recommend it to others looking for a unique urban spot in Seattle.
"
8446689,52093811,2015-10-26,900431,Jay,This exquisite apartment was the highlight of my 3 week stay. The view is intoxicating. I would spend many nights with a glass of wine and just watch the shimmer of the ferry lights as they by. The kitchen was so well stocked I felt right at home even by my discriminating foodie standards. The decor needs no testimony to it's impeccable elegant taste  (since there are photos and you can see the beauty for yourself). Even the building was filled with amazing people who welcomed you into their community. The experience will be missed. 
8446689,53070570,2015-11-04,23807617,Alan,Beautiful flat and perfect for my stay! The view is amazing and the flat has everything you need :) Thanks Tamara!
8446689,56755769,2015-12-17,2197666,Andrew,Yes. Tamara was great. We loved the place!
3040278,13446192,2014-05-27,15246659,Sunghee,"The pictures did not do this place justice. Place was beautifully decorated without leaving the comfortable homey vibe. Jenn was very responsive from the time of inquiring about her space to the time we checked out. Not only did she have a binder filled with places to go and restaurants to try, but she also took the time to tell us about everything that was nearby that was worth checking out. This space is in prime location. Everything was walkable. Space needle was a 10 minute (leisurely walking). Pike Place 25-30min walk. I would totally recommend others to stay here."
3040278,13889640,2014-06-07,9197778,Jessica,"Jenn was a stellar communicator throughout the whole booking process as well as the stay. Her beautiful condo was the perfect place to get away, in the heart of Seattle. Walking distance from the space needle, restaurants and grocery stores, as well as yoga studios (home yoga is great).
  Jenn was very helpful, she provided everything needed to make the stay super comfortable. The condo itself is gorgeous, and decorated with a intellectual/romantic/worldly vibe. Lots of art on the walls, candles, and tons of books about wine and travel.
  Last but not least, the view! I was lucky to visit when the weather was just perfect and from her balcony the view of elliot bay/west seattle and the Olympic? mountains were simply stunning. 
I would definitely stay here again."
3040278,14174386,2014-06-13,4455158,Cassie,We had a wonderful time and loved this place. The view was simply amazing. Jenn was so nice and everything worked out perfectly. We will certainly go back.
3040278,14527506,2014-06-21,10800981,Martin,"Hi all,

We love our stay here. Very nice, safe and nicely decorated apartment.

The place is strategically located near to happening places and main attractions.

Space needles, fish market and etc are all within walking distance.

Will stay here again once in Seattle.
"
3040278,14748344,2014-06-25,5392809,Ben,"A friend and I visited Seattle for the first time and Jenn's apartment looked perfect. Having made an enquiry she emailed straight back and made things very easy throughout the whole process. Although we didn't get to meet, Jenn left very easy instructions and other contacts should we need them. 
The apartment was superb! Perfect location near the space needle and just the right size. There even a couple of local beers in the fridge!
Thank you Jenn!!"
3040278,14805733,2014-06-26,7578505,Ricardo,"The apartment is great, beautifully decorated and very comfortable. It is equipped with all you might need. It is clean and cozy and you fell at home as soon as you get in, like staying at your friend's house (but better looking than my friend's place... :^D).
The Murphy bed was extremely comfortable, a pleasant surprise as i was a little worried after my experiences in other apartments, i had a great night of sleep.
The location is also great, just a couple of blocks from the Space Needle and the Olympic Sculpture Park and close enough to Pike Place.
The pictures are very accurate, it might even say i liked it better in real life, and the view from the living room/master bedroom is beautiful.
Having an attached garage was also very comfortable, you can part and walk or take a cab pretty much everywhere.
As for our hostess, Jenn was superb. Communication was perfect and she was really helpful. When we got into the apartment we found nice notes from Jenn around the place and in the kitchen counter a very nice binder with extremely useful information on what to do, see, eat and drink in Seattle.
A great experience, I just wish i had stayed longer !!
Thanks for everything Jenn, I'll definitely try to stay at your place next time I'm in Seattle."
3040278,14869993,2014-06-28,15940482,Jonathan,"This was a great find. I can't imagine a better value for the neighborhood, comfort of place, and hosting of Jenn anywhere in Central Seattle. It was almost a too good to be true sort of place. The beds were both incredible comfortable, the view fantastic, and all of the amenities offered by the host were fantastic. Building and neighborhood both incredibly safe. Large enough for four adults (two couples) to not feel cramped in the least, which was an initial concern of mine when booking, but definitely not the case. Communication with Jenn was simple and prompt. Although she made herself available for questions and help with our stay, my only real regret was not getting a chance to talk with her more, as she seemed really cool and interesting. Strongly recommend, and will hope it is available again on my next trip to Seattle."
3040278,15045790,2014-07-01,3901200,Kristi,"Jenn was a super host — helpful and sweet. The apartment is snug, but perfect for using as a basecamp to explore the city. There's a bus stop right out the front door and some of the most authentic Thai food, bars and a grocery store just up the block. It's a quiet, safe neighborhood very close to the Space Needle and the museums of Seattle Center, only 10 min by bus downtown and about 5 min's walk to Olympic Sculpture Park. Would highly recommend it, especially if traveling with friends or family."
3040278,15141281,2014-07-03,15684726,Allison,"The apartment was clean, just as described, had a great view, and very homey! Jenn was a fantastic host, she was very proactive in communicating, offered some great recommendations, and was super professional. The location also can't be (email hidden)ny things were within walking distance or a short cab ride away. Thanks, Jenn, for making our short Seattle stay a great one!"
3040278,15264865,2014-07-06,14570557,Sandra,"Jenn was a great host. She was really communicative before my arrival and met me at the apartment when checking in. She was full of great advice for my stay in Seattle.  Her apartment was clean, well appointed and in a really central and convenient location."
3040278,15536254,2014-07-11,14456900,Brendan,"We had a fantastic time staying at Jenn's! Great location close to Safeco, Century Link field, the Space Needle, Kerry Park and many great restaurants. Jenn was amazing to deal with and provided us with many suggestions on restaurants and things to do in the city. We'll definitely be back. Thanks Jenn!"
3040278,15648178,2014-07-13,12052041,Tracy,"What a great place! Jenn was awesome! Although we barely got to interact with her, due to our hectic schedule - Jenn was accommodating and basically got us in earlier than we originally anticipated. 

This was my first time on air BnB and what a great experience. Jenn's home was beautiful with hard wood floors. Although it was a little hot at 90degrees - my husband didn't mind at all - the night time was great with all the windows opened. 

The balcony had a great view of the ocean. Jenn was very generous and we had a great time! "
3040278,15683935,2014-07-14,15598647,Aileen,"Jenn's place was incredible for our girls get together.  The apartment was tidy and beautifully decorated, and the view is amazing!  We wish we'd had more time to sit on the patio and enjoy the view!  Thank you Jenn!"
3040278,15871435,2014-07-17,13736362,Claire,Great apt - great size & GREAT views from the apt (we sat on the balcony both evenings we stayed & watched the amazing sunset). Buses for downtown & capitol hill leave from outside the door. We got the monorail back from downtown which is a 5 min walk from the apt (beside space needle). Jenn has a great welcome pack & a welcoming note encouraging use of all facilities. I never met Jenn but her friendly nature was apparent and her home is lovely.
3040278,16248862,2014-07-24,1821704,Kyle,"Host provided a ton of information regarding sightseeing in the city, as well as availability for questions from us. Great option for walking distance to anywhere in the seattle centre. The apartment was very clean, had great views and comfortable beds!"
3040278,16305057,2014-07-25,14098314,Angela,Jenn was very helpful when we arrived as we were confused about getting in.  It was so great to have a secure parking space in the middle of the city with bus access and walking.  A couple of great restaurants close by (the Greek one especially) but walking to Pikes market was easy which we love to do.  The view is indeed spectacular and the rooms very comfortable.   We had an extra person join us at the last minute from Brazil and Jenn was very accommodating.   
3040278,16666374,2014-07-31,6696173,Tom,"Jenn's Seattle place was great, clean and efficient with easy access to public transport and sightseeing destinations.  She was easy to contact and helpful throughout our stay."
3040278,16770345,2014-08-02,703915,Nicole,"Jenn's place is amazing, it's clean and tidy and the view is to die for! It's in a rear location and Jenn was very helpful with pointing out all the best locations to visit. I also love the book she has put together with everything to do in Seattle! There is no way you would miss anything that is happening!
Highly recommended. 
Thanks again! "
3040278,16985457,2014-08-05,10526725,Rebecca,"The apartment was perfectly located, well-appointed, bright, comfortable, clean and felt very welcoming.  Jenn was really helpful with arrival instructions and overall incredibly friendly and helpful.  We would stay there again in a second upon a return trip to Seattle."
3040278,17273269,2014-08-10,15739615,Doug,"Jen, you are an awesome host, the apt and it's beautiful view is really an great experience. The airbnb concept is vacation changing, it is the future. My family was more comfortable, vacation experience starts instantly, location is perfect. Apt really cool, million dollar view, Seattle is just great! We really had a great time and really appreciate your hospitality. "
3040278,18054195,2014-08-21,6735237,Sherry,"Jenn is great as a host.  Her place was just as the pictures show & the view is amazing!  The building is secure & having our own parking was a huge bonus.  If you are going to be in Seattle, you can't go wrong with this place.  Convenient to everything and only a short walk to the waterfront!"
3040278,18122959,2014-08-22,18063233,Alan,"Exactly as advertised.
Clean, safe, accommodating, friendly and close to pier 69 for our trip to Victoria.
Highly recommend "
3040278,18310234,2014-08-25,1169569,Margaret,"We didn't get to meet Jenn because we were late arriving in Seattle, but she was immediately available by phone every time we called or texted with a question. She gave us great restaurant recommendations and provided lots of information in the apartment about what to do in Seattle and how best to enjoy her home and neighborhood. And having a safe reserved parking spot was incredibly convenient.
The apartment is beautifully furnished with comfortable beds and linens and provided plenty of room for the four of us to relax and enjoy ourselves. A twenty-minute walk got us to Pike Place Market and the Space Needle is even closer.
I highly recommend Jenn's Seattle place and would love to go back again some day."
3040278,18409728,2014-08-26,8075215,James,"We only stayed briefly for one night, so we didn't have much interaction with the host, but the place was great and everything went smoothly.  I would be willing to stay here for a longer duration on a future trip.  The place is well kept and beds are comfortable.  The parking space in the garage below is super convenient.  There are decent restaurants within a close walk.  Seems like a good choice if you want to spend some time in Seattle and need 2 bedrooms."
3040278,18537605,2014-08-28,3101841,Jacqueline,Jenn's apartment was just lovely to stay in. Super-comfy beds !  and everything could need at hand .  Jenn was there to meet and greet us and left us lots of info about Seattle.  The apartment is walking distance to all the tourist attractions and in a safe neighborhood. We had an absolute ball in Seattle and would recommend Jenn's appartment and Seattle to anyone thinking of going to Seattle!
3040278,18651691,2014-08-30,12705604,Emily,"Jenn's place was lovely!  From booking the condo initially to when we arrived Jenn made it a simple and fun experience!  Jenn accommodated an earlier than normal check in mid-afternoon and met us at the condo promptly after letting her know we were 15 minutes away.  The parking spot was great to save money on downtown Seattle parking and she gave us detailed instructions on how to enter and exit the building and to use the garage.

Once we arrived Jenn gave us a quick tour of her place, let us know where things were we might need and gave us some recommendations on some good restaurants and nightlife spots close to her home.  The location was perfect to see the Space Needle, Chihuly Glass and Garden exhibit and Seattle Center!  

Seattle was a great time and the condo was perfect for myself and my siblings who were visiting.  The next time I am in Seattle I will definitely look to stay here again :)"
3040278,18937786,2014-09-03,2132024,Lisa,"If you visit Seattle, staying with Jenn is a MUST. Beyond having an unbelievable charming and comfortable condo (with laundry!), Jenn is the kind of host you dream of having in a new city. If you want the DIY approach to travel, her guidebook of things to do and places to eat will set you off on the perfect path to self-selected exploration. If you'd like something a little more hand's on / the true local experience, Jenn has genius ideas and tips for that too. You can't ask for a more walkable location, inviting condo, or delightful host - I can't wait to stay with her again."
3040278,19016491,2014-09-04,20726923,Josh,"Jenn was an amazing host and made us feel right at home. If we had any questions, she always answered back right away. The apartment was beautiful and clean. The views were  wonderful. Also, Jenn provided us with a great book that had everything from coupons to local restaurants to how to check out. It was a great experience."
3040278,19075655,2014-09-06,17118599,Elisa,"Great location with good view. Jenn is a very friendly host and the appartment is amazing! The location is perfect for exploring Seattle by walk. Jenn, thank you so much!"
3040278,19192214,2014-09-08,15723942,Drew,"We spent 2 nights in Jenn's condo, prior to an Alaskan cruise. The location is perfect, just  a one mile walk to Pike Market, and plenty of restaurants nearby. You cannot beat the view, either. Would be glad to stay here next time I am in Seattle."
3040278,19591931,2014-09-15,15602001,Sara,"What a wonderful place. Great view and an easy walk to so many of Seattle finest attractions; the Space Needle, Museums; Pike Place, Sculpture park and many more. Jenn was a wonderful hostess. She stopped in to make sure all was good and gave us some great ideas of places to go and things to do. The building is very secure and the underground parking spot is clutch! Overall it was a great find. Jenn was great and the apartment and location couldn't have been better. 
Thanks!"
3040278,19734969,2014-09-17,19296385,Linda,"My husband, William and I were so lucky to stay at Jenn's condo for our first airbnb experience! Her home is absolutely beautiful and the location perfect. We parked the car in her garage and walked everywhere. The kitchen is well-equipped and the entire place is charming with unique art work and comfortable sitting areas. The view is remarkable. Although we didn't get to meet Jenn, we'd love to at some point...and next time we're in Seattle, we'll try to book with Jenn again. She made sure it was easy for us to get into her place. Her communication was great. We felt very welcomed and right at home. Since our stay in Seattle was the beginning of two weeks of airbnb stays in 5 different homes, we were grateful for this great space and positive experience.  Thanks again, Jenn!"
3040278,20001913,2014-09-22,1163986,Bruno,"Our stay at Jenn's apt. was great! The location of 
her apt was very important to us. It allowed us to
walk to most places. The apt was very comfortable, everything one could need was available - except for a toaster!!??- It is tastefully
furnished, and the view of course is ""Amazing""!
Returning to Seattle is our wish, should we do so
Jenn's place will be considered. 
Thank you for making our stay enjoyable. 
Jackie, Bruno and Connie"
3040278,20184402,2014-09-25,17948113,Jeff,"Great view and really great location. Walking distance to Space Needle and Chihuly Glass Garden, 5 dollar Uber ride to anything in downtown, and a bust stop downstairs. Apartment is equipped exactly as listed, very comfortable and includes anything you would need on a Seattle trip. Jenn was very helpful and accommodating in the check in process. My friends and I would definitely choose to stay here again if we return to Seattle."
3040278,20548864,2014-10-01,16808754,Joan,"We fell in love with this place the moment we walked through the door.  It had everything we needed to feel comfortable after an exhausting week of cruising the San Juan islands.  Our hostess left explicit and timely directions on how to access her unit.  With the help of her copious materials on Seattle, what to do, where to go and where to eat we enjoyed our brief visit to the Emerald City to the fullest!

The sleeping accommodations were wonderful and the kitchen was well equipped. The unit is conveniently located close to Seattle Center and Space Needle and offers an expansive view of Elliot Bay with the comings and goings of ferries and cruise ships.  There is public transportation on the street in front of the unit.  While parking was offered to us, we felt no need for a car as buses took us wherever we wanted to go.

My son, his wife and I hope we can return again for a longer stay.





"
3040278,20626558,2014-10-02,4454558,Fendy,The apartment is located just a short walk from the Space Needle which was the main reason my family chose to stay there. The design and decoration in the apartment was lovely and very homey. Jenn was out of town and wasn't able to meet us in person but by simply staying there makes me feel like I already know her. It really reflects her character and I think that is what makes the apartment feel so homey. The apartment is clean and secure. I only wished I planned by stay in Seattle longer. I will definitely return and stay in this apartment again.
3040278,20987884,2014-10-09,990807,Melissa,"I was in Seattle for a wedding with a few friends, and we stayed at Jenn's place for about a week. The apartment is absolutely wonderful, with a great view of the Sound. Jenn was great - made check-in/check-out extremely easy, and was always easy to reach with questions. The apartment is in a very central location, and within walking distance of great restaurants/shops, etc - we had a lovely time! I've recommend this to anyone interested in finding a great location for their Seattle travels.  "
3040278,21028789,2014-10-10,12254495,Harley,"This was our second trip to Seattle and the first time with our 7 and 8 year old boys. Jenn's place was perfect for the four of us. Jenn is very friendly, welcoming, and thoughtful. She even helped us recover a stuffed wolf that got left behind after we checked out. It is a 5 minute walk to Seattle Center which made it easy to check out the Children's Science Museum. My only regret is that we were only able to spend one night here. Next time we come to Seattle we'll definitely be checking if Jenn has availability. "
3040278,21103381,2014-10-11,21505047,Ken,"Jenn was a great hostess and was very attentive.  I was amazed at how communicative she was throughout the process at staying at her place and how willing she was to supply information on good local restaurants, bars, etc.   The apartment was beautiful with a lot of cute details and very nice decor.  The location was was also amazing... a short walk to the space needle, chihuli exhibit, the Bill and Science Museum, Melinda Gates foundation, etc.  Centrally located in downtown.
"
3040278,21196911,2014-10-13,15015432,Elizabeth,"Greatly enjoyed our stay at Jenn's listing over the weekend. Although we did not meet she was always prompt in communicating and she was a great resource. To top it all off she was very accommodating and understanding of some last minute requests that we had. We really enjoyed this neighborhood as there were lots of walkable places nearby and if you are not a walker (or if you just get a little lazy like we did) downtown is just a short/cheap cab ride away (we took a Lyft, it was $5). The best part about this listing was THE VIEW! Definitely enjoyed relaxing and watching the sunset out of the living room. Nice amenities, comfy beds and a great view! "
3040278,21317904,2014-10-14,22159574,Diana,Jenn was an amazing hostess. She was very efficient in getting back to me with any questions I had. She made our stay very welcoming! I would definitely recommend her abode anytime you want to enjoy the sights and scenery of Seattle!!!! Great views from the Condo too!
3040278,21376886,2014-10-16,19047731,Shannon And Fred,"Location, Location, Location! as promised by sweet Jenn. Although we didn't get to meet her in person every aspect of Jenn's communication (response time, restaurant recommendations, local attractions, etc) were""spot on"" as was our expectation of her delightful condo. A quick 2 block walk to the Space Needle, IMAX, Chuhuilly Exhibit, Monorail,music, coffee houses and restaurants all situated in a very walkable,safe neighborhood-or take a short 5 minute cab ride to Pikes Market. Ride the Monorail ($2.25 p/p) that whisks you to the motherlode of shopping options (Nike Town, Nordy's, Macy's, high-end and funky, art galleries, etc-we did our level best to support the local economy!) The condo is nicely decorated with all the amenities we could have asked for and more. Nice to have the secure parking garage, although we never moved our car as everything was so accessible on foot. A generous, honest hostess. We felt like we were staying in the home of a good friend. Jenn even arranged for great weather-although we can't promise that for every Seattle visitor! We will be back.

3040278,21462641,2014-10-18,9494381,Shelly,"Jenn was a fabulous host. She answered all questions we had leading up to our trip in a very timely manner and was super helpful. Her apartment was gorgeous, very inviting, and super comfortable. The view was even better than expected and we couldn't have asked for a better location. We walked everywhere we wanted to go during our 2 day stay. I would definitely recommend this lovely apartment as the perfect centrally located place to stay while visiting Seattle."
3040278,21652831,2014-10-21,11930597,Anne,Everything Jenn suggested was spot on. The apartment was exactly as described; amazing view and amazing location! I would highly recommend this listing for anyone visiting for the first time.
3040278,21774205,2014-10-23,15379356,James,I loved this place and felt right at home!  Jenn's dedication to making guests feel comfortable is special!
3040278,21944622,2014-10-27,20130893,Jennifer,"Jenn's home is exactly as she described it. The view is outstanding (the picture was spot on!). Her home is warm and comfortable. When we walked in the door, we relaxed instantly. There were little post-it notes all over with comments, smiles, hints, etc. She left a book on the counter with tons of area recommendations. The place is very small, but this added to the coziness. I would definitely head back up to Seattle and stay at Jenn's place! Thank you, Jenn, for a wonderful stay!"
3040278,22356053,2014-11-04,16528326,Becky,"I've never been in this area of Seattle, and I really enjoyed it!  Close to Pike Place Market.  Very nice, secure building with underground parking garage.  The small but nicely appointed apartment was cozy and welcoming.  The view from the balcony was beautiful!  We walked to many cute shops and delicious restaurants, and there are grocery stores nearby as well.  We did not cook, but there is a full kitchen with anything you might need.  The master bed was super comfy.  I would rent this apartment again.  The description listed by the renter is accurate."
3040278,22494574,2014-11-08,18314550,Tim,Jenn's apartment is very nice and exactly as described. Instructions for everything were very clear with a detailed book of attractions and places to eat. The running trail along the waterfront is close by and really nice. I spent most of my time working so I can't comment on the neighborhood besides the running path and Drip City coffee (open early!)
3040278,22885810,2014-11-17,12371734,Christopher,"
Jenn's apartment is very nice.  Clean and well-located.  Nice views.  Perfect for a couple of couples who want to explore the city."
3040278,23154213,2014-11-24,630800,Elizabeth,"Jenn is a wonderful host.  She is warm and friendly and her condo is cute and comfortable and in a great location.  My friend and I stayed there to go to the Seattle Rep and the Chihuly Museum.  We were able to walk to both locations.

I would highly recommend and will definitely return to Jenn's condo when I return to Seattle. 
Elizabeth

What a great location and comfortable accommodations! We were within walking distance of all the places we wanted to visit. Just wish we had had more time to enjoy the delightful apartment. 
Hope to stay at Jenn's again sometime when visiting Seattle.

3040278,23292862,2014-11-28,2677755,Erin,"Jenn was an awesome host! She kept great communication to ensure me and my family always felt at home. The location can't be beat! Steps away from the space needle and a 1 mile walk to Pike Place market. Jenn's house was clean, had all necessary amenities and was very safe. Highly recommend!"
3040278,23503438,2014-12-02,884228,Chris,"First, Jenn's condo is a great location. Walk to tons of things, and a central location for places you need to drive to north or south. Second, what a great view! Jenn was great with responsive communication and this 2 bedroom condo was perfect for me, my wife and our 3yo over the Thanksgiving holiday. Great instructions, along with a ton of recommendations for nearby amenities. We come back often, and we'll check to see if Jenn's place is available before we search for other options."
3040278,23570960,2014-12-05,10264431,Kim,Jenn's place is super cute and in a perfect location... Especially if you are going to an event at the Key Arena! We will definitely be staying here again!
3040278,23769178,2014-12-09,9338198,Tan-Chieh,"Jenn's place is amazing! We really enjoyed it, felt like home. It was a short stay, but I wish it was longer. She had everything you need and more! The information and instructions was very clear. The interior decor was really cool, the view is awesome, condo was nice and clean. 
Couldn't have picked a better place.

Highly recommend here for anyone staying in seattle.

Next time I will bring my lab!

3040278,23876116,2014-12-13,11311996,Guy,"Jenn was great to work with.  Quick, responsive, and helpful communication.  Instructions were clear and location was great.  We enjoyed this Air BnB experience!  "
3040278,23897459,2014-12-14,5311200,Sally,"This is a lovely place to stay!  Jenn made us feel welcome, and as our travel and arrival plans changed, was quick and responsive to make sure our arrival was easy--even though a delayed train had us arriving at 1:30am!   Really wonderful to finally arrive, and find a beautiful living space, comfortable beds, kitchen ready for our use.
  
 It's a great location for getting around Seattle and yes, amazing view.  Jenn was available for questions and help at any time, but we found her notebook with suggestions and guidance met all our needs."
3040278,23957768,2014-12-15,5311200,Sally,"Jenn was so helpful and responsive as our travel plans changed -- adding and subtracting a family member guest, arranging a late arrival, accommodating an even later arrival due to delayed train!  When we finally arrived we found a warm, lovely living space, perfectly appointed, beautiful view, great beds, kitchen with every possible need considered.  Jenn provided a binder of information on restaurants and other logistics.  The location was ideal for us: the Seattle Center and Seattle Rep Theater is within easy walking distance, and the bus stop for downtown is right outside the door. Wonderful restaurants nearby - we were very happy!"
3040278,24022640,2014-12-17,22414207,Ashley,"This was our first air B and B stay and the bar is set unbelievably high. Awesome location, comfortable place, so inviting and warm. I not only would use air B and B again but I would love to stay at Jenn's place. "
3040278,24125937,2014-12-20,12186958,Thorsten,"Perfect location for a stay in Seattle: views of the Puget Sound, walking distance to the Pikes Market and the Queen Ann neighborhood. The parking spot makes it easy for everybody arriving by car to safely store the car every night. The apartment was spacious and equipped with everything listed. We had a great stay, thanks Jenn."
3040278,24229906,2014-12-23,3686556,Charles,"Staying in Jenn's apartment was a delight.  It is in an excellent location that felt very safe and was within walking distance of most of the places we wanted to go.  Inside, it is very comfortable and attractive, and its wonderful view of the Sound makes it feel much larger than it actually is.  It also has the kind of TV and music devices one would want.  While it is small, the three adults in our party did not feel cramped.  The bed in the second bedroom is not as comfortable as in the main bedroom, but the other features of the apartment compensate for this, unless one has a significant difficulty with sleep.  Jenn was very easy to communicate with regarding our visit.  Since we arrived later than planned, we were not able to meet her, checking in was a snap anyway.  I would highly recommend this apartment."
3040278,24458668,2014-12-29,18858947,Jessica,"Jenn was a fantastic host and was available to answer any questions that we had at any time. Jenn was able to share her knowledge of the area and suggest things and do and transportation. 

The unit is in a fantastic location and it is very easy to get around. We stayed as a group of four- 2 adults and 2 children and found the unit great for our needs."

The check-in and check-out process was seamless and easy, despite us not knowing exactly when we'd arrive and our really early morning departure. She also recommended 2 really delicious restaurants that I look forward to returning to on my next trip to Seattle. I would definitely recommend Jenn's apartment to someone staying in Seattle."
3040278,24704244,2015-01-02,11560219,Alishia,"What an amazing location!  Jenn was so gracious and easy to work with.  She was incredibly accommodating, and really made us feel at home.  The condo has an amazing view, and is walking distance to so much that Seattle has to offer.  We stayed with my parents, a tween, and a toddler.  My dad said that the pillows in the ""blue room"" were the best he's ever slept on, and asked me to ask Jenn where we could find them.  :-)

We really enjoyed Jenn's space, and will definitely stay again the next time we are visiting Seattle!"
3040278,24850967,2015-01-03,12936041,Thomas,Jenn is an accommodating and responsive host. We loved her cozy condo with a great view. She provided us with excellent detail to park and get checked in. We were close to the Seattle Center with lots of really good restaurants. Jenn helped make our visit to Seattle both fun and friendly. We will happily recommend her to our friends and come back again. Thanks Jenn. 
3040278,25248902,2015-01-10,18882584,Frank,"This place is awesome! And Jenn is awesome too. I'd rent this place every time. Everything was as advertised - great location, beautiful and clean apartment, and very reasonable rates. AND I had easy, positive communication with Jenn. 
THANK YOU JENN!

3040278,25330584,2015-01-12,12848670,Claire,"Everything is like what's described! Cozy apartment with amazing view. Jenn has a book that documents everything you need during your stay in Seattle, very helpful! "
3040278,25632221,2015-01-21,5003250,Xinmeng,Jenn was very helpful. She gave us a detailed decription of her place and helped us to get in. She responds to text in a timely fashion and is always so friendly and helpful. Her place has a georgous view and is so tastefully decorated. She provided us with everything we needed. We really enjoyed our stay here and spent a significant amount of time in door especially during the stormy weather :) we highly recommend this place and can't wait to come back again!
3040278,25853641,2015-01-27,7303223,Kate,"Jenn was terrific to work with before we even got to Seattle.  She was so warm and friendly at check in and was a plethora of  great information about the city.  Really great tips on restaurants.  We absolutely loved the accommodations.  Fabulous location - we pretty much walked everywhere we wanted to go!  The view is spectacular.  We were three, and we were all extremely comfortable in her apartment.  Jenn has done a great job of making her place warm, interesting and comfy.  It was impeccably clean and well appointed.  We would highly recommend her place and would definitely return!  Thanks for a wonderful weekend, Jenn!"
3040278,25907069,2015-01-29,25700289,Louis,"Jenn's place is epic. Stayed there with a friend for two nights, and it's an incredible way to experience Seattle. The place itself was spotless, and the view from the bedroom and the balcony is breathtaking; make sure to catch the sunset over the water. It's only a couple blocks walking to great food and the Space Needle, plus public transport is just a few steps away from the front door.

Jenn was extremely welcoming and gave us a quick tour of the place before leaving us with tons of great recommendations and suggestions. It's obvious that she loves the city, and it was great to share in that enthusiasm. My only regret is not having more time to spend there. I can't recommend Jenn's place highly enough!"
3040278,26010245,2015-02-01,3705160,Chris,"Wow, what an incredible space! (The view!) Jenn was an amazing host, and welcomed us to Seattle in the most incredible and informed way. Her space was perfect, and just as described."
3040278,26080223,2015-02-02,15600266,Eleza,"I loved this place.  It was the perfect place in the perfect location.  Jenn really scored a beautiful view, and we enjoyed every minute of it.  Unfortunately, our Super Bowl win dreams were smashed.  But this stay was a trip saver.

As a new host, I know what I need to do for my guest to have the best experience.  

Thanks Jenn"
3040278,26168155,2015-02-05,26905817,Linda,Staying at Jenns lovely place in Seattle was like being home. Quiet and comfortable but close enough to walk to many of the happening things in town. My only wish is that we could have stayed longer. Thanks Jenn.
3040278,26677711,2015-02-17,15635748,Cheryl,"Jenn was the best host! Very attentive to our needs, she made time to meet us and make sure we were comfortable. Jenn also had great tips on areas to hike, eat & sight see.  The informational binder at the Condo was amazing & so helpful.  We loved her beautiful home, the view & the whole atmosphere. We will be sure to return, it made our trip much more enjoyable."
3040278,26859294,2015-02-21,20720709,Jennifer,The property was amazing.  It was in a great location.  It was totally clean and convenient to everything.  Its a great place to see Seattle from!
3040278,27047933,2015-02-24,637415,John,"Jenn gave us a nice orientation to the neighborhood to supplement the really-together binder she provides with many of the best (and close!) things Seattle has to offer (including some fun quirky things).  We were 2 couples coming from 2 locations so she gifted us her extra private parking spot too.  All 4 of us agreed her place was awesome and we could find nothing to not like about it.  Super nice to just hang out in, and the perfect weather meant gorgeous views of the snow-capped Olympics.   We'll be back! "
3040278,27325667,2015-03-02,16260048,Erik,"We loved our AirBnB experience with this rental!  Jenn was an excellent host from the moment our request was accepted.  She provided information about the unit and the neighborhood, provided excellent instructions to ensure a smooth check-in, and made it easy for us despite a late arrival (10:30pm).

The neighborhood was perfect for our visit to Seattle!  Walking distance to the Space Needle and numerous excellent restaurants.  The view of the Sound and Olympic Range beyond was beautiful.

"
3040278,27461683,2015-03-05,25249427,Jared,"Jenn was a terrific host. She was very communicative and clear with directions on how to find her place and how to access it. She even met up with my group and explained all of the details, along with giving us some great suggestions about what to do during our time in Seattle. As for her apartment, it was absolutely perfect. Our entire group absolutely loved it, and the view is much better than the photos show. The apartment is ideally located for exploring Seattle as well, being walking distance to both Seattle Center (where the Space Needle/EMP Museum are) and Pike Place Market. I would definitely stay here again on a future visit to Seattle. "
3040278,27534578,2015-03-07,25363922,Tatiana,"Jenn was awesome and responsive as a host! Her condo is beautiful and had such a lovely feel to it. My husband loved its decor and we both loved the location. We walked pretty much everywhere--we loved that we were so close to everywhere we wanted to go. 

For being in the middle of the city and part of a condo complex, it was remarkably quiet and peaceful!!

I would definitely stay there again if we make it back up to Seattle!"
3040278,27887030,2015-03-14,28015637,Hannah,"Jenn was a fantastic host! From the beginning, she was reachable, helpful, and knowledgeable. She is full of great advice for the area, and my Seattle experience was great because of both Jenn's advice and her apartment. The apartment was clean, well-kept, and felt like a home away from home, and it was in the perfect location - near many nice restaurants and in a walkable place. I will be recommending Jenn's apartment to friends and family anytime they visit Seattle. Thanks so much, Jenn! You're awesome! :)"
3040278,28058045,2015-03-16,29165522,Linh,"Jenn was great and the flat was amazing!  There really were ""Amazing views""! Jenn was very helpful and was in contact with me as soon as I submitted my request. She was quick to fill me into all of the details and checking in was a breeze. The home was put together so well, very clean and very comforting. My friends and I had a mini reunion from our trip to Spain last month and this was the best place. walking distance from anything you wanted to do and you can relax and enjoy the view of the water, space needle and PI Building. Beautiful location, great host!! And competitive pricing.

I will definitely rent again and recommend my friends to Jenn! "
3040278,28160686,2015-03-19,1779032,David,"Great neighborhood.  Pretty close to walk to things, nice neighborhood.  The view is wonderful (better than the pictures!).  Jenn was very accommodating, and the place is lovely.  Love the balcony!"
3040278,28464064,2015-03-24,14860677,Stefanie,We thoroughly loved our stay at Jenn's apartment during our time in Seattle! Jenn is super welcoming and friendly and provided us so with so many ideas and places in the area to visit and eat. Her apartment is super clean and in a perfect location to park your car and walk to the main attractions! Beds are also super comfy : )  Would definitely stay here again. 
3040278,28611895,2015-03-27,2283309,Celeste,"Jenn was incredibly hospitable and sweet. Her place was a luxury for us (and my dog!) -- very comfortable beds, amazing view, every amenity you need. Our stay in Seattle was too short, but we never had to get in the car -- so much great stuff can be reached on foot from this lovely condo. Jenn's Seattle pride is strong and she has an endless list of suggestions for places to visit. (Chihuly was fantastic! Tiny Bigs rocks!) I'd definitely seek out Jenn on another visit to Seattle. Thank you, Jenn!!!"
3040278,28666929,2015-03-28,28939287,Charles,we will happily stay in this unit again. Jenn met and quickly oriented us upon arrival and also has a large binder full of useful tips about the neighborhood and seattle.  the view truly is great and there is much to do - virtually all accessed easily by foot - in the neighborhood. nothing difficult at all about this rental. it helped to make our trip very pleasant.
3040278,28932896,2015-04-01,26820235,Jeff,"The apartment was fantastic, exceeding all of our needs (primarily location-based). For the most part, we were able to get around without a car, though the parking space downstairs was very helpful. The apartment was well-furnished and homey. The host was extremely helpful, both in providing an abundance of good information for visitors and in making sure all our needs were met. Overall, we had a great time in Seattle, and this apartment was a big part of that."
3040278,29233147,2015-04-05,29249932,Reynaldo,"Since I have lived in Seattle before, I knew this location was in a safe neighborhood right near Seattle Center. The building and parking were both very secure as well, and there was plenty of ""temporary"" parking when we first arrived and got familiar with the entry/exit procedures. The view is much better in real life than the picture! The owner made us feel very welcome, and we did try to schedule an in-person meeting after we arrived.  But our schedules didn't quite match up.  Nevertheless, we stayed in steady contact throughout our short 2 day stay, and did not experience any unanswered questions.  There were plenty of clean towels and informative strategically placed notes to help us out too. It was very comforting to be staying in a place that felt very much like a ""real"" home instead of just a hotel.  "
3040278,29335482,2015-04-06,29871837,Patti,"Wonderful hospitality. Jenn was very attentive to our questions and made the stay very easy. Wonderful view, wonderful location!  Would highly recommend to all to stay here for a great Seattle experience. "
3040278,29605923,2015-04-10,27438036,Joey,"We loved the location of this fabulous condo. The space was perfect for our group of four, and everything we needed was within walking distance. We even took our time one day and strolled all the way to Safeco Field, making some fun stops for lunch and refreshments along the way. Jenn was a very accommodating host, which made our first airbnb experience better than we could have expected. We will definitely look to stay here again. "
3040278,29972281,2015-04-15,7740672,Mary,"We were met by Jenn shortly after we arrived at her home and were able to ask lots of questions about Seattle, getting around, things to see in the neighborhood. Jenn was welcoming and knowledgeable. The condo had the view that is exactly featured on the website and it was spectacular. We loved having the small deck available but were unable to use it because of the weather. The location was ideal. We walked downtown, to the Pike Place Market and along the waterfront. 
Because we were visiting our daughter and friends we needed to rent a car. We found Hwy 99 convenient for getting into and out of town and it dropped us off a few blocks from the condo. Having parking under the building was a huge help. We are looking forward to booking this condo again in the future."
3040278,30381498,2015-04-21,26522349,Gerardo,"Jenn, met us in person and gave us a some great ideas of what the city had to offer. She provided info, suggestions and directions to things. She was also available by text if anything came up."
3040278,30861623,2015-04-28,25828454,Sophie,Best experience ever! The view is fantastic. And you have everything you need in the apartment. Jenn is very detailed and provide us a lot of stuff.(even an eye cover) We enjoyed every moment in the apartment. I would definitely recommend all my friends go this apartment if they are traveling to Seattle.   
3040278,31211587,2015-05-03,30604282,Kelly,Jenn's place was AMAZING...the best location possible. She had a ton of great information on Seattle sites and restaurants throughout her place. We were never without options. Jenn had also recommended some Tom Douglass restaurants and he we hit one location and loved EVERY bit!
3040278,31667644,2015-05-08,23737149,Ivan,"Jenn was a very thoughtful host. It became very clear that she wanted her guest to make the most out of their trip. Very friendly with great communication throughout the stay. I greatly appreciate how she systematically put tips and instructions in the binders about how to get around and her recommendations on nearby attractions. Her place is awesome, just a short walk to the Seattle Center and very accessible to all the major attractions. I'm thankful that we got a chance to stay here and hope we will get another chance to visit this beautiful city and be her guest again."
3040278,31730841,2015-05-09,5662607,Tone,"Jenn's apartment was fantastic! In a great part of town that allowed for us to park the car and walk around the entire downtown. Very clean and well equipped for 2 couples. I was very pleased with an easy check-in and check-out process. Would recommend to anyone looking in the area! Laundry is a bonus!

3040278,31760296,2015-05-10,24267542,Jamie,"Beautiful condo, perfectly located, and everything was as it should be. We loved our stay here and would again if we come back to the Seattle area."
3040278,31897024,2015-05-11,254423,Kathryn,This was a perfect intro to airbnb. The apt was as described- amazing view and amazing location! Jenn was responsive about timing questions and very helpful with excellent suggestions for activities/restaurants. We felt like we were staying at a friend's place while they were out of town. Everything was comfortable and clean. Thanks Jenn!
3040278,32446014,2015-05-18,20164502,Stella M.,"Ótimo apartamento.
Localização excelente em Seattle. Fácil de se locomover aos principais pontos turísticos da cidade e próximo ao porto (Princess Cruise). Não usamos transporte público, mas foi possível notar que a localização do apto é boa para qualquer tipo de transporte.
Apartamento grande, ideal para 4 pessoas, não mais que isso pois tem apenas um banheiro.
Garagem boa, fácil de estacionar e segura.
A vista da sacada é muito agradável.
Jenn nos recebeu pessoalmente, mesmo nosso voo chegando depois das 21h. Jenn é uma ótima anfitriã, além da recepção deixou diversas dicas da cidade.
As toalhas eram boas e a casa é bem servida de equipamentos de cozinha."
3040278,32741353,2015-05-21,26857159,Igor,"I whish i could rate 6 stars. Everything was just perfect. Jenn is a very friendly and caring host. Her place is just amazing and right at the Space Needle! Next time we go to Seattle, we'll try to stay at Jenn's place.
"
3040278,33228487,2015-05-26,25382019,Liyoung,What impressed us was not only sea-view but also Jenn's indoor decoration and lots of books and info about wine. Truly everything one needs in Seattle.
3040278,33491523,2015-05-29,22070720,Leslie,What can I say? My first Airbnb experience was amazing thanks to Jenn and all the special touches to make sure our stay was comfortable and fabulous. Location was perfect (walking distance to Key Arena) and check-in/check-out process was a breeze. Would definitely stay here again next time we're in Seattle. 
3040278,33773466,2015-06-01,962698,Daniel,"Jenn and her apartment in Queen Ann were absolutely perfect. My family and I were traveling the Pacific Northwest, and had stayed at Jenn's place. We loved the neighborhood immediately. Tons of great local and must-see restaurants right nearby. This is the perfect experience for those who don't want to be in a tourist hub OR too far outside of the city.
Listing description was more than accurate, and had more amenities than we expected.
We left for Vancouver for a weekend, and returned and it felt like home.  If that's not a home-run, I'm not sure what is."
3040278,33979154,2015-06-03,8244944,Campbell,"Jenn was a great help, guiding my father and I into her downtown apartment late at night as we drove from the airport, and was very kind and patient as she walked me through the steps of getting to the location and entering it. The apartment itself had everything we needed, was tidy and well furnished, and the morning view was an exceptional introduction to the city and the wider Pacific Northwest which we were to explore. A great start to our travels and a place I'd recommend to all."
3040278,34282592,2015-06-07,29095409,Balbir,"Amazing view, and location,location location.
Close everything. the house was great and Jenn was there for what you needed. would stay again"
3040278,34575995,2015-06-09,32831961,John,"Compact condo with all you need. Absolutely a great place to stay. From the start Jenn's communication was excellent. 

Our transcontinental flight put us in Seattle early in the day but Jenn worked to get the condo ready for us early so that we could tour without the burden of our belongings. Although we weren't able to meet in person, Jenn made it easy for us to feel at home. 

Jenn's place is very comfortable, features a great view of the Sound and the Olympic Mountains when nature cooperates (as it did for us).  The condo is in a great location and Jenn's recommendations list on restaurants was quite helpful.  Jenn was always just a text message away. 

Jenn, thanks very much for your concern relative to our comfort, for your recommendations on things to do and see and for the fresh fruit!"
3040278,34690264,2015-06-11,17180174,Ed,Access was made very easy despite late arrival.   Great location with views just as promised. Much personal type stuff around the apartment which gives the definite feeling of staying in Jenn's home despite having the whole apartment to ourselves.
3040278,34849101,2015-06-13,26766672,Debbie,"Jenn's condo is gorgeous, it is close to so many touristy things, we walked everywhere. It truly was like staying in a friends home. Jenn's communication was amazing, she really cared about our experience in Seattle. Just remember people, you are a guest in a home, make sure you treat her home with the respect it deserves. Leave it as beautiful and clean as you found it."
3040278,35382156,2015-06-18,5115852,Susanna,"Although I only stayed one night at Jenn's apartment, it was still a great experience. It has a great location where you can walk to all of the major sights. Major benefit that it has a parking space - just leave your car there and walk everywhere! There was a bit of confusion in the time before we got our keys to the place and parking garage because there wasn't any available street parking nearby. One of us ended up sort of parking illegally while the other person grabbed the key. Finding the right garage door took a couple of tries too, but once we were settled in it was well worth it. While I did not meet Jenn, she was available for all of my questions. The apartment is clean, comfortable, and homey. Another benefit for me was being able to do laundry inside the apartment. Also, the view is amazing! I loved seeing the water from the living room and balcony. All in all I would definitely would recommend this place. "
3040278,35535244,2015-06-20,8641412,Peter,Jenn's condo was everything we expected and more. Description and photos are very accurate and might not due the space justice. Walking distance from downtown or a $5 Uber ride. View and beds were first class. Can't thank Jenn enough for her correspondence and hospitality . Would not think twice about staying here again. Loved our stay
3040278,35665998,2015-06-21,32492969,Brett,"Jenn is a great host! Great place! Great city!

Would definitely stay here again!"
3040278,35999963,2015-06-24,1510961,Alex,"We can't say enough about Jenn and this apartment. It was perfect! Clean, comfortable and the most amazing location. We were absolutely thrilled with everything. And while we never got to meet Jenn she answered our many questions and took good care of us. "
3040278,36167955,2015-06-26,27487698,Josh,"Jenn was a lovely host at an amazing apartment. She provided super tips on local eats, where to go and what to avoid. Special shoutout to the balcony views, a perfect place to watch the ferrys at sundown.  Would stay again. "
3040278,36282280,2015-06-27,4873966,Victoria,"Jennifer was a fantastic host!!  She was very accommodating and had tons of ideas for first time visitors. The home was exceptional!  Super comfortable beds, all you need in the home in the way of accommodations, and boy oh boy... that view!!!!  If we ever move here we will try to buy this condo from her as it was perfect in every way. We will definitely stay here again! "
3040278,36814822,2015-07-01,10750817,Zack,"Jenn and Jenns place were fantastic.  Beautiful place, perfect to see the waterfront.  Jenn was extremely well organized and getting in was a breeze.  I heavily recommend staying here."
3040278,36938766,2015-07-03,26324243,Karlo,"Jenn was amazing.  She let us check in early, let us leave the car in the lot late, left unbelievable amounts of information about the city for us to read, and was easily reachable.  What's more, these pictures do not do this condo justice.  It is unbelievably beautiful and comfortable."
3040278,37128863,2015-07-05,11603290,Morgann,"Jenn was very easy to work with.  She made sure the condo was very clean upon our arrival.  She was able to be flexible with our travel schedule, making our stay that much more comfortable.  The condo is very homey, and there was lots of good, easy to find information so we could maximize our time there. Definitely will consider staying again, should we need a place in downtown Seattle."
3040278,37295908,2015-07-06,26224351,David,"Not much else can be said but phenomenal.  The two bedroom unit has an amazing view, wonderful kitchen to cook, and just a lovely ambiance to relax and enjoy.  Highly recommend NOT renting a vehicle if able to walk on foot.  Just minutes (walking) to EMP and downtown.  Would highly recommend this place, and hope to visit again. Seattle is gorgeous! "
3040278,37637820,2015-07-09,28020649,Sonia,"Jenn's condo in the Queen Ann section of Seattle was perfect...great location, an amazing view day or night as advertised and a comfortable, beautifully decorated apartment with everything we needed for our stay. Jenn herself was great, providing us with lots of useful info and suggestions. It was a pleasure to have the chance to meet and chat with her."
3040278,37751797,2015-07-10,33077853,Kelly,"Great place - very convenient location!  Jenn was great about providing information about check-in and lefts tons of info in the condo regarding restaurant recommendations, places to go see, etc.  It was pretty warm when we were there, and there is no a/c, but she did leave fans there, and in the evening there was a nice breeze due to the location so we were fine.  Would definitely stay here again!"
3040278,38253653,2015-07-14,28825408,Patti,Great view and Jenn was available to help with any questions we had!  
3040278,38406169,2015-07-15,23778968,Roisin And Iain,"Amazing place, great location. Would definitely stay here again and Jenn was so helpful and friendly!"
3040278,38579701,2015-07-17,4282052,Ruth,"Jenn communicated fully and immediately once our booking had been made, as well as throughout our stay. She has plenty of guides and materials about the city of Seattle on hand, and she is complete in her instructions about the condo. The photographs and descriptions of the flat are detailed and accurate. The neighborhood is quiet and the condo is situated very close to the sites and the bustle of the downtown. The view from the small balcony is wonderful--we sat out there for coffee in the morning and for drinks well into the evening. The condo itself is outfitted with everything you might need. We would definitely book to stay here again. Thanks for such a wonderful time! 
"
3040278,39142285,2015-07-21,10315282,Stefan,"100% recomondation to all visitors of Seattle. 
Pros: all sightseeing could be done by foot, great view from the balcony, style of the flat
Cons: none"
3040278,39738437,2015-07-26,3190678,Phil,Awesome time.   Location great.  We walked to pike place market through sculpture park.  We walked to space needle.  We took bus to safeco field.  We had rental car and ventured to Fremont woodland park Rei store and Ballard locks.  Jenn place center to it all. 
3040278,40194105,2015-07-29,24533822,Sally,"A great place to stay, with a lovely view.  Lots of handy hints and whimsical notes left by Jenn were so helpful.  "
3040278,40419068,2015-07-31,1273117,Robert,"'Amazing View' was everything we wanted for our stay in Seattle.  The apartment has a great view of Elliot Bay and the shoreline was a safe walk distances away.  In this day of 'IKEA' furnished places, it was refreshing to stay in a place that was personalized and comfortable.  "
3040278,40568113,2015-08-01,1723645,Jennifer,"Jenn's place was terrific-the view and location not to be surpassed!
Everything we needed-"
3040278,41192906,2015-08-05,29956273,Brian,"First, let me say that I would recommend this listing to anyone.  It is conveniently located and a quality apartment at a fair price for the location.  I felt the host was a very good communicator and very prompt in her responses.  Any questions I had were promptly answered and she always made herself available.  

I liked the following things about the apartment: 1) The view off the balcony.  You can seat two on the balcony and honestly if I was sitting in the apartment it was on the balcony. 2) The host has many kitchen items available for use if you would like to cook. 3) There is onsite parking in a secure garage.  You never have to worry about your car.  4) The location is a couple blocks from the Space Needle and the Science Center.  In a whim we decided to go to an IMAX movie and it was a 3-4 block walk.  5) Pike Place Market is about 1 mile away.  We took a cab/Lyft/Uber to the market and walked back.   6) There was a large grocery store nearby if you need anything. 7) The furniture was classy looking and comfortable.  8) The wireless internet was fast and reliable.

Only one thing struck me as a (email hidden)ere is no air conditioning.  This is clearly stated in the listing so there is no deception...just take note if you plan to visit in July and August.  The apartment is exposed to the afternoon sun and it heats up quickly.  This is not normally an issue in Seattle as the weather is usually cool.  But, I traveled at the end of July and August when the outdoor temperatures reached 90.  There was also no rain during my 2 week trip to the Pacific Northwest.  However, the host does have numerous fans for your use (2 in the master bedroom, 1 small one in the living room, and 1 in the guest bedroom).  After the sun went down the apartment quickly became more tolerable as there are many windows.

Overall, I would not hesitate to rent this apartment again especially at cooler times during the year."
3040278,41426487,2015-08-07,10666799,Kalani,"Jenn gave a detailed message on how to arrive to the apartment. 

She met us at the garage and took us up to the apartment to give us a tour. She also gave us great recommendations of where to eat, visit, and catch a good view of Seattle. 

We walked along the waterfront to Pike's Place, it took about twenty minutes. The Space Needle and Chihuly Glass & Garden is about a ten minute walk. 

The only bummer about this place is we didn't stay longer! Would love to come back if we ever come back to Seattle. 
"
3040278,41717053,2015-08-09,23880726,Rob,"Lovely unit very close to the major attractions, and it was easy to get downtown. Nice view overlooking Puget sound."
3040278,42244726,2015-08-12,25790444,Mark,"Jenn's Amazing View, Amazing Location holds up to the name. We found the unit to appear as advertised in the photos,tidy and clean. It is close to the touristy activities (seattle center,space needle) and about a $6 uber ride to the sports stadiums/pike place market. Jenn has a binder she prepared with a bunch of her local suggestions on food/drink locations, the ones we tried were on point! We had a great time and the unit felt like home! "
3040278,42515682,2015-08-14,14506637,Vanessa,"Jenn's place is fantastic - it feels very homey, has a great view and is amazingly located in a quiet neighborhood just a door away from many of Seattle's attractions. And Jenn is such a thoughtful host, anticipating our needs, answering our questions promptly and making great suggestions (that binder of hers demonstrates such care). We would definitely book with Jenn again. Thanks again for a wonderful stay."
3040278,44088955,2015-08-24,22569960,Mauricette,"Great host, stunning view. Jenn was very responsive, caring and very helpful indeed. The condo is in a great, lively location, walking distance to the places of interest and a great supermarket.
Best choice for visiting Seattle. "
3040278,44514927,2015-08-27,11407839,Sam,"I went to Seattle with my Dad and Uncle as we try to see  a baseball game in a new city each year and this year was Seattle.  I have used various other B&B's in other city's and have had positive experiences but Jenn was above and beyond helpful.  She was in constant contact and ensuring that we had everything we needed at all times.  The apartment itself is amazing with a great view and most importantly in a perfect location...I cannot stress how great the location is.  Jenn is not joking when she says that you do not need a car.  I am 27 and my Dad and Unlce are in their 60's and do not like to walk much more than a couple blocks.  Between Uber and the ideal location of the apartment we never needed a car and were very glad that we opted out of renting a car.  The bottom line is that Jenn is most interactive, helpful and concerned host (in a good way) possible.  Combine that with her perfect location, you cannot go wrong!  Highly recommend her! "
3040278,44749805,2015-08-29,28288759,William,Jenn is an amazing host and her space couldn't have been better for our precruise stay.  We arrived early and she was so accommodating for a luggage drop off.  The condo is in the heart of Queen Anne and within walking distance to all the touristy attractions.  The view was wow!  It was also very nice to have coffee and all the condiments available.  Jenn was just a text away at all times and her dinner recommendations were perfect.  We much enjoyed our stay and will be back!!!
3040278,45233806,2015-09-01,24364519,Emily,"What a beautiful condo! More amenities than I even have at home - no detail went over looked! So well decorated to make you feel completely welcomed and comfortable. 

The view was fantastic and I wish we could have stayed longer! The neighborhood is absolutely perfect. A $6 Uber ride from the downtown Westlake station and a very brief walk to ""Seattle Center"" which has the Space Needle, Chihuly Gardens and Glass, Key Arena, and Armory which hosts an upscale food court, Children's Museum, and function space. "
3040278,45492683,2015-09-03,40541059,Ole,"We were staying for 2 nights at Jen's place and we had a wonderful time. The place is very clean, with a great view and has more than enough space for four adults. It's location is perfect with everything easily accessible on foot. Jennifer is a fantastic host who made us feel welcome and was always available for questions/restaurant recommendations and so on. We highly recommend this place for everyone who wants to spend some time in Seattle."
3040278,45652285,2015-09-05,27294852,Jonathan,"Jenn and her place are awesome!

Her instructions were clear and easy to follow.

The condo location is pretty much perfect and is in walking distance of all the major Seattle landmarks (Pike Place, Space Needle, etc.). 

I was able to go to leisurely walk to Pike Place Market (twice), Pioneer Square, and Myrtle Edwards park along the Waterfront all within the course of a single day.

Much thanks to Jenn for opening up her place to visitors. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Seattle.

She was warm, responsive, and accommodating from the beginning, helping us with early check-in and parking. She was always available for us. Her place in Queen Anne was airy, well-kept, and comfortable, with a fantastic view. I would love to come back and stay again! What a fantastic host and location. "
3040278,46693959,2015-09-13,30709806,Naomi,"Location and unit were amazing.  Jenn was fabulous - absolutely flexible with a varying arrival time.  Lots of tips, notes, articles, on the city.  For my first time using Air BnB, it met and exceeded mine and my friends expectations.  So great to have a ""home"" to come back to after a long day.  "
3040278,46907682,2015-09-14,28784214,Kassie,"Jenn's place is great!  Great location, very welcoming, clean and cozy.  It was the perfect size for two couples.  We rode the train up from Portland for a Mariners game and a Seattle overnighter.  Had we stayed longer it would have had everything we needed.  We'll definitely try and book this place again."

The location is excellent. It's an easy walk to the Space Needle, the sculpture garden, Lower Queen Anne, and Belltown. In quick walks from the apartment we liked the Boat House Cafe and Petit Toulouse for eats. "

Carol provided a fantastic breakfast with eggs toasts yogurt and French press for coffee. Her place is fantastic, my boyfriend and I really felt super well there: we enjoyed the atmosphere of her house, we will be back for sure! 

Also, her house is very well situated in downtown seattle, we were able to tour the city walking and never needed to take a transportation to her place. 

I recommend it!"
1856970,10679966,2014-03-03,50274,J,"A beautiful bedroom in a lovely historic house with a warm and welcoming host - what more could you ask for?  This was a great location - a 15 minute walk up from the light rail and through the International District (or a bus ride up Jackson St), accessible to the University District, to Pike's Place Market and downtown.  We walked to the convention center, easily.  For anyone on foot and bus-capable, this is a central location.  Appreciated Carol's flexibility and refund when we had to leave early.  Hope we will be back."
1856970,10827778,2014-03-09,4937963,Mary-Jane,Carol is a delightful host. After my long journey she greeted me warmly and made me feel so comfortable and at home. The room with a private bath is lovely and the bed super comfy. Carols place is very close to downtown Seattle and parking was easy to find on her street. I will definitely stay again on my next trip to Seattle. 
1856970,10867075,2014-03-10,267667,Kenneth,carol was very welcoming and I loved the quaint room. She also accommodated my bicycle!! great stay/great location.
1856970,10933767,2014-03-13,4937963,Mary-Jane,"My second stay at Carol's was comfortable and enjoyable. The bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom was close to the bedroom, clean and with a great shower and tub. We toured the downtown area on foot on a lovely warm afternoon. Parking was not a problem at all, as there is free (and available) parking all along her street. Carol went out of her way to make my stay comfortable, had wonderful hot coffee waiting for me each morning, and offered me breakfast as well. I highly recommend Carol's place for anyone visiting Seattle. "
1856970,11025564,2014-03-17,12030867,Geof,"The room was comfortable and private.  There is plenty of space to put your things.  The bed is more comfortable than my own.  Carol is awesome. She was extremely friendly and easy to chat with.  We spent each morning talking over breakfast.  She was also helpful and ready to hand out any information about the area I needed.  Her home provides easy access to downtown, either a short bus or comfortable walk.
10/10 Would stay again."
1856970,11187075,2014-03-24,3613138,Eszter,"Carol is a thoughtful and wonderfully kind hostess who will make you comfortable in her home. I was at a week-long conference during my stay and really appreciated being able to come home to such a calm environment. Stepping through the door into Carol's home brought back memories of old New England-style houses that smelled sweet and had high beds and soft couches. That and waking up to the sound of seagulls made it almost-just almost-like being on vacation.

Location-wise, Carol's home is well-served by buses, and is within a ten minute walk of downtown (and light-rail stop from airport). While I was there this street was lined with blossoming cherry trees! "
1856970,11270717,2014-03-27,5619410,Bekah,"Carol was so kind and welcoming! We loved her cozy home and comfy bed. Her cat Mimi was so sweet. We only wished the weather was better, so we could've walked around her neighborhood more. Parking was easy and free! We also liked that she had maps and guides to help us plan our day. We would totally go back!"
1856970,11330511,2014-03-30,6745131,James,"What a lovely place! My wife and I spent two nights at Carol's. We were so happy with it we would definitely consider staying there again. The space is colorful, filled with books, and, better than all of that, Carol is there! She is such a friendly and generous person. This place would be hard to beat."
1856970,11376836,2014-03-31,6075211,Charlie,"My girlfriend and I wanted a quick trip to Seattle and found Carol’s place to be exactly what we needed. Carol was a great host. She was knowledgeable about the area and provided prompt replies to our emails. Her house was close enough to downtown that we chose to walk where we wanted to go. There are bus lines near her home too and Carol has schedules available if needed. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was clean. In the morning, Carol provided coffee and yogurt. I would recommend staying here as it was a comfortable and pleasant experience. As an added bonus Carol has a cute kitty cat.  "
1856970,11461700,2014-04-03,10595161,Lin,"Staying in Carol's place might be my favorite part for my entire trip in Seattle. The room is really clean, cozy and the bed is probably the most comfortable bed ever! The location is great, walking distance to the international district light rail station. Carol is extremely nice and warm. She prepared some travel maps and traveling size shampoo for the visitors which is so sweet and thoughtful! I had a great time hanging out with her , her family and friend. They gave me a tour in Seattle! I will highly recommend this place!
"
1856970,11554164,2014-04-07,13257175,Kristen,"This was not only our first time using Airbnb, but also our first trip to Seattle. Carol was quite a warm welcome for us. She was very friendly and hospitable, offering us food, coffee, and conversation every morning. Being new to the area, she was also super helpful with recommendations for restaurants and locations. The room was perfect for my boyfriend and I.  Plenty of room and closet space for the 2 of us. It was very clean and comfortable with fresh sheets and towels there upon on our arrival. The location was great for us as well, being only a $12 Uber ride from the heart of downtown. Carol also recommended using the light rail which is within walking distance from her place!  
All in all, my boyfriend and I had a great experience and LOVED staying with Carol. Next time we visit Seattle, we will stay there again. :-)"
1856970,11608540,2014-04-08,13159929,Shaoyi,"This is a beautifully decorated, homy, comfortable, clean home. It is a nice neighborhood, and we enjoyed walking to a Vietnamese restaurant nearby. Carol was super accommodating and patient with us, as our plans were changing and we didn't know if or when we would be arriving until the last minute. We were happy with out short stay here, as we were on the move from California to Alaska."
1856970,11781894,2014-04-14,14056226,Joseph,"Carol is awesome!  Very kind, did plenty of research based on what I was visiting for (restaurants and night life!) and was extremely accommodating with my arrival time being pushed back due to traffic.  The place was great, comfortable and quiet.  Carol was very engaging but not at all intrusive, which was a perfect balance for me.  The house is a bit older, so if you are a very light sleeper some of the sounds may keep you up, but I had no problem personally (I am not the lightest sleeper, but I'm also not dead to the world when sleeping!).  I just noticed it when I would get in and the house was quiet - but it didn't prohibit me from falling asleep at all.  The location was great, a relatively easy walk to the downtown/Pike's Market area (the primary reason for my trip).  

I would definitely recommend this place, and will likely look to book with Carol again next time I'm in Seattle for work or for personal travel.  Thank you!!  "
1856970,11935122,2014-04-19,13937880,Fen & Glenn,"We had a very pleasant stay at Carol's while in Seattle. Her home was very clean, the bedroom was spacious and comfortable, and most of all, Carol was a very gracious host. She offered french-pressed coffee, yogurt, cheese and toast for breakfast - which was very much appreciated because we were famished. 

The location was very convenient - we were able to get to all the places we wanted to see by foot (~20 mins to train station, ~25 mins to Pike Place Market). An added bonus to Carol's place was that it is only a couple minutes away from a very good Sichuan restaurant (Sichuanese Cuisine Restaurant). 

Since we only stayed one night, we didn't get to enjoy her beautiful backyard. It would be a great place to read a book during the day. And lastly, on the day that we checked-out, Carol suggested that we leave our backpacks at her house and to return later in the day to retrieve them. This was great because it enabled us to navigate around the city without the extra weight.

Carol - thanks again for everything."
1856970,12003830,2014-04-21,13132004,Monica,"Our stay at Carol’s house was wonderful. The house was kept clean and the room was spacious with a very comfortable bed. It was a quiet and safe neighborhood and very convenient to many amenities and tour sites either by car, public transport or walking. Carol was such a warm and welcoming host, she made sure we’ve got everything we needed and know our way around. We also enjoyed her little kitty Mimi’s company too. Thanks Carol for your great hospitality!"
1856970,12222181,2014-04-26,14287796,Heather,"Carol's home is a lovely place to stay in a great location. The bed is more comfortable than I have slept in at fancy hotels! Carol was there to welcome me after midnight, and there to wish me well when I left at 7am on the first day. She was friendly and informative, and if I come back to Seattle, I hope to get the room again."
1856970,12279738,2014-04-28,12712184,Alyssa,"My boyfriend and I really enjoyed staying at Carol’s house. The house, room, and bathroom were clean and comfortable, and we slept really well. The house is in walking distance from many of the nice areas of Seattle like Pioneer Square, downtown, and Capitol Hill. Taking the bus to and from the house is easy as well. Carol was a welcoming host, and was interested in ensuring that we enjoyed our experience in the city. We would absolutely recommend to anyone to stay with Carol, and would definitely contact her again next time we plan to spend the night in Seattle."
1856970,12407124,2014-05-01,13856658,Amanda,"Wondeful, invisting host. My husband and I loved staying here. I definitely reccommend it to anyone visiting the Seattle area!"
1856970,12549817,2014-05-05,13546022,Kyle,"A friend and I decided to randomly visit Seattle, and we read wonderful reviews on Carol. I thought, ""well she must be a good person! Everybody keeps writing good things about her!"". Well, I am now one of those people. Carol was an unbelievably gracious host. She was willing to answer any questions we had, gave us suggestions on local places to eat and visit, and had breakfast ready for us each morning. She was always open to having conversations, as well. Plus, her home is beautiful and is in a good location.  If you're reading this and if you don't quite know where to stay, stay here. Seriously. You won't regret it. "
1856970,12797514,2014-05-11,2036533,Eric,"I just stayed with Carol for a few days in Seattle, and I really enjoyed it.  She is a sweet, friendly person who wants you to have a good experience.  It's conveniently located.  It took me about 15 minutes to walk to the light rail station, and about 20 minutes to walk downtown.  As to her house itself, the description on Airbnb doesn't do it justice.  It's charming and comfortable.  There is a patio in front where you can relax and enjoy a nice view, and a beautiful garden in back.  You do have to share a bathroom, and because this was the first time I'd done that on Airbnb, I was a bit nervous.  No need to be!  The bathroom is located at the end of the same little hallway as your bedroom, and I never felt a lack of privacy.  It just wasn't an issue at all.  I strongly recommend staying at Carol's place.    


 "
1856970,12938240,2014-05-14,15156221,Marissa,"Carol is a warm hostess and was great to stay with. The room was neat and clean, as was her house. It is charming and a unique place to stay. It is about a 25 minute walk to downtown or the U District. I did not have a car during my stay and did not experiment with public transportation, but I understand there is a bus nearby and I'm sure Carol would be happy to familiarize guests with the local transit options. Overall, a great experience!

"
1856970,12946655,2014-05-15,10700425,Jeanne,"Carol was welcoming and comfortable.  Talking with her felt like talking with an old friend.  I only wish we had not been exhausted with jet lag and could have spent more time getting to visit with her.  Her house is charming, clean and a very comfortable bed.  She served a substantial breakfast of Seattle coffee and my favorite bread"
1856970,13034628,2014-05-18,11377426,Elaine,Carol was nice. The room was clean as expected. Her cat was friendly. Her house was close to bus station and link rail international/ Chinatown station. We liked walking to Pike market and nearby attraction. Her house is a perfect stay for downtown Seattle. 
1856970,13111039,2014-05-19,1846226,Yvette,My 5 year old son and I had a lovely stay in this cozy and comfortable house. We enjoyed proximity to downtown and many of the places we went to. The yard is an urban oasis and I wish we could have used it more. 
1856970,13140002,2014-05-20,1730858,Lisa,"My sister and I enjoyed staying at Carol's! It was an incredibly easy walk downtown, and the best was very comfortable. Carol had to get up early in the morning, but she still made us coffee and laid out a selection of food for us. I'd definitely recommend staying here! "
1856970,13253663,2014-05-23,99266,Robert,"Carol's place was excellent & well located. Everything was organized, clean and welcoming. I only had a day there - in Seattle for work briefly - but expect to go back to stay again. Carol's garden was a great place to sit in the morning with coffee, and it's nice to have so many EXCELLENT Vietnamese restaurants within a block of two. Thanks!"
1856970,13540432,2014-05-30,12579791,Erwin,"Our stay in Seattle will certainly remain a very special experience thanks to Carol who was extremely friendly and warm-hearted. She instantly made us feel at home in her cosy kitchen and showed us her lovely garden where you can sit and relax.
Our room  was spacious with a  large closet and a very comfortable bed;
the  bathroom also rather big and very clean.
Carol's place is in a pleasant residential area, where  you can easily find parking space. Furthermore it is not far away from Chinatown with its excellent and reasonably-priced Korean and Chinese restaurants. Major places in  downtown Seattle can be reached in a 25 minute - walk. 
We enjoyed how openly Carol responded to us, how helpful she was  and how interesting our conversation with her turned out to be.
Thank you, Carol, we'll try to come again!
"
1856970,13735807,2014-06-03,7731455,Eshani,"Carol was such a wonderful host! Her home is located in such a convienient location, close to the highways and to the city. The room was spacious and comfortable, and the bathroom was updated and clean. Carol's backyard is a peaceful little oasis to sit and read a book or drink some tea. I was also able to find street parking in front of her house without any issues. 

Carol was warm and welcoming, and made me feel so comfortable while staying with her. She is easy to talk to, and it truly felt like I was staying with a close friend rather than a host. She also has the most adorable cat, Mimi. I was out early for most of my stay, and Carol so thoughtfully provided some easy grab and go breakfast items such as yogurt, muffins, and fruit. 

I would highly recommend staying with Carol if you are visiting Seattle!"
1856970,13859079,2014-06-06,15872692,Kirk,"The room is clean and large, and the bed is very comfortable. The rest of the home is also clean and comfy. Carol is sweet and helpful, and treated me like family. I would definitely stay at her home again!"
1856970,13923071,2014-06-08,13947088,Peter,"It was great to stay st Carol's in Seattle! The house is a lovely old dwelling and Carol keeps it beautifully. The garden is a delight with a number of outdoor spaces. We appreciated Carol's clear instructions, local knowledge and interest in the world. The location is close to the international district and an easy bus trip to downtown. "
1856970,14080155,2014-06-11,10424386,Darlene,"Carol is a wonderfully warm host and her house is like a home! From use of the kitchen to use of the garden, I really enjoyed my time! Mimi the car helped with ensuring I was enjoying myself too lol. "
1856970,14117811,2014-06-12,14189309,Donna,"Very nice, pretty, well kept and clean home. Carol did a great job making us feel at home, offering tea and some things to nibble on if we needed it. The room itself is very cozy, the bed comfortable, bedding soft, and pillows fluffy (much better than the bed on the cruise we had for the past week!). The bathroom is shared, although there was absolutely no issue with that, and it is just outside the bedroom, with, as an added bonus, a door that closes off the hallway with the bedroom and bath. 

The house is very close to a few bus stops, and the light rail isn't TOO far either (we walked from the house there after a full day of walking all over- but we only had bookbags and a single rolling duffle- if you have a lot more, catch the bus) and Carol left an assortment of bus schedules and attraction brochures on the dresser as well. If you are more of a walking type, the hill is not steep (compared to most of the other streets) for Jackson St, and you can take that all the way down to the water. All in all, a great experience with a lovely host in a great city!"
1856970,14172041,2014-06-13,16499951,Hillary-Ann,"Carol was a fantastic hostess! The room was spacious, clean and ready with fresh towels upon my arrival. She had a light breakfast and coffee available on my next morning, and I truly enjoyed holding a conversation with her! She's as warm and very welcoming as her home is charming! Such a delight.

I definitely recommend!"
1856970,14292629,2014-06-16,15472766,Esther,"This was our first airbnb experience and it was a good one. Carol is warm and her home is clean and comfortable. Very comfy bed! We didn't have a car and were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go, including to the light rail to the airport. Nothing fancy about Carol's--just homey and restful, which was just what we needed."
1856970,14354464,2014-06-17,2258437,Kari,"Our one-night stay with Carol was perfect.  The home is very nice and centrally located--we walked to Chinatown, Pioneer Square, Pike's Place Market, etc.  And easy on-street parking, to boot.  Thanks, Carol!"
1856970,14512902,2014-06-21,1002191,David,"Thoroughly enjoyed staying with Carol. Gracious host who provided helpful hints for places to see and eat,  accommodations were comfortable with great views and nice back porch. Location was walking distance to Chinatown/ little Saigon and downtown area. Many great Asian restaurants nearby. Be advised that if you  are coming via the airport light rail, and plan to walk with luggage, its about 3/4 to 1 mile uphill to her house.  "
1856970,14865839,2014-06-28,4118224,Ashley,Carol was the sweetest lady and host. She has a lovely home that is very welcoming. The room is very cute and comfortable. Her location is perfect if you like to walk and see the city. She is a 20 minute walk to the prime part of Seattle and minutes away from Stumptown coffee. I highly recommend staying with Carol you wont be disappointed. 
1856970,14969727,2014-06-30,14403689,Kana,"We stayed with carol for one night while visiting Seattle for a Mariners game. She was very quick to respond to any message and a fantastic hostess! Very kind, great to talk to. Her house is very cute and close to the stadium. We were able to walk to the baseball stadium and to Pikes place.  Great location, great trip!"
1856970,15103269,2014-07-02,7292114,Mary And Joseph,"This was more than a stay, it was a real connection. Even though Carol was working long hours when we were visiting Seattle, we managed to chat and I felt that we had a lot in common, including our attitudes towards life. This is probably because Carol has created a warm and welcoming atmosphere in her beautiful heritage home. This house is located within walking distance to downtown and Safeco field, which was very convenient for us as my partner, Joseph was going to a Mariners game while I could take the bus to explore Fremont's Sunday market. Also close to International Village - I highly recommend ""Jade Garden"" for dim sum. 

Carol's home is comfortable and very clean and tidy. You have full use of the kitchen and she provides breakfast items for you to help yourself. However, she made sure to leave us a pot of French press coffee before she left for work! 

Highly recommended- we are certainly going to try to stay here again the next time we're in Seattle.

Thank you Carol for sharing your home and your life with us."
1856970,15213507,2014-07-05,1698430,Maartje,"Carol was really nice and we felt very welcome. She had yoghurt, fruit, bread and something sweet every morning for us. The room is great. Nice bed, enough room and clean. We were also very welcome to use the chairs in her backyard to relax and read. The house is a bit noisy and the bathroom is shared with Carol & her grandson, but if you don't mind: great place to stay.

One thing to consider is the neighbourhoud. It is a 20 minute walk to downtown, which is great, but the neighbourhoud didn't feel the safest. We always took the bus back at night instead of walking back. There is one really good Vietnamese restaurant though (entrance at the end of a parking lot, but really worth going there!). But maybe Carol has some good tips for other nice places around."
1856970,15262851,2014-07-06,15328220,Wei,"Carol was really nice and fantastic hostess. She has a lovely house with a beautiful backyard. This house is located within walking distance to downtown,  light rail station and Chinatown. The room we lived in is comfortable, clean and with enough space. Carol had yoghurt, fruit, cake in the morning for us. I highly recommend this place, we are certainly going to stay here again the next time we're in Seattle."
1856970,15569900,2014-07-12,6026059,Virginia,"We enjoyed our 2 stays with Carol very much. She is a warm, welcoming, generous host. Her home is charming, set in a beautiful city garden, which were so enjoyable this summer. Besides her warm welcome, we were grateful for the home's central location, with a bus stop to downtown just 5 minutes away, as well as convenient neighborhood restaurants and easy parking. We would surely choose Carol's house for another visit to Seattle."
1856970,15631112,2014-07-13,6678428,Morgan,"Carol is lovely! She takes the time to make your stay as comfortable and private as possible. It was hot when we visited, so she got us a fan or our room. The location of this place also cannot be beat. Only minutes away by walking, bus or car to the wharf and the like. The bed was comfortable, the room just as described, carols company was lovely, and she even greeted us with coffee when we woke up and offered us breakfast. This is a great place to stay in Seattle !"
1856970,15758043,2014-07-15,1904475,Alison And Les,"Carol is a lovely person who graciously received us at her home at a late hour, as we had warned her could be the case. We had a short chat before all heading to our beds. Our room was extremely comfortable and we slept well: Carol had set up a cooling fan for us because she considered the weather was much hotter than usual.
In the morning we got to know each other better over the lovely ""continental"" breakfast that Carol provided. She advised us on transport for our planned activities of the day and was most helpful.
We stayed 2 nights in Carol's cute home. It is very conveniently located for a Seattle explorations. We safely parked our car in the street outside.
We highly recommend Carol and her AirBNB."
1856970,15910751,2014-07-18,15676086,Karoliina,"We had such a great stay at Carol's. Her house is beautiful and the location is perfect, only 15 min walk to downtown. The room was clean and cosy.  We had lovely conversations with Carol on all sorts off topics. Would definitely stay there again!"
1856970,16003971,2014-07-20,3149182,Michèle,"Carol was absolutely wonderful and the room was just as beautiful as on the pictures (and the bed really is super comfortable, and the breakfast was light and delicious -- exactly how we like it)! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there and I have nothing bad to say. The only recommendation I would give to future travelers: The walk to her place from the Amtrak station on South King felt a bit sketchy on some parts (the neighborhood where she lives is beautiful though!) – so next time I'd take the bus if arriving in the evening, or walk on Jackson instead."
1856970,17039535,2014-08-06,14172009,Dar,We totally enjoyed our stay with Carol Hughes.  It felt more like being with a family member or an old friend.  It was great.  Carol did everything to make our stay enjoyable with a lovely breakfast and conversation every morning.  Our room was comfortable and clean as was the bathroom.  There was no problem with coming and going at our leisure.  Carol was very knowledgable   with the area and helped with sightseeing activities.  Her home is located close to just about everything.  There are awesome running paths close to her home which we enjoyed throughout our stay. I would definitely stay with Carol again should we ever return to the Seattle area. 
1856970,17560814,2014-08-14,14954975,Silke,"The stay at Carol's house was perfect.
The room and the shared bathroom were nice, clean and comfortable. 
We enjoyed staying here. Breakfast in the morning was really good ( fruits, cake and coffee), and we really enjoyed talking to Carol.
We would definetely stay again! !"
1856970,17758995,2014-08-17,17185827,Hiro,"I had a great time during 3 days stay at Carol's home.She was such a nice woman so that I did enjoy everything what I experiences there.She made me a delicious breakfast every morning, which made me happy. She also asked me about what I did in Seattle every day, so I felt stay with my family or close friends. Thank you so much for everything!!   "
1856970,18004525,2014-08-20,1392160,Linda-Lou,"Carol has a very nice and clean home. The room was great. Location-wise it is a little too far to walk to the center, however, taxi proces are reasonable. Would definitely stay there again."
1856970,18171711,2014-08-23,16791906,Steve,"Thanks Carol for a wonderful stay. I appreciated your friendly and attentive hosting. Your place is homely and welcoming. It is a comfortable 15 minute walk to King St station to access the airport, and an easy 30 minute walk to access the waterfront and downtown. Thanks for helping make my stay so fulfilling. I recommend your place."
1856970,18330478,2014-08-25,12298957,Barbara,"Carol was a pleasure to meet-we arrived almost on midnight and she waited up for us and helped with our bags. The bed was most comfortable and breakfast delightful, she even went out and bought cereal for me for the second morning.  The location was very good close to Pioneer square, Pike street markets and downtown which we were able to walk to.
We have no hesitation in recommending her lovely heritage home to other visitors to Seattle"
1856970,18468493,2014-08-27,15621142,Richmond,"We stayed for one day on our way back from a road trip up the Oregon Coast. The place was beautiful and the room was perfect. Everything was exactly as advertised. We didn't get a chance to meet Carol in person because we checked in and immediately went to see a Mariners game. Although we didn't meet in person, gaining access to the house was easy seamless. We wish he had more time to spend in town because the house was beautiful."
1856970,18538579,2014-08-28,15398133,Laura,"What a pleasure! 
Carol welcomed me, made me feel at home and made sure I knew where everything was and how to use it.
The room is pleasant, the bed is comfortable and the garden is a refuge in the heart of the city.

1856970,19005680,2014-09-04,12106952,Linda,"Carol made us feel very welcome to her house despite our late arrival. The bedroom was large enough for us with a comfortable bed, albeit a bit shortish. We enjoyed the French press coffee and the muffins for breakfast. We stayed just one night but we wished we could have stayed longer in her beautiful house and to explore nearby International District/Chinatown. It is a 15 minute walk uphill from King Street Station to Carol's house. If we would return to Seattle we would love to staying in Carol's house again. "
1856970,19132283,2014-09-07,18582728,Tanja,"Carol was a great host and took good care of us. We had good conversations & got a delicious organic breakfast in the morning. The walk from the International District station to Carol's place took about 20minutes. We took the Jackson street more often, because it was better enlightened. The house is on a walking distance from the sightseeings. We would definetly stay at Carol's place again! all the best to Carol wishes the social girls. :)"

Hot delicious coffee in the morning along with yogurt, fruit, pastry. Great tips on local restaurants in walking distance.  The bed was super comfy and one of the best night's sleep we had while on vacation. The gardens out back were lovely, refreshing, remarkable quiet ... we would definitely stay there again (as an FYI if you are traveling w/ children, it's quite a steep climb from street level up the stairs to the front door and no hand rail - the only thing that made me a smidge nervous with my fearless kiddo). "

Her place is in a very convenient location with regards to the train and bus access. If ever in the Seattle area again will look to have tea and conversation with this wonderful woman.   "
1856970,20490215,2014-09-30,13411560,Jenny,If you are skim reading reviews- look no further for a great place to stay in Seattle. Carols house is very calm  and she is just the best host we have found so far. She is a very interesting lady and we spent several hours chatting with her and getting great ideas for things to do and places to eat. The house is approx 30 mins walk from the city but on a good bus route and close to the Amtrak station. Breakfast each morning was always fresh and delicious. All in all - a fantastic stay - thank you!

The house is located in an area that is easily accessible from the I-5 highway, in a neighborhood that has small, quiet streets with trees and houses with little yards richly filled with a variety of shrubs and flowers. The house makes a very nice impression of stability and warmth. The room was as I was hoping, cozy and comfortable, bathroom clean and the shower worked great. Morning coffee with a toast and fruit was perfect. The host has a talent to make me wanting to come back. "

1856970,21146035,2014-10-12,11802021,Gyouri,"Carol was a very nice and helpful host. I arrived in Seattle from Vancouver at night and couldn't figure out her place well at first time. Thankfully, she picked me up from a bus stop. And also, she arranged a cab when I left. For the breakfast, she considered various tastes of guests and prepared. She is interested in various culture and enjoy learning about the culture via her guests. I also had a good time while I talk with her.
Her place is clean and tidy. I could hear train(?) sound sometimes, but didn't bother me a lot.

캐롤은 친절한 집주인입니다. 저는 밴쿠버에서 시애틀로 버스를 타고 갔는데 집 근처까지 갔는데 밤이라서 무섭기도 하고 길을 잘 못찾겠더라구요. 전화했더니 직접 차로 픽업도 나와주시고 집도 깨끗했습니다. 떠날 때는 공항까지 가는법도 잘 알려줬고 역까지 데러다 주려고 했는데 개인적인 사정이 생겨서 옐로우 캡을 어레인지 해주었습니다. 
정 많으신 분이라 이야기 하시는 것 좋아하시고 사람들 통해서 다른나라 문화에 대해 듣는 것 좋아하셔서 저녁 때 같이 차마시고 이야기하면서 저도 재미있게 지냈던 것 같습니다.
집은 깨끗하구요, 기본적으로 조용하긴 한데 가끔 기차소리(?) 같은게 들리더라구요. 저는 크게 신경 쓰이지는 않았어요."
1856970,21306724,2014-10-14,21785506,Kasey,"As a young person, this was a great place to come ""home"" to. Clean, private, and easily accessible from downtown by transit, walking, or cab. Carol was kind and made everything so smooth! The stadiums are so close, we wish we had bought tickets to a game (where everyone was!). Make sure you know where you'd like to go for food/drinks/fun before you head out."
1856970,21428272,2014-10-17,21378068,Corey,Fantastic room in a central location. Carol was incredibly nice and helpful with suggestions. I woke up to a breakfast and good conversation the next morning. It was an incredible experience. I will absolutely stay here again on my way back into Seattle.

Carol has a large house so the room seems very private. The bed was very big and comfortable.
Carol was extraodinary host, very friendly and she even prepared a breakfast for us. She also gave sightseeing tips for Seattle which were very useful. Also she let us keep the bags with her after the checkout time which was very convenient for us.
Thanks a lot!"

The bed was very comfortable & the bathroom was very clean. She gave me a huge poppyseed muffin & a yogurt for breakfast which was so nice! Even though you are sharing the house it's really like you have your own suite because you can close yourself off completely from the main part of the house. I would stay here again for sure.
1856970,21955764,2014-10-27,3795439,Joyce,"Carol is a wonderful host!  She was very accommodating and friendly, she made us feel comfortable sharing her home for the night.   Her charming and clean historical home is conveniently located in the Central District.

We enjoyed our interaction with her, and were pleasantly surprised to have tea and toast for breakfast.  Thank you Carol!"

She is very nice and friendly. And her house is also very clean and warm. 
All my family are in different country, but Carol makes me feel like I'm at home. I like to sit in the kitchen and talk with her. Thank you Carol for helping complete my ""secret mission""! I will go back some day and still stay in you place.
I think the greatest gain from this trip is met Carol.  :-)"
1856970,22369076,2014-11-04,282122,Samantha,"I had a great time staying in Carol's home. She has a cute private room to stay in, didn't mind me using the bathroom for quite a while in the morning while getting ready for an interview, and makes a great cup of coffee.
She is also walking distance from the light rail, which makes transportation from the airport a lot simpler and more affordable. I hope to stay with her again in the future :)"
1856970,22490662,2014-11-08,12279985,Sophie,"Lovely, warm, homely environment, easy access to Downtown. Bed is brilliantly comfy and we loved giving the cat a stroke, too.

The area felt very safe with ample street parking.   The central banking district was within walking distance.  There were an assortment of amazing Vietnamese and Chinese restaurants very close.  

Overall, I would highly recommend Carol and her accommodations to anyone.   The next time I stay in Seattle, Carol's place will be on the top of my list.   Good lodging fills up fast, so make sure to book your trip well in advance.  

Great work Carol!   "

Was there to greet me and give me a tour of the house & rules.  We had great conversations, but she also gave me my space to relax and nap when I needed it.  She had coffee and breakfast for me each morning, even when she wasn't able to be there when I got up.  Listing accurately represented her home, and the neighborhood was safe at all hours and easily accessible by at least 3 major bus lines within a 5 minute walk.  Coffee, cat, and conversation - wonderful!  Would absolutely stay here again next time I'm in the area."

On top of being full of valuable information, she went up and beyond in terms of being a host -- everything from having a clean bathroom to giving us delicious coffee and snacks (every morning!). Her cat Mimi was also nice to have around. Location wasn't half bad either for someone who has never been to the city. I would recommend Carol's home for anyone looking for a comfortable and relaxed Seattle experience. "

Her home was really beautiful, the bedroom was lovely, as described. I was visiting as a tourist and really appreciated that she had a collection of tourist maps of the city. After we arrived by car we walked everywhere we wanted to go from her home, which included downtown, Pike's Market and the space needle. I would definitely stay with Carol again if I was visiting Seattle. "

The accommodation description was just as it said it was, and my 2 night stay there was very comfortable. Carol provided shampoo, and toothpaste if you forget/ unable to pack some along with you, and was also very respectful of the guests privacy as well. The cat and dog Mimi, and Evie won't bother you, but Mimi is quite friendly if you choose to interact with her. Evie prefers her own privacy as well. 

The location is also quite convenient should you need to take the rail, as it is a brisk 10-15 minute walk from the rail station. If you'd prefer not to walk, Uber/ Lift is available and would be probably a $3-5 dollar ride from the station. I'm not too sure if there's a bus line that passes by the main street that the house is located.  "

She welcomed us around 930 at night and recommended some eating places. We went the wrong way against her suggestions accidentally. On the mysterious and cold roads, many places were closed to eat, but we did end up finally finding a delicious restaurant. Carol was direct in her expectations and directions which was lovely. The next morning, she provided some yummy breakfast fruit and pastries. In an embarrassing attempt to take the bus short changed, she gave us some quarters to make the cut."

She is the person who is very ndustrious, and is gentle.
I can speak English little bit.But She was going to understand my English.I had a very wonderful experience in first airbnb.
You must experience it, too!"
1856970,31105555,2015-05-02,3681282,Liyan,"I am glad to have stayed at Carol's. She is very welcoming and nice so I really enjoyed my stay. I love the bedroom and bathroom. The room is cosy and exudes a relaxing, warm vibe. I could stay in all day. I like the victorian bathtub, it is fitting with the 1900s feel of the house. I think Carol is thoughtful with the decor and furnishing of her home, making it a comfortable, homely  experience for guests. She has a well-tended garden with lots of flowers. She also has a cat Mimi who is shy but friendly once she warms up! The first morning she mewed morning greetings and approached me for a rub when I emerged from the room. I really appreciate Carol's hospitality when I was there. Thank you."
1856970,31455138,2015-05-05,8970418,Xue,Very good experience in Seattle. The room was very clean and cute. Everything was ready when I arrived. And Carol was a very nice host and provided all tourism info if you asked. Breakfast was very nice as well. The restroom was always clean and cozy
1856970,31518364,2015-05-06,29147824,Shelley,"We had a great time with Carol in her lovely house. Easy to find from King St station. Only problem was not enough time to chat, we got on so well. Great location for downtown Seattle."
1856970,31635830,2015-05-08,28352642,Mary,Carol kept in touch with me and was ready for me when I arrived. The room and bed is Goldilocks-worthy; juuust right. Nothing was too much trouble. I felt welcome.
1856970,31898221,2015-05-11,15241377,Anna,"Carol is an absolute sweetheart. My friend and I stayed at Carol's during a weekend trip to Seattle. It was honestly one of the easiest airbnb experience ever. Upon arrival, I told Carol that I would check in at 6 PM. On the day of, we arrived an hour earlier than expected and she was able to check us in early. The room was clean and very cozy. It definitely has a homey feeling to it. In the morning, Carol set out some breakfast for us - coffee, tea, muffins, toasts, fruits. We really appreciated her hospitality. 

Location-wise, this place is great. It's close to downtown. You can either walk or take public transportation there. Street parking was easy. We never had a problem with that.

The next time that I visit Seattle, I will definitely stay at Carol's."
1856970,32072660,2015-05-13,28581156,Cara,Carol's house is located in a very nice neighborhood of Seattle.  The room was perfect for me and my boyfriend.  We are young and it was roughly a 30 minute walk for us to get to downtown/Pike Place area.  The walk brings you through chinatown which felt very safe.  It's an easy and mostly downhill walk there.  We often caught the bus back up to King St.  The location is very convenient with the bus being so close and Carol was able to offer us a lot of freedom as far as what time we came and went.  Would definitely stay here again.
1856970,32188455,2015-05-15,17793210,Ma,"Carol was welcomed me with hospitality, and she generously let me use her kitchen to cook, which I loved. The bed was cozy and the room was clean. I liked it!"
1856970,32685318,2015-05-20,29678756,Heather,"Contact with Carol before we arrived was great.  She answered all queries quickly and provided useful information.  The room was exactly as advertised.  It was clean, quiet, spacious and nicely decorated, plus the bed was very comfy.  Getting to Carol's was a straightforward walk from the Light Rail stop, and getting to town was easy too.  Carol provided a tasty and filling breakfast in the morning with nice strong coffee.  Our host was able to answer questions about Seattle, and she provided some useful sightseeing tips.  We'd definitely stay with Carol again.  Great trip!"
1856970,33248851,2015-05-26,30126148,Minsuk,"Carol was an excellent host. She genuinely welcomed us to her house. Everything was accurate as the page suggested. The location was great, and the house was clean. We also loved her breakfasts and cat!"
1856970,33483047,2015-05-28,34145465,Brian,Carol was very welcoming and made sure that I was comfortable during my stay. The room is exactly as advertised and is extremely comfortable for the price. The location is great and its a short walk into downtown. All in all it was a wonderful stay.
1856970,33579643,2015-05-30,1507287,Bev,"What a lovely airbnb experience, top marks in every category!  Carol met us on our arrival, was friendly, helpful, provided a nice breakfast, even drove us to get our rental car.  The room is private, clean and comfortable,  the shared bathroom was always available and very clean.  We enjoyed sharing stories in the evening with Carol!  The yard is a peaceful retreat with privacy on the patios.  This is a great spot with a fantastic host!"
1856970,33995538,2015-06-03,24353694,Angela,Carol was extremely welcoming.  The neighbourhood was charming and the description of the property accurate.
1856970,34876252,2015-06-13,33220951,Henry,"Carol was a wonderful host. She was graciously accommodating from the minute I contacted her to when we said our goodbyes. I only stayed two nights but those two nights were very comfortable. Carol made double sure that I had all my needs met and was very flexible with my schedule (or lack of one). The room she provided was cozy and clean as was the rest of the residence. I also became good friends with her cat Mimi, but sadly never met her dog. Carol's residence is located in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance to the International District as well as Downtown area. That of course depends on one's lower extremities fortitude. I have walked from downtown to the house during the night and have had no issues with safety. In fact I really enjoyed the tranquil walks through the cool and breezy night. 
In addition to standard hospitality, Carol provided a light breakfast of high quality cheeses, breads, and fruit, which was more than I expected as I am not much of a breakfast person. She values organic produce and is a big fan of Trader Joe's :)
During my free time at Carol's place I enjoyed some really good conversations with her. We chatted about a range of things, from social issues to history. 
In summary, I am more than glad I ended up staying over at Carol's place. I would highly recommend Carol's place for any kind person looking for a wonderful experience while visiting Seattle.

1856970,36191364,2015-06-26,27075940,Kathrin,"Carol has a wonderful home in Seattle, one I could instantly connect to. The room is spacious and welcoming, the apartment gives enough space including having breakfast in the kitchen, and Carol is a wonderful person with great values that made my stay very pleasant."
1856970,36261064,2015-06-27,27791589,Anna & Richard,Carol was very nice and accommodating and even made us breakfast. The room was lovely and as described. We especially enjoyed the beautiful back garden and overall location. Would absolutely stay there again!
1856970,37163853,2015-07-05,772018,Joshua,Our stay here was one of our best airbnb experiences. Carol was really nice and accommodating to us and she even made us coffee in the morning. The place and the backyard was really lovely and spacious (and super clean!) - I would say it's even nicer than what I previously expected from the pictures. A very classy place at a perfect location in Seattle as well.
1856970,37295090,2015-07-06,5805720,Keith,Carol was a great host and the accommodation was perfect for us. The fresh coffee and bagels for breakfast were an unexpected treat!

1856970,37955181,2015-07-12,30386706,Sandy,"Carol was very friendly and accommodating to my sister and I. When we arrived, Carol gave us a nice quick tour of her lovely home and made us feel less like strangers and more like guests. She even provided us with breakfast in the morning even though we didn't arrange anything in advanced, which was really awesome! Our room was charming and spotless, with a nice closet to hang up our coats and another hall closet where we could leave our luggage. 

Carol's home is down the street from Little Saigon and pretty close to the I-5 if you are planning to drive around Seattle. There are tons of nearby restaurants if the bar scene in Downtown Seattle isn't your thing. 

Overall, I highly recommend Carol's home. "
1856970,38602825,2015-07-17,33350936,Nona,"The room is exactly the same as described. It's very clean, simple but has all the detailed stuff in the room. The bed is super comfortable. I also love the bedding sheet. The bathroom is shared, but never having a problems when use it. Good location -close to the bus and link train. I love the garden, feel peace and relaxing. Carol is a great host. She made me feel like home, at same time I have my privacy.  Carol makes good coffee, it's very tasty. Every morning I look forward to the coffee. Thanks Carol for providing such a comfortable place. I enjoy the stay with Carol very much. Highly recommend for people to stay. "
1856970,38995692,2015-07-20,16040606,Kelsey,"Carol is an excellent host, and her home is such a nice place to stay. Carol is the kind of host that knows the right time to hold a conversation and the right time to lend some privacy. The room is well-decorated, quiet, and clean. The rest of the house is also welcoming and clean. A great place to stay!"
1856970,39288577,2015-07-22,33751644,Bob,"Carol is a super host, a warm and caring person who was attentive to our needs.  Her location is an easy walk or drive  (1.5 miles downhill) to downtown Seattle, the Pike Place Market, and the ferry terminals.  Her house provides a quiet and serene setting, especially her backyard. The accommodations are clean and thoughtful. We maintained our privacy, even though we shared a bath, kitchen, and other common areas.  I would definitely stay at Carol's again if I were coming back to Seattle. "
1856970,39619684,2015-07-25,17611717,Jennifer,"We had a wonderful experience with Carol! She was helpful with input on places to visit while in Seattle. The space was clean, neat, welcoming, and beautiful. "

1856970,40920244,2015-08-03,34371982,Dianne,"The house was very well located in the Chinatown / international District and was close to major bus routes , that were easily accessible and within walking distance from S. King Street . Carol came to collect me close to the light rail station when I arrived , which was very kind of her. The room was clean and well appointed and the bed most comfortable . She gave me a healthy  and very tasty breakfast in the mornings and allowed me to use the refrigerator .The only problems I had was that I was not told that there were 19 rather steep steps to climb to the entrance of the house and as I arrived with one large suitcase and a smaller one, as I was going on a 7 day cruise to Alaska from Seattle , it was very difficult for me to carry them up the stairs , especially as I am almost 70 years old. Also Carol informed me I would share the bathroom with one lodger , Nick , who worked at night,  and would seldom be there , but in fact I had to share the bathroom with her as well, and this was not always convenient. "
1856970,43039440,2015-08-17,33754024,Julian,"Absolutely perfect! Carol is a very nice and caring host, the room is super clean, it has an amazing bed and the bathroom is super clean! Carol even provided breakfast for us! 
A perfect location for exploring the city, which is a 20-35 min walk or a 8 min bus drive. However, it is nice that her home is in a calm neighbourhood."

1856970,44143099,2015-08-24,37992840,Jessica,"Carol is very sweet, and she promptly responds to messages. Her home is lovely (I especially liked the clawfoot tub!) and on a fairly quiet street. The room was clean and tidy. There were other guests staying in her home, but given that we (my boyfriend and I) spent a relatively small amount of time in the house, we did not cross paths with the other guests. The walk to Pike Place market was about 35 minutes, so we decided to use car2go to travel to the downtown area. Carol was also helpful in providing information about the bus line nearby her house. She kindly offered us breakfast, but given that we wanted to eat at various restaurants during our stay, we declined her offer. "
1856970,45244492,2015-09-01,33240993,Timmy,"It was great! My girl Carol was super kind, easy to talk to, and was super understanding. Also she fed me breakfest, twas great."

1856970,46455286,2015-09-10,34229969,Jeremy,"Carol was a great host and definitely offered me tips and ideas on what to do and how to get around the city. One of the important things for me is that an Airbnb has great internet and Carol's place did not disappoint. Also, it was very sweet, she set me up with coffee and orange juice and even offered me bagels in the morning.

I can't imagine a better host in Seattle and anyone would be lucky to find this reservation open."
1856970,46709339,2015-09-13,36483655,Elizabeth,"Our first Airbnb trip to Carol's place was a wonderful experience. The room and amenities were exactly as described in the listing and Carol was more than accommodating. Being 7 months pregnant when we visited, it was important to be close to attractions and have a comfortable place to rest. Everything about our stay was perfect. Carol offered us coffee and breakfast every morning and was eager to help us navigate our chosen tourist sites. Thank you Carol for your kindness!"
1856970,47064596,2015-09-15,39897563,Mick,"We were greeted at the steps upon arrival and we all sat together that afternoon for drinks in the garden.
Neighbourhood was reasonably quiet and walking distance to all the city offers."
1856970,47389663,2015-09-18,27390743,Kevin,"A great host with a great home. She did everything possible to make us feel welcome and comfortable during our stay. She explained all the house rules clearly and gave us a quick tour of the house. She's there if you need her but also gives you plenty of space to just unwind after a long day. She serves you a hearty breakfast in the morning. You can tell her that you won't be needing breakfast if you plan on eating at one of the many great eateries in Seattle but it's always a plus to be able to grab a bagel before heading out. Speaking of Seattle, Carol's home is in such a great location! You can walk to many places in Downtown or drive a really short distance to wherever you want to go (e.g., Space Needle, Pike's Market, Safeco Field, etc). Very convenient! For all you pet lovers, Carol has a wonderful, affectionate cat by the name of Mimi. She greeted us at the door and immediately started brushing up against us and purring. After a long day out and about in Seattle, I always looked forward to coming back to Carol's home and unwinding with Mimi. The room, the bathroom, the kitchen, the entire house overall was fabulous. The neighborhood is very quiet with plenty of parking if you drive."

I enjoyed meeting Carol and spending a little time with her. I wish it could have been longer. Her cat Mimi is great. 
Everything about my visit was perfect. Thank you Carol."
1856970,48184013,2015-09-24,36590623,Huiqing,Friendly. Kind. Offers help if asked and gives privacy if wanted. Just wants to help you have a good time.

her house is very exactly as described in her profile. wood floors and high ceilings, delicious coffee and big garden (we saw some squirrels btw)
near of the most important attractions and easy to come from the airport or the downtown.

if you want to go to Seattle don't think anymore and stay in Carol´s home. you will love (website hidden).- if you love cats, you will love mimi."
1856970,49596637,2015-10-05,13717193,Brian,Carol was an awesome host!  The place is exactly as described and very quiet.  She had a small breakfast and French press coffee each morning.

She was also very quick to respond to my messages, which was great. Her home is very beautiful and is exactly as it was described – it was also very comfortable. Location was great! Close enough to everything and less than a $10 uber ride, and parking was easy to find at her home. Highly recommended :)"

She offered great conversation, yet was respectful of my privacy as well. I'm glad I stayed. Mimi the cat, is a sweetheart."

The location is convenient to many different neighborhoods - Cap Hill up the street, international food blocks away, SODO a quick drive where my friends were staying. Bonus for breakfast and coffee every morning and a great claw foot shower! Recommend Carol's home as a great home base for anyone staying in the area. "

Carol's place is really nice and cozy. The bedroom and bathroom were clean and warm all the time. There are fruits, coffee and muffin ready every morning, and there's always hot tea waiting for me when I came back!  And Mimi is such a lovely cat. 
I love walking around and  was able to walk to pioneer square, pike market and many other places easily. Her house is also only a few steps away from bus stops, and there are so many great restaurants around!
Carol was welcoming and thoughtful the whole time. She  offered me great advices on where to eat and visit and was always available for help. I really enjoyed talking with her. Also I wanna thank Nick for giving me a ride to the train station!
In general my stay here was amazing. I would definitely love to try the cabin if I can visit Seattle again.
Thank you both so much for everything "

It is well located in a quiet section very close to Chinatown, Little Saigon, Pioneer Square, and only a bus ride away from downtown Seattle.

No only that but her cat, Mimi, is super sweet.
Charming neighborhood to be in, a few minutes walking to a bus stop or the Link Light Rail. 
Now, it's not a matter of ""if"" I go back to Seattle, but when. And when I do, Carol's house has a spot in my heart and I will certainly be in touch with her again. 
Superb experience."
1856970,57932475,2015-12-30,50530769,Tomohide,She was so kind and a bed room was comfortable. She told us house rules politely on first day. It was really nice to see her:)

She was able to accommodate me last minute and I had a very smooth check in process despite arriving late at night. The apartment was beautiful and I couldn't have asked for a better location.

7179337,39676090,2015-07-25,19810703,Linnea,"Emma was a fantastic host and her condo was perfect for our night in Seattle. She was super communicative and even has a website with clear directions on how to check in, top ten sights in Seattle, places to eat/explore, etc. Very, very helpful for an out-of-town visitor. She even let us check in early without much advance notice. The condo was in a perfect location (right by Pike's Market), but was still quiet enough to get a fabulous night's sleep. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in Seattle."
7179337,40636074,2015-08-01,5017688,Shirley,Emma's place was wonderful.  It was conveniently located right next to pike's place and exactly what we were looking for given our short stay in Seattle.  Could not have been more pleased and look forward to staying again the next time I'm in Seattle. 
7179337,42603262,2015-08-14,38022380,Kegan,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7179337,45417199,2015-09-02,18958387,Harrison,"Our overnight stay with Emma was wonderful! The apartment was all we needed as a small family and was exactly where we wanted to be. Only a short walk from Pikes place market, there are so many different places to shop, eat and explore. As food and beer fans we tried the The Pike Brewing Company for dinner. It is located right next to the building and has a fantastic menu with an even better beer selection (they also do take out orders so you can call and walk down to pick it up!). We were traveling with our 6 month old son, so having a pack and play crib and umbrella stroller provided in the apartment is wonderful for those traveling without them. So many great amenities are provided in this perfectly sized accommodation, not to mention the great view from the small balcony off the living room and the rooftop deck just 1 1/2 flights of stairs down! A parking spot is located in the secure garage across the street which is a luxury in the city so you never have to pay for expensive parking around the market and surrounding areas.

Overall, our stay was wonderful, we would highly recommend and we will definitely be back!"
7179337,46109115,2015-09-07,5962232,Melissa,"This space is great for a traveler or two seeking a home base located right next to the grandiose Pike Place. Emma accommodated us on less than 24 hour notice! An absolute blessing for our last minute impromptu trip. Keep in mind the apartment isn't lived in by your host, it's a rental property so there's a few overseen essentials that we forgot to pack (i.e. toothpaste). The apartment building is very modern and open with great communal areas, was always quiet and felt super safe. The parking isn't located in the building but very close by. Our favorite part about the space was watching the sun rise from the balcony made for just us two. "
7179337,47324405,2015-09-17,15696100,Michael,"The apartment was easy to find with accessible parking, clean and ready for us to arrive.  The location was great as its walking distance to some great places to eat and explore like, Pike's Place market.  Thank you for having us."
7179337,48935146,2015-09-29,6944014,Daryl,"The apartment is just as described - comfortable, clean, & close to everything, yet tucked away and quiet. The building's grill deck is  huge and offers a great view as well.  Super, responsive hosts. "
7179337,50795518,2015-10-14,31390767,Minna,Emma's arrangement is so efficient! Everything u may need is in the file she offers! Great location. Quiet place to rest during trip. Great experience! 
7179337,51831638,2015-10-24,6006255,Amy,"This home away from home was a great spot for our short overnight getaway.  It was in a great location and Emma left a guide to local spots to help us take advantage of area highlights.  We reached out 2 days before arrival and didn't hear back until the day of our check in.  We would have appreciated a quicker turnaround in communication.  That being said, when we arrived and had difficulty with the locks Emma was immediately responsive and got us in right away.  The apartment was very clean and tidy with everything we needed available right at our fingertips.  The view from the small balcony and the patio below were AMAZING! Thank you for a wonderful stay.  We hope to come back again."
7179337,54475285,2015-11-20,28059292,Kelly,Great place to stay in the heart of it all. Communication with the host was a bit difficult at first but everything worked out great in the end. Much thanks and look forward to possibly staying again!
7179337,55139696,2015-11-28,25874057,Robert,"As a first time Airbnb user, the experience with Emma and this location was a very smooth experience. Host was accommodating and polite throughout our stay and the location was clean and fully stocked with all the necessary supplies for a quick getaway. The rooftop access has a beautiful view of the bay as well as street exit to avoid the steep walk up Post Alley. Location within the city was superb and having a parking spot was quite helpful. Bed was a little small, but I'm a little gigantic, so I can't hold that against them :)

"
7179337,57524492,2015-12-27,20316651,Hubie,"The location is amazing!  The back door puts you at the south end of the Pike Place Market, and the front door is a block (and a long flight of stairs down) from the waterfront.  The Seattle Art Museum and Benaroya Hall are also nearby.  It was easy walking to Belltown or Pioneer Place.  The International District and Seattle Center are a little further walk or a short ride.  Parking was included which is a bonus if you want to roam further afield.  

Communication through airbnb was easy, and Emma provides a packet with all the info you need.  As might be expected downtown, space is at a premium, and the closets are already filled.  Wifi was easy.  Cable/satellite tv but only public stations available; the door was drafty, but then I wasn't in Seattle to sit around and watch tv."
7718139,41563591,2015-08-07,40480307,Kyle,"We came into Seattle later than expected and needed a place to stay for the night. We got in touch with Perry at the last minute and he replied right away and had everything ready for us when we got to his place. The tent was set up very nicely with a comfortable air mattress, sleeping bags, pillows and a blanket. The outdoor bathroom was a nice touch and although we didn't use the hot tub, it seemed great! We're definitely happy we stayed with Perry. "
7718139,41895244,2015-08-09,23724998,Jay,"Perry was a great host, super accommodating and friendly. Very cool setup out back with a relaxed vibe, Perry's paving the way for Glamping worldwide. Perry's almost as chilled out as his loveable dog. Can't wait to come back next summer."
7718139,43167624,2015-08-17,40783192,Pierre,"My first week-end in Seattle was wonderful in a lovely garden with super tomatoes.
Perry was super to help me and his information were great. 
He is fun, smart, very social and he has an international mind. He told me that volunteering helps him to give a sense to his life, I would say that meeting people like him helps me to give sense to humanity.
Walter (the dog) is really cool.
The coffie machine is better than Starbucks.
A number one choice if you want be in town for a good price.
The Eden is close to Beacon Hill and Mount Baker Station (the city train is the fastest way to move in Seattle from airport to downtown)
Thanks Man, hope to see you in Belgium "
7718139,44053144,2015-08-23,22319750,Tom,"Perry is a very friendly and affable chap who made me feel welcome the moment I arrived. The tent was nice and comfortable. The facilities where very good (nice coffee machine). 

Location is good - very close to light rail and not far from down town at all. I liked playing with the dog - friendly and playful. 

I would definitely come back again next time I am in Seattle (unless its winter and freezing cold ha)

My only suggestion to people staying is to bring earplugs (as I would camping anywhere). The planes flying over usually stop at night but you need them if you want a lay in, as they fly pretty low. earplugs do the trick though."
5602370,45765567,2015-09-06,29102709,Diana,"Couldn't have asked for a nicer place to stay in Seattle. Our hosts were very friendly, helpful and we enjoyed spending some time with them! Great location-- easy access to the bus, walking distance to our daughter's home, and a great jog around the lake. One of our favorite restaurant, Duke's Chowder House is in the neighborhood as well. The  flat was clean and roomy. We hope to stay again on our next trip to Seattle!"
2976798,25516831,2015-01-18,25616702,Harrison,"This was my first time using air Bnb and I loved it. My gf and I stayed in Patricia's place for one weekend. Not like the picture shown, the place is actually pretty spaceful. We got to use the private bathroom and a study room next to the bedroom. Patricia was very friendly and helpful. She listed all the good places to visit for us and stocked the fridge with snacks.   Public transportation is good around the area(near UW). A lot of buses go through this place so busing to downtown should be around 20min. Anyways, I had a wonderful stay and hope more people would come to Patricia's! "
2976798,25943986,2015-01-30,25867621,Jordan,"I was fortunate enough to spend 1 week with Patricia in her beautiful home in Wallingford. I've used airbnb just a few times and while I've had mostly good luck there is always a level of uncertainty about what you're really going to get as far as the quality, privacy, amenities, etc etc. In this case, I got very lucky! While it's described as a private room, I had the entire downstairs of her house which is basically like a 1 bed 1 bath apartment in itself. Although you don't have your own private kitchen, Patricia provides a coffee maker, toaster, and mini fridge fully stocked with coffee, fruits, yogurt, gronola, milk and all kinds of goodies to basically make you fully self-sufficient downstairs. On the other hand, if you like some interaction and Patricia is home, she is always willing to have a good conversation or point you in the right direction for things to do or places eat. On a couple of occasions she actually cooked me a hot breakfast which was incredibly delicious and we talked all morning. 

All in all, this was a great place to stay in Seattle and Patricia really made me feel like I was at home. I hope to visit again sometime! "
2976798,26104607,2015-02-03,11793358,Holly,"Patricia was so nice and engaging from right when I met her.  She has a cute craftsman style house that has a back entrance that goes right downstairs to your room. Also downstairs there is a full bathroom and den that she has stocked with a small fridge, tea and coffee maker, and toaster oven.  I happen to be there over the super bowl weekend and she invited me to watch it with her and her friends which was so fun! Her location is essentially 10 -15 mins away from everything by car and the neighborhood is in a quiet and pretty area.  Most importantly I know that Patricia and I have become friends and will stay in touch!  That is what the Airbnb community is all about!"
2976798,26431437,2015-02-12,20276049,Nicola,"We only stayed one night at Patricia's place. Unfortunately. We could have imagined ourselves staying many more nights. Patricia instantly made us feel at home. At the same time, the accommodation could almost be described as an own place since there is an extra entrance, a separate bathroom, plus a room with everything you need to prepare a small breakfast or to relax after a day in the city. On top of this, it was lovely to share Patricia's excitement for AirBnB. "
2976798,26614622,2015-02-16,26338073,Sabrina,"Patricia was very patient and understanding when we were unsure of what time we would get into the city. The room and the book room was larger than what the pictures seemed. It was very clean and she also supplied a lot of good snack, which is a huge plus for me. The area was not too bad in terms of traveling around. "
2976798,27080265,2015-02-24,25522052,Karen,"Patricia is one of those people you first meet and you instantly feel like you've known her forever.  She is so kind and welcoming making you feel right at home.  The location is perfect distance to UW district and many surrounding restaurants, shops, bus line.  My expectations were over exceeded with the accommodations and we plan to definitely use her in the near future!  "
2976798,27220201,2015-02-28,9862518,Bowen,"Patricia is really kind, friendly, enthusiastic, and helpful during my stay in her sweet house. She helped me a lot to find a new apt to settle down in Seattle. She provided one of my best airbnb experience so far. The location is great, as well as all the supplies inside the house. I highly recommend Patricia and her house to others :D"
2976798,27583764,2015-03-08,24898525,Alece,"My friends and I had a blast staying with Pat! The space was perfect and she was amazingly kind and caring. She even made us breakfast! The neighborhood was also fantastic with a beautiful view of downtown across Lake Union. I was able to spend several days walking the Wallingford, Fremont, and U District neighborhoods exploring all the cute little shops and enjoying Gas Works Park. It was the perfect introduction to the city and a new friend!"
2976798,29042133,2015-04-03,27255027,Lihua,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay in Patricia’s lovely home. Her house is a typical Seattle local residence. The neighborhood is calm and charming, with a walk distance within 10 minutes to University of Washington. Driving to downtown and airport is also very convenient. Inside the house everything is settled and arranged very nice, effectively and reasonably. We feel very comfortable in the house. For most of all, Patricia’s and his son shows their best hospitality to us. They offer us very good service, prepare bred, jams, fruits for us. Patricia has even parked her car out beside the street to avoid block our car easily going in and out, although there are enough space for two cars in her yard. We had a short stay of 4 nights there, but after we leave we still remember and even miss her home. "
2976798,30447671,2015-04-22,26816022,Chelsea,This was my first Airbnb experience and it was amazing! Patricia was a very gracious and friendly host that provided a very comfortable room with breakfast food and other essentials. The space was perfect and at a great cost. Patricia was very helpful to give us tips on great places to eat at and visit. This location was also ideal since the neighborhood is very beautiful and quiet with great connections to transit. We rented a car but did not need to use it except for trips outside the city. Also there are many local places to eat and shop at within walking distance. Overall I loved staying here because Patricia was so welcoming and the location was ideal. Can't wait to visit Seattle again!
2976798,34733410,2015-06-11,507977,Orla,"We had a fantastic stay with Patricia. She was a wonderful host and gave us great info on places to go in the area. We had a very comfortable stay with access to our own den with a fridge, kettle, coffee maker etc. A master bebroom with a lovely comfortable bed, and our own bathroom with a great shower. She kindly let us park in her car port and there are great bus services into downtown seattle if you don't want to take a car, which were great. I would recommend anyone to stay here, it was like staying with friends."
2976798,35349304,2015-06-17,1587751,Laura,"Patricia was a most generous host. She was in good touch before my arrival and incredibly accommodating during my stay. The space is wonderful, with a den that's also your own private breakfast room, with cable tv and all. Really comfortable and charming; great location, too, for access to the U."
2976798,35633954,2015-06-21,24123524,Vivian,"I absolutely loved staying here. Patricia was a gracious host who made us feel so welcomed and at home. Guests have private access to her entire basement area which includes a bedroom, bathroom, and den. Everything was so warm and inviting, and she definitely went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable. Some mornings she even made us muffins! A thousand star rating for Patricia! "
2976798,36776961,2015-07-01,32022799,Hanae,"Patricia was a wonderful host, very welcoming and accommodating. I really loved to talk with her. I can’t forget her muffins, waffles and cups of tea with honey. 
The room was very clean and lovely. A comfortable bed, own breakfast space, snacks, coffee, tea, all you need for your comfortable stay is there. The location is great as well, easy to go to UW and downtown. I highly recommend you this place!!"
2976798,37376360,2015-07-06,357711,Emily,"A friend and I stayed over the 4th of July holiday and I loved it! Perfect setting and location! Loved the view from the front! Close to everything I like to do in (email hidden)d Patricia, even though we didn't see her much, was a very lovely lady, very sweet, kind and accommodating.  This place is clean and charming and just what we needed. Thank you Patricia! I'd be happy to come back.  (My friend got the bedroom and I used the futon in the den and slept like a baby).
...oh...and I love the extra touches like the Tulley's coffee, milk, bread,cereal, fruit, tea...etc! very nice to have that in the morning!"
2976798,39519252,2015-07-24,7103868,John,This was my first AirBnB experience and it is going to be hard to top this one. Patricia was great and treated us like old friends. The space was as described and it was a quiet and safe neighborhood. Parking on the street in Seattle is not easy but Patricia made sure we got a space in her drive. I highly reccomend anyone who wants a relaxed stay after a hectic day in Seattle to consider this one.
2976798,41393675,2015-08-07,21286120,Bastien,"Nous avons passé un séjour très agréable, Patricia est d'une gentillesse incroyable, prête à tout pour rendre service. Le logement est parfait, complètement indépendant avec un petit salon mis à disposition. Il y avait même de quoi déjeuner! Une adresse à recommander chaudement. Encore un grand merci à Patricia pour ce superbe séjour!"
2976798,41655872,2015-08-08,38499898,Erin,"Loved, loved, loved it! Patricia was super sweet and helpful.  The accommodations were exactly as listed and we felt very comfortable. The location is great. We were within walking distance of the lake (Union, I think) and Gas Works park. It was right in the heart of the city, but was quiet and almost felt like a nice small town. I would absolutely stay here again and will recommend it to anyone who is traveling to Seattle. "
2976798,41970699,2015-08-10,36581979,Tami,"My stay was delightful. Patricia was a warm and welcoming hostess! So many features make this the perfect place to stay: very clean, private area with den, refrigerator-toaster-coffee pot, snack food items, TV, books and parking! My first Airbnb experience and I cannot imagine I will ever have a more comfortable stay. 
Great restaurant within walking distance and bus transportation to anywhere within 2 blocks."
2976798,43033176,2015-08-17,5662369,Emily,Patricia was friendly and welcoming.  She helped make our stay comfortable and was very accommodating to our requests.  The space was very big and the bed is comfortable.  Thanks for hosting us.
2976798,44224301,2015-08-24,11493097,Leonora,"Great setup, with guests being given the entire downstairs of this house. The house is in a nice neighbourhood, and just a minute's walk from beautiful Union Lake. Patricia is a lovely and kind host, who even treated us to baked muffins in the morning. Convenient and well priced - easy to recommend. "
2976798,45801546,2015-09-06,39157085,Ashley,Patricia was very welcoming! She greeted us late at night when our flight was delayed.
2976798,46375727,2015-09-10,5201391,Mary,"Pat couldn't have been a better host. She was kind and welcoming and clearly enjoys hosting Airbnb guests. She went out of her way to see that we had a number of conveniences we really appreciated. Loved the location... close to downtown, walkable to a favorite restaurant, quick access to the highway. A perfect stop over on our way to Vancouver."
2976798,46601225,2015-09-12,30296277,Amy,"Patricia was an incredible host. Her house is so cute, and has the perfect basement for airbnb's. It included breakfast, which I didn't realize before booking; what a treat! We really appreciated her knowledge and suggestions of what to do in the city. The house was located near bus stops, making it a breeze to get downtown. Great area, we highly suggest staying here!"
2976798,47043260,2015-09-15,37296231,Yuanjun,"Patricia is so nice and kind! It's my best choice to choose her place in Seattle. The transportation is very good that we can go downtown with route 26, 71, etc. Also it is walking distance to go to University of Washington:) Most important thing is that Patricia treated us as her family, helping us washing clothes, making muffin, keeping light on to wait us in night! I will definitely choose her again when coming to Seattle again! Thank you very much, Patricia!"
2976798,50437574,2015-10-12,11802944,Shiraz,"Wow! Seriously, wow! First of all, *great value*. The place was cozy, the location excellent (between the university and Freemont), and the cost significantly lower than any other AirBnBs I saw in the area. The description is accurate. Quite simply a great AirBnB on that basis alone.

BUT ALSO -- Patricia! Okay, so I wasn't necessarily looking for a personal experience. I had things to do. But she truly felt like a mother to me. I'm sure you've read in other reviews about the muffins -- it's not just that she bakes these fresh and great tasting muffins in the morning, it's that she bakes them *for you*. One day she even made me an egg, and drove me to my destination after breakfast, because she was heading out at the same time. She's simply a super sweet woman. We had some nice chats. By the end when I was leaving I wanted to give her a hug good bye, and I wish now that I did! And this was just from being there for 3 days! LOL. Next time I'm in Seattle, this is where I'm staying!"
2976798,50867374,2015-10-15,21765691,Helen,"We had a lovely stay at Patricia's Airbnb, she was a very welcoming and accommodating host.  We spent most of our time in Seattle walking around the neighbourhoods nearby, including The University, Wallingford, Greenlake, and Fremont.  Gasworks park is also nearby and was a highlight of our trip.  The #26 bus took us from the bus station right to Patricia's doorstep.  We didn't need any other bus, so it was easy to get around.  The bed was very comfortable, so we had a great sleep every night. "
2976798,51181943,2015-10-18,41999934,Junhong,"Patricia is really nice. My boyfriends and I arrived late than we expected because of the flight delay. Patricia was patient and showed great understanding of that situation. And the house was cute and clean. We actually had the whole downstairs including a living room with TV, sofa, computer etc. And she prepared some food and yogurt in the refrigerator, this made us feel welcomed! I really like this experience. "
2976798,51472255,2015-10-20,45246832,Matthew,"We were visiting Seattle to go visit graduate schools at the University of Washington and this airbnb was absolutely perfect for us.  The house was within easy walking distance of University and Pat was super helpful for figuring out how long it would take us to walk over.  We didn't have a car while we were in the city and it was super easy to get around from the airbnb, we walked to the University and had a super easy time taking the buses to everywhere else we wanted to go while we were visiting.

Pat gave us lots of helpful information about getting around while we visited when we asked but also gave us plenty of space/privacy.  The basement apartment is huge and really nice to spend time in.  Pat made us muffins both mornings that we stayed as well as providing us with a mini-fridge with english muffins, cereal, coffee, and tea.  We had a wonderful visit and would highly recommend this airbnb! "
2976798,51888817,2015-10-25,8804369,Tanya,"Patricia was wonderful - very welcoming and easy going. She gave us a great tip about checking out Fremont, which made for a really fun urban adventure away from the hustle of downtown. The bedroom and den WERE cozy - bed was great and the futon made for a perfect second bedroom that was virtually soundproof. And the morning muffins were perfectly timed to help us start off relaxed and well cared for. "
2976798,52224181,2015-10-27,10196064,Ann,"Patricia was a wonderful host. She went above and beyond what I expect of any host, even making me muffins the last day, and giving me an ice pack for my injured shoulder. It was really fun to talk with her. I didn't want to leave.

The location is great, and there's lots of fun boutiques and restaurants within walking distance. It's also quite close to a bus stop so I could easily get downtown."
2976798,52618212,2015-10-31,46191131,Haik,"I'm just going to thirty second all the nice things everyone else said. This was my first Airbnb and it's going to be hard to top. She's got the perfect place for this. Truly private, plenty of space, and she is a really great host. Patricia is really warm and went out of her way to make it a stress free visit (I was there for an interview). "
2976798,53957523,2015-11-15,31681291,Kathleen,Patricia is an outstanding Airbnb host.  The neighborhood is very nice.  It was so nice to stay in a residential area.  Patricia went out of her way to make my stay enjoyable.  I am definitely looking forward to staying with her when I am in Seattle again.
2976798,54585658,2015-11-22,43982504,Rebecca,"We had the most wonderful experience staying with Pat. From initial communication to the moment we left we had an amazing time. Pat was so welcoming, we made it to the house easily, it is in a fantastic location near so many great neighbourhoods and so close to the city.

The house was perfect, so lovely, warm and spacious we almost didn't want to leave. We have never felt so at home and welcomed in another persons house as we did with Pat.

She was such a kind and loving host, we had some great conversations and a cuppa with her whilst discussing travel and Australia and  have hopefully become friends for life.

I couldn't recommended staying anywhere else, this stay was idyllic and such a great overall experience of Seattle. 

 "
2976798,55790845,2015-12-06,45904419,Alexander,"First time using Airbnb and it couldn't have been better. Patricia was a warm, welcoming host who made sure I was taken care of. Thanks!"
2976798,56589969,2015-12-15,1801052,Karla,"Pat was an incredible host. I've been using airbnb for the past 4 years and this has been one of my favorite stays. Pat's home is lovely, the bed is so comfortable, and the neighborhood is situated in a great location. I couldn't have asked for a better host and home. I felt completely safe in her home and was able to explore some great areas in Seattle by foot. If you're ever in doubt about what to do or eat, Pat also has some wonderful ideas. I was pretty bummed that I had to leave Seattle so soon."
3970736,18770921,2014-08-31,930945,Sarah,"My boyfriend and I loved staying for three nights in Deborah's charming basement apartment! The space was quiet, cozy, and welcoming. Bed was very comfortable. We had our own personal entrance with several very secure and easy to use locks. The kitchen seemed fully equipped, although we opted to dine out instead of cooking in. Deborah herself lives in the house above the apartment. She was super welcoming upon our arrival, showing us the apartment, and even walking us down the street to show us the super cute coffee shop on the corner and the fun bar across the street. She provided us with lots of extras that weren't described in the posting, like umbrellas on a rainy day, Seattle maps, and much more. Such a kind woman. She was eager to make us feel at home, and we did. The apartment is in a fun neighborhood. If walking for half an hour or so doesn't intimidate you, it's not hard to walk down the steep hill to get downtown to pike's place market, shopping, restaurants, and everything else. Or, there's a bus stop only 1 minute from the apartment that takes you to the same place. The bus to get back up the hill at the end of a long, touristy day really came in handy!!! Thanks Deborah for such a wonderful stay. I will definitely recommend your place to friends who find themselves in Seattle!"
3970736,19099828,2014-09-06,4363255,Danny,"Deborah was a great host, and the apartment was as advertised. There is both a queen size bed and the most comfortable couch bed I have ever slept on. I live in Seattle (was hosting family) and will definitely be back when I have more folks in town."
3970736,20760881,2014-10-05,17725636,Paulina,"We had a great experience in Deborah's apartment thanks to its great location and our host friendliness. 

After arriving in the evening with a huge jet lag we were really thankful for the fresh bread and fruit. Our 2 year old also got some books with pictures he absolutely loved. During our stay Deborah was very helpful, she gave us a lot of information about Seattle, printed some documents for me and even offered us a ride to Renton to pick up our car!

The apartment is very clean and warm, kitchen is fully equipped (we did some cooking) with everything you might need. Internet also works well and you can even do your laundry in case you need to. On street parking is no problem.

You can experience all of that in quiet neighborhood, very close to downtown with lots of attractions within walking distance."
3970736,21225891,2014-10-13,2930247,Emily,"My friend and I had a lovely stay in Deborah's cozy basement apartment. The location is ideal and within walking distance to many of Seattle's sites and restaurants. The apartment itself is comfortable, quiet, and well-equipped. We especially appreciated the kitchen stocked with fruit, coffee, and tea, and Deborah was nice enough to lend me her hair dryer when I e-mailed her ahead of time. I would definitely recommend this listing to others staying in the area!"
3970736,21548152,2014-10-19,22177569,Devon,"We had a wonderful stay at Deborah's! Central Cozy is a warm and welcoming retreat after a day of city wandering. Everything was clean, fresh and instantly calming--with a well-stocked kitchen, comfy couch, and kale garden, Central Cozy was the ideal home away from home. Deborah was the perfect hostess going the extra mile to make sure her guests enjoy their stay. 
The listing descriptions are accurate--Central Cozy is close to several bus lines, and a couple of blocks from some great cafes. It's also within walking distance of restaurants, shops and nightlife. If you're a jogger, bring your running shoes for a spin around the neighborhood. 
Would love to stay here again!"
3970736,21890922,2014-10-26,21412290,Connie,"Deborah's ""central cozy"" is a great place to stay.  It is super clean, and comfortably decorated.   It's super close to the bus line that takes you to downtown and Pike's Market.  There is a Safeway, Trader Joe's and an organic co-op all within walking distance as well as a brew pub.   Deborah is an awesome hostess. She really takes her guests needs into consideration and helps them in any way she can.  I needed gift wrapping -  surprisingly she let me use her own supplies so that I wouldn't have to go shopping for just those items.  Deborah made our first morning so easy by providing coffee, bagels, fruit and yogurt.  Thank you Deborah, that was so thoughtful.  We look forward to returning and staying at Central Cozy again.  "
3970736,22366341,2014-11-04,21979121,Sarah,"Central Cozy was wonderful! The apartment was clean and had everything we needed during our stay. The neighborhood was great too! There are plenty of cafés, restaurants, and bars within walking distance. But most importantly we felt safe in the Central neighborhood. We did a lot of walking during our visit and we felt very safe walking around during the day and at night as well. Deborah was a wonderful host! She offered us amenities such as umbrellas and a hair dryer to use during our stay. She also had great tips about what to do in Seattle and how to get around. It is easy to say that we will stay at Central Cozy again during our next trip to Seattle! "
3970736,22545771,2014-11-09,22819725,Natalie,"Deborah was very sweet and helpful and accommodated the late check in.  She had fruits and  snacks available upon our arrival and the Central Cozy was literally very cozy and perfect for 3 women for a weekend stay.  I love the separate walkway/entrance to the apt. and location was very convenient and close to downtown (w/ local cafe/restaurants walking distance).  Would definitely recommend for a weekend stay and would definitely come back! Thanks, Deborah!"
3970736,22795601,2014-11-15,9004858,Niels,"My stay at Central Cozy was very pleasant. Deborah is easy to reach by phone and email. She gave me detailed information on public transport and communicated the access codes at a convenient time before my arrival.

The book on how to use the apartment is handy and useful. It includes information about Seattle and its neighborhoods.

The apartment is cosy and clean. Everything is in place and can be used instantly. I didn't miss a thing during my 5-day stay. The kitchen is great!

We had a nice chat during my stay. (The coupon for) Katy's Coffeeshop made me happy too. Deborah cares and that made me really feel welcome.

I will certainly try Central Cozy first if I am to stay in Seattle again!"
3970736,23066369,2014-11-22,22287669,Joseph,Deborah's apartment was very nice and was supplied with everything that I needed during my stay in Seattle. Deborah was very welcoming and was quick to respond to any queries that I had before I arrived. The apartment was really clean and tidy and I felt very comfortable during my stay there. It is in a great location and is a short walk to Capitol Hill or there are frequent buses a couple of minutes walk from the apartment. There are also lots of things to do in the immediate area and shops and bars a short walk away. I would definitely stay in the apartment again and would recommend it to anyone.
3970736,23435130,2014-12-01,20082644,Shanti,"Deborah was extremely helpful leading up to our stay in Seattle by providing us with detailed directions and guidance about parking etc... We were traveling with our four month old baby and Deborah went out of her way to provide us with a bassinet, baby blankets and baby bath which made our stay so much easier. When we arrived there was a welcome note as well as snacks which were much appreciated after our long journey traveling from New York City. The apartment itself is warm and cozy with plenty of hot water and kitchen accoutrements. Debra was a very gracious host and the location was great. I would recommend staying at Cozy Central."
3970736,23826018,2014-12-11,8936510,Edward,"Staying at Deborah's place was truly a pleasure. Great location, close to Capitol Hill, Downtown, Trader Joe's and Safeway. 
Deborah is a great host and very helpful, I would stay there again in a heartbeat."
3970736,24930310,2015-01-04,21853077,Yufang,Seattle is a very beautiful place and the place is nice too.
3970736,25362368,2015-01-13,24955569,Meg,"The care and time Deborah has put into making this space welcoming and liveable is evident everywhere you look. With supplies from the numerous markets and grocery stores nearby, one could happily stay there indefinitely. The neighborhood is fabulous - theatres, restaurants, cafes - but the block itself is quiet. Street parking was not a problem (if you plan to stay in Seattle proper you wouldn't need a car as the nearby bus line takes you right downtown). Having a washer and dryer was so helpful! All in all, this is a lovely sanctuary with a  considerate host and easy access to the best that Seattle has to offer."
3970736,30811323,2015-04-27,16547892,Michelle,"Deborah was a welcoming host and her home was a great place to stay. The kitchen and bathroom were well equipped and the place was clean and neat. She also had a binder with info on transport, recommendations for restaurants etc. which was helpful. The location was great - easy to get to downtown or other areas by bus or taxi but also very cozy and quiet."
3970736,31204939,2015-05-03,28754081,James,"Deborah was very welcoming.  We got in late the night of arrival, but she stopped and said hi the next day.  The apartment had fresh fruit and bagels for our arrival and breakfast the next morning.  The apartment was exactly as described.  Only thing to note is that the ceilings are low (I'm 6'7"" and hit my head a couple times).  Definitely not a deal breaker, but a good piece of info.

The apartment is by a bunch of bars and restaurants.  It was possible to walk to Pike Place Market and the Space Needle, which we did.

Overall a great stay! Would stay again."
3970736,31651827,2015-05-08,16509289,Jane,"Central Cozy was even better than pictures. It is a very  clean, comfortable and quiet place. It had everything I needed, including one of the most comfortable beds that I ever slept in away from home.  The location was great and I easily navigated from it to downtown central Seattle and the freeway. "
3970736,31926636,2015-05-11,13449727,Ashleigh,"Deborah was kind enough to leave us fruit, yogurt, coffee & tea upon our arrival. She was quick with guest turnover, ensuring we had access to the clean suite when we arrived. Deborah was very kind and approachable, we especially enjoyed sitting in her sunny backyard. "
3970736,32207477,2015-05-15,12829165,Gabriela,Lovely home with a lovely host! Perfect location and we couldn't have asked for anything else!!!
3970736,32523306,2015-05-19,30598334,Laura,"Great neighborhood with lots of restaurants/bars/coffee within walking distance.  The space was the perfect homebase for our family for the weekend.  Close to just about everything, but still quiet enough for our 9mo son to sleep well!"
3970736,32980911,2015-05-24,29835173,Alejandro,"This was an excellent experience and Deborah was an excellent host! We're so happy that we choose her. Umbrellas on a rainy day, fruits on arrival, and a really cozy place! Thank you so much for everything Deborah"
3970736,33440811,2015-05-28,30602065,Sila,"This is a nice space that is exactly as described. We felt very comfortable. Deborah is a very nice lady and was very accommodating. We had rented a car as well, and there was no problem finding parking near the house. Within a few blocks were some nice places to eat, but we did not venture out much at night on foot. 

Overall good experience. "
3970736,33688004,2015-05-31,11157605,Christopher & Shelby,"Deborah turned this rental into the perfect BnB and is doing an amazing job with it.  While we arrived late and were busy running around the city the rest of the stay, when we finally did me Deborah she was super nice and accomodating.  The checkin process was easy and convenient.  The listing was spot on.  The neighborhood is great with access to easy food, a great beer spot, and bars.  Quick cab or bus ride takes you to any of the sites of Seattle.  Plenty of parks and the lake within short walks.  Cute little Cafe on the corner.  Tons of Seattle ""To Dos"" and guide books in the place.  Clean and comfortable.  Great backyard to relax with a book and a beer."
3970736,34640169,2015-06-10,32062544,Derrick,"This was our first Air B&B and Deborah provided such a nice experience that we wished we could have stayed longer.  It was easy to communicate with her before we arrive to Seattle.  When we (a family of 4) did arrive, we had everything we needed to feel at home.  The sofa bed was comfortable, plenty of hot water, and we were grateful to be able to use the laundry machines.  As described, the location is very good, as we walked ~3 blocks to Trader Joe's or grabbed a coffee at Katy's around the corner before catching the bus at the same corner.  Capitol Hill restaurants are ~0.5 miles away. Deborah was also very quick and thorough to help us with any problems we had.   Central Cozy has certainly set a high standard for our future Airbnb bookings."
3970736,35314683,2015-06-17,5537719,Derek,"Deborah was a great host. We got to meet Deborah and she warmly welcomed us to Seattle. She had great advice and told us how to get around. Central cozy is in the basement, but it feels comfortable and had all the amenities we needed.  There's a lovely couch, television and even seating in the backyard to relax. She left bagels and yogurt for us and even treated us with desserts celebrating our recent marriage. The place was clean with fresh linens and towels. Deborah has really thought of everything to menus for restaurants close by to labels on all the light switches. 

Capitol hills was a fun place to stay. There's a cute coffee shop (Katy's corner with yummy bagel sandwiches and pretty good coffee) just a few houses down and a spot with hundreds of beers right across the street. Just a few blocks down there's a Safeway and a strip of restaurants. We took an Uber to Pike's market around $7 or there's a bus station close by. 

Overall we had a great trip and would stay at Deborah's place again. "
3970736,35642886,2015-06-21,14170722,Mae,"Deborah is a welcoming host, providing us with bagels and yogurt as we arrived. She was meticulous and welcoming, coming down for a casual chat once in a while. We had a good stay, the facilities were good and the place was clean, with our own laundry to use. The neighborhood is walking distance to a food places and peaceful at night. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay as deb made sure all our needs are well taken care of. "
3970736,36377793,2015-06-28,30839854,Brittany,We really enjoyed Deborah's cozy apartment. There was enough space for us and it was in a great location! Thanks again for sharing your home. 
3970736,37160362,2015-07-05,10675512,Norton,We had a wonderful stay at Deborah's. Her cozy guest apartment was well appointed and well organized. The bagels and coupon for the nearby coffee shop were a great way to welcome us. It was conveniently located and for a multi night stay was a perfect home base. 
3970736,37853565,2015-07-11,13250885,Siobhan,"Central cozy was brilliant!! Deborah went above and beyond for us and made us all feel very welcome. Transport and food options are just round the corner and Deborah also provided additional information about the area in a booklet. We loved staying here and would definitely come back. If you are going to Seattle, stay here! "
3970736,38256227,2015-07-14,29387312,Susan,"Deborah was a great hostess for our 3-night stay in Seattle.  She was incredibly responsive and made sure that we had the information we needed to find her house and access the apartment.  She was very helpful in providing information about getting around Seattle and had left bagels, fruit and coffee/tea for us.  The apartment itself was very spacious and clean and well furnished.  The location was very convenient to Seattle sights, and although we didn't take advantage of them, there was a coffee shop and bar only a 1/2 block away.  Also, since we had a rental car, we appreciated the convenient on-street parking that always seemed available.  I would definitely recommend Central Cozy for anyone visiting Seattle."
3970736,38987713,2015-07-20,25346276,LuAnn,"My husband and I and our two grown sons spent 6 nights in Deborah's apartment.  It was very comfortable  and pleasantly decorated.  The weather was great so we were able to make use of her backyard. We felt very safe in her neighborhood. There was motion lighting outside through to the entrance, a secured gate to the back yard and two locked doors to the apartment. All of these were digital. The facilities were clean and well kept. The yard was also beautifully  landscaped. We would definitely visit with her again."
3970736,39389777,2015-07-23,386878,Emon,"Deborah is a really nice host. She spent some of her time with us, showing us the Seattle neighborhoods to us and gave us some good recommendations on where to go. We enjoyed our time in Seattle and living in her place is perfect for my family of 4. She didn't provide parking, but finding a parking space on the street isn't that hard anyway. Thanks for letting us stay in your place."
3970736,41731245,2015-08-09,30131182,Jocelin,The central cozy was my first experience using airbnb. It has been amazing. Deborah was very welcoming the first night. She was helpful and gave great recommendations around Seattle. She definitely gave us the five star stay she promised. We will definitely look to stay at the central cozy again! Thanks Deborah
3970736,42544073,2015-08-14,17357872,Joanna,"Deborah's unit is located in a really nice and quiet area in the suburbs of Seattle, about a 15-20 min walk to the lively Capitol Hill and easily accessible via the #2 bus from downtown. Lots of great places nearby including Katey's and our favourite, Chuck's Hop Shop which were just down the road.

Deborah made our stay very comfortable, her unit is well maintained, very clean, and has everything that you need! We really liked the fruit, yoghurt and bagels upon our arrival.

Large, spacious, quiet and good value for money. Highly recommended. Don't forget to go to the hop shop!"
3970736,43607653,2015-08-21,31037410,Maggie,Deborah made us feel very welcome and comfortable. The apartment was very nice and had everything we needed. It was also located in a prime location where we could walk or take the bus downtown. Would definitely stay here again.
3970736,44120113,2015-08-24,8945747,Loan,"Deborah contacted me before our arrival to let me know that the apartment would be ready earlier than the pre-discussed check in time.  The apartment was very clean, everything we needed was set out and available - including coupons for the coffee shop down the street and bus passes (provided by the previous tenants).  We had bagels, fresh fruit and yogurt waiting for us - which was greatly appreciated after a long morning of traveling.  

The location was perfect!  It was about a 5-10 minute drive to Pike's Market, the ferries/wharf, shopping downtown and the major freeways.  We didn't have any problem finding street parking and Deborah had offered up her driveway for us in case we couldn't find parking.  The apartment was clean, comfortable and plenty of room for my party of 3 adults and 2 toddlers.  We did not cook in the apartment because of all the great local eateries but there is a stove, oven and microwave available along with a full size fridge.  We met Deborah later that evening and not only was she friendly and welcoming but she provided us useful tidbits about the neighborhood.  

We were very happy with our stay.  Deborah was a lovely host, always available if we had any questions or in need of anything.  We would definitely stay here again the next time we come back to Seattle. "
3970736,44913725,2015-08-30,36231518,Bruce,"The picture to the left is indicative of  Deborah 's lovely B&B. It is perfectly setup and it was better then we expected.  We never stayed at a B&B and this experience gave us a positive impression about B&Bs. 

It was a great experience "
3970736,45460112,2015-09-03,24845672,Stacey,"Deborah is a very conscientious host! She provides a lovely apartment, clean and cozy. We have a family of 4 were quite comfortable. Deb provided fresh fruit, tea and coffee on arrival to get us settled. Couldn't say enough nice things about our stay in Seattle. Highly recommend."
3970736,46274829,2015-09-09,35383225,Sivan,"Her apartment is cozy and provided your needs. She greeted us when we arrived and explained all of the house rules, also very organized and keeps a file you can read also. Washer and dryer were perfect, shower was just great! The neighborhood is quite and safe, we had a car but you can easily take bus #2 downtown. There's a tv, full kitchen and I highly recommend staying at her place! She cares about it a lot and it's noticeable :)"
3970736,46876328,2015-09-14,36545548,Kim,"Deborah was very kind and helpful. She gives precise directions from the airport and she also provides many other helpful tips in neatly organized folders. We found fruits, yogurt, bagels, and other extras when we arrived that she graciously provided in the fridge and also got to enjoy her fresh kale, chard, and tomatoes that she had growing in her yard! 
The house was clean and organized perfectly and we enjoyed the comfortable beds. The house was very cozy and central to everything. There is plenty of parking out front at every hour of the day and night, so we were very lucky!
Thank you for being such a gracious hostess Deborah and we hope to be able to come back to Seattle again soon! Glad to be the first guests from Hawaii :) o"
3970736,47972245,2015-09-22,8068619,Valerie,"My husband and I arrived at Central Cozy and found the apartment to be exactly as described and even better than we could have hoped for.  The entire stay at Deborah's was pleasing. We found the keyless entry a true comfort and easy to manage. Never did we have concerns for our safety in her neighborhood.  Location of Cozy is just a few steps from a bus stop. We had never before used public transportation as we are from a very country setting. All was with ease.  Deborah also includes a very well organized description of tips and public transportation information.  We arrived to find some fresh inviting food for our breakfast the following morning.  T I regret I did not re-stock her coffee supply before we left.  And we both wish we would have had more down time to stay enjoy the comforts of Cozy. We would stay with Deborah again and we would classify her and her apartment as ""5 star"""
3970736,48549031,2015-09-27,17171161,Ayesha,"Deborah was an excellent host, she had a welcome sign with our names on it and had breakfast for the next morning waiting for us (which was really helpful since our flight got in so late the night before). She even left oyster cards and coupons to the local coffee shop on the dining table for us when we arrived. The description of the place was accurate. It was clean and everything was clearly labeled, so we knew exactly what to do with everything from garbage and recyclables to the used towels. We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend the location to other people. There was a cute coffee shop and very laid back beer/bar shop within walking distance (and we visited these places at least 3 times each during our 4-day stay)."
3970736,49636084,2015-10-05,19400695,Adrienne,"One of the best Airbnb experiences I've had by far! Deborah was so accommodating, helpful, and friendly and made our stay very personal. Central cozy is in a great location right near Capitol Hill and a close distance from the downtown area as well. The apt was clean, comfortable, and felt very homey. Will definitely try to stay here again the next time I visit Seattle! "
3970736,50208701,2015-10-10,17601013,Darlene,"I stayed in Deborah's lovely suite for two nights. The reason I chose her cozy apartment is that it is so close to Seattle University and my daughters home that she rents with other people.  Deborah made it so easy to check into the apartment and gave exact directions to her home from the airport.  She also had many suggestions for restaurants/ bars in the area. The apartment is just as it is listed...very cozy, and super clean. I absolutely loved how she labeled things and also made it so easy to recycle every item that you use.  My daughter and I shared a glass of wine with Deborah and found her to be a charming hostess. I will definitely stay here again the next time I am in Seattle. and would gladly recommend it to others. "
3970736,51124615,2015-10-18,16022016,Andrea,"Our stay at the Central Cozy apartment was great! The apartment has every amenity you could ask for, a convenient location, and a perfect host. Everything was very comfortable and the kitchen and bath are stocked with all the necessities and then some. The decor was nice and minimal and everything felt very clean. Deborah lives upstairs and is available by phone/text, which was nice to know in case you need anything. The garden behind the house was lovely though we were too busy to enjoy it. There are quite a few local shops nearby, including a grocery store and Trader Joe's, plus it's within walking distance to all the restaurants and shops in Capitol Hill. Overall, this is a perfect, cozy apartment for your trip to Seattle!"
3970736,53291857,2015-11-07,2867171,Gina,"Deborah was a wonderful host.  Her accommodations are exactly as pictured.  It is a very quiet,  safe and cozy apartment in a residential neighborhood.  I was traveling for work with my husband and daughter.  We felt safe in Deborah's home and it was in a great location.  Close to restaurants and cafes.  The apartment has everything you need.  She even provided us with some bagels,  jam,  a wide variety of teas,  and even some coffee with a French press! I especially loved the organic body products! Thank you for your hospitality,  Deborah!"
3970736,54935817,2015-11-25,21748569,Brenna,"My best friend and I had a great stay at Deborah's place. It's a cozy little basement apartment but still has windows and gets a good amount of light. The place was very clean and organized. Deborah provides a detailed welcome binder with all the info you could want or need during your stay. Beds were super comfy (even the fold out couch that my friend slept on), kitchen had everything we could need (pots and pans for cooking, dishware, microwave, coffee and French press, tea bags, creamer, sugar and sugar alternatives, etc) along with some bagels, yogurt and the most delicious raspberry jam I've ever had in my life!! The bathroom impressed me with its separate heating system and made taking a shower on a cold morning a lot more pleasant. Deborah was very friendly and responded to texts quickly. She even kindly reached out and warned us about parking and helped prevent my friends car from being towed after she left it in an illegal spot. Location was in a great area. Felt safe the whole time we were there and had a lot of fun at a nearby karaoke bar (Twilight Exit) one night and was able to walk home without feeling uncomfortable. I would definitely stay here again on a return trip to Seattle. "
3970736,55195566,2015-11-29,18219536,Joshua,"We highly recommend Deborah as a host! She is very welcoming, communicative and thoughtful, and the apartment is comfortable and convenient, tastefully furnished.  We would certainly stay there again.

You will appreciate the clear and helpful  information and the various motion-sensing lights. We had the feeling that Deborah has considered what makes an Airbnb rental experience positive from the renter's perspective.

The bed is very comfortable, and the apartment, being a basement unit, is quiet without a whole lot of natural light (we visited during Thanksgiving, and the windows face north). That suited us well for this visit since we mainly needed a place to crash.

The kitchen is moderately well equipped; usually we cook when we rent with Airbnb, but I don't think we opened a cabinet this visit!  I love a french press coffeemaker, and there's an amazing coffee shop right around the corner, Tougo on 18th.

Speaking of which, the Capital Hill location is wonderful, but of course your mileage may vary. "
3970736,57179320,2015-12-22,7470806,Colette,"Deborah is a lovely person who pays a lot of attention to detail. The apartment is bright (plenty of electric lights) and well equipped. The kitchen has absolutely everything and anything you may need including coffee, teas, butter, jam, beer, soda, fresh fruit and bagels that Deborah sweetly wrapped in a little fabric bag ready to be eaten - a very, very pleasant surprise for an empty stomach. The television has all the main networks and the internet works well too. Deborah is discreet and very quiet so you quickly forget that there's anyone living upstairs. A lovely place and a lovely host!"
3970736,57851725,2015-12-29,13443700,Melissa,"Deborah's apartment is great. Very comfortable, clean, and quiet. It's walking distance to lots of restaurants and bars. Deborah was a lovely host, very responsive and helpful."

3246706,14251317,2014-06-15,6433004,Jessica,"We (my boyfriend Nate and I) truly experienced the two nights we stayed at Lynette's. It was exactly what the posting portrayed and she was very welcoming. Her communication with us was exceptional and easy. The private room was well kept and very clean. The bathroom was stocked with everything you could need, in addition to extra tooth brushes, toothpaste and things you might forget when you're traveling. She was full of local knowledge and was able to guide us to things of our interest. We were greeted in the morning with fresh strawberries from her garden as well. We definitely recommend this place to anyone traveling to the Seattle area. The neighborhood was safe, and definitely accessible to public transit systems to go downtown. Lynette said she just started hosting for airbnb and there aren't many reviews out there yet but I hope this helps for anyone looking to stay with her! "
3246706,14493064,2014-06-20,16193808,Emily,"Lynette is an AMAZING host. Despite her little experience with Airbnb she was perfectly prepared for my friend and I. The neighborhood is very pleasant, quite and super close to a bus station that takes you downtown. Her house is very clean and provides more than enough room for guests. Lynette is a very nice and helpful person and gave us some very good advice as to where to go in the city.

I definitively recommend Lynette to everybody who is looking for a nice stay in Seattle!"
3246706,14715145,2014-06-24,3869249,Sara & Josh,"Lynette was incredibly kind and sweet. The house is in a great location and easy to get to anywhere in Seattle. Overall, the stay was wonderful."
3246706,14798166,2014-06-26,16821572,Gin,"Lynette stayed in her bedroom during our stay.  Prearranged in advance, we came in late the first night after a baseball game; she left the front door unlocked and well lit.  The following night of a two-night stay, Lynette came home late.  Already in bed, I awoke to a strange man knocking at the front door and Lynette entering through the back minutes later.  She invited her boyfriend to stay overnight.  As agreed, we packed and left promptly before 8:00 am.  Honestly I needed a more leisurely start to the morning, especially considering the previous late night.  

The accommodations are beautiful.  If I had paid for a comparable hotel room, the per night charge would be three times what I paid.  The neighborhood is ethnically diverse with a strong African American and Muslim community presence.  The lightrail station is conveniently located about two blocks from the house, and I left an reloadable Orca card with Lynette for future guests to use."
3246706,15275725,2014-07-06,7018482,Jenn,"Lynette was a fantastic host! She was very welcoming, and she even took us hiking outside the city when we first got in! She is out a lot (busy lady!) but when she is in she is a lot of fun to be around. Definite aloha hospitality!

Also, the room was fantastic! Cute little desk and a nice closet for keeping your stuff and the bathroom was very nice and well stocked in case you forgot any essentials. It got a little warm in there while we were visiting, but that's because we visited in July, and it was easily remedied with the little fan in the closet. 

The location was also extremely convenient. It was only a three block walk to the light rail, which runs very frequently into downtown Seattle, and it's about a fifteen minute walk down to the Columbia City hub on Rainier Avenue, which has all sorts of nice shops and great restaurants. All in all, I had a fantastic experience, and would definitely stay with Lynette again if I'm ever back in Seattle!"
3246706,15700732,2014-07-14,1434141,Stephen,"We enjoyed our stay. It was a newer, very nice, incredibly clean house with a comfortable bed. Lynette was a very helpful host. She was flexible in adjusting  our checkout time, which we appreciate. Though it wasn't super relevant to our stay, fans of modern design and architecture might enjoy checking out the cool and unique features of this house."
3246706,15920353,2014-07-18,16722633,Shellie,Very enjoyable stay.  Lynette was friendly host.  House was immaculately clean.  Close to Columbia City and easy walking distance to the light rail for trips to downtown Seattle.  Parking close to house.  Bedroom and bathroom are on a separate floor from rest of house so very private.
3246706,16210457,2014-07-23,155857,Melissa + Joel,The room was clean and very comfortable.  Lynette made us feel very welcome and even picked us up from the airport.  We had fun Seattle and this place was a nice home base for us.
3246706,16856059,2014-08-03,18103948,Claudia,"My friend and I had a great time in Seattle. We went on a whale tour to the Suan Juan Islands as well as many visits to down town Seattle Centre. 

Lynette was very friendly and has a lovely house! It was very clean and the bed is great. She was also very flexible with check in and check out times, as we were leaving when she was not at home. 

The house is located about a seven minute walk from the train, which was great! Very easy and cheap (about 2,65 dollar one way) way to go to down town Seattle Centre. Also the airport is only 4 stops away. 
In the evenings/night time we did not prefer to take the train back as you have to walk to the house when it is dark. We were advised by several people to take a taxi, which was about 14 dollar from Seattle Centre. "
3246706,18618674,2014-08-29,15641394,Anthony,I had  a great time staying with Lynette for a month. She is a great host who always checked in to make sure everything was ok. The place itself is very nice and clean. The highlight for me was the extremely comfortable bed! 
3246706,18798058,2014-09-01,14692316,Kyle,"Convenient, easy, clean, friendly, organized, hassle free.  This was exactly what myself and my friend were looking for.  Located a couple blocks from the train into the city or along a decent cycle route. 

The place was clean and open and I liked the labels that were on all the cupboards!  Lynette is an AirBnB pro.  Would definitely stay again.  Thanks!"
3246706,19100274,2014-09-06,6842400,Christine,"We had a great stay with Lynette! She was a great host and keeps a very clean home. The bed is extremely comfortable and the bedroom is spacious with lots of room for luggage. The bathroom was private and very clean. The train is about a 15 minute walk away and goes to the airport and downtown, and is about $2.50 for a one way ticket. Columbia City is close by and has lots of restaurants and bars. Lynette was also really flexible with us checking out later, which was nice for us. I would stay again."
3246706,20331205,2014-09-28,5406405,Andrew,"Lynette was super welcoming and now a local friend! I was in Seattle looking for a more permanent place and I'd definitely stay here again! I now live in Columbia City so I think the neighborhood is awesome! For travelers, her place is uber convenient to the light rail, and nice vegetarian and Mediterranean grill right nearby. The room itself was super comfortable and I really liked the induction stove in the kitchen. The house is a really cool and worth it to stay here just for that experience.  Great steamer for business travelers and WiFi is fast. On top of that though, Lynette was real nice and invited me out to drinks with her friends at a local bar, great way to meet real Seattlites. Kevin, a housemate, is also real friendlyou and overall great stay at her house. Thanks, Lynette!"
3246706,20747006,2014-10-05,19856952,Beverly,"Lynette was flexible about our arrival time, and was there to greet us when we arrived. Our bedroom and bathroom were spotless. The bed was very comfortable, and the house was quiet. We felt free to come and go as we pleased. We will definitely come back. "
3246706,21525367,2014-10-19,553052,Gillian,"Lynette's place was exactly what I was looking for: clean, comfortable, and welcoming. Although she was away during my stay, we remained in contact throughout. Her housemate greeted me, made sure I settled in okay, and was generally accommodating and pleasant. The house was as described, but came with a lot more facilities than I was expecting; huge washer/dryer, ample space in the pantry with necessities such as tea and coffee, and the bathroom was incredibly well stocked (towels, numerous toiletries etc) for my personal use.
All of the cupboards were helpfully (and very efficiently) labelled and the place was pretty immaculate. The large bed was incredibly comfortable, and a lot more spacious than I was expecting - walk-in wardrobe was an added bonus.
As described, it is conveniently located just around the corner from the Light Rail, which takes you Downtown in about 20 minutes, and there's a nearby parade of shops and restaurants that are a bit of a hidden gem in this city.
Overall, the experience was more than positive, and I would not only recommend but happily stay at Lynette's place again.
"
3246706,22010542,2014-10-27,9360858,Anitra,The reservation was canceled 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3246706,54635920,2015-11-22,35770391,Konstantina,"I stayed with Lynette for 2.5 months while in Seattle for a research visit and it has been great. The house is cosy and clean and the room is  as nice as in the photos. There is also a small walk-in closet, so more than enough storage for a short stay. 
Lynette is fun and we had a really good time and Kevin (her flatmate) is super-relaxed. Lynette's dogs are friendly and very cute.If you are a dog person you are going to love them!
The neighborhood is residential with stores and shops though I didn't go around a lot as I worked downtown (15-20 mins by light rail) .
In general I am more than satisfied with my first Airbnb experience and I would definitely recommend Lynette's place."
3246706,57214017,2015-12-23,9172718,Susan,"Easy walk to light rail station from Lynette's place through this lovely community development, 15 mins to downtown's 4th & Cherry stop. I commuted to work this way during an 11-nite stay and it was convenient, safe, and no issues leaving my car parked at the home all day. Short drive to the cute shops/restaurants off Edmunds, and there are very decent Thai and Mediterranean restaurants within the community as well for convenient takeaway. Both Lynette and Kevin were hospitable friendly hosts, couldn't have asked for an easier trouble-free stay. Very clean space which is so important. This is a great deal, recommend. "
58503,20400886,2014-09-28,21784549,Byron (Barney),"Visala and Dave were lovely hosts!  I had the honor of being their first AirBnB guest.  The space was large, clean, and quiet.  The Greenwood Ave neighborhood fantastic for easy access to shops, bars, restaurants, highways, and transit.  "
58503,20483106,2014-09-29,4358466,Jefferson,"Great place in a great neighborhood.  Visala was warm and welcoming  when we arrived, making sure we knew where everything was and we had everything we needed.  Only stayed overnight, but will be sure to give them a shout next time we head to Seattle."
58503,22653828,2014-11-11,3675075,Andrea,"This was actually an airbnb rental that I did for my son, while he healed from a broken neck.  He needed somewhere safe and quiet for a few weeks, and he certainly got it!  The hosts were gracious and friendly, not intrusive, and good people.  My son says it was a fine place, lots of room,  with a nice whirlpool bathtub."
58503,22748753,2014-11-13,20620459,Jessica,Great place to stay!  Conveniently located by the best gyro place in greenwood!  Host was friendly and thorough. Very clean and tidy. 
58503,22781246,2014-11-14,18974367,Lily,Great house with lots of space! Convenient parking and easy to drive around the city. Very welcoming and easy going. 
58503,23280753,2014-11-27,23875996,Charlie,We had such a nice stay. The space was clean and provided everything we needed. 
58503,23374442,2014-11-30,22689849,Natalie,"We were greeted warmly by Dave and Visala and invited to simply knock on the kitchen door if we needed anything.   We were given verbal tips on any quirks of gate opening, etc. that were not clearly written otherwise.   Maria, the dog, was sweet and welcoming too, and not intrusive. "
58503,23845740,2014-12-12,24128264,Alex,"Visala and Dave were both extremely welcoming, and gracious hosts. They were flexible about my arrival time, and made sure that they were available if I had any questions or concerns. I stayed here for 11 nights, and each night was great! Space is clean and comfortable, and with your own door the place feels very much like your own. I am someone who prefers the quiet space, with few noises and that's what this place was. Only thing I will say is that the ceilings are low for someone my height (6'1""), and there were some places where I had to duck my head. But that is a minor thing. If I need a place to stay, I would absolutely look up Visala and Dave again!"
58503,24464989,2014-12-29,22270939,Walter,"Vi träffade Visala i hennes hus och fick en ""tour""av lägenheten samt en förklaring av hur gör man med Tv´n, tvättmaskin osv. Visala lämnade  kaffe & te för oss, och förstås vi fick handdukar, tvål, shampoo osv; och även en choklad på kudden! 
Man känner sig väldigt välkommen i hennes hus. Hon och hennes man är väldigt lugna, öppna och välkomnande, från första dagen man känner sig hemma, speciellt när man träffar ""Maria"" deras hund. 

Beskrivning av boendet är korrekt, det ser ut precis som på bilderna. Det är lugn och enkelt att sova och lägenheten har egen entré, så det känns ganska privat.

Visala´s hus står mitt i Greenwood, med fantastiska möjligheter för olika restauranger, ""beer gardens"", kaféer, osv. Till centrala Seattle tar det 20 minuter i bussen, och man ta den 50 meter från hennes hus.
För oss det var precis vad vi förväntade.
   "
58503,25520519,2015-01-18,19603212,Katy,We had a wonderful stay.  This is a very fun spot.  The decor was funky and artsy.  It was a clean spot with everything furnished that was needed.  Our kids loved the space.  Dave and Vishala's are approachable but not intrusive.  Loved it.
58503,25612312,2015-01-20,7939666,Cynthia,Thank you for having us! The place was cozy and comfortable! We truly appreciate you accommodating us and hope to come back soon. :) 
58503,25846160,2015-01-27,24712200,William,Extremely welcoming and helpful. Cute little spot in greenwood.
58503,26245116,2015-02-08,11962841,Lindsey,"I had a great stay! The space was very comfortable and exactly as advertised. Lots of extra blankets and pillows also, which is always a plus. I'd definitely stay there again!"
58503,27075042,2015-02-24,10474186,Jose,"Very welcoming, great location, cute dog. Very spacious. Would return again in a heartbeat."
58503,27677687,2015-03-09,28139271,Paul,"Visala's a very sweet lady (with a very sweet dog) who made our first Airbnb experience an enjoyable one. Her room is as pictured: spacious, well-furnished, and with full amenities. 

Definitely consider this place if you're staying in the Seattle area -- especially if you're into Eastern philosophy, meditation, yoga, or just looking for the type of host who would put Hershey's Kisses on your pillows."
58503,27766462,2015-03-11,24589893,Carla,"Visala gave us a warm greeting and showed us the space.  She went over a  detailed document that describes how to use the WiFi, TV remotes etc. and answered all of our questions.  Over all the space is very much as depicted on AirBnB.  The bedrooms are cozy.  The living room area was quite spacious.  The couch next to the TV was comfy and made for an enjoyable evening watching some movies.  We really enjoyed our stay.  We especially enjoyed the jacuzzi bath which is plenty big enough for two to enjoy.

The one thing you should know is that the ceiling is a bit low.  I am 5’ 7” and didn’t have any problem, but someone who was closer to 6 foot might find it a bit tight.   
"
58503,27972235,2015-03-15,28842463,Paul,"We felt very welcome at Visalas and her husbands place, it was great that we could use the upper kitchen. The place is very spacy and very compfortable. They prepared maps and usuals for us, so we could easier help our selfs with verything. The neighborhood is cosy and fast to get there with public transport from citycentre, verything you could use is near. "
58503,28030532,2015-03-16,23825090,Lauren,"The space was just as described in the posting- spacious with a lot of room for a toddler to run around (which for us, was key).  We were greeted by David who gave us an efficient overview of everything.  The provided maps and information about the neighborhood was key in the morning for figuring out where to walk to get a cup of coffee.  Should we return to Seattle, I would definitely try to stay here again."
58503,28231740,2015-03-20,29182998,David,"Very nice home. Calm, peaceful, and the dog Maria is a sweetheart."
58503,28472011,2015-03-24,26844092,Neil,"Nice warm, roomy flat. Comfy beds.
Visala and Dave were two of the friendliest of people. Very attentive without being intrusive. Helpful to a fault.
Just a couple of minutes to bus route 5 right into downtown Seattle. About a 30 minute run (Quicker on the express). Some pleasant walks around Green Lake and surrounding area.
I would recommend a stay in Visala and Dave's flat if ever you are visiting Seattle."
58503,28712224,2015-03-29,27544117,Robin,This location was awesome. Very quiet and private. Everything you need is in a very short walking distance. The host is very accommodating. She left us coupons which I thought was very sweet.Highly recommended!
58503,29128741,2015-04-04,3188802,Kaitlin,"My experience with Visala, Dave and Maria was fantastic! Didn't get the chance to meet either of them, but the basement was perfect for myself and my two friends. Awesome decor and books. I especially dug the bathtub art, really cool. The neighborhood was beautiful! Very short distance to downtown, Capitol Hill, etc. Would love to stay here again!!"
58503,29572063,2015-04-09,18898003,Lee,Very friendly host. Very flexible space that was perfect for our larger group (5). Great location also. Would recommend!
58503,29840429,2015-04-13,28759213,Amy,"This was a comfortable stay. Visala was very responsive through email and always instantly returned communication. Beautiful home with lots of quirks that made it fun. Filtered water, detailed instructions of the area, a yummy chocolate bar and the lights left on for us at night made us feel welcome. Thankfully we are staying there on our way back home. It feels like staying at a friend's house without even meeting the hosts in person. Also super sweet puppy :) "
58503,30034701,2015-04-16,6802100,Liz,"Communication was good and prompt!  Description was accurate, clean, comfortable, roomy, and homey: perfect for our needs.  We were familiar with the area and  enjoyed being in that neighborhood as a launching point.  The garden is a whimsical retreat and offered a lovely transition between outings.  Thanks for allowing us our privacy and quiet times were perfect.  It was spacious, and we were glad that neither of us was over 6 feet tall :)  The Buddhist temple tucked into the neighborhood was lovely.  Thanks for the Theo's chocolate... that joined us on our hike to PooPoo Point!"
58503,30206881,2015-04-19,28773471,Nathan,We had a great time. Visala was very pleasant. We will stay again. 
58503,30352888,2015-04-20,31085012,Ryan,"Nice quiet neighborhood. Good communication, quick responses. Excellent accommodations, as described. Neat and clean. Organized and thoughtfully arranged. We had a great experience!"
58503,30484303,2015-04-22,29632819,Nike,"Visala and Dave were superb hosts, warm, gentle and caring. Incredible people; so wonderful to meet them and get to know them a little. Very considerate. 

The spacious private daylight basement was as described. The jetted tub was more than I had hoped for.  In all the space is delightful,whimsical, peaceful and akin to a retreat.

The neighbourhood is great. Tons of restaurants and grocery stores.  Parking was easy and right outside the house. Thank you."
58503,30698841,2015-04-26,7136801,Kate,"What a find! This is a really special place, with such a warmth and convenience. The hosts were so welcoming, and Maria the laborador was the best part! I'd highly recommend this spot."
58503,30987736,2015-04-30,3150988,Christopher,"Host was very welcoming and provided lots of nice touches (labelled remote controls, a welcome chocolate, etc), listing actually kind of understated just how huge the space was."
58503,31321611,2015-05-04,22186788,Sushant,"Visala's place is located in a very nice neighbourhood of Seattle. Her house is surrounded by a nice garden and there are many fantastic eateries in the vicinity.The apartment itself is very cosy and even though it is in the basement, it is well lit. The coffee and the chocolate bar were delicious.
Visala is very kind and generous and gave us some useful tips on places to eat at. 

Maria (their labrador) is a gentle soul.If you are a dog person, you could take her for a walk around the block, she likes that and we loved playing with her. Thanks for a great stay, Visala! I would highly recommend this place to everyone looking for a comfortable 'home away from home'."
58503,31560103,2015-05-06,32420150,Brad,"The location is super nice. Lots of places to eat in the immediate vicinity, nice neighborhood, and easy access to downtown and northern Seattle locations.

This is a basement, so it's probably not for everyone, but we enjoyed the comfy home feeling. It was kind of stressful trip for us to Seattle, so it was really nice to come 'home' at the end of the day and feel comfortable just lounging about.

Your hosts here are extremely pleasant folks. The space provides many amenities we did not take advantage of: laundry, big tv, coffee, etc. We brought games to play, so we mostly took advantage of the round table that is perfect for game play.

Thanks,
Brad
"
58503,31696334,2015-05-09,27479235,Gee,Great place! We had a great time in Seattle. Maria was such a cute dog to play with. Hosts were very nice. Overall very pleasant stay. Thanks Visala!
58503,31991694,2015-05-12,31691869,Marie,"Directions to the house were clear.  It was nice to know we could park on the street.  It was easy to get in, the note on the door assured us we were in the right place.  The daylight basement is spacious, inviting, and has good energy.  We all felt very comfortable there, wifi connected easily.  This was a reunion with my three adult kids and one boyfriend.  We loved the neighborhood, walked down to the Ale House and had dinner out on the sidewalk.  The weather was warm and lots of people were out.  It was a great night.  "
58503,32681297,2015-05-20,6188238,Vibhavaree,"I rented Visala's place for a music festival, and I needed a spot for the artists to stay. I did not stay there myself, so I really appreciated that Visala and her family helped make the artists feel comfortable and at home. 
Her place worked so well for the artists - spacious, yet having enough private space, close to fun shops, and Visala and her family were so warm and accommodating that the artists felt very welcome and comfortable. 
So very grateful!!"
58503,33434217,2015-05-28,29339005,Hope,"It was wonderful staying in Visala's house, charming and relaxed atmosphere- really felt at home and was made to feel so welcome! The basement rooms were comfortable and spacious with the facilities I needed, especially laundry, wifi and microwave.  The location in the heart of the Greenwood high street with interesting shops and cafes was perfect.  I would definitely stay there again when visiting Seattle."
58503,33780266,2015-06-01,26364717,Mark,"We hebben Visala zelf niet gezien, maar er lag lekkere chocola voor ons klaar.  Haar zoon hebben we gezien toen we uitcheckten en hij was gastvrij. Je zit zo op de snelweg,  maar in de buurt merk je dat helemaal niet! we hebben een leuke wandeling gemaakt naar het meer in de buurt.
De kelder is een heerlijk grote ruimte. Erg fijn is dat de slaapkamer en de woonkamer twee aparte ruimtes zijn. Onze dochter kon zo lekker slapen terwijl wij nog in de woonkamer konden zitten. Onze eenjarige dochter vond de versieringen van het bad helemaal geweldig! Ze bleef maar aanwijzen en zeggen wat er op geplakt was! Erg leuk!
"
58503,34242784,2015-06-06,14324922,Kelly,"It was exactly like the pictures.  It was great, and the hosts were very welcoming.  If I had an occasion to be in Seattle in the future, I would love to stay there again.  There is a lot of space to spread out, and it's kind of like having an apartment.  Thank you Visala!"
58503,34852570,2015-06-13,29795996,Ben,Visala is an amazing host and her home is located in a really fun part of Seattle. She did everything in her power to make our stay a comfortable one and her home is even nicer in person than in the pictures. My partner and I had an amazing time and will definitely stay there again when we return.
58503,35456246,2015-06-19,2396365,Bill,"Visala's place was perfectly comfortable and spacious for our family of four. Greenwood is such a cool neighborhood, and what a sweet dog Maria is! We would happily hang out here again when we're in Seattle."
58503,35655709,2015-06-21,29295071,Brian,This two-bedroom basement apartment was perfect for the three of us during our two-night stay in Seattle. It is very close to the bus line and we were downtown within 30 minutes. Close to everything you need! And dog Maria was very sweet. Host Visala was kind and showed us everything we needed to know. Be sure to check out the garden - a wonderful quiet morning spot.
58503,35790008,2015-06-22,23348090,Angie,Linda and Jim were great hosts and very nice to chat with. They also gave us a lot of tips about the area. The rooms were clean and tidy. :-)
58503,36371053,2015-06-28,29642270,Rick,"Visala and Dave were great hosts.  Very welcoming. Place is in a very nice part of town, with great access to shops and restaurants. We happened to stay on the weekend of the Grenwood car show...super cool.  Great stay."
58503,36537061,2015-06-29,32784812,Amy,We really enjoyed our visit! The perfect affordable place for a family to stay close to Seattle.
58503,37289362,2015-07-06,5084534,Daniel,"This was a great place to stay in Seattle! The apartment is just as it appears on the profile--very spacious, with a clear flavor of the hosts' personalities. The dog is friendly, and the backyard is beautiful. The neighborhood is also really great--beautiful views overlooking Puget Sound, and lots of appealing restaurants, bookstores, and coffeeshops.

We did not get to meet Visala or Dave, but their sons helped make us feel welcome. They also left a nice welcome gift! 

Because this is a basement apartment, it was quite cool even though Seattle was experiencing a heatwave. One downside of the basement location, though, is the low ceilings. People taller than six feet should think twice about it--at exactly six feet, I hit my head hard twice before I learned to duck. But there are several beams that I only just cleared, which means that a taller person would really need to be stooping almost all the time. 

Apart from that, a great place to stay."
58503,38316827,2015-07-14,34412311,Roberto,The place was nice and clean. I could not have a single complaint about it or the location. The place is only a 15 minute drive from downtown. Visala was a great host. Any and every question we had was answered. Every amenity we needed was provided. And of course Maria was the nicest dog I have ever seen. I would definitely stay here again.
58503,38509066,2015-07-16,34576502,Peter,"Visala and Dave made us feel very welcome. The basement apartment was spacious, comcortable and perfect for our group of 5 adults. We had car grouble on the last day and tbey were both really helpful. Our grateful thanks to both of you."
58503,38584679,2015-07-17,14882809,Lance,Visala was very nice. The place is very informal  and homey. Just watch your head due to low beams!
58503,38745731,2015-07-18,34108013,Angie,We enjoyed our visit. Great neighborhood! Cool house. Very eclectic. Loved all the books. Walked down the street to eat breakfast and enjoyed seeing the Buddhist temple. 
58503,38980389,2015-07-20,9889476,Anna,"Me and my two friends had a wonderful time at the lovely basement. It's very spacious and while it was super hot outside, the basement was really cool. Visala and Dave (and their son) were really nice people and their dog Maria is amazing. Neighbourhood has some nice breakfast places like Pete's Eggnest! Would definitely come back here if we would ever visit Seattle again. "
58503,39372489,2015-07-23,26132639,Jordanna,We really enjoyed Visala's basement. Parking was easy on the street and the house is located in a really groovy neighborhood. The basement is very spacious and has all you need. For me the bath tub was a luxury I had been yearning for in a string of stall showers at other airbnb's. We were a small family of three but I bet 7 people could fit comfortably in this space. Visala was a doll. I wouldn't hesitate to boom again. 
58503,39613443,2015-07-25,31978795,Ross,Very welcoming cool house just outside of the city. Plenty of space! Thank you!
58503,40203782,2015-07-29,25863817,Jeb,"Nice suite in a beautiful neighbourhood. The suite was clean, just as advertised and we enjoyed our stay there. Close to bus routes. "
58503,45235005,2015-09-01,10336768,Matt,"Visala and Dave were excellent hosts!!! We stayed there for a month too:) The space is large, comfortable, and private. And the neighborhood is delightful with bus stops (30 minutes to downtown), shops, restaurants, and supermarkets are all within walking distance. Visala and Dave left directions for the neighborhood, well stocked supplies, and Seattle information as well and were so incredibly easy to communicate with. 

We would stay there again if we needed a Seattle rental. If you are considering some time in Seattle, push this listing to the top of your list. "
58503,46581546,2015-09-12,34771375,Dorrie,"Felt very much at home, lots of space. Had everything we needed. Comfy. Thanks for everything. Very friendly helpful people. 
Was so wonderful that we could have our so join us there. "
58503,47505230,2015-09-19,42320437,Raina,"This basement made me feel like I was in a cabin in the mountains, and with the smell of rain it felt like a true Seattle visit. So much personality throughout the unit while still having every amenity we could imagine and more! Their clear instructions made the unit and the neighborhood feel like home in no time. "
58503,47734615,2015-09-21,23074156,Leo,Great relaxing location! Hosts are friendly and outgoing. Spoke briefly when I was leaving.
58503,47974930,2015-09-22,39252855,Liana,Everything looks just as pictured. Hosts left detailed instructions for us and the place was very comfy and cozy. We had a ton of room to spread out and the place came well-stocked with the essentials. Check-in was smooth and easy.
58503,48070094,2015-09-23,23349388,Autumn,Great location and great space with everything we needed. Dog was super sweet but didn't really get to meet our hosts. 
58503,48354889,2015-09-25,44439337,Todd,"The thing I liked most about this place was that, everywhere I turned, I was finding some neat/charming memento or souvenir from Visala and her family. It made it seem very homey and un-basement-like. It was a lot of fun to just walk around and look at everything. The only qualm I had was that, at 6-feet-tall, I often had to dip down to avoid bumping my head on the beams and door frames. (I failed a couple of times.) Otherwise, great place. It's located just two blocks from the 5 bus, which travels to and from downtown every 15 minutes roughly 20 hours a day. The neighborhood is fun. The streets are very cramped with cars parked on both sides, but we didn't have any trouble finding a spot right outside the house."
58503,48556842,2015-09-27,42229470,Bethany,This was a great space in a fantastic location! The basement was as advertised- very spacious! Visala was a lovely person and I only wished I could have spent more time talking with her. The house is in a great part of the city and within walking distance of a lot of great eating places and fun neighborhoods. It's a great deal and I would love to stay here again! 
58503,48777766,2015-09-28,43820238,Melissa,"Visala and Dave have a very pleasant place. There were clear instructions on what was expected and they made it very convenient and easy. It was also very peaceful and comfortable. Even though it was just a one night stay, my husband and i were pleased with our experience."
58503,49037826,2015-09-30,43472298,Shao,"This is a nice place. Really love it with convenient parking & everything. 
Dave is so nice welcoming us at the main gate although we are 30 min.earlier than expected. Greenwood area is so big & with good environment. I like greenwood and ran in the morning breathing fresh air is cool."
58503,49600653,2015-10-05,35432839,Raymond And Joyce,"Dave met us at the door and was a great help with the questions we bombarded him with after our very long and exhausting drive, turns out all the info we needed was located inside on the table !!  :-) 
The space is nice and cozy but anyone over 6'4"" may have some issues with the ceiling and beam heights.  The beds are very comfortable and the lounge area is very nice with a great range of channels to watch after a long day of exploring.  
The room is semi personalised with some family and friend photos in and around the space, there was also a funny smell close to the stairwell/basement entrance door, we got used to it but it was quite strong and hard to work out if what may have caused it.
The bnb is very conveniently located to a huge supermarket and many great take out and restaurant places.  Public transport to the city was a bit of an effort and after a pile of walking (and some running) to catch busses on our first day we found it very easy to drive into the city via Aurora Ave on the second day and thus avoiding the craziness of the Interstate."
58503,49961321,2015-10-07,45774983,Bulent,"We had an excellent stay here. Even though we didn't get a chance to meet Visala, everything was well organizex enough to make the stay easy and comfortable. "
58503,50652616,2015-10-13,41078362,Richard,"We had an amazing stay in Seattle and much of that was due to having such a great place to stay while we were there. Dave and Visala's place was so comfortable and easy to make ourselves home out. Easy access to the bus lines so we could accomplish our goal of exploring the city. But when we wanted to rest our feet and just relax, Visala's basement was the perfect place to do it. She wasn't around for the weekend, but her husband Dave was always responsive to our texts when we were looking for info. Also want to give mention to her son Gus and the awesome high-end, second hand men's clothing store he runs out of the upstairs. Great guy and and great clothes. I bought a couple jackets at an awesome price that I'm stoked on. Neighborhood of Greenwood is awesome too! We come from Utah, which is a beautiful state, but admittedly overrun with national chains and shopping/food establishments that lack true character a quality. We spent a day and a night exploring the neighborhood and loved every shop we stopped (website hidden) scene was fun, food was great. Lastly, can't finish this without mentioning the best food I've experienced in while, and it's just down the road from Visala's. The ""In-Season Fresh Take-Away & Cafe"" was astounding. The chef there is truly a master of his craft and artfully considers every component of his menu items. If you don't stop in to experience his food and staff, you will be missing out.
Thanks Visala and Dave! When we head up your direction again, we'd definitely love to stay at your place again. You made our first experience with Air B&B a great and memorable one! We are converted "
58503,51440550,2015-10-20,42041782,Dan,"A nice place to stay in, Spacious and clean.
A very pleasant suburban area, not too far from the city center.
I've only met Visala and Dave briefly, but they were very nice and welcoming. Overall, it was good value for the money."
58503,51682961,2015-10-22,4659012,Kelly,"We never met Visala, but the entry into this basement space was easy, and location was very convenient. It was definitely spacious, and we loved the color scheme. 
It is not a completely finished basement however, mostly in that the ceiling/upstairs floor lacks any sound proofing. We did come on a week day, and understandably, Visala and her husband got up early to get to work... but it was very noisy.  We appreciated the dishes and whatnot, but there is no kitchen or sink, so this would not be a place to stay long term.
All in all tho, this was a cute space in a great part of Seattle, and Visala was a very accommodating host."
58503,51855737,2015-10-24,28284877,Bridget,"Terrific location and spacious place to stay.  The hosts were great - had all kinds of amenities like filtered drinking water, small refrigerator, dishes, etc.  And thanks so much to Dave and his son for helping me figure out how to get the Seahawks game up and running!"
58503,52194430,2015-10-26,1097353,Rachel,"What a great, funky space! It's bright and fun, and totally private. Well outfitted with conveniences like a mini-fridge, coffee maker, washer and dryer, etc. It's huge, and could easily accommodate a small family or some friends traveling together, too. Visala has a great energy about her, and made me feel comfortable at once. Bonus: their dog is adorable. Enjoy!"
58503,52303205,2015-10-27,44207173,Lauren,It was a wonderful little basement with a nice tub. And a very comfy bed!
58503,52684324,2015-11-01,20130075,Linda,Beds were very comfortable and it was very roomy.  Had some issues getting to the entry at night so bring a flashlight.
58503,53544456,2015-11-09,216370,Lacey,"Comfy and cozy stay. The weather was awful but there are plenty of places to eat nearby and when we got to Visala's basement apt, there was extra blankets and our favorite game of thrones to catch up on. The jacuzzi tub was awesome. If we come back to Seattle and need a place, we'll surly look up this spot again. Thank you visala!!"
58503,53664377,2015-11-10,18994232,Erin,"Great AirBnB.
It was easy to find with great instructions. We were able to get into the place easily and had everything we needed.  Thanks Visala.
We walked down to the local pub to watch the Sounders.. Loved the neighborhood and the experience. I definitely recommend this stay."
58503,53859244,2015-11-13,22317932,Megan,Everything was great! Highly recommended.
58503,54703064,2015-11-23,43027692,Lynette,We had a wonderful 1st Airbnb experience. The location was great for us. A very short drive to my daughters. The place was clean comfy and cozy with great coffee;) They had great hot water and with it being a little chilly out that was awesome to come back too.  They really had everything you need. I was so happy they had a hairdryer available since I had left mine at home.  The spacer heater in the bed room is a great idea just to get the room a little warmer before you sleep. We never had to have it on for long. Just a great plus. Dave and Visala were very nice. We would definitely go back. Thank so much! 
8774504,55310917,2015-11-29,28431830,Kelly,Natalie's place was perfect.  Warm and cozy and bright. Half a block from great strip of ale houses and shops.  Columbia City is a great neighborhood.  She left out bagels and coffee and lots more.  Thanks Natalie for making our seattle stay so great.  
8774504,56975598,2015-12-20,42131588,Vonnie,I think this is a pretty good house. You can find everything you want . We are very happy in this house. And it is a safety place. It is a good choice to live in this house.
8774504,57407352,2015-12-25,50786493,Joanne,"Natalie's place is lovely and as did robed in her posting.  Natalie and her daughter were very warm and welcoming!  Thank you, Natalie"
8774504,57919008,2015-12-30,28288810,Nathan,Perfect location in wonderful Seattle!  Just 10 min. walk from the light rail that gets you downtown or to the airport and only 2 blocks from some wonderful bars/restaurants.  We couldn't have asked for more!  The house had everything we could have needed for a long weekend in Seattle and even had a space heater the basement!  Would stay here again!
4360485,27213235,2015-02-28,24740172,Amanda,"Noel is a dream of a host! She's respectful, giving, helpful and basically a superwoman. She makes you feel welcomed in her house and goes out of her way to make you feel it! Her house is an amazing location for anyone wanting to travel to ballard & fremont easily, or even downtown. I stayed with Noel for just under 2 months so I highly recommend staying with her! "
4360485,28418401,2015-03-23,24740172,Amanda,"We needed to extend our stay even longer and Noel was more than accommodating. She was so sweet & offered to help us in anyway she could while we waited for our new apartment to become available. The longer you stay in greenwood and with Noel, the more you fall in love! :) "
4360485,28867192,2015-03-31,26081521,Nathan,"A warm and welcoming atmosphere from host, cats, and house was found by us after a long day of travelling at our first ever air bnb. 
The house was conveniently located near many buses, which made getting downtown (and back!) really simple.  The room has enough storage for two, more than enough for our short stay.
We enjoyed waking each day to a pot of coffee ready for us, chatting with Noel, and playing with the cats. Having left our own cat to go on holiday it was lovely to get in some feline time. 
As helpful as she is charismatic, Noel is an amazing host!"
4360485,29362348,2015-04-06,30376273,Emmy,"From the start, Noel welcomed myself, my husband, and our two kitties with warmth and care. We were using Noel's bed and breakfast as a place to stay, in between moving from one home to the next. First of all, it was a very last minute reservation, as I requested her place within our budget the night that we needed to start our 6 day stay. She responded in 10 minutes, whilst her busy schedule, and called me right after the reservation was made to say hi and make sure we understood the airbnb process, as it was my first time using airbnb. We initially planned to arrive at 9pm but our moving plans pushed on until 12:30am. The entire time Noel was sweet via texts, encouraging us that there was no need to rush and that she would be patiently waiting on the couch relaxing with her kitties until our arrival. We showed up to her beautiful, cozy home late at night. The Greenwood neighborhood was quiet, quaint, well lit, and peaceful. The house was warm and so was Noel's kindness. We made our way to our room and our comfy queen size bed. The cats stayed with us that evening in our room. I remember the first morning of our stay the best. I was refreshed and happy to feel the suns' warmth coming in from the window. There was a sweet, warm breeze coming in from outside, and my kitties were soaking in the relaxing atmosphere with me. I was amazed how quiet it was! I could hear birds chirping and it didn't feel like I was in the city, while staying at Noel's place, through the entire stay! Overall, the stay was everything we could have hoped for and more, especially after all the drama and hard work that accompanies any move! My husband and I enjoyed cuddling up on her big couch to our favorite reality tv shows! Haha. We even woke up one morning still on the couch that we had accidentally fallen asleep on. It was so comfy! I especially adored Noel's personality and humor! She is such a relaxing person to be around. It's no effort to just be yourself when you're in her home and around her. She makes it easy to be yourself and feel like her home is your home too! Surprisingly, by day three, all four cats were sharing the home together, with no issues! Her cats are so sweet and funny! Closing up this long winded, but much deserved review, I was extremely appreciative of her oven. I sell brownies on the weekends at my brownie shop in Georgetown, and being able to bake here was so convenient! Thanks again Noel! We will be back! :-D

P.S. Niko and Pumpkin say ""Meow"" and miss your place already! "
4360485,31189628,2015-05-03,3160134,Alyssa,"Noel was a great host! She stayed up late to greet us the first night we arrived, had detailed instructions and keys waiting for us, and was always available for questions when we had them. She was very accommodating and let us use her kitchen, breakfast nook, and sofa all the time. We felt very comfortable the entire time we stayed with her!  Her home is cozy and comfortable, and is in a neighborhood that my husband and I liked so much we actually decided to move there (our trip was to find housing for an upcoming relocation to Seattle). It's walkable, safe, quirky, and has great cafes and nearby grocery stores. Very convenient.  "
4360485,31754390,2015-05-09,31603333,Eric,"Noel was an amazing host! My friend and I had to schedule a stay with her at the last minute and she was very kind about it. The listing was very accurate and the neighborhood was perfect for visiting the area: a grocery store within walking distance, nice places to eat, and tons of bars to choose from, not to mention a laid back host who is open to just sitting out by the fire with a few beers. I would definitely stay with Noel again then next time I'm in Seattle!"
4360485,37588272,2015-07-08,35554947,Alexandria,We had a great time and felt very welcome and comfortable in Noel's home. Her home was nice and also centrally located for our visit to Seattle. I recommend her home highly through airbnb : )
4360485,39427631,2015-07-23,3355005,Erica,We had a great stay with Noel. She was really friendly and the room was comfortable and clean. The neighborhood was nice and her cats are the best. Would highly recommend. 
4360485,40973509,2015-08-03,12926131,Amber,"Very nice, quiet neighborhood.  Cute house and comfortable accommodations.  If you love kitties, this is the place to stay! She has 2 very friendly cats. I never got the chance to meet Noel during my stay because she was out of town, but she made sure that everything was ready for my arrival and was completely thorough and quick to respond the entirety of my stay. I would definitely stay again and highly recommend you do too! Thanks for everything Noel! :)"
4360485,49724765,2015-10-05,18355702,Pablo,Magnificent stay. One of the main reasons why my trip to Seattle was unbelievable. =)
4360485,50690305,2015-10-13,5200717,James,"Noel was absolutely a wonderful host! After several less than stellar experiences with other AirBNB places, it was a breath of fresh air to stay with a host who is professional and really works to make her guests feel at home.

The entire house was spotless and her friendly cats made us feel very welcomed! All usual amenities are well-stocked we had everything we needed including a nifty directory next to our bed with list of everything you might need or question answered. 

If you ever plan to run a succesful AIRBNB, stay with Noel and you'll get a textbook lesson on being an awesome host!  "
4360485,51098706,2015-10-17,46556209,Montana,"Very homey atmosphere and it was fun experiencing feeling like roommates for a few days. Central neighborhood with food, groceries and bars within walking distance. Staying with Noel made for an enjoyable few days in Seattle. "
4360485,52923199,2015-11-02,34537930,Lauren,"Noel was an amazing host! I even extended my stay because I felt so comfortable and welcome. Her home was clean, organized, and inviting. "
4360485,53161428,2015-11-05,34537930,Lauren,"My experience was phenomenal mostly thanks to Noel. She was kind, gracious, friendly, and thoughtful. Noel even tried to help me find an apartment when I told her I had just moved to Seattle. Her home was extremely clean and inviting."
4360485,54243528,2015-11-17,338989,Carmen,"Noel made us feel very welcome, and was pleasant to get to know. Her home is clean, the bed is comfortable, and bathroom is close and clean. We enjoyed our 5 day stay in Seattle."
4360485,55475793,2015-12-01,31856515,Kathy,"Our friendly host greeted us upon arrival and  covered use of the community spaces and introduced us to her two wonderful cats.  Our room had a very comfortable bed.  It was small but very clean and met our needs.  We were invited to use the common spaces and enjoyed all the sunlight that entered the home.  The location was close to shopping and restaurants and was very walkable.  We felt very comfortable in the neighborhood and appreciated the ease of parking. 
I can easily see staying here again. "
8194286,48774121,2015-09-28,4233333,Linda,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Home was very clean and neighborhood quiet and cozy.  We recommend it and will use  it again if it's available when our travel plans include Seattle.
444221,1593899,2012-06-30,2024440,Bradley,It was great dealing with Monika - she was very flexible and a great host - we hope to be able to work with her again with future employee stays in Seattle!
444221,1642480,2012-07-06,2537062,Stephen,"I had a fantastic experience in the Cherry Hill House! Monika was a very polite and thoughtful hostess, and she kept me posted with all sorts of useful information for my stay. Everything was very neat and clean, the appliances were working, and I loved the artistic touches throughout the house. All in all a great place to stay, highly recommended!"
444221,1658810,2012-07-08,2699584,Sally,"Didn't meet Monika, but was very happy staying at Cherry Hill. It is well positioned - i really loved Seattle! - and everything was good. 
I wish i had been able to stay longer...who knows, maybe on the way home?"
444221,1755996,2012-07-20,436040,Anastasia,"I needed a place to stay in Seattle - cheap, close to downtown and Capitol Hill, and safe. Monika's place was all that. Great communication, great location, and very nice neighbors. I would stay with Monika again. Thank you!"
444221,1773230,2012-07-22,2408877,Joe,"Monika's place is quiet, convenient, and comfortable. I enjoyed my stay."
444221,2099457,2012-08-26,2415363,Hope,"Monika is a great, responsive host.  Place is in a convenient location off street, so no traffic noise and very clean.  Other guests were friendly and quiet; making the experience even better."
444221,2243244,2012-09-09,2999267,Andre,"Great house and a great host. The location is pretty good especially for the price.

One thing to note is the house has cats, I'm allergic so normally that's a problem for me but the cats don't seem to spend much time indoors so I didn't have any problems."
444221,2287914,2012-09-14,3418161,Carolina,"Monika is really nice, the kitties are adorable. The room was clean and spacious."
444221,2312763,2012-09-17,3057707,Susie,"We loved our stay in this artsy house in a charming neighborhood.  Monica and her roommate were super flexible about check-in time.  The room was small but tidy and comfortable.  It's close to the kitchen that's used by the rest of the house, so if you're a sensitive sleeper and want to sleep late, you may want to use earplugs.  Also, there's 1 bathroom (with toilet, shower, and laundry) in the 3 bedroom house, so this is not the place for long luxurious showers if you're into that thing.
Monica provided us with a great manual with guidelines for the house, directions from the airport, and other useful information that made everything really easy.  She's also got bikes for rent, which we were really excited about, but unfortunately, the bike lock key had been lost so we were unable to use them.  Other than that, everything was great!  And you cannot beat that price!  I'd definitely stay here again!   "
444221,2314868,2012-09-17,3382652,Lane,"Monika was great, the room was great, the bed was great, the vibe was great, the bus ride into town was full of insane people and students and professionals alike. I enjoyed coming and going from the house, it made this stay in Seattle a very happy memory! thanks Monika."
444221,2944182,2012-11-22,4060976,Jess,"Monika did a wonderful job of working with me when I was trying to book this at the last minute...she was friendly, detailed and flexible! It is a great room with a desk, very clean kitchen, clean bathroom with cool clawfoot tub/shower, and nice people! It was like a small, tidy youth hostel.  I would second the earlier review that if you're a light-sleeper to bring ear plugs - sound travels easily through walls, but everyone was respectful of quiet hours so I didn't have any issues in this area. I will definitely stay here again!"
444221,3112401,2012-12-18,1241900,Daniel,Everyone was really friendly and welcoming. The walls have cool art on them. The cat was fuzzy and nice. The bathtub was really cool. Having a nice kitchen next to the room was super convenient. Within walking distance of lots of cool stuff. Good stay!
444221,3176890,2012-12-29,1196648,Melaine,Very well located. You can take the bus downtown or even walk if you feel like it! The house was cozy and clean. Monika was friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend this place! 
444221,3314913,2013-01-09,4015292,Peter,"My trip to Seattle was incredibly busy, and I didn't really get to meet Monika or Erin, but the room was excellent, and the house was really welcoming. The guide provided to get to the house, and the info provided was thorough and very useful.  I enjoyed my stay immensely, and would really recommend the Cherry Hill House!!"
444221,3324951,2013-01-10,4149217,Neil,The accommodations were exactly as advertised! Monika was fantastic with getting back to me and answering my inquiries. I wouldn't hesitate for a moment to send guests her way. =)
444221,3379103,2013-01-20,973583,Tristan,"My trip kept me pretty busy, so I didn't get a chance to chat much with Erinn or Monika, but the room and house were tidy, quiet, and comfortable; the cat was very sweet, and check-in and check-out logistics were prompt and smooth (helped out by the very helpfully detailed instructions for each). I would stay here again, and recommend it to others."
444221,3422775,2013-01-27,4204147,James,"The room and house were great. Everyone there was nice and helpful. Its location is superb. For example, it's a few blocks away from Ezell's, which cooks Oprah's favorite fried chicken. Supposedly she has it sent to her in Chicago, it's that good. Besides the proximity to this institution, the house itself is great- a truly welcoming abode."
444221,3512445,2013-02-11,4106888,Katey,"Everyone at the Cherry Hill house was wonderful and friendly and fantastic. The room itself was clean and cute, and the shared areas of the house had great vibes. It's in an excellent, laid back neighborhood, walkable, awesome takeout everywhere, lots of big sprawling gardens, etc etc. We were sad to leave and would recommend a stay for anyone taking a peek at this listing."
444221,3549989,2013-02-15,5055004,Richard,"
All coordinating factors were a breeze.
The room was cozy.
All around a welcoming, sweet experience!"
444221,3586022,2013-02-19,4920973,Kristiana,The room was great and the roomies were nice! Thanks for providing a comfortable stay!
444221,3603199,2013-02-22,4274504,David,"Nice location, good bus access to downtown. Friendly people around and a quiet place for some sleep."
444221,3729904,2013-03-09,4274504,David,"Great again, nice location, quiet and easy bus access. Thanks!"
444221,3742878,2013-03-10,5365033,Charity,"This was my first time using Airbnb, finding the Cherry Hill house was easy, the room was great, the people were awesome, and the cat was sweet and friendly! "
444221,3797298,2013-03-16,2045410,Tesla,"As always, the house in Cherry Hill was a wonderful place to lay our heads during our vacation. It's a no brainer for my friend and I to stay at Monika's - everyone we encounter at the house is friendly, accommodating and helpful, the house is clean and well equipped, and it's close to everywhere we want to go. I will definitely be returning!"
444221,4608336,2013-05-15,3686334,Miranda,"I stayed at Cherry Hill House for 2 months for an internship downtown and could not have asked for a better experience! The room was perfect for studying and having some privacy, but it was great to live in a furnished house and still meet other people while in town! Erinn and Monika were both great hosts- always responding quickly to questions and keeping the place tidy. 

Everyone that came and went during my time there were all very respectful of the house rules and keeping things quiet during the late p.m. and early a.m. hours.  I never ran into a problem with using the bathroom even with a number of people living there, and I had plenty of room to store my groceries in the kitchen.

I would definitely recommend this for an extended or brief stay as a student if you want to be within busing/walking distance to downtown, but want to "
444221,4923705,2013-06-02,5280526,Rieke,It's a great place with fun people and a relaxed atmosphere. Although a lot of people are living there everything is very well organized. I did not meet Monika but her housemates arranged everything. The bed was comfy and there is a lot space to store your stuff.  
444221,6145423,2013-08-01,5400302,Bernd,"Ich hielt mich für 2 Monate dort auf. Insgesamt hat es mir gut gefallen. Atmosphäre und Lebensart des Hauses ist locker und angenehm. Das Zimmer hat die für mich erforderliche Privatheit und Rückzugsmöglichkeit. Es herrscht ein ziemliches großes Kommen und Gehen von Gästen, die meist freundlich und kommunikativ sind. Einziger Wermutstropfen: die Sauberkeit im Haus! Küche und Bad für mich kaum benutzbar, weil verschmutzt und z.T. für  meine Begriffe hygienischen Standards nicht entspricht. Eigene Versuche, dem ab zu helfen (vor allem im Bad!), wurde durch einen Teil der Gäste umgehend wieder verschmutzt, Gastgeberin Erinn kam mit dem Putzen leider nicht nach. Funktionierende Gerätschaften wie Staubsauger nicht vorhanden oder selbst total verschmutzt (Besen und Schaufel)."
444221,6282476,2013-08-06,5317936,Sylvia,"I had a pleasant stay for 3 nights at the Cherry Hill House while apartment hunting.  I did not meet Monika, but she was in touch before I arrived to make sure all my questions were answered and I met Erinn when I arrived.  The house is in a quiet area and close to several bus lines.  Overall a nice place to stay.  "
444221,6455893,2013-08-13,6169568,Ashley,"This room and location were both great! Erinn was a gracious host. The neighborhood is a little noisy when you have the windows open, but all in all this was a great place to stay for the price."
444221,6516684,2013-08-15,6541309,Courtney,"I only stayed here two nights, but it was just what I needed- affordable room and close to the bus lines."
444221,6573472,2013-08-17,8038142,Tina,"This was our first experience with airbnb. A good place to lay your head to sleep. I was hoping and thought there would be more of a 'community' at the house as there were other guests, but did not see anyone until the last morning and they were a very nice couple. Sure wished they would have arrived earlier :)

My only disappointment was in a single bath towel being left in our room. One bath towel for two people for two days seemed a little skimpy, but we made it work.

Thank you Monika"
444221,6587672,2013-08-18,4534336,Arlan,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Monika's house on our trip to the Olympic Penninsula and we had a great time while we were in Seattle. It was confusing at first when we arrived, about how to get in at the residence. But we managed and had the best night's sleep in over a week."
444221,6648800,2013-08-19,4484116,Stephanie,"Monika was out of town when we came through, but was very gracious to check in with us before hand, leave us detailed directions, and make sure her housemate knew we were coming. Unfortunately, there was a party happening at the house late into the night that we stayed there, happening right next to the room that we were staying in, and we were both wiped out from travel and wanted a good night's rest. I saw that the House Rules mentioned quiet hours following 10pm, so was not expecting this, and we were not able to fall asleep until after 3:30am. I was very disappointed and would recommend that anyone who is considering this place check in with Monika beforehand to find out if there will be any nighttime activities, if you plan on getting any sleep."
444221,6693249,2013-08-21,2896832,Steve,"It was a pleasant stay convenient to down town Seattle, Capitol Hill and 1st hill.  I never met Monika, but I did meet with Erin.  There were a few guests staying there which I did meet.  The place was clean and the rules were easy to follow.  I would stay there again. Steve"
444221,6728369,2013-08-23,6350245,Valerie,"We had a good time in Seattle thanks to monika.
The room is clean and it's very easy to go the city with the public transport. The district is quiet."
444221,6868473,2013-08-28,6130749,Nina,The Cherry Hill House is a perfect place to stay when visiting Seattle. The Location is great - just a few blocks from Capitol Hill and the bus stop is right across the street. It is even possible to walk almost everywhere if you feel like it. Erinn and Monika are great hosts. There are always a lot of people staying at the house but everything is clean and all the guests were really considerate regarding other sleeping guests. We would definitely stay at the Cherry Hill House again.
444221,7032650,2013-09-04,5978171,Kyle,"We mostly were just at the house at night, but we slept well and appreciated the comfiness of the room! Thanks!"
444221,7098456,2013-09-06,19081,Massimo,"I stayed for 2 nights, I slept well and bathroom was quite clean. I would recommend Monika's room to everyone who want a cozy place with a low price. "
444221,7491489,2013-09-22,8614940,Rachael,I was in Seattle for five days for the on-site portion of my first term for a graduate program at UW. I decided to stay here because it seemed close to the university and the room had a desk - it was perfect! I pretty much had the kitchen and bathroom to myself and the room was comfortable and exactly what i needed. The house is super centrally located - near several bus lines and it was a 15 minute ride to campus during rush hour. I will definitely be back.
444221,7501396,2013-09-22,7108465,Betsy,The reservation was canceled 38 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
444221,7501398,2013-09-22,7776803,Nat,The reservation was canceled 32 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
444221,7611723,2013-09-26,5333588,Sybille,"I spent just a few days in Seattle, but I had a nice stay at Monika's place. The room is really affordable, clean (well, if you don't search lost things under the bed... :-) ) and the bed is comfy (i just missed the white curtain on the second window, I can see it on the picture, but it wasn't there..). Monika is a nice person and I felt welcome when I arrived. There is a house manual, so it's easy to find all information, about which bus to take and where to find next supermarket and starbucks :)
thank you :)"
444221,7777851,2013-10-02,7882710,Megan,"This room met our needs for a one night stay. It is located in close proximity to great vegan and vegetarian restaurants( bonus for us) museums, the international district, and some rad dive bars. I enjoyed the garden in progress and even got to taste a home grown tomatos.  For the affordable price this was a good place. Because there is an open room rental  attached to the common area quiet hours are strictly observed.  I think we will splurge a few extra dollars next time and get a private rental. Before we arrived I read the email which states two keys are needed, but no location was gave pre arrive as to where to find the keys. We looked around the yard for awhile, then text Monika, who plainly stated via text, that the location of the key was part of the informational e-mail she sent me. I reread the e-mail a few times and still no luck with entrance key location.  After about 20 minutes of trying to find the key  Erin(the person who lives in the main house) came up the walk, showed us where the key was located, and let us in. A drawback of this room rental is the proximity to the kitchen. It was located right next to the kitchen and opposite the bathroom. The room is plane, but has all the necessities.  "
444221,10306304,2014-02-11,12029169,Matt,"Monika's place is nice and quiet despite a heavy AirBnb guest presence. Monika takes a hands-off approach that is ideal for those wanting privacy; I personally prefer a warm welcome, but know that I am free to go elsewhere and pay more than $45 nightly for that. You do get what you pay for: $2 full laundry loads, hidden keys to find at the start and replace at the end, and strict cleanup rules come along with the cheap room pretty damn close to downtown Seattle."
444221,10414700,2014-02-17,3005115,Theresa,"Great location and easy to get to. Kind of a weird set up with the roommate--she didn't make us feel very welcome. The room was as expected. Clean. A nice place to sleep. Only problem was that the bedroom was missing a curtain over one window--in the morning there were people walking around outside so we didn't have a lot of privacy. 

Overall, recommended as a place to crash, but ask for a curtain."
444221,10445416,2014-02-18,10265557,Treavor,"Comfortable quiet place to crash. Room does need a curtain for privacy. Good proximity to lots of stuff. Was a little confusing on check in times and where stuff was, apparently missed an e-mail. Other than that, pleasurable cost effective stay."
444221,10686939,2014-03-03,11825233,Ngwatilo,"The room was clean and had everything we needed except the back curtain others have mentioned. Was never clear on whether I needed to share the heater outside the room with the larger living area. In future I guess it would be something to clarify ahead of time since Monika wasn't there, and I only saw Erin once. Check in was a night frought with some anxiety as the manual which supposedly had everything I needed, didn't in fact tell me where the key was.  In future I would be a little more insistent and questioning especially about the key location until precise instructions *beyond the manual* are given. And whatever other issues one is concerned about from past reviewers. Otherwise the location was easy to get to, I was there for a conference downtown so didn't get to explore things in the neighborhood much except the small store down the road. I would stay again if on a similar budget and type of trip."
444221,10754470,2014-03-05,10899527,Jerome,"A place to sleep for budget travellers. Basic amenities provided. Host was not around, but her room mates were present. They were friendly.  "
444221,10773253,2014-03-06,12338220,Kevin,"Location was quick and easy from my job site. Arrived quite late, checked in took a hot bath and climbed into bed. Room was cozy, mattress was firm, house was very quit. I slept great and even enjoyed the background noise of trains! Will stay again!"
444221,10882388,2014-03-11,12026590,Thomas,"For the purpose of my stay, this place was ideal! Very low admin, easy to find, good instructions! Friendly house mates but not over bearing!

Thanks monika, i will definitely recommend you to friends!"
444221,10973106,2014-03-15,12338220,Kevin,Another great stay
444221,11097047,2014-03-20,5091043,Eva,"Generally it is great! The white curtain is missing ... Also there are other Airbnb guests living in other rooms and carbins attached with the house, so sharing the only ONE single bathroom with 5 to 6 people means relatively long waiting time, especially in the morning"
444221,11136998,2014-03-22,12919435,Susan,"By mutual agreement following a telephone conversation the day of arrival, I did not stay in the home."
444221,11325723,2014-03-30,5191675,Tiffany Elizabeth,Fine place to crash and rest up for adventures around Seattle! Shared the one bathroom with 4-5 other folks which was a bit of a dance but manageable. 
444221,12336771,2014-04-29,5721066,Hui,It was a good experience. The place is clean and tidy. I would highly recommend it for a budget traveller. 
444221,13827638,2014-06-05,14360901,Sebastian,"I was only at the house for one night, but the house was exactly what I was looking for at the time: a good place to crash before catching an early flight. Totally recommend it. "
444221,13850430,2014-06-06,2585026,Colleen,"The room was what I expected - simple, clean, very comfortable bed and the area was quiet.
The neighbourhood is well served by transit which is good - i also walked from the accommodation to Pike Market and it took me one hour - good walk.
Monika responded promptly and Erinn was very helpful.
I would definitely stay there again.  This was my first Airbnb experience and I will be using it again an again.
C Meyer  June 2014"
444221,13979679,2014-06-09,10903693,Henry,"The room was amazing. It was very spacious, and had great lighting. While I never got the chance to meet the host, her housemate was very hospitable and knowledgeable. Out the front yard, there are very cute sculptures that greet you. 

You don't need a car to stay here. It's a great neighborhood that's accessible to public transit, as two bus routes stop within a block of the house (although they have varying frequencies, especially on Sunday). However, the neighborhood is relatively far from vital goods and services, but can still be accessed by walking.

444221,49957444,2015-10-07,41600866,Bo,"good price, make me feel at home"
444221,50137135,2015-10-09,22386957,Vince,The room was clean and the bed comfortable. Monika was very responsive and accommodating. Great place to stay for a night or two! 
444221,50516034,2015-10-12,7537134,Sabrina,"The location of this place was fantastic! We had our vehicle with us but ended up walking almost everywhere. Great coffee, restaurants, and bars were only about 10-20 minutes away. The room was clean and comfortable, and both Monika and Ryan were very accommodating and friendly. We would definitely love to come back and stay with them next time we're in Seattle. "
444221,51387536,2015-10-19,15583262,Jack,"Monika's place worked very well for my brief one-night stay. I only saw her briefly when I arrived. The home is charming, the bed comfortable, and the neighborhood provided some bars/restaurants in modest walking distance. It is important to keep in mind other guests may be staying in other rooms rented through Airbnb; I had no problems with this, but just something of which to be aware. All in all, Monika's place provided me an affordable, quick, and relatively convenient stay during my brief time in Seattle. I would recommend to others, especially to someone on a brief stay in need of an affordable room."
444221,51935093,2015-10-25,30984972,Tom,"The Cozy Bedroom was clean and comfortable.  It had everything I needed.   Although the kitchen was available I did not cook.  The location was within walking distance to Seattle University, where I was visiting."
444221,52158355,2015-10-26,2600165,Sophia,Monika was not there but her housemate was available by text to answer any questions.
444221,52508061,2015-10-30,45543953,Benjamin,"Good neighborhood, walking distance to downtown and lots of shops and restaurants."
444221,53093180,2015-11-04,46541128,Ream,It's not bad. The garden outside is unkempt. The metal bed frame is horrible. The rest is ok given the price.
444221,53254408,2015-11-07,10603016,Jessie & Cameron,"Staying at Monika's was great! She sent me a very detailed message a week or so before our arrival which covered all the bases (How to find the home, how to gain access, which room was ours etc.) The room was just as described. It was easy to get an Uber driver to take us downtown and back. Would definitely stay again."
444221,53749350,2015-11-12,44147400,Eunbee,"Monika told me how to get to the house, some stores located around house very thoroughly in advance, so I don't have to look into it. Location was 30-40 mins from the downtown by walk. Personally, I love the location and I walked to the downtown every day. Although I couldn't have chance to meet Monika, Manager was very nice."
444221,54206690,2015-11-16,7481997,Alex,This Airbnb is an adorable hotel in a convenient part of town. Everything was spotless and the place is run like a well oiled machine! 
444221,54716857,2015-11-23,45482153,Sandra,"I met with Ryan who was incredibly nice and helpful. The room and house was everything that was described. Very cute and cozy! The neighborhood is very quiet, easy access to bus stops and downtown. "
444221,55074705,2015-11-27,31573464,Dmitrii,"Everything was nice, we had room inside of the house, 'couse there are some small houses outside. Only one thing was annoying it's bed because any of your move was accompanied by creaking of the bed :("
444221,55755610,2015-12-05,21607838,Jason,"Nice stay, and the caretaker was v very kind. Would stay again"
444221,56085270,2015-12-08,20214740,Emma,This was a perfect place to stay for a night visiting Seattle. Thank you!
444221,56195519,2015-12-10,36477620,Sarah,Monika and Ryan responded promptly to my request and messages.  I definitely appreciated them being so accommodating with regards to dropping luggage off early. The room was clean and just like the photos.  It was also very warm and cozy because it has its own heater as well! Very convenient location for Swedish Medical Center and the Capitol Hill neighborhood.
444221,56351116,2015-12-12,1916010,Clayton,"I stayed at Monika's place for a couple of days in the room inside the house. Although the weather was a bit dreary and cold (as to be expected in the winter), the place was warm and toasty. She sent instructions a couple of days before the stay, which made the process of getting in and finding the place very easy. I had a great stay with absolutely no issues."
444221,56375397,2015-12-13,43006755,Elise,"I stayed in the Cozy bedroom which is located inside the house. Monika communicated all instructions well before my stay so I didn't have to ask any questions. The bed was very very creaky! Anytime you moved throughout the night it woke up the other person due to the creakiness. My main complaint. You could also hear if anyone else was in the house and the door closest to this bedroom was used a lot so I kept hearing someone come in and out throughout the morning- however, it is an older house and not much you can do about this. Didn't see Monika but saw Ryan as I was leaving. Fulfilled what we needed- a place to lay our heads but again it would be nice if the bed wasn't so creaky."
444221,56634374,2015-12-15,39298271,Nathaniel,Ryan the house manager was very friendly.  Everything was as described in the detailed house rules.  Very clean and convenient location.   Would stay again. 
444221,56701408,2015-12-16,18529183,Felipe,"Great room. Monica sent all I needed before arriving so no many questions asked. Very clean inside. Front yard needs some light but other than that, nothing to complain. "
444221,56874812,2015-12-19,9392108,Diego,"Excelent place. Very well located. Easy access from Pioneer Station (14 blocks, some of them uphill). You can also go walking. Rooms nice, very clean and a good kitchen where you can cook lot of thing. Also a good washing machine. There is a grocery store 2 blocks far from there. A very nice zone (as all Seattle). I really recomend this house. It was a great experience for our first visit to Seattle."
6216116,32709549,2015-05-20,32352805,Loris,It was a great location (plenty of walking distance spots) for a really good price!
6216116,36684028,2015-06-30,29896253,Anthony,"The place was right in the middle of everywhere we wanted to be! It was a hot weather, a few more fans to help cool the place down, would have helped. But I do know, that it doesn't usually get that hot. Michael was prompt and getting back to me, which was great! I'd stay there again!"
6216116,37720854,2015-07-09,937324,Philip,A simple comfortable place in a great location. Good communication and a smooth connection
6216116,37896816,2015-07-11,1172783,Amanda,"Micheal's apartment was an AMAZING deal! Walkable to anything in Capitol Hill as well as pretty much anywhere in downtown Seattle. It was an amazing steal to have the entire apartment to ourselves, at a rate much cheaper than most downtown hotels. Additionally, he went out of his way to make sure we could check in early by hiding a key for us. "
6216116,38960463,2015-07-19,3479683,David,"It is a nice, clean, comfortable apartment in a perfect location and a very good skyline view.  It was helpful that Michael was able to meet me earlier and tell me a little about Seattle. 

I would definitely try to stay again if I return to Seattle.  "
6216116,40336573,2015-07-30,6189952,Roger,"Communication and check-in were fine, with useful flexibility on check-in time. The apartment is in a pretty good location, about 20 mins walk from downtown. There is a nice city view from the balcony, although with the noise from the I5 highway right below you. Cleanliness was a slight issue, with Michael being out of town at handover between short stays I think he somewhat relies on guests leaving the place in a reasonable state for the next people. In all this was definitely better value than any hotel you would get for a similar price."
6216116,40734038,2015-08-02,5489822,Jose I,"Great location, view of the city and easy access. It was warmer than usual and there is no a/c. There were 3 of us and just one fan. A little dust here and there, but overall a nice apt. I would stay again."
6216116,48666255,2015-09-27,34066321,Megan,"The host provided quick communication when I asked for a last minute stay, which I appreciated greatly. The location was nice. That's where the good experience stopped. 

I should have read between the lines on Roger's post, but the apartment was not clean. It smelled musty and mildewy. The carpet was spotted and dirty. The bed was not made well, which raised some red flags. Not to mention the stickiness on all kitchen surfaces. I almost left but then thought I was being picky. Quickly I realized I should have listened to my gut. 

When kindly questioned if the sheets were clean, he responded saying of course. It didn't seem like that and I later realized that they most likely were not clean. I got a text at 2:30 a.m. asking me to make the bed before I left. Of course. I do my best to leave AirBnBs better than I found them. Unfortunately, the next people who were staying at his place (he was out of town for the weekend) crossed paths with me, without any cleaning or change of sheets, towels, etc.. I quickly recounted all of the dirtiness I suspected (private body hair in the shower, rumpled towels, and an unmade, rather smelly bed) and quickly realized that nothing was clean. I was so grossed out. And to think the next unsuspecting people were going to sleep in the bed we had just slept in without any sort of cleaning. Not to mention, use the same towels we used. Unacceptable in my book. 

I am a easy going person and know pot is legal in WA. Without sounding square, I don't think it's great practice to leave out your stash when you're renting out your AirBnB. 

After leaving it definitely cleaner than we found it, I got an accusatory text from him verbatim, ""so you trashed my place?"" To which I quickly responded asking what he was talking about. Thankfully AirBnB was quick to react, saw the text exchange, understood my concerns and refunded my money. After a few days, he responded telling me, ""never mind."" All I could  think was that the people that came in after we left expressed concern over the cleanliness issue, he reacted and blamed me. When he got home, he quickly realized that their concerns were due to his own cleanliness issues, not mine. 

I know I sound harsh and I don't mean to. But there are cleanliness standards that need to be upheld when you're renting out your apartment, especially on AirBnB. I have to say that my experience at Michael's was so unpleasant that I'm re-evaluating my loyalty to AirBnB. Granted they were incredibly nice and accommodating, the conditions that this place was rented out was unacceptable. And with no one regulating those standards, it's tough for me to rationalize it again.

I would advise against staying at Michael's if you have any sort of cleanliness standards."

I wish we had longer there. Great neighbourhood, an easy bus ride from the city with some excellent shops and restaurants and very close to Lake Washington. A bit noisy at night with bus traffic.

Stephanie was delightful, and we had many things in common.  I loved my room:  spacious and functional.  It was hard to stop playing the piano with her, too, when midnight came!
"
1439237,10597405,2014-02-26,11110055,Carol,"What a wonderful first time experience with airbnb. Stephanie was a wonderful hostess, helpful but unobtrusive.  The room was cozy, decorated well and had a great atmosphere.  The bathroom immaculate.  The sunrise over Lake Washington from the coffee shop down the street was breathtakingly beautiful.  The walk down to the public beach only a few blocks away was close enough that I caught the end of it before it finished and could see Mt. Rainier off in the distance circled by clouds at its peak.  Nice neighbor hood with beautiful homes and restaurants close by.  We would definitely stay there again. "

Nos dio toda la información necesaria sobre la ciudad y se esforzó en comunicarse con nuestro inglés desastroso. Todo lo que puedo decir de ella es de 10. El barrio de lo mejor en Seattle, bien comunicado, seguro y con restaurantes y bares pequeños y muy agradables. 
La habitación muy amplia con todos los detalles necesarios, una gran cama de matrimonio y una pequeña pero muy confortable. Mi mejor experiencia airbnb."
1439237,19103721,2014-09-06,7611486,Amanda,"My husband and I had to cancel the first day of our stay and Stephanie was very accommodating with our change of arrival. We did arrive late on our first day and it was no problem at all. Once we arrived in the neighborhood we were excited to explore. Stephanie's home is as lovely inside as it is outside. We didn't get a chance to spend time in the backyard but its beauty was tempting. Our upstairs room was very large with a beautiful skylight and windows facing the street. The room was very clean and open making it easy to relax after a long day. Stephanie provided maps, bus schedules and chocolates which was the perfect touch for our chocolate cravings. 
The Madrona neighborhood is very walkable with breathtaking views of lake Washington. If you are a runner this is a perfect area for a morning run. If you enjoy beautiful gardens and home architecture the walks are great. Just about three blocks north there are restaurants that we ate at, a local ice cream shop and a GREAT breakfast spot. 
Stephanie was always was up for a chat about our day while at the same time was considerate our own space. It felt like we had known her for years it was so comfortable. She was very helpful with questions I had about places to visit that weren't on the typical tourists agenda. Overall our first real stay in Seattle was pretty darn perfect and Stephanie and her home really made that happen. I would definitely stay in her home again. "

Stephanie was such a great hostess who had a lot of knowledge and great ideas about what to see and do in the Seattle area. The couple places she recommended to eat and get coffee right down the street were fantastic! The room was very comfortable, roomy, and clean. Even though we shared the bathroom never once did I have to wait or worry about taking my time showering and getting ready. It actually felt like it was my own! I would highly recommend staying at this beautiful home near Lake Washington if you are ever in the Seattle area!"
1439237,20863701,2014-10-06,21710164,Vivian,"Stephanie was a wonderful host from the very start. When I landed, I received a message from her with directions provided in case I got lost. Of course, I did get lost, but her simple directions were very direct and was even more helpful than Google maps. The place was clean, tidy and warm. Stephanie recommended many places both tourist and local spots to visit. This was my first time using Airbnb and I'm glad I found Stephanie! Great experience, thanks!"

The room was even more comfortable than home, it had more space than we needed, but me and my friend definitely enjoyed chilling and relaxing in it. The location was also very convenient, Stephanie told us what was the best way to get to places, so it was very easy to travel. There are buses that were walking distance, which made it easy to go downtown, the university, or just places you'd want to go in Seattle.

I will stay with Stephanie for an additional three nights following an Alaska cruise. Her home and garden are beautiful and the room itself is spacious and comfortable. I'm always a little worried about beds other than my own, but this bed was extremely comfortable and thus I slept well. Stephanie was there to greet me upon arrival and show me the ropes so to speak. There were all kinds of brochures and bus schedules in the room and wi fi login information. Although the bathroom is shared with Stephanie, it is spotlessly clean and I had no issues with sharing. I highly recommend Stephanie's room and the area. Stephanie is friendly and personable, and I'm looking forward to the rest of my stay with her."

Stephanie was always friendly and welcoming each time I returned to her home, and I found it easy to settle back in. Public transport was just down the road as were cafes and a coffee shop. I found it easy to get a bus into Seattle. I also enjoyed walks down to the lake, not far from Stephanie's home. 
I appreciated my spacious room, the comfortable bed, and the general ease of staying with Stephanie. I would recommend her place to couples and single travelers, but she also has an extra single bed in the large room if you do have a child with you."

The location was exceptional: close to major sites, overlooking Lake Union, quick access to everything. Public transportation right out front, restaurants close by. Great Brunch at Louisa's on our first day. 
The apartment has unbelievable amenities with top of the line new stainless appliances, Miele, Bosch, Samsung; well appointed kitchen. Awesome HD TV and comprehensive cable. The scape from the bedroom window was soothing as was the small patio complete with teak seating and Buddha. Our host added some special touches with several type of great coffee, milk and sugar. We have stayed at many VRBO properties in the US and the Bahamas and this is the best accommodation that we have had. A bargain.

This beautiful apartment is immaculate and perfect in every way, and you will feel like you are staying at the Four Seasons.  Ana was wonderful and met us and made us feel welcome while giving us great shopping and restaurant tips.  The location is absolutely ideal.  We were there to watch my daughter play volleyball at UW and the apartment was a short 5 minute drive to UW and a short 5 minute drive to downtown Seattle.  It was also an added bonus to be able to park right in front of the building.  It is a quick access to all important areas in Seattle and directly off the 5.  The apartment itself is even better than the photos.  Every detail was looked after from the welcome chocolates, plush slippers and robes, shampoo bottles to high quality linens and meticulously clean.  I only wish we could have stayed longer.  The experience exceeded our expectations as I'm sure it will yours.  "

And the location was unbeatable for those who wants to visit University of Washington or hangout in Capitol Hill. Neighbors were quiet and it was so clean, even cleaner than a hotel! Sorry, it was a bit unorganized, but I will definitely book here again if I visit Seattle in the future, and recommend it to my friends!"
4481979,56436468,2015-12-13,13002591,James,"Though she was due to give birth any day, Ana was responsive to our communications. The location was great for Jim's business meeting downtown at the convention center and also for us personally, since our son and his fiancee live a few blocks away. We were able to walk to their apartment and meet them at local restaurants. 
The apartment is really lovely and well appointed. Nice modern decor, but cozy and comfortable. If the weather had been warmer, we would have availed ourselves of the outdoor seating area. Would highly recommend this listing to anyone. "
6555393,38660591,2015-07-17,38021240,Tim,"We had a great stay at Emily's apartment! There was plenty of space for our family of 3, and Emily and her family made us feel very welcome. And we loved the neighborhood! So close to the lake and within walking distance to some nice restaurants."
6555393,39575262,2015-07-24,14569921,Camilla,"Emily and family were very friendly and available to address any questions or problems we encountered.  The neighborhood was quiet and residential, with easy parking, yet a very short walk to a nice brunch spot and pizza place.  The in-law unit met my family's needs in that it had space for my mom (in the living room on sofa) and me, my husband and 3 yo (in the bedroom with both air mattresses), with Wi-fi and access to laundry.  Note that you can hear noise from the upstairs (as is typical with in-law units), but it didn't bother us since it didn't start too early or continue too late.  We spent our days sight-seeing in downtown Seattle and this location worked well for us.  "
6555393,39813027,2015-07-26,8039892,Sotera,Emily's unit was perfect for our needs. Arrival was easy and smooth and we were greeted with some lovely muffins and coffee to help us get out morning started. Emily communicates with you throughout your stay to make sure all your needs are met and that you ate having a comfortable stay. We would definitely book again for our stay in Seattle.
6555393,40280641,2015-07-29,39206290,Yolanda,Our experience was excellent.  The apartment was perfect and spacious for our family of four.  It is a cycler's and runner's hidden gem.  2 great eating experiences within 5 min walking distance (The Flying Squirrel and Both Ways Cafe) and both were recommended by our host.  We parked our car and didn't use it until we left because we used Seattle's good public transportation (the Sound Transit link light rail) which was a 15 min walk.  Emily and her family were extremely accommodating and it was easy to communicate with them.  We plan to stay here again.
6555393,40829856,2015-08-02,3005084,Eloise,"The apartment was perfect! Clean, well-equipped, and very comfortable. Emily and her family were extremely accommodating and we wouldn't hesitate to stay there again."
6555393,42217832,2015-08-11,34479450,Yuchen,Emily's home is very convenient and beautiful. Just 3 blocks north from lake Washington. Bus no.50 is only one block away. Emily is very nice!
6555393,44320182,2015-08-25,14771482,Todd,Needed a place for my dad to stay.  Good location and comfortable.
6555393,45151773,2015-08-31,40995476,Adolfo,"We stayed at Emily's Lake Washington apartment for 4 nights and had an overall great experience. The apartment is attached to the house however due to the layout you feel secluded which is nice. The apartment is small but very quaint and clean. Both beds are air mattresses but are quite comfortable. Location was awesome, only 15 min from downtown and in a quiet neighborhood. You also get your own private driveway. We had some issues that came up but Emily and her husband were accessible the whole time and resolved the issues quickly. Over all two thumbs up and I would stay again. "
6555393,46306506,2015-09-09,13780428,Josephine,"Emily and Salvatore are very nice!
The apartment is absolutely fine considering the good price!"
6555393,47064286,2015-09-15,27734126,Dennis,Emily was great and very welcoming from before we arrived. She was there after we got in to see that we were taken care of and to see if there was anything that we needed while there.  The place is super convenient to the bus line that takes you to downtown. 
6555393,47715561,2015-09-21,4129594,Daniel,Very friendly and attentive host. We found a very clean apartement and is was exactly how described. Good location to explore Seattle with car or public transport. Recommend.
6555393,50474755,2015-10-12,24875570,Rick,Emily was very accommodating and responded to correspondence in a very timely manner. She made a point of meeting and greeting us and checked with us often to make sure we had all that we needed.The online description was accurate and the rental space was very clean and bright. The neighborhood is quiet and easily accessible. Restaurants are close by and Seward Park is also in walking distance. I would definitely return to Emily's.
6555393,54602111,2015-11-22,46674854,Quincy,"We extended our stay so this would be the same review as the last one .... In summary: Great host, great value, great property. Thanks for hosting us!"
6555393,55525098,2015-12-01,46674854,Quincy,"If I could I would rate 6-star for Emily/Salvatore as a host and their property! They were super responsive to whatever needs that we had. The rooms are very clean. Everything works perfectly. The small kitchen is super useful.

Their house is located in a quiet neighborhood. No safety worries at all. It is close to I-90 so you could travel to the East Side easily.  

Don't hesitate to rent from them. It's great value and a perfect short-term rental for a couple, or even a small kid too! Thanks!"
4157572,22631641,2014-11-10,23353476,Lauren,"Stevie and Kevin were awesome.  Their home was modern, clean, spacious and the room we stayed in had beautiful light with a very large closet and private bedroom.  They are trusting and kind.  Two big thumbs up!  Also, their place is situated right in the midst of Columbia City -- super easy to walk!"
4157572,22939503,2014-11-17,15278492,Fra,"We had a great stay! Our room was cozy and very clean. We enjoyed a delicious brunch with Stevie and Kevin, loved Leo the puppie and in the evening we were invited to play the Settler of Catan with them- a perfect day:-) both were really nice and fun to talk to. We definitely would recommend staying there!!"
4157572,23086212,2014-11-22,15524695,Tim,"Stevie and Kevin are the most excellent hosts on the planet. I was made welcome and treated with nothing but respect and generosity. Their room is clean, neat and extremely convenient for traveling professionals. For me the experience was everything that airbnb should be."
4157572,23233557,2014-11-25,6621873,Sławek,When you want to book a place for this same day  communication is the key. Stevie made this stay very easy and pleasant from the very beginning. Their house is amazing. Is a new building and new furniture and cats and dog make all even better. I loved your blow up mattress that was my bed. Didn't really feel this way but the comfort lever was very good.
4157572,23876901,2014-12-13,24372892,Tyler,"Stevie and Kevin were incredibly accomodating hosts! They pointed us directly to the right coffee and food places around their neighborhood, and how to (easily and conveniently) get into town via transit. They even sought connections for when we move to their great city! While we spent little time in the apartment, it was wonderfully kept and modern. Highly recommended! "
4157572,24624085,2014-12-31,4650044,Sylvia,"Highly recommended!

I stayed four nights with Stevie and Kevin, and felt welcome and comfortable from start to finish. This was an excellent place to rest and recharge during the busy holidays. Because their home is close to public transportation, I was able to dash around the city to Ballard, downtown, to Capital Hill, Greenlake, and Wallingford with complete ease. 

Columbia City, just a few minutes walk down the road from Stevie and Kevin's, is now my favorite Seattle neighborhood--quiet and cozy. I indulged in lattes at Columbia City Bakery, reflective yoga at Lotus Yoga, a long walk at Seward Park, and yummy Italian food at Tutta Bella. Oh, and Green Eileen (there are only two branches of Eileen Fisher's consignment store--the other is in Brooklyn) is in Columbia City and requires a visit each time I'm in town.

The low-key room, the wifi, the bed, the entertaining animals, the great location, and Stevie and Kevin's easy-going attitude made my stay memorably pleasant.
"
4157572,25149531,2015-01-07,24292605,Ashley,Stevie and Kevin were excellent hosts and their pets were adorable! I was only there for one night but they made me feel completely at home. I accidentally left some things behind and they text me immediately to let me know. Would definitely recommend!
4157572,25370902,2015-01-13,10372721,Matthew,Stevie's place is very kind and welcoming. Everything you need is available with fast internet. I enjoyed my time there and would recommend anyone to go there. The animals were super lovely and fun to hang out with. Columbia City is a cool place with lots of international culture and I enjoyed my time in this part of Seattle. Stevie and Kevin were fun down to Earth people. 
4157572,25605704,2015-01-20,23118341,Melissa,"Stevie and Kevin were the most amazing hosts. They were so helpful in making our stay enjoyable. They offered excellent recommendations and friendly conversation. We couldn't have asked for a better experience. We enjoyed Emme, Niko, and Leo as well! The room was very clean and comfortable. I would not hesitate to stay again. "
4157572,27344306,2015-03-02,23118341,Melissa,Stevie and Kevin were ever so gracious hosts again. This was my second stay here and it could not have been better. The location is in close proximity to 2 light rail stations and Stevie & Kevin will guide you with any info you could ask for.  The room is clean and oh so comfortable. They truly are a pleasure to chat with and make you feel right at home. 
4157572,27626978,2015-03-08,26431325,Paul,"We stayed for 2 nights at Stevies place and it was very nice! We really appreciate the kind and open minded way of Stevie and Kevin. Thank you for your time and for the room! 
PS: Leo the dog is so cute!"
4157572,27700862,2015-03-09,28758359,Alexandria,"Stevie was such a lovey host. Upon arrival, she heard my horrible cough and promptly made me some herbal tea. The house was very modern and bright, and the room well-kept and lovely. The house is situated near some sweet restaraunts and a short distance away from downtown. Leo and the two cats made the trip extra special! I would highly recommend anyone to stay at Stevie's! "
4157572,28493524,2015-03-24,23388717,Jing,"Stevie and Kevin are great host and I love their house and their pet friends--Leo, Emme and Niko. They all become one part of my good memory in Seattle. Thank them all! Five star recommendation! "
4157572,28729065,2015-03-29,21605596,Johanne,"Stevie and Kevin are the sweetest and the most adorable couple ever !!! They made us feel at home right away along with the cute and friendly pets:):) the house is warm and nicely decorated. The bed room as a nice walk in and the guests have their private bathroom. The neighbourhood is also nice and quiet with easy parking on the street. The train to the city of Seattle is also a walking distance. Stevie and Kevin will help you with any interrogations you have, they know about the 
nicest place to eat and visit. We highly recommend Stevie and Kevin's house and if we ever go back to Seattle we'll definitely stay with them . Thank you for a wonderful experience :):):)"
4157572,28915567,2015-03-31,29895536,Biao,"Stevie and Kevin are more hospitable than you can imagine! They would talk with you and provide any information for whatever you want! Their pets are very friendly as well. Like host, like dogs/cats! I will definitely choose it again if I visit Seattle next time! "
4157572,30137072,2015-04-18,11393464,João Christiano,"Todo tempo de minha estadia na casa de Stevie e Kevin foram espetaculares superaram minhas expectativas a família é muito atenciosa começando de Leo e o casal de gato que me recepcionaram logo que acordei para receber os grandes amigos!
Quanto ao lugar Columbia City nada a desejar para lugar algum se encontra tudo sem precisar carro fácil acesso ao mercado é um excelente meio de transporte que pode te interligar a qualquer lugar do mundo começando do Light Rail que te leva do aeroporto até o centro de Seattle passando por Columbia City por onde tive grandes alegrias de pensar que tudo é possível com boa vontade racional que o povo americano sabe ter.
Muito obrigado Airbnb por me dar este previlegio de conhecer este casal maravilhoso Stevie e Kevin um lugar que está para sempre em meu coração é que pretendo voltar logo!
Christiano Godoy "
4157572,31054320,2015-05-01,30380215,Kara,"We had a serious medical emergency onsite at the airbnb.  Stevie and Kevin provided calm, quick and effective response that literally saved a life.  It was comforting to know that our hosts were so open and willing to extend themselves to help people they had just met.  
This was our first experience with airbnb.  We had friends close by in the city, but it was nice to have independent accommodations.  The private bedroom and bathroom were clean, bright and modern, as described.  The house is on a unique little street parallel to a busy thoroughfare.  It was tricky to find at first, but we then appreciated easy access on the quiet street. 
Thanks to Stevie and Kevin, our first airbnb experience opened possibilities for future stays in other locations!"
4157572,31602383,2015-05-07,29344402,Amay,"A wonderful little home with hosts to match :) As a first-time airbnb user, the bar has been set pretty high.

Well located, clean, comfortable, a piano, innumerable books to read, welcoming pets, the list can go on. All in a quiet little lane just a stone's throw from several restaurants and a bus stop; it worked perfectly for us. 

You would be hard pressed to find a more accommodating, relaxed, interesting and friendly pair of people. "
4157572,31854472,2015-05-10,22170689,Samuel,"Staying at Stevie's place was a real treat. From my arrival to my departure, everything was handled very well by her and her partner. The place itself is very well maintained and the pets there were so inviting! Their dog, Leo, especially! If I'm ever in the area again I'll be sure to stop by again and get some more restaurant recommendations from them. I'd definitely recommend this place to a friend visiting Seattle. "
4157572,32567538,2015-05-19,14386378,Lukas,The house is large and the room spacious. The private bathroom is also great. We had a pleasant time at Stevie and Kevin. Both are super nice. To Downtown it is by car only a few minutes. Shops are within walking distance. Definitely recommended!
4157572,33075930,2015-05-25,27440979,Diane/Steven,"Stevie and Kevin's home was the perfect place to stay during our visit to Seattle. The house is ultramodern and has some really interesting design features. The room was spotless and we enjoyed the private bathroom as well as the spacious closet. Although we were out and about for most of our stay here, it was so nice to chat with our hosts on the night of our arrival. We especially appreciated their help with hauling our luggage back and forth from our car. In addition, we loved their kittens and already miss their friendly presence. We would highly recommend staying with this kind couple to any traveler. "
4157572,33524565,2015-05-29,32628646,Stephanie,"What an amazing gem we found in our stay in Columbia City! Not only was the room and private bath sparkling and charming, but our hosts were truly fantastic! (And so were their darling fur babies) We were nervous that we had chosen too far out of the city to stay, however it turned into a welcome blessing. The tiny downtown area of Columbia City is quaint and inviting and we enjoyed breakfast & coffee at a Geraldine's & Empire Coffee (both recommended) each morning before heading into Seattle. The light rail was a short, quiet walk a few blocks and was a great start and end to each day! If you need/want recommendations just ask Kevin & Stevie!!! Everything they recommended exceeded our expectations! "
4157572,33817885,2015-06-01,32199994,Marielle,"My stay was very comfortable and accommodating, and they offered me great suggestions on what to do during my short weekend in Seattle. The house is great with modern amenities and was just very enjoyable, plus I loved the pets! The neighborhood is removed from downtown Seattle, where I spent most of my time during the visit. It was about a 30-40 minute bus ride. In Columbia City, though, the listing is a short walk from the neighborhood shops and restaurants, which were also worth checking out. "
4157572,33962543,2015-06-02,17735984,Smriti,"Even though we didn't meet Stevie, she left us a personalized note, some candy and personalized suggestions for places to visit and eateries in Seattle. Kevin, Nico, Emme and Leo made our arrival so pleasant. The room was comfortable and we had the best sleep! Highly highly recommend if you are in Seattle! One of the best hosts we ve met. "
4157572,34216023,2015-06-06,32427702,Aaron,"This was an amazing experience. Stevie provided us with everything from adoring pets to a spacious airy room with a huge closet to freshly baked muffins in the morning. The house was beautiful and spotless, and the friendly hosts made themselves available for all questions and neighborhood suggestions. Would highly recommend to all seeking accommodation in Seattle. "
4157572,35068773,2015-06-15,22355715,Joel,"We had an awesome experience at Stevie and Kevin's house in Seattle. We had some great talks with them as well as some much needed r&r with the pets. We missed our dogs immensely so having Leo, Niko and Emme at the house was amazing (even though I really dislike cats). 

There house is about a 10 minute walk to the train station and then a 25 minute bus ride to the heart of Seattle. There is so much to do in Seattle and we especially recommend Pike Place markets as well as a ferry to Bainbridge Island to take in the amazing panoramic views of downtown Seattle.

We had the pleasure of having Stevie and Kevin join us at the local water hole for a few drinks and we had a great time. Great people, great space, great animals, amazing time! Thanks guys!"
4157572,35948959,2015-06-23,2440891,Gary,The host couple were very warm and easy to talk to
4157572,37164858,2015-07-05,11919381,Lauren,"Incredibly welcoming environment to stay in while visiting Seattle! Columbia City is an immensely charming area and is only a quick train ride from the major attractions. We can't speak highly enough about our hosts, Stevie/Kevin/adorable pets. They're absolutely wonderful!"
4157572,37457523,2015-07-07,8002063,Erik,Stevie was a terrific host! We had a wonderful time in Seattle and her sweet cats and dog were great company as well!
4157572,37874401,2015-07-11,35298279,Jennifer,"Stevie and Kevin were great hosts and their pets were wonderful hostettes. I really appreciated Stevie's guidebook which gave great suggestions for restaurants and things to do in the area, and she was happy to give us a few more tips when we met in person. This spot is set back from the bustle of downtown but very close to public transportation options. For example, I flew into town and took the light rail to the Columbia City station. A friend was able to pick me up from the station which was good because the walk to the place could have been a bit awkward with my rolling luggage. In all I loved our stay and felt it was a perfect distance to the attractions we wanted to see in and out of the city. "
4157572,38208183,2015-07-13,37194199,Jennifer,"Stevie and Kevin were wonderful and welcoming. Their place was very modern, hip and clean, and the two of them were sharp, interesting people and great conversationalists. They made us feel right at home! 
Stevie was very prompt at responding to our questions before our stay, and was flexible about us arriving considerably later than we had expected."
4157572,38717019,2015-07-18,6505698,Lea,"Stevie and Kevin were amazing hosts! We were there for 3 days, 2 nights and we barely even saw them due to work schedules. It felt like we had the place to ourselves with the loving company of the house pets. The room was exactly as described, they provided lots of tourist materials and recommendations. Walking to and from the Link was a breeze and made getting into downtown a cinch. I would highly recommend this location to anyone who is looking to stay just outside of downtown."
4157572,39388173,2015-07-23,32326929,Karen,"We had such a great stay! The house and our room were so lovely, everything was furnished with attention to details. Stevie and Kevin were so helpful and nice hosts :-)!! 
We had a wonderful time :-). "
4157572,39822816,2015-07-26,29540188,Ashley,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights.  Stevie messaged me a few days prior to our arrival with specific instructions on how to get there, where to and where not to park, and how to get in to the house.  She was very responsive to all of our messages and inquiries.  Her, Kevin, and all the furry housemates were welcoming and friendly.  The room was as described; own room with walk in closet and private bathroom in the hallway.  They gave us a lot of recommendations both in person and on a sheet in the room; other house guests left messages with their recommendations too!  Columbia City is a very diverse town and we enjoyed exploring it.  Stevie and Kevin recommended an Ethiopian place to us; TRY IT!  It was very tasty! They live about a 10-15 minute walk from the light rail which takes you straight to downtown.  "
4157572,39951402,2015-07-27,4276274,Jennifer,"Stevie and Kevin welcomed us to their home, as did Leo, Emma and Niko. Lovely big clean room and washroom, and a super comfy bed. Great neighborhood and easy access to downtown. We highly recommend this place."
4157572,40235980,2015-07-29,25773168,Lauren,"Stevie and Kevin were great hosts. Fun to chat with and a nice clean modern space to come home too. Good communication for changes and such.  Loved their pup, he is friendly and adorable. Walkable area in day but felt better uber - ing at night."
4157572,40589215,2015-08-01,33693333,Laurie,"Stevie and Kevin were very friendly and accommodating and their place is just as described. Pets are sweethearts. Clean and cute and bed was comfortable (a little low to ground if that is an issue for anyone, was not a problem for us). The area was a 20 minute walk to lightrail, about 8-9 blocks and some of it is rather iffy neighborhood as this is an area that is in the process of turning around. Fine during day but I'd take a cab at night."
4157572,41119821,2015-08-04,38030512,Nathan,Stevie is a great host! She's almost as welcoming as her pets. 
4157572,41979027,2015-08-10,36923496,Alanna,"It was great staying with Stevie and Kevin. I only stayed for an evening - but the room was so comfy, clean and I loved the company of the pets. Stevie and Kevin are a great, interesting couple and I loved chatting with them over coffee in the morning. Their house is beautiful too. Well worth a stay! "
4157572,42341948,2015-08-12,30026283,James,"Stevie and Kevin did a great job making me feel welcome — very communicative both ahead of my stay and when we met in person in the house.

The setup is cozy and comfortable, and they've done a great job paying attention to thoughtful details. "
4157572,42862579,2015-08-16,19802480,Barry,"Stevie and Kevin have posted an accurate description of their modernly styled and furnished home.  Folks with animal allergies should look elsewhere, but animal lovers will enjoy the company of Niko, Emme, (cats) and Leo, the excitable and very friendly dog.

Columbia City, the neighborhood, has a wealth of interesting opportunities to visit, shop, and dine.  Access to downtown is only 15 to 20 minutes--traffic permitting.

We had a great time, and Stevies muffins are great!
"
4157572,43421278,2015-08-19,40334671,Kayla,"I sincerely enjoyed staying in Columbia City at Stevie's home- the room, bathroom, and common areas were spotless and charming. I love the south side of Seattle, and it was great to have some good games of scrabble, fun times with the pets, and conversations as I explored my favorite places again. Many thanks to Stevie- a very knowledgeable and friendly host!"
4157572,43802861,2015-08-22,38699439,Ernest,"Had a great stay, thanks Stevie and Kevin. Room and bathroom was perfect and we enjoyed your place and the area after getting to know it better. Everything in close vicinity i.e. shops, restaurants and public transport to reach downtown Seattle.
Thanks for the muffins - we really enjoyed that on the train on our way to Vancouver.
We recommend their place should you want to visit Seattle."
4157572,44124652,2015-08-24,15881559,Mario,"The great experience started even before we arrived. Stevie sent me a welcome message with instructions on how to enter the home, should she not be there. Our stay was great, good location to pubs, great food, hiking and lakes. The room and private bathroom were super clean and comfortable. Thanks for the great experience!"
4157572,44582653,2015-08-27,41203328,Shanelle,Stevie was an amazing host! The house was very clean and her pets were very welcoming. It was easy to get the keys and find the place because it is very unique-looking! It was an awesome experience for my first AirBnB. Totally recommend if you're in the Seattle area! 
4157572,45586841,2015-09-04,38538359,Matus,"Everything went fine. We had good communication before our arrival, and both Stevie and Kevin were friendly and helpful with everything during our stay. They live in a very cool house - nice architecture and great contemporary interior design. The neighborhood is very ethnically diverse, and the pets are a nice plus. Recommended."
4157572,47192733,2015-09-16,42711513,Rachael,"Stevie and Kevin are wonderful hosts- always available for advice and help.  They have a really nice, modern house in a fun neighborhood within walking distance to restaurants, bars, and groceries.  The room and private bath are spacious and comfortable.  We really enjoyed our stay!"
4157572,47334045,2015-09-17,24981341,Erin,"Stevie was wonderful - she had great suggestions on what to do around town, and overall she was very kind and friendly.  The room and bathroom were as described: clean, bright and awaiting my arrival!  Her pets were sweet and fun to have around too.  I very much enjoyed my stay and would come again.  Thanks, Stevie!"
4157572,47518012,2015-09-19,34390207,D J,"Stevie and Kevin were most welcoming as was their bright little pooch, Leo! The accommodations were exactly as described, and worked for me beautifully. The proximity to the Columbia City train station makes hanging out in Columbia City, without a car, very easy. Both Stevie and Kevin were happy to engage in conversation which we did for quite awhile the first evening, and this was enjoyable and enlightening. I would most definitely stay here again!"
4157572,47595242,2015-09-20,44381532,Yang,"It was very nice of staying in that gorgeous house. The room is nice and clean, the bed is very comfortable, the private bathroom is quite modern and nice as well. We didn't meet Stevie since we arrived too late, but her boyfriend was very friendly and helped us exploring the city. And I like their cute dog and cats as well. If I go back visiting Seattle, I'd love to go and stay there again. "
4157572,47935395,2015-09-21,9965976,Ngaire,"We only had a brief interaction with Stevie due to a late arrival and early departure, however she accommodated us perfectly. The location was excellent for our stay as the nearby neighborhood was interesting with great options for dining. The room was clean and cosy. Great bed. Highly recommended. "
4157572,48565992,2015-09-27,41586941,Keren,"Great place to stay-clean, comfortable, private, convenient location, friendly hosts. Recommend to anyone. Thanks Stevie and (website hidden). MONTANA WAS FANTASTIC!"
4157572,48962101,2015-09-29,43869633,Kerstin & Chris,"They were awesome hosts and we highly recommend them! 
Very nice, clean home and sweet pets. We really enjoyed our stay and would have loved to stay longer. If we are around again, we'd loved to stay with you again, thank you for a great time!"
4157572,49019150,2015-09-30,14622505,Winnie,"we just stayed at this room for one night. The room makes me feel like home! Bed is very comfortable and bathroom is clean. Hosts (Stevie and Kevin) are very friendly and nice. They are willing to help which we feel good as this is our first stay in Seattle! although we don't have much time to talk more with them but we can tell they are very kind.

We picked this room somehow because I love pets a lot! Stevie & Kevin's dog and two cats are very cute and friendly. They like to stick with us ,haha. But need to take note that one of the cats likes to walk in the room, It came to our room few times as we didn't close the door. 
If you mind it, just close the door. Anyway, all pets are adorable. 

The experience is fun to stay in a local home as I am from Asia! Feel like I am acting in US TV drama and it feels good by meeting good hosts."
4157572,49663018,2015-10-05,43781698,James,"Great place and great location!  Super friendly hosts, including the pets.  :)

Clean, quiet location.  
Free parking, easy to find parking on the street.
Comfy bed."
4157572,50662519,2015-10-13,12974350,Bentley,"Our host was very welcoming. The room and bathroom were very clean. The bed was surprisingly very cozy. Their pets were also very affectionate and entertaining. The neighbourhood was a bit difficult to find parking close to the actual place, but not too bad of a walk. Overall, I'd stay again if I'm in the Seattle area."
4157572,51002404,2015-10-16,19589739,Jason,"Wonderful, comfortable, clean and easy. Location was easy to get to and from. Stevie and Kevin are the perfect hosts - Thank you!"
4157572,51081005,2015-10-17,2819329,Stephanie And Michael,I arrived late in the evening and her husband was welcoming and accommodating. The bedroom and bathroom were clean and the bed comfy. Convenient to downtown Seattle.
4157572,51386988,2015-10-19,16431232,Holli,"The home was very clean and welcoming, and the bed was comfortable.  We loved the pets - very sweet and friendly.  We never actually saw Stevie and Kevin, but they were very welcoming through the emails we exchanged."
4157572,51598765,2015-10-21,16073380,Alison,"I stayed 1 night for business. Found Stevie very friendly via messenger and helpful. I only met Kevin who was also very kind. Their pets were adorable! I felt very comfortable in their home. Having private bathroom was nice. Bed comfy, spacious closet to unload/hang clothes. Location nice-- found best coffee shop I've ever been to with homemade cashew milk- delicious!! Value for stay excellent. Thanks, Stevie and Kevin!"
4157572,51851912,2015-10-24,35667583,Austin,Had a wonderful time even though a shirt visit in Seattle. Very helpful on how to easily snag a short bus ride to my concert and back. Highly recommend! :)
4157572,51975612,2015-10-25,30593322,Sungka,"Stevie and Kevin were great hosts. and very helpful . We loved the pets very friendly. Also, we stayed so nice and clean room. Thank you"
4157572,52659002,2015-10-31,6478504,Rhiannon,Stevie and Kevin were wonderful hosts! We arrived late and they made us feel at home in their beautiful room! They're lovely people with the adorable pets and if we had the time we would have loved to stay longer! 
4157572,54175325,2015-11-16,34537930,Lauren,"We had a wonderful stay. Our room and bathroom were comfortable and clean and Stevie and Kevin were helpful and kind. 
"
4157572,55447654,2015-12-01,17356145,Monica,"Stevie and Kevin were great hosts, very friendly and welcoming and great company. The house itself is awesome and very homely and the bed super comfy. The area is very convenient with all local amenities and good transport links. Everything we could have asked for, would highly recommend. "
4157572,55958893,2015-12-07,49356915,Brian,"Stevie and Kevin made my girlfriend's and my first ABnB experience an exceptional one!  Super friendly and hospitable and they made some great suggestions on where to explore and eat around town, which was greatly appreciated since my girlfriend has a gluten intolerance!

We both thoroughly enjoyed their pup Leo and their two cats Emme and Nikko and left us wishing we had more time to enjoy them as we spent the majority of our time exploring.  Their place truly felt like a home away from home the 2.5 days we stayed with them, and perfect distance from light rail for us.  The bed was clean and comfortable,  and the comforter was even more than enough to keep my girlfriend toasty even thought it wasn't what I'd call cold.

I could go on,  but I'm sure you get the point that this is a great place to stay!"
4157572,56669271,2015-12-16,43450669,Madisan,"This was the last stop for our trip and the host made us feel so welcome we didn't want to leave! The space was very clean, the location was easy to find and their animals were so sweet. The host was very easy to talk to and recommended great places in a variety of areas around Seattle. I would recommend this listing time and time again!"
7678064,51371980,2015-10-19,23137995,Amy,"I never met Martha because the townhouse was pin access (extremely convenient-- especially for multiple guests!), but she was great at keeping in touch leading up to my stay and during. The house was clean, beds comfortable and rooms private. Just a 10-15 walk down quiet neighborhoods to the Pacific Science Center!"
7678064,54549883,2015-11-21,1271086,Phil,"Great place, great location. Would stay again"
7678064,57805067,2015-12-29,7273493,Howard,"Martha's Seattle House was perfect for our family reunion for which traveled overseas.  We were surprised to see the place to be better than pictured.  The house was in pristine condition and incredibly clean.  What was particularly helpful for us was having rooms spread across three floors because there were toddlers and adults, and it was a good way to isolate the noise so people with different sleep schedules can sleep.  The beds were comfortable, sheets clean, and the kitchen fully stocked for us to cook a number of home-cooked meals.  Ample closet space and the nice in-unit laundry system was incredibly convenient.  The electronic keyless access was also convenient  helped as to get in and out easily.  The neighborhood is quiet and grocery store very close, without being too far from the heart of downtown.  Martha was able to accommodate an early check-in and she was a very low-maintenance easy host overall.  Our entire family loved this place and would definitely stay again! "
293890,923285,2012-02-15,653295,Nicole,"I love staying in a place with verified photos, because I know I am getting exactly what I am seeing in the pictures. Laura was great she was available to answer any question I had before and during my stay. There was always street parking available and it is really close to the UW area if you are visiting friend or family. The place was spotless, and heaters are placed strategically around the apartment so the temperature was always perfect. In fact Laura set them up for me before I arrived, so I didn't have to do anything to them the entire week I was there. The kitchen is really cute, great use of space hanging the pots up, and anything you need is in the drawers (unless we are talking things to cook, that you will have to bring). I would definitely recommend Laura's place."
293890,968796,2012-03-04,38599,Ann,"The whole interaction with the host was easy and Laura was very helpful. Though she was away for work when we arrived, we were able to pick up the key and receive a tour/instructions from housemate Bob. The place is as it appears in the pictures. It's not fancy but perfectly comfortable. It has been freshly painted, was clean and warm (on a cold night). The kitchen was a bonus so we could make breakfast for ourselves before heading out.  On street parking and easy access to public transport is convenient. Thanks Laura and hope your new project goes well for you."
293890,968957,2012-03-04,1728748,Ben,Laura was a very gracious host and made everything so easy. We would stay there again in a heartbeat!
293890,1043904,2012-03-26,1778291,Patrick,"Host was on top of any requests I had.  Space was as described.  However, safety and privacy was a concern during my stay.  The main door has a large open window inserted where anyone can look inside.  There were no drapes for any of the windows, so that anyone may look in at any time.  Walk way to the back a little cluttered and dark.  Tripped a few times coming home.

Otherwise, value for the space was good.  This is my first Airbnb, and I am not sure I will repeat.  Thanks."
293890,1339774,2012-05-24,122255,Tamara,"Best value for two bedrooms! The place didn't have any window coverings, and not well lit at night time-safety main concern. "
293890,1349406,2012-05-26,1723547,Sky,Laura was great!!  The place was perfect.  
293890,1427714,2012-06-06,2365364,Theresa,"Pluses:  Clean (mostly); quiet; private; location, especially if you're vegan or don't have a car, is perfect

Minuses:  Wireless internet did not function for more than a few seconds so the place really does not have wireless access.
There is a one roll of toilet paper policy that I find a little weird, so be prepared to buy more.  

"
293890,1464649,2012-06-12,528341,Ethel,"Pros: Residence is close to the University District; a quiet neighborhood.   Both bedrooms have ample closet space.  We slept in the master bedroom. The extra blankets and pillows made the bed very comfortable.  The nightstand's lamps gave a bright light for reading.  The bathroom is large and towels are provided.  The apartment is heated with space heaters.  They were all set when we arrived and really kept the area warm.   The kitchen has some very nice cookware and cutlery.   Many eateries are within walking distance.  A no frills place - good value for the space.  Laura promptly responded to emails and phone calls. 


Cons:   Low ceilings in some areas of the apartment.  The floor, except in the bathroom, is covered with black foam matting used underneath exercise equipment.   We kept tripping over the ""bubble” where it does not lay flat.  Wear slippers or indoor shoes - I am not sure how the floor is cleaned other than to vacuum over it.
  
The only mirror is located in the bathroom.  The fixtures were clean.  However, the bottom of the shower curtain appeared moldy – needs replaced.   It did not wrap around the entire tub.   Be sure to check the toilet paper on hand, as you will need to supply your own.  We did not find out about the toilet paper until our 2nd day.  Suggestion: post this in the bathroom.     

I asked Laura if an iron and ironing board were available.  She commented, ""People in Seattle don't iron their clothes.""  I was taken aback by her comment.  This may be true of some people in Seattle, but certainly not of all the people in Seattle.  Anyways...Laura did offer the use of her iron and ironing board.  She warned me that her iron had some issues - shutting off (and a scorched faceplate) - but it worked fine for us.  I appreciated her allowing us to use hers as we thought we would have to go out and buy one. 

The kitchen - No coffee pot!    A French press instead.  I had no idea how to use one.  No instructions provided.   I called Laura.  She told me “there are lots of places to buy coffee.”  True…but who wants to go out at 4:30 am and buy a cup of coffee?  Anyways, Laura did come and show me how to assemble the French press.   Learning new ways is a good thing…however; I prefer the coffee pot – because it keeps the coffee hot longer.  This would not have been an issue IF a microwave were available to reheat the coffee. The dishwasher had dishes in it.  This made me think that the housekeeping was not up to par.  I did not remove them and we did not use the dishwasher.  No instructions on where to place composting items, trash, bedding, and towels upon departure. 

The walkway - door – entry.  This is NOT a place for someone with mobility issues.  The walkway is hazardous and obstructed.  No outdoor light.  Laura did give us a flashlight – a small key ring with a light…not an effective solution.  There is an overhead light at the entrance, but it is not operational.  The key and the lock are tricky to work.  Glass wine bottles stand on end to fill a deep hole adjacent to the stairwell.  This is a safety issue.   Yard area - debris covered and overgrown with grass/weeds.  No outdoor seating area.   We did not use the washer and/or dryer. 
"
293890,1540798,2012-06-23,2234060,Susan,"The path to the basement had bottles placed upsidedown to cover up a hole in the ground.  The basement floor was covered in foam pieces, not carpet or traditional floor. The ceiling was so low we had to duck down.  The beds were OK.  The bathroom needed work and I thought maybe I saw mold above the shower.  There was no soap provided for the bathroom.  The dishes provided in the kitchen were very large and few.  We were a family with kids and this was NOT a good place to stay for our family."
293890,1565570,2012-06-26,1880374,Aaron And Lila,"The price was really great and the space was extremely spacious just like described.  It was nice to have a full kitchen and two separate bedrooms for myself, my partner and our two kids.  The beds were simple and firm but I liked that.  The king bed is huge!  The price is really incredible for being so close to downtown Seattle and being so large.  It was very clean.  My two kids had their own room with two twin beds.  Laura was very nice and gave us a full tour and explained everything.

I wouldn't call the space ""cozy"" though.  It is very sparsely furnished and it isn't really decorated at all per se.  There are no window coverings which isn't really a problem as far as people seeing in but it makes the space look stark and unfinished.  I wasn't particularly found of the rubber mat ""carpet"" throughout.  Again, it makes the space more stark than ""cozy"".   The internet service was spotty at best and many times simply didn't work at all which was frustrating.  I found the $200 cleaning deposit to be a bit extreme considering that the place is so stark and simple.  How much damage could I do to rubber covered concrete floors?

All said, if you are in need of spacious 2 bedroom with a full kitchen accomodations at bargain basement price, this will fit the bill perfectly.  On the other hand, if you like nicely decorated spaces and have a little more money to spend on accomodations that are inviting and truly cozy, you might want to look elsewhere."
293890,1605473,2012-07-01,2601749,Ted,"First the good: Plenty of space for our three adults and two preschoolers.  Clear instructions written throughout the place so we knew what was expected (compost & recycling rules, etc).  Location is great, right in the city.

Bad: Floor is uneven, we fell at lease twice.  Very low ceiling in places (don't be over 5'10"" or you'll hit your head).  No window coverings so very light in bedrooms both at night and in the morning (our preschoolers go to be long before dark, and tend to wake up with the sun unless we can darken the room).  The entrance is in the back and the way back there is very narrow, slippery and has quite a bit of broken glass (much of it seems like intentionally placed beach glass but still made us leery with our little ones).  "
293890,1620066,2012-07-03,2208778,Courtney,Laura was very prompt and available for all questions. We love the neighborhood and her space is perfect for venturing out and about.
293890,1673834,2012-07-10,2007780,Janifer,Location is very good for us. It close to #66 bus station to downtown. Convenient to supermarket shop. Restaurent nearby. We love this place.
293890,2035170,2012-08-19,911992,Derek,"Laura was a great, thorough, prepared and friendly hostess.  

The place was a basement unit, and was far from luxurious, though it was never advertised as such.  It was very neat, clean and orderly, though.  And, it was a great value and bang for the buck.  Prices in Seattle in the summer can be pretty steep, and this place had 2 bedrooms 1 bathroom and a full kitchen.  It also stays very cool in the summer which is a big plus.  Overall, it was a great value and I'd stay there again.  I wanted to give it 4 stars, but it was lacking a bit of the refinement I'd reserve for 4 stars (like carpet, bright lighting, non-basement/alley entry)..  but she was so nice and we enjoyed our stay overall and it was a very good deal!"
293890,2461503,2012-10-01,2245784,Brittany,"This location was absolutely perfect for me. I was in town for a month-long yoga teacher training program, and this location was about a 5 minute drive from the yoga studio which was perfect. I'm a vegan and my boyfriend is a vegetarian and this location is walking distance to several vegetarian and vegan restaurants which was wonderfully convenient for us. The price for the entire basement apartment and the amount of time we stayed was unbeatable. I would recommend staying here to my friends, and I would stay here again."
293890,5173746,2013-06-17,519413,Linda,"Location is the greatest asset and is roomy for four people.  Beds are low as in Europe, nice kitchenette with dishes.  In basement , low ceilings though, tall people must stoop where ceiling is lower for covered ductwork.  Flooring is unusual but functional.  "
293890,5309449,2013-06-24,4218781,Grant,"Our family would recommend this as a friendly, clean, convenient, economical option for Seattle. 
We had a nice stay in Laura's basement apartment. They have  thoughtfully appointed the apartment with everything you need for a comfortable stay. It is very spacious. For our little family (2 adults 3 kids) it was nice to have room to stretch out. Plenty of room for a port-a-crib in the master bed room. It was also nice to have a separate entrance to come and go without concern. It was not fancy but clean.  

It has great access to the 1-5 which made going down town a breeze. The parking is street parking but we never had a problem finding a convenient spot. 

One observation, it is a basement and the ceiling is low. At 5'9"" I never hit my head but any taller and it would have been a concern. If this isn't an issue for you then I would recommend this place for a pleasant, economical option in Seattle. "
293890,6952149,2013-09-01,4590315,Paula,"We rented the apartment for 2 months.We found it to be comfortable and accessible to bus routes,grocery ,and restaurants.Laura was available,but not intrusive. The basement apartment was comfortable ,even in the summer heat.I would definitely rent this again."

As a New Yorker, getting there by public transit was a breeze for me. The key exchange was seamless. I love that her kitchen is well stocked with herbs and spices. It was also great that Trader Joe's is about a 5 min walk away. This was a perfect place for me to stay for my first visit to Seattle, and I'd surely want to stay there again. Just watch your head in the bathroom with that slanted ceiling. I definitely bumped mine and I'm only 5'6"". Thanks, Winnie!"
789966,4071459,2013-04-07,3324488,Nicole,"Winnie's apartment is so beautiful! I absolutely loved staying there for a night! Winnie if it's okay with you, I would love to book another weekend at some point. Great location! So cosy! Winnie was so accommodating at very short notice, and made us feel SO at home, even offering us slippers as we arrived :)

Thank you so much Winnie! You were great!"
789966,4348756,2013-04-29,2051789,Nic,"We had a great stay at Winnie's apartment. It was really comfortable and starting the day with one of her a hot teas was perfect. True, the bathroom is a bit on the tiny side with the slanted roof but I'm over 6' and managed OK. Winnie's apartment really is super convenient to Capital Hill (we walked there) and it's an easy light rail + bus trip to/from the airport. Thanks for helping make our stay in Seattle a real joy, Winnie."
789966,5226370,2013-06-19,4239035,Andrew,"Great place, well situated for Capitol Hill and on to Downtown. Light apartment, plenty of space, clean and well decorated. Key arrangements were perfect. Would recommend."
789966,5314639,2013-06-24,6255528,Gwen,"We ended up not meeting Winnie, but getting the keys to the apartment was seamless. It's a cozy apartment, but just enough for a weekend getaway in Seattle. She suggested a variety of stuff to do while we were in town and great at keeping communication with us. Thanks again!"

789966,5558294,2013-07-06,6197992,Katie,"We stayed at Winnie's apartment for 3 nights.  It was wonderful.  Winnie was very accommodating.  We had a third guest and she left us sheets for the futon in the living room.  She also provided us three towels.  It was very nice. 

The apartment was clean and had plenty of space.  The location was great.  We loved staying here and would definitely stay here again in the future. 

Winnie was also very helpful and provided some insider's tips for things to do in Seattle.  We really appreciated it.  

I would recommend this place to anyone looking for an affordable getaway in Seattle.  "
789966,5661254,2013-07-10,4932764,Zachary,"I like lists, so let's do that.

Pros: 
Winnie is awesome and responsive. No trouble communicating.

Area is awesome (Capitol Hill). 10-15 minute walk to great stuff, and right near a trader joes/grocery co-op. Tons of buses within 3 block radius too (was 20 minutes to University District and about 20 to downtown/pikes place).

Bed was comfortable for my girlfriend and myself. 

Neighborhood appears safe, not really sure. Felt mostly comfortable walking back at night.

Cons:

Her pictures make the place look brighter and larger than it actually is. It's totally fine in real life, but Winnie obviously has some practice with pretty pictures.

Bathroom ceiling, as mentioned, is slanted, and can pose super slight inconveniences to the tall. I'm 6'1'' and, while I had to bend my head a few times, it wasn't really an issue. Shower was fine for my height. 

Overall: Would recommend. Location rocks. "
789966,5736121,2013-07-14,1421455,Gina,"l enjoyed my stay at Winnie's cosy andd roomy 1 bedroom apartment in a convenient location to capitol  hill, the university and downtown= with bus right out the door.
It was comfortable, big kitchen, light, comfy double bed and sofa and good shower.
l found it good value and easy to communicate with the host before and during my stay."
789966,6660336,2013-08-20,2384718,Sara,"Our stay at Winnie's apartment was amazing! The location was ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. We were able to walk to Capitol Hill and Downtown. We rode the bus to Fremont and Ballard with ease. The bus stops we needed were within one block of the apartment. We were able to snag some great fruit and grocery items from the Capitol Hill ""Central Coop"", located just a few blocks away. Winnie was a very gracious host, who allowed us to finish off her blackberries she purchased at the farmers market, just before our arrival. She informed us of helpful apps, which made commuting across the city extremely easy. She also provided us with many suggestions of destinations and activities within the city not privy to ""tourists."" Three must-do's in Seattle: Pike Street Fish Fry (Capitol Hill), Fremont Artisans Market (Sundays) and the Ballard Farmers Market (Sundays). We fell in love with Seattle and Winnie's apartment. Casey and I can't wait for a return trip! 
Thank you for everything Winnie! 
p.s.-don't forget to water your plants! ;)"
789966,6904823,2013-08-29,737671,Callie,"I loved Winnie's place. After being on the road for a while and getting to (email hidden)is apartment was a little oasis. Winnie was super friendly and helpful with anything we needed. I felt very comfortable and welcome in her home. It was very close to Cap hill entertainment but also far enough to provide for great rest. Overall great stay, and I would highly recommend anyone  to choose this apartment for you trip to Seattle."

She gave us a lot of tips and where to go, she even left us travel leaflets on the table. Too bad we didn't get to see her but everything went smoothly. Her place is really nice, homey and clean and in a nice and quiet neighborhood. Highly recommended :)"
789966,7221877,2013-09-11,7765031,Chii Yu,"Awesome place, especially for 2 people who don't want to share a room and/or bed.  It is two blocks away from 3 different major bus routes that take you almost anywhere you need to be in Seattle. It is one bus line away from the light rail that takes you to the airport.

The place was clean and easy to find with everything you'd need for a short stay. The host left good instructions, plenty of towels, sheets and blankets.  This was my first airbnb experience, and if this is the norm, i know where to turn to first in future destinations.

"
789966,7417587,2013-09-19,1819314,Jody,Winnie's place is immaculate and comfortable--just what we needed in the neighborhood where we needed to be. She was easy to work with when arranging to add a night. Thanks!
789966,7496455,2013-09-22,8190326,Lucille,"Cute place! This is appears to be where Winnie lives most of the time, but occasionally vacated for the airbnb-er. Better for younger folks as it is near the bars on Capitol Hill. "
789966,8099706,2013-10-15,1544122,Eddie,Cute & cozy place in a great location. Winnie was a great host and gave us a lot of helpful suggestions since this was our first trip to Seattle. We had an awesome time!
789966,8271669,2013-10-22,4131112,Alex,"Winnie was great to work with. In particular, she seemed extremely flexible about the mechanics of arriving and departing. A past guest said the photos were not representative of the apartment, but I thought they actually gave a very accurate sense of the furniture and size (pretty big for a 1BR!). I also really liked how quiet this block was. Parking was very easy, and my understanding is that's not always the case for other Seattle neighborhoods! Would have no problem staying here again."
789966,8579804,2013-11-05,551103,S.,i have rented out my house on airbnb but this was my first time renting a place for myself.  winnie is nice and flexible to deal with.  .  i only met winnie for about 30 seconds but after staying in her place i can tell you she has a positive vibe and you can really feel it when you stay there at her place.  my daughter never met her but after staying there she wants to be her friend lol.  very nice all around.
789966,11067554,2014-03-18,13092650,Victoria,"Winnie was a total pleasure to work with. As a newbie to Airbnb, I was slightly nervous about picking the right place for a rather impromptu vacation I planned at the last minute. Not only did Winnie respond to my inquiry within a matter of hours, she also worked with me to make sure I could take care of key pick-up without any issues. Her home is cute, light, airy, and clean. 

Do be mindful of the bathroom ceiling though! I am only 5'3"" and had to be careful a couple of times, but otherwise, there's no surprises here! Her home is also in the neighbourhood I used to live in, which is very convenient to walk around and a quick hop on a bus to downtown!"
789966,11202185,2014-03-24,504318,Brett,"Winnie was an absolutely fabulous host who was very gracious to meet us in downtown Seattle for the key exchange and had laid out hiking maps and her parks car pass for us in the apartment. Alas, we did not have time for any hiking day trips, but Winnie's location, just east of Capitol Hill in Madison Valley, was perfectly suited for nights out at the bars and clubs and for exploring greater Seattle. Highly recommended. "
789966,11377275,2014-03-31,11342464,Daniela,"We really enjoyed our stay at Winnie's place! It not only was comfortable, and well equipped, but also very well located. We could walk to restaurants and grocery stores, and at the same time get a feeling of a neighborhood in Seattle (outside of the touristy areas). Winnie was very flexible and caring. We would love to come back to her place!"
789966,13417393,2014-05-27,6406230,Kristin,"Winnie is a fantastic host! I can't imagine a better experience. Her place is beautiful, clean, and in a great location. The neighborhood is safe and has plenty to offer. I found a great brunch spot, movie theater, and a coffee place within a few blocks. The kitchen is well stocked which came in handy when I decided to make dinner during my stay. There are plenty of informative travel brochures on the coffee table and a transit map that I found very helpful. 

Winnie herself goes above and beyond throughout the entire process. She was very quick to confirm my reservation and stayed in contact throughout my stay. She even stopped by to drop off some bandaids when I couldn't find any. This was my first experience with airbnb but Winnie put me completely at ease. I would love to stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone visiting the area."
789966,13712791,2014-06-02,5777997,Alexis,"Winnie has a truly lovely apartment that was bright and homey, very clean, and in an ideal location ... safe, cute, and quiet neighborhood walking distance from many of Seattle's great restaurants, shops, and parks.  My sister and I stayed here for the weekend and could not have found a more perfect place to feel at home.

From Day 1 Winnie was a fabulous host ... she responded immediately to my initial inquiry and provided a ton of amazing recommendations for restaurants and places to visit as well as information about Seattle, transportation, etc.

I truly cannot say enough wonderful things about Winnie and her apartment. HIGHLY recommend staying here if you visit Seattle!"
789966,15190802,2014-07-04,16827702,Sweta,"Winnie was an excellent hostess, even though we never got to actually meet.  She communicated everything clearly regarding checking in and out, and was helpful with suggesting things to do around the area!  (Thanks for suggesting checking out the lake!)  And, her place is adorable!  I would definitely recommend this place to those looking for a comfortable and pleasant Seattle experience!

Thanks, Winnie!"
789966,15341461,2014-07-07,4337651,Joshua,"Winnie made my trip completely stress-free. The apartment was spacious, clean, and comfortable. The location was great - We were within walking distance of a few places we wanted to eat, and the Uber price to other parts of town was totally affordable. I really appreciate Winnie's flexible check-in/out times.

This made for an awesome stay in Seattle, and I'd highly recommend it!"
789966,15709267,2014-07-14,17223019,Oscar,"Winnie, our host was very accommodating and super helpful. She even provided us a great list of places to eat, but unfortunately our stay was too short to check them out.

As for the location and description of the place, it's very accurate and we came in without any nasty surprises about the space. The neighborhood was also close enough to a Trader Joe's and Safeway which made getting supplies every easy. She's also right next to a major bus stop, so public transit was also a snap.

She was also extremely flexible on our check in and out times and had a very nice stay at her location."
789966,15995412,2014-07-19,1931035,Brittany (& Tim Too),The reservation was canceled 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
789966,16096513,2014-07-22,16425011,Jehn,Winnie was an amazing host and we so enjoyed our stay!  Highly recommended!!!
789966,16285904,2014-07-24,1643458,Ivan,The reservation was canceled 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
789966,17370168,2014-08-11,11028246,Joanna,"The neighborhood is semi-quiet and seemed very safe. The apartment location was on the corner of a busy street juncture, so a bit loud with car traffic, but if you don't mind the noise, it should be ok. The first night was difficult to sleep with all of this. Winnie was not around to meet up with us, so left the key and also sent me a good email of top things to do, which was helpful!"
789966,17951446,2014-08-19,13566838,Liz,"I cannot say enough good things about my time at Seattle thanks to this Airbnb find!

From our first interaction, Winnie was so kind and helpful-- routinely going out of her way to help make sure my transition into and out of her adorable abode was seamless while also providing some fantastic recommendations for making the most of my trip. While I had been to Seattle a few times, her abundant suggestions for hikes in the area, and restaurants to try made me fall in love with the city all over again. 

The photos provided simply don't do this apt justice-- it's huge and was much more space than I needed. For those who cook, the kitchen is stocked with everything you could possibly need, and I was appreciative of the many quaint touches that made this place feel like home. 

Take note that Winnie's caution around the traffic noise near the bedroom was accurate, granted coming from NYC I barely noticed and really didn't mind at all. 

All in all, would absolutely return! Thanks again, Winnie!"
789966,18448226,2014-08-26,9124552,Lissa,"Winnie's apartment was awesome! It looks exactly like the pictures. Winnie was very kind and helpful and even messaged us to ask how our stay was. She is an awesome host. The apartment was in a great location! If you have a car, it is easier to get around.

Just a warning for tall people- the shower has very low ceiling and is slanted, so it's a bit hard to move around. Otherwise, everything was great!"
789966,19842312,2014-09-19,7097838,Nicole,"We had an excellent time staying in Winnie's cute 1 bedroom apartment in Madison Valley! Winnie is extremely helpful, personable, friendly, and organized. When I mentioned  that we were interested in going on some hikes in the area, she sent me a big list of some hikes that we might want to do as well as another list of things to see in the area. I was shocked at how helpful she was before meeting us!

The sweetest thing, however, was the little gift basket she left us! In addition to some snacks for our hiking adventures (including cheese, crackers, bars, etc.), she also left some delicious ice cream and wine for a night in! 

In terms of the actual apartment, it was wonderful. The location is safe and close to a lot of great places (within walking distance of Capitol Hill and about 45 minutes to walk to downtown). The apartment is cozy and clean. 

I can't say enough about how much I loved staying in this apartment and interacting with Winnie. I highly recommend staying here! "
789966,19996453,2014-09-21,7948410,David,I can't say enough nice things about Winnie and her lovely place.  We were running late and unable to meet at our originally planned time but Winnie was able to make arrangements for us to get into the place with ease.  Her place was in a great neighborhood with plenty of watering holes for night time fun.  I would certainly recommend her place to anyone traveling into Seattle.  I could see myself trying to snag this spot for every Seahawks game we come down to.  Thanks again. 
789966,21260406,2014-10-13,3324488,Nicole,"This was a return visit to Winnie's apartment. I had such a good experience the first time, I had to return. It's a beautifully cute apartment with a good layout. The location is great if you want to be near to everything but away from the noise of bars and bar goers. There's always a spot to park your car nearby for free which is a major plus! Capitol Hill is a super tricky place for parking if you've been to Seattle before- you'll know what I'm talking about!

Winnie is awesome! She is quick to respond and extremely accommodating. She provided us with a list of all her favourite spots to visit in the many different neighbourhoods of Seattle. We managed to visit quite a few of them and discovered Winnie has the same great taste as us :)

Thanks again Winnie! We'd be happy to point you towards all the good spots when you visit Vancouver BC / Cape Town South Africa / Ireland"
789966,22682675,2014-11-11,6704930,Jody,We found the location to be great! It was easy to get downtown to Pike Market and over to the Ballard district. Winnie also gave us an amazing list of recommendations of where to eat and places to go!
789966,24782290,2015-01-02,24916013,Adriana,Just as advertised :).  Really spacious with all the amenities needed.  My daughter and I felt right at home and enjoyed every night spent there. It was very easy to get to all locations from Winnie's place.    My daughter enjoyed a couple of nights cozying up in the living room enjoying movies on Netflix.  Thanks Winnie for opening up your cute home!!! 
789966,28285845,2015-03-21,12127225,Catherine,"Winnie's place is a very cute and is an inspirational 1 bedroom.  Unfortunately my boyfriend and I only spent one night there, before we drove down to Portland. Winnie was extremely flexible and accommodating  by letting us store our luggage at her work for the day while we walked around downtown Seattle.  Thank You for the great stay."
789966,28747206,2015-03-29,15444882,Sherri,"Winnie and I had great communication pre-arrival.  Her place is simple, clean and private.  I would stay there again."
789966,29186952,2015-04-05,28572332,Mathew,Winnie was a super gracious and kind host. She was very flexible with the key drop off and made us feel very welcome with a bottle of wine and Beecher's cheese. Her place was clean and the perfect distance from the rest of the city. Parking was easy and best of all free! 
789966,29700670,2015-04-11,589119,Raphael,Winnie's place is definitely CUTE! But it wasn't small! The apartment is very spacious and clean and parking was always a breeze. Theres a Safeway and a Trader Joe's very close to the apartment which made it more convenient. It is also very accessible to the rest of the city. 
789966,30265080,2015-04-19,8619642,Adrian,"Winnie had everything ready for us. The place is really nice and cozy, perfect for a weekend in this beautiful city. There are really good bars and restaurants nearby. Totally recommended :)"
789966,30815739,2015-04-27,8676265,Daphne & Sevana,Winnie's darling apartment was the perfect location for a visit with nearby family. Instructions were clear and communication was great. The bed was so comfy and the black out curtains were a nice option as the bedroom is flooded with great light. We really enjoyed our short stay!
789966,31222582,2015-05-03,3285473,Briana,"We had such a lovely time at Winnie's home. It was our 5th anniversary and she so thoughtfully left us a bottle of wine to celebrate. We brought along our 1 year old so after we put her to sleep my husband and I were able to light some candles, sit back and enjoy the evening. her home was clean and tidy. Checking in and out was very simple and we felt very comfortable for our entire stay. I would definitely recommend her and utilize her home again when visiting Seattle."
789966,31829266,2015-05-10,31935425,Nora,"We had a great time staying with Winnie! The apartment is cute, clean, spacious, and centrally located! Although we weren't able to meet in person, Winnie was easy to communicate with and incredibly gracious. We felt right at home!"
789966,33297249,2015-05-26,15435229,Leina,"We had a great time at Winnie's place. It was centrally located to most everything and even though we had a car (easy street parking), we were also only about a $8 uber ride to downtown. Winnie was a lifesaver when I forgot my phone at her place during checkout and answered within 5 min of me freaking out saying she had another spare key we could pick up from her at work. "
789966,34473990,2015-06-08,21652569,Mi Che Lle,Nice place to stay. The host Winnie is so sweet. 
789966,34976608,2015-06-14,12095075,Sheila,"Winnie was such an excellent host to us during our stay. We were only in town for a few days, but she went out of her way to make sure our coming and going was as easy as possible for us. She is a great communicator and her suggestions for where to go and how to get around are spot on. Her place is very clean, cozy, and happy - the shower is small, as she notes, but we managed just fine. Capitol Hill is about a 15 minute walk away, which was convenient for us. We only wish we could have stayed longer! "
789966,35699123,2015-06-21,7001095,Rick,"We loved our stay at Winnie's immaculately clean, charming and comfortable apartment. Winnie was responsive and friendly. We loved the welcome gift and note she left for us! Highly recommended."
789966,36407099,2015-06-28,16138367,Erin,"Winnie was a great host and I felt so at home in her lovely, spacious apartment.  The space was clean and comfortable and the neighborhood offered everything I could possibly want, within walking distance.  Winnie was easy to communicate with.  She met me at the apartment to welcome me and show me around, and made sure I had a local contact in case I needed anything while Winnie was out of town for the weekend.  This location was perfect for the business I had in Seattle and I really hope to stay at Winnie's again!"
789966,37344724,2015-07-06,19359456,Sean,"Before arriving, Winnie provided a lot of communication and was very accommodating, answering any and all question I had in a timely manner. The day I got in, Winnie was out of town but insured that I received the key when I arrived and there were no issues.

The location was really good for my needs and the space was adequate and comfortable. The parking space was not available while I was visiting but there is an abundance of street parking right outside and that was no issue at all.

Only minor complaints were the small bathroom (I hit my head at least half a dozen times on the slanted ceiling) and that it was a very HOT weekend to not have AC (then again no one really has AC in Seattle).  I used the fan provided by Winnie and it was bearable in the evenings. There's not a lot that could have been done regarding those issues and Winnie did a great job of making me feel welcome. 

I would recommend this location to others if the location works for you."
789966,37775507,2015-07-10,35909998,Maria,Winnie was an amazing host during our two-day stay in Seattle. She was easy to coordinate with prior to arrival and had great recommendations for sightseeing the Seattle area. The apartment was comfortable and so well decorated. It was a hot week but the apartment was easy to keep cool by opening the windows and using the mini fan Winnie kindly left.  We really enjoyed our time in Seattle!
789966,38769418,2015-07-18,5041545,Stephanie,"My stay at Winnie's little home in Seattle was great! She was always quick to respond, and accommodating when my travel plans changed unexpectedly.
Her place was cute, clean, and perfectly located for my mini adventures to the University of Washington Arboretum and Bakery Nouveau. It was nice to see a different side of Seattle, and Winnie's place offered the perfect alternative to the typical touristy experience. "
789966,39469787,2015-07-23,10720238,Aj,"Winnie's place (and Winnie herself) are amazing! First off, her place is in a great neighborhood with parking and great restaurants and a Trader Joe's just a short walk away. With a great deal of natural light, a small outside sitting area and large rooms, the apartment is really great. 

The two of us had more than enough space to really relax and feel at home. We weren't stepping over each other or our luggage at all--it's a wonderful size for two people. 

Winnie herself met us at the start of our stay to give us a short tour of the place and to point us in the right direction for more information. She obviously knows a lot about Seattle and the neighborhoods. 

This is a great location and place to stay!"
789966,39779446,2015-07-26,35512548,Abby,Winnie was such a great host! It was my first experience with airbnb and it won't be my last! She was super helpful with finding things for me to do while I was in town and very easy to get in contact with. Would definitely recommend this to anyone!
789966,48619926,2015-09-27,32241683,Amanda,"Winnie did a fantastic job of being a welcoming and hospitable host. I was arriving in Seattle late but Winnie was very accommodating. Her place was very clean, well organized and well stocked with things like toiletries, basic necessities and kitchen utensils. Winnie also gave us information about some of our destinations and other useful tidbits like parking and vendors to check out at Pike Place Market. It's also in a great area with lots of places to eat and grab a coffee. There's also a Trader Joe's in the area too. Highly recommended! "
8443258,51471816,2015-10-20,24011803,Paul,"Trang is helpful, flexible and did everything to provide a good stay. The flat is well placed : close to the university, Capitol hills and its bars. It's 30 min by walk of downtown and its shops. Beds are big and really comfortable. The flat was clean and with lot of room. I had a great stay in her flat ! Thanks for the stay!"
8443258,53372537,2015-11-08,45957295,Guannan,"It felt like home! Very clean and comfy. Everything works perfectly!
Trang is very nice and friendly. We had a wonderful time!"
8443258,54046546,2015-11-15,2334069,Ammar,"We had an excellent stay at Trang's place. The apartment was very quaint, the rooms and bathrooms were clean, and the beds were incredibly comfortable. Trang was available if we had questions and friendly, though we didn't see her much as we were out and about during most of our stay. She also recommended great restaurants in the area. The apartment is in a nice part of town with shops and cafés nearby. :)"
8443258,54686655,2015-11-22,19862185,Charlotte,Convenient comfortable space near downtown. Trang was very helpful and accommodating. Great and quick communication before and after our stay. We had to get a friends passport delivered before our trip to BC and she helped with the office and checking on it. I would stay again. 
1950012,17920922,2014-08-18,8837067,Faye,We booked Joe's room at the last minute. He had just listed the space and we were his first guests. He got back to me quick and even though I had a hard time with the booking process because of computer issues he was patient and understanding . The room was perfect! The home was inviting and everything worked out perfect! The home is within walking distance to coffee shops and all of the great art that Georgetown has to offer. 
1950012,18153963,2014-08-22,11872640,Neil,"Joe's place really lived up to its billing as a ""artists retreat "". As a sculptor, I could really appreciate his home nestled in a very interesting enclave of Seattle, known as Georgetown. It's a residential area which is surrounded by light industries, so the buildings are a mix of renovated old warehouses with excellent eateries, restaurants and cool shops. Very bohemian! Joe's house has a lot of charm, with lovely gardens with fruit trees and bamboo and the room and the bed were both very comfortable. He's located just south of the downtown core of Seattle and even closer to Seattle airport. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a down-to-earth experience, free of the splash of sterile condos!"
1950012,18752676,2014-08-31,444903,Gene,"The listing was very accurate as far as I could tell.  I had a unique situation where I wanted to put my parents up in a room while they visited Seattle, so they were the actual ones staying here.  Joe greeted us with a tour of the house, the room, and basic amenities.  As far as I could tell, all the basic necessities were accessible.

Joe was communicative as far as expectations and what he could provide.  "
1950012,18908986,2014-09-02,19386125,Brian,"The house was great, being nestled in a lush yard in the quaint Seattle district of George Town. George Town had a few good coffee shops and restaurants, including All City Coffee, Via Tribunali, and Hangar Cafe. Additionally, places like Beacon Hill and downtown are nearby. Joe's roommate, Greg, hosted the place while we were there. He was very friendly, yet non-intrusive. Overall, the experience was relaxing and enjoyable."
1950012,18973830,2014-09-03,1998805,Mark,"There is an air of mystery about Joe, but none about the entirely pleasant accommodations he provides at a very reasonable rate. Highly recommended."
1950012,19225061,2014-09-08,20324782,Jaime,The house is great and the host was very accommodating. Thanks so much!
1950012,19620655,2014-09-15,14601162,Bojana,"I had a lovely stay at the Artists' Retreat. I didn't get to meet Joe, but his roommate Greg was there to help out and answer questions, and he even gave me a ride to the city. The house is charming and immaculate, and set on a quiet tree-lined block. The room and bathroom were spacious and clean. The neighborhood (Georgetown) may not be close to downtown Seattle, but I didn't have any trouble getting around by bus--there are three different bus lines nearby. I'd definitely recommend staying here. "
1950012,19715444,2014-09-16,1007813,Trish,"I was only at the artists' retreat for about 7 hours total (to sleep), and I wish I could have stayed longer. It was perfect for what I needed. Joe wasn't there, but I met his roommate Greg and he was really friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay there again on my next trip to Seattle."
1950012,19757975,2014-09-17,20998967,Kohei,当日は、オーナーのジョーさんが旅行に行かれていたので、代わりに彼の友人のグレッグさんが部屋の説明などをしてくれました。とてもフランクで親切な方でした。翌日の朝には色んな話をして、そのあとには近くのおもしろい公園に連れて行ってくれました。
1950012,20110119,2014-09-23,20936524,Phill,Awesome house in a fun neighborhood with great bars and resteraunts a short stroll from the house. Public transportation and getting downtown and to pike place was simple. Definetly recommend. 
1950012,20255345,2014-09-26,11350986,Meagan,"The space was lovely, very cozy and clean, and in a cool neighbourhood! Joe and his roommate were great and very accommodating hosts. "
1950012,20680242,2014-10-03,4714519,Caro,"Joe and Greg were wonderful hosts. The house is charming and clean, and it was a short walk to the Georgetown restaurants and bars. A pear tree in the front yard provided the fruit for pies that Joe made to share. Good conversations and an inspirational setting. Great for writers and artists or anyone who wants a more personal experience."
1950012,20731740,2014-10-04,12227598,Benjamin,"Fantastic stay! Cozy house and great neighborhood (by the way, Fran's Chocolates just opened a factory blocks away). Joe was a great host - he had many recommendations for things to check out around town and how to get around using public transit."
1950012,20840411,2014-10-06,20994863,Tiffany,"Joe and Greg were great hosts and very accommodating. The room, bathroom, and shared spaces were fantastic. The house was also within walking distance to all of the Georgetown amenities and super easy to find/get to from I-5."
1950012,21059369,2014-10-10,4714519,Caro,"I had a wonderful second stay with Joe and Greg. It was the perfect place to help me transition while I looked for an apartment in Seattle. I'll miss the neighborhood, but I look forward to visits and more good conversation. "
1950012,21639307,2014-10-20,22551359,Hao,"Awesome experience. Joe and Greg gave so many suggestions, that really made my trip more than fun. House was really good, tidy and clean. Cuz it was raining every night, I didn't get a chance to enjoy the lovely yard. 
Mi viaje a Seattle fue súper estupendo con muchas propuestas dadas por Greg y Joe. Su casa estaba limpia y de orden con un patio muy mono.
房间没有什么好挑剔的，设施齐全独卧独卫，庭院漂亮可惜每晚下雨地很湿就没利用上。整个屋子艺术气息很浓。房主给了我很多建议，提供了不少去处和当地人才知道的名吃，让我的行程非常丰富。其实我想说比较起来太空针塔真的没什么意思还是省点钱做点其他的好了。"
1950012,22076850,2014-10-29,21987823,David,"Joe and Greg were great hosts, very informative and their space was awesome. It's a very cozy house in the heart of Georgetown, with some great restaurants and such nearby which was great! I will definitely be recommending Joe and Greg to friends in the future!"
1950012,23315979,2014-11-28,24133352,Melissa,"Short stay in the Artist's Retreat was just what I needed. Joe communicated well beforehand about what time we would meet at the house via text. Joe's roommate made it possible for me to arrive when I needed to, gave me a tour and a key. I came and went for the rest of the evening and morning in privacy. Accommodations and neighborhood were as described and a great price for experience. Free Wifi, a typed list of guidelines and a map of the neighborhood made my stay even better. "
1950012,23416990,2014-11-30,24202650,Maia,Joe and Greg were very welcoming. The house was a short walk away from Airport Way where a lot of great shops are located. A private bathroom is located right next to the guest's room. It was a short stay but very enjoyable. A sweet surprise was the pumpkin pie that was offered in the morning. Would definitely stay there again.
1950012,23565673,2014-12-04,3508880,Hari,"Joe has a unique and lovely home and it was a real pleasure to be there - as brief as my stay was... I live in Portland but was in Seattle only for a concert and I needed a sweet and safe place to sleep over before trekking hem in the AM.  Joe was extremely accommodating given the unexpectedly late midnight ending to the performance and when I arrived we chatted and he shared some warmly baked cornbread with me.   His lush backyard garden is also beautiful, even in the winter ~

The neighborhood of Georgetown cannot be beat for great coffee and breakfast away the stress of downtown.  If you love graphics, comics and vinyl you also have Fantagraphics headquarters there.

I would definitely stay there again, if he'd take me... next time I can assure of no weird hours!"
1950012,25780363,2015-01-25,12420142,William,"Joe was awesome.  He made myself and Mallory feel right at home.  The place was very clean, inviting and relaxing as well as exactly as advertised.  We had a short comfortable walk to the famous Georgetown strip on Airport way and felt very safe at any hour.  I would definitely stay with Joe again and would recommend his place to anyone.  Wonderful first AirBNB Experience!"
1950012,26662719,2015-02-16,9147040,Jennifer,"Very welcoming host, with great recommendations of things to around his neighborhood and the city.  Cozy room and amenities!  Had a great stay."
1950012,28755692,2015-03-29,6198361,Raphaël,"Joe's house is absolutely magical. Filled with great art, exciting books and LPs, and very comfy. Having a whole room for myself overlooking the garden, with private bathroom, felt like absolute luxury. The garden is also totally mind-blowing: a little urban oasis, green and lush, with bamboos, large trees, chirping birds, and mischievous squirrels. Georgetown is a fun little hip enclave to navigate. All city coffee is a great place to chill, and Fantagraphics Bookstore has an amazing selection of comics and LPs! But the best part was meeting with Joe himself: a really thoughtful host, very chill and laid back, incredibly passionate and knowledgeable about literature and the arts. I would love to stay at his place again on my next trip to Seattle!"
1950012,29787010,2015-04-12,8380163,Hyonah,"Joe was out of town when i stayed but was very communciative and the check in was smooth. The house was comfy and the neighborhood is very cute. Happened to be there for the art walk, which was a surprising, wonderful treat!"
1950012,30815781,2015-04-27,1409997,Erica,Joe was a wonderful host and the house is beautiful. Georgetown is a very cool area of Seattle and Joe's house is so close to coffee shops and restaurants. I really enjoyed my stay at this house!
1950012,31247467,2015-05-03,11557360,Rob,"House is right in the heart of GTown. Joe made it really easy to come and go. We felt real comfortable and at home, even though our schedule didn't give us much time to talk with him. The room was comfortable and had it's own bathroom. The grounds are real relaxing. A great retreat! The only downside is that there are no blinds in the bedroom, so the spring/summer sun shines right on the bed at an early hour. But that just means you need to get up and have some coffee!"
1950012,31564652,2015-05-06,3248968,Mary,"My boyfriend and I were feeling spontaneous and decided literally 4 hours before (the time roughly it takes to drive from Portland to Seattle) to reach out toJoe and request to stay just for the night. He got back to me within the hour and was up for having us as guests on such short notice! I'm pretty sure he dropped what he was doing to get the room ready for us during our drive up. Check in was a breeze, and within minutes he schooled us on a brief history of the area with a hand drawn map of some places to see in Georgetown as well as other places throughout Seattle. As for the house/room: if your heart putters for anything vintage (most likely the copper piping in the bathroom is from the year the house was built in 1901) you will dig this dwelling. The walls bleed creativity and if you are a music lover, the common living area could keep you entertained for hours with quirky instruments and records. If we had more than one day to spend there, we would have liked to pick Joe's brain some more about hell, just about anything. A unique, comfortable stay indeed. "
1950012,32073341,2015-05-13,30169012,Evan,"I didn't have a chance to meet Joe, but the room was very comfortable and the house exactly as described.  "
1950012,32300227,2015-05-16,33254955,Hong,"Joe is really nice! Even though he was not in town, he managed to ask his friend to let me and my husband check in. We enjoyed our stay in the house and the neighborhood. We went on nice walk after dinner around the neighborhood. The grocery store and restaurants are within walking distance from the neighborhood. "
1950012,32441464,2015-05-17,8805179,Jennifer,Everything was great. Nice home. Nice guy. Comfortable room. Easy stay. Great location. 
1950012,32656099,2015-05-19,63815,Ruth,"Great old Seattle neighborhood to stay in, very unexpected in this pretty industrialized part of town. Lots of jet noise as you are on the flight path to Boeing Field, but I was not in much, but did sleep with my earplugs."
1950012,33046041,2015-05-24,33783094,Bailey,"Great stay at Joe's! His house is right in the heart of Georgetown, walking distance to restaurants/bars and parks and only a ten minute drive to downtown. Joe was a great host -- he took time to give me a run down of Georgetown and Seattle in general which I really appreciated!"
1950012,33197313,2015-05-25,17723982,Michael,"Joe's place was as described, and he was a great host.  Very friendly and helpful is checking out the area.  Georgetown is an interesting area worth checking out.  The room was clean and was great for me."
1950012,33636067,2015-05-30,34381405,K.Thor,"Really charming, private, quiet room in a lovely house surrounded by greenery. The neighborhood was very post-industrial, with some cool bars and restaurants and easy access to public transportation. I had no trouble finding parking at any time. I would recommend this place to any traveler coming to Seattle."
4581124,27885085,2015-03-14,23918776,Leslie,"Was ok, somewhat"
4581124,28293575,2015-03-21,2685689,Katy,"We enjoyed our stay at Aaron's home. It's a fairly newly renovated home, comfortable and in a safe neighbourhood.  There were many restaurants and grocery stores in the neighbourhood. The house was clean, nicely decorated, and Aaron was very helpful.  He was also very quick to respond even to our last-minute request to book, which was great! "
4581124,28580758,2015-03-26,12715224,Emily,"We stayed at Aaron's for 3 nights. His home is newly renovated, beautifully decorated and very clean. Our private bedroom had a very comfortable bed and a spacious closet. The bathroom is separate but only used by guests (and the shower head is amazing!). We felt very safe in this neighborhood. It was quiet but also very close to lots of great restaurants and shops. We saw Aaron briefly each day (he does work from home and there is some noise associated with that, however this was not bothersome to us at all). Aaron offered us coffee and breakfast in the morning, gave recommendations and even offered us a coupon for dining out in downtown Seattle. He is a kind and outgoing host. We would definitely stay here again."
4581124,28742221,2015-03-29,29133796,Sheila,"Just as described. Clean, friendly host, nice to have your own bathroom and there are basically 2 separate living rooms of you want that as well.   perfect location in my opinion as it's quiet and has ample parking but isn't too far from things you may want to do. Pretty short drive to the Ballard locks which is also really close to Cafe Besalu-best croissants ever! Would stay again. Thank you Aaron!"
4581124,28975212,2015-04-01,21120005,Tianming,Aaron is very kindness and enthusiastic to people. We are very confortable live there. He is a very good person.
4581124,31131554,2015-05-02,31338741,Diana,Aaron made me feel very welcome when I arrived late in the evening.  We spent a good time talking about Seattle and the places. I had seen. We really didn't see much of each other as I was only there two days. The room was comfortable and clean.  Aaron owns a very nice home that was easy to find and enjoyable to stay with.
4581124,32248123,2015-05-16,7788758,Zhao,"i really enjoyed my stay in Aaron's house. Aaron likes travelling, he has been to a lot of countries. sometimes he asks me if i need something, this makes me feel warm. 
the house is just as beautiful as the pictures. it's relatively a separate one. Aaron lives in other rooms. we even don't share a door. so we don't bother each other. the room is clean and comfortable. and you can take rapid D to the downtown, very convienient."
4581124,33727375,2015-05-31,31890166,Jake,"Aaron was a great host, he's a very kind person and you can tell he doesn't do airbnb for the money. We ran into a couple issues but they were quickly resolved. Would be happy to stay with him again sometime."
4581124,35414792,2015-06-18,16591199,Jae,"Aaron was an awesome host. He warmly greeted me even though my flight was delayed several hours and arrived at his place at around 2am. The room, bed, and bathroom were clean. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone who wants to stay in a safe, quiet neighborhood in a nice cozy room. "
4581124,36573312,2015-06-29,34906121,Minhua,"It is a great experience living in Arron's House. Arron is a awesome host, trying his best to make me feel like home. His house locates at a quiet neighborhood and is not too far from everything: Bus ( D line, route 40), northgate shopping mall and the bay. "
4581124,40608181,2015-08-01,2917058,Maxwell,"Aaron was a great host to us for two weeks.  He really makes you feel at home and let's you have your own space.  The house is comfortable, quiet, and in a very nice neighborhood close to the sound, parks, and shopping and restaurants.  We couldn't have asked for a better stay for the beginning of our journey in Seattle.  Thanks Aaron!"
4581124,41741740,2015-08-09,17382693,Alex,"The residence was clean and comfortable. 

Aaron was a great host who went out of his way to make us feel at home. Unfortunately, the event I was attending ran super late most nights, so I didn't get much of a chance to chat. Nonetheless, we had no issues and would love to book with him again."
4581124,42417760,2015-08-13,33053816,Hélène,"Aaron possède une charmante maison à proximité du centre de Seattle. Nous avons été très bien accueilli par sa fille et lui-même. La chambre et la salle de bain est à la hauteur de l'annonce présentée, je vous recommande donc cette chambre sans hésitation. Aaron a eu la gentillesse de nous prêter un pass qui nous a permis de dîner dans le Space Needle tout en bénéficiant de 50% de réduction sur l'addition :-)
Un GRAND merci à lui pour cette magnifique soirée qui restera dans nos mémoires ! "
4581124,43518992,2015-08-20,27711665,Katharina,"The house was exactly as described. It was clean, with a comfortable bed and all the amenities. The neighbourhood was quiet and located near some great resturants and grocery stores. While we did not take transit Aaron is located near the main access roads to downtown and the waterfront which made it very easy for us to get around with a car. We were only able to meet Aaron for a few moments but he struck ua as a friendly individual."
4581124,45723337,2015-09-05,42302855,Francisco,"First time here in Seattle, couldn't choose a better place to stay :) Aaron is such a really nice host. The house was great, really clean, and going to Downtown was so easy, I can take bus D-Line which is also passing every 10 min (weekdays). He gave the space to feel confortable, bathroom was great next to my bedroom, he helped me alot during my stay, great place to stay."
4581124,46156355,2015-09-08,39928613,Franziska,Aaron is a very good host. He is a traveler like the most of us so you will feel like home soon. His house is really quiet but close to the center of the city. We thank our host for this wonderful stay. 
4581124,47868443,2015-09-21,41158892,Paige,"Aaron was a great, easygoing host. The room I stayed in was comfy and quiet, perfect after a somewhat hectic weekend. Would recommend!"
4825472,34661658,2015-06-10,33911306,Tracy,"Our host Nora was very friendly and knowledgeable about the area. She made us feel very comfortable and at home.  The room was clean and suited us nicely.  The location was great.  We were close enough to everything and had no parking problems like we did in the city.  Nora had shared with us some tips rare finds in the city that only a local would know.  Great trip, thanks for your hospitality.  "
4825472,39407365,2015-07-23,17943277,Rosie,Staying at Nora's was wonderful! She was flexible with our arrival and provided us with lots of information about Seattle and her neighborhood. She gave us advice on bus lines and showed us schedules. The room was lovely and clean. The neighborhood is great. We loved staying here!
4825472,40244882,2015-07-29,34197874,Anne,Enjoyed my stay here and the cute retro styled room.  Nora is friendly and generous with her home.  The room is quiet and neat with convenient location to fun shops and restaurants in Ballard!
4825472,40856330,2015-08-02,24912311,Lauren,Nora was very welcoming and friendly. Her house is tidy and inviting. We had a great stay!
4825472,42159603,2015-08-11,37333147,Shiwei,"Pros:
- Nora was a wonderful host! She was very welcoming and helpful, even giving me a little tour of downtown Ballard! It was also very easy to schedule arrival/departure times with her.
- There's a bit of painting/construction in the living room, but the room I stayed in was nice and cozy. 
- The location is pretty convenient, with a close bus stop (28) that goes straight to downtown. There are other bus lines nearby, although these lines aren't really suited for walking to and fro if you're carrying luggage.
- The neighborhood felt very safe and tranquil. There wasn't any loud traffic in the middle of the night to disrupt my sleep.

Cons:
- The only thing that bugged me was the lack of internet access. Yeah it's in the description, but I overlooked it -_- It's okay if you're content with surfing the net on your smartphone, but it might be unsuitable especially for foreign visitors with expensive/restricted data allowances."
4825472,42773405,2015-08-15,22899951,Greg,"We really enjoyed our stay here; the only downside was the distance to the heart of Seattle. Takes about 4- minutes on the bus to get to downtown. The place itself is a very comfortable, well furnished house. The room is especially lovely with pretty old furniture -  extremely comfy memory foam pillows were a nice touch. The bed is a little bit shorter than most, which would only really be a  consideration if you're 6ft or over. Seems like a very safe area, pleasant tree lined suburban street, peaceful and quiet. Nora herself was a kind and helpful host, she gave us some good reccomendations for cheap drinks and neighborhoods to visit, very happy for a chat and very welcoming. This is a nice place to stay if you're visiting Seattle.
"
4825472,43275153,2015-08-18,35423301,Michael,"Nora was an amazing host, a very nice person, and a fascinating Seattle native. 

We loved staying at her place. It has a very comfy bed (lots of extra blankets for us non-acclimated people from Hawaii), and it's such a cool house which is located in a very convenient location. Nora has created an Oasis in Seattle for herself, I'm so glad we got the opportunity to share it with her.

Oh, and just forget about Google, Nora has everything you need to know about Seattle. 

It was our pleasure staying there.

4825472,44183250,2015-08-24,6957322,Michaele,"Great for what we needed! A place to lay our weary heads between busy days. We rented a car, so it was easy for us to get around. Nora was very nice and helpful!"
4825472,44862940,2015-08-29,38675377,Corey-Dean,"Nora was a very hospitable host! Her home was welcoming and cozy. I especially enjoyed staying with her, listening to a few of her stories, and advice on where to roam about in Seattle. "

4825472,50513380,2015-10-12,5741939,David,"Nora was welcoming and gracious!  She was generous with her house and kitchen, and had a trove of stories to share from her long history in Seattle.  Her house is super lived-in, and littered with collections of upcycled items.

Unfortunately, she is also self-employed and juggling countless responsibilities; in 2 weeks I only got to talk to her a handful of times."
4825472,51795980,2015-10-24,36180576,Megan,Nora was very nice and has a wonderful home. She even offered to send me my T-shirt after I left it in the room. Thanks Nora! 
4825472,55584353,2015-12-02,21236499,Ray,It was a very chill time in Nora's guest room!
7249631,39548568,2015-07-24,12560705,Daniel,"Katrina's place was absolutely incredible. Great kitchen, super cozy, great views. It felt very private and secure.

I loved relaxing and taking in the rooftop view, which has a great vantage of the space needle. 

The location is great / its easy to get to, and get around. The little italian bakery downstairs, and the whole foods across the street left me feeling spoiled.

Katrina is a lovely host who provided a warm welcome and a very easy & flexible checkin / check out process. She made great recommendations for exploring the neighborhood. Wish I could have stayed longer.

Would highly recommend!"
7249631,39835268,2015-07-26,5853353,Mikal,"
I loved everything about my stay. It was in a great location. Walking distance to everything Seattle has to offer. The apartment was impeccable. I travel to Seattle often and would stay here again."
7249631,40282608,2015-07-29,2619526,Carrie,"Katrina met us at the apartment and very kindly let us in and showed us around.  The apartment was exactly as described.

I will definitely stay here again!"
7249631,40497609,2015-07-31,38404189,Kevin,"Our experience was nothing but perfect. Katrina has really put together a wonderful B&B. The apartment is extremely well furnished and we felt right at home. Katrina's team was outstanding. They met us out-front to help get settled and gave great recommendations about the surrounding area. Checkout was a breeze as well. The apartment was incredibly well stocked, quiet, comfortable. Thank you Katrina for the awesome experience! A+ would recommend. "
7249631,40817770,2015-08-02,18572405,Win,"Katrina's apartment was our best Airbnb experience. The apartment is well furnished, spacious, very clean and quiet. The bed is big (not sure what Americans would call this - may be a King?) which is what we are used to and the mattress and bed linens are all good quality. The location is also very convenient. Walking distance to Seattle Art Museum, Seattle History Museum, Pike Place Market and shopping district. Wholefoods is also nearby. Katrina met us when we arrived at the apartment, check in was smooth and her recommendations of restaurant were good. We requested a late check out at 6:00 p.m. and she agreed to it without extra charges. We highly recommend Katrina's place and will definitely stay there again. "
7249631,42441973,2015-08-13,6490517,Jane,"Yes, the host was really attentive and responsive and the unit was exactly as advertised. The apartment is super nice and new with a nice and quite view. The building is located so conveniently to great food and walking distance to the needle and the market. I highly recommend staying here for a comfortable seattle trip with a great location. There's even a zipcar lot across the street and it's perfect to hop in one and zip over to fremont or ballard."
7249631,43086939,2015-08-17,38305730,Jason,"This was my first time using Airbnb and it was an amazing experience! Katrina was amazing at her response time, and was very helpful any time that I needed her. She told me some things to do, and even showed me her favorite coffee place! The place itself was perfect for my needs. Bigger than I was expecting, the apartment is located in a wonderful position- walking distance to many attractions.  "
7249631,43437203,2015-08-19,1157170,Esther,"Awesomely walkable location, easy, clear, and very responsive communication with Katrina. Unit looks just like the pictures! We'd totally stay again. Thanks!"
7249631,44355137,2015-08-25,4254997,Tanya,"Katrina's apartment was wonderful. Very clean, spacious, quiet and close to everything.  There is a Whole Foods and a great bakery conveniently located downstairs. I was able to get a load of laundry done in the apartment as well, which was super convenient.  

Katrina also left a bottle of red wine and checked in on me to make sure everything was good. She was also flexible on my check out time which I really appreciates since I needed to get in a few work calls. 

I highly recommend this air bnb!

7249631,48896290,2015-09-29,41648317,Karen,"We were met by the host in a timely manner. The apartment was new and modern, a bit dusty and there were no drawers to put clothes in from our luggage(we were there for 3 nights).
The neighborhood was a good location and convenient to public transportation and restaurants, food stores, and tourist sites to visit."

7249631,57655894,2015-12-28,47905238,Margaret,"We arrived to find our accommodations even nicer than the photos had depicted.  The apartment was spacious, spotlessly clean and well appointed.  Katya had even left us a bottle of wine with the keys.  The apartment was very conveniently located to downtown Seattle - walking distance to tourist attractions, restaurants, and shopping.  We will definitely stay here again on our next visit."

The place was impeccably clean and well appointed - I would absolutely stay here again when coming back to Seattle. Great location too, just a few minute walk to downtown Seattle."
3639023,35270634,2015-06-16,26378402,Lawrence,"The room is in a nice, new, modern house in a very quiet residential section of Seattle, a bit off the normal beaten track for visitors to the city.  It was about a 20 minute drive to the University District, which was the focus of our visit.  Parking is on the street, and as is the case in much of Seattle, you will need to be able to parallel park.   

Rahul gave us the run of the first floor, including use of the kitchen and his TV/cable system.  Our bedroom and bath were on the second floor, with his bedroom area on another level, so we had privacy.   It should go without saying that everything was clean and functional.

He was very gracious, and often asked if there was anything else that we needed from him. 

This had been a last-minute reservation made the day before we arrived because our original Seattle reservation had fallen through that same day.  Working with the Airbnb customer service people, who told him that we had been left in the lurch, he arranged to move up his cleaning service schedule so the place would be ready for us on this short notice to him.   I am very appreciative of that.  

In summary, this was a calming stay in a pleasant, quiet neighborhood, with a trade-off of travel time to  whatever part of Seattle is the focus of your visit (and presumably needing a car - though I did not look into bus access)."
3639023,38659858,2015-07-17,37846817,Susan,"Rahul was a gracious, welcoming host.  This beautiful house in the Queen Anne neighborhood was close to everything, including Discovery Park which was great for a morning jog.  The room was comfortable, clean, and spacious and we had a private bathroom.  Nice touches included shampoo in the shower and coffee and tea in the kitchen.  Rahul checked in to see if we needed anything and was happy to answer our many questions about the Seattle area in general.  This was our first experience with AirBnB and we will definitely be repeat clients."
3639023,40245160,2015-07-29,18073409,Lynnae,"My first Airbnb experience worked out splendidly.  Rahul was a very good host.  He graciously accommodated our very late check in, and kept in touch to make sure that our needs were met.  Due to our schedules, we did not see much of him, but he was easily accessible by text and very responsive prior to and throughout our stay.  He is very easy going, and made sure that things got done so that we were comfortable.  His place is very clean, tastefully decorated, and the space is very private (on its own floor).  The half bath on the main floor really came in handy when two of us were getting ready at the same time (something that we couldn’t really get at a hotel).  The home is located in a very quiet and safe neighborhood.  The main streets are very well lit at night.  We didn’t have a car, but parking looked okay.  

Having stayed at a hotel closer to downtown during our last stay, we opted for a different experience staying in a home on the outskirts.  The location did not disappoint.  Airport transportation was easy -- we used the Light Rail at the Westlake station, and caught an Uber to/from Rahul’s place.  It was very easy to navigate via public transportation.  The bus stop was a 6 minute walk from the house (we found a shortcut, and prior it only took 10 minutes).  The D line bus easily took us to Ballard or anywhere downtown in a relatively short period of time.  We never waited more than 12 minutes for a bus.  The neighborhood is darling, and we enjoyed exploring by foot.  We were able to walk to Kerry Park, McGraw Street, and Queen Anne Blvd to check things out (~35 min walk, with some inclines).  Melena’s Taco Shop, Molly Moon Ice Cream, and Macrina bakery were some of the nice surprises we found.   We also stumbled upon a few Little Free Libraries, which only added charm to the neighborhood.

Rahul was nice enough to BBQ for us and invited some of his friends.  We enjoyed getting to know him and his friends, and would definitely stay again in the future.  We felt like we made a new friend."
3639023,41788687,2015-08-09,29512562,Ben,"Rahul was very friendly and welcoming.  He was always checking to make sure that we were happy, and offering anything we needed.  He was very helpful with suggestions around Seattle.  He also gave us our privacy, and we never felt like we were being imposed upon.

The room and bathroom were very nice, spacious, and comfortable, with everything we could need.  He also provided access to other amenities within his house for our use.

The house and neighborhood are very beautiful, with a short 5 minute walk to major bus stops to downtown, Fremont, and Ballard easily within 15 minues."
3639023,42767311,2015-08-15,28098332,David,"Rahul was great, very hospitable and communicative.  The room is as advertised, with a good kitchen and living room area. "
3639023,44811662,2015-08-29,13607395,Paul,"Rahul works during the day so he texted us with the code for a lock box with a key in it which would allow us access.  The neighborhood was quiet with easy access to roads into downtown Seattle and various freeways.  The room was clean and well-furnished with a comfortable bed and nice private bath and great shower.  Although we took most meals out, we could have used the kitchen to prepare meals.  We had little contact with our host until the last night.  "
3639023,50597294,2015-10-12,46099445,Rocky,Place was great.  Very clean.  Quiet.  Nice large bathroom and comfortable bed.  Rahul was very friendly and accomodating. 
3639023,51989432,2015-10-25,43011160,Vincent & Amanda,"This is a very nice lodging in a cool and convenient area. Rahul was super hospitable and all communication was great. The whole house was nicely decorated and the bed was super comfortable. The location of the bed and bath is on the 2nd floor which I had to myself, so there was plenty of privacy which is nice. "
6424859,33200323,2015-05-25,22730068,Rod,We stayed with Craig on Capitol Hill for two nights. We were a very late check-in which was no problem for him. He was very welcoming and we felt at home immediately. The unit is quiet and clean. We had our own bathroom which was wonderful. The unit is in a great area and we walked to good restaurants and funky venues. We would stay here again without hesitation.
6424859,33737414,2015-05-31,33162463,Michael,"The room on Capitol Hill was fantastic.  We arrived in the late afternoon and had no problems with entry and were able to easily come and go as we pleased.  The room and bathroom were very neat and clean and perfect for our purposes as we spent most of our time exploring the city.  Craig was very friendly and helpful and offered several recommendations for sights to see, restaurants, etc.  The location was great as it was quiet at night but also close to many shops and restaurants and a walkable distance to downtown, the Needle, Pike's Place.  Overall it was a great experience and we will definitely be using Craig for our next visit to Seattle!"
6424859,35403167,2015-06-18,27497245,Xiaochen,"It's a wonderful place to stay. Craig is so friendly and he gives many excellent advices about transports and restaurants nearby. The house is clean, comfortable and we spend a nice time with each other."
