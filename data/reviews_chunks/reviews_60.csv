4757025,27945040,2015-03-15,28024716,Prabesh,"Ella, thank you very much for your wonderful hospitality. It was my first experience in airbnb and I couldn't have asked for anything more. The place was exactly what it was described, few minutes to all the attraction. Walking distance to nice restaurants. Highly recommended for anyone who is looking for a place in Seattle. "
4757025,28263404,2015-03-21,27852396,Jiahui,Ella is very nice and the home is sweet and clean! She already prepare all daily necessities to us and all needs of kitchen~ we like it very much! it's a good memory in our travel experience!
4757025,28315496,2015-03-22,27434726,Sara,"This apartment is the jackpot if you want to stay close enough to downtown to have a million things to do and far enough away that you don't deal with the noise of the city. The house is private, quiet, beautifully furnished and so comfortable. The entrance is private, away from the rest of the house. It has everything you could want for as little as an overnight stay or as much as a weekly vacation rental.   The hosts are incredibly friendly and welcoming and would stay here again in a heartbeat. "
4757025,28941710,2015-04-01,2607938,Tina,Ella and John were great hosts in this lovely apartment. The location was amazing and was easy to access. The apartment looks exactly like the photos. John showed me around and Ella came down afterwards to check on me. This was my first time to Seattle and being able to stay is such a charming apartment made it relaxing. Thank you Ella and John!! 
4757025,29001632,2015-04-02,17767412,Molly,Five stars all around. This is the model airbnb experience!
4757025,29116425,2015-04-04,17767412,Molly,Ella and Joe and their home is the type of home you want to stay in every time you travel using airbnb. I had a 100% wonderful experience at their place and I'm so looking forward to coming back!
4757025,29304547,2015-04-06,28984836,Jason,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and we were so glad we chose Ella's home!! The location was very convenient. Ella's house was so clean, cozy and her service was so thoughtful, we really felt like home. Thank you very much for your hospitality. You have my 5 star rating! "
4757025,29558329,2015-04-09,25544539,Rob,"I highly recommend this place.  It is clean and very tastefully decorated.  It has 2 queen bedrooms that are nicely separated from each other for privacy...prefect for two couples, or in my case, a family of 4.  We stayed at Ella's place while touring colleges and sight seeing in Seattle.  The location is excellent.  Close enough to downtown, but in a very quiet, residential area.  It is 1-5 minutes from excellent dining, coffee, etc.  If I moved to Seattle, I would strongly consider this neighborhood.

Ella and Joe were excellent hosts.  They made sure we had everything we needed, and made themselves available for any questions.

If my daughter goes to school in Seattle, I will be staying at this place a lot..."
4757025,29768505,2015-04-12,13621579,Pearl,"This home is wonderful, set up perfectly, and is very warm and welcoming.  It also has very sophisticated yet homey decor that adds a feeling of comfort.  The location is great and very close to the downtown area.  Ella is very sweet and welcoming she made sure we had everything we needed to be comfortable.  Thank you Ella!  "
4757025,30209671,2015-04-19,683617,Jana,"I worked with Ella to rent a space for my family, visiting for the opening of my exhibition! The location was (email hidden)ally close to us...and a short walk to delicious breakfast spots. I did not get to meet Ella, but had an easy time making arrangements for my parents, sister and niece. Easy to communicate with, quick to reply! My family was delighted with the space and all of its lovely decorations! It worked great for four. They enjoyed meeting Ella and were considering relocating to Seattle so they could stay here! Recommended!"
4757025,30522592,2015-04-23,16296424,Thomas,The apt was impeccable well decorated and incredibly comfortable. Our host has gone to great lengths to have anything and everything there for your comfort. All in all a 10+. Well done Ella we will see you again.
4757025,30625033,2015-04-25,23131682,薇,"This is the first time we airbnb experience, Ella&Joe left us a very good impression, they are very hospitable. The apartment  environment is great and very quiet, there is a big park beside， we can have the morning run.
 The house facilities, if the next time we come to Seattle will choose this!"
4757025,30931935,2015-04-29,2039435,Johan,"Ella's place is amazing. It was exactly as described in the listing, lots of amenities, and was spotless and clean. Ella was super nice and accommodating and was really helpful. The place is also well located with tons of great places nearby. Would definitely stay here again. "
4757025,31552810,2015-05-06,26892567,Scarlett,"chinese speaking..
超级超级棒的地方..我还自己做了晚餐..有可爱的酱油还有必须的调料妈妈。早餐用了家里的french press to start the day！
Ella超级好..入住和退房都来确认我们是不是需要帮助..
希望我还有机会再回来！明年！！"
4757025,31663304,2015-05-08,23166319,ELiza,"This is a fabulous place- Ella is so friendly, the place is immaculate and well decorated, and the livingroom and master bedroom look onto a charming garden and Afternoon sun streams in. It's convenient to transportation but a quiet oasis. "
4757025,31898728,2015-05-11,29434320,Sophie,"Great apartment, plenty of space, with all facilities and furniture (particularly in the kitchen), super clean; quiet neighborhood but not far from downtown. We had a great time, and Ella was extremely welcoming and responsive (we enjoyed a lot arriving and spending time at Ella's place after our long flight from France). Thanks again Ella! "
4757025,32115734,2015-05-14,30165037,Elizabeth,"Very cozy, well kept home. The apartment had lots of light and was nicely appointed. Ella was responsive and accommodating. The listing description and photos are very accurate. Would happily stay again. "
4757025,32169170,2015-05-15,29540183,Ashleigh,"One word, amazing! ! This was our first air b n b experience and we are not disappointed.  Thank you for making this such a wonderful experience."
4757025,32817698,2015-05-22,24588386,Te,"Ella is a great host, the place is nice and exactly how it's described. Would definitely stay again if back in Seattle. "
4757025,33450263,2015-05-28,11491550,Faith,Really good experience at Ella's. The house was beautifully decorated and had every amenity my family and I needed. Ella was great at responding quickly and making sure we had everything we needed! Really good location with ample parking less than half a block away. 
4757025,33512298,2015-05-29,22694271,Rui,"Ella is always active in communicating and responding our questions.
And the house setup is very sweet. My friends and I love it very much."
4757025,33793985,2015-06-01,11828648,Kate,"As all Ella's reviews state, the apt was absolutely darling! She was very friendly and accommodating, and the apt was spotless and had everything we needed and more. Loved the decor and style, and I felt very comfortable there. The location was great and the neighborhood quiet. There was even a washer and dryer! The apt was a gem, and I will definitely stay again in the future!! "
4757025,33918251,2015-06-02,26705883,Rob,Ella's place is spotless and tastefully decorated. It had everything you could want and more. We only got to stay one night but wish it could have been longer!
4757025,34138405,2015-06-05,10953395,Patricia,WE DONT HAVE ENOUGH SUPERLATIVES TO DESCRIBE ELLA AND HER RENTAL.  WE ARRIVED LATE BUT THE ROOM WAS READY TO GO. NO  ISSUE. IT IS ON THE LOWER LEVEL OF HER HOME. THERE WERE PLENTY OF AMENITIES AND SHE EVEN HAD HALF AND HALF FOR OUR COFFEE. BEDROOM SPACIOUS AND A COMFORTABLE BED. PLENTY TO DO IN THE AREA. #11 BUS TAKES YOU TO DOWNTOWN AND PIKES MARKET. RESTAURANTS ARE WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE. (RECOMMEND THE FRENCH ONE FOR BREAKFAST AND LUNCH). ELLA WAS FRIENDLY AND ACCOMMODATING.  WE HAD A 2PM CHECK IN FOR OUR NEXT LOCATION. NO ISSUE WITH KEEPING LUGGAGE THERE PAST HER CHECK OUT TIME. ELLA TOOK TIME TO TALK WITH US MAKING SURE WE HAD A GREAT STAY.....WE DID. WE RECOMMEND ELLA HIGHLY.
4757025,34409694,2015-06-08,1164800,Thalia,"Ella was very responsive and accommodating throughout the process. The apartment was lovely, very clean and modern. It was a warm weekend and the apartment was nice and cool with a fan in the master bedroom. The bed linens and pillows especially all felt very high quality. We were traveling with our 2 year old and were very comfortable during our 3 night getaway at ""Ella's house."" "
4757025,34534415,2015-06-09,14457384,Shin,Ella's place was fantastic. I wish I stayed there one more night.
4757025,34623646,2015-06-10,28589317,Mary,"Ella was very helpful and nice to talk too.  She has a good sense of humor and living above the apartment was quick to respond to questions or texts.  The space is eclectic - quiet, peaceful, clean,  with a nice king sized bed in one of the bedrooms.  We loved staying there and it's closeness to the shops/restaurants located on Madison (two walking blocks away).   You can unload your vehicle at the house but must park about a half block away.   Wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.  "
4757025,34709363,2015-06-11,405715,Cathy,"We just adored Ella's beautiful home! It's even better than the photos. The rooms are bright and airy with lovely decor! The full kitchen is well equipped and having a washer and dryer on site is great for longer stays! The beautiful private back yard patio is lovely too.  Free close parking is a plus too! 

The location is fabulous, right in the Capitol Hill area and close to a cute neighborhood shopping / dining area and easy access to everything Seattle has to offer. We were only there one night but had were close to all the things we had to do in the area as well as a quick trip downtown.  

Ella was lovely and made an effort to stop by and say Hi and see if we needed anything during our stay! We'll be back for a longer stay!"
4757025,35062408,2015-06-15,1403195,Aleshia,"My mom and I stayed with Ella during a two-week vacation to the Pacific Northwest. We were the first to book with Ella and chose her place because it has two bedrooms and looked super cute!

The apartment didn't disappoint. It looks exactly as pictured, both bedrooms are very comfortable, there was plenty of space for relaxing at the end of a long day, and we LOVED the water pressure in the shower! The apartment really has anything you could possibly want. Coffee, tea, luxury toiletries, kitchen appliances, fans, ample closet space...the works!

Ella was there to meet us and kindly let us check in early. She's a friendly, communicative, and gracious host. It's clear that she put a lot of thought and care into making the space comfortable for guests. Also, I accidentally left a pair of jeans when we left, and we've made arrangements for me to stop by on our way back through Seattle on the way home to pick them up.

The location is charming and green and seems to have a lot of French influence. We enjoyed getting coffee and pastries each morning at Belle Epicurean at the top of the hill, and we had a nice Sunday brunch at nearby Cafe Flora. It's a straight shot down Madison into the downtown area on the 11 or 8 bus, which takes about 20 minutes if the buses are running on time. (This is no fault of Ella's, but we found the bus service unreliable and frustrating -- you have to have exact cash to buy a ticket onboard. We were never able to find anywhere to purchase a bus pass.)

If you're looking for a lovely, garden retreat after a day in the city, Ella's place is for you! You won't be sorry."
4757025,35457583,2015-06-19,30446945,Scott,Spacious and well appointed accommodation. Great attention to detail in a central location. Felt at home with everything you'd need. Thanks for a great stay in Seattle.
4757025,35905973,2015-06-23,11584962,Richard,"Thanks to Ella for a wonderful stay.  Everything about our stay exceeded our expectations.  It's hard to imagine a more welcoming and attentive host.  The apartment is very well appointed and comfortable.  It was perfect for two couples for a long weekend.  The apartment is located in a quiet neighborhood with a number of cafes and restaurants within walking distance.  Downtown Seattle, Bellevue, and other popular neighborhoods are just minutes away.  Make sure to enjoy the patio out back!"
4757025,36015894,2015-06-24,14858166,Evelyn,"Ella's place is awesome, photo doesn't do it justice. The place is very clean and comfortable and Ella's attention to detail just wow me. The place is equipped with anything you can think of. The place is located in a quiet neighborhood with easy parking. It's also walking distance to neighborhood shopping/dining. Short drive to Seattle downtown too.

I wish I had stayed there more than one night! Definitely will rent the same place next time I visit Seattle.
"
4757025,36088827,2015-06-25,6746946,Lies,"Ella's apartment is spacious, super clean, very well equiped and located in an area of Seattle with great restaurants, parks and spa's in the neighbourhoud. We really could relax when we stayed at her place: we watched movies, sat in the patio/garden and slept excellent.

Ella is a great host: she is very welcoming and gives all the information you need. We came earlier than the official check in time and she had no problems about us leaving our luggage already at the apartment, which helped us out a lot. "
4757025,36180292,2015-06-26,31629264,Laura,"Ella was extremely accommodating and a wonderful hostess(: The house was extremely clean and well kept. I stayed here with a few of my girlfriends & we all loved the place. I wish we would have stayed longer, but thank you again for everything! "
4757025,36263316,2015-06-27,16687654,Lauren,"We loved staying at this beautiful apartment in Seattle! It is conveniently located, quiet, and has everything you need to be comfortable.  We would definitely stay here again."
4757025,36387051,2015-06-28,10765129,Bruce,"Ella's place was beautiful! There was nothing I would change. Although we did not stay long, we felt so welcomed and comfortable."
4757025,36518251,2015-06-29,5679164,Keith,"Ella
Your place in Seattle is just beautiful.  We passed thru for a short stay but everything was just perfect. 
We found everything we needed to be very comfortable. This home was one of the cleanest we remember and we loved that. 
The location made it a straight shot downtown to the tourist district. 
Thanks for sharing this lovely home. "
4757025,36767326,2015-07-01,19745914,Andrea,"What a wonderful rental. I stayed here with my partner and his parents for two nights. Ella has gone above and beyond all expectations. Her house is clean and inviting, with adorable decor and a beautiful garden. Everyone was impressed and commented on how nice everything was. From the luxurious bed linens, selections of coffee and tea, to the abundance of high end toiletries, we felt like we were in a boutique hotel. And the location was perfect for our needs; we were close to downtown, but in a cute a quiet neighborhood. Thank you Ella, for being such a good host!"
4757025,36945981,2015-07-03,13780364,Allegra,"Ella's set up was just perfect for us--private, sunny and airy, in a nice neighborhood, fabulous restaurants near by. Ella has the place well-stocked with thick towels, nice bedding, and all you would need in a kitchen and bathroom. There is a beautiful little patio/courtyard right outside the door. Trader Joe's is nearby, so we did a little ""dining in,"" but the restaurant Ella recommended--Harvest Vine (within walking distance)--was divine, and we appreciated the tip! So glad to have stayed here, and would do so again without reservation. Ella, you are a wonderful hostess and a kind soul :)"
4757025,38301622,2015-07-14,4416818,Camille,"Everything was exactly as described in the listing.  Very nice, clean and comfortable.  Ella has done an excellent job with the decor.  Beds were very comfortable and we loved the little patio out back.  "
4757025,44627213,2015-08-28,2027180,Alison,"We spent 6 weeks at Ella's charming apartment during the spectacular Seattle summer, and we couldn't have asked for a more gracious, thoughtful host. We were relieved to find that the apartment was just as beautiful as the photos. We appreciated a clean, quiet, calm place to call home during our extended visit. Ella supplied us with everything we could have needed and more. The garden added another element (and a nice BBQ) which we took full advantage of during the warm evenings. The location was perfect, with quick and easy access to Lake Washington & Lake Union, Madison park, downtown, and freeways on either side. For those who are up for exploring, we would recommend a walk or run through the arboretum - which is just a block away and will take you all the way to Union Bay on Lake Washington. We bicycled to all Seafair festivities, and there are coffee shops and great restaurants within walking distance. We absolutely enjoyed every moment of our stay, and most definitely recommend Ella's lovely apartment. Thank you for an amazing summer!"
4757025,44912313,2015-08-30,6914679,Hazel,"My friends and I visited Seattle for the first time and loved our time there! This space is beautiful, clean, and very comfortable. Ella provided everything we needed, and was a gracious host who was always accessible in case we needed anything. It was a perfect place to relax after coming back from our busy days. Would recommend anyone staying in the area to rent this space!"
4757025,45084900,2015-08-31,11268045,Kp,"Ella is extremely kind and organized. Her location is lavish and comfortable - it was so nice that we had a hard time leaving and getting out to see the sights! I'd definitely recommend anyone stay here, it's wonderful."
4757025,45767751,2015-09-06,828953,Anna-Katja,"Ellas Wohnung war unglaublich toll! Wir haben uns sofort richtig wohl gefuehlt. Alles war super sauber, die Einrichtung sehr schoen mit Liebe zum Detail.  Waschmaschine, Trockner, Gerschirrspueler - alles was das Herz begehrt-  war vorhanden. Ella selbst war sehr freundlich. und bei Fragen immer zu Hilfe. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefuehlt. Parkplaetze gibt es kostenlos in der Nebenstrasse. Die Nachbarschaft ist sehr ruhig und angenehm. Insgesamt absolut zu empfehlen!"
4757025,46114297,2015-09-08,6171743,Nadia,"100% as shown in the photos which was PERFECT. Ella is the sweetest lady as well. I travelled with my husband and my parents in their 60s and 70s and when we arrived a bit earlier before our check-in, Ella was wonderful enough to accommodate us. We only stayed one night as a stop-over but everything was as described. The place was super clean, the beds we so comfortable and we had a great time. This was my parent's first Airbnb and it has left a positive impression on them. "
4757025,46696322,2015-09-13,7779537,Serena,"The listing and photos were accurate, it is a charming, well appointed home and a most attractive neighbourhood.  My daughter and I felt quite spoilt for choices, enjoying a lovely walk by the lake ( 10 mins away) and stroll around a relaxed, almost country style village.  Cafe flora we would highly recommend for food and ambience.  And, it is a simple 15 min bus ride to downtown on bus 11, almost outside your front door.  We also hired a car and drove to Whidbey island one day for a kayaking experience, simple, easy and a total contrast.
Ella is a wonderful host, so helpful, beyond call of duty and we felt really cared for and given all that it takes to have a superb holiday.  While I would recommend her home 100%  I would also be wary of doing that, as next time we book, there may  be no space!!
Thanks Ella.
Serena"
4757025,47141486,2015-09-16,25001782,Anne,"Great place, great location, clean, quaint, and Ella is great!  Quiet Seattle neighborhood with easy access to everything in town.  Would stay here again, and would plan to recommend it to others. "
4757025,47338069,2015-09-17,21085913,Nathan,"Ella was informative, timely, and the location was exactly as advertised. Highly recommended! clean and comfortable! Many thanks"
4757025,47620635,2015-09-21,32428050,Kathy,"We so enjoyed our stay here. We were in town for th Susan G. Komen 3 day walk. The location was convenient to downtown and the base camp. The acommodations were wonderful. The floor plan was great and everything was so well stocked. 
Can't wait to return to Seattle and would stay again. 
Ella is a gracious hostess."
4757025,49693295,2015-10-05,44557688,Peter,Had a great stay in Ella's beautiful home.  The home was really well decorated and furnished with all high quality items.  All rooms were clean to the same level as a 5 star hotel.  It is a fantastic location in reference to downtown.  Plenty of street parking around the block.  I would stay here again for sure!  Thank you Ella!
4757025,49882354,2015-10-07,38146992,Jing,The room is fantastic!!!! And Ella is very friendly. We are arriving very early that morning and wake Ella up. But she is so nice and help us to store our luggage. Every detail in the room is perfect. Decoration is great as well! Everything is fantastic. Thanks for the stay. Highly recommend!!! Hope to come back again.

4757025,50752647,2015-10-14,7000684,Jing,This was one of my best Airbnb experiences. Ella's house looked more beautiful and more spacious than pictures. Ella considered every detail and gave us enough privacy. Hope to come back again.
4757025,51265212,2015-10-19,34278933,Megan,"We loved staying at Ella's place. It's in a perfect location, about a 5 minute drive into downtown Seattle. The neighborhood was quiet and cute, with a pizza place and a little cafe within walking distance. The house has a totally separate entrance and you would never realize it's connected to the main house. 
Ella was sweet to introduce us and show us around the place and then came and said goodbye the morning we were leaving. This is the perfect neighborhood to stay in! "
4757025,51632841,2015-10-22,33941979,Ben,The apartment is incredibly cute - very smartly decorated and Ella thought of everything we might need from bathroom supplies to kitchen amenities. 
4757025,52480673,2015-10-30,2438160,Matthew & Martha,"This flat is very well furnished.  The beds are super comfortable and everything works brilliantly.  The kitchen has just about all the stuff you'd need for some excellent home cooking.  The neighborhood is one of seattle's best with two of my favorite restaurants very nearby, Cafe Flora and Jae's Sushi.  Ella and Joe were very welcoming and accomodating.  They've definitely made my short list for return trips to Seattle."
4757025,52717420,2015-11-01,14720102,Lisa,"We had a memorable stay. The apartment was spacious and clean and thoughtfully stocked with amenities such as shampoo, soaps, coffee, teas....  Ella and Joe were friendly and helpful."
4757025,53117912,2015-11-05,22295923,Filip,Wondeful place in a very nice part of the town. Ella and her husband Joe are great hosts and we felt very comfortable at their home. Thank you
4757025,53344105,2015-11-08,36200679,Janice,"We had a wonderful time staying at Ella's place - it is just as cute as it looks in the photos, extremely quiet, and was absolutely spotless.  Ella made us feel welcome when we arrived - and the little touches (cream waiting in the fridge, lovely toiletries, and every kitchen utensil you would want!) made it feel just like home.  The beds are both really comfortable, and the neighbourhood is quiet but a 5 minute walk from a really nice restaurant strip, and a 15 minute walk from Safeway for those that feel like cooking at home.  
Parking is easy and available, and it is a short drive to downtown/shopping/attractions.  Highly recommended & we hope to be back!"
4757025,54094123,2015-11-16,8693422,Steven,"We had a great time staying at this apartment. What a find?! We were lucky to be booking far in advance and it was available. I understand it's popularity. We were just a group of 4 in town for a weekend for a Seahawks game and this was a perfect place for us to rest our heads and feet. We felt totally welcome and, despite not needing much assistance, Ella and her husband made it known that they could help with any needs we had. Highly recommend this as a place to stay."
4757025,54962389,2015-11-25,10574615,Arielle,"Ella was responsive and warm from the moment the interaction on AirBnb began.  Her lovely home was above and beyond.  It was clean and pretty with everything one would need, along with comfy beds, and plenty of privacy.  We were so happy with our stay.  We were all wishing that we could have spent more time there.  If we need a place in Seattle in the future we will definitely try and stay here again.  "
4757025,54973876,2015-11-27,35333857,Judy,"We had such a wonderful overnight in this spacious apartment. Kitchen is stocked with more than basics, helping us convert some groceries into a cozy home-cooked meal. Lovely neighborhood for strolling and exploring too - lots to do within a short distance.
But the prime attraction was our host- Ella. Just a brief encounter endeared her to us and makes us look forward to a return (and longer) visit when we can appreciate the outdoor space as well."
4757025,55390555,2015-12-01,12881825,Sarah,"Our experience at Ella and Joe's home was stellar!  It was sparkling clean, and all the lovely touches made it so comfortable.  We felt so welcomed, and hope we can stay here again on our next visit to Seattle.  This spot made a special family visit just perfect."
4757025,55642083,2015-12-03,45024102,Brittany,"My family and I stayed at Ella's house for one night in our way up to the San Juan Islands. We were having trouble finding a hotel room large enough so I booked the room last minute. My parents had never stayed in an Airbnb and were sort of skeptical. 

The place was great. It looked even nicer than the photos, every room was very well appointed, and the process of getting checked in was super easy. My parents haven't been able to stop talking about how much they loved it and it was just so much better than a hotel for half the price."
4757025,55683964,2015-12-04,49664990,Amy,"Nice neighborhood, very clean and comfortable apartment, had everything we needed. Great experience, thank you Ella!! "
4757025,55855383,2015-12-06,4314751,Dawn,"This was my first time using Airbnb, and it was a great experience with this gem of a listing. Clean, bright, well-equipped (half and half in the fridge, coffee in the cabinet), and spacious. Parking nearby, but I recommend taking your belongings into the flat, as we had our car broken into after we had checked out, in a neighborhood about 1/2 mile from here. This neighborhood is quiet, safe, residential but close to several really good dining options, including a great brunch spot (Luc). Ella was a fabulous hostess, really enjoyed meeting her and the lovely home-baked Madelines she brought us! Thank you Ella for a warm and inviting spot in our Seattle weekend."
4757025,55963118,2015-12-07,49665816,Eric,"This was my first experience with Airbnb. Ella's place was exactly what she said, very clean and spacious. This was also our first time to Seattle. Her place was close to downtown you could walk some places or can it or drive. Prefect experience. Thank you Ella "
4757025,56101538,2015-12-08,45024102,Brittany,"My parents stayed with Ella for a second time and everything was just as great as it was the first time.  The pictures and descriptions are accurate, the space is quiet and roomy, and we especially liked the gas fire-place.  Thanks, Ella!"
4757025,56223640,2015-12-10,27785557,Chad & Kim,"Ella's unit is adorable.  The pictures are reflective of the décor and cleanliness and the kitchen is well stocked for a day or a longer stay. 
We will be booking this location again. 

Thanks Ella!"
4757025,56375395,2015-12-13,46465543,Andre,"Ella was a great host. She provided a beautiful home to stay in and had everything we needed even for the one night. If you are looking for a cozy place to stay that is a short drive from downtown Seattle, come by Ella's home!"
4757025,57922597,2015-12-30,19201389,Naphat,We had a wonderful time at your place. My aunt did not want to leave your place for the tour! Ella is so thoughtful about all details. We can confirm that out of 10 air bnb we had experienced. This one is by far the best.

4187961,53523168,2015-11-09,29599923,Deborah,"Mimi was a consummate hostess: friendly, helpful, immediately responsive, and very kind. The pied a terre was welcoming, very well designed for both comfort and fun, and very spacious. Her home is in a great neighborhood. I had a wonderful long walk before breakfast to enjoy the autumn smells and colors. And she's just a few steps from two great breakfast cafes, while still remaining on a quiet street. Couldn't be better. I'm hoping to stay there whenever I visit my daughter."
4187961,54348175,2015-11-18,48685459,Katie,"Had a great stay at this intimate apartment. Separate entrance provided privacy for our family. House was stocked with great options for our two-year-old to explore. Our host provided a nice welcome gift of apples, oranges, and oatmeal, as well as coffee/tea with some milk and lemons/limes. Home looked like the photos and we even had access to laundry, which was great again, with our two-year-old :)"
4187961,54769751,2015-11-23,22131909,Gabriela,"This place was absolutely perfect! First off, can I just say that Ballard is the one of best neighborhoods in Seattle! It is away from all of the tourism, Capitol Hill crazyness, etc. But please don't mistaken this place to be boring! Literally, there are a number of bars and restaurants to choose from to visit right down the street. Like 6 houses down we are talking! Mimi was great! She welcomed us with a home-made oatmeal jar, tangerines, and many other treats. Loved it and hope you all enjoy her home as much as I did. Extremely clean and well kept! "
4187961,55005590,2015-11-27,15852285,Carol,"Mimi met us and was very warm and welcoming. She made contact once we were settled to check if there was anything we needed. 
Excellent host. "
4187961,55406516,2015-12-01,46922817,Gretchen,"Our host, Mimi, was very welcoming. The accommodations are spacious and comfortable. The bedroom is very private and quiet. From the photo, I wasn't sure if it was a separate room but was happy to see that it was which made it comfortable when other family members stopped by. The unit was easy to find and the neighborhood is great. It is well situated in an area where there are not a lot of hotels so it was very convenient to have this as a place to stay. We were free to come and go as we pleased with easy access to the unit. 

The only suggestion we would have is to get a countertop microwave for the unit. There was no way to heat up water for hot tea or oatmeal and this would have been nice. (I am not a coffee drinker!) All in all, we were very pleased with our first Airbnb experience. "
4357979,22610278,2014-11-10,10685236,Michelle,"Alicia is terrific and her space is dreamy.  Filled with natural light, warm, and a freaking fantastic location.  I would recommend spending this space any day anytime.  Absolutely lovely!  Thank you:)"
4357979,22868224,2014-11-16,23544407,Elizabeth,"Alicia was a very welcoming host and very friendly! Her apartment was warm, clean, cozy, and super quiet for a house that was near to a commercial area. My boyfriend and I stayed there one night because he had an evening talk in Seattle at a garden. Alicia did not mind that we returned on the later side of the evening after we had dinner with old friends. She was up reading and listening to serene music. The area of Fremont is cool. My boyfriend and I stumbled up the Fremont troll as we walked around to get breakfast. We ate at Pie... They sell pie.  Also, from Alicia, I learned how to make a coffee pour-over.  I would certainly recommend staying with her.  "
4357979,23083295,2014-11-22,20640343,Natalie,"Alicia is a very welcoming and gracious host. the house is spotless and location is excellent.  All appliances are working exceptionally well, despite of the older house. I cooked, did my laundry as needed. Will definitely stay there again."
4357979,23256216,2014-11-26,20640343,Natalie,"It was a great stay again, I came back :) Very nice location, great neighborhood. Alicia is an excellent host."

4357979,30417291,2015-04-21,1728317,Alyssa,"Alicia was great! She and her roommate were really welcoming and made me feel at home right away. The house is really cute, the room and bed comfortable, and the neighborhood for me was ideal. It's not right in the middle of everything (downtown), but it's close enough and there are tons of really great cafes, bars, and restaurants just a block or few away. There's also a great weekend flea market/street fair that's worth strolling through. I'd definitely stay there on my next visit. "
4357979,33827961,2015-06-01,15225615,Colleen,"I had a great experience staying at Alicia's beautiful apartment.  The room was cozy, the whole apartment was clean and welcoming, and best of all the location was FANTASTIC.  Exploring Fremont was a real treat, and probably not something I would have prioritized had I stayed downtown.  There are several convenient buses that took me anywhere I wanted to go.  Alicia was out of town when I stayed, but she gave me some great recommendations beforehand, and her roommate Will also had some good suggestions.  I really appreciated that Alicia was flexible with check in and check out.  It was almost a shame that I spent all my time out exploring Seattle because it also would be enjoyable to relax with a book and a coffee in the apartment.  I would absolutely stay here again on my next trip! "
4357979,35234297,2015-06-16,33580037,Michelle,"Alicia was very flexible about our arrival time and helpful with logistics (parking, etc.). The room was clean, if a bit cramped, but the apartment was very cute and in a convenient neighborhood. We didn't interact much as we were only looking for a place to crash, so it worked out well. "
4357979,35791557,2015-06-22,29875298,Patricia,"Everything was so wonderful! The place is welcoming, clean, and has adorable decor. The directions were spot on for my arrival too. I could walk to enjoy any type of food/drink. The neighborhood is so fun! "
4357979,38033820,2015-07-12,10826914,Stef,"Alicia's place is great!  It's like an indie rock boutique hotel, with groovy furnishings and music at the ready.  The inviting living room overlooks Fremont Ave, and it's close to cafes, restaurants, bars, shopping.  Although I didn't meet Alicia, she filled me in on everything I needed to know about checking in and out.  I had a really nice stay. "
4357979,38185459,2015-07-13,36887341,Dan,"Neighborhood is great, great restaurants and bars are 2 blocks away. The bed was pretty comfortable (on the firm side). The house has a lot of character. It was pretty quiet for being right in the middle of things. I only heard the neighbor get home around midnight, not too much else other than general city noise. The windows are really old and don't isolate well, but that's not an issue. I would stay here again."
4357979,38925678,2015-07-19,21212492,Allie,This listing could not describe how amazing the place was. It exceed our expectations!
4357979,40577504,2015-08-01,26305,Tim,"Alicia was a wonderful host, very friendly and helpful. I had to make a change to my arrival time, and Alicia was very flexible about that, too. The room is simple but has everything you need, and the rest of the apartment is great--clean, comfortable, and sunny. The Fremont neighborhood is a lot of fun, and Alicia's is within walking distance of all of it. Overall, a great experience. I would highly recommend staying here!"
4357979,43359772,2015-08-19,304593,Sally,"Alicia has a beautiful, comfortable, and well equipped home and I very much enjoyed my stay! I did not want to leave Fremont - such a fun place! She gave excellent detailed instructions for arrival and left great recommendations in the room as well. I would definitely recommend to others and stay there again on my next visit. "
4357979,50172358,2015-10-10,2402189,Ashley,"Alicia was warm, thoughtful and very helpful as I navigated a new neighborhood in a new city. The room is cozy and very comfortable and the rest of the apartment is well designed and hospitable. The apartment is located within walking distance to so many amazing restaurants and shops, and is within a few blocks of the bus system that can take you all over the city. I would stay here everytime I returned to Seattle!"
9316399,54048037,2015-11-15,47739272,Brennan,"Had a great time at Alden's place. Right across the street from the college, really nice view also. Super convenient location, and Alden was a great host. "
9316399,54541134,2015-11-21,2585613,Rebecca,"Alden was such a lovely host - she is an undergrad at UW and is very friendly, interested in getting to know me, and offered plenty of recommendations for activities, food, coffee, transportation, etc. She was easy to communicate with and very responsive. The bed is comfortable, in a closet with just a few feet of space around it, but you have access to the entire apartment. If you're looking for a place that's for lounging and very spacious, spick and span, etc. then this might not be the best place, but if you want to be near UW in a cute building and with a friendly host then it's great!"
9316399,54670367,2015-11-22,49219070,Yilin,she is very nice .but  the room is a little bit small for couple.
9316399,55465296,2015-12-01,48371038,Thomas,"Amazing Host! Made us feel very welcome, and accommodated to our requests very well. The price was more than reasonable as well for the location and space. Definitely would recommend her to anyone!"
8187592,48633902,2015-09-27,44537187,Lindsey,Jorge is an excellent host! His house is really nice and comfortable. There's a light rail station to downtown Seattle and airport within 10 minutes walk. I would recommend Jorge's house to people visiting Seattle!
8187592,49535736,2015-10-04,44789550,Jake,Jorge greeted us to show us around when we got there. His house is beautiful and cozy. He made sure everything was clean for us and even left out sparkling water and chocolate on both beds. We were over an hour later than we originally planned but he waited and didn't let us know if he was inconvenienced. He was flexible and willing to let us stay late if we needed.
6895132,35754815,2015-06-21,30404074,Karev,Lovely place with a beautiful garden. Kind host and near to restaurant and 24h supermarket
6895132,44447381,2015-08-26,14656855,Makenzie,"Staying at The Zen Home was everything I could have asked for and more from an AirB&B. Wafa went farther than most would go to make my friend and I feel welcome from checking in before we arrived to getting us snacks and tea to make us feel comfortable during our stay. There was a ton of space for us to hang out and the space overall was very lovely. The neighborhood was sleepy and peaceful with most conveniences just a short distance away. If I'm back in Seattle, I know where I will go to stay! "
6895132,46044405,2015-09-07,16815212,Kim,"We loved our stay at Wafa's home! It is a quiet and peaceful setting, with a nice private wing of her home that was made available to us. Wafa communicated with us promptly leading up to and during our stay. She was very attentive to any needs we had, and available- but also respectful of our space and privacy. 
The space was cozy and quiet, and the king-sized bed was exceptionally comfortable. The chill space/meditation room was also- so much so that I caught a nap on the pillows without even meaning to. :-)
We will definitely stay here again next time we are in the Seattle area. The home is outside of downtown Seattle- but an easy drive as we had a car. "
6895132,48637599,2015-09-27,43862997,Cathy,"Our trip to Seattle was enhanced by staying in this unique sanctuary.    Wafa has worked hard to create a peaceful, open space and she was so gracious about welcoming us and allowing us to feel like it was our home.  Her hospitality included all the comforts of home, along with special treats (chocolate!), and little notes leading the way.  She was as excited as we were to hear about our jaunts during the day and shared some aspects of what living in Seattle is like.  The home is located conveniently in a easy to access neighborhood, with coffee shops, groceries, and restaurants close at hand.   I can't say enough about how fun it was taking advantage of this great home.  We will definitely stay there in the future, provided she has openings.  Perhaps we will go dancing next time!!!  Thank you so much"
6348159,32801304,2015-05-21,16477349,Donna,"     I had the most wonderful 'stayvacation' at Trudi and Stu's beautiful house, while I had work done on my home. 

     Their West Seattle house is lovely, clean,  comfortable, aesthetic, and it feels like 'home', the minute you step in. The bedroom room is very comfortable, as is the bed. And I liked having exclusive use of the bathroom, on the main floor.

     The best part of my experience was being with Trudi and Stu.  The two are kind, caring souls. During our first morning together, they put me at ease- they are warm and connecting, wonderful listeners. They surprised me with a delicious breakfast, and the best coffee ever- now that's saying a lot for a Seattleite! I learned that they used to own a collective restaurant; they are fabulous, healthy cooks.  They know a lot about Seattle, too- I  learned about a lot of places in Seattle that I had never heard of before.
 
     I was their first airbnb guest, and I'm honored. These two folks are meant for airbnb hosting! They are natural and easy,  curious, and delightful! I can't say enough good things about my airbnb experience!

     Before arriving, I was simply looking for a reasonable airbnb with good busing, while I had to stay out of my house. I found much more- relaxation, and rest, camaraderie, and lovely connection.

   And I loved their co-housing community, everyone seems to live together with grace and acceptance. Their co-housing little village is aesthetic, with a gorgeous common house, beautiful homes and gardens, and a big Asian gong to call the residents together. It was very interesting talking with Trudi and Stu about co-housing.

   Trudi and Stu, like myself, are progressive people, active in many progressive causes. I enjoyed experiencing the many ways they blend their beliefs into their work and home, and now with their new airbnb hosting.

     I highly recommend Trudi and Stu's home! "
6348159,33333916,2015-05-26,28890164,Maureen,"We were an hour late and Trudi and her husband waited for us and helped us to get there. They made us feel like home since the very beginning by offering us drinks and snacks. They also gave us a lot of tips on where to go in Seattle. We could also use their living room and kitchen whenever we wanted. 
The pictures are very representative of the house, it is very cosy and clean. We had our own bathroom. They provided us with shampoo and towels. 
The neighborhood was very quiet and very close to the city center (10-15 min by car). Also, it was a very safe neighborhood and we could park our car easily.
Trudi and Stu were very very friendly and nice and we absolutely loved staying with them.  "
6348159,35406697,2015-06-18,34420382,Kate,"My friend and I spent about 3 days and nights in Trudi and Stu's home. We felt very comfortable and welcomed!!! The first day we met at a coffee house near their home, they printed out the maps of Seattle and show us very detailed transportation ways to downtown, which is pretty helpful, we appreciated that a lot! The environment is warm and sweet that they live as cohousing, in which many people familiar with each other live together. But at night the neighborhood is a little dark and at the first night we come back late (We went to the glass museum under Space Needle, because we wanted to see those gorgeous glass at night, so we waited until the sun got down...:( We didn't expect that the sun start to fall until 9pm...We also entered the wrong way, if you have to come back late, use the entrance on 17th ave, the 17th is much brighter than 18th ave) Trudi and Stu waited for us until very late that night, we felt very sorry to keep them so late. And we felt so warm that they are just like our grandparents!!!  We're very glad to choose this place to stay! The last day we have dinner together,  and I bet that's one of the best meals I have ever had in United States as an international student :D. If I have chance to visit Seattle again, I would live there again and I'd like to recommend this place to my friends.  Thanks Trudi and Stu! :D"
6348159,35583277,2015-06-20,10732542,Jake,"Our stay with Trudi and Stu was wonderful. Both of our hosts were very accommodating of our luggage once we arrived in Seattle, and had a nice, clean & private room waiting for us. They were also very helpful in educating us on the many neighborhoods of Seattle, and the best ways to get around town. I would absolutely recommend a stay with these fine folks!"
5286781,53479590,2015-11-09,44928628,Sara,"Claire’s place was awesome! And Claire was too! The antique furniture and appliances were beautiful, and with it’s central location, it was a quick drive to wherever my husband and I wanted to explore.  We’d never been to Seattle before, and Clarie offered some fantastic suggestion for things to do and places to eat around Seattle.  Claire was super helpful the whole time, and was the best airbnb host we could've asked for! We highly recommend this place if you’re coming to Seattle!"
2037250,10768984,2014-03-06,1422547,Ryan,Fantastic house.  Fantastic host.  The steam room was sublime. Sheldon rules!
2037250,14328445,2014-06-16,13459395,Mark,"We stayed in the upstairs suite.  The bedroom was in the attic, with cool roof line angles and several windows.  Very spacious; room to spread out.  Plenty of closet and drawer space.  The bed is tops; supportive, quiet, restful.
The bathroom features a 2 person steam sauna!  I used it twice a day.
This room, as well as the first floor suite, are new looking, and feel very upscale.
The neighborhood is quiet, yet a few blocks from a commercial street with several nice restaurants.  The best part about staying in Ballard is that you are 1.2 miles from the famous Greenlake.  Greenlake has a 2.8 mile running path around the lake which is a must if you exercise.  We also enjoyed being close to Fisherman's Terminal (seafood!).
Sheldon is a gracious host.  He has a side business of pet sitting/dog walking.  For anyone considering hiring him for this job, I can tell you he was gone most of the days with the pets; he obviously puts in the time keeping the dogs company.  However, he is only a text away should an AirBnB guest have a question.  And if you want privacy, you probably won't see Sheldon, nor hear him at night (his bedroom is across the hall from the upstairs suite).
There is no breakfast, but you can use the kitchen and dining room.  However, Ballard has MANY fine restaurants for a meal any time of the day or night."
2037250,14746007,2014-06-25,15695108,Becky,"Our stay with Sheldon was great - we enjoyed visiting with him about the National Parks as one of our kiddos was doing a National Parks vacation at the time.  We were in Seattle to visit relatives so did not spend much time at the house other than to sleep.
The room was bright, spacious, comfortable and very clean.  There is an ample closet with a chest of drawers inside of it, also the ironing board and iron are stored there as well.  The bed was super comfortable!
The bathroom was also spacious and bright and the shower included a steam feature which we used and really enjoyed!  I noticed there was also a hair dryer in the bathroom so if you don't want to lug yours you don't have to!
When booking I was a little concerned about the heat on the third floor.  Our stay was in mid-June and the weather in Seattle turned out to be fabulous.  When we arrived Sheldon did let us know that because of my concern he had gone ahead and ordered a window air-conditioner and if need be he would install it!  Sheldon is obviously very concerned about the comfort of his guests.
We would stay there again!"
2037250,15283546,2014-07-06,12430550,Aaron,"Had a great time staying with Sheldon in Seattle.  Room was clean, comfortable and had a private bathroom.  Sheldon was also very helpful in providing us with suggestions around where to eat and places of interest around the Seattle area.  Great experience.  Thanks Sheldon!  "
2037250,15655460,2014-07-13,3068781,Rajus,"Sheldon was a life saver for my wife and I the week of July 7th, 2014.  Though Sheldon had guests 25 of the preceding 30 nights, he heard our situation of being in-between homes and agreed to host us.  His room and en-suite bath were sparkling and comfortable and his hospitality was gracious.  We simply wanted an affordable place to stay during our hectic work week and we came away with a new appreciation for the Phinney neighborhood and a friend in Sheldon.  In addition to a restful reprieve, Sheldon was very warm in making us feel at ease.  Moreover, we thoroughly enjoyed our conversations with him.  Sheldon has a wealth of experience and a comprehensive understanding of Seattle, Phinney and nearby neighborhoods.  We are Seattleites and highly recommend Sheldon's home as a place to stay if in need of a home for temporary living.  And we certainly see Sheldon's home as a terrific abode for tourists who are visiting Seattle and are keen to experience the city as a native.   Overall, we cannot thank Sheldon enough!"
2037250,15881577,2014-07-17,17350517,Nelson,"Sheldon started our first airbnb experience with extremely high standards. Very welcoming and hospitable, friendy and made you feel at home.

Sheldon went above and beyond as he created an entire day itinerary to Mt. Rainier for us, gave us excellent advice on what to see and when, as well as saving us money from not being shuttled around in a bus all day. Local recommendations for places to eat/get groceries were also appreciated

Sheldons place was immaculate, the private bathroom was excellent (with nice tall showerheads) and the access to air conditioning was much appreciated during the hot summer nights.

We appreciated him lending us maps, a cooler for Mt. Rainier, fridge space and use of laundry facilities, as well as staying up late one weekday to meet us and explain his itinerary in detail. His passion and concern for taking care of guests clearly showed all through our time there.

Tastefully decorated, very quiet neighborhood, would definitely return here for future trips. Thanks Sheldon!"
2037250,16627366,2014-07-30,17737488,Brian,"We found Sheldon's 3rd floor room to be inviting, clean, comfortable, and the shower/steam room were great! Sheldon is very knowledgeable about Seattle, had plenty of suggestions for exploring the city, and provided detailed instructions on how to visit Mt. Rainier in a day. The neighborhood was good, we felt safe throughout our stay, and there are cafes and a grocery store within walking distance. We highly recommend Sheldon's airbnb."
2037250,17122299,2014-08-07,10364013,Ken,"I arranged this room from Sheldon for my recently retired father to say for a few days. The bedroom and the bathroom were exactly as represented in the photos, clean, modern, and aesthetically pleasing. The remainder of the house was as well. Coordinating check-in with Sheldon was easy and seamless; he was a very friendly and welcoming host."
2037250,17902508,2014-08-18,18596737,Brian,"Great place in a great neighborhood! Clean, and the most comfy bed ever. Sheldon was responsive, friendly and helpful. "
2037250,18270030,2014-08-24,15399284,John,"Sheldon was a great and helpful host.  The room and bath were exactly as described.  The bed was comfortable, the room clean and neat.  We would recommend this room and bath as a great place to stay in the Seattle area."
2037250,18592416,2014-08-28,13740672,Phil,Sheldon was flexible and let me check my bags early and was there to meet me later that night to take me through the house and get me settled. A very nice room on the third floor and ver quiet house and neighborhood. Plenty of towels and great shower. I had the use of the washer and dryer and supplies and the refrigerator. Nice walking neighborhood close to everything you need and bus stop a block away. Plenty of street parking. Room had a window AC which I needed a few times. Large walk in closet. Sheldon is friendly but not intrusive. 
2037250,19485366,2014-09-13,20616751,Tom,We enjoyed our stay here.  Everything was exactly as portrayed and described.  Sheldon is a gracious host.  The neighborhood is pleasant and located near good restaurants.
2037250,21164447,2014-10-12,4328086,Sheila,Sheldon went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and give is ideas for places to explore in the neighborhood. Would definitely recommend the experience to anyone!
2037250,21973127,2014-10-27,5810626,Janette,"Sheldon is an excellent host and I enjoyed my time in Seattle visiting family.  The location is excellent and this room was exactly as pictured, very clean and very inviting.  This was my second visit staying at Sheldon's and I would definitely stay with him again if his space is available.  I highly recommend this private room in Sheldon's home.  "
2037250,24010105,2014-12-16,8152252,Teresa,"Sheldon was again a welcoming host and this room is quiet clean and comfortable. The bed is the most comfortable bed other than my own that I have ever slept in! After a long flight the steam shower was heavenly!
I love staying in the greenwood section of Seattle because the neighborhood is easily walkable with many great restaurants and stores nearby.  One night I walked to the pharmacy and was treated to all the beautiful Christmas lights in the area."
2037250,34745280,2015-06-11,33758466,Andrea,Great hospitality and accommodations! Highly recommendable. Sheldon replied quickly and was easy to deal with. 
2037250,35232861,2015-06-16,19932812,Spring,"Sheldon is a great host! Very friendly and provide everything you need, very considerate, my parents had a great stay :)"
2037250,36625863,2015-06-29,5091846,Devin,"Sheldon was really welcoming guest and the room is terrific. Great bed, spacious bathroom, and as a special bonus, there's an air conditioner for those rare, hot, Seattle days. 

The neighborhood is really fantastic. The house is just a couple of blocks off of a street that features two bookstores, cafes, a library, and a whole slew of good restaurants, including what many believe to be the best burger in Seattle. 

I definitely recommend spending some time with Sheldon at his home. "
2037250,39622163,2015-07-25,4622088,Michael,Sheldon is a great host.  The room was exactly as described and everything was clean and tidy.  Great location on a quiet residential street just off Greenwood Ave N that has many local restaurants and bars + a few groceries and easy bus access.  I would definitely recommend staying with Sheldon when visiting Seattle!
2037250,40145691,2015-07-28,16510899,Molly,"My wife and I really enjoyed our stay here. The room was extremely clean. You would think it was renovated the day before you arrived, very impressive. It also had a large and equally clean bathroom with an awesome shower/steam room. Very cool touch. Also, the bed was very comfortable and the sheets were very smooth and soft, a big deal in my opinion. Sheldon has lived in Seattle for many years and has endless advice and insight on what to do in and around Seattle and will tell you how to do it as easily as possible. He gives you the very useful tips that only someone that has lived there a long time could offer. We had a great experience staying here. "
2037250,41242542,2015-08-05,22122440,Mario,Wanted to say we thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Sheldon. He greeted us with a bruschetta appetizer prepared from heirloom tomatoes in his garden. He was also helpful with maps and guidance for our hiking trip to Rainier. Sheldon obviously cares about his guests and does everything possible to make them feel comfortable. A great conversationalist who loves living the Seattle lifestyle. We highly recommend him as a gracious air bnb host 
2037250,42020459,2015-08-10,30891018,Dennis,"Sheldon's house is one of the best airbnb house i stayed so far. The room is spacious and clean. He provides tower for every single day of my stay and the bed is really comfortable.  He is a flexible guy, i wanted to check in a little early and so he arranged it for me. Sheldon offered me tomatos that were grown by him. I'm extremely pleased with my stay and will definitely come back for a stay if I come to seattle again. "
2037250,50349982,2015-10-11,44950688,Akin,"I had a sense that Sheldon was a pleasant fellow even as I communicated with him before I came into Seattle, but he proved to be even more of a gentleman and a wonderful host than I had anticipated. 
His home is very neat and he keeps it that way. My room was as comfortable as my own home, and very much the description I saw on the site.
Been in the process of relocating to Seattle, Sheldon gave a lot of very useful advice from years of living in the neighbourhood and Seattle, and was always ready to listen and give guidance in my search for my own (new) home in Seattle. 

Sheldon's place offers a home away from home and my two weeks stay there couldn't have been spent in a more comfortable place and neighbourhood. And yes, neighbourhood, his home is in a very lovely neighborhood with warm and friendly folks, and wonderful places for some good food.
If I ever was to use an airbnb again any where in the world, Sheldon has set the minimum standard for my expectations.
Thank you very much Sheldon, thanks for a wonderful experience in your comfortable home.

8093529,50559137,2015-10-12,45620434,Brian,"The apartment is great.  Good size and very modern.  Plenty of blankets and towels too.  Perfect location, walking distance to the pike market and to the monrail that goes to the needle.  Jenell welcomed us, showed us around the building, and was a great host."
8093529,51346081,2015-10-19,45393344,Hadley,"I can't imagine a better place to stay in Seattle! Centrally located, clean, fresh, with a bottle of wine for a welcome. Jenell was helpful and interested in making my stay the best that it could be. I loved looking out the windows at the water and the other building around. Go no further! This is the place to stay! "

2652941,11811069,2014-04-15,11838409,Travis,Laura the host was very helpful with directions and instructions.   Everything was comfortable and well kept.  Access was easy and the neighborhood was peaceful.  A very cozy place for one or two people. 
2652941,13443123,2014-05-27,969569,Stephani,"This place was quaint, nice and quiet. Very clean. Good for two adults and one little one. Joe and Laura were very responsive to our needs. "
2652941,13759271,2014-06-03,15516776,LuAnn,"Timely and courteous responses and exchanges with our hosts, Laura and Joe.  They were very attentive to our needs. Thank You for a great stay on Seattle!"
2652941,13940145,2014-06-08,16246220,Ariel,"This place is like a little home away from home! Comfy, quiet and cozy. Easily accessible location and very accommodating amenities. Laura was great and quickly responded to all messages. There were even little snacks waiting for us! Thanks so much for the stay!"
2652941,14274279,2014-06-16,3550356,Jeanette,Yes
2652941,15330581,2014-07-07,11020435,Travis,"Had an absolutely wonderful time staying here. Everything was extremely clean and the host was great. A breeze to find, get in, and checkout. House comes with anything you would need from bath towels, kitchen utensils, pots, pans, and extra blanket. Great location very accessible to Seattle. Would love to stay here again. "
2652941,15762399,2014-07-15,15939374,Candice,"This apartment was exactly what we needed!  It is in an adorable part of town, with very easy access to public transportation.  It was very, very clean, and had many little amenities, such as coffee, a blow dryer, and access to laundry.  It was perfect for our little family with a small baby, because we could put him down to nap in one room and still have conversations in another room without disturbing him.  We also happen to be in town during an unusual heat wave, and having the air conditioner was a huge perk.  I would HIGHLY recommend this listing to friends visiting the area!"
2652941,16203311,2014-07-23,15341661,Seth,Laura was a great host. She was quick to respond to emails and text messages. The Luna Park Upper was exactly as expected. It was clean and a nice place. We enjoyed its location in West Seattle. It was close enough to downtown to get there in 15 min bus ride yet far enough to feel safe and comfortable. I would stay here again.  
2652941,16471384,2014-07-28,3329997,Brittany,"Luna Park Upper was just perfect for my and my two friends' needs for a long weekend: it was easy to get in (simple key arrangement), travel from there (right on the C line), and relax there. The place has all the basic amenities you need (and then some), is immaculately clean, gets a nice breeze, and has a few food items around the house which were a lovely touch. It's an independent affair, but Laura is very available via text--my ideal set-up. Wonderful and highly recommended. "
2652941,16687651,2014-07-31,6412778,Jeff,"Staying at Upper Luna Park was a wonderful experience. The apartment is small, but well appointed and very comfortable. Laura was an excellent host and made the checkin/checkout process very easy. Everything went smoothly and I have no complaints. The neighborhood was actually better than I expected with Starbucks and great restaurants less than two blocks away. Absolutely a great stay. I will stay here again and recommend to friends in the future. "
2652941,16912161,2014-08-04,16182550,Peter,It was a feeling like coming home.Everex hing we need was in tue Appartement. The neighbourhood was Peters fand solvent.We will come back
2652941,17070245,2014-08-06,13007051,Theresa,"Laura was very easy to communicate with and the process of renting through her was very smooth. The pictures made it seem like there was two separate rooms for each bed, but it was only one bedroom with two beds. Even though, it was a bit small the apt was clean and very comfortable. It is the perfect place for anyone who is on a budget, wanting to spend time in the city. The backyard was also a lovely surprise, full of different plants and flowers with cute little sitting areas. Also, this location was very close to Alki Beach, but it was about 20 mins from anything else. The neighborhood was quaint and quite, I would definitely rent this place again!"
2652941,18124728,2014-08-22,2922999,Daniela,"We arrived at Laura's place after a long journey with many delays and were very happy when we finally set foot in this home away from home. Our two kids felt equally relieved and slept beautifully. Laura even set up a baby crib for our youngest and the 3 year old was very happy with the Duplo that he found in one of the closets. The Beds were super comfy.

Although we didn't get a chance to meet Laura and her family communication was very easy, fast and super friendly. 

The city was easy to reach. The house is on a little hill. If you leave the car its only a short 5 min walk down to the Rapid Line C. We took the water taxi downtown, a great tip from Laura. We walked there from the apartment. Probably a good 30 mins one way. 

Breakfast we had at Luna Park Café, a great unique place which we loved."
2652941,18550726,2014-08-28,18648412,Brian,"Luna Park Upper made a perfect base camp for my wife and I as we explored West Seattle and hunted for an apartment. We walked or rode the bus everywhere and the convenient location allowed us plenty of options. We found everything we needed inside and the entire booking process was seamless. We apparently visited during a bit of a heat wave too, so having air conditioning was a huge plus after walking around all day. Highly recommended!"
2652941,18810803,2014-09-01,13750304,Beverly,"Luna Park Upper was such a great space! Super clean, nice amenities -- it was an awesome place to lounge after running around Seattle all day. Plus, it's right by a bus stop that goes downtown every 15 minutes, so crazy convenient. Would love to stay here again in the future!"
2652941,19540224,2014-09-14,5669047,Jamaica,"This was a comfortable, well-stocked apartment! The neighborhood is quiet and residential, and it's a short walk to good coffee, restaurants, and a bus stop. I would definitely stay again, or recommend this apartment to friends."
2652941,19757991,2014-09-17,14691085,Julia,"Luna Park Upper is a nice apartment in a quiet area in seattle, really close to the bus (website hidden) was no problem to arrive late.we had 3 days in saettle and it was a good place from that you can explore the city."
2652941,20021411,2014-09-22,14018385,Alice,"Beautiful little getaway in a really peaceful area of West Seattle. Everything was neat, well-organized, and wonderful. The privacy and the independence of the set up was great for a weekend exploring Seattle with my boyfriend."
2652941,20262057,2014-09-26,21502469,Marta,"Nos hemos encontrado muy a gusto en casa de Laura. Hemos visto ardillas en el jardín, que es muy bonito. La casa muy acogedora y el vecindario muy tranquilo y agradable. Nos hubiera gustado pasar más tiempo en ella. "
2652941,21440407,2014-10-17,21018389,John,Laura and Joe's place was very comfortable.  When I had questions they were easy to get ahold of and were very nice.  
2652941,21913688,2014-10-26,12743983,Danielle,"I was in town starting a new job while waiting for my house purchase to finalize and my family to arrive.  This was the perfect spot for that - and would be great as a vacation spot too.  The location is perfect!  The bus stop into downtown is less than 2 blocks away, and Alkire Beach is just up the road.  The apartment itself is super cute, fully stocked, and with a wonderful view to the east.  Laura was super responsive and everything was exactly as described.  My stay was lovely and I couldn't have asked for anything more!"
2652941,25632959,2015-01-21,24808199,Stacy,Host was great! Description was accurate. Neighborhood was cute and quaint
2652941,28814280,2015-03-30,25170120,Timothy,"Great place to stay! 
Feels like a cool small apartment you wish you had when you were in your 20s! 
Will definitely stay here again given the opportunity. "
2652941,29197135,2015-04-05,29074899,Andrea,"This listing was located on a beautiful street with an amazing backyard that my kids loved to explore. It is a small area, but it was all the space we needed. Laura responded quickly and was always welcoming. "
2652941,33885701,2015-06-01,27503925,Sai,Great location. Very comfortable stay
2652941,34476842,2015-06-08,33972948,Liz,The apartment is the perfect location to experience everything Seattle has to offer and to get around easily! The apartment was cute and clean and we would highly recommend staying there! Laura was highly responsive and extremely helpful! 
2652941,38130861,2015-07-13,16032,Steve,Nice quiet and clean home with great yard.  Not too far from downtown or the beach. 
2652941,41064079,2015-08-04,15333559,Natalie,"This quaint upstairs apartment with views of Mt Rainer was beautifully appointed. Everything that we needed to make our stay comfortable was ready for us. The linen was gorgeous and the whole interior of the place was spic and span. Something to note is if you have mobility issues there are steep stairs to the apartment and the distance to public transport, although it is not too far, it is down a hill to the bus or a 35 min walk to the water taxi. In saying this the Seattle car taxi service was inexpensive for a door to door service. I would stay again as I loved it the place.
"
2652941,45074088,2015-08-31,30915765,Kendra,"The apartment was everything I hoped for- beautifully decorated and very comfortable with a lot of amenities; Laura definitely thought of all the details! She was also a very responsive host. The place itself is in a great neighborhood; Trader Joe's and just about every kind of restaurant you'd want was within walking distance, and the rapid bus line to downtown stops just around the corner. And despite being so close to everything, the neighborhood was very quiet. I particularly enjoyed having some downtime between activities in the lush backyard. I had a great overall experience and would definitely stay here again!"
2652941,47369860,2015-09-18,38764197,Victor,Very good experience. A cute place in a great neighborhood. Host was detailed oriented which made everything easy. Everything was as listed. Glad I stayed here. 
2652941,48540236,2015-09-27,28877081,David,I felt welcome and the description of the apartment was accurate.  The neighborhood was fine.
2652941,49243273,2015-10-02,27910982,Richard,We enjoyed our stay immensely.  The  information  from the host was very helpful and the facilities  in the apartment  were also very good. We also enjoyed the  location of the apartment as it was  close to public transport. The garden was very pleasant   the  views of  Seattle were beautiful.
2652941,49508835,2015-10-04,44354968,Samantha,Luna Park Upper was a great location to experience Seattle. Laura's restaurant suggestions around the area were great. It was a short drive into the city and also fun experience to use the water taxi. The place was very clean and contained everything we needed. Would highly recommend!
2652941,50493389,2015-10-12,43544801,Colleen,"Laura's apartment is an excellent and cozy place from which to explore Seattle.  Cleanliness, attention to small details, lovely and unexpected amenities, and a great location made for a very enjoyable and comfortable stay in Seattle.  The neighborhood is quiet and laid back and located just a quick jaunt over the bridge straight to downtown.  The view of the Seattle skyline from nearby Alki beach is unmatched.  The apartment looks in person just as it does in the photos online and was just as described."
2652941,51571199,2015-10-21,45989903,Michael,"This place is a gem; a clean, private apartment within an easy bike of downtown in a nice little neighborhood.  The whole process was turnkey and the hosts gave me total privacy.  The second place below was un-occupied while I was there, but the spaces and entrances are totally private so I doubt you would notice them.  Luna Cafe is right down the street.  A fantastic experience for a businessman on a budget."
2652941,52318885,2015-10-28,42537391,Bob,The upper unit was very clean and well prepared for us.  Located in a very quiet neighborhood.  It was just as we expected.  All went well.
2652941,54024916,2015-11-15,30166996,Kyle,"Amazing AirBnB experience! Place has everything you need.  Even snacks! Well furnished.  Really great neighborhood. Easy parking. Definitely helped make my trip to Seattle, an exciting adventure!"
8171726,53330984,2015-11-08,13695586,Michael,"Excellent place! Everything went smoothly. The place slept 8 comfortably. A bit small, but not a problem since we just needed a place to crash. Very reasonably priced. Would stay again"
8150395,47238315,2015-09-16,6950845,Anja,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8150395,52911586,2015-11-02,20337646,Maddie,"Sarah's apartment is the ideal place to stay for a weekend in Seattle.  Prime location near a strip of cute restaurants and a short walk to most of Capitol Hill.  The neighborhood is convenient and interesting to walk around.  Absolutely loved her style and the space. Very beautifully decorated, cozy, and clean!  

Side note: Sarah is a wonderful host!  I did not meet her in person, but she made me feel very welcome in her home.  "
8150395,54260920,2015-11-17,34793263,Samuel,"This amazingly cute tudor home was the perfect place for my weekend get-a-away. The place was extremely cozy, with all the amenities needed. Walking distance to many of Seattle's great restaurants and bars, this place offered everything!"
8150395,54533803,2015-11-21,280973,Andrew,"This is one of the loveliest Airbnb apartments I've stayed in.  Seattle is a cool town, the location is awesome, and Sarah's communication is always punctual, helpful, and witty.  Checking in was a complete breeze and the home feels very funky and artistic.  It is exactly as it appears in pictures, probably having even more space than you realise.

I stayed alone and I was out a lot, but I think it would be a wonderful place for a romantic escape for a couple.  Many interesting books, comfortable bed and furniture, close to useful shops and amenities.  A really warm and inviting atmosphere!  There are only three things to point out - there are stairs up to the first floor, no lift; there is no TV; and it is no near the downtown area, it is in the hip Capitol Hill area.

Definitely stay here!"
8150395,55423528,2015-12-01,1098780,Brittany,"This was a lovely, very comfortable apartment. We had a wonderful time. It was clean, close to amenities and easy to get to. Would definitely recommend to anyone going to Seattle!"
8150395,56735325,2015-12-17,8264081,Wan Xing,"Beautiful apartment and great location. Easy street parking in front of the building. Sarah was kind enough to leave us a bottle of wine, which was great after a stressful trip. Highly recommend this location. "
8817038,52384870,2015-10-28,39870710,Lee,"One of the best Airbnbs we've ever stayed in! The neighborhood is incredible, exactly where we would want to live if we moved to Seattle! The home was so inviting, and the check in process was so easy. Highly recommended!!"
8817038,52663396,2015-10-31,42265553,수화,"일단 집은 매우 깨끗하고 정돈되어 있으며 마음에 들었다. 하지만 집 찾기가 쉽지 않았으며, 주소가 구글에서 찾을수 있는 주소였으면 좋겠다. 
사진에 나와있는 집은 301번지 이며 내가 찾고자 했던 집은 302번지 사진뒷집 이어서 밤에 찾아다녀야 했다. 그외엔 만족스러웠으며  10월 마지막주 밤엔 추운데 전기 스토브가 하나밖에 없어 한방은 이불속에 웅크려잤다. 마크와 브라이언은 만나지 못했다. "
8817038,53099462,2015-11-04,1535222,Alexander,"We had a great stay at Bryan & Mark's place! Bryan is a great host - very welcoming, easy going and insightful. He brought extra fire bricks and a multi-usb charger after he saw we probably have a bunch of electronic devices with us :) The stay was great, the beds soo very comfortable. The home is very nice and cosy, and you'll feel right at home the moment you enter. Highly recommended!"
8817038,53514878,2015-11-09,46563720,Amanda,"We thoroughly enjoyed our time at Ballard Sunset View. They were not kidding about the view through the living room windows! We told our hosts we were bringing our daughter and were so thankful to find a pack n play at the house waiting for us after getting in so late from our flight. That really started our trip off nicely, being accommodated to so well. The house and surrounding area are very quiet (almost too quiet for our two year old). The location was great. We had everything we needed in the kitchen, the most comfortable bed ever, and the heater worked great and quick! I highly recommend this house if you're looking to relax. Sound transfer between the first and second story seemed to be our only issue (the upstairs neighbor hearing us and vice versa). Bryan was great with communicating with us and we all left happy!"
8817038,53859394,2015-11-13,13353727,Corey,"This stay was exactly as described, and perfect. Cozy, private, and with an unexpectedly great view of the Olympics (on the one day it was clear)! 
 
I really enjoyed my stay here and will definitely head back on another Seattle visit. Hosts had great communication and made our stay perfect. "
8817038,54605686,2015-11-22,42114827,Ashley,"Excellent experience, house was perfect and the location was great! Would definitely stay here again."
8817038,55120064,2015-11-28,7510898,Mitzi,"We had a wonderful stay at Mark and Bryan's! The place was very clean with everything we needed to be comfortable! The location is also hard to beat... Very close to downtown Ballard, Queen Anne and downtown! The parking spot was very nice as well! We were traveling with two toddlers so the two bedrooms were nice for them to nap and sleep in, while my husband and I could enjoy ourselves in the living room and kitchen. We would definitely stay here again when visiting Seattle! "
8817038,55449017,2015-12-01,48175813,Michelle,The accommodations were perfect for what we needed and everything was readily available. Mark and Bryan were super responsive and made sure we had everything we needed. I would recommend this place to future travelers. 
8817038,55928943,2015-12-07,6967189,Matthew,"Bryan and Mark made us feel very welcomed. We had a total of 4 guests and the amenities are perfect for our group size. The beds were comfortable and the interior was very charming. Overall, a pleasant experience with great communication between them and I. Will repeat again."
8817038,56737432,2015-12-17,21459774,Doris,Very spacious flat with comfortable beds. Loved the fireplace! Bryan and Mark were wonderful hosts and very communicative. Thank you for the great stay! 
8817038,57044086,2015-12-21,49442319,Dan,"I loved this apartment. It is quite spacious and very clean. I am familiar with the neighborhood because I have family only one block away. The covered parking kept us dry and I really enjoyed the fantastic view from the living room. I did not have time to use the fireplace. The beds were comfy and the bath exceptionally clean. 
   Mark and Bryan and were excellent hosts and emailed me numerous times to make sure that my stay was perfect. In the kitchen were all the items one could need including ice cream in the frig ! 
   I plan to use this apartment in the future."
8817038,57645539,2015-12-28,2007778,Don,"We had a wonderful stay for 5 nights, the apartment was extremely well furnished, it looks and feels better in person than in the photos.  The walls had wonderful artwork, and the kitchen was well stocked.  Beds were very comfy, great neighborhood, great everything, best deal in Seattle!"

9727857,57277604,2015-12-23,9317147,Justin,Great place during my quick layover in Seattle! Convenient location close to  downtown. Be prepared for Seattle's hills!

6734621,35033110,2015-06-14,33457662,Sterling,"Our stay with Andrew was fantastic! We were greeted punctually with a welcome card and a bottle of Prosecco. Andrew gave us a tour of his beautiful four story home upon arrival. He then explained to us that a key code would be used for our access, which in my opinion is the easiest way. Andrew's home is in a great location, and just minutes away from downtown Seattle, as well as some of the main attractions in Seattle (Pike Place Market). The neighbors were all very friendly and we felt safe throughout our entire stay. His home was exactly as listed, and very clean. I would HIGHLY recommend his beautiful home, especially if you are with a group looking to enjoy this beautiful city. Thanks again Andrew!"
6734621,35978159,2015-06-23,26923849,Jisun,"The home and neighborhood was absolutely beautiful and Andrew was an awesome host!  He was very resourceful and provided us with suggestions on places to go and things to do while visiting Seattle.  The home was perfectly suited for our needs and was a very comfortable and relaxing experience.  I highly recommend staying in Andrew's home, you'll be glad you did!"
6734621,37788896,2015-07-10,36738326,William,The property was spacious and situated in a quiet neighborhood. Andrew was a gracious host and gave us many pointers on where to dine and visit.  We appreciate having access to a local who knows the area really well.  We had our dryer malfunction on us and he offer to came by immediately and fix it.  Overall we had a great time in Seattle.
6734621,38300135,2015-07-14,35816689,Jon,"Our family absolutely loved this place. Andrew was easy to communicate with and made sure we had everything we needed.  He made us feel welcome with a bottle of Champagne and sparkling juice. Don't worry about being close to the railroad tracks, we never even heard it. The furnishings are lovely and super clean and you couldn't ask for a better location. Will stay here again on our next trip to Seattle."
6734621,38542072,2015-07-16,5670030,Kathryn,"Andrew (and his wife) are excellent hosts. Their property is just as described in their posting. We were a group of 6 adults and 1 toddler, celebrating a family event, and the number of rooms/beds, and bathrooms were perfect! The place was really clean, and had all brand new furnishings. They have a kitchen stocked to have a proper dinner; enough plates, glasses, utensils, etc. Andrew even dropped off more cooking supplies when we met him to check in, as he knew we were going to have a catered dinner at his house. What a thoughtful guy! Nice fluffy towels were put out, as well as bath amenities. The entire family was very comfortable in this home and Andrew was very easy to communicate with before, during and after our stay. We've already thought about our return trip to Seattle and we will definitely try and rent Andrew's place again!"
6734621,39038014,2015-07-20,9908897,Stephen,"Getting Andrews house has to be the best value for your money in all of Seattle.  The house was in a great location, incredibly clean, and Andrew was very easy to communicate with.  The house surpassed expectations and is perfect for just about any trip to Seattle.  I highly recommend staying here any time it's available.  "
6734621,39416547,2015-07-23,12711714,Dan,"We loved staying here and wish we could have spent more time in the area.  This is a fabulous apartment with great amenities -- I can't fault it at all.

Andrew was very easy to deal with for booking and arrival.  He also dropped by to say Hi and gave us some great recommendations for things to do, places to go and restaurants at which to eat."
6734621,39633930,2015-07-25,121452,Kari,Andrew was a fantastic host and extremely friendly! He was very knowledgeable about the area and his recommendations of sights and resturants came in very handy. The house is amazing and accomadated 8 of us very comfortably. Would definately stay at Andrews place again and would highly recommended it. We had a car which was handy but not needed.
6734621,40115117,2015-07-28,8673570,Adrian,"My friends and I spent 3 days in Seattle and had a wonderful time thanks to Andrew and his beautiful home. It was very spacious (group of 7), clean and had everything you could need. Andrew is a great host and was super informative, gave us great tips and and made us feel very welcomed. Can't thank him enough and can't wait to visit again soon !! "
6734621,40411801,2015-07-30,34790850,Xi,"All I can say is the house is as described and prepared good, loc is in the city area, short drive to pike market, we liked the house tho. 
Downside is the owner is not as nice as the house, when we got there, he insisted to come around which we thought he was so nice that wanted to show us everything even tho I told him that we pretty much knew everything inside the house.  Later after we checked out, it turned to be that he just didn't believe what we told him and wanted to come to check the exactly ppl of what we have.  The argument started because we used a fourth bed instead of 3 beds that he asked me before we got in.  I told him that we had 6 ppl, we did have 5 adults and 1 youth and 1 toddler which does not even require admission for most attractions. He knew that when he came on the first day.  The plan was for that we only needed 3 beds that was why I told him.  but plan does change and we paid for the whole house not for beds.  after we checked out, he said that we had 8 ppl and didn't clean dishes which we cleaned everything and then left them on rack to dry.  He was asking for more money which I thought it was so unfair that he treated us that way. and he made up more person in our trip just because we used the 4th bed, again, we paid for the whole house, entire house, not bed.  So I declined his request that I need to pay him more.  So, just beware this part, and remember if anyone wants it, make sure tells him that you need as much beds as the house has.  House was good in another way.  "
6734621,40479959,2015-07-31,37374984,Ying,"House is very nice, near to downtown, we had good time in seattle. "
6734621,40923428,2015-08-03,2120575,Billy,"My friends and I had a wonderful time staying at Andrew's place. The house was beautiful, clean and spacious - plenty of room for everyone to spread out. We're so grateful of the effort that Andrew put into making sure we felt welcome, comfortable and that our stay in Seattle was memorable. Thanks - each of us look forward to our next trip up to the PNW!"
6734621,41764825,2015-08-09,35332825,Joshua,"A very amazing house and an amazing host. The first day we arrived he greeted us with lots of information about Seattle on places we should (and shouldn't) eat and how to use all types of transportation to get around Seattle. The house exceeded our expectations are the experience is even better than a lot of hotels.

There were 6 of us staying there and the house is a perfect setup for large (and even small) groups at a very affordable price. Everyone had their own bed and hot showers worked around the clock. Andrew was available at all times for questions and responded quickly to anything.

We came to Seattle for a yearly international tournament and the experience was so good we would just stay here again next time.

"
6734621,42180297,2015-08-11,38802738,Loan,We really enjoyed our stay. Andrew's condo was exactly as described. He was very responsive and provided lots of tips and reccomendations. Would stay there again next time we are in Seattle!
6734621,43254223,2015-08-18,37695421,Shaina,"Andrew left a nice welcome note and a bottle of wine for us.  He checked in with us to make sure we had gotten into the house and that all was well.  The house is in a great location.  There is a bus stop right there, and a QFC grocery, Trader Joe's and Whole Foods all within a mile and a half.  There are restaurants nearby as well as a few parks.  Being less than a ten minute drive from downtown Seattle is also great.  The house has everything we needed and was definitely spacious enough for my aunt, myself and my 3 children.  "
6734621,43666064,2015-08-21,28226052,Paula,"Andrews home was amazing. It was very clean, organized, had everything we needed to feel welcome and at home. Andrew is willing to go out of his way to provide the best experience for his airbnb visitors in Seattle. It is a very good location and I would definitely recommend his nice plate to everyone. "
6734621,45098087,2015-08-31,32618652,Vipul,"The house was in perfect condition. Andrew was even okay with us showing up before the check-in time to drop our luggage off while the house was being cleaned. He was a fantastic host and stopped by to meet everyone in person and answer any questions we had about Seattle and the Magnolia neighborhood. 

The house gives a great vacation vibe, and a comfortable/homely vibe at the same time. "
6734621,45974174,2015-09-07,39748495,David,We had a great time staying at Andrew's AirBnB! It was very clean and he was close by if we had needed anything. We would definitely stay here again and recommend others to stay with him as well!
6734621,47098716,2015-09-15,41055615,Tim,"Great location, clean and great experience! Thx Andrew."
6734621,47678778,2015-09-21,6177381,Sarah,"Andrews apartment was a dream. He gave us a warm welcome, to a new and clean apartment. He had a great local knowledge base to share and had a well stocked apartment. I stayed there with 5 colleagues and we were very comfortable. Thanks for the great stay! "
6734621,49642793,2015-10-05,6445461,Jael,"Super quiet location, easy bus ride to downtown. The house was lovely, well-equipped and spacious, perfect for large groups or families. Andrew provides friendly and personal hospitality to his guests. We would definitely stay here again. "
6734621,50759472,2015-10-14,34065018,Daniel,"First and foremost, Andrew is a wonderful host and excellent with communicating via email and phone. Thank you for that and for the bottle of prosecco.
The place is close to downtown and central to other locales. It is in a safe, residential neighborhood; however it is close to a rail yard and although not overly intrusive, we could hear some of the train activities late into the evening.
The place is modern and big as it accommodated all 8 eight of us (5 adults, 3 kids) very well. It was smartly stocked with paper products, shampoo, soap, laundry items - even the kitchen and fridge had some stock items that were very much appreciated (butter, ketchup, tea, spices). The beds were comfortable with nice linens. The parking spaces were great to have too.
The things that were lacking were:  the TVs and channel options (we didn't watch much, but it is NFL season after all) and operating the remote controls for the main TV was a bit cumbersome; some extra towels and patio furniture would have been nice; the sofa is more of a pull-out trundle so it was actually more comfortable for a single person; and it wasn't a big deal but we couldn't figure out how to turn on the jets in the whirlpool tub.
Overall, we were comfortable and pleased with our stay. "
6734621,51624385,2015-10-22,18061364,Dario,The house was inviting and comfortable. Andrew made us feel very welcomed and our stay was exactly what we wanted. 
6734621,52127361,2015-10-26,46029241,Gretchen,"This home was perfect for us -- we were three siblings and a child visiting from out of town, so the three and a half bathrooms and four bedrooms were perfect for our needs.  Each family had its own bathroom, and we had a comfortable living room, dining room and kitchen to share.  Andrew greeted us with a smile (and an adult beverage) and gave us an introduction to the house and the surrounding area.  It's a very convenient location.  The house itself was immaculate and beautifully ready for us.  I would definitely recommend this home and this host.  It's my first experience with Airbnb and it won't be my last."
6734621,53382194,2015-11-08,31214305,Ping,"We enjoyed our stay in Seattle and Andrew was a great host. He was willing to accommodate us with early check in and late check out. The beds were very comfortable and the place was well-stocked with basic supplies. It was clean and the location was close enough to downtown while being far enough to get free street parking. If you have young kids, they also have a pack and play and high chair if you need it. As a host, Andrew is well-prepared and very hospitable. Overall, a good experience and I will definitely stay here again."
6734621,54857640,2015-11-25,31119132,Kibum,It was nice and clean property in very convenient location. Me and four other friends rented the house for four days and we really enjoyed staying. 
6734621,56917484,2015-12-20,751416,Erna,"Andrew's place was great, just as shown, clean, comfortable and so welcoming!  It was easy to get in, Andrew came over to meet us, wasn't intrusive, just making sure we were OK!  It was great to be able to come home and drive into the garage, and not get out in the rain! We enjoyed the fireplace, and felt ourselves quite at home! Would love to stay again when we come back to Seattle! Thanks Andrew!"
6734621,57703310,2015-12-28,20364888,Brandon,Andrew was very easy to communicate with.  We had a small window to meet him for check-in and he was very accommodating.  The location is perfect to check out downtown Seattle as well as the other neighborhoods in the surrounding area!

4637801,41888889,2015-08-09,40516418,Stephanie,"I had a great time staying in Gus Catalano's sunny room in Seattle!  He was welcoming and polite.  He gave helpful activity and restaurant suggestions when I asked and sent me a Google map with highlighted restaurants, bars, and activities.  I requested 2 beds, and Gus was very helpful setting up my accommodations.  The house was nice, clean, and had guest shampoo & soap provided.  It was easy to come and go as I liked on my trip and any time I messaged Gus, I received a quick response.  He lived in a nice, quiet neighborhood, where I felt safe walking back at night.  The neighborhood is just north of the University in a lovely neighborhood, close to bus stops that can take you to downtown.  I would definitely recommend Gus' place as a good option if you're visiting Seattle! :)"
4637801,42339636,2015-08-12,6306339,Naomi,"Gus was a great and respectful host who provided everything we needed to feel comfortable (even snacks! Much welcome for late arrivals!). The neighborhood was very convenient to downtown and to the university, and fun to explore in itself. Many thanks to Gus for a great stay!"
4637801,42481767,2015-08-13,40537207,Everett,"Gus was really friendly when we were negotiating via text, and was happy to give us direction from the airport until entering his house.  The place is really nice and clean.  The cat is cute.  We didn't get to talk to Gus much because our schedule didn't match, but it was a pleasant stay."
4637801,42968468,2015-08-16,40827100,Hope,"For our first time using Airbnb, this process couldn't have been any smoother. Gus was extremely considerate of our ever-changing arrival time and he always responded reasonably quickly. The apartment was clean, uncluttered, and comfortable.   He also was knowledgeable about the area. The neighborhood was nice and altogether it was a wonderful trip."
4637801,45845845,2015-09-06,41675580,Terence,"Gus was very welcoming, and was easy to communicate with.  The room and house was quite clean, and a pleasure to stay in.  Thanks for the great experience!"

8339428,50982899,2015-10-16,14904816,Becca,"Valerie and her place met and exceeded expectations! One of the best AirBNBs I've ever had. She was so responsive, hospitable even - she gave me great directions on how to take public transport in from the airport and arranged to meet me at the time that made sense for me. The place looks precisely as shown (though, it does get a bit darker as the clouds come out - but suppose that's Seattle!). Really cool, hip neighborhood. Had no trouble walking outside the place and finding great coffeeshops, restaurants, etc. Walking distance to downtown and the ocean, Pike Place Market, etc. Great view of the skyline from the roof as well. Really enjoyed my stay, and would definitely look into staying at this apartment again if and when I am back in Seattle."
8339428,51510293,2015-10-20,30639959,Eyal,"Valerie was a great host from before booking her place until check out. She is very responsive and replies quickly both on airbnb and whatsapp messages.
The apartment is cozy and beautifully designed and looks just like in the photos. After giving us directions, Valerie gave us the keys and the remote to the garage in person, and she was very flexible regarding check-in and check-out hours (Our flight was at 9:45PM and she let us stay until the evening). She also texted us the WiFi info the minute we asked for it.
The apartment is in a central area with many bars, restaurants and coffee shops, 20 minutes walk from Pike Place Market.
It was very clean, and we got clean towels and linens. The bed is a little squeaky but we slept very well.
Overall I can say that we had a great first airbnb experience."
8339428,52453184,2015-10-29,47153584,Victoria,Very responsive and very accommodating with my flight landing late that night. The apartment was beautiful and cozy and I felt right at home.

8339428,55033123,2015-11-27,48641218,Sarah,Valerie was a great host and very quick to answer all of my questions. Gave us some awesome food recommendations too! Would come back for another visit :) 
8339428,55179374,2015-11-28,1599037,Charles,"Valerie's place was very clean and well-appointed. The location in the Capital Hill-area was very convenient with a wide selection of things to do and eat. My son and I stay for a night while visiting friends in Seattle and played video games all night. The couch is wonderfully comfortable. The garage parking space was also very nice to have since parking in Capital Hill can be frustrating at times.

I would definitely stay here again! Thanks Valerie!"

Thank you for allowing us the use of your home. I was very impressed by how clean it was, how fresh the linen was and how comfortable the beds are. We had a lovely time! It was great to feel like we had a home away from home, somewhere where we could relax and cook but also close to Seattle centre for sight seeing. Your garden is lovely too! Thanks again!"

The space was clean and cozy and centrally located to downtown and the airport, however, it is smaller than it appears in the photos. I traveled with 5 adults and felt a bit crammed. The house under the flight path so expect to hear planes at all hours. I would have no problem staying again with a smaller group. "

6363765,43364375,2015-08-19,9592984,John,"We had a great stay at Blair's house. The house was perfectly as described and was a charming small home. Just right for our visit! The neighborhood was quiet and completely convenient for our stay. We were able to get downtown easily, and we also explored some of the great Beacon Hill neighborhood restaurants. We would definitely stay here again next time we're in Seattle."
6363765,43679430,2015-08-21,37752555,Y,this house is pretty good near to the airport and safeway. the house is clean and quiet.
6363765,44599410,2015-08-27,33563672,Christine,"Great quiet place to stay few days in Seattle.
We had a car to go downtown. comfortables and cleaned rooms. 
That was all right."
6363765,45252698,2015-09-01,35516769,Angela,The house was very clean and well maintained.  All aspects off he house were as expected. Very pleasant experience. Will use again when back in Seattle. 
6363765,45756546,2015-09-05,43230729,Jeff,Quiet peaceful neighborhood.  All in all a Wonderful experience! 
6363765,49016571,2015-09-30,18678354,Steffi,"The house was really nice, in a nice quiet neighbourhood. But if you're looking for restaurant/bars there's nothing around really. It was spacious enough for 3 people and the view was very nice too. "
7401671,39134928,2015-07-20,38774019,Amy,"Thanks Rebecca for welcoming us into your cozy home. It felt like being in a family home , especially with Paddington your kitty. Paddington is such a cuddler.. we wanted to adopt him :) We loved all the awesome collections and funky pictures.. If we are ever in the Eastlake area and need a place, we will definitely hit you up.. and thanks for the cat tree!! xxoo Amy and Jonny"
7401671,39453933,2015-07-23,38671170,Rosemary,"Rebecca and paddington are wonderfully gracious hosts, the little studio was perfect for one night with my closest friend. We had a great time walking around the neighborhood and watching the sunset from the lake. Very friendly neighbors, wonderful views of the lake, had a great time! Thank you!!"
7401671,40025004,2015-07-27,38593556,Jessica,"Rebecca was quick to respond, apologetic for our experience and kindly refunded us for our stay. She was the highlight to this experience.  
When we got there we stepped in cat throw up on the floor, no food or water in the cat bowls. The cat is ricdulously needy and will not leave you alone or stop meowing. He also scratched me when I tried to move him off of me. He is relentless and we were not able to get any rest after driving all day. I have to say this was less than ideal and I don't believe I'm exaggerating our experience.  Besides the issues with the cat keeping us up all night we were woken up twice by people coming by, I understand maybe a friend stops by early in the morning but 3am is slightly an inconvenience. Both people seemed friendly enough but on top of everything else it was very irritating. My boyfriend and I are both covered in cat hair and were exhausted for our wedding plans the next day. Also the bathroom toliet handle was broken and we found a dead mouse. This experience was less than convenient."
7401671,41133834,2015-08-04,1319960,Victoria,"Rebecca and Paddington were wonderful hosts! She had loads of recommendations for things to see and places to eat in Seattle. Her place was small but very comfortable, clean and decorated so nicely. Paddington woke me up a couple times at night but he was very nice and super cuddly! I will definitely try to look up Rebecca next time I am in Seattle!"
7401671,41657839,2015-08-08,28117544,Larisa,"Had a great time and relived my youth living in this cozy funky little urban retreat.  Wish I had Rebecca's talent for DIY decorating and efficient use of space.  Super responsive, she anticipated all my questions and answered right away when new ones arose.  Easy to park the car for the week and just catch the bus to the UW or street car downtown (or uber in a pinch).  Enjoyed glorious strolls along the working waterfront every single evening - I lucked out on a string of sunny days and gorgeous sunsets.  After all that walking, I promptly refilled my calorie deficit at a value priced local eateries and splurged one night on steak and sushi in the harbor. Paddington the Cat is extra friendly - his antics were a big hit with my daughter during daily Skype calls back home.  Many thanks for the warm welcome and use of your quirky studio!"
7401671,42012044,2015-08-10,38349742,Tina,"Thank you for opening your space to us!  Great vibes, quiet, nice walking, love Grand Central!! Paddington was snuggly and entertaining! Thanks again! "
7401671,43113493,2015-08-17,39351787,Steven,We had a great time. Rebecca lets us know about local live music and was willing to offer any suggestions. Paddington was entertaining and loved to cuddle. 
7401671,44202685,2015-08-24,11582270,Kristopher,"Great little place in a great neighborhood.  Lots of cool restaurants and pubs around and nice and close to downtown.

We enjoyed hanging out with Paddington and having lots of cuddles with him!"

7401671,48474796,2015-09-26,11316501,Malte,"Rebecca was a very nice host. The appartment is in a very good neighbourhood. You can reach downtown easily by foot. The appartment has a really nice and fancy decoration but it is very very small.
Paddington... the cat...  he is adorable and likes to cuddel all the time. The problem was that he was alone the whole day, since we were sightseeing in Seattle. And so he needed a loooot of attention during the night. No problem when you don't need to sleep. He throws everything on the ground he can find, jumps all oder the place and rests on your head and everywhere,when he is finally tired. You can let him out, but he will comeback within three hours and wakes you up again with lots of ""meow"". The bed makes a lots of noise if you move and the shower is not in the best condition any more. 
But all together it is a nice place to stay and Paddington is a hell of a cat."
7401671,49703481,2015-10-05,35336806,Adriana,"Rebecca was a great host!  She was there when we arrived and had a lot of recommendations for while we were in Seattle.  As previously mentioned her cat, Paddington, was staying with us.  He was a really loving cat but had a lot of energy that seemed to only come out when you wanted to go to sleep.  However if you let him outside before you wanted to sleep and let him unwind he was fine.  Overall it was a great experience and we had a great weekend!"
7401671,49927305,2015-10-07,21688271,Clémence,"Really nice place to stay at Seattle, really close to downtown, easy access to transports, easy to park.
Rebecca is nice and available to answer any question!
We highly recommend it."
7401671,50715022,2015-10-13,6470171,Stephanie,"If your staying in Seattle for a few days Rebecca's place is great. Easy access, easy/free parking around back, & private entrance up the back stairs. Rebecca is very easy going and gave us some good places to check out in the city."
8411627,48974145,2015-09-29,5541396,James,"All I can say is WOW. Never slept on a temperpedic bed before and it was great.  The room was very well kept and new, clean bathroom, flat screen with Amazon Fire tv, convenient and very secure entry system and great location.  Just stay here!"
8411627,49558393,2015-10-04,3203676,Owen,"All good! Amazing modern house with excellent quality throughout, spread over 3 floors so it's really quiet. Friendly, professional host. The express bus makes it easy to get to downtown quickly."
8411627,51768457,2015-10-24,42847268,Michael,"Tik was a great host didn't see him much due to both of us being busy, but the time I did see him he gave me some great advise on moving to Seattle and it helped me in making my overall decision. Thank you Tik five stars!!!"
8411627,52121166,2015-10-26,33366755,Vicki,"My first AirBNB experience where the host was not present. Tik has a cool high tech entry system to his place. 
His communication was nearly instant every time I had a question - just the best.
We were only there long enough to spend the night and were up early to leave before 10:00am.  The bed was very comfortable. The shower was nice and hot. The whole place was squeaky clean. The high-end finishes were lovely.
We would certainly stay here again - and possibly meet the host."
8411627,55459644,2015-12-01,36383524,Sergey,"Tik's place is neat and high-tech. It's in a good location and takes about 15-20 mins to downtown Seattle. Access with a smartphone is pretty cool, especially when the host isn't home. Bed was comfortable and shower was warm. Overall a nice experience."
8411627,55704220,2015-12-04,50121933,James,"Streamlined and easy booking and entry into property. Separate bathroom and bedroom downstairs. Access to beautiful kitchen. Couldn't have asked for more. Wouldn't change anything about the property, and Tik is a cool guy as well. Won't hesitate to return."
190984,12934482,2014-05-14,1558079,Martin,"Denise was a perfect host. She responded quickly on every question and really cared about us. And her friend offered us a guided tour though Seattle. 

We heard from people before our stay that Hillman City isn't the best place, but we didn't make thes experience. The bus station to downtown is directly in on the other side of the street, as well as a nice cafe. Next door is a nice bar, and a few blocks downtown you find some nice bars and restaurants. "
190984,12958105,2014-05-15,14731487,Ole,"Denise is a friendly host and the room was nice and comfy.  Best of all, she provided a toothbrush along with the usual soap and shampoo - it so happens I'd forgotten mine."
190984,13370620,2014-05-26,715249,Julie,"We had a good experience at Denise's place. The appartment is well renovated and well equiped. Denise is full of attention and gives good information, good tips to explore Seattle. She even gave us a lift to the airport on our way back at 5.00 in the morning which was so convenient for us and so much better than a taxi!
The area is not the best if you read or listen to others, but we didńt have any trouble. It is in development, and there is a good bar, a good coffee place, and the pizza just downstairs is good value too! If you go down the streets, about 10 min. walk to Columbia city, you will find plenty of places to eat, drink or shop. 
There's a bus just accross the street going directly to the city center-about 30min."
190984,13627900,2014-06-01,1499027,James,"From the moment I booked Denise's cozy flat she was nothing but responsive and helpful. She constantly checked in with me to make sure I was doing OK. I spent the entire week as her guest and it couldn't have been better. The flat was charming and cozy, the location was great for me as I needed to take meetings all over the city and access was great to everything from here. From the flat you are close to I-90 (10min) I-5 (8min), downtown Seattle (15min), the airport (18 min), Light Rail (Columbia City) and Lake Washington/Seward Park (8min). 

Columbia City/Hilmam City are cool up-incoming neighborhoods with eclectic new restaurants, bars, shops etc. Tim Umbrella Coffee is right across the street - great coffee, wonderful staff, the shop is cozy with plenty of places to sit and work, free wifi. Right underneath the loft there is bar/restaurant, pizza place and other little boutique shops. All the businesses on the block have a neighborhood vibe and thus it's pretty quite and welcoming. There is tons of free parking and Denise even provides a parking stall off the street in the back of the building which is great. 

I hope to be back as I travel to Seattle frequently for business. Thanks Denise!"
190984,14434826,2014-06-19,15049107,Marianne,"Denise gets an A+ rating as a host.  The studio apt. was immaculate and exactly as pictured.  We loved it.  What we did not love was the absence of wifi, the steep steps up to the apt (we are seniors!) and the difficult parking lot which became quite jammed up on Saturday night.  The Union Bar on the street below was great with a great youngish crowd - definitely an asset to have a beer or eat.  Besides the parking lot issue, the street the apartment is on is not the best and may make some people uncomfortable.  Despite all that we loved the host and the apt. and would highly recommend it to any younger people traveling.  Denise was a great host and made it to easy to get keys and to leave keys. "
190984,14689223,2014-06-24,14808471,Ezra,The apartment was nice and clean. It was conveniently located near Columbia City. Denise was very thoughtful and checked up on us to make sure we had everything we needed. Thanks for hosting!
190984,15060794,2014-07-01,16337148,Lynne,"Apartment was very nice; exactly as it appears in the photo. And Denise & her son were very accommodating. 

Apartment is a bit out of the way, however, if your goal is to be centrally located in Seattle. It's about 1/2 mile walk into Columbia City, which has a number of interesting bars, restaurants & shops. But the light rail station is not in walking distance, so not sure how you'd get downtown if you didn't have a car (it's about 20 min by car, depending on traffic). Perhaps buses are easy. I didn't try that route. So location might be a consideration, depending on your situation.

On the negative side, however, the building in which the apartment is located feels very sketchy. You enter from a door on the street and climb a set of very steep stairs. (This is not a place for anyone with mobility issues!) The entry way is dingy and dirty; carpet on the steps is stained and torn.  At the top of the stairs, you enter through another door into a shabby hallway with an apartment and roof access on the left (no roof top terrace here, folks, just discarded junk). You then pass by several empty rooms on the right before coming to the door of the apartment. Access from the back parking lot via a narrow passage between two buildings is also a little sketchy. 

Once you enter the actual apartment, everything is clean and well taken care of. Bed was comfy, and room was quiet. Bathroom and kitchen were well stocked. The space is, in fact, quite charming. Despite the surroundings, I enjoyed my time in the apartment.

So what is the bottom line? Although some might view the surroundings as adding character, and it does in a way, I would not recommend this place for the faint of heart. I think the process of entering and exiting the apartment would just be too unnerving. If that sort of thing doesn't bother you, however, then you will likely find the accommodations very pleasant.  "
190984,15211781,2014-07-05,13504875,Katie,"Beware of this apartment, it is in a transitional part of town quite far outside the city center and my boyfriend and I felt so unsafe upon arrival that we cancelled our stay and got a hotel closer to Seattle. It is dirty, dingy, and in a very run down area, also the apartment is very loud and there is at least 4-5 children living in the apartment next door as well as a loud trash pick up area outside the bathroom window. Do yourself a favor and stay in a better neighboring area, we couldn't even stay one night. The owner even told us when we asked if the area was safe to ""keep our wits about us and don't look like we don't know the area."" After that we left immediately. Do not stay here!  "

190984,16120331,2014-07-22,17195675,Kyle,"Denise is great. She was exactly where she said she would be. The place was excellent. It was exactly as pictured, very clean, and spacious. The other around the apartment is great, too. Coffee shop, pizza places, and a bar. If you walk a couple blocks there are tons of things to do. I'd recommend this place to anyone.

Thanks again Denise!"
190984,16532977,2014-07-28,18683923,Timothy,"Denise met me about an hour before check-in so I could drop off my bags. This listing was everything promised - private entry, a comfortable bed and a super-convenient location for getting to downtown Seattle.

The space felt like a home, and I also enjoyed the way it was decorated - posters of beatlemania and Paul McCartney, and a frame by frame photo series of the demolition of the Kingdome.

If I were to return to Seattle, I'd happily return and stay here again."

The apartment is located in a great location; close to many bars & restaurants just a couple of blocks down within walking distance.  The apartment met and exceeded my expectations and I would definitely stay here again if it's available.  Denise is an awesome lady who knows the ""real"" Seattle and shared a lot of interesting history about the neighborhood.  Thanks Denise!

I found out when I arrived, and Denise offered me a makeshift unit instead. It was not the best of circumstances but at that point there weren't a lot of options. Denise was very nice and helpful with anything I needed, as were the people in neighbouring units. The area was great and close to columbia city that also had some good food options. It was at least a 30 minute long bus ride to get to the downtown area but the bus was right across the street and not a problem for me."
190984,20066617,2014-09-22,15993659,Tom,The flat was as expected and described. We had a great time in Seattle and Denise was there on time to provide us with keys. It's not the most ideal location for exploring but the train station has good connections and is only 15mins away.

190984,24337708,2014-12-26,12999297,Maureen,"The listing was exactly as the picture shows.  Great location for us because it was five minutes from my daughter's house.  The neighborhood was close to Columbia City where there are many nice restaurants and pubs. We met Denise upon arrival and left our bags there while she got the unit ready, we were early.  There is a supermarket close by and coffee shops.  Denise called to make sure everything was OK and took care of any problem we might have."
190984,24948628,2015-01-04,9560926,Craig,"Despite the cold and rain outside, the apartment was spacious and warm.  The bed is very comfortable and Denise made our entire visit very easy and accommodating. "
190984,25179470,2015-01-08,4679742,Dennie,"My host was prompt in answering my questions through email and came out to greet me at the property even though I arrived close to 11 pm. The room and bath are large and spacious and well-cleaned. The apartment is a part of a larger complex with several other empty large rooms used for storage. Wi-fi is only available through nearby pizza restaurant or neighbor. So be sure to ask ahead of time, Good coffee across the street, but no grocery or drug store within walking distance. So bring all you need."
190984,26346517,2015-02-09,17659248,Louisa,"There was some confusion with meeting Denise--phone/email tag and whatnot.  Once I arrived later in the evening, the bar beneath the apartment was in full swing which would have been fine if I wasn't planning on staying with my infant daughter.  The space, although very clean, also, smelled strongly of cigarette smoke.  These issues, along with the many steep stairs required to enter the space, precluded us from staying there.  When I let Denise know my issues, she did agree to refund part of the charge.
"
190984,26937195,2015-02-22,334466,Joseph,Denise is awesome! She was prompt at meeting me at the time that was convenient for me. Place is very spacious and loved how intimate is was. Location is very quiet and nights are peaceful. I loved how it is above a few business and near a bus stop. I would stay at her location again.
190984,29631336,2015-04-10,27288309,Jamie,"Denise was very welcoming and attentive to our needs, available at a moment's notice with  just a phone call. Would highly recommend her clean and charming space for your stay. With a warm and personable host, what more could you ask for? Thanks, Denise! "
190984,30224051,2015-04-19,1547252,Amy,"My husband is the one who stayed at this property, but I booked it for him. So this is his review:
Denise Gloster’s apartment was perfect for my stay in Seattle. It’s a recently re-done, very fresh studio apartment located in a convenient spot in Hillman City. It has everything you need for a nice stay. There’s a fully equipped kitchen for those who want to eat in. It has its own parking in the back but there is also public transportation. The Hillman City area is nifty.

I used it as a base for visiting with my son who lives about 15 blocks north. I really couldn’t have asked for anything easier.

Denise is a great host. She lives very close and we were able to easily and quickly meet for her to give me the keys and a tour of the apartment’s features.

I plan to stay here again.

"
190984,32061244,2015-05-13,30150317,William,Denise was great and quick to respond to questions.  She provided extra towels and linens during our stay.  The apartment was comfortable and just as described.  The neighborhood was in urban area with a lot of foot traffic but I never felt unsafe.  The (email hidden) and surrounding stores were very nice and helpful.  We would stay again next time I need to be close to the city.
190984,32859569,2015-05-22,33211254,Michael,Awesome flexible host! Super responsive. Great location.
190984,33282753,2015-05-26,31748630,Julien,"After a long drive up the coast, it was great to be so warmly greeted. Denise was there just when we said we'd arrive, and she seemed genuinely interested in making sure we had a good visit. She even checked in daily and offered suggestions."
190984,33726520,2015-05-31,30932316,Zhaowen,We had a great time in that apartment. Everything is clean and comfortable. The host is very nice to help us. 
190984,34955219,2015-06-14,8257590,Lee,"Denise waited patiently for me to get in from the airport and then was happy to share some interesting background on the neighborhood.  Nice lady.  The apartment is charming and comfortable, and perfectly located for me, walking distance to my daughter's house.  I'd certainly stay there again!"
190984,35647295,2015-06-21,30012580,Alexander,"Denise was an excellent host, and the unit was exactly as shown.  Denise gave me a little tour of the place, and also had some refreshments out for me, which I thought was really nice.  The place itself was perfect for my needs, as I only really stayed there to wind down and get to bed after days of exploring the city.  The bar underneath the apartment is also a great place to get some good food and drinks.  While first a little skeptical, what with this being my first time, the place really grew on me. Definitely a good spot if you ever head to Seattle."
190984,36291425,2015-06-27,13891698,Almudena,Denise was very friendly! We had a very awesome time in her apartment! Everything was perfect! Thank you so much for such a nice time!!! 
190984,36713162,2015-06-30,17179850,Oscar,Denise was a great host. Had a great time in Seattle and dealing with such an accommodating person made it possible. 
190984,36957839,2015-07-03,32589448,Wendy,"This was the perfect location for visiting my friend in Columbia City. Denise met me at the apartment to exchange the keys and was very friendly. Check-in and check-out was a breeze. The apartment looks exactly like the photos: clean, neat, and I love the exposed brick walls! It looks like it has a well equipped kitchen but since I had a friend nearby I didn't use the kitchen for more than drinking glasses/wine glasses. There is a great coffee shop right across the street which I went to every morning and the Columbia City neighborhood just north of Hillman has great options for dining. 

Seattle was going through a crazy heat wave (high 80s to 90+!) when I was there so like all houses in Seattle, it was hot. Denise had a fan in the apartment and checked in on me to make sure I was surviving which was very nice. If you need air conditioning in Seattle, you'll likely only find it in a big hotel chain. Seattle just isn't designed for heat! "
190984,37481877,2015-07-07,34780698,Ruth Ellen,"Denise was very responsive to our questions and needs. The apartment was conveniently located and very quiet and private for being near a busy street.  It was great to have dedicated parking.  We were in town for a family event, so most of our time was spent with family, and we spent relatively little time in the apartment."
190984,37951518,2015-07-12,11005101,Mali,"My friend and I booked this apartment months in advance and were able to contact Denise many times to ask questions or just checkin. I live in WV and I wanted to make sure the experience was a good one. She was available and quick to respond.

We could not have been happier! The apartment was exactly as described. It is an obviously urban area, but at no time were we uncomfortable or feel unsafe. The bus stop is just across the street, as Denise informed us, and runs often. There are many options for dining and drinks, including the Union Bar downstairs, where we enjoyed a fantastic meal. 

Denise and her associate made sure there were many personal touches available,  and this was so greatly appreciated. We were able to relax and enjoy ourselves immensely. There were also some travel size toiletries that were appreciated, as I forgot my toothpaste! 

The neighborhood is pretty quiet. We were not disturbed by noises outside, even though we had the windows open the entire three-night stay (Thur p.m.-Sun a.m.)

The bed and chair are comfy, the exposed brick and prints on the wall make it feel funky and charming. The kitchen is well-stocked and we were able to cook for ourselves as well as order delivery. Denise provided a fan (there was a bit of heat in the first 2 days!) which we appreciated!

Thank you, Denise for such a great experience. This was a trip of a lifetime for me, and our stay here was exceptional!"
190984,38611961,2015-07-17,34967600,Edward,"Great experience! Clean, comfortable, and cozy. Denise made sure we were definitely comfy during our stay! Loved it!"
190984,39185079,2015-07-21,35720395,Elizabeth,"My daughter and I really enjoyed our stay in the studio apartment. It was very clean and roomy, very nice. Denise was easy to contact and quick to reply to my questions. She even checked in on us to make sure our stay was comfortable. It happened to be an exceptionally hot few days during our stay. Denise was so kind as to have a new portable air conditioner installed for us by Istvan. We were so thankful!! The apartment was within walking distance to good restaurants, bakeries, a small park, etc.  It wasn't far from all of the major tourist sites as well. It was definitely a good choice for us :-)"
190984,39631445,2015-07-25,11210417,Rachel,"We didn't get the chance to meet Dennise personally and met one of her associates instead. The place was as pictured and very clean and well equipped with anything you would need. Wifi was not good - didn't work for us most of the time - I think it was the wifi from the pizza place below? The unit itself was up a very dark and a bit sketchy stairwell - I think the light was burnt out when we got there. The location makes it easy to get to and from downtown but I wouldn't say it's the best location - not the same vibe as you get being downtown or in a neighbourhood like Ballard. Columbia city is a great little area nearby though, and Seward Park is definitely worth checking out - very close! Denise was quick to respond to texts but we did have a hard time setting up a time and place to meet beforehand and unfortunately had to use long distance texts to make arrangements, but it worked out in the end! Overall we were happy with our stay and the price is hard to find anywhere else in Seattle!"
190984,39959271,2015-07-27,7524124,Pam,Neighborhood and exterior of building is run down.  Very narrow staircase up to apt. was not mentioned in ad. Pictures of exterior and staircase would be meaning full to guests.
190984,40227349,2015-07-29,35600713,Alyssa,"We arrived at the unit in the afternoon and were welcomed by Denise's associate who showed us up to the apartment. Once inside, we were excited to be staying in such a cool place. The apartment was exactly like the listing, and we loved the privacy and layout of the room. It was clean and comfortable. It was in a great location about 15 minutes outside of downtown. Easily accessible and had a nice area of restaurants in the same neighborhood. We would definitely recommend staying here! "
190984,40654173,2015-08-01,2479470,Megan,Really great place. Check-in was a breeze and everything was neat and tidy. Great coffee across the street! 
190984,41083332,2015-08-04,32436368,Sarah,"The apartment is exactly how it looks and is described on the website. Very nice and comfortable inside. The exterior and neighborhood are perhaps not the most tourist friendly, but we had no problems. It's a little far from everything if you are traveling without a car. The bar downstairs has great food and a cool vibe. We were able to walk about 10 minutes to the Colombia neighborhood and ate at an amazing Ethiopian restaurant. "
190984,41398208,2015-08-07,2190962,Tim,"The host communicated well and someone was there to meet us. The large studio apartment itself was lovely, just like in the picture, very clean and well equipped. The neighborhood is not great, but there is a good coffee shop across the street and it is somewhat near some more interesting neighborhoods. There are a lot of stairs. Parking is good. "
190984,41599739,2015-08-08,33685054,Destiny,"Apartment is exactly as pictured, very clean and tidy. Denise responds quickly to any questions you may have. The drive to downtown was very quick and convenient for us which was fantastic and where we spent the majority of our time. Check in was easy and pleasant- Istvan and Alysha are awesome and friendly! The wifi connection was spotty on all of our devices but we were trying to cram a ton of sight-seeing into a tiny amount of time so it was a non-issue for us."
190984,41976077,2015-08-10,484874,Dianne,Very clean apartment. However get a car if you are staying here or take Übers... the neighborhood didn't fee very safe to walk around in if you are by yourself
190984,42557612,2015-08-14,7690746,Jane,"I had a great stay in the studio: communication was very easy with Istvan, Denise's associate, and I would definitely stay here again.  Don't expect a stocked kitchen food-wise - there was only tea/coffee and some olive oil while I was there. The staircase/entry did leave a little to be desired but the actual apartment was very neat and clean. My one and only complaint was that there was no option provided for composting of food scraps, which should be available anywhere within Seattle city limits. "
190984,44298303,2015-08-25,9953226,Daniel,"I'd recommend a couple to stay here and likely book it again if we stay in Seattle.
This was one of the best airbnb apartments we have stayed in. Really nicely laid out. Enough space in the room, kitchen and bathroom. Good internet connection etc...

The neighborhood felt like it was up and coming (but not totally great) with some nice places to eat. 
Distance wise it is not very close to downtown, but we had a rental car to help us get to places which I felt was necessary although we did see buses and trains not too far away. 
 "
190984,45141710,2015-08-31,37178962,Barrett,"The studio was nice! Clean and homely. It was a 15 minute walk to the lightrail and only ~$20 uber ride downtown. While I did not get the opportunity to meet Denise during my stay, her associate was very accommodating and helpful."
5022572,36509202,2015-06-29,28886976,Jennifer,"If you like spacious interiors with lots of views then this is the place! My family rented the top two floors, the 4 bdrms were perfect. It was a hot hot week in Seattle but the floor AC/fan units cut the mustard and provided perfect white noise. The fans were in every room and we opened the windows for a nice draft. The upstairs outdoor deck was our go-to spot to relax and eat. Views of the lake were great and the patio furniture comfortable.
The kitchen had everything you need. Laurie even got us a new blender for morning smoothies! If you love to cook you will surely enjoy this space. The dinning table was plenty large and we utilized the baby high chair, as well as the baby dishes!
We spent most of our time relaxing in the TV room off the dinning, lots of windows, it felt like we were in a tree house. Again, we utilized the baby toys (play yard fence, exersaucer, toys, books). 
You can't beat the location!! We walked to the zoo, park, restaurants, bakery, lake- every day. There is so much to do in this neighborhood that you could have a mini-Seattle vaca without traveling downtown. The neighborhood is charming, and the streets a little steep at times but you get use to it (driveway is steep but you get use to that as well). 
Laurie is a gracious host, responsive and welcoming. I would, without hesitation, highly recommend her rental. "
5022572,43224872,2015-08-18,5099898,Jennifer,"My best friends and I had such a wonderful time celebrating my upcoming nuptials at Laurie's place. There was plenty of room for the five of us to gather or spread out, depending on our changing needs for the space. The view was lovely, the furniture and beds comfortable, and the fans in each room made it perfect for dealing with the summer weather. The house was very clean, and the kitchen user friendly. Highly recommended! "
5022572,44412028,2015-08-26,17594185,Samuel,"I thought the listing was very accurate, and mentioned that the photos didn't do it justice. it was nicer than I expected. The home was very clean, and well supplied with kitchen items, lots of extra towels, blankets, pillows, cleaning items, hangers, usable closet space. You thought of everything to make a variety of guests comfortable. The spaces offered flexible sleeping for our large family. We had some visiting family members over for meals, and all were impressed with the home.  "
5022572,45936473,2015-09-07,34995420,Deanne,"Unbelievable house with beautiful views! We were in town for my sisters wedding with my 4 kids, grandma and great grandma...... Laurie has thought of everything! I had gone to the grocery store to pick up supplies with out checking out the house first. She already had every kitchen condiment you could think of plus shampoo and soaps in each bathroom!  
So many conveniences that were greatly appreciated during the wedding madness...
The kids loved having their own area downstairs and we didn't have to hear their craziness...Lol
There was so much space to spread out that even the adults could find places to get away if they needed to do so.
We enjoyed gathering around the huge kitchen table playing cards and catching up with family.
Believe me, we are definitely booking this house again when we return to Seattle. 
Book it! You won't be disappointed!
Thank you Laurie for sharing your beautiful house with us.
The Pistocchi pack..... "
5022572,54342020,2015-11-18,6386865,Sharon,"Laurie's home was fantastic. One of the most beautiful houses I've stayed in with AirBnb for sure. We travelled to seattle for a business trip. The home comfortably fits about 7, and many more if there are couples or people sharing beds. The house is in a cute, quiet neighborhood close to shops and trails for running. A cab to downtown is about 10 minutes.

No complaints here! There are some nice touches, like heated floors and the beautiful master bedroom and bathroom. Truly a special place."
6870575,35443526,2015-06-18,18055280,Rosalind,"James' apartment was a great last minute find for us. The apartment is brand new!  It's well furnished and we had the best night sleep!

The location is perfect.  Picture this: waking up with dozens of coffee shops a stone's throw a ways. We ended up at Cafe Vita which was super unique.  We then had brunch at Skillet which was delicious.  After brunch we walked to the water tower in Volunteer Park, James recommended, which gives a 360 view from Bellevue to the Olympics.

Speaking of James, he is a great host. He met us and escorted us into the building.  He showed us the roof top patio and had great suggestions.  He was easy to communicate with and was a pretty fun guy."
6870575,36331786,2015-06-27,35023165,Shaye,"James was an amazing first experience for me on Airbnb. He made everything quick, gave me detailed information about the area, and was open to any questions at anytime during my stay! He went above and beyond to make sure I had everything I needed. I really enjoyed my time in Seattle thanks to his help and would recommend him as a host to anyone!"
6870575,38422265,2015-07-15,7439021,Alexandra,Nice clean studio flat in a cool (the coolest?) area of Seattle. James was always available to answer questions.
6870575,38675420,2015-07-17,25603081,Tim,Great place in a cool Seattle neighborhood. The building and apt seemed brand new...spotless and modern. Despite the fact he was traveling overseas at the time James was super responsive and a great host. Would love to stay here again.
6870575,38796908,2015-07-18,492445,Elena,James was very responsive and the place is super new and nice. Like staying at a hotel but with an awesome local guide! I felt lucky to be able to stay here.
6870575,39237021,2015-07-21,17582574,Alexy,"James was a fantastic host despite the fact that he was not in town on the days I was visiting.  He was easily accessible by phone, quick to reply to text messages, friendly, and made sure I had someone to contact in case I needed in-person help.  This was my first experience with Airbnb and I could not be happier.  Even more, the apartment itself was great with an ideal location for anyone wanting to get to know the city.  It's about a block and a half away from one of Seattle's bike share stations, close to bus lines, more nightlife within a 3 block radius than I could explore in months.  I would gladly recommend James and this apartment to anyone. Take a look at the view from the roof!  Thanks James!"
6870575,39443208,2015-07-23,31171563,Michael,"James was great throughout the whole process and stayed in communication the whole time.  His home was so nice, exactly as described and in a great area in Capitol Hill.  I enjoyed my stay very much and would book with James again anytime."
6870575,39975761,2015-07-27,36996063,Tim,"This was our first time using Airbnb and it was an excellent experience. James was a great host and made sure we had everything needed for a good trip. He also offered great recommendations to area restaurants, bars, and things to do. The apartment was very nice, and location ideal for exploring Seattle. I would recommend to any of my friends and family. "
6870575,40286671,2015-07-29,39373854,Alex,"Great Location, right on Pike Street. Clean well appointed apartment in a safe modern building. GREAT roof deck!! James was easy to reach and check in to make sure my arrival and check out was stress free."
6870575,40634624,2015-08-01,17174153,Senthil,"Communication is James forte. Instructions were concise and clear. He had a good list of places to visit and restaurants to try out. 
On the check-in day he made sure (he actually went the extra mile) to make sure the check-in was smooth. 
The apt was as described. It is in a clean, extremely secure and aptly furnished. 
Highly recommended."
6870575,42868362,2015-08-16,36011253,Abdulrahman,"James was an excellent host. He wrote me a list of recommendations for restaurants and cafes around the neighborhood. The apartment was even better than I expected. The building is new. I stayed there for 16 days. My favorite part was the rooftop garden, I spent hours there every day. The neighborhood was active and had a lot going on.

James was always available when I had questions, and always responded quickly.

 I would definitely recommend this place. 5/5 stars!"
6870575,43648706,2015-08-21,17107325,Courtney,"My husband and I had a great stay here during our time in Seattle. James was welcoming and attentive. Our arrival / check in process was smooth and he followed up with me during our stay to make sure we had what we needed. He also provided a great list of nearby restaurants, coffee shops, and walking suggestions. 

It was pretty warm during our stay so it was great to have the aircon in the room! I highly recommend staying here. The location is ideal to walk to downtown, yet avoids you hoteling in the touristy areas. Great neighborhood with many choices of things to do.

This was the cleanest accommodations of any airbnb I've ever stayed. Having ability to do laundry in the same room was a nice bonus. Comfy bed.

Highly recommend catching sunset on the rooftop deck. Fantastic."
6870575,44128353,2015-08-24,5882691,Diana,"James was an awesome host. The apartment was clean and modern. It sat right in the heart of the active Seattle nightlife. Thanks for a great experience, James. "
6870575,44494777,2015-08-26,30986412,Jess,"James is the best! So communicative, flexible and helpful. The place itself is lovely and really clean, also, as he says, visiting the rooftop is a must! The location is fantastic, so many good bars and restaurants nearby. I highly recommend James as a host, I'd love to stay here again next time I'm in Seattle. "
6870575,46187833,2015-09-08,30249599,Ian,"James was excellent at making me feel welcome and getting all situated and settled in the apartment. I'm somewhat unfamiliar to the area and he gave me excellent suggestions on places, restaurants, and people to meet during my stay here."
6870575,46454143,2015-09-10,8619683,Jenna,"My husband and I spent one night at James' place when we passed through Seattle on our way back from a few day on the Olympic Peninsula. Our stay here was absolutely fantastic. The apartment is clean, modern and James' attention to detail (like hotel-style toilet paper folds) makes it feel welcoming and homey. The location couldn't be better: great access to restaurants, bars, walking through the neighbourhoods and it would probably be a 15-20 minute walk to downtown. James was a great host; responsive, welcoming and had lots of helpful suggestions. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
6870575,47042862,2015-09-15,19409048,Vera,"James was a very good host, always quick to respond to requests. The apartment is new and very comfortable. The bed is wonderful.  The area provides easy access to restaurants and bookstores and is close to downtown. If you are a light sleeper, I would suggest you bring earplugs because the street is noisy at night."
6870575,47730946,2015-09-21,32429810,Tiffany,"This was my family's first experience using Airbnb and James was an excellent host and introduction to utilizing this wonderful app.  James' apartment was clean, cozy, and comfortable.  James made our first visit to Seattle easy to navigate, with helpful guidance and suggestions to make everything coordinate seamlessly.  We will be visiting Seattle frequently over the next several years (our eldest daughter will be attending Seattle U) and we will definitely be contacting James again when we return!  Mahalo nui loa for a memorable experience James!  Aloha a hui hou!"
6870575,48705977,2015-09-28,4837621,Amy,"This apartment is fantastic, and James is an excellent host. The location is unbeatable, and the rooftop patio is unbelievable. Make sure to check out the TV stations --- so so good! Thank you, James!"
6870575,49072615,2015-09-30,30606918,Lynn,"This apt is a really good place to stay. It's in capital hill, I was lived in Seattle before about two years, so I really enjoy it. This is a studio with very safety security, I really like the roof top views, I can enjoy the sunset and Seattle's night view. The room is really clean, sweet and comfortable. I really highly recommend more people to live in here. "
6870575,49490216,2015-10-04,28468878,Andrew,"Great apartment and great location! James was very helpful, he gave lots of info regarding transportation, sights to see, etc."
6870575,49941948,2015-10-07,35814632,Matthew,"My wife, Molly, and I just stayed at James' apartment on our honeymoon. It was perfect. Before we got there, James sent us all his recommendations for the neighborhood. When we arrived, there was a bottle of wine waiting for us on the table from James. The apartment was the perfect size for us staying only a few days, knowing we would be out as much as possible. The roof was a great place to hang out and has a wonderful view. The neighborhood was awesome and had so much to do. We are big beer fans and there are so many great bars, like Unicorn and Elysian, near the apartment. It was only a short (and cheap) Uber ride to get to just about everything we wanted to do while in the city. James' kitchen was very nice to have for the night we wanted to save a little money and cook at home using food we picked up from Pike Place.  We would definitely stay here again."
6870575,50114278,2015-10-09,28309251,Ashley,"I loved staying at this apartment. The studio is adorned with modern decor and had everything we needed for our two night stay. James was a great host and is very prompt at responding! If I need to stay in a studio in this area again, I'll definitely be back! "
6870575,50562911,2015-10-12,17674878,Nathan,"I had a really nice time! James was a great host, very responsive and knowledgeable about the area! I would definitely recommend this place to a friend."
6870575,50821101,2015-10-14,23412049,Bridget,"Apartment was clean, as advertised, James was helpful when the entry process was slightly challenging. Having shampoo and conditioner, a washer-dryer in unit, and free coffee/tea and clean sheets made it a really great place to stay. Thank you James!"
6870575,50974587,2015-10-16,15518345,Yanina,"James was a great host! We didn't get to meet but he was very attentive and responsible. The studio and location were totally amazing. We were right in the center of everything, the bed was very comfortable, the studio was roomy enough for two people. Plus well decorated.

Also - rooftop fireplace to watch over the whole city? Yes please!"
6870575,51308730,2015-10-19,9564231,Benjamin,"Great location, wonderful space! James was very accessible even while traveling abroad. Thank you!"
6870575,51912323,2015-10-25,9266292,Rob,James was a super host. He communicated often and with great information. Made me feel like a welcomed guest. All the information he provided helped me in settling in easily and comfortably. He had great recommendations for places to go around his place.  
6870575,52303571,2015-10-27,41464675,George,James was a gracious and accommodating host who extremely accessible and welcoming! The property was perfect for anyone wanting an affordable yet modern spot convenient to all the awesome amenities Seattle has to offer.  
6870575,52521931,2015-10-30,6290224,Alexander,"Our Pike Street stay was fantastic, in large part to James' condo.  I would compare the place to staying at a nice a suite in an upscale hotel, which given it's location and price made it a great deal.  Everything feels brand new and was meticulously clean.  If you are one or two people looking to take full advantage of the capitol hill scene stay here."
6870575,52754971,2015-11-01,14403901,Travis,"James's place is perfectly located on Capitol Hill. It was clean and nicely appointed—perfect for 1 or a couple for a weekend.

James was very flexible on arrival (we arrived around 10pm) and attentive with answers, and had plenty of tips for navigating the area.  Great place and host!"
6870575,53364824,2015-11-08,46148698,Stephen,"James and his apartment are both awesome! James is very communicate, friendly, and attentive. While I didn't meet him personally, he set up for someone else to bring us into the building. The apartment itself is just what we needed for a weekend in Seattle. It's very clean and comfortable, with all the amenities you could ask for (even a washer and drier, so you can go home with clean clothes!). The rooftop is pretty swanky too, feels like you're on top of Seattle when you're up there. Plus, it's in a great neighborhood for amazing restaurants and bars. Highly recommended."
6870575,53588272,2015-11-09,1487391,Cassandra,Fantastic stay!! Perfect location and very clean. James gave great recommendations for restaurants and bars. We would happily stay again! Thanks James!
6870575,54122038,2015-11-16,24022595,Chris,"James is clearly a professional at this and it makes this experience so much more easy, and when you stay at his locations you feel welcomed and at home. "
6870575,54464403,2015-11-20,4293293,Marc,"james was very accommodating and we had a great time in his centrally located apartment
it was equipped with all the necessary things to make a stay in Seattle perfect.
he even made the rain stop and arranged  two beautiful and clear sunny days!!!"
6870575,54551854,2015-11-21,18169394,Eric,"My stay at James's place was short. I arrived late around 10:45 and James and I communicated prior to that so he would be attentive when I arrived. Upon arrival, James buzzed me into the apartment. I went to the elevator and the apartment was unlocked and ready. The apt was spotless and I have nothing bad to say about it. It has a lofty feeling and the rooftop view is amazing. He had everything that I needed and I felt comfortable enough that if I needed something, he would be able to help right away. He even went the extra mile to invite me out. Last but not least, I took the following day to explore Seattle and I did not want to carry my Luggage around. James helped me out by taking it and holding onto
It until my adventures were over that day. I would without a doubt stay here again. "
6870575,54878334,2015-11-25,46893667,Sophia,James made the booking so easy. He responded to my emails very quickly even prior to booking. His place was exactly as seen in the pictures and I loved how he gave us great suggestions of places to eat and see. I definitely recommend anyone to stay here. 
6870575,54994207,2015-11-27,20242758,Shari,"We were greeted in the lobby as soon as we arrived and were given a brief tour of the space. The apartment was exactly as described and just what we needed. Great space for a couple visiting the city. You can't really beat the location, you can walk to anything you want/need. We even went down to Pike's Place Market (a bit of a walk, but not too bad). We really enjoyed our stay!"
6870575,55395804,2015-12-01,25854669,Kim,"This was my first time visiting Seattle, and I can say that the apartment and the location alone made it a trip to remember.  James was incredibly helpful from beginning to end and the place is immaculate. Set in a very lively neighborhood, you will never run out of things to do. All around amazing time. Next time I'm in Seattle, I'll try to stay again! :)"
6870575,56268356,2015-12-11,41703457,Katherine,James was a great host for our first airbnb experience. We enjoyed the apartment and were made to feel at home instantly. Great location and he was even kind enough to pick us up from the nearest station. Thanks again!
6870575,56760684,2015-12-17,42519939,Levi,"James was a perfect host. Although we didn't meet, he was super-friendly and easy to reach via texts and messages via the AirBnB app. This was my preferred method of communicating anyway,so it worked well for me.

The apartment was perfect for me. I was in Seattle alone on business for a few days, but this unit can accommodate 2 easily. It felt like a large, new hotel room/studio apartment, with all the amenities of home and a nice-sized kitchen for the space. Coffee was provided, fresh water in the fridge, clean towels and linens, and a convenient mini-closet arrangement. SO perfect for a biz trip! The bed is super-comfortable and the location is hard to beat! There's even a roof-deck guests may access with great views of downtown and several seating areas, one with a fire pit. Security is great with electronic door openers for the lobby, elevator area, and common roof deck.

Elysian Brewery is right across the street, and several cool shops, including record stores (Wall of Sound, Zion's Gate, Every Day) are within blocks.

PRO TIP: Visit the Lost Lake Cafe & Lounge for breakfast, then come back in the evening for a drink in the cozy window seat with a fireplace."
6870575,57153974,2015-12-22,4717142,Julie,"We had a lovely time at James place and he was a great host!  Amazing location in the heart of Capitol Hill!  His place was very welcoming, clean and had a comfy bed.  We would definitely stay there again!"
6870575,57444239,2015-12-26,1158447,Nina,James was very friendly and immediately responded to all questions. He also provided plenty of recommendations on what to check out in the neighborhood. Check-in was very easy even though we arrived very late. The apartment was very clean and in a great location. I would definitely recommend this place to others.
1136522,5928203,2013-07-22,2389526,Alicia,"My husband and I stayed here during a last minute trip to Seattle to visit friends. We really enjoyed our stay here. Melissa was very easy to work with and very accommodating. Pictures are accurate. Very clean apartment and bed is super comfortable! We had a car with us, so we found the location to be very convenient to everywhere we wanted to go. I would recommend this apartment to others.


Tips: If you are a light sleeper I would recommend sleeping with the bedroom windows closed. There is a restaurant nearby that gets early morning deliveries (5am) on certain days. With the window closed you can't hear a thing, but with it open you may get briefly disturbed by the delivery truck while it's unloading.

Also, there are a lot of really great, inexpensive restaurants right by the University. Definitely check them out if you wind up staying here."
1136522,5996583,2013-07-25,776805,Katie,"The apartment was very close to the University of Washington, and we were able to walk to multiple restaurants and stores.  Melissa was a wonderful host, and I would highly recommend this apartment to Seattle visitors."
1136522,6037032,2013-07-27,7601089,Kerissa,"Melissa was very generous to have rented out her apartment to me seeing as I was new to Airbnb had no previous reviews.  She was a very nice professional lady.  The apartment had a vast amount of space, large bed, and towels were provided.  It provided me with everything I needed and was in a good area as well that was walking distance to both U Village and The Ave as well.  Overall success!"
1136522,6282468,2013-08-06,7383431,Rudy,"Location, location, location. Perfect for us. We wanted an apartment close to the bus lines, and they are close, but so is the noise of the buses. The apartment was good, except for:
There are no table lamps, so reading as the sun sets is almost impossible,
no glasses, just two cups for drinking water,
had to ask for a second towel, since there were two of us,
kitchen is a disaster:
no pots or pans, just a large frying pan,
sink just installed, done poorly.
If Melissa would invest $50-75 in some lamps, towels and wash clothes, and pots from a 2nd hand store the apt. would be excellent."
1136522,6650788,2013-08-19,2701912,James,Melissa was a wonderful host! Very accommodating and understanding. We booked the place just hours before we moved in and she was able to act very quickly and couldn't have been more friendly. Highly recommended. 
1136522,7531159,2013-09-23,8738427,Mo,"I stayed at the Apartment visiting my daughter for three days. It is spacious and clean, as described, and Melissa made sure that I have my questions answered. She is a pleasure to work with, and I hope to stay there again during future visits. Thank you Melissa."
1136522,8096220,2013-10-15,9098504,Jacqueline,"This apartment was clean and roomy.  The host was helpful and responded quickly.  The only slight problem was a shortage of cookware/utensils in the kitchen.  Otherwise, everything was great.  We'd stay again!"
1136522,10449685,2014-02-19,970592,Matthew,Great apartment. Very convenient and clean. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Melissa's apartment.
1136522,13929051,2014-06-08,11057010,Leonard,"melissa's place is a very nice place to stay at seattle with a good price. the room is pretty clean, close to university and university village. easy access to food and buses, street parking place will take a little time to find and still ok. would  recommend this place for sure."
1136522,14131769,2014-06-12,5641961,Sandra,"Melissa made checking in and out easy.  The apt. was fine, just as described, and the neighborhood very convenient to UW. It was good to be forewarned of the traffic noise in the early hours - not a problem with the windows closed."
1136522,14974846,2014-06-30,48673,Elaine,"Melissa was great at communicating via email before we arrived...and very quick to respond when we had trouble accessing the wifi. The apartment was very clean and spacious, adequately equipped for our weekend in Seattle. Location is great - just a couple of blocks from University Village, lots of restaurants in the area (love Din Tai Fung for dumplings), and the Gilman Burke Trail is down the street if you want to go for a walk, run or bike ride. Queen Mary Tea Room is two blocks away if you want to do afternoon tea. The suite is pretty much as pictured, but definitely older than it appears and has the usual quirks of an older building. The building itself is situated on the corner of busy street (55th), so street noise can be an issue. Bring earplugs if you aren't a heavy sleeper. And if you sleep on the sleeper sofa in the living room, the blinds do not cut out much light at all. Also, the outside the building does look older and a little worn-down.
Overall, I would recommend a stay here for location, convenience and value!"
1136522,37768252,2015-07-10,29827904,Jennifer,"We arrived a little earlier than we told Melissa but she was flexible and the apartment had been ready. Unfortunately it was unusually hot in Seattle during our stay and there was only one fan but once it cooled down, sleeping at night was no problem. The traffic outside is noisy but as some other reviewers have said, it's no problem when the windows are closed (...except when its hot). The furniture was arranged in differently than in the listing picture but all the furniture is the same. Note the kitchen is equipped but no oil/salt/pepper(if you are looking for that, it was fine for us without), there was shampoo and soap but not conditioner and the place is shabbier than pictured. Melissa was timely in responding to questions and making accommodations- thanks!  Overall a pleasant experience. "
1136522,42396538,2015-08-13,35084296,Edith,"I stayed in the Ravenna apartment for a month. The place is clean, bright, airy and spacious, it looks just like the photo shown and even better since Melissa rearranged the furniture and replaced the TV with a flat screen one. The location is convenient, there are a couple restaurants cross street; just 10 minutes walk from U-village; bus line is around the corner; zip car is right down stairs.  My neighbors are very quiet, the sound comes mainly from the street, but when you close the windows, it blocks out the noise effectively. 
Melissa is very kind, knowing I moved to Seattle to find a new job, she even recommended potential firm to me, and she responsed to messages swiftly. 
This is my very first time using airbnb, and I had a very pleasant experience."
1136522,43802406,2015-08-22,2278330,David,"The apt. is pretty much as described by Melissa. It is in a great location near the University Village Mall and a nice ravine park.
The apt. is very noisy in the early morning as it is on a busy intersection & it was hot in Seattle so we had to have the windows wide open. The pull out bed in the living room is more comfortable than most sofa beds, firm enough. As a previous reviewer posted, it is bright in the morning in the living room so I needed a sleep mask.

There is an updated LCD TV in the apt. now. Melissa responded quickly when we requested more sheets & pillows as she was unaware that my sister was staying there with me. She also recommended a nearby highly rated Chinese restaurant which unfortunately when never got to try.

Given how expense Seattle is in the summer, this place was a great deal."
1136522,49099303,2015-10-01,13921126,Ximena,Great experience! Very nice location. Melissa was always reachable by phone or mail. The state of the apartment is very accurate with the pictures. It is well equipped. We stayed in this apartment for almost 40 nights and it was a very pleasant stay. We would stay there again. 
6868378,38876351,2015-07-19,35881358,Joseph,The room we rented was great! Exactly as the pictures provided had shown with numerous amenities as listed.  Ruri greeted us in front of the building and we pulled into the garage. The room was gorgeous with a view of the courtyard.  The room itself was spacious and very welcoming.  Instructions were easy to follow for checking in and checking out.  They even let us check in at 3 PM instead of 4 PM when we notified them a week before our trip.  Rooftop view of the Seattle shoreline was amazing. Would definitely recommend!
6868378,42689911,2015-08-15,15714522,Scott,Darik was very organized and the place was perfect! You can tell Darik spent a lot of time into making this the perfect AirBnB. We had our little toddler in this place and it was nearly baby-proof from the start. Everything was basically new. The place was also very clean. Perfect!
6868378,46444607,2015-09-10,782552,Ernest,"Excellent, looked brand new! Great location. "
6868378,46910271,2015-09-14,9510691,Jamie,Nice and clean apartment. Perfect location and walkable to Pike Place Market. Parking was also included which was great. I would stay here again. Thank you!
6868378,49320901,2015-10-03,11521708,Carolyne,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the condo! It was the perfect location for walking to all the downtown sites while still being located in a lively, vibrant neighborhood. The condo was lovely and was equipped with everything a person could need or want. Bruce was especially helpful during the check in process. I really liked the way he called to check on us when our flight was a little delayed. All in all it was a great experience!"
6868378,51033625,2015-10-17,25815663,Katelyn,"We had a great time in Darik's place! We were met by a helpful young man who showed us around. The place was clean, modern and perfect for our visit. Thank you!"
4395654,35942001,2015-06-23,7156948,Barbara,We enjoyed our couple of nights here. The place is just as photographed but there is peace and charm too that the photographs don't portray. 
6421243,34804140,2015-06-12,8245819,Brian,"Anna was very good at communicating information quickly. The neighborhood is great, price was great and apartment was exactly as advertised. "
6421243,35239831,2015-06-16,21507146,Dennis,"Anna's apartment is very clean, nice, and in a great location, right on the bus stop to downtown and Capitol Hill.  I even walked one day to the international district to see the neighborhoods and experience the city up close."
6421243,36027590,2015-06-24,33300833,Nicholas,"I think I was unlucky on my stay with a number of small issues starting with the initial disappointment on finding the place.  The apartment is in a bland (1970's?) concrete and pebble-dash block.  The apartment itself is at the back of the building in a basement with  a concrete stairwell which had an old discarded car radiator in it when I was there.  The front door and screen door are old and battered.  On entering the apartment there is an overwhelming damp and musty smell.  There was a can of room deodoriser provided which did clear it after I sprayed the whole apartment - but it was noticeable every time I returned to the apartment at the end of the day.  Because of the basement location there is no view whatsoever and not a lot of light.  

On the plus side, I must say that the apartment was spotlessly clean everywhere and clearly very well cared for.  The bedlinens and towels were clean, soft, fresh smelling and of good quality.  The bed was comfortable and welcoming.  Whilst there are no facilities in the immediate area, there is a bus stop immediately outside the apartment with a very good service which takes you downtonwn in 10 minutes.  

I had a few issues with the Wifi and the fridge not working but as soon as I reported this to Anna, the host, she reacted immediately to sort them out promptly.  Both she and her maintenance man were friendly, welcoming, approachable and helpful.  

This could be a pleasant apartment but the basement location, external appearance and, particularly the damp smell, combine to spoil the experience.  Overall, I thought it was very overpriced compared to other airbnb places I have booked in the same price range.
"
6421243,36716378,2015-06-30,25904371,Matt,"Great little apartment in Beacon Hill.  We loved the neighborhood (especially Tippe & Drauge) and the proximity to the light rail stop.  The apartment felt secure, and having parking for our rental car was a plus.  Without air conditioning, it was a bit warm due to Seattle's heat wave, but that seemed to be the case for every place we went.  Anna provided a box fan, and that helped out quite a bit."
6421243,37757620,2015-07-10,33796547,Vanessa,Anna made my boyfriend and I very welcome during our stay in Seattle. It was our first time in Seattle and she gave us great ideas to tour the city. She made sure we were comfortable in her place and she was available at any time if we needed anything. The apartment was exactly as described in the post. I would definitely recommend her place to any of my family or friends. Thank you Anna!
6421243,38730606,2015-07-18,24644660,Amy,The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed. We enjoyed our stay. 
6421243,39207040,2015-07-21,3968762,Sherri,"The listing was accurate and Anna was easy to coordinate with via text messaging. The apartment has all needed facilities, and is very clean. It is very small and in the basement, so on hot days it is a little stuffy; but it cools off quickly with open windows and the fan. The refrigerator is a small dorm-room style frig, and it doesn't have a freezer so no ice (which we missed on Sunday with 95 degree weather!) Overall we enjoyed our stay and the neighborhood. It is a very accessible location."
6421243,45282985,2015-09-01,39657639,Harley,"Anna's responses were prompt, polite, and though we never met face-to-face I was happy with our interactions.

The apartment itself was clean, though just a little musty smelling. Opening the window while we were there helped to air it out.

It's only a block or two away from a fire station, so we did hear the occasional set of sirens, but they were not terribly frequent and we did not notice them at all after about 10 or 11pm."
6421243,46831013,2015-09-13,18165681,Laura,Anna was very responsive to our last minute request to book.  The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed for our stay.  The bus stop was literally steps away which made it super easy to get to the heart of downtown.  We loved Oak which was a cool neighborhood restaurant and pub.  The food there was exceptionally good.  Grocery store just a few blocks away.  Great little neighborhood!
6421243,49696053,2015-10-05,44779686,Tj,A+ Anna was easy to deal with and place was great. 
6421243,52286802,2015-10-27,19382101,Christine,"Space was exactly as described. It had basic essentials and conveniently located in Beacon Hill area with good food & grocery options. Plus it was right across the street from Jefferson park which was a bonus. Everything was good and Anna was a great host, she was totally understanding and accommodating when it came to making our stay happen. 

Best,

Christine & Larry "
6421243,53571791,2015-11-09,9189583,Alexei,"Anna and Trond were very accommodating.  the unit was ready for my arrival, very clean, exactly as described.  i had some trouble with the lock and somebody came right away to fix the issue.

thanks again!"
6421243,54866994,2015-11-25,45902930,Roberto,"Anna was a great host. She helped us find our way home from the airport with great instructions. Communication with her always was efficient. The place was easy to find and in a great location near to restaurant (5-10minute). The apartment is exactly what you read, everything very clean and organize. The kitchen came useful for late coffee and soups. Overall amazing experience and would stay again next time I visit Seattle.  "
6421243,55496196,2015-12-01,31109664,Genna,Anna was very responsive with questions and concerns. The unit was clean and just as described/pictured. I would recommend it.
47196,93363,2010-09-08,211846,Derrick,"Shalini is an excellent host.  She knows the neighborhood well and can provide recommendations on where to grab a bite to eat, where to find a good cup of coffee, etc.  A nice private room and bath plus a convenient location make for a great stay.  I would not hesitate to stay at her home the next time I am visiting Seattle."
47196,100537,2010-09-19,230050,Darren,"Staying at Shalini's house was a great experience. As advertised, it's a nice room + private bath in cool residential neighborhood. There are a couple bus routes very nearby, but I walked downtown (~25 mins) almost everyday because there are excellent coffee shops on the way (Victrola, Caffe Vita) and breweries for the walk back (Elysian). Shalini also recommended trips to Fremont and Bainbridge, both a lot of fun and experiences I might have missed out on if I had stayed at a hotel. Thanks again.   "
47196,107782,2010-09-28,244956,Joshua,"My stay was very nice and quiet, Shalini is a very kind, nice host and the neighborhood is very peaceful and quiet. A good place to stay for any reason."
47196,123493,2010-10-20,232310,Maneesh,"Shalini answered all my questions over email, was prompt in her replies, and was a very welcoming host. The room was as described, and really peaceful, which is important to me, as I'm a light sleeper. 

The neighbourhood was really fun, and I enjoyed the walk to downtown. I'd definitely be back next time I'm in Seattle!"
47196,126004,2010-10-24,232310,Maneesh,"A great place to stay on my road trip along the west coast. The room was as described, and shalini was very welcoming. I appreciated the peaceful room as I'm a light sleeper. Great neighbourhood, Easy to walk downtown and back! Also appreciate shalini letting me hang out in the living room."
47196,127347,2010-10-25,268016,Eduardo,"I stayed at Shalini's place during a last minute weekend get-away in Seattle.  Shalini was patient and prompt in assisting me on how to complete my first airbnb request -- a pleasant experience!

Shalini's place is perfect for a couple or solo travelling because the room has a complete privacy from the owner's(rental first floor, living room on second, then owner's BR on the third).  The place matches the pictures posted on-line: clean, rudimentary, and in a desirable neighborhood location in Seattle. I felt safe the whole time and no problem with parking.

Plus, they are a great couple to chat with i.e., food!
I will return definitely.  

Thanks, Shalini!"
47196,136323,2010-11-09,71465,Charles,"As airbnb is a new experience for me, Shalini was always prompt in responding to my inquiries. When arriving, she had the room ready and even provided towels, a carafe of water as well as a scone. I guess she knew I was hungry!  Her room is comfortable, has an attached bathroom, and her location is within walking distance to the many restaurants, bars, and coffeehouses on Pike and Pine. Will definitely stay here again! Thanks for everything!"
47196,144575,2010-11-25,288308,Leanne,"Wonderful room, gracious hosts. It was a great experience all around. I already have a reservation to stay again!"
47196,153206,2010-12-13,299817,Carla,Shalini was a very nice and welcoming host.  Capitol Hill is a great place and she was very good at recommending places to go to eat and drink!  It's also easily accessible to downtown and different parks.    
47196,155665,2010-12-19,288308,Leanne,"Wonderful stay! Welcoming hosts, super convenient location!"
47196,157298,2010-12-22,316697,Paul,Great location.....easy stroll to Capitol Hill/Pub/Restaurants etc and 25 min walk to downtown.  Tidy on suite room.  Thanks Shalini.
47196,170195,2011-01-13,335391,Hermi & Aram,"Pleasant and thoughtful host. You'll instantly feel welcome. The location was perfect for explorers like us (walking and taking the bus everywhere), and the room was clean, quiet, and private."
47196,171767,2011-01-17,69112,Peter,"Nice place, good hosts, a comfortable room."
47196,178015,2011-02-03,368533,Alex,"Shalini was a great host, although I never met her. I was only in town for a few hours, and basically only went to her house to sleep. She was attentive and quite hospitable. She made everything very convenient. It was exactly what I was looking for, and the price was very reasonable. Would definitely look her up if I was in Seattle again."
47196,178208,2011-02-04,248910,Jennifer,"I had a great experience w/ Shalini and her partner - very friendly, took time to share a drink. Room was just what I needed, private and clean. I was in and out very quickly but would definitely stay again."
47196,202529,2011-03-18,392983,Jason,Shalini was very accommodating. She helped make my last-minute reservation very smooth and pleasant.  I felt welcomed in her home regardless of not getting a chance to sit down and visit with her. I'd definitely recommend her to others looking for a place to stay at a great location in Seattle. 
47196,219877,2011-04-07,442481,Fred,Shalini + Eric were wonderful hosts and provided a great environment. Very friendly and helpful with plenty of suggestions for places to eat or things to do.
47196,228637,2011-04-17,111481,Kirsten And Raj,Shalini and Eric were great hosts. The house is in a wonderful neighborhood. It's a great place to run and the walk to downtown is lovely. Their street is absolutely gorgeous when the cherry trees are in bloom. :)
47196,231120,2011-04-18,506322,Timothy,"Faye & I found Shalini & Eric's ground floor suite comfortable, private, and spacious enough for our 36-hour stay in Seattle. The neighborhood is close to several parks and is within walking distance of many small cafes and restaurants. If we come back in the summer months, it will be nice to open the sliding doors out into the fenced back patio!"
47196,243677,2011-04-28,498231,Suzanne,"Shalini and Eric are excellent hosts!  The room was clean and quiet and their home is in a fantastic neighborhood for exploring Seattle.   We only met them once because we were out and about the whole time, but they were very warm and engaging.  

Be sure to ask for some restaurant recommendations from them...we tried them all and were not disappointed once.  They were all places we never would have found had we stayed somewhere else!  We would definitely recommend this place to others looking to come to Seattle."
47196,292804,2011-06-01,497949,Alex,"Shalini is the most gracious host. The room was perfect -- clean, private and comfortable. The location is great, easy walks to the awesome Capitol Hill Café-trilogy: Café Presse, Caffé Vita, and Oddfellows Cafe."
47196,299719,2011-06-06,206609,James,"Shalini and Eric are wonderful hosts! The room was very clean and it's location in the house makes you feel like you are in a private hotel room with the ability to climb the stairs to make a meal in the beautiful kitchen or chat with Shalini about her favorite bars and restaurants in the neighborhood. Capitol Hill is a cute neighborhoody area away from the hustle and bustle of the hotel district, allowing for a respite that is still in walking distance from everything or you can hop on one of the many major bus lines that are blocks from Shalini's. I would highly recommend staying here if you are in Seattle and hopefully I will again too."
47196,309668,2011-06-12,488516,Julie,The perfect place to spend a week while celebrating my son's graduation from UDUB. Wonderful location and easy to come and go privately. I loved it!
47196,321992,2011-06-19,187943,Shamim,"Shalini 's location and place was ideal for my stay, conveniently close to U of W. The room itself was tastefully arranged and very cozy, and the Safeway nearby a plus. With First Hill and much of the downtown attractions not for off, it was a great starting point for some exploration and just grabbing a quick meal after a short drive. (particularly liked the happening area around Bobby Morris Field). Shalini herself was responsive and very easy to coordinate with."
47196,332155,2011-06-24,681128,Deborah,"Shalini was a warm and welcoming host and made my first Airbnb experience so easy.  Her downstairs suite was quiet, private, and comfortable - exactly what I was hoping for.  I'd be happy to stay with her on future trips to Seattle!"
47196,347111,2011-07-02,348511,Sharon,"The location was very convenient for us and having the first floor to ourselves gave us a lot of privacy.  There was a lack of places to put our things, however, since the only closet was used by the host."
47196,349946,2011-07-03,699277,Tony,"My girlfriend and I were only in town for one night so we didn't have the opportunity to meet with Shalini.  As for the room, it was small but nice.  It had everything you needed (bathroom was attached and the bottle of water was a nice touch).  Plenty of privacy.  My girlfriend left her earrings as the apartment and Shalini was nice enough to mail them back to us.  We hope to stay with Shalini in the future again."
47196,375085,2011-07-15,701979,Brian,"This was my first Airbnb stay and it went great.  I never actually met Shalini but she was answered my questions in advance of my stay.  Upon arrival, I found my room to be very comfortable and clean.  In fact the bathroom was cleaner than some bathrooms in 4-star hotels I've stayed at.  Thanks so much, Shalini...and I hope to meet you next time."
47196,390975,2011-07-23,123502,C,"Shalini was helpful, and the room was in beautiful condition when we arrived.  We never ventured upstairs as Shalini was out of the house most of our visit, but that made for a nice, private experience.  The bus system was easy to navigate with a smart phone.  "
47196,397925,2011-07-26,650209,Heather,"This was our first airbnb experience and we will definitely book more after our stay here!  Shalini was very helpful and friendly, and the room was so comfy.  We had a great stay - I wish that we had been able to visit more with Shalini but it was a busy, busy weekend!  It was the perfect location, so close that we decided to leave our bikes and walk everywhere after the first night (thanks for letting us keep them in the hallway!).
"
47196,401732,2011-07-27,865774,Tsering,"Very small but nice room. It's a street parking.Only complaint I have is if there was somekind of sign to indicate which town home it was it would've been nice. I had to ring bell two different town homes and it was wrong and very embarrasing. Finally I called and Shalini's husband came to open door. No major complain.
Major complain about the efficiency of Airbnb company itself. I emailed twice and not suppose to email frequently. I got email back from them to tell me it may take few hours before I hear from them. I had to stare at my computer pretty much all day and wasted time. It is very unpleasant experience. "
47196,405376,2011-07-29,341163,Kitty,"check-in was seamless and shalini is a very gracious host.  beautiful, clean and comfortable room!  sadly, i only got to enjoy for one night; but i will definitely want to stay here when i return to seattle again.
"
47196,414224,2011-08-02,545858,Rex,"Lovely private room and bath.  Great location, easy 10 min bus ride into downtown Seattle.  Highly recommended.  - Rex"
47196,419091,2011-08-04,677020,Staci,Shalini and Eric were wonderful to stay with. Shalini was a very accommodating and gracious hostess. My boyfriend and I would without a doubt stay with them again.
47196,436030,2011-08-11,483385,Jori/Han,"Shalini and Eric were great hosts, very friendly and helpful. The suite is very comfortable, with a good bed, and having your own bathroom is a luxioury. Its located in a nice neighbourhood. You can easily walk to downtown, although some roads are pretty steep. Very recommendable"
47196,438976,2011-08-12,655936,Laura,"Shalini is an awesome host, and I would highly recommend her place to anyone wanting to stay in Seattle. She gave us excellent directions and restaurant recommendations, and her place is just a few bus stops away from all of the touristy stuff downtown. And finally, the bed is extremely comfortable and there is a cute little patio outside. Thanks again, Shalini!"
47196,446477,2011-08-15,791886,Ken,"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle....even though we arrived very late, Shalini was accommodating and left the key and the light on...very clean and close to fast transportation to downtown.  Thanks!"
47196,456648,2011-08-18,392983,Jason,"Shalini, again, was extremely accommodating. A great stay."
47196,480539,2011-08-28,408595,Federico,"It was perfect, the bedroom, location, host, everything was great."
47196,490449,2011-08-31,807976,Natalie,"This was a perfect place to stay. Comfy, private & clean. It's in a cute neighborhood near downtown. I got in late but the place was easy to find and my room was all ready, complete with a carafe of water, wi-fi password and towels and an extra blanket. I would definitely stay again!"
47196,496799,2011-09-02,668863,Eri,"The room was really clean, so i am satisfied with this stay in Shalini's room!"
47196,506472,2011-09-06,918245,Neelanjan,"The room was clean, comfortable, and in a nice area. Everything was freshly washed and/or properly stocked, so I didn't have to worry about or ask for anything extra.

Shalini was very accommodating and helpful with tips around the area. She was also flexible in working around my difficult schedule (due to strange flying times).  "
47196,516661,2011-09-09,1098971,Mark,"Beautiful private room in Capitol hill with its own private backyard patio. But frankly, I spent all of my time wandering the streets of Seattle. Buses are steps away, it was super convenient to get around., plus, Shalini was an excellent host, very helpful and kind. "
47196,519358,2011-09-10,407256,A.T.,"Shalini's place is pretty much exactly as photographed, and it's tucked away in probably my favorite neighborhood of Seattle.

Although she wasn't around, everything was set up for me and in tip-top shape when I checked-in that night. Pleasant experience!"
47196,524243,2011-09-12,43168,Marion,Everything was great. Good location and very friendly host. 
47196,542651,2011-09-18,1001473,Stephanie,"The room was clean and the stay was nice and quiet.  I was disappointed that there was no mini-fridge, tv or blowdryer.  Renting the space is literally renting a room.  The room was on a different floor than the rest of the home, which was nice.  "
47196,554769,2011-09-21,541260,Jerry,"a quiet ,cozy studio facing backyard garden.  nice bed and bathroom, tasteful decor.  Shalini responded  positively  in getting me directions for public trans.  and allowed me to leave luggage before the checkin time.
good place in a great neighborhood.

                    Jerry   SF"
47196,568703,2011-09-26,952800,Kristine,"Shalini was really easy to reach by text.  I love texting.  Her place is new and very clean.  My room was downstairs and had it's own full bathroom, bed, desk nook and closet.  There is a nice view of the yard with trees.  It's quiet and easy to get to when traveling around the city.  It's a good neighorhood with street parking.  I would totally come back to this cute townhome.  She had a bottle of water, and toiletries available for me.  I loved it!"
47196,608378,2011-10-08,1040168,Andrea,"Great room at a great price.  Very private. Considerate host. Good location.  Quiet neighborhood with a short walk to stores and restaurants (Remedy Teas was a favorite breakfast spot).  If you like to walk, it is a pleasant trip to head down Capitol Hill into Downtown.  Just the experience I was looking for.  "
47196,638616,2011-10-17,1211658,Christy,"We chose this place because of its location, it was perfectly situated close to great restaurants and cafes. We loved the ease of parking, coming and going was quick and hassle free. We like rooms clean, basic and clutter-free just like this one. "
47196,646487,2011-10-19,179450,Jesse,"Shalini was accessible by phone and made it very easy to get into the space upon arrival. The apartment is in a really pretty neighborhood and about a 10-15 walk to many cafes, shops, and restaurants in the Capital Hill area. 

I must say that I was a bit disappointed in the lack of cleanliness of the room and bathroom when I arrived, but upon stepping out for coffee, I returned to a spotless space for the remainder of my stay.

There was also some noise associated with the cleaning upstairs which woke me up that morning, but still a good overall experience staying here. "
47196,650119,2011-10-21,726186,Andrei,"Great cozy room with a private bathroom on a quiet street, unobtrusive but helpful hosts. The only problem is that it's a bit far from downtown. If you've got a car or just using public transport/cabs, it's a great place to stay."
47196,683449,2011-11-01,1312710,Billy,"Shalini was very inviting and the space is very clean and private.
I came back to the room at all hours of the night and they didn't seem to mind so that was a great plus.
If you have a car, downtown is 5-10 min away. Really enjoyed my stay here :)"
47196,692319,2011-11-04,1265397,Rafael,"This is pretty much like a hotel room. It was very clean and exactly as advertised. The fact that you have a private patio is pretty cool, too.
There's a Safeway, a Starbucks and a YMCA just around the corner!
The only downside is that there's a warm water heater in the next room which will buzz whenever there's warm water needed in the house. I never had that during the night though.
Overall great value, would recommend a stay."
47196,711238,2011-11-12,1212769,John,"Just as advertised. Didn't meet Shalini but enjoyed the privacy. Safeway, Starbucks and Trader Joes right there! Shalini was helpful answering first- timer questions. Would definitely stay again if I needed to be in the Cap hill district."
47196,716920,2011-11-14,268048,Justin,"The room was everything we had hoped for.  It was spotless and in a very nice area of town.  Close to a lot of fun places and some good eats!  Our host was very nice and there were no problems when we had arranged for an early check in.  She was also very helpful with giving us the best directions around town. 

I would absolutely recommend renting this room if anyone is doing some Seattle traveling!   "
47196,727315,2011-11-17,1015943,Greg,I guess the best review would be that I would stay there again.  Nice private bedroom and bathroom with easy access.  What else do you need?  
47196,737574,2011-11-22,1323620,Gaby,"I loved where Shalini lived, the place is very close to all of the things I wanted to see in Seattle. The room was very nice, neat and welcoming. "
47196,751574,2011-11-28,1397729,Laurent,"I didn't get to meet Shalini, but the suite was great (clean, everything as advertised, some towels to use...)! Definitely recommended."
47196,762372,2011-12-04,1382101,Aaron,"Comfy and clean, great people, awesome location. I honestly couldn't have asked for more!"
47196,790330,2011-12-17,1238574,Ryan,"Shalini has a great place near downtown Seattle. 
Her location was close to bus station and the room was cozy and clean. Highly recommend."
47196,795768,2011-12-20,600836,Juli,"Shalini's place is fantastic! Clean, private, great location. I highly recommend it!"
47196,803483,2011-12-24,1427439,Jennifer,Shalini was such a considerate host. The room was cozy and comfortable. Capitol Hill is a lovely neighborhood and very convenient for us to get to Downtown attractions with easy access to a few bus lines. We really enjoyed our stay. :)
47196,811545,2011-12-29,1089492,Maro,"The room is small but neat and clean. We only saw Shalini on arrival, but communication was easy. We had a good stay, worth the price."
47196,816241,2011-12-30,100900,Matthew,"I was passing through Seattle moving from Vancouver, BC to San Francisco.  My errands kept me in Seattle one more day than expected and my previous Airbnb host already had another guest.  I made my request the night before and Shalini responded quickly.

She was very accommodating in terms of when I could drop by to get the key.  The suite is a bedroom and private bathroom on the first floor of her house.  The place was clean and comfortable.  Everything was exactly as advertised.

And she was kind enough to let me store some medication that required refrigeration upstairs in her fridge. "
47196,827706,2012-01-02,1539759,Michael,"The way we like to recommend any place being a restaurant or a hotel or a B&B and so on … is the fact that if we had good enough experience there to recommend it to our  family and friends, would we spend money to go back again? 
 My Girlfriend and I decided to spend our new year in Seattle, WA. We chose to stay at Shalini B&B we can only say that in our experience: It was not what we expected and we would never recommend it to any of our friends.
Shalini lacks a basic hospitality skills so much as a smile or even a simple thank you. She comes across as someone who does not care if people who chose to stay at her B&B would ever comeback to stay there again.
In her add she says the parking is included that is absolutely not true, it’s a street parking and let me tell you good luck finding an spot to park in that area.
There is a empty wine bottle in the room that is filed with tab water it does not look sanitary at all and the same goes for the bed it also does not look clean at all, thankfully we had couple of our own blankets   so we decided to use our blankets over the bed.
The bathroom was clean the townhome is quite however I can’t get over the fact that staying at Shalini B&B you feel cheated.
We loved the city of Seattle, we had such an awesome time there and we love to go back again.
"
47196,839508,2012-01-04,13607,Ariella,Shalini was an awesome host. She made us feel very welcome in their home and we were provided a great recommendation for brunch in their neighborhood (Smith in Capitol City). They offer a very comfortable bed downstairs that provides a lot of privacy. I also enjoyed this neighborhood and would recommend Shalini's place as ideal for anyone looking for a decent place to stay in Seattle.
47196,849515,2012-01-08,226924,Sarah,"We loved staying at Shalini's place. It is cozy and private, and we enjoyed all of the great restaurants and attractions within walking distance. Shalini was a responsive and unobtrusive host. Highly recommended."
47196,857032,2012-01-11,1530523,David,Shalini's place was quite nice and had good privacy. Everything was quite clean and the neighborhood is an excellent place to be to see the excitement of Seattle. Recommended.
47196,861970,2012-01-14,1560431,Floria,"We had a great time staying at Shalini's apartment. Very conveniently located, within walking distance to Pike/Pine, Stumptown, Elliot Bay, etc.  Easy access to several bus lines (about 20 minute bus ride to UW, 20 minutes to downtown).  Shalini was in touch with us, answering questions, and was very helpful. The room was clean, comfortable, and convenient!"
47196,863119,2012-01-15,54177,Jante,Shalini is a great host! Met us at the door & showed us in.  The room is cozy & the outdoor view is perfect. And it's convenient if you're gonna be out in Capitol Hill. I enjoyed my stay here!
47196,865714,2012-01-16,1540425,Megan,"Shalini was a great host and very friendly.  Room and sheets/towels were clean and the place is very central in one of my favourite neighbourhoods-lots of great restaurants nearby.

However, we found the room to not be completely soundproof-we had a long day of driving and went to bed early but we could hear Shalini and her husband quite clearly when they came home a bit later when they were not shouting or being particularly loud.  Also, the heat did not work very well.  I turned the temperature up and the fan on high but the room was still cold (then again, we were there during a snowy weekend so this wouldn't be an issue in summer).

Street parking was somewhat limited but we didn't have trouble getting a spot.  If you do have a car, downtown is only a 10 minute drive away and after."
47196,893977,2012-01-31,1537149,Karla,It was better than staying in a hotel. The Internet connection was good so I was able to watch movies online. The bed was comfortable and the room was very warm. 
47196,901515,2012-02-04,1673423,John,"First Airbnb experience -- and definitely won't be my last! Shalina was a great host and the room was clean, quiet, and had a private bathroom. Wifi was ready to go and worked perfectly. Would happily stay here again next time I need to stay in Capital Hill."
47196,911877,2012-02-10,1572051,Heather,"Shalini was responsive, professional, and kind. The room was as described. It was great to be in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. I would consider staying here again and I would recommend it to others."
47196,916511,2012-02-12,1420363,Matt,"Medium sized ground floor room and bath in a town house. Clean, quiet and well priced. Awesome host!"
47196,920865,2012-02-14,1586100,Carmen,"Absolutely loved it!  Shalini is very responsive, pleasant & a great host.  Answered all our questions quickly.  Bedroom is a little smaller than it appears in the pics but beautiful nevertheless.  Very nice, quiet, comfortable and about a 10 min bus ride from downtown attractions.  I say this room is more than reasonably priced for the quality of what your getting. Would stay here again.  Thanks Shalini! "
47196,931647,2012-02-19,1746717,Gregory,"My stay at Shalini's was a great experience. She was easy to communicate with. The room was all set up when I arrived and I found it just as advertised. It was very private, quiet, clean and comfortable. It was easy to get to, easy to find, and I had no trouble finding a parking spot. The area is very walkable, as long as you don't mind hills. I didn't get to stay long enough to explore the Capitol Hill area much, but I did see plenty of things to do, all within a short distance. I went for a run in the morning and really enjoyed the quiet residential area on the east side of the neighborhood. I definitely recommend Shalini's place."
47196,955297,2012-02-27,1682048,Dibesh,Our stay there was very pleasant. The room was cozy and neat. No disturbances and easy access to a free street parking.
47196,969726,2012-03-04,1599401,Melodie,"Shalini's place is very quiet, warm, and cozy.  Shalini is a very nice woman.  Plus, there is a patio with a garden outside the room.  Parking is easy.  Bring your own food, or be prepared to eat out.  I love the location.  It is near everything -downtow, Capital Hill, restaurants, etc..."
47196,1066512,2012-04-01,1430126,Caren,It was my first experience with airbnb and it was perfect! Shalini and Eric were great hosts. They have been so nice and caring and helped whenever I had ques-tions about taking which bus and also gave some good recommendations of bars and restaurants. The room was very clean + prepared towels and linen. Comfort-able room with a wonderful little backyard. I totally felt free to come in and out whenever I wanted and they also gave me the opportunity to use the kitchen be-cause I stayed four weeks there. It’s also a nice neighbourhood and I never felt unsafe coming home at night. You have Trader Joe’s and a Safeway nearby and also a few bus-stations. It takes you about 15 minutes to downtown and 20 min-utes to the university district by bus. I would come back at any time!!! 
47196,1125223,2012-04-13,189030,Adron,"The room is great, the area is really quiet yet just a few blocks form all the entertainment and fun of Capital Hill! I highly recommend this as a first choice when staying in Seattle!"
47196,1174702,2012-04-24,1469151,Matthew And Thao,"Shalini's room, while a little basic, was warm, comfortable, and in a nice neighbourhood. The room is also very private, if that's your thing."
47196,1187672,2012-04-27,1797890,Erin,Great accommodations and pretty easy to find.
47196,1197273,2012-04-29,2111963,Han,"Great, clean, and comfortable room in a super convenient location. Street parking was no problem. Thanks again!"
47196,1216188,2012-05-02,1898119,Dan,Room is as pictured and described.   Wifi worked.  Parking was easy.  Walking to Safeway for breakfast is super close.  There is a Starbucks inside Safeway.  I walked downtown from here but you'll definitely want to take a bus back because it's all up hill!  Capital Hill/Broadway is a ten minute walk away.  Heading down to Madison Park Docks is nice as well.
47196,1252602,2012-05-09,1936123,Suneel,Shalini's place is brilliantly located--especially if you want to be close to the heart of the action in cap hill.  The bus stop is just a few steps away if you don't want to walk all the way downtown.  The place itself is very private and having the outdoor space is awesome. Note that you don't have acces to the kitchen and the rest of the house but the trade off is amazing privacy.  Very clean and bright room. 
47196,1266492,2012-05-12,2009954,Darrel,"very nice,private, great location a short walk from downtown in a nice neighborhood.  No TV but good internet access.  

A little hard to find the first time, street numbers not that obvious on this newer, multi-family unit.  "
47196,1282235,2012-05-14,68654,Kim,"Shalani's offering is in a perfect location... very close to Capitol Hill (we parked the car and walked EVERYWHERE), in a quiet, well kept neighborhood. The room itself is lovely, with a small private lanai out back, private bathroom, and comfortable bed. 

I was in to drop my stuff, and out to explore and visit with family and friends, so I didn't get the chance to visit with Shalani. I met her briefly to say hi, clarify the key/locking procedures. I got back quite late and left fairly early the next day, all of which Shalani took in stride. I would DEFINITELY stay here again."
47196,1293814,2012-05-17,1913531,Stephen,This was my first ever AirBNB experience and it was a positive expereince to say the least. I arrived to find the room as described. Its a spare bedroom with its own bathroom attached on the ground floor of a three floor house with Shalini and her family living on the 2 floors above the room I was in. There were no other rooms on the floor I was staying. Shalini answered all my querstions on check in and said she was available to answer questions at anytime later. She works from home so was there on the other 2 times I needed assistance. At all other times she was unobtrusive. There are a number of local bus routes within 1 to 2 blocks of the house that take you staright into downtown (about 10 min ride) and at the end of the street there's a safeway supermarket and a subway restaraunt. I had no complaints at all and if I had to go back to Seattle again then I'd be looking up Shalini again.
47196,1305756,2012-05-19,2187994,Frederic,"We are a young married couple and we stayed 2 nights at Shalini place during a trip across the usa. We enjoyed our stay there: private room and bathroom, both clean, towels, and located in a quite neighborhood. We had nice discussions with shalini and eric. We recommande this place."
47196,1317896,2012-05-21,2081527,Dominic & Tilja,Shalini was a very friendly host. Her house is probably 15 minutes by bus from downtown Seattle away. The room was really nice and clean with a sweet little terrace. It's also a really quiet area and we really appreciate to stay at this room. Thank you very much again.
47196,1381987,2012-05-30,1776612,Meghan,Shalini was a great host and I really enjoyed staying in the Capitol Hill area.  The room was precisely as expected and I would certainly stay there again.
47196,1416981,2012-06-04,1004142,Craig,"We found the place, - roughly 1.5 miles from shopping area of downtown Seattle to be close enough, yet reasonably priced. Bed was clean and comfortable, but room a slight bit cramped. No TV  could be a problem for those who want to just lounge.  Perhaps owner would share common area, but we didn't expect  or ask this of her. "
47196,1436340,2012-06-08,1701474,Sidney,"Clean and convenient location (not far from downtown). Many pictures on the website for such a small room (14 m2 including bathroom), and no possibility to boil a cup of tea or refresh a drink - fortunately, Safeway is close... The good thing is : very discreet, as the room has been fitted out in the basement, close to the garage. 
The heating works well but makes a noise of humming every 15 seconds... the best we could do was to switch it off.

47196,1473569,2012-06-13,1455087,Catherine,I stayed in this simploe but lovely suite while visiting my daughter and son-in-law (their loft is too close for comfort) and loved the in-city privacy of my own wood-fenced terrace right off the room.  The suite is the only room on this floor of the house and no one else has access to the terrace so it feels like your own little world. There is a Starbucks in a Safeway less than two blocks away so it is easy to bring breakfast back to sit under the beautiful red-leafed tree.
47196,1482213,2012-06-14,2424827,Tommy,"Shalini was PERFECT for my stay. She was great with communication and so easy-going and laid back. My stay was short and I was gallivanting around the city but Shalini made it easy to show up, stay and leave on my own time since my schedule was a bit hectic.  The time I did get to see her, she was extremely friendly and accommodating.  The room was GREAT with a little walk-out patio area.  Very comfortable and private in the basement of her home.  I would definitely stay again!"
47196,1504020,2012-06-18,438281,Joshua,Shalini was very flexable with check in and check out. The room is basic but very comfortable. Walking distance to intersting parts of Pike and Pine Street.
47196,1528791,2012-06-21,824312,Andrew,"Shalini has a private suite that is perfect for lone traveller.  My wife and I shared this room and we found it a little small.  However, the location really makes up for it.  It is very private.  It is very quiet.  And it is a great place to stay if you want to be near Seattle.  Thanks again, Shalini."
47196,1545542,2012-06-23,1908,Nate,"Very much enjoyed my stay here. The host is very gracious and helpful, and the space is very inviting. I recently stayed during a business trip and I'll look forward to booking a stay here again in the future!"
47196,1598546,2012-06-30,2755672,Yvonne,"The place is clean and comfortable to stay in. The room has private toilet, which allows personal space.
The host has been friendly and responds very fast to my enquiry before i confirmed booking the place.
Location is very near Seattle downtown."
47196,1644821,2012-07-06,2740294,Raymond,Lovely little place away from the hustle and bustle of downtown. Short drive from downtown and easy parking. Place was very clean and quiet. Great for exploring seattle! would come back again! 
47196,1711226,2012-07-15,2548468,Michelle,The room was exactly what I expected.  It was perfect for me and my daughter.  The room was clean and the patio was a nice plus.  Shalini was very easy to work with and didn't seem to mind our comings and goings.  Would definitely consider staying the again.
47196,1723061,2012-07-16,629101,Jason,"Shalini was communicative and welcoming, the place was exactly as advetised/needed, and for one night it was the perfect place to lay my head!"
47196,1743742,2012-07-18,2925841,Sally,"The bedroom and bathroom were pleasant, clean and tastefully decorated. Shalini recommended Cafe Flora for a vegetarian dinner, and we had an excellent meal there. The location is good, near Trader Joe's and a short walk to the heart of the Capitol Hill commercial areas.  This was an excellent first experience with Airbnb."
47196,1786526,2012-07-24,1961557,Michaela,"Shalinis Place is just great! we stayed there 3 days and everything was easy from the booking till the goodbye. she answered real quick, was easy when we had some books delivered at hers and helped with a few thing before we arrived. she was also there when we showed up and gave us good advice where to go and about public transportation. the room itself was as you see it in the pics! superclean, cosy and calm. we slept like babys and the little outside space in front of the room was real cool (especially for smokers). it was so easy to move around seattle from her place tons of buses and things in walkable distance. the last day we were running a little late but shalini was totally cool about it and aloud us to leave our luggage at hers till we picked up our car to continue our voyage. i highly recommend her place to everyone who wants to discover seattle and needs a cosy place to sleep. and recover from busy days and nights. big thanx to shalini!!!"
47196,1835781,2012-07-30,2420904,Christine,"This was my first AirBnB experience and it worked perfectly. Everything was precisely what I expected from the description and photos on (website hidden).  The ""check-in"" and ""check-out"" was seamless. The room and bathroom seemed clean.  I was glad that I was provided a couple towels, a fresh soap bar, shampoo, and a hair dryer. There were also some disposable razors. The access to a nice, green, shaded space outdoors gave a good ""zen"" feel to it all. The neighborhood is quiet, but not far from Capitol Hill fun. I didn't have a car, so I can't comment on the parking situation."
47196,1849120,2012-07-31,2039910,Chet,"The bathroom is nice (except for the burned out lightbulb), even included shampoo! The room is tiny -- only 8-feet square -- and the bed is a standard size -- fine for one person, but too small for two. There is a wine bottle on the small table that contains water. Otherwise, no food or snacks. No TV or clock radio. The room is actually off a short hallway accessed from the main entrance to the house, used by the family, and there's no door to separate the upstairs from the downstairs where the room is located. Door to the room cannot be locked from the outside. Upstairs TV was on at 12:10 a.m. and someone was going in or out of the front door as well. An alarm sounds every time one opens or closes a door (including the patio door next to the bed, which is the only ventilation). No seating for removing shoes before entering room. Bedding appeared recently used. All in all a little wierd. The Google street view is a little misleading as street parking was at a premium. We took the only open parking space."
47196,1891002,2012-08-05,2546567,Tatjana,"The little room was exactly as expected : small but otherwise perfect. The place is decorated with good taste, feels like home and is very quiet. Having access to the backyard is great, too. The neighbourhood is pretty and you'll find everything you need in walking distance plus buses to downtown or U-District.

When I needed help, it was kindly offert and I am very grateful for that.

I spent a great 4 days at Shalini's!"
47196,1904681,2012-08-06,2984787,Jim/Phyllis,Very comfortable suite with lovely patio.  
47196,1916412,2012-08-07,2947771,Cristina,"The place is conveniently located in a beautiful residential neighborhood, it was very clean and nicely kept up, even with a cute little private back patio. Shalini was friendly and super easy to coordinate with about check in, check out, and let me leave a bag with her after check out and before my evening flight. Very satisfied and would definitely recommend staying here!
"
47196,1932916,2012-08-09,2856065,Melissa,"Clean little room on the first floor of a townhouse. Walking distance to great restos. Shalini was a great host. Very warm and welcoming, and always responsive to emails and questions. This was my first Airbnb experience and I left happy."

47196,2069848,2012-08-22,2559351,Adam,"Very nice place.  Clean, quiet, and conveniently located for all the best things in Capitol Hill.  Shalini was an excellent host and the patio was lovely.  I hope this space will be available next time I am in town."

47196,2173157,2012-09-02,278151,Greg,"Shalini has a fantastic house.  The ground floor room, with its own bathroom and access to the garden makes it feel like having your own place in the city.  A supermarket is nearby, and lots of bus routes stop close to the house, making it easy to get to the city centre in approx 15 mins.  It was about 10 min walk to get to the restaurants and bars of 15th st."
47196,2176960,2012-09-03,1831910,Becky,Convenient location. Quiet and safe neighborhood. Clean room. Comfy bed. Would stay here again!
47196,2232776,2012-09-08,3132780,Polly,"This was a perfect spot for me.  I wanted to be close to downtown Seattle but have a place to park my rental car at no cost.  I also wanted a place that was relatively private and close to public transportation.  Shalini was great at responding promptly to all my e-mails and questions, and her description of the room and bath were completely accurate, as were her responses to my questions.

I will definately stay here again when in Seattle, and would definately recommend it to others."
47196,2334003,2012-09-18,2139462,Barbara & Matthias,"Shalini's place is a good spot for going downtown Seattle - the bus stop is just around the corner and the travel time is about 10 minutes. The dinner recommendation was very tasty and we had a nice stay. Only the bed is a little bit small for 2 people - as is the room. However, it was nice to sit outside in the evening on the terrace."
47196,2562617,2012-10-09,3597702,Joseph,"Nice, clean room close to bus routes and walkable to entertainment. Check in and check out was easy as could be. Shalini is very friendly and easy to communicate with. "
47196,2582571,2012-10-11,3653391,Jessie,"We had a fabulous time in Seattle, and Shalini seems like a pro at at this!  She greeted us with the key when we arrived and showed us around, and then gave us privacy for the remainder of our stay.  The guest suite is on its own floor of the house. Bed is very comfortable and the room is cozy.  Definitely would love to stay here again someday!"
47196,2637548,2012-10-16,3818812,Matthis,"Cosy & clean room, helpful hosts.
The apartment is located in a quiet street on Capitol Hill.
Nearby you can find excellent restaurants, especially on Pine Street.
Nothing to complain about!"
47196,2752295,2012-10-29,3444884,Madhav,Clean and independent accomodation...Walking to Safeway supermarket..Value for money !!

47196,2993917,2012-11-29,12458,Charles,I didn't get to meet Shalini but her place is very nice and cozy. You have the bottom floor to yourself so you get a lot of privacy. Parking is easy to find in the area which is a plus. Safeway is just half a block down the street. I definitely would stay there again. It would be nice to have a kettle to boil hot water for tea or coffee. That was the only thing I felt I needed.
47196,3032001,2012-12-05,2649546,Chelsea,"I had a great night's stay in Shalini's home!  Shalini was warm and let me know she was available if I needed anything - she gave me a great lunch recommendation! Her home is located in a great part of Seattle, and I loved that her street was quiet and parking was always available!  The room was clean, cozy and just what I needed. Would definitely recommend it!!"

47196,3377739,2013-01-20,4331278,Brandon,"Easy location and great place to stay!  It was almost like having your own apartment due to the separation between the ground floor and the rest of the place.  Quiet, well furnished and pleasant.  Would highly recommend!"

The room has everything that you may need, you control the heating, the double bed is comfy and there is a lot of natural light coming from the patio just outside. Shalini was super diligent, kind and attentive. I highly recommend this room to any Airbnb user!"
47196,3456862,2013-02-01,4688343,Travis,"I had a great time at Shalini's place. The space was as advertised, very private and located nearby plenty of shops and public transport.

47196,3473386,2013-02-04,753151,Sidi,"I had a great stay at Shalini's. Although I didn't get to see much of Shalini, her place and the bedroom are great and the location is extremely convenient. I can't imagine getting something better for the price -- totally recommend it. "
47196,3493990,2013-02-07,3360460,Robert,"I visited on business and did not get to meet my hostess. I came in late crashed on the comfortable bed and left early. The place is close enough to downtown to walk, which I did. (parking downtown is outrageously expensive). Shalini made arrangements for me to arrive late which was great!"
47196,3720159,2013-03-08,4377326,Anwar,"It was my first time using airbnb and it was great place to stay. There is everything one would need to feel comfortable. Clean, quite,  private, comfy bed, nice patio, close to many bars and resturants, and away from the busy streets. 20 mins walk to Downtown. Shalini is a great host."
47196,3823549,2013-03-18,5300420,Mathew,"I had a very positive experience Shalini's Bed, Bath & Patio. The room was ready when I arrived and was very pleasant. The bed was very comfortable as well. The bathroom was super clean and the shower had great water pressure. And although I didn't get a chance to enjoy the patio, it looked beautiful and would be a great place to hang out on a sunny afternoon. "
47196,3835919,2013-03-19,1413898,Paula,Perfect for my one night quick trip to Seattle! The room is very quiet and private. Parking on the street was no problem.
47196,3906269,2013-03-26,4417143,Kyle,"I had a great stay at Shalini's when I was in town for a week.  The room is very private and the bed was extremely comfortable!  I wish I could have taken that mattress home with me.

Didn't use the patio, but it looked really nice.  WiFi connection is good and the shower has great pressure and hot water.  Overall, a great value if you're looking to stay in Seattle on business or pleasure and don't want to break the bank.  Thanks, Shalini!"
47196,4026870,2013-04-03,5555056,Daniel,"This was my first time using Airbnb and it was a great experience! Shalini has a wonderful, cozy place to stay within easy walking distance of all that Capitol Hill has to offer. The room was clean and ready when I arrived and Shalini was warm and friendly.  The small private patio space is an added bonus! Highly recommended! "
47196,4097355,2013-04-09,3104087,Jessica,"The location couldn't be beat! The room was clean, quiet, and complete with a folded towel & bar of soap. Akin to a private, well-kept hotel room at half the price.

Shalini wasn't home that weekend, but she was very responsive on the phone, which made us feel very well cared for. I'd recommend her place wholeheartedly, as long as you don't need any kitchen space."
47196,4375554,2013-05-01,5175355,Heather,"Shalini was a great hostess and easy to work with. This was a nice little room with sliding glass doors opening onto a lovely patio. It's located in a quiet, charming neighborhood that is close to so many attractions, restaurants and shops."
47196,4492129,2013-05-08,5569147,Qianqian,Quiet nice room in convenient location close to bus lines to downtown. We were two and did find the double bed a bit small. But overall the experience was good.
47196,4528537,2013-05-11,318871,George,"Small but clean and comfortable room in quiet city block. Easy to get to downtown and back via nearby. Large grocery store, restaurants, etc. within walking distance. I did not meet host or anyone else during my two-day stay, but I was very comfortable."
47196,4580692,2013-05-13,6132650,Susanne,"Excellent!
Comfortable room in a quiet neighborhood. Arrived after a very long journey overseas. Was happy to find a bottle of water in the room - great geasture.Went to bed - slept like a baby and left next morning. Did not meet Shalina but she provided good and fast service when e-mailing before arrival. Perfect alternative to an expensive hotel room."
47196,4684539,2013-05-20,5789772,Francesca,"We spent 3 nights at Shalini's place and I would recommend it if someone plans a weekend in Seattle! 
The location is reAlly convenient because close to many bus stations and it's super easy to rich the touristic sites of the city. 
Moreover Capitol Hill is a cozy neighborhood!!!"
47196,4729559,2013-05-22,5199295,Matthias,"We ha really a good time at Shalini Place. The area is not to far away from downtown - public traffic stops are round the corner.
Shalini was really helpful and we had really a deep and good sleep after we have arrived Seattle. We have hired a car and there was enough space on the street.
I really recommend Shalini's place.
"
47196,4764087,2013-05-24,5216968,Syuzana,"It was a great place to stay. Even though I was in Seattle only one night, I enjoyed it and would stay there longer or the next visit. The room is big enough, and it was clean as well as the bathroom. The location was convenient for me. Because of the weather I could not enjoy the patio, but I am sure it is very nice out there during warmer days. I would definitely recommend this place to friends. "
47196,4883073,2013-05-30,6560543,Paula,"I needed a room for my mother where she could smoke and not make anyone uncomfortable; Shalini was very gracious and provided my mother with a table and chair out on the patio.

Having mobility issues, my mother was very happy to have a ground floor room and private bath, and the house is on a main bus line which made the visit very pleasant and easy for her."
47196,4936552,2013-06-03,1831928,Pamela,"We really enjoyed this place.  It was so very clean and such a great location.  We appreciated that we could stay one night which was all the time we had for the weekend.  We didn't meet Shalini and the arrangements were clear, so we were fine.   P and B"

47196,5038990,2013-06-09,6306805,Erin,"Very clean place with a cozy, comfy bed. Bathroom was spotless. The shower head was up high, which was awesome as I am over 6 feet tall.I enjoyed the nice outdoor patio for dinner one evening. It was a quiet neighborhood, close to several bus line options. I felt safe as a single woman walking around. As a vegan, I appreciated having the Central Co-op market down the street as well. Shalini was very kind and helpful. She even had an iron available for my use. Affordable; would definitely stay here again."
47196,5100092,2013-06-12,2721068,Penny,The room was clean and comfy.  It was small but worked well for one person.  The bus was just a round the corner and took me everywhere I wanted to go.  This made the location work for me.  Thank you Shalini.
47196,5131454,2013-06-14,1345988,John,"Nice, private room with modern private bathroom.  Good condition, relatively clean, comfortable bed, small private patio.  Also very close to a good Safeway grocery store.   Located a bit further from downtown and from the heart of Capital Hill than I was hoping for, but the public transit is close by and is excellent.    Shalina was helpful with bus routes.  Didn't use the wi-fi, but it is available.  All in all, a good place."
47196,5205270,2013-06-18,5395075,Chuck,Convenient clean and simple with a nice private patio with plants for your enjoyment

47196,5284696,2013-06-22,6733423,Christian,"Shalinis place was perfect for my stay in Seattle. Very clean and quiet. Unfortenately I reached the place very late, so I didn't meet Shalini. But on my bedside table were travel guides of the regions I would like to see. A very nice gesture, which I appreciate."
47196,5377019,2013-06-27,5268762,Sharlina,Had a great stay in peaceful part of Seattle. Easily parked our car on the street and go around the city via walking/public transport. Room and bathroom was clean. Thanks much for the great stay!
47196,5406120,2013-06-28,7057447,Eric,"This place is great. It's easy to find, so close to so many things, spotless, and cozy. I was made To feel very welcome."
47196,5424103,2013-06-29,2357643,Nanine,Perfect location and just as described: a quiet private room with private bath and a comfortable bed. I would return and recommend without reservation. 
47196,5508460,2013-07-03,315019,Katie,"Great, affordable accommodation in Seattle. The room is on it's own floor so it feels very private, and the outdoor patio adds lots of extra space. "
47196,5575792,2013-07-07,5489542,Kayla,"When I visited Seattle, I really just needed a nice, quiet place to retreat to after long days of sight-seeing and catching up with friends in the area. This place was exactly what I needed. I especially enjoyed having my own patio area. Very relaxing. Also, Shalini was very welcoming and helpful."
47196,5780654,2013-07-16,4823060,Isun,"Shalini's place is located in a cool neighbourhood and easily approachable from the city. I used to just walk to most of the destinations around a city. The place itself is clean enough to feel comfortable. There is no access to the kitchen but as i'd seen in the previous reviews, some were given the chance to use the living room or kitchen. but when iI asked for a kettle, she said that she hasn't had nice experiences with having a boiling kettle in the room. I stayed there for 8 nights- so it was difficult not to have access to any kitchen facility , but if you're staying for a couple of nights it should be fine.

Shalini was helpful in giving me some recommendation for restaurants and cafe but the communication didn't go further than that- anyway I still appreciated the privacy that I had there. Shalini and here partner live upstairs and were not noisy really, but because of the lack of appropriate sound proof, you can hear them talking all the time. Overall, I'd recommend this place if you're staying for couple of nights not more than that  and if you're not a light sleeper like me!"
47196,5866712,2013-07-20,1762032,Patricia,"Shalini was very helpful; the room was perfect for my needs -- VERY comfortable bed and comforter, very clean and a pleasant private patio space. I would definitely choose to stay here again."
47196,5911377,2013-07-22,6745687,Alison,"Great first airbnb experience. Shalini met us as soon as we arrived, told us where to eat locally. Great place, great location"
47196,5949298,2013-07-23,1654451,Steve,Shalini has a great space in a prime part of Seattle. She was a great host with many recommendations and really easy to work with. J & I would be back there in a heartbeat.
47196,5991832,2013-07-25,1999194,Lauren,"We had an great stay at Shalini's in Capitol Hill. The room is great, very comfortable and clean. Having your own patio is a great addition. Parking was not an issue, even with the added cars from the construction around the corner. It was very easy to get around from Shalini's place. We were about a five- ten minute drive from all the main points of Seattle. Shalini gave us really great suggestions when we arrived. We would stay there again!"
47196,6023583,2013-07-27,6469742,Jacqueline,"Small but clean and comfortable room in quiet city block. Easy to get to downtown with the bus. Nice area with grocery store, restaurants, etc. within walking distance.We didn't meet host or anyone else during our two-days stay. The patio was nice, but we missed the coffee or breakfast facilities.  "
47196,6100029,2013-07-30,5144610,Marion,"Schönes ruhiges Zimmer in Super nettem viertel.der bis hält um die Ecke, Bars und Cafés in Reichweite. Shalini war sehr nett und hilfsbereit und für uns war es eine gute Wahl."

47196,6504964,2013-08-15,4026741,Guillaume,We had a very nice stay at Shalini's place. The room is pretty small but nice and we loved the access to the private backyard. Shalini was very nice and quiet. Capitol Hill is quite a nice area and a lot of restaurants and bars are just couple blocks away. Going downtown by bus was pretty fast and there is a bus stop is just 2 mns away. Many other lines within a 10-mn walk. We had a great time at Shalini's and also loved the city! We would definitely recommend this place. 
47196,6690363,2013-08-21,7594303,Russell,"My stay in Seattle was because of a trade show at the Washington Convention Center.  I wanted a clean, comfortable place within walking distance.  This was both.  I am a fast walker and it took about 25-30 minutes.  I liked that as I got my exercise in.  I had no problem parking on the street in front.  The bed is comfortable and the bathroom was clean and off the bedroom.  There is a small patio with table and two chairs, inside a fenced area.  I sat out there every evening have a beer and some snacks.  The WiFi is fast.  There is no TV or fridge or coffee pot.  I brought a cooler, but would have liked a morning cuppa, but there is plenty of coffee in Seattle.  On my walk back each night I stopped at the Trader Joe's on 17th and Madison.  There also is a Safeway nearby.  If you don't want to walk or drive there is a bus stop across from the Safeway on Madison.  All in all it met my needs very well."
47196,6722558,2013-08-22,5905955,Teresa,"Shalini's Capitol Hill Suite was perfect for my needs.  Centrally located and reasonably priced. The room was clean, quiet and private, though the parking availability was an issue as it seems to be all around Seattle these days.  No fault of Shalini's though.  Starbucks and Safeway are just a half block away for morning coffee and a pastry.  Next time I visit Seattle, Shalini's will be my first choice!

I met Shalini just once when I arrived and she was very pleasant.  The rest of the time I was able to come and go all hours of the day without disturbing the family.  "
47196,6754771,2013-08-24,7007636,Andrew,My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights. We liked that the room was on it's own level so giving us our privacy. It was an ok size with a good bathroom attached. The lack of cooking facilities wasn't an issue for us as we were only there a short while. We found we could walk to the city centre in 30 minutes or so and was a pleasant trip through the different streets. Overall we had no issues at all with this flat and would certainly recommend it. Shalini was very friendly and helpful too. 
47196,6843990,2013-08-27,6232150,Selina,"I can highly recommend staying with Shalini! It's the perfect place in a lovely neighbour hood and it's within walking distance to everything you need. Very clean and spacious, even with own patio! Shalini is a great host, caring and always helpful. I'm very impressed :)!"
47196,7113129,2013-09-07,6843294,Rosemary,"Shalilni was very welcoming and helpful. The room with ensuite bathroom and outlook onto her back garden was very quiet, private and charming. Everything was clean and tidy, even a guest soap!  It is a short bus ride into town - or a longish walk - but I enjoyed my first airbnb stay very much. Thank you Shalini!"
47196,7171755,2013-09-09,4282599,Julia,"My boyfriend and I arrived in the evening and met Shalini in the morning. She was friendly & helpful. The accommodations were clean and private. Everything was excellent and we were able to walk from there to Capitol Hill activities, Cafe Flora on Madison, great bakeries--in short, lots of great stuff within walking distance. We were able to find parking on the street on the block or within a block radius. We could sit outside on the patio and eat comfortably. It worked out just perfectly for us! We would definitely consider staying again."
47196,7206424,2013-09-10,8245359,Jessie,Great place to stay in Capital Hill. Close enough to the excitement but far enough that you experience pure peace and quiet while resting. The place was very clean and tidy. Would definitely stay there again if I get back to the Seattle area. 
47196,7224600,2013-09-11,8185191,Monique,This was a quiet and clean room with a great location! It is exactly like the description and it was just what we needed. We would defiantly stay here again if we found ourselves in Seattle again! 
47196,7296052,2013-09-14,1414641,Paul,"Shalini was a very gracious host. She met me upon my arrival (which was early) and offered to answer any questions about the area I had.

The room, which was the only room on the first floor of a 3 floor townhouse, was very clean, comfortable and offered a lot of privacy. It has its own private patio and a bath. It's not the biggest room, but it's perfect for one or two people. There's no TV, but there is wifi and power, so you can bring your own.

It's on the western side of the Capitol Hill area in a residential area - about a 10 minute walk to a lot of very good restaurants and ""funky"" retail shops and cafes along 15th and 16th streets. Public transportation crisscrosses the area, so it's a 15-20 minute bus ride downtown if you're so inclined - or about 30 minutes by foot. Be advised it is a hilly area -- the walk to downtown is mostly downhill -- which means it's uphill on the way back.

If you're interested in using Taxis, plan ahead. I learned that - except in certain areas downtown (hotels, etc.) - you can only hail a cab by calling them directly or booking via the internet. When I was there, I was unsuccessful is reaching a cab company via phone. It wasn't a problem, however, I just hopped onto a bus and got where I needed to go. 

Getting to Shalini's place from the airport is easy using public transportation. A short hop on the ""Link"" and the bus will get you there in about 45 minutes."
47196,7335245,2013-09-16,8088040,Kate,Great little place to stay in an area that is super accessible.  Highly recommend staying with Shalini!!!
47196,7537945,2013-09-23,4666353,Ian,"Although my trip in Seattle was very short, I certainly had a blast. Shalini is a great host and her location was a perfect fit. Nice neighborhood, clean room with everything you need. Go for it!"
47196,7734384,2013-10-01,6366572,Hari,"Shalini's Capitol Hill place is perfect if you are traveling by yourself, or as a couple. It is situated ideally near bus lines, and convenience stores. "
47196,7805842,2013-10-04,1393726,Aimee,Shalini's apartment was clean and comfortable. It has an ensuite bathroom patio garden and is a 15 minute bus ride from downtown Seattle.
47196,8146854,2013-10-17,9447483,Bo And Shaina,"We were looking for a place very last minute, and not only were we admitted within the hour, but we were were welcomed with open arms! Shalini was hospitable and easy to work with."
47196,8197468,2013-10-20,7952855,Cal,Shalini was a great host that covered all the bases to provide a good experience at her place. She was also helpful in giving recommendations for places to eat. The neighborhood was quiet and welcoming. 
47196,8332153,2013-10-26,8946727,Andrei,"I had a great stay at Shalini's home. The house is in a wonderful location in Capitol Hill. I highly recommend adding the restaurants Shalini suggests to your ""to do"" list, the ones I tried were fantastic!

The room is on the bottom floor and is very clean. The photos are an accurate depiction of the room. I only saw Shalini during my check in and she was kind enough to provide me with fresh water for my water bottle every day. I really enjoyed my stay here and would certainly stay here again if I were to come back to Seattle! "
47196,8741535,2013-11-15,8716259,David,"I needed a suite near the medical center and found Shalini's space perfect.  Shalini is an excellent host and was very kind and informative and the room was clean and comfortable. The BnB is located within walking distance of restaurants, groceries, theaters, and many other interests. "
47196,8767847,2013-11-17,9371931,Craig,"Shalini was very nice and helpful, the room was very comfortable and clean and nicely done, the location is really great.  I'd go back in a heartbeat, no doubt about it."
47196,8795431,2013-11-18,5300420,Mathew,"Have stayed twice, both time a great experience. "
47196,8825522,2013-11-19,9891383,Kristin,Very pleasant stay. Clean private room. I appreciated it that Shalini equipped the room with filtered water and some toiletries-- especially good because I forgot my toothpaste. 
47196,8905654,2013-11-25,7874868,Garrett,"This was a gift for my son and daughter-in-law. I can't directly comment on the room except to pass on what the children said.  They were up for an event at UW and the location was perfect and the room was as advertised 

What I can comment on is the professional manner that Shalini handled the booking. In an extremely competent manner. Everything was taken care of.  "
47196,9164736,2013-12-10,7242612,Simon,Very comfortable stay. Close to many restaurants and grocery stores. Shalini was also very accommodating to my check in times and responsive to questions I had during my stay. Would definitely book again next time I'm in Seattle!
47196,9370595,2013-12-24,8783759,Matt,"very cosy place, room exactly as advertised. Shalini is very responsive and flexible. Great stay"
47196,9509370,2013-12-31,10748600,Adam,"great room, great host! "
47196,9556636,2014-01-02,4317443,Lars,"Shalini's place is very convenient and private, with a very comfortable bed."
47196,9967683,2014-01-21,11339972,Marilyn,"This was my first experience booking through AirBNB.  It was a positive experience.  I received clear instructions re. address and entry, and I was met at the door and shown the room.  Instructions reviewed.  Any problems could be reported by texting the hostess.  The room, bathroom were clean and adequate to my needs.  Basically I wanted a comfy place to spend two nights. The computer desk was appreciated.
 The only suggestion is to report it as a town house complex, necessitating entering a gate in order to view the address, which isn't visible from the street.  That was tricky in the dark, but most folks might be getting in earlier.  There was street parking, and I had no trouble locating a spot.  
I thought the price was fair.
I would use this location again if I wanted to be in the Capitol Hill area of Seattle."
47196,10012861,2014-01-25,10349175,Ken,"I enjoyed my stay. The townhouse was located in a very safe neighborhood and complex. My room was on the first floor and very private with an attached .75 bath room as described on (website hidden). The room was clean, well lit, and very comfortable. I walked to nearby restaurants to dinner. I would recommend this place and stay here again!"
47196,10070042,2014-01-28,11334063,Lisa,"My stay with Shalini was very enjoyable, I highly recommed it. First of all, she lives in a safe and nice neighborhood, very close to Downtown, you can easily walk if you don't mind a bit of walking. But there's also a ton of bus stations around. 
Shalini was very friendly and helpful, she provided me with a tour guide for Seattle and made sure I had verything I needed, aksed if I needed recommendations, etc.
The room itself was very clean, and looked exactly like the pictures - overall a perfect experience! "
47196,10118957,2014-02-01,4274504,David,"Great place to stay as always, quiet, I sleep better here than at home! "
47196,10160521,2014-02-03,7702414,Wayne,"Very good location, central and close to many fine restaurants and interesting local shopping.  Free parking is a bonus.  The room was very clean and comfortable, with a nice ensuite and outdoor patio.  I would highly recommend this location!"
47196,10565571,2014-02-25,3361107,Molly,"It was our first trip to Seattle and I had all the spots mapped out for what I wanted to see and do, everything was in walking distance from this location and it worked out great. This spot is exactly what my husband and I were looking for - bed, bathroom and quiet. We really enjoyed our stay.

Thank you Shalini ☺"
47196,10674644,2014-03-03,3260094,Zinn,"Staying at Shalini's place on Capitol Hill was great. A good location, as it is close enough to walk to things but far enough off the main drag to be quiet during the night and have easy parking. Shalini was very friendly, came down to greet us and offer her assistance should we need any, but we didn't so she left us be and we had plenty of privacy. Because the guest suite is on the ground level, and the rest of the condo is upstairs, it was more like having a nice quiet studio all to ourselves. I will stay again next time I am in Seattle. "
47196,10909686,2014-03-12,7302505,Emre,"Shalini is an excellent host! The room was private, very comfortable and  having a patio was the best!! :)  I'm already  looking forward to my upcoming visits!! "
47196,11067590,2014-03-18,9349953,Chuong,Shalini was a very nice host and she was accomodating with our check in schedule. The room was extremely neat and clean and quiet. Free parking is a bonus. We were within minutes of great restaurants and shops. Great place to stay in Seattle!
47196,11507594,2014-04-06,8308065,Julia,"Our stay with Shalini was very nice. Although we arrived an hour too early Shalini was there to greet us and show us the room. The location was great in a nice neighboorhood, there is a supermarket and bus stop right around the corner. I would stay here again."
47196,11709017,2014-04-13,735845,Kelly,"Shalini's place is comfortable and I especially loved the bathroom and the private deck. It felt very private. It sits on a lovely street near parks, a Safeway, and many buslines, all within easy walking distance. I would stay there again."
47196,11878768,2014-04-17,64516,Ryan,"Shalini was a great host. We arrived and let ourselves in with ease and our room was all ready (even though we were 2 hours early). Great, clean and comfortable room and bathroom with cute little garden. Shalini was lovely and so helpful giving us great places to eat in the neighbourhood which we adored. Its such a lovely area to stay and 19th street only a couple of mins away is so nice. Amazing deli which is also a bar and The Kingfish restaurant was amazing. Everyone has been so friendly and welcoming."
47196,11941664,2014-04-19,1096865,Marissa,"I had a great stay at Shalini's place. The room was perfectly comfortable, and street parking convenient. Will certainly stay again if I need a place in Seattle."
47196,12140148,2014-04-23,14128867,Laura,"Clean, comfortable room with a private bathroom and private garden (although it was a bit chilly while I stayed). Shalini was prompt, kind, and easy to communicate with. I enjoyed my stay and would recommend it to others."
47196,12363693,2014-04-30,2353638,Turgay,"I had a great stay in Shalini`s place. She is a very nice host. The communication before my arrival worked perfectly and during my stay. Shalinis place was perfect for my stay in Seattle. Very clean and peaceful, nice private patio with plants for your enjoyment."
47196,12792548,2014-05-11,12970426,Kevin,"Great place in a great location!  The room was clean, quiet, cozy, and felt very private, almost like its own apartment.  It's right near a safeway, food co-op, and multiple restaurants and bars.  Street parking was easy and free!

Shalini was very accommodating and made sure I had everything I needed.  Her food recommendations were fantastic and she gave me some great insight into the area. I would definitely stay here again!"
47196,12930035,2014-05-14,14563199,Stephanie,"Shalini's place was clean and utilitarian! Located in a really cool neighborhood of Seattle and close to downtown, we had easy access to coffee shops, book shops, breweries, restaurants, etc. the neighborhood was quiet, the parking was free, room and bathroom clean, and courtyard peaceful. If you need a tv, fridge, or coffee maker in your room, this place is probably not for you, but if you are cool with the essentials (bed, desk, closet, bathroom) then you will love this quiet alcove just far enough away from the hustle and bustle of downtown, but also within walking/bus distance. Shalini makes great recommendations too. We really enjoyed the croissant at Bakery Nouveau, and pour over coffees at Victrola - all in walking distance from her place. "
47196,12974086,2014-05-16,13501227,Renee,"The room was exactly as expected with a very nice and private outdoor patio. Great location, free parking, and Shalini was very pleasant and accomodating! "
47196,13272588,2014-05-24,2207548,Trevor,Shalini was very hospitable. The place is super central & easy to find. It was also very quiet at night. 
47196,13325334,2014-05-25,2708932,Lauren,"This was the PERFECT place to stay in Seattle. It's a very private, very welcoming (a tough combo, for sure) place, and Shalini was the best host. Thank you!
"
47196,13532256,2014-05-30,4115096,Yushan,"Although I only got to meet Shalini one time, my mom and I truly enjoyed staying at her place. A week living there almost convinced us to move to Seattle (true story!), thank you so much for everything :) "
47196,13791094,2014-06-04,14959532,Elena,"Great place, clean and quiet, and Shalini is a friendly and welcoming host. Since it was sunny we could walk downtown, it took us about 40 minutes. No complains, thumbs up :)"
47196,13857870,2014-06-06,15768682,Emma,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for two nights and loved it! The room was nice (especially the patio!) but the area/neighborhood was what really did it for us. It's close enough to downtown to easily walk, but far enough away to avoid the busy-ness of a big city. We'd totally consider staying here again the next time we're in Seattle. "
47196,14210790,2014-06-14,16493635,Timothy,"We had a wonderful time at Shalini's - it's just what we needed in a great part of the city! Patio was really cool, bed was comfortable, and Shalini gave us great restaurant recommendations and was very kind!  "
47196,14227949,2014-06-15,13713177,Kynan,"We stayed with Shalini for one night and had a great experience. Shalini is a great host, the room is very clean, comfortable, quiet and in a good location (reasonable walk to downtown etc.)."
47196,14278414,2014-06-16,12646432,Kara,"Shalini was very accomodating, helpful. The room has an en suite, was clean, and in a great neighbourhood with lots going on."
47196,14467104,2014-06-20,13853570,Thomas,"We had a good time, staying at Shalini's place.
The location is good to discover the city by bus or even by foot if you're not too lazy.... ;-)
The room was small but very clean and comfy!
Shalini is a very nice host, even though we only met her twice in very short encounters, she was very friendly and welcoming."
47196,14544543,2014-06-21,5349405,Mustapha,It was a quite neighborhood in the Capitol Hill area very close to shops and restaurant and right on the bus line to downtown and the university. 
47196,14775852,2014-06-26,4785778,Suzanne,"Highly recommend this accommodation, it's exactly as advertised and very clean.  Close to downtown Seattle we used the city buses to get to/from downtown, very easy!!  Shalini was very welcoming and gave us restaurant recommendations which were excellent, thanks again!
"
47196,14964477,2014-06-30,4539621,Maria,"My other half and I stayed at Shalini's on Pride weekend. It's about a 10 block walk from Broadway and John, so it wasn't a bad walk. The neighborhood is quiet, friendly, on the bus line, and near a park. The room itself was SUPER clean and quiet. We never met Shalini, but she was very accommodating with the check-in process. I would definitely stay there again!  "
47196,15048571,2014-07-01,2334562,Justine,"The room was lovely, super clean, and very conveniently located in a gorgeous neighborhood a very pleasant walk away from a ton of restaurants and shops. We loved the little patio and the bed was very comfortable. Shalini was welcoming and willing to share restaurant recommendations and give directions. We would be happy to stay there again. "
47196,15307597,2014-07-07,13394373,Calvin,Our experience was great! The room and amenities were clean and as listed. The neighborhood was quiet and close to public transit. Our host was there to greet us when we arrived and was very nice and helpful. Thank you Shalini for making our trip a great one! 
47196,15482899,2014-07-10,3882432,Tara,"The room was just as pictured, and very clean. Excellent location close to buses that run directly downtown. I didn't spend much time in this area, but there was a Safeway grocery  store a block away that was open early and stayed open late. It was great to grab breakfast quick or a coffee. If all you need is a quiet, comfortable room located near transportation, this is the right place for you. "
47196,15629390,2014-07-13,15199080,Amy,"My boyfriend and I had a nice stay at Shalini's.  The location is within a nice neighborhood but close to bars and restaurants.  We also stumbled upon an awesome bakery in the neighborhood - Bakery Noveau.  We didn't see Shalini aside from check-in, but I'm sure she would have been helpful with recommendations if we needed them.  The room was clean and simple and just what we needed.  We had rented a car and parking was never an issue.  Overall, nice stay."
47196,15681498,2014-07-14,2628526,Kara,"I never even got to see Shalini, but she was a great communicator and everything was exactly as described in her ad.  The room was comfortable and clean and checking in and out were a breeze.  We only stayed here because we really just needed a place to stay for the night, so I can't speak much to the neighborhood, but it is in a great location of Capitol Hill in Seattle.  "
47196,15750726,2014-07-15,13934036,Margaret,"The listing was true to its description. The home is set back a ways from the street, so it feels very private. It is a suite on the main floor, and the host lives upstairs. I enjoyed having my own bathroom, bedroom (of course), and a cute little patio out back where I sat and ate my breakfast. It was an easy 20-minute walk downtown, so I didn't need a car or a bus. I was only there one night and did not see Shalini much, but that was fine. She greeted me courteously at the door on my arrival and answered all my questions then. My room was equipped with a nice glass bottle of cool water as well as towels and soap and shampoo if I had needed those. Everything was clean and in excellent condition, and I slept very well. The host had left helpful guide books about Seattle on the bedside table."
47196,15842954,2014-07-16,17119577,Samantha,Comfortable and clean in a quiet and convenient neighborhood. Check in was easy. Would definitely definitely stay there again! 
47196,15912750,2014-07-18,8478093,Benjamin,"We had a fantastic experience at Shalini's. We had no problem checking in or out, even though we arrived in town before the check in time. The room was perfectly clean and very comfortable. Even better, Shalini was an extremely warm and welcoming host, and we sincerely enjoyed meeting her and her friends. The neighborhood was convenient, right by a Safeway and not far from the hustle and bustle of Capitol Hill. We would definitely recommend this stay to anyone visiting Seattle."
47196,16057359,2014-07-21,13483840,Sriram,"Shalini's place was just as pictured: clean and comfortable bed, spotlessly clean bathroom.  It was in a convenient location although I did not spend a lot of time in the immediate neighborhood. I was coming back from the Olympic National Park to spend a few days in Seattle so I had a car. 
Finding parking on the
block was easy. Strongly recommend."
47196,16080988,2014-07-22,1492103,Lushen,"Great stay in a nice, clean, comfortable room in a nice neighborhood with bus access or a quick Uber/taxi to downtown."
47196,16238776,2014-07-23,18426665,Shu Kit,"Shalini's place was comfortable and felt like a hotel room except without a tv or a fridge which I didn't need. The place was tidy, with a good amount of space, a clean bathroom and even a towel and drinking water. It's also situated 5-7 blocks away from a street (on 15th avenue) of decently nice restaurants. There's also a Safeway/Starbucks (supermarket) 3-5 min walk away."
47196,16414381,2014-07-27,14489605,Richard,"It was great to meet Shalini, however briefly.  She was very present, very pleasant, and engaged with me very positively in regards to my questions and concerns.  A very cool person indeed.
"
47196,16605384,2014-07-30,10922639,Catherine,our host greeted us and showed us to the room...she was very pleasant and told us about where to eat and things to do in the city. she lives on the two floors above so we didn't see her at all after that. she said she didn't like forced interactions which was fine with us because neither do we. the room itself is small but clean and the patio is nice. it's about a 10 or 15 minute walk to the cooler areas of capitol hill and about a 30 minute walk to downtown so bring good shoes. :)
47196,16974937,2014-08-05,14489605,Richard,"Shalini's place was convenient, clean, and fairly quiet.  It did the trick."
47196,17206286,2014-08-09,15362183,Florian,"We had a wonderful stay at Shalini's place. The room was clean and has everything we needed. Shalini was very nice and gave us great recommendations for breakfast and dinner. We walked pretty much everywhere even though most people would probably prefer taking the car or a bus to go downtown. 
Parking is easy in the street and a Safeway supermarket is just a block away."
47196,17285288,2014-08-10,17366848,Iris,Our host was friendly and helpful. Her house is very well located in a pleasant neighborhood. The room was small but comfortable. The backyard patio was delightful. I think the space probably works best for a single person than a couple though my husband and I managed to find space for our bags. We were there only for one night. For a longer stay the space would have been too small for the two of us.
47196,17498787,2014-08-13,14198323,Jolien,"We've stayed at Shalini's place for three nights. The room was exactly as shown in the photo's: modern, clean, and all that we needed. Being able to enjoy our breakfast in the garden was a pleasant surprise. Shalini was a great host who made sure we'd find some of Seattle's nicest places. Several buslines stop nearby. "
47196,17623175,2014-08-15,1427096,Sabrina,"Shalini's place is one of the best I have stayed at so far.  It is impeccably clean and everything is in excellent condition.  There were even nice touches like a bottle of water and tourist guides left for me in the room!  The room is not large, but my traveling companion and I were perfectly happy with it and liked it for its privacy. The location is great for someone who wants a quiet, safe place to sleep while having easy access to Capitol Hill and Downtown - there are four bus lines that run regularly within a couple blocks that were all easy to reach while carrying rolling luggage.  Breakfast and coffee are within pleasant walking distance - 15th Ave, Cap Hill, and Madison Ave all have offerings. 

I will definitely put this place at the top of my list when I next visit Seattle.  Thank you, Shalini!"
47196,17766315,2014-08-17,17806378,Mazdak,"Shalini communicated extremely well with us and left us to do our own thing. Shalini was easy to deal with and had great recommendations for food + drinks. Her neighborhood is safe but a 30min walk to downtown, which was no problem for us. Listing is very accurate. "
47196,18116822,2014-08-22,436935,Mollie,"Caveat: This was my and my husband's first time using Airbnb, so we weren't entirely sure what to expect.  The listing is accurate and the room is good value for the low price.  It is a small room with a moderately comfortable bed, a full bath, and an outside patio.  The room is on the first floor of Shalini's home, and there is no door to the upstairs area, so you can hear the TV from your room when it's on.  I had earplugs, so this wasn't too much of a problem.  Instead of shampoo or soap, the bathroom is stocked with Dr. Bronner's all-purpose castile soap (which we had never used before and did not like), so we picked up some travel toiletries to use while we were there.  Shalini was extremely amenable and flexible when our train into Seattle ended up being delayed, which we very much appreciated."
47196,18433195,2014-08-26,533886,Carol & Gordon,"excellent accommodations,   just like the photo.  we came in late and it was no problem.  Shalini even had an iron in the closet !
 great coffee /breakfast a few blocks away."
47196,18675878,2014-08-30,15139948,David,Shalini was friendly and helpful.  She made great recommendations to nearby restaurants that we enjoyed. The room was clean and had a nice patio.  It was suitable for our one night requirement which we appreciated. 
47196,18998225,2014-09-04,11031320,Sander,"Accurate description, friendly host, nice bed, local guides in room and bottle of water on arrival. Would stay again for sure!"
47196,19891656,2014-09-20,20676480,Nick,"Shalini was really helpful with any question I had, and she made me feel at home. Neighborhood was eclectic—I liked the bars. "
47196,20193385,2014-09-25,13526152,Drew,"Host was very nice, we met her briefly and she helped us with places to eat, things to do etc.  Room was very clean. The bed is small unless you are by yourself. Don't think my wife and I would stay here again based on that. Location was great for walking and Queen bee cafe (block away) was delicious for breakfast. Must try!

Room is advertised with cable tv but there is no tv at all. Be careful parking  as we got a ticket for blocking an""unmarked crosswalk"" whatever that is!"
47196,21091266,2014-10-11,21447227,Lena,"In a phrase, the room was exactly what it says on the tin: clean, quiet, and, best of all, soothingly private. I arrived well into the evening, hours past the check-in, and there was no problem. Shalini also made checking completely hassle free.

Sadly, I didn't get a chance to see much of the neighborhood (arrived jetlagged and left early due to wedding plans), but what I did see was pretty and pleasant."
47196,21338329,2014-10-15,19987598,Christine,"The room was very nice and I really liked the furnishing! The room is located on the first floor, while the rest of the apartment is located on the floors above, which made it convenient for the luggage. The shower had great water pressure, so it was nice to back to after a long day.
The apartment is at a nice neighborhood at a convenient location 1/2 mile from great bakeries, restaurants, and bars. There's a Safeway nearby too! 
We took the Buses #8 (Seattle Center) and #43 (Downtown/Pike Place) 2 blocks away from the apartment, which was very convenient and came every 10-15 minutes. The short 10 minute ride saved us a 2 mile walk, which is far when you're tired. :) Otherwise, it's a nice walk downhill on a good day."
47196,21662719,2014-10-21,9239410,Bob,"just perfect - lovely place.

"
47196,21767559,2014-10-23,5818793,Jo-Anna,My stay with Shalini was fantastic! We arrived a bit early and she was nice enough to let us drop off our bags and suggested places nearby to grab a bite to eat. The room was clean and comfortable and looked exactly like the pictures. We found it easy to find a parking space and there was lots of stuff within a reasonable walking distance. Shalini was friendly and quick to respond to my messages. I would definitely recommend her place to anyone! 
47196,21953267,2014-10-27,20498474,Sonja,"Everything was well prepared when we arrived. The room was nice, comfortable and clean. If you are visiting Seattle and want to see a lot of the city - this place is perfect to stay. 
We had our own privacy and when we had questions, Shalini was very friendly and helpful.
We really enjoyed our stay there and would definitely book it again.
Thanks for everything, Shalini! :) "
47196,22373241,2014-11-04,2451232,Amber,"Shalini's place was the perfect place to stay while I was in Seattle, it was easily accessible and very close to several bus stops. The room is very nice - it was spotlessly clean and I loved having the little patio even though it was too rainy most of the time to use it. Highly recommended!"
47196,22498126,2014-11-08,22683454,佐藤,"遅いチェックインにも対応してくれた。タオルを貸してくれた。とてもきれいな部屋、バスルームだった。
ドライヤーがよかった。飲用水も用意されていた。"
47196,22652495,2014-11-11,49999,Marcia,The host was very accommodating about my arrival time.
47196,22752514,2014-11-13,5976127,Nuno,Nice place to relax in Seattle. Great accommodation with nice patio included. 11 bus for downtown 1 min away.  
47196,22854024,2014-11-16,14065169,Joseph,"As advertised, this is a clean, quiet, private room. And, it's very close to stores on Madison St. as well as sites/stores/activities on Capitol Hill. Street parking is free, but difficult to find."
47196,22968173,2014-11-18,23575719,Ian,"Never saw my host, but everything was laid out nicely--exactly as descibed.

The one complaint I have is there was a weird noise my entire stay. Sounded like a car revving it's engine outside the room and would end in a weird clank. Easy to ignore until you try to sleep. "
47196,23068275,2014-11-22,14537074,Richard,"Accommodation perfect, location great, close to shops and easy transport to the city and airport.  Room well presented, perfect for a short stay and very private."
47196,23211719,2014-11-25,3509856,Jaklyn,"Lots of privacy;  comfortable bed and private bathroom was a real bonus.  Not much contact with host, but that was fine.  Great location and parking was a plus."
47196,23651712,2014-12-07,22529331,Mike,Great spot! Convenient location 10 min drive from downtown. The suite was very well kept. I would stay here again.
47196,23753377,2014-12-09,21999850,Tonaya,"I was delighted with my stay here. My host was gracious and there were wonderful welcoming touches in the room such as a bottle of fresh water and clean towels on the bed. 

This was an utterly peaceful environment just a short walk to Broadway shops and restaurants, in a charming neighborhood. The private bathroom and patio area made this an almost unbelievable bargain.

When it was time to go I had only steps to walk to coffee and the nearest bus stop to downtown.

I can't recommend this suite enough and will book all my future stays here if it's available!"
47196,23828022,2014-12-11,3164474,Shabnam,"I certainly recommend this place. It was nice, clean and comfortable. Shalini is a kind and generous host. Communication was very easy. I reserved this accommodation in short notice, and everything worked out very well. Also upon my arrival, something unexpected happened and Shalini helped me to resolve the issue. The location is great and safe, lots of interesting stuff nearby and  easily accessible to other nice areas in Seattle. "
47196,23875165,2014-12-13,15489866,Rebecca,This was the perfect place for me to stay during my trip to Seattle! I was in Seattle for a short trip after visiting Portland and San Francisco. The location was great and easily accessible by walking and public transportation. The room is exactly as described and pictured. I met Shalini when I arrived and she was very helpful in letting me know what amenities I had in the room. This was a great airbnb experience for me! 
47196,24063379,2014-12-18,21999850,Tonaya,Another great stay! This already feels like my Seattle home away from home. Thanks Shalini!!
47196,24463315,2014-12-29,19355447,Kathie,"Great neighborhood - quiet and conveniently located to public transportation and a nice park (Miller). The key was available upon my arrival and the room was as in the picture. This would be a great place to visit in the spring or summer when it is warm enough to enjoy the patio and backyard. In winter, it is warm and there was access to internet. "
47196,24693347,2015-01-01,9230,Andrew,Clean and comfortable room on the ground level of a townhouse in a nice part of town. We especially liked the private en suite bathroom. We didn't meet our host in person but she was quick to respond to texts. I would be happy to stay here again. 
47196,25446293,2015-01-16,25500095,Susan,"Very nice place, very nice host(ess). Easy walking distance to everything on Capitol Hill."
47196,25488441,2015-01-17,8932486,Paul,"Nice clean room, in a great neighborhood and ideal location. Shalini was kind and flexible. An experienced Airbnb host."
47196,25630732,2015-01-21,7857104,Steve And Debbie,"The perfect place--and a perfect host--for my long weekend visiting family. Very clean, very quiet, private bath and very close to grocery, restaurants and coffee on 15th. It's also perfectly situated for nice runs through Interlaaken Park!"
47196,25852604,2015-01-27,12386098,Misty,This little suite on the edge of Capitol Hill was perfect for my quick stop in (email hidden)e room was well put together and Shalini was super sweet. Will definitely stay here again the next time I'm passing through.
47196,25957504,2015-01-31,24486889,Rory,"I had no interaction with the host, except when I couldn’t find any shampoo in the bathroom and she gave me some. The description was accurate and the neighborhood was pleasant enough.

It was convenient that the room was so close to the front door, and that I was provided with a water glass, but I was annoyed that was no soap next to the sink, so I had to use the soap in the shower whenever I washed my hands."
47196,26148238,2015-02-04,16187909,Colton Bryce Hamish,"Shalini is located in the wonderful Seattle neighborhood of Capitol Hill very close to Madison. Although listed as a private room, it's like having a whole floor to yourself even with a little patio space! She was very accommodating with my last minute response (thank you) and respects your privacy. She is extremely close to coffee shops, and grocery stores, and short walks from some bars. Highly recommend this listing"
47196,26327236,2015-02-09,26786268,Josiah,"Shalini was a very friendly and welcoming host. I was a little nervous about the trip in because I had never been to Seattle but, she made sure that I had everything I needed.  

The room was clean and comfortable and 5 minutes walk from restaurants and coffee shops. I would highly recommend choosing Shalini's space for your stay in the Seattle area. Thanks Shalini for your hospitality. "
47196,26380165,2015-02-10,27294105,Bob,Host was fine. Room was secure. the  Neighborhood  towards town a bit sketchy through which I would not walk at night. Actually farther from town than I thought as the time from town is by bus and not walking. Room tiny for complete price with little space around bed. It is pretty much only for sleeping. Pillows cheap and bed tight for two folks. I got much more comfortable space in four star hotel in town for not much more money the next night using same day hotel search engines. 
47196,26450793,2015-02-13,25500095,Susan,"A great place to stay -- nice garden, good location, well equipped for our part-time student, who has stayed here two nights a week for the winter quarter. Everything she needs is close by too, and the free parking is a big help, since parking at the college is awful."
47196,26693330,2015-02-17,26278649,Amy,"Listing description accurate, very clean, cute space. Key exchange was quick and seamless, and host let us check in early, as was available, which was great. Host was flexible and very good with communication prior to our stay. 

Towels and other shower amenities were provided, and a personal note with a reiteration of the check-out instructions was left on the desk in the room along with the wifi password, which was great for reference. Neighborhood was nice, and within very close proximity to grocery stores/cafes. About a ten minute ride from the waterfront and Pike Place, which is walkable as well. Close enough to some great spots, while still having a quaint neighborhood location. "
47196,26821690,2015-02-20,25500095,Susan,"This room is a real find! It's pretty, private and well equipped, and Shalini is a kind and friendly host. The neighborhood is nice, close to everything on Capitol Hill, and parking is free, if a little hard to find sometimes. Safeway is close (good for my student daughter), as are buses (frequent). We've booked it weekly during winter quarter at Seattle Central, and will continue to do so. "
47196,26990970,2015-02-23,1498742,Logan,"We had an easy stay at Shalini's suite this weekend.  It's located in a great neighborhood, a short walk from Safeway and a slightly longer walk to all the great cafes and restaurants on 15th.  Convenient to bus lines and plenty of street parking.  

The room itself isn't huge but it's plenty of space for 2 people.  The bed is a full size and the attached bathroom is convenient. The patio is big but didn't get any use this weekend since it was too cold out.  

Shalini met us when we arrived and gave us a brief walk through and offered some neighborhood recommendations.  I would definitely recommend Shalini's suite to anyone needing a room in Cap Hill.  "
47196,27444053,2015-03-04,8480994,Jim,"Good neighborhood, and accurate listing.  Easy to get in and out.  Love the free parking.  I didn't meet the host, but that was OK with me.  I was able to walk down to Emerald City CrossFit and get in a 7am workout.  Nice!"
47196,27558444,2015-03-07,28469606,Ben,"I stayed briefly overnight and had a wonderful experience. Cute room, great neighborhood. :)"
47196,27772393,2015-03-11,20784013,Carol,"Shalini's place was in a cute, accessible, and convenient location! The listing was accurate and the room was clean and comfortable. I did not get the pleasure of meeting her but I enjoyed my stay. Shalini was very prompt when responding to my questions and accommodating when my flights got cancelled on the day I was to arrive. I highly recommend Shalini's suite!"
47196,28309995,2015-03-22,26877669,Leslie,"Pretty small place, but it worked for me and my friend since we were rarely there.  Great location, it was easy to get to various places and is even close enough to be able to walk downtown."
47196,28442406,2015-03-23,424944,Alice,Shalinis place was comfortable albeit small but location is convenient. Street parking was free. I wish we made more use of the garden!
47196,28538955,2015-03-25,12816692,Christine,"Our room was exactly as advertised, super clean, neat, and conveniently located within walking distance to a number of bars and restaurants in Capitol Hill. "
47196,28964635,2015-04-01,29821063,Andy,Shalini was a great host. Very warm and welcoming with a great space to stay. The Dr. Bronners in the shower was a nice addition. The bed was very comfortable  She gave us great neighborhood recommendations as well. Great experience all around.
47196,29080323,2015-04-03,12144716,Mette,"This was a lovely place, nice and quiet neighbourhood. I was late arriving, but this was not an issue at all, great communication and fast responses. Shalini made a point of popping down to say hi on my first day. It was quiet, comfortable, nice and clean. "
47196,29726691,2015-04-12,11559091,Jazmin,"The description to this location was very accurate, and fit perfectly for my stay in Seattle. It had exactly all I needed, a bed & bathroom. It was clean, cozy, and conveniently located near a Safeway just some feet away. It was also walking distance from Downtown, as well as areas for eating, shopping, and such within Capitol Hill. Thank you, Shalini!"
47196,30622563,2015-04-25,30061768,Alan,What a great place!  The building is a multistory town house and when you open the door it leads to your room and then upstairs to the rest of the unit so it really feels like your own flat complete with a full bathroom and patio for a very affordable price.  Shalini was also extremely welcoming and was there when I showed up and gave me recommendations on restaurants and things to do in the area.  I slept comfortably and also had no problem finding free parking for my rental car - many times right in front of the unit which was nice.  The unit is close to 15th street and everything Cap Hill.  I rarely used my car and walked everywhere.  I stayed for 5 nights because I was trying to find a new apartment.  Shalini's place really made what would have otherwise been extremely stressful week a great experience.
47196,30911791,2015-04-28,31817957,Casey,"Shalini was a great host! She offered to leave the key for me in case I got there late, but I ended up getting there at a decent time so she showed us around the room. It's small, but it has a really pretty attached patio and also a beautiful bathroom. She laid out towels for us as well as left a carafe of water for us. The bed was comfortable and we slept well. You could hear them moving around upstairs, but it wasn't anything that bothered me. I was pleased overall and the street parking is fairly easy to find. "
47196,31534259,2015-05-06,21337214,Laura,"We had such a great time in Seattle.  We didn't get a chance to actually meet Shalini in person, but everything was perfect!  This location is amazing!"
47196,32316415,2015-05-17,1758375,Jenny Lou,"Shalini was a great hostess. She greeted us upon arrival and offered tips for the neighborhood. 
The space was fantastic - we appreciated the private en suite bath and outdoor space.
The location offered many walkable options for food, entertainment, and shopping. I would definitely book this property again!"
47196,32610413,2015-05-19,32714373,Ira,My host greeted me at the door and was very friendly and welcoming. The room was as it appeared in the ad as well as being clean and comfortable. The neighborhood was ideal for my purposes and there was adequate parking- a big plus in Seattle. 
47196,32896685,2015-05-23,26623490,Bruce,"Unfortunately I did not get to meet Shalini. The picture of the room is accurate, it is clean but very basic.  The walls(ceiling) are thin and I could here every word of a conversation going on upstairs."
47196,33323052,2015-05-26,33597356,Anna,"Seattle was absolutely beautiful and an awesome town. We didn't get to meet Shalini as our schedules didn't match up. She gave straight forward instructions on what to do if we arrived / left while they were out of the house so that worked out fine. Parking was easy enough to find. The room was small but comfortable and in a great location. It was very close to a lot of restaurants, bars and coffee shops."
47196,33388860,2015-05-27,30274810,Vincci,"I didn't get to meet the host, but we stayed in communication throughout. Check in and check out was easy, and the room was clean and comfortable. Has a private bathroom and a yard, feels like your own little apartment instead of a room."
47196,33486918,2015-05-28,5093135,Grietje,My friend Liam for whom I booked this room said it was perfect! 
47196,33990334,2015-06-03,30146734,Jeffrey,"Small room in terrific location. Walkable to cafes, restaurants and bus.  Perfect for an overnight, not extended, stay. We never met our hosts, though they were just upstairs."
47196,34293639,2015-06-07,30409620,Lamar,"We had a great four day stay with Shalini.   Her space is just as she describes and was just what we needed.    It's in a good location that's convenient to public transportation or a good walk downtown.   

From the airport we took the train then the 48 bus to a couple of blocks away.  Next day rented a car downtown (they picked us up)  for half the airport price.  Parking is on-street but free and generally available near. 

Shalini met us when we arrived and helped us get oriented on our first trip to Seattle.  Overall great experience. 

"
47196,34533333,2015-06-09,30715479,Kevin,"Wow, what can I say about Shalini and her space....Awesome!  You feel like you have your own private hotel room for a fraction of the cost in Seattle (believe me I looked).  Oh wait, add to your private room and full 4 piece private bathroom... access to a back patio! I was lucky enough to meet and hang out with Shalini and her friends and I feel like I made a new friend - because she is also awesome!  thanks again Shalini:-)"
47196,34705100,2015-06-11,17521642,Stu,"Shalini's apartment is exactly as advertised. Perfect quiet location for my quick trip into Seattle, but also not far from all the attractions. It was very clean and cozy, and she was very helpful and communicative as a host. Definitely recommend to anyone traveling through Seattle. "
47196,34807942,2015-06-12,17377055,Karen,"
Shalini had everything set up for us in our bedroom.  We loved the patio and the privacy of our own bathroom.  The townhouse was convenient to many Capitol Hill coffee shops and the Safeway is close by."
47196,35275686,2015-06-16,35570108,Pajaros Y,Great. Quiet and private room
47196,35322297,2015-06-17,18249751,Jia,"Great location, close to downtown area. Safe neighborhood. Salinas is very nice and friendly. We communicated through messages and she always respond quickly. We arrived late so we didn't see her personally, but she had everything ready. The room is clean and tidy. Salinas provided several nice tourists guide books in the room. Highly recommended!"
47196,35440578,2015-06-18,24473286,Donald,"I came in on a red eye and was very tired.  Not a great guest.  Went right to bed.
Great location. This neighborhood of SEattle is beautiful. Very  convenient is you are visiting my sister!!
"
47196,35918728,2015-06-23,20561107,Marty,"We were met by Shalini when we arrived and shown to the room.  The photos don't really show how small the room is!  It is very small.  The neighborhood is fine, bus lines are nearby as well as a Safeway grocery store.  Truly walking distance to many places and there are lots of restaurants within 15 minutes.  Becuase there is no access to a kitchen one must plan on all meals being eaten out which adds to the expense of staying there.  Sheets on the bed were too big for the bed which made it hard to get them tight enough particulary on the bottom (queen-sized fitted sheet on a full-sized mattress).  "
47196,36259441,2015-06-27,14496544,Mats,"We were very happy with our stay in Shalini's place. The room is cozy and clean and is connected to a patio and a private bathroom. 

The neighborhood is very pleasant and vibrant with many interesting cafés and bars within walking distance. Free parking on the street is also convenient for those traveling by car.

We had a brief chat with our host when we arrived and she seemed very kind and helpful. Checking in and out was very smooth. 

This place is an excellent choice for anyone visiting Seattle."
47196,36942661,2015-07-03,28721175,Rachelle,"The room is exactly how it's described! It's little, with a full sized bed, but it's just perfect for a few days in town. Everything was extremely clean, and the back patio was a great bonus. The neighborhood was easy to navigate, and we often found parking right out front. I would definitely recommend Shalini and her place!"
47196,37063038,2015-07-04,34142705,Nick,"Great location & communication (Unfortunately, I didn't get to meet Shalini.)"
47196,37567112,2015-07-08,33180158,Maite,"Thanks for having us! 
Everything was fine. Close to Seattle and a safe neighborhood. "
47196,37985112,2015-07-12,33238201,Hannah,We had an awesome experience! The room was super clean and exactly what was described. Easy access to the bus to downtown/Pike Place and awesome restaurants in Capitol Hill with in walking distance! 
47196,38163333,2015-07-13,36004335,Gautam,Great location. Very pleasant and nice to deal with. Highly recommend!
47196,38259906,2015-07-14,5805720,Keith,"Nice, private room separate from the rest of the home.  "
47196,38593228,2015-07-17,11366684,Amanda,"The room was exactly as described and was clean and comfortable! It is about a 40 minute walk to the market. The area is great! I only briefly met Shalini; however, she was awesome and very personable! She offered a great breakfast suggestion and was quick to respond to any questions I had. "
47196,39604523,2015-07-25,17127302,Claire,"We loved staying in Shalini's studio, which was private, quiet and in a lovely part of Capitol Hill. It's just over the hill from the neighborhood nightlife and was a great, comfortable place to crash after a day of sightseeing and walking. Clean, safe, and well-appointed, we highly recommend it."
47196,39912375,2015-07-27,30548383,Kris,Everything was good. Key was left for us as Shalini wasn't home at the time of arrival. Met her a short time later. Very nice. Room was adequate. Bed was a double which was a little small for the two of us. Quiet neighbourhood with very easy access to the city.  Would totally recommend. 
47196,40366063,2015-07-30,22724379,Jonathan,"Shalini was a great communicator prior to my arrival and made accommodations to meet me during our designated time frame. This was a perfect location in Capitol Hill; a quick walk or Lyft trip to all the fun! This is the best Airbnb experience that I had and a big reason was the private bedroom, bathroom, and patio. This place is a steal and I would most definitely stay there again. "
47196,40967597,2015-08-03,10569329,Laurie,The host was really helpful and friendly and the space was perfect with a patio that we used every evening!
47196,41126292,2015-08-04,29864692,Samantha,"Shalini was very easy to get in touch with as I was on my way to her house. She was flexible and accommodating as a friend decided to stay with me last minute. We could tell that the house was clean, as it smelled of bleach when walking in. Very close to the action, only minutes of driving to Downtown. 

The internet worked fine and the code was easily accessible on the desk.

We had very limited interaction with Shalini as we were always on the go."
47196,41248062,2015-08-05,37790031,Jonathan,"The room was as described.  While it wasn't loaded with amenities, it was more than sufficient for us (traveling through the city and just needing a place to crash)."
47196,41498876,2015-08-07,39947159,Andrew,The description is very accurate and the host is quick to respond and help! It was a wonderful stay. Very clean! It was just enough for us traveling through Seattle. 
47196,41619686,2015-08-08,36274430,Yi Xiang,"Shalini's apartment is clean and tidy. Check in and out procedures were smooth and easy too. Though we did not meet Shalini during our stay, she ensured that everything was taken care of. Would definitely recommend her place!"
47196,41917848,2015-08-10,27608016,Frank,"This room is in the very lovely Capital Hill district of Seattle, handy to shopping and restaurants, but quiet."
47196,42668114,2015-08-15,32867872,Max,"We did not spend a lot of time in the actual unit, as we were exploring Seattle and traveling around the state. It was a small, but clean and a easy place to come back to and crash for the night (you may want to bring an extra pillow if there is more than one of you staying for several nights). The room is small with one small closet, so pack light if you can. We did not have much interaction with Shalini after she gave us the key on the first day. You would be hard pressed to find a better location more central to stay in Seattle. Capitol Hill is the place to be if you are looking for easy access to down town, an amazing food scene, but don't need more than a bed with a shower than this is the way to do it. "
47196,42877193,2015-08-16,21026391,Deedee,"Host was very relaxed about us coming in front out of town & not exactly knowing our plans, so we appreciated that!  Thanks for everything! "
47196,43216976,2015-08-18,19975241,Mark,"Really nice little room in a hip neighborhood. Super clean.  Shalini was a quiet, responsive host. Top marks!  "
47196,43489168,2015-08-20,34441589,Anne,Nice room w attached (website hidden) books on bedside table. I enjoyed the outdoor patio. There was a near by coffee shop but I would have appreciated being able to make a cup of coffee or tea in room. Everything very clean. 
47196,44286467,2015-08-25,33295706,Margaret,"Excellent accommodation as described in ad. Perfect for a single looking for quiet, privacy, cleanliness and overall good value for the money! Location is close to a grocery store, pharmacy, and the local cafe. Also very close to bus route 43 which goes downtown via Capital Hill and bus 8 which goes downtown to Seattle Center. Also close to U of W campus by the same buses. I plan to book this again! Margaret "
47196,44462884,2015-08-26,24948252,Sean,Shalini made us feel very welcomed in her home. The area was a great pit stop and provided a greater scene of Seattle's neighborhoods and residential structures. The neighborhood has amazing homes just a walk away! Shalini was right to have your camera ready on the way in!
47196,44760095,2015-08-29,9900645,Alex,"What you see is what you get, just a little less fancy. Room size is ok, bathroom ok (first bathtub clogged, later the toilet but both fast fixed). Bed is a little short and small, but it comes with terrible pillows. Outside is a small patio, ok but nothing special. A tv, coffemaker and small fridge would really upgrade the room. Downtown is a 30 min walk or 10 min with bus, but there's a Safeway with a Starbucks around the corner for daily needs. We didn't see Shalini although she lives upstairs, but that's ok. All in all, it's an ok room for that price. "
47196,45470761,2015-09-03,36560457,Adam,"This place is as advertised, fantastic! I enjoyed my time in this centrally located and clean home. I'm addition, a tall guy bonus the shower head was very high up and didn't shoot into my face like many guest ensuit showers do."
47196,46270933,2015-09-09,32232683,Amber,Shalini was very attentive as needed and provided some good food recommendations. The room was very clean and quiet. Parking was limited but we lucked out with a spot right in front and didn't have to move the car all weekend. The location was easily accessible to everything in town either by foot or public transit. We didn't get to enjoy the back patio area too much due to the unforeseen weather but having the sliding door open made the room feel bigger with some fresh air. Thanks!
47196,47601465,2015-09-20,34142709,Nehemiah,"I really enjoyed my stay and would stay again when visiting Seattle.  Communication was fantastic, and the room was nice and in a great location."
47196,47770866,2015-09-21,28139222,Olivia,"Shaking was a very warm host, easy to reach and happy to answer questions. The room was spacious and clean, with a gorgeous patio and private bathroom included. The location was optimal, a walk or quick taxi away from everywhere I wanted to go. It was a perfect stay, thanks again! "
47196,49140881,2015-10-01,24594243,Femke,"Great location of apartment
Only bed was very small for two people. "
47196,49412554,2015-10-03,18499407,David,"Shalini was a wonderful host and enjoyed my stay in her lovely guest room.  I had a last minute trip to Seattle and Shalini was extremely accomodating, she was very warm and willing to suggest a few places for me to visit for dinner. Unfortunately my schedule couldnt allow me to take her up on these recommendations, but I wish I could the restaurants nearby looked so good.
Everything is as advertised within walking distance of a fun neighborhood.
My trip to Seattle was last minute and stressful (literally had to plan it the night before), however my stay at Shalini's was great she was very prompt in responding and booking it on Airbnb was seamless.
I highly recommend booking with Shalini."
47196,49795472,2015-10-06,4668988,Xabier,"Shalini was very welcoming, she offered advice on what to see and what to do and visit. The location is perfect, restaurants and parks are within walking distance in Capitol Hill. For sure a place I would want to stay again if I am back to Seattle."
47196,49944591,2015-10-07,3629614,Martin,"Great location near restaurants and nice neighborhood. The room is almost completely self contained and feels essentially like a separate apartment on the lower floor with its own small garden.

I would love to say that I would come back because for my purposes this is quasi ideal for business trips to Seattle. However there was a noise throughout the night that sounded like an 'engine' that went on for about 3-4 seconds every minute or so (perhaps related to heating system?). It was not loud but since the neighborhood is so quiet it was noticeable and affected my sleep. I am a light sleeper so others may not be bothered by it.

I only spent one night and left early so didn't get a chance to chat with Shalini about the noise. She was a great host and excellent at communication and it was easy to find."
47196,50289886,2015-10-11,14745356,Jessica,"Great location, very clean, very private (there is a shared entrance, but the space is totally private and the little back patio is delightful). I was a little disappointed that there was no way to even store food or something to drink... even a mini fridge would have made things much more comfortable. "
47196,50711997,2015-10-13,5963586,Trish,"Shalini was very easy and efficient communicator. The accommodation is in a terrific location, walking distance to lots of Capitol Hill restaurants & Cafes & downtown. It's a green and quiet neighbourhood with friendly people. The room is small but has a good outlook onto the private courtyard garden & is clean and comfortable. We found parking on street."
47196,50998066,2015-10-16,40517852,Ben,Nice room with en suite. All as expected. Thanks Shalini :) 
47196,52900961,2015-11-02,46947465,Chris,Very accurate description in a very nice neighbourhood. I had just moved to Seattle and was looking for a permanent place while staying with Shalini. Shalini was very helpful in suggesting places to go and where to look for a permanent place. I would highly recommend staying here. 
47196,54190056,2015-11-16,1214046,Don,"Shalini's room was as described, very clean, very comfortable and close enough to Capitol Hill business and activities to walk, yet tucked into the neighborhood for peace and quiet."
47196,56013902,2015-12-07,48204490,Timothy,"Host was extremely helpful not only in helping me locate the place, but also with best places to call for an uber, locations around to visit and ect. Room was clean with it's own temperature control, towel and basic toiletries provided. I would happily stay again. "
47196,56570218,2015-12-14,50757761,Tian,"第一次使用Airbnb的服务，由于涉及审核个人资料需要12个小时，所以我们没来得及等资料审核完成就预定了其他的酒店。但是等我们到酒店后却通知我们审核已经完成，如果不去住的话，会扣掉我们预付款50%的费用，没办法，我们只能在第二天推掉酒店，然后就搬到了我们预定的这个私人住宅。
首先，该区域是一个很拥挤的地方，道路两边都停满了车，雨后路上树叶和着泥巴到处都是，泥泞的路面加上拥挤的道路，首先感觉就不太好。进入室内，房间面积很小，没有电视，没有开水喝，没有毛巾等基本的洗浴用品。从我们入住到离开，见过房东一次，中间实在想喝点开水，打房东电话，也没有人接。
车就按照指示停在他们房子旁的马路边上，当时只有一个空位，所以我们就停下了。但是不知道离消防水龙头太近，结果还吃了47美元的罚单。真实郁闷！！
终于挨过了二个晚上，一大早我们离开收拾东西离开了这个地方（居然要求我们11就check out)，酒店还允许12点呢。总之，第一次的体验真的很不好，我想以后要慎重使用airbnb的服务了。"
5759668,28853431,2015-03-30,29415768,Hanna,"What a great space for a weekend or week get together with friends and family. Plenty of privacy and space for people to converse in the living room or play games in the kitchen. We had a minor hiccup with the internet, Krystal was ready to help without too much delay. My only recommendation is that you will need a car to come and go as you please due to being in West Seattle. There are definitely buses available but you would have to plan your travel accordingly. Also, when you plug in the address to your maps, it should be noted that you should take the first right on Dawson into the alleyway to find the parking space. Thanks for a great time Krystal and we hope to come stay again. "
5759668,29472874,2015-04-07,7351824,Walter,"Communication with Krystal is pleasant.

This town house was clean, cozy, and equipped with everything needed to feel at home.  

It is quiet considering it is attached to another town house.  

I will definitely stay here again, if I am ever in the area.
"
5759668,29864414,2015-04-13,29989520,Heather,"I came to Seattle for a little get a little alone time and I got just that. This place is perfect and makes you feel so relaxed and like you are in your own home. You get your own parking spot, there is a coffee machine and coffee, and ICE MAKER (huge plus for me) you don't need to buy and bottle water cause the water straight from the tap tastes amazing. The place is designed so cute with great art and comfy sitting area. The bed is comfy and the shower is amazing. Washer and dryer too!!!! I really enjoyed myself in the place and Krystal is just amazing to work with. Oh and the place is a straight shot to the west Seattle bridge, which is a huge plus. Only takes a few minutes to go downtown. What can I say I loved every second! Thanks again!!!"
5759668,36355458,2015-06-27,18094848,Caitlin,The host canceled this reservation 40 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5759668,37347567,2015-07-06,6601685,David,The host canceled this reservation 36 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5759668,40942762,2015-08-03,36757464,Callan,Absolutely beautiful. What a great place to stay just outside of downtown. Would highly recommend and stay again!
5759668,43653902,2015-08-21,38610087,Trina,We came for our daughters wedding ..had a great time ...the place was very clean well kept.. I would recommend this to any one ...priced right .... Only thing I would suggest was to have some fans... P.S. I loved the American Flag that hung on the wall was beautiful!!!
5759668,44426448,2015-08-26,36821682,Stefanie,The townhouse was perfect for what we needed and was exactly as it was described.  The neighborhood was good and we felt completely comfortable leaving the windows open all night long without a lot of noise or feeling unsafe.  The biggest issue was the birds but it was nice to hear them (just not early in the morning).  We had a very good experience!
5759668,47370095,2015-09-18,39167741,Bonnie,"We enjoyed our week’s stay in our host’s townhouse. The two-story house was well layed out and roomy. The decor was well done, and everything was comfortable. The weather was mostly warm for our stay but we stayed cool with the cross breeze in through the windows. There were plenty of books, and maps and destination brochures were provided. We really appreciated the dining table with four chairs so that we could have our daughter and family over for meals and to play cards, etc. There were other townhouses on our block in a very nice residential area. We took a couple of long walks in the neighborhood admiring the homes and landscaping. Our street was a dead end with a park/playground/athletic field attached to the elementary school at the other end. We walked there also. We rented a car for our stay but the bus line was available on the next street. The location was very convenient to thoroughfares, grocery store, coffee shops and restaurants. A minor repair was needed and our host had it promptly taken care of. Everything was as listed in the description. We would highly recommend this as a good place to stay, and our host was most gracious."
5759668,48210622,2015-09-24,30894175,Neil,"The accomodation was very comfortable for us. As this was our first experience with air b&b it was not what we expected, there was no personal contact with Krystal other than phone. "
5759668,50138088,2015-10-09,42239239,David,Pretty good and sweet like home. House is clean and have enough room for more than four people. You can cook on your own. Unforgettable experience in Seattle.
5759668,51144965,2015-10-18,43384990,Kari,Listing was very accurate.  Everything was very easy to find.  Krystal was a great help and responded quickly to any questions.
5759668,52111376,2015-10-26,45564894,Belal,"Krystal had a good home. It was in good condition when we arrived, exactly as shown in the pictures. House is a little difficult to find as it is a Unit C, in a small ""complex"".  Good neighborhood, very quiet, family oriented. "
5759668,53463141,2015-11-09,31215356,Joshua,"Great place in a quiet neighborhood to call home while in Seattle. Close to several stores, gyms, bars, and other entertainment options, this townhouse was perfect for our family of four to stay for the weekend. My mom was leery  about using Airbnb but after being in Krystal's place for 5 mins she said ""This is great! I would recommend this to anyone!"" "
5759668,54543741,2015-11-21,48781439,Curtis,"Washington can be a cold and dark place this time of year, but Krystal's townhome was cozy and inviting.  We were there on business, but I found hanging on that cofy couch to be a great break!  Everything was clean and there were plenty of basic amenities  - stuff that makes you feel like you're home.  Minimal cleanup requirements, so we were out the door in good time for our return trip.  Thanks for a great stay!"
5759668,55357527,2015-12-01,2405939,Nevada,"We had a great experience at City Traveler's Townhome in West Seattle. The condo was just as described and toasty warm, even during a very chilly week in Seattle. We loved walking down to ""The Junction,"" where there are restaurants, two used bookstores, coffee shops, a record shop (!), and lots more. We'll definitely stay here again because we have family in West Seattle!"
5759668,56296420,2015-12-12,1664477,Ilana,"Overall we had a great stay at City Traveler's Townhome.  The location was incredibly convenient and within walking distance of the main drag in W Seattle.  The instructions, communication (both before the stay and during) and recommendations for what to do were fantastic.  The house was exactly as described in the listing, very clean and we couldn't have had a better stay!"
5463875,37357572,2015-07-06,35330100,Diego,"Jon's condo was amazing...clean, cozy, not far from downtown.  I had rented a car from the airport and visited Seattle for my girl friends birthday and we were looking for something close proximity to downtown Seattle.  She arrived early morning flight from LAX, Jon was nice enough to let her drop off luggage before our arranged check in time.  Had great stay and Jon was available via text/email during our stay.  Would def stay here again for another trip to Seattle.  "
7005538,39205067,2015-07-21,26080655,Faye,"My boys and I enjoyed our stay very much.  The cats were great hosts, very polite and affectionate.  We watched movies downstairs on the protection screen.  We made use of the professional kitchen.  We lay about on the hammocks and jumped on the trampoline.  We played with the wonderful toys and games in the house.  We played the piano.  We slept in every bed and the baby ate on the high chair.  We went rollerblading in nearby Seward Park after the annual triathlon event, Seafair, ended."
7005538,39798842,2015-07-26,213337,Erin,Bryan was a great host. The house was very clean and he was very helpful and friendly. The cats were a great bonus as the kids really loved them! We really had an excellent trip and would recommend Bryan's place to anyone travelling to Seattle :) thanks for a great stay! 
7005538,40784936,2015-08-02,5764293,Shoshana,"We had great time at Bryan's house. The house was clean and the guidlines were very clear. The kids loved especially the xbox and the trampoline and we enjoyed the lovely garden and the spacious house. Of course, the cats were stars too. Our only issue was the lack of air conditioning. The tempratures were very high, but that is probably very rare in Seattle."
7005538,41972339,2015-08-10,36706369,Joshua,"We had a great time in Seattle and at Bryan's house. We found his guide to the city, which listed local attractions and place to eat, very helpful. The two cats were adorable and quite friendly too!"
3208667,17537740,2014-08-13,19307603,Kris,"The hosts went way beyond the call of duty preparing the rental space for our visit. They had recently installed a kitchenette, stocked it with care, refreshed bananas and coffee as we used them, offered prepared coffee in the mornings, and otherwise made their space feel like a second home. They shared with us that they frequented Airbnb as guests and know full well what it's like to be on both sides of the arrangement. These are natural hosts  sensitive to privacy and enthusiastic to engage or leave alone as directed by the guest.

The room is spacious, the bed comfortable, the private entrance nice for those late Seattle nights (so as not to disturb the host), and the space well managed. This experience was like staying with close family. Although the hosts have cats, they take care to minimize the dander and cat odor in the rented space. That said, my only non-glowing comment is that this space, like any home with cats, was not free of cat dander - my guest and I are both allergic to cats, but we were still able to sleep ok.

They have a peaceful backyard area with that Seattle array of greenery and life, private and shaded.

Although this is my first Airbnb, this host inspired to use Airbnb more frequently. I hope that my future experiences are even a shadow of how pleasant Joe made this stay. A note on the hosts themselves: wonderful people - if you can, plan an extra day to spend with them."
3208667,17663153,2014-08-15,17442336,Emmanuelle,"I would definitely recommend this flat. It's the best airbnb I've been to so far. 
The room is so cosy and quiet and there is everything you need. You immediately feel comfortable. Heather and Joe even provided some really good food for breakfast and few nice local beers. 
And above all, the hosts were really nice. Really welcoming (even if we arrived few hours later than the planned hour) and helpful without being intrusive. They gave us lot of informations to go around and recommended good places to eat. They really want you to feel at home! 
Thank you Heather and Joe. 
"
3208667,18045908,2014-08-20,3834093,Robbin,"We had a wonderful stay at this comfortable and sweet B&B. The hosts were very warm and gracious, and the space is better than it looks in pictures. We enjoyed staying, and would go out of our way to stay again in the future. Lots of little details make this such a cozy and memorable place to stay!"
3208667,18370376,2014-08-25,20162436,Jeff,"Had a great stay here. Joe and Heather are wonderful hosts. The room is spacious, private and the daily replenishment of snacks and drinks was a nice touch. I'd definitely stay here again. Thanks!"
3208667,18824933,2014-09-01,15445085,Sara Alyse,"Heather and Joe were amazing hosts who made our Seattle experience a memorable one. Their guest space was peaceful and quiet and had everything we needed (minus the shower, but that was expected). I would definitely recommend staying with them to anyone looking for a convenient location, but who would rather not be in the heart of the city."
3208667,19229991,2014-09-08,3742429,Michael,"Joe and Heather are a lovely young couple and charming hosts. As we drove to Seattle, they called us by cell phone to warn of traffic problems and suggest an alternate route, and later to check to be sure everything was okay. We stayed at their home for three nights and had a large, lower-level living room/bedroom (with a very comfy bed!) and half bath to ourselves, as well as a full guest bathroom upstairs and use of the kitchen and living room. We really didn’t need the kitchen, as our room had its own microwave, toaster, dishes, and refrigerator—stocked with good things for breakfast, and even a couple of local micro-brewery beers. Their house is just a few blocks from I-5, making it easy to get around the Seattle area. It is quiet and peaceful, and our room had a sliding door opening onto a small wooded backyard area. Then there is Little Dude, their friendly 19-pound mostly outdoor cat (who is banned from the guest room for the sake of anyone who may have allergies). Ours was a most enjoyable mini-vacation and an excellent Airbnb experience."
3208667,20172924,2014-09-24,215230,Carol,"A had a pleasant stay in Joe and Heather's sweet little mini apartment with a nice view and patio door to the garden. I enjoyed watching the birds and squirrels feeding outside in the morning. The snack area was thoughtfully arranged with mini fridge and toaster and hot water kettle. Very artistic
touches, the upstairs with guest bath is lovely modern home which they kindly share is you wish."
3208667,21248384,2014-10-13,22030215,Ted,"Nice, quiet place. My hosts were very friendly. Clean and comfy and quite roomy."
3208667,21669465,2014-10-21,21558369,Christina,"Not an experience we would choose to repeat.  The listing was not accurate and it was not a bed and breakfast, as breakfast was not provided for three of the five days.  Technically, there is a fireplace in the room, but it is covered by a set of bookcases.  ""Clean dishes, fresh towels, and food refills"" did not occur.  There was a critter of some sort (likely a rodent) in the room that we heard on two different nights.  The basement was damp and had an unpleasant odor.  Dishes were not removed from our room the last two nights.  The people were pleasant enough, just not the accomodations.  On a positive note, it was very quiet there and the bed was comfortable."
3208667,22122173,2014-10-30,22776576,Wes,"Joe and Heather were on top of things from before my arrival and did everything I could have asked to make the stay comfortable. 

They are in a pleasant northeast Seattle neighborhood of private homes on a quiet street.

The listing description was impeccably accurate. It is hard to realize from the pictures but the room is very large, much bigger than a typical guest bedroom in a home."
3208667,22710541,2014-11-12,16033504,Sterling,"5 stars across the board! I had a great time, the place was clean, quiet, and very friendly I am definitely staying here again"
3208667,24799270,2015-01-02,24376937,Zhiwen,"It is a wonderful experience living there in this house with the owner, we are appreciate the owner's warm welcome. Definitely will introduce it to other Airbnb friends."
3208667,25326497,2015-01-12,22776576,Wes,"As when I stayed here before, they are exceptionally gracious hosts. When my Saturday plans fell through they invited me for brunch and we had a lovely hour of omelets and chat."
3208667,27746346,2015-03-10,28714608,Jonathan,"Joe and Heather were great hosts. Joe was out of town while we stayed with them, but he was very helpful as this was our first airbnb experience. Heather was very interactive and engaged with our experience. She provided a ton of suggestions of what to see and do in both Seattle and Portland while also respecting our personal boundaries. Would definitely stay with Joe and Heather again! "
3208667,27805940,2015-03-12,20562834,Michael,"This location was really clean and organized, my host was pleasant and very helpful. Wifi worked great. Looking forward to staying there again when up in north Seattle"
3208667,28429312,2015-03-23,29072332,Jon,"This was a great place to stay at in a lovely neighborhood.  The host Joe & Heather were amazing, they had great pointers of where to go and best breweries to visit.  The room is downstairs where my two friends and I slept for two nights.  It is a nice cozy room with plenty of space for the three of us.  The sliding door to the back yard is also a bonus.  I would stay here again for sure and recommend people to stay here.  Also they do have cats but I have mild allergies and had no problems staying there for two nights.  "
3208667,28841955,2015-03-30,8523368,Douglas,"Joe and Heather are bright, welcoming people with wonderful accommodations. Their hospitality went above and beyond. "
3208667,30562551,2015-04-24,6054250,Jean-Pascal,The house is very well situated in Seattle. It is also set back from the street. The neighborhood is peaceful. The room is very comfortable and spacious. A glass door looks onto the yard and its trees and birds. I really enjoyed my stay. Moreover hosts are very warm welcome. They always insure you need anything. We had good discussions around a beer or a brunch. I highly recommend this place.
3208667,31117409,2015-05-02,20562834,Michael,Had a nice stay once again thank you! It was nice meeting you Joe and talking football. 
3208667,33825005,2015-06-01,31939049,Roy,"Joe and Heather were great hosts for my son and I.  They provided us great information about local tourist locations that allowed us to have a great day being tourist in the Seattle area.  The room was exactly what we were looking for, and there home was very comfortable."
3208667,34583314,2015-06-09,14481081,Sam,"My girlfriend and I stayed 6 nights at Joe & Heather's place and never once felt cramped or short of any accommodations. The room is very comfortable, spacious, and private. Despite being a basement, there are plenty of windows. All the advertised applicances were fully functional and Joe & Heather were very available and responsive. There are good restaurants, supermarkets, and transit options closeby too. This is a great place for both short or extended stays."
3208667,34989182,2015-06-14,18846778,David,"Me and my friends stayed 2nights at Joe & Heather's place, the room was very comfortable for all of us. They have personally gave us their airbed for our extra person.  Despite being a basement, the room was very big and Joe & Heather were really responsible and easy to reach. We brought our own car and the parking space was very big. Would go to their place again! thanks again for the great stay!"
3208667,35316286,2015-06-17,33322726,Ann,"Joe and Heather were fantastic! They provides a clean and inviting place and continental breakfast. They knew the town and gave us great places to eat, told us how to get to the farmer's market in town and Pike Place Market among other things. Would go to their place again! Thanks again!"
3208667,35603945,2015-06-20,22824403,Ky,"As soon as we arrived, Joe was outside waiting for us. He introduced himself and offered to carry some stuff in, and gave us a tour of our room. The room itself was decorated adorably and the beds were super comfy. In the mini-fridge and on the mini-counter there was plenty of food already there for us and plenty of space to out our own as well. Before we even went to bed that night we were informed of the bus routes that would be best to take us downtown and around the other areas we wanted to check out. (Some of which sounded interesting based on Joe & Heather's recommendations alone!!) We were also introduced to their adorable kitten (and her pipe cleaner toys) and invited to coffee in the morning, as Joe makes it fresh every day. We did get to sit down and chat with Heather one morning and talk, so I feel that we really got to connect with her and that made me feel ultimately more comfortable invading their home for a few days. As per Heather's recommendation, we stopped in Portland on the drive back to SLC and got ice cream...and she didn't lie about the greatness of it! Super-awesome hosts made for a super-awesome visit to Seattle. I would most definitely like to come back and see/stay with them again :)"
3208667,35826181,2015-06-22,5898760,Maital,"The home was a great location- quiet and yet a short car ride to the center -

The room was clean and spacious -

joe was great about communicating with us and he makes fabulous coffee
 A positive stay -
"
3208667,36126360,2015-06-25,2039570,Stuart,"Joe and Heather were warm, welcoming and made every effort to assure all my needs were met during my stay.  They have done an exceptional job to make this space available for guests and I would gladly stay with them again."
3208667,36666698,2015-06-30,7264472,Bernhard Mit Ehefrau Dagmar,"Heather und Joe sind vorzügliche Gastgeber, die einem jeden Wunsch von den Augen ablesen! Wir waren zusammen mit meinem Cousin für 2 Nächte bei Ihnen und haben uns außerordentlich wohl gefühlt. Die Lage in einem ruhigen grünen Stadtteil mit zu Fuss erreichbaren Einkaufs- und Ausgehmöglichkeiten ist optimal. Joe ist Deutschland- und BMW-Liebhaber und Heather hat deutsche Philosophie studiert. Wir hatten das Glück, zu einer privaten Feier eingeladen zu werden und sowohl mit Heather und Joe als auch Ihren Freunden die Geschichte unserer Länder und die aktuelle politische Lage zu diskutieren. Dabei kam auch das leckere Bier der ""Cascadians"" nicht zu kurz ;-)). 
Wir können jedem nur empfehlen Heather und Joes AirBnB als Standort für Seattle zu nutzen. Wir würden es jederzeit wieder tun."
3208667,37204551,2015-07-05,14274661,Rachael,"The space is really nice, clean, and airy. There were breakfast snacks, coffee, and a beer waiting for us when we arrived. Beds are pretty comfy, sofa is big enough to sleep on. Plenty of privacy. Wooded back yard was a nice place to relax. Heather and Joe were helpful and down to earth. They were easy to reach when needed, made coffee for us on most mornings, and even left fresh flowers for us one day. The area is quiet but close enough to highways, and express lanes helped us bypass downtown traffic when we traveled south. There are restaurants, breweries, and dispensaries in the neighborhood as well. I highly recommend Cabin Meets Urban to anyone visiting the Seattle area. "
3208667,38627188,2015-07-17,36307566,Jill,"Joe and Heather were terrific hosts. Their listing was accurate and it was even better in person. We loved how quiet and secluded the neighborhood is and the local establishments were enjoyable to attend. 

They gave us some ideas of how to get to where we wanted to go so that we did not have to worry about travel and parking. That really made our vacation much more enjoyable, especially concerning the difficulties of parking in the downtown area.  They also gave us some suggestions of where to go.  

We want to spend more time in this area in the future and would very happily stay with this host, again."
3208667,39319704,2015-07-22,37502866,Gerald,Everything worked perfect we felt like home. It seemed that we know each other for a long time. Thanks.
3208667,39706883,2015-07-25,34948096,Amy,Joe and his wife were wonderful hosts who were nothing but warm and friendly.  Their space was very relaxing and roomy with a nice little outdoor space to enjoy a bit of nature.  We would definitely stay with them again!
3208667,40128266,2015-07-28,2971945,Spencer,Joe and Heather are the absolute greatest and most generous hosts. From the moment we arrived they made it feel like home. The place was spotless and exactly what we expected. Thanks to both of you for a fantastic stay!

3208667,43100902,2015-08-17,38979162,Nick,This was our first time trying airb&b and it was a good first experience! Joe and Heather made us feel at home and showed us some of the places to go around Lake City. We are big craft beer fans and we were not disappointed.  I would definitely recommend and we will be using airb&b again. Thanks Joe and Heather for an awesome time!
3208667,44016577,2015-08-23,13324317,Jamie,"We enjoyed our stay with Joe and Heather. The room was spacious, and Joe and Heather were so kind to make us coffee every morning! We also got tips on how to get around and attractions. I will definitely choose to stay with them if I visit Seattle again! "

The bed was very comfortable, amenities were provided, it is indeed cabin-y with a great location which is close to I-5 yet very quiet.  Joe and Heather were great hosts and I enjoyed meeting them.  I hope to stay here again next time I'm in town!"
3208667,46398832,2015-09-10,39549074,Robin,We loved our stay. We had everything we needed.  Joe and Heather checked multiple times to see if we needed anything.  The beds were very comfortable.  The room was spacious for the 3 of us. Very quiet and peaceful.  We would definitely stay again
3208667,47168514,2015-09-16,9966035,Julieta,"The listing did not make this space its justice. The room was so spacious and comfortable. The whole set up makes you almost not want to go out to explore because it's so nice to stay in. Heather and Joe were very helpful in giving us suggestions and their feedback about things to do around Seattle. They provided us with fresh coffee every morning, goodies and wine to have in our room and all the ammenties you would get at any five start hotel. I would really recommend staying in this space not just because it's great, but because Joe and Heather really make you feel like part of their family. "
3208667,48829173,2015-09-28,13136838,Sarahjoy,"the listing was accurate and we were warmly welcomed. thank you for the thoughtful chocolate treat and the morning coffee! we also enjoyed easily walking to the yoga studio nearby.  Joe and Heather are easy-going, warm, supportive, and engaging.
"
5648564,41929457,2015-08-10,12540008,Wendy,"Our family stayed in Greg’s Queen Anne Condo for 5 weeks, after driving across country.  It is absolutely lovely inside – simple and comfortable; a home away from home. It felt a lot like a ski lodge. This home is filled with light and very airy and clean. The living room has a huge TV and a very comfortable sectional couch, which was great for weekend mornings and late nights.  It also had beautiful sunsets off the adjoining balcony. There is carport parking and the location is minutes from Seattle Center. The immediate neighbor is very friendly and Greg is very accommodating and responded to our requests quickly.  We would definitely stay here again."
5648564,45502719,2015-09-03,41421516,Nayan,"Greg and his wife left plenty of helpful instructions, were incredibly organized, and the home itself was spacious, clean, beautifully decorated, and perfect for our needs.

Greg was also incredibly kind to our specific needs being overseas guests, and even recommended great places for ordering great food that Seattle is known for!

Highly recommended!"
936378,7172677,2013-09-09,3995802,Marty,We lived at this address for a couple of years so this was a lot like coming home. The unit was sparkling clean and the check-in was painless. We had a fabulous time.
936378,8267020,2013-10-22,9358253,Joan,This is a great place and Jordan is very nice. It looks like the pictures and has an amazing location!
936378,36389797,2015-06-28,32237014,Btrfly,"We just got back from our stay in Seattle and it was awesome! Place was great, clean, excellent location! It was a perfect spot and loved that it had a balcony to relax and people watch.  Walking distance to pikes place and other amazing spots. I also liked how they had a folder w/clear checkout instructions and insider tips. We had an amazing time and will definitely use airbnb again. "
9011350,54207850,2015-11-16,48736088,Subhan,"This is a great neighborhood.  The place is great and convenient.  However, it is more of a room than it is a full on studio in terms of size.  You'll definitely have your privacy, but the space is a bit tight.  That said -- everything was great. "
9011350,54303738,2015-11-17,48806727,Ariv,"Great experience overall. The room was very clean, and the location was great!"
8754180,57304435,2015-12-24,5266187,Carlos,"The hosts were easy to contact and were able to resolve issues quickly. The home was ok. It had a nice modern look to it.  The heater seemed to get way too hot upstairs. The downstairs was not insulated too well. The towels seemed dirty and had a bad smell. Besides this, everything was ok. The owners have a nice handbook with things to do in the area. "
8754180,57776158,2015-12-29,15065290,Mary Ann,"We loved this Viewridge house.  It was spacious and open, giving us and grandkids plenty of room.  That was crucial.  As a family unit, it was great to have the playroom with toys and books.  We especially liked the master bedroom and the main bathroom.  The extra touches of fresh coffee beans and Pike Street Market tea, the organic scented hand soap and body lotion were very nice.  We used the kitchen so the plentiful cooking/eating dishes really helped.  Weather didn't permit us to enjoy the garden, but loved seeing the carrots still growing!

Both the owners and the house manager were super attentive.  They checked in with us and responded to a phone call question within minutes.  Thanks for all of that.  It was a great place to stay."
8089781,45453952,2015-09-02,36497638,Mike,"Very friendly and welcoming. A very nice futon to sleep on for the night, and a fantastic price to go with it."

8089781,46840489,2015-09-13,39454976,Ian,Bjarni was very polite and respectful and a great host. Told us the local info and the house was lovely!
8089781,47013250,2015-09-14,18697460,Shona,"Super cute spot on the water, Bjarni was a very gracious host. Fantastic location, comfy and homey.would gladly stay there again! "
8089781,47938176,2015-09-21,43853265,Giles,"I left it a bit late when booking my Airbnb but it was possible!  Within minutes I was in communication with Julia and we aranged a time that I could check in.  Julia was very welcoming, we had a good chat about music and traveling.  I was very tired after a having just finished a week long conference but was able to have a good rest before going out.

I met Bjarni the next day, he was very friendly.

Their apartment was very clean and the bed was cumfortable.  I would not hesitate to recommend their place for future guests.

Thank you! :-)"
8089781,48451006,2015-09-26,19844819,David,Madison Park is a lovely neighborhood with shops and restaurants close by. And parking was easy. My hosts were very friendly and welcoming and made us comfortable after a long trip.
8089781,48810140,2015-09-28,40973754,LeeAnn,"A nice and quiet neighborhood that's super convenient to get places with the bus line only a 5 minute walk to get to. Julia responded very quickly after we requested the stay, and Bjarni was a gracious host. It was clean and comfortable, and I would recommend it to others for the good price and location if they don't mind staying in someone's living room. "
8089781,49747196,2015-10-05,5822486,Joel,"Bjarni & Julia were great :D  They were friendly and accommodating for my schedule, even though it was unusual and unplanned.  They greeted me warmly, chatted with me, and ensured that I had what I needed each night.

The description was accurate:  it's a futon in their living room in a condo 30 meters from the water.  There's a small park right at the edge of the water.  I had to park several doors down, but otherwise the neighborhood was lovely."
8089781,50217049,2015-10-10,34351127,Liz,"I had a nice night staying at Julia & Bjarni's, very comfortable bed and they were accommodating and kind hosts."
8089781,51944519,2015-10-25,18061364,Dario,They have a beautiful apartment and are situated in a great neighborhood. The convenience of catching the 11 bus downtown is also awesome. 
8089781,52298554,2015-10-27,10920035,Sean,"I felt at home in Julia & Bjarni's home. They were very friendly and accommodating. They had a very comfortable fold out sofa. The shower pressure was amazing. 
We didn't get a lot of time to visit as I was on the go the whole time I was there. I would recommend this place. "

Julia met me and gave me recommendations for vegetarian restaurants in the neighbourhood and Bjarni got me all set up, with sheets and blankets. We did our own thing most of the time, but they were always polite and quiet when leaving early in the morning (so important in a shared room!). Recommended!"
8089781,54817265,2015-11-23,49385761,Robyn,"Julia and Bjarni were great hosts for our Seattle weekend. They were able to accommodate us on short notice even though they had a busy weekend. The accommodation was simple as listed in the description but they made sure we had everything we needed to be comfortable. Location was a great surprise as well, a cute neighborhood right on the water that had a few cafes and restaurants my friend and I enjoyed. The 11 bus was also a plus connecting us to all burrows of (email hidden)ank you! "
8089781,56266403,2015-12-11,8033187,Cristián,"Their disposition was very good, coordinating so that I could arrive fine even when they weren't home.
"
8089781,56495106,2015-12-14,46227963,Alexandra,"Listing was accurate. Very cute place, right by the water, convenient and close to everything. We weren't here very much except to sleep. Julia & Bjarni both seemed polite, but weren't around much. (We left early in the morning and came home after dinner.) We were out looking for apartments in the area, only slept here 2 of the 3 night stay, and only for a couple of hours each night as we were on more of a itinerary and not a vacation. We did feel a little out of place, but, they were nice enough. Very nice home & the location is perfect if you're doing anything in the Seattle area."
6592421,35406679,2015-06-18,14350720,Annabelle,"Such a beautiful apartment. Our family of 6 really enjoyed our stay here! Stunning view, very clean, new, and modern. Would recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle! Very close to downtown Seattle. We rate this place 5 stars!"
6592421,36224071,2015-06-26,35672469,Peter,"Great location and a very nice property. Layout was comfortable, modern, clean and easily accommodated our family of 4.  Convenient to Seattle attractions, grocery, restaurants and beautiful Green lake area. Had a car so don't know if public transport was as accessible.  Thanks to Autumn (property manager) for making our check-in easy."
6592421,37995532,2015-07-12,10123852,Mariann,"Our host was wonderful, and very welcoming. He was very responsive to our texts and arrived promptly to the property to let us in and explain everything about the apartment. We also received as bottle of wine as a welcome gift.

The apartment was very nice and clean, in a great neighborhood, perfect for our trip. I recommend staying here!"
6592421,39064998,2015-07-20,6723225,Raf,This place is amazing!
6592421,41182394,2015-08-04,3904755,"Heather, Mike & Eleni","We live in the area and stayed here as our place was listed on AirBnB so we were homeless for a night.  The location is very convenient and the unit is in great condition.  It was very clean and modern, with very comfortable beds.  It was nice to have Air-Con during the hot days, which made the stay very comfortable.  Having a toddler was pretty easy as the place was not cluttered and she could have her own bedroom.  The only drawback is that the balcony had very wide gaps, so she couldn't go out there, and it was a little scary as she could easily open the door on her own. If the balcony isn't brought to code, it would be nice to have a better locking mechanism for little people. "
6592421,48697067,2015-09-28,10953234,Nancy,"Although there was a small delay in checking in, due to a bad accident that held up lots of people, the manager was in frequent contact, keeping us posted as needed.  She met us to check in and show us around.  This apartment was perfect for our needs - comfortable space and well located for our visit with our son who lived a few blocks away, accessible to public transportation.   It would work well for anyone who wants to be in the Fremont/Ballard area or even near the University of Washington.  "
6592421,52279611,2015-10-27,14745952,Severine,"Très bel appartement, très bien équipé et très confortable. Bien situé dans le quartier de Freemont.
Très bon accueil.
Très belle vue sur Downton et le Mont Rainier."
6592421,56604256,2015-12-15,578490,Jake,"This was my first bad experience renting an Airbnb after many great experiences. First the host required that I schedule a time to let me into the Airbnb even though they have an electronic door code which is an unnecessary hassle. This was because they wanted to me to sign a separate contract and take my credit card info. This is not allowed by the Airbnb TOS, hosts can require a separate contract *only if* they publish it on their listing so guests can review it before paying. This host had not published the contract and threatened to not let me stay until I signed (which I did not want to do). It was a very frustrating and stressful way to start a long (10 day) stay.

The apartment was nice enough otherwise, it would have been a good stay if it hadn't started out in such a bad way."
5580457,28739420,2015-03-29,3942187,John,Thank you for a great stay and for being a responsive and thoughtful host!
5580457,29640621,2015-04-10,28802199,Bailey,"What a gorgeous location! Rachel's apartment in Lake Union is the perfect base camp for exploring Seattle. It's in a leafy, hip neighborhood just a short walk across the bridge from the super cool Fremont & Ballard neighborhoods. Best of all, my husband & I could bring our Bernese Mountain Dog with us! Rachel was a great communicator and provided tons of info for our stay, including a book on dog-friendly places in Seattle, of which there are plenty. Thoughtful touches included a foldable dolly for hauling luggage from the parking garage to the apartment unit. Cheers to an amazing stay in our new favorite city!"
5580457,33184195,2015-05-25,135759,Miles,Rachel was an exceptional host. My friend and I appreciated the comfort of her home while we visited Seattle. We didn't need much more than a nice place to crash and Rachel's place fit the bill. No complaints at all!
5580457,33379766,2015-05-27,5548473,Anna,"Rachel's place was great for our quick stay in Seattle. The location was a good jumping-off point for Fremont and Ballard, and was also just a quick ride downtown. The complex was very quiet and felt really safe. Though our paths didn't cross, Rachel was very welcoming, and we appreciated the book of dog-friendly spots she left behind for us. Would definitely recommend."
5580457,34076019,2015-06-04,16762688,Janet,"I felt very welcomed by Rachel, even though we didn't meet. She left a nice note as well as instructions. Overall I was very pleased with her condo!
There were a few disappointing features for me, that I believe was my oversight in not fulling reading the description of her unit. 
I didn't realize there was No internet, only about 4 TV channels and no view of lake union from the condo or her patio. 
I liked Rachel and her condo very much and was hoping to make her unit a recurring rental for my future visits to Seattle, but probably won't, especially with the lack of Internet. 
I feel Rachel's rates are fair. I appreciated the parking, elevator and handy cart to bring packed items up yo the condo.
I would definitely recommend this rental to others, as long as they don't care about TV or Internet. Thanks Rachel!"
5580457,36890751,2015-07-02,35083667,Kimberly,"This was my first trip using airbnb and I thought I'd give it a shot since I was traveling with my dogs. Rachel was a great host, she left us with great dog friendly recommendations for places to check out around the neighborhood. We found a bunch of great places within a mile and walking was a great way to check out the city. The apartment was perfect for our trip!"
5580457,37373629,2015-07-06,545048,Kyle,"Rachel's place was so excellent! We never got a chance to meet in person but her correspondence was always super timely, and we got in and out really easy. I'd absolutely stay here again. "
5580457,37753289,2015-07-10,206203,Amanda,Rachel's place was very comfortable and clean. Lots of uplifting quotes about and she shares her food in a friendly way. Minutes from downtown and the Seattle Center it is very centrally located. I was there during a very hot time in Seattle and her place stayed reasonably cool with just a fan.  Nice kitchen to cook in. Pleasant surroundings.
5580457,40598513,2015-08-01,35107581,Maria Victoria,El departamento muy cómodo y todo muy limpio. El vecindario muy seguro y tranquilo para salir caminando a cualquier hora.
5580457,44113870,2015-08-24,5355893,Jarret,"We had a great stay in Lake Union. It was really easy to check in and check out. Rachel provided good notes on the accommodations. The neighborhood was perfect, a short walk to the great restaurants and bars in Fremont & Queen Anne. We ate at Canlis right next door and it was really a great experience. The parking lot below the apt is super convenient and there was even a dolly making it easy to lug our furniture in. The apt itself was really comfortable. Nice kitchen, cozy couch and quiet bedroom in the back. The private porch in the back and the front porch were great for drinking coffee or eating dinner. There were clean sheets and towels. Washer and dryer in unit was great too. There were multiple bus routes to get downtown which made it easy. It only took about 12 minutes on the bus. Super quick and convenient. Easy bike ride downtown. Also a great trail on the water only a few blocks away. Neighbors were all really nice and theres a little spot for your dog to go a few steps from the front door. Maintenance guy was really nice. Enough space for 2 people and a dog to live comfortably. Safe at night. "
5580457,45074723,2015-08-31,31927222,Thomas,"We enjoyed staying at Rachel's apartment during our trip to Seattle. The place was in a great location close to a lot of attractions and in a good and safe neighborhood. The apartment was clean and comfortable. The parking was nice to have as well. The only downside was there being no wifi. Overall, we had a great experience and we appreciated all of Rachel's instructions, suggestions, and quick responses to any questions we had. "
5580457,49733910,2015-10-05,31629771,John,"We really enjoyed our stay at Rachel's place! It was very clean, is located in a great area and includes everything you could want in a place. Next time we visit Seattle we will hope to stay in Rachel's place.

Check-in instructions were super clear, the place was as described and A+ experience overall."
5580457,50696540,2015-10-13,45486337,Leigha,Rachel was very accommodating and extremely responsive. We had a great experience!
5580457,51398807,2015-10-19,20238471,Justin,Host was great.  She was very accommodating and extremely helpful.  Clean place.  Great location.  Just perfect 
5580457,51587324,2015-10-21,7115568,Ninis,"Rachel's place was great. More and more airbnb listings are not actual apartments and are ""Staged"" places people are renting out.  Rachel's apartment is a good example of how airbnb is supposed to be. A place someone actually lives in with all the amenities of home.
Clean, modern, and she left great instruction and tips and candy for me.  Very responsive to texts etc. Location is great for easy access to Fremont, Seattle, and ballard. Parking garage was easy and covered.

My only real issue was the water pressure was so low for the shower.  Cell signal isnt great in the apartment (at least for Tmobile which is already bad in general) because its a solid stone building i think.

I would recommend this place and her as a host.
"
5580457,58631676,2016-01-03,374315,Andrew,"Fantastic location, cozy place, easy walking to Queen Anne and west lake Union. Easy bus or drive to down town. Highly recommend!"
2628010,13433039,2014-05-27,1172857,Wayne,"I had a great experience at Zvi's apartment in Seattle. It's in a great location in Capitol Hill, just steps from a bunch of great places. I didn't have a chance to use too many of the amenities of the apartment complex, but everything looked clean & available for guests to use.

The apartment is exactly what you see pictured, very clean, with lots of room. Great crossbreeze with open windows as the apartment's on the top floor.

Zvi was a great host, making sure to show us how everything worked, the apartment amenities, and even offered some suggestions for areas nearby. Also made sure clean sheets and towels were provided for each of the guests.

Highly Recommended!"

2628010,14354584,2014-06-17,15204074,Barbara,"This lovely apartment was just as it appears, and it met all our needs.  Clean and modern, in a well-managed building, in a central location.  Lots of light, with privacy blinds, and nice air flow.  Amazing city-wide roof-top view, and a great common room that accomodated a small family graduation celebration dinner.  Secure parking is available on ground level for reasonable rate.  
Host was most accomodating, answering all questions very promptly and doing his utmost to make our stay trouble free.  "
2628010,15823457,2014-07-16,812139,Stefan,"Zvi is a good, welcoming host and his apt is nicely decorated, clean, and everything we expected. The building is new with a variety of amenities and we particularly enjoyed the outdoor terraces (hard to beat Summer in Seattle :) )."
2628010,16460579,2014-07-28,5027993,Shane,"Zvi was a great host and very accommodating with early and late checkout for us. He took the time to walk me through his place and explain how everything worked. The space is great, very open and bright with a nice peek view of Mt. Rainer. The rooftop deck has panoramic views with a nice BBQ setup. Secure complex walking distance to great restaurants,bars and grocery."
2628010,16905633,2014-08-04,2343315,Josephine,"Zvi was flexible in accommodating our travel schedules.  His place is bright, well-decorated, and neat, with enough space for a group to spread out.  Although we didn't use the other amenities in the apartment complex, we enjoyed being able to walk to all of the restaurants and stores in the area.  "
2628010,17834296,2014-08-18,16891573,Martine,"We have had a great stay at Zvi's appartment. Zvi coudn't be there to meet us but the instructions on how to reach the appartment and how to get in were so detailed that we couldn't go wrong. Our questions were answered within a couple of hours.
The appartment was in a great location for us: great neighbourhood, close to the friends we came to visit and close to downtown. 
Zvi realy went the extra mile to make sure we had a good stay."
2628010,18939741,2014-09-03,3882134,Grace,We had a fantastic 3 night stay this past Labor Day weekend at Zvi's place.  Zvi was able to do a walk through with my fiance to make sure we were comfortable with all the ins and outs of the place prior to checking in.  The space looks exactly as pictured-- a very cute yet modern space.  It was our first time in Seattle and I was glad we ended up choosing this space in Capitol Hill over a space in downtown.  The neighborhood was filled with great eats and we were able to find ample street parking for the first two nights (the last night we ended up parking underground @ ~$21 for 24 hours).  There's also a local grocery store located directly across the street from the apartment so it was super convenient for us to pick up drinks and snacks.  Overall I'd highly recommend this space to anyone looking for a clean and modern space in a great location.
2628010,19215013,2014-09-08,19805660,Carrie,"We had a wonderful stay at Zvi's apartment in Capitol Hill. Zvi was a very good host and although he was not able to be there when we arrived, the instructions we were given for the apartment were perfect and we had no issues. Zvi was very responsive to any questions we had and made us feel that we could reach out to him whenever we needed anything.

The location of the apartment was fantastic and we felt we were able to truly experience Seattle more so than if we had stayed in a hotel downtown. Although a little ways from downtown, we enjoyed the long walks as it meant we got to explore more of the city. We also got to experience some of the great bars/restaurants of Capitol Hill that were just blocks away from the apartment.

We are so happy with our choice to stay at Zvi's apartment and had a wonderful time in Seattle!"
2628010,19533326,2014-09-14,19232349,Rohit,"Great Location, Great Apartment. This was our first time using Airbnb. The trip was extremely good. The apartment is big and located close to every thing."
2628010,20306775,2014-09-27,21290990,Lior,"Zvika is a wonderful host, prior to arrival he made sure that all  details concerning the apartment, the building will be clear to us.  The apartment reflects the description, for us as two people we just used the master bedroom and of course the giant living room. All appliances are new, for those who watch news the CTV is a large screen with high resolution.

We recommend the dwelling and its location  as a great get away in Capital Hill Seattle.

2628010,20440524,2014-09-29,20037388,Mitch,"great location and lively neighborhood.

would have preferred to have a bed in the 2nd bedroom and space to hang your clothes, but very nice condo."
2628010,22304082,2014-11-03,20869959,David,"This unit is in a fabulous location! Clean and spacious. Great roof deck (although we hardly saw the sun during our stay). Although Zvi was out of town during our stay, he provided a thorough detailed explanation of access/amenities and responded promptly to the few questions we had."
2628010,23365240,2014-11-30,15618275,Maria,Great location- right in the heart of Capitol Hill with Seattle beautiful views. Wifi worked great.  Zvi is a very attentive host. We did not have any problems. 
2628010,24520109,2014-12-30,8833545,Elizabeth,"Beautiful apartment in an excellent location. Walking access to anything you need and 20 minutes to downtown. The apartment is well appointed, spacious and comfortable. Zvi was extremely conscientious and more than willing to respond to any questions we had about our stay. "
2628010,25051673,2015-01-05,2191124,Lorena,"My stay in Zvi's apartment was incredible. I think I was spoiled in that it was in a neighborhood perfect for me to where I had to force myself to explore outside of it. Zvi was kind enough to check on me while I drive to Seattle from Portland and made sure I arrived and made it into the apartment without a hitch. Great host, great apartment in an amazing neighborhood. Next time I visit Seattle, I'm hittin Zvi up for his place again."
2628010,25326369,2015-01-12,25164897,Casey,"Ziv's place is in the perfect location and within walking distance of several great restaurants, coffee shops and bars.  The apartment is nice, clean and spacious and Zvi was very responsive to any questions that I had.  Photos are accurate.  I'll definitely stay there again on my next visit to Seattle."
2628010,25422530,2015-01-15,10042488,Wyatt,"Zvi was an organized, responsive host. While I didn't meet up with him, he coordinated our stay via email, text, and phone. The place was great - exactly as described. Would highly recommend Zvi's place to those looking for a comfortable place to stay in a Capitol Hill."
2628010,25554727,2015-01-19,25171105,Timothy,"The place was clean, spacious, and located in an optimal area. Zvi was a very thorough and welcoming host; making sure all bases were covered. I had a great time in Seattle at his place."
2628010,25821918,2015-01-26,26273834,Chrissy,Zvi was very organized and kept in touch constantly to make sure our stay was great. His apartment was nice and clean. The location couldn't be any better. We loved being able to walk everywhere or easily take an Uber to downtown. 
2628010,25915170,2015-01-29,25906079,Francois,"Great location, perfect apartment, clean with a  nice view. 
Also perfect synchro with the Zvy and clear instruction. Will stay again"
2628010,26318051,2015-02-09,26188775,Jeroen,"Zvi takes care of everything to make you feel comfortable and as if it's your own home! Good instructions how to get their, how to use everything and if you have questions he makes sure that you get a reaction asap. I would recommend everyone who wants to explore Seattle this apartment and location (near the bus station for easy transportation around the city) and a great view (apartment is on 6th floor)

"
2628010,26653805,2015-02-16,15099213,Brighton,"Great neighborhood, beautiful condo!  Lots of great places within walking distance - coffee shops, grocery, parks, restaurants, downtown Seattle (a bit of a long walk, but not bad if it's not raining.)

Parking was a bit tough, but we found that we could park for free east of 14th - about 5 blocks away - without needing to move our car every couple hours."
2628010,27003322,2015-02-23,24937809,Liz,"My three friends and I had a great experience staying here for a 2-night weekend getaway. The place was really spacious -  the pics don't lie! And the building was new, nice and secure. We wanted to be pretty centrally located in the city and this place was very convenient and just a quick/cheap cab or Uber ride to Pike's Place, Pioneer Square, really anywhere where we ventured. The neighborhood was welcoming and Zvi's recommendations were great. Zvi was super friendly, helpful and clear with instructions before and during our stay. The key was tricky (as we had been warned), but we got the hang of it quickly. Would definitely recommend this place."
2628010,29301525,2015-04-06,6352505,Darrin,"Zvi was a great host, constantly available to make sure we had everything we needed. The apartment is huge, light-filled, in the very center of Cap Hill, and paid parking is available under the building if you need it. It was the perfect place for us!"
2628010,29847425,2015-04-13,7872898,Thompson,"Great location and a beautiful and spacious apartment. We were in Seattle for a convention without a lot of time to truly enjoy this great place. But fully appreciated everything about it, nearby restaurants and cafes, a great place to walk and base for exploring. Host was very communicative and easy to reach. A great air bnb experience. "

2628010,30301653,2015-04-20,16749313,Annette,"Zvi was an extremely gracious host.  He went out of his way to ensure that we were welcomed and comfortable.  The apartment is huge, sunny and in a great location with a wonderful coffee shop just across the street.  It's very quiet as well, despite it's central location."
2628010,30800158,2015-04-27,27620993,Yali,"Zvi is an excellent host! It sounds funny but at first I had a difficult time trying to open the door. Zvi responded very quickly and gave me the instruction. The apt is fantastic. I slept on the couch bed and I have to say it is more comfortable than I thought, because the heater is just in front of the couch bed. Our family cooked twice in the apt and we find everything we need to cook - from cookware to seasoning. The place is in the best location to tourism places as well as to the supermarket. The only thing I think should be better is the parking place. We spend more than $50 in three days. I hope Zvi can help people to find cheaper parking space in the future. "
8342968,47875921,2015-09-21,6848291,Sebastian,"Our stay with David in Seattle has been one of our best airbnb experiences. It really felt like we were his guests, he was so friendly and helpful, suggested lots of things to do and made us feel very welcome. Also Sawyer (his dog) and Artie (his cat) are super lovely and we really enjoyed hanging out with them. They definitely added to the experience in a positive way!
The room is right next to the bathroom and toiletries were provided making us feel right at home.
We would definitely stay here if we visited Seattle again."

6629657,35436487,2015-06-18,32990039,Jason,Kirsten was a great host.  She took my request the same day.  She was very easy to communicate with.  The room was perfect an comfortable.  
6629657,36154479,2015-06-25,35333740,Manuel,The room was clean & cozy just like in the pictures. Decent size room for the price. The area also felt safe enough to go for a run. REAL friendly environment.
6629657,37253646,2015-07-05,35246915,Jaime,Kirsten was kind and easy going. She Her dog is awesome. The neighborhood was a great. 
6629657,38010023,2015-07-12,15758410,Charles,Kristen was very accommodating.  We would stay here again!  
6629657,39258104,2015-07-21,35369636,Jim,Kirsten was very (email hidden)ntaced her on very short notice and everything worked out...room was fine...would stay there again....
6629657,40461107,2015-07-31,34495395,Nikolaus,Kirsten is a wonderful host and the rooms are really nice.
6629657,42565113,2015-08-14,5417318,Stella,"The room is exactly as shown and all basics are covered. Kirsten was polite and helpful. The location is a little bit far from downtown if you don't have a car but there's a direct bus line very close by that makes it easy, just plan for more time. The area is safe and close to a park with good hiking."
6629657,42989480,2015-08-16,8584263,Xiaoke,"Kirsten's place is conveniently located, 15min by drive from downtown. The room is well sized and the bed is comfortable for 2 people. Kirsten was out of town when we got to the house but she provided all the info before hand and was quick to reply any questions. "
6629657,45029458,2015-08-30,11674786,Robert,"Nice experience.  I'd never done just a room before so wasn't sure what to expect.  (I didn't expect the dog but she was friendly.)

The location is excellent -- really convenient to Greenwood and Ballard areas, and not terribly far from I-5 and the university.

The room was exactly as described.  Nothing was lacking: there was soap, shampoo and a towel; internet was a little flaky but usable; there was parking right at the house.  I had a key so I could come and go as I pleased.

The bed was comfortable and the house was quiet.  There is a bathroom shared with other guests so you do have to factor in some possible waiting for the bathroom.  Not a surprise.

There was one mixup with the keys not being immediately available upon my arrival, but Kirsten got on it and within a few minutes had things sorted out and I was able to get in, unpack my stuff and get a key.

At the end of my stay we had a rather powerful wind storm that knocked out power.  Kirsten notified me by phone and had made arrangements for flashlights etc.  I thought that attention to detail was a nice touch.

These are not luxury accommodations, this is a single room in a modest house.  But for what it is, it's a decent value and Kirsten seems to have thought of everything a visitor might need."
6629657,45634876,2015-09-04,22429456,David,"Kirsten was a great host and the room was as described both comfortable and homey.  Location is very convenient to downtown, with lots of stores in the area and in a safe neighborhood.  Highly recommend."
6629657,45911556,2015-09-06,43314980,Kelli,Great spot! The pup was a nice touch :)
6629657,46461060,2015-09-10,25402613,Tim,I stayed with Kirsten a few nights. The house itself is very nice and the room was clean and organized when I arrived. Bathroom is right across the hall and was clean and presentable. Her dog is very friendly but will leave you alone if you want. House is in a nice neighborhood a block away from major streets. Would gladly stay again.
6629657,46658307,2015-09-12,1409323,Nikki,"Kirsten's place is cozy, the room was comfortable and her pup is really cute and friendly! I would definitely stay here again."
6629657,46831530,2015-09-13,36234554,Mike,Very easy place to stay. Simple with a comfortable bed. Kirsten communicated well with me although I did not meet her during my short stay.
6629657,47405861,2015-09-18,43296230,Nicole,"Kirsten was easy to communicate with when planing my arrival. I chose this area to get an idea of the area during a trip for a job interview. 
Overall I felt very awkward about being in a strangers house and think if I use Airbnb again it will be for a full unoccupied home.
As noted in previous reviews, her dog is friendly and adorable. The best part of the stay, really.
Things I would do differently if I choose to host would be to introduce myself to the guests, clean the bathroom/take out the bathroom trash, vacuum the bedroom floor before a guest's arrival and pull out fresh linens so guests don't have to awkwardly pilfer the ""linen closet"" for a clean towel."
6629657,48598463,2015-09-27,3924527,Bridgette,Kirsten was great at keeping in communication. I felt comfortable and at ease at her place. Fell in love with her dog Cali. Loved Carkeek park! So happy I was able to visit. 
6629657,49787353,2015-10-06,34943853,Guillermo,"Kirsten was a nice host we had some nice conversations when I spoke to her in her home. She gave me all the basic things I needed the room was clean, bathroom was across the hall, WiFi was very good, had a very playful dog named cali. From Seattle it was a 20min drive in an uber and 45min give or take by bus and hopping on the link. The neighborhood was fine I walked around at night to a local resturant just fine.

Some things for the host to improve. Maybe to be a little less shy I had to approach her to introduce myself and touch base. Had to approach her to ask for water I felt little things like that should be offered the vibe felt like it was more of a hotel then staying at someone's house."
6629657,49965720,2015-10-07,27362364,Ben,Short and sweet.  Kirsten was very accommodating to my last minute booking for just one night.  Communication was very fast and made things simple.  
231097,595649,2011-10-03,1223308,Michael,"Paul and Teresa have a beautiful home and were great hosts.  Just  genuinely nice people, very easy going and flexible.  The room is nice and is well separated from the rest of the house so there is good privacy.  Highly recommended !!!"
231097,655444,2011-10-23,7407077,Mircea,Friendly host yet respecting our privacy.  Clean accommodations suitable for our needs.  We would return for another stay and we would recommend them. 
231097,693796,2011-11-05,1265353,Seth And Lara,Paul was an amazing host!  A great place to stay.... we even told him we would move in permanently if he would let us!  He made us great coffee every morning and even gave us treats.   
231097,735882,2011-11-21,1403834,Jo,"We're so happy we found the Higuchi home through airbnb.com. We usually miss the warmth and comfort of home when traveling, but not when we stayed with the Higuchis. Their hospitality was heartfelt, and their home an oasis for weary travelers.  It isn't every day that we meet people who are willing to open their home to strangers, and make strangers feel at home. 

It was a relief to not have a TV that was on, and to experience the silence, peace, and serenity of a happy home after a busy day in Seattle. It was also a nice balance between having the privacy of their downstairs room and the option to socialize some upstairs. Their graciousness helped make our first visit in Seattle truly special. It certainly won't be the last."
231097,769798,2011-12-07,1359627,Dan,I enjoyed staying with Paul and Terry a lot.  They are friendly and helpful  hosts.  The room was comfortable and clean. I could store food in the refrigerator.  A wonderful place to stay during my trip.
231097,866271,2012-01-16,1576196,Melinda,I would definitely definitely recommend staying at Paul and Terry's.  They were so great about communicating with me regarding my stay that I felt absolutely comfortable and prepared.  The downstairs room and bathroom were perfect and the price was unbeatable.  This was my first airbnb experience and Paul and Terry were such welcoming hosts I am now encouraged to use the site as a first option whenever I am looking for a place to stay.  Thank you!
231097,960678,2012-02-29,1359627,Dan,"This is my second time staying with Paul & Teresa -- and, once again, very satisfying.  My room was very comfortable, clean and quiet.  I enjoyed their hospitality.  They are friendly, kind and helpful...wonderful hosts."
231097,1046968,2012-03-26,1196431,Mary,"Lovely home, lovely location, very gracious hosts, we would definitely stay there again."
231097,1059887,2012-03-29,1682040,Hai,"Terry and Paul were very hospitable and kind. They make our stay very comfortable. We really enjoyed it. Our son loves to play with their cats. Overall, it was a great experience. Thank you!"
231097,1084245,2012-04-04,1977995,Mel,"Paul and Terry were wonderful hosts.  They accepted my request to stay at the very last minute, as I was writing from the plane, and were kind and accommodating throughout my stay, despite my slightly early departures and late arrivals.  The room and bathroom were very comfortable and are fairly separate from the rest of the house.  I so appreciate being able to come and go and not feel compelled to be social when I was buried in work.  Their two cats are adorable and the house has its own parking and is in a lovely green hilltop location.  I would be happy to stay here again if I am in town in the future.  "
231097,1122592,2012-04-13,1910421,Georg,We had a very nice stay at Paul's house. Arriving late in Seattle and beeing lost a little bit he perfectly helped us to come to his place. The room is very nice and very quiet with an own bathroom and the location is beautiful. And the reservation was fixed within a few hours. Thanks also for nice talks and all the best from Georg & Silvie
231097,1198217,2012-04-29,2187532,Tatiana,Paul and Terry are very friendly and helpful. The neighborhood is very quiet. The room and the bathroom were very clean and private. We enjoyed our stay. 
231097,1219943,2012-05-02,2242791,Peiyun,"i loved and enjoyed the stay with Paul and Terry, it was a short stay but it really warm and homely. when you spend a full and tired day travel outside, and got back to a warm and clean room... and welcoming host.. the feeling is great :) Paul and Terry are friendly.. and their house interior just make me feel i wish to have it in my future house. Paul and Terry are helpful and friendly, even we did not have much interaction due to time constraint, i will wish to do it more when i have the next chance to visit Seattle. "
231097,1241395,2012-05-07,2028484,Sen & David,"Paul and Theresa were wonderful host. I had a lovely chat with Theresa who was very friendly and I got to meet their two adorable cats. The room was warm, quiet, cozy and comfortable. It was David and I first airbnb experience and it was awesome. Thank you."
231097,1267207,2012-05-12,2162086,Winnie,"This is my first airbnb booking and it has far exceeded my expectations! Wish there is a Terry & Paul wherever I visit! 

They are one of the most genuine couples I've met, kind and cheerful to me and my 8 month-old baby. My little one is quite sensitive to vibes in places but she totally made Terry & Paul's place home (so much that she even wanted to pull the cat's hair!) We were always greeted with warm smiles, caring small talks and the positive energy from within. 

The room itself is super nice, with a big window,  a separate bathroom just next to it and all the amenities we needed. The booking process was speedy. They are also very accommodating and even offered their own kitchen sink for baby's bath! Overall, I felt like we were staying at very easy-going friends' place. If we ever visit Seattle again I will definitely stay with them (if they will still have a room :))  

Thank you again for the great experience!"
231097,1370308,2012-05-29,1852258,Jing,"Really really nice couple! My flight arrived late at night, but i still got a warm welcome from Paul when I arrived! Welcome to Seattle! The room is very clean and cozy. I like this colorful house! Very safe and quiet neighborhood. Because of my crazy traveling schedule, i got home very lare at night, but Paul and Terry always left the lights on~ Feels like home~~ I was so lucky there to see the summit of the mt rainer during this short stay~ Thank you very much, Paul and Terry~ btw, the coffee was very good! Let me know if you come back to NYC for singing~ You had my email address!"
231097,1442153,2012-06-09,1343509,Susan,"Friendly, unobtrusive hosts; comfy, clean accommodations; quiet neighborhood. The location is a bit remote, but it's near a bus that took me everywhere I needed to go. The lower level can get a bit chilly, but there's a fine space heater in the bedroom. Overall it was a very pleasant stay; even the cats were pretty friendly."
231097,1462367,2012-06-11,2344170,Linda And Robert,"We were scrambling last minute to find a place to stay in Seattle, and we are so fortunate to have found Paul's lovely home. Our room was quiet and very comfortable.  The adjacent bathroom was lovely.  Paul was the perfect host!  The location was convenient. and we enjoyed walking to nearby coffee shops.  It is a really nice neighborhood.  I highly recommend this home!"
231097,1508790,2012-06-18,2515648,Joan,A lovely family and a lovely home!  We truly enjoyed our stay.
231097,1532137,2012-06-21,2628443,Mary,"This was a lovely experience—a beautiful house, immaculate room and bath, and extraordinary hosts. We will definitely book our next visit to Seattle with Terri, Paul and the great cats."
231097,1551132,2012-06-24,2589679,Hae-Joon,My boyfriend and I had a great stay here! The room and adjacent bathroom were comfortable and very clean. There's a key provided and the room/bathroom are downstairs so you don't feel like you're bothering anyone as you come and go. Paul and his daughter were both friendly as well :)
231097,1576977,2012-06-27,824312,Andrew,A truly lovely stay.  Paul and Terri and their daughter all made sure we were comfortable in their beautiful home.  We stayed here before we were scheduled to go back to our home state.  We made the right decision.  
231097,1709536,2012-07-15,2026861,Ron,Great stay.  I was riding in the Seattle to Portland and had to find a place close to UW where they were starting the race. The room was very cozy and comfortable.  I will be staying there again when the Ducks play the Husky's.  The house is close to a lot of good restaurants and it is easy to find.
231097,1733065,2012-07-17,900854,Yirong,"We surprised that our bathroom and bed room are very well painted and maintained--- better than my own house. Paul's daughter Reiko host us. She is very kind and warm hearted. She also shared us the best suhsi place nearby and breakfast place....... The place only local knows....we tried and it was so great. 
Their marble covered counter top and kitchen is beautiful. 
We enjoyed sit on chair on back yard and watch for sunset....."
231097,1882269,2012-08-04,2048371,J. Chris And Kim,"This is a review about the best possible place I could have stayed while I was in the Seattle area.  The warmth of this family, and the beauty of their home and neighborhood led me to feel like I'd struck the air bnb lottery.  

I was scheduled to stay in their home for about a month.  The very evening that I checked in, I had barely set my luggage down before Paul invited me to sit down for dinner with them if I would like.  I would like to stress that the Higuchi family was very personable and easy to talk to, while simultaneously being non-intrusive, and giving me all of the private, quiet studying time that I needed while in my class.  

On another note, anyone staying at the Higuchi house would miss out big time if they opted not to give some loving to the two family cats.  It is easy to be distant from the cats, so don't worry about that if you prefer to be animal-free, but the cats are so sweet...just give them a try and they will steal your hearts."
231097,1996110,2012-08-15,1392115,Robert,"Excellent accommodations, bedroom and bathroom,
accentuated by warm hospitality and friendly host and hostess.
Home is beautifully and tastefully furnished, inside and outside in the gardens, with an aesthetic touch that immediately caught our eye.  We enjoyed conversations (and morning coffee and tea) with the Higuchi family.  Highly recommended.
Room is located down a few steps from the front door (main entrance). We certainly did not feel the need for a separate entrance into our quarters."
231097,2174159,2012-09-02,3311895,Kyle,"Paul and his family were great hosts to my roommate and me while we used their house as our base camp to explore the city. The house is beautiful and we had a private bath in the downstairs portion of the house, which was great. It's really not difficult to get to and from their house utilizing Seattle's bus network. The HIguchi's were very welcoming and Seattle was great - I'm sure I'll be back!"
231097,2198334,2012-09-04,3275179,Cheryl,"The Higuchi's were very friendly and the home was very accomodating for us.  The bed was comfortable and bathroom very clean.  We were often visited by their cat who would stop in and cuddle for a few minutes and be on his way :)  The location worked out well for us, as we were able to meet up with some old friends at the University Square.  Easy drive to downtown as well :)  "
231097,2288619,2012-09-14,3378158,Cornetta,"Paul and Terry were very nice and hospitable! My mom and I rented with them for a couple of days to give me time to find my own apartment in Seattle. The house was very clean, however my mother wasn't too fond of the cats, who sometimes crept into our room. She freaked out when one of them sat on our bed and wouldn't leave for a while. I personally didn't mind them. The house is in a very nice location, near the bus line if you use public transportation and close to the UW campus. The room was small, but not too small to accommodate the two of us. I also had a TON of luggage for my move and there wasn't much closet space, so that took up a bit more room than usual. All in all, I had a good experience in the Hugichi residence. The house was nice and the Hugichi family was very friendly and helpful."
231097,2340232,2012-09-18,3306036,Sergej,"Paul and Terry are a very nice an happy couple.
The spend the time to help us find some attractions.
We felt very welcome and great time with them.
Everything was  ok! nice hosts."
231097,2376269,2012-09-22,3580151,Monique,Great hosts! Took Paul's suggestions to sight see while downtown since we had an afternoon arrival. Clean room and bathroom. Didn't get to meet Teri but Paul was pleasant and welcoming. Thank you for the room!
231097,2471038,2012-10-01,230563,Barbara,"My daughter and I had a delightful stay...Paul and his family treated us like good friends, and we wished we had more time to spend with them. The room is pleasant, comfortable, and exactly as pictured; the house and property is lovely as well. The neighborhood is charming and very quiet.  A new kitten to play with was an added bonus!  "
231097,2599587,2012-10-13,383591,Burcu,"Hi, I am Burcu. I stayed at Paul's house for ten days. He and his lovely family are very nice and special people. I loved all of them. And their very sweet and funny cats :) 

Thank you all for everything. I hope I can visit you again.. And I hope you'll be my guest in Miami in the future. Take care.."
231097,2959763,2012-11-25,4079389,Cheryl,Very nice family. Very nice home. Love the cats even the little frisky one. Was glad I went in daylight hours to find the home as it almost is in like an alley.  Only complaint was could have provided me better weather.  ha ha!
231097,2984539,2012-11-27,75605,Steve,"The Higuchi family were a joy to get to know and the accommodations were comfortable.  Having a bathroom and lower floor room to ourselves, we were at home.

Paul the father was engaging and communicative.  Reiko stayed in touch with us and even helped our a couple of hours on our public art project.  
"
231097,3914421,2013-03-26,1024523,Denise & Kevin,Paul & Terry greeted us when we arrived and made us feel welcome from the beginning.  Our room was comfortable and next to a private bath.  Their location is far enough away from the city but close enough that we easily enjoyed the Seattle area with our family.
231097,5142770,2013-06-15,5884508,Diane,"The guest room was clean and comfortable. It was nicely decorated exactly as pictured. The room is very small, but includes everything we needed including internet. The family is very friendly. Parking is difficult everywhere in Seattle, but the family provides a parking space for guests.
"
231097,5186019,2013-06-17,5500025,Margaret,"Pleasant, airy home in a quiet neighborhood. The room was perfect for us with convenient private bath. Our host family was wonderful to talk to. I have nothing but good memories about this visit. I would highly recommend it."
231097,5515574,2013-07-03,1122278,Kathleen,"Paul and Terry were extremely accommodating and welcoming. The room and bathroom were immaculate and perfectly suited for our needs. Beautiful home and location, complete with friendly cats! Made our stay in Seattle homey and comfortable. "
231097,5616407,2013-07-08,5885920,Terri,"nice location on dead-end street in quiet neighborhood, designated parking space. Paul is friendly and available. i had to alter my reservation, no problem."
231097,5706054,2013-07-12,7192870,WahChin,The reservation was canceled 27 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
231097,5734576,2013-07-14,5215655,Lynn,My husband and I decided to celebrate our 25th anniversary in Seattle...we picked Paul and Terry's place..it was so peaceful and quiet. My only regret was that we spent so little time there we didn't get much of a chance to talk with them. They provide a parking space ( sometimes hard to come by!) and two friendly cats said hello! I would encourage anyone who wishes to stay in the north east area to consider Paul and Terrys. 
231097,5801573,2013-07-16,2538992,Owen,"Wow!  If you are ever in Seattle area, you must check out Paul and Terris beautiful and welcoming home. Lucy and I stayed here for two nights and were so grateful to have found this gem.  I had a bit of a cold and Terri made me a cup of my favorite tea from home.  We enjoyed wonderful conversation, two amazingly friendly cats and a comfortable bed in a nice quiet neighborhood.  We would stay here again in a heartbeat.  Thank you Paul and Terri for everything. Wish we could have stayed a bit longer!"
231097,5852986,2013-07-19,6629558,Chaitanya,Paul and Terry have a good nice home and the guest room is quite comfortable. 
231097,6550550,2013-08-16,5357398,Angela,"Paul and Terry have such a lovely, warm, and inviting home. I'm so glad that I chose to stay here. The bed was comfortable, everything was clean, the kitties were friendly, and the hosts were so kind. "

231097,6924260,2013-08-30,8235075,Therman,Staying here was perfect for me. I was in walking distance of everything I needed and the hosts were totally accommodating. The space is beautiful even better than the pics if that is possible. I will want to stay again!
231097,7040382,2013-09-04,7876628,Linya,"Paul and Terry are really nice and generous host. The house is very pretty as shown in the picture, and too bad our plans were too packed that we didn't spend much time chilling inside. The bedroom and restroom are clean with plenty of blankets and towels, even a fresh flower in the room. They also prepare guiding information of Seattle in the room, which is very sweet. There are two friendly orange cats in the house and we had fun playing with them. There's also a parking place for our rental car right in front of the house. We enjoy our time in Seattle with such nice hosts.  "
231097,7313942,2013-09-15,8366129,Pablo,"Had a great time, thanks for everything!"
231097,7774621,2013-10-02,8213793,Maddie,"My boyfriend and I stayed with Paul and Terry for a little under a week during our relocation from Boston to Seattle. We had an incredible time, comfortable stay and enjoyed great company! Paul and Terry are so kind and have a very welcoming home. Our room was comfortable, private, clean and had it's own bathroom. We cooked many meals using Paul and Terry's well equipped kitchen. We feel very lucky to have stayed with Paul and Terry and definitely recommend their airbnb. We look forward to seeing Paul and Terry in the community and hopefully for dinner sometime!"
231097,8031042,2013-10-13,7071325,Hemmo,"Paul and Terry are great, great hosts. Their home is beautiful. We had the ground floor to ourselves during the stay, with our own bathroom. Very comfortable. We really enjoyed meeting Paul and Terry, they are the friendliest of people. The house is a 15 minute bus ride away from downtown Seattle, after a short walk. We would happily recommend this home to any and all travelers. It´s cozy, private, the air is fresh, and it will be the best night´s sleep you´ve had in a while. I guarantee it!"

They are extremely helpful, kind, and flexible with our schedules. The price is reasonable, and worth every penny. The room looked cozy and well decorated when we arrived. The private bathroom is clean and well maintained. The kitchen and the dinning room was a joy to hang out at. My friends and I truly enjoyed staying at this beautiful home-feeling house. Paul and Terry's cats are friendly and affectionate. The neighbor is very safe and walkable. 
Overall, the logistics would definitely be one of the highlights visiting Seattle! "
