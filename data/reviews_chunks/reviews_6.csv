Check-in and out was easy. I loved having laundry in the unit and a full kitchen. 
Wifi was great and the neighboring apartments were quiet. Much improved experience over past visits when I stayed at a hotel with many groups of kids. 
The bed was great and the unit had a roku box for Netflix and other services. 
I will try to book this same condo every year I return.

8015531,52898422,2015-11-02,11735525,Vivian,Charlotte's place was very convenient to the Public Market. The place was clean and quiet. Check-in instructions were very straight forward. I highly recommend this place!
8015531,53139235,2015-11-05,11884130,Robert,Charlottes place was great. Absolutely perfect location!
8015531,53372115,2015-11-08,8953272,Tyler,"Awesome setup. Great location, really close to the market and water. Walking distance to both Bell Harbor Conf. Center and WA State Conv. Center.  Charlotte is excellent to work with and very accommodating. I would definitely stay again. "
8015531,53664171,2015-11-10,48070471,Brenda,"Great place near Pike Place Market! My husband and I loved the apartment and would definitely stay there again! It was comfortable, quiet, and clean and the host answered any questions in a timely manner. Much better than staying in a hotel! There's a deli/convenience store very close by for snacks and beverages. We didn't use the parking that Charlotte suggested because we had already parked a few blocks away and just decided to leave the car there for the night. We will probably use the parking next time, or the online valet parking app, Zirx that she suggested. Great experience overall!"
8015531,53830563,2015-11-13,46433924,Jenny,"Had a great stay at this lovely studio apartment. Loved the location, smooth check in process and very clean and comfortable. Thank you for my first great air bnb experience!"

8015531,55828491,2015-12-06,18450274,Elaine,"Great location. The apartment is in the heart of downtown, a couple blocks from Link Light, Pike Place, ferries, clean, and perfect size for a couple.

8015531,56394780,2015-12-13,32588176,Katelyn,Awesome location downtown! My mom and I were able to walk to almost every restaurant we ate at during our stay. Pike place market is easily accessible so we had fun exploring the different vendors. 
8015531,56676092,2015-12-16,22772574,Adele,"The pictures looked exactly like the place. Being downtown was great, we were walking distance from many of Seattle's best attractions. The place was quiet and very clean. We would absolutely stay here again."
8015531,56876428,2015-12-19,18011936,Jody,Charlotte responded quickly to my inquiries and her directions were very clear regarding how to get into the apartment upon arrival. 
8015531,56921844,2015-12-20,35326040,Jennifer,We loved being close to everything downtown. This was the perfect place for us to crash in between our adventures. 
8015531,57156474,2015-12-22,41855304,Richard,"Great location and huge space. It's really nice to have the full kitchen, would definitely stay again."
8015531,57292666,2015-12-24,26658653,Vincent,It is a pretty convenient location. Clean and cozy.
8015531,57918050,2015-12-30,31252688,Ruixi,"Charlotte is very nice person, she solved a lot problem for me, we have good exchange. When I was arrived early than my plan, I was call she, and she give me a nice place to sleep. Her apartment is very clean, quiet, and it's have nice view out of windows. This apartment in the 1st Ave, this street is main street in Seattle, it's easy go to anywhere, you just walk 5min you can arrived the pike place market, if you like art, it opposite Seattle Art Museum. It's a good experience for me. "
8015531,58315004,2016-01-02,34614144,Louise,"Check in instructions were clear which made the process easy, the apartment is as described and was close to everything we needed. The wifi wasn't working when we arrived but the host had communicated this prior to arrival and was able to amend this the next day."

7773668,44203711,2015-08-24,2988585,Richard,"Great location great room great host . Made my stay in Seattle very enjoyable . Good communication and very helpful. Highly recommend , top marks . If this room is available book it . "
7773668,45230258,2015-08-31,1392683,Scott,"Christopher is a fantastic AirBnb host: friendly, welcoming and knowledgeable about the Seattle area. The room itself was very clean and comfortable. Next time I stay in Capitol Hill this is the place to be!"
7773668,45999506,2015-09-07,9703237,Surag,"Michael made us feel very welcome throughout our stay in his apartment. We got to the apartment late on the day we checked in, but Michael made sure to contact us and made arrangements for us to get the keys. Every night after we came back from a long day of exploring, we would end up hanging out with Michael in the kitchen for hours talking about our day and what else we could do and see during our trip. It was always a nice way to end the day. 

The listing description was accurate. The room was very comfortable and the entire apartment was clean. We also enjoyed the neighborhood in which the apartment was located. There were a lot of coffee shops and bars within walking distance, while downtown and many other places to see were a quick cab ride away. 

If you're looking for a centrally-located and cozy place to stay in Seattle with a great host, I would definitely recommend staying in Capitol Hill with Michael!"
7773668,47217086,2015-09-16,8285434,Jake And George,Michael was very helpful and communicative. He gave me great tips of where to go eat and even took the time to show me around different neighborhoods and Capitol Hill. His apartment was clean and close to everything!!! I would stay again and recommend to anyone who wants to be close to downtown and Capitol Hill. 
7773668,48208846,2015-09-24,42862816,Daniel,"Michael was a wonderful host. He's friendly, respectful, and very knowledgeable about Seattle and the surrounding areas. He has great ideas of where to visit and what to do. He went above and beyond to accommodate my needs as a guest.
The description of the listing was accurate. It is clean, comfortable, and quiet. It is in close walking distance to many of the prime Seattle locations.
I highly recommend staying with Michael, as you will truly get the most out of Seattle from this location, and with Michael's recommendation."
7773668,48791725,2015-09-28,39391731,Arielle,Michael was such an amazing host! For the first time ever using air b&b I am completely overwhelmed by the graciousness and the kindness Mikey has shown my friend and I. Room looked exactly like what the pictures had shown and everything was clean and comfy from the bathroom to the living room. We even walked around downtown Sunday and hung out and watched the Seahawks game with me! His apartment is in a prime location in capital hill and I would totally stay with him again when I come back and visit Seattle. Thanks Mikey!!!! You're the best!!!!! 
7773668,49815082,2015-10-06,43669682,Chuck,"Michael is an excellent host. He is very friendly and helpful with advice about navigating the city. The apartment is clean, comfortable, and very conveniently located. There were many nice restaurants within walking distance, and we easily got to all the attractions in CityPass with minimal use of Lyft, etc. Michael is also very flexible as far as coordinating check-in and check-out times. Next time I'm in Seattle I plan to stay with Michael again. Thanks for a great visit to Seattle Michael!"
7773668,50360089,2015-10-11,37704952,Jimmy,"This room is in the ultimate spot for walking around Seattle. We walked everywhere and back and loved it. The room was clean and provided plenty of room for the two of us, and Michael was a great host. If you're heading to the city and plan to be out and about, this is the place to stay. Great location, great local bars, restaurants and coffee. Do it!"
7773668,51619450,2015-10-22,9760667,Rene,"Michael is a very cool guy! I felt very welcome to his place. The apartment is very clean, the bed comfortable, and it is so close to many restaurants, coffee shops, bars, convenience stores, bus stops, even a library a couple of blocks away. 

And Michael knows Seattle well, that was very helpful! "
7773668,51979431,2015-10-25,45766699,Shawn,"Michael was nice and very friendly and talkative! My friend and I felt very welcome. The room was wonderful, the bed was amazingly soft, and the apartment was very cute and had a great view. Michael was very accommodating and had cookies ready for us the second we walked in! The apartment is right in Capitol Hill and is very close to everything. We had no issues walking to most places we wanted to go. There is a convenience store located right next to the apartment complex which is very useful and has an ATM inside. Overall, our trip was amazing and was made all the better by having chosen this spot! "
7773668,53287111,2015-11-07,32170561,Manju Prasad,Michael's place is very neat & clean in downtown . Michael is compassionate person and made my stay very comfortable. I definitely recommend his place and I look forward to see him again.
7773668,54151107,2015-11-16,4339453,Stephany,"Michael was a great host! The room and apartment were exactly as pictured - beautiful and very clean. Michael was very welcoming and inviting, he made us feel right at home and offered suggestions on places to visit in and around Seattle. Throughout my stay, he was very responsive with any questions I had.  I would highly recommend staying with Michael when visiting Seattle. "
7773668,54935319,2015-11-25,49098980,Vashkar,Michael is wonderful host and very helpful. His apartment is very clean and conveniently located. He is good at providing tips regrading places to visit in Seattle and takes good care. Great experience and will definitely stay at his next time I visit Seattle.
7773668,54997667,2015-11-27,14405307,Elisabeth Or John,"Michael greeted us very warmly as we arrived . His lovely place is very tastefully decorated and immaculate!! He shared a bottle of wine with us as well as some homemade treats he had. YUM!!

He gave us a lot of great ideas of where to go, what to see, and how to get there.  The bed was super comfortable and the apartment was nice and warm... But not too warm; just right!  In fact I could sum up our stay at Michael's as ""JUST RIGHT.""  ... and by right I mean PERFECT!"
7773668,55944706,2015-12-07,48969349,Malcolm,"Michael was very accommodating, friendly and very welcoming.   He gave great suggestions for where to go and what to do, and was a great dude to hang with.  This was my first AirBnB trip and was just perfect - Michael is a perfect host and keeps a wonderfully clean and resourceful home..."
7773668,56359759,2015-12-12,34702917,Feng,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7773668,57664295,2015-12-28,47350922,Yuzhu,"During our stay in Seattle, it happened to be Christmas holiday so we didn't see Michael because he was with his family. But he was really helpful and friendly in phone calls and messages! His place was very clean and convenient for visitors in downtown. It was a really nice time in Seattle for my friend and me!!❤"
7649837,41048112,2015-08-03,116057,Ian And Val,"Nice apartment with great amenities. We were there during a summer heatwave and there was no ac or a fan. We literally barely got a wink of sleep due to just dying of heat. Wish we could have enjoyed the space but it was just too hot. 

"
7649837,41695423,2015-08-08,39522950,文涛,房主炒鸡友好热心负责，房子环境条件炒鸡赞，studio非常整洁，房子距离UW很近生活很方便，房间里日常用品齐全生活十分舒适。好评！
7649837,42940543,2015-08-16,17473151,Gary,"I did not meet Luyan but she was the most gracious communicator.
  
The studio itself was indeed upscale as advertised and well stocked with goodies provided by the host.  The location of the studio is  a good base to see the main attractions of Seattle.  The neighborhood seemed safe and close to Trader Joes and other stores.

Like the previous reviewer, I was there during a heat wave and the studio was very warm during the day and through a good part of the night.  I can say that is was somewhat uncomfortable. Perhaps if a fan was provided it would help. 

The main bed was comfortable.  The other sofa bed was small and short, so if you are over 5"" 6"" or so, you probably wont be comfortable sleeping in it. 

 If you have a car, I found the free parking in the neighborhood to be challenging.  The closest parking was mostly required but there is unrestricted parking on the over side of 45th St but it was hard at times to find a free spot.  There are also some paid parking lots not too far away - but I'm a cheapskate and I did not use them.  

There is constant noise, day and night, from the freeway when the window is open.  This may be an issue if you are sensitive to noise.

The key pickup and drop off was through the service KeyCafe and is located at a nearby coffeehouse, Trabant.  This process was relatively painless.  However, Trabant opens at 8:30 on Sunday and I had 6 a.m. flight so I had to have my daughter drop off the keys later.  A minor inconvenience but may be an issue for you if you do not have someone to drop off the keys for you.

The internet wifi is very fast and I was able to hook up my iPad with the provided cable to the TV and stream movies.  I don't think there were cable TV channels available.

Luyan does not charge a cleaning deposit so the studio is expected to be left clean.  She is very clear on her expectations.  I didn't mind cleaning but this may not be everyone's cup of tea.

All in all, a nice studio in a convenient location that is priced right for this area with a friendly communicating host.
"
7649837,43144827,2015-08-17,40496718,Andrew,"Nice place, almost a hotel room, came as advertised. On the one hand there's cleaning, on the other hand there's saving the money. We lucked into a parking space right in front on Sunday night, had some good Greek food after a five minute walk. Convenient to U of W."
7649837,44001490,2015-08-23,40318322,Thomas,"Luyan is a great host and her place is wonderful. She is very helpful, communicates with her guests very well, and even provides lovely snacks. The apartment is very nice with an awesome view of the city. Some may see the required cleaning as a drawback, but Luyan has set everything up so that it's really quite effortless. The area was wonderful too; it had lots of restaurants and bars nearby, and is just a quick ride to downtown or Ballard. I'd love to stay at Luyan's the next time I visit Seattle, I had a wonderful stay."
7649837,44686404,2015-08-28,34237562,Ying,"Luyan is a very responsible host and I spent two great nights at her place. 

Before I arrive, she sent me a clear and detail apartment guide which contained basically everything I need to know for my stay. Her apartment was nice and clean, close to UW and downtown. 

Since I was travelling alone, I had some safety concerns at the very beginning. After I arrived, I found I didn't need to worry about it at all. The neighborhood is safe. In addition, there is on-site building management staffs. Moreover, a key fob is needed in order to get in the building and use the elevator. 

"
7649837,45894102,2015-09-06,23181951,Nina,"Great location, modern and clean apartment, all you need for a weekend in Seattle. "
7649837,46796470,2015-09-13,13206497,Andrew,"Great place, good location, inexpensive, although the stay was a little bumpy for us. The apartment felt like a very cozy dorm and was very lovely. We had an amazing time in Seattle, and this spot was a perfect launching pad. You do have to do all your own cleaning (and it's a bit of work) but we knew that going in, but somehow we forgot to do the dishes amid mopping, vacuuming, laundry and trash duty :( . Luyan was very responsive, and although it was a little tricky to arrange pickup and drop off of keys with her being out of town - our key pickup window was very small due to flying in at 1145pm and the cafe we were supposed to drop the keys off at was closing down permanently the next day. Everything worked out in the end though! And we even got to spend some quality time on the roof which was furnished and had an awesome view. I highly recommend this lovely pad, and I'd probably stay there again next time I'm in Seattle!"
7649837,47783951,2015-09-21,1814703,Emma,"Luyan was a very responsive host who clearly cares that those using the space feel comfortable and welcome. She was mostly prompt with email responses to any questions that I had. However, I do not think that the first word in the title of the apartment can be 'Clean' -- I got this place for my parents and when we all walked in, there were dirty dishes in the sink and the bathroom clearly had not been cleaned for a while. 

The location is great, the price is also good for the location -- my folks liked the bed a lot and slept well, they also felt very safe since the apartment is on the 7th floor. 

If you plan to do any cooking, there are extremely limited cookware supplies - we struggled to find plates, cups and a coffee pot - so I would not plan on eating in. "
3308825,14670041,2014-06-23,9601020,Maryline,"Fantastic place ! Quiet and friendly, the beautiful view is not the only advantage, Carla and her husband are wonderful persons, interesting, funny and really helpful which share with you good adresses, time, coffee.. it is a great pleasure and chance to meet them. You have a large bedroom, nice, very clean and you own bathroom. The access to Seattle center is really easy by water taxi which is in front of the place and take a quarter. Beautiful!! , you can rent bicycle, run close to the see and have fun. Thank you so much ! "
3308825,15020807,2014-06-30,17331638,Bill,"Carla and Rob are great hosts.  You will have your own nice room and private bath. The view of the Seattle skyline is great day and night!  The convenience of the downtown water taxi right out the front door makes Seattle events and shopping a breeze. You are also sitting right on the Alki Beach waterfront so a mile seaside walk around the corner puts you in great restaurants, a beach volleyball game or a front row seat to an Olympic Peninsula Sunset!!  The King County free shuttle makes it accessible without the hike!  Enjoy!  Thanks Carla and Rob. "
3308825,15793304,2014-07-15,17712763,Bruce,"Our recent stay at “Great Room with a Gorgeous View.” 
 was fabulous.  This was our first experience sharing space with Airbnb hosts and Carla and Rob made it easy and comfortable.  Even though we shared  the common spaces, we never felt crowded and always seemed to have all the privacy we needed.

Even during the booking process, Carla & Rob shared restaurant recommendations for the time we were to be spending in Victoria, B.C. Then, upon arrival they graciously included us in a trip to the grocery store and provided refrigerator and storage space for our food items.

Carla was very attentive and provided us with excellent information on the surroundings.  We all enjoyed a leisurely exchange of life stories over coffee in the mornings, finding that we had several common interests.  

Our room had a beautiful view of the city, as advertised.  We spent many enjoyable evenings on the balcony; the view of Seattle’s skyline offering an ever changing panoramic delight to the eyes.

The kitchen space was user friendly, the dining space pleasant (although we usually ate on the balcony) and the separate bathroom was clean and uncluttered.

Their attention to detail, such as water in the room and bath robes for use, contribute to the feeling that Carla and Rob really care about providing an exceptional experience.  We feel honored to have been provided with the opportunity to share their special space and we will always have fond memories of our “Great Room with a Gorgeous View.” 
"
3308825,16272125,2014-07-24,3371427,Aline,"Carla & Rob are fantastic hosts. We felt at home immediately. They were away the day we arrived and had made all the arrangements for one of their friends to welcome us and show us around. They had even prepared a welcome plate of cheese and homemade salmon mousse:)

Their apartment has an incredible view of Seattle. It is a very special and convenient experience to take the water taxi right down their place and cross the bay to arrive downtown Seattle. 

You have your own room and private bathroom. Their place is very cozy and clean.

We also had great times chatting with our friendly hosts. 
"
3308825,16533578,2014-07-28,18843899,Karim,"Carla and Rob were terrific.  The home was clean and comfortable with cable TV in the bedroom, a spotless bathroom and fresh linens. The view was beautiful right over the ferry dock.  Rob left coffee ready for me to make for myself since I told him I'm an early riser. Carla, was up early anyway and prepared some breakfast too.

We spent some nice time chatting and at the end they even gave me a great music recommendation for a band I'm list in to right now.

Karim"
3308825,17005174,2014-08-05,8944175,Susan,"We stayed two nights here recently and it was a marvelous experience,  in every way.  Great location, amazing view.  Our hosts, Carla and Rob were so helpful and informative as we planned the remainder of our road trip.  As amazing as the place was, the hosts were more amazing.  Wished we'd had more time to hang out with them!"
3308825,17725676,2014-08-16,14711268,Greg,"Hospitality at its best. Friendly people, beautiful view and comfortable room. Carla and Rob are easy to connect with (and I'm an introvert). The King County Water Taxi leaves every half hour from across the street ($4.75) straight to downtown. I did not get a chance (yet) to investigate the Admiral District up the hill but plan to next time. Highest recommendation!"
3308825,18501187,2014-08-27,14711268,Greg,"Carla is a creative and enterprising host, and once again provided a great experience - food, conversation when desired, and generally lives out the reason why I choose this instead of a hotel. I didn't need a rental car this week because meetings were held downtown and I could take the water taxi across the bay. That in itself pays for the lodging. An excellent value - way beyond what money can provide."
3308825,18613499,2014-08-28,20275254,Jered,"A lovely host couple with a lovely home! Our stay was all too brief but entirely wonderful! The view, hospitality, ambiance, and food were gorgeous. Do your self a favor and stay here.  "
3308825,18819076,2014-09-01,19355878,Josh,"Carla was a great host!  She gave us lots of ideas for restaurants and things to see around the city and was very welcoming!  I would stay here again, thanks Carla & Rob!"
3308825,21437125,2014-10-17,14711268,Greg,"Wonderful, as usual. Great fun and generous people with a comfortable place and handy to work downtown - or just enjoy."
3308825,35178847,2015-06-15,9236414,Mark,"Carla invited me into her home as an honored guest and a dear friend.
What more can one say? Well the views were spectacular too!"
3308825,37494652,2015-07-07,23094858,Diane,"Carla and Rob made me feel like an old friend coming to visit. They are both genuinely interested in other people's adventures and stories and enjoy meeting new people and it shows. 

The apartment is exactly as described but the view is even better than the pictures. Lovely to be so close to the buzz of Seattle but minutes from beach as well. "
3308825,38343166,2015-07-14,35023165,Shaye,"I cannot describe this stay in this stupid comment box! It was amazing!!! I recommend it to anyone, easily, Rob and Carla were amazing and it was more than just an airbnb stay, I honestly made new friends. Both Rob and Carla were more than happy to help with any questions and showed me around whenever I needed it. Carla was extremely welcoming from start to finish and the hospitality was amazing."
3308825,38683179,2015-07-17,24207759,Mehdi,Carla and Rob have a wonderful apartment in West Seattle with amazing view of downtown and easy access to the city. They are truly nice people and beautiful inside out. I stayed for a night and my room and my bed were perfectly clean and comfortable and my stay overall was terrific. Carla had prepared some amazing smoothie and coffee in the morning which was the highlight of my day. I highly recommend them as hosts!
3308825,38795983,2015-07-18,38473967,John,"We thoroughly enjoyed our time here; Carla made us feel very welcome. The room was very clean, and the view is _awesome_. We had a great time. "

They both made us feel so welcome, had wonderful fresh coffee for us each morning & even made us home made banana bread!  
They were very helpful,  and gave us space to enjoy our time there.
We would stay with them again in a minute-  We loved West Seattle also-  Very quaint and a neat part of the city to explore. 
Thanks Carla & Rob for a most enjoyable experience with you!

3402376,16574337,2014-07-29,12522359,Greg,"I would definately recommend staying at Chad's place.  It's a cute little, nicely renovated home in a great neighborhood in West Seattle.  The house is very clean and had everything we needed.  Very nice hosts. 

Very close to a Main Street with all the amenities, including restaurants and shops.  Definately check out trader joes for groceries, close by.  Farmers market just up the street on Sundays.  Beautiful walk on the sea wall minutes away, with amazing sunset.   Chad was great with giving us a list of nearby restaurants to check out.  Downtown was only a 10 min drive, although you can also take the water taxi across too.  

I will definately stay at Chad's again when I return to Seattle.  

Thank you Chad"
3402376,18892261,2014-09-02,12239906,Jude,"This little house is great; everything was presented accurately.  The place was clean and bed was super comfy. We were able to bring our dog, and the fenced backyard was a huge plus. The only possible downside I can think of to mention is that since the house is old and small, noises carry so there's not a lot of privacy between the bathroom and two bedrooms - no big deal, but people some may care.

I fell in love with West Seattle on this trip! The house is in a quiet, very cute residential area with shops and restaurants within easy walking distance. There's a great Farmers Market on Sunday (10am-2pm). Chad gave us a list of his recommended spots in the area to check out, and generously offered his public transit pass to us. As a host he gave us the perfect amount of space yet attentiveness.  Thanks for everything, Chad!"
3402376,24409481,2014-12-28,3527033,Phil,"Beautiful place located right in the heart of West Seattle. Even nicer than the pictures. Far better than you'll ever do renting a suite at a hotel. Just minutes from downtown.

Chad was a great host who answered questions quickly and efficiently. Towels and bedding were excellent and the place was super clean when we arrived."
3402376,25001592,2015-01-04,466520,Jon,"Staying at Chad's house was a dream. We go to Seattle every year but this was the first time we tried out West Seattle. I personally love staying at places that are incredibly thoughtful and comfortable. All the little details around the house, from the Nest thermostat, to the OneFortyThree light fixtures to the Rudy's shampoo in the shower culminated in a place that felt like home, in a new neighborhood. 

There was some confusion when we booked but it ended up working out perfectly. Chad was great about calling when we arrived to make sure we had everything and had some great recommendations. I would highly recommend staying here! "
4402880,50275307,2015-10-11,37904621,Garrett,"The apartment had pretty much everything we were looking for. Our host was running a bit late for our early check-in, but he was very friendly and accommodating once he arrived. The apartment was clean and spacious, and we really enjoyed the outside seating area. It could be a bit noisy at times, but quiet hours began around 10:30pm so it wasn't really a problem."
4402880,51653034,2015-10-22,44740842,Jacob,Really enjoyed the apartment. It was very clean and the attractions were all close enough to walk to. We had more than enough room to relax and enjoy seattle life. The courtyard was close by. The ac unit kept everything comfortable and the apartment was very quiet. The only noise we could here while staying was the neighbors upstairs who stomped for a bit during the afternoon.
8608525,52516828,2015-10-30,14800578,Eugene And Fiona,I stayed at Martha’s townhome for over a week and enjoyed every bit of it. Her place is immaculate and perfectly setup for Airbnb. The front door has keycode entry so checking in was a breeze. She has all the essentials in the bathroom and kitchen so you’ll be fine even if you only bring a toothbrush. The townhouse is newer construction as you can see in the pictures and it’s very maintained. Martha is on top of things and very easy to communicate with. Her place has central heat but knowing I’m from California she even brought an electric heater in case I got cold at night. I’ll definitely recommend this place to my family and friends.
2396734,11246896,2014-03-26,6152081,Shelly,"This two bedroom condo in Ballard is a delightful and accommodating space outfitted with all you need for you stay.  It is close to two great streets for shopping, including casual cafes and fine dining, grocery, books, etc.

Mario was a terrific host, very responsive and personable.  I called about wifi and he called right back to help me get on the right network, adding that he hoped our stay would be pleasant and to let him know if we need anything else. 

We highly recommend this condo and look forward to our next stay!"
2396734,12655497,2014-05-07,5678440,Matthew,"This is why I love AirBnB.  We couldn't ask for a better space, location, and host. The top floor of Mario's place was perfect for the 4 of us (two couples).  Amazing coffee shops, a cute bakery, and great local bars all within walking distance and still close enough for a quick drive downtown. The house was stocked with everything we could possibly need and kept immaculately. Having a dedicated parking spot was really great too as parking can be a hassle depending on where you are.  I would definitely stay here again next time I visit lovely Seattle.  "
2396734,19586195,2014-09-15,12799013,Sal,"Mario's home was exactly how it was explained in the listing. It was clean and bright and he had all the creature comforts that anyone could possibly need. Mario is a very gracious host and willing to oblige you with whatever you may need. 
I would highly recommend staying at Mario's home to anyone. 
Thank you again Mario,
Ceci & Sal Giordano. "

2396734,20992960,2014-10-09,2294068,Anthony,"We stayed for a whole week in Mario's amazing upstairs loft unit.  The unit was perfect for us and had everything we needed.  It's located in a great area (Ballard) that has dining, shopping, and great sights all within walking distance.  While we didn't need the extra room, the unit is extremely flexible with the upstairs loft beds to accommodate additional guests.  Also very nice was the complimentary parking space for our rental car.  We loved our time in Seattle and would not hesitate to stay at Mario's unit again!"
2396734,21343799,2014-10-15,13317077,Ej,"The place and Mario were both outstanding. 

Plenty of room for the 6 of us. 

Mario was warm and inviting as we both happened to meet upon arrival. He had great recommendations on things to do and places to eat. 

The location is great. It was very close to downtown Ballard where there are a lot of great restaurants and bars. Short walk also down to the Locks and to Paseo's, a must go! Short bus ride into downtown Seattle and the bus stop is about 100 yards from the house. 

I would definitely stay here again! 
"
2396734,23522174,2014-12-03,922072,Sherry,"I have only positive comments! The apartment was fantastic, with plenty of room for our family (five adults). It's just a short walk to the restaurants and stores in Ballard, and from this location it's very easy to drive to other parts of Seattle. We appreciated the comfortable furniture and layout, the availability of a parking spot, and the fact that everything was so clean and spotless. Mario was very responsive and friendly. I just hope this space is available the next time we all travel to Seattle! "
2396734,23692660,2014-12-08,10535707,Nicole,"I really enjoyed the design of the building details and the efficient use of space.  The neighborhood was very walkable:  We bought groceries, did some window shopping, went to a CrossFit class and ate out for breakfast and dinner, each within a 15 minute walk of the house.  Mario was flexible and responsive and the house was comfortable and clean, quite perfect for our needs.  Thank you!"
2396734,28009044,2015-03-16,444413,Justin,"I had a few colleagues coming into town from Spain and needed a place for them to stay. Mario was very helpful throughout the entire process. The apartment was very clean, comfortable and in a great location. They had an excellent trip and will definitely be staying here again on their next visit!"
2396734,28868952,2015-03-31,3626797,Stephen,"Mario's place was perfect! We arrived and everything was spotlessly clean and just as described with a great kitchen with all the needed amenities.  The bed were very comfy and the linen was new and cozy plus access to free laundry, a gym and bikes! Highly recommended! We would stay there again in a heartbeat! Thanks."
2396734,29934523,2015-04-14,29609748,Ayelet,"We had a wonderful time at Mario's. The place is beautiful, new furnished,  clean and comfortable.  We had some questions, Mario respond instantly and was very nice and helpful. All in all, it was great!"
2396734,32032361,2015-05-12,32868260,Katelyn,"Clean, beautiful flat within walking distance to all the things we wanted to do. Mario made our first airbnb experience easy! If we are in your vicinity again we'll definitely stay again!"
2396734,33018002,2015-05-24,30416731,Rachel,My family and I had a great stay and hope to stay here next time in the future!
2396734,33281781,2015-05-26,32134110,Morgan,"Mario was great to chat with through the entire reservation process! The condo was clean, organized, and had everything we needed for a fun weekend. The location was an easy walk to the heart of Ballard as well as the marina for kayaking and paddle boarding."
2396734,35543027,2015-06-20,29054320,Adrian,"Mario was doing some watering outside and greeted us on arrival, and just made sure we knew how to use the passcode to get into the unit. The neighborhood is nice, quiet residential with stores and restaurants nearby, easy access to bus/Metro, easy parking on the street. The unit was neatly furnished and worked out well for our two family group; two private bedrooms and sleeping lofts above for the kids. We all felt right at home. "
2396734,36576288,2015-06-29,32793051,Mandi,Mario's home was clean and stocked for everything we could have needed for a wedding weekend in Seattle. We would stay here again!
2396734,37554472,2015-07-08,684791,Jeanne,"The apartment was lovely, clean and and well-situated.  The beds were large and comfortable. Ballard is a hopping, trendy neighborhood, and we were able to catch the #40 bus to downtown from the corner - easy, peasy!

We had the misfortune of spending 1 1/2 weeks in Seattle during an historically hot and dry period (no clouds or rain!), and Mario came immediately when we called to check the central air.   

The lofts were fine for the teenagers we brought with us, but anyone who isn't young or who is prone to inebriation might find the ladders challenging to climb.  

I would unequivocally recommend this apartment, and Mario as a host."
2396734,38567302,2015-07-16,38297624,Alex,"Very welcoming, the neighbors were friendly. There is a bunch of construction going around next to the property, but the workers were definitely quiet and accommodating to the people around. House was a nice, tidy fit. I would definitely recommend staying there again. It was a real convenient area to be around everything at such a price!"
2396734,38977510,2015-07-20,7597627,Lindsay,"The listing description was very accurate, the house is actually larger in person than the pictures indicate. The lofted beds were very comfortable and Mario had fans upstairs to help control the room temperature. "
2396734,39906942,2015-07-27,524790,Nathaniel,Great place. Great location. Great city! Thanks Mario for the seamless experience !
2396734,41927355,2015-08-10,9132073,Johannes,"We had a very good experience staying in this house. It is only a walk away from the cool cafes and ship locks of Ballard, my favorite neighborhood of Seattle.

The house exceeded our expectations. It was more modern and more well lid than the pictures in the photos. There was tea and coffee and anything else we might desire, such as an iron board to iron our clothes before a wedding we were attending.

We had a few questions during our stay, for example at what time was checkout, and Mario was were quick and helpful in his responses. Overall, we had a perfect rental experience."
2396734,45270181,2015-09-01,35480074,Khara,"Mario's place was great for my party. The lofts were spacious, bathroom was clean and cute with plenty of amenities."
2396734,51285327,2015-10-19,28715578,Erin,"This place worked great for our group of 8 close-knit adults. The interior was actually nicer and a bit larger than what I was expecting from the pictures. The location is a quiet neighborhood with ample street parking, yet an easy walk to plenty of restaurants, bars, and attractions in Ballard. The owner was also readily available via text to answer any questions."
3534364,15740867,2014-07-14,17940462,Oliver,"Nice location, centrally located.  Great view!  Host was very helpful and communicated well.  Room was simple and clean with full kitchen.  Would stay here again."

3534364,17398506,2014-08-11,8516735,Nicole,"We had the privilege of absolutely gorgeous  weather while visiting Seattle for a quick weekend trip. We spent most of our time walking to nearby restaurants, bars, jogging to Kerry Park and checking out Pike Street Market. The location was perfect! We also spent an entire afternoon on the rooftop deck enjoying wine and snacks while taking in the incredible views of the water. Turn around- there's the Space Needle! The location and the roof top deck are the two glowing characteristics of this studio.
It is an extremely sleepy building- we didn't run into another tenant the entire weekend.

It is a stereotypical bachelor pad. It lacked basic things like a can-opener, toaster, decent cookware or knives. If you're planning to cook it is not ideal.
It was also pretty dirty in my opinion. The kitchen garbage was left full, shower was dirty, grimey kitchen towels, old & warn bath towels, etc.
The studio doesn't have air conditioning, but he has on small fan available for air flow.

All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our trip, but would have preferred a cleaner space.


"
3534364,18825898,2014-09-01,9910792,Bridget,"Calvin's loft was clean, convenient, and exactly as advertised. It was in a great location- quiet but close enough to walk to interesting food, drinks, and attractions. The rooftop deck is gorgeous. Thanks, Calvin, for a great weekend!"
3534364,29124817,2015-04-04,25139315,Joshua,"Apt was great location, walking distance to pikes place and space needle. No tv which didn't matter since we were busy anyway. I worked from apt at small desk using wifi, it was peaceful watching bay and birds. Bed was clean and comfy. Grocery store isn't that close so be prepared to walk a bit of you don't have a rental and plan on cooking a lot. All in all it was perfect for our stay and we would book again. Calvin is very helpful and easy going. Oh, and there's a fireplace that's operated by a lightswitch which make the chilly and rainy days feel nice and cozy!"
3534364,34359080,2015-06-07,6667219,Caitlin,"This was a wonderful stay. Calvin's apparently has a breathtaking view and everything was as described. The location and roof top deck were the best parts. It is just a short walk away from a cute coffee shop, numerous restaurants (the Innkeeper was my fav) and of course Pikes Place Market. The only small downside was that there is no air conditioning which was tough one night, and the apartment could be a little cleaner as a whole. Otherwise, 5 stars!!"
3534364,41860677,2015-08-09,23679882,Xiaoxing,"Calvin's apt has incredible view! You can see Seattle harbor from the window. The apt is located in downtown Seattle. It takes 5-10 mins walk from his place to Space Needle, and 10 mins drive to Pike Place. There are many nice restaurants nearby, and some of them open until 2am. It's very convenient if you don't have a car. There is a bus stop around his apt. 

Calvin is very friendly and helpful. He replies my message very fast and gives me a lot of advice.   "
3534364,47085734,2015-09-15,34398603,Ray,"Calvin's place was awesome the location is great, centrally located between Pike Place and the Seattle Center. The is view is phenomenal! I was amazed! From the bed you can look out on Elliot Bay and the surrounding mountains. Calvin was a great host, he was out of town when we arrived but his communication was almost instant over the phone! Would love to stay here again! Thanks again Calvin you rock!"
4022127,24505301,2014-12-29,25018652,Benjamin,"Francesco and Pamela were excellent hosts communicating early and often to make our stay enjoyable. House is immaculate with comfortable furnishings. Two bedrooms came in handy when one of us snores. Kitchen was stocked with enough cooking and eating accessories to enjoy a nice meal. Be sure to turn on the fans and maybe crack a window or the smoke alarm will go off. If you like to watch TV, hope you like Fox. But being across the street from the beach and close to downtown, not a lot of time to spend indoors. The bedrooms might be cold for some people, but I thought it the perfect temperature. Would definitely stay here again, so book it early if you are coming for a visit."
4022127,24800336,2015-01-02,4382677,William,"I had an excellent experience in this bnb! The host was very accommodating, and provided superb hospitality. The location was awesome. I was able to run along he coast, and see a spectacular view of downtown Seattle. "

4022127,25635041,2015-01-21,23681243,Mark,"I really enjoyed the very large two bedrooms in this rental. It was perfect for my mother and I. I especially liked waking up in the morning and seeing the beautiful water and magnificent mountain range in the distance. This unit was about 30 feet from the beach area. We were able to walk to the local café which also had amazing views. there were plenty of food selections nearby and driving to downtown Seattle was a quick 10 to 15 minute drive. Period. All highway.  this two-story rental had the bedrooms and bath upstairs, and the kitchen was Nice we stocked with all things we needed.  There was no cable TV, nor a method to access the Internet from the TV, however, this did not seem to be a problem because we were always on the go, on the beach, or at the café.  The host for very friendly and positive. They asked several times if we needed anything.  what a great location to enjoy the hippie culture in Seattle, and yet be so close to the city itself! "
4022127,25970310,2015-01-31,8142956,David,"I stayed in this airbnb while in transit to move permanently to Seattle. Having spent the past a couple weeks apartment searching I can say that this place is definitely the best value in west Seattle if not in all of Seattle. You are walking distance to everything alki beach. If you are lucky enough to be there on a clear day, the views are epic! The place is very functional, we cooked a lot without problems. I have to say that the best part about this rental was the hospitality of Francesco and Pam. I was in a new city and not only did they direct me to the best restaurants, grocery stores,etc, they also went so far to introduce us to their friends in the neighborhood. We loved the experience of alki beach so much, that we have since signed a long term lease less than a mile away."
4022127,26194920,2015-02-06,20630621,Ken,"Francesco met me as scheduled and showed me around the appartment. It was as discribed on the AIRBNB  site. The furniture and bed were very comfortable and then there is location, location, location, ALKI. The beach is about 150 feet away and there are plenty of restruants, coffee shops on every block. "
4022127,26509988,2015-02-14,27501285,Sean,"The place was great, awesome location. Close enough to the city to get there easily, removed enough to not deal with traffic etc. thanks! "
4022127,26613536,2015-02-16,8162300,Hawley,Francesco is friendly and accessible and left us feeling like we had a private space.  The unit was immaculate !! It is perfect for relaxing at the beach and close to fun places to eat.
4022127,27131943,2015-02-26,6340984,Jim,"The Alki Town house was great for our needs, comfortable, clean and convenient to Seattle. The location is especially good with a short walk to restaurants and the beach. Street parking can be problematic, there is a driveway that can be parked in but you will be blocking it for others use. Since the TV is on an antenna the signal some times is not the best, part of picture can be wavy.  It would have been nice to have a dresser in the bedroom so you could unpack your suitcase. It also would have been nice to have ice trays for the freezer. The water flow in the shower was very limited and needs improvement. Besides these small things we had a nice stay and will defiantly consider the Alki town house for our yearly visit to the Seattle area."
4022127,27401191,2015-03-03,2487422,Peter,Francesco's apartment was as described. We stayed for 5 nights. Location is excellent (right on Alki beach) with restaurants close by and beautiful views. The host was very responsive and checked in with us several times. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Highly recommended. 
4022127,27591947,2015-03-08,26598245,Beverly,Excellent.  Very accommodating   Would have liked a rack or something for luggage as I was very careful about floors. The floors were very nice.  Excellent location   Being on Alki is always fun.  Thanks for everything.  
4022127,28467818,2015-03-24,26591014,Frank,"Francesco was a perfect host. He was available to us when we had questions and was very quick with his responses. 
The listing is described perfectly and it was across the street from the beach.
"
4022127,28622844,2015-03-27,1416152,David,"This apartment was perfectly situated next to Alki Beach, great location with a lot of great people. All rooms were clean, beds very comfortable and the apartment was equipped with everything you need for a stay. Lovely hosts, friendly and helpful, would really recommend to book this apartment always another time again! Enjoyed our stay, was really short but perfect! Grazie Mille :) Ci vediamo un altra volta! David and Dave :) -"
4022127,29104086,2015-04-04,12922301,Jean,"As other reviewers have said, the location of this home couldn't be better! Steps from the beach, restaurants, and shops. The beds and couches were comfy. The TV wasn't working-wavy lines through most of the screen, and Francesco told us we could bring another one down from upstairs, but we chose to just try and watch the one downstairs, which wasn't easy to do :) The kitchen has the basics, but nothing more. As others mentioned, parking can be a problem-we had to park over a block away a few times, which was ok because it wasn't raining!  Francesco responded quickly to our inquiries, and he and Pamela were friendly. All in all, if you're looking for a vacation by Alki Beach, this home will put you right by the action! "
4022127,29971223,2015-04-15,16791886,Marilyn,"A good beach access location.  Only a few hundred feet to the shore and great walking path along the water.  Easy to walk to restaurants, coffee, as Francesco described in the listing.  The beds were more comfortable than most beds we've had in our travels, and the couches were plentiful.  For a longer stay, drawers in the bedrooms would make life easier, as well as a more comfortable place to eat.  As mentioned in other reviews, parking is impossible.  Francesco was good enough to let us park beside the sidewalk, fortunately- or we would have been out of luck most times.  Also mentioned by others was the water pressure- which is very low- not sure how to remedy that.  Wifi was often difficult as well- so maybe a different router would help.  It was easy to communicate with Francesco.  "
4022127,30230374,2015-04-19,23167374,Adam,"Francesco was super easy to work with. We didn't cook at all while we were there, but the kitchen is pretty complete. The place is clean, Francesco is easy going, and the location of the place can't be beat! Would definitely stay here again. "
4022127,30550744,2015-04-24,28237712,Nick,"We had a great experience staying at this rental. Great location -- several good restaurants within walking distance and also just a quick drive to downtown and other areas in Seattle. We didn't really need Francesco for anything but he was willing to help with anything we needed. Great bargain for a two-bedroom apartment. As mentioned in other reviews, the water pressure is weak and parking can take a little work on sunny days since the beach is just steps away, but nothing that would prevent me from staying there again."
4022127,30671314,2015-04-26,2389605,Paul,Great little place right by the beach and close to everything on Alki. Very comfortable beds and tidy space. 
4022127,31935419,2015-05-12,22069129,Denny,"I used to live in Alki beach for 6 years,  and alki beach town house was one of the best places i have ever stayed.  

Francesco's place is just what we were looking for.  It was the PERFECT location. The town house was super clean and comfortable. Francesco was about as good as a house as you could ever want.  One of the coolest guys you will meet.  Alki is a beach town, and when the weather is nice, it get's PACKED. People watching and eating for days. you can walk and walk and never see everything.  You are 20 minutes from downtown seattle and 10 minutes to the admiral junction (which has lots of shops and great restaurants. 
Francesco's place is strolling distance to so many restaurants  , bars, water and beach activities .  It really is the best location anyone could ask for . 
It is hard to park on the weekend when the weather is nice, but during the week its a breeze.  There is free wi fi which was awesome so i could watch all my favorite shows on my ipad when it was relaxing time.  The beds are so comfortable, we found ourselves sleeping in a lot.  
in conclusion, if you want a beach experience like no other, but be close to downtown, the vashon island ferry, restaurants, bars, bike paths, walking paths, bike rentals, the whole shebang, look no further.  The price was amazing, the host was the best, and the place and location were perfect. "
4022127,32742907,2015-05-21,12729587,Erlend,"Vi ankom veldig sent 16.mai, natt til 17.mai mest grunnet flyet vi hadde fra Los Angeles var nesten 1.5 timer forsinket.

Francesco er veldig fleksibel og veldig imøtekommende og en trivelig vert å ha.

Leiligheten var ren og pen, 2 store dobbeltsenger på hvert rom. Passer perfekt for 2 voksne med 2 små barn, eller for 2 par som reiser sammen.

Nabolaget ligger som du selv vet på Alki Beach i Seattle, og det er mange restauranter og et svært trivelig området lang stranden. Det er mye folk når det er fint vær.

Det er parkering på gatenivå, og er gratis. Det er enkelt å finne parkering i området, men det er bare å snakke med huseier og han er fleksibel der til å hjelpe om det er problem med å finne (website hidden)! Spør huseier om restauranten ""La Rustica"". Dette er onkelen til Francesco som eier og vi fikk en meget god opplevelse der, god mat og god service. Anbefaler å ta turen innom der."
4022127,33002363,2015-05-24,32086643,Nicole,"Francesco was awesome! Very easy going and welcoming. The place was great as well and the location is unbeatable. If I were to ever come back, I would definitely want to stay here again!"
4022127,33211715,2015-05-25,31182085,Land,Francesco was a great host! He made it very easy for us to get into the unit. The space was lovely and Francesco was very friendly. Kind of like having a next door neighbor!
4022127,33445906,2015-05-28,21813931,Jill,"Location! Location! Location! Francesco's place locates just steps away from Alki Beach. The beach was great. We enjoyed the location a whole lot. However, the house could be cleaner. The house cleaner (s) certainly did not do a good job at keeping the place clean. Water pressure in the bathroom could be better as well. Francesco was a great host despite the cleanliness of the house. "
4022127,33541727,2015-05-29,6497912,Matt,"Great location, right by Alki beach and its amenities which was perfect for my wife and I + 2 small kids. Francesco was a great host and very flexible when we needed to move the dates of our staying. House amenities are quite basic but more than enough if you're just using it as a base."
4022127,33970322,2015-06-02,34358182,Rolland,"Excellent little beach house near Seattle. Friendly hosts live next door and were always available.
Great neiborhood, with great places to eat by the water and scenic views of the city.

Very clean, well kept and had everything you could need. Only thing that might need some updating is the couch.

Overall, great location for visiting Seattle."
4022127,34275377,2015-06-07,27746219,Shari,"Very friendly host.  The house was nice and clean and only 1 block from the beach and many restaurant choices.  Parking can be a hassle if the beach is busy, so keep that in mind.  Would recommend this place to anyone staying in Seattle."
4022127,34474483,2015-06-08,25839059,Jialin,"房屋的主人很親切，房子很乾淨寬敞，周圍的環境悠閒，房子後面就是海邊，離市區也不遠，是個遠離都市紛擾的好地方。
The host is really friendly, the house is clean and nice,  the beach is really close. The environment here is peaceful and quite, really like here and I'm willing visit here again."

Flera gånger under vistelsen frågade både Francesco och Pamela om allt var till belåtenhet,och det var det! Huset var rent och innehöll allt som lovat!"
4022127,35449807,2015-06-19,18145508,Clark,"Francesco made us feel welcome.  The apartment is clean and located close to the fun part of Alki beach.  It is somewhat noisy because of the activity, so bring ear plugs. The shower has a low volume."

4022127,36762895,2015-07-01,405261,Rebecca,"Francesco was a perfect next door neighbor ; friendly and quiet.  His listing is just as it is desctibed.  It is in a Perfect location to walk to everything and has a view.  No car needed.  Bring extra amenities for the beach, if you need them.  Bring shampoo and soap for bathing.  The towels are good ones.  The kitchen has everything except ice cube trays, but you can buy ice  close by.  We had no problem w street (website hidden) uses rabbit ears, so you get all the local channels."

There are huge television, comfortable couch and kitchen
appliances.

4022127,38980088,2015-07-20,25813630,Adrianne,"We met the host fewtimes...nice guy but not so helpful.  The location was good, right across from Alki beach, but noisy. You could hear every word passers by were saying even in a normal voice.  The wifi was very unstable and we complained almost every day but nothing was done.
The area has lots of restaurants."
4022127,39339872,2015-07-22,6811235,Josiah,"Really enjoyed our stay at Francesco's place! Clean, classy, well-furnished apt, great place right on the water, with so many restaurants and bars in walking distance. Francesco double checked mid-way through to make sure all was taken care of and that we didn't need for anything (we didn't!), which was a nice touch. Thanks for a great stay!"
4022127,39478321,2015-07-24,16597261,Lounas,"Very great place. The house is nice, a few meterd frim the beach. The host was available to answer our questions and tonmake sure everything was ok for us."
4022127,40197318,2015-07-29,9635476,Matthias,"Francesco ist ein sehr zuvorkommender Gastgeber, der uns freundlich empfangen hatte.
Das Haus liegt 20 Meter vom Alki Beach entfernt und ist bequem und ansprechend eingerichtet. Die zwei Schlafzimmer sind geräumig und haben sehr bequeme Betten.
Die Küche ist zweckmäßig eingerichtet - sie könnte mit ein paar Utensilien ergänzt werden.
Ungewöhnlich, jedoch auch so beschrieben, wird kein Kabelfernsehen angeboten. "
4022127,40719229,2015-08-02,27294958,Dean,"Hey Francesco, 
Your place was perfect. Wish we could have actually spent more time in the unit. Definitely would consider doing this trip again and booking your place. Next time a bit longer though. Great location. Thanks."
4022127,41597713,2015-08-08,33566798,Emily,"Great stay! Nice, clean accommodations and great location. Francesco made the check in/out easy and was thoughtful to check on us during our stay. If you are looking for a place on Alki Beach, you've found it!"
4022127,42245538,2015-08-12,7179832,Abbie,"Francesco's Akli Beach home was perfect - clean, comfortable, well equipped.  Two things were outstanding.  The beds were super comfortable and to location could not be beat.  Alki Beach is a fun, scenic spot with lots of things going on.  Being just 1/2 block off the strip gave us easy access, and a little quite.  Just perfect.  We have family in West Seattle and will definitely be staying at Francesco's again.  I highly recommend it."
4022127,43018590,2015-08-17,736468,John,Great location near everything Alki has to offer. Clean place with everything you need. Parking was a challenge since it gets pretty crowded on the streets. 
4022127,44104926,2015-08-24,436207,Stephen,"Had a wonderful time at Alki Beach Townhouse. The beach is 75 ft. from  the  front door. Great places to eat and drink within a short walk.  Great spot to just ""people watch"". Alki beach townhouse is the ""hidden gem""of Seattle's Airbnb. If we ever make it back to Seattle, we already know where we will be  staying."
4022127,44634486,2015-08-28,9979315,Chaim,"Francesco's place is the perfect spot for a great time in Seattle. Being steps away from great food and the beach, while having quick access to the freeway to get to the city is so convenient.

The place was clean and welcoming. Francesco was very attentive and prompt to answer all our questions and help us with any requests we had.

I would definitely stay again!"
4022127,45770607,2015-09-06,10482313,Tina,"Francesco was communicative before arriving. Apartment had everything we needed except a bar of soap in the shower, not a big deal. Location was amazing - yards from Alki beach and a great view, with fun places to eat and drink nearby. We were very happy to leave Seattle proper and get back to the beach!"
4022127,46467814,2015-09-11,32265845,Carolyn,"We loved this place! It is super close to the beach and really comfortable. Francesco is super friendly and easy to work with and checked on us throughout our stay. The restaurants around the house are great, and it really is only about 12 minutes to the downtown area. The views are beautiful too! Parking can be a little adventurous, but it is a very minor con to a giant list of pros. We would stay again in a hot second!"
4022127,46692158,2015-09-13,29413012,Suvi,We had a great time at Alki Beach. This home is just steps away from the beach and it was so convenient to be able to walk everywhere. Beds were comfy and clean. We didn't spend much time cooking but it looked like a fully stocked kitchen.
4022127,47474420,2015-09-19,30666452,Lynnette,"Francesco and Pam so helpful ! The beach literally 75 feet from my door the condo was clean and cute ! So many little shops and restaurants , coffee shops in walking distance .  We even had a bonfire at the beach and made s'mores ! Great place to stay perfect location .   Thanks for a great time ! "
4022127,48109764,2015-09-23,35880492,Kealoha,"This was my first time using Airbnb so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. The booking process and the pictures of the property were very helpful. I enjoyed the place in Alki Beach. It was a great location for being close to downtown but still away from the hustle and bustle. 

The place was very clean and comfortable. It was also very quiet - considering that it was so,close to the Main Street. Several restaurants are nearby - and it was very relaxing to grab a cup of coffee in the morning and walk by the water before getting my day started.

Both Francesco and his wife were very personable and asked if we needed anything . I will definitely stay in the location again on my next visit to Seattle! "
4022127,48868889,2015-09-29,35297781,Mona,We had a very enjoyable stay. The location is ideal with Alki beach across the street and many great places to eat right around the corner. The townhouse is very well appointed and quite comfortable. Francesco is a gracious and attentive host.

Just a half block off Alki beach, there is wonderful views from one of the upstair bedrooms of the ferries crossing Peuget Sound. The place was exceptionally clean, as well as comfortable. A wonderful stroll along the beach/beach front boulevard has many great restaurants. I would stay here again."
4022127,55839980,2015-12-06,26815286,Pryor,"The townhouse was just as described - comfortable, convenient, cozy.

4022127,56689620,2015-12-16,35076667,Jenny,"Francesco was  very welcoming and attentive through consistent messaging. He was very accommodating and respected our privacy. The place was clean and provided all furnishings we could have needed, like towels, sheets, and kitchen equipment. It was cozy and absolutely lovely staying there even with the rain and wind (but that's Seattle!). It was a very central location to nearly everywhere, like downtown Seattle, Bellevue, SEATAC, etc. "

7205443,38065286,2015-07-12,23777459,Nancy,"Marshall was extremely communicative and accommodating. His home was very spacious, clean, and comfortable, and was a quick Uber trip away from Seattle's best spots! "
7205443,40519807,2015-07-31,11075061,Jens,"Please note this is a real basement appartment with almost no daylight at all. In Denmark this unit will not be allowed as a residence, but I don't know in the US. Fortunately there were garden furniture outside where we could stay. One of the beds were so soft that it was almost impossible to sleep 2 together. We did not feel for using the kitchen at all. There were some ants (and lot of ant cans in all windows to try to prevent this). We were confused of all the positive ratings on airbnb, but found out too late that it is not for this appartment (our mistake). "
7205443,44715478,2015-08-28,21145572,Xingjian,"Marshall's place is really nice. It is very close to downtown. The public transportation nearby is very convenient. You can take the bus to many places you want to go. Though it is a half basement, there's still enough sunshine. Also, you can feel quite cool in the room in a hot summer. We really enjoy our stay here."
7205443,46647203,2015-09-12,42841966,Jacquie,"The apartment was really nice and close to public transportation into downtown. The apartment was very spacious and provided everything we could possibly need, and for a very fair price. Marshall didn't meet us in person but was very responsive and left us with any and all instructions we needed. "
7205443,47185964,2015-09-16,42176064,Tina,"Marshall's basement apartment was very nice, spacious, and adequately clean. It accommodated my group of 6 comfortably. The apartment was a quick 10-15 minute drive to downtown.

I experienced miscommunication with check-in instructions, but Marshall was responsive to our calls/texts/e-mails. Having access to the washing machine and dryer was very convenient, especially because our clothes smelled like food from all of the great restaurants in Seattle! We ran out of laundry detergent, and Marshall provided us with some within a couple of hours.

In addition, my group realized we forgot a blanket after we left Seattle, and Marshall quickly and kindly responded to our messages, and he sent the blanket back to us. Overall, Marshall was communicative and very accommodating!"
7205443,48465879,2015-09-26,1840435,Brianne,"Marshall's place was great! Although my stay was short, this Airbnb was exactly what I needed-- well equipped, cozy, and centrally located. Marshall was very helpful and quickly responded to any questions I had. Thanks!"
7205443,49828756,2015-10-06,3645084,Kristina,"Marshall is a great host. Though we did not meet in person he responded to all my emails quick and was so friendly! The basement suite is nice but the ceilings are quiet low so our tall friend struggled some but managed! Good location, close to amenities and a cheap uber ride. Thank you!"
7205443,54184014,2015-11-16,41753279,Hilary,Amazing location and decor. Head space was limited but not a huge issue even for three people over 6 feet. Awesome experience all round!
7205443,55437602,2015-12-01,47275686,Andrea,"accoglienza tranquilla anche se non ci siamo capiti sull'ora del check-in.
ma problema risolto in 10 min direttamente da Marshall.
La casa è un seminterrato carinissimo e molto pulito situata in un quartiere molto tranquillo a 5-10 min di bus da Pike Place.
per i fumatori c'è un tranquillo giardino dove poter fumare le prelibatezze di Uncle Ike's situato a pochi passi,"
7205443,55855742,2015-12-06,2091430,Marilia,"We never met the host Marshall but it was a smooth check-in process regardless. It's the best basement/ lower level apartment we've stayed in  (lots of Windows for natural light, good distance between the 2 bedrooms to create privacy). It's in a convenient area too, only a $5 to $10 uber to get to most areas around the city. Thanks for having us Marshall :) "
5052459,27707017,2015-03-09,11246213,Amy,"If you want a place with a great view in the middle of everything for a fair price, this is a great place for you. Spacious, lots of light and an amazing view of the Space Needle.
We actually walked everywhere from Pikes to Capitol Hill from her apartment. We really thought the location was ideal for anyone who wants the true Seattle experience. 
     Tracy even with being out of the country was very prompt with all communication. I also really appreciated the cleanliness of the entire place, not to mention a very comfy bed. Highly recommend! "

5052459,28800727,2015-03-30,28072316,BaronessCellars,"The condo is beautiful, with 2 bathrooms, great kitchen and newly updated, large open space for living room and kitchen! The view is great and the bed comfortable. We walked most place, took Uber when needed and never used our car. If we had stayed longer then a weekend we could have used public  transportation  because it was right there!"
5052459,29706612,2015-04-11,22429456,David,Tracy's home has an amazing view and great location.  Host was welcoming and helpful to us while we stayed.  Everything was clean and neat.  100% recommend.
5052459,29846207,2015-04-13,381272,Dennise,"I've been traveling with airbnb for 4 years. The stay with Tracy was one of the easiest for check-in/checkout and best in terms of communication.  

Tracy went above and beyond to ensure we had a good stay at her place, communication was impeccable. When we had a minor furniture drama at 11pm on Fri night, Tracy was responsive right away and offered solutions. 

Now the place -
what you see is what you get. Sunline, airly, plenty of room for  2 people.  This is a loft-ish apt located in Lower Queen Anne. It's very easy to get to Downtown or Fremont through Aurora avenue (route 99). I've done this route 5+ times over the wknd, only takes 10min.  It takes about the same time to Capitol Hills as well.
"
5052459,30305198,2015-04-20,29063188,Paul,"Lovely place, walkable to so many things, and in a great neighborhood in Seattle. Comfortable, fully furnished, host goes out of her way to be helpful and communicative. Major bus lines nearby, and a great food market (Metropolitan) very nearby if you want to stock up and eat in. We loved our stay there and hope we can stay again in the future. "
5052459,30824067,2015-04-27,1381896,Skye,"worked out great, we found the place no problem, bigger than we expected in a cute neighborhood - flexible checkout was great.  Thanks Tracy!"
5052459,33287045,2015-05-26,20492888,Janice,"Tracy was beyond amazing! Needing a late check in, she was very accommodating. The place itself is exactly as the pictures show, spacious with great natural lighting during the day thanks to the large windows. The bed is comfortable, and overall just a great place to come back to after a day of exploring the city. Walking distance to all the great sites, with downtown just a quick uber or bus ride away. The view of the space needle from the apartment is beyond beautiful, especially at night. Will definitely look into booking again with Tracy."
5052459,33787336,2015-06-01,29523125,Kira,"Omg.. I couldn't have asked for a better more suitable place for me and my family. I have a husband, newborn baby, And a 3 year old boy and it was plenty of room. Tracy's home is lovely and clean. You can see the space needle from the windows. Really great condo. And tracy was a really great Hostess. Excellent communication and was accommodating and generous. Thank you again Tracy!"
5052459,35294038,2015-06-17,2523348,Harry,"Communication from Tracy was excellent - clear and quick responses. When we arrived, there were welcome notes and good explanations. The location was very convenient, close to town and food possibilities. There was a good bus service just a couple of minutes away. The home was bright,  had character and good views. Highly recommended."
5052459,35637549,2015-06-21,22760267,Cynthia,"Tracy was an awesome host !!  She was welcoming and full of information. If I had a question she answered it. If she didn't know the answer she would find out, sometimes just because she wanted to know. She is extremely customer service oriented.  After I rented the apartment in March for our June travel date, Tracy made sure to contact me at least once a month. I really liked that. Last time I rented I never heard from the host, until the day before my trip. I almost cancelled that trip because I was uncertain if I would have a place to stay.  I never had any concerns about my rental with Tracy, and if I did she replied very quickly. 
 Tracy gave us excellent restaurant suggestions, which came in handy at the end of the day when we were too tired to think of somewhere to go eat.
The apartment looks just like the pictures.  I loved the kitchen. The apartment was nice and clean. Simple but yet stylish and chic. We loved it. Tracy had nice towels and toiletries for us to use, just like a hotel.  Renting this apartment saved us over $1500 compared to  staying in a hotel.
 My husband and I (previously overweight) walked everywhere. We are avid believers in the 10,000 steps a day. It works !! Therefore we did not use the buses or the monorail which were very close by. We walked to the waterfront everyday which took us about 18 minutes.  The Space Needle and a grocery store are about a 8 minute walk. The downtown area is extremely hilly which is why it took us so long to walk. It is actually only about a mile.  My buns are still hurting from the steep hills, but they look great !!  
Rent this apartment you won't be disappointed !!"
5052459,36002194,2015-06-24,28754262,Laura,Tracy's home was wonderful! It was cozy and clean! It was a great location - we did a lot of walking because we didn't have a car.  If you don't mind 20 minute walks with some hills it  was nice.  Tracy made us feel welcome with a note and a bottle of wine for our honeymoon trip.  My husband and I very much enjoyed Tracy's home. 
5052459,36182446,2015-06-26,22643525,Cathy,"This was a perfect solution for our two nights in Seattle.  Tracey communicated really well and was quick to reply to queries. The accommodation was superb and everything really well organised to make our stay run smoothly. Tracey has thought of everything and we were so pleased to have discovered this wonderful gem in Seattle.
"
5052459,36368742,2015-06-28,27441396,Donna,"Tracy's place is very nice. She actually lives here, so you can tell the pride she has in her townhouse and how considerate she is giving full access to her amenities. 
As listed, fab view of Space Needle and withing 20-30 mins walking distance from most featured Seattle attractions. 
I have to say, for our initial airbnb stay, I was impressed with Tracy and her response time to queries (even when traveling overseas--customer service extraordinaire) . I'm confident Tracy will prove out to be one of this area's top hosts in short order!"
5052459,36764339,2015-07-01,22329713,Chuck,"Tracy was a great communicator. Apartment was spacious and clean.
Good neighborhood.

Host kept in contact with us and sent reminder & welcome email with instructions on how to get the condo key from local cupcake shop, which was easy. Reaching host via texting gets quick responses every time.  Condo was a short walk to MacLean Park at Newton & Taylor Ave N - hidden neighborhood park provides a great view of Lake Union fireworks on 4th of July. Do read the helpful ""House Rules"" packet provided by host. Condo has fans which when it is unseasonably hot in Seattle. There is plenty of FREE parking on Taylor Street within a block of the condo - very nice since many areas of Seattle have zoned or paid parking now. "
5052459,38381234,2015-07-15,31749172,Christina,"Our flight to Seattle was waaay late and Tracy was very accommodating in working with us to make sure we could get access to her place (at 2 am). The location is perfect for visiting Seattle and we recommend it. Great view of Space Needle, street parking and not much noise considering how close it is to downtown. Thanks Tracy! "
5052459,40280383,2015-07-29,21494935,Amanda,"Tracy's place was great! Beautiful, clean and spacious. Bus stop a couple blocks away but an uber to downtown is cheap. Nice view of the space needle. Tracy was a great communicator. We really enjoyed our stay here!"
5052459,40522709,2015-07-31,36426509,Gilles,"cet appartement est parfait, il est aussi bien decoré que pratique et tout ca dans un quartier des plus agreables. A la fois preoche de tout et calme, le voisinage est adorable et surtout trés safe.
Tracy est juste adorable, elle vous aide au possible et vous conseille.
J'allais voir des baleines en Alaska et au nord de Seattle, elle a tout fait pour que tout se passe au mieux pour moi. Un grand merci...."
5052459,41678450,2015-08-08,20866772,Kaylee,"Tracy's place was AMAZING and she was a wonderful host. It was a beautiful little place on the third story of an apartment building in Queen Anne - a very safe, family friendly neighborhood. Easy walk to downtown (though probably a taxi away from Pike's Place, etc). 

Tracy was an expert communicator and would consistently respond within minutes of any correspondence. Fantastic experience! "
5052459,42632697,2015-08-14,11580748,Jana,"We have had a very pleasant stay at Tracys place. She has everything very organized starting from picking and dropping the keys and the ""manual"" you find at her place with everything explained there. The bed was very comfortable along w all her place.
We deeply recommend her place"
5052459,43071196,2015-08-17,37086701,Nick,"Tracy's place was exactly as described. Great location, clean and well kept space and close to local sites. Tracy communicated with me from the very beginning and made my stay comparable and easy. Next time I am in Seattle I will definitely being staying at Tracy's place. "
5052459,44361346,2015-08-25,41334126,Jake,Great location. Listing description was an accurate reflection of the place. Tracy was quick to respond and easy to get a hold of.
5052459,45293456,2015-09-01,24120266,Sandy,"Tracy greeted us personally and helped us find a place to park and was very friendly. We felt like we knew her all along and were glad to meet her as she was running out the door. The apt. was clean, nicely furnished, very comfortable to stay here. We would definitely go back again and recommend to other people. "
5052459,45529484,2015-09-03,33251201,Tom,"Tracy did a great job of giving us detailed instructions on how to get the keys and directions to her condo. Lovely condo in a cool location, right near the space needle. Enjoyed making meals in her well equipped kitchen.  Had a great time! Thanks Tracy "
5052459,46224527,2015-09-08,10261976,Raspberry,"What a great Airbnb experience! Tracy's home is beautiful and spacious and very clean. It is in the vibrant Queen Anne neighborhood  and we found it super easy to walk around for great food/bars and activities downtown (Make sure to check out the EMP museum when you're in Seattle). Tracy was a very courteous host and responded promptly to all our inquiries about what to do in Seattle, questions about the apartment etc. You should definitely stay at Tracy's if you are visiting Seattle! "
5052459,47588138,2015-09-20,4731957,Caitlin,Tracy was great. Everything was exactly as described. Such a beautiful view of Seattle from upstairs as well. 
5052459,51759779,2015-10-24,27751535,Xinyue,"Tracy's apartment is very comfortable and convenient, located in Queen Anne area. Next time I come to Seattle, will choose to stay here, a very good experience!"
5052459,52333026,2015-10-28,44852347,Mindee,"Great place, neighborhood, and host.  Tracy was always quick to respond when I had a question, and she provided very detailed and useful information.  "
5052459,56643766,2015-12-15,23278618,Sabine,"The apartment is nice and in a good location. The views from the living room are great. The key pick up at a different location is not ideal, but we had a car, so it wasn't  too bad.  Tracy actually lives there, so there is really no closet space, but for a few days its o.k. to live out of a suitcase. Overall very good experience."
8779676,50986690,2015-10-16,23833728,David,"I had a fantastic time staying with Ericka! She was a warm and welcoming person who made sure I had all I need in my room, and was quick to lend me some maps when I needed to get around. The room was clean and exactly as pictured, with a decent amount of space and a comfy bed. Couldn't ask for a better host!"
8779676,51996754,2015-10-25,11876739,Edouard,Didn't get the chance to meet Erika but place was ok. 
8779676,52381373,2015-10-28,24132399,Andrew,everything was lovely. Very simple and exactly what I needed. Erika and her family are very hands off. Would stay here again. 
8779676,53512678,2015-11-09,46466073,Shaley,Great little place. It was super close to our event. Host was very kind and seemed to be a generous person. 
8779676,54765091,2015-11-23,5371177,Rhianon,"Amazing location, easy walk to all the bars and restaurants of pike  street! Erika is a lovely host.

A few things to know: 

The room, as pictured, is fairly small, and the bed is a mattress on the floor (very comfortable though). 

There is a very sweet and old chocolate lab who also lives in the house. 

We were awoken each morning around 7am by Erika's son running and at times screaming. His domain seems to be right above the guest room. "
8779676,55725954,2015-12-05,32198321,Jason,"This place was exactly what I needed... a bed to crash on in a good neighborhood with parking, clean room, comfortable queen bed (on the floor) at a fair price.
Erika is quick to respond to messages and she was most helpful.  Their dog greeted me politely at the door with tennis ball in mouth but never barked or bothered me in any way and wasn't allowed in my room."
704764,3107906,2012-12-17,1110102,Dylan,"This is a true gem if you're looking for your own adorable 1 bedroom flat in the Queen Anne district. 

It is a first floor apt, but since the entire home is on a hill you get astounding views of the sound. The bathroom is incredible, and the bedroom very cozy. 

Catherine was a great hostess. She left fresh baked muffins and directions to local cafes and bakeries.

I will definitely stay here again when I visit Seattle and highly recommend it to everyone !"
704764,3347705,2013-01-14,4601257,Roxanne,"I can only describe my stay here as wonderful. First, you could not ask for a more gracious and accommodating host and hostess. They went above and beyond the call of duty in making sure that I had everything I needed and more, that my stay was comfortable, and even provided me with delicious home baked muffins!

Second, the apartment itself is on the lower level, but because the house is on a hill, you get a spectacular view of the water and the Olympic mountains. It is light and airy, modern kitchen and bathroom, and lovely and comfy furnishings. There is plenty of space for one or two people, and it is so relaxing and inviting that you may be tempted to bring dinner back and stay in and watch a movie!

I was here in winter, so it was pretty cold and icy out. But there is a lovely garden out back. Come summer, it will be lush and green and flowering, and a delightful spot to sit and relax.

An extra boon to cat lovers--there are kitties here. They won't come into the apartment unless you let them in, but if your a cat lover, this is heaven.

All in all, I highly recommend this apartment and I hope to be staying here again in the near future. "
704764,3519659,2013-02-11,4870165,Brook,"From the moment I decided to inquire about Catherine's place until the moment we left it, the experience was wonderful.  I have stayed in bnb's across North America and Europe and this was by the far my most enjoyable experience.  As a host Catherine goes beyond what would be expected and respects your space by making her place feel like it is yours - but with the luxury of not having to do all the work.  She is detailed oriented from checking on whether or not you have allergies to leaving umbrellas for you to borrow outside your door b/c it is raining, to a binder full of local recommendations.Her place is very comfortable, so much so that you feel like you are home.  The washroom is huge and the pictures don't do it justice.  The view - amazing!  It was the perfect trip, I was relaxed and left only excited to know that I have the perfect spot to stay again should I return to the area.  This place is perfect for a couple, small family, or two couples.  I would  recommend this to anyone.  My only disappointment is that I had stayed at the Sheraton earlier on in the week for work - this was soooo much better.  Thank you again Catherine for making us feel so welcome - by the way your baked goods are delicious.  Best regards, Brook"
704764,3690947,2013-03-04,5117836,Karen,"What’s not to like about this choice location and an even ""choice-er” property owner, Catherine? From our first contact to the day we hugged goodbye, our experience was favoloso in ogni maniera, fabulous in every way. Catherine was friendly and flexible about our arrival and departure times, tuned into our quest for magnificent urban cycling opportunities in the area, and creative in stocking the refrigerator and pantry with healthy goodies (and Nanaimo bars, no less!) that made us smile on arrival. Bravo, Catherine, for creating and sharing your lovely space. Try this Queen Anne gem to gain a sweet view of Puget Sound and avoid the hustle bustle of the city."
704764,3753200,2013-03-11,3530941,Cassandra,Catherine's home and garden are an oasis. I happened to be blessed with the clear skies to see the beautiful view from the front porch. Catherine is also generous in sharing information about what to do in Seattle. Being in her home has made Seattle a city I'll return to again and again. 
704764,3819760,2013-03-18,5110414,Joshua,"Catherine is a wonderful host and I cannot say enough good things about our time with her. The apartment and views are just as stunning as you imagine; the perfect place from which to explore the city but then relax in the evening. Having two bedrooms was a definite plus with a young child, as we could put her to bed and continue to enjoy the rest of the apartment. 

Catherine and her partner were very attentive and helpful. We were greeted with fresh backed goods, jams, and fruit, and Catherine dropped by some bagels during our stay. When our two-year old locked us out of the bed and bathrooms by pushing the buttons and closing the doors, they quickly reopened them and even exchanged the knobs to prevent it happening again. What a save!

I highly recommend Catherine and her apartment to travelers and hope to stay there again on our next trip west. "
704764,4043469,2013-04-05,68768,Sheba Remy,"This sweet Queen Anne apartment is exactly as described and Catherine is an example of the highest calibre of AirBNB host - a reminder of why this can be such a great community. While she was not there to meet us upon our late arrival into Seattle, Catherine did have a friend communicate with us beforehand to arrange keys. Catherine herself checked in with me several times prior to my arrival regarding needs and suggestions and ensured that these were waiting for us at the apartment. She was super flexible in accommodating extra nights' stay and about letting us check out late. The photos and description don't quite do justice to how sweet the apartment is. The view - even on a typically cloudy day - is expansive. On an unseasonably clear day, we even had a view of the cascade mountains. And while the footprint of the space is small, we felt it was more than adequate for three adults - especially for an urban apartment. Just be careful about the heating vents…Catherine may want to make a note of this in her very helpful and comprehensive welcome binder which includes a ton of restaurant and activity recommendations. The bathroom is DIVINE! The kitchen is well equipped and Catherine had even seen to it that there was fresh milk, juice, fruit and a few other goodies awaiting us which I thought was very thoughtful.. Upon her return from her trip, she brought down a tray of her delightful sunrise muffins which lasted, oh, about an hour. The neighborhood has spectacular hilltop views, giving the feeling of being in an oasis and yet just a hop, skip and a jump away from downtown. We spent a good day just exploring the environs because it was so welcoming and peaceful. The Macrina bakery which is a three block walk from the apartment is divine! We ate there twice. And the little neighboring boutique stores were great also, amongst these Rhinestone Rosie's.  Catherine is a kind person who seems genuinely interested in her guests and I wouldn't hesitate to stay with her again. "
704764,4196775,2013-04-17,1407228,A. Heather,"This is an exceptional place to stay.  For starters, the photos do not do justice to this lovely apartment.  It has a GREAT (not ""partial"") view of the sound and ferries and windy bridge, and the path up to the apartment is truly gorgeous with boulders and succulents and flowers.  (I made lots of excuses to fetch something from the car just so I could stroll up and down it.  And don't worry, Catherine will guide you to an easy parking spot to unload luggage so you don't have to lug it up the path.)  The reviews are all spot on: Catherine was a superb hostess, making sure we had restaurant and activity recommendations, as well as tasty goodies from start to finish.  She went above and beyond the call of duty by luring her very sweet (but understandably suspicious) kitties down to visit my three-year-old niece, who was overjoyed to meet them.  The neighborhood is wonderful with scenic overlooks, parks, and cafes around the corner and easy access to downtown and highways by car.  We enjoyed just driving around Queen Anne to see the homes and views.  The soaking tub is huge and beds comfy.  We really could not have enjoyed it more.   Will definitely be coming back!"
704764,4225129,2013-04-20,4364143,Ryan,"Catherine and her husband were very accommodating and wonderful hosts.  Throughout our stay we were presented with homemade muffins, fresh fruit, and all sorts yummy treats, including a very gracious offer to do some grocery store shopping for us. The apartment was clean and exactly how the pictures show with a great view of Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains (at least on a clear day). It was raining most of the time during our visit but the outdoor garden and sitting area looked inviting. I can only imagine how pleasant it would be during the summer. 

One thing that should be mentioned was that the back bedroom had a minor damp smell. Catherine and her husband were aware of the issue and were planning to address it. While it was noticeable, it didn't bother me and I wouldn't consider this a deal breaker. I would stay here again. Overall the apartment and hospitality were great. Thanks Catherine."
704764,4370704,2013-04-30,2256481,Andrew,"Beautiful, quiet, charming apartment with a great view. You can see the sun setting over the water from the huge windows. And Catherine brings tasty treats by every now and then. Very enjoyable stay."
704764,4845582,2013-05-28,6239823,Liz,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Catherine's place for a long weekend and had a lovely time. Great neighborhood, close to some delicious eateries, beautiful parks, and great views. Catherine was a great host - she stocked the apartment with tasty treats from a nearby bakery and put fresh roses out for us. She allso lent us bikes! That we ended up not using because of the hills and the rain. The space was beautiful -- awesome bathroom and a great sitting porch. We hope to visit again."
704764,4901177,2013-06-01,5389598,Margaret,"Oh, the view from hillsides around the Puget sound! We traveled very late from Bend, OR to our nest-way-from-nest at Catherine’s Seattle home. We were beyond exhausted and bleary-eyed – we had been driving and walking all day. Catherine cared quite a bit about our comfort, and was patiently waiting nearby to flag us down when we approached her home. She was a sight for sore eyes to weary travelers. She welcomed us with open arms as we walked through a wonderful inner sanctum garden. The garden is a lush, peaceful (almost Zen-like) place. Lots of soft green grass that beckons a good book reading on a beach towel, water sounds from a fountain, and countless fruits, veggies, and flowers in full bloom like the garden of Eden must have been. We took our bags (and my guitar) into the awesome basement apartment of the comfy cozy home. The home view from within the garden is organic. It is as though the house was growing out of a beautiful sweet oasis in the clamor of a big(ish) city. Much like the way Frank Lloyd Wright planned some of his homesites, the house, its garden, and the beautifully-maintained rock garden-and-walkway backside of the house are all as if they were always there, always in bloom, always green and lush. The basement studio/apartment accommodations are spacious and easy. There’s a home-y, almost Bag-End feel to the place, with a big open seating area, comfy and very (very) quiet bedrooms, a bathroom to die for (more later), and a fun kitchen that seems to have been transported from the days when my greatest desire in life was to have fun. We plopped down our things, bid goodnight, and proceeded to fold like a house of cards – weary from a scenic trek. As a lifelong spine pain sufferer, the shower was manna from heaven. It’s big enough and comfortable enough for two, or for one tall person like me who makes homage to a hot shower a few times a day for pain relief. The bathroom is a dream. It’s warm with separate heat control (cooled nicely with a window to the outside), this bathroom has lots of appeal: no hurry to get through the shower or to leave it. We converged on the bathroom a couple of times a day to refresh and kibbutz. I think we need to re-do our bathroom. Over the next few days, we wandered Seattle, (and Dusty Strings!!!!!! ). Always, we enjoyed slowly meandering through the garden upon our arrival “home.” As cat people, we were energized by the friendly cats who were very gracious about welcoming us to their garden. Nice. I composed no less than 7 new tunes while sitting on the view’s Adirondack chairs sipping wine. A more pleasant place to compose I haven't seen. We were greeted with some nice wine, pastries, fresh flowers and fruits, and a genuinely wonderful couple of people. They’re the best neighbors we haven’t ever had!"
704764,5034720,2013-06-09,5708054,Kevin,What a great place!!! Catherine was a superb host. The place had everything I needed to make my stay comfortable. The bathroom is one of the biggest I have seen in awhile. She provided a wonderful listing of places and things to do around Seattle. the best part about her location beside the view as you walk outside was the public bus was one block away so you had quick and easy access to anywhere in Seattle. I would stay there again and again. 
704764,5158622,2013-06-16,2849656,Teresa,"Catherine's place was so nice! It was charming, clean, comfortable, and the view is fantastic. Catherine really thinks of everything, and goes out of her way to make sure you have a good experience. I liked the location, quick access to other parts of the city. I hope to stay there again next time I am in Seattle."
704764,5279896,2013-06-22,4778727,Lyudmila,"Catherine is very welcoming host. She  responded to my messages very quickly, asked me in advance where I’d like to go & what to see in Seattle and prepared 2 folders with recommendations about restaurants, farmer’s markets and different flyers and maps with sights and bus routes. She met me upon arrival, helped me with a really heavy baggage and seeing all my stuffs even suggested me her suitcase upon departure.
Catherine’s house is located on the North of Queen Anne District. This is very beautiful  residential area with plenty of restaurants, cafes, nice little shops and wonderful houses buried in verdue and flowers. I highly recommend to live here during your vacation in Seattle if you’re going to spend more than 2-3 days there. Catherine’s house is located within easy walking distance of a few bus lines to Downtown of Seattle, Fremont and Ballard. Catherine recommended me farmer’s markets in Ballard and Queen Anne. Go there for buying fresh fruits, vegetables, garden flowers, grabbing a lunch in a pleasant atmosphere. Ask Catherine about all that interesting places and routes, she’s really ready to help you.
Catherine’s house is surrounded by flowers. Apartment is located a little bit in shade. It’s clean, with great view from the porch and huge windows of living room. It has fully equipped kitchen (necessary tableware, refrigerator, plate, microwave, coffee press) and big bathroom (with towels and toiletries). Catherine provided me with food for a breakfast (muffins, bread and jam, milk, yoghurts, juice, coffee, tea etc.), fresh fruits, snacks and kindly suggested me to help with delivering my purchases from supermarket.
I liked my staying in Catherine’s apartment and hope to return here again.
"
704764,5394030,2013-06-28,3351402,Mandy,"Catherine was great - she was quick to take care of any requests we had. The neighborhood is quiet and lovely, I am glad I got to put those great Adirondack chairs to some use! The house was a bit chilly, but the beds were prepped with some good warm blankets/quilts/comforters (we could have requested to have the heat turned on - we just didn't). The bathroom was amazing (the bathroom was bigger than the blue banana!). I would absolutely stay here again - Catherine was a fabulous host! "
704764,5472601,2013-07-01,6988958,Linda,"We enjoyed our stay at Catherine's very much.  The accommodations were clean and comfortable and she
went the extra mile to make sure our stay was memorable."
704764,5694773,2013-07-12,6688558,Marie,Our stay was just perfect. The host was so nice with yummy muffins and some great recommendations. Felt like we were at home the whole time. 
704764,5764356,2013-07-15,4507669,George,"Our stay was great. Catherine's place is very spacious and clean. It was located very close to downtown. The view from the window is amazing. We arrived late so we didn't know until the morning, but it truly is a postcard view. We also needed something delivered there and her and her husband Marc were very helpful with the process. 

We will stay there again when we visit Seattle in the future.

George"
704764,5908796,2013-07-22,1776786,Jamie,"We loved staying with Catherine!  Her home is beautiful and she was an amazing host.  I can't recommend staying here highly enough.  The house is conveniently located within walking distance of all the great restaurants, bars and cafes of Queen Anne.  Free street parking is also plentiful so if you have a car you can get out to explore the other parts of the city, but you may not want to.  We could have sat in the 2 chairs on the front patio all day.  The view is unbelievable!

Catherine has tons of really wonderful recommendations for places to visit.   The 4 mile walking/running loop that she recommended is the BEST way to get to see the beautiful homes and gardens of Queen Anne, plus it takes you along some amazing view points of Seattle.

I was in Seattle for a conference and spent several days cooped up in the Washington Convention Center, which was lovely as far as convention centers go, but staying with Catherine in Queen Anne was a perfect way to get out and explore the rest of the city.  Staying here was a highlight of the trip!  It was like our own very personal, 5-star bed and breakfast.  Thanks Catherine!
"
704764,6119136,2013-07-30,3096909,Talia And Brandon,"We really loved this apartment - the location, hosts and feline friends were all great. The apartment is a perfect home base for exploring Seattle. Catherine and her husband we fantastic hosts and the apartment is stocked with binders full of information and the windowsill in the kitchen has many brochures to look at for ideas. Catherine stocked the kitchen with fresh fruit, snacks and drinks as well as amazing lemon-raspberry cheesecakes. The bathroom is huge and the bed was very comfortable. The cats outside were a blast - they were available if you wanted to love on them but didn't bother you at all if you wanted to be left alone. My husband and I enjoyed a bottle of wine on our private patio with Alex (the cat) and watched a beautiful sunset and view. One thing to note - there is definitely street parking available but it was harder to find a spot at night coming back from dinner. We highly recommend this apartment and will definitely stay again if we ever find ourself in Seattle."
704764,6414389,2013-08-12,4283940,Janet,"Our stay couldn't have been more pleasing. We were in Seattle for our daughter's wedding and there were many details that needed tending. Catherine, our hostess, was very helpful finding flower growers for the wedding dinner table arrangements. The apartment was very comfortable and nestled in a lovely garden setting with garden cats. We never tired of the handsome view of Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains. We found the kitchen comfortable to work in and Catherine provided us with useful equipment when our family joined us for a large dinner gathering. There also were fresh treats and flower arrangements provided throughout our stay. We highly recommend our hostess and the apartment. "
704764,6587752,2013-08-18,6815909,Elaine,"Catherine is terrific and her apartment is gorgeous.  The location is not very close to downtown.  So we drove and found parking garages.  Catherine left food for us and the apartment was very comfortable.  The views are exquisite and the cats are friendly.  She has vegetables, berries and herbs growing right outside the doors.  This is a must-stay-again place."
704764,6845033,2013-08-27,6542337,Scott,"Many reviewers have already said it better than I can.  Our stay with Catherine was great from start to finish.  As soon as my friend and I booked, she opened the communication channels wide, urging us to ask questions and offering us several tips on how to enjoy our stay more on and around Queen Anne Hill.  We when arrived, she continued to make sure we had everything we needed.  We found the apartment immaculate, the kitchen well supplied, the bathroom humongous (extra large walk in shower and extra large tub), the living room inviting, and the bedrooms wonderfully comfortable.  We loved her charming landscaping and, of course, the panoramic of view of Elliot Bay and the Olympic Range.  It was our Seattle home away from home, and we didn't want to leave!"
704764,7158302,2013-09-09,7117147,Helmut,"Catherines apartment is very comfortable and clean and beautifully located with an amazing view of Puget Sound! We liked the Queen Anne neighborhood so much - lots of nice houses, great views and so easy to get into town (it's fun to ride on Bus 1 and have a short stop at this nice cafe on Queen Anne Avenue, directly at the busstop)! Communication with Catherine was very easy throughout the whole process, she is always helpful - she even drove us to the airport!"
704764,7279692,2013-09-14,3916421,Prissy,"Such a fun place to stay made our whole Seattle visit that much better.  Beautiful furnishings, many antiques, many Asian lent a peaceful air.  The front garden was equally enchanting & the hosts could not have been more helpful.  Several things didn't work, but they solved the problems promptly.  The view was super, the breeze refreshing, & the location great for touring the city.  Parking was easy.  Lots of helpful literature & yummy food treats.  The beds were comfortable, the bathroom large & beautiful, and the cats were an extra plus.  Catherine researched the city for me from my list of food & activity interests and sent me her findings before we came.which really helped.  A lovely, lovely stay!"
704764,7386550,2013-09-17,8386044,Kathie,"Catherine's house is amazing! It's beautiful with great views and has a very comfortable bed!  She left us with a healthy continental breakfast including homemade treats. Catherine and her husband, Mark, were a pleasure to deal with and we would definitely stay here again! "
704764,7760024,2013-10-01,1197063,Zachary,"Catherine is amazing! She was incredibly thoughtful and responsive throughout our stay with her. Upon our (late) arrival, we found she had left a lovely note with snacks and concert tickets. She had binders full of recommendations for restaurants and activities, which we took full advantage of. The apartment is beautiful, clean, and has amazing views. (The bathroom is just spectacular.) Parking was easy."
704764,8082735,2013-10-15,5502103,Natasha,"What a wonderful Airbnb experience this was! Catherine is an extraordinary host, from her gracious welcome all the way through, anticipating our every need, and providing such goodies! She and Marc have created a beautiful nest on the west side of Queen Anne, in a perfect neighborhood for exploring either locally, or for hopping on  buses to get anywhere. It was a bit of a splurge for us to stay here, but it was my birthday and it was so worth it. It's just as lovely as the pictures show. I recommend to anyone considering this special place (and you are fine with having cats come visit) -- do it!"
704764,8431655,2013-10-30,8883288,Megan,"I really enjoyed staying at Catherine's place!  It had a beautiful view from the patio of the Puget Sound and surrounding neighborhood.  I enjoyed a nice glass of wine while watching the sunset on her Adirondack chairs.  
The inside of the house was adorable and very comfortable.  I felt right at home during my stay.  Catherine provided breakfast and coffee and great ideas for what to do while in Seattle.
I highly recommend this place and hopefully will return soon!"
704764,8540060,2013-11-04,9517287,Susie,"Very nice apartment with a gorgeous view of Seattle.  It was comfortable, clean, and made for a great weekend stay in the Queen Anne community for my daughter and I.  Our hostess Catherine was very hospitable ... letting us know what kind of events were going to be happening during our stay as well as welcoming us with breakfast and additional treats.  The peaceful comfort and view is well worth the stay.   "
704764,8769489,2013-11-17,9559309,John,"We had a really nice stay.  Catherine was very responsive for all of my questions, and the place was very clean, nice, and ready for us when we arrived.  It was exactly as advertised on the listing. No complaints.  I would recommend staying there, and I would stay there again."
704764,8921363,2013-11-25,6959743,Kamla,"Catherine's home is beautiful. I had planned to bring my mom over to see it, and I'm sure she would have moved in on the spot if we had been able to squeeze in a visit. I appreciated the cookies and other goodies Catherine left out for me and the general care she obviously takes to make her guests feel welcome. I would definitely stay here again. "
704764,8982968,2013-11-30,8110072,Ayana,"I had a very nice stay. The house is beautiful and comfortable. The view alone was enough to make me want to stay here again. The host offered maps, places to eat, transportation options--everything one needs to know while vacationing in her beautiful city. I would definitely stay here again!"
704764,9113526,2013-12-08,4419455,Kenton,This is such a lovely place. I used it to hold several days of meetings with a colleague and we were both grateful to be in such a homey and comfortable environment rather than the usual airport hotel. 
704764,9364165,2013-12-24,7355053,Angie,Really nice place -- wish I could have stayed for longer.  Catherine was a great host -- I got some tasty homemade baked treats and had some cat friends come and hang out.  I used to live in Seattle and this is one of my favorite areas -- beautiful views walking around.  
704764,10285468,2014-02-10,1642575,Laura,"My 7 yo son and I had a perfect stay at Catherine's Suite.  It felt like a home rather than a rental....so many extra's like the generous food offerings, and luxurious bathroom.  Queen Anne is a beautiful neighborhood and the suite looked distantly out towards the water from high on the hill, so peaceful.  The suite came with all kinds of information on Seattle, restaurants, maps, etc.  The beds were very comfortable and regulating the temperature in every room was simple...it was so warm and cozy, a pleasure given it snowed heavily on our last night there.   We ended up parking a block away and walking to the back gate off an alleyway which may have had parking, I wasn't sure.  My brother was on hand to drive us around so I don't know about bus transportation.  There is a lovely coffee house a few blocks walk away.  Parking in front means walking up quite a few steps, so if mobility is an issue that would be the only downfall...otherwise this place is gorgeous and Catherine such a lovely host.  "
704764,10426337,2014-02-18,3352618,Derek,"We were very happy with our choice and found the Olympic View warm, clean, comfortable and just perfect. We spend a very wet week end in Seattle and being able to come home to a warm friendly house made the trip worthwhile.  Catherine provided delicious cakes, buns, bagels and many extras which were unexpected but much appreciated. Nothing was too much trouble and Catherine was more than happy to provide useful information. One of our best airbnb experiences"
704764,10837322,2014-03-10,5877471,Julie,"Catherine and her husband really went out of their way to make sure we had everything we could have wanted and more. Really enjoyed our stay. Great Location, Great Views, Great Energy!!! Thank You."
704764,11292322,2014-03-28,5224553,Cherie,"I really enjoyed staying in this apartment.  It was a convenient location on Queen Anne with some great retail and restaurants within 1-2 miles.  The view from the kitchen and living room was beautiful and the climb to the front door was beautifully landscaped.  Catherine paid attention to the details in the kitchen leaving me with coffee beans, snacks, desserts and breakfast items in the refrig.  She also accommodated my request for heavy cream for my morning coffee - I thought this was great!  The bathroom is huge and nicely furnished.  The 2 bedrooms are adequate - I thought the pillows could be upgraded (fortunately I brought my own pillow) and maybe the linens as well.  You can hear the owners upstairs, walking around and sliding chairs, but that wasn't really a huge issue for me.  Overall, I enjoyed my stay."
704764,11410337,2014-04-01,1960417,Hana,"We had a lovely stay at Catherine's apartment. Everything is very clean and cozy and the kitchen is stocked with snacks. I loved the huge soaking tub, the water is hot and the bathroom is extremely clean. Parking is straightforward and the location is centrally located with a great view."
704764,11818590,2014-04-15,7420910,Janet,"Very cute place with amazing views.  My son and I each had our own room and the bathroom was wonderful.  Catherine was such a great host.  She made sure we had everything we needed and even had some bagels and muffins there for us in the morning.  There is a wonderful bakery and grocery store nearby and a few breakfast places walking distance to the apartment which was nice.   Really loved the neighborhood and the apartment.  If you are sensitive to cats this may not be the place for you however.  
"
704764,12020318,2014-04-21,7548008,Gary,"What a pleasant apartment!  The location was very attractive-- great views and a very nice part of Seattle (Queen Anne).  It was easy to get downtown with public transit (and a cab fare from downtown to the apartment was not that expensive either). The apartment itself was nicely appointed.  Good beds in the bedrooms, a very spacious and clean bath.  Wifi was great.  Caroline was very friendly and helpful.  I would most definitely return to this place when visiting Seattle again"
704764,13414710,2014-05-27,3218485,Anna,"We had a wonderful time staying in this gorgeous home. The neighborhood is very clean, safe, and pedestrian friendly.  There are several bus stops to choose from to help you get into other areas of Seattle. We also had a great time visiting the bakeries, shops, and markets within walking distance of the apartment. Catherine was genuinely helpful in providing information fine tuned to our interests. She is a very thoughtful host that provided us with tips and insights to experience Seattle as a resident not just as a tourist. She has a keen eye to detail and has furnished the apartment to make it feel very welcoming. The deck chairs and beautiful gardens compliment the idyllic views.

704764,13637947,2014-06-01,15903472,Lindsey,"Catherine was such a great host, she brought by breakfast items and sweets for us throughout our stay. Her home is lovely and in a great neighborhood. I would recommend her place to others!"
704764,13959311,2014-06-09,14418525,Stan,"Catherine, we just got back from our cruise today.  Our computer did not like the ship's network......sorry for the delay.  Lois and I agree that you were a fantastic host and found everything as you said, plus.  Fruit, coffee, granola, skim milk, bagels, jam........the list goes on and on.  The cottage was  exceptionally clean and the harbor view was terrific.  When our children pick their cruise date your B&B will be their first choice.  You are an exceptional host.
Many thanks, Stan and Lois"
704764,14204666,2014-06-14,15724532,Lori,"Everything we expected, and MORE!  Catherine was a wonderful host...  friendly, accommodating, and considerate.  She went out of her way to gather information and equipment (bikes) for our potential activities.  The apartment was lovely and in an awesome location. And after experiencing several different neighborhoods and sites throughout Seattle, we all agreed that Queen Anne was a perfect place to come ""home"" to at the end of each of our days.  And Catherine's apartment a welcoming refuge.

After seeing a pictorial journal of our Seattle trip, I think this will be a highly sought after listing amongst our friends and family... And with the limited availability, I only hope that they'll leave time for us to book it again in the future!

"
704764,14386964,2014-06-18,12578710,Bill,"We very much enjoyed our stay on Queen Anne. The place is comfortable, well stocked with an eclectic book collection, an extensive variety of CD's, and attractively decorated with attractive art and pictures suggesting a lifetime of travel by the hosts. The view from the living/kitchen areas toward the sound and the Olympics is spectacular. The pastries are unfortunately irresistible. We took the position that calories don't count on vacation. The location is convenient to Queen Anne, with its shops and restaurants. Parking is not entirely simple, but workable. 

With its location, view, and many supplied diversions, the apartment can be an excellent base for either active vacationing or cocooning, depending on your level of energy, mood, or the weather. "
704764,15308235,2014-07-07,13751071,James,"My host was excellent and provided coffee beans, a grinder and French press, as well as numerous ""treats"", fruit, and milk.  She changed the sheets on the third day and left helpful information on restaurants and things to do.   She was accommodating with a schedule change I needed.  The apartment was spacious, clean and comfortable, with a water view from the living area.  The bathroom is HUGE and has a very large tub, perfect for soaking after a hike!  The entrance is up a ramp and some stairs from the street, so it may not be a good place for someone who has challenges walking. "
704764,15527450,2014-07-11,13961292,Martin,"Catherine ist a very charming host. Near midnight after a exhausting trip from Europe she gave us a friendly welcome, brought some delicious food and drinks and made us feel at home.
The place is very clean, has a well equipped kitchen. Beautiful view on Puget Sound and Olympic Mountains. Reach downtown by bus. Parking space in front of the house. Quiet surrounding, nice wooden houses with a lot of gardens.
For three persons this flat is perfect.
Over all rating triple A. Would come again any time.
Martin"
704764,15901983,2014-07-18,9094207,Jeanne,"Catherine's place was the perfect spot for our Seattle stay. This apt is located in a great neighborhood with amazing views and was extremely comfortable for two people. We could easily walk into the downtown or over to Ballard from Queen Anne, and there was also plenty of public transport in the area. Catherine was very helpful and welcoming - she provided lots of great recommendations and the breakfast treats were delicious. The bakery she recommends was fantastic as well. Would love to stay there again on a future visit. "
704764,16341346,2014-07-26,6137146,Lauren,"We loved our stay here! Catherine and her husband were great hosts and kept our place stocked with great coffee, donuts, desserts, fruit, and other treats. A beautiful spot in a beautiful town!"
704764,17108280,2014-08-07,15494740,Karim,"I stayed at Catherine's with two friends. We were all so amazed when we walked in. The views from her front porch are gorgeous. The apartment is large but cozy, and decorated very tastefully. The beds are large and comfortable. Catherine kindly provided us with milk, orange juice, bagels, deserts, fruit, and other tasty goodies. She also stocked the bathroom and kitchen with natural type soaps and products which I appreciated. She gave us two keys which made it convenient when the group wanted to come and go separately. Catherine was very friendly and helpful with suggestions on what to see and do.  We also enjoyed the company of her very cute and  friendly cats. If you're visiting Seattle I highly recommend staying at Catherine's!"
704764,17495345,2014-08-13,12011403,Phil,"From the beginning, Catherine was very responsive to our inquiries about the property, availability, and amenities.  She and her husband, Mark were terrific hosts. The downstairs apartment in their home was comfortable and well stocked with coffee, fresh fruit, eggs, milk/juice, fresh pastries from the local bakery and Catherine's homemade jam.  They provided an abundance of maps, cards, brochures, and literature on Seattle and local activities.  Catherine gave us tips on different tours, neat things to do, restaurants, etc.  We enjoyed the Theo Chocolate tour, the cultural district, the Chihuly Museum and Pike's Place Market.  Although we were in Seattle during an unseasonably hot summer and the highs were well into the 90's, we were comfortable at night with the windows open and fan.  The house has a lovely view of the water from the den, although partially obscured by the houses across the street.  This is an old house, circa 1910 and delightfully creeky with each step.  Having not lived in a 2 story home before, it took me a couple of nights to get comfortable with our hosts living above us and moving about.  The kitchen & bath has been remodeled and very was well appointed, clean and comfortable. The bedding was clean and comfortable as well, although an upgrade to the mattresses & box springs are always welcome.  If you are a lover of the feline variety, you will enjoy the hustle & bustle of cats around the home, at your window and door step.  You will receive the occasional scent of kitty, so if that offends you, this is not your ideal property.  Finding the home can be admittedly tricky at first, even for a local cab driver, but we quickly learned our way around.  The streets of Queen Anne are narrow and parking was minimal.  The city street work and backhoe in front of the house did not help the parking. The houses in the area are very close to one another, as indicative of the era and older cities.  If you are going to rent a car, get a compact.  We traveled on foot, by cab and bus, so it was not an issue for us. "
704764,18873641,2014-09-02,8110276,Molly,"We had a wonderful time staying at Catherine's house. She is an excellent host, from clear communications about our arrival and information about the neighborhood to her warm hospitality and delicious treats (homemade jams!) delivered during our stay. The apartment is attractive, well furnished, and scrupulously clean. I especially enjoyed the luxurious bathtub. "
704764,19164419,2014-09-07,4714196,Xavier,"Great apartment, great house, great hosts! I will definitely come back and book this place in a heartbeat.
"
704764,19322495,2014-09-10,9239991,Patrick,"Excellent stay! Catherine's place is in a great location, 10 minute drive from anything downtown. She is a wonderful host and we greatly enjoyed our stay. Best: Cookies and breakfast treats daily! Worst: Lugging luggage up the stairs to her place, kinda steep but totally doable."
704764,19543648,2014-09-14,20332538,Gudrun,"Catherine is incredibly accommodating, she took the time to respond to our questions about Seattle and was very helpful with planning a great long weekend. The apartment is very comfortable with a bath tub perfect for relaxing in after walking the beautiful  hills of the Queen Anne neighborhood.   There was delicious pastries, teas, coffee, fruit and anything else you need for breakfast. We could not have asked for a better first time stay in Seattle!"
704764,19724785,2014-09-17,15573653,Gillian,"I can only endorse what previous guests have said: Catherine and Mark were warm and welcoming hosts. The apartment was beautiful and comfortable and walking into the living room to be greeted by that view on a sunny morning was a delight. Such a generous welcome pack (sadly couldn't manage all the muffins) and every guide you could imagine, including Catherine's own notes. We didn't have a car, but the No 1 bus just around the corner took us downtown when needed. The neighbourhood was lovely and Ken's supermarket had all the essentials (wine and beer!) and it was a pleasant stroll to some of the restaurants recommended."
704764,19955132,2014-09-21,6573881,Jeremy,"Catherine and her husband were kind, accommodating and fun. We loved the local pastries, the neighborhood and really felt welcomed!"
704764,20102191,2014-09-23,12289349,Scott,"Catherine was a great host and the place was lovely.  The rooms were well furnished and the kitchen has everything thing you need.  Also there is a charming little grocery store and bakery nearby. The place has a great view, and it's easy to get to downtown and places in northern Seattle like Ballard and Fremont.  Catherine was easy to communicate with and the whole stay was a pleasure."
704764,20420299,2014-09-29,247738,Dawn,Lots of goodies stocked in kitchen. Super comfy beds.  A host who checks in with banana bread and cookies. A million dollar view. All made for a lovely stay in Upper Queen Anne. Walkable to all you'll need!  Even used some of the Ryans' garden tomatoes to made sauce. Yum!
704764,20910656,2014-10-07,20774330,Lisa,Everything was wonderful! What a lovely place to stay. Catherine did a wonderful job of being welcoming and helpful.
704764,21111958,2014-10-11,12049440,Sharon,"The accommodations were only exceeded by the exceptional care from Catherine, our host.  Communication was excellent prior to arrival, with Catherine asking if we had any dietary preferences or allergies.  
Upon arrival, the house was adorned with fresh flowers in both bedrooms and in the kitchen.  Also, there were fresh bagels, juice, milk, fruit from their own organic garden, and jellies and jams made by our host in the fridge.
The view was beyond belief as was the soaking tub in the absolutely gorgeous bathroom.
Beds were super comfortable, everything imaginable was in the kitchen, and there were brochures and guidebooks that were very helpful in deciding how we wanted to spend our time in Seattle.
Catherine was even so thoughtful as to write a handwritten welcome note, inviting us to pick fresh fruit from their trees, and listed 3 of their current favorite restaurants, one of which we tried the night of our arrival, called Monsoon, which had the freshest and most flavorful fish ever!!
Catherine, we can't thank you enough for our home away from home, and send you every blessing! "
704764,21382548,2014-10-16,20692634,Pamela,"We felt very much at home and well looked after at this lovely home in the quiet and picturesque Queen Anne neighborhood.  Our private, comfortably decorated apartment had a beautiful view of the bay. Our host provided a lot of information about what to see and do in the Seattle area.  The kitchen was well stocked with breakfast food.  We particularly enjoyed the jams which were homemade with fruit from Catherine's garden.  I recommend this cozy and well maintained place."
704764,21672950,2014-10-21,7987191,Cheryl,"My sister and I stayed at Catherine's charming apartment for 4 nights.  Catherine was super - very easy to communicate with, precise instructions as to how to get there and how to get in, etc.  She welcomed us with incredible baked goods and other breakfast foods.  Also Catherine was so helpful in assisting us with directions, bus service, and things to do in the area.  We loved the apartment and felt it was exactly as described.  Thank you Catherine!!"
704764,23372372,2014-11-30,19595581,Amanda,"My mom and I had a lovely stay at Catherine's place. The apartment is a great size and located in a beautiful neighborhood. The apartment has everything you need. We didn't do much cooking but the kitchen seems very well stocked and there was tea, coffee and things to snack on.  The beds are super comfy and warm and the huge bath tub was great! They were doing some construction in front of the unit and she went out of her way to make sure it didn't affect us."
704764,23896738,2014-12-14,10076027,Sabrina,"This was an amazing place to stay!  Everything was just as described, the location was super convenient to catch the bus to downtown.  Catherine even provided us some sweet and delicious desserts one evening.  Will definitely want to stay here again next time I am in Seattle."
704764,24544326,2014-12-30,24190764,Amy,"Catherine was a wonderful host, she made us feel welcome even before our arrival, with several emails and offers to help.  Then upon our arrival she greeted us in person, gave us a quick welcome, and then left us to enjoy the space on our own.  She had stocked the kitchen with a lot of delicious things to get us started, like fresh goat cheese, coffee, milk, homemade muffins, and fresh fruit.  And fresh flowers in the kitchen and bedrooms!  Wow!  The view was amazing, the rental unit was clean, cozy, and really roomy. The house and the neighborhood were very very quiet.  This is a great spot just 10 minutes from downtown Seattle."
704764,25139755,2015-01-07,11846405,Nancy,"Our airbnb experience with Catherine and her beautiful apartment was absolutely perfect! From the very beginning Catherine communicated well and made our trip planning very easy. 

The apartment is as lovely in person as it is in the photographs. It is spacious, comfortable, and clean.  I also loved the beautiful, large bathroom with great shower! 

We greatly appreciated the delicious snacks and breakfast items that Catherine provided. 

We would love to stay here again! Thank you, Catherine, for a wonderful experience!

It was a treat to have the gorgeous view of the Olympics and the water with ferries going by. Having the refrigerator stocked with goodies, teas and breakfast was generous. We will be back!"
704764,27618366,2015-03-08,11804180,Zuzana,"Catherine's place is wonderful: cozy, well furnished, and the views are stunning.  She makes her guests to feel welcome, provides coffee, tea, milk, juice, yogurts, butter, fruit, muffins, granola bars, and bread so you can have a nice breakfast and take something with you for your roam around Seattle. We had a great stay and would happily recommend this place to our friends,"
704764,28478369,2015-03-24,2269319,Alvaro,"We had an amazing time at Catherine's apartment.  The space was clean, spacious, and the views from the living room are spectacular!  Definitely enjoyed sitting in the front porch with a morning cup of coffee overlooking the great views.  
The space is as described, comfortable beds, a fully stocked kitchen, and what has to be the largest bathroom I have ever seen, LOL!  Large shower and a huge tub (so relaxing especially after a day of hiking).
Catherine and her husband Marc are very kind, lovely people.  She went out of her way to stock the kitchen with plenty of food basics (milk, juice, coffee, pastries, etc), and some of the best homemade jam ever.  Catherine recommended some great restaurants and even offered her bikes to use around town. Unfortunately we didn't take advantage since we were constantly discovering this great city.
Overall, it was a great experience.  Awesome apartment, in and awesome location, with an awesome host!  what more could you ask for?"
704764,28544903,2015-03-25,6369521,Yonat,"Wonderful experience, comfortable place, great bath,amazing view, tasty muffins, cookies, and breakfast. Very friendly host, who accommodate all our issues. Definitely recommending and planning on staying there again next time in Seattle .
I loved the rugs and all the vintage furnitures .    "
704764,28811745,2015-03-30,5392783,Tony,"Catherine is the best host of all time.  She checked in to make sure we got to Seattle safely and could find her home.  The breakfast and desserts she provided was outstanding, fresh baked goods, fruit, yogurt, granola, coffee, and delicious desserts.  We loved the house and the view.  We had a great visit to Seattle and Catherine's house was just what the doctor ordered."
704764,29295995,2015-04-06,1675444,Elaine,"This was a fantastic place too stay. It was a great location near everything and with a few. The spacious well equipted apartment and lovely and homey. It had the best bathroom with a large shower and separate tub.

704764,29940101,2015-04-14,30126490,Pete,"Quiet neighborhood in Queen Anne area near Seattle Center and downtown.  Views of the water from the apartment, which is located on a level below the residence.  Very comfortable, spacious, spotlessly-clean and tastefully furnished.  The host was perfect with regard to communication and meeting needs - especially in the baked goods department!!  We will return."

We enjoyed the feeling of being at home in Seattle, and spent much time on the front patio relaxing in the sun (yes sun!) and enjoying the view. Catherine's lovely home has nice sized rooms, well-stocked breakfast and yummy snack offerings, and the best bathtub of anywhere!  We enjoyed her vintage furnishings with some modern touches, too. The highlight of the trip was enjoying her garden, while spending time with her kitties.   Loved being able to access the space from either the front street or back alley. Catherine was available for any questions, and we hope to return so we can take her up on a game of Scrabble or visit to the Ballard Market.  "
704764,32662793,2015-05-19,21655415,Deborah,"Thank you Catherine.  It doesn't take much to please me but when I am pleased the I hope memories will last.  I made reservations with Catherine the night before I booked.  I am an Airbnb host but have never stayed as a guest.
What a treat. My friend and I met halfway.  We arrived 2 hrs before checking.  Catherine met us and made her Airbnb available immediately.  She met gave us the choose of unpacking via the alley or walking the stairs. Since we were only staying overnight and we were able- we walked the stairs.  Left out bags and off we went exploring.  Queen Anne is a beautiful quiet residential area. We walked up to the avenue past pristine landscaped homes.  We enjoyed a glass of wine and dinner outside in a quaint mexican restaurant.  We took home leftovers.  We picked up a few items at the local Trader Joes.  Then we walked backed to 11th street. Sat outside and talked and talked.  We ate the treats Catherine left.  I warmed up by taken a bath I the soaker tub.  Then we moved the inside rocker out to the covered porch to join the other oak chair.  We played scrabble and watched the ferry cross Elliot Bay.  Next morning we had coffee out on the covered porch.  Then off to the Ballard locks.  Then Kerry Park.  The location is spectacular.  Full kitchen.  Yea!!!! No tv.  Listened to the radio.  Lots of CDs but I couldn't figure out how to turn on..  Lots and lots of brochures.  Perfect. Thanks Catherine."
704764,33247664,2015-05-26,29898848,Salynn,"Catherine contacted me soon after I made my reservation to find out if we had any special dietary needs so that she’d have the right kind of milk upon our arrival! I was charmed and so excited about our trip before we’d even left home.

The house and terraced garden are lovely, looking west toward the water and mountains, although being Seattle, it was too cloudy to see them! No matter, we were happy as clams in our cozy apartment with well-supplied kitchen including, coffee and many teas, milk, and a bounty of baked goods. I could have hunkered down with the cats and skipped being a tourist.

My husband is an avid bike rider, and was delighted when our host Marc offered to lend him the use of a bike for the duration of our visit. This was very generous and mightily appreciated by both of us!

It should be mentioned that because the house is wood-frame and guests reside below the owners’ living quarters, one distinctly hears them walking about above. If you’re a light sleeper, or early to bed it may bother you, otherwise it’s not a big deal.

Catherine and Marc were kind and generous and made us feel like welcome guests in their home, checking on us by text throughout our visit to make sure we had all we needed. We will definitely be return visitors.

704764,33667569,2015-05-31,20412076,Xiao Ai,Catherine was a very warm & caring host and she made us feel we were staying at a friend's house. We were generously greeted with delicious pastries and fruits upon our arrival! The neighborhood was beautiful with many unique architectures. The apartment was clean and we loved the kitchen and the big bathroom. Our favorite part of the stay was sitting at the front patio of the apartment watching the breathtaking view of the sea and the mountains at sunset. We will definitely go back again!
704764,33917711,2015-06-02,30944235,Karen,"Catherine was extremely welcoming and responsive to any questions we had prior to the trip. She is very knowledgeable about Seattle and has a lot of literature in the apartment that is very helpful as well.
The apartment is in a very cute section of Queen Anne and it has a lovely view of Puget Sound. It was clean, the bed was comfy (we slept in the queen) and the bathroom was large, and boats a wonderful soaking tub as well as a lovely shower. The apartment is well ventilated and bright and the kitchen is well stocked and is happy, cute and friendly. 
Catherine would provide whatever you asked for, I think. We did not ask for such treats (and alas ate so few of them) but now that I know I would be specific as she is very attentive. The kids we were visiting had us on the go, but next time I would love to stay in and make food there and enjoy the scenery. 
The apartment was everything we asked for and more. The parking is crunched but not impossible and if you have any kind of handicap you will want to enter from the alley. The front steps are steep. 
There was no television (we realized in retrospect!) which was great. 
My husband and I used one of her many tour books to walk a 3 mile loop in the Queen Anne neighborhood's stairway trail - so so fun! And strenuous and full of lovely homes, gardens and views. The dogwood trees were just spectacular and the most abundant I have every seen both individual flowers and quantity. 
Our favorite thing was walking to Macrine Bakery and Cafe in the morning. So cute and delicious! A good uphill but worth it!!Great people watching and wonderful coffee and egg dishes - a lot of love.
Thank you so much Catherine and Mark for sharing your little slice of Queen Anne Seattle with us! See you soon, I hope!!!"
704764,34652617,2015-06-10,19631404,Rachael,"Our hosts went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable, welcoming, and relaxing. The fresh baked goods, coffee, and milk available every day were such a treat! The entire apartment is exactly what we hoped for and more: the location is serene and convenient; the bedrooms are comfortable and clean; the water pressure is strong (and the enormous tub is such a luxury!); access to tourist information is abundant; the hosts are friendly, accommodating, and always respectful of privacy. We couldn't praise them enough, and highly recommend this air bnb."
704764,35371735,2015-06-18,29800617,Mark,Great experience.  Catherine was very welcoming and helpful.  Apartment was clean and had lovely views.  
704764,36670403,2015-06-30,1442984,Dean H.,"I live in Seattle (Ballard), but my uncle and cousin visited me and my family and stayed at Catherine's beautiful home.  The home is absolutely gorgeous, very private and has beautiful views.  The neighborhood is quiet and there is ample street parking.  Catherine was a great host and left delicious breakfast foods, snacks and desserts.  She went above and beyond.  She made herself accessible via text if anything was needed.  The two bedrooms had a lot of space, the bathroom is huge/beautiful and the kitchen/sitting area is big and comfortable.  I would recommend this to anyone coming to visit from out of town.  The home is a beautiful place to stay and Catherine went out of her way to be hospitable.  Centrally located and perfect for our visitors!"
704764,37305156,2015-07-06,21802305,Sean,"Catherine and Marc are superb hosts. Our train was nearly two hours late and Catherine was easily available for contact and very accommodating to our late arrival. The apartment was immaculate, the beds incredibly comfortable and the decor eclectic and charming.  My personal favorite part of the entire trip to the Emerald City was sitting on the porch each morning with a sublime cup of coffee and taking in the view of Puget Sound---worries and stress seemed as far away as the Olympic Mountains. Thank you again."
704764,37697480,2015-07-09,10918795,Danielle,"My first trip to Seattle and it could not have been more perfect. Catherine's home felt like staying with friends. The apartment is spacious, well located and very comfortable. Catherine's personal touches were truly appreciated-from the local recommendations (shopping/restaurants) to the delicious fruits, baked treats, tea/coffee, homemade jams and chutneys in the fridge. She is a generous and thoughtful host. The views from the apartment are lovely and I did not find parking a problem. I will be back."
704764,39129997,2015-07-20,26168334,Patrick,"My wife and I had a great time in Seattle staying at Catherine's place.  She was very accommodating of our delayed arrival and left us some wonderful options for breakfast in the morning.  There are some great views of the water and the Olympics, both from her place and along the street.  All in all, we were very satisfied and would highly recommend!

"
704764,39557574,2015-07-24,4004459,Katherine,The apartment was lovely and the view was as gorgeous as advertised.  Catherine left a well-stocked kitchen.  The check-in process was simple and easy.
704764,39631541,2015-07-25,6278429,Stefano,"Absolutely lovely! Catherine was a wonderful host. Apartment was great, location perfect--exactly what we were hoping for!"
704764,41090733,2015-08-04,1548525,Todd,"Catherine is the 'old school' experience of AirBnB -- when hosts went out of their way to not just provide space, but to invite you in.  Amazing personal touches, from some locally-sourced snacks to a personalized note with suggestions.  Great communication, a personal welcome, and a fantastic space on Queen Anne.

If you're tall, take note of low ceilings -- and the lovely owners do occupy the level above the apartment, so you'll hear some 'floor noise' above you.

Those things are trivial, though, when you're enjoying the great views from the porch and enjoying a great neighborhood -- don't forget to eat at the 5 Spot, a personal fave at the top of the hill."
704764,43349206,2015-08-19,27181560,Margie,"We had a lovely stay in this very spacious apartment, which was perfect for our needs.  The apartment is clean, with great views and a gorgeous outlook from the front sitting room. We have lived in Seattle before but if we hadn't, there is ample information about local activities and attractions available in the apartment. Catherine was also very helpful in suggesting some local events for us.
Catherine provided several nice additional touches during our stay- a kitchen stocked with some snacks, fruit and treats (treats were replenished every few days!) as well as access to her great edible garden - we had delicious tomato and kale sandwiches, fresh corn, and pears. Yum. We were also given access to the laundry room which was very helpful, especially after a day spent hiking.
Catherine is very approachable - always available via phone while we were there. We would recommend her apartment and would stay there again when next we visit."
704764,43634359,2015-08-21,37085409,Jan,"The listing was exactly as described.  We communicated several times about shopping and eating suggestions.  She checked in with us twice and provided a few things we needed to entertain our dinner guests.  It was great being less than 15 minutes from SeaTec.  Awesome view, lovely neighborhood and quiet.  Easy street parking appreciated.  We would definitely stay again and recommend to others."
704764,44116775,2015-08-24,12961071,Shannon,"Catherine is a wonderful host who obviously takes a lot of care in providing a lovely accommodation. I had a delightful stay and truly enjoyed the amazing pastries, continental breakfast and recommendations she leaves for her guest. It is in a very safe part of Seattle that is close to many things by public transportation. I was able to relax and rejuvenate during my two night stay."
704764,45365122,2015-09-02,26720907,Gillian,"We had a 4 night stay at Catherine's apartment and from the very beginning Catherine's communication with us was great.. Especially important as we were coming from the UK.
The apartment was immaculate, incredibly comfortable and a real home from home. The fridge was stocked with homemade jams and goodies, bagels, cereals, cheese cake, fruit and snacks were provided and we were encouraged to pick and eat organic produce from the garden. The view was spectacular from the veranda and the suburb very quiet with local shops close by. 
Catherine had supplied a huge amount of information including bus timetables and maps, all very useful.
We arrived in the evening and Catherine so very kindly drove us to restaurants and shops. She also took us to a wonderful local organic market by car on Sunday morning,something we would never have found on our own. We were also pleasantly surprised to find warm homemade apple pie and ice cream waiting for us on our return.. probably the best pastry I've ever tasted!
Catherine and her husband couldn't have been more helpful and friendly and as this was our very first experience of airbnb we were thrilled with the whole adventure.
I would highly recommend Catherine's apartment to any one wanting to stay in the suburb of Queen Anne, with its quirky period homes and views out over the bay. "
704764,46280548,2015-09-09,27375033,Elias,"Okay - so this is probably one of the best weekends of my entire life, and writing about it doesn't do it justice. Catherine was incredibly welcoming from the get-go, super easy to work with, very communicative, and hospitable. We arrived early, no problems there, Catherine was ready for us! She provided an assortment of small snacks from local shops, WOW, and the apartment, particularly the kitchen and bathroom were phenomenal (I am not exaggerating). Location, location, location. Well, this place is top notch there too. Right on the bus route to get downtown, and walking distance to the shops on Queen Anne. Could this place be better, nope, thank you Catherine! "
704764,46707944,2015-09-13,29127470,Aaron,"Catherine's hospitality was exceptional.  From the courtesy of staples and treats in the fridge, to the obvious thought and effort that went into collecting information about her neighborhood and surrounding areas, she could not have been more thoughtful.

Her apartment is spacious, clean, and comfortable.  The location is excellent for exploring Queen Anne and points South.  Unless you're a regular in Seattle and already have favorite spots, ask questions!  Her recommendations were excellent every time and she's eager to share her knowledge of the city.  5 stars."
704764,47079919,2015-09-15,42054449,Stanley,Lovely stay at Catherine's.  Wonderful welcome with home-made goodies waiting for us. Nice apartment with two bedrooms providing ample space for a couple of days stay.  Getting to downtown Seattle was a 10 min Uber ride; averaging at $13. Would come again if back in town.
704764,47654345,2015-09-21,3004560,Stephanie,"First - the pictures don't even do this place justice! Beautiful! Second, the host made us feel welcomed... both via communication with all the different treats and ""make you feel at home"" touches. So wonderful!"
704764,48334440,2015-09-25,190812,Patrick,"Great location & apartment, and Catherine was a great host. Had great dinner/drink recommendations and the house is well stocked for everything else you'll need. Very easy to get ahold of and accommodating of our travel schedule. Will definitely try to stay here again if possible on our next trip to Seattle. "
704764,48869559,2015-09-29,16340540,Mike,"We arrived early in the afternoon the first day of our stay.  Catherine had everything ready for us when we got there, and had communicated earlier that the place was ours early if we wanted it. Because of a glitch with my phone, I didn't receive her information regarding access to the place, but she lives very close, and came right away when she knew we had arrived. Catherine was a wonderful host!    She responded quickly when we had any questions, but otherwise, we did not see her.  She had lots of information regarding great places to eat, things to do and places to shop.  She has the most wonderful garden with fresh vegetables (tomatoes in September - unheard of here at home!).  She encouraged us to pick from the garden.  She made sure we had what we needed, including fresh pastries for our stay!  Our youngest son was thrilled to meet the cats and looked for them every morning of our stay! We were not there much, but it was beautiful and as she described.  There were a couple of evenings where we came back to find parking a bit limited, but we found spaces not far from the house and it wasn't really an issue. The neighborhood was awesome and there were several quaint restaurants and shops not far from the house. We enjoyed the stay and it was comfy and warm and felt as close to home as we could get.  "
704764,49699319,2015-10-05,16221231,Stephne,"Catherine's place is wonderful.  It is very cozy in a great safe neighborhood with amazing views of the water and mountains.  Catherine went above and beyond with all of the extras including, coffee, tea, cookies, muffins, brownies, fruit, etc.  Her place is stocked with bathroom supplies as well.  Her home is located a quiet street and parking was easy to find.  I texted Catherine for a recommendation for a bike rental shop and she delivered her bike to my door step complete with helmet and lock for me to use.  Catherine also recommended a great show at UW.  Her place is stocked with tons of information about the city and restaurant reviews.  I got to meet Catherine and her husband in person and they are both lovely.  I plan to stay here whenever I travel to Seattle.  "
704764,50711517,2015-10-13,45105089,Robyn,Catherine was such a wonderful host! Everything about this house was well thought out and catered toward visitors! My favorite part was all the restaurant recommendations! Had the best meal and experience at a nearby restaurant that was suggested by Catherine! Will definitely stay at the home again! 
704764,50957381,2015-10-16,28635497,Mak,"Catherine was a great host and offers one of the few available units in Queen Anne Hill.  She responded quickly to our inquiries and the check in was as she described it.  The unit is downstairs level of a larger house, with partial views of the ocean. Set on a high ledge above the street.  Thoughtful breakfast items: fresh coffee beans, pastries and yogurt/cereal. We had no trouble finding parking out front. The unit has two good sized bedrooms and an extra- large bath with kitchen and living room.
We enjoyed our stay--missed TV and washer/dryer, but it was as advertised. 

MAK and Alan"
704764,51436927,2015-10-20,29462522,Catherine,"We arrived early for our stay and Catherine was so kind to let us come in sooner than expected. Her two bedroom craftsman home was so comfortable with lots of Windows to show the great views of the Olympic mountains and ocean. My Mother and I loved being able to to drink tea in the sun room and watch the ferries go by.  Even though there was no TV we found lots of great CD's and books to pass the time.  Catherine brought us so many delicious treats and breakfast items that we really enjoyed. My Mom had a hard time climbing the stairs but Catherine allowed us to use the back entrance. She was very kind and informative and helped to locate yoga studios to continue my practice close by. I also enjoyed walking to Queen Anne's street and shopping all the cute stores near by.  From the time we arrived until we had to leave Catherine was a wonderful host of a beautiful home, thank you. "
704764,55656328,2015-12-04,1298855,Anya,"Catherine’s place was super clean and had wonderful views of the Puget Sound and the Olympic mountains. During our stay we’ve experienced some very bright days as well as rainy and foggy ones and regardless of the weather the views were astonishing. 
The bed was very comfortable (we only used one bedroom) and the kitchen had everything one might need for cooking, which we did every day. 
The bathroom is very spacious and the water pressure in the shower is great. I couldn’t resist taking a bath, but if you want to soak in warm water, you need to fill it in several batches, not all at once, otherwise you’ll end up in a cold tub.
We had no car, but between car-to-go and the Uber, we had no problem getting around town. Many stores are reachable on foot, so we were comfortable without a car. It’s important to note, that walking in this neighborhood is very pleasant, since there are many beautiful single family homes with gardens.
During our stay, Catherine weren’t in the house, so noises were minimal if any. 
Overall Catherine’s place as well as its location is wonderful and definitely worth a booking.  We will recommend it to our friends and family and would be glad to stay there again ourselves.

3627658,16236208,2014-07-23,16475469,Rebekah,Jamie is a very pleasant host! Her home is clean and cozy with lots of plants! Would definitely recommend her place. 
3627658,16590939,2014-07-29,18678598,John,"Jamie's apartment was more than sufficient as a place to stay during a trip I recently made to Seattle with two of my friends. While I didn't have a chance to use the kitchen, it seems to be one of the apartment's best features. If visiting in the summer, I wouldn't fret too much about the absence of air conditioning, as a secure screen door lets in a nice breeze. The neighborhood itself has a large number of restaurants and plenty of street parking, while also accessible to the rest of Seattle by car or public transit. That said, if you're an ""unchill bro"" and are looking for a fancy, super-bourgeois place, Jamie's apartment probably isn't for you. It has plenty of plants and sunshine, naturalistic health books, and a next-level earthy vibe [yet is clean and organized]. If that doesn't sound too bad, I'd go ahead with it. Jamie was pretty easy-going and made requests she had clear in a completely inoffensive way. "
3627658,17894715,2014-08-18,1461315,Kelly,"Beautiful apartment in a beautiful neighborhood!  Jamie and Kevin did a great job welcoming us, and we felt right at home in this fantastic Eastlake apartment.  Very nice and clean, excellent communication with the hosts, great convenient location in Seattle.  Make sure to get directions/cross streets from Jamie, as the google map coordinates take you about a block over.  All-in-all a great experience!  Highly recommended."
3627658,18921769,2014-09-02,20538701,Bryna,"I really enjoyed my stay in Seattle. My boyfriend and I have only good things to say about our experience :) Jamie's place is very close to an easy to use bus line. I felt like I had a super easy time getting around because of it, but got the benefits of staying in a quieter neighborhood. The space was very comfortable and clean with a lovely balcony and many beautiful plants!"
3627658,35592844,2015-06-20,10485723,Jason,Amazing location! Immaculate home! Very friendly and great host! A+
3627658,36196434,2015-06-26,206203,Amanda,"Jamie's place is very centrally located and convenient to downtown, the U-District and the wonderful Eastlake neighborhood. Jamie is a friendly host, clear about what she wants, and my stay was comfortable. The apartment is sunny with a friendly balcony and lots of plants. "
3627658,38318777,2015-07-14,27716403,Emily,"The apartment was perfect for a relaxing and laid back vacation. It's definitely meant for quiet and responsible renters. We loved sitting on the deck watching the sun set and the float planes take off. Great location. A couple of wonderful cafes and restaurants located within walking distance. Easy walk to public transportation. Overall, enjoyable stay."
3627658,40023406,2015-07-27,5139125,Maggie,"The listing was exactly as described. Very comfortable stay. The location was absolutely perfect for us, it is just a quick bus ride downtown.  However, there are a ton of cute places in the neighbourhood if you want to stay closer to home!"

We traveled with our 4yr old and 1yr old and they felt right at home. We also loved the location. A quiet friendly street, very close to the zoo and a quick drive to downtown. I highly recommend it!"
5014835,37064284,2015-07-04,10540682,Elise & Tor,"We rented this beautiful house for one week in July 2015. The neighborhood is quiet and safe.
Shirin is a nice and no-hassle host. She provided us with all the instructions we needed and with recommendations for sight-seeing and transport.
There was plenty of sleeping place for the five of us (one king bed, one single bed and two queen airbeds). Sheets and towels were soft and clean. Kitchen and fitness room were great.
We absolutely recommend staying at this house."
2931922,17768598,2014-08-17,17941000,Arjun,"The host was very accomadating in some last minute requests that I had to make. Besides that, the interior is very clean and exterior of the apartment is as nice as any apartment building in the University District is. The neighborhood is very safe and the location is very conveniently located to University Village (shopping mall) which was awesome."
2931922,18717808,2014-08-31,17164986,Laura,"This was definitely an excellent place to stay in Seattle. It is a 15-minute walk to the University of Washington and a 5-10 minute walk to the University Village shopping center. I really liked how it came fully equipped (towels, dishes, bedding, cookware, etc) and the in-unit washer/dryer made laundry easy to deal with.  The 2 bathrooms made mornings easy for a group of 4 people and the TV was nice to relax in front of after a long day.  Melissa was very kind and accommodating in answering my questions and providing us with extra bedding.  However, the wireless is a little slow. "
2931922,18901852,2014-09-02,16688743,Jonathan,"Melissa was a great host, she made us feel welcome at the apartment.  The stay was also very comfortable.  The listing description was accurate, and matched our expectations.  "
2931922,25464864,2015-01-17,22851995,Karen,Lovely apartment with a very convenient washer/dryer in the apartment.  Quiet neighborhood and close enough to UW that we did not need a car.  I will look for Melissa's listings whenever I visit Seattle in the future.
2931922,27313373,2015-03-01,12041009,Jenny,The reservation was canceled 101 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2931922,39629126,2015-07-25,33964488,Giorgio,"Melissa was a nice host, the house was clean and neat and she was available for any need during our stay. Moreover has anything you need for your stay. Really close to grocery stores (5 min walk) and UW (15 min walk). "
2931922,41088433,2015-08-04,11428382,David,"Melissa was very accessible, both before and during our stay. They place was just what we needed when visiting at UW. University Village (groceries, restaurants) was minutes away as was the university. And for a slight fee we were able to park our car securely inside."
2931922,42544649,2015-08-14,36971857,Thunicia,"Pros:  
Great location for sightseeing
Lovely university neighborhood
Spacious 
Two bathrooms

Cons:  
A poorly decorated student flat with sparsely equipped kitchen
Second floor apartment with no lift
No parking and no information about parking
No directions as to where to find the apartment keys once you’ve entered the building
No suggestions of what to do or see locally
Despite paying cleaning fees, we were asked to take rubbish and recycling out and to put towels in the washer

Overall:
The pictures on the website are highly selective and the apartment does not look as it appears in the photos. If this was advertised as the student flat that it is, we would have chosen another of the student flats which were advertised for a significantly lower rate. 
"
2931922,44350737,2015-08-25,31263749,Ling,Melissa is nice. The apt is very quiet and bright. The room is spacious. I really love the kitchen which is all furnished and easy to use. My dad cooked a lot of dishes hah. The apt also located Near university village.  And it is really convenient. It only take 5 min walk through a little hill. And it is also very close to uw. Takes about 10 min to the north campus. Nice place to live.    
2931922,48556874,2015-09-27,795036,Ben,The apartment was just as advertised.  Melissa was very responsive when we needed something.  I would stay there again.
609421,17269812,2014-08-10,6236620,Chris,"Louise's home was settled in a pretty quiet area of Greenwood. The home was clean and very comfortable. The 5 minute walk to the QFC was also quite convenient! From the moment that Louise first replied to my inquiry, I could tell that she would be a wonderful host, and I was not wrong! She made sure that everything that I had was in order and kept me abreast of things going on around the city. She is probably the sweetest lady that you'll ever meet! If you stay here, you're stay in Seattle will be that much more pleasant!"
609421,35134140,2015-06-15,34263001,Serena,"Louise was a wonderful host. There was a bowl of fruit for us upon our arrival and a pot of fresh coffee every morning (there is a coffee maker in the apartment if you want to make your own). The apartment was clean and perfect for our needs. The kitchen is tiny but very well outfitted with dishes, pots and pans and two small fridges - just about everything you could need. Each bedroom has closet and bureau or shelf space available for storage during your stay.  The bedrooms are larger than they appear in the photos. Plenty of towels for guests too. There is a small outdoor patio that is quite nice. In addition we enjoyed sitting in the shade on a large swing. It is a quiet neighborhood- conveniently close to everything in Seattle. There is a supermarket a within a short walking distance. Louise was easily accessible by text to answer any questions. The wifi was not very good, but when we asked, Louise loaned us her hotspot which solved the problem. We would certainly recommend this as a great place to stay. "
4909327,35016336,2015-06-14,7140746,Dominick,"Had a fantastic stay at Michael's place. Everything was exactly as pictured, super comfortable and clean. The entire second floor, including a patio was all mine.

 Michael was super friendly and went out of his way to make sure everything was perfect.

The location is nice and quiet but still a quick bus (or light rail) ride to downtown or to capitol hill. There were also a few decent restaurants within walking distance, and a small convenience store a few blocks away."
4909327,35490652,2015-06-19,20812996,Maren,"Couldn't have been more satisfied with our stay, Michael was a great host! Very helpful and available w/out being intruding. As far as the accommodations, they were spot on, about on par as a ultra modern hotel. Bed was comfy, place was very clean and Michael has an excellent eye for detail. Thanks again! Great place, great deal. "
4909327,37901159,2015-07-11,36845595,Eleanor,"Beautiful home. Lovely and clean and just as the pictures suggest - even with fresh flowers as an extra special touch. Good sized bedroom, super comfy bed and private use of a bathroom (modem and again, very clean). Also has its own balcony which gets the morning sun and access to the roof terrace too. Room is on the warm side but Michael has provided a great fan which is quiet and efficient. I had a car; parking was easy and the property is easily accessible from the interstates. Also very close to the light rail too though which links to town or the airports. I felt very safe and very welcome in Michael's home.  I would highly recommend this listing. "
4909327,39088360,2015-07-20,31396006,Laurel,"Michael was the best host i've ever had. His home was an incredibly beautiful and immaculate space. The location was perfect. Michael was also so accommodating. I had a lot of last minute issues during my trip, but Michael helped make things so much easier by helping me out. The bedroom is very comfortable - loved the view, the bed, and the speaker system. :) The bathroom was also super great! Seattle is a fun city, and I really enjoyed spending some of my time chatting with Michael and listening to his recommendations for city life. Thanks, Michael!"
4909327,39580049,2015-07-24,39066797,Tony,"Michael was an amazing host. This was my first time using Airbnb, and I couldn't have asked for a better experience. The room was immaculate (and very well decorated!), the bed comfortable, and the view (from both the room and rooftop patio) was perfect. Most importantly, Michael was a very kind and gracious host who made me feel welcome on my first trip to Seattle. Would absolutely recommend!"
4909327,39789508,2015-07-26,21693107,Derek,"It was a very easy place to find, didn't even have to knock on the wrong door lol, Michael, is a very easy/out going person... thats what i got from the whole 20 mins i saw and talked to him, he offered his knowledge of the city and anything we needed help with, his home is very clean and quiet, its got cool blinds to play with, you'll see what I'm talking about! the neighbour hood is very quiet and safe. there is a school field right across street where kids can play and run around while you enjoy the roof top balcony, BBQ included. What I'm saying is, its like a hotel with more privacy, quiet time, more room and better comfort. There are no restaurants within close walking distance, downtown is only a 5 minute UBER ride away, if your Canadian you need to try out UBER, one of the best ways to get around town."
4909327,40394610,2015-07-30,36626310,Cindy,"This space was super nice, clean, private and better than I expected. Michael was nice ,helpful and provided me with everything I needed. I would definitely stay again and recommend his place to others."
4909327,41665911,2015-08-08,9168108,Pamela,"Michael was a hospitable and most accommodating host.  He took the time to help us plot our sightseeing journeys in Seattle and beyond.  Even down to helping set up an Uber account!  Mu daughter and I enjoyed staying at Michael's place for the privacy, convenience, and cleanliness.  ""Ultra-Modern Hypoallergenic"" is an apt descriptor.  His Beacon Hill neighborhood is a gem to explore in itself, full of charm and character.  One of the great things about Air BnB, and this host in particular, is the opportunity to meet locals who know their areas.  It's such an enriching part of an adventure.  Thank you, Michael.  We enjoyed our stay!"
4909327,42164499,2015-08-11,24304254,Mike,Everything was great.  House was clean and as advertised. The host was friendly and gave great recommendations on things to do.  There is a great view and near the beacon hill light rail stop.  Will definitely come back next time I'm in Seattle.
4909327,42627761,2015-08-14,3059092,Meghal,"Very clean place with great privacy inspite of sharing it with the host. 
Michael is a great host and was always available on phone/email for any questions that I had. Would highly recommend this place. "
4909327,42946544,2015-08-16,9710591,Rachel,"Michael's Ultra-Modern Hypoallergenic Retreat was exactly as described, and Michael was a kind, generous and unobtrusive host. The decor of the house is clean, stylish and refreshing, with lots of plants and greenery. Everything worked great - the wifi, the keypad entrance, the kitchen, the shower. We had the 2nd floor essentially to ourselves, including a reading nook and balcony with a very comfortable chair and a beautiful view. Our bedroom had its own lock. There were hi-tech amenities such as an air purifier and a Sirius radio that we didn't end up using -- on a longer stay we'd probably give them a try.  The neighborhood is quiet, but only 1/2 mile from the Beacon Hill Station, and some shops.  Wonderful place and great host!"
4909327,44042873,2015-08-23,403973,Kevin,Simple.Smooth.Clean.Quite.Good design.Highly recommended.
4909327,45214261,2015-08-31,28257453,Kait,We had a last minute cancellation and Michael was so accommodating and opened his home to us! The apartment is amazing and right outside the city! We had a great time and recommend his location to everyone looking to staying in Seattle! 
4909327,47429204,2015-09-18,44000054,Mukesh,"I was traveling to Seattle for work.. and could not find a decent hotel near downtown. So I decided to AirBnB. 
Michael was very responsive to all the questions I had. The house is very nice and clean. Very close to downtown. 
The apartment is bright and clean and looks just like the photos. Would definitely stay here again!"
3592838,17399444,2014-08-11,19262249,Ellen,"Very nice place. Great update to the unit, and the host makes us feel very welcomed. We arrived late due to traffic and Tony was very flexible in meeting with us. The neighborhood can't be better, we walked pretty much everywhere and didn't need a car nor taxi. We love to come back and visit again. Thank you.
"
3592838,17586287,2014-08-14,8241762,Jim,"Great place, amazing view. Easy to meet up and manage logistics with Tony. Neighborhood is super convenient. Would stay again! Thanks Tony."
3592838,17652938,2014-08-15,1341313,Alexander,"My best airbnb stay ever

Tony has a spacious one-bedroom apartment on a high floor, with ‘helicopter views’ of the Seattle harbor.  The apartment, with its private balcony and a stone shower, is in top-notch condition.  The indoor garage in the same building is a huge convenience. Easy walk to everywhere.

Tony is a gentleman and a very nice person.  My wife and I had a fabulous stay.
"
3592838,17872265,2014-08-18,2304586,Julie,"This is a great apartment with stunning views of Seattle and the waterfront.  It is a nice building, reasonably quiet (since it is on the 19th floor), and has easy access and parking.  The location is perfect, easy walking to downtown, Pike Street and the Space Needle.  We loved the place and would be delighted to stay there again.  Tony was a great host and very responsive, although there was nothing  major that we needed.  The apartment is clean, spacious, comfortable furnishings and has everything you need for a great stay in Seattle."
3592838,18077704,2014-08-21,6546860,Noa,"Tony was awesome!! He was at the apartment when we arrived and let us in. The location couldn't be better and the apartment itself is absolutely amazing! Having breakfast and watching the sunset over the water was a perfect added bonus to the trip.
We walked everywhere! The apartment is literally between the space needle and pike's place market!"
3592838,18199316,2014-08-23,14251393,Gavin,"We had a great stay at Tony's apartment. The location is hard to beat, just a few minutes walk to Pike Place, Belltown restaurants and cafés along 1st Ave. The view from his cosy 19th floor apartment is incredible. The unit is clean, modern, comfortable and the building has a BBQ on the 7th floor with a pool, hot tub and basic gym. Tony was responsive to one request we had (there were no plates in the kitchen, so he went out and bought some and dropped them over to us) and generally made the stay there easy and stress free. I'd definitely recommend it! "
3592838,18340074,2014-08-25,7431461,Nate,"Tony is a great host and his place is amazing. My friend that lives in Seattle thought it was the best view of the city and sound that he's seen so far. Clean apartment with everything you need.
I would definitely recommend (especially since most nearby hotels were more expensive)."
3592838,18454315,2014-08-26,9797063,Nam,Tony was flexible with my arrival time.  The view is as good as the other reviewers say it is.  The apartment is very comfortable.
3592838,18560223,2014-08-28,18784646,William,"Great view and apartment, Tony very helpful, no aircon though, can be a bit loud at night from street below with windows open."
3592838,18668274,2014-08-30,18413302,Keiko,"The apartment itself is wonderful, and the location is perfect. Tony was very nice and hospitable. He checked if we need any help and provided a lot of info for the restaurants and stores. We had a wonderful time!"
3592838,18816404,2014-09-01,9710038,David,"Tony was friendly and responsive.  Having lived in Seattle for many years, I can say the location and view are outstanding.  Having access to parking is very helpful for downtown.  Hope to return another time - thanks Tony."
3592838,18926369,2014-09-02,7290729,Steven,Tony's place was wonderful and the view was spectacular as advertised. I felt awful I didn't get to town until super late but Tony was extremely gracious. I recommend his place highly.
3592838,18975594,2014-09-03,7758368,Jake,"Tony's place was great - views were as advertised, interior very comfortable and nice.  Central location with lots of good restaurants and access.  Tony was a welcoming and responsive host.  Thank you for a great visit.  "
3592838,19037988,2014-09-05,19688073,Kathryn,"Great host, wonderful location, spectacular views of the city and waterfront. Amazing upscale amenities & lots of privacy.  Within walking distance to Pike Place Market, Century Link, Safeco Field and many restaurants and coffee shops in Belltown.  By far, the best place we've stayed in Seattle for years!"
3592838,19298841,2014-09-09,15895940,Mirim,Tony was very kind and his apartment is really awesome. I had a great time with this place.The view of this apartment was so much better than the picture that I saw online.  I strongly recommend this place to travel Seattle!
3592838,19471917,2014-09-13,598707,Jimmy,"Tony was very responsive and extremely pleasant. He went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed and that our stay was perfect. I was skeptical that the photos might have exaggerated the view from the actual unit, but it turns out that that are completely accurate; you can easily see downtown, the space needle, and the sound while sitting on the balcony. It really is breathtaking. The neighborhood has many fantastic places such as Bedlam Coffee and Bathtub Gin Company. I've already recommended this property to other friends who will be visiting Seattle soon."
3592838,19581647,2014-09-14,21197152,Jacquie,"Breath taking views of Seattle, I could smell the ocean from the balcony. Great location. A short walk to Pikes Place Market. Tons of bars and restaurants near by. Very clean condo. I would stay there again. Very little interaction with the host, but that was okay with us."
3592838,19879944,2014-09-20,19656566,Paula,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Tony's place.  The view is spectacular and the location couldn't have been better.  The condo is very clean and comfortable.  Tony is extremely responsive and accommodating to our requests.

The neighborhood is nice and relatively quiet with many interesting restaurants - my favorite is List on 1st Ave, about 3 minutes' walk from the condo.  We walked or took the public transportation during the entire stay.  There is a small grocery store conveniently located at the corner.  The building has a swimming pool at the 7th floor so don't forget your gear."
3592838,20042336,2014-09-22,20893192,Kate,Tony was also very accessible and responsive via phone for any questions we had and was there to greet us upon arrival and walk us through the building and unit. The unit was just as pictured and the view from the balcony is not to be missed.
3592838,20169836,2014-09-24,21498491,Marc,Great apartment with amazing views.  Easy walk to everything.  Tony accommodated a late arrival time and was there to walk me through the space.  Would rent again.
3592838,20289308,2014-09-27,17224875,Marc,"Tony's place is terrific.  The view is spectacular, and the location is perfect.  And on top of all that, it has a secured parking space for those of you that need a car, which I did.  Yes you can walk to just about everything in the downtown area or take public transportation to destinations in the city, but I needed to visit a few places outside of Seattle proper.  Parking on the streets is expensive and challenging at times, so that parking space was golden.  

The condo was clean, and Tony is as interactive as you need him to be.  I would definitely recommend Best View In Seattle to anyone planning a visit to Seattle.  The unit is perfect for a couple, but you can also sleep two more people on the couch, although not as comfortably as the bed."
3592838,20434688,2014-09-29,20471245,Brian,everything went well - amazing view! easy to walk around downtown or to the space needle from this location. tony was great!
3592838,20622100,2014-10-02,21458366,James,"Listing was as described.  Incredible views.  Disclaimer needs to be made regarding park spot, very tight fit.  We often stay in Belltown at the Ace, but decided to try ABNB for a change.  Tony was pleasant, although my significant other was apprehensive at first..."
3592838,20760648,2014-10-05,15498845,Meera,"Tony's place was amazing. The views were incredible and the location is ideal. Walking distance to cool restaurants and bars, Pike Place and the Space Needle/ Seattle Center. The shower was great and the heated bathroom floors was a nice plus. Tony was very kind and flexible with check in and check out. He even built our portable crib for us, which really helped us out and was beyond expectations. I would highly recommend this unit for a visit to Seattle."
3592838,20835297,2014-10-06,13456308,Ashley,"Our stay at Tony's unit was amazing!  The view has got to be one of the best in Seattle!  The space was incredibly clean and convenient to local restaurants/bars/coffee shops (literally right out the door) and Pike's market (about a 8 minute walk).  The balcony view allowed you to easily see the Space Needle, downtown and the harbor.  Sitting on the balcony watching the boats come in/out was a huge highlight.  We arrived earlier than planned and Tony was super accommodating to meet up early.  I can not recommend this place enough!  Our favorite AirBnB experience yet!"
3592838,20935840,2014-10-07,8162176,Ken,"Well, the description is entirely correct. It IS the best view in Seattle. The place is great and close to Pike Place. Walk to everything. Tony is great and low stress. A great value."
3592838,21126498,2014-10-12,11047977,Jenney,"Tony was ready and waiting when I arrived.  Much appreciated! He was friendly and informative which also helps in a new location/ neighborhood. But it is really the view which moves this place to the top of the list.  I have visited Seattle before and stayed via Airbnb.  This time I spent a little more and got so much extra.  Didn't want to leave the apartment but there is a lot ""happening"" close by and so convenient.  Definitely recommend Tony's place."
3592838,21201173,2014-10-13,11047977,Jenney,A+++
3592838,21434917,2014-10-17,21863163,Edward,My recent visit went very well - Tony was in touch with me throughout the stay and the place was very clean. Beautiful view and great coffee nearby. Highly recommended.
3592838,21518372,2014-10-19,20899926,Spencer,"Awesome views, great location within walking distance of all the best Seattle has to offer. Private parking space was a plus and the condo was tidy. The only downside was there was no hand soap or toilet paper... Luckily there was a grocery store next door! Lastly, Tony was accommodating when we showed up early."
3592838,21647956,2014-10-20,22684641,Melany,"The condo was as described - wonderful views, great location in proximity to everything, safe, clean and beautiful! Tony was extremely easy to work with, responsive to text, dependable, etc.  It was my first time renting through AirBnB and it was overall a terrific experience. I would rent this condo again!
"
3592838,21885729,2014-10-26,1634890,Steve,"Belltown Seattle is a great area for food, drinks, and shopping. The place was a great spot for a weekend in the city. The views are amazing and it is close to everything we wanted to do in Seattle. 

Heated floors in the bathroom were nice!"
3592838,22094095,2014-10-29,8736741,Jenna,"Luxury condo, best view, communicative host. This was one of the nicest condos I've ever stayed in, if not THE nicest. I definitely got to enjoy the luxury of the city from the 180 degree view through the floor to ceiling windows. I could walk out on my balcony and see everything across the ocean all the way to the Space Needle. Beautiful! I would stay again and definitely recommend to all."
3592838,22256852,2014-11-02,13379906,Eve,"Tony's condo is beautiful.  It's exactly as described, view is awesome, location is perfect as far as main tourist attractions.  My son and I felt comfortable in this condo, it's upscale yet cozy.  The sofa was sooo comfortable and fun, you will find why out when you rent the place yourself.        Tony was very sweet, he met with us to show the place and make sure we understood how to
get in and around the complex.   
I would suggest more cookware to go with the gourmet kitchen ;) good job Tony we will visit again ;)"
3592838,22475078,2014-11-07,22152855,Chris,"Excellent host and a fantastic place to stay while visiting Seattle.  The place is truly in an ideal location.  There are tons of great bars and restaurants within walking distance, the Pike Place market is only about 1/3 of a mile walk and there is a CrossFit gym right on the same block which was a plus for me.  Tony was very accommodating and getting into and out of the place was a breeze.  I will definitely be staying here again!"
3592838,22526609,2014-11-09,9004269,Kathryn,Tony was great! No problem checking in at all.
3592838,22842972,2014-11-16,17161142,Justin,"The view was amazing as stated.  The place was a great place to stay, very clean, with short walks to anything you could imagine.  After that a quick cab ride.  Tony was a great host and very responsive.  Having a parking spot was awesome as well.  "
3592838,23084647,2014-11-22,607714,Natnaal,"This condo exceeded my expectations. The view was great, the location was perfect and the listing had everything I needed. Tony was flexible with my checkin, and walked me through everything I needed to know. The condo is in a good part of belltown, but walking distance to everything downtown, or a cheap cab ride. The view overlooks the best parts of Seattle. I even had a chance to use the hot tub and sauna. The parking was great, especially because downtown Seattle is very expensive. Looking forward to staying here again. "
3592838,23234510,2014-11-25,1849089,Nancy,"""Best View in Seattle"" did not disappoint!  The views are spectacular! The master bed was very comfortable.  What a treat to wake up to such an amazing view!
Kitchen looked fun, but with such a short stay we opted to try different restaurants.  We followed one review suggesting ""List"", a few blocks away.  Great suggestion.  We also enjoyed happy hour at ""Rob Roy"", also local.  For breakfast it was Sound Foods Cafe in Pike Place Market's lower level.
Tony was prompt with initial contact and meeting us.  The parking spot was a HUGE bonus!  
We love visiting our old hometown and plan to rent Tony's condo for numerous  future visits!"
3592838,23259454,2014-11-26,20092746,Carlos,"Beautiful view, clean condo, comfortable bed and Tony was very friendly and accommodating to my later than expected arrival time.  He also gave good advice on places to go and our car was safely parked off the street in a parking garage in the building.  Overall,  everything was perfect and I'd stay again!  Thanks Tony."
3592838,23335351,2014-11-29,18024099,Blair,"OH MY GOODNESS--the views!  the pictures don't even do it justice!  We were so cozy in the unit and loved drinking water looking at the space needle, the bay, the mountain range in the distance, the skyline...  i took as many pictures from the balcony as I did just walking around Seattle!  It was such a special experience, thanks Tony!"
3592838,23605763,2014-12-06,5548671,Jill,"We stayed at Tony's place for 2 nights. It was exactly as shown in the pictures - great view, large space, nice decorations. The location was really convenient for ppl who wanted to explore Seattle. There was a hiccup in check-in but we did appreciate Tony's effort.  "
3592838,23818490,2014-12-11,16511810,Candice,"Tony's place was as pictured, with amazing views of the city and water. The bed was super comfortable and we enjoyed using the building's communal pool and hot tub.
Due to an emergency with one of Tony's co-workers we had to check in a couple of hours later than planned but he was very apologetic and offered a full refund if we chose not to wait.
Overall we would definitely stay here again! It's a great location in downtown Seattle, just a short walk away from Pike Place Market and great restaurants, shops and sights."
3592838,23943783,2014-12-15,22566626,Patty,"Check in was easy and Tony was waiting for us when we arrived. The condo has the best location. It is close to everything! You really don't need a car, if your feeling lazy, uber it anywhere for a few bucks.

The reviews are spot on in terms of location and views. The views really are amazing! better then the photos."
3592838,24836501,2015-01-03,23474667,Jacqui,"Despite being out of town himself on our day of arrival, Tony had put plans in place to make our access to the apartment stress free and uncomplicated. Everything went to plan and he stayed in touch by e mail to make sure everything was ok. He let us know as soon as he was back in town and was available to give advice re daytrips and eating out. The apartment was in the BEST location with almost everything on our 'bucket list' within walking distance and lots of restaurants, bars and coffee shops nearby. There is a grocery store on 3rd Ave on the next block but it is quite expensive. We did hire a car for a few days and the parking space was a great bonus during that time. We hired from SIXT on 2nd Ave which was easy for pick up and drop off with good service and NO pressure to buy 'extras' As everyone else has said previously, the views from the apartment are priceless. The various forms of transport on the water, sky and even on the road provided constant entertainment, better than TV at times! We also benefitted from a spectacular view of the Space Needle at midnight at New Year lighting up with fireworks in addition to all the activity on the rooftops, streets and water below, it made an New Year to remember. The apartment was very spacious. I had been a bit concerned about storage for all our bags as we have seldom taken so much stuff on holiday (ski gear and winter woollies). These concerns were allayed and the cupboards easily absorbed all our stuff. The bathroom is gorgeous, under floor heating, beautifully tiled, spacious shower cabinet with a nice little seat. The kitchen is spacious and has great storage. The washer/dryer was a bonus during our 8 day stay. the lounge was also spacious with a VERY comfortable reclining sofa which seats 2 (the middle 'seat' is a storage compartment). There is an additional office chair and kitchen chairs. My 15 year old son opted to sleep on the fold down chair as he prefers to have a completely flat bed and not sleep on a 'leather' covered surface. He was quite happy on this for 8 nights. Sleeping on the reclining sofa would also be possible for those who prefer. The double bed was very comfortable. The highlights of our trip were:- THE SPACE NEEDLE (very nice lunch - was a bit expensive but not too bad when you consider that it includes access to the top which would cost $20pp itself, so deduct this from your food bill. Try the ice cream it is a special experience). To give you an idea of how good it is - my IT addicted son was rather disparaging about another young man who did nothing but play on his game boy. ""how can he just look at a game with views like this out of the window!!"" he exclaimed...."
3592838,26107265,2015-02-03,15665579,Richard,"Tony was a great host and the apartment is actually even better than described. It's hard for the pictures to do justice to the view, it really is spectacular. 

Well situated in Belltown, so the area is 'lively' around the apartment but always very safe in my experience. Very walkable for restaurants, bars and most of the popular tourist spots. 

Tony was on hand to meet me on arrival and responded very quickly to a couple of queries I had. 

An unreserved recommendation. "
3592838,26189503,2015-02-06,351008,Amy,"Tony was a great host. He was there to greet us and show us around. His Condo was very comfortable. The view was spectacular...We would love to own a place like his...until then. We will return and enjoy his diggs...BTW the free parking  was a great score!!!

Thank you for everything Tony!"
3592838,26296471,2015-02-09,20562470,Kevin,This location is excellent. It's in an area of Seattle that I've stayed in many times and that I know well. The location is very convenient to the local downtown sites. The view is great.  
3592838,26369000,2015-02-10,6763507,Marcel,Tony was great. He was easy to reach and very flexible with check in and check out. The apartment was clean and cozy and the views were amazing. Highly recommend this apartment for your next trip to Seattle. 
3592838,26526612,2015-02-15,25468270,Jeremy,"What a great apartment!! The cleaners were running a little late the day we got into town so we had to wait around a while before getting in. Tony was very apologetic and said we could have a late check out to make up for it. He was friendly and met us at the building to show us around, give us the keys and the garage opener. The neighborhood is centrally located and within walking distance to lots of restaurants and tourist sites. Having a designated parking spot in the building was a life saver!! I would recommend getting an economy sized car because the spot is fairly small and could be difficult or impossible to fit a large car our SUV. The inside of the apartment is totally updated! The heated floors were a nice touch. You can't say enough about the views. The pictures don't do it any justice!! We would definitely stay here again on our next trip to this amazing city."
3592838,26815789,2015-02-20,12594103,Tom,"A great apartment, location AND car space in Seattle... Need I say more? Tony was easy to deal with and the reservation went without complication."
3592838,26898506,2015-02-21,1311858,Grace,great view and perfect location. ideal for walking to all the sites in downtown. the apt is clean and modern. very good communication with Tony. Will definitely recommend this place.
3592838,27031384,2015-02-23,13896725,Jerry,Tony was very responsive to our inquiries.  The unit was very accurately described in the listing; there were no surprises.  The location (especially the view) is WONDERFUL.  We will be renting this unit from Tony on our next visit to Seattle.
3592838,27084140,2015-02-24,21926812,Mike,"This is a really fantastic unit. The views are wonderful, over the Sound, the Space Needle, the Cascade Mountains in the distance. The bed is comfortable, the place is clean and furnished with everything we could have needed. Our host was generous with his knowledge and availability while not being remotely intrusive. A really great overall experience."
3592838,27147388,2015-02-26,1924599,Jay,"Tony's place was great. Nice finish and beautiful views - just like the photos.

It is walking distance to a bunch of cool bars and cafes. Great condo in a great neighborhood."
3592838,27444531,2015-03-04,18721899,Jonathan,I had a great time staying at Tony's condo in the Belltown area. The rooms were just as shown in the pictures and the view was amazing.  It is also really convenient to have your own parking spot in the middle of the city. Highly recommend this place if you're looking for something a little more fancy.
3592838,27477549,2015-03-05,28243723,Shannon,"This was my first airbnb experience and it was truly amazing! For starters Tony was great with communication. He is personable and prompt. 
The apartment was perfect! It was clean and spacious. Morning, Noon or night, the views are hands down breathtaking. A nice touch was the heated floor in the bathroom. 
The walkability of the apartment was spot on. We could skip down to Pike's Place and a great doughnut shop is two blocks up. 
Lastly, FREE parking was an added bonus that in the great city of Seattle. 
If you want something more than what a hotel can offer I highly recommend this location and listing. "
3592838,27490506,2015-03-06,3930779,Colan,Tony's place was the perfect getaway for my girlfriend and I for a weekend in Seattle. I called Tony the day we arrived in town to make arrangements to meet him at the condo. He responded to all enquiries promptly and met us at the agreed upon time. The apartment was great and the view was as advertised. I think the photos I took are even better than what is shown on the site. It's about 10 min walking distance to Pike Place Market. I also liked that a parking stall came with the rental. Saved a lot of hassle trying to park downtown. Would definitely recommend this condo if you want to be central in Seattle.
3592838,27673896,2015-03-09,19806996,Ali,Experience was great! Tony came by and gave us the key and always responded quickly if we had a question. Home was beautiful and the view is breathe taking! Would definitely stay here again! 
3592838,27764039,2015-03-11,3450975,Derek,We had a great stay in Seattle and Tony's condo made it that much more special.  It's in a great downtown location within easy walking distance of many attractions and dining options.  The view from the 19th floor is hard to beat!  Everything went well and we look forward to staying here again some day in the future.
3592838,27868948,2015-03-14,16762431,Michael,"Gorgeous views, comfortable condo in the heart of Belltown - easy to drive or walk anywhere.  Great spot, I'll be back!"
3592838,27976594,2015-03-15,15745612,Emily,"Between the location and the free parking spot, this spot is ideal for easily exploring all that Seattle has to offer. Within easy walking distance of a multitude of attractions, including excellent bars and restaurants. The true highlight of this Air BnB is the view: rain or shine, balcony or bedroom, the panoramic sweep of city & sound is truly magnificent."
3592838,28097926,2015-03-17,28702025,Von Ryan,"Tony was great! Communication was seamless, Tony was at the apartment with the keys ready for our arrival. Upon arrival, Tony had the place already cleaned and provided clear instructions as to how to go about parking and leaving the apartment. The apartment was absolutely gorgeous! Just like in the photos, the place is modern and the views are incredible! Thanks to Tony, our trip to Seattle was amazing! I highly recommend Tony and his apartment!"
3592838,28381114,2015-03-23,25013210,Dax,Great view and close to alot of things like bars and restaurants.
3592838,28475842,2015-03-24,8779055,Stu,Nice place. Unfortunately the host's work schedule prevented us from utilizing the benefit of the units parking. Check in was delayed til almost 6pm. We understand this was unlucky with a mix of seattle rush hour.  Great views. Cool pad. 
3592838,28549610,2015-03-25,17647931,Kristi,"The views were amazing and the location was perfect!  Will definitely try to stay here every time we're in Seattle.  Parking spot in the building is a great perk, even though it's easy to walk everywhere from the condo.

Tony was super accommodating, even though our schedule kept changing.  He was easygoing and helpful, and made our stay very comfortable and relaxing.  Great apartment and host!

"
3592838,28591771,2015-03-26,17647931,Kristi,"Tony was great, and the apartment was incredible!

Gorgeous views, excellent location, and amazing price.  We had a bunch of scheduling problems and Tony was super flexible and accommodating.  Will stay there again every time I visit Seattle if possible!"
3592838,28697433,2015-03-29,25169754,Jesse,"The apartment was perfect - very well stocked, beautiful view, clean, comfortable, and convenient. Tony went out of his way to get us in a little earlier than planned. Will stay here again and recommend my friends here as well."
3592838,28834068,2015-03-30,29596855,Michael,"Tony was great to work with. He was very responsive and communicated thoroughly with us. Tony made our first experience with Airbnb a very positive one. The apartment was more beautiful than pictures can do justice, very well kept up, and had all of the amenities you could need. The only way the building could be better located is if it was attached to the Pike St market itself. We decided not to rent a car for our stay in Seattle and are so glad, because we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. "
3592838,29037696,2015-04-03,5018021,Greg,"Place was just as described. Beautiful views, walkable to so many great places, and spacious. 

Would definitely stay here again if and when we find ourself back in Seattle."
3592838,29970806,2015-04-15,10317436,Zach,Great apartment and an example of why airbnb works so well
3592838,30116071,2015-04-17,31240516,Trenton,Stay here. This is what you are looking for. I am sure.
3592838,30193022,2015-04-19,3968452,Andy,"Tony is fine host - a bit late letting us in, but all was in order. Please was AS advertised and at least half the pleasure there is the view. Location is IDEAL for DT Seattle and for those willing to pay this price it is worth it to have lovely kitchen, bath, bedroom, etc.  Better for TWO than three......futon not great."
3592838,30989381,2015-04-30,447836,Marius,"The apartment was great, the most amazing views ever! It's really nice, comfortable and clean, and in a great location too.

Tony is the best host ever, he's very helpful and responsive, he even drove over late at night in order to replace the batter of the fire alarm, which was beeping. He very well deserves his Superhost status."
3592838,31546010,2015-05-06,29748950,Tessa,The apartment is absolutely beautiful and in a perfect location. Tony was very accommodating. I definitely recommend this apartment and host!
3592838,31693332,2015-05-09,25564631,Jill,"Awesome views, just as pictured!  Great place to take in gorgeous views of the city with lots of places to eat and things to do within walking distance."
3592838,32392868,2015-05-17,11456732,Claire Celeste,Great view of water. Fun urban area of Seattle. Tony was very accommodating for key pickup. 
3592838,32529907,2015-05-19,21239095,Shane,"Great place! Tony made himself available if needed and was accommodating in meeting us to check in.  Fantastic location, clean place, great coffee shop around the corner (Bedlam Coffee), minutes from everywhere.  Having a parking space is clutch, as public parking costs a fortune downtown."
3592838,32776359,2015-05-21,30808694,Robynn,"The apartment was very comfortable!  The panoramic view was amazing!  We loved staying here and would love to come here again.  We appreciated the quiet surroundings and were very relaxed.

Walking distance to many great restaurants and shopping. "
3592838,33065439,2015-05-25,3387960,Allison,"Tony's apartment is wonderful! It is in the Belltown neighborhood of Seattle. There are many restaurants and shops nearby, and Pike's Place Market is a short 5-10 minute walk away. It is centrally located so we were able to walk almost everywhere. The views from the private balcony are truly magical. Overall, a great apartment in a perfect location."
3592838,34110445,2015-06-04,1903661,Andrew,Great apartment with amazing views and location. The place was very clean and comfortable. I really appreciate how accommodating the host was with my late check in time.
3592838,34170977,2015-06-05,905412,Kate,"If you can stay here, do so!  I can't imagine you'd have any regrets.  Well equipped, bright, and everything to love. The views, the location, and really everything made it first rate.  It was especially helpful  as we had only short time in Seattle and wanted to make the most of a great location. We discovered that the best way to contact the host prior arrival is via text message/ SMS.   "
3592838,34279786,2015-06-07,12222973,Lindsay,"Tony provided a super easy care-free stay for us. From check-in to check-out the whole process was quick and simple. The apartment is so amazing, and as others have said you can't beat those views! We loved having coffee on the porch everyday during our stay. Don't hesitate to stay here, such a great experience!"
3592838,35085515,2015-06-15,31212741,Vicki,Host was on time and helpful via texts with prompt response on a few items.
3592838,36180641,2015-06-26,12301996,Matthew,The apartment was clean and the furniture was comfortable.  The views from the balcony are some of the best in the city.  Tony was very easy to communicate with and made us feel welcome.  The building's security features made my wife feel safe. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND staying at Tony's place.
3592838,37893548,2015-07-11,17915822,Taylor,"Tony was easy to contact and responded quickly to messages. The view from the suite is spectacular and the building secure. The free parking made access really easy. A perfect place to explore Seattle.  The apartment is lovely-spacious, and modern with lovely bathroom and kitchen. "
3592838,38252633,2015-07-14,28396634,Yee Gan,"This was my first experience of booking through Airbnb and it couldn't have been a better introduction

Tony was an excellent host and great at replying to messages. We were able to keep in touch initially by email and then mobile when we arrived in the city. He was very helpful and flexible about check in and check out times, working around the other guests

As far as the apartment goes, the word VIEWS says it all. Stunning views of Puget Sound, Seattle Center including the Space Needle and downtown. The photos tell the story. The apartment has full cooking facilities and a comfortable double bed, perfect if you would like to self cater though there are so many great eating and watering holes nearby

We also loved the swimming pool and hot tub on the 7th floor. A free parking space was available for our use though we didn't need it

And the best thing is the price is cheaper than nearby fancy hotels which offer much less for your buck"
3592838,38716409,2015-07-18,9454338,Ewa,"We arrived in Seattle 2 hours later than expected due to accidents on the highway. Tony was very accommodating and ready to welcome us when we finally rolled into town! The apartment was easy to find. It is on the corner of 2nd and Blanchard so approach it from 1st/Blanchard and park - temporarily - anywhere close enough so you can check in and get access to the secure parking and secure building. The apartment is very clean, modern, comfortable, within walking distance to all major attractions, and has everything you'd need. We were a party of 3 and found the sleeping arrangements comfortable with plenty of space to relax in and enjoy the view. Yes, the view is a breathtaking 19th floor vista overlooking the water. If you are looking to cook your own food the apartment has everything you'll need. Coffee, tea, basics are in the apartment so use one/leave one is a great strategy! Alternatively, you are in Seattle and it would be a shame not to enjoy the many restaurants you can find within walking distance. Thank you Tony! We will return!"
3592838,39143967,2015-07-21,11448453,John,"Anton was a great host, and the apartment was excellent. The views really have to be seen in person - they're better even than the photos. Everything was clean, the location was great and the bed comfortable. I would stay here again."
3592838,42244287,2015-08-12,15524210,Robert,"We enthusiastically endorse Anton and his apartment, and would be happy to have the opportunity to use this Airbnb site in the future!
Anton made it easy for us to enter and use the place.  It was well represented - and had all the great features that it advertised.  The 19th floor gave a spectacular view, and being on a high floor wasn't a bother because the two elevators were speedy. The location was good for folks like us who like to wander on foot, which we did. The Market, the space needle, even Chinatown were easily reached by foot.  The place was clean and neat, and arranged so that we could (and did) have guests join us for meals without feeling crowded. A big plus for us was that the bed was comfortable! An extra we hadn't counted on was having a trash/garbage chute handy.  Plenty of dishes, glasses and cookware. All we missed having was a can opener and a cutting board.
Great place - great location - and we will visit again when possible! 

One other thing - the hot tub and heated pool on the 7th floor was a great addition.  We used it daily and had it to ourselves each day during our two week stay!"
3592838,42505490,2015-08-14,15346160,Susan,The unit was as described in the listing. Great views and location!  Just a little hot this mid-August with higher than normal temps without air conditioning.  
3592838,43033120,2015-08-17,14487140,Michael,Neighborhood right in the center of Belltown and the view was perfect. Condo setting gave less of a tourist feel while visiting and a few of our favorite restaurants were in walking distance.  Anton was very communicative throughout the process and a superb host. 
3592838,43374266,2015-08-19,35578524,Jim,The view was great as was the location. Was not impressed at all with the condo cleanliness. Toni seemed distracted when we met him and getting information from him was scant although he was better via text.
3592838,43600122,2015-08-21,9970867,Joanne,"Nice place, just as described. Easy walking to wherever you want to go and to transportation. "
3592838,43751044,2015-08-22,14023136,Anne,Apartment is situated close to the city with great views.  Really a two persons accommodation (we had 3 adults)
3592838,44762286,2015-08-29,11111224,Diane,"I booked this with the understsnding as stated in the ad that it was 1 bedroom and 2 beds and slept 3. Not true as there is only 1 doubke bed and a futon that does not lie flat and a lounge that does not pull out flat.Our adult daughter had to sleep on floor.Not good and this unit is only suitable for 2,so do not beleive the ad.Also their was no electric kettle or toaster,so had to boil water in a saucepan. And no wine glasses to enjoy a wine with tge view,sorry but the onky thing good is the view and location.
"
3592838,45653293,2015-09-05,31307619,Janeè,The place was very nice and we felt welcome.  The apartment was in a good location and the views are magnificent.  
3592838,45935589,2015-09-07,34924040,Jimmy,"Nice clean place with an amazing view of the water and space needle. Host was very informative. Balcony has chairs and a table to hang out. Fast WiFi. We didn't cook, but it looks like the apartment has all the necessary kitchenware."
3592838,46463948,2015-09-11,7409288,Sonia,"Anton was a great host, very attentive, very helpful. The apartment was very neat and tidy and had all the amenities we needed. Fantastic views and a good location being about 10 minutes walk to Pike Market and the other nice shopping areas."
3592838,46869869,2015-09-14,34876541,Melissa,"We really had a great trip, and the views were spectacular. The apartment was pretty comfortable. The check in process was really easy, and Anton was very flexible with check in and check out times. The parking spot was a great bonus, and the garage seemed very secure and safe. I loved the location because it was a five minute walk to Pike's Place Market, and is surrounded by many wonderful restaurants. We walked everywhere and enjoyed our time in Seattle. We would come back."
3592838,47632124,2015-09-21,35004034,Matthew,"Crazy beautiful location, view and apartment!!"
3592838,48163987,2015-09-24,32575695,James,"Awesome location, unbelievable view.  Anton met me at the place, gave me the keys, explained how parking worked quickly and painlessly.  The appliances and furnishings all worked as expected, nothing broken or damaged.

What sets this place apart is the views of the sound.  They are spectacular.  Would definitely rent again if I went back to Seattle."
3592838,48676104,2015-09-28,32008379,Lynda,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and it was wonderful!  Tony was a gracious host who provided everything we needed for a great trip.  He met us as a prearranged time and had everything ready to go.  The apartment was perfect for our needs - spacious and with an outside balcony that gave us a fantastic view of the water and surrounding islands.  We watched a couple of incredible sunsets from it!  The location was perfect for us as well-close to great restaurants and within walking distance of the waterfront, Space Needle and shopping venues.  Overall, a great experience! "
3592838,50159913,2015-10-10,30474013,Anthony,"Stayed for a week early October 2015. Pro's: Anton helped to make our arrival easier by texting me instructions; but, he should've been THERE AT THE UNIT to facilitate our access ! The views from the unit were good. Con's: The small, 1 bedroom condo was FILTHY! It took our entire first day there to clean the slimy cabinets, microwave, sink, washer/dryer, fridge, (visible residue was on all cabinet doors, drawers, and handles) etc.... there was rotting produce left in the fridge along with 7 or 8 other old food items that should've been cleaned/removed; the food residue throughout the fridge had obviously been there for months! One of the things you'd expect from an airbnb place is the ease and convenience of a functional kitchen.....NOT HERE! There was no coffee maker and no toaster; no coffee and bagels for us! We couldn't even cook breakfast due to lack sufficient of utensils and pots and pans! ""Oh well, we'll have to go out for breakfast just as if we had stayed in a hotel; at least hotels have room service"". The toaster we bought was worth the $12, along with the coffee cone and filters ($8), the pillows ($15) and the cleaning supplies (bleach, soap, Lysol, wipes etc... $30). Well worth it considering we were living there for 1 week. Sorry future guests; we DIDN'T leave any of those things behind! We gave all those items to the homeless people directly outside the building (We didn't want Anton to get the credit for a functioning kitchen and nice, new pillows). The floors were completely covered with dirt and cat hairs; we had to mop the floors twice to get the animal hairs down to a manageable level. There is a large music venue DIRECTLY NEXT TO THE BUILDING (The Crocodile Club) with VERY LOUD acts every night! It's OK unless you like to go to sleep before 2:30 AM. The small full size spring mattress was dirty and ancient; it hadn't been rotated for years, if ever; very worn and extremely uncomfortable! Pillows were old and nasty, we bought our own pillows along with all the cleaning supplies we HAD to use! I'm envious of the tenants following us; that place has NEVER been as clean as we left it! The sliding glass door leading out to the balcony didn't have a handle on it; instead there was a crude, strap tied through the holes! It broke our 2nd day there. No screens on the windows; but the bugs were an added source of protein! Only 1 of 4 lights working in the tiny bathroom, but the fire from the candles we had to use wasn't too serious! The washer/dryer all-in-one unit was weird; it took 3 to 4 hours to wash and dry a small load of laundry; stuff smelled better going in than coming out! Please spend the extra $$$ to avoid this uncomfortable, old and unkempt unit from ruining your stay of more than 1 or 2..."
3592838,51885501,2015-10-25,36583771,Rolf,Neighborhood was a bit sketchy but ok. The unit had fabulous views.
3592838,52473110,2015-10-29,10930603,Mark,Anton worked with me on my late arrival into Seattle and greeted me at the property to provide me with the keys to the unit and a quick walk-through.  The unit was easy to find and well situated in downtown Seattle.  The view is great and is represented well in the pictures.  The unit was clean.  The best part is the balcony.  Too bad I didn't have more time to enjoy it.
3592838,53035505,2015-11-03,47262351,Daniel Swank,"Great apt with a great view of Peugeot Sound as well as downtown Seattle. Anton was reliable and professional, very convenient parking situation as well. All pictures are very accurate. Exceptional value here; would have spent twice as much for a similar space at a local hotel. Essentially unbeatable at this price."
3592838,53587510,2015-11-09,3363663,Mitch,"Anton was very responsive, helpful, and communicative.  He got me setup in the apartment quickly - the check-in and check-out process was a breeze.  I had a great time staying in this apartment... it really does have a fantastic view and location.  The space is comfortable and luxurious, especially the kitchen and bathroom.  I'd certainly stay again on another trip to Seattle."
3592838,54013468,2015-11-15,29899773,Jordan,"The place was exactly as described and truly ""Unbeatable Location"". My Wife and I absolutely loved the views, nearby restaurants, bars, and overall proximity to everything. We basically walked everywhere (Pike's, Space Needle, Downtown, ETC) or grabbed an Uber once or twice. Anton was super easy to communicate with and even checked us in late due to our delayed flight in. Overall awesome experience and can't beat it if looking to be right in the middle of everything Seattle has to offer.  "
3592838,55634668,2015-12-03,30222637,Scotland,"Great stay, excellent location and beautiful view. Exactly what you should expect from listing."
3592838,56325587,2015-12-12,3623665,Kyle,"Anton was great, and very helpful, the place was clean, and overall it was a great experience. Would definitely stay here again!"
3592838,56412055,2015-12-13,9052671,Joann,"The apartment was clean and as pictured with awesome views. Location was great and near lots of shopping, sight seeing places, and restaurants (walking distance in Seattle is a plus). I didn't get to meet Anton but we communicated via text and directions were clear and easy to follow on how to get in and out of the apt. The apartment had floor based radiant heat and somehow it just felt a bit too cold for me and I did't know how to fix it (could be operator error here). Just an observation if you have little ones and/or get too cold yourself. Parking on site was a plus, just note that the parking space is small in case you have a big vehicle like me (it fit but it was very tight, i had to climb to the front seat via the trunk of my SUV). Only stay one night but recommend it if you are planning to stay somewhere close to everything in downtown Seattle. "
3592838,56692306,2015-12-16,14330898,Taura,"Let me start by saying this place was awesome!! The views and the photos are accurate, making this place a true gem for the money. I would stay at this place again in a heart beat. It is the perfect location for walking to most destinations. Parking is included and is in a locked parking garage which makes you feel secure. It was wonderful working with Anton. He allowed for easy communication and was very flexible with our check in and out times. It kind of feels like you're borrowing a friends place for the weekend. We didn't see him but once and only had communication when there was a need regarding check in and out times. I struggled on the 4 vs 5 star rating with this review because I LOVED this place; however, there were a few items in the unit requiring maintenance (such as lights and a missing door handle for the balcony). I'm sure he will have  those fixed in no time and the place will return to a 5 star stay!

For those of you who like some (email hidden) husband and I were only staying for 1 night. We really enjoyed the Pike's place market (Matt's was delicious!) be warned, though, several places require a reservation to get a seat as they stay very busy! We also enjoyed the space needle lookout and the Underground Seattle tour (I wish we had more time in this area as there were several nice local odd/in stores). Lastly, my husband really liked dropping in at the Crossfit Gym that's also within walking distance of this unit."
3592838,56794179,2015-12-18,6160275,Jenny,Anton was very helpful and attentive. The apartment and neighborhood are fabulous. I am from Seattle originally and loved staying at Anton's place. The view from the apartment is incredible. Anton was a great host. I would definitely stay here again. 
8389809,47498321,2015-09-19,44614927,Ri,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8389809,53487102,2015-11-09,40232278,Latif,"Ying Ying and Martin are lovely couples and fabulous hosts. They are really welcoming their guests. I really enjoyed staying with them for a month. The room was very quiet and private, and I could sleep well. 
The location is also great. It's my first Airbnb deal and it was great. I highly recommend here."
3334052,18487097,2014-08-27,14778621,Nicole,"Ana and Eric were amazing hosts. They are really nice and also the studio is great. Really modern, very clean and beautiful! We felt at home from the very first moment. Ana prepared fruits, cereal bars, milk, orange juice for us. It is located in a very nice neighborhood with everything you need, bars, cafés, shops and convenience stores. When we go to Seattle again we definitely would stay there again. It's equivalent to a 5* Hotel :-)
Thank you so much Ana :-)
"
3334052,19132387,2014-09-07,939820,Cassie,"It's a very lovely and comfortable place! Very clean too! The location is close to everything you need. They have a helpful binder with local shopping, restaurants, attractions and information about the apartment. Everything you need to get started is there from towels and silverware to a microwave and coffee pot. 

The host Ana and her husband Eric are both very polite and helpful. We would love to go back and stay there for our next vacation."
3334052,19854403,2014-09-19,12927413,Kara,"My stay at this cozy studio was great. Its clean, adorably appointed and had everything I needed for my business trip  to  Seattle.  It even has its own off street parking which is very important to me.  I've stayed in many hotels and I'm tired of being on the road for work away from the comforts of home, staying in the impersonal environment of a large, expensive hotel. This place was comfortable, stylish, very affordable and in an easy to get to location just up from the bustle of the downtown area in a nicely refurbish neighborhood. My host Ana was gracious and helpful and welcoming! It's my new home away from home and I look forward to my next stay. 
 "
3334052,20200495,2014-09-25,12771565,Tony,"Ana's place was fantastic. Spotlessly clean, spacious, with a very comfortable bed and a terrific bathroom. The neighborhood was very good, near shops and restaurants, and there was free available parking. I didn't get a chance to meet Ana but she made me feel very welcome. I would absolutely choose this place again the next time I'm in Seattle. "
3334052,20642788,2014-10-03,5534028,Canh,"Ana was super accommodating and full of knowledge about the Seattle area. She gave me lots of recommendations. The studio itself was small, but I appreciated the amenities (towels, sheets, breakfast bars, French press, microwave and small fridge). She was quick to reply to any concerns or questions I had. Highly recommend this place and Ana!

The area is really cute and near Capitol Hill and Madison Park. There is a bus station (8, 11, 84) about a 5 minute walk away. There's also two grocery stores nearby and lots of restaurants. There is also a binder when you arrive with information about the area, mass transport and things to do in Seattle. A nice touch!"
3334052,21929507,2014-10-26,22761496,Hilary,The private room was awesome! Very clean and cute. Had an awesome weekend!
3334052,22127703,2014-10-30,12321181,Kosala,"This was my first time using Airbnb, and I couldn't have asked for better hosts than Ana and Eric. I lost my luggage in transit, and Eric was kind enough to help me get everything I needed, from toothbrush to new clothes. 
The studio apartment is cozy and very comfortable.  Everything you will ever need is there. And I mean everything. Ana has thought of things that I myself didn't imagine I might need. She even had some snack. 
The location is very convenient. Just a couple of kilometers to downtown, and there are plenty of buses. Or you could just walk, it's not that far. 
There are several gre of restaurants about 100 meters from the house, including French, Spanish, Thai etc, and also a pizza hut. There's a small shop where you can buy soap, toothpaste etc, but you won't have to because Ana has already provided those. 
I really enjoyed my stay here, and there is not doubt that I will be stay at here the next time I'm in Seattle. 
No five-star hotel can hold a candle to this place!"
3334052,22712120,2014-11-12,21305419,Amari,"Hey, Ana was a wonderful host, I highly recommend her spots. Will be returning soon. "
3334052,25243766,2015-01-10,15517596,Katie,"Stayed here for a week while I looked for permanent housing - Although I never met Ana she was very helpful with any questions I had and checked in. The place was very cute and had everything I needed plus some more little amenities I didn't expect! Thanks, Ana!"
3334052,27049272,2015-02-24,24221719,Rogério,"Esse quarto com suíte é ótimo. Apesar de não haver uma cozinha de verdade, existe um frigobar, equipamentos e utensílios suficientes para se ter uma boa estadia. O banheiro é totalmente funcional e apropriado. A cama é confortável, a TV é ótima (importante para mim, que comprei um videogame durante a estadia) e a Ana é simpática e prestativa. Ela nos emprestou o aspirador de pó e cuidava de pequenas gentilezas. O bairro é cheio de vida e dotado de pessoas bastante diversas. Os pontos de ônibus na Madison e na Luther King Jr. são bastante próximos e práticos, podem te levar aos pontos mais movimentados, que geralmente ficam em lugares mais elevados e dão certo trabalho para chegar a pé. Use o transfer e pague apenas uma passagem. A padaria/café Essential é bem interessante e tem boas coisas para oferecer, especialmente os sanduíches. O restaurante espanhol é uma boa ideia também, se você estiver a fim de algo mais elegante. Fui com minha noiva e foi uma estadia bastante aconselhável! :) obrigado, Ana!"
3334052,28648000,2015-03-28,4618780,Ainoa,"The place is perfect, the location is very good in a beautiful and safe neighbourhood and near everything, good public transportation near. The studio is very comfortable and has everything you need to make the most of your stay. I higly recommend it. "

3334052,31707217,2015-05-09,12810694,Sarah,"I stayed almost 2 weeks in the studio and it was perfect! It is nicely decorated, spotless, and feels very new! The bed is also comfortable which is a huge plus!  It is blocks from public transit buses which makes the location convenient and between the bus and uber I did not need a car. I really enjoyed my stay in Seattle and although I never met Ana, she was extremely communicative. I would highly recommend and would stay again. "
3334052,33260082,2015-05-26,3388340,Alison,The place was wonderful!
3334052,34290264,2015-06-07,30375958,Dan,Everything was great - Ana was punctual and professional. Every request or question I had she was able to answer accurately and swiftly. The room was in great condition and also was in an awesome part of town. I really enjoyed my stay there and think it's a phenomenal space in a great city!
3334052,35207021,2015-06-16,30157589,Raman,"This was our first experience on AirBnB. I am going to list some pros and cons about it. 

Pros:
We were able to save a lot of money, Definitely something worth trying if you are on a budget. 
It's a home away from home when travelling.
This is very cute and homey place. Location is everything to us and this place is definitely a key location (close to the beach and had many very cute looking food places that taste awesome). 
Also came with a mini fridge, microwave, and kettle and French press. These were very handy. (We were able to make breakfast such as oat meal, sandwiches for lunch, coffee most days at home and save a buck). "
3334052,35648398,2015-06-21,547167,Daniel,Awesome place. It was a great location both whether you have a car or not. The place was really clean and was a great use of space. Really felt like home while there. Would stay here again for sure. 
3334052,36515323,2015-06-29,25632991,Floriana,"Trovare la casa di Ana è stato semplicissimo, non è difficile da raggiungere. Il quartiere è molto bello, tranquillo e sicuro. Ana è molto gentile e disponibile ad aiutarvi per qualsiasi necessità. La casa è abbastanza piccola, ma per soggiorni brevi va bene, in oltre nonostante non ci sia una vera e propria cucina il microonde e il frigorifero vi permetteranno di pranzare o cenare a casa. La casa è a soli pochi passi dalla fermata dell'autobus che vi permetterà di raggiungere sia Downtown che Seattle centre in pochi minuti. Nelle vicinanze di casa è possibile trovare un supermercato molto fornito (Safeway) e altri negozi per ogni evenienza. 
E' stato un soggiorno molto piacevole, vi auguro lo stesso. "
3334052,36962307,2015-07-03,33446605,Joanna,Great location. Clean and cozy. 
3334052,37649318,2015-07-09,28875996,Charles,"Our stay at Ana's place was exactly what we needed. A quiet place away with only a short bus ride into the city centre. We were surprised at all the amenities that had been left for us, and would definitely stay here again."
3334052,37956234,2015-07-12,11021265,Melissa,"Excellent affordable spot in the lovely Madrona neighborhood. Great restaurants nearby. Convenient to Capital Hill. Anna is a great host. We felt at home and we also had privacy. The studio is colorful and clean with a cute little table outside the french doors. We had everything we needed and more: clothes iron, microwave, mini-fridge, hot water kettle with coffee and tea, wine glasses, plates, huge TV, wifi, dreamy comfy bed and info about Seattle. We enjoyed our stay and would stay here again in a minute. "
3334052,38500644,2015-07-16,34022295,Ellen,"While I was only in Seattle for a few days, I instantly felt at home here. Ana has truly gone the extra mile to create an inviting and comfortable space for her guests. Thanks for a perfect stay!"
3334052,38812652,2015-07-19,26382402,Korri,"We very much enjoyed our stay at Ana's! Information about the apartment itself, as well as the surrounding neighborhood was very clearly laid out and that was super helpful. The apt is just around the corner from a bus route that takes you right into the heart of the city, too."
3334052,39373902,2015-07-23,1845764,Brian & Nate,We loved staying at Ana's lovely space.  It was just perfect for the two of us.  It was incredible clean and located to some of our favorite restaurants in the Madison Valley area of Seattle. It's also an easy bus ride to the heart of Capitol Hill and downtown.  We'd easily choose this spot again!
3334052,39926266,2015-07-27,31694255,Ben,"This was my first time using Airbnb, so I had some apprehensions about logistics and things of that nature when I first reached out to Ana. After spending a few nights in the E Capitol Hill studio, I have to say that all aspects of the experience were fantastic!

Logistics: Right off the bat, Ana was extremely responsive and helpful when confirming our reservation and coordinating check-in. I'm a natural worrier, but she put my mind at ease! Throughout my stay, I felt that Ana was always ready and willing to help if I had any questions.

Studio Apartment: Our apartment was extremely clean and comfortable. It had all of the amenities we needed to make our stay an enjoyable one. Also, the bed was heavenly!

Neighborhood: Nestled between Capitol Hill and Madison Park, the neighborhood felt extremely quaint and safe. There were a few great restaurants just around the corner from us, and we were a short walk from Lake Washington and the Washington Park Arboretum. The hustle and bustle of downtown was also close enough for a long walk or short cab ride.

Overall, I'd highly recommend this space for your next trip to Seattle. Ana was great to work with, and the apartment itself has everything you'll need for a nice, relaxing experience."
3334052,40761738,2015-08-02,5153802,Eric,"First off, we loved it! 

The studio itself is lovely and very comfortable. Despite the 2015 heat wave, we stayed nice and cool.   We'd highly recommend it, and wouldn't hesitate to return the next time we visit Seattle.

The AirBnb map view is totally off by a half mile, so it wasn't quite where we expected it to be, but this turned out to be a happy surprise. It's a great, accessible location, and there is AMAZING food nearby. "
3334052,41731794,2015-08-09,30309035,Eric,"Great private space, perfect for a single or a couple. I enjoyed my stay greatly. If I had any issues the host would immediately correct them. Literally no issues or qualms about my visit. Would rent again. Also the mattress topper was awesome."
3334052,43215760,2015-08-18,29991139,Antonia,"I had a wonderful time at Ana’s studio. It is just the right size for one person, max. for a couple. Ana was there to greet me at arrival – even though I was early – and agreed to let me use the studio earlier than agreed upon. She offered help on different occasions and I felt that she was available for any questions, especially since she lived a floor above. 
The studio is not located in the center of town, but since I like a good walk, I liked the location of the studio. If you are not into walking up and down hills, you have to be aware of the fact that you have to take the bus to go places (the bus stop is 2 minutes walking distance from the studio). The neighborhood seemed nice, quiet and safe. I walked home from downtown on my own on several occasions and never encountered any situations that made me feel unsafe. 
The place is as presented on the pictures (I was hoping for a bigger place, but didn't realize that a studio means bedroom plus bathroom). It was easy and fast to get into contact with Ana. 
Thank you for letting me use your studio, Ana!"
3334052,44520056,2015-08-27,14191559,Valentina,"The convenient capitol hill it's amazing! The location is perfect and the house is confortable clean and nice!
Ana was so kind with us, the first day showed us the nieghborhood and gave us all the necessary indication.
Great stay, great experience!
Highly recommended!"
3334052,45061220,2015-08-31,5301201,Alice & Pierre,"Ana's studio is not only convenient but also charming. Very well located in the nice neighborhood of Capitol Hill, it is very easy to go downtown by bus. The studio is very well equipped and organized and super clean. The communication with Ana was easy and warm. We highly recommend this accommodation."
3334052,45664746,2015-09-05,36233581,Ingrid,"Ana was an spectacular host! It is a small apartment exactly as shown in th pictures but with all the things that we needed for our stay. Ana even let us a guide book for the apartament, neighborhood and Seattle.  She also let us clean towels, a bottle of wine and some cookies. Such a nice and beautiful gesture from Ana!  She promptly answered any of our questions and needs.
Everthing in her apartment was so clean and cozy. Capitol Hill as a neighborhood is a very quiet and charming place with public transportation to downtown Seattle just a short walk distance from the apartament. We couldn't stay the 3 nights because of a family emergency but Ana was so helpful and comprehensive that we have to leave before. We will surely stay with her next time we are back in Seattle and I will recomend her as a host and the appartament with total confidence. Thank you so much, Ana!"
3334052,46128154,2015-09-08,21497968,Kevin,"Very warm and charming stay. Great coffees and teas included with a French press and hot pot, very convenient! Everything you would need while less than a mile to the heart of capital hill. The bed was a little too soft and the shower was kind of small, about three feet by three feet by 6 feet tall, but overall it was still great! "
3334052,47623761,2015-09-21,33226447,Sunhee,Ana was very welcoming and we felt like treasured guests at her studio! The description was very accurate (very clean and cozy) and it exceeded our expectations! 
3334052,48387458,2015-09-26,38048021,Lloyd,"As our first time using airbnb and going to Seattle Ana made our stay amazing. The room was cozy, clean, and very homey. Check in was a breeze with the direction that was given to us especially when we walked in to the studio where we were greeted with wine on the table.   A binder was provided with places to see and places to eat! Check out was nice and simple. We definitely recommend this place.
Cheers ana!"
3334052,49780890,2015-10-06,24829123,Winston,"E Capitol Hill Studio was charming, well decorated, and met our needs while we were visiting our daughter in Seattle.   It was convenient to great neighborhood  restaurants and bus lines to downtown and to light rail from SeaTac.  The welcoming bottle of wine was a very nice touch."
3334052,50750938,2015-10-14,37945591,Taylor,"As a first time Airbnb user and first time visitor to seattle, my expectations were far exceeded. 

My stay at the studio was amazing. My girlfriend and i were welcomed to the room with a bottle of wine and a book full of places to visit and eat. The studio itself is as exactly described and was more than comfortable for 2 people. 

Communication with Ana was a breeze when i had any questions. She reaponded quickly and effectively to every request i had. 

I would HIGHLY recommend reserving a few days or more on your calendar and stay at this location. Thanks to Ana and the wonderful city of Seattle i will definitely be revisiting in the near future."
3334052,51281293,2015-10-19,311386,Audrey,"Everything exceeded expectations. The neighborhood was quiet and charming, and the room was perfect for our needs, just the right size and a quiet oasis to return to after a busy day. Ana was very respectful of our privacy, but was also forthright with any questions or information we needed. I would most definitely stay again, by the end of our time, it did feel like a home away from home. "
3334052,53335550,2015-11-08,43786257,Meaghan,"This was a cozy, comfortable studio in a safe family neighborhood in Madison Valley of Capitol Hill. It was so lovely to come back after a long conference day and relax with a nice glass of wine (which my lovely host left for me!). My mornings were peaceful, the coffee delicious, and the internet reliable (a huge +!). Ana left me some wonderful suggestions for food, and I had an excellent meal delivered from a local Vegan Thai restaurant in the neighborhood. This is a gem of a place, and I have already talked my partner into a romantic getaway at the studio in the near future :) Ana was available for questions, giving prompt answers and making sure I was all set. A really wonderful stay overall."
3334052,54869695,2015-11-25,14578618,Jamie-Lee,"Anna's studio was in a beautiful location and was perfect for a single, couple or two close friends. Ana was very responsive and let us know how to get in prior to the stay. The studio was a wonderful place to rest our heads after exploring the city. "
3334052,55203401,2015-11-29,25583762,Emily,"We loved our stay in Ana's studio! It was small, but perfect for our short stay. About a 10 minute drive to the main attractions downtown and in a very cute neighborhood.  Ana was very accommodating, allowing us to stay later in the day until our flight in the evening. Would recommend this listing! "
3334052,56213272,2015-12-10,5818601,Suzanne,"Had a great visit! The studio is in great condition. Very clean and has everything I needed for my trip. Ana was proactive in making sure I had directions and checked in periodically during my stay. 
Next time I come to Seattle, I will first check to see if this studio is available."
3334052,56538014,2015-12-14,20162447,Alex,"Listing was accurate and while the space is on the smaller side (studio), it is just the right size for anyone visiting the area with plans to spend the majority of their time out and about. I'm not from Seattle but the times I have visited I have stayed in the area Ana's home is located, which is near many places of interest -- including cafes and other neighborhood eateries. Would definitely stay with Ana again."
3334052,57477563,2015-12-26,10950988,Nicole,"Ana was very accessible and and the studio a perfect retreat for the holidays.  The picture needs a little updating but the description of the amenities was accurate.  We were well warned about the ""noise"" whenever water was turned on and the toilet flushed (w/o this warning I would of thought something was wrong with the plumbing:))  Thanks Ana for a great and comfortable stay."
3334052,57963794,2015-12-30,47298653,Grace,"Ana always responded to my messages quickly and the studio is a cute, warm and cozy place! It will comfortably fit two people. I like the layout of the studio, there is a little round table that you can have a lovely breakfast or late night snack while you are watching the big screen TV. The location is good, near public transportation. There is plenty of free street parking as well. Ana has a binder in which there are a lot of suggestions for restaurants and cafes near by. We went to two of them and they are great! Oh, Ana was very sweet to leave us a bottle of white wine and it was tasty! I had a wonderful stay and I would come back if I visit Seattle again! "
2441908,10705169,2014-03-03,12336288,Zach,Great place. Hosts were wonderful. Had everything that we needed.
2441908,11022897,2014-03-17,1344602,Matthew,This cottage is amazing! Kelly has everything for a group or even a couple to stay in Ballard.  The cottage is clean and has all the amenities and a Dart Board! Kelly was a great host and kept in touch the whole way and was very accommodating. We would definitely go back next time we head to Seattle!
2441908,11085844,2014-03-19,12816951,Neema,"Kelly and Bente were wonderful hosts and their lovely cottage in Ballard was the perfect home-away-from-home for our family. The booking process was smooth. From the warm welcome we received, the special treats for us to enjoy, and a great conversation about local places to check out - it made for a great start to our visit.
The cottage had ample space and all the amenities we needed (and more!) and they even brought out extra toys for our young children to play with. The kitchen and bath are well stocked, the space is light-filled, and the flexibility of the sleeping arrangements was very useful. The neighbourhood is lovely and we enjoyed walking to local amenities.
We hope to stay here again when we next visit Seattle."
2441908,11198727,2014-03-24,8264655,Sarah,"We loved staying at Kelly's cottage. It was very clean, comfortable and quiet. Would absolutely stay again. Kelly was great and was so helpful with restaurant recommendations. "
2441908,11618034,2014-04-09,12808588,Hilary,"We had a fantastic 2 week stay here. We are from Seattle and needed a place to stay with our two young kids while we were selling our house. The cottage is in a great neighborhood, in easy walking distance to great restaurants, parks, grocery stores, etc. Moreover, it’s tucked back from the street, so it feels quiet and secluded.

Kelly was a gracious host and the apartment fully met our needs. It is clean, well-appointed, functional, and has some style. There was even a bottle of wine and some snacks waiting for us on arrival.

We’d unequivocally recommend this place to anyone wanting to spend some time in Seattle."
2441908,11755490,2014-04-14,13109032,Catherine,"Cozy Cottage was the perfect gathering place for our family mini-vacation in Seattle.  Our daughter-in-law and son were visiting from Switzerland and commented that it was by far the best AIRBNB they have utilized.  The cottage had all the amenities we needed and could have stayed long-term and been very comfortable.  The area is quiet and the cottage is clean, neat and well stocked.  We will definitely recommend Cozy Cottage to our friends in North Idaho for their visits to Seattle area.  Thanks for a wonderful time!  "
2441908,13410135,2014-05-27,13184092,Vanessa,"The best BNB experience I've had so far! 3 of us stayed here for 4 nights around my graduation. We were greeted with snacks and beverages on arrival. Hosts were very responsive to our needs. The bathroom was well-stocked with toiletries, and the home entertainment was ample, with Netflix and a supply of DVDs, VHS, and books. Both beds were very comfortable. Generally quiet, but the walls are a bit thin - we heard kids playing outside in the mornings. Off-street parking is nice . Located very close to Goodwill and not too far from a grocery store and bus routes. Would definitely recommend."
2441908,14092564,2014-06-11,15636376,Pepi,"We so enjoyed our stay with Kelly and his family.  The little cottage is the perfect setting for relaxing; well appointed and beautifully designed.  I make the trip to Seattle often and it is my plan to stay here again when available.  I would think small family or small group of friends, would appreciate it too. These folks know how to make a weary traveler feel welcome."
2441908,14271028,2014-06-16,10201671,Frances,"Kelly was a perfect host and the cottage actually exceeded our expectations. My husband, daughter and I were in Seattle for the University of Washington graduation. The space was comfortable and, yes, cozy. This was our first Air B and B experience, so we did not know what to expect. We were met with all the amenities you could imagine such as snacks in the kitchen, shampoo in the bathroom, light cancelling shades great privacy and an outdoor dining area. It was a short drive to campus, bur we became familiar with some of the lovely neighborhoods in the area. The zoo and the Nordic History museum are nearby.
we would surely love to stay there again. Kelly is very welcoming and available as needed. Wifi and off street parking are great extras. "
2441908,14432314,2014-06-19,14728674,Robert,"We were so sad to leave the Cozy Cottage; everything about our experience was delightful. The cottage is charming and immaculate and contains everything you will need for your stay. It is located centrally within the Ballard neighborhood, within walking distance of many cafes and restaurants. Kelly and Bente are perfect hosts, knowledgable, helpful and happy to provide suggestions for navigating, dining and enjoying Ballard and Seattle.

We hope to return soon!

The cottage was so perfectly redesigned and you will find yourself very comfortable and relaxed in this warm place. Kelly stocked everything you need in the room and even prepared some welcome snacks (my kids loved that!). 
The community is very serene yet still convenient to grab everything you need. 
I would definitely recommend Kelly's cottage to everyone seeking for an anchor spot to explore Seattle area."
2441908,15748753,2014-07-15,4005050,Kevin,"I can't say enough about how wonderful my stay was at Kelly and Bente's Cozy Ballard Cottage. A true 10 out of 10 experience! As hosts, Kelly and Bente are super friendly, super accommodating and super helpful. 

The cottage itself is superb. In terms of size, it fit my parents, my girlfriend and myself really well. Sleeping us four was no problem. And between the living room and the outdoor space, there was more than enough room to relax and just hang out. It was really nice having a full kitchen, really allowing us to not have to eat out for every meal during our 10-day stay. 

Also, the cottage is super, super clean. 
*(And for those wondering about the presence of a cat on the premises (though it isn't allowed in the cottage), I am highly allergic to cats and not once during my stay did I sneeze or have any sort of allergic reaction). 

The neighborhood seems really safe. This was actually my second time renting an AirBnB in the Ballard neighborhood (I previously rented a place right down the street). In my experience, the neighborhood is highly walkable and at no time have I felt unsafe. 

Which is key because the beauty about staying at the cottage was how walkable (or bikeable...Kelly and Bente have three bicycles for you to use if you want) everything is. There are multiple bus stops nearby, most of them can take you to downtown Seattle or wherever easily. Then there's the downtown Ballard area with all its wonderful shops and restaurants and bars, which are all about a 15 minute walk away. Even though my parents ended up renting a car, you can really get by during your stay at the cottage, whether you're vacationing or in Seattle on business, without renting a car.

Safe, clean, accommodating, staying at Kelly and Bente's Cozy Ballard Cottage was a tremendous experience. I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a lowkey, peaceful place to stay in Seattle while at the same time having convenient access to any and all busier areas in the Seattle area. I would definitely stay here again!"
2441908,15950164,2014-07-19,7636155,Lara,The place was clean and fully stocked. The bed was VERY comfy. Location was only 10 min to downtown. They were GREAT hosts and enjoyed their company.
2441908,16069386,2014-07-21,9236155,Robert,Kelly and Bente are gracious hosts.  The rental is tasteful and comfortable in even the minor details.  An earlier guest mentioned that the window curtains did not provide enough privacy.  That definitely has been remedied; the current curtains give complete privacy.  We will return whenever we can.     
2441908,17221008,2014-08-09,17426527,Don,"We had a lovely stay in the Ballard cottage and the gracious hospitality of Kelly and his wife Bente made it all the better. The cottage was exactly as described: cozy, comfortable, peaceful and nicely furnished with a well equipped kitchen.  We will definitely want to stay again the next time we are visiting Ballard and the Seattle area.
"
2441908,17350165,2014-08-11,2573813,Julia,"We had a lovely stay in the Ballard Cottage! Kelly met us when we arrived and made sure that we had everything we needed for our two night stay. Kelly and his wife really went above and beyond to make us feel at home: they even left local chocolates, cookies, and other little treats waiting for us in the kitchen! Additionally, they both recommended great places for us to eat and hang out in the area. We couldn't have found a more perfect place to call home as we explored Seattle. It was the highlight of our trip and I hope that we have a chance to visit again soon!"
2441908,18228499,2014-08-24,13816750,Jean,"Kelly and family were very gracious. We were given a tour of the cottage amenities and equipment upon arrival. It was a very efficient, orderly and lovely space. The beautiful outside picnic area and gardens were an extra treat. The neighborhood was pleasant and close to Ballard's downtown retail and restaurants. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely choose this cottage again .  Thank you Fernandis!"
2441908,18482100,2014-08-27,15357491,Derek,My wife and two children stayed at this great space for 3 nights. Kelly and Bente were perfect hosts. They gave us all the privacy we needed but were always there if we needed something. The cottage itself was perfect for us. The smaller bedroom was very comfortable for my children and the main bed was very comfortable. The entire space is very well laid out and thoughtfully outfitted. We appreciated that the space was spotlessly clean as well. We wanted for nothing. The area is extremely quiet too. We all slept solidly throughout the nights. Highly recommended! 
2441908,18599876,2014-08-28,19597018,Tracy,Our stay with Kelly was fantastic!  It was a very clean and gorgeous cottage!  Kelly was very friendly and answered all questions we had about the city.  He even brought us local chocolate and plums from their tree.  We recommend starting there 100%!
2441908,19456796,2014-09-13,15684320,Nancy,The description was understated as to how completely comfortable and welcoming this adorable cozy cottage experience actually was.
2441908,19729250,2014-09-17,18588642,Kyle,"Kelly and Bente were great hosts, and the cozy cottage was just perfect.  They've done a fantastic job with the space!  There are tons a great restaurants and spots nearby (10-15 min walking through the peaceful neighborhood).  If you are up for it, we highly recommend walking to Portage Bay Cafe for breakfast (30 min away), then over the Ballard Locks to reach Discovery Park (another 30 min).  Pack a picnic, and take the North Beach trail to the lighthouse for lunch on the beach.  Beautiful.  You can either walk back, or Uber/Lyft/Flywheel onward from there.  What a great city, and Kelly and Bente's cottage is a perfect home base to enjoy it from.  Thanks so much for everything! We'd recommend to anyone.  - The Closes"
2441908,19939624,2014-09-21,7291601,Jean,"Fabulous! Staying for two nights in the yellow cottage was the perfect start to our cross country trip.  It was clean & cozy, with comfortable beds, good pillows and nice amenities.  
Bente & Kelly went above and beyond, bringing us milk, jam, cheese and European style bread (which my German mother & friend said was delicious), and walking with us to a restaurant to make sure we found it. 
If I ever have a chance to return to Seattle, (which I hope I do, it's a great city) the cute yellow cottage is where I will stay! "
2441908,20329840,2014-09-28,13782066,Shannon,Staying at the cottage made our week so much more comfortable than it would have been in a hotel. The cottage was beautifully decorated and thoughtfully designed. We were welcomed by Kelly and Bente as if we were family!!!  We will be staying there every time we visit in  the future!!!!
2441908,20523903,2014-09-30,21267660,Kristen,Kelly was a great host! He was very thorough on all the cottage was appointed with and was available if anything was needed. It was perfect for our girls' weekend.
2441908,20659581,2014-10-03,10331180,Stephanie,"I was in Seattle for work, and the cottage was perfect. Clean, comfy and had all the kitchen supplies I needed, and then some. Kelly was a very accommodating host. The fireplace and bed are the highlights. The fire made the cottage so cozy. "
2441908,20957518,2014-10-08,20907437,Jeffery,"Just arrived home, and although it's always great to return from the road, we both agreed, ""this doesn't feel any different than the cottage"".

That's how great the cottage and our hosts were. As we rediscovered Seattle, we would elect to ""go home"" for lunch or just ""hang out"". I can't imagine NOT staying here as long as the Fernandi's will have us! It was perfect! Thank you!"
2441908,21065416,2014-10-10,22214182,Gina,A very quaint little cottage in a beautiful neighborhood. Kelly and Bente were fabulous hosts. They made us feel so welcome with a flexible check-in and check-out and a delicious bottle of red wine. Loved the cottage so much with all the decor and fire place. Very well designed....they thought of everything! I will most definitely look to stay here again in the future. I had such a wonderful stay here and I would recommend it to anyone over a hotel. Such a positive energy flows through this cozy little yellow love cottage. Great experience that I will hold close for years to come. 
2441908,21360219,2014-10-15,2664855,Aaron,"Place was beautiful, comfortable, perfect for our weekend getaway in Seattle.

Kelly was a great host. The cottage was in immaculate shape, definitely recommend for anyone traveling to Seattle!"
2441908,21459222,2014-10-18,17954203,Tania,Very comfortable well equipped cottage with friendly and thoughtful hosts. The cottage is conveniently located and was just right in terms of size for the two of us.
2441908,21624212,2014-10-20,22264541,Tim,"We had a very nice time at this Ballard Cottage.  Way better and much more personal than a regular hotel.  The room was clean, comfortable and had everything you need for a nice weekend.  Even worked really well with a small baby.  The Cottage is in a nice quite neighborhood and had off street parking which is really nice since street parking in Ballard is hard to come by.  Finally the host family was kind, available, and flexible.  Overall a wonderful experience."
2441908,21849120,2014-10-25,15323103,Kristine,"Kelly and Bente (sp?) made us feel very welcome.  We were given a thorough tour and offered the use of their driveway, which is nice in Seattle.  They have the house well-stocked with coffee and have good appliances (coffee maker!).  The bathroom is clean and the linens are nice and fluffy.  "
2441908,21974761,2014-10-27,10237220,Benjamin,"The little guest house is perfect, with all the touches that make it special.  it has a small kitchen, washer & dryer, wifi, a fireplace, a comfortable bed.  it is ideal for 2-3 people.  The host (Kelly) even brought us soy creamer and half&half for our coffee.  absolutely recommend."
2441908,22112835,2014-10-30,15636376,Pepi,"Well appointed, comfy and private, this little oasis in Ballard has provided a home away from home for my son and me for the second time and I'm sure will again.  "
2441908,22221193,2014-11-01,4766360,Sarah,We loved this spot in Ballard. Kelly & his wife have really thought of every detail. We stayed with our two year old and the sleeping arrangements were perfect. We would highly recommend this place. 
2441908,22582797,2014-11-10,21087936,Sara,"Kelly was there to meet us upon arrival to show us around and make sure we had everything we needed.  As coffee drinkers, we were pleased to have provided coffee and Kelly made sure we had dairy and non dairy options to add.  Kelly and his wife had great recommendations for restaurants in the neighborhood, most of which we tried and loved.  The space was clean, very cozy, especially with the gas fireplace, and the bed was extremely comfortable! I also thought it was very nice that we got use the driveway.  We loved staying in Ballard and meeting Kelly and his family.  We felt right at home, and hope to make it back!"
2441908,22762797,2014-11-14,18757944,Nicole,This is a very cute and clean cottage. Kelly was a great host and thought of the little details to make us feel welcome and comfortable. The cottage was about a 15 minute walk to downtown Ballard which was great! Highly recommend for someone who wants to stay in a private and quiet area. 
2441908,22982222,2014-11-19,22243478,Curt,"Kelly was an amazing host!  He was walking out the door to greet us as soon as we pulled up.  The cottage was quaint and comfortable, miles better than a hotel room.  It had been well stocked with food items, GREAT coffee, toiletries, ect.  Kelly was always available if we had a question, and recommended some amazing restaurants in the area.  The neighborhood was beautiful, and the cottage was only three blocks from the friend I was visiting.  We only met his wife once, briefly, but she was very nice.  I would absolutely stay again!"
2441908,23163899,2014-11-24,732147,Lisa,"The cottage was a wonderful place to stay.  More than that, Kelly was a wonderful host.  He was very accommodating to our last-minute travel changes and even refunded us for the night we were unable to make it to the cottage.  Such a gracious host!  I wish I could give him and the cottage extra stars.

"
2441908,23946955,2014-12-15,22970019,Kyle,Kelly was great! House was clean and he offered us great directions and recommendations on getting around the city. House is close to several bus lines leading directly into downtown Seattle and downtown Ballard. 
2441908,24467735,2014-12-29,8915204,Kelly,"Thank you Kelly! 

This was a wonderful cottage and was very warm despite the cold of a Seattle winter. Lots of room for a small group, great amenities, and wonderful hosts! I will definitely stay here again in future visits to the Seattle area."
2441908,24629726,2014-12-31,1998433,Melinda,"We made a last minute reservation and were warmly greeted and welcomed, despite the fact that another guest left that morning. The  cottage was so perfectly laid out and my family of 4 (two teens with mom and dad) marveled continuously of how comfortable and perfect it all was. The kitchen was stocked with every utensil we needed to cook our meals, there were movies and books to fit all our interests, a quaint safe neighborhood and Kelly and Benta gave us the feeling we could ask for whatever help we needed. We could not have been happier. Also, great things nearby - a fabulous Indian restaurant in town, a climbing gym for the children, bike trails, parks and a fabulous fish ladder and locks  and much more. "
2441908,24894747,2015-01-03,4010609,Jennie,Cozy Ballard Cottage is super sweet and both Kelly and Bente are awesome folks. I will surely rent this place again and highly recommend it! The dart board and family friendly movie selection in the smaller room made my 10 year old very happy as well. 
2441908,30658235,2015-04-26,20849763,Rachel,"Kelly and Bente were wonderful hosts! My friend and I are third year physical therapy students, and we stayed in the cottage for a four month time period during our final clinical rotations. The place was in a great location to the market, downtown Ballard, and a short jog to Green Lake! Bente and Kelly were extremely generous with suggestions and offering amenities for the cottage. They were great people to get to know, and the cottage had everything we needed for spending four months in Seattle! We loved our time here!"
2441908,31066863,2015-05-01,10331180,Stephanie,"This is my second time staying at the Cozy Ballard Cottage, and it was just as wonderful as the first.  Kelly and family are wonderful hosts.  The location is excellent and the cottage was clean, comfy and had everything I needed.  "
2441908,32499320,2015-05-19,27925460,Jessica,Kelly and Bente were very friendly and welcoming hosts! We stayed for 10 nights and it was an excellent experience. The location is wonderful with many great restaurants nearby and things to do. The cottage has everything you could possibly need and it is an extremely well thought out space. The beds were very comfortable; it is just a cozy little place to call home while on vacation. We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely return! 
2441908,33999895,2015-06-03,31690561,Debra,"This was our first time to book through Airbnb, the Fernandi family and their cottage exceeded all our expectations.  They could not have been better host.  They greeted us when we arrived, suggested a fabulous restaurant for our first dinner in Seattle and provided directions to a great local market.   Best of all they graciously gave-up their driveway for us...if you've ever been to Seattle you know what a luxury a driveway is.  

The cottage was bigger than we thought, it was adorable, had super comfortable beds and linens and was spotlessly clean!  We were so glad we choose the Ballard neighborhood as it was easy to get around and close to everything we wanted to do.

We highly recommend the Cozy Ballard Cottage!  Thank you Fernandi family for your hospitality.  "
2441908,34526128,2015-06-09,17873184,Martha,"I felt very welcome and Kelly met me with a smile and welcome.
He walked me though and explained where things were.
If I had any questions just call,text or knock on the door.
I felt very safe and secure as I was alone. The neighborhood was quiet and friendly.
There kitchen was well stocked and very clean. The entire place was super clean and fresh."
2441908,34728150,2015-06-11,10212263,Amy,"The Ballard cottage was perfect. Kelly and Bente were the sweetest, most welcoming hosts. There were four of us and we all had a bed and space to move around. The love that was poured into creating this bnb was completely apparent. Overall, this was an amazing experience. We fell in love with Seattle and will be back for more. "
2441908,35451466,2015-06-19,28817608,Ashley,"We loved the house as well as our hosts!  We were worried because we had never used AirB&B before. It was a great experience. If we go back to the area, we will def stay here again. "
2441908,36356267,2015-06-28,1235242,Rebecca,"Kelly and Bente are experienced and wonderful hosts...We were at the cottage for a week...(single grandmother with two teenage boys) and it was the perfect space and location.  The cottage was as described and pictured...lovely garden setting in residential neighborhood yet close to public transportation as we did not rent a car. We were able to enjoy privacy in the cottage and sleeping arrangements were private for the three of us.  Every detail was well thought through or the cottage and was very clean, attractive, and comfortable.  We even had help with finding a skateboard shop, tourist suggestions, etc.  We are most appreciative and would love to come back another time."
2441908,37029040,2015-07-04,23792540,Jonathan,"The Cozy Ballard Cottage was awesome and perfect for my family of four.  Even though the host was away during our stay, his hospitality and resourcefulness was most evident, both in the binder for the cottage and in our correspondence.  The listing provided was accurate.  As a neighborhood, Ballard was just as welcoming as our host.  We can certainly understand how our hosts call Ballard home. "
2441908,37439073,2015-07-07,18956745,Mona,"We liked Kellys place very much. Quiet, very clean and cosy. Kelly was very helpful with everything. Thanks a lot, Kelly. "
2441908,37646433,2015-07-09,27074775,Laura,"Kelly's cottage is adorable and an incredibly efficient use of space.  It is just as described, and our family of 4 was very happy there.  The kids loved the dart board.  We happened to be staying in the cottage during a heat wave, and the many windows made it easy to stay cool.  We appreciated and used the rotating fan.

Kelly left some yummy snacks for us and a binder full of information.  Our son read through it and saw a chocolate factory near by.  We went on a fascinating tour and ate some delicious chocolate.  :)  Thank you of the idea, Kelly, and thank you for letting us stay in your cottage!"
2441908,38091769,2015-07-13,21819880,Catherine And Nigel,"Great Seattle vacation in excellent accommodation! Really appreciated Kelly's prompt, friendly & helpful communication. The cottage was immaculately clean, is tastefully decorated, and was equipped with everything you require (and more!) The location was great and we had fun exploring the local attractions by foot and by bike. Getting a bus nearby was also no problem. Thank you!"
2441908,39729903,2015-07-26,28071535,Michelle,"The cottage was exactly what we were looking for. It was clean, cozy, and perfectly located. I cannot imagine staying anywhere else if we are ever in Seattle again."
2441908,40088541,2015-07-28,11160204,Jen,"Wonderful little house for our family's two night stay in Seattle.  They have thought of everything!  Our family of five (kids age 20, 16 and 12) were comfortable in the cozy cottage - beds were great, well stocked kitchen and super efficient use of space.  We arrived a little early (oops)  but Kelly was quick to assure us it was fine and we headed out to explore Seattle while housekeeping was done.  The guest manual was very helpful and we truly enjoyed our stay.  Make sure you hit The Skillet Diner when you're in Ballard - one of the best breakfasts we've ever had.  "
2441908,41060347,2015-08-04,28874090,Sylvia,"Lovely little cottage with everything you need. Clean and very comfortable queen size bed.  We had 3 kids with us, and while it was small for 5 it worked.  The neighborhood is really nice.  Very quiet.  Walking distance to restaurants, grocery store and 20 minutes from downtown.  I would recommend this to everyone!"
2441908,42377331,2015-08-13,29754452,Doug,"Just returned from a wonderful trip to Seattle's delightful Ballard neighborhood. We chose Kelly & Bente's cozy & comfortable cottage as it is a fully detached unit less than two blocks from our son & daughter-in-law's home. What a jewel! It was a perfect retreat. Quiet, well maintained, and containing all the amenities of home. We were originally concerned about the lack of air conditioning but even with daytime highs in the 80s, we were cool & comfortable at night. The cottage is within easy walking distance to pubs, restaurants, delis, parks, etc.  &  close to the eclectic historic downtown Ballard retail district. Downtown Seattle is an easy & inexpensive Uber ride away.  Kelly & Bente are great hosts who succeed in making their guests feel appreciated and truly welcome in their home. We look forward to returning to their cottage next spring. "
2441908,42852423,2015-08-16,22766720,Shelli,Very welcoming host!
2441908,43221692,2015-08-18,32363465,Stacy And Brent,"Kelly and Bente were such gracious, fun loving hosts.  The cozy cottage they built fit our needs perfectly.  The cottage's close proximity to the Ballard Locks, Discovery Park, and our wedding party's home and venues made our trip that much more convenient and special.

Kelly and Bente it was a pleasure to meet you.  Thank you so much.

Brent and Stacy"
2441908,43895342,2015-08-23,5886415,Kathleen,Kelly and his family were so friendly and helpful.  We felt welcome and thoroughly enjoyed the peacefulness of our stay.
2441908,45385961,2015-09-02,36942854,Susan,"The cottage was as described. The first morning we were there Bente brought us a bowl of fresh plums from their tree! Delicious!!

Neighborhood was fine. Nice quiet nights....weren't there much during the day!"
2441908,45919035,2015-09-07,17214741,Linda,"This stay exceeded our expectations. We arrived late on a Thursday night (12:30), and Kelly met us at the door to the cottage to show us around, which wasn't necessary but very much appreciated. The cottage is located in an area with which my family is very familiar so we were close to friends and family, a plethora of restaurants and activities and much more. It was mostly cold and wet during our trip, but that made the cottage even more cozy with its working gas fireplace, super comfortable mattresses and bedding, and well-stocked kitchen area. We actually looked forward to returning to ""home"" every day and found it to be incredibly relaxing, especially in light of the less-than-stellar weather. My family of four had plenty of room, and there was enough storage for us to actually put our things away and to feel like we were home. I highly recommend this cottage!"
2441908,46279299,2015-09-09,1670797,Jonathan,"Great space and exactly as described!  This was the last stop on our trip to Seattle/Vancouver and was a wonderful place to stay.  Everything looks well maintained and good quality (which has not always been the case for many of the places I've stayed). Kelly and her husband made the whole process very easy and checked in on us a few times to make sure we were comfortable.  Highly recommended!  
One thing to note, it would be best for people to have a car if you stay here..though theoretically things are in walking distance, a car will make it a lot easier to get to some of the fun places in Ballard.  "
2441908,47459691,2015-09-19,29133118,Jacqueline,"The cottage was such a warm welcoming place, and Kelley and his family made us feel so welcomed. "
2441908,50631908,2015-10-13,8670591,Sylvia,"Perfect for our family of 4. We didn't get too much time to enjoy the cottage, but sleeping there was very comfortable for us and two school aged kids. We did find we were in easy driving distance for a Sunday morning run around Green Lake and also very close to the great restaurants, shopping and farmers' market in Ballard. House was very clean and had everything we needed. Kids loved that there were house slippers like we have at home and a little welcome basket of snacks and drinks. Husband liked the fireplace : ). Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
2441908,51439545,2015-10-20,41296773,Micaela,"The Cozy Ballard Cottage exceeded my expectations.  Check in was very easy, the place was so inviting and welcoming.  Kelly and Bente have done a great job at making it a private, welcoming, and cozy cottage - even leaving some welcome snacks!  Such a nice touch!  Bente was so welcoming and they offer great resources in person and in the cottage to help navigate Ballard and Seattle!  Ballard is amazing!  Such a great neighborhood with so many amazing place to explore around every corner.  We didn't want to leave!  I wish we had more time to spend with Bente (Kelly was out of town unfortunately).  I hope to come out and visit again and will definitely stay here if available!  A plus - the bed was probably the most comfortable I have ever slept on!  "
2441908,52089240,2015-10-26,20766395,Greg,My wife and I loved the Cozy Ballard Cottage. A great weekend retreat in a very quiet neighborhood that's within easy walking distance to a wide diversity of eating and drinking establishments. Kelly was very welcoming and the accommodations were exactly as advertised. All the comforts of home in a very compact and private setting. We'll be back!
2441908,54284432,2015-11-17,4835378,Jennifer,"The cottage was just perfect for my trip to visit my brother and new nephew in Ballard. Everything was well-appointed and *very* comfortable, and just as lovely as the photos show. If you have any free time at the cottage, there was a nice little selection of movies to watch, as well as games for adults and kiddos. It was nice to curl up in front of the fireplace at night and take in a little movie time!

Kelly and his wife were both extremely friendly and welcoming. Kelly showed me around the cottage when I first arrived, which was very helpful.

Ballard itself was an amazing neighborhood. My family and I walked to beautiful Sunset Hill park, as well as the Ballard Farmers Market. I loved what a vibrant, eclectic and cool neighborhood this was!"

It was super clean and comfortable.  My granddaughter loved the cat that greeted us when we would arrive home.  Kelly and Bente were warm and approachable.  We loved everything about our stay!  Thanks Kelly, Bente & Echo for your hospitality!"

2441908,57764804,2015-12-29,46499134,Kelly,"Kelly was prompt in responding before our arrival, and greeted us warmly when we got there. The cottage is just as described, well furnished and stocked with all the kitchen essentials you'd expect, plus many extras. Bente and Kelly were great hosts, easily accessible for questions or help.

5308875,38318525,2015-07-14,17436418,Michael,Clint was very responsive and provided clear directions. The place was as described and in a fantastic location. Really loved the terrace upstairs with a gorgeous view of downtown Seattle.  The bed was extremely comfortable and the place was impeccably clean.  Couldn't be better for business travel.

5308875,40958897,2015-08-03,10507227,Stephen,"I had a great experience at Clint's place in Seattle! In addition to Clint being extremely accommodating to my travel schedule, his condo was fantastic. The place was spotless when I arrived, the shower was great, and the kitchen has updated appliances that makes it easy to cook should you want to! It is perfect for a single person or couple who are looking for a cozy place to relax and unwind. 

Clint was great, his place was great, and the neighborhood was quiet but still a short walk into the downtown. 5 stars across the board."
5308875,41972786,2015-08-10,36569463,Matt,"Clint was a great host -- super responsive and even left a nice little gift waiting there for me.  It was clean, quiet, and in a nice neighborhood.   It was my first time using Airbnb and it was totally painless and awesome."
5308875,46735950,2015-09-13,39755205,Sean,The condo is in a good location and worked out very well for a long stay. The host was helpful with local recommendations and accommodating to our needs. Would definitely recommend this rental.
5308875,47719048,2015-09-21,38490356,James,Clint was very communicative and helpful during the entire process. He left detailed instructions for check-in/out. The condo was exactly as described and also clean and well-kept. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend enthusiastically.
5308875,48346662,2015-09-25,1450950,Rob,Clint was extremely responsive and helpful. The place is beautiful and located very conveniently close to my work (West Lake Union). I'd stay again!
5308875,48593719,2015-09-27,18003584,Dan,Listing was accurate! Place did the job. Very quiet neighborhood. No issues whatsoever.
5308875,48927615,2015-09-29,43792736,Charles,"Neighborhood was great, super quiet and low key. It has easy access to nearby attractions and parking within 2 blocks was possible with minimal hassle.

The condo itself was very clean, simple, and comfortable. Clint gave us great arrival instructions to ensure that everything went smoothly. We were able to stock the fridge with a couple of days worth of snacks and drinks. The bathroom was well stocked with plenty of toilet paper and liquid shampoo/shower gel dispensers in the tub. Towels were clean and fresh. The bed was very comfortable and both my wife and I slept very well."
5308875,49830643,2015-10-06,43777214,Vivian,"The condo is quite clean, simple and cozy, with all settings the same as described, especially the bed is very very comfortable. Neighborhood is quite beautiful and quiet, while it is also near the attractions like Kerry Park, Lake Union, Space Needle...however, the condo is located along some slopes, so it will be a bit difficult to climp up with luggage, better if driving cause packing is easy work along the street nearby. Clint is very helpful that he gave me detailed instructions before arrival to make things easier, and he also left me a bottle of wine as gift. This is my first experience in Airbnb and it is wonderful. I will definitely recommend this condo."
5308875,50481863,2015-10-12,21809376,Ed,"Very nice, quiet and safe neighbourhood.  Walking distance to all kinds of sites. Condo was very clean and had all of the essentials.  Our son lives just down the street so it was very convenient for us.  "
5308875,51340761,2015-10-19,16930627,New,Place was exactly as described with a great view of the city day and night street parking was a bit of a challenge if you decide to rent a car
5308875,52250841,2015-10-27,25282641,Sharon,"While I didn't meet Clint during my trip, he was available via email and very helpful. The place was very cozy and the perfect location. The location was perfect, it was close to Pikes Place, the space needle, and so many great restaurants. Would definitely stay there again!"
5308875,54527946,2015-11-21,44195665,Hilmar,Enjoyed my stay. View of Seattle skyline at night was wonderful. Clint was very responsive and accommodating. 
6358605,35013556,2015-06-14,8269352,Michelle,"Sarah's place was great! Her roommates were both really friendly, and the neighborhood was very quaint. I wish I could've stayed longer! "
6358605,35252731,2015-06-16,26554034,Ally,My brother and sister in law enjoyed the stay very much. It is very clean and neat. 
6358605,36492077,2015-06-28,34882531,Brett,"This place was great. I was my back to North Carolina on a cross country trip. I only had one night in Seattle. The location was great. The host was laid back, friendly , and welcoming. We even took the bus downtown together. She walked around with me giving me a quick tour of bars and restaurants . We split up and I went off to explore on my own. I really appreciated the kindness. Cool house, great room, and rad host. ️️️️️ five stars ! "
6358605,36803265,2015-07-01,35074417,Sil,"Todo genial, nos ayudaron en todo momento. La localización inmejorable. Lo recomiendo totalmente."
6358605,46845727,2015-09-13,21106712,Marlena,"The room was very lovely and as described. It is one room in a larger apartment within a nice house. The neighborhood is pleasant and quiet, with good views and restaurants and a lake nearby. Sarah was very responsive via email, and even though she wasn't there when we were there, we had no problems getting in and out, and her roommates were very friendly and helpful. "
6358605,47998807,2015-09-22,22956065,Lauren,"Sarah was awesome! She was super communicative about directions, where to get the key, and places in the area to check out. Her roommates were also super helpful. The place was clean and inviting, no problems at all!"
1901706,14705262,2014-06-24,16258576,Annie,"Nice apartment, great value for the location! No complaints. 

Two points, good to know before you go: Capitol Hill is a fairly steep incline all the way from the lightrail station (recommend taking a taxi from the airport, or a bus from the lightrail!) and they provide economy sized Dove shampoo, conditioner, soap and lotion (no need to bring your own!). 

Thank you Johnny and Christine."
1901706,17453629,2014-08-12,17738213,Marci,"St. John's was a great place to stay in Seattle. The location was great - walkable to Pike Place but in the fun neighborhood of Capitol Hill. It got a little loud around 1 AM when the bar across the street closed for the night, but it wasn't too bad. The room was clean and comfortable, and Christine made checking in and out very easy. Highly recommended!"
1901706,18414131,2014-08-26,17861290,Nienke,"I have very much enjoyed the apartement - it's like a mini house, everything is there despit it being only one room, (plus annex kitchen and bathroom). Easy walking distance to town - supermarket around the corner. 
The only downside was the club across the street - it got very noicy on friday and saturday night. Otherwise - a great place to stay.
"
1901706,18802190,2014-09-01,13579190,Grace,"Great location - super convenient to the convention center, Pike's Place, as well as all the other eateries in Capitol Hill.  QFC (24 hr grocery store) is literally right around the corner.  Victrola (great coffee shop) is down the street.  Clean space, has all the essentials, and I particularly appreciated the A/C unit as it does get hot and stuffy  on the 3rd floor.  Lots of open plugs for anyone who has many electronics to charge.  Tons of hangers/hanging space for pack rats.  Free and fast wifi.  Quick feedback from host when questions needed to be answered.  Thanks for making my Seattle stay straight-forward and easy!  Looking forward to my next trip already!"
1901706,18994373,2014-09-04,1588020,James,"This is pretty much all you can ask for out of a host and place to stay. The place has charm, and that's not a code-word ""be prepared to sacrifice"". The unit and building has all the necessary amenities to make your stay a breeze. 

Christine, Johnny and the rest of the team were super nice and communication was timely and on message throughout everything. A personal favorite of mine was the guest handbook, with plenty of neighborhood information, favorite places, etc. While we all have Yelp on our phones, its a nice personal touch to see from a host. 

The location is top-notch on a good drag for all your dinning, drinking and errand needs. While Capitol Hill can be a hike up from downtown because of the hills, (which all of Seattle has), getting public transit in and out of the neighborhood is a breeze and there's a handful of connections nearby. "
1901706,19971543,2014-09-21,6898830,Bobby,"Christine and her colleague Johnny were super nice and responded to our questions prior to our stay super quickly.  We arrived late on our check-in date and it wasn't a problem as arrangements were made for us to pick up a key.

There are so many reasons why my wife and I loved staying at the apartment.  The location was superb; there are tons of awesome restaurants and bars in walking distance, a supermarket right around the corner, and overall pretty easy to get to the major sites by foot or by uber.  We were actually in town to help my wife's cousin move into the dorms at Seattle U and it was so easy to walk to and from campus.  Although the apartment itself is a little older, the room is clean and very solid.  No squeaky  floors when you walked around, the bed sheets were clean, and the towels provided were clean, thick and fluffy.  Free and fast wifi, lots of clothes hangers in the closet, and lots of open plugs to charge my electronics.  Just overall a perfect place for us.

The one thing I do need to be fair about mentioning to future guests is that there is a bar directly across the street and it can get rowdy late at night.  We're heavy sleepers and used to city noise so it really didn't bother us at all but I can see how it could bother some.  

Overall a great experience and I will definitely be looking for this apartment again when we come back to Seattle!"
1901706,22176935,2014-11-01,8202158,Steve,"My (email hidden)hn's Apartment was a little mixed. On one hand, the accommodations are some of the best I've experienced (and this is the eighth or ninth AirBnB I've stayed in this year). There's great water pressure in the shower, the kitchen is stocked with everything you might need. The bed is super comfortable and the cable TV is a treasure that I wish I could have at all my AirBnB's. The building itself is in great shape and the laundry is just a floor below you. So, you can't beat the convenience. 

On the other hand, I wouldn't recommend this particular listing for any light sleepers. During the warmer months, Pike St. is very noisy, especially with the sports bar right across the street. They tend to play very loud music when it's warm enough to open their patio. For that reason, if you're a light sleeper, I'd recommend renting one of the rooms not facing the street. 

All in all this is a great location (noise aside) and I'd recommend it to others in a heartbeat. "
1901706,34235373,2015-06-06,11105579,Tammy,"I lived in San Francisco and NYC before moving back to the suburbs and loved every moment of it.  Coming to St John's was the perfect little getaway and made me miss my city life. I came here to attend a meeting at the convention center and this was a perfect location. It was close to food, some shopping, and coffee and was pretty safe to walk around. I picked up the keys (email hidden) because I arrived late and was greeted by Johnny the next day. 

The noise as everyone else has stated becomes an issue if you want to sleep. Otherwise,  its somewhat soothing when you've lived in and enjoyed the city.  Plus, it's easily combated with earplugs. 

The apartment was quaint and cozy, you can cook if you want to, and some shower supplies ( soap and towels) were made available.  There's a grocery store right up the block if you need anything. 

You've got a functioning air conditioner, wifi, cable and a comfortable bed. My back is usually picky about beds and I woke up pain free. 

Thanks for the personal touches in the apartment! 

I definitely recommend and would totally look into this bldg again when I come back."
1901706,35495910,2015-06-19,2195681,Alison,"St. John's #307 was an ideal spot for me to stay during a recent business trip to Seattle.  Everything in the apartment was fresh and clean, and the place was well-stocked with everything I needed for a comfortable visit.  My late-night arrival was easily accommodated, and Christine and Johnny (building manager) were both great.  In addition, the neighborhood is vibrant and offers plenty of options for food and entertainment.  I would highly recommend this building and apartment and hope to stay there again!"
1901706,35830777,2015-06-22,8836504,David,"(email hidden)hn's Apartments was wonderful. Exactly as advertised. My wife and I did not get to meet Christine in person but she was very responsive to any questions I had leading up to our stay. When we arrived, the building manager, Johnny (also a fellow Chicagoan), was extremely nice, allowed us to drop our bags off a little bit before check-in, and got the room in a clean and orderly condition by check-in time. The location is amazing! I have zero complaints and would certainly recommend anyone consider this listing for their stay in Seattle."
1901706,38548490,2015-07-16,22101363,Christyl,"The studio was charming and a lovely hideaway when we needed the rest. The location is absolutely perfect, and we walked in all directions towards various restaurants, shops, and sights. Very easy to check in, even when our relatives held us back over an hour from our promised check in time! Christine was so friendly and helpful. Some others have noted sounds from the bar across the street at night. At least in the summertime, those sounds were absolutely inaudible due to the soothing white noise of the window AC, which we really appreciated. Great stay- would recommend to anyone looking for the Capitol Hill Seattle experience!  "
1901706,40789497,2015-08-02,5086945,Bea,"Had a fantastic stay in this adorable apartment in the hub of Seattle. The apartment is clean and has all the amenities perfect for two (three max) people. It was our first time in Seattle, and the apartment is right in the heart of Capitol Hill which gave us access to a bevy of amazing restaurants, bars, and of course coffee shops (in fact the Starbucks flagship is just a few blocks away). It was also convenient walking distance from downtown (Seattle art museum, Pike Place, Sculpture Park etc.) and a beautiful park nearby with a lake. CapHill definitely has a lively nighttime vibe, but once I was back in the apartment I did not notice any loud noises. I didn't have a chance to interact with the hosts since my check-in was late, but they left a helpful list of recommendations and instructions. I would definitely recommend anyone looking for a short to longterm stay in Seattle to look into this building."
1901706,45960193,2015-09-07,16666292,Maddi,"This was a great place to stay.  The apartment was just as described.  It was clean and in a great location.  We were able to walk to everything, including Pike Place Market and even the Space Needle (little over a mile away).  It does get loud at night during the weekends so if you're a light sleeper that might be an issue for you.  Personally the noise didn't bother me.  There was a sleep machine next to the bed that put me right to sleep each night.  If you get to meet St. Johnny he's awesome!"
1901706,48411066,2015-09-26,13920048,Katie,"Christine and the St. John's apt were both wonderful. For our first trip to Seattle, this was the perfect location/apt and Christine made it very easy to pick up the keys and communicate with her. Even providing her mobile phone in case we had questions, it was incredibly helpful to know she was there to help with whatever needed.  

The apt was very clean and the bed was comfortable with great pillows. We were walking distance to everything, Pike Place Market, The Waterfront and a lot of great restaurants and bars. 

It was a great stay and would highly recommend for a couple people traveling."
1901706,48900609,2015-09-29,28459008,Nyree,"Had a great time staying here and visiting Seattle! Christine was quick to respond in order to set up the reservation, and even made arrangements for us to pick up keys since we were getting in later than usual. The neighborhood has great food and stores in every direction, and it's easy to get to downtown. Can't wait to come back!"
8117705,52246385,2015-10-27,21257720,Will,"Brooks' place was great! Its location is very central, making it easy to walk or ride public transit anywhere in the city. Her apartment is very warm and inviting, and included all amenities listed on her page.  Brooks was very good at getting in touch with me right away when I reached out to her. Would definitely come back and stay again. Thanks again, Brooks!"

Everything was just as described and check-in was very easy - all in all a great stay in Seattle.  Thanks Brian!
8082659,50490058,2015-10-12,43811177,Ian,"This apartment met my expectations.  The apartment is about a block from the E bus line which goes downtown, and 3rd Ave two blocks away has routes to everywhere else in town.  Car2Go vehicles were plentiful in the area as well.

The neighborhood had a small grocery store about 2 minutes away with everything I needed, and there were some affordable restaurants around the corner.  I didn't spent much time in the neighborhood itself so I can't comment on nightlife etc."
8082659,50877800,2015-10-15,23196381,Paul,"Great place - very central to Seattle Center, etc. Brian was very easy to work with. Hope to be back soon!"

8082659,54781506,2015-11-23,20098388,Adam,"Brian's place was great. Very central, walking distance from everywhere. Good place to stay while in Seattle. Brian could have given us a bit more information on logistics of staying there ahead of time (ei. arrival, keys, heating, building quirks etc. ), but it all worked out just fine! He was super helpful, and we would stay again!"

1225820,26160719,2015-02-05,26181968,Elaine,"I was pleased to find the listing on Airbnb very close to my son's home in West Seattle. This is my first time using the site after a friend recommended it. There are few hotels in the area, and the space, privacy, and comfort made this stay so much better than in a hotel.
Everything is newly updated, from towels to appliances. The charm of an older home has been retained and improved--wonderful, soothing colors and interesting Northwest art. It's very private with a separate entrance and little sound from the street. I only saw Chelsea (and Charlie the dog) when I knocked on their door. Getting the key was easy with the lockbox and frequent texts and e-mails. They were gracious in letting me host my granddaughter, though my reservation was for one.
I will definitely stay there again when I'm in Seattle."

The place was well decorated and appointed with everything we needed. We were able to cook several meals and really enjoyed all the nice touches (fresh flowers, extra blankets and towels, a hair dryer). The location was ideal for exploring nearby Schmitz park and Alki beach, and Chelsea gave us lots of great suggestions about where to eat and spend our time. We would definitely stay here again!"

What a treat to spend a long weekend in your cozy, beautiful home.  It was quiet, comfortable and the views of the Puget Sound was gorgeous!  The bed was absolutely heaven and love the sound system!

All rooms were  very clean, the bed was very comfortable and the apartment was equipped with everything you need for a stay. Lovely hosts (Chelsea/ Russ thanks for everything!), friendly and helpful. We would definitely recommend to book this apartment! "
1225820,31633441,2015-05-08,27955048,Ange Paul,"We’ve spent a very nice time in Chelsea and Russ’ top floor apartment. It is very well decorated and everything we need to feel comfortable was provided. It is located in a nice neighborhood, with supermarkets, restaurants, bus and water-taxi shuttle all close by. It’s a great place from which to discover West Seattle, Alki and Downtown without renting a car.
Chelsea and Russ were very nice hosts, discreet but available to help us if needed.
Overall a great address that we will recommend!"
1225820,32009101,2015-05-12,21747987,James & Kathryn,"We enjoyed our stay and appreciated how helpful Chelsea and Russ were with our questions about Seattle. The apartment was great. Nice and clean, just as is was described and reviewed by others. "
1225820,32061852,2015-05-13,24589893,Carla,The place was nice and cozy. We really enjoyed our stay. 
1225820,32533149,2015-05-19,17428424,Robb,"Super clean place, exactly as pics showed.Great location for us near Alki beach and Sea bus. Never seen our hosts (which was ok with us) until the day we left. More to offer at the house than we needed. Hope to stay again in the future."
1225820,32838629,2015-05-22,25499952,Robert,"The apartment was clean and neat. Larger than we expected, but very comfortable. We live in New Zealand most of the year so even though we were only there in the late evenings we enjoyed watching Netflix, a new experience for us.
As we are retired the shower was a little awkward for us."
1225820,33237236,2015-05-26,28476423,Lindsay,"My husband and I absolutely loved our stay in the apartment! Everything was just as described and the apartment was much larger than we were anticipating. This apartment is like a home away from home. Chelsea and Russ provided everything you could possibly think of. They also stayed in constant communication to ensure our visit was perfect (which is was)! After a long day of exploring the city and nearby attractions, the apartment was always so comfortable to come back to. We cannot wait for another trip to Seattle, and we will definitely stay here again!"
1225820,34777858,2015-06-12,31040930,Christy,"Beautiful apartment and great hosts made for an awesome stay in West Seattle! The location is just a short walk to Alki Beach, there is off-street parking, and close by car to downtown. "
1225820,35078360,2015-06-15,26045981,Stephen,"We had a great time!  As there are very few hotels in West Seattle, we wanted somewhere comfortable to stay.  This was perfect for what we were looking for!  The bed was very comfortable, and the shower was slightly awkward, but still very functional!  The directions given were fantastic, too!"
1225820,36179842,2015-06-26,13545665,Maureen,Darling accommodations in a unique part of West Seattle. Was the perfect stopping ground for us on our way between cities.  Chelsea's guidebook was incredibly helpful in our finding some great eats in Alki. Parking on site was a great asset as well. Was wonderful being able to check in easily.  Had a great time on our trip!
1225820,36527415,2015-06-29,12013867,Jeannine,"Chelsea's place is sunny and welcoming, and well-decorated.  We felt at home while we were there.  She was very helpful and accomodating, and made our stay a pleasure!"
1225820,37145159,2015-07-05,27035963,Ben,"Chelsea was brilliant, such a great host! She accommodated our every need and was really helpful with tourist information. The place is ideal and cute, and Netflix is an added bonus. West Seattle is a nice area and the beach is nice. Really easy to get to downtown too so a perfect location. I would happily stay there again!"
1225820,37643925,2015-07-09,9387082,Betina,"Spent 2 nights at Chelsea's beautiful home. Clean, very well decorated and with a huge patio overlooking the ocean. Since we came in late after a looooong trip from Denmark, it was nice just hanging out in the livingroom, eating chease and crackers bought at the local grocery and watch a movie on Netflix. "
1225820,38595864,2015-07-17,32510765,Boyd,Very pleasant stay at Chelsea and Russ' adorable apartment. Everything we needed and more! Cute neighborhood and loved that the place is such a short distance from the beach. The parking spot and extra storage space in their garage was a bonus and very much appreciated. Both Chelsea and Russ were super welcoming and kind and very easy to reach if we needed anything. We had a great time!!
1225820,39376248,2015-07-23,30999189,Michelle,"We loved our stay in this beautiful space. The apartment was exactly as pictured and full of charm. It is located in a quiet area with Alki beach within walking distance. It is also a short drive to downtown and Pike Place Market. It was the perfect place to relax and feel at home. Chelsea was a gracious host and even encoraged us to use the deck (with ocean view) one evening to entertain a few relatives. The apartment was spotless, the bedroom was relaxing with a comfy bed to stretch out on at the end of a busy day.  Parking at the back was a bonus. If you are a dog lover, their lab Charlie is adorable! We didn't want for anything here, and would stay again next time we are in Seattle. "
1225820,43910950,2015-08-23,6819382,Chad,"A perfect, charming stay for our trip to Seattle.  The home is filled to the brim with original historic details, which we loved.  Although everything was historic, it was decorated perfectly and everything was so clean!  The location, while somewhat off the tourist's typical beaten path, is great if you want to explore an area of Seattle that you might not find yourself in otherwise.  Perfect hosts, perfect location and perfect accommodations!"
1225820,45242670,2015-09-01,32507258,Sarah,"This was such a great spot to stay in and I would recommend it to anybody looking for a comfortable and charming spot in West Seattle. The location is perfect for taking a walk down to Alki, hopping on public transit or a short drive across to Seattle. The bed and linens were comfortable and my favorite part about the apartment was the art - unique and interesting prints to look at. The short shower wasn't much of an issue (and I'm not the most limber either) - it is situated in a nice large soaking tub so taking a bath would also work well. The kitchen was convenient - although we didn't cook, we were able to store and heat up our left-overs. My favorite spot was the little office inlet overlooking the water. It was a great place to sit and fill out post-cards or get some work done. I would highly recommend this location and would gladly stay here again!"
1225820,45928956,2015-09-07,27622534,Dana,This place was perfect for our travels. I loved experiencing the west side of Seattle and Chelsea's place was charming to boot. 
1225820,46302697,2015-09-09,10831871,Katrina,Super cute and comfortable place to stay in a good looking neighborhood. Chelsea was really helpful with travel times and her guidebook was useful. Also accommodated early check in! Bonus: cute pets wandering around the backyard. Would absolutely stay here again. 
1225820,46587752,2015-09-12,16791163,Sarah,"The apartment was beyond what we could've hoped for. It was perfectly stocked and decorated. The neighborhood was great, very walkable and friendly. We loved being so close to Alki Beach. Chelsea and Russ were super friendly. We would definitely come back!"
1225820,46867280,2015-09-14,27702774,Devin,"Chelsea was a fantastic host! My wife and I stayed here while  honeymooning in Seattle and were welomed by a delicious bottle of champagne waiting for us on the table upon our arrival! The apartment had a very open feel with lots of natural light during the day and plenty of well-placed warm lighting for the evening. Very tastefully decorated and spotlessly clean. Can't speak highly enough about how amazing the king size bed was. We stayed in multiple hotels and Airbnb apartments throughout the week but Chelsea helped us go out on a high note. It was the perfect size for the two of us, and could probably accomodate three people if needbe.  The apartment was only a short walk from Alki beach where there were plenty of restaurants and shops to explore. The laid back nightlife was a welcome retreat from the non-stop party going on in the Capital Hill area.  "
1225820,48359613,2015-09-25,19653255,Matt,"Great communication, easy to know where to go, great directions for how to get into the facility."
1225820,48612946,2015-09-27,41195630,Noel,"Thank you for letting us stay in your cozy, cute place. It was perfect. We loved that it was only a 10 minute walk from the beach. The parking was close. It was easy to get around town. The decor was inviting and you had everything in the house that we needed to cook. I highly recommend your place to stay and would love to stay again in the near future. Thank you again"
1225820,49037284,2015-09-30,5040484,Ashley,"Everything was perfect! Chelsea and Russ were great hosts and were great at communicating with us so that our arrival went smoothly. The apartment is awesome, very clean and very comfortable. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in West Seattle!"
1225820,49615288,2015-10-05,2688287,Bill,"This is a very nice, comfortable apartment and in a great, convenient location.  My wife and I had a wonderful 2 night stay and would certainly recommend the apartment to others.  Next time we visit West Seattle, we'll definitely want to stay here.   "
1225820,50128777,2015-10-09,37186249,AshlieRene,"We loved this little apartment. The unique tub is fun for a little lady like myself. The bed is huge and so incredibly snuggly. The ambiance is lovely, minimalistic and stylish. It was such a fit for a Bryon and I. (We are a couple of photographers out of Portland and take great appreciation in the style of the places we are staying). 

We would definitely book here again. "
1225820,50767086,2015-10-14,22375431,Jon,"The house is very cute, with lots of wonderful decorations. For the most part, the apartment was perfect. Russ and Chelsea were not home, so we had a very private, quiet experience. My only concern: the bathroom was not as ready/clean as I would have hoped. The tub had so much hair in the trap that the water was not draining. I took it out and cleaned it, but y'know, it wasn't my favorite part of the visit. And as everyone else noted, it's impossible to take a shower standing up if you're over 5' tall. Taking a bath isn't so nice either because the hot water runs out quickly. 

On the plus side, there were a few types of tea in the kitchen, and the rest of the house was very tidy. Chelsea was great about getting us prepared for the rental in her absence. I'd definitely recommend a stay here."
1225820,53603171,2015-11-10,28809636,Nancy,"Pretty & perfect! 
Tastefully decorated - with all the charm of a craftsman cottage.  The bed sheets were divine! We had a great nights sleep, listening to the rain on the roof. The views were incredible and the place was so cozy and warm. Little amenities that made our stay even sweeter - coffee and 1/2 & 1/2, which added to a luxuriously laid-back morning before we left for a day of exploration around Seattle. 
We would absolutely love to stay here again. Thanks for a great place to call home for a couple of days.
Nancy & Ann"
1225820,54108928,2015-11-16,44850347,Shannon,"We enjoyed our trip to Seattle, highly in part to our stay at this home.  We picked a very rainy week (yes, that's probably normal in Seattle) to visit, so it was nice to come back to the cozy apartment at the end of each day.  

The house is pretty much exactly as the photos show.   We thought it was super cute!  The furniture and the bed were very comfortable.  The house was clean too.

Our flight arrived very early, and Chelsea let us pick up the key when we arrived.  There was no wait time at all.

We would recommend staying at this apartment if you are visiting Seattle.  The apartment is probably best for a couple.  "
1225820,55230278,2015-11-29,18061491,Katie,"We really enjoyed our stay at this little apartment!  It was very clean, well equipped, and in a beautiful West Seattle location.  Chelsea was very welcoming and responsive, and we loved their yellow lab who greeted us in the backyard a few times when we were leaving.  As others have mentioned, the only challenge is the shower, which you cannot stand up in.  However, it wasn't a huge issue and we certainly don't think it was a reason not to stay there!"
1225820,56486893,2015-12-14,25774889,Erin,This apartment has become our favorite AirBNB place to stay in West Seattle. Thanks for taking us in and making our stay wonderful! 
1225820,58286121,2016-01-02,30286367,Erin,"Chelsea's home was the perfect place for us to call home in Seattle for a few days! It's located in a great neighborhood, walking distance to the beach and California Rd that is chock full of gold coffee, eats and restaurants. Her home was cozy, well-stocked with all the basic amenities and we felt right at home. Communication with Chelsea was quick and easy. We didn't cross paths in person but we are confident we would return when we visit Seattle again! "
523883,1755605,2012-07-20,2813624,Anya,"Kate's place is sweet and private and comfortable and clean, with a cute little garden to sit in. She is friendly but gives privacy and space to her guests.  I would recommend her place to anyone."
523883,1823707,2012-07-28,1251762,Molly,"Kate's place was really wonderful and serene. It was a perfect place to just relax after a long flight. She's able to offer access when she's not home, which is really helpful and wonderful - so much less to coordinate! Thanks Kate! "
523883,1884713,2012-08-04,2864158,Kyle And Jenna,Our stay at the Greenwood garden was wonderful! It was a perfect location and close to everything we wanted to do. Kate was a great host!
523883,2013942,2012-08-17,3077196,Diane,"Kate's place is a nice cozy and clean hideaway with an en suite bathroom that felt private and safe. It has easy off-street parking (a big plus for Seattle), a charming private garden, lots of light and ventilation with comfortable bed and warm floors. This was the perfect location for us, we found it easy to get to where we wanted to go and to come back to at night. Would definitely stay with Kate when we are in Seattle again. Thanks, Kate."
523883,2035871,2012-08-19,3058070,Rob,Great place for a quick stop in Seattle. Very convenient access to University District and downtown. Top choice for those who like their privacy and prefer a hands off host.
523883,2316754,2012-09-17,3420087,Rong,A lovely house and quiet neighborhood :)
523883,2428200,2012-09-27,1368039,Marsha,"Very comfy bed. Fairly quiet. small but adequate space.  Very easy access, which was great, as I could come in when I arrived without having to set a specific time with Kate.  She was very gracious about being available if I needed information."
523883,2609850,2012-10-14,3827417,Charles,had a lovely stay at Kate's Garden getaway!  charming and cozy. private and quiet. exactly what i was looking for. this is where i will be staying  next time i pass through Seattle. i recommend it to all!   thanks Kate!
523883,2664981,2012-10-20,805734,Merle,"This little room was exactly as advertised and exactly what I needed.  Thank you, Kate."
523883,2764304,2012-10-30,3589381,Anne,"I needed a quiet, comfortable place to stay in Seattle, and this was perfect. I didn't meet Kate (I arrived after dark and had to leave early the next morning to write an exam), but everything was super clean and ready for me to crash. The room is quite small, but it had everything I needed.  "
523883,2875284,2012-11-13,3607343,Simon,"Quiet and peaceful in an ideal location, the room was also warm and very clean.  I had a great stay and recommend to all!"
523883,3294724,2013-01-06,1611642,Allen,"Comfortable and cozy room but it was very small. The room has its own entry and key so we never met our host. The location might be hard to find if you aren't familiar with the area, but it is quiet and very private. Not handy to downtown but convenient for north Seattle, Ballard, and Fremont. If the room had been a little cheaper I would have given it four stars, however it was a much nicer than staying in a motel on Aurora Ave.  "
523883,4488106,2013-05-08,4377326,Anwar,"This was a nice well furnished room and bath with sliding glass door opening onto a lovely garden with separate entrance. It's located in a quiet, charming neighborhood. The room was clean and ready when I arrived and Kate was a great hostess and easy to work with. Highly recommended."
523883,4692259,2013-05-20,6325498,Judy,"It was exactly what I needed.  Cozy room in safe place with parking.  It is a lovely home, Kate.  Thanks, Judy"
523883,4990074,2013-06-05,6670100,Mary,"The room is small, but the garden is large and private. Kate was instantly accommodating. The bed is comfy, everything fresh and clean. I'd definitely stay again."
523883,5030261,2013-06-08,6688914,Kirsten,"We stayed for three nights, it was the perfect getaway. Cozy, clean and quiet room, charming neighbourhood. I would def. recommend staying at Kate´s."
523883,7901967,2013-10-07,9123366,Joy,"What a wonderful alternative to hotels! The Greenwood Garden Getaway was more than was promised. It was great having easy and free on-site parking, wireless Internet access, and private access to the room. Bonuses include Kate's accessibility, a wonderfully quiet but easily found location, a garden to walk through, fabulous linens, and an immaculate space. Thanks, Kate. I'll be back!"
523883,8009440,2013-10-12,9110624,Rose,"The Garden Getaway was just what I needed for a short business trip to Seattle.  It's close to great restaurants and coffee, yet the location is very quiet and private.  The getaway had everything I needed; a comfortable bed, a clean bathroom, soft linens and towels and a little closet for storage.  I didn't need anything from Kate and she gave me my privacy.  It's probably pretty tight in there for two people, or longer stays, but it was perfect for me.  The private garden adds nice space in nicer weather.  
"
523883,8107910,2013-10-15,8850352,Seth,"Kate provided a clean and wonderfully warm room. She respected our privacy while remaining available via texts. It's a tiny place, but never felt 'too small'. Just right. :) We really enjoyed our stay here, and would recommend to anyone. (Thanks again, Kate!)"
523883,8798389,2013-11-18,8502576,Alex,Great little room and charming patio in a quiet neighborhood. The room was clean and tidy when I got there. I had plenty of privacy. No complaints.
523883,8975717,2013-11-29,4837472,Renee,"Staying here was easy, well explained, and a cozy getaway during the Thanksgiving holiday. I was visiting family so I came and went a lot and the room was always warm and welcoming upon arrival. There is an extra down comforter if needed, and some closet space to hang clothes. It was very private and quiet and Kate made herself available to answer any questions. It's tiny and only has a kettle, which was perfect for my short stay. Thanks so much Kate!"
523883,9331000,2013-12-22,194195,Noah,"The room is just as described, clean and with a comfortable bed, and as it was a short walk from our son's place it met our needs perfectly. Highly recommended if you're looking for a nice quiet room in Greenwood."
523883,10613920,2014-02-27,1452223,Amy,The reservation was canceled 32 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
523883,11485345,2014-04-05,10777771,Veronica,Kate was a fantastic host!! I had an extended stay and was very comfortable and warm at her place. She replays to all communications almost immediately and goes above and beyond the call of duty to ensure satisfaction at all times. On occasions we would run into each other and always have a nice chat. This is a great place for privacy and relaxation 100%! Thanks so much for being such a great host Kate.
523883,16704108,2014-08-01,66145,Gene,"We had a marvelous extended stay in Kate's oasis (two months.)  This is a highly efficient and well located guest bedroom. The walk-in closet had lots of extra space and the garden patio off this room is totally private and beautiful to see every morning. 

The local markets, restaurants, gas stations, bars are all within blocks. We even rediscovered Phinney Ridge and Ballard during this experience.

Getting to know Kate was just as wonderful as the space. I honestly hope her acquaintance will be around for years to come. 

Stay here!  ""."" "
523883,17292706,2014-08-10,4857645,Alex,"The room is cute and clean, and the bathroom is great, obviously newly redone and with tons of storage space for our toiletries. Big walk-in closet, nice kettle for tea, and an adorable garden where I was able to sit and read for a bit. All in all it was a very relaxing space, and we really appreciated Kate's approach as a host; she was available via phone if we needed anything but otherwise left us to come and go as we pleased. We actually never met in person, but everything went smoothly. The location is great as well. A nice walk to the Greenwood neighborhood with tons of coffee shops, boutiques, and restaurants (including a wonderful pizza place with a full vegan menu which we loved!). You can also catch the bus right down the street to get almost anywhere in the city. The neighborhood seemed very safe and we enjoyed a long walk home one night and passed through a cute ""block party,"" so it's quite lively but not loud. We did encounter a few creepily large spiders (larger than we have in southern CA) which probably came in from the garden, but I guess that's what you get in the Pacific Northwest."
523883,19783083,2014-09-18,4907834,Suzanne,"An amazing experience, thanks to Kate .... I highly recommend Seattle Garden Getaway.  Will definitely book with Kate again."
523883,19987673,2014-09-21,17420747,Kathleen,"Kate's place was small but very welcoming.  The bed was comfortable and I appreciated the nice touch of an electric kettle,  private bathroom.   There was off street parking and a nice small garden.  Kate responded promptly to all my contacts. Thank you.  "
523883,20069639,2014-09-22,21419769,Sandro,"Very efficient, very good value. Parking is great and location is awesome. Pillows are kinda crappy. "
523883,21885780,2014-10-26,18134691,Justin,"I stayed in Kate's room for a month. The pics and the description are accurate. There were no surprises. Well, actually there were, I was pretty shocked by the size of the closet. It's spacious and can probably accommodate any amount of luggage or strange items you're bringing with you, like your grandparents, or the silver-back gorilla that you keep sedated.

Kate has a family and if you're around during the day, then you'll hear them doing a variety of things: guitar strumming, maybe listening to a little Radiohead, and likely conversations about things that you can  only hear half of so you make up the other half in order to make it dramatic and entertaining for you. At least that's what I was doing.

The room is a short walk to Greenwood Avenue where you can catch the 5 to downtown, and from there you can go nearly anywhere in the greater Seattle area. I was doing a lot of back and forth from the room and the Microsoft campus in Redmond and it was a lot easier than I expected. If you want nature, then it's a short walk to Carkeek Park. If you want to work out, then there's a Gold's Gym nearby on Aurora. If you're staying for more than a few days, then your biggest inconvenience might be laundry.
"
523883,22278597,2014-11-02,15980066,Beth,"Nice room and bath in a quiet neighborhood.  Exactly what I was looking for, simply furnished, very clean & well cared-for. In better weather the small yard just outside the door would be a great place to sit in the sun. I didn't meet Kate, but everything went smoothly.  Next time I'll bring some tea so I can use the electric kettle and mugs provided!"
523883,22350329,2014-11-03,1731914,Justin,"Kate's place was private and quiet, and she she promptly responded to my few questions before I arrived. It was just waht I was looking for and was glad to stay there!"

523883,22717884,2014-11-12,3406559,Sharon,Kate's place was perfect for our short trip to Seattle.  The location was great with places to eat within walking distance.  We felt comfortable walking in this neighborhood.  Kate promptly answered all the questions I had.
523883,22921567,2014-11-17,21897736,Julieand,Kate was right there when we arrived; the room was clean and ready for us in every way. Very quiet/private off-street location. Cute and new; everything works.
523883,27036744,2015-02-23,25897776,Dani,Kate was a caring host. She responded quickly to all of my questions. Thank you Kate!
523883,28912743,2015-03-31,6826782,Mark,"I had a great experience at Kate's place in Greenwood. The private entrance is a big plus as it provides a great deal of privacy. It felt like I was staying in my own private place with a nice comfortable bed. Another benefit is the close proximity to the bus lines that can take you downtown and to neighborhoods like Ballard and Fremont. I never met Kate in person, but her communication was excellent. I highly recommend this place and would definitely stay here again!"
523883,35212349,2015-06-16,30131760,Megan,"My in-laws loved this charming, clean little place.  Very private and cozy."
523883,36773306,2015-07-01,16779710,Christina,"We stayed at Kate's for a month while completing a house remodel project. The location is great. This cozy garden space is sweet, quiet and peaceful. And while the weather was unseasonably hot, the room stayed cool and comfortable. The room is kind of tiny - probably better for just one person, two if the stay is short - but there is great closet space and a nice bathroom.  Kate is a great host. While I didn't see her often, she was always quick to respond to my inquiries and great at follow-up.  I recommend the Private Garden room for your Seattle getaway. "
523883,39049665,2015-07-20,3473512,Francesca,"Kate's room is as pictured, it is very clean and well-kept. The garden is beautiful and very private. It is a great choice for short stays. The house is pretty far from downtown, but the 5 bus picks up two blocks away and runs often--I used it to get to work downtown for the week we stayed. Greenwood/Phinney Ridge has good restaurants, and you are a quick drive from Ballard/Fremont. Overall, I would definitely recommend it!"
523883,39551187,2015-07-24,38132810,Shenghong,"The room is clean, tidy and private. We like the small garden. We had very good talk with Kate. She is helpful."
523883,46333297,2015-09-09,12432466,Liz,"Kate was a very good communicator and responded quickly to the initial enquiry and any questions afterwards. Her little suite was just what we were looking for, within walking distance to family, clean and comfortable. The room is very small but it helps that she has a good size closet to store suitcases and bags and the only time we spent there was to sleep. I may have gotten a little claustrophobic otherwise. Overall a great experience and value."
523883,47208788,2015-09-16,15015125,Kevin & Rya,Nice clean private room. Host is very responsive.
523883,47441509,2015-09-18,41639941,Michael,Everything is as expected. 
523883,47786514,2015-09-21,25769830,Katherine,"Kate was wonderful and so welcoming, although we didn't get to meet her - she was always available via phone. The location was great and the room was just as advertised. The room and bathroom were clean (which is important!) and well decorated. I would definently recommend this booking!"
523883,48398926,2015-09-26,10920048,Beth,"Kate's place was great. It's quiet, private, and clean. It's not a very large room but suited me just fine. I loved the garden entrance!"
523883,51712884,2015-10-24,41868352,Chang,房子所在的街区很安静，走路十分钟到二十分钟都可以有公交车到市区。房东的服务很好，屋子内配有电水壶。
523883,57299517,2015-12-24,3402697,Ansoo,"I stayed in Kate's cozy studio for two months. The studio was very clean, tidy and nicely located within walking distance to public transportation. It has a nice full bath, a large closet, and a private entrance with a lovely garden. Kate was very kind, accommodative and very quick to respond to my requests and inquiries. She was very hospitable and provided everything that was needed to make my stay comfortable and welcoming. I especially thank her for helping with the cleaning of the studio and keeping the studio clean and tidy.

The location worked perfectly for me as I had to goto downtown Seattle, South Lake Union area, Amazon campus daily and there were many buses nearby without the need for me transfer. I took either bus #5 or #40, which goes through Ballard and Fremont and to downtown Seattle ( including Pike Place  and Westlake Station).

There are grocery stores within walking distance, including Safeway and QFC. Neptune coffee is also nearby, a place I highly recommend for a nice cup of coffee.  

Overall, I really enjoyed my stay at Kate's cozy studio and I highly recommend to anyone visiting Seattle."
9256702,54184096,2015-11-16,48297161,Genevieve,"My kids and I had a fabulous time! Maya was very helpful providing maps and suggestions for places to visit and walking distance shopping. The loft is very well equipped and cozy. It has  great natural light and numerous games, video, etc.  We would love to come again! Thank you so much for this great space!"
9256702,55998804,2015-12-07,1557214,Jessica,"Maja was so lovely and the space was beautiful!  I was in town to visit Seattle for a potential forthcoming move, and this place was a perfect launching pad.  Located in the midst of the First Hill/ Capitol Hill district, it was walking distance to lots of cute coffee shops and restaurants.  The parking pass they provided was super helpful as well. The room itself was beautiful--and perfect for what we needed. All very new, very well designed and super comfortable for a short or long stay.  The view in the room is amazing.  Couldn't have asked for anything better!"
9256702,57082890,2015-12-21,25379947,Emma,The space exceeded my expectations and was very well located. Such a cozy spot for a weekend getaway
6773472,35605273,2015-06-20,35538067,Matt,"The apartment itself as well as its location were perfect. Jarad was so helpful, down to earth, and available that it made any apprehensions about using airbnb quickly fade away (this was our first time).  Will definitely be contacting Jarad for future stays in Seattle if he's available."
6773472,38012256,2015-07-12,36011334,Diana,"Jarad's place was wonderful! My boyfriend I stayed here while attending a wedding in Seattle. The apartment was bigger than expected and impeccably clean. Jarad was always accessible by phone if we needed any help and we were able to walk from the apartment to visit friends in the Capitol Hill area. Overall, this was my favorite place we stayed in the week we were in Seattle. I wish this was my apartment!"
6773472,38159594,2015-07-13,12223608,Luke,"Jarad's place was exactly as described, clean and what I wanted in a property. The building is next door to a nice hotel so there is literally a taxi outside waiting for you at nearly all times. Jarad also provided some great suggestions for restaurants and texted me half-way through my stay to make sure everything was going well. I would stay there again"
6773472,38521608,2015-07-16,36157479,JoAnna,"Great location! If you're in Seattle for a convention at the Washington State Convention Center, definitely stay here. I loved the bay window and hardwood floors. Plenty of room for a solo traveler or couple. Also, this place has A/C, which was a welcome surprise with the summer heat wave that's hit Seattle recently! Jarad made it easy to check in and out, and was available by email and text message. Would definitely stay again!"
6773472,38878170,2015-07-19,15702576,Lucy,"Jared was a great host and his apartment was very clean and in a great location, walking distance from downtown.  "
6773472,39107864,2015-07-20,38360156,David,Jarad's place was a great place to stay. It is in a perfect location right in downtown Seattle. The place is extremely clean and has air condition. I would highly recommend staying at Jarad's place if you are visiting Seattle.
6773472,39231751,2015-07-21,38308497,Jim,"Jarad made me feel welcome, was in close contact via phone, and had everything set-up for when I got there. His kindness made my first b n b experience a great one. "
6773472,39457955,2015-07-23,38833840,Liliana,"This place was clean and perfectly spacious, and the minimalist design made for a very relaxing, hotel-like stay (nothing better than white linens!). Jarad made check-in and check-out easy and responded to messages quickly. The location was awesome, within walking distance to downtown and Capitol Hill. I'd definitely stay here again."
6773472,39664602,2015-07-25,31270595,Sakurako,"Jarad was great host. The room was very clean and comfortable, also very nice location. He was very responsible person that we can easily contact with when we had questions. We totally recommend Jarad as a host and his room. "
6773472,39837520,2015-07-26,11272674,Tara,"Jared was a peach!
Very accommodating and answered texts right away. 
And he was also very understanding when I lost the house key!
The space was bright and had AC - very comfy. It was only an overnight visit and the space was perfect. "
6773472,45311880,2015-09-01,3013348,Marina,"Great host, quick reply for questions. Room was clean and easy access to shopping area."
6773472,47055719,2015-09-15,17882920,Nick,Jarad's apartment was a great way to have our own space in downtown Seattle without spending a fortune. All the popular tourist activities are within a walkable distance ( 1 mile) but you should be aware that the building is at the top of a pretty big hill so walking back from the water can take a while. There's a hotel next door which serves as an easy reference point when getting rides. You can always get a cab from there but we used Lyft instead which worked great. The building is centrally located within Seattle though it's more of a business area so there aren't many bars/restaurants close by like there are in say Belltown. Light rail to the airport stops about a 10 min walk away at Pioneer Square and works very well.  The apartment itself was clean and the bed was very comfortable and Jarad was a pleasure to deal with :)
6773472,49733038,2015-10-05,25042505,Fian,"Great location for first-time visitors! Walking distance from all the tourist locations (i.e. Pike Place , Space Needle, Chihuly museum, etc.). The studio was spotless with an amazingly comfortable bed and maximum privacy. There was a bit of confusion on how to enter the apartment, but Jared promptly responded. Overall, had a great stay. "
1259305,38280911,2015-07-14,33727998,Sophia,Great experience！This is the first time we use airbnb，and fortunately we choosed Patrice’s house. The house is so clean and spacious，has everything we need，even the beach toys for my baby。We have cooked some meals，the kitchen is perfectly well organized！And Patrice herself is also the highlight. She is considerate，quickly reply when I have any question. My parents and my baby are also loved Patrice’s house so much！
6452927,39996763,2015-07-27,30249435,Jennifer,My son and I were very comfortable at Elaine's house. It is a beautiful space. She is easy to coordinate with and we hope to come back and stay again.
6452927,41432212,2015-08-07,33946489,Phillip,"Elaine and Andy had such a beautiful home!  They were so inviting and were always quick to respond to my many questions. 

Their home is located in West Seattle and is within short walking distance of some great restaurants, of all genres.  The main freeway is also easily accessed from their area, so I had no problem getting to the downtown area within minutes.

The master suite has a very large and clean private bathroom, as well as an open air balcony on the 3rd floor.  

Elaine even made me fresh scones one morning for breakfast.  I would definitely recommend a stay at their home! "
7647221,53566954,2015-11-09,2424488,Tim,"Elisa was awesome!

I used airbnb as a last minute way to find a place for my family to stay over the weekend as they were in town with my younger brother to look at colleges.

Elisa responded within roughly an hour of my post and was really helpful. She especially outdid herself in giving logistical support to get to her home as well as letting me know that she was available in case we needed some directions.

Her home was as pictured and my parents really enjoyed their stay there, they would definitely stay there again if they visit."
7647221,54759256,2015-11-23,42878153,Haley,"Elisa's condo was nice and in a good location. Elisa made check in/check out a breeze with detailed instructions and allowed a late check out. The parking, speedy wifi, and washer and dryer were all wonderful for a longer stay! Note: There is no TV. "
7647221,55833883,2015-12-06,9257852,Kristen,"Great, cozy little condo. Excellent proximity to Greenlake and downtown. Fully set up with soap, laundry detergent, etc so we didn't have to bring much more than food. Thanks Elisa!"
699596,2425358,2012-09-26,1879218,Andrea,"We had a very quick stay with them so did not get to chat too much, but in the little time we had they were incredibly kind & helpful.  The room is lovely with a great private bathroom and comfortable bed.  Great area with easy access to transit to get downtown.  Incredibly thoughtful hosts that I would not hesitate to stay with again!"
699596,2475753,2012-10-01,2706804,Katie,"Megan and Saul were nothing but accommodating hosts during our stay in Seattle. We arrived and were warmly greeted by Megan, a tour of the space, and information about local eateries and shops. We even were surprised to have the benefit of a parking permit which was a tremendous help with a rental car!! We loved the setup, a private room with access to a terrace, and a short walk to Seattle's trendy Capitol Hill area. When we ventured downtown, we hopped on the 10 bus and got there in no time. 

This place and hosts are a gem of a deal and not to be missed. As a former resident of Seattle, I can attest to the convenience we had to enjoy Seattle at its fullest. 

Lastly, we loved the breakfast options left for us: hard boiled eggs, Dave's Killer bread, and a banana were all we needed to start our busy days! Thanks Megan & Saul!"
699596,2565589,2012-10-09,3696573,Denise,"My partner and I were really low maintenance, and we just wanted to have a place to lay our heads at night.  The living room and kitchen areas are nice and spacious and cozy, and lots of board games!  The bed was comfy and it was nice having our private bathroom.  Everything was perfect!  Even the tiny view of the space needle!  The house is really right in the middle of everything we needed, and everywhere was within walking distance.  "
699596,2606930,2012-10-14,1515251,Colleen,"Megan and Saul's comfy private oasis was all that was advertised.  I enjoyed my private room with a view to the outside terrace.  The bed was very comfortable and the private bathroom was perfect. Everything was immaculate.  Wi-fi was  provided as well as access to their lovely kitchen area.   Although Megan was away while I was in Seattle, my three nights were well overseen by Saul who was very friendly, and made me feel  comfortable as a guest in his home.  There was good communication and I will very likely stay with them again as I have family in the Capitol Hill neighborhood."
699596,2749115,2012-10-29,702645,Scott,"Great place!  Very quiet, private room downstairs with its own bathroom, and a few safe blocks to great bars and restaurants.  Saul had two keys ready for us and was a very accommodating host.  Would definitely stay here again! "

699596,3113873,2012-12-18,3170082,Randy,"Saul & Megan were great hosts - very friendly and accommodating.  They were on time for our arrival and showed us around the place.  Our quarters were clean and comfortable; having its own full bathroom and temperature control was a definite plus.  The kitchen was great.  We were out much of the time during our stay and coming and going was not a problem.  The location for us could not have been better: walking distance to many restaurants, pubs, and coffee shops.  We'll definitely stay here on our next trip to Seattle."
699596,3126594,2012-12-20,3834752,Sarah And Michael,"Very nice, clean, comfortable and private room and bathroom.  Friendly and welcoming hosts.  Walking distance to attractions (~20mins)."

Would definitely recommend this place - great room, and a great location.  Feels really private."

Saul and Megan were very kind and flexible.  When my bf slipped in mud (!) they were gracious enough to let us use their washer and dryer.  They saved us from a miserable plane ride home with their hospitality.  I would 100% stay here again."
699596,3592589,2013-02-20,2156111,Jay,"Good accommodations and location with bus stop to downtown right outside the door, and variety of restaurants and shops within easy waking distance.  Nice do it yourself coffee, fruit, toast, egg breakfast provided."

Not to mention cupcakes.  The room is spotless and quiet, the bed very comfortable, the bathroom clean and modern.  Megan encouraged me to make myself at home, and I did, eating the snacks they provided, and using the beautiful living room.  Great coffee, by the way!  Thanks to both of you!"
699596,3850421,2013-03-20,5439743,Cyndi,"Meagan and Saul were wonderful hosts. Their home was clean, comfortable and surprisingly quiet. There were earplugs for just in case but can't imagine why anyone would need them. We truly enjoyed our conversations! The short introductory tour helped us feel welcome and to know what resources were available.  It was super easy to hop on the bus and get to downtown in no time. It would have been fine to walk too but we had some sore feet before we got to Seattle.  I would stay with Them again in a heartbeat. "
699596,3874233,2013-03-23,5494749,Agnes,"It was wonderful stay in Megan and Saul's house.
They are so nice, outgoing and helpful! The room is on the first floor, which has good privacy and a lovely view of the balcony. The living room, the kitchen, and the guest room are all way more pretty than pictures!
Great location. The house is located a quiet neighborhood which is within 10 minutes drive to downtown. 
My boyfriend and I really had a good time here. And we will definitely revisit Megan and Saul next time we come to Seattle."

When I first arrived, Saul let me use his cell phone so I can clear up some issues with my cell company. He also printed the movie tickets from the SIFF for me.  I only had a short conversation with Megan, but I enjoyed it a lot. She gave me some tips about Columbia river gorge.                                              The guest room  is the only room on the first floor, so the privacy is great. Street noise is minimal. It never bothered me.                        Highly recommended."
699596,4873434,2013-05-30,681467,Rachel,"Megan and Saul's home was a great find for a vacation in Seattle with my boyfriend. The location was great for hopping on the bus to check out the tourist attractions in downtown Seattle and was also perfect for the swing dance event we were attending during the memorial day weekend. There were a good number of nearby places to eat within walking distance (Regents Cafe and Bakery around the corner was our favorite) and their home was next to some very good Seattle independent coffee roasters.

We really appreciated the breakfast foods that were available to us in the morning, the privacy that the room offered, and our terrific hosts, Saul and Megan, who were very responsive to our needs during our stay and very friendly on the few occasions where we happened to run into each other. Overall, our room was comfortable and clean - we pretty much couldn't have asked for more.

Would highly recommend a stay here and would choose to stay here again the next time I'm in Seattle."

We loved the privacy of the bedroom/bathroom and the easy access to the courtyard, which are both in the back of the house on the first floor. The bed and linens were comfy, the house was clean, the snacks and tea/coffee were much appreciated, and the neighborhood was perfect! We are happy to recommend staying here and would consider staying here again if we return to Seattle."

We highly recommend!

Our bedroom was very private, being downstairs and had an en-suite which was great.  A lovely breakfast was provided of cereal, juice, boiled eggs, fruit, bread etc.  Their home was spotlessly clean and comfortable. The number 10 & 11 bus went to Downtown from just around the corner and there were supermarkets and restaurants very close.  We would highly recommend staying with Saul and Megan.  Thanks for everything.  Margaret & Bill.

The room was so clean and nice to be in, the house's location fantastic- seconds away from the bus and a moment away from great places to eat and shop. The neighborhood is great, full of beautiful parks and friendly people. Last but not least, Saul and Megan went out of their way when we had questions but it felt like we had the place to ourselves at any other time. They are also really lovely people :)
We can't wait to go back."
699596,5705114,2013-07-12,7364125,Amy,"We stayed with Megan and Saul for two nights while on vacation in Seattle. They were lovely hosts and the accommodations were  perfect! The townhouse set up is very private and it was great to have breakfast there in the mornings before heading out. They live in a great neighborhood, and it's easy to walk lots of places or get public transportation from. "
699596,5963395,2013-07-24,6173438,Sylvie,"Ha  sido una estadia feliz en todos los aspectos. Es un lugar donde se puede dormir a gusto e incluso donde uno puede quedarse a leer un rato de dia. Megan y Saul son personas discretas pero amables y pueden dar un consejo cuando hace falta. Hay que subrayar la excelente ubicacion de la casa, con respecto a lineas de bus y al centro de la ciudad. También hay un lindo parque a ocho o diez bloques de la casa, el Veterans Park."
699596,6240767,2013-08-05,3667683,Daniel,"Megan and Saul were wonderful hosts. Nice, friendly, and gave us lots of tips for things to do around the area.  The property was clean, comfortable, nicely furnished, and very conveniently located for our visit to Seattle.  Definitely 5 star experience for our four nights stay.  I would definitely recommend Megan & Saul's property for your visit to this area"
699596,6369643,2013-08-10,7037767,Jennifer,"My sister and I stayed with Megan and Saul for four nights in Aug 2013.  Their apartment is lovely and the guest accommodations were great.  My favorite part of our room was the quick access to their cozy backyard -- where I enjoyed relaxing while I prepared for, and winded down from, my days exploring Seattle.  The location is great (super close to public transportation) and there are lots of restaurants nearby.  The street parking was surprisingly easy which was unexpected and made the stay especially convenient since I had a rental car with us as well.

Megan and Saul were perfect hosts.  They were friendly and very helpful when asked while also giving us plenty of privacy. We're really appreciative that our first airbnb experience was such a great one!"
699596,6469160,2013-08-13,2109735,Ezra,"This apartment is a great location for anyone who wants to be very close to the great stuff located in/around Capitol Hill, but not risk being woken up by loud revelers on the weekend.  Very clean room and hospitable and flexible hosts.  "
699596,6555149,2013-08-17,654280,Kat,"We were so pleasantly surprised by our stay with Saul and Megan. We were expected a fine private room, and we got so much more. Everything was absolutely spotless and clean, we were made to feel so comfortable in every way. They generously allowed us to use their kitchen, and made us feel completely at home. They stayed out of the way, giving us our space at first, but when we were like, ""hey, you guys are cool...can we hang with you for a bit?"" they also generously shared their time, chatting with us about Seattle, their lives, etc. They're hilarious, so friendly and easy to get along with - by the end, it felt like we were staying with old friends. Their restaurant recommendations were great.  We have had TERRIBLE airbnb experiences in the past, and this left us with a fresh and happy feeling towards the whole concept. We hope to stay with them again."
699596,6637384,2013-08-19,7775190,Chris,Megan and Saul were great hosts.  They offered lots of great advice on Seattle and access to lots of snacks/food in the kitchen.  The room was clean and private.  The parking pass was a plus.  Location great with lots of great trendy spots nearby.  Definitely recommend!
699596,6857497,2013-08-27,7869542,Claudia,Just perfect! We can recommend this place definitely!
699596,7034100,2013-09-04,6753102,Ross,"Megan and Saul's home is a delight.  The 10 and 11 bus lines go practically from their front door to the downtown, which was very convenient for me.  Getting around without a rental car was easy and a pleasure.  Their home is not only beautifully furnished and decorated but clearly cared for.  As hosts they attend to the details that add to your comfort and welcomeness - immaculate cleanliness, spare amenities in the bathroom and a jug of water with two glasses by the guest bed, for instance.  The guest room is downstairs from the living room, making it comfortable and private.

They were traveling for most of my stay at their home, but when I did meet Megan she was clever and conversational.  I would gladly stay with Megan and Saul in the future."
699596,7184753,2013-09-09,4282512,Pawl,"Went up to  Seattle for a weekend getaway to visit some friends & see a show and stayed at Megan & Saul's townhouse.
Really great pair, these two, very friendly & accommodating. Felt very welcome. Great home, clean room & bathroom and comfortable bed. Great location."
699596,7367774,2013-09-17,7796596,Larry,"Megan & Saul, were very hospitable, and helpful hosts! The accomodations were private, clean, and quiet, even though close to a busy road. 
The location is ideal...close to all the 15th street eateries and shops, and excellent bus connections to the city. FYI,  you will have to descend a steep driveway and navigate one flight up and down to access the room.
In summary, delightful hosts, and accomodations which we woud highly recommend."
699596,7563361,2013-09-24,8503293,Ruth,"Saul and Megan are great hosts--they gave us great recommendations and were very accommodating to our late check in / early checkout situation. Their townhouse is cute, clean, and close to lots of fun places and various bus stops. The snacks in the kitchen were also a plus! 

I DEFINITELY recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle! "
699596,7749190,2013-10-01,7885524,Jessica,I could not imagine a better place to stay while in Seattle.  Megan and Saul were extremely accommodating and the place was very comfortable.  Location was perfect and the Capitol Hill area was a great place to explore.  Couldn't ask for anything more in an AirBnB!
699596,7801271,2013-10-03,8845586,Deborah,"Couldn't have had a nicer stay.  Megan and Saul were warm and welcoming, and gave us excellent advice on buses and near-by restaurants (Jamjuree, a local Thai, served up one of the best meals of our Seattle trip). The bed was very comfortable, and the room (and neighborhood) was quiet - the garden terrace right off the bedroom is a charming oasis. 

We loved walking around Capitol Hill and there are tons of buses near Saul and Megan's to get all around Seattle. We didn't rent a car and after spending a day with local friends, who had to work to find parking at every stop, were we ever glad! The bus and light rail were great for getting around.

BTW, they offered up a very nice selection for DIY breakfast options and they stock your private bathroom with extras you may have forgotten to pack. Those were thoughtful touches I really appreciated.

This was our first Airbnb experience, and it couldn't have been more pleasant.  I had initially booked us in a hotel downtown which we walked by during the trip, and am delighted I took the leap and signed up for Airbnb instead. I really value visiting neighborhoods where people actually live, and being guests at Megan and Saul's gave us a richer view of Seattle than we would have gotten staying in a mostly tourist & business area.  

Many thanks again, Saul and Megan!"
699596,8026625,2013-10-13,8962688,Linda,"We enjoyed our stay with Megan and Saul. They are very nice, friendly and accommodating people. Location was great for us, as we were visiting family in the Capital Hill area, and we could easily walk to everything. We never heard any noise from outside. This house is located on the edge of the Pike/Pine corridor.

The room and bathroom were comfortable, CLEAN and cozy. There was even a hairdryer in the bathroom, so I didn't even unpack the one that I brought. 

This was our first Airbnb experience, and we would not hesitate to go through this site again. We would definitely stay with Megan and Saul again. Thank you for a very positive experience."
699596,8136886,2013-10-17,3258771,Kelli,"We had a great time at Saul and Megan's, they seemed like very down to earth and fun people. They welcomed us and gave us a run-down of the house, and then we were pretty much out exploring the rest of our stay. The grab-and-go breakfasts were the perfect start to our day, a really thoughtful touch. Thank you Saul & Megan for sharing your home with us!"
699596,8240918,2013-10-21,1422155,Marco,"House is in a very nice and quite area, close to downtown (30 mins walk) or with a 10 minutes bus.
Megan and Soul were perfect, they accommodate our check-in and our check-out, trying to match our needs.
If you want a good spot in Seattle but without the noise of downtown or the problem of parking, then you want this place.

Thanks again!"
699596,8430605,2013-10-30,8616625,Kate,"We loved the privacy of the bedroom, bathroom, and the ease to come and go as we pleased without disturbing anyone else in the house. Great location!! We walked everywhere! But the parking pass was super helpful as well since I had a rental car. Would stay here again anytime. Great value in my opinion. "
699596,8572229,2013-11-05,7705990,Alex And Renee,Megan and Saul are great hosts. Their place is close to a lot of different restaurants and bars. I highly recommend the Comfy Private Oasis!
699596,8827399,2013-11-19,9894889,Rebecca,"I had a great visit to Seattle, staying at Megan and Saul's. They were very helpful in coordinating my arrival (sadly, I didn't meet them during my short stay, though!) The room itself is very quiet, private and clean. It has a pretty patio view, a great shower, and a comfy bed. The extra touches—the water left on the bedside table, the breakfast items, and the parking pass, all came in handy. And this location is really great -- close to a lot of different things. I walked downtown and all around Capitol Hill. Great option for a visit to this cool city! "
699596,8963179,2013-11-28,10154877,Cecelia,"A great price for a private room with a private bathroom which was clean and cozy. Towels were provided as well, as well as spacious closet. The parking pass helped - we had a rental car. Megan & Saul provided coffee and tea if we wanted it, as well as a few breakfast options. We hadn't used Air BnB before, and this was a great introduction to the service. Great value, great hosts."
699596,9001985,2013-12-01,6491960,Maria,"We were provided a nice bedroom and adjoining private bathroom on the lower level of a three level townhouse in the heart of the Capitol Hill area of Seattle.  Saul graciously provided a parking pass for our three day stay, and showed us around the kitchen and living areas.  We were encouraged to make use of breakfast offerings of coffee, tea, cereals,breads, eggs, juice etc., as well as to relax in the living area.  Our room, which looked onto a small garden patio, was quiet, clean, and nicely equipped with extra bedding, slippers, drinking water, and wifi accessibility.  Best of all was their location which allowed us to park the car and fully immerse in Seattle life!  Thank you for sharing your home with us."
699596,9261210,2013-12-16,10565748,Julie,Saul and Megan were super pleasant hosts! The accommodations were comfortable and private and their location is in the perfect part of Capitol Hill. We highly recommend them and their cozy place! 
699596,9359090,2013-12-23,6212705,Eric,"Great space, cozy and private.  Very clean!

Megan and Saul have a lot of great information for those visiting Seattle for the first time around the house.
"
699596,9515683,2014-01-01,8396844,Chelsea,This is a wonderful place to stay. It's in the middle of everything and Megan and Saul are fantastic. Can't wait to come back!
699596,9867385,2014-01-15,3240472,Scott,"I stayed in Saul and Megan's beautiful home for six nights and would do so again in a heartbeat. Their home is spotless, has a view of the Space Needle from the living room, and best of all it's smack dab in the middle of Capitol Hill. The neighborhood was safe and full of so many things to see, eat and drink. The location of the townhouse made our trip even better because we had more time to actually DO stuff instead of wasting time getting from point A to point B. Yes, you will need to call Uber or a cab to get to Ballard or Fremont, but that's really just a 10 minute ride anyway ($5-15). 

Stay here with Saul and Megan. Not only is it a fantastic bargain, but they are great hosts that enabled us to have a great time in the Emerald City. "
699596,10054650,2014-01-27,78796,Katrina,"Saul and Megan are such warm, thoughtful hosts!  I stayed here with my significant other for a business interview turned fun Seattle/Pacific Northwest trip and the set-up was perfect!  Before coming, I had even asked if there was an ironing board (to which they said no, sorry) but then when I arrived the next day Saul had bought one!

Other small thoughtful items: earplugs for sleeping (not needed because it was very quiet), water, first-aid band-aids, slippers, even an outlet with 2 USB jacks in the wall. The room itself has nice light and the bathroom was very clean (I am very picky when it comes to bathroom cleanliness).  Upstairs there are puzzles and assorted games, as well as a coffee/tea table and milk/eggs in the fridge.

We used a car to get around and take day trips while there (4-5 days total) and the free parking pass was all we needed. One night out of 4 we had to park a couple blocks away but it was Saturday so understandable.

This was an all-around wonderful stay and very true to the airbnb style!"
699596,10210059,2014-02-06,11636305,Michael,"Definitely clean, comfortable and private.  Owners were very responsive.  Wonderful location for exploring Capitol Hill and downtown Seattle by bus or on foot..  We had an exceptionally fine dinner at Anchovies and Olives, a restaurant only a few buildings away.  We also appreciated the simple, organic, healthy food items the hosts made available to us. We would definitely enjoy staying with Megan and Saul again."
699596,10249367,2014-02-09,9930069,Allison,"I stayed with Megan and Saul in early February.  They are centrally located in Capitol Hill and can provide really useful information about places to go.  The room is as advertised – clean, comfortable, and spacious.  They are very flexible and accommodating.  If your next destination is Seattle, this is a really nice place to stay."
699596,10389025,2014-02-17,8412305,Laura,"Great stay at Megan and Saul's.  Clean bedroom, organic breakfast foods, and many types of tea (our favorite drink!).  Also close to one of our favorite Seattle diners--Skillet.  We drove up to visit our daughter at her university, and found this place very convenient and walkable.
"
699596,10759680,2014-03-06,3806534,Phil,"We stayed in Megan and Saul's cosy home in a fantastic part of Seattle for two weeks and were so glad we chose them. They were such warm and welcoming hosts and provided a really lovely and relaxed environment for us and our four year old daughter. We were there for two weeks which was longer than their usual visitors, however we all created a good balance between space when it was needed and friendly interaction, and they responded very warmly to our talkative little girl! The location is absolutely perfect and close walking distance to parks, cafes, organic stores and a beautiful bookshop...everything we wanted actually give we didn't have a car. The shared breakfast items were very appreciated and was a lovely addition to the wonderful hospitality. The room is small (perhaps this could be made clearer) however was enough space in the end and the other areas of the house available to us made up for the cosy bedroom. I would definitely wish to stay there again if we returned to (email hidden) felt sad to leave this very comfortable home and lovely people. thanks to you both!
Stephanie, Phil and Maya"
699596,10931561,2014-03-13,12846164,Gus,"We had a fantastic three-day stay at Megan and Saul's.  The location is ideal - really hip neighborhood, centrally located.  The apartment was beautiful and our room was nice and very private.  We were offered access to the living area and Megan provided coffee and let us fix cereal and fruit for breakfast, and she was very friendly and helpful with tourist advice and ideas.  We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to others.  Gus and Cathy"
699596,11157109,2014-03-23,12804861,Suzanne,"Megan and Saul were the perfect hosts and lovely people. It was my first time at an Airbnb and I wasn't sure what to expect, but they truly welcomed me and helped me to navigate my way through Seattle. They put great thought and care into making me comfortable throughout my entire stay. The location is great, the house is clean, and the bed is comfy. There is even a bathtub for which they gave offered me candles for ultimate relaxation!  If you're going to Seattle, you should really stay with Megan and Saul. "
699596,11269883,2014-03-27,13127018,Jan/Bill,"We stayed for 2 nights at Megan and Saul's place. We recommend them highly as natural hosts. They are friendly and relaxed and we felt very comfortable. They have thought through all the details to help guests have a good experience. It was our first experience with Airbnb and we will probably use it again in other locations.
Capitol Hill is a charming area of town. We were amazed at all the good restaurant choices close to their home. It is an easy walk to downtown Seattle and the direct bus route is very simple to negotiate.
"
699596,11335225,2014-03-30,3621280,Jennifer,"I had a lovely experience staying at Megan and Saul's oasis in the Capital Hill neighborhood of Seattle.  There are many things to share--but the most noteworthy aspects all fall under the umbrella of ""attention to detail"".  Staying here felt like staying with close friends--they are kind and thoughtful people and very easy to share space with.  The place is clean and neatly divided--plenty of cozy common space but also plenty of privacy in guest quarters on a separate floor.  There were yummy shareable food items like hard boiled eggs, fruit and cereal which helped me save money and time in my early morning rush.  They lent me a parking permit so that I could essentially park my car for the duration of my trip without concern and I found street parking directly across the street.  The space is very clean (and I can be on the picky side) and nicely decorated--I enjoyed sitting by the windows and soaking up the beginnings of spring outside as much as curling up on the couch by the fire later in the evening with a book.  It was the perfect place to land after long conference days.  My only regret is not having more time to spend here and to get to know them more!  I highly recommend Megan and Saul's home for your next stay in Seattle! "
699596,11800274,2014-04-15,9101336,Sean,"This was our first Airbnb experience and its hard to imagine a better one. Megan and Saul were gracious, welcoming and generous hosts. The room and apartment were pleasant and spotless and the fresh fruit cereal, coffee and tea in the morning an unexpected benefit, a great start to each day exploring Seattle. For our next trip to Seattle, we will definitely return to Megan and Saul's."
699596,11970190,2014-04-20,13933348,Lynn,"We got so lucky with Megan and Saul as our first AirBnB. Their location is perfect - couldn't have asked for a better public transportation-based trip, and they, themselves are extremely friendly. The room was private, and the living space was welcoming. Definitely recommended for anyone who wants to stay in Seattle.  "
699596,12285991,2014-04-28,13271311,Janine,"I couldn't have picked a better location for my exploration of Seattle (my first time there and fell in love with the city!). This rental is a great option if you are wanting to explore on foot, it is located in a very friendly neighbourhood full of anything you might need! Saul and Megan were easy going, comfortable hosts and their house offered a great place to drink tea and crash at the end of a day (with a comfortable bed/soft sheets). Thanks again for your hospitality! "
699596,13051120,2014-05-18,3931342,Thorsten And Prudence,"This was the perfect location for my stay! Saul was great, the neighborhood was fantastic, the room was great. I would definitely stay here again."
699596,13191638,2014-05-21,4386175,Rob And Nina,"We stayed with Megan and Saul for 3 nights and have absolutely no complaints. Their townhouse is neat, tidy and well-located, and they are wonderful hosts. They are accommodating and easy to communicate with, and even worked with a very late arrival. The organic breakfast fixings were a nice touch that really helped out on our first morning. We would stay again with no hesitation."
699596,13365353,2014-05-26,11298654,"Kirsten, Chris And Tor","Ended up at Megan and Saul's after a late work obligation meant most of the downtown hotels were booked or insanely expensive. Was very pleased with the choice. Organization in terms of getting the keys was spot on, parking permit meant I didn't have to think about the car for the weekend, and the walk to and from downtown went through the interesting neighbourhood and energetic nightlife of Capitol Hill. Even though I didn't get a chance to chat with them much because of work, from the bit I did both seemed like very pleasant and welcoming hosts. Bed and the accompanying bathroom are both quite good and this makes a solid base from which to explore the city."
699596,13610686,2014-06-01,14065426,John,"     Our experiences with our hosts was perfect.  Megan and Saul are a very pleasant couple, very friendly and very hospitable.  The accommodation was comfortable and clean, and we felt that we were at home.  
      They also provided helpful maps & advice on interesting things to do.
      We advise those who stay here to take public transportation, walk or bring the a absolutely smallest car, such as Smart car or MiniCooper.  The parking situation is tight.   Megan & Saul had a stroke of genius in providing a Zone 4 Parking Permit, which helps."
699596,13985550,2014-06-09,3919208,Cheryl,"Megan & Saul's home was perfect for my week in Seattle. It was centrally located to everything I needed; great food, beautiful walks and they even managed to have gorgeous weather the whole week. The house was super clean, comfortable, quiet and inviting. I would definitely stay here in the future. Thanks Megan & Saul!"
699596,14284532,2014-06-16,11691639,Christian,"Megan and Saul were really nice hosts and put a lot of effort into making our vacation a great experience. The room was spacious and had a private bathroom, which was nice. 

The property is located in the trendy and hip neighborhood of Capitol Hill. Although there are some homeless people walking around, especially at night, we always felt safe. Capitol Hill is pretty cool, but the walk back from downtown was rough at times. Going back means going up the hill. 

All in all, it was a great experience and we would be happy to stay with Megan and Saul again. "
699596,14657056,2014-06-23,11079504,King,"I had a great stay at Megan and Saul's townhouse. The whole place was very warm and homely, and my room was clean and quiet, with a private bath and windows that open to the small back yard: light & fresh air! You have access to the kitchen and you get nice organic fruits for breakfast!

Megan and Saul were also a really happy couple, and it was contagious. We also had some really great conversations; it's rare to find people that you click with so I thoroughly enjoyed it.

If you're after a comfortable stay in Capitol Hill, that's close to everything but is still clean & quiet, with friendly and engaging hosts, then you can't go wrong with Megan and Saul's place on 15th Ave."
699596,14863461,2014-06-28,8774739,Hannah,"I so enjoyed staying with Meg and Saul!  In town for a conference, I had to find alternative accommodations when the conference hotels filled up.  I'm so glad I chose to stay with Meg and Saul rather than in a hotel!  Their neighborhood, up in Capitol Hill, is beautiful.  Every morning I went for a run past gorgeous bungalows with immaculate gardens, through lovely Volunteer Park, and back.  On one such run, I discovered an amazing bakery, Bakery Nouveau on 15th, where I ate breakfast for the rest of the trip.  I didn't need to, though, since Meg and Saul always had fruit, berries, granola and hard-boiled eggs that were great for breakfast or a snack too.  I also ate at Jamjurri (sp?) Thai restaurant, just a few blocks away, which was also very good.  Every day I would walk downtown to the convention center, but I could just as easily have taken the bus.  When I rented a car, Meg and Saul kindly let me use their parking pass, which was a huge help since parking is not easy in Seattle.

The room itself was lovely.  I had a very comfortable double bed, private bathroom and even my own patio space.  By the time I left, it had started to feel like home.  Definitely stay with Meg and Saul if you're ever in Seattle!"
699596,15842317,2014-07-16,17618272,Rachael,"Saul and Megan are delightful!  They have a great vibe and are genuinely  good people (I have fabulous travel mojo, and I just know these things :)  The rental comes as advertised - clean and quiet and secluded, with direct access to a lovely patio and garden.  We greatly appreciated having the private bath off the bedroom, and the location couldn't have been better for restaurants, green space, and public transportation.  Highly, highly recommended."
699596,16743174,2014-08-01,11804040,Kedar,"Great experience!  Saul and Megan were very welcoming, and the room was just as described.

699596,16880440,2014-08-04,10348247,Drew,Megan & Saul were very warm and welcoming. Great location. Clean and private. Room was quite small and required walking up then down stairs which made carrying heavy bags a challenge.
699596,17220726,2014-08-09,11657454,Andrew,"Our stay at Megan and Saul's was great! Very comfortable, spacious and clean. The neighborhood offers a lot and is very easy to get to from downtown. Wished we stayed longer!"
699596,17567471,2014-08-14,17423586,Casey,"Megan and Saul were great. They were very communicative while we were getting into town and finding the place. They were very friendly and had all sorts of great information about neighborhoods to visit and things to try. The neighborhood was perfect for us, it gave us a great feel for what the neighborhood was like. Much more than we ever get from a hotel.

Overall everything went as well as we could have hoped. Any anxiousness we had about the AirBnB experience (it was our first time ever) never materialized. "
699596,17791269,2014-08-17,19444784,Cecilia,"Megan and Saul were awesome hosts who were quite accommodating and super friendly! They definitely made us feel welcome during our stay providing everything from toiletries to towels, extra blankets, an iron, a fan in case it got hot, and they even had some breakfast treats for us in case we needed a snack on the go. Our room was clean, comfy, and we felt we had enough privacy during our stay. Being able to use their parking pass was a really nice plus - saved us some money in that we were able to park for free within their neighborhood. I would undoubtedly recommend this place as an option when visiting Seattle. Thanks, Megan and Saul, for your generous hospitality and for making my first airbnb experience such a positive one! :)"
699596,18181382,2014-08-23,18056897,Brian,"We had a delightful stay.  Saul and Meghan were generous and made us feel very welcomed.  This place is in a great neighborhood not too far out of downtown Seattle in Capitol Hill, which had lots of great cafes, restaurants, shops, and it isn't too far from Volunteer Park, with its lovely gardens and terrific view of the downtown and Puget Sound!"
699596,18423804,2014-08-26,18911452,Donald,"We didn't get to meet Saul and Megan but they had arranged for someone to let us in and show us around. It was exactly as advertised and the enthusiastic reviews others have provided. Saul warned parking would be a challenge arriving on a Friday night, but a next door neighbor was just leaving and offered to let us use their parking place to unload. I then got lucky and found more permanent parking just half a block away. We were there 3 days and except for Friday night never had a challenge finding parking. House is lovely and use of kitchen and living area made for a nice stay. "
699596,18625709,2014-08-29,19096009,Misha,Great place and great location.   Would highly recommend it to everyone!
699596,18813723,2014-09-01,6368912,Neal,Room and bathroom were very clean and comfortable. We didn't meet Megan until the morning we left but she was super nice and had arranged for their friend to welcome us and show us around. Having a parking pass was nice as it was incredibly difficult to find a place to park during a very busy weekend when a ton of things were happening in Seattle. The pass lasted 72 hours so we decided to leave the car parked the whole time and use Uber and Lyft (and walk) for all necessary transportation. Overall a great experience and very comfortable accommodations.
699596,19101716,2014-09-06,6862755,Ryan,"We had a fabulous time in Seattle and Megan & Saul's place was the perfect jumping off point. It was just as described and had all the comforts of home. They really went out of their way to make us feel welcome although we didn't spend much time at the house so we really didn't take full advantage. Overall, an A+ listing!"
699596,19640271,2014-09-15,20912080,Sarah,"Megan and Saul have a beautiful home and they made us feel welcome the entire time. The bedroom and bath were very clean and comfortable and had many amenities like a fan, iron, and hair dryer. Having use of the kitchen was a great perk and they provided us with a nice assortment of breakfast items and snacks. The location of the home is ideal to see all the major sites, with easy access to public transportation. We did not need to rent a car since everything was in walking distance or a short bus ride away. Megan was very helpful in giving us tips and they have a huge supply of maps and brochures if needed. We found this experience to be better than staying in any hotel! "
699596,20368497,2014-09-28,2851094,Nate,Location was perfect for checking out Capitol Hill and the guest bedroom/bathroom was comfortable while affording lots of privacy (it's on its own floor from the rest of the house). Megan and Saul were friendly and accommodating hosts and the whole stay went 100% smoothly.
699596,20847524,2014-10-06,5210227,Chris,Had a great time staying at Megan and Saul's place. A comfortable oasis in the fun Capitol Hill neighborhood within a 10min bus ride from downtown. Would highly recommend staying here.
699596,21124505,2014-10-12,18354208,Jess,Beautiful space in a wonderful neighborhood. Megan and Saul were very accommodating. 
699596,21539555,2014-10-19,8919293,Anne-Laure,"Great stay! Megan and Saul's place is ideal to visit Seattle. Neighborhood very safe and pleasant and only 10 min driving to downtown. The guest pass is very convenient and it is not too much complicated to park in the street. 
Bedroom and bathroom are exactly as described and very clean! You'll feel like you have your own place, very private and quiet. Everything you need for your stay is provided (shampoo, hair dryer, flat iron...). 
Very easy communication with Megan and Saul. Check in and check out very convenient. 
Thank you Megan and Saul! We loved Seattle ! "
699596,21915546,2014-10-26,9154842,Kunal,"Saul & Megan were amazing and gracious hosts. From the minute my girlfriend and I arrived, they went the extra mile to make our stay comfortable, and our trip to Seattle excellent; from helping us find parking in the rain at 12:30 in the morning, to the thoughtfully placed bottle of water in the room.

The room and house really are an oasis. The house is located near a number of restaurants, bars, and shops in Capitol Hill, yet the seclusion of the downstairs bedroom is a good counterpoint to the hustle and bustle just a few streets away. 

Our trip as a whole was excellent, and where we stayed was a big part of that. Would definitely stay again!"
699596,22452026,2014-11-07,4096748,Mitzo,"Me and my boyfriend payed a ten day visit to Seattle, to visit some folks  there! Everything went super smooth when we arrived. There was always breakfast things that we could eat from. We run on very different hours, so we did'nt get to see each other very often. But that was cool, with our own little somewhat closed of part of the house! Cool neighborhood! 
All in all, a very good stay! If you're thinking about booking, do!
I recommend this place."
699596,24608914,2014-12-31,21839352,Dave,"Our stay with Megan and Saul was excellent. They were friendly and inviting and made us feel at home during the three days we spent in Seattle. The place was clean and comfortable, just as advertised.  We highly recommend them as hosts!"
699596,25030036,2015-01-05,3332635,Melissa,"Megan and Saul were very communicative right from the start, and accommodated me and my friend starting on New Year's Day. Though Saul had told us ahead of time that they were hosting a party the night before, the place was ready and room spotless for us by the time we arrived (which was earlier than check-in time, and still they were completely gracious!)

We were a little modest with the heater at first (the room has its own thermostat so you can adjust to your liking), though Megan said we were welcome to crank it. We eventually did because it didn't feel like warm air until the dial turned past 80, so I guess the numbers are arbitrary? Once we figured that out, the room was warm and comfortable for the rest of our stay.

Major bonus points for the jar of vitamin C on the kitchen counter (in addition to the breakfast items)--really felt that saved us from coming down with something during our vacation after a hectic holiday season!"
699596,25413836,2015-01-15,1558164,Jonathan,"We had a great stay at Megan's & Saul's apartment.
The house is located perfectly close to Capitol Hill.
The hosts were super kind and we would love to pay them a visit soon again."
699596,26282810,2015-02-08,27162452,Juanita,"Although the location was a little bit frustrating to figure out after a long day (I arrived around midnight), I was very pleased with the room. It was completed separated from the main area and was  quiet and private, very clean and had it own separate thermostat which i appreciated greatly. Megan and Saul, were very gracious and gave me space.   "
699596,26543156,2015-02-15,25842569,Daniel,"The purpose of my trip was to explore as Seattle as much as possible by foot, (or in our case, skateboards). The location of Saul and Megan's place was prime. We ran into Megan after the first night and was comforted by her kindness. She suggested some great places to check out around town and made us feel super welcome. "
699596,27106653,2015-02-25,1150009,Rena,"Megan and Saul were caring, warm hosts who were exceptionally easy to talk to. I had spoken to Megan regarding my desperate need for a massage and she personally contacted a friend she knew that was a LMT. What a very thoughtful gesture. Both Saul and Megan know the area well so their knowledge would be extremely helpful for those needing inside tips for how to get around.

The room was exactly as pictured. The bed was warm and cozy and I loved having my own private bathroom. Their townhouse felt safe and was very quiet. 

Capitol Hill is a densely populated area of Seattle. If you want to just visit the downtown area, walking, riding the bus, or renting a bicycle would be the way to travel. However, if you have a vehicle, please know that parking enforcement is strict. To help with that, Megan and Saul are kind enough to provide a 72-hr. guest parking pass so you're not constantly worried about getting a parking ticket or having your car towed away.

Overall, our experience with Saul and Megan were very positive and we would not hesitate to stay with them again if they would have us. "
699596,27725720,2015-03-10,26019774,Brian,Megan and Saul set the bar for AirBNB hosts. Their place is in the best location and they made us feel at home. We'd love to stay with them again!
699596,27889958,2015-03-14,518879,Ashley,"Megan and Saul were very friendly and informative. The room was great, clean and packed filled with anything you might need!
They were very accommodating about check in time which was awesome!
Once we got there they had maps and suggestions for what was good in the neighborhood.
The location is awesome and you can easily walk anywhere!
Would definitely stay with Megan and Saul if ever back in Seattle! "
699596,29119327,2015-04-04,15288708,Jonathan,"Very welcoming, opened up more than just the room to us. Let us use their guest parking pass which saved us a fortune on cabs and parking. Would definitely stay with again. "
699596,29573140,2015-04-09,906479,Laura,"I had a great experience at Megan & Saul's, I was in Seattle just for 3 days for work and their  place is perfect: private room and bathroom, everything very clean and they made everything to make my stay easier. I also enjoyed having access to fresh fruits and everything needed for breakfast, I will be back on my next trip !  "
699596,29741056,2015-04-12,28171499,Wolfgang,"Saul and Megan, have been very nice and accommodating! 
They shared their kitchen and living room and the room was clean.
The location is quiet and 1 mile to walk downtown, all down hill.

Thanks for having me!

699596,30382189,2015-04-21,15557000,Dawn,Megan and Saul were gracious hosts!  The guest room is perfectly located within the apt such that you feel you have your own personal space.  The apartment provided easy access to the convention center and downtown.  I would definitely stay here again. 
699596,30696803,2015-04-26,30025312,Juliette,"We had a great experience staying at Megan and Saul's.  They were very welcoming and accomodating, they made logistics a breeze, and our room was private and comfortable with a great bed.  We look forward to staying there again!"
699596,31054077,2015-05-01,10036836,Cortney,"Megan and Saul were great hosts. They were there to greet us and made sure we had everything we needed. The room itself is great! It has a private bathroom and shower which made our stay even better and more private. The room is situated on the 1st floor and our hosts were on the 3rd so we had plenty of privacy. The room was spacious and clean and they provided us with anything you could think of, they even had a container of disposable ear plugs. We would stay here again and if we return to Seattle we'll seek this place out for sure. It's a steal price wise because the room is great and the location can't be beat!! It's in Capitol Hill and you can walk to a ton of restaurants, pike place market, bars, a small movie theater, really anything. Love this place and loved Megan and Saul! So yourself a favor and stay here! Side note -- the bed in this room is the most comfortable mattress you'll ever sleep on! Guaranteed! "
699596,31291201,2015-05-04,26294097,Scott,"Megan and Saul were amazing hosts! We had a great time visiting and chatting with them and they were kind enough to speak with us about our plans in Seattle and give us tips on great restaurants to check out in the neighborhood, which we did- they have great taste! They had maps available for our use, plenty of snacks, extra toiletries available, and everything was immaculate! We were very comfortable in the room downstairs, which was very quiet. We had a great first airbnb experience and highly recommend Megan and Saul to others!"
699596,31527370,2015-05-06,10036836,Cortney,An amazing room with the warmest and nicest hosts. Do yourself a favor and stay at this place!!  You won't regret it!
699596,31784886,2015-05-10,13439755,Erica,"We had a lovely stay at Megan and Saul's home in Capitol Hill. The keyless entry was a breeze and we were greeted by a hand-written note with information, instructions, and cell phone numbers of our hosts. The room was clean and inviting, and the location can't be beat--we were able to travel easily around the city by bus, Pronto and on foot. While we didn't get to interact with our hosts while in Seattle, Saul was extremely responsive and helpful via text. We highly recommend Megan and Saul's home!"
699596,32375713,2015-05-17,31768047,Karandeep,"Megan and Saul were very welcoming and helpful during the entire stay. The room was very clean and had a very home feeling to it. I would definitely stay again and recommend this anyone who is visiting the Seattle area. 

Thank you Megan and Saul ! :)"
699596,32958408,2015-05-24,6128242,George & Tony,"It's just like they say 'a comfy private oasis on Capitol Hill'! Room, bath and the entire home were clean and spacious. The neighborhood is quiet and friendly but still near to numerous bars, clubs and restaurants in walking distance. Megan and Saul had lots of good insights for Seattle and Capitol Hill in particular. We can strongly recommend this place and its fun and sweet hosts."
699596,33374492,2015-05-27,13883980,Brijesh,"Megan and Saul were excellent hosts. Saul was helpful from the time I made the reservation, answering all of my questions. Megan and Saul were also very welcoming and friendly when my girlfriend and I arrived at their house, letting us know all of their favorite places to visit and eat.

Their house was very conveniently located in Capitol Hill and close to a lot of really cool places. The room was excellent, roomy, clean, and had all the amenities.

I highly recommend Megan and Saul for whenever you're in Seattle"
699596,33653313,2015-05-31,28283550,Jeffery,"Cozy, comfortable and efficient. Very nice experience. Megan and Saul were great hosts, provided keyless entry, and generously offered coffee, tea, snacks and light breakfast fare. Megan left a detailed note and some maps for us when we arrived. The location is perfect, near buses and some grocery stores. And they provided some local insights about neighborhoods and the Seattle scene!"
699596,34405424,2015-06-08,27637361,Mariko,"Megan and Saul was a wonderful person.
They were kind and warm and a perfectly convenient location.
I would like to stay here again !"
699596,35230360,2015-06-16,30478166,Christine,"We had a great time visiting Seattle and staying at Megan and Saul's cozy home. Everything was exactly as described in the listing. Megan and Saul were very nice and friendly. The room was very clean, coffee and breakfast fixings were provided, and the bed was comfortable. The location was ideal; super close to restaurants, bus stops, and grocery. We would stay at Megan and Saul's home again. Thank you!"
699596,35484254,2015-06-19,30286319,Martin,"We had some good days in Seattle! Capitol hill is a perfect place to live when exploring the city. You do all the touristy things downtown at daytime. And explore the awesome capitol hill nightlife in the evening. Megan and Saul were exelent hosts. The room was private, nice and tidy. We felt very welcome in their home!"
699596,36011338,2015-06-24,3222055,Paula," Megan and Saul made us feel welcome. They were available when needed and also gave us privacy.  The room is in the back of the home which allowed privacy. It is very clean.
The place is in a perfect location,close to the downtown area. Capitol Hill is a unique area of town, as you may know. "
699596,36506805,2015-06-29,6738700,Ian,Megan and Saul made everything easy for us. The room was exactly as described and we had everything we needed. 
699596,36987843,2015-07-03,1428795,Greg,"I think the previous reviews sum up this Airbnb really well, i.e. it's a brilliant place to stay! Megan and Saul are great hosts, very welcoming with that laid-back North West hospitality. The room is separated out from the rest of the house so you have your own space, and everything was clean, tidy and well prepared. We loved chilling out in the kitchen area each morning with some great coffee and cereal/toast, all provided. And then there's the location, we were so happy to be in what has to be one of the most happening neighborhoods in Seattle, with easy bus links to downtown. No wonder Megan and Saul are so booked up in advance. Thank you for making our Seattle adventure so special!! Greg & David"
699596,37553618,2015-07-08,30241992,Jordan,"Our experience in Seattle was spectacular. As first-time visitors, my wife and I were spent most of our time out and about exploring the city. Megan was super helpful when we arrived, made us feel welcomed, and was willing to accommodate our slightly early arrival. They left snacks on the counter for us and the room was clean and tidy. The room really did feel like we were at home. We were glad that we stayed in an eclectic neighborhood with friendly local residents instead of a corporate hotel. We were a bit surprised at how easy Seattle is to get around. Perhaps this is because the bus stop to take us directly downtown was about 1 minute away!!! So convenient!! Overall, this stay was PERFECT for our first experience in Seattle!"
699596,37863712,2015-07-11,34403848,Claire,"Megan and Saul were great hosts - they were helpful and available and left us nice handwritten notes. The keyless entry system was super convenient, and the trip (our first airbnb!) went smoothly.

The neighborhood was a fun place to stay, with tons of restaurants and personality. We went downtown every day we were there - walking is totally doable and was a good way to see the city but we also took the bus from the convenient stop across the street.

The room was perfect, very comfortable and clean. It has a great view of the charming backyard!"
699596,39299919,2015-07-22,22778385,Omid,"Megan and Saul were both extremely welcoming and kind. The room and bathroom were both clean on arrival, exactly as described. The breakfast in the morning was a wonderful touch. I would definitely stay with them again. "
699596,41187890,2015-08-05,26384012,Melinda,This was the perfect location to see Seattle. It was very close to multiple bus lines and wonderful restaurants. The room was very comfortable and our hosts were extremely helpful.
699596,42116996,2015-08-11,31808726,Tina,"Our stay was extremely comfortable. The hosts were around occasionally, but we did not see them often. And when we did, they were very friendly. The location is prime! We were really close to great eating (ramen, coffee shops, and Molly Moon's ice cream - you gotta try the Balsamic Strawberry flavor). Also, the great plus about this place is that they provide free continental breakfast in the morning (hard-boiled eggs, organic cereal, bread and snacks). This saved us some $$ since we didn't have to buy breakfast.  Thank you for a lovely stay!"
699596,42537474,2015-08-14,4335574,Rebecca,"We were early, but Mgan provided a code to get into the house.  The room was as described, a full bedroom en suite bathroom.  The neighborhood is perfect...a juice bar one block away for my husband and 7/11 for my coffee.  We walked most of the time to Pikes Market, but the bus #10 stops right by the house and goes straight into town.  "
699596,43242378,2015-08-18,36165540,Andreas,"We felt very welcomed by Meg and Saul, and the listing was perfectly described. It was a wonderful stay in a great part of Seattle, and was very walkable and private. We would happily stay here again."
699596,45261600,2015-09-01,2186286,Michael,Megan and Saul were amazing hosts with a very nice private room. They set out a basket of toiletries and had all the other basics you sometimes forget when traveling. I even had the pleasure of playing some games with Saul and left with a crossword puzzle that was perfect for the plane. It was a wonderful stay. 
699596,46109878,2015-09-07,2054333,Brian,The host canceled this reservation 35 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4418480,24651598,2015-01-01,553194,Amar,"We stayed at Nick's place almost a month during December. He has been very easy to communicate with from the very beginning. His place located right in the middle of the action in Seattle. Very cozy, clean, and great appliances. This is a great place for anyone. Highly recommend.  Would love to stay next time we come around. Thanks"
4418480,30412170,2015-04-21,2082944,Tony,"Great host!  Very easy to communicate with, nice apartment in a good location, and clean.  So many great restaurants in the area and easy access to several bus routes.  I'd definitely stay again.  "
4418480,41641947,2015-08-08,13607,Ariella,Nick's place is a very nice and comfortable apartment in a great neighborhood. Check in and check out was flexible. Host was very responsive and available if needed. I would highly recommend if wanting to stay in Capitol Hill.
4418480,43142671,2015-08-17,2064032,Cory,"Nick was very communicative, easy to work with, and quick to respond whenever we had a question. Can't beat the location for Capital Hill.  The second floor deck made for great people watching."
4418480,51249560,2015-10-18,14993707,Sean,Just wanna say that Nicks has a beautiful apartment and great location if you enjoy going out or relaxing. Nick was very helpful with information when you need something. I will definitely recommend this place to any body.
4418480,52028650,2015-10-25,11046051,Matthew,Very nice and well located apartment. Host friendly and easy to contact. Lovely experience!!
4418480,53422116,2015-11-08,5357454,Blake,"There were some hiccups with the cleaning service prior to my arrival and the place wasn't quite guest-ready. The main thing that bothered me were the sheets that needed washing. The one coin-operated laundry unit in the building was occupied every time I checked, so I ended up sleeping on a friend's couch elsewhere in the city. Beyond that, the space is big, has nice furniture, and is in a great location. With an easy fix regarding cleanliness, this would be a top-notch spot. "
4418480,57174263,2015-12-22,14993707,Sean,Great place to stay if you like to be close to restaurants and bars. Very comfortable environment and host was excellent.
210316,13981528,2014-06-09,15859129,Caroline,"We really enjoyed our stay at Flor's ""Five-star"" furnished room. The room had everything anyone would want, the most comfortable bed, and she provided lots of extra services, like breakfast and rides, for reasonable fees, making our stay even easier on us. It was the best omelet we've ever had. She was responsive to our needs, and an all-around nice person. Her back yard was a lovely place to sit. The neighborhood is quiet and convenient to transportation. We would come back if we're in Seattle, and will recommend her place to others."
210316,14313853,2014-06-16,13676340,Devarajan,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Flor's residence. Flor is a wonderful person and a great hostess. She meticulously planned to arrange the room so that it will be comfortable for us and all other guests. She had left tons of fresh stuff in the small fridge for us, she had a stock of basic tolietries, plates, bowls and silverware, in fact, everything that we needed was there. Room with number locks was another convenience so that we did not have to carry keys around. She also baked some cookies for us and she treated us to Peruvian delicacy snacks. Above all, she, her husband Nacho and her son Joseph were all very nice and friendly that definitely made our stay even more pleasant. We would definitely recommend staying at Flor's beutifully decorated place."
210316,15017729,2014-06-30,2813152,Jessica,"Wonderful hostess.  Has thought of everything to make this space a home away  from home.   We thoroughly enjoyed our time together.   The place is very convenient for public transport and the park nearby provided a nice retreat.

Flor has thought of all of what might be missing and provides sundries for those in need.  Thank you for you generosity and kindness.  The peruvian breakfeast was awedome."
210316,16717316,2014-08-01,16463143,Janet,Flor is  a lovely and gracious hostess. She gave me a city tour on my first few days in Seattle and she and her husband made me feel like a part of their family. The room was very nice and the bed was super comfy! I met so many interesting people who stayed there during the same time as me. 
210316,17723003,2014-08-16,19742738,Hallie,"Flor is amazing!  her warmth and generosity, her enthusiasm, her willingness to go above and beyond, and her attention to detail all helped make our stay memorable.  We greatly appreciated the tour, the Peruvian food, and helpful information.  She and Nacho instantly made us feel like friends and honored guests welcomed into their home, rather than paying customers."
210316,18434762,2014-08-26,19235630,Diana,Flor was very accommodating from the first day  I requested information on her property. She answered all my questions in less than 24 hours and made us feel comfortable to book her room. My friend and I stayed at her place (room 9) for a girls trip. We had everything we needed and her home was full of life! She came to pick me up at the airport very late at night and dropped me off early in the morning ($40 each way). Them she drove me around the neighborhood to show me the bus stops and places to eat. The only issue I had was the bathrooms. It is two bathrooms for 9 rooms and we had to wait a couple times to use them. Also I didn't understand the reason for her entering our room when we were gone. She came in a couple times and moved our suitcases and washed our dirty cups but didn't make the bed or change the towels. Nothing was stole it was just a little strange. Besides that the place was close to bus stops and easy to get back to!
210316,18893723,2014-09-02,17835121,Janet,"Flor's place is DEFINITELY  a 5-star house!! Where should I start?! My friends and I were amazed the moment that we arrived. Flor made us feel welcomed throughout our stay. She baked is cookies, gave us an orientation, and shared her stories. 

Our room had a fridge, microwave, snacks, TV and utensils. She made us a fresh pitcher of mint-mojito. YUM. She even accommodated my two friends who spontaneously decided to stay in Seattle. I contacted her the day of, and she arranged everything without making it feel uncomfortable. Mama Flor is awesome!

Her place is basically a 5-minute walk to the bus-stop (the D line), which takes you directly to Downtown Seattle. 

Seriously, Flor's place is extremely comfortable. She's really kind, and I would definitely stay again. I highly recommend her place! "
210316,29532133,2015-04-08,29462955,Mordeaci,"Flor was awesome! She picked me up at the train station when I arrived and took the time to show me around the great city of Seattle. My advice to anyone who has never traveled here, spend a couple of days at the 5 Star House and your vacation experience will be greatly enhanced because you will not only have a ""Seattle aficionado"" as a hostess you will also enjoy the city in a comfortable, private and safe environment."
210316,33046266,2015-05-24,33702220,Jo,"Flor was not there during the two nights we stayed, but Joseph welcomed us when we arrived. He was very nice and informative and helped us settle in. The room had everything you could want and/or need, and the beds were very comfortable. We had twin beds, which wasn't ideal, but that's our fault for booking so late and getting the last available room! The negative was that the bedroom was next door to kitchen (the door literally opened into the kitchen), so you could hear everything (conversations, cooking, dishwashing, even someone setting dishes on the counters!). But, when we asked them to please be quiet (after 10:30 pm), they immediately stopped making noise! I was impressed with their quick response! The other rooms were located further from the kitchen, so I'm sure they don't have the noise issue. The rest of the house was very quiet and the other people we met were very polite and friendly. We were in Seattle for a short, two night stay, with lots to do, so we were hardly at the house, except to sleep. I wish we would have had more time to interact with the owners/guests. There were many interesting photos on the walls, and it would have been interesting to get the story behind them. Oh! I forgot to mention that our room, the bathroom, and the kitchen were all very clean! They do a great job keeping the home neat and organized! I would stay there again (in a different room), if only to meet Flor! "
210316,34598498,2015-06-09,23869497,Suthen,Flor was an exceptionally hospitable host who went out of her way to make me feel welcome. The room and host are as described. 
210316,35243043,2015-06-16,3755869,Lloyd,"Flor was very hospitable and generous. I was transitioning between houses, and staying at Flor's place was perfect. All amenities were available, and I would not hesitate to stay here again. Thanks Flor!"
210316,35433558,2015-06-18,35739156,Michael,"We had a lovely stay with Flor at the 5-star house in Seattle! The interior was very brightly decorated with ""themes"" for every room. Flor explained some of her design process and we appreciated how openly passionate she was about the style and comfort of every space in the house. Our room was very comfortable, very easy access to a bathroom across the hall, and the in-room amenities were simply above-and-beyond! So many snacks and other conveniences to make us feel right at home. We also tried the Peruvian breakfast option, which was delicious! Overall, we would highly recommend this unique experience for anybody visiting Seattle."
210316,35718260,2015-06-21,3157601,Peter,"Flor was an awesome host at a great location! She was timely with correspondence and very welcoming upon arrival. The room was stocked with all sorts of things you might forget or need in a pinch, and having a fridge in the room was great too. 5 stars indeed!"
210316,38083267,2015-07-12,521712,Trevor,Flor provided a stocked fridge and toiletries. It was a hostel-style layout inside a house. 
210316,39799490,2015-07-26,8997906,Marie,"Flor has truly thought of everything! Received a wonderful warm welcome.
Bedroom had everything we could require and more. Location excellent and loved the security system in the house made us feel very safe.
One draw back room 10 is right off from the kitchen so be prepared to be woken up by people throughout the night and early morning."
210316,41400745,2015-08-07,37330260,Carla,"This was the first time I had ever used Airbnb, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I was with my 12-year-old, so I wanted something that would be accommodating to traveling with a child and it was. 
We had never been to Seattle, so we had much to explore and it was very easy to do from Flor's house. We relied on one bus line, the D line. It was the easiest thing ever. About 20 minutes to downtown Seattle. The Bus driver's were all pleasant too, so it made it easy. I also very safe to travel at night 10:30/11pm back to Flor's house. 
The room we got had two twin beds, perfect. A TV with Netflix, perfect. Microwave, big refrigerator (stocked with fruit and beverages, air conditioning...perfect. We had robes, bathroom amenities if needed (ie shampoo, personal toothpaste, soap, personal razor's deodorant, pocket combs, foot pumice). Flor would kindly straighten up the room every day. If I used dishes, she would wash them. We could also use her kitchen if wanted to, but we were out and about all day so there was no need. The bathroom was communal, but it was tidy and cleaned daily.
To sum it all up, it was a very pleasant experience and would recommend to anyone, especially anyone with children and would like to comforts from home away from home. 
Flor as the hostess was very kind. I felt like I was visiting an aunt I had never met before. On the last day, she was having a BBQ with her family and she invited us to join, but we were trying to get the last sights in. 
I wish Flor much success in her business. She's done an amazing thing coming from another country and raising a family. "
210316,41995319,2015-08-10,16465146,Jordan,"Flor is a truly hospitable person that is a lot of fun. The house was in a great location which was close to everywhere we wanted to be with a quick drive away. The room was as offered, although the heat his summer has been pretty extreme for the area, is was comfortable enough but that is mainly due to unpredictable. If your looking for a charming and open environment (with amenities) then this is your place, but lacks in true privacy. "
210316,42746213,2015-08-15,3403058,Greg,"We had a great time staying with Flor at the 5-Star House! She is so friendly, super attentive, and a great cook too! Her home is beautiful and in a really nice location. The room had everything we needed and the decorations  definitely showed some of Flor's personality. This is a one of a kind place. We would certainly stay again!"
210316,43198856,2015-08-17,41430594,Alexandra,"Flor is very welcoming and warm, it really seems like she loves having people in her home, and at no point do you feel like a burden.  She is very chatty while showing you around.  The rooms were very clean, though a bit on the busy side (lots of decor around).  The bed was soft but very comfortable - we slept very well!  When we first arrived, there were two glade plug in air fresheners which smelled very nice, but a bit too strong for my liking.  We unplugged them and tucked them away and the smell dissipated quickly.  The buses that go downtown are a very short walk away, the house is very well situated!  We parked on the street, and at no point did I worry about security."
210316,43549092,2015-08-20,7139169,Maria,"Flor was a very friendly host. Our room had its own lock, an air conditioner (hallelujah!), a fridge with snacks, water, toiletries... Everything we could possibly need. Would definitely recommend to other travelers in the north seattle area."
210316,44040195,2015-08-23,28695109,Summer Min Jin,"I loved my stay at Flor's house! My room was Hawaiian themed, and the room had everything I needed. There were pretty big bed, refrigerator, desk, chairs, TV (and Netflix), hangers, hair dryer, etc. in our room. The bed was comfortable, and my boyfriend loved the cheese in the refrigerator (Flor said we could eat it for free!). The location of the house was amazing--the bus stop for the bus to downtown is in 3 min walking distance from the house, and there is a 24-hour QFC mart near the house. I would definitely come back to her house if I visit Seattle again!"
210316,55957082,2015-12-07,1429979,Pamela,"Thank you so much Flor, for your welcome, from the immediate response to my stay request, to the chatty reception on my first night, to the pizza and movie night at your cousin's place, I feel like we are old friends already!

I can't wait to come back. The neighborhood is nice, and it is not so hard to find if you know how to use the bus system. The house is so nicely decorated, over the top cute! Thanks for the tour of the rooms :)

You're truly the hostess with the mostest!"
7745196,45526721,2015-09-03,18342445,Hubertus,"Trevor and Emily are wonderful hosts for an absolutely modern and complete apartment in a wonderful neighborhood in Seattle.
They were so caring about us, and we could ask them every question, it was like staying at home, or with good friends.
The accommodation is in a close distance to Seattle, and you can reach downtown with the very good bus system. If you´re not intending for the big city, you´ll find yourself in a nice and cool suburb, hosted by one of the nicest couples to find."
7745196,46329749,2015-09-09,25134904,Justina,"Trevor's place was awesome. Clean, bright, beautifully decorated, comfortable and cozy. It was perfect for our three-night stay in every way. It appears to have been newly renovated so we felt like one of the first guests to stay there. Location is also great, short drive or leisurely stroll to awesome restaurants, cafes, bars and shops in Fremont. Trevor was extremely welcoming, attentive and responsive, and the apartment had everything we needed. He even left us passes for local tourist attractions. The only unfortunate thing was that we weren't able to meet him in person. Next time!"
7745196,46821286,2015-09-13,27720240,Rob,"Trevor was the most responsive host I've ever run across. He went out of his way to be fast and courteous throughout the booking process. I needed a local place to put up my sister and her husband last minute, as I procrastinated actually booking something. With Trevor's help, this wasn't a disaster at all!

My sister and her husband raved about the space. They couldn't believe it was so reasonably priced and the location can't be beat. I highly recommend that anyone looking to stay in Fremont give Trevor a chance. You won't regret it!"
7745196,48009470,2015-09-22,17676720,Jeffrey,"This is a really nice little place in a great location! I stayed for about a week with my wife and 5-year-old son. Booking process was smooth and Trevor went out of his way to accommodate my son with an air mattress. The apartment is small, but the perfect size for 2-3 people. Extremely clean and well-kept with some great amenities like a dishwasher, washer/dryer, wifi, and a large flat-screen TV with Chromecast (plus a few local HD channels). The bed was comfy with plenty of blankets, and the shower was hot and had lots of pressure. Hard to beat the location as it is walking to distance to lots of great stuff around Fremont and Wallingford but also a quick trip from downtown. Bus stops are close by and an Uber/Lyft from downtown typically ran about $10-12. Very quiet neighborhood as well, and very secure with a fenced yard and keyless entry. Trevor and Emily were great hosts, and even checked in to make sure we had everything we needed during our stay. Overall, would highly recommend this place!"
7745196,48359267,2015-09-25,25096058,Carolyn,"Trevor and Molly kindly accepted my offer on very short notice and were nothing short of fantastic.  The apartment is impeccable, just as pictured and artfully decorated.  It was easy to find, access, parking was a breeze, and the walkability to Fremont is perfect.  Trevor is a total pro when it comes to communication and hosting.  I travel frequently for work and would highly recommend their apartment for work and or pleasure."
7745196,48778170,2015-09-28,42520752,Julie,"The apt was cute, very clean and in a great neighborhood. It had a great view of the city at night and was only minutes away from restaurants, shops and the University of Washington. We had no problems finding parking (huge plus).

There were a couple tiny glitches, that were out of Trevor's hands, the last day of our stay but Trevor was very responsive and accommodating which was greatly appreciated! I can't emphasize how great it was to have Trevor respond so promptly with any questions we had.

If you plan to be in the Seattle area, I would definitely recommend staying here. You won't be disappointed.

The space was as described and exactly how shown in photos. Super cute, very clean, nice design and attention to detail. The washer and dryer were extra helpful since we did a bit of hiking. Highly recommended."

7745196,54008043,2015-11-15,35253941,Christina,Trevor was a great host. Their place is lovely and exactly as pictured. It is in one of the best neighborhoods in Seattle close to great restaurants.

The house was very clean, the neighborhood is wonderful, and the hosts were very accommodating and easy to get ahold of. We plan on staying here again and would highly recommend it!"
7745196,55859879,2015-12-06,12128757,Christopher,Trevor and Emily were very nice hosts. We were unable to stay at the place we had booked instead and they answered within minutes when requesting to stay with them instead. The place was clean and well put together. We had a very enjoyable stay.

I will definitely recommend."
934123,13543591,2014-05-30,2188267,Aaron,"The host was responsive, friendly, and professional. The apartment had all the basics. It was in an apartment building that has multiple vacation rentals. It was located an easy walk to  many downtown destinations. I have to say I was completely satisfied with the place and would stay there again."
934123,19886559,2014-09-20,204255,A. Anastasia,"Jordan and Stay Alfreds were quick to respond and help. They were kind enough to accommodate our earlier arrival after a long flight. The apt is perfectly located in the heart of downtown Seattle. It is very spacious, in an apt. complex with shops, supermarkets, restaurants all around. The subway is two blocks away and the sky train about 10 minutes walk. The waterfront and the Pike market are right around the corner. We loved our stay there and would definitely recommend!"
934123,21445047,2014-10-17,22328014,Jeffrey,"Excellent communication, location and experience. Great airbnb renter"
934123,26210907,2015-02-07,18767137,Jihyun,It was a perfect position from which every hot spots of Seattle down town can be reached by a little walking. And Jordan shows his best effort to support our staying. The parking area can be a maze at first because the apartment is complex building.
934123,36133755,2015-06-25,35659836,Dan,Clean and welcoming environment. Great location!
934123,41116258,2015-08-04,4890834,Georgia,"We arrived pretty late and self-check in at the Harbor Steps was a breeze. Apartment is as described on the website. Get this place for the location! We took LINK from the airport, rode mass trans the whole time and really enjoyed Seattle. I would highly recommend this place to a family with older kids like ours. Thank you, Jordan & Stay Alfred."
934123,49034730,2015-09-30,17936704,Daniel,"Excellent location despite plenty of traffic around the building.  Bedrooms obviously have double glazing so a good nights sleep is  possible. Living room area nice and clean, but not for spending a lot of time in with excellent bars, coffee and kids activities directly downstairs.  Highly recommended for location. "

5002964,55979700,2015-12-07,2122197,Valentine,"We stayed at Rain and Desert's place for two nights. Rain and Desert were great hosts, very nice people. Place was comfortable and in good neighborhood. They even let us use their parking spot! "
227636,706512,2011-11-09,1356696,Jeanette,"Michael and Jean Louise have created a very stylish, spacious and comfortable retreat in Ballard.  My first stay with Air B n B was a hit.  I was looking for a place of my own that was walking distance to everything in Ballard and Fremont.  This place was perfectly situated between the two areas of town.  The apartment is  really spacious with a very comfortable bed and fresh flowers designed by Jean Louise.  A special highlight for colder Seattle days is a working fireplace and on sunny days a small yard out the back.

Jean Louise and Mike are really welcoming and easy going and there small son Cash is delightful.  I'll definitely go back."
227636,721672,2011-11-15,1150035,Karen,"Great very large apartment with great hosts.  The little touches were much appreciated quaility breakfast provisions provided, nice soaps and lotions in the bathroom.  This is a well decorated, comfortable and private apartment, the hosts live just upstairs but were respectful of my privacy and were also on hand to answer any questions I had and are just lovely people.  The bus to Fremont & downtown is just around the corner and the Ballard bus just a few blocks away. It is quite easy to get around without a car and it was lovely to come back to this cozy apartment at the end of the day.  Thanks Mike & Jean Louise!!"
227636,734878,2011-11-21,1360694,Amanda,"I'm very satisfied with my choice of where to stay on my trip to Seattle.  We enjoyed using all the amenities they had to offer! I found myself excited to go back and relax after a day out. I really liked that the main living room and bedroom were separate versus most hotels, so if you're an early riser you won't wake up your partner! Not only was the place great, but so were the hosts! We had all the privacy we wanted, but if we wanted or needed anything Mike & Jean Louise were there to help. I'm hoping to make another trip to stay here:) "
227636,746762,2011-11-27,1349603,Misty,I had a wonderful time at this beautifully decorated apartment. Michael and his family are sweet and friendly and the location is great! I'll definitely stay here again.
227636,856274,2012-01-11,214728,Louise,"Jean Louise and Michael were welcoming and delightful hosts. They made sure we had what we needed but respected our privacy.  The apartment was so comfortable that we simply felt that we were ""home"" every night during our 1-month stay to visit with family. 
  During the rainy cold days of December, the energy-efficient wood-burning fireplace in the living room was a real bonus that we enjoyed frequently. 
    We will not hesitate to stay again -- assuming they have a space on the calendar for us.  I have to say we hesitated to write such a glowing review, knowing it will probably mean they will be booked solid from now on."
227636,874457,2012-01-21,1512857,Heather,"As this was our first experience with Airbnb it is safe to say that Michael and his family set the bar very high.  They were so  welcoming even though we got in a little earlier than expected.  Their neighborhood and home are beautiful and we were impressed before we even saw the inside of the apartment.  Inside we found a  very spacious and comfortable living space.  Everything was very clean and most important very comfortable.  They have thought of everything a guest could need and provided very nice amenities.  
We utilized the fireplace every day and the jacuzzi tub was an awesome bonus.  
Overall they were excellent hosts and helped us out quite a bit providing information on public transportation and Michael even offered to drive us to the market in the snow.  

We would recommend this place to anybody visiting Seattle. 
"
227636,1477811,2012-06-14,1601787,Nané,We were happy to stay in Mike and Jean Louise’s apartment. We were doing internships in Seattle and stayed there for four months. We liked the neighbourhood and the hosts are very helpful.
227636,1506539,2012-06-18,2402986,Barbara,"Michael, Jean Louise and Cash were perfect hosts. The apartment was clean, roomy and well appointed. The location, halfway between Fremont and Ballard, was great. I would highly recommend this stay to anyone. "
227636,1531597,2012-06-21,2589543,Joe,"The basement apartment in Michael's family's home was a great first experience for us.  Clean, neat, many conveniences, and plenty of room for our kids to run around.  We will definitely use airbnb again and stay at this home again if the opportunity presents itself."
227636,1551158,2012-06-24,866977,Alex,"Stayed at their apartment for 2 days while visiting town for work/pleasure, it was an awesome experience! The apartment has everything you might need and is in a great location between Fremont and Ballard."
227636,1566192,2012-06-26,649472,Sven,"Mike and Jean Louise's place is exactly why I love airbnb! Great accommodation in a vibrant neighborhood with fun and interesting hosts. The apartment is clean and spacious, tastefully decorated, plenty of room for my girlfriend, her sister and I to spread out and make ourselves comfortable after spending a week on a cruise ship.

There's a nice backyard that we shared with our hosts, their adorable 4-year old Cash, and Guinness the dachshund. If you're feeling social and want to find out about some local hangouts or a general Seattle vibe, they're open to chat anytime, but if you prefer to keep to yourself, it's okay too. We happened to be there on a Sunday night when their neighbors came over for a BBQ, and hanging out and participating in the locals' life ended up being one of the highlights of our stay. 

However, being within walking distance of Ballard and Fremont, you could pretty much be gone all day and never get bored. So many great restaurants, bars and markets (yummy Veraci Pizza is just a couple of blocks up the street!). And it having been summer, just walking through the neighborhood with all the amazing flowers and vegetable gardens everywhere is a total bonus.

This is a cool place to stay. Thank you Jean Louise and Mike for making us feel like your neighbors for a weekend!"
227636,1596038,2012-06-30,879694,Chen,"Mike and Jean, together with their little son Cash, have served as excellent host. Their house is well-decorated and clean, exactly as illustrated in the photo gallery on Airbnb website. They checked with us our exact time of check-in and check-out and are very flexible and tolerant with our schedule. They are always there to help yet respect our privacy. Plus, the fireplace in the house is definitely a bonus to warm us up in this raining season. ""Cozy, convenient and artistic"", this place is definitely a perfect choice. I would highly recommend Mike and Jean's house and would love to stay there again!"
227636,1614774,2012-07-02,2215724,Erin,"This was the first time we have ever used Air BNB and we will definitely be using it again because of such a great experience.  The place was very well kept, clean, and spacious.  They have everything we could need and more for our stay.  It's was so much better than staying in a hotel because we felt like we were coming home at the end of a long day.  Mike, Jean Louise and Cash were great hosts!  They were so friendly, which just helped make our trip that much better.  We would recommend their place to anyone!"
227636,1684672,2012-07-11,2641630,Jen,"The apartment was quiet, clean, cozy, and has a very comfy bed.  Michael was incredibly accommodating!   I would not hesitate to stay here again.  "
227636,1716403,2012-07-16,202356,Maren,"This is a wonderful place to stay!  Michael and Jean Louise were so friendly and communicative, going above and beyond to help me with some special requests.  I really appreciated the organic treats, selection of bath products, and special touches like floral arrangements and organic bath towels.  This is a basement apt. so expect to hear some activity above.  The apt. itself was immaculate and very comfortable.  Would love to stay here again; it was my best airbnb experience thus far.  "
227636,1747401,2012-07-19,891299,Isabel,"Michael and his family were warm, welcoming and relaxed hosts. After camping in the woods, I enjoyed having such friendly faces available in the backyard for chatting. Their eye for design was evident in the apartment and the lovely flower arrangements in the rooms.  Overall, the place is spacious and conveniently located for exploring Ballard and the surrounding neighborhoods.  "
227636,1775398,2012-07-23,2269823,Angela,We had a great time! Michael and his family were very welcoming! Will stay again next time we're in Seattle :)
227636,1806432,2012-07-26,1962993,Amy,"We had a great stay with Michael, Jean Louise and Cash. It was like staying with friends - but without feeling like an imposition. They were welcoming and friendly and very laid-back. My son and Cash really hit it off and spent a lot of time playing together. The apartment had everything we needed for our 3-night stay - fresh eggs and butter in the fridge, plenty of kitchen items to make a meal - and we both enjoyed having our own spaces to sleep in.
 
I wish we could have stayed longer and look forward to visiting again."
227636,1824863,2012-07-28,3039849,Bryan,"This place was perfect. Very clean, great neighborhood, easy commute to downtown and excellent hosts. Michael and his family are very accommodating and a wealth of local information. I would stay here again in a moment. "
227636,1847183,2012-07-31,1547252,Amy,"Convenient, clean, private, super easy to settle into. Nice big kitchen, easy to cook in, comfortable bed. Great location for us - in the popular Freemont/Ballard area.  Easy on street parking.  Absolutely wonderful hosts, and their son Cash is a joy. Would definitely stay there again (and hope we WILL do so) and highly recommend."
227636,1872644,2012-08-02,414366,Kelly,"I had a wonderful stay at this Ballard Apartment. I was travelling for work so didn't get to spend much time hanging out, but the hosts were lovely and very helpful.  The house was immaculately clean, the bathroom has an amazing shower, and they even left me some organic eggs for making breakfast. The location is also very nice, it is a quick walk to downtown Ballard and close to a really nice running trail along the water.

Overall it was a top notch stay, I'm sure I will be back when my travels bring me to Seattle."
227636,1898377,2012-08-06,2189683,Will And Lynne,"Our stay with Michael, Jean-Louise, Cash and Guinness could not have been better.  They are such nice people (and dog) and their apartment was just the touch of home we were looking for on our trip to Seattle for a wedding.

They met us with smiles and all the information we needed for a great time.  The parking was easy on the street in front of their home.  The neighborhood is quiet and safe.  Mike and Jean-Louise had fresh eggs, half and half, juice, butter and freshly ground coffee waiting for us in the nicely appointed kitchen.  That was really a nice touch that made us feel very welcome.

The bedroom was great with a walk-in closet and a comfortable queen-size bed.  And since Jean-Louise is a florist there were beautiful flowers everywhere.

Our son slept on a very comfortable futon in the living room in front of the fireplace.

In the bathroom we enjoyed the jacuzzi tub (Cash had showed us how it worked), the rain shower head and the ample assortment of shampoos and shower gels.

We happened to arrive on some of the hottest days Seattle had this year, but the apartment stayed cool and comfortable, day and night.

We found that the location of the apartment in Ballard/Fremont was very convenient to good eats, great sights, interesting shops and all the tourist attraction ""must sees"".  Our only problem was that we didn't have enough time to do it all since we were there for the wedding of dear friends.  

We'll just have to come back...and when we do, we'll hope to stay with Mike, Jean-Louise, Cash and Guinness again."
227636,1958741,2012-08-12,2977605,Joy,"The apartment at Ballard / Fremont was a pleasure to visit. It was neat and very clean and charmingly decorated, even including fresh flowers. Our hosts were charming and thoughtful. We were able to enjoy coffee and juice on our arrival thanks to their thoughtfulness. We had everything we needed and even the luxury of a washer and drier. The neighbourhood is quiet and within easy access of the Ballard locks and gardens. We would absolutely visit again. Thank you."
227636,1980277,2012-08-14,2266840,Stephen,"We got in late and Jean Louise was very nice, accommodating, and hospitable (plus, the little boy, Cash, is awesome). The place was exactly what we were looking for, and it was very cozy and clean. Parking was plentiful, and getting in and out was easy. This was my wife and I's first AirBnb experience and it was definitely a win. "
227636,2012065,2012-08-17,3024197,Angela,"This was my first time using airbnb and I had a pleasant experience.

My friends and I had a wonderful stay with Michael, Jean-Louise, and Cash. We arrived much later than expected, but everything was ready when we got there. The apartment itself was quiet, clean, and comfortable, and our hosts were friendly and welcoming! Highly recommend their place to anyone!

(My friends and I were traveling for fun and we did not have a car, but their apartment was very close to a bus stop. Very convenient!)"
227636,2037058,2012-08-20,2297219,Vanessa,"We had a lovely stay, we have a 1 year old and we were able to set up her Graco play pen in the large walk-in closet so it was like she had her own room. It worked out really well having all the space and having a kitchen made it a lot easier than staying in a hotel. Our daughter also liked playing outside with Cash and he was so sweet to share his toys with her. "
227636,2179053,2012-09-03,969238,Alison,"The large Ballard/Freemont apartment was a perfect way to ease back into the City after a couple days of camping on the Olympic Peninsula.  I didn't get a chance to meet Mike and Jean Louise (they were off camping too) but they reached out a week in advance with all the details, and left a lovely note, restaurant/activity recommendations, and some local treats (fresh eggs and blueberries) for me in the apartment.  And the apartment is adorable, with lots of space, pretty decorations, and loads of fresh-cut flowers.  It was so welcoming!  It has a great kitchen area, super comfy bed, wi-fi, a nice, clean bathroom (with lots of shampoo/conditioner), ample street parking and laundry to boot!  It was my first experience using Air B'n'B and I couldn't have had a better one!"
227636,2330654,2012-09-18,1745204,Caroline,"Jean Louise, Mike, Cash and Guinness made us feel welcome from the outset. The apartment was clean, comfortable, spacious and well equipped including a welcome pack of some eatables to get us started.  The cut flowers were a nice touch too! Jean Louise and Mike were really helpful and couldn't do enough for us.
It was a really peaceful neighbourhood and  well situated for the bus route for Fremont and downtown. 
Would recommend without hesitation.

227636,2428894,2012-09-27,3368016,Randy,"This place was great, good location. Mike and Jean was really nice to us. I was surprise that all amenities that you really need for a long stay was provided. The house is fully equip with bedding, toiletries and kitchen equipments. What I really love most was that the cable TV have almost all the channels that I want to watch. I would love to come back again! "
227636,2529456,2012-10-07,3312836,Anna,"Two friends and I stayed at this adorable place when in town for a wedding - everything was perfect! Location is great, plenty to do within walking distance. The basement unit is cozy, with plenty of natural light and all the furnishings you'd want. "
227636,2706737,2012-10-24,658495,Ernestine,"My boyfriend, Dikkie and I stayed for four days and three nights when in Fremont for a leadership program. The apartment was great, all of the things one needs to feel welcome and at home away from home are here. Michael and Ninja Cash greeted us and got us settled in. If you are looking for a lovely place to call home while in the area stay here. We enjoyed meeting our hosts, the apartment and location.  It is evident they want to ensure you have an enjoyable stay. Other details that are great about the place: amazing comfortable bed, relaxing living room with wifi and direct TV, jet bath, coffee maker, coffee and tea selections, laundry room...You'll be happy you booked the place. We were and would stay again! "
227636,2746880,2012-10-29,2176204,Michael,"My boys and I had a relaxing weekend in this very comfortable and tasteful retreat. Michael greeted us and had everything set up nicely. I appreciate JL's floral designs around the house and in the yard. Too bad it was raining all weekend otherwise we could have taken advantage of the yard and covered patio area and had an outdoor meal, and perhaps my boys could have played with Cash in the back yard. The house was a perfect home base for our Ballard getaway and easy to get to: Golden Gardens; Ballard Locks; and the Farmer's Market. We even discovered the Greenwood area.The organic coffee and blueberries were nice amenities"
227636,2812216,2012-11-05,3828056,Usha,"My friend and I stayed for 3 nights while we were in town of a girls' weekend.  Comfy and private apartment with plenty of hot water in the shower and great water pressure.  Location was great - a decent walk to the Ballard neighborhood.  Mike and Jean Louise were very thoughtful with the small touches that make a big difference: a few breakfast essentials ready when we arrived, and a basket of toiletries for us to use during our stay.  Although we didn't have a car with us, our friend who met up with us always found a place to park when she picked us up & dropped us off."
227636,2845409,2012-11-09,1814148,Rachel,"super convenient to where I needed to be each day
breakfast food in the fridge upon arrival
everything else as described-- great spot!"
227636,2879431,2012-11-13,4001009,Abby,"We just came home from a four night stay at Michael and his family's apartment in Seattle.  It was the perfect place for our family while on vacation.  We were traveling with our four month old and having our own place was key and SO much better than having stayed in a hotel.  It was really homey, they even lent us their pack and play so we didn't have to lug ours.  Having laundry was amazing with all of  the spit ups and diaper explosions that babies have.  We used the fireplace and the jacuzzi tub to relax.  The bedroom gets very dark, which is also key with a baby. We made use of the kitchen, had coffee every morning.  They literally have everything you could need - dishes and silverware and glasses and laundry detergent, coffee, sugar - there were eggs, orange juice and half and half in the fridge when we got there.  It was very cozy and cute.  I would recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle.  "
227636,3657452,2013-03-01,3329144,Jim,"We had an incredible 3 and a half month stay at Mike's Ballard apartment. Mike and Jean Louise are warm and friendly- always around to help but respectful of our privacy. Their son Cash is chatty and fun. We are new to Seattle and used the house as a base for house-hunting. The home-buying process was stressful so it was nice to not have to worry about our temporary housing; Mike was flexible and accommodating of our ever-shifting move-out date. They even sent us off with a house-warming gift! The apartment itself is a nice size with fast internet, a million TV channels and a well-equipped kitchen. It is in a cute neighborhood- walking distance to the Ballard and Fremont commercial districts and across the street from a bus stop that goes right into downtown. We highly recommend this apartment for short and long stays."
227636,3978761,2013-04-01,1436976,Nils,It's been a great stay at Michael's apartment! Everything is just as it was described on AirBnB and we were very happy about the place itself and the location. Easy transfer to Downtown and the best starting point to explore a lovely neighborhood. Michael and his family are great hosts and we enjoyed staying with them. Thanks a lot!
227636,4098900,2013-04-09,527122,John,Lovely stay with Michael. He welcomed us with freshly baked blueberry-banana muffins. The place was clean and tidy. I would stay there again!
227636,4516996,2013-05-10,4559184,Kari,"I was moving to Seattle for work and stayed here for 1 month whilst looking for a long term apartment. The place is great! Everything you could need is there, the location is ideal and close to public transport AND the family is amazing and SUPER helpful... I HIGHLY recommend staying here."
227636,4835473,2013-05-28,5775606,Craig,Really enjoyed our stay. The apartment was comfortable and well equiped and Michael and his family were very considerate hosts. Location was great for us as it was near friends we were visiting and the Ballard area had many good restaurants and groceries close by. We had a car and our trips into downtown were pretty quick. Definitely a place we would stay again should we get back to Seattle.   
227636,4907193,2013-06-01,6245328,Ariana,"We stayed three nights in this lovely apartment. The area was great, plenty of parking on the street. The family was very welcoming and willing to answer any of our questions. Mike and Jean Louise were so friendly and their son was very sweet. The place very comfortably accommodated three adults. Little touches like orange juice and eggs and coffee in the fridge for us were so thoughtful and appreciated. I would absolutely stay there when passing through Seattle again and would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a comfortable and homey apartment. "
227636,4942728,2013-06-03,6155698,Alexis,"We had a great 2-night stay in Michael and Jean Louise's apartment. The location is fantastic with east access to Ballard, Fremont and Wallingford. The apartment itself was very comfortable and homey with everything we needed over the course of the weekend. We were traveling with our 4-month-old daughter and they provided a pack-n-play for our use (as those who travel with children know, the less stuff you have to lug around the better!) Michael and Jean Louise were great - welcoming without being over bearing and always ready with answers to our questions or recommendations on places to check out. We'll definitely be back!"
227636,5079094,2013-06-11,5658608,Gina,"We had a wonderful time on our visit to Seattle and staying at the Allen's home was perfect for us! The neighborhood is idyllic and the company was great! It was nice to visit with them and our son had so much fun playing with their son - who is probably the coolest 5yr old I know!
I highly recommend staying here if you need a place to stay while in the Seattle area. The restaurants in the area are unforgettable as well. Thank you to Michael, jean-Louise and cash for the great visit.
Gina, Jeremy, and Aidan "
