175576,38826506,2015-07-19,30907256,Jeanette,"look no further! Ray and Eileen's place is all you need! They are in the perfect spot - a block or two from the bus stop that takes only minutes to go to all the main attractions. Place is clean, neighborhood is safe and quiet, and Ray and Eileen leave refreshments,some snacks and a ton of trip guides for you :) we had the pleasure of speaking with Ray once or twice and learned they have lived in their home since college, I believe he said! Definitely shows their love for Seattle! (Sidenote: I don't even really need to leave a review - just look at their page, they have such a large fan base already! Aka Stay here!) "
175576,39378702,2015-07-23,32013816,Dianna,"Ray and Eileen were very friendly, welcoming and super informative regarding the area and things to do. The apartment was just as listed and located in a great area!"
175576,39903715,2015-07-27,18930919,Anke,"Ray & Eilen sind sehr freundliche und hilfsbereite Gastgeber. Die Wohnung befindet sich in einer sehr schönenen Wohngegend. Sie ist groß und sauber, ist jedoch sehr voll gestellt und hat, da sie im Keller liegt, auch ein wenig diesen Kellergeruch. Ansonsten waren wir sehr zufrieden."
175576,40250035,2015-07-29,33987860,Peter,Ray & Eileen were great! The place has everything you need and more and is in a great location. They were super friendly and helpful. 10/10 would stay again.

Thanks so much Ray & Eileen 
We will be back soon

175576,41352131,2015-08-07,34404394,Rachel,"We did not get to meet Ray, but Eileen was a great host and we really enjoyed our stay in Seattle! Queen Anne is a great neighborhood with many shops and restaurants within walking distance. All the major attractions of Seattle are also within a couple mile distance and walkable. However, I would suggest getting an uber back from the space needle up the Queen Anne hill. It only cost about $5. Your legs will thank you! The suite is only about 4 blocks from Kerry park for some amazing views of the skyline!"
175576,43453939,2015-08-19,20846650,Melissa,"My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay at Ray and Eileen's guest suite located in Queen Anne.  The place was cute and charming - just like our hosts!  We loved the location, and the bed is one of the most comfortable beds we've ever slept in - perfect after a full day of climbing the hills of Seattle :)  We would definitely stay again!  Highly recommended!

175576,43703568,2015-08-21,37039633,Dan,Loved this place.  Felt so comfortable here.  Very clean.  Very quiet.  Very friendly hosts.  Great location.  Top notch!
175576,44709384,2015-08-28,41281450,Karen,"We were greeted by Ray upon our arrival. He was very helpful. The apartment was cozy. The neighborhood map with places to eat, etc were all mapped out for us. This was a great feature. Plus, there were numerous tourist brochures for things to see and do to look over.  If you haven't done your homework about this town, these might help. The VHS tape library was a neat touch, stocked with a Seattle themed movie or two. And having a kitchen and a Trader Joes in the neighborhood made for a nice night at ""home"".  We enjoyed the location and hospitality of our hosts!"
175576,45065549,2015-08-31,19512221,Jennifer,"Ray gave us a warm welcome when we arrived and also a tour of the suite. There were refreshments in the fridge, snacks on the kitchen bar, and all sorts of magazines and guides on things to do in Seattle. The suite was exactly as described in the listing, and there were helpful signs with information on the suite and maps of the neighbourhood. It was a warm and cozy place to stay for 3 nights and it had a nice layout with a great amount of space for 2 people. I also had a nap on the couch and it was super comfortable! The neighborhood was amazing and a quick drive or bus ride to downtown. Ray gave us recommendations for good eats on Queen Anne and I wish our trip had been longer so we could have tried more! We said a quick farewell to Ray when we checked out and gave back the day parking pass. We absolutely loved this place for our trip and would definitely come here again! "
175576,45387845,2015-09-02,1642151,Becki,We enjoyed staying in this cozy basement apartment while we were in Seattle. Ray made us feel very welcome when we arrived. They provided everything that we could possibly need during our stay. We really appreciated having parking right out front.
175576,45728986,2015-09-05,5386313,Camille,"Great People, great location, fantastic bed! So nice, we even had a selection of beverages for our liking in the fridge and some snacks. Will definitely be back when we are in town again. Thanks"
175576,46113773,2015-09-08,11887012,Rob,"Ray and Eileen were fantastic hosts, everything was ready on our arrival and exactly as stated on the ad, I'd definitely stay there again. There was plenty of room to relax after walking Seattle all day!"
175576,46572499,2015-09-12,26757784,Andy,Had a great time at Seattle and Ray & Eileen hospitality was warm and open. Great place to stay and would recommend to anyone. You have your own private access and they are great host. The apartment is in a great location with easy access to shops and downtown. 
175576,47046441,2015-09-15,38204070,Barbara,"I would highly  recommend  staying with Ray and Eileen.  Ray was very warm and engaging  and made us feel right at home. Their home is lovely and the apartment  we stayed in was just perfect for us! It was a very short walk to some excellent  restaurants , grocery and shopping in queen anne. Queen Anne is a very safe area of Seattle,  and not far from all the touristy  areas as well. We definitely  be staying there again."
175576,47294893,2015-09-17,37290457,Kaho,very nice place to stay.
175576,48899230,2015-09-29,41837087,Timothy,"Ray and Eileen communicated with me very well to make sure I got settled into the apartment.  They left instructions telling me how to get in if they happened to be gone when I arrived.  They were home when I got there, and both of them were very gracious and friendly hosts.  They showed me the things I needed to know about, and even provided some beverages for me in the fridge and energy bars on the counter.  Everything I needed was right there, with a complete kitchen, bath with a nice shower, and a very comfortable bed.  The apartment suited me very well, with a great location just north of downtown Seattle.  It's also a terrific walking neighborhood, with tremendous views of the city and Sound just a short distance away.  Ray and Eileen have provided numerous resources in the apartment to familiarize guests with the area and things to do.  I locked myself out within minutes of arriving and Ray's warm attitude helped me to feel like less of a goof for doing so.  I'm sure that he and Eileen are equally helpful with any of their guests' needs.  When I return to the Seattle area I will first check the availability of this nice Queen Anne apartment.  "
175576,49226449,2015-10-02,4549562,Sarah,"I felt completely welcome from the moment I arrived at Ray and Eileen's apartment. Queen Anne is a great neighborhood, and the apartment was nice and comfy and completely as described."
175576,49480759,2015-10-04,35929369,Lu,"We stayed in basement, which has rear door to enter. So you have totally private space. Kitchen, laundry,bath room, bedroom are all cute. Location is perfect. We walked to Kerry park and space needle. Had a short farewell to Ray."
175576,51770032,2015-10-24,4328870,Rosalie,"We very much enjoyed Ray and Eileen's place on Queen Ann hill! We arrived rather late in the evening and Ray was very nice to give us a quick tour of the house and suggest some nice places for dinner. The list of eateries, cafes and other places of interest in the neighborhood was also very handy! Queen Ann hill is a great neighborhood in itself, and it's easy to get to the rest of the city. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends!"
175576,52066898,2015-10-26,10103404,Ann,"I enjoyed meeting both Ray and Eileen.  They were friendly and welcoming.  The apartment was very convenient, quiet and clean.  It came with a guest parking pass, which was so helpful.  Ray left juice, beer, water and soda in the frig--a nice touch!"
175576,52872545,2015-11-02,45834760,Katherine,Ray greeted us when we arrived and was a super friendly and helpful host. He took time to answer all our questions and showed us around the apartment. The apartment was cozy and convenient!
175576,53287936,2015-11-07,2925697,Venita,"Great location, very private and clean. Ray was an excellent host! The bed was comfy and the space was cozy. There is s kitchen and laundry which is wonderful!"
175576,53493452,2015-11-09,7761458,Kristin,"We easily found the home, thanks to the excellent directions. Ray greeted us enthusiastically and did everything to make us feel welcome. The apartment is very well equipped with just about anything you could imagine to make the visit comfortable. It is very close to public transport, so you would not need a car. You can walk to Seattle Center in 20 minutes.  And many neighborhood places to eat."
175576,54253712,2015-11-17,36475698,Tanya,"What a treat to be met by Ray and Eileen upon arrival!  Ray helped with luggage, gave a great orientation to the place, and we all shared a nice chat!  I felt like I was staying with family!  The place was just as it appears in photos and perfectly located in the Queen Anne neighborhood.  A lovely neighborhood and an easy drive to Seattle Pacific University."
175576,54955218,2015-11-25,3772013,Kenny,Very welcoming and enjoyed the stay and location a lot. We even extended our stay after the first day :)
7902268,44722760,2015-08-28,25958107,Vadim,Host was very kindly :) Everything was perfect :) I recommends this apartment for everybody who loves calm :)
7902268,48151798,2015-09-23,43546592,Rafael,"Felt very welcome. I'm a very private person and was not made to feel as though I had to interact with anyone. Got a tour by the young lady running the home, and she was always available for questions and very pleasant. Home is looked after well and things were as the ad suggested. Dario was quick to get back with me whenever I needed to extend my stay or make alterations with it. To me, having the one bathroom was never an issue because you get to know the schedule of others in the home by simply observing the comings and goings, and planning accordingly. "
7902268,50243632,2015-10-10,45781719,Moritz,Perfect place to stay to visit the city! Very nice and clean rooms and very good support by Amanda 
7902268,50719661,2015-10-13,27764032,Jutta,Such a nice place. It was clean and very quite.  I had a lot of time to enjoy and chill. 
7902268,51577110,2015-10-21,38381680,Mary,"the house is cozy, quiet and clean. staying in this room had its advantages and disadvantages. The advantages: the bed is very comfortable perfect for after a long day, and a good size room. another good thing is that it is that the bath and kitchen are next to the room, no need to go through the house. the disadvantages, although the closed door you can heard when the bathroom door its been closing and when people are talking in the kitchen (this mainly in the morning)
In general is a good place to stay"
7902268,53087143,2015-11-04,39113726,James,This place was lovely. Lovely room and a very comfortable bed. The house is beautiful with an amazing bathroom. I have no complaints about this place. Will definitely stay here again. 
7902268,53165668,2015-11-05,47069001,James,"I met Dario's host Amanda very briefly, however her actions left a big impact! I was very last minute in my reservation and showed up at a somewhat late hour (whoops!), however she was extremely accomadating and friendly! She showed me the house, explained everything I would need to know and had tons of information about the surrounding area. I felt right at home and had an amazing nights sleep. I wouldn't hesitate to stay again!"
7902268,53636343,2015-11-10,2141679,Robert,"The house was nice, clean and in a great location near the airport. "
7902268,53905668,2015-11-14,32907303,Si Hui,"My friend Sharon and I found Dario's place to be very clean and comfortable, although Dario wasn't on site to meet us, his mum Olga was there and she was the friendliest and nicest person ever! We had a great time there and really enjoyed our stay. Our room was convienient on the ground floor, and within walking distance to a bus stop (bus 7 takes you all the way to downtown Seattle)."
7902268,54158129,2015-11-16,21215653,Christina,My stay at Dario was very pleasant! It was my first Airbnb experience and I will most definitely be back here if I'm ever in Seattle again. I did a short weekend trip in Seattle and needed a central place to stay. I didn't want to bother with a hotel since my trip was short and I would honestly just need a place to sleep and shower. For the price and location it was awesome! It's a short 20 min uber ride to downtown. The house was clean and neat. Dario wasn't there but his mom was at the house hosting myself and others staying in the house. It was easy to get in and out of the house and communication with was awesome! Stay here if you're looking for a safe place! 
7902268,54766711,2015-11-23,28937438,Medora,"Can't recommend this host highly enough! This was our first time trying out Airbnb and we were blown away by the cleanliness of the room, the convenience of things like bathroom, kitchen, etc., and of course, the simplicity of Airbnb itself. Great experience."
7902268,55505505,2015-12-01,42206037,채윤,"It was awesome.
Thr bed is very comfy and also every facilities is all clean and nice.
I wad really satisfied."
8597687,48978278,2015-09-29,6097333,Karen,William and his mother Helen were so kind and welcoming to me even though I booked last minute. I was their first guest and they had a few things to still get in room but we're so accommodating. 
8427227,52605267,2015-10-31,43455380,Sourish,This was a very neat and tidy place with great amenities. The apartment was supplied with everything that was needed. Jenell was very nice and was easy to reach. Definitely recommend this place
8427227,55808900,2015-12-06,14320061,Em,Description was very accurate and the location was perfect for accessing the convention centre and major shopping areas. Fully outfitted with comfortable (double) bed. Please be aware that parking is not included in the rates. The 40th floor provides a social space with views all around.
8427227,56068415,2015-12-08,34227822,Sebi,"Perfect location to explore the city of seattle. Bring a good pair of walking shoes as you are in walking distance of lots of good shopping and restaurants. Very fast responses and the unit had everything i needed. The washer and dryer were a plus, and after a long day exploring the city it was nice to be able to pop on Netflix and plan the next day on the easy to access wifi."
8427227,56212457,2015-12-10,1001726,Debra,"Another fantastic Seattle host in my go-to downtown Seattle AirBNB spot. Super-fast internet, a comfortable bed, a massive TV, and a nice view. What more could you ask for? Jen is fantastic to communicate with as well. Not to be missed if you need a nice, cozy spot downtown for not a lot of green. 

Malcolm (of Debra and Malcolm)"
8427227,58112653,2015-12-31,30025812,Ambur,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
430453,4247468,2013-04-22,2590414,Carrie Lou,"this was a lovely space, a great walking distance from the Convention Center & fabulous Capitol Hill spots: Melrose Market, restaurants, coffee shops. Mark was a great host- communicative and flexible. Highly recommended! "
430453,4478614,2013-05-07,724785,Crystal,"Could not have asked for a more perfect location. Accommodations were exactly as pictured. 
Mark + Mary were excellent hosts. The google maps with their favorite places was an awesome addition. They even had a few goodies waiting for me upon arrival. Seamless experience! "
430453,4938283,2013-06-03,1397508,Laura,"What a great host!  The apartment looked like a magazine feature, and Mark left me a bottle of wine, fresh flowers, an aeropress, and lots of discounts for Lyft and Seattle attractions.  He was super sweet when I arrived.  The apartment building is in a fantastic location and has a super cool old Otis elevator with a cage, which is a cool touch.  The other tenants were very friendly and polite (held the door for me and said hello every single time).  If I return to Seattle any time soon, I'm so going to request Mark's place again.  Thanks Mark!"
430453,5517592,2013-07-03,7079681,Melinda,"Went to Seattle to visit my son and unbeknownst to me, it was a parade weekend and everything was booked. I discovered this after buying my plane ticket! So I turned to airbnb and found Mark's listing. It was an awesome apartment with all the amenities that made it feel like home. Mark was a great communicator, provided local information and advice. This is a great space for 1-2 people and you can expect your stay to be comfortable. On the whole the apartment complex was quiet and had a mature, professional atmosphere. Thanks Mark!"
430453,5907527,2013-07-22,5926895,Elizabeth,"Mark was a wonderful host for this awesome apartment! Near to many great restaurants, bars and shops and easily accessible to other neighborhoods, the place is bright, clean, and spacious. We loved having a ""home base"" with so much character and charm during our recent trip and would highly recommend Mark and Mary's place!"
430453,6112246,2013-07-30,316304,Rui,"Mark's apartment is very nice and the view really is spectacular.  We stayed over a weekend, and very much enjoyed being able to walk everywhere we needed to in Capitol Hill and downtown.  I've found that generally there's not too many options of places to stay in Cap Hill, but I'm very glad we found this place!"
430453,6429384,2013-08-12,1030916,Noah,"Mark (and Mary!) were great! Always quick to communicate, and gave great local recommendations. The apartment was centrally located, very clean, and with amazing sunset views! Couldn't have asked for a better start to our trip. Highly recommended!!"
430453,6623246,2013-08-19,7363912,Michael,"Mark had a great apartment in an awesome location for our first Seattle visit. It was in a quaint old building and was well equipped with everything we needed to make our stay easy and relaxing. He welcomed us with coffee, a  bottle of wine, and plenty of awesome suggestions for our stay. He was a great host! Definitely recommend staying at his place! "
430453,7032848,2013-09-04,6124752,Mike,"Mark's place is fantastic - only a short distance from downtown and Pike Place Market - public transport, supermarkets, and some great bars and cafes are also very close. He was a great host, welcoming us with a bottle of wine and even some complimentary local beers before leaving us to it. Would definitely stay again if we come back to Seattle!"
430453,8155879,2013-10-18,1572562,Nicki,"Great location, super cute apartment. Perfect for our trip! The hosts were kind enough to leave a welcome note and snacks for us, which was a lovely touch. Definitely recommend to others!"
430453,10682386,2014-03-03,271104,Andrew,"Lovely place in a charming building. Very much enjoyed the view on the mountains and the  water as I ate breakfast. Mark and Mary were terrific hosts, very accessible and helpful. Clean and tidy apartment. Ideal location if you want to stay close to downtown. Close to terrific restaurants. Felt very safe. I hope I can stay there again quite soon. And if you're doing an event at the Convention Center, you're crazy to choose a hotel over this."
430453,11248564,2014-03-26,7265075,Sina,"When walking into the space it looked better than the photos. Great view and they had wine and snacks ready for us when we arrived. After a long day of traveling that was very sweet of them to do along with a personal note. 

The location is great and seattle has a ton of Ubers which is really nice to take for site seeing. 

We couldn't ask for anything more... the place is the best Airbnb we have every stayed in! "

430453,14130413,2014-06-12,5705873,Adam,"This was one of the nicest Air BNB experiences I've had. Mark met us when we checked in, and was very friendly. He showed us around the place. It was cozy and nice (definitely felt like a home), there was a lot of food (and even a bottle of wine!), great view, comfy bed, comfy sofa, EXCELLENT location (in between Capitol Hill and the tech sector, walkscore 95). Would definitely stay again."
430453,14362689,2014-06-17,5098361,Kristin,"Mark was a great host.  His apartment is in an awesome location in Capitol Hill.  The building was super cool and well-maintained.  We had a car while we were there and it was easy to get around the city from Mark's apartment.  We could walk downtown, to the Space Needle, and Lake Union from his place.  Just wear your tennies for the hills.  Mark was accommodating.  His apartment was clean and very welcoming.  The pictures in his listing are exactly how the apartment is set up.  I would stay with Mark again!  The views from the apartment are stellar.  Mark is a great host and staying with him in Seattle would be a guaranteed nice stay. "
430453,14645726,2014-06-23,1471428,Nathan,"Wonderful experience here.  The place is lovely and the location is unbeatable.  Capitol Hill is a great neighborhood for visitors.  It's close enough to the downtown touristy but far enough away at the same time.  Lots of good food, bars and coffee shops. 

The apartment is spacious, clean and has a great view of the city.  Mark and Mary were fantastic hosts.  Very generous and accommodated our late arrival time without any issues.  

Definitely recommend the place.  "
430453,15191006,2014-07-04,1579417,Scott,"This place is in a great location right in the middle of a trendy area just outside of downtown. Plenty of really good coffee shops and restaurants are all around.

Mark was a great host and made sure we were well taken care of. He provided some great recommendations for the area and was readily available if we had any questions.

Thanks again for the stay Mark, we really enjoyed it!"
430453,15552028,2014-07-11,4597013,Joe,We stayed at Mark's place in July. Mark was on time and very communicative. The apartment is in an older character building and the apartment building its self was very quiet. It is in a great location with lots of restaurants. Our favorite was the Pie Bar just around the corner on Olive. There were a couple challenges though. The bed is rather small it is not a queen size so if you need a little more room be aware. It was Hot and we had to leave the windows open because there is no fans or A/C. Because the windows were open it was very noisy and made it hard to sleep. When the windows are closed it is quiet. There is no cable so you have no tv to watch. There is Pandora hooked up to the tv so you can listen to music. The dropping off of keys/leaving couldn't have been easier.
430453,15774649,2014-07-15,10192891,Sang-Youp,"We stayed at Mark's place for 5days.
The location works great for us. It was located in excellent neighborhood and many good restaurants and cafes were around. The place was very clean and has an amazing view!

Mark was a great host. He was very responsive to my messages. 
We really appreciate how he was so flexible about check-in and check out time according our flight schedule. 

I definitely want to stay in Mark's place if I travel to Mark's place!"
430453,15930611,2014-07-18,17693356,Rebecca,"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle. Great location, apartment, and view. Mark and Mary were lovely and helpful hosts. Highly recommend!"
430453,16083993,2014-07-22,479857,Karin,"My Husband and I were visiting our son who lives close by.  Mark and Mary are charming and were kind to meet us on arrival. The Apartment is very conveniently located in a trendy neighbourhood, easy walk to downtown, fantasitc restaurants, cafes, bars, shops all just steps away.   The apartment is well appointed with everything you need, and comforable.  The kitchen is small but has everything, we found that there was no need to cook because there are so many great places to eat, and at every price level.  We had a great time and hope we can stay again. "
430453,16563051,2014-07-29,2707300,Sam,"Probably one if the best hosts we have met through this service. We had a delay at the airport and arrived nearly 2 hours later than we hoped and still Mark was pleasant and cheerful and so acclimating.  He left us plenty of towels, closet space, umbrellas, wine and snacks! The apartment is conveniently located in a great walker friendly neigh old with amazing views.  They have great taste in decor and the apartment was Sooo clean! Not a spec of dirt or dust. If we visit Seattle again, we hope to stay here. "
430453,16786148,2014-08-02,7680,Jim,"Great host, great place, great location!  Mark went out of his way to enable me to check in earlier than planned, which I really appreciated."
430453,16988342,2014-08-05,12489680,Brendan,"Mark was an excellent host.  He met us and answer questions while giving us a tour.  His restaurant recommendations helped tremendously while deciding among all the great highly Yelp rated eateries within walking distance.  Lastly he was available if we had any questions about getting around or checking out.

The apartment was perfect for my wife and my weekend in Seattle.  Much more homey and comfortable than a hotel, and a tremendous view of the Space Needle lit up at night.  The neighborhood is great, fantastic restaurant choices within walking distance, both affordable and fancy.  It's even walking distance to the Pike Place Market!

If you're looking for a place in downtown Seattle, this is a great option.  Walking distance to tourist attractions, just up the road from the Convention Center, with views of the Space Needle, I highly suggest it."
430453,17119579,2014-08-07,13045733,Kt,Mark was a fantastic host and made me feel very welcome in his apartment. We had a great stay and would definitely crash in his pad in the future!
430453,17355769,2014-08-11,17123842,Jess,"Absolutely perfect place to stay in Seattle!! The home is in a cool building with amazing views of downtown. We arrived at night and got to see the city and Space Needle lit up from the living room- during the day the view is just as spectacular. Apartment is as noted, walkable to all of the great things Seattle has to offer (downtown, Pike Place, and we even walked to the Space Needle), and in a really great neighborhood. We frequented a few of the nearby coffee shops during our visit in the mornings. Most importantly, Mark and Mary were super hosts. They met us at the apartment to show us around and make some recommendations in the area, and just made us feel really welcome. We couldn't have asked for a better experience. "
430453,17693636,2014-08-16,17861708,Sue,"Mark was helpful and gracious from the very first contact.  Very easy to work with.  We enjoyed the apartment, felt like part of the neighborhood.  It was as described and pictured, very comfortable. 
 It was handy to do some laundry in the laundry room before our cruise, but remember you need quarters.  Capitol Hill is a wonderful, progressive neighborhood, central to everything.  Really easy to get around, used uber cars when we could not walk.  Public transportation was also very easy (see website) and super cheap for seniors!
Mark and Mary, thank you for helping to make our visit to Seattle so special."
430453,18119409,2014-08-22,218026,Thy,"Mark's downtown apartment was bright and clean, with a brilliant view of the Seattle skyline. We loved its close proximity to the wonderful restaurants of the Melrose Marketplace, and while the walk to central department stores and Pike Place market was a healthy distance, it helped us work up a vigorous appetite."
430453,18321774,2014-08-25,12131831,Jason & Crystal,Mark was a great host.  His Capital Hill apartment had lots of charm and was conveniently located within walking distance to all of the major tourist sites in Seattle.  The neighborhood itself had several great bars and restaurants as well.  We would definitely stay at Mark's place again on a return trip to Seattle.
430453,18781251,2014-09-01,12246364,James,"The apartment was great. We stayed for an entire week & it was set up perfectly for what we needed. Very quiet yet still an easy 10 min walk into downtown & right in the middle of a buzzing area full of great coffee shops, bars, restaurants & shops. Loved the views of the city & could've spent much more time just gazing out the window if not so busy. Excellent value & highly recommended."
430453,19212094,2014-09-08,19484448,Daniel,"Mark was a great host. He was very flexible with check-in and check-out times, gave us a tour when we arrived, gave suggestions for nearby dining, and left us a bottle of wine! The location was very convenient for walking or taking public transit. The apartment was clean and comfortable. There was some light city noise, but with a fan on it did not disrupt our sleep. Overall we had a great time!"
430453,19534517,2014-09-14,19539630,Philip,"Mark and his wife Mary's apartment was awesome for our style vacation. It was not only much more affordable than hotels, but we just felt like we (my fiancé and I) were staying at our friends place and they were just out of town. Apartment was in fantastic location and had excellent bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and Ice-cream all within walking distance. Could also walk all over Seattle to public market , space needle, waterfront, pioneer square, etc. We would stay again and would recommend it to anyone . Thanks Mark and Mary - we had a great time!"
430453,19758066,2014-09-17,284214,Daniel,"Mark is fantastic host. He was very welcoming and told us about his favorite spots to grab a sandwich, coffee and drink. The listing is in a very convenient location! Downtown sights are only a short walk away but even more importantly it is right next to the Pike/Pine Triangle which will offer you a large selection of great restaurants and bars. Enjoy!"
430453,20025036,2014-09-22,20010004,Anna,"You must stay here! You can gaze at the views from the lounge windows (of downtown including the Space Needle) for hours. The apartment is great, really funky and has everything you need for a city stay, including a proper kettle which we English really appreciated! Location is great too, on the lower edge of Capitol Hill only 20mins walk down to Pike Place Market and about the same to Lake Union. It was easy to get back to the airport too, 15mins walk downhill to Westlake Station.
Mary met us at the apartment and gave us useful info about the local area, she was really lovely. Communication with Mark about the booking was great too. Lovely couple :) We would definitely stay here again and happily recommend it to anyone."
430453,20617377,2014-10-02,21180826,Omar,Great view. Perfect location. Very clean and charming space.  Mark was very accommodating. Definitely would stay again.
430453,21153995,2014-10-12,16598314,Kara,"What a wonderful place to stay! The location and view were incredible! The house felt like a home- warm and inviting! We walked from the apartment to capital hill, downtown Seattle, pike place market and everywhere in between without difficulty. Mark was a gracious host! He was in contact with us whenever we needed him! He allowed us to check in early without hesitation! Thank you for sharing your space with us!"
430453,21441672,2014-10-17,13462518,Jad,"The listing is exactly as described; spacious, clean, comfortable, lots of light, very well located. The neighbourhood is great, a short walk away from most attractions of interest and is surrounded by delicious coffee houses and great restaurants. Mark was always available to answer questions - very hospitable. Highly recommended ! "
430453,21886084,2014-10-26,1737675,Hollis,"Mark's place was perfect for our quick trip to Seattle for a friend's wedding. He and Mary were actually out of town, but they arranged for their friend Jon to let us in, which was communicated well and worked out just fine. Jon was very courteous and communicative, as I'm sure Mark would have been if he'd been available.

As for the place, it was wonderful. It was centrally located - we were able to walk to the Columbia Tower Pike Place and do some sightseeing. It was comfortable and had amazing views of the city. Thank you for a wonderful time in Seattle!"
430453,22091074,2014-10-29,22883855,Lindsey,"Mark's place on Bellevue was perfection for my business trip. I could walk in to work downtown, and walk to Taylor's to get oysters. The building has charm and character as does the apartment. Very welcoming - I will definitely stay again."
430453,22500662,2014-11-08,13247989,Mark,"My wife and I had a great time at Mark and Mary's place. It was easy to coordinate our arrival with them, and the apartment was clean and in a great location close to lots of restaurants and bars. We would stay there again!"
430453,23604223,2014-12-06,7421402,Andrew,Second stay.  All went well again.  Will visit again.
430453,23848969,2014-12-12,22883855,Lindsey,"Another fabulous stay at what's starting to feel like my home away from home in Seattle. Mark's place is perfect for the traveling professional, as it's conveniently located to some of the best food, shopping and culture in the city. As expected, the digs were clean and cozy - highly consistent experience. It's nice to not have to worry about the quality of this rental. "
430453,24506210,2014-12-29,10574145,Mo,The place was clean and neat and in a very good location. I would recommend this place to my friends. 
430453,24760485,2015-01-02,24425418,Maggie,"Our experience with Mark and this place was absolutely amazing! My boyfriend and I decided to spend NYE in Seattle (we live in CA) so we were looking for a place with a nice view that included the space needle. The place is nicely decorated, comfortable and has a lot of charm, we felt right at home. The place has everything you need, it is on the smaller side, but the pictures are very representative of the space. We were able to cook an entire NYE worthy meal without any problems, and the view was STUNNING!!! We saw the space needle fireworks without a problem and saw a beautiful sunset the next day over the Pike Place sign. Mark was also great at giving us some ideas and recommendations on places to eat, visit, and shop. We really enjoyed the area and his local recommendations were great. We even ran into him having dinner at one of his favorite Caribbean food restaurants. We would definitely stay here again!"
430453,26040263,2015-02-02,258762,Kimberly,The reservation was canceled 25 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
430453,45065783,2015-08-31,30238160,Jamie,"Mark was an awesome host! He worked around our schedule, gave us good restaurant recommendations, and was very accommodating. The place was right in Capitol Hill and we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. My boyfriend and I visited Seattle for the Pax Prime 2015 convention and it was the perfect location! Just a 5 minute walk. We spent most of our stay out and about but I also would have been happy staying in the apartment and people watch with a cocktail. The old building was very charming and we would love to stay there again. Thank you Mark!"
430453,45944530,2015-09-07,4819950,Alana,"Mark was very accommodating to our late check in time. Good communication and easy check in/check out process. Central location at a great price. 

There are a few computers and desks in the living room, and a completely different living room furniture set, which is not shown in the listing pictures. We weren't in the apartment that much, so we barely noticed it. We visited on a very cold weekend, and it was quite cold in the bedroom at night. It is an old building, with building controlled heating, so its likely the building did not turn on heat for the building yet in September. Bathroom and kitchen could definitely be cleaner, but other than that and the lack of heat, it was a good stay! "
430453,46482181,2015-09-11,36143031,Kathryn,"Cute apartment within walking distance of anything you could want/need, including bars, restaurants, shopping, and of course, plenty of coffee shops. Only a $5 uber from downtown. I especially loved how close the Starbucks Reserve was and went there more than once to get their shakerato! The living room is a bit more cramped than the pictures show as there are desks and chairs to one side, but they were not an inconvenience. Perfect place for one person or a couple, but I wouldn't recommend trying to spend too many nights on that futon. The check in and check out process was simple and flexible which we appreciated. It is an old building with an old elevator but we found the place clean, organized, and perfectly situated. Thanks for having us Mark!"
4258762,22051552,2014-10-28,3282178,Michael,"Julia was a responsive and gracious host. Her apartment was just like the photos and proved a pleasant space to come home to.  I stayed here while in Seattle for work and the apartment was perfect with a large and bright kitchen and comfortable living spaces. Everything was clean and neat, and Julia's apartment is full of charm including original artwork and full of space and light. She was immediately responsive and helpful in making recommendations for the local area. I highly recommend this location. The Walllingford strip, QFC, shops and restaurants and farmer's market are all step away. It's central to everything Seattle and Julia's apartment is awesome."
4258762,28065033,2015-03-16,4325061,Ali,Julia was an amazing host. She made my boyfriend and I feel very welcome in her place. Her place is sparkling clean and a really nice space with lots of natural light and wood floors. I would definitely recommend it!
4258762,28353002,2015-03-22,4359637,Dan,"Julia's apartment was great - clean, comfortable and a great location. Communication was easy and the check-in/check-out process was extremely simple. I'd be happy to stay here again. "
4258762,28593925,2015-03-26,24049999,Patrice,"Julia was. Friendly host! She was available to answer any questions we had via email, she was prompt and hosted us even though we submitted a request a bit last minute. Her home was wonderful and quaint with a lovely kitchen. The only draw backs were the lack of wifi and the neighbors got a little noisy at night, other than that a great listing and a nice place to stay while in Seattle."
4258762,28676855,2015-03-28,958832,Lauren,"Julia was awesome. She let us check in early, gave us a quick rundown of the place, and then let us be. Her place is just as adorable as the photos and the location was perfect. Beautiful neighborhood and an easy walk to anything you would need. Julia was very easy to get a hold of if we had any questions. Would definitely recommend this place!!"
4258762,28846880,2015-03-30,1295336,Sarah,"Julia's place is really bright, spacious, clean, and in a great neighbourhood with lots of good cafes and restaurants within walking distance.  A lovely character apartment with lots of charm.  She was really easy to communicate with, and check-in and out was easy.  If we come back to Seattle, I wouldn't hesitate to book this apartment again!"
4258762,29004468,2015-04-02,26880012,Laura,"Julia was very responsive in all of our communications.  

The location was excellent, great restaurants and bus access.  We were going to visit UW and it was very easy to take a quick bus there from right around the corner.  The apartment was as it looks in the photos.  It's a pretty old building so don't expect anything fancy, but it's functional.

I never actually met Julia as she wasn't available when we arrived but she left the keys for us.  Unfortunately the two small problems we had she wasn't able to respond to quickly enough to resolve (wi-fi and a plumbing problem)  but I think that's just the way it is with AirBnb.  "
4258762,30746622,2015-04-26,16397677,Matthew,"Julia was a great host, clear and timely communication throughout. Check-in was made easy, her place was clean and ready and in a PERFECT location!  I highly recommend Julia and her Wallingford apartment, I'd definitely stay there again."
4258762,32423876,2015-05-17,15278637,Susan,"Julia was kind, considerate, and responsive. Julia's apartment is warm and welcoming, and the description is accurate. My schedule did not allow me to spend much time at the apartment, but when I was there it was comfortable and peaceful.

The location was just right, Wallingford is a fun area and close to many Seattle attractions. Transportation was easily accessible.

Without a doubt, I would stay at Julia's sweet apartment again.

"
4258762,32944909,2015-05-23,14095507,Monica,"I got into Seattle very late but Julia had arranged for me to get into the apartment without any hassles. The apartment was great; very comfortable, clean and just a quick bus ride or walk away from the UW campus. Will definitely be looking to stay here again when I return to Seattle!"
4258762,34215997,2015-06-06,1558715,Ed,"Julia was a warm and friendly host :). The space was comfortable and bright, and the location cannot be beat :)"
4258762,34808385,2015-06-12,27469284,Ceri,"Julia was really accommodating and able to deal with my rather late arrival in to Seattle (which was made worse by Amtrak on the day...), and the apartment itself was exactly as pictured. In a lovely neighbourhood with rapid access to downtown via bus, it was also really nice and quiet off the main road. Had six excellent nights of sleep and the days full of seeing the sights.

Thanks Julia!"
4258762,35486099,2015-06-19,33760267,Yuxuan,Acceptable 
4258762,35820041,2015-06-22,33836692,Tom,"Julia was super nice! The apartment was clean and comfortable. The location was great -- lots of busses nearby made it easy for us to get anywhere we needed to go, and the apartment was close to a grocery store too. I definitely recommend staying here if you need to spend some time in Seattle!"
4258762,36228217,2015-06-26,27903620,Sing,The experience of staying at Julia's was excellent. The unit is close to I-5 which makes going to other places easy. The unit itself is clean and homey. I would stay at Julia's again!
4258762,36302342,2015-06-27,21598550,Sara,"Loved this top floor apartment in Wallingford, its charm and cleanliness were great! We were in Seattle during an unusually hot time and an open window breeze plus a fan Julia had set up were sufficient in cooling us down at night. Julia was also flexible with us when our arrival time was unexpectedly pushed back. Really responsive via text with our questions during our stay!"
4258762,36678741,2015-06-30,13760044,Kristen,"Left a card, easy to get in touch with, very accomodating"
4258762,37852265,2015-07-11,492575,Yvonne,I stayed at Julia's apartment for two nights. The apartment was cute and sunny and perfect for what I needed. Julia was easy to communicate with very responsive. Thanks for a great stay!
4258762,38629714,2015-07-17,906706,Michael,"Julia's apartment is spacious and well located, just a short drive from Fremont, Downtown, Capitol Hill, and the University District. It's in a nice neighborhood, Wallingford, which has a good mix of shops, cafes, and restaurants. Julia met us when we checked in, and was friendly even though we arrived a little later than expected. She also gave us some helpful recommendations about places to eat in the area. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay."
4258762,39504269,2015-07-24,34776499,Miriam,"This was both myself and my boyfriend's very first air bnb experience and Julia made it quite wonderful. She was very communicative, warm and friendly, and eve recommended a brunch spot for us. The space was perfect, sunny, spacious and charming. Comfortable bed and easy parking.

We were so impressed and grateful that we were able to stay even though it was just for a night. Would definitely go back! "
4258762,41093133,2015-08-04,35918747,Chris,"What a great experience as first time Airbnb users! Julia was so nice to work with. She was flexible with our arrival time and made us feel welcome. When I had a question she responded right away. The apartment was very nice, clean, cute and cozy. The week we were there was very hot. Julia had fans that helped keep the apartment comfortable. We would definitely stay there again. "
4258762,42119923,2015-08-11,32634239,Alex,"This was my first time ever visiting Seattle and also my first time using Airbnb, and both experiences were absolutely amazing. Julia made things so easy, and walking into the place for the first time was like walking into the pictures I had seen, so all the descriptions were definitely accurate. It really felt like I was coming home after having busy days of exploring a totally unknown city. The place was clean, had tons of sun, and was in a great neighborhood. It was within walking distance from views of the city, good restaurants, cool and unique shops, a grocery store, and bus stops to all over Seattle. 

Julia was great to work with over the phone, very friendly and knowledgable, and I felt the price was more than fair. I would absolutely stay at this place again and highly recommend it to others.      "
4258762,42889113,2015-08-16,36913319,Maryann,"This was a great place to stay and the location was perfect- It was so close to the things we wanted to do.
My friend slept in the bedroom and I was comfy on the couch.
Julia was so helpful with everything. 
I would totally come back!
"
4258762,44702679,2015-08-28,13544916,Josephine,It was terrific! Beautiful apartment and in a great neighborhood. Julia was super responsive and helpful!
4258762,45511000,2015-09-03,19767231,Neil,"Nice big bright living room, however the kitchen and bathroom were a disappointment. The kitchen required a thorough clean.  The bathroom hadn't been cleaned for our stay, we cleaned away the surface dirt and hairs however it was badly stained and in need of replacement."
4030640,37920158,2015-07-11,37608465,Kevin,Lisa was a great host. She met me to give me the key that best worked with my time. She gave us all the privacy we needed and was very good with replying back when we had any questions. 
4030640,38545862,2015-07-16,37583201,Laura,"Lisa's communications in advance of our arrival were fantastic. Great directions and contact info provided.
Warm welcome after our late arrival and long flight, only 20min drive from SEA and 15min from Alki beach. Useful tourist leaflets provided for ideas and maps. Fresh coffee & bottled water stocked well. Wi-Fi was (website hidden) for those who are staying in. 
Apartment was quiet, spacious, clean, with full facilities in a true residential area. Stunning views across the water. An uber is only 15usd to Belltown to go for a night out. Lisa and Bruce were great hosts and we would happily use the apartment again."
4030640,38920654,2015-07-19,37811277,Michele,Beautiful stay at Lisa's flat overlooking Seattle.  Had everything we needed.  Good parking spot.  Nice outdoor patio for drinking coffee in the morning.  Very attentive and communicative hosts.
4030640,40256465,2015-07-29,20092596,Jamie,"We had a wonderful experience staying at Lisa's apartment! She and her husband made us feel very welcomed upon arrival and gave us great tips for touring Seattle with our young children. 

The apartment is clean, spacious and tastefully decorated. They had fun games for our children to play! I also really appreciated the water bottles in the fridge and toiletries in the bathroom. Finally...the view! It is amazing! We enjoyed sitting on their beautiful deck, surrounded by a wonderful garden, and watching the ships on the water and the sunset in the evening.

The neighborhood is wonderful. There's a Trader Joe's close, as well as a park within easy walking distance. The trip into downtown Seattle is very quick and easy.

The only downside is being able to hear the family walking above you. They are by no means a loud family, but that is a downside of being in a basement apartment. That being said, however, we would stay again in a heartbeat!"
4030640,43670041,2015-08-21,9681242,John,"We stayed at Lisa's for 10 days and couldn't have asked for a better experience. Really great area in West Seattle. The downstairs suite is fully equipped with everything you could possibly need. Lisa was incredibly knowledgable about Seattle and gave us really great recommendations. The back deck is great for drinking wine and watching the sunset,(something we did every night there), stunning view of the Puget sound.  Might be difficult to sleep in if you wanted too, they're not by any means loud, but you can sometimes hear the TV/voices/walking...but that's always the case with bottom floor apartments. Regardless we will definitely stay here again when we come to Seattle. Great place and amazing hosts!! 

Kate & John  "
4030640,44336440,2015-08-25,40067945,Veronica,"We loved that it was clean, spacious and organized, with a great view! The location was convenient too. Lisa was welcoming and helpful by providing maps and tips about the area. The neighborhood was quiet. "
4030640,46228890,2015-09-08,22414650,Robyn,"This was our first experience with Airbnb. Lisa was very responsive and communicative leading up to the stay. Bruce and Lisa met us and showed us around. They were very sweet, and the accommodations were just right for my 73-year-old mom. I only wish we could have used the deck more during our stay. All in all, a very positive first experience. "
4030640,47288904,2015-09-17,42701745,Elizabeth,"This beautiful home in West Seattle located high on a hill overlooking Puget Sound is a great place to stay. We enjoyed sipping wine out on the spacious deck while watching the ferry boats and golden sunsets over the mountains. The neighborhood is very quiet and safe, you can walk anywhere at night. You have all the comforts of home for about one-third the cost of a hotel:  Large living room with big, comfy sofas, full-size eat-in kitchen with everything you need (there’s even a Keurig coffeemaker and lazy Susan stocked with French Roast and other treats), and a cozy bedroom with a nice bathroom and shower.  We enjoyed the company of our hosts Lisa and Bruce Corbin and they are happy to give you recommendations on what to see and do – like taking a ferry to Bainbridge Island, one of the highlights of our trip.  Book this place well in advance. You won’t be disappointed. Beth and Bob, Houston, TX.  "
4030640,48917633,2015-09-29,43276510,Ann,We had a great stay at Lisa and Bruce’s apartment! They were very helpful and Lisa responded quickly during all communication. She went above and beyond to help when we had to have some last minute items shipped to the apartment. The apartment view is amazing and the apartment itself was clean and spacious.  West Seattle was a fun area to explore as well! This was our first Airbnb experience and hope all future stays are just as good. 
4030640,54906103,2015-11-25,23945875,Megan,Lisa's place was great! Excellent view and nice location.  We felt at home while there - nice to be able to curl up on the sofa after a long day out and about! Excellent stay!
7859906,47014539,2015-09-14,2733912,Kai,"What an amazing place to stay at. Brant's listing is a very modern apartment in trendy Capitol Hill. There are a lot of great restaurants and bars just walking distance from his apartment--perfect for foodies. The room itself is cozy, but has it's own bathroom and entrance, plus, there is a shared living room and rooftop deck in the apartment.

Brant is an excellent host. He replies promptly and was in constant communication with me throughout the trip. He had lots of great tips on places to go/eat and he even invited us to some of the places he was going to.

Thanks for a great stay, Brant!"
7859906,48597204,2015-09-27,18741750,Carrie,"Clean, modern room that was a little smaller than I expected but still very nice to stay in. The area was beautiful and I loved staying here."
7859906,49252768,2015-10-02,43941422,Elizabeth,"Brant was so welcoming and made myself and my partner feel extremely comfortable in his own home.  He let us know of some of the best spots in the area to grab a drink and dinner, and was extremely kind and gracious.  I felt totally comfortable to ask him anything if we had questions about the place, or Seattle in general.  

The room itself was perfect, and the rest of the place was pretty amazing as well. Really nice roof-deck for coffee in the morning's and a really modern but comfortable feel all around.  If I'm ever in need of a place to stay, I'll absolutely be contacting Brant again!"
7859906,50515364,2015-10-12,5830092,Alex,"The location and set up of Brant's place is second to none! We arrived and Brant was there immediately to welcome us. Since there was no one renting the second bedroom, he let us use both rooms at no extra cost. Brant will be sure to take you out in Seattle and show you all of its hot spots. The room is as depicted in the photos. "

We started out taking Uber but realized that walking 20 mins (or less) in any direction got us to where we wanted to be. Very convenient! The room is cozy, but served its purpose for us since we were out exploring for the majority of our visit. Also super helpful that we were able to leave our bags after check out time, since we had a few hours to kill before catching our flight.  Thanks, Brant!"
7859906,53480561,2015-11-09,45174265,Steve,"Brant was great. He stayed in constant contact with us as we were preparing for the trip and answered all emails and texts very quickly
. The room was ready, clean and comfortable. The location is about a block or two from Seattle University, which is what we were visiting. The neighborhood is very nice and quiet and close to a lot of nightlife and, of course, coffee shops. The Pike Street marketplace and the West Lake shopping district are actually walkable from there, but we opted to use the bus to bring us back as it was uphill. The bus got us to within just a few easy blocks. Brant was easy going and let us stay extra long beyond normal checkout time as we had a late flight out. Thanks, Brant!

"
7859906,54042111,2015-11-15,30753171,Nguyen,Staying at Brant's room was a great experience.  The location is located within walking distance to all the major districts in Seattle.  We did not have a hard time getting around at all.  Brant made it easy for us to check in while he was away at work.  We were able to drop our bags off early and start our day in the city right away.  Brant is very knowledgeable of the city and helped us immensely in our quest to find a neighborhood that would be a good fit for us to move to.
7859906,54647221,2015-11-22,19078370,Dave,"Brant was a great host.  We didn't interact a whole lot, but he was there to let us in and to close the door behind us, which was fine with us.  The room was great -- very clean and tidy, with access to a private bathroom.  The neighborhood, Capital Hill, was a lot of fun.  Eat a late night burger at Dick's!"
7859906,54891146,2015-11-25,26931950,Kimi,This is the second time i've stayed with Brant and it's always a pleasure. The house and location is so perfect and Brant is an amazing host.

7455706,54546500,2015-11-21,33942196,David,"Stacy and bob were great! I had a fire at my house and was in need of a unit for a week and Stacy was very quick to respond. When I arrived the unit was clean, and was stocked with bags of pretzels and chips to munch on, as well as a coffee maker with coffee. Nice TV with an XBOX 360 made the down time while I was there very enjoyable, and the hosts gave me my privacy but were very attentive to any questions or needs I had. Not far from the UW, with a  good price, I highly suggest staying here."
7455706,55648270,2015-12-03,9429487,Harry,Stacy and Bob were very nice. We enjoyed our stay.  Clean and comfortable we would definitely recommend choosing their place for a relaxing get away.

7455706,56209279,2015-12-10,40953039,Rachele,"Stacey has a very nice split level home. We stayed in the bottom level. She arranged a wonderful basket of chips, cheetos, cookies, popcorn and pretzels. Also provided toothbrushes, toothpaste and soaps. After a long 4 hour drive it was refreshing to see this kind of hospitality. After checking in, we were headed out to see the Sand Point Tennis Club and Stacey had caught us as we were leaving. She gave us a warm welcome and told us if we needed anything, we could knock on her door. We would definitely stay here again and also recommend guests to Stacey's home."
8253955,49696500,2015-10-05,18848498,Tin,Colleen and her husband were exceptionally hospitable. We had a great time staying at this historic yet beautifully decorated home. it's located nearby the UW campus and is 2 min from the I5 exit so its location was very convenient as well.

8253955,57120489,2015-12-22,26744174,Beverly,Colleen was super easy to work out arrival and departure details with and arrangements worked very smoothly.  Her basement apartment has it's own entry and the neighborhood was very quiet and perfectly located for anything in the University district. We very comfortably slept 6 adults and one baby in our own pack and play. The newly remodeled kitchen is beautiful and has everything you need to cook any type of meal.  The bathroom is very roomy and also newly remodeled.  We had no problem with on street parking.
988176,3786590,2013-03-14,3797548,Carolyn,Mack's apartment was small but very cute and in a great location.  I was his first renter so a few things could be improved but he was very responsive to my feedback and made amends for any inadequacies.  I'm sure the next renter will be quite satisfied :)
988176,3969969,2013-03-31,5626170,Daniah,"As we were already en route to Seattle and needed a place to stay ASAP, Mack was very quick to respond and went out of his way so that we could stay at his place that night. The location couldn't have been better and the whole process was efficient and smooth for both parties. Mack was kind enough to leave us suggestions on where to go and even offered us a complimentary bottle of wine. He was also very, very open to suggestions and feedback! "

988176,4902432,2013-06-01,5695767,Brittany,"This review is way overdue but I thought it was important to still review Mack's loft in Belltown. The location of the loft is great, easily within walking distance of all that downtown and Belltown has to offer. It's also a very short walk to the Rapid Transit bus lines, making  trips into Ballard and West Seattle easy, as well as taking the light rail to/from the airport. The loft itself is cozy  for two people and great for a weekend getaway. More importantly, Mack is a great host and is very accommodating. My boyfriend and I would love staying here again when visiting Seattle. "

Highly recommended!"
988176,5471055,2013-07-01,6921900,Tom,"Mack's studio apartment was simply perfect for spending some time in downtown Seattle. It's in the best location possible, walkable to almost anything you'd want to do down town (and comfortably bussable to other stuff.) 

Mack was really flexible with when we got into the studio (we both got in from the airport super late. He's an easy host to work with and was really accommodating.)

The loft was perfectly cozy and had all of the comforts of home one would expect. (And the recent addition of an air conditioner is a total godsend.) 

Mack is the best! This is a great place to stay and he's a great host. thanks so much! :) "
988176,5567653,2013-07-06,7067841,Koushalya,"Mack's place is centrally located and is an easy walk away from so many attractions!

988176,5967293,2013-07-24,798712,Meghann,"Mack was great with communication. We texted and messaged frequently. We even worked out a ride from the airport when we came in late during the week. His place was clean and neat. We did not eat here much but having a fridge was useful. He recently got the internet in his apartment but we did not have the proper equipment in order to try it. He should have wi-fi up soon. His place was only 7 minutes from Pike's market. Very close to everything. It was a tad noisy near the end of the freeway but it was more white noise than anything else. Lots of great restaurants nearby to try and plenty of bars as well. Mack even offered to drive us to a grocery store during our stay since we were staying there for nearly a week. We didn't take him up on it but he dropped off a few bottles of craft beer for us to try. Great guy, great place to stay."

988176,6559677,2013-08-17,6853693,Jessica,"Mack was very good at initiating and responding to communication.  And we really appreciated his flexibility surrounding our arrival time, as we were beholden to a couple different kinds of public transportation. The location of the apartment couldn't be better!  It's right in the center of Belltown, which is why we originally booked the apartment.  Unfortunately I was sick during our stay so I was unable to get out of the apartment, which meant I spent a lot of time inside.  The apartment itself is very small.  The pictures must have been taken with a wide lens, because they are a bit misleading.  Also, the loft is very warm in the summer.  Even with the window A/C unit on downstairs and the loud fan blowing upstairs, we were still pretty uncomfortable.  Other than that, we had a good stay.  "
988176,6616124,2013-08-19,4603099,Carol,Soo enjoyed our stay @ Mac's Loft. The Location was perfect for us. We wanted a place close to Pier 66 and a lively neighborhood to walk around and explore. He even had breakfast items and ice cream for us! Love love love. We didn't have a car. Everthing was in walking distance. Caught a Seahawks game too! Mac was always quick to responds to texts and email. It was such a pleasure to meet you. When we do come to the city agian we will surely stay with you again !! =)

The location was fantastic for touring around Pike Place market, which is what we spent most of our time doing. We found an incredible coffee shop in the market called Storyville, which has great hot drinks, incredible baked goods and a third floor view of the market and ocean! Mack was extremely flexible with our check in and was a great communicator through the entire experience. Oh, and the bed was extremely comfortable!"

I was even able to walk to the W hotel in no time as well.  So the loft is very nicely located!  It was very easy connecting with Mack and communication was not an issue.  The loft had everything you needed and was well kept.  It is on the smallish side but very cozy and lived in. I would highly recommend.

I chose his space as the place to spend my downtime during Decibel, and I dare say I chose wisely. Every time I returned to my home for the week, I felt a sense of comfort and warmth. It is very easy to kick your shoes off and feel entirely at home in short order. Mack himself is incredibly conscientious and was in touch with me throughout the week to ensure my complete comfort. Everything about my stay was stellar, and I would recommend him & his spot in a heartbeat!"

We were not disappointed at all!  The location is great and the apartment is small but very comfortable.  We met with Mack for check-in and chatted with him for a while.  He's a very nice guy with great ideas of things to do in Seattle.  He also had tons of brochures, magazines and maps of the city.  He even left us some ice cream and snacks!

The neighborhood is also great! We walked at night back from the market and stop by a couple of cool bars/pubs.

We didn't have any problems at all and we definitely recommend it!

PS. Bonus points for having a Jenga set!"

It's also only a 5 blocks walking distance from pike place market.

The apartment itself and the kitchen are pretty small, also the bedroom and bathroom are on different floors but otherwise it's comfortable and an easy place to chill out. 
We chatted with Mack for a bit when we checked-in, he's a nice guy and seems to know Seattle well and he got us some excellent pastries and a bottle of wine so that was above and beyond.

Great communicator, easy to get ahold of, super clean and spacious apartment, eager to help make our trip the best (offering up suggestions on where to eat, what to check out...etc), lives close if there is any problems. Full kitchen, and the washer and dryer were awesome.. Also had a mini fan/AC unit that was useful as it does got hot!

Great neighborhood!!! Super close to everything fun... i.e. First Avenue (bars/clubs/restaurants), Pike Place Market, Post Alley, Fifth Ave... Short cab ride away from the Stadiums, Capital Hill, the Museums and Space Needle...But really everything is walking distance if you wanted to save a penny. The building is also a huge plus. Beautiful rooftop deck, big parking garage ($25 a night), lots of street parking, a gym...etc... Felt very safe is this hood.

We will definitely stay with Mack again in the future, and have been recommending his lovely studio apartment to friends and family.

Also.... Mack's username is Mclovin... Need I say more!?"
988176,32732486,2015-05-20,33451869,Donald,Macks place is amazing! The location is perfect just a short walk to pikes place market. The apartment is brand new and squeaky clean. The building is super modernist minimalistic with great style. The view from the roof top rec room is incredible. Puget sound views for miles! My wife and I stayed here for just a night on a little get away. Mack is a very friendly host who makes an effort to make sure your stay is comfortable and wants you to have a great time. Answered all our questions and kept in touch with us throughout our whole stay. The apartment was stocked with juices and beer and the pantry has Coffees and teas and all the essentials you would need if you wanted to go shopping and cook your own meals.  If you are looking for a great place to stay in downtown Seattle that's clean and brand new in a great location I would highly recommend staying here.

Those are really nice and well appreciated touches. He was a great host, offering up suggestions of what to see and do, and also checking in making sure we were as happy as could be. I can't think of a better way then starting the day off with a coffee and croissant in hand while sitting on the rooftop terrace overlooking the water. What a lovely stay and couldn't be happier...only wish we could have stayed longer! Thanks Mack :)"
988176,33617915,2015-05-30,33681329,Reed,"Apt. is very new and clean studio.  Good size for one person or a couple.

988176,33878533,2015-06-01,34057626,Robert,"This place is great. It's an awesome location, and the shared rec room/balcony is definitely a fun feature. You are in the middle f Belltown and there are lots of bar/restaurant options a few minutes walk away Mack was a fantastic host. He made check in and out very easy. The space was as promised and very clean. He even left some snacks and beverages which was a nice little touch. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to have a great time in Seattle."

Very well located and great little place to have a home base. Would definitely stay again.  I thought I left something at Mack's apartment and he was generous with his time to help me look for it!
988176,34252713,2015-06-06,34667178,Ville,The room was very clean and on great location. It was walking distance from the space needle and the city central. The view from the room was great too. I would recommend Macklovins apartment to anyone that wants to tour around Seattle.
988176,34488716,2015-06-08,32777386,David,Awesome stay. Extremely new and clean apartment and Mack was an amazing host who will go out of the way to meet any specific requests you have. The building was gorgeous with great views on the roof deck  (the apartment is on the top floor of the building). Easy walk to Pike place (about 8 min or so) and an even shorter walk to all the restaurants on 1st ave. 
988176,34812243,2015-06-12,34433384,Jan,"Amazing condo and location within walking distance to Pike Place, and various cafes and restaurants.  Mack was a very gracious host, and provided a condo that had everything you would find at home.  My first visit to Seattle was totally comfortable in this condo and I plan to book it again for my next visit."
988176,35950721,2015-06-23,34520522,Margay,"This was a wonderful place to stay, and Mack went above and beyond to make it a special Seattle experience. He recommended a ton of great places that were all within easy walking distance. (The condo is close to Pike Place Market and the Space Needle. Tons to do!)

And at the end of the day, the condo was a haven. Lovely kitchen, wifi, Netflix -- it felt like home. This was a beautiful place to stay. Thank you, Mack! "
988176,36126368,2015-06-25,30742866,Art,"Scott did a great job arranging to meet us on check in. The apartment is located perfectly to explore Seattle's waterfront via a nearby pedestrian walkway. Plenty of shops, cafes, and restaurants in the Belltown neighborhood. The common area deck has great views. Laundry in the unit was very convenient."
988176,36218790,2015-06-26,34543347,Alicia,Mack was fantastic! I was unable to arrive at the arranged time due to traffic at the Canadian/US border but he made sure to send me absolutely everything I needed to get inside of the apartment! The apartment is beautiful and brand new and the room is clean and nicely furnished. I would definitely recommend staying here :) 
988176,36560695,2015-06-29,25563786,Crystal,"The room was great, the location better and the host was best!  

The information online was accurate and the location was IDEAL.  Pike Place market was just about a 10 minute walk and the Space Needle/Duck tours were about 20 minutes walk away.  Many restaurants and activities near.  
Mack was an AWESOME host!  He was always very responsive and communicative, before and during our stay.  He met us upon arrival, made sure we had access to the room and made sure we had access to the parking garage.  We felt very comfortable in the room and he made sure we knew that he was accessible during our stay.  It was unseasonably warm in Seattle last week and Mack ran out to get us another fan for the room!  I would highly recommend this location and host, our stay was wonderful.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
988176,36718973,2015-06-30,35879452,Carter,Mack and his business partner helped me with a late check in time and the place was great! Even helped me with a late check out issue. Highly recommended!

"
988176,37610675,2015-07-08,28754227,Eugenio," There was a mix up in checking in, but Mack handled it ASAP and was very profession in his followup.   Excellent location in Belltown 5 minutes to the market. Apartment was clean and had everything you need.   It was record heat in Seattle when i stayed (95)  and the room has no large windows or doors to the outside but mack got some fans for me before i checked in.  Thanks "
988176,37775397,2015-07-10,22345184,Jessica,"Mack is an incredible host. He has the most detailed recommendations that helped us very much during our short stay. The apartment is super clean, with an artistic flare and superb location. We enjoyed our time in Seattle and would definitely come back. "
988176,38152207,2015-07-13,19310003,Jacqueline,"I celebrated my birthday weekend with my boyfriend by staying at Mack's place. The place was spacious and clean exactly like how its pictured! It's walking distance to many local attractions like the Pike Market, Space Needle, EMP museum, Chihuly Garden and Glass, and Seattle Aquarium. Mack was friendly, responsive, helpful and accomodating! He was able to accomodate our travel plans and would answer any questions we might have! I would definitely recommend others to stay here! Thanks Mack once again for being such a great host!! :D"
988176,38536177,2015-07-16,37049814,David,"We stayed at Mack's downtown home on July 13 -14 - very well located, clean and well kept.  Loved the 8th floor view from the game room and patio.  Wife and I watched the sunset and I played shuffle board with my daughter.  The apartment has a great central location.  You can walk to Pikes Place, Space Needle, Sculpture Park - you name it.  The downtown area is there to be explored.  Mack was a good host - ready to be reached by phone for our needs and give recommendations as requested."
988176,38611735,2015-07-17,34938049,Carlton,"Mack was great over the entire experience. We were prepared, he met us at the door and made sure we were set for our one night stay. We would stay with Mack if we return to Seattle!!!!"
988176,39253588,2015-07-21,6902531,Carolina,"Staying at Mack’s condo was my first time using Airbnb and it was great. Mack was very accessible and answered all my questions and emails in a timely manner. His place is clean, cute and super comfortable to stay in. In addition, his place is central to all of Seattle’s downtown locations and parking was very easy to find. If I need a downtown place to stay, I would not hesitate to contact Mack again. Thanks!!"
988176,39496291,2015-07-24,2457469,Luise,"Great neighborhood with many bars, restaurants, coffee places. The apartment is very close to the waterfront and several parks, which is great for e.g. jogging along the waterfront.
Mack was a very nice host and provided all information needed upfront.
"
988176,40499556,2015-07-31,25998742,Ken,"Mack was very responsive and welcoming to his condo. This is in an excellent location. The view from the condo is of the city, the Skylounge just a few steps, away is truly a gem overlooking the sound.

While close to the market, this is a quite location - perfect for a relaxing vaca or business trip. I enjoyed my stay and look forward to a return visit.

"
988176,40602367,2015-08-01,34617951,Ian,Perfect location for seeing the city in a short time period. Clean and inviting accommodations. Thank you Mack!

Though we didn't spend much time in the apartment, it was perfect for our needs.  The view on the balcony is amazing!  Mack was a great host and made check-in and check-out very easy and convenient- a definite plus!"
988176,41956069,2015-08-10,12715408,Jason,"The apartment was really nice (especially loved the roof deck!) and Mack was a good host. He worked with us to find a way to store our luggage since we arrived early and let us store our bags after check out time as well.  That was really appreciated.

Location of the apartment also VERY convenient and walking distance to lots of great areas (Pike Place, the wharf, downtown, etc..)"
988176,42350251,2015-08-12,29410050,Andrea,Mack was very accommodating to our schedule and gave some great suggestions for the neighborhood.  The apartment is in a great location -- walking distance to a lot of sights and restaurants and bars.  Also right by the water which is nice.
988176,42465325,2015-08-13,40334191,Carson,Mack was very easy to work with. The location was great for what we wanted to see. We had a positive first Airbnb experience at his place. 
988176,42921288,2015-08-16,39473523,S.L.,"The location was perfect. We wanted to be close to Pike's Market, the shops, restaurants, and close to the water. Our flat was modern and comfortable. The only complaint I would have is there is no ac and we happened to be there during a warm week. Mack did provide fans for us which was helpful. It was nice having a washer and dryer and a full kitchen.  Mack checked on us periodically to see how we were doing and if we needed anything. What a gracious host! "
988176,43330126,2015-08-18,4358496,Katie,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this waterfront apartment!  It's in a beautiful modern complex and the space is thoughtfully furnished for guests.  Loved the proximity to both Pike Place and the nice restaurants and cafes on 1st Avenue.  Especially enjoyed the fire pit on the balcony and the striking views of the Space Needle, Mount Rainer and the harbor.  If you're wanting to be near the hustle and bustle of downtown, I'd highly recommend this listing."
988176,43567005,2015-08-20,6160275,Jenny,"Mack's unit is great and the rooftop terrace with sweeping views of Puget Sound is fabulous. It is just as it is described on the site. Mack was very attentive and stayed in close touch before and during our stay. As a Seattleite relocated to the East coast, this was the perfect spot to enjoy old and new haunts downtown before visiting family. The condo is well located in Belltown near the Pike Place market, SAM, great restaurants and shopping downtown. I would definitely stay her again. We felt very welcomed. We arrived on a late flight and Mack was very accommodating and helpful with our late check-in. We were also able to store our bags for the afternoon upon departure. "
988176,44053462,2015-08-23,25742284,Amanda,"Very much appreciated Macks punctuality and where we stayed was very pleasant! Great location!! Thank you Mack!

988176,45673456,2015-09-05,25416881,Brian,This place is smack dab in the middle of some of the coolest attractions in Seattle. Everything you need is in the apartment waiting for you and your sunset awaits you on the balcony.
988176,46242216,2015-09-08,2198643,Yoav,"The aprtment is beufiull, but is advertised as a two beds apartment,  when infact there is only one bad and sofa.,  which is extremely uncomfortable to sleep on. 
If coming as a couple or as a single geust is good. But it is defiantly not a two bad apartment."
988176,46338791,2015-09-09,13672213,Madeleine,We only stayed for a night but it was very lovely. The apartment had great natural lighting and it was open enough where we could spread out our supplies and repack for a backpacking adventure!
988176,46755788,2015-09-13,41475146,Jeny,Great location & very nice apt. Especially loved the rooftop terrace. Great view of waterfront & the space needle.  Would definitely return. 
988176,47315912,2015-09-17,43783887,Jean,"Diane and Mack are top-notch hosts! They always replied quickly and were super friendly. Having a washer/dryer was nice to have too! The apartment is nicely situated in a hoppin' neighborhood and a 10 min. walk to Pikes Market. Tasty coffee in the lobby and great balcony view! (note: the balcony/water view is not in the apt., but is easy access across the hallway) All in all, a really great experience. "
988176,47498034,2015-09-19,12851910,Hanae,"We didn't get a chance to meet Mack and Dianne but Mack was very helpful via text to accommodate us. 

::Location::
Very close to Pikes Market. Took us less than five minutes to get there. The neighborhood is safe and quiet at night. 

::Apartment::

pros: Gorgeous and clean. The bed was comfy and there were plenty of natural light coming in during the day. The view from the public balcony is beautiful. 

cons: There were two downsides. First one  was that the previous people right before us who stayed here cracked the toilet seat frame, which was fixed the next day... As much as I tried to avoid the crack, I did get injured. I understand that there were only two hours to clean before we showed up so I am not sure what could have been done to avoid it. Second one is that the comforter was still drying in the dryer. When we came back from our day trip it was still damp so I put it through the cycle twice. Unfortunately we were blanket less that night because it was still damp. My boyfriend had to put it on the chair overnight for it to dry. 

Checkout: Flexible. Left the key on the counter before we headed out. "
988176,47898480,2015-09-21,44284815,Raul,The host was great. The location was just as it was described. Has wifi and cable. The balcony on the floor had a great view. 
988176,48176105,2015-09-24,37912373,Lindsay,"The location was great, and the hosts were perfect! We got lost on the way to the location and Diane texted me right back to help us find the place. The only reason this is 4 stars instead of 5 is that I didn't realize there wouldn't be anywhere to store our bags once we checked out, so we had to carry our luggage around Seattle all day after checking out."
988176,48332990,2015-09-25,42620488,Lisa,"Very convenient location in Belltown. The location is across the way from the waterfront- an easy walk to Belltown's restaurants, Pike, and the waterfront. "
988176,48889735,2015-09-29,8495321,Rebecca,"Great location, you can walk everywhere, Pike's Market, the ferries, the space needle.  The amenity deck has an awesome view of the harbor, we enjoyed sitting out there regularly with morning coffee or an afternoon glass of wine."
988176,49609734,2015-10-05,390711,Kate,This space was exactly what my husband and I needed. We walked everywhere- or took a very cheap lyft/uber when our feet were a bit tired. The location could not have been better. The apartment had all of the amenities that we needed to make our stay comfortable- and Diane and Mack were wonderful hosts! We would definitely stay here again. 
988176,50769465,2015-10-14,43817707,Wenny,GREAT location and very clean apartment! Everything we were looking for. Even the towels provided were super soft and nice. Diane and Mack really made a great host! The only issue we had was the full-size bed was too squeaky for me and my husband..
988176,51070732,2015-10-17,12937167,Stephen And Charlene,"Terrific location. Beautiful, simple and well appointed space. Sky lounge with view of the water was wonderful to have a cup of coffee while watching the ships come in each morning. Had one resentful incident with another resident in the building upset with other owners swapping for a non-resident use. "
988176,51628855,2015-10-22,3236046,David,Diane and Mack were excellent host.  They made me feel like family and the place was described accurately and the location was on point.  Amazing hosts!!
988176,52442803,2015-10-29,36239484,Newman,We had a fantastic time. The apartment looked brand new and the building was really funky. The porch was a highlight of our stay in Seattle. Check-in was easy and parking was safe below the building. All the essentials were there. Mack gave us great suggestions in the area. I highly recommend this apartment!
988176,52524806,2015-10-30,27613380,Niki,Such a great experience!! Was our first time to Seattle and this is a perfect location. Diane and Mack were great at communicating through the entire stay. Highly recommended staying here!

988176,54140864,2015-11-16,1262926,Russell,"Coming from California we were hoping for a little Seattle rain experience...boy did we get it! The apartment was right across from the Art Institute and the apartment building was like an amazing art project. Great location for the Public Market, restaurants and all that goes on in Seattle. Also enjoyed the nice workout room, the washer/dryer in the bathroom, and the great view of the water from the deck. 
As far as negatives, the bed was quite comfortable but squeaky. Also the decor in the apartment lacked something special--no rugs or plants or artwork. Pretty plain. 
I never met Mack and Sophie, as they hire a very nice young man to manage their rentals but he was very responsive and professional. Overall great experience. I'd stay there again."
988176,54324236,2015-11-18,8610977,Ryan,"Great place in an awesome location! They had stuff for us to cook dinner and a nice TV for when it was rainy outside. The building was really great too, and the apartment is on the top floor, with access to an amazing rooftop view."

988176,54727191,2015-11-23,5102329,Claire,"Convenient location. I'm sorry to say the mattress was super loud, so every time my husband or I rolled over in bed the other one woke up. Place was sufficient, definitely no fluff. If the weather had been warmer I can imagine using the rooftop deck and enjoying the awesome view.   "
988176,55325105,2015-11-29,31880523,Corbin,Incredible space for an amazing price and fabulous hosts! Don't past this up! Right in the heart of downtown Seattle and sprinkled with some luxury.
988176,55479833,2015-12-01,12778258,Manisone,"Close proximity to all the Seattle tourist spots like Pike's Place, the Pier, Space needle. We walked to everything. Amazing views from the deck right outside the unit. Apt was clean & cozy (although bed was a bit squeaky). Bathroom and kitchen was equipped with things we needed (extra toilet paper rolls a plus!). I did not meet Mack & Sophia, but they were around via text to answer all my questions quickly & I had a lot. If they were not able to answer, they were able to figure something out to accommodate. Great service. Great hosts."

988176,58552583,2016-01-03,31752500,Alex,"This place is very nice and the location couldn't be better. The instructions to get into the place were very clear and thorough. Mack was also flexible enough to allow us to arrive early and drop off our bags so we could make an early food tour. The balcony has gorgeous views of the islands, and pike place is a 5 minute walk. Trending restaurants and bars are in every direction, also walking distance. I would highly encourage this place to anyone looking to stay in downtown. "

7003848,38969713,2015-07-19,8522925,Kathie-Duyen,Gabe was great and was able to accomodate us with such short notice. The place was warm and welcoming and he even had welcome beverages for us.

7003848,41994714,2015-08-10,30966208,Yue Ming,"Me and a few friend stumbled upon Gabe's place while looking for a place to Seattle. We stayed there for about 10 (website hidden) very happy to have rented the place. The place was clean and looked fairly new. It was as described in the pictures.

Gabe himself was an excellent host. We ran into some issues with our mail while staying with him and Gabe went out of his way to help us!
He provided ample information about Seattle and helped us to find several things such as where to eat/ buy mobile phone plans and even helped my friend out by buying an empty box to help with his packing.

Overall I feel that both the place and the host are 10/10 and would recommend  anyone to book his place !"
7003848,42947257,2015-08-16,22428225,宋,"Gabe is warm heart man and very kind to instruct me how to make a comfort stay. I had to say this is the best place i have ever stayed. That this house owns great view directly towards river and the environment is very very very quiet. I hope that I could bring my family here again in future!

And we enjoyed tea and coffee prepare by host. There are even frozen glass for beer!"

7003848,55143610,2015-11-28,29627978,Ari,"This is a wonderful rental in a very charming part of town with absolutely tremendous views of the University district. Walking distance to several places (markets, restaurants, stores) and a short drive from downtown. 
It's very nicely renovated with modern and clean decor and furnishings. A very nice kitchen. One of the bathrooms has one of the nicest showers we've ever used, with five separate heads. My wife and I stayed there with my parents, and it was very comfortable for two couples to enjoy.
Gabe was a very pleasant and accommodating host who wants his guests to feel comfortable and enjoy their time. "
8306581,53263042,2015-11-07,17842409,Elizabeth,"This is a terrific apartment in one of Seattle's iconic neighborhoods with restaurants and shops in abundance nearby.   The apartment is lovely and well appointed.  Rob and Ann were especially kind to leave an abundance of supplies for the use of their guests - even a few items in the fridge.   

There were five of us staying - 3 humans and 2 dogs and it was perfect as it was very easy to get in and out of the apartment to walk the dogs.   The apartment is quiet and the gated parking area is a huge plus.  

There were just a few minor issues that needed some attention (internet access problems_ but the organization (Pillow) that Rob and Ann use to help with these things has a 24-hour phone line and could solve them quickly and easily.   

All told, I would highly recommend this location to anyone visiting Seattle who wants to get away from downtown but still wants access to everything Seattle has to offer."
3468261,16220216,2014-07-23,17558099,Brian,"This was my first airbnb experience and it went perfectly.  Michael welcomed me, gave me a quick tour, and then left me with a 6-pack of beer to enjoy.  

Nice 1 bedroom apartment and a great location walking distance to the space needle or a longer walk to downtown Seattle.  

Can't wait to visit Seattle again and use airbnb again!"
3468261,17418864,2014-08-11,14984232,Kristin,"What a great apartment! Awesome location: super safe and centrally located. 

Michael's apartment was clean and cozy. We had everything we needed, from travel size shampoos to info about a good deli across the street.

Additionally, Michael was very accommodating of our need for a late key pick up. He is a flexible and gracious host- we'd definitely stay here again! "
3468261,18810267,2014-09-01,18663451,Will,"Michael and Britta were absolutely fantastic. Their apartment was extremely clean and in a great location. Michael and Britta were extremely welcoming and left a bottle of wine for us as well as recommendations on local places to try. They made the overall experience extremely easy and enjoyable and communicated very clearly how to pick up the keys and access the apartment. Would stay with them again in a heartbeat. Thanks for a lovely weekend in Seattle!

-Will and Laura "
3468261,35848097,2015-06-22,10552442,Josh,"I would highly recommend Michael's apartment to anyone looking to visit Seattle.  It's an amazing location just outside of downtown with an  incredible panoramic view of the city from the rooftop area.

The apartment is lived in, but very clean, and the bed was quite comfortable.

Michael was very prompt in responding to any question that I had, and I had no problem getting around Seattle via mass transit for Uber/Lyft from his place.

I definitely would stay at Michael's again the next time I visit Seattle!"
3468261,39110545,2015-07-20,20938076,Tricia,This was a great place to stay in Seattle.  There was a great coffee shop across the street and we were able to walk a lot of places.  We enjoyed the balcony on the courtyard as well as the rooftop patio.  We'll look to stay here again next time we're in town :-)
3468261,41960712,2015-08-10,35868239,Mumu,"The apartment was lovely, clean, and absolutely charming. Michael and Britta were responsive in coordinating check-in/out. The location is convenient (right across the street from a cafe and coffee shop). I felt right at home, and my stay in Seattle was made ten times better because of this place. Would absolutely recommend! "
3468261,48838607,2015-09-28,6495984,Tuyen,"Great stay in Seattle! Michael was attentive and quick to respond to our reservation request. He kept in touch with how to get to his place from the airport. Check in was easy, we picked up keys early but check in is 11am. The neighborhood is very nice, in south lake Union a half hour walk to Pike Place and all the action, and a quick car ride to other neighborhoods like Capitol Hill. The apartment building is secure and clean. The unit itself was also very clean and nicely decorated. It's a lived in apartment but still felt welcoming, comfy bed and clean bathroom. The rooftop view was gorgeous.

All in all a great private apartment and good neighborhood, just not super central. Would recommend it to folks looking for some luxury and privacy."
5825701,30465257,2015-04-22,28135813,Ann,"Joe made us feel very welcome and at home at his house.  Given that my family and I were his very first airbnb guests, he checked in with us and made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. The location can't be beat, it's a friendly neighborhood, great highway access, and very walkable to a big park, great cafe, some restaurants and shops. The house has plenty of room for a large family or group with lots of common space plus an awesome deck, back yard and hot tub. At the time of the booking, the house was true the listing description, but the listing didn't clarify that two of the bedrooms are below grade (but with large windows) and two of the bedrooms are upstairs from the ground floor.  (Although Joe and I communicated about this later.) It ended up working out fine for us because the separation helped with noise and gave everyone some more personal space. The house was not the most kid-friendly with a fair amount of fragile decor, (although a lot of it was pictured in the listing), so that made the experience less than ideal for us, but overall we had a very comfortable stay and would recommend this house to others. "
5825701,31831496,2015-05-10,31983043,Nancy,"Six adults (3 couples) used the home.  It functioned very well for our group with enough bedrooms and multiple areas to either spend time together or to retreat to.  Although on different levels (there are 8 stair steps between each level), our group found them ok to walk between (we aged from 65-90).  The kitchen is well laid out for those who cook, with enough tableware and utensils to accommodate us. The home is in a nice, walkable, quiet, and friendly neighborhood.  A small commercial area is nearby offering good coffee with breakfast and lunch offerings.  A major mall is 1 mile away as is a grocery store and other shopping opportunities.  The backyard and decks were good areas to unwind and relax.  The online photos accurately portray the house.  Our host met us on arrival to show us around and wanted to make sure our stay was a good one.  We were comfortable and pleased we chose this home for our getaway."
5825701,32570010,2015-05-19,31028714,Jim,"Joe, or as my wife calls him ""American Richard Branson"", met us at the door of his home and showed us everything we needed to know about his place.  The neighborhood was very family friendly with people walking their dogs and some taking their newborns on walks in strollers.  It felt very safe and the listing was accurate.  The one aspect of the listing that is difficult to describe is how much you would enjoy staying in this home if you appreciate the craftsmanship of very well kept older home.  The windows were all updated to double pane, the appliances in the kitchen were top notch, the wood floors (warning they did creak so light sleepers should take the upstairs bedrooms) were in great condition, and the downstairs shower even had THREE shower heads!  Though we didn't spend time in the yard, it is very well kept with a grill and Jacuzzi and I can see it being used on a nice summer day.  The only downside to the home are the stairs, or I should say the abundance of them.  The home is really a double split level home with four floors and three sets of 1/2 flights of stairs and it's really a nice layout.  However, if you have a young mobile child (ours were fortunately barely old enough to know falling down the stairs would hurt a lot) you may want to consider another property.  Also, to leave on a positive note, the area has a surprisingly large number of highly ranked restaurants within a mile or two of the property."
5825701,32926004,2015-05-23,33056694,Charles,"Staying in Joe's home was a wonderful experience and deceivingly spacious! He was immediately welcoming, attentive, and accommodating. This home is perfectly situated (a fast few blocks from I-5) for travelers who want to visit any part of the Seattle metro area to include downtown (Space Needle and Pier) or Bellevue, or venture northward for a whale watching tour!  This home was clean, comfortable, spacious, fully appointed, and the deck area was a delightfully private retreat with hummingbirds whirring around. The residence is in a very quiet neighborhood with great nearby accommodations like Blue Saucer, which has the best coffee ever! Shopping, restaurants and drinking establishments are just a few blocks away! And Univ of Washington is only 15 minutes drive!  We would stay here again anytime!"
5825701,34645187,2015-06-10,30321495,Pantipa,"We loved this place. The house was cozy like our own home. The host supplied everything e.g. towels, amenities, kitchen/toilet paper, dryer, vacuum cleaner etc. 

The house looks small from outside but inside was much more bigger. We loved making BBQ at the back porch.

The 4 bedrooms fits 7 of us for 8 days perfectly!

We really loved the kitchen!, hugh refrigerator and all of what we wanted were there!

If we had a chance to visit Seattle again, we would definitely stay here again."
5825701,35083628,2015-06-15,20862093,Robin,"Joe and Alicia were awesome.We stayed almost a week for my daughter's graduation. The weekend was great and so was the house.  Besides the house being gorgeous with a beautiful kitchen and other rooms, it was clean and very well supplied with linens, dishes, etc. 
I would stay there again when visiting Seattle.
Thank you Alicia and Joe.

La casa es muy amplia, y acogedora, esta muy bien equipada con todo lo necesario, como secadora de pelo y plancha para la ropa.
Todo estaba limpio y ordenado, utilizamos dos veces el asador en la terraza. Muchas gracias por sus atenciones. "
5825701,36527611,2015-06-29,2619800,Diane,"My group loved staying at Joe's house! It was beautifully appointed, cozy, and the deck was amazing, peaceful, and had a great view. The place looked even better in person than in the pictures. We had no complaints whatsoever. Thanks Joe for sharing your house with us!"
5825701,37306663,2015-07-06,2713132,Erica,"The house was cute and in a great location, with lots of nice spaces to hang out. The kitchen was nice, the backyard and hot tub were great, and Joe was a responsive host. I would definitely stay here again.

"
5825701,37684351,2015-07-09,6658891,Nate,"A beautiful, comfortable home in a great neighborhood - this was a seamless and pleasant stay. Joe was communicative but stayed out of our way, and the house was well-stocked and comfortable even in a Seattle heat wave. "
5825701,38120990,2015-07-13,1703366,Krishna,Joe was a great host. The house was perfect and accommodated my parents and in-laws beautifully. We love Seattle and will be back!
5825701,38998258,2015-07-20,12179920,Jeffrey B.,"Joe's house is indeed everything the name boasts, and more! We had a wonderful stay during out time there. The backyard is beautiful and very cozy. The house is in great condition and in a great neighborhood - we had a blast going down to the lake everyday.

I would highly recommend staying at Joe's place! He's a wonderful host, was available to us if we needed anything and he was very flexible.

Thanks again Joe for a great stay!! :)"
5825701,40242582,2015-07-29,26230371,John,"We absolutely loved our stay in this home! We couldn't have picked a more perfect place for our stay with our family. It is a very quiet neighborhood which was perfect for us. It was very spacious and very accommodating. It was also only 10 to 15 minutes from the places we visited like the Woodlands Zoo, Pike Market, the Pacific science center, the Space Needle, beaches and more. Alicia was great, she met us at the house to show us how everything worked and was super helpful. Joe and Alicia also had brochures and info for things to do in the area. We loved it!"
5825701,40900544,2015-08-03,1381688,Amy,"Joe and Alicia's house was a perfect venue for our group of four women. There are two seating areas, a well-equipped kitchen and a bar fridge in the lower-level area. We used the back deck and grill, too. The two shared baths work well for the space and the house is much larger than you think from the street. Joe and Alicia were responsive and attentive. If you are coming from the Midwest or East Coast, please keep in mind that few homes have A/C. Even though the days were unseasonably warm, it cooled off at night and was quite comfy for sleeping. "
5825701,41347008,2015-08-07,20413455,Ana,We loved the charming house in this quiet and safe neighborhood.  The place was tastefully remodeled and it was very well equipped with all the essentials.  The backyard provided an amazing view of the sunset.  I strongly recommend this listing and would not hesitate to book again if my travels take me back to Seattle.  
5825701,41932317,2015-08-10,6947272,Jordan,"A beautiful and a comfortable house! It was perfect for our wedding party to stay at, ample of room for 8 people and a decent location to go out and explore the city! "
5825701,44282339,2015-08-25,12585136,Denise,"We had been in close communication with Joe, because there had been a last-minute rental the night before our arrival. Joe called us just as we were pulling into the driveway to let us know that he had completed his cleanup following the departure of the previous stay and to reassure us that the house was ready for our arrival, and that my elderly mother would be able to rest before we headed off to begin the wedding festivities.
Sure enough, the house was sparkling clean, homey and welcoming for weary travellers."
5825701,45066252,2015-08-31,33077147,Bradley,Joe was an attentive and welcoming host. We loved the backyard with the barbecue and hot tub. 
5825701,45928398,2015-09-07,32370090,Nick,"The description was accurateJoe was wonderful to work with.  He met with my parents and sister promptly as they checked in and went over the features of the house and neighborhood.  The location was perfect for activities near the University of Washington and Downtown Seattle.  The house was clean and the backyard was very nice.  Kitchen was great, well stocked.  
We would definitely ask to reserve this home again.  "
5825701,46615478,2015-09-12,40239931,Milaina,Joe was very accommodating.  The house is clean and nicely furnished and close to public transportation for easy access to downtown Seattle.  There are menu's and good recommendation for places to eat which we appreciated.  I love staying there and would do it again. 
5825701,47717859,2015-09-21,41272351,Catherine,"It was a pleasure working with Joe! He bent over backwards to make sure we were accommodated in every way! The home was beyond our expectations! Cozy, impeccably clean and stocked with everything we needed. I would definitely rent here again. Thank you Joe for a fabulous first time Airbnb experience ! You Rock! "
5825701,48696142,2015-09-28,15684025,Casey,"Great host and house.  Close to everything, very comfortable, and just as described.  Great outdoor deck and proximity to cafe/restaurants."
5825701,49960563,2015-10-07,30390790,Jason,"We are a traveling band that does workshops with youth and community...and also performances throughout the U.S. Alicia and Joe were great hosts and the space was unique and beautiful. They responded very quickly! The jacuzzi was an added bonus! We stayed for 3 days and enjoyed the comforts and serenity of this home. Recommend this space if you want a tranquil, spacious and beautiful time! Will definitely be back. Thanks Alicia!"
5825701,50333776,2015-10-11,44374695,Ariel,"We loved staying at the house! Everything was clean, house was very cute and plenty of space for everyone. Check in/out was super easy and it was great to have a place to park our cars. Joe was quick with his responses to all our questions"
5825701,51111591,2015-10-18,35970803,Christine,"We accessed the house with no problem, left for home the same way.  It's a very nice home, and the hot tub was a nice way to end the days. The washer and dryer were great, as that allowed us to pack light.  We did have a problem with the internet, but I didn't think to call Joe about it, so, my own fault!  The dishes and pots/pans were adequate for basic cooking.  Beds were comfy, and there was plenty of space for my friends and I to gather and catch up.  The view from the back deck is spectacular.  This is definitely a ""home away from home"", and I will be back if I venture out to Seattle again!  "
5825701,51811880,2015-10-24,45668427,Joe,We really enjoyed our stay here. The maple leaf neighbourhood and perfect for our young family - the local park was fun. The house was perfectly as described and served us very well. Thank you 
5825701,54116803,2015-11-16,39248856,Manny,"Joe was very accommodating. This house was very nice and cozy and in a great location. Joe let us check in early and let us stay a little later after check out which helped us out a lot. Joe was also very easy to get a hold of and offered help of it was needed. Overall, it was a great stay and a nice house. "
5825701,55352989,2015-12-01,2893840,Will,"We had a great stay at Joe's house, it's very nicely equipped, in a great neighborhood, comfortable and quiet. Many thanks!"
5825701,56982620,2015-12-20,35710957,迪,"It was a huge bless that we finally reserved this time-honored house with limited time. We were so amazed at the house for its tidiness, cleaness, artistic style and even every single detail the moment we gently pushed the door open.During the days in Seattle, we just loved roaming around the alleys surrounding the house. we really did.  For us，everyday was perfect！"
5825701,58196700,2016-01-01,1530844,Kevin,Just a perfect and wonderful experience. My whole family flew into Seattle to celebrate the new year. Bus to downtown was simple and easy. The hot tub was great and the kitchen allowed us to make a wonderful dinner. Our only regret is that we didn't have time to stay longer!
639130,40090287,2015-07-28,32689573,Kristen,This was our first time using airbnb.  The house was the perfect size for our group.  Close to all downtown has to offer.  The owners do have 2 cats that need to be fed twice a day.  Taz and Reece.  Taz is a bit hyper and I would worry if there were small children staying.  He was laying on me and when I slowly went to move him off he bit my cheek.  Just left a red mark but could have been worse.    There were no blinds/shades in the hall bathroom.  We could see people in a house when we were in the bathroom.  If you can see them odds are they can see you in the bathroom.   We got to the house later than we originally had planned.  I felt like they pretty much handed the the keys over and were out the door.  I would have liked a little more info on the house and the cats.  Like I said this was our first time renting so maybe this is all normal. 
639130,45919783,2015-09-07,8618678,Robert,"In Seattle we found a delightful host, home and neighborhood.
Ann was prompt to reply to emails and personable upon arrival. She helped welcome us and got us oriented to both home and neighborhood.
The 4-bedroom home is spacious, well lighted and featuring comfortable beds. It isn’t a full-time rental. It’s Ann’s home, but she arranged things so that we could stay there very nicely for four nights. She even found a place for her two cats to stay since some in our party don’t do particularly well with pets. That was much appreciated.
The established Madrona neighborhood is a great one to explore. We took sets of public stairs down past hillside homes and streets until we entered a short trail that led to the shores of expansive Lake Washington. We ate breakfast, along with many locals, at the yummy Hi Spot Café, an easy walk from the house. And we enjoyed being about 15 minutes away from Pike Place Market and Seattle Center.
I highly recommend this home.

458183,3672546,2013-03-02,2633212,Jonah,"Comfortable place to stay right around the corner from a great Seattle neighborhood. Nicely renovated, amazing kitchen that you could do some serious cooking in. Parking can be tight, but the area is so walkable it's not a big concern. I would stay here again."
458183,4411354,2013-05-03,6108492,Logan,"Chris was incredibly hospitable, and responded to all my questions about what to do in the area, and how to get the most out of my experience in Seattle. My lodgings were great as well. I was totally comfortable, and felt right at home: I wanted for nothing in my time at Pure Space. Stay here!!!"

458183,19248362,2014-09-08,20897160,Christi,"The host was quick to respond to questions, very welcoming. The room was clean and the neighborhood was quiet and super close to lots of great shops/cafes. Didn't have trouble with parking (though it was also a weekend which makes it easier). Only complaint is we couldn't figure out how to use the door. There was a trick to it, though if another guest hadn't helped us, I am sure Chris would have responded quickly enough to help us out. Since this was the only ""issue"", it's safe to say that it was a successful airbnb stay. :)"
458183,20724210,2014-10-04,4326606,Muhammad,"I had a great time in Seattle, especially this place! I met Chris only twice for less than 5 minutes, but he was really helpful and nice. He's very cooperative and he replies my messages even at night. 

The house is amazing, located in a super nice and cool area, literally 1 block from these amazing coffee shops, restaurants, and even gas station. It's  definitely one of my favorite areas in Seattle. The common areas in this house are incredible and comfortable. I will definitely come back whenever I visit Seattle in the future."
458183,20859584,2014-10-06,4718922,Carly,The water room world was a great location and very comfortable bed. This spot is right on Capital Hill where there are restaurants and coffee shops near by. Chris was also very accommodating if I needed help.

Also, the place has a hot tub, which is pretty awesome. "

5330475,51340787,2015-10-19,34142244,Fyaaz,"Anna is an awesome host! The room was even better than I expected. The entire apartment and my room+private bathroom were very clean, and had lots of space for me to keep my luggage. The neighbourhood has many things within walking distance, as well as bus routes and bike rentals (Pronto) right in front of the building. Anna also has great roommates who were fun to hang out with and took the time to show me around and answer all of my question. Overall, great place to stay!"
7262142,44862756,2015-08-29,35750630,Rita,"Our best AirBnB experience so far. Kathleen responded to messages promptly and was super helpful and friendly during our stay. The apartment is perfect, comfortable and clean with everything you need. It's about a 10 minute walk to lively Columbia City shops/restaurants etc. Kathleen gave us maps and lots of recommendations of things to do according to our interests. 
We would recommend to everyone, especially at the price which is very reasonable."
7262142,45199902,2015-08-31,12460621,Melissa,"The place was peaceful, clean, well-appointed with food, drinks, and toiletries, and gave a good night's rest in a very private basement-apartment style unit. You'll be happy you chose Kathleen's Airbnb!"

I would suggest this stay to anyone!"
7262142,46040327,2015-09-07,42230270,Hemant,"Kathleen was very nice host. It was our first Airbnb experience and we loved the experience. The place was as described and shown in pictures, neat and clean.
Neighborhood was very quiet and safe. All the suggestions which she gave were nice. Especially the Royal Room for some live music. 
Also, i must say, my wife is scared of dogs and Kathleen took care of that making sure the dog's premises doesn't overlap with ours. Also, since it was a little cooler, she took care by providing a external heater. 
I wish more people can get a chance to stop by and stay at this lovely place :)"
7262142,46326187,2015-09-09,41478522,Hockey10,We had a great time in her quaint and private space! She even have us very good tips on where to hang out and why to check out while in town. Even left us a snack when we arrived. Was truly a great time!
7262142,46645435,2015-09-12,40967971,Darren,"I cannot say enough good things about Kathleen and her room. She is a ln incredible host and extremely hospitable. It is immaculately kept, cozy, and feels like so much more than just a spare room. I had reservations about staying farther away from Seattle than I wanted, but they were quickly dashed when I got there. Columbia City is a quaint community within Seattle and the Link is a short walk from Kathleen's place. She provided spot-on information for the restaurants and sights. This was my first Airbnb experience and it will be hard to beat this one."

I found this one bedroom apartment to be the perfect place to stay while in the Seattle area. It was exactly what the pictures had portrayed. I cozy apartment with a comfortable bed, quaint kitchen / dining area and, modern bathroom. The property was within walking distance to several coffee shops, restaurants and, public transportation. Kathleen is an amazing host and I could not have gotten any luckier. "
7262142,48006592,2015-09-22,42539679,Mark,As a first time AirBnB experience this was great! Columbia city had some great restaurants and it was a short drive to get to downtown Seattle. Seaward park had awesome trails and was just minutes away! The apartment accommodations were very inviting and very well done. Kathleen was a fantastic host and I would definitely recommend her place! 
7262142,48313052,2015-09-25,844050,Caylin,"Clean, comfortable and a great location to explore Seattle.  We loved our stay at Kathleen's apartment. It is close to Seward Park, lots of cute shops and restaurants and easy access to downtown. The heated floor in the bathroom was an extra plus!"
7262142,49143079,2015-10-01,3196694,Carrie,"We had such a great stay at Kathleen's cozy apartment. The unit feels very private because it has a separate entrance and all of the amenities right in the studio. The decor was comfortable and upscale. I was very impressed with the cleanliness and accessibility of this airbnb. The neighborhood is funky in a good way. There are cute restaurants and cafés nearby as well as some areas that are transitioning. We felt very safe in Columbia City. Kathleen's house is near freeways so getting to downtown, stadiums, or the west Seattle bridge was convenient. I would love to stay here again soon! Thanks Kathleen!"
7262142,49650142,2015-10-05,39932197,Jessica,"Kathleen's place was such a treat. After a long day of travel it was such a treat to step onto those heated floors and make a cup of tea! She even had snacks waiting for us and chocolates on the bed. If you are looking for something cozy and wonderful, this is the place to stay near Seattle. Columbia City was a great place to hang out as well with  shops and great places to eat! Thanks Kathleen!"

Thanks for the great stay!"

7262142,51314414,2015-10-19,16021545,Lauren,"Kathleen was very welcoming and she sent lovely instructions on the day we arrived. I was easily able to get into the suite and settled in right away. She has a lovely little garden suite that was perfect for my husband and I to stay in. It was nice to stay outside of downtown, somewhere quiet in a neighborhood I hadn't previously visited on prior visits."
7262142,51763438,2015-10-24,45096692,Kathleen,"We were visiting friends living in the area and we could walk from the Columbia Center light rail stop to Dawson - very nice if you don't want to drive in Seattle.  For us it was an excellent location in a popular Seattle neighborhood.

Kathleen's small apartment suited us to a T.Comfortable bed and pillows, two luggage racks, small kitchen nicely stocked, a table and two chairs.  Very nice bathroom and shower.  "

7262142,53334856,2015-11-08,12725963,Sara,"Great experience with Kathleen and her lovely home. Small, intimate, clean space with everything in tip top shape.

7262142,53978276,2015-11-15,33853607,Bobbie,"What an awesome experience! The accommodations were perfect. Kathleen thought of everything to make her home feel like our own. The apartment is cozy and charming, very clean and comfortable. Perfect little kitchenette made it easy for us to make our own breakfast and reheat leftovers. Great location as well. Easy to grab public transport and plenty of Ubers in the area. Also easy walking distance to fantastic restaurants, bars and cafes! Highly recommend!"

7262142,55565072,2015-12-02,44840449,Allyssa,"Kathleen was very communicative and accommodating to us per our late arrival to Seattle. Her cute space had everything we needed, and felt like our escape from the hustle and bustle of downtown Seattle. We loved all her recommendations in the area that we might not have visited if she hadn't included in her guidebook. Would love to stay there again if we ever return to Seattle!"
7262142,55847497,2015-12-06,940960,Bridgette,"This place was great, it's exactly as described. We had a great stay at Kathleen's place, it was warm, cozy, clean, and comfy! The area of Columbia City is nice and she recommended some great places like the PCC Market and The Royal Room. Seward Park is close by and a nice Park to hike in. And downtown is a short drive away. We love Seattle!!"

7349029,38800212,2015-07-18,33729565,Ariel,This was my BEST airbnb experience ever! The place and view was gorgeous!! Ron was awesome and very accommodating. I would love to stay again. 
7349029,39119498,2015-07-20,35985505,Pierre,"Ron was so nice, the appartment brand new, very comfortable and decorated with taste. The view is amazing. If we come back to Seattle, for sure, we'll visit Ron again"
7349029,39450969,2015-07-23,5506616,Annie,"Ron was very accommodating and kind. Communication was a breeze and getting in and out of the house was as well. We were only for a short trip and very busy while there but the house itself is stunning. It's very new so things are still off-gassing a bit, but it is a gorgeous space. "
7349029,39701734,2015-07-25,17053304,Murat,"I am a weekly business traveler so when my wife and I were in town for a short while I didn't want the airport hotel experience. The place was just as described.  We were both very pleased.  A very nice location that is walking distance (4blocks) to Alki beach. We got a code from Ron so we didn't have to disturb him when we checked in early in the morning.  The unit looks like it was built recently.  Very comfortable bed/bedding, very modern style and a small kitchenette (which we didn't use given our short overnight stay).  This is a great AirBnB experience. Ron introduced himself in the morning when I was sitting in the yard admiring the view.  If you're looking for a place near Seattle don't hesitate to make this your base. "
7349029,40015950,2015-07-27,38155374,Lisa,"What a beautiful home and Ron could not have been more welcoming.  The views from his deck are indeed stunning, and we fell in love with the Alki Beach area of Seattle.  The apartment was immaculate, and again, -the views were breathtaking.  We will definitely stay with Ron again if we find ourselves in Seattle.  "
7349029,41142522,2015-08-04,39199069,Cheryl,Ron was a great host. The suite was well equipped and the views really were stunning. We were able to leave the car behind most days as the beach was a short walk away. We tried many of Ron's recommendations for restaurants and were not disappointed.
7349029,43425974,2015-08-19,21619815,Dave,"Ron was a fantastic host.  He introduced himself while we were admiring the sunset views from his deck when we arrived, offered us a drink, and shared his favorite nearby places to eat and visit.

The apartment is located about half a mile from the beach.  About 2 miles down the beach is the water taxi crossing into downtown Seattle's Pioneer Square.  The crossing is very nice and offers great views of Seattle's skyline.

The apartment was very modern and tastifully furnished. Very clean, quiet and private. Bed is comfortable and warm. Had everything we could have needed!

The apartment itself can get a little chilly, but Ron has thought of this as well, providing a space heater if needed.

Overall we had an excellent experience, and would definitely stay with Ron again if we return to Seattle. Thanks Ron!"
7349029,44454930,2015-08-26,3976520,Nagdeep,"If you are looking for a place to stay in Seattle, Ron has amazing place.  Ron was very responsive with my questions prior to booking and for the booking. Clear instructions on getting to the place and access were delivered to us well in advance of our travel. The space we got to use was beautiful and in a way very calming. All the basics were available in the space including, coffee maker, full size microwave, iron and  ironing board. Everything that you need while you are away from home was thoughtfully offered.  

The neighborhood was pretty cool with beautiful homes and views. Ron's place is within a short walk to the beach with amazing views and places to eat and hangout. This was not a part of the city we stayed on our previous travels but it is a good spot to be in, even with a toddler. Would love to visit again to explore the area more. "
7349029,44789155,2015-08-29,564657,Loren,"While we didn't get a chance to meet Ron, his studio was super comfortable and welcoming. The views from the driveway and the outside deck were stunning! What an awesome neighborhood and an easy walk to the beach and restaurants. Would definitely go back!!"
7349029,45980298,2015-09-07,2863921,Courtney,"We loved our stay at Ron's. The space is very comfortable and has a wonderful aestheticism: from the fireplace, to the comfy down comforter, to the deep soaking tub -- we loved it all! Not to mention the view and just the overall wonderful location. Thanks, Ron! You were a wonderful host and we hope to be back."
7349029,47161544,2015-09-16,39050785,Jennifer,"We had a wonderful time staying at Alki beach. Ron was a wonderful host and the unit was just as pictured; modern, comfortable and immaculate. Just a few blocks to restaurants, coffee and bars. "
7349029,47717880,2015-09-21,22457371,Paul,Ron has an amazing apartment with great views in Seattle. He provided his own guide of things to do and to see around the area. The bathroom looked amazing and the living space also has nice art pieces. Would totally book again when I am back in the area. 
7349029,49361903,2015-10-03,36759633,Chloe,Had a fantastic stay. Great location and gorgeous place to stay. Immaculate set up.
7349029,50006537,2015-10-08,11775554,Melody,"What a lovely space! Rob was very welcoming and available when we had a question (or forgot the wine opener). His house is in a hill which allows for beautiful views which are especially enjoyed from the hottub. It was easy to find and get to many wonderful restaurants and very close to the beach. Would recommend!
"
7349029,50492578,2015-10-12,23273624,Bret,"Ron was amazing. He was incredibly accommodating, communicated very well, and has a fantastic listing. He did a great job renovating the room, everything is new and modern and clean. After a bad previous experience, this restored our faith in AirBnB. The views of this place are phenomenal. The location is great. If you are looking to visit Seattle, stay here and away from the craziness of downtown, but get the gorgeous skyline views and a quick water taxi over to the city or just a short drive over there. Or you could spend your whole time in West Seattle, and your time would have been well spent. Alki beach is great, the kayaking is awesome and the running paths are perfect. Head down California Ave to all the great little shops and restaurants. Go visit Lincoln Park and walk or run along the water and in the trees. Hop on a ferry and head to Vashon island for a day. This place is great and you would be missing out if you didn't stay here. "
7349029,51323027,2015-10-19,42943992,Elize,This was such a wonderful experience. It was my first air bnb experience. It was my first time in Seattle.
7349029,53508696,2015-11-09,88104,Jacob,"We had a great time staying at Ron's beautiful apartment. The place was unusually well-designed, impeccably clean, and very comfortable. The location overlooking the water is excellent, and particularly well enjoyed while sitting in the delightful hot tub. Ron was very responsive  and helpful. An all around outstanding experience. We hope to come back soon!"
7349029,53753441,2015-11-12,9827806,Amy,Wonderful space in WS. Private apartment was spacious but the fireplace made it cozy.
7349029,54189998,2015-11-16,39601079,Theodore,"The appartement was very nice, such as the location. 
I spent a great week end."
7349029,55568492,2015-12-02,46890499,Richard,"Ron, 
Thanks for hosting us in your airbnb. Your efficiency apartment is very inviting and well appointed. My wife thought the decor was very stylish and I found the atmosphere was very relaxing...enjoyed the fireplace on the cool evenings.
We appreciated the kitchen and the ability to cook when we chose. It was a great touch to open the door and see the red flower, the welcome note and your suggestions for local points of interest and dining.
This was our first experience using airbnb and you've set the bar at the highest level. 
We enjoyed meeting you and hope to see you again on future trips to the area. Thanks again for everything,
Richard and Lee"
7349029,55731024,2015-12-05,1407685,Kristal,"Upon arrival, we were already amazed by the view from the roads. We couldn't wait to stay in West Seattle. My partner and I spent our anniversary relaxing in Ron's ground level apartment. The apt is very clean, very modern with super cool features built in like a microwave oven and cool dimming lights. The kitchen is very well stoked with basic kitchen essentials. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the curtain that divides the bedroom from the kitchen was a good touch. The bathroom has a really awesome tub, perfect for a relaxing bath. The best part of our experience was the hot tub! Duh! It was raining on and off during our stay but the times we were in the tub, it was cool but not rainy. The tub was perfect warm temp, has cool lights and jets. We hope to be back to visit. Ron was a great host! Very welcoming and responsive. We chilled on our own most of the time but he greeted us with a smile when we got up the driveway (which is steep but my tiny Honda Fit could do it) and bid us a farewell upon departure. It was truly a 5-star experience! Thank you so much for everything! "
7349029,55927797,2015-12-07,48105453,Cathal,"This was my wife and my first Airbnb outing and we couldn't have asked for a better experience. The apartment is very clean and warm with modern furnishings and fixtures. The apartment is within easy walking distance of may of the local restaurants - a list of which Ron provided along with helpful comments about atmosphere and which were his favorites.  Alki Cafe and El Chupacabra were good recommendations!

We would highly recommend this spot.

7349029,56215939,2015-12-10,46258379,Dwight,"Ron is right about the driveway. Going up, difficulty factor 1 out of 10--backing down, 10 out of 10. Okay, 7.5 for a skilled driver like myself. :) After the first night, I found street parking to be just fine. Ron's home and yard are amazing with an open, modern, basement apartment tucked in to the hillside. Everything was brand new; the comfy bed, awsome bathtub and shower plus a kitchen. Because my visit was in December I did not get to take advantage of the deck or hot tub but the fireplace was really nice to have. This is a perfect alternative to a hotel stay for business travelers. West Seattle, Alki Beach and Ron are gems!"
7349029,56324954,2015-12-12,40203263,Fernando,Everything was perfect! The place is amazing and we really enjoyed staying there. For sure we want to come back too. Ron is also really nice and always willing to help with informations etc. highly recommend this place and Ron! 
7349029,57057874,2015-12-21,576691,Dickson,"Ron's place was very clean, cozy, and comfortable. The kitchen was fully stocked with pots, pans, dishes, and utensils, so cooking was easy. The place was in the heart of West Seattle by Alki Beach, in close proximity to a lot of restaurants and stores. Ron was very communicative and hospitable — definitely recommend staying here!"
7349029,57538576,2015-12-27,40107230,David E.,Ron greeted us at the driveway and was very helpful in getting us settled in. The apartment was cozy and modern with plenty of privacy & well stocked with all the essentials. It was a great place to spend our Christmas. We loved the hot tub and the backyard area. It had an absolutely wonderful view of the water as well. Thank you to Ron for a great holiday!
7349029,57762302,2015-12-29,23856329,Morrigan,"Ron's home exceeded expectations. A beautiful room with lots of space to move around and relax. Even the bathroom made me feel like I was at a chic hotel. As a cleanliness nut, I found his place to be as clean as I keep my own place. I had a fabulous time playing with the Roku and looking through DVDs left for guests. I will definitely come back again and recommend this to all my friends who want to visit Alki beach or even Seattle for that matter. "
7601766,40414833,2015-07-30,33285703,Bradley,"Great host, great neighborhood. As advertised, its an air mattress in a one bedroom apartment. Clean apartment - Micah made me feel at home and even offered to cook breakfast!"

7601766,43123479,2015-08-17,29894501,Mari,Micah was very welcoming and helpful. She always made sure she was reachable via phone/e-mail. Definitely a great place to stay since it's a short 10 minute walk to downtown. Perfect for young twenty something girls!

4172364,28549420,2015-03-25,23000490,Selcuk,"Jerome is one of the best the persons I've known in my life. The house and the room are completely perfect. I liked it more than my home. Especially the neighborhood is very peaceful. You can get rid of the hubbub of the city there. You can find everything you want from a house. I strongly recommend everyone to stay there. And as a person Jerome thinks you more than yourself. And he always smiles.  During my stay I learned so much from Jerome, his stories and experience. It was not like a host and guest relationship it was like we were friends many years. I felt I was visiting not Seattle but Jerome.  Not only for the room and house but also for the personality of Jerome it worths staying there. If your stay request is accepted you can count yourself as a lucky person. Thank you Jerome."
4172364,29648156,2015-04-10,12104454,Janet,"Jerome was so very friendly AND helpful!  Communication was very fast & accurate.  The Blue Room was very clean & comfortable.  In fact, the entire home is very neat & organized!"

4172364,32301432,2015-05-16,17648014,Abhish,Great host and awesome room. Strongly recommend this place. 
4172364,32646973,2015-05-19,25752397,Bruno,"My girlfriend and I wanted a relatively affordable place to stay in Seattle with convenient access to Downtown and Seattle Centre. Jerome's place offered exactly this! On top of that, Jerome is a great host; he was both friendly, knowledgeable of the city and the transit, and was eager to offer us helpful advice.  Moreover, his house is very clean and organized. To sum up, I would recommend Jerome's place to anyone who wants to stay in Seattle!"
4172364,33013345,2015-05-24,32624105,Taufik,"Jerome is a helpful guy who never step down from helping me out. Be it on giving directions, showing me around the house and even lending me his toothpaste. He is nice and a great person to be with. He offered me some fruits and food. Also he likes to talk almost on everything. He is one of the top here in Seattle i think. Just look at other reviews. Best part is his place is convenient to go downtown or to the seatac airport"
4172364,34790363,2015-06-12,26384718,Yanjia,"This is the perfect choice for visitors who want to stay in a quite, clean and organized place for few days. Jerome is very friendly and helpful. He will give you detailed instruction on travelling around the city patiently.  Transportation is convenient because there's a No.8 bus stop two blocks away. The room is extremely clean and furniture are maintained very well. I'm sorry for making some noise in the midnight. The newly replaced hardwood floor is pretty beautiful but also easy to make sounds on it. Unfortunately you cannot cook in the kitchen because it will disturb other tenants. But it should be fine for travelers because there're too many good restaurants in downtown. Overall, it is a great place for you to learn Seattle."
4172364,34987176,2015-06-14,12104454,Janet,"See reviews 1, 2 & 3!"
4172364,35733220,2015-06-21,27391614,Mitch,Jerome was fantastic. He was friendly and welcoming. His house was organized and there was even some food in his fridge he was willing to share. The room was better than I expected and I fully endorse Jerome's air BnB credentials 
4172364,36216420,2015-06-26,28481875,Brian,Clean and organized.  A great stay.  Super close to downtown.  I stayed here in transition to moving to Seattle for work.  Three bus choices on buses to get to work. I had two international house mates which made for great conversations.

He was very accommodating about our late night arrival, and gave great information about transportation and places to visit. The house was incredibly cozy and clean, and was in a nice, safe neighborhood. Also, it was my first time in Seattle, and the house is located very close to most of the tourist spots. Only about a $5 uber/lyft or a short bus ride.

Loved the visit! Would definitely recommend."

He had prepared icy bottled waters and some fruits in the fridge which is nice. Btw one day Jerome asked me to bring an banana with me which is sweet : )  But one thing to remind that the house is convenient to downtown and attractions only by bus so if you carried lots of  luggages then u need to think about it ! 
4172364,40983629,2015-08-03,29955681,Øyvind,Staying with Jerome were a pleasure. The location of the house were situated next to a bus stop with frequent departures to the central areas of Seattle. Jerome were really friendly and always available to answer any questions you might have regarding the accommodation and the city. And a fridge full of water bottles were a really nice thing to have access to during these hot summer days.
4172364,41638769,2015-08-08,7763937,Frederik,"Had an absolute blast at Jerome's! My brother and I stayed in ""the blue room"". Everything was nice and tidy. Bed was very comfortable. Jerome was an awesome host! Never had a dull moment with him.
Even went above and beyound to help us out with our booking when I found out I had messed up the days I originally made my Airbnb booking for. 
Was easy to get downtown from the house. There's a bus very close by or otherwise an uber is about 12$. 

Would most def stay here again when I'm in Seattle again. "
4172364,42425470,2015-08-13,38291089,Yulia,Everything was great! Jerome is very punctual and helpful. The room and house are super-clean and are located in a safe and beautiful area not far away from downtown.  I'd highly recommend the place.
4172364,42934979,2015-08-16,12010305,Hannah,"What a lovely host! Simple, clean room in a great neighborhood with breathtaking views. "
4172364,43664781,2015-08-21,39396170,Steve,"Nice guy.  Quick, but not rushed, tour of the place including everything important and a few extras.  Easy parking in front, made a place for my bike, and I got settled straight away.  Place is super clean.  Bed more comfortable than I expected.  Generally low stress, except I tried to hide my addiction to Diet Pepsi in the midst of bottled water, fresh fruit and Jerome's sincere concern for healthy living. I think we both applied, ""don't ask, don't tell.""  Thanks Jerome.   "
4172364,45276421,2015-09-01,39079658,Michael,Clean and comfortable lodging with decent amenities. Jerome runs a tight ship and was helpful in providing me info to navigate Seattle. 
4172364,46022809,2015-09-07,41829235,Renke,Jerome is a perfect host. Wa had nice conversations and he gave us very helpful advices. Neighbourhood is very calm. Downtown is reachable by bus quickly.
4172364,47763471,2015-09-21,35539695,Zeter,一切都不錯，可惜廚房只能用微波爐，屋主隨時都在廚房，洗衣機烘衣機無法使用
4172364,48452106,2015-09-26,44121129,Sarah,"This was my first time using Airbnb and my first time in Seattle (or the west coast for that matter) and this listing could not have been more perfect!!! The neighborhood was safe, the house was clean (and the room was larger than I expected), and it is extremely easy to use public transit or Uber to get to downtown or Capitol Hill. Jerome is a sweetheart and you should definitely stay with him!"
4172364,49565284,2015-10-04,31931869,Eva,"Very welcoming! I highly recommend Jerome as a host.
All was great! Thank you"
4172364,50372015,2015-10-11,37525899,Sakamoto,Great host I've never seen. Take care of me every time we met.
4172364,51099829,2015-10-17,46485360,Norman,"Everything was very nice, Jerome help me so much giving me information about the transportation, the place was very clean and cozy! Great place to stay."
4172364,51405849,2015-10-19,2405764,Dianne,"Jerome greeted us warmly with a big smile and help with our luggage.  He takes pride in his spotless home in a quiet Seattle neighborhood.  We were able to park our car on the curb in front of the house.  The bedroom is spacious and comfortable.  The spotless bathroom was shared with a couple of other guests.  Jerome is a very friendly and helpful host, and brewed up our hot coffee in the morning.

A few items worth noting: 1) there are stairs from the street to the front porch, and also up to the second floor bedroom, and 2) the bed was firmer than what I am used to at home.  We appreciated having our own key to the house, and a key to our bedroom.  We will try to stay at Jerome's on a future visit to Seattle.

9157232,54285007,2015-11-17,46165280,Dan,Tania and her father a veer accommodating. Tania father is very knowledgable about the area and gave me some great advice. The hostess quickly responded to my text. Very kind and honest host. Room is comfortable and the full kitchen is a nice addition.  I would recommend a stay with Tania anytime. 
777159,6286725,2013-08-06,999612,Sue,"I had the honor of being the first guest in the Chasan's beautiful home! They were extremely kind, hospitable and flexible, accommodating my request to rent their entire house for my family to stay during a visit to Seattle. Their house has a great deal of character with a lot of cozy spaces from a closed off TV room to a lush back patio. We were welcome to use their laundry room and kitchen freely as well. This is a 2 story house with a basement where one of the bedrooms is so for those with elderly folks or young children, know that there are stairs that are more narrow since its a classic craftsman house - nothing out of the ordinary, just something to be more attentive to. In terms of parking, we never had any problem with parking on the street. Overall, this was a great find in a lovely neighborhood that is close to Seward Park and downtown Seattle where there are few houses of this quality to rent. HIghly recommended. "
777159,9139001,2013-12-09,1093173,Larry,derrick & margaret are gracious & accomodating... i changed my dates at the last minute with no problem.  the mt. baker area is great to walk & with in a couple of miles is the Columbia City area with great food & entertainment.  i would not hesitate to stay here again.
777159,9166708,2013-12-10,1093173,Larry,"comfortable, spacious, with all the comforts!  Derrick & Margaret were fun & engaging.  it is a great area of Seattle with all kinds of options within a few miles!"

777159,15717577,2014-07-14,12887126,Lisa-Susann,"Derrick & Margaret are really good hosts. We were a group of 4 people and visited Seattle just for the weekend. One day before our arrival they had a flood in their basement. Nevertheless they gave us the chance to stay in their house and moved to friends for the weekend so that we could spend the night in their bedroom.
The train to drive to downtown Seattle was really close and great to walk. I would really like to stay here again."
777159,16505346,2014-07-28,18021611,David,"This was our first experience with airbnb and we couldn't have been more pleased with our stay at Derrick and Margaret's lovely home. The peaceful neighborhood was well positioned for our needs being a short walk to the light rail, as well as a short drive to the neat little Columbia City neighborhood. Our hosts were quite accommodating  to our needs and we were pleasantly surprised at the edible items at our disposal in this spacious basement dwelling."
777159,16809309,2014-08-02,18929131,Natalie,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and as our first hosts, the Chasans have set the bar very high!  They have a lovely, just beautiful home and were very flexible, giving our 14-year-old daughter two different options for her sleeping space so she could decide whether to stay close to us or branch out into her own area with a great sleeper-sofa. Very nice little bathroom in the basement area, access to a nice fridge and plenty of things to munch on - including Margaret's delicious cookies! It was easy to make our own coffee but Derrick also generously fixed me a cup when he was around on our second morning.  
We had lots of very comfortable living space to watch tv, read, and relax in the evening after a long day out in the city. We loved the proximity to the Mount Baker light rail station. The residential neighborhood is gorgeous; every home (including our hosts') featured amazing landscaping with abundant and colorful plants, trees, and flowers.  Derrick was extremely helpful both before and during our stay, including: very helpful assistance for getting to their home and for getting around the city; flexibility and assistance with coordinating our arrival and getting us settled in; providing his input when we asked ahead whether we should rent a car; and offering friendly suggestions for what we might like to see and do. He and Margaret are extremely gracious and welcoming, without being at all nosy or intrusive. 

We would love to visit Seattle again, and would consider ourselves very fortunate indeed if the Chasans would be available and willing to share their home and host us again. Based upon this experience, we have every reason to expect that they would be gracious hosts, and we believe they are very worthy of our hearty recommendation."
777159,16866057,2014-08-03,11392235,Gwenn,"We stayed with Derrick for one night while stopling im Seattle on our way to Portland. Derrick was an excellent host. I didn't meet him until the morning, because he was out for dinner when we got in, but he made sure to leave detailed instructions on how to get in and everything was exactly where he said it was. The suite was tidy and very spacious. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay there again."
777159,16949552,2014-08-04,19017708,Alyson,"Derrick's home is in a great part of South East Seattle, central to many cute restaurants and shops, and public transportation. He made us feel very welcome. We enjoyed the sunset with a bottle of wine on the deck, and slept comfortably in the private basement suite. Thanks Derrick for making our first Air BnB experience a great one. "
777159,17542374,2014-08-13,19599193,Henrik,Derrick and his wife were great hosts! Very helpful and friendly. A really nice neighborhood. 
777159,17857636,2014-08-18,18067301,Anne,"We very much enjoyed our Seattle stay. Derrick and Margaret were lovely hosts, happy to recommend restaurants and attractions in the area and share (website hidden) about their travels around the globe. The downstairs suite is very comfortable, with cosy areas to read or watch TV, and even has access to laundry, a fridge, and a toaster if you need it. The house is within walking distance of a light rail stop that takes you to downtown within a few minutes. While the area around the light rail station is perhaps a tad gritty, the neighborhood between the house and Lake Washington is beautiful and provides a gorgeous environment for an invigorating walk."
777159,18742540,2014-08-31,19530073,Kaylee,No complaints! This home was warm and cozy! The best feature for us was that it was a few blocks away from the train station; taking the light rail everywhere saved us a lot of time and parking money. Would definitely stay again. 
777159,35692880,2015-06-21,34309925,Nancy,"My host was very welcoming. The photos of the space give an accurate portrait of where you will be staying. There was plenty of room, huge TV, breakfast goodies, comfortable bed."
777159,37937691,2015-07-11,1243701,Amber,"My partner and I were in Seattle on a last minute trip and needed a good place to stay. Derrick was so great! It was easy to get access to the house, he was very responsive, and everything worked out great. Would recommend Derrick's home to anyone traveling to Seattle! "
777159,38065796,2015-07-12,22332223,Keith S,Derrick and Margaret were wonderful hosts. The daylight basement had all we could ask for and we appreciated their flexibility in the check in/check out time. Light rail and bus stops just a few short blocks away. We'll consider staying with them again next time we're in the area.
777159,38792026,2015-07-18,3241246,Yitao,"I took my wife and baby daughter along for a work trip to Seattle.  We were lucky to find Derrick's cottage!  The house and its charming gardens were well-kept, the furnishing in good-taste (with lots of African influence), and our hosts extremely welcoming without ever being intrusive.  We also enjoyed walking in the delightfully rustic Mt Baker neighborhood as well as the parks and beaches by Lake Washington.  My wife and I loved our Seattle experience.  We would definitely visit Derrick and his family if we ever come back to Seattle!"
777159,40963873,2015-08-03,37934714,Rachel,"The space is great - it's cosy but elegant. Derrick is really wonderful - kind, accommodating, and very easy going. The neighborhood is nice too. Just a few blocks from the Light Rail and close to lots of buses. And just a few blocks from a great park and Lake Washington!"
777159,41515689,2015-08-07,26128569,Sally,"Very comfortable and attractive downstairs space with bedroom, private bath and kitchen area. Big TV, many books and treats in the refrigerator. Terrific location near the Mount Baker light rail station, also near a city park with playground, pretty 
tree-lined streets for strolling and a bar/restaurant with good espresso. The hosts are a charming couple, thoughtful, gracious and welcoming. We liked them a lot and plan to return soon, as we have family nearby.  We’re very glad we found this spot!"
777159,44932533,2015-08-30,3142714,Allison,"They are really kind and welcoming hosts. They even made coffee in the morning and offered to pick us up when it was raining! Their house is a beautifully appointed craftsmen home, and the downstairs guest area is spacious and comfortable with wifi. It's also filled with interesting artwork and books."
8068232,45875596,2015-09-06,42775897,Kristen,"Arthur was a great host - super responsive and flexible with check in/out times. He even provides a booklet with recommendations for things to do if you're not familiar with the area. There's a great little rooftop deck that unfortunately we didn't get to enjoy as it was grey/rainy during our stay, but his place is clean and has all the amenities you could need. Parking is reasonable and it was nice to have a washer & dryer in-unit. Great location and close to public transportation!"
8068232,47399334,2015-09-18,40224273,Ramiro,Arthur was kind enough to meet us at the apartment based on our flight arrival time. The unit was exactly as described in the listing. The inflatable bed is actually really comfortable. The apartment is situated on a hill but Arthur made us aware of this prior to arrival. So we had no surprises. The neighborhood is great. Its about 2 blocks away from the light rail drop off. He also left us with an information binder. It had pretty much everything we needed to know about the unit and the neighborhood/city. It was very well prepared and useful for us. The unit is walking distance from a lot of places to eat. Its about a 10-15 minute walk to Safeco Field. We're already planning a return trip to Seattle and I would not hesitate to book a stay at Arthurs apartment in the future!
8068232,49648511,2015-10-05,15049346,Margaret,"Arthur was extremely kind and helpful! He worked around our schedule for out arrival and departure, and had a handy binder ready with info about his apartment and the surrounding neighborhood. His place was minimalist, but very clean and comfortable. Everything was pleasant!"
7096547,51591181,2015-10-21,30199365,Ryan,"Dylan and his wife are awesome!! The place was amazing!! Very clean, open, and the hot tub is a major bonus. Also if your looking for a realtor, he is your man.  The location is the best on Alki. The beach is just steps away from there house. Dylan and his wife are very friendly and very knowledgeable about the area.  I would highly recommend there place for any visit to west Seattle. I would definitly stay here anytime!! "
6276224,46289130,2015-09-09,39639991,Alexa,"We had a lovely time here! The listing was even better in person-very roomy and comfortable. The apartment is tucked away in a beautiful brick building, very serene, and yet is less than a 3 min walk from the Seattle Center! Ashley is a great host and left us with all the pertinent information (wifi, laundry, key exchange, etc) as well as plenty of suggestions for local places to check out! I loved my stay in Seattle, and I would highly recommend staying at Ashley's place. "
6276224,47074191,2015-09-15,34189149,Jill,"Ashely was an incredible host.  She was always available for questions and very quick to respond to messages.  The house was as-advertised and worked perfect for our trip.  We spent most of our days eating and walking downtown.  The neighborhood was great and within walking distance to the Space Needle.  Getting downtown was easy.  We walked (although a little long, but a good workout) and took public transportation.  We also used Lyft to get around, which cost approximately $6 to get downtown.  We had a great time and highly recommend Ashley's place for your stay downtown!"
6276224,48770855,2015-09-28,37152050,Michael,The apartment was perfect for us and it was nicely cleaned and tidied before our arrival.  The Wi-Fi (always a concern!) was clearly posted as were direction to the grocery.  We also appreciated that Ashley had provided a stock of coffee after our long trip from the East! 
1844791,9169360,2013-12-10,8333594,Jennifer,"Charlie and Sarah were very friendly and accommodating hosts! They were always quick to respond to communication. They welcomed us warmly and left a detailed contact and instruction sheet. The house was in a very safe and nice neighborhood, and parking was no problem. The house was well kept and clean, though it is an older home (had character :). The upstairs bathroom was very nice and remodeled. The upstairs master bedroom was roomy but felt somewhat attic-y with low ceilings--still cozy. The overall house was decorated with lots of interesting art, kind of eclectic and fun. "
1844791,9230844,2013-12-15,10196450,Janet,"We had the pleasure of meeting Sarah and Charlie and staying in their wonderful home. They are very gracious hosts.  The atmosphere truly felt like a home, not a rental. The decor was full of unique art, the beds very comfortable, great quiet neighborhood. Only a couple of blocks away are wonderful restaurants, coffee shops, market. Be sure to go to the Italian Restaurant, great Hazelnut Pesto! We loved every minute of being there. 
I would give a million stars if there was room!! Thank you so much for making our stay in Seattle memorable!!! Janet"
1844791,9831895,2014-01-13,1333561,Mike,Perfect location to be in Seattle and Charlie and Sarah were beyond great to deal with.  The house slept the 5 of us comfortably and is located in a great neighborhood with endless choices of shops and restaurants to walk to.  When we got there Sarah greeted us and made sure we had everything we needed and the house is very homey.  We would certainly stay again and would highly recommend the house to friends and family traveling to Seattle.  
1844791,12624067,2014-05-06,3811127,Amy,Great time!   House amazing.   Hosts awesome.   Very easy rental.   Location is perfect.   We had wonderful time and will definitely book this home again!!!!!
1844791,13224075,2014-05-22,7402289,Leia,Thank you so much!  My folks really enjoyed all the space and thought your home was beautiful.  Communication was easy and all logistics smooth. Thank you!
1844791,13624024,2014-06-01,15075315,Vicky & Aaron,"We met Charlie and Sara, they have a wonderful and welcoming home. It was exactly what I expected based off the description. The house is well stocked. I couldn't be happier and highly recommend the house. "
1844791,14262152,2014-06-16,7883921,Palomita,"Charlie and Sarah are kind, helpful and all around wonderful people. Their house is beautiful, very comfortable and clean. The neighborhood is excellent. Quiet and wonderful shops within walking distance and with easy access bus stops to most places in Seattle. They have a booklet of Seattle info and are easy to reach if you need anything. This experience was exceptional and we are looking forward to renting with them again, the next time family comes into town. "
1844791,15023561,2014-07-01,751712,Jennifer,What an amazing experience! Charlie and Sarah were amazing hosts. The home was absolutely beautiful and comfortable. The home was clean and well loved. We needed to check in a little early and Sarah and Charlie were very accommodating. Whenever my family comes back to town we will definitely stay here again. 
1844791,15855900,2014-07-17,10137570,Roland,"Charlie and Sarah's home in Freemont was a perfect fit for our trip to Seattle for our daughter's wedding.  The back deck was great for visiting with our friends from out of town, the kitchen was bright and cheery, the living room and dining room provided lots of room for wedding prep, and the bedrooms were all very comfortable.  Sarah met us on our arrival and was very welcoming, giving us a run down of both the house and Seattle attractions; Charlie and Sarah even brought by an extra fan during our stay, as they were worried the house would be too warm for us with all the sunny and hot days in a row that Seattle was experiencing.  In addition to the space and hospitality, the house had a lot of character with a vast array of decorations and artwork that provided a personal touch.  If you are in Seattle, I would highly recommend this home as a place to stay."
1844791,17996326,2014-08-20,14088521,Shane,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Sarah and Charlie's home in Fremont! They were accommodating from the start of our trip, allowing us to check in 2 hours earlier than normal. The house is beautiful; the breakfast bar, dining room, and deck are great places to gather as a group and relax, and the bedrooms were spacious and comfortable, even for a group of six. We enjoyed playing the piano and preparing meals in the excellent kitchen as well. The house is in a fantastic location, mere blocks from many delightful restaurants and stores (including a grocery store we frequented) in one direction and about a mile from downtown Fremont and downtown Ballard in two others. In addition, it has easy access to direct bus lines to downtown Seattle and plenty of room for parking if you bring a car. We were very glad to be able to prepare for our busy days of Seattle tourism in the comfort of Sarah and Charlie's home, and were equally grateful to be able to return to its quiet privacy at the end of each day. We hope to stay again in the future!"
1844791,18255826,2014-08-24,18589254,Justin,"Charlie and Sarah were an absolute pleasure to make my first rental through Airbnb and the house was perfect for our needs. My whole family (8 people!) were meeting in Seattle for three nights before taking off for a cruise in Alaska. My father is ill and as a result wasn't planning on touring the city as aggressive as the rest of us - therefore we needed a place for the family to spend some time throughout the day that was accommodating for a large group and this house worked out great - especially the large back deck that comfortably fit the eight of us.

Sarah met us at the house and was extremely pleasant during her overview of the house and you could tell just how much she really loved the house when she explained the details. This is an old house (100 years I think she said) with a lot of character and the wood work is fantastic. The age of the house means there are a lot of charming intricacies (i.e. needing to flip a light switch on once for one light or twice for a second light, switch for the kitchen vent tucked under a cabinet) which were neat. One person from our group owns a custom cabinet company and he was very impressed with the layout of the kitchen and the woodwork throughout. I wasn't able to meet Charlie personally but I did speak to him many times over the phone as he was very responsive to my questions.  The house was even ready slightly ahead of the expected time (which was good because my parents arrived about an hour early from the airport even though I tried to convince them to hang out in the bar at Sea-Tac until 3 PM).

The area is a great location to have peace and quiet while still enjoying all that Seattle has to offer - in the neighborhood nearby is one of the best sandwich places I've ever had (Paseos) along with coffee and wine bars that are extremely cute. There is a grocery store (Fred Meyers) nearby with reasonable pricing and the previous guests even left some goodies in the cabinets/fridge for us (coffee, creamer, eggs, oatmeal) which we tried to replace before we left so that Charlie & Sarah didn't feel the need to replenish.  It is also quite easy to get down to the main areas - the five bus takes you right down to the Space Needle or Pike Market.

All-in-all, the house was better than advertised and they even brought an Aerobed over for us so we could get two additional people into the house before our cruise to Alaska (our 7th and 8th people arrived on Friday night and stayed one night only). The house was charming and the back deck was perfect for our group - I'd highly recommend this option to anyone visiting Seattle and hoping to enjoy the city without the hustle/bustle of being right downtown.  "
1844791,18780069,2014-09-01,9927526,Ruth,"We booked the house  for the location and because it looked really lovely on the photos. I was keen to use the piano, and the kitchen looked very well equipped. We had plenty of communication prior to our arrival, checking on when we  would arrive. We were made very welcome, Charlie and Sarah's friend met us and took us round the house. We were encouraged to use books, music, toiletries, etc and to feel at home. Everything was clean and ready for us.
There was also a good folder of local information, restaurant menus and tourist maps of the area.
The house did not disappoint. It is filled with wonderful artworks, eclectic collections of all sorts, books galore, a CD collection that we immediately recognised, in addition to some quirky features like a roll top bath. The whole house if full of character.
The kitchen was well stocked with equipment and some foods too, which we were able to use, an extensive collection of herbs and spices, and there was a great barbecue on the deck.
The laundry in the basement was shared with a lady who rents the apartment below the house, but this was never a problem.
We also had plenty of hot water, towels and toilet rolls etc supplied, so it was really easy to move straight in.
The three bedrooms coped fine with 5 of us, the two youngest shared a queen size bed, and if we had need it there was plenty of closet space.
The lounge was cosy but very comfortable, with leather sofas and footstools, and the dining room area became a games room for our boys. We had a choice of where to eat- kitchen, dining room or on the deck where more furniture was set out.
Two bedrooms are upstairs, one down. All the floors are vinyl, tiled or wooden and are easy to keep clean.
Location-wise the house was perfect; two minutes walk to the bus stop into the city, same to the restaurants and coffee shops round the corner. 
The main streets in Fremont are a 15 minute walk down the hill, and a 20 minute walk back up a very steep hill. Parking there is no problem though. There are wonderful places to eat and drink in the area. The nearest supermarket is very expensive but good quality, but there is also a large supermarket 5 minutes away in the car (Fred Meyer in Ballard)
Buses are reliable and cheap if driving into Seattle is more hassle, and it is generally quite easy to get around. The 5 is the nearest, although we got confused at first, as it becomes the 21 when it gets downtown.
So all in all we were very happy with the house and would highly recommend it to visitors to Seattle.

"
1844791,19836704,2014-09-19,20625764,Constance,"My husband and I stayed in Fremont for 4 nights while visiting family nearby.  The home was lovely and well cared for by Charlie and Sarah.  They welcomed me promptly upon my arrival and gave me a tour of the home.  It looks exactly like the photos online.  The neighborhood is a bit of a mix, but very close to restaurants, shopping and public transit to downtown.  I walked to Gas Works Park and Green Lake.  The place reminded me of my grandparents house and I felt quite at home there.  Charlie and Sarah followed up my second day to be sure everything was fine, which it was.  We have stayed at the Mayflower Hotel on Olive several times, but for only $30 more we got an entire house.  I could do laundry and cook a few meals.  We had plenty of space to relax.  The back deck must be brand new!  We have an older property so are not bothered by old fashioned tubs or bathroom conversions.  They are a little tricky to deal with but all a part of the package when staying in a home built in 1901.  Kitchen was nicely equipped with utensils and spices, etc.  I hope to stay there again when I return to Seattle.  Great hosts and excellent value!"

1844791,21031980,2014-10-10,18648004,Gail,"Charlie and Sarah were very easy to communicate with, and always responded promptly.  Their house is 100 years old, and very eclectic. They are obviously collectors, and there are many, many, many examples of that. 
The neighborhood is nice, and there are lots of restaurants, etc within walking distance. Keep in mind that anywhere you walk to, (out of the immediate vicinity) is downhill, and you'll have to hike back up later. This wasn't a problem for us, but might be for some.
There were a few issues. Several of the doors (including bedrooms + bathrooms) don't close, which could be an issue for some. 
There is a downstairs tenant (that we weren't aware of before we paid for the rental), and a request for ""quiet hours"" between 10 pm and 8 am, which we also didn't know.  We were on vacation with our family, and hadn't seen each other in over a year. Some of us are night owls, and had we known about the ""quiet hours"",  we would've looked elsewhere.  Just a couple of things that probably should be in the house description. Getting the bus into the city was a breeze as well. Thank you Charlie and Sarah."
1844791,22199890,2014-11-01,22169683,Lalanya,"Sarah was a lovely and helpful host. Their home was cozy and inviting yet spacious. We so enjoyed our meals at the great table in the kitchen. In addition to the main furnace, space heaters kept us toasty upstairs during the cool rainy nights. Nice neighborhood and easily walkable to everything in Fremont. "
1844791,22436368,2014-11-06,22549089,Yang,"This is a wonderful appartment in a very nice area. Comfort, beautiful design, spacieus and lovey atmosphere. Charlie and Sarah was so nice to communicate and we have had wonderful days in Seattle. 
"
1844791,22576309,2014-11-10,3056350,Sean,"My wife and I shared this lovely space with her family who were in town for her sister's wedding.  Fremont is a very charming neighborhood, and the same can be said for the house.  The whole place receives fantastic light throughout.  The sunny breakfast nook was our favorite feature.  It allowed for long meals in the company of good family.  We also put the dining table to use one night for a big dinner.  The owners made sure we were checked in and shown around right on time.  We would gladly stay here again when we come back.    "
1844791,29843022,2015-04-13,21189694,Bryan,"Sarah was very welcoming, meeting us at her home and showing us around. Coordination was very easy between Charlie and Sarah. This very quirky and cool home was a hit with myself and my brothers staying here during my wedding week. Thanks so much!"

1844791,32601099,2015-05-19,28572754,Nikki,"Charlie and Sarah were very helpful and flexible leading up to, during and post our stay. The house is a cute, eclectic craftsman home (note that there are stairs leading up to the upstairs bedrooms) in a great location! Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
1844791,33286046,2015-05-26,23550142,Kali,"The location of the home is great with some really good restaurants, parks and coffee shops nearby.  The zoo is within walking distance as is Greenlake.  The home is really lovely and bright.  We had a great time!  If you have young children (4) the stairs may be too steep (and are wooden, so tripping hazard) and there are lots of personal effects from the owners around which could be hard to keep little hands off of.  Our kids were just fine but they are all over the age of four.  Sarah was super responsive, lovely, nice and helpful.  Having her meet us was really helpful to get situated with the house since it is an older home.  There is a parking spot which is great for the neighborhood.  The house is very creaky, but again it is old, so to be expected.  Bathrooms and kitchen are updated and work well.  There are lots of staples throughout the house so makes packing much easier.  But there are lots of personal items throughout so if that bothers you, keep it in mind.  However, I would recommend this house!"
1844791,34015270,2015-06-03,18335788,Elizabeth,"The delightful property manager was waiting for us when we arrived. She showed us where everything was and made herself available. This gorgeous home exceeded our expectations! Everything was as described in the listing in terms of facilities. However, the charm of the home can't be fully conveyed in words! The home is both aesthetically please and totally comfortable - we made ourselves completely at home, having guests, cooking and grilling. We enjoyed visiting the area but the house was also a big part of a family reunion type of vacation. We loved the Fremont area - everything is totally in walking distance! We sampled several restaurants, both coffee houses and markets. The neighborhood seemed safe - we walked and went running at night. A few nights, younger neighbors were up late talking and laughing on the porch and one couple had a big fight in the middle of the night - the neighborhood is very young and densely populated. This was a minor inconvenience however Charlie went out of his way to call and inquire about the ""big fight"" as well as apologize. We had plenty of information about who to call if any problem came up and lots of information about the Seattle and Washington area. Thumbs up!! and thanks."
1844791,37083314,2015-07-04,2262134,Mark,"Sarah and Charlie kept in touch with us as we slogged through highway traffic and made us feel welcome and at home from the moment of our arrival. Sarah greeted us, showed us the ins and outs and all the details of the home. Charlie pointed us to the best local eats and places not to miss. While a heat wave descended on Seattle they were ready to go with fans and coolers to get us through the afternoon heat before the evening breeze cooled things off each night.

It was wonderful to stay in a lovely home, in a blissfully quiet, calm, residential neighborhood just a few blocks from a number of hopping local restaurants, a well stocked neighborhood market, and easy access to downtown Seattle whenever we headed that way.

We'd happily visit again!"
1844791,37457976,2015-07-07,14139792,Shiming,"Sarah and Charle are very friendly hosts, they were not around when we arrived but they arrange their agent to greeting us. The house was cozy, clean and very convenient to downtown area. Just what we expected. Sarah and Charlie always checking with us during our stay if everything is going well. If you travel to Seattle and want to avoid the  crowds, I highly recommend Sarah and Charlie' s place as your temporary home. "
1844791,39491805,2015-07-24,32825125,David,"Sarah was very accommodating, friendly and helpful. We were late arriving due to a lengthy flight delay. Our orientation to the house was full and easy. The house is a charming Craftsman style with lots of updates. It was well appointed with great attention to detail -- very homey for our family visit. The neighborhood is quiet and within walking distance to restaurants and a grocery (2 blocks). Seattle is an easy drive. The kitchen and back deck are a delightful combined space where we spent much of our time...so pleasant. We thoroughly enjoyed the visit -- thank you Sarah and Charlie.  "
1844791,46265072,2015-09-09,26245499,Tim,"House is in a fantastic location. It's two blocks away from a decent grocery store (Marketime) and some good restaurants, including RockCreek Seafood and Paseo, both of which have been on Eater Seattle's Essential 38 Seattle Restaurants list. There's also a park with a playground three blocks away.  It's close to 99 for quick access to destinations by car. The house itself was quiet, with no noticeable noise from the restaurants and bars two blocks away. We didn't hear any noise from the downstairs neighbor in the separate unit either.

The house itself is old and charming. The upstairs bedrooms have skylights that can open, and the kitchen has nice tall windows that let in a lot of light. You'll also find old-house quirks, like a bedroom door without a door catch, and some of the drawers still had the owner's knickknacks in them but we still had plenty of space for our stuff. 

We had a 2-yr-old and a 3-yr-old with us. With all the trinkets and decor, we kept an eye on the kids, but for the most part they weren't tempted by all the neat new things to touch. You might want to inquire about a baby gate if your toddlers aren't good stair climbers. Two bedrooms are up a wooden staircase to the 2nd floor.

At the time of the rental, the owners managed the rental themselves. They were very nice and super responsive when I needed to find something in the house or ask where to find necessities in town.

All in all we were very satisfied with our stay. The location was perfect for us. My toddler is still talking about how he wants to go back to a Seattle rental house one day for his honeymoon."
1844791,49450024,2015-10-04,32449982,Diana,"We had a great time and this house was perfect.  Our hosts Charlie and Sarah were always quick to response with answers to any of my questions before our arrival. Nancy was wonderful when she greeted us at the house. This place was in the perfect location.  We had restaurants, grocery store and the bus all within a couple of blocks.  My friends and I enjoyed breakfast in the kitchen and wine on the deck. The best part was as three grown adults we all got our own bedroom.  This was way better than a hotel and worth the price.  The artwork through out the house sparked great conversations. I would definitely stay there again if I return to Seattle."
4616634,25910087,2015-01-29,5118936,Sue,We loved this place.  It had everything we needed and felt like home.  The only thing that would have made it better would be a bigger bed.  (The bed is a full-size murphy bed that converts to a table.)  It was quiet except for an occasional bark or two and private.  Cyndy was very gracious and responsive to our needs.  We felt lucky to have made such a find and hope to stay there again next visit.
4616634,26724353,2015-02-17,5125326,Carlos,"A true hidden gem, literary a tree house, just a short ride away from downtown Seattle. It's perfect for a weekend gateaway. Fits 2 people comfortably. Cyndy's studio is in a residential area for which I felt really safe. I had a little bit of a concern leaving my brand new car on the street but as soon I drove in the area it felt really safe. I really enjoyed my stayed while in Seattle."
4616634,26951147,2015-02-22,27642797,Caitlin,"Listing is accurate: cute, cozy apartment in a lovely neighbourhood. Cyndy was easy to communicate with and left us out an extra aerobed. We stayed only one night and only just to sleep but would be a good place to use a homebase seattle"
4616634,27807522,2015-03-12,28163121,Eric,"Cyndy's place was great! Very private with off street parking that was greatly appreciated. I had a couple unexpected guests for a few nights and being new to air B&B I half expected  it would cause problems with Cyndy but she proved to be a very generous and gracious host. 
Thank you Cyndy!"
4616634,28371949,2015-03-22,13096314,Mary,"The apartment was so cozy and cute, and Cyndy was a wonderful host. Feels like you are in a lovely little tree house! I would definitely recommend this space!"
4616634,28432320,2015-03-23,17086674,Reyni,"The apartment was exactly as described! Very cozy, and a great use of space. We stayed just one night here while in the city for business, and it was perfect.  Had everything we needed from a hot shower to a great coffee machine.  Awesome location, plenty of parking, so close to Ballard and easy access to the rest of the city.  Wish we would have been able to stay longer and walk around the neighborhood more to enjoy all the trees and flowers in bloom right now.  We didn't get the chance to meet Cyndy as we arrived too late, but everything was set up and ready for us! I would definitely stay here again when back in Seattle. "
4616634,28547408,2015-03-25,9543532,Curtis,Cindy was easy to communicate with and responsive to requests. The apartment was beautiful with an upscale (and apparently new) interior.  
4616634,29713357,2015-04-11,22782715,Liz,"She made me feel like I was at home by texting me on time to make sure everything g is ok prior to my arrival, she had nice blankets and nice shampoo:) also very thing was perfectly clean and organized I was really happy "
4616634,30245061,2015-04-19,30796398,Ricardo,"We ran into Cyndy upon arrival. She was very welcoming and even offered us a bottle of wine! The description was very accurate, it did feel like we were in a tree house. The apartment was very clean and even had a  luxurious feel to it with heated floor tiles in the restroom! The place was everything we expected and more. We will definitely come back in the future. Thanks Cyndy! "
4616634,30310591,2015-04-20,15395387,Carrie,"Fantastic! The apartment was beautiful (so much light!) and very comfortable. The location was perfect for us - quiet in the immediate neighborhood around the house, but an easy walk down to shops and delicious restaurants. We'd happily stay here again!"
4616634,30535336,2015-04-23,30715294,Mark,"Cyndy was accommodating and made sure we had everything we needed.  The space was very efficient and perfect for our little get away.  I appreciated the way everything was put together, and if I had a space like that of my own, I would make it very similar.  As another reviewer noted, the heated floor in the bathroom (including the shower) was a great touch.

It was an easy walk into the heart of Ballard where there are plenty of places for food and entertainment (and shopping if you are into that).  We parked our car and walked everywhere.

I would certainly book with Cyndy again!"
4616634,32248699,2015-05-16,20380367,Sara,The apt is gorgeous - really well planned for a small space.  I had everything I needed to enjoy my 2 week visit.  
4616634,32423510,2015-05-17,26851421,Megan,"Our stay at Cyndy's bnb was excellent! I was pleasantly surprised upon walking in because honestly, the photos don't quite do it justice! Very spacious, bright, clean and comfortable. Had everything we needed for a comfortable night's stay, I even bugged them for cream and sugar in the morning and they brought it to me right away. Ample street parking in a charming Seattle neighborhood. Great first airbnb experience. :)"

4616634,32834809,2015-05-22,27169157,Amanda,"This ""treehouse"" studio was so comfortable and in a great location for us. It was the perfect place to call home for a few days.  The neighborhood was so quaint. We enjoyed walking to Cafe Besalu and Golden Gardens Park. A beautiful space that we'd gladly book again! Thank you, Cyndy, for sharing your home with us for a few days. I can't wait to visit again!"
4616634,33111590,2015-05-25,2649546,Chelsea,"We loved Cyndy's studio! Cyndy is a great host - she was very accommodating when we had to make a change to our reservation and was always quick to respond to any questions we had. She has a LOVELY studio. It is tucked away behind her home above the garage. It is so quiet, clean, ADORABLE, and had everything we needed for our stay. We would most definitely stay here again! Thanks Cyndy!!"
4616634,33396042,2015-05-27,14050076,Rebecca,"The host was very hands off, but we didn't need her for anything either so that worked for us. She let us know what the passcode was, and we got in fine. The place was exactly what we were looking for - very clean, full of light, and had everything we needed. The bed was comfortable. We loved our stay, and would definitely be back! Thank you. :) "
4616634,33468994,2015-05-28,28948062,Melanie,"I can't say enough about Cyndy and her adorable studio in the trees!  Talk about extraordinary space planning...the high ceiling and open concept made the place feel airy and inviting. The super cute, newly done bathroom with heated floors felt like a mini spa, which was such a treat after a 4 day camping trip at the Gorge.  Such a wonderful place to lay your head down and enjoy the skylights and views of the trees surrounding the property. 

Thank you for your hospitality, Cyndy! 

- Melanie + Clinton"
4616634,33692839,2015-05-31,32118202,Eddie,This place was great. Exactly as advertised. A perfect place to stay while vacationing in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle.
4616634,34211217,2015-06-06,10558922,George,"Cyndy was great! Communication was really good and although we didn't meet in person, she was available for questions. Place was immaculate, and due to the new construction, everything was very new and had a modern look to it. Would definitely stay here again if I visit Seattle in the future!"
4616634,34598331,2015-06-09,1345988,John,"Loved the studio.  Modern, clean, and with lots of natural light.  Comfortable bed.  Very private too.  Good communication with Cindy, who will provide any assistance that you may need, otherwise she stays out of your way.  We wanted to stay in Ballard, so the location was great for us.  Definitely one of my best airbnb experiences!  Thanks Cyndy."
4616634,35018912,2015-06-14,26297777,Chris,"What a wonderful place to stay in Seattle!  It's a charming a quiet studio nestled in the treetops.  Cyndi provided us with clean towels and sheets as well as her contact info for any reason.  We loved how close this studio was to Golden Gardens park.  If you are looking for an extremely pleasant experience, look no further.  Thanks again Cyndi!"
4616634,35334595,2015-06-17,34931252,Steven,"The space was great, very comfortable and convenient. The neighborhood was very peaceful and pretty. Cyndy was a fantastic host."
4616634,35592840,2015-06-20,3518456,Emily,"I rented Cyndy's apartment for my mom while she was in town.  My mom really enjoyed her stay- the space was clean, modern, light and really well taken care of.  The location is quiet and residential but very close to the heart of Ballard- just perfect!

Thanks for a great experience, Cyndy! "
4616634,35920933,2015-06-23,28944314,Kristy,"What a wonderful experience for our first AirBnB stay! Cyndy and her husband were welcoming and great hosts. We didn't see much of them, but when we did they were very kind. The suite is beautiful, the photos don't do it justice! So much light, so many windows, and the skylights over the bed are a beautiful touch. It was great to be within walking distance of some lovely shops, and only a half hour bus ride to downtown. We loved our stay here, and would definitely stay again if we return to Seattle!"
4616634,36108948,2015-06-25,33783884,Jordan,"My girlfriend and I stayed in Cyndy's wonderful studio apartment above the garage for two nights. Its the most spacious studio I've ever been in, with tons of natural light! Open all the windows and it feels like you're up in the trees. The apartment comes with basic amenities if you want to stay in and make dinner at home (which we did one night), but its also an easy walk down to the shops and restaurants of Ballard which are plentiful and worth exploring. You can also walk 5 or so blocks east and catch a bus straight to downtown Seattle. If you're looking for a quiet, private, cozy place to hang your hat after exploring what Seattle has to offer - Cyndy's apartment is the perfect place for it!"
4616634,36236812,2015-06-26,36226546,Krista,Great place! Thanks so much.
4616634,36780321,2015-07-01,32077174,Diane,"Cyndy graciously met us upon arrival.  The apartment is bright, clean and welcoming. It had everything we needed for a 5 day stay. The neighborhood is quiet, and we enjoyed beautiful flower gardens on our short walk to shopping and restaurants.  The location is great. "
4616634,37052853,2015-07-04,10198507,Sean,"Cyndy was very nice and responsive and the place was perfect.  The apartments was clean and stocked with everything we needed.  There was no iron, but I asked Cyndy about it and she promptly brought one to us.  I would absolutely stay at this place again."
4616634,37165406,2015-07-05,26228517,Martha,We really enjoyed our stay! The apartment has plenty of room and is very comfortable. The apartment is secluded and quiet and also very convenient to several restaurants. 
4616634,37450485,2015-07-07,29642270,Rick,Place was very nice and clean.  It was just what we needed to get a good rest.
4616634,37610719,2015-07-08,3223193,Jessica,"Cyndy's place was perfect! Clean, comfortable and spacious. Cyndy greeted us and offered coffee in the morning. She let us do our own thing but was available if we needed. I will definitely stay at Cyndy's place next time I'm in town. "
4616634,39903168,2015-07-27,27563784,Christine,"The cozy studio apartment is wonderful!  Clean, fresh, and beautiful!  It met all my needs!  I was able to read, sleep, exercise, cook and still had room left over.  The host is very friendly and always was available for any needs I had. I highly recommend the cozy studio apartment.  The neighborhood is safe and friendly and within walking distance of parks and restaurants.  What a great place to stay!  Thank you! "
4616634,40225225,2015-07-29,35521373,Kevin,"Cyndy and her place were both great! We didn't need much from her, but she was quickly and helpfully responsive when we reached out with questions. Her place was just as described, and was perfect for our stay. Highly recommended!"
4616634,40598175,2015-08-01,35245451,Kim,"My husband and I really enjoyed our two night stay in Ballard! We were within walking distance of everything we wanted to do there. Cyndy made it very easy to arrive and get settled into her beautiful space. Everything was clean and like new. Nice shower and spacious enough to relax at the end of the day. So much nicer and affordable than a hotel. We will certainly go back.
Kim from Colorado"
4616634,40910935,2015-08-03,33943262,Matthew,"Our stay at the cozy studio apartment was fantastic. The location was great, walking distance (about 15 minutes) from the downtown Ballard area and right off the 40 bus line for easy access to the rest of the city. The apartment was charming, clean, and nicely decorated. The Murphy bed is a fun touch though in our personal experience we left it in bed mode the entire time, never in the ""up"" or table positions. The apartment is detached from the rest of the house above a garage, so it was nice and quiet. The kitchen is modestly stocked with eating utensils, instant coffee, tea, glassware, plates and bowls, an electric kettle, and other niceties. Wifi was reliable. Overall a great stay, thanks Cyndy!"
4616634,41937600,2015-08-10,16971508,Stephanie,"My boyfriend and I spent one night in Cyndy's studio apartment and overall we had a great time. The apartment was very clean and cutely decorated. For staying in an apartment above a garage in the middle of August, it stayed comfortably cool in there. I just loved the adorable bathroom and really appreciated that she provided shampoo and conditioner because I forgot mine. Her street is so quiet which we also appreciated. We live in a busy part of Portland where we constantly hear cars drive by so it was almost eerie how silent her street is. Aside from hearing a neighbor kid play in his yard for a few minutes, we heard nothing the whole time we were there. Just a note: if you're like me and don't pay close attention to the listed Amenities, this unit does not have a TV so be sure to bring a book or your own device for entertainment purposes. I feel I should also mention one more thing: we saw a few ants in the apartment the night before and when were cleaning up the next morning to leave, the kitchen counter was positively CRAWLING with ants. I know its normal for ants to come in doors in the summer (and I promise, the place is very clean!) so I'm not holding that against her, I'm just saying...there may be ants. Other than that, the place was perfect and is such a steal compared to hotel prices. Lastly! We recommend Portage Bay Cafe for breakfast about a mile away. CRAZY GOOD FOOD!"
4616634,42271408,2015-08-12,35429426,Alan,"Simple easy stay! The place was awesome! Clean, professional, private. A+!"

4616634,44122352,2015-08-24,35965881,Jeanette,We were lucky to stay at this cozy little private studio apartment for a weekend. It had everything we needed and the location couldn't have been better for us. The area is great for walks. There's a park nearby and a great little bakery. We loved the skylights and the accessibility of the place!!
4616634,44317675,2015-08-25,3416512,Heidi,"It was a cute place that was very clean, private, and comfortable. They had a stereo to hook our phone into for music which was a nice perk and wifi. Cyndy was also very friendly. "
4616634,44506204,2015-08-26,42325087,Sidney,"Listing was completely accurate. Beautiful neighborhood, cozy and comfortable space. Favorite thing was the trick murphy bed / dining room table combo. Small space with the perfect furniture to use the space as one sees fit. Loved it."
4616634,44576477,2015-08-27,7263451,Michelle,"Simply LOVED this place! What an amazing concept. Fantastic neighborhood, never any concerns returning at night or parking on the street. Great host and Cyndy's on top of communication. Would stay here again in a heartbeat, so close to Ballard, and a short drive to Queen Anne, Belltown and Seattle Center. Thanks again for everything and we hope to return sooner than later :D"
4616634,44818225,2015-08-29,17784900,Aaron,"Cyndy was really nice and the apartment was incredible. Made for a great night and gave us lots of ideas for our own place, dream place anyway."
4616634,45251036,2015-09-01,35168402,Whitney,Cyndy's home was beautiful! Very easy to locate and a perfect amount of space.
4616634,45427749,2015-09-02,42157022,Melissa,"The cozy studio was just what we were looking for. The keypad entry system made for a very easy check in and check out. The studio itself was the perfect size to accommodate 2 of us and though we did not use it, there was a a very functional kitchen provided. Our hosts were very willing to provide recommendations for things to do. We will definitely be returning here if the opportunity arises. "
4616634,45594648,2015-09-04,17220660,Katharine,This place was so much better than the pictures. It's perfectly designed. We loved the decor and set up of the studio. I would love to stay again. It felt very safe. 
4616634,45946813,2015-09-07,37078134,Tami,"PROS: My boyfriend and I LOVED this studio!!! It was super cute, had tons of quality upgrades (heated bathroom floor!), was cleverly and efficiently designed, and immaculate! Cyndy, our host, welcomed us by having the Murphy bed out and made, ready to crawl in! (not sure if this was because I advised her our plane was delayed 3 hours or not, but appreciated nonetheless!) Additionally, I was pleasantly surprised to find many extras: soap/shampoo/conditioner in the shower (and quality to boot, in my opinion), tea & instant coffee in the kitchen, quality dishes and silverware (no shortcuts here) and more hangers than most hotels!  The wi-fi was faster than most hotels, too! There were also extra blankets and pillows: I'm a bit of a princess-and-the-pea about my bed, and I needed the flatter bonus pillows. :o) The bedding was comfy and homey, the bath towels sparkling white and soft, and the whole place just felt welcoming. Cyndy had conveniently provided easy-to-use recycling and compost bins, and helpful notes to call out less obvious features (reading light above bed). These things speak volumes about the host's dedication to providing her guests a positive experience!
 
I loved the neighborhood - both because it was quiet, and because I grew up in Ballard. ;o) The only neighbors we encountered were friendly. I was in town for a wedding at the Seattle Aquarium, and it was an easy drive from the studio.

I'd emailed Cyndy with questions prior to our arrival, and she was always quick to reply and helpful. Because of the timing of our arrival, and the fact that we were in town for a wedding so almost never there, we never got to meet our hosts. :o( I wasn't sure it was rude not to make a point to check in - or appreciated: I hope the latter... ;o)

CONS - with caveats: It's no surprise - being in Seattle - that the unit had so many large windows, and the two skylights: I loved and appreciated the natural light! That said, sleeping in (especially after our very late/early arrival) was challenging (seasonal, of course). The Murphy bed - while VERY comfortable and a great way to take advantage of the small footprint - was a double bed (not a queen). The description may have mentioned this, I don't remember, and it certainly wasn't a deal-breaker for us. However, if one or both guests happen to be tall (I'm not) or both above-average builds (I am), it would probably be snug. 

All-in-all, the place was practically perfect! We would definitely stay here again. It feels very much like a home-away-from-home!"
4616634,46117764,2015-09-08,31976686,Josie,"Cyndy's rental is beautifully maintained and our stay was everything we expected. Nice home, nice neighborhood, fun stuff to do only a mile away. Clean and comfortable, a great place to stay in Seattle's Ballard neighborhood."
4616634,46298627,2015-09-09,19450709,Matt,"The space was simply beautiful! All details were covered. We even took pictures of the space of how well it was designed and laid out. Exactly what Airbnb should be. Great communication, beautiful and comfortable space, and all amenities needed to enjoy your stay. This place felt like a luxury resort not just a spare room.  Do not hesitate to book. Thank you!"
4616634,46437618,2015-09-10,2116330,Alexandra,"We had a great time staying with Cyndy! The studio is just as described - cozy and welcoming. And it has great light! We easily walked (about 20 minutes) down to the locks and around Ballard for the evening - lots of lovely shops and fun places to eat. Dealing with Cyndy was super easy - she was responsive and logistics were smooth. If you are looking for a relaxing, quiet place to stay in Seattle, this is a great bet."
4616634,46559448,2015-09-11,43634520,Jonathan,Fantastic studio! Very clean and comfortable. I loved staying here. 
4616634,46661295,2015-09-12,6122289,Ronan,Was a very warm and welcoming studio.  Will definitely be staying here again on my next trip.
4616634,48505796,2015-09-27,29737381,Linda,"My husband and I (both retirees) travelled from Ireland to Seattle to visit our son and his family who live in Ballard.  We arrived late in the evening and Cyndy welcomed us and then left us to get settled in. 

We were delighted with the apartment. It was spotless and fully equipped. The Murphy bed (which I must admit I was a bit dubious about) was wonderful!  It was comfortable and easily turned into a good-size table.

The location of the apartment is ideal. The bus for Ballard and downtown Seattle stops about a 5-minute walk away and Ballard itself is a 10-15 minute walk (a bit longer returning because it's uphill).

All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our holiday, helped in a huge way by knowing that we could come and go as we pleased and could relax in the lovely cozy studio apartment. We would certainly recommend it."
4616634,48902074,2015-09-29,21789806,Jamey,"Cyndy's place is absolutely gorgeous. This was our first trip to Seattle and we couldn't have chosen a better location to call ""home"" temporarily. We could have spent all or our time in Ballard, there were so many cute shops and restaurants around the house (we tried out Pie Bar and Walrus and the Carpenter both were excellent!) Cyndy's apartment was very clean and bright. The skylights above the bed were beautiful. It was also nice already having shampoo and conditioner to use, and the little extras were definitely appreciated. Cyndy also kept in contact, which was nice. We couldn't have asked for anything more."
4616634,49004467,2015-09-30,31260260,Kyeonghui,Cyndy's place is very nice and unique. I really enjoyed staying at her place and she was kind.  Recommend! !!! :)
4616634,49193944,2015-10-01,2916288,I Ride Bikes,"We came and stayed for one night to see a concert. Looked a a lot of options but chose this because of what it offered and the area it is in. 
What we look for in a place is for it to be clean, quiet and bright which this place has in spades. It is like having your own little house with all the necessary accoutrements. 
The owner was very helpful and personable. I would say that she extended courtesies that you would otherwise not expect. 

"
4616634,49290025,2015-10-02,39071409,Cory,"My stay went perfect here. It was very easy to find and I was impressed when entering the apartment.  The apartment was extremely clean, peaceful, modern, and included eveything I needed for the stay.  Cyndy and Tom were great hosts. Cyndy always communicated quickly and was helpful when suggesting places to eat.  Tom even called a friend to help me find a bicycle rental.  The neighborhood was very nice, safe, quiet, and close to downtown Ballard."
4616634,49648906,2015-10-05,43285431,Natasha,"We had a lovely stay here. The air B and B was really cute and just as charming as the pictures showed. The neighborhood was wonderful to stroll around and, within about a 10-15 minute walk, there were restaurants and cafes to enjoy. The bus took us directly downtown and made it easy to get around. We loved it all!"
4616634,50022380,2015-10-08,921369,Rick,"We very much enjoyed our stay at Cyndy's studio in Ballard. It is a convenient, walkable neighborhood. The studio is perfectly designed with efficient and remarkable use of space, and everything was spotless and inviting."
4616634,50500855,2015-10-12,44207265,Ashlee,We fell in love with the Ballard neighborhood instantly. The studio was absolutely perfect.  Just as pictured. We can't wait to come visit again and hopefully be able to stay with Cyndy again.  Thanks again Cyndy for everything.
4616634,51311166,2015-10-19,7572018,Steve,"Great space in a quiet neighborhood, close to all of the wonderful attractions of vibrant Ballard. The apartment is cozy, modern and comfortable and we look forward to staying at Cyndy's place the next time we come to Seattle."
4616634,51516720,2015-10-20,22149104,Amber,"Clean, easy, comfortable, cozy. It was exactly what we needed for a quick overnight in Seattle.  Great spot and super organized owner! And in my favorite Seattle neighborhood.  "
4616634,52047828,2015-10-26,10636987,Nancy,"My husband & I thoroughly enjoyed our 2 night stay in this lovely apartment!  It is located in a very quiet neighborhood with easy parking.  This newly constructed studio is bright and clean with tall, open beam ceilings & lots of windows overlooking the surrounding tree tops.  The bathroom & kitchen are top-notch and the bed is quite comfy.  We appreciated being able to come & go as we pleased and definitely plan to return in the future."
4616634,52865147,2015-11-02,12879602,Douglas,The location was perfect for me and the hostess was very welcoming and helpful. 
4616634,53733163,2015-11-11,479502,Steve,"What a great experience! Thanks Cyndy for making your studio available. With options like this, why would anyone choose a hotel? 

Pros: Excellent location in Ballard and a great value. Safe, quiet, beautiful and not far from shops and dining; quick trip to downtown; comfy bed. The studio feels new and clean and secure, with tasteful decor and high end interior finishes. I loved the retro-modern feel and the great layout - everything you need (two people best) without feeling cramped. 
Cons: No TV, but otherwise perfect!

I also loved the easy check in and out - Cyndy was responsive to my texts (I had a very late check in) the keypad on the door eliminated any key concerns and parking was plentiful and free! 

Thanks Cyndy - I'll be back again.
"
4616634,53758241,2015-11-12,15451351,Kelly,"Staying at Cyndy's couldn't be more perfect. Easy communication and great little apartment in a favorite neighborhood. Very clean and cozy, would have loved to stay longer!"
4616634,53975484,2015-11-15,45307980,Scott,"Great neighborhood, new, cute and incredibly clean studio! Even heated floors in the bathroom. It is the perfect location to explore Ballard and Seattle. "
4616634,54244781,2015-11-17,24211868,Natalie,"Cyndy had everything prepared for my arrival. The studio had all of the conveniences of a hotel in a residential neighborhood. Originally I thought the studio was going to be in an apartment building, but it was actually built above the garage in the back of the house. They did a really nice job with the space and everything is clean and updated. It's small, but it is the right amount of space. As other reviews have mentioned, the bathroom with the heated floors was a nice touch. I would recommend staying here to other guests."
4616634,54810009,2015-11-23,20629942,Erik,"Listing was perfect for our needs. Warm, clean, quaint studio apartment above the garage. It was the perfect little base from which we could explore Ballard and Seattle. Thanks Cyndy!"
4616634,57402639,2015-12-25,10459887,Jill,"safe, nice neighborhood. Easy to find parking, very clean, comfortable bed, extra airbag for my child to sleep on. Instant Starbucks coffee, tea, extra blanket, iron.
Very nice pans, plates."
4616634,57682604,2015-12-28,43956764,Geneva,"This was the perfect location for us this Christmas; a lovely, cozy place to end our days, a sweet little neighborhood within easy walking of cafes and shops and hosts who were present and attentive but not intrusive. For some inexplicable reason the shower rod/curtain fell down in the middle of the night and Cyndy promptly had it replaced the next day. I highly recommend this apartment.  As long as my son stays living in Ballard (and continues to have 4 roommates) I will be back to stay. Thanks Cyndy for creating such a beautiful little retreat."
2905375,13258983,2014-05-23,13692519,Diana,"I had a lovely stay at this apartment.  I was met immediately upon arrival -- even though I was late and given a nice tour of the building.  There was a hot tub, pool, and roof top deck : )  I was able to easily walk to Pike's Place market and other areas in downtown Seattle.  I also enjoyed eating at Vita Bella & Bronzina which were located on the street level of the building.  Another plus, was that parking is included!"
2905375,14129777,2014-06-12,4461053,Allen,Lovely Seattle.  Great place in best part of town. 
2905375,21835853,2014-10-25,10316960,Joli,"The best air bnb experience we've had yet!!! Amazing service and great communication. Like a hotel in some ways, because they really acted as a concierge  but so much better.  The view was spectacular and the bed super comfy.  We will be back for sure!!"
2905375,24148654,2014-12-21,17172384,Sean,"We had a fantastic stay at the unit. It was well appointed, and was in a phenomenal location in Belltown. Amy worked with us on arrival time (traffic on Friday afternoon leaving Portland was heinous) and she got us set up very well with all the info we needed. I wouldn't hesitate to stay in a unit with these guys again."
2905375,26264708,2015-02-08,3263745,Chris,"Other than the shower handle being a little funky to navigate the place was awesome. 

If clean, safe and convenient is what you want along with a bunch of amenities, then there is no where else you need to look. What you see is what you get. A very well designed apartment with plenty of space.

The building itself has plenty of restaraunts right downstairs that are pretty awesome and the garage is easily accessible. 

Walking distance to most local attractions. If walking is not your thing, a $10 uber ride will get you to most places.
"
2905375,27268861,2015-03-01,25476114,Sara,"Darik was great! We got there a little earlier than expected, so I called him and they were able to meet us in 30 minutes to check us into our room. The place was everything I'd hoped it would be and more! It was just like a hotel, but felt much more like home. My boyfriend and I plan on coming again soon in a couple months. (: "
2905375,35273144,2015-06-16,28836814,Matthew,"I'm so glad that we found this gem of an apartment.  It's located in Belltown which is a great neighborhood with many restaurants to choose from.  Pikes place is a few blocks down and very walkable.  This apartment was exactly as shown in pics.  It's beautiful and you can tell that they are no stranger to hosting guests.  The complimentary waters, coffee, plenty of extra toilet paper, and paper towels, the robes; everything was well thought out to make us feel at home.  Everything was labeled so it was easy to find things.  It was great that there was cable for us to watch tv at night.. and they have 1 in each room!  Another plus, AC in the living room!!  I liked that parking was included and that there wasn't an assigned stall as we had a huge rental.  I would definitely recommend anyone staying here. "
2905375,45920227,2015-09-07,7808701,Carroll CC,"Great location. Allowed early baggage storage! Complimentary waters, fully stocked and clean and comfortable. Safe and secure. Only drawback location directly across from Buckleys Bar thus very loud Friday and Saturday nights. Much quieter on Sunday!"
2905375,50453536,2015-10-12,19044525,Jim,"The unit was in a great location, easy walk to everything. The unit was well appointed, had everything you could need, plenty of towels, pillows, blankets and the robes were great.  The welcome basket is a nice touch.  The only down side is the noise from the vents from the buildings across the street, but we brought ear plugs, which helped.  All in all a great unit in a great place.  Upon check in we were met by a member of the management stage who was very informative and helpful."

We could easily walk to many locations.

1833250,10658082,2014-03-02,11178723,Franke,Exactly what was expected. Solid experience. Grateful to have found this place. Maria was very accommodating. Already recommending this place to friends and business associates alike.    
1833250,13150805,2014-05-20,14600052,Erik,"Stayed here for a long weekend with 5 people total. All 5 slept very comfortably. Checking in was easy, everything was done via keypad so never needed to pick up keys or any hassle with that. 

The penthouse is beautiful - amazing views, every single room has a balcony, and every bedroom has a tempurpedic mattress. Haven't slept so well in ages! Really nice to open up the windows in the bedrooms and get an ocean breeze while you're falling asleep. 

Everything was very clean and comfortable. Location is good - near numerous restaurants, bars, and within easy walking distance of downtown and Pikes Place Market.

Would absolutely recommend this place to anyone in Seattle - worth every penny."
1833250,13789538,2014-06-04,14732702,George,"Thanks again I love this rental location was great. Able to walk to all the hot spots Would rent again.

There were plenty of fantastic restaurants, a Target incase you forgot your toothpaste, and a lot of shopping nearby if that's what you're looking for. 

It was a treat to stay in such a great place. "
1833250,24021359,2014-12-17,17966129,Adam,"What an amazing space! You can't go wrong with this Belltown listing. This was my 3rd airbnb in Seattle and was by far our favorite. The location could not be more perfect with restaurants galore and even a small market all on the same block! The views from every window are stunning, especially as the sun sets over the water. Secure parking, keypad entry, even building security at night. Although the neighborhood never once made us feel unsafe, these are great things to have in any downtown city. I would caution parents of small children; this condo is not child safe. That said, I did travel with my very well behaved 3 year old and had no issues. My main concern were the windows as if they are open there isn't much to keep a small child from falling out. I would not change a thing about them, just a warning to parents. Maria was extremely prompt in any communication and a wonderful host. We travel to Seattle very often and have already decided this Belltown condo will be where we will stay from now on."

It was unusually hot while we were in town, and though there was no A/C, there were fans in every room that kept things comfortable. There were 4 balconies that offered spectacular views. We would definitely stay here again!"

Check in could not have been smother with the detailed information Maria sent to me. The photos really don't do this place justice. It is tastefully decorated to a high standard and the view is just amazing. We watched the sun rise on the morning of check out and it was so impressive! Location is perfect if you want to be near downtown - you are within walking distance of the famous pike place market and even the space needle. Both bedrooms have ensuites and Windows from all angles to take in the view. Overall, a very pleasant experience and would stay here again! Thank you Maria."

I was very nervous about the house being sketchy, but what I found was a great view, nice people, and a place I felt at home. Leah whom I corresponded with was a gracious host and organizer. I was pleasantly comfortable in the shared room. I guess my past navy experience helped with that, but clean beds, space, and generally quite was all I needed. The house guest at the time were super nice and they cooked almost every night. The communal living was an interesting set up that I hadn't experienced before. So, I was pleasantly surprised how people coexisted with ease. Leah was very direct about directions and getting into the house, everything else is posted and has many notes on the message board. The house is in a great area easy to bus to everywhere.  "

The other folks I met were friendly, but I didn't actually cross paths with very many people during my 5 day stay, we must have had different schedules. Harmony, a long term guest, showed me around when I got in at 9pm (arranged by Leah) and was very welcoming. I communicated by text with Leah during my stay, and met her on my last day, she was also really nice. The house was very quiet in general, and quiet at night, which was nice. I stayed in a shared bunk room, the curtains on the bunk made me feel like I had some privacy. I was diligent about locking my valuables up but it didn't feel super necessary, they said they've never had any incidences of theft, and the vibe was chill, it seemed like there were only 2 other beds occupied in that room when I was there. The house is pretty but it could have definitely been cleaner, e.g. there were crumbs on the carpet/ couches, a few funky smells about the house, food scraps in the kitchen sink drain, etc. Perhaps I just caught it at a bad moment but it felt like it hadn't had a deep clean in a little while, though I saw notes on the wall with the cleaning schedule. The shared fridge was completely overpacked, I put a small snack or two in there but don't expect there to be space in there, definitely not enough space to keep a few groceries as I had been hoping. They did mention they were planning to get a second fridge. It was easy to catch the bus to downtown from there, just a short walk. I would recommend this airbnb if you need a cheap place to crash and don't mind that it won't be spotless. "
3994634,32645029,2015-05-19,17598424,Felipe,"Although I didn't have the opportunity to meet the host, I had been in contact with Liah (responsible for the house back in time) who gave me all instructions and support I needed.

The other guys in the house were amazing, They offered me food, talking and instructions about the city.

The house is big and next to Seattle Downtown "
3994634,33307018,2015-05-26,25349546,Josha,Quiet neighbourhood close enough to Capitol hill to bike down. Leah was attentive and all of the housemates were welcoming. 
3994634,34875256,2015-06-13,33142202,Joanna,"The house was a little further away than I anticipated, but it was lovely. Leah was in touch constantly throughout my trip and helped with any questions that I had. Her messages were very informative and super helpful! I had a wonderful experience and would definitely stay at the Crayola House again when I'm next in Seattle :)"
3994634,35397909,2015-06-18,33872046,Sarah,They did an amazing job overall making everybody feel welcome and I got frequent check ins from one of the hosts to ensure I had everything I needed. I stayed in the room with a lot of bunk beds but I still felt that I had privacy due to the way they set everything up. The other residents were friendly and helpful too. Also the area in which the hostel is located was really safe so I felt comfortable leaving/ coming back at any time.
3994634,35932975,2015-06-23,30125091,Stephen,The Crayola house was all that I expected and (website hidden) was in the most incredibly nice neighborhood of stately old homes. my ride from the airport was a snap via light rail and the 48 bus.  the rooms were fresh and comfortable despite the dorm like arrangement. the hosts were helpful in checking in and out. it has a really great location in between downtown and the university district. I walked everywhere. don't miss a walk in Volunteer Park just a short walk from the house. 
3994634,36206330,2015-06-26,22900421,Alex,The host was more than helpful and accommodating. I had a warm place to stay at night with plenty of welcoming company with a place to cook and a great Seattle vista. 
3994634,37425777,2015-07-06,34187231,J,"I didn't get a chance to meet Michael as he was traveling, however I met Leah. Leah is great, patiently answered all my questions and super friendly! I was invited to celebrate the 4th beach party and it was fun. Thank you Leah and other mates in the Crayola house for making my stay fun and enjoyable!"
3994634,37693859,2015-07-09,22178824,Lui,"This was my first time to use AirBnB, and they were very kind to teach me through the app. The house in safe neighborhood, it wasn't just crash sleeping place, more like a great hostel! The people who are staying there are also friendly and helpful, as well. I'm so grateful of this experience!"
3994634,39428204,2015-07-23,25326929,Ricardo,"The neighborhood is  nice, very green and peaceful. It has a great view from the house.
The home is close to downtown.   
You can cook if you want and the kitchen has all the utensils you need. 
The guests are  helpful and respectful. 
The hosts communicate with you to check if everything is okay. 
The home is a good hostel place to stay. 
I was there for just 2 nights and it was enough to make friends with a guy from Switzerland who was passing through Seattle on his way back home. "
3994634,39975160,2015-07-27,1577863,Pablo,"Crayola Home is a mix between house and hostel. Although it is not specially clean nor new, It is confortable and has a good environment. It is located in a quiet residential area, but the problem is that there is nothing but other houses in a mile. If you want to buy food, for example, the nearest shop is in 20 minutes walking. In this sense is not ideal, so take it into account if you are coming. 
"
3994634,42569042,2015-08-14,18426130,David,Michael and everyone there was very gracious.  I enjoyed my time there overall.
3994634,43090132,2015-08-17,4180800,Elizabeth,Had a very nice stay here -- Michael and Leah did a good job communicating the expectations for the stay.  Really enjoyed meeting other residents at the house and felt very welcome.  Listing was as described. 
3994634,43703170,2015-08-21,15489284,Yves,"Nice, warm and welcoming host. Everything is as described. It's got more of a hostel feeling though (but you probably guessed that already from the description). The location is perfect. Lots of cool places are right by, so you can walk to Volunteer Park or into the main street of Capitol Hill or Hilltop. To get to Downtown it's just a quick bus ride. All in all I would totally recommend Crayola Home to everyone who is searching for an affordable accommodation in Seattle."
3994634,49924959,2015-10-07,21406092,Natalie,"I had a nice stay at the Crayola house! I was immediately greeted by some of the house mates(Jon/Eric), and shown around the house. The house is huge, and in a nice neighborhood. I stayed in the green room where there are 4 bunk beds, and plenty of room to store and lock up items. There's a 24 hr restroom located in the basement right outside the green room which was nice. I used public transit(43/48 lines) while I was there which was like a 5/10 min walk from the house. There's also a nice park(Washington), and restaurants in walking distance (15 min). I tried Cafe Flora, Essential bakery, and Belle Epicurean, and they were all great! We all had a bonfire with food and drink Sat night, and I was able to meet more of the people staying in the house, so that was nice. Its a great place to crash if visiting/site seeing, and meet other interesting people. I would def stay at the Crayola house if I return to Seattle :) "
3994634,53365667,2015-11-08,15200039,Mark,"This was a good, affordable option for staying in Seattle. Getting used to a big house, with alot of folks, was a bit overwhelming, but everyone I met was nice and willing to help me figure things out. Everything is fairly clean and the detailed house/room rules help everything run smoothly. The room I stayed in had 4 sets of bunk beds, with each bed having a privacy sheet. The beds were really simple but enough to get a decent night's sleep. "
3994634,53758275,2015-11-12,46264352,Timothy,"I'm in love with this listing. This place was such an awesome almost hostel with amazing people staying there already. During my time there, I didn't get to meet Michael or Leah but Leah had so many signs and notices of who they were, it seemed like they were there. The permanent residents were really cool people all of them who were all very friendly. The space itself was also just so great. The house was huge and very well organized (and ridiculously clean!). I spent so much time just relaxing in the office reading in my off time from being a tourist around the city. I'd recommend Crayola Home to anyone."
7697170,42215706,2015-08-11,18326668,Randeen,"The apartment is spacious, clean and seems new! The bedding and towels were nice as well! We loved the location as we walked to safeco field and the market one day and the area has so much to offer. We would definitely go back. "
7697170,44188798,2015-08-24,22072930,Jenny,"The apartment is very well presented, clean and new as per the photos. The location is great! Was an easy walk to a range of cafes and restaurants, and a short drive to downtown. Joe was a great host, and quick to respond. It is on the bottom level so you can hear footsteps from above, but it didn't bother us too much. Parking was pretty easy, had to drive around the block to find a space but was no trouble. Ample towels and bath products were also provided. We had a wonderful stay at Joe's apartment and would definitely stay again!"
7697170,45299686,2015-09-01,12678437,Charles,"This is a wonderful basement apartment in the Capitol Hill district of Seattle.  The unit was clean, comfortable, and accommodating.  Fully furnished yet still spacious.  The apartment feels modern, new, and inviting.  The bathroom is of average size, and was stocked with an abundance of towels.  The beds were just right, a good night's sleep was not a problem.  Probably my most favorite feature was to discover 3 portable floor fans in the closet of one of the bedrooms.  I love falling asleep to the white-noise of a fan as well as the additional coolness they can offer.  We never met the host (Joe) in person, but all arrangements were handled upfront via messaging and email.  Even when a strong wind storm took out power for 24 hours, Joe was immediately available to address any concerns.  The location of this property is in a beautiful residential area, but it is only a 2 block walk from everything on Broadway street; very convenient.  Parking a car at this location can be problematic.  All parking is parallel curb/street parking and it is fairly congested.  In addition, the parking rules for a given street changes from street to street.  I highly recommend utilizing a ride-sharing service instead of a rental car.  We did a bit of both, I was glad to be rid of the rental car and the hassle of finding a permissible parking spot.  On average we were able to have a ride-sharing service arrive in under 10 minutes every time.  Despite the parking, this is a fantastic unit with an awesome host, you can't go wrong with making this your home away from home while staying in Seattle."
7697170,46168652,2015-09-08,39982367,Chrissie,We arrived very early so I needed to wait 3 hours. The phone number for Joe is wrong. We only had one floor for 4 people. Anything is comfortable and soft. The bus stop is near the house. Very easy to go everywhere 
7697170,47173279,2015-09-16,41071045,Max,"Es war Perfekt! Einchecken war dank der Beschreibung super einfach. Es gab einen Parkplan und  Tipps zum einkaufen etc. Die Unterkunft war sauber und aufgeräumt. Es war alles vorhanden: Kaffeemaschine, waschmaschine, toaster und und und. Die ganze Unterkunft ist einfach super! 
Im Ganzen nur zu Empfehlen! Vielen Dank für den Tollen Aufenthalt!"
7697170,47730754,2015-09-21,4838150,Heather,"Great neighborhood, easy check-in and nice layout."
7697170,48212289,2015-09-24,42571647,Winnie,"It was my first time in Seattle and Joe's place was seriously the best place to start my trip out with. I love Capitol Hill  -- the neighborhood was wonderful. We were close enough to the city and yet far enough to enjoy quiet mornings/nights. Everything was so cozy and the place was really clean. And even though we were in the ""basement,"" it really feels just like being on the lowest floor of an apartment building.

Everything provided was top of the line - i.e. kitchen utensils, bath towels, sheets, comforters, etc. I used the sofa bed and it was the BEST thing I've ever slept on my entire trip to the U.S. (14 days and Seattle was my last stop!). We had to check out a little later than I intended due to transportation arrangements; and Joe's staff was kind enough to accommodate our request.

I've decided that when I return to Seattle, I will definitely be staying at Joe's again!"
7697170,48789491,2015-09-28,14996470,Jason,"Place worked out great.  Very convenient location, in a really nice neighbor.  Unit was very clean and well equipped with necessary items (towels, pillows, dishes, etc).   Owners were very responsive - from the first inquiry I made before renting to the place all the through our stay (had internet/cable problems when first arrived, and maintenance person was on site with 15 minutes of me notifying owner).  If you need a nice place, with multiple beds, in a very convenient Seattle location, at a very competitive nightly rate, this would be your place!"
7697170,49795750,2015-10-06,30676486,Joshua,"While Joe is not actually the host, the 3rd party company he has hired was excellent.  When we arrived, the pack and play was not on site, after calling it was delivered in 20 min.  The condo is very nice and exactly as promised. Fully stocked with all amenities needed.  Parking was easy to find and the location was very close to excellent restaurants and bars.  Being on the basement did lend to loud footsteps above a few times.   Overall, very satisfied with rental."
7697170,52180369,2015-10-26,1476522,Sunny,The listing was spot on. My expectations were met and my family really enjoyed the place. It was clean and the location was perfect.
7697170,53535394,2015-11-09,1360787,Alan & Ruth,"Gorgeous unit in a beautiful neighborhood. Immaculately clean and appointed, this was the perfect place to return to after our days out in Seattle. I loved waking up and taking morning walks in Capitol Hill — Volunteer Park, restaurants and fun things to do are so close. 

Highly recommend staying here!"
7697170,54183439,2015-11-16,48278561,Michael,"Seattle is a second home to me. I usually stay with family but because I visited with friends, we decided to get an airbnb. We were blown away from the moment we stepped on the property as it was beautifully furnished and spacious. We kept saying how we would love to call it our home! The location was perfect for us; it took five minutes to get to the local stores and capital hill night life. If we ever decide to do airbnb again in Seattle, no doubt we'd think of this property first. "
7697170,55269706,2015-11-29,23539486,Reven,It was a great housing just like the one described in the listing. The area was quiet. 
7697170,56681133,2015-12-16,49670692,Louis,"Le logement était très correct et bien entretenu. Très propre et très moderne. L'arrivée s'est passée sans encombre et le départ aussi.
Quartier très sympa, calme et bien situé calme. Cuisine tout équipée facile d'utilisation. Nous avons passé un très bon moment ! 

The appartement was very good and well maintained. Very clean and very modern. No problem with the check-in and the check-out.
Very nice area, quiet and peaceful location . Fully equipped kitchen easy to use. We had a great time !"
7697170,56872304,2015-12-19,18393786,Jeff,"The place was nice and clean, the beds were really comfy. It was a short walk to neighborhood stores and restaurants. It was roomy, and in the basement. Parking was a small challenge but not too bad. "
5918259,31960961,2015-05-12,31046097,Jessica,"Dee & her husband made us feel right at home! We stayed here as part of our anniversary trip and we were warmly greeted with a ""Happy Anniversary"" sign! It was so cute! All house rules were simple and reasonable and the house was just as described, if not better in person. We never heard too much noise or anything like that, and we felt we had lots of privacy though it was very nice to know they were there if we needed anything. The house was adorably decorated, nice and open. Spotless! And all amenities were well thought out and made for a comfortable stay. We truly didn't want to leave! The washer & dryer were very helpful and the hot tub was awesome! It was in pristine condition and so peaceful to enjoy with the view of the lake. The garden area all around is also beautiful. Great neighborhood, very quiet all around and each house has its own unique landscaping. I wouldn't change a single thing about our stay here, and i look forward to visiting again :)"
5918259,32296274,2015-05-16,33085509,Susi,"Dee made us feel welcome from the very beginning by writing friendly emails before our arrival. she greeted us personally and showed us the apartment which is beautiful. it is spacious and cozy at the same time - overlooking Lake Washington and pretty shrubs. it also has a fully equipped kitchen which is wonderful when you are staying for several days. we loved the bed and the soft linens. the neighborhood is calm and residential - very green.  there are little cafés and restaurants nearby.  you can walk or run down to the lake in less  than 5 minutes.  there is a sidewalk circling the lake -  Perfect for walking and running. public transport is also nearby. the facts listed in Dee 's profile are all correct,  but in reality it was ten times better! "
5918259,33001238,2015-05-24,16772242,Michelle,The host warmly welcomed us. We found a nice greeting. The place was accurately described. The lake view was fabulous and watching it from the hot tub was spectacular. It was clean and well furnished. 
5918259,33269780,2015-05-26,5041916,Gwyn & Libby,"Dee was great and so is this apartment! All communication with Dee was easy and she even went out of her way to get us an iron (we were in town for a wedding). The house is absolutely stunning and in a great neighborhood in Seattle. Parking was super easy and there are lots of restaurants and things to do within walking distance. The apartment itself is huge and nicely furnished. Plenty of room to do yoga inside or outside on the porch. The washer and dryer came in handy since we'd just arrived after a backpacking trip and the hottub really helped our sore muscles - plus, the view is amazing. We would definitely stay here again. "
5918259,33917059,2015-06-02,18334687,Mariah,Dee and her husband Matt were great hosts! We were only able to cross paths a few times during our stay but our chats with them were always pleasant. They were also very attentive to our needs and made sure we had everything we needed during our stay. The apartment was very enjoyable. We especially liked taking in the view of the lake while relaxing in the jacuzzi after a long day of exploring! We can't wait to stay here again during our next visit to Seattle. 
5918259,34707951,2015-06-11,31407494,Sharon,"Although I had a late arrival to Dee's Airbnb, Dee and Matt met us at the curb, took my luggage to the apartment, and made sure I was settled. 
The apartment was as described, even better.  Spotlessly clean, and equiped with the necessary ammenities.  The bed is very comfortable and the hot tub is a plus, although I only had time to use it once.
The neighborhood was quiet, beautiful,  and near Lake Washington with a perfect view.  
I would definitely recommend this Airbnb to all future guests. "
5918259,35114550,2015-06-15,10660702,Ellen,"We loved everything about staying with Dee and Matt.  They are accommodating, generous, interesting and friendly hosts. We had some scheduling problems and they were very available, responsive and helpful.  The view is amazing and expansive.  The apartment is private, spacious, full of light and air. The hot tub overlooking the lake is a treat.  The backyard  gardens are fabulous.  We felt so relaxed  and well cared for while we were there. Highly recommended.  

We found the neighborhood easy driving to Central District and from I5.  Parking is easily available in front.  We discovered Columbia City nearby and found great eating and shopping there. "
5918259,35465561,2015-06-19,31936473,John,Dee met us as we arrived and showed us around. She even gave us two baskets of local blueberries and strawberries which we enjoyed each morning of our stay. The apartment was beautiful and immaculate. The setting was incredible with a Jacuzzi on the patio outside the apartment. The view of Lake Washington was incredible and we saw many bald eagles!  We also got good advice on using the light rail to get into downtown Seattle and to the ballpark. The neighbor hood is very nice with good local dining spots within a mile.
5918259,35833987,2015-06-22,24879531,Linda,"Dee was a GREAT host!  She provided needed information about the area and activities.  The apartment was in a quiet area with a wonderful view of Lake Washington.  It was clean, well-appointed, and spacious.  We will for sure stay there again if the need arises for lodging in Seattle.
"
5918259,36405004,2015-06-28,33651604,Lori,Dee was incredibly friendly and helpful.  She was very warm and welcoming and quickly responded to any questions. The neighborhood was beautiful with a running trail close by and Seward Park was great. 
5918259,37168954,2015-07-05,33587375,Candy,This listing was represented accurately. The host came down to see if we needed anything and introduce himself. Lovely neighborhood. We were able to watch the fireworks from the park next door. 
5918259,37800844,2015-07-10,37172583,Jeanne,"Although Dee was traveling and we did not get to meet her she made us feel very welcome and right at home. Fresh cut flowers out of her beautiful yard were bountiful and a welcome sign made us smile. We are going back next week and can't wait to meet in person. Her neighbors and house/dog sitter felt like family and the place was oh so clean and comfy:)
"
5918259,38114699,2015-07-13,31627312,Katie,A warm welcome with a happy birthday banner was the perfect way to start our weekend away! We have a lovely time staying at Dee's house. It was clean and quiet with a lovely view of the lake. She had great recommendations for local eats and things to do! We will be back.
5918259,40210105,2015-07-29,32989980,Alexandra,"I couldn't have been more pleased with my experience! The pictures do not do it justice, the view was breathtaking! Dee was so helpful and even had information ready for us in the place when we arrived! She was also available if I had any questions throughout the visit. Location was perfect, so close to everything!  I would definitely stay here again! "
5918259,40962738,2015-08-03,37172583,Jeanne,"We were fortunate to be there for Seafair and it was amazing,"
5918259,42120904,2015-08-11,18743005,Katie,"I had a great welcome from Dee!  It is amazing how a welcome sign and some flowers can really complete your day, when you've been on the road for 9 hours!  The place was much larger than I expected and it was so nice.  The view of the lake was very pleasant.  It wasn't far from downtown and very easy to get to.  They were very welcoming and I would definitely return for another visit."
5918259,43239203,2015-08-18,15643117,Patrick,"The pictures can't begin to describe the views! Coming back after a long day of exploring Seattle or being out on a hike the place was perfect. The location is close to a number of bus lines that take you right downtown. But you might want to get a car or be prepared to uber/left sometimes. Dee was great with accommodating our schedule of arriving earlier and staying later than the normal check in/out times. Huge bathroom and great open floor plan. 

The area around the house is great too. There are a bunch of parks close and Both Ways Cafe and Flying Squirrel Pizza are delicious!!! 

Would definitely book again. 

Two things of note that might push you toward or away from this listing are: 

1) there is no TV - but frankly you have the spectacular views of the lake and wifi so you don't need much else. 

2) the bed is a soft bed - my BF loved it...took me a bit longer to get used too. "
5918259,44528307,2015-08-27,35225949,Mona,"Absolutely wonderful place with a gorgeous view. The setting is quiet,  peaceful and  within walking distance to Lake Washington.
The apartment was clean and spacious with a comfortable bed.
We had a lovely stay.
Dee and Matt were very friendly and accomodating hosts.
I highly recommende staying here"
5918259,45466680,2015-09-03,18608079,Scott,"As described on the site and other reviews, Dee's apartment overlooking Lake Washington is peaceful, lovely, spacious and welcoming. Although Dee was out of town (so we unfortunately weren't able to meet her) she left a friend in charge, who answered all of our questions promptly via texting. The neighborhood is quiet and folks out walking were friendly. It's an easy walk to Columbia City's cluster of restaurants/bars on Rainier, and also an easy 20 minute hike to the Columbia City light rail station for a quick, car-less zip to other parts of Seattle. The recommendation for Flying Squirrel Pizza was appreciated on our first night, also a short walk. We ate all of our breakfasts in, as well as one dinner, and the living room worked well for hanging out a little with our son and his girlfriend, who live over in Beacon Hill. The kitchen is well laid-out and all the basic implements and housewares are supplied. Nice to have sharp knives! And knowing we had laundry available allowed us to pack relatively lightly. We kept fairly busy but if we'd allowed ourselves more down time, the deck would've been perfect for a leisurely reading spot on a sunny morning or afternoon. A parking spot on the street was always closely (usually right in front of the house) and seemed quite safe. We hope to return! "
5918259,45933920,2015-09-07,10590319,Kendra,"Dee's home is absolutely beautiful! The view is more breathtaking than the pictures can capture. The apartment was clean and relaxing. The break from the TV was great, as well. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a chance to get away from the crowds and take in a wonderful view."
5918259,46615748,2015-09-12,41165050,Joseph,"This property was, as advertised,  absolutely amazing. Dee and Matt could not have been more accommodating.  The place is in a wonderful location, close to anything you would want to do, although you will probably end up just sitting out on the deck and enjoying the view! I would stay here again in a heartbeat and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to get away and relax."
5918259,47360403,2015-09-18,3381323,Melissa,"My hubby and I had a wonderful time at Dee's apartment. It was perfect for us. We enjoyed having our own space while visiting Seattle. We didn't need a car. We walked to stores and restaurants. We took the bus downtown to see all the tourist sites. 

The bed was absolutely amazing. So comfortable. Dee was there if we needed her and never intrusive. The place was clean and very well kept.

My hubby had to get used to no microwave for the week. He was just fine with no TV, go figure.

The apartment has amazing views from every window. We were very impressed. I would definitely book here if I come back to Seattle."
5918259,48388179,2015-09-26,10996199,Irene & Gregory,"Stunning apartment and beautiful lake view. Dee is an amazing hostess and the sense of welcome is perfect. Fresh flowers, a welcome sign, immaculate apartment and an amazingly comfy bed. Did we mention the view? Good access to transit if you plan to take the bus and light rail around. Driving around Seattle seems foolhardy."
5918259,48911482,2015-09-29,42929209,Ad,"Warm welkom, gastvrij, makkelijk toegankelijk en bereikbaar. Dee stond direct klaar met adviezen voor het bezoek van Seattle downtown. 
Heerlijk terras met hot tub met geweldig uitzicht. "
5918259,49771108,2015-10-06,21289491,Amanda,The photos and reviews for this apartment were very accurate. The view is amazing and the apartment is cute and clean. We enjoyed using the hot tub multiple times which was nice after a long day of sightseeing. Dee greeted us when we arrived and gave us a brief tour of the apartment along with some tips and restaurant suggestions. We didn't see our hosts after that but she was very available by message in case we needed anything. You can hear footsteps upstairs but that was no big deal. The place is very peaceful and quiet. You can walk down the street and take a flight of stairs to get down to a water front trail for a nice scenic walk. I would stay here again if we are making another trip to Seattle!
5918259,50457594,2015-10-12,39882719,珞,"It is a great experience when we stayed here. The hosts are nice and enthusiastic. The house is clean , near the lake and have a good view . Also the house is very big, you can posess your own restroom,bedroom ， kitchen , living room and entrance. We like it very much."
5918259,52858815,2015-11-02,39657258,Suzanne,"We enjoyed our stay in Seattle. Dee and Matt's place was as represented in the photos....clean and comfortable. As others mentioned...the bed is very comfy. unfortunately we hit some rainy days,  but the view and patio to enjoy it would have been wonderful otherwise. Our hosts were very pleasant to interact with...thx Dee and Matt!"
5918259,53359640,2015-11-08,46115187,Cody,We had a great time. The house is exactly as shown. Very cozy and had everything we needed. The hot tub was perfect with the cold weather. Would definitely stay here again!
5918259,53877453,2015-11-14,1726407,Heather,"Great, spacious apartment with truly stunning views. Our trip was a bit rainy but still Lake Washington was so lovely. It's easy to walk to the lake or even Columbia City to hang out there. Very much recommend staying with Dee! "
5918259,55182906,2015-11-29,5041916,Gwyn & Libby,This was a repeat stay for us and we were again so happy that we chose this place to rest our heads. The weather in Seattle happened to be gorgeous so we could take full advantage of the fantastic views from the hottub and took several lovely runs around the neighborhood. Everything about this place is warm and cozy and feels like home. We'll definitely continue to use it as our home away from home whenever we're in Seattle! 
5918259,56367330,2015-12-13,11996320,Karen,"We just spent 9 days in this wonderful location. Dee is a perfect host...communication was easy, our flight was delayed several hours so we came in very late (early morning actually) and were able to make a plan.   Directions to the house were clear.  There was a welcoming note and fresh flowers. The apartment is spacious and comfortable...furnished in a very attractive simple style. A comfy bed,  down comforter and nice linens, lots of hot water, an outside Jacuzzi and a responsive thermostat in each room made our winter visit very cozy.  
The Columbia City/Seward Park neighborhood has great restaurants and access to all kinds of food shopping..and a light rail station within about a mile. There is easy access directly from the house to Lake Washington trails...really a nice base for a Seattle visit!"
5183164,26347358,2015-02-09,24714886,Leinad,"Roseanne was a wonderful host, and the room was amazing. Check in time was flexible to fit our schedule, and the atmosphere of the house was perfect. I plan to stay here whenever I visit the city."
5183164,26947027,2015-02-22,374500,Melissa,"Zan's home was not only perfect for my stay, but she herself was a warm, friendly and excellent host who made me feel welcome immediately and like I'd found a new friend. Her home is in on a nice, quiet street that has quick access to nearby restaurants, the BG trail and a neighborhood park. The coolest part about her home is the peaceful backyard deck and her amazing and HUGE supply of hot tea =) I have nothing but positive comments about her place and Zan as a host. I highly recommend staying with her to any fellow traveler. "
5183164,27153530,2015-02-26,6926356,Matthew,I had a great stay at Roseanne's house. Very accommodating of my late arrival and everything I could need available to me. A warm and welcoming home! Very comfy bed too!
5183164,28150391,2015-03-18,29244410,K,"You absolutely must book a stay here on your next visit.  Roseanne is a wonderful host!  Her home is very comfortable, and the bed is amazing.  You'll be blown away by the garden she's crafting in the back yard.

The house is in a great location in a quiet neighborhood, and it's pretty easy to find.  My GPS guided me straight there, and parking was easy on all three days of my stay.

Her artwork is beautiful, her tea selection is excellent, and she made some very delicious muffins.   Absolutely A+ and five stars as an airBnB host.  

I will definitely stay here again."
5183164,28450989,2015-03-23,16345,Jocelyne," There was not a great deal on interaction with the host, not sure if it is because of my age.  The listing stated:  ''The metro bus stop is only one block away for a quick ride to downtown or anywhere else Metro goes.''.  The quick ride is actually 45 minutes and the bus is not frequent so make sure you plan your day accordingly. The room itself was fine, comfortable bed, nice quiet neighbourhood.  Great selection of tea, much appreciated. Ideal for someone with a car."
5183164,28721168,2015-03-29,24714886,Leinad,"My wife and I came into the city again for ECCC and decided to stay with Roseanne again based on or last experiance with her. She is a wonderful host, and she shares our love of sci-fi and fantasy. Everything is so easy when we stay with her."
5183164,34103741,2015-06-04,3029106,Victoria,It was a great place in a lovely wooded setting with easy access to a bus line.
5183164,36192404,2015-06-26,32607118,Sviatlana,"Мы провели замечательно время у Roseanna. Она очень гостепримная хозяйка. У нас всегда были чистые полотенца и возможность пользоваться кухней и стиральной машиной. На веранде всегда пили чай. Была возможность провести время в саду.  Нас никто не беспокоил. Дом находится в тихом и зеленом районе. Есть место для парковки. Рядом очень красивое озеро. В тоже время близко к главной магистрали, которая ведет в центр Сиэтла и к дороге, на которой ездят автобусы до города. Спасибо большое.  Мы бы порекомендовали останавливаться в этом доме и другим путешественникам. "
5183164,36517978,2015-06-29,4009444,Paul,Great host.  Really enjoyed the cozy back porch overlooking the garden. 
5183164,38161454,2015-07-13,33273673,Kira,"We absolutely loved staying with Roseanne!  She has a lovely home, complete with a well-tended garden and many of her own fanciful paintings and sculptures. She gave us helpful tips about what to do around the city and us an all-around wonderful person."
5183164,40612343,2015-08-01,36247491,Jennifer,"I had a very pleasant stay. Roseanne's house was beautiful and the room was very clean with all the necessary items. I especially liked the bed and the pillows. Roseanne also provided me ice cream, tea, clean towels, and shampoo which I was very grateful for. She was also a great and pleasant host, giving me the right level of interaction with enough privacy (I`m a pretty private person) and seemed to be very accommodating according to my needs. I also enjoyed playing with her adorable cat time to time when she was in the house. Overall, this was my first airbnb stay but I am very satisfied with my experience!!"
5183164,41799514,2015-08-09,37369578,康,Roseanne's house is sooooooo adorable. And Roseanne is very friendly.
5183164,42000836,2015-08-10,38297075,Natalie,"Roseanne was so accommodating! My friend and I were attending a concert in the city and arrived at the house pretty late. Roseanne had everything set up for us-our room was nice and simple, and our bed was so comfortable. The house was very welcoming. There was art on the walls and it was a very inviting space. She had left all the information about the house that we would need. Our stay was brief as we left in the morning, but she offered us coffee and we were on our way. We ended up going to a coffee shop down the road she recommended, and it was great as well. This was only my second time using Air BnB but Roseanne was a lovely host, and though we didn't get to talk much, I would certainly stay in her home again! Thanks Roseanne for opening up your home! "
5183164,42499962,2015-08-13,353933,Agnes,"Very nice and accommodating host, and her house is beautiful and peaceful, in a quiet neighborhood. I totally recommend it."
5183164,42801716,2015-08-15,32150816,Brahmjot,"Roseanne's house is so warm and nice! Although, I didn't get a chance to stay long at her place, but would definitely want to return as it is in a very nice neighborhood (quite and safe) and has an awesome garden. 

Roseanne was super welcoming, and loved her cat :). The room was exactly as in the photos and the bed was one of the most comfortable ones I ever slept on. "
5183164,43132510,2015-08-17,39773655,Doug,"We had a great time: Comfortable room in a lovely home with a gracious and wonderful host! This was our first Air B&B experience, we'll definitely use the service again."
5183164,43586716,2015-08-20,2600951,Jennifer,I had a very nice experience staying with Roseanne. The check-in process was smooth and the room itself was very cozy. I stayed here for a few days while transitioning to Seattle for a new job. Roseanne is very friendly and I enjoyed the time spent with her during my stay. I highly recommend Roseanne's place for a cozy room to stay in!
5183164,45297883,2015-09-01,19553433,Margarita,"Roseanne is very deep and interesting person! She always helps me whenever I ask. The room is the same as in the picture. The bus stops are near and easy to get to the downtown , Northgate, U-district . 
I would recommend to stay her place. 
"
5183164,45956300,2015-09-07,20132165,Mary,"We has a nice, peaceful stay at Roseanne's house."
5183164,46964569,2015-09-14,13958538,Bill,This was another terrific stay in Roseanne's home.  The room was clean and comfortable as was the entire house.  Plenty of space was offered for food storage and the complimentary tea selection abundant.  It was quiet and as relaxing as I hoped.
5183164,47336400,2015-09-17,5493121,Kim,"I did not stay here myself, but booked it for my mom. I was so glad Roseanne was able to accommodate her on such short notice. My mom said Roseanne was very warm and kind and had a peaceful and well rested stay."
5183164,47797795,2015-09-21,120644,Amanda,"I very much enjoyed my experience at the ""Artist's Abode"". Roseanne is an accommodating and gracious yet discreet host. She was communicative throughout the process and very helpful with any questions I had. The house is lovely: well situated in a safe residential area, a few minutes away from shops and an easy 20 mins drive to bustling downtown. It boasts a lovely patio overlooking a garden, lightning fast wifi and a cozy room with a comfortable bed. Overall, a great offering for the price. I look forward to staying there again should I return to Seattle :)"
5183164,48890323,2015-09-29,6601377,Robert,Very accurate and convenient experience.  Roseanne greeted us at the door and very cordial.  Very interesting home and wish we could have spent more time there and getting to know her.  Our trip purpose kept us busy with family from early morning to late evening every day so we never really had opportunity to get to know her.  We did leave her a thank you note.
5183164,49290412,2015-10-02,21153314,Eli,Perfect for some quiet time in Seattle. Friendly discreet hosts and a very friendly cat!
5183164,49578723,2015-10-04,10338504,Julie,Roseanne was awesome! She was excellent at communicating and made me feel welcome! I slept great as the bed was very comfortable. I also appreciate that she uses organic products in her house. I would definitely stay again!
5183164,51354743,2015-10-19,44786729,Irie,"We had a lovely time with Roseanne! Her house is warm and fun and has all sorts of beautiful art! The back porch has the best view! It was calm and serene, and they never complained about my morning noise or terrible singing! And the tea selection  is out of this world!! Thanks again for hosting us!! Five stars!! "
5183164,52370102,2015-10-28,4526217,Karen,"Roseanne was more than hospitable! We loved her home and her sweet spirit (and of course, her adorable cat!) "
5183164,52546084,2015-10-30,7433793,Peggi,"We weren't here much, because of spending time with family, but everything was great. The bed was very comfortable. Nice amenities in the bathroom (shampoo, conditioner, etc.) Very clean. Roseanne was very personable and open to our crazy changing times of checking in. Also enjoyed the company of her cat, who was very friendly and sweet. :)"
5183164,54480947,2015-11-20,14586775,Jordan,Roseanne made us feel right at home. She provided a clean and quite sanctuary where we could relax and recharge. The bed was extra comfortable and parking was perfect. I'd definitely stay here again. 
5183164,55406696,2015-12-01,46950683,Josh,Roseannes how was amazing!  Apart from being a very kind and welcoming host the her place was very clean and welcoming.  The room I stayed in was nice and the bed was comfy.  Everything was perfect and I highly recommend her place to anyone looking to to stay around the seattle area.
5183164,55999091,2015-12-07,9090029,Marilyn,"Roseanne was a wonderful communicator, making me feel very welcome in her home. The home is in a lovely setting in north Seattle. The room was very comfortable and right next to the bathroom. I would definitely recommend Roseanne's place!"
5183164,56448485,2015-12-13,42116693,若海,Clean quite room .Nice host.I can't ask no more than that. I love Seattle I love this nice room
5183164,57435049,2015-12-26,47066533,Virgil,"This room is good! Quiet, comfortable. Ms Roseanne is also very gentle. You will not be bothered at all. No matter you like or dislike peaceful pace, this is a great place for you. "
5183164,58079175,2015-12-31,9934388,Ivy,"Love this place! Quiet, safe and it's just all you need!"
6248083,38558742,2015-07-16,27542682,Mike,This is a fantastic property in a great location.  I wish I wasn't travelling for work so that I could have spent more time in the house! I really enjoyed exploring the restaurants in the Queen Anne neighborhood.
6248083,39821955,2015-07-26,34945378,Nimish,"The property is high-end in every way and located at perhaps the premier address in Queen Anne and possibly all of Seattle.  You'd be hard-pressed to find a vacation rental with the level of downtown views, amenities, finishes, build-quality, parking, and service offered by this home across the street from Kerry Park.  My guests enjoyed their stay at Ken's property tremendously, and it was extremely convenient to all activities we had planned throughout the city.  There really wasn't anything more we could have asked for, and I couldn't recommend a better place in Seattle for your stay.  "
6248083,40975763,2015-08-03,38184059,Kim,"The Condo was as described, great view and walking distance to  charming Queen Anne  (Try the Five Spot for breakfast  and also excellent sushi at Sushi Samurai). It is also just a few miles from downtown, with public transportation access on Queen Anne Blvd. Since we had a car, and parking is at a premium in Seattle, we really appreciated the garage/courtyard parking. We were only the second tenants, and  felt the condo was missing a few kitchen essentials for a week's stay. Ken's assistant Molly was very helpful in quickly providing what we needed, and stayed in touch with us during our visit. We really enjoyed our stay!"
6248083,41501224,2015-08-07,19345740,Max,Host was great - Molly met us on arrival and everything was wonderful. The listing is very accurate. Sells itself short if anything. 
6248083,41789240,2015-08-09,35659446,Teri,"This place is absolutely fantastic. We loved the neighborhood which seems quieter than most of the others surrounding downtown Seattle. The view was out of this world. Exactly like the picture.  The condo is beautiful, the view is fantastic, and the neighborhood is lovely. "
6248083,43099875,2015-08-17,38939166,Matt,Absolutely stunning!  This place was amazing.  Better in person than what the pictures show. Great views and extremely clean.  Location was perfect and people watching at the park across the street is hard to beat. I will stay here again when returning to Seattle. Ken and Molly were great!  Easy to get a hold of and very accommodating.  
6248083,44952116,2015-08-30,1570677,Sam,This place was awesome.  Great location with the best view of Seattle.  I would for sure stay here again and recommend it to others.  It is exactly as it looks and more. 
6248083,47874943,2015-09-21,43318895,Ziad,"We had a great time at Ken's place! Apartment was clean, modern, and large. The views are spectacular. The pictures don't do it justice. Ken was a fantastic host. Would definitely stay here again."
6248083,48806079,2015-09-28,44459858,Leah,The home was beautiful and exactly as described. The view was amazing. The neighborhood was nice - great restaurants close by. The only draw back to this home is the park right across the street. People are in the park 24 hours a day and are noisy. The noisy people problem is solved by closing the windows. Really only a problem if you want to have your windows open.
6248083,49543453,2015-10-04,5724231,Foosker,"Magnifico!  Ken's place is so absolutely perfect. Walk to coffee and breakfast.  Lounge on the deck to the PNW sunshine and blue skies.  Chill in a cozy living space.  Beautiful modern home, missing nothing."
6248083,51022740,2015-10-17,41678931,Richard,"What a wonderful place! Everything was as advertised. The views were incredible-especially from the rooftop desk. Queen Anne has lots or restaurants, shops, and sites that are easily walkable from here.  The beds were very comfortable and bedding was layered for the chillier nights. Ken has lots of little extras that made this a great week. Sitting at the breakfast bar watching the day unfold - no matter the weather -was a treat.  Absolutely the best place to stay in Seattle! "
6248083,51768543,2015-10-24,20238948,Tyler,"This is such a beautiful house with an awesome view! Molly was there before the check-in time (3pm) waiting for us. We arrived at 3pm, met Ken, the owner, and Richard, the property manager. 
House was very clean, plenty of towels, and we were so lucky to see Mt. Rainier on a Tuesday sunny afternoon. 
This is the best location in Seattle, I would recommend this house to everyone. "
5931372,30169706,2015-04-18,14414374,Helga Marín,"This is a great house and for a great deal. Tahoma hosted my family, visiting me from Iceland. They had a nice experience and enjoyed their stay very much. Tahoma responded quickly to my very late request and everything was nice and clean when they arrived. Thanks Tahoma, I will definitely recommend this North Seattle Home for guests."
5931372,31023241,2015-04-30,1626920,Sophie Jane,"We loved our stay in the Townhouse. It was clean, cosy and welcoming. Thanks for everything."
5931372,33632964,2015-05-30,7947530,Pinky,交通方便，離市區近
5931372,35297657,2015-06-17,30776362,Meng,"Really good price for 5-day stay in Seattle. Nice townhouse with garage. As long as you have a car, it is pretty convenient."
5931372,36277274,2015-06-27,28194100,Ting,房间干净而整洁，三层公寓带私人车库。我们一行2对夫妻。住2间卧室，真好。厨房东西非常齐全，主路对面有华人超市。自己可以烧着吃。谢谢房东
5931372,37063108,2015-07-04,28197251,Susannah,"Wonderful clean home, close to great coffee shops, restaurants. Would definitely recommend and rent again!"
5931372,37318513,2015-07-06,32858420,Mi,It is nice and lovely house. The host kindly provide everything we need. We had a good time there. Thank you very much
5931372,37709434,2015-07-09,7313077,Missy,"Nice house -  modern, comfortable and, on the whole, clean. A pleasant place to stay. 

BUT the downside: if you aren't familiar with Seattle, then do be aware. This house is barely a block from Aurora, which is essentially Seattle's red light district. Streetwalkers tout for business just a few meters away from the house. It is located just behind a sex shop too! There is also a lot of noise at night both from Aurora and people hanging around on the dirt track outside the house. Because of the type of activity going on in the neighborhood, police presence is pretty high. There was a cop stationed outside the house when we were there keeping an eye on prostitutes and drug dealers. 

None of this bothered us as we know the area well and if you are sensible, you won't run into trouble. But some people may well have issues with all this.    "
5931372,39741347,2015-07-26,25705132,Pamela,"This is a great little home!  My husband and I took 4 teens and had ample space with everything we needed. The owner provided a queen air mattress which was VERY helpful with the teen boys who wanted to sleep separately. :-) Be aware that the bathroom is shared with doors to the 2 bedrooms upstairs. Anyone wanting to get in to the shower would be walking through one of the bedrooms.

 I got the pleasure of meeting the owner and she is so helpful to answer any questions I had. She was thoughtful to bring me grocery bags as Seattle is plastic free and she knew we would need to do grocery shopping Thanks for that!  The area of town is older, but we didn't feel unsafe. It is noisy with traffic, which was noticeable because we slept with windows open...but the description tells you that. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks! "
5931372,40894199,2015-08-03,11786315,Ava,"The Good: My mother, husband, and 2-yr old, stayed at this house at the end of July 2015. It's located right off Aurora avenue and close to i-5, which made it very convenient to get downtown to Capitol Hill, downtown, lake Washington, and very easy to go any place west of the highways such as Fremont, Ballard, etc. The house has kitchen tools and dishes perfect for cooking easy meals. Even the knives were good. I loved that there was an electric kettle. We didn't use them but there was a coffee maker, French press, and rice maker too. The beds, sheets, and blankets were very comfortable. Lots of towels too. The sheets, bedrooms, and bathrooms were clean (other than the bathroom drain, see below). One reviewer said that aurora is the ""red light district"" this is not accurate. We were totally safe and although there were some people drinking during the day and one woman who seemed high this felt very normal for a city. Aurora had some great things on it like the drive-in burger place, a yoga studio, and the pcc natural market a five minute drive away. The Sex toy shop is no longer there.

The not-so-good: we arrived to a dirty house. Not unbearable but not up to par with what you'd expect for the price. There wasa layer of grease over the oven and microwave. The toaster and refrigerator had crumbs and food grime in them. The floor and stairs had dirt and dust in them. There were small cobwebs on the lights in the bathroom and the bathroom drain was clogged with a ton of hair. I actually pulled it out myself because I was so disgusted. We had Mary Ann come back the next day to clean the floors and kitchen again. She cleaned the second floor, toaster, and fridge but the microwave and oven were still greasy and the stairs still had dirt on them. It seemed like the house hadn't had a thorough cleaning in a long time. We would've been happy to pay a higher cleaning fee for a hotel quality clean.  We are from NYC so were used to street noise but definitely being off aurora was noisy and it was too hot to sleep with windows closed. There is no AC so you put the fan on at night and it cools down a lot. It also was a particularly hot summer for Seattle. 

Overall we had a great stay at this location and would return of we knew it would be cleaner next time. "
5931372,43617525,2015-08-21,34212638,Mark,"House was just as it is listed! True, it is somewhat close to a noisy road and some non-family businesses, it is also close to a public transit stop - and we never felt unsafe. The house was clean and just the right size for our larger family. You can even see portions of downtown Seattle and Mt. Rainier from the upper floor!"
5931372,44746241,2015-08-28,42071786,Madeline,The host canceled this reservation 23 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

The place was exactly as advertised, clean, and came with everything I could have wanted or needed. All around a great stay! Five stars, two thumbs up, and one big smile! "
6807981,37394080,2015-07-06,23951179,Howard,"This is the second time we have stayed at one of Eve's homes and her great service and unique, well appointed units are something you can count on..  This is a terrific property- location is great and the amenities are very comfortable..You will love this. We did!"
6807981,37814545,2015-07-10,37507868,Jackie,"My stay at this location was excellent.  The location downtown Seattle was extremely convenient - an easy walk to most places I wanted to go.  The apartment was clean, spacious, stylish, and quiet.  Having access to the rooftop patio with a view of the Sound was a definite plus.  Eve was a fantastic host - she was accommodating and quick to answer any questions that I had."
6807981,38634752,2015-07-17,689363,Eric,"The apartment on Marketside Flats is a top one. It has a great location -- just in front of Four Seasons hotel and the Great Wheel. The rooftop view is amazing. Plenty of places are within walking distance, from the Waterfront, the Pike Place, the First Starbucks, and the Benaroya Hall. The grocery store and Rail station are a couple of blocks away.

The unit has a great set of facility too: Washing and drying machine, full kitchen set, Wi-Fi, and HBO Go.

I also appreciate the hospitality. Eve is very easy to reach, quick to respond, and even offers her address if you want to receive any packages.

Overall, I'd rent the place again in a heartbeat -- next time I'd visit Seattle. "
6807981,39221713,2015-07-21,37348529,Teresa,"This was our first experience with Arbnb. As seasoned travelers, it was quite a leap, to get my husband on board with the concept. After reading reviews from Eve's previous guests, I thought this location would be a perfect ""first"" for my husband. 
Eve was ALWAYS quick to respond. Eve was flexible with our arrival time and although she could not meet us, Jesslyn was there to show us in and show us around.
The condo, although, not exactly as presented on the website, was cute, clean, and comfortable, and in an EXCELLENT location. When I mentioned to Eve, my disappointment in the condominium not exactly as presented on the website, she explained a wait list for photos and offered us a small reimbursement, because she wanted us to have a stellar experience. I will definitely seek out Arbnb again. And I would highly recommend Eve. Teresa"
6807981,39783559,2015-07-26,12659001,Brittany,"Eve was a wonderful host! The apartment was in prime location, very clean, and worked perfectly for 2 people! She was on hand for any need! Thank you so much for this wonderful experience!"
6807981,40949339,2015-08-03,662807,Michaele,"Could not be in a better location. Seriously. Within walking distance to so much: Pike Place mkt, Tons of food and shopping, the ferry, a Target-- everything you need. The accommodations were perfect: clean, modern, safe. Eve was great and just a text away, if needed. Instructions for everything were very clear and easy. Very professional. Would definitely stay here again. If this is your first time to Seattle, you need to stay here so you can have an authentic Seattle experience. If this is not, then you already know how great this location is and the price is spot-on. Thanks, Eve, for everything. We'll be back!"
6807981,41618584,2015-08-08,29235667,Blake,Very welcoming and responsive hosts.  I enjoyed the stay.  Place is just as it looks in the pics and was in a very convenient location.  I would definitely stay here again next time I am in the area.
6807981,43778716,2015-08-22,3930606,Matthew,"Fantastic apartment in a wonderful location. Morgan was super helpful and made the stay really easy and enjoyable. The apartment is right in Pikes Place and walking distance to lots of restaurants, shops and attractions. The listing looks just like the photos if not a bit nicer!"
6807981,44145018,2015-08-24,37623209,Katya,"The flat was right next to Pike's Place - perfect location! We walked everywhere - even to the Space Needle (although it was a healthy walk). The place was clean, spacious, and had a great roof top to hang out on. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. My only complaint is for the city itself  - parking is tough and expensive!"
6807981,45264624,2015-09-01,2269016,Michael,"Morgan met me at the unit despite the fact that I had trouble getting my Uber driver to the right spot.  She was personable and showed me around the unit and the complex.  The unit was clean and looked exactly like the online photos, so no surprises.  Half way through my stay I got a friendly note from Morgan along with a bottle of wine.  Nice touch!  And, because it had been warmer than usual in Seattle, Morgan had supplied 3 new fans (the boxes were in the closet) to cool the unit."
6807981,46217651,2015-09-08,28944777,Thomas,"This place was amazing! While the listing said a 5pm check-in, they were flexible and let us check in very early due to an earlier flight. The place was incredible with a comfortable shower and bedding. Right across from the Four Seasons and steps away from Pike Place Market. The place looks exactly like the pictures. I would highly recommend this apartment to anyone looking to explore Seattle."
6807981,46800162,2015-09-13,39626430,Kyle,The apartment was very nice. The staff that got me into the room was very nice as well. This room does not have air-conditioning which was a surprise. I am from the southeast where we all have air-conditioning.  I recommend this place highly!
6807981,47885991,2015-09-21,13133328,Stephan,"Morgan was super nice & helpful. The apartment is right in Pikes Place and in walking distance to lots of restaurants, shops and attractions - Fantastic perfect.  I had a great time and would always come back!
Thank you so much!!!

6807981,48802427,2015-09-28,41554796,Kevin,Great apartment in the heart of downtown.  Minutes walk from everywhere.
6807981,49847734,2015-10-06,25468727,Susan,"Get location, apartment just how it was listed. Daniela did everything possible to make our stay a good experience, checking in with us to make sure all was OK to leaving a bottle of wine when we arrived."
6807981,50330375,2015-10-11,12754716,Mike,We had an outstanding time at the apartment! The location was perfect next to Pike Market and the actual apartment was just like the photos - very clean and comfortable. The view from the rooftop was excellent. I would definitely recommend this place over any other when visiting Seattle!
6807981,53904634,2015-11-14,45110179,Kim,Very welcoming and clean place! Just as described. Awesome neighborhood! So close to everything. Jocelyn and Michael were very accommodating.  Parking and finding the place was a little tricky but that's Seattle? (I'm from Texas so not used to hunt and pay for parking :p we had a car bc we were driving to Vancouver). Would definitely recommend this place (don't drive just walk everywhere) 
8815638,55502095,2015-12-01,24619959,Aadli,"Jocelyn was an amazing hostess.  The location was perfect, the apartment was cozy, and the view was out of this world!"
1307898,6008382,2013-07-26,7187550,Jenn,"We stayed in this beautiful Capital Hill home for one week in mid-July.  The home itself is located in a quaint, quiet neighborhood with easy access to downtown and other local fun places of interest.  Easy on street parking and friendly neighbors were a bonus.
The interior of the home was very welcoming and very clean!  The hosts left detailed instructions about the home, where to find things, how to access wifi, how to lock up etc.  and they even stocked the refrigerator with some basic necessities which they invited us to use.  The house was more than accommodating for our extended family of nine.  With 4 bedrooms, a beautiful, spacious kitchen and dining area, outdoor garden and eating area and 3.5 bathrooms, we had a very enjoyable, relaxing experience during our stay.  Everyone who stayed in this home agreed that the house, the hosts, the location etc. were all top-notch!!  We would highly recommend this home and the host!"
1307898,9025166,2013-12-02,9638990,Cathy,"My extended family all flew from Colorado and Utah for Thanksgiving and stayed in Glenn's home on Capitol Hill in Seattle. This historic home has been beautifully restored and was ideal for our needs. We slept 7 comfortably and  there are plenty of bathroom accommodations for this many as well. The kitchen was fabulous for cooking the full Thanksgiving dinner including turkey.Lots of room for everyone to come and help with preparations. We had 12 for Thanksgiving dinner and it worked perfectly. In addition, the home is within walking distance of several great parks as well as a short drive or bus ride down to the Pikes Place market, Seattle Art Museum etc. Thanks Glenn and family!! We will be back!! Happy holidays, Cathy and crew"
1307898,11755114,2014-04-14,13067805,Maggie,"We had a lovely weekend at Glenn and Amanda's house! It was the perfect location for 2 families (Oregon, BC) to come together and we loved every minute. To name a few of our faves...relaxing with friends and bubbly in the sunshine on the back deck, enjoying meals together in the open kitchen (that grill is super!), the music room, enjoying the spring flowers and the garden, the kids feeling like it was Christmas on steroids with all those new toys and games, sitting by the fireplace in the evening, the kids donning their swimsuits and ""hot tubbing it"" in the jacuzzi, being so close to downtown, yet far enough away to be in a quiet and family-oriented neighbourhood. We even discovered that the American tooth fairy that visits your house brings loot for all 5 kids when one loses a tooth! We arrived to a sweet welcome note and had such a fantastic weekend. We appreciate you opening up your beautiful home and sharing it! Thank you."
1307898,12128553,2014-04-23,1984955,Steve,"Fantastic! I am an airbnb fan - and this was my best ever place to stay! The house is simply beautiful - so wonderfully done up, very spacious, spotlessly clean, comfortable with a sweet little garden, in a peaceful historic neighbourhood, near the park and shops with so many lovely houses to admire as you walk along the streets full of flowers and blossom. We had the perfect stay here and hope to go back next year if Glenn can have us!"
1307898,16699160,2014-08-01,8990238,Crystal,"This was the perfect home for our family trip to my sister's wedding.  It had plenty of space for everyone, a beautiful backyard, and enough bathrooms that no one felt on top of each other (you can also take multiple showers with no water pressure or hot water issues, yea!).  It was so nice having a large kitchen with two large eating spaces, and the hosts were so considerate, they even stocked the refrigerator with some basic essentials.  The convenience to bus lines and Volunteer Park were important for our group, and this location couldn't have been better.  The house has beautiful decor and a very warm feel.  My son couldn't get enough of the endless supply of nerf guns!  The outside spaces are the most special in my opinion, both back yard and front yard are amazing places to relax and enjoy Seattle.  "
1307898,16968119,2014-08-05,7635487,Marta,"My family stayed in this home for four nights and described the house as beautiful and just perfect. The backyard was great for lounging on a hot day or just sitting with a large group for dinner. The master suite was lovely and was a nice treat with its jetted tub. The house was perfect for a large group and everyone comfortably fit. It was located on a quiet neighborhood street, with plenty of on street parking, and it was in easy walking distance to restaurants, Volunteer Park, and a bus that goes downtown. Glenn was super accommodating and helped make their visit easy and comfortable. We would not hesitate to stay here again!"
1307898,17494768,2014-08-13,11210441,CathyAnn,"Our family gathered from various United States and Eastern Europe for a wedding. We were four generations and we don't get altogether often, so finding an accommodation where we could maximize our time together was important. Glenn's home is close to our son's home, central to the planned activities and close to many Seattle attractions. The house is beautiful, well appointed, in excellent condition, quite large and very comfortable. Glenn answered all of our questions promptly and provided us with a thoughtful 'visitors manual' which detailed the functioning aspects of the house as well as suggestions for finding close-by shopping and leisure locations. The house and Glenn more than met our expectations and helped to make our family event a memorable success. "
1307898,23358994,2014-11-30,7206585,Terry,"This home is the perfect place for a family reunion/family weekend.  As described, there was plenty of space for a family of 8 to 10 adults and the central Seattle location made it very easy to get just about anywhere in Seattle.  The neighborhood is very lovely and perfect for walks - we loved walking in Volunteer Park."
1307898,29644387,2015-04-10,12098980,Annie,"Glenn 's house was very quiet and clean, we were enjoy the vacation in  Seattle!"
1307898,30197397,2015-04-19,27808083,Brandon,"The house was in a very nice part of town.  The house is furnished very nicely with plenty of room.  The internet is fast, there several TV's with Cable TV.  The fridge was clean and there were a few beers and wine left for our party.  On the kitchen counter; there were nicely made instructions for the house and some tips on what to do in the area.    All in all the stay was great and I am thankful that you would share your home with us Glenn.

Brandon"
1307898,36183416,2015-06-26,2598243,Daniel,"This was a fabulous experience.  Wonderful place to stay, helpful and responsive owner.  There were six of us with plenty of space.  Every square inch of the house has been tastefully remodeled and looks beautiful.  Photos are accurate.  We slept well, thanks to very comfortable beds, white noise fans in every bedroom, and main floor sounds don't really travel upstairs to the bedrooms.  High quality linens and towels.  Upstairs: Master bedroom with white bed has attached bathroom with tub and shower, walk-in closet with pull-down ironing board; 2nd bedroom with wrought-iron bed has attached bathroom with shower; 3rd bedroom has two kids twin beds; 4th bedroom has leather couch (pull-out bed) and wood floor; 3rd and 4th share a hallway bathroom.  5th bedroom is in the basement with washer/dryer.  Modern kitchen was well-stocked with utensils, spices and other pantry basics, a dishwasher, coffee maker and capsule espresso machine.  Two living rooms in front, very comfortable couches and chairs.  Office with pc and printer.  Back deck with table, nice deck furniture, two grills.  Pretty landscaping.  Lovely neighborhood to go for a walk.  The commercial district of Capitol Hill is close by and there are a bunch of really great restaurants there.  Wonderful, wonderful place!
"
1307898,38091551,2015-07-13,24339293,Katherine,"The house was clean, well stocked (including the refrigerator!), and very inviting.  We loved the location and the neighborhood, which was perfect for our needs.  I would highly recommend this home to anyone needing accommodations for a large group - perfect for family reunions or weddings!"
1307898,38977185,2015-07-20,1516847,Angela,"Myself and nine friends stayed here for a recent wedding. It was the perfect spot for us. Fantastic location, beautiful and spacious house and fun area. During our 5 day stay we truly got to know the exciting and diverse area that is Capitol Hill. Glenn was super helpful and very quick to reply during all communication. Would highly recommend staying here "
1307898,39899700,2015-07-27,25661416,Lynn,"What a lovely home in a beautiful, quiet, yet convenient part of Seattle. Our family enjoyed having a place to gather as we celebrated our daughter's wedding. Glenn was a wonderful host, providing us with all of the information we could possibly need, not only about the home's amenities but also about the surrounding shopping and restaurant scene.  Many wonderful family memories were made during our stay there.  It was everything we hoped it would be and so much more."
1307898,41716755,2015-08-09,9963216,Hélène,"My family and I had an amazing time in Glenn's house. 2 couples and 2 single people had more than enough space in the bedrooms. Glenn provided everything we needed; including baby adapted furniture. The house was spotless when we arrived, making it very easy to settle in.
We made the most of the kitchen and barbecue. There is more than needed.
The location is really good, with plenty of shops at walking distance, three nice parks, and restaurants. It is easy to reach Seattle and the airport by bus. It's also very easy to park if you come by car. "
1307898,55182095,2015-11-29,10608222,Peter,"My family and I celebrated Thanksgiving and my 60th birthday.  We couldn't have been happier with this home.  It's such a warm and welcoming environment.  We really felt like we were in our own home.    This is in no small part due to the fact that the owners actually live in the home; it is not used exclusively as a rental property.  The kitchen is fantastic.  Very well equipped.  We found everything we needed for our Thanksgiving feast and more (they actually left quite a number of treats for us in the refrigerator).  We wished we had more time to have fun in the kitchen!  The house is as you see in the photos.  Well maintained.

The neighborhood is really lovely.  Volunteer Park is very close.  Restaurants and shopping are convenient.  We had an easy time getting around town from the home.

My family and I would stay in this home again in a heartbeat.  It will be outstanding for any family or group of friends.  I can't imagine a better experience.  The home was the main cog in what turned out to be and incredible Thanksgiving and 60th birthday.

All in all, we had a fantastic experience."
3121829,16118018,2014-07-22,3005115,Theresa,"We really enjoyed staying in this townhouse in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle. It's very spacious and in a great location! We could walk to bars, restaurants, parks, the locks and more. It's a very clean house. We had three guests, so one person slept on the couch, which was really comfortable. "
3121829,16488838,2014-07-28,2434184,Rachel,"I was in Ballard with 2 friends to do some wedding dress shopping, although we did not have a baby, the baby friendly townhouse was great for us. Plenty of space and everything we needed for our stay. The location is fantastic, we loveeeeee Ballard! We were there in July and it was great to be able to open all the windows and get a nice cross breeze! One of us slept on the couch which was big and comfortable. Barrie was a breeze to communicate with and we had no trouble getting in to the house. "
3121829,24403213,2014-12-28,1925083,Allison,"We had a lovely visit in this house. It was clean, comfortable and well stocked with toys for a family with young children. It's very close to the main drag in Ballard as well as several other amenities such as the library and supermarket. Description is very accurate!"
3121829,38864862,2015-07-19,13384257,Christine,"Barrie's home was a lovely place to stay with our little daughter. We were so happy to arrive and felt right at home. The house is well laid-out and super clean, and we all slept soundly. All the toys and books were much appreciated. We used the bikes to go to Portage Bay Cafe (amazing) and the locks. Great neighborhood and wonderful accommodation. Many thanks!"
3121829,40763753,2015-08-02,36282090,James,Absolutely great location and house was just as described.  A very cozy place with everything we needed.  We loved being minutes from the Ballard Locks and the cute breakfast places.  Barrie was very good at communicating with us and left lots of great instructions and local suggestions once we arrived.  We had a great stay and will stay again if we're in Seattle.
3121829,57899658,2015-12-30,28782224,Patrick,"We had a bit of trouble getting into the house, some trouble with the lock sticking, but after we got in it was smooth sailing. The house is very cozy and comfortable and my son loved playing with all of the toys. It was very easy for us to walk into downtown Ballard from this location. "
6249536,32426378,2015-05-17,9762661,Lan,房间里设施齐全，住得挺舒服。就是西雅图停车费真的挺贵，尤其是早上五点要去续费真是令人无语啊…
6249536,53260226,2015-11-07,41910772,Yiwei,"Melissa Yao is a nice host who is really helpful and cares for the experience of your living. Besides, the apartment is clean and neat, highly recommended."
7808495,42791627,2015-08-15,38761858,Zach,"This was a great airbnb experience! The house was very nice. I didn't have much interaction with Dan since I was busy, but the interaction I did have was positive."
7808495,44975259,2015-08-30,14857936,Zi-On,"We didn't see each other a whole lot because our schedules didn't line up and we were out for most of the day, but when we did run into each other, Dan was very friendly and helpful. The house is very clean and tidy, and the room was set to go with fresh linens and towels for us to use. Accessing the house is really easy because there's a keypad with a code that he provides on check-in day, so you don't have to worry about losing your key or arriving when he's not there.

The location is really close to downtown and Cap Hill, and just around the corner there plenty of bars and coffee shops that are usually bustling. Won't have a problem finding things to do here!"
7808495,49851890,2015-10-06,3520917,Jonathan,Dan is really nice and he's got a great place. The location is excellent as well. He's pretty busy with work but we managed a few interesting conversations. Really happy with the experience. Would definitely stay there again. 
7808495,51397404,2015-10-19,46472669,Maneesh,"I had a wonderful trip, and staying with Dan was a ton of fun. The room was clean and comfortable, the location was great. Everything like access and internet and sheets/towels was taken care of, and everything went smoothly.

Dan made my first trip to Seattle very welcoming and I had a good time hanging out with him and his friends watching football."
631445,1975387,2012-08-13,3021444,Andrea,"Our stay in Seattle was lovely. Alicia was nice and extremely helpful. The space was great and had everything one might need. All the rooms are spacious and welcoming, an overall nice and comfortable layout. Located in downtown Seattle allowed us to have access to so much. The view was amazing! The only challenge was parking at times (late nights on the weekend). Great spot and great host. Seattle is beautiful, Alicia's space is representative of the same beauty. "
631445,2044972,2012-08-20,312289,Brett,"No complaints here.  Alicia was courteous, prompt in her responses, and timely when it came to meeting me for check in.  Her place is in a great part of town, probably the best in my opinion for a visit to Seattle.  Her place was clean and very livable.  I've stayed in other vacation rentals and what I liked most about Alicia's place is that you feel at home, but not as though you're in someone else's home.  It's got everything you need to cook and keep the place clean, a great view of Belltown and a great balcony.  Highly recommended."
631445,2083620,2012-08-24,3149823,Carly,So clean and comfortable. Perfect area. I got up early and ran to Pike Street Market everyday and there was a great bakery right below the apartment with coffee and amazing baked goods. Would definitely stay again!
631445,2144125,2012-08-30,3132305,Brandon,"The apartment was nice and right by the water. I have my own photos from the place that look just like the view in the room description. It is in a really good place to walk to the Space Needle and Pike Place Market (Tip: If you go to the space needle, just go to the restaurant and eat some awesome locally sourced food. Then, go up to the observatory for free afterwards. I liked the rotating view from the restaurant much better than the cramped, blocked, and loud view on the upper deck.).

We got food several times from Pikes and the apartment had everything (even spices) we needed to cook a delicious meal. There was a trash shoot down the hall, but we didn't know what to do with the recyclables (i think we were required to recycle). We brought our baby, and she did really well. While the rooms are not ""Baby-Proof,"" we didn't really have any issues with her in the place. We just shifted the items that the baby might get in trouble with out of her way. Watched some TV after the baby went to bed, but the channel selection was pretty sparse. Probably a motivator to get out and do something!  It got a bit rowdy outside on Fri and Sat night (there are several bars located on/around the block), but maybe that's only an issue if you aren't partying anymore (like us). There is a mini grocery store just on the corner. This was nice for the ""oops, I forgot..."" moments because bigger stores are a bit of a walk. Really nice weather. It felt like a Houston winter, but it was August.

We didn't get a chance to meet Alicia, but the cookies for the Macrina bakery she left us were probably some of the best I've ever had. The bakery is awesome and just outside the entrance of the building. We got coffee and breakfast there just about every morning on the trip (my wife was obsessed)."
631445,2250805,2012-09-10,3191849,Annette,"Stay was great.  Location and view perfect only downside, PARKING. We walked everywhere but had to get in and out of town with a car so parking was a pain, just beware.  Check in was easy, Alicia gracious with our novice status. The space was beautiful, pool nice and roof wonderful.  Would do again."
631445,2408171,2012-09-25,2908958,Soumya,"I booked this unit for my family who were visiting from out of town. I had the opportunity to meet Alicia and view the unit before she handed me the keys. I felt the unit was decent sized for a couple (3 would be the largest I'd recommend). Both living room and the bedroom had a water view. With the amenities the building had to offer, and the location of the place, I'd say the price point for renting this unit out was excellent. I'd recommend this unit and Alicia as a host to anyone."
631445,2563088,2012-10-09,1709060,Joyce,"Beautiful condo, great location, can walk to everything, great view and very accommodating host. I will stay here again when I visit Seattle."
631445,2824181,2012-11-07,549934,Lucy,"Our stay was wonderful! Located in Belltown, we had access to restaurants, bars, shops, and the waterfront. While the neighborhood can get a bit lively on the weekends, the windows in the apartment were able to lock out much of the noise. The bakery located just downstairs was a dangerous indulgence to have so close but we loved it! The bed and the sofa were comfortable and Alicia was a pleasure to meet. We stayed for a month as we arranged for our permanent move to Seattle, and she made sure we had everything we needed (and even set us up with wifi). It was a lovely experience.  "
631445,3041137,2012-12-08,1621299,Penny And Tony,"Alicia's condo was very clean and the location was perfect; within walking distance of the water front, Pike Place Market, the Space Needle and Macy's. Alicia greeted us when we arrived and checking in was a breeze. We cannot wait to go back and stay at Alicia's place. "
631445,3124419,2012-12-20,4162875,Mark,"We spent 4 nights at the condo and really enjoyed our stay. The location was perfect as it offered a more local perspective on the city while still being very close to downtown. We walked everywhere and enjoyed exploring the neighborhood and surrounding areas. The bakery/coffee shop downstairs was both convenient and a welcome alternative to our usual Starbucks habit. 
While we didn't end up cooking, the condo has all the kitchen basics to make a meal and we appreciated the option.  Overall, the condo is cozy and a comfortable place to start and end each day.  Our only complaints were the street noise and squeaky bed, but we would def. stay here again."
631445,3246479,2013-01-03,4209244,Frances,"My son and I enjoyed our 8 night stay at Alicia's condo in Seattle.
She met us with a key on our arrival and showed us around, even though it was late afternoon on Christmas Eve. The location is excellent, an easy stroll down to Pike Place Market and the Waterfront.
The main drawback with this property is the lack of onsite parking. If you arrive with a car, be prepared to constantly have to move it and pay for parking. There is free street parking from 8pm to 8am, but as this is such a popular area with lots of restaurants, most times you have to park far far away. The small lot opposite can be used overnight but you will have to move your car before 6am !!! There is 3 minute parking out front for loading/unloading only. 
The condo is comfortable and has water views.There is  a queen bed in the bedroom, but only a sofa (not sofabed) in the living area."
631445,3447011,2013-01-31,4464838,David,"Exactly as advertised, the apartment was immaculate in every possible way. Alicia was very helpful and friendly. Highly recommend!"
631445,3573336,2013-02-18,349652,Carl,"Alicia's was a wonderful host - efficient, friendly and a good communicator. I had an evening flight home and she very kindly allowed me a late check-out. The apartment is delightful. It's set in a safe, modern block and is clean and comfortable. Best of all is the location in the heart of Belltown, a buzzy neighbourhood with loads of great eateries and bars. Don't miss the Macrina bakery nextdoor. Some people might find the street noise (traffic and revellers) a problem but not me. I slept like a baby.  Highly recommended!"
631445,4063077,2013-04-07,5126333,Amy,"The condo was a perfect place for my husband and I during our stay in Seattle. It had everything we needed and was walking distance from major attractions. The condo was clean, cozy, and offered a nice view of the Sound. We would definitely recommend this condo to others and request it again, should we ever return to Seattle. Thanks, Alicia!"
631445,4071571,2013-04-07,1980128,Caspar,"NOTE: Because the host canceled my reservation 7 days before arrival, I did not actually stay. Nevertheless, I want to share my experiences.

I emailed the host twice, six weeks before the booking date, and the host did not reply to any of my questions. A week before the booking date, the host canceled for personal reasons (which is understandable, and I sympathize). However, as a cherry on the cake, she sent me a copy pasted message with somebody else's name on it. Overall, I must draw the conclusion that this host does not communicate well with guests, personal crisis or not."
631445,33842275,2015-06-01,3989578,Mark,"Alicia was a great host I drove 12 hrs to get to seattle from San Francisco so I was super tired,  Alicia suggested to come by early to get settled in so I thank her for doing that,  she checked us and showed us around the apartment,  looked just like the photos,  the Internet worked just fine as well, the balcony has a Amazing ocean view, the location on this place is the best,  it's situated right in the middle of everything,  u can drive or walk to most tourist locations in less than 20 min,  there is so much to see and do we stayed an extra day! Loved staying at Alicia place and would recommend it to anyone"
631445,34298343,2015-06-07,12528273,Ruth,"Great apartment in a great location! For visiting Seattle for the first time, this apartment is in the perfect neighborhood to start exploring. Alicia welcomed us as we arrived and showed us around the building. The apartment was just as described and has great views from the balcony, including Puget Sound. Would definitely recommend this place for a first time visitor to Seattle."
631445,35294764,2015-06-17,7070839,Karen,"Alicia was fantastic from start to finish. She contacted us early on to plan when we could get the keys. The property was beautiful, the view fantastic, the building and amenities were very clean and well kept. There were a huge variety of places to eat and to buy groceries all on the same block. We walked everywhere in the Seattle. The only con was the noise, many sirens both day and night. Alicia warned us and provided a fan for white noise. Well you are in the city and should be prepared to take the good with the noise. Bottom line, is that I would stay here again when I return to Seattle. "
631445,36003754,2015-06-24,17671491,Oscar,"The listing was 100% accurate, the place is as pretty as the pictures and very comfortable.  Alicia was a very gracious hostess, she met us on Saturday night, even through it was later than we had expected to arrive in Seattle.  She walked us through the apartment and explained where everything was located.  She also had a few suggestions with regards to places to eat and things to do in Seattle.  The apartment is in a very secure building, we always felt safe, it has a nice pool and a good gym.  Additionally, it is located a few blocks from many of the prime tourist sites.  The apartment is in the city, so it may be a little noisy at times, but once we were asleep, we didn't wake up until morning.  I would highly recommend this location.  "
631445,36364664,2015-06-28,28048385,Rose,"Excellent condo, great location with a great view.  The place was nice and clean, everything you needed, felt like home. The wieghtroom has all modern equipment. Bike eliptical, treadmill and weights.  My wife and I have stayed in Seattle before but not in Belltown. It was perfect.  Lots of places to eat and drink nearby.  We walked every where to Pikes Market, the waterfront, Key Arena and the Space Needle. We even walked to Safeco Field! The bakery and pizza place next door were both convenient. I would recommend this place and definitely will be back.  Thanks Alicia for being a great and accomaditng host."
631445,37054705,2015-07-04,33069671,Sean,"Alicia was a fantastic when I visited Seattle.  She was able to work around our early flight schedule by meeting us at the apartment when we arrived, and by allowing us to just leave the key on our way out.  

Alicia gave us a tour of the place and it was perfect for a 5 night stay in Seattle.  She was always quick to respond to any of my questions, and showed us around the building so we could use the pool and jacuzzi.  I couldn't have picked a better place to start off my day and rest at the end of the night.
 
The location is amazing, with a great cafe, diner, and many restaurants within a block's walk.  I walked to most of the places we wanted to see since the Seattle Center and Pike Place Market are right around a half mile walk from the location.  There are so many great places to eat nearby, I just explored nearby to find delicious food.

I could not have been more satisfied with my stay at Alicia's place.  I will definitely point anyone visiting Seattle to stay here."
631445,37737525,2015-07-10,18421323,Sean,"Alicia's place is clean, nicely furnished and welcoming.  Alicia is an awesome host and was attentive to our needs.  "
631445,38982768,2015-07-20,3117999,Owen,"Alicia was awesome!  Contacted me well in advance to inform me of potential issues due to my late arrival, and all worked out great, contacting me during my family's stay to make sure we were comfortable and knew about current events around town.  The space itself was great!  Nice and clean, perfectly located near a lively strip of restaurants, and well appointed.  10 minutes walk gets you everywhere from the Space Needle to the waterfront, so we didn't need to rent a car.  Couldn't have asked for a better place or host for our vacation."
631445,40562073,2015-08-01,29179348,Kyle,"Alicia's condo was great. The place was clean and felt very welcoming. The rooftop was great for relaxing and enjoying the view, The condo is in a great location, it's close to the market and the space needle/seattle center. We walked everywhere and it was nice being close.  We ate a many great restaurants close by as well. Alicia was very easy to communicate with when we arrived and when we left. She was very polite and even gave us a heads up about road closures near by due to a parade. Overall I had a great experience and would recommend this place to anyone."
631445,41729942,2015-08-09,12771746,Danika,"Alicia was extremely helpful and accommodating, making our trip a pleasant experience! The apartment is very clean and located in a prime spot with lots of good food around -- including Shiro's! Would definitely recommend staying at this cute unit in downtown Seattle!"
631445,44278644,2015-08-25,29727548,Maria,"We did not meet Alicia in person, we communicated via text.  Alicia responded very promptly to all our questions with helpful information.

Pros 
The apartment was centrally located on 1st Ave., very much within walking distance to Seattle Cente, Pike's Place Market, the ferries, and the waterfront.  The place was clean, well appointed, with ample closet and drawer (website hidden) and fan were available if needed.  Kitchen was well equipped with a full size refrigerator, coffee maker, and cooking implements, including cookbooks!  Use of washer and drier.  Lovely little balcony facing 1st Ave.  Free street parking after 8pm.
Cons
Smaller than it looks based on the pictures (aren't they all?).  Windows and balcony doors face 1st Ave, so it tended to be noisy when the windows were open to let the breeze in.  Also got hot since the windows face west, closed drapes solved that problem.   "
631445,45104677,2015-08-31,7524671,Mario,"Alicia was awesome. Met me at the apartment and showed me around, as well as gave me great advice for some of the best restaurants, coffee and glasses of wine in Belltown. Would, without hesitation, stay there again. A truly top AirBnB host."
631445,45575653,2015-09-04,34777707,Anna And Bill,"Alicia went out of her way to make our 2:30am arrival painless. She is pleasant and helpful. The apt was clean with  a beautiful view of Puget sound. It is within walking distance to Pike's market, Space needle, ferry and many restaurants. "
631445,46129962,2015-09-08,36297762,Jeanne,"We were in town for Bumbershoot and Alicia's apartment was the perfect location. The apartment t is lovely and we'll furnished. Her neighbor Ed was great and met us with the key and showed us around the building. The apartment complex is secure, well taken care of and the maintenance staff very friendly. I took advantage of the pool access to swim some laps. Great stay."
631445,46717296,2015-09-13,14519239,Margaret,"We were met at the door and 
Alicia showed us around the apartment.  It was very conveniently located and comfortable.   The unit only lacked an iron and she very promptly bought one!  We were impressed."
631445,48184170,2015-09-24,8932643,Matt,"The condo was clean, the location was great and Alicia was quick to communicate in order to make sure our stay went well."
631445,49596397,2015-10-05,22502198,Sharon,"This condo was in a perfect location, close to the market and the water. We walked just about everywhere. Also close to awesome restaurants, coffee, bars. The bakery downstairs has fantastic pastries!  The condo has Views of the water and a cute patio for a nice day and also a rooftop patio with a grill and more views! The condo itself has everything you could beed. It's clean and so well decorated! Alicia communicated well to make for an easy arrival. She made accommodations for our early check in and late check out, which we very much appreciated! I highly recommend this place if you are visiting Seattle."
631445,50085827,2015-10-09,10564788,Nikki,"Alicia's apartment was perfect for my husband and I! It was our first time in Seattle, and the location was great. Not only were we close to all the big tourist attractions (Pike Place, Space Needle, etc.), but we were also close to bus lines so that we could go out to some of the other neighborhoods. Alicia was so wonderful to work with as well! We were not sure what time we would be arriving, so she arranged to have her neighbor meet us which worked out perfectly. Her apartment is super cute, clean, and well stocked. If we are lucky enough to make it back to Seattle in the near future, I will definitely be contacting Alicia to stay at her place! Also, check out the bakery downstairs - amazing! "
631445,50747334,2015-10-14,39032054,Corinne,"Everything was great! Alicia contacted me right away and was quick with communication.  The place was wonderfully located- easy walking distance to everything, including public transportation, which made getting around the city without a car doable.  The view from the rooftop deck was lovely.  Would definitely recommend and would stay there again. "
631445,51534449,2015-10-21,7170540,Julie,"Alicia made it easy to book and check-in. Neighborhood is bustling with fun and fashion, and smells from Macrina Bakery wofting up and around the building entrance.  All things good until getting inside the unit. Older, dated building...kept up pretty well, but unit is a bit run down. No A/C as promised...very HOT. Neighborhood was VERY loud. Listing doesn't point out that the condo is situated right over a highway tunnel area and when windows are open to get fresh air, it's way too loud to host a guest and have a nice quiet conversation, or to get a great night of sleep without being awakened by traffic or street noise. Photos of the condo are not up-to-date—need to be switched out with the current (email hidden)ings are as nice as they appear. Unit is VERY small. Sofa isn't so comfy, bed not so much comfort either. Bedroom linens lacking the lustre of the photos listed. Need to add some amazing pillows and linens (perhaps down comforter as option to old poly one). Pillows are dead and need a burial. Bring your own if you want to get ANY sort of sleep. In the kitchen it was nice to have items to host a small gathering. If wanting to make smoothies, there's a blender that's seen better days. It needs a fresh engine—really needs to be replaced. value goes, I think this one is priced a bit too high for the offering. All that said, if you don't need the space for more than a bed and a shower, and don't mind moderate comfort and the noise from the street, it's located nicely and has decent street parking!!"
631445,52709636,2015-11-01,27617127,Matt And Ashleigh,"Location, location, location.  Alicia's apartments is perfectly located between the Pike Market and City Center (Space Needle area).  Each were about a 10-15 minute walk.  Additionally, the nearest bus stop is about a 5 minute walk and from there, the Emerald City is very accessible.  

The apartment is nice and was as shown in the listing description.  Everything we needed was provided.  All communication with Alicia was via text message/Airbnb messenger and we did not meet her.  The apartment is next to multiple bars/restaurants so be prepared for outside street/crowd noise on the weekends but with the windows closed (or on weekday nights) you should be OK.  Lastly, the Macrina bakery directly next door to the apartment building was great.  We started each morning there before heading out for activities.  They had amazing coffee, pastries, and bagel sandwiches.  

"
631445,54380679,2015-11-19,46335960,Ledjie,"All was perfect!  I arrived early due to flight from Kalispell MT & Alicia was gracious enough to let me occupy her condo early.
The condo was perfect in every way:  location; safety; cleanliness; supplies; etc.  Couldn't have been happier!  Thank you Alicia!"
631445,55110163,2015-11-28,44081759,Mary Ellen,"Alicia was there to greet me upon arrival with the apartment in tip-top shape.  The apartment has been updated since the pictures, with a 3-seat sofa in blue and a number of other different upgrades in linens, etc., as well as paint.  I was very pleased with the quality and comfort of the accommodations.  The building itself is in excellent shape and what I would call a newer building.
The noise level was much lower than what I experience in my apartment at home.  There are a couple of busy streets outside, but other than an early morning delivery to the bakery, I slept well.  Being near the bakery was worth it though!
The location is great.  Most of the places I wanted to go were walkable or a short and cheap Lyft ride.
Alicia was always one text away with any questions.  
I loved my stay and would definitely consider this Airbnb again!  
"
3215404,14249029,2014-06-15,4727028,Evan,"My stay was great, Will was very friendly and accommodating. His apartment is comfortable and Will had sheets and towels ready for me on my arrival.
Good internet connection, and connecting my laptop to his projector made for great movie viewing in the living room.
The building is close to the QFC for groceries, and having a full kitchen with a dishwasher was very convenient.

There were two major downsides: the apartment is in the very hilly Queen Anne neighborhood, and walking the last two blocks on the way back to the apartment was quite a chore.
The only other problem was with the people who lived upstairs. They stomped around their apartment late at night and early in the morning. I'm a very light sleeper and this made it hard to get a full and restful night's sleep.

Overall, very positive experience."
3215404,14706095,2014-06-24,5305971,Irene,"We stayed at Will's place for a long weekend and had a great time. We were in town for the Seattle marathon and could walk to the start from the apartment. The location is perfect, close to the Space Needle/Space Center in the Queen Anne neighborhood. The apartment is clean and comfortable and you can almost have a movie theatre experience when watching a movie! 
Will is very easy to communicate with and flexible, a great host. If you want to explore Seattle, this is the perfect place to stay!"
3215404,14896050,2014-06-28,17203984,Kate,"Nice place, and yes the view is great! Will was very accommodating for my last-minute reservation. Clean sheets, clean bathroom, super friendly!"
3215404,15116054,2014-07-02,8737028,Will,"I had a great stay at Will's apartment in Lower Queen Anne. The location is very convenient, yet peaceful and relaxing. The neighborhood has many amenities as well. There are two nice 24-hour grocery stores (QFC and Metropolitan Market), numerous good restaurants and bars, and you can walk to both downtown and Lake Union. As noted in another review, however, the neighborhood is hilly. That's what makes for the great views of downtown and the Space Needle though. It's great exercise too.

The apartment itself is well laid out with good kitchen and entertainment facilities. I enjoyed using the projector to watch movies. The shower is good and the bed is very comfortable. Everything was clean and well organized throughout the whole apartment. As another reviewer noted, you can sometimes hear the neighbors walking around in the apartment above, but, living fairly close to my neighbors at home, that did not really bother me.

Will is a great host. He came out to the street to meet me once he knew I was in the neighborhood, which I appreciated since the door to the apartment is tucked away. He showed me around the apartment, provided the information necessary to access the internet, and gave me recommendations for a nearby cafe (Caffe Vita) and neighborhood restaurant (Citizen), both of which I enjoyed. He also provided me with a parking permit to use for the weekend, which is necessary if you have a car.

All in all, I would be happy to stay in Will's apartment on my next visit to Seattle and recommend it to others who are looking for an affordable, convenient place near downtown Seattle."
3215404,15657512,2014-07-13,17771123,Lynn,"Will was a great host, very flexible and accommodating.   The view was awesome, the home was clean, and affordable.   "
3215404,16132204,2014-07-22,17264665,Marc,"Great space - will provided everything we needed and made sure the stay was as comfortable as it could be.

There were towels and sheets waiting for us and the space was nice and spacious.  The projector was a nice touch even though we only stayed at the house for a few hours a day.

The location is great - though if you have problems walking up hills this might not be for you but I didn't mind them at all.

The location is amazing if you need to be near key arena/museum/space needle and there are a lot of good restaurants close by.

Would stay again!"
3215404,16322622,2014-07-25,17971161,Giovanni,Will's place was in a great location. A short cab or Uber ride to downtown or Capitol Hill.  Clean and spacious. The futon in the living room worked out perfectly as a second bed for my friend who I was traveling with.  I had no issues getting into the apartment or setting anything up.
3215404,16567955,2014-07-29,7795270,Yoauri,"I visited Seattle last week and had a wonderful experience. Wills apartment is centrally located and conveniently close to all major attractions. The view from the living room is absolutely astonishing! Will was also super accommodating with our arrival and departure times. Overall, two thumbs up for Will. Thank you for hosting us!"
3215404,17907272,2014-08-18,12549663,Ben,"This was my first time using AirBnb. The apartment was great and Will was very friendly. This place is very close to tons of bars, restaurants, coffee shops and the Space Needle. "
3215404,18637844,2014-08-29,20460895,Brian,Nice view of the city from the living room and terrace area. Walking distance from majority of things we did. Good restaurants close by. Clean accommodations reasonably priced. Parking availability was a bonus. 
3215404,18779248,2014-08-31,20727359,Justin,"Staying here was great, my bus broke down en route, and he waited for me to get there. The place was clean and exactly as described. Basically a simple, nice process start to finish. Thanks very much!"
3215404,18868250,2014-09-01,7290729,Steven,"Will lives in a beautiful neighborhood, and his apartment was neat, well-appointed, and comfortable. He was great at accommodating my travel plans as well. Parking wasn't abundant, but it was easy enough to find on the block, even at night."
3215404,20723463,2014-10-04,21845348,Paul,"Pretty neighborhood on steep hills.  Lots of good, relatively cheap restaurants nearby.  Clean house, great view, fun place to stay."
3215404,24342554,2014-12-26,12356562,Lindsay,Will was a great host and his apartment is in a GREAT location with a beautiful view! I highly recommend Will's apartment if you''re ever in Seattle. He was communicative and left a great list of places to go in the area. 
3215404,24684683,2015-01-01,25045502,My-Phuong,"Will was wonderful about responding quickly to any questions I had. Since this was my first airbnb, I had plenty. The apartment itself was awesome, with an incredible view was the needle and the city. This was a great experience and I would definitely stay with Will again for my next trip to Seattle! "
3215404,25648558,2015-01-21,12620830,Cori,"My experience at Will's place was awesome. It was in a perfect location, convenient, private, and had an amazing view. It was even nice to stay in if you don't want to go out.. Mainly because of the projector. Haha. I felt very comfortable there, and checking in, and checking out was super easy. Good restaurants and bars all around. I walked over to the space needle and through the park by myself it was great, relaxing, and a safe neighborhood. I even extended my stay. Wish I could of extended longer. Next time! Thank you, Will. Oh and of course lovely Amy."
3215404,35688632,2015-06-21,34075098,Jinny,Will's place is really lovely and it's a great location. I enjoyed my stay.
3215404,36436157,2015-06-28,18562504,Elisa,"I spent 2 nights at Will's apartment and we felt at home.  Clean,  central and most of all it has a breathtaking view of Seattle downtown and the space needle.  I will certainly try to stay there again when I travel to Seattle! Easy to find a parking spot,  Will has a permit in the house. Great,  great,  great! Thank you Will!"
3215404,40920736,2015-08-03,33141272,Claire,Great location and great view!  The apartment was clean and looked like all the photos.  Will was available and responsive for all of our questions. Had a great stay!
3215404,47413915,2015-09-18,36810285,Ryan,"Will's place is great, comfortable joint with a great view in a good location. The place was clean and well organized, and Will was ready to help with anything I needed.

The neighborhood is quiet, but has a 24 hour drug store and grocery store, as well as dozens of great restaurants just down the hill. Perfect for hiding out from the city without leaving it."
3215404,47839806,2015-09-21,43811877,Cristina,"Drats, just wrote a long review and it disappeared. Will was great and so was his apartment. He made it easy to gain access, left me his parking pass, and was always available by message or text. I didn't spend a lot of time in the apartment but it was perfect for what I needed - a cozy little space with an amazing view of downtown. I even opted to walk home from the Space needle (only a 5-10 minute walk). Highly recommend this place."
3215404,50815028,2015-10-14,2925697,Venita,"Will's place was cozy and friendly. It is in a great location with a stunning view. The neighborhood is great and within 15 minutes walk you have a huge variety of dining options. If you walk up the hill to Queen Anne you get even more amazing views of the city and some great food! Will was easy to communicate with and made the stay very straightforward. Also, the bed was very comfortable!"
3215404,51222926,2015-10-18,27191443,Chris,"Will has a great place that matches the ad very well. Beautiful views of the city, too! This fit us perfectly for a two-night stay. The neighborhood is cute, quiet, and centrally located."
5364414,28735130,2015-03-29,16669572,Wen,Absolutely gorgeous townhouse with all the amenities you can ask for.  Beautiful view in a great location.  Host was very fast at answering all questions and concerns.  Thanks for making it an unforgettable trip for the entire family.
5364414,29203413,2015-04-05,21971645,Dave,"In general this is a great place and a good value in one of favourite neighbourhoods in Seattle. 
The positives, Phillip and Ting are well  organized and accommodating. Check was very easy. The place is well kept, new and clean. It is very spacious and the kitchen, roof deck, and beds are great. It's also close to the locks and good running trails. 
The only negatives are that its very close to the train tracks. Like 75 ft. Bring your ear plugs cause there are a couple of trains a night. The second is that it is a stacked town house configuration with lots of stairs. Bedrooms are are 2 floors away which may or may not be desirable. All said we would stay again."
5364414,30464258,2015-04-22,30124160,Emily,"The apartment indeed has beautiful views and an awesome roof deck. I found myself staring out of the tall windows watching the water and boats go past. I was apprehensive about the proximity to the train tracks. We stayed for four nights and for some reason, some nights the train noise was way worse than others - like it felt as though the train was passing once/hour. Some of the trains go on forever and they make a very loud screeching sound. Other nights, I barely heard the trains and if I did they didn't bother me one bit. During the day, they are quite charming to watch go past. One thing that wasn't clear is that the apartment is three stories tall. The master bedroom is on the top floor, the living room/kitchen is in the middle, and the bottom floor has a guest bedroom and separate office/bathroom. We traveled with our children and we felt a bit far from them. The bedrooms let in a lot of light in the morning, so we were all up very early (too early!).

The home is neat as a pin and was immaculately clean. I would recommend this place for a couple, but probably not the best arrangement for a family with young kids. The neighborhood is awesome and we loved walking to the shops and restaurants nearby, as well as going to the Locks and Golden Gardens. It is right on the Burke-Gilman trail which we enjoyed biking and running on. 

Overall it was a nice stay, but it is only feels right to disclose the train noise to future guests. 


"
5364414,30997130,2015-04-30,1804976,Maggie,"The pictures don't really do this space justice — it's beautifully light and delightfully spare. Philip was responsive about getting the keys to us, even though he was out of town. And it's really in quite a great place. That roof deck, man. Yes. 

There is a train, however, as mentioned in the listing. It is insanely close. It's great for watching during the day, but at night, bring ear plugs or turn your white noise app up loud.

This would be five cheerful stars if there had been ear plugs already there (the train is very, very close, which is great during the day, not so great at night) and if the kitchen had been slightly better stocked. We only cooked in during our time there and we ran into a few missing essentials, like a baking sheet. Would return! Thanks! "
5364414,33087170,2015-05-25,28501703,Monda,"This house is truly beautiful. It is clean, brand new and very trendy. It is also about 10 minutes from the city, making it easy to go to-and-from. However, those are its only positives. 

When we booked our trip, there were no reviews for this house. So we felt a bit duped to find out the proximity of this house to the railroad. It's basically in the front yard. At night, you'll feel like the train is in your bedroom. The house was stocked with the bare minimum. One towel per person, one roll of toilet paper in each bathroom, one roll of paper towel.....catch my drift? After 4 days, we had to go and purchase all of these things so that we could finish out our stay. 

We also had a hard time with the virtual keys that they have setup to get in/out of the house. Sometimes the app was responsive, other times it was glitchy and we were stuck outside. 

All in all, we loved Seattle and had a great time. There are just a few things that need to be added to this house make it vacation or renter ready. "
5364414,33799973,2015-06-01,30781021,Nancy,"Philip answered promptly and gave accurate information, emailing instructions (the e-key software could not be accessed, so he kindly left metal keys instead) and even a list of nearby restaurants.The home was very clean and uncluttered, yet warm and inviting. 

We booked this fabulous townhouse with another couple for a family event in Seattle. It was a perfect place to mingle, share meals, and invite a few folks, while still having private space (BRs w/baths on first and third floors, separate entrance at first floor). 

Tall corner windows by the fireplace and TV (and in the master BR) overlooked the canal, harbor, passing ships, and sloping shores – a real piece of Seattle. But the truly panoramic view was from the rooftop patio (the “fourth level”) for morning coffee, evening cookouts, and sunsets over the distant mountains. Wow! The wet-bar/mini-fridge up there was a nice touch. 

At first glance it was just a dead-end street, but it was a good walkable location near Old Ballard. We crossed the bridge and watched boats pass thru the Chittenden Locks, walked Magnolia and Discovery Park, and ate at a friendly local place (Kiss Café).   

One downside – the nearby railroad tracks. Before booking, I asked about this. Philip frankly replied that he didn't mind the occasional passing trains but admitted the noise could be a problem at night. On arrival, there were bowls of what looked like mints next to each bed – tiny disposable earplugs! They did cut the sound and it wasn’t a real big issue for us, but it might be for some.      

Overall a wonderful place to stay.

5364414,34732643,2015-06-11,15102347,Justin,The house is beautiful and Philip was responsive and helpful. Id definitely stay here again!
5364414,34942619,2015-06-14,5656824,Marilyn,"Philip was great in providing info about entry to house and info about the neighborhood prior to our arrival.  The house was beautifully furnished and uncluttered.  We had been concerned about the on street parking, but were able to find a space in front of the house most days and only once needed to park up the block.  The roof deck is a great plus.  The trains were loud a few nights, but only a small discomfort considering all the positives.  "
5364414,35644703,2015-06-21,17555132,Jaime,This is a beautiful home in a beautiful location with a gorgeous view. I enjoyed waking up and going on my morning runs along the water. Beds wet comfy and Phillip was quick to respond to any questions we had prior to arrive.  I do have to say although the trains are awesome to see the do get very loud at night when sleeping. Some nights worse then others but that might have been the Vino. 
5364414,35951199,2015-06-23,18943921,David,"The condo was immaculate and had everything we needed and more. There could have been a few more condiments (We ran out of salt and pepper). It was in walking distance of town, the Ballard locks and the beach was not too far away."
5364414,36510210,2015-06-29,17870710,Anne,"The house is beautiful, comfortable, and better than expected. We would stay here again and again. So close to Ballard and all the restaurants, shops, and farmers market.  "
5364414,36987535,2015-07-03,35796152,Olga,"We thoroughly enjoyed our time at Philip's place. The surrounding neighborhood offered ample amenities and opportunities for (email hidden)e house itself was immaculately clean, had a well-appointed kitchen, and, with living areas on four floors, lots of room. The roof deck was a particular plus, as it afforded us many stunning sunset views over Puget Sound. Regarding the train that runs past the house, we found that closed windows at night mitigated the the noise of squealing brakes; earplugs also helped.  Overall, however, the Market St. house is an architecturally interesting, spacious and pleasant place to stay."
5364414,37839643,2015-07-11,30239555,Denise,"Our family loved the house, especially the rooftop deck! The views from the deck and full length windows of the water and surrounding water were beautiful. The Ballard neighborhood has lots of restaurants, places for great coffee, and interesting little shops. Philip was very helpful and provided us with lots of information about the local area. The passing trains were a bit disturbing the first night, but we quickly acclimated. We enjoyed our stay very  much. "
5364414,39665347,2015-07-25,11183273,Mallorie,Beautiful and very clean home in a great neighbourhood. Lots of restaurant and coffee shop options as well as cute little boutiques. The house was fully stocked and very comfortable. It was extremely easy to get downtown. The train is louder than I had expected but we got used to it right away and didn't have to use the earplugs that the host provided. Our 3 month old slept right through it every time. Thanks so much! We would definitely stay again. 
5364414,40081868,2015-07-28,6933808,Rebecca,We had a wonderful time at Philip’s house in Ballard.  A great / private location just a few minutes’ drive from plenty of shops and restaurants.  The house was very clean and an interesting layout; offers privacy for couples or groups with the bedrooms on the first and third floors.  We enjoyed spending time on the roof.  Great views of the surrounding areas and the trains can be fun to watch – some seem to go on forever!  Be mindful they can be a bit noisy at night but as long as you are aware and prepared for this you will have a great time enjoying a true Ballard experience.  Thanks again for a wonderful stay.
5364414,45922732,2015-09-07,29516436,Jessica,The listing was accurate and the house was beautiful. The roof deck amazing. The trains are close and loud but our group had no problems with it. This place is perfect for all (except those with noise sensitivy or difficulty with stairs). The owner was responsive with each inquiry. Overall perfect stay for a great price. 
5364414,46503705,2015-09-11,32716935,Ryan,"My wife and I had a wonderful stay! The place was everything we wanted - ultra-modern, plenty of space, close to the water and trails, but not too far from the city. As other reviewers have noted, you can definitely hear the trains at night, but they didn't seem to bother us at all. Phil was very responsive, and we'd love to stay again! "
5364414,47372876,2015-09-18,26923849,Jisun,"Philip's home is absolutely gorgeous; it was modern, clean, perfect scenery and made me love Seattle even more!  Philip was so accommodating and very helpful, which made the stay enjoyable.  Looking forward to booking this beautiful home again soon!!!!"

The house was so neat and clean and had beautiful views of the water. It was an easy walk to the shops and restaurants in Ballard and a nice quiet neighborhood. The train nearby is pretty loud, but I'd still choose to stay here again!"
5364414,49094597,2015-10-01,3179655,Amelia,"This was the simplest, easiest process ever. Philip was in touch with all the details we wanted/needed, but not over-the-top. We arrived to find a beautiful home with all the amenities we needed. Our stay was incredibly comfortable. I highly recommend Philip and this property!!"
5364414,50474941,2015-10-12,2012989,Tim & Suzy,"Staying at Philip's place was such a treat!  What a gorgeous home in such a wonderful setting.  The house is so comfortable,  stylish, and well equipped. The master bed was incredibly comfortable and the walk in shower was delightful.  The roof deck is a perfect place for a afternoon cookout, morning coffee, or evening drink.  Our son and daughter in law live just down the hill, so the location was perfect for us!  It was easy to find parking and the access to restaurants, coffee shops and walking trails were close.  "
5364414,51460722,2015-10-20,31755507,Julie,Phillip was very kind and extremely accommodating. The home was perfect and very clean and in a great location. I would definitley stay here again will refer my friends. 
5364414,52256973,2015-10-27,2147901,Tyler,"The unit was great! Super cool and modern with great access to the entire city, although its hard to even want to leave the Ballard neighborhood.

The trains weren't too bothersome and the hosts were kind enough to provide ear plugs. I'd say if you're a light sleeper it could be an issue but otherwise the view and unit are worth it."
5364414,53448975,2015-11-09,30014329,Susan Vig,"Listing accurate, home lovely and clean. Quiet neighbors. No problem with the train noise - it was delightful to watch the trains from the roof.    Easy walk to Ballard shops and restaurants.  Beautiful views.  Would rent again.  Thank you for renting to us.  "
5364414,55201861,2015-11-29,27340601,Constance,"The listing was described accurately and the photos of the interior and views from the home showed what to expect when booking here. The master bedroom suite on the top floor was so nice with a great view of the bay and the trains going by. The trains were so fun to see and the sound was soothing. The walk in shower with river rock stones in the base was lovely!  We enjoyed the roof top deck with beautiful views. The home is tastefully decorated, comfortable and clean with nice bedding and comfortable beds in the master bedroom suite and the lower level guest room.  Parking was easy as was  getting in, even though we arrived late after dark."
5364414,55904104,2015-12-07,22278431,Burt,"Fabulous host and fabulous town home. We were four:  the size and amenities were really comfortable. Trains were not as intrusive as I had read in some reviews. If you like trains, you will love this location. Would definitely stay there in the future. Great Ballard location. And, spotless!"
5364414,58001894,2015-12-31,45069879,Barbara,"So happy to have found Philip's listing; was the perfect location for us to spend our holidays.  A lovely home, very comfortable, and well equipped.  A stone's throw from family and walking distance to great shops and restaurants. Philip was very responsive and a great host.  As others have mentioned, the house is very close to the trains, but we didn't mind them at all - in fact, we enjoyed watching them.  "
2612399,13099001,2014-05-19,14943699,Olivia,Phil was very welcoming even at midnight! The loft was quaint and surrounded by plants and flowers on the patio. The ladder to bed was always a treat after a long days out n about. The park next door was awesome and home was super close to dowtown! Awesome experience! I will be back to Seattle.
2612399,13582184,2014-05-31,15397677,Jen & Alexis,"We absolutely loved staying in this charming cottage. It's very clean and has a peaceful view of the garden. Phil was super helpful and kind. You can tell he put a lot of thought into providing everything you may need. It really felt like a home away from home. We can't wait to visit again. Thanks so much for making our trip and experience easy, comfortable and simply great. - Jen and Alexis "
2612399,17672360,2014-08-16,8034564,Kirby,"Phil and Andrea were incredibly welcoming and provided a very comfortable environment to stay in Seattle.  I would highly recommend staying with them.  I stayed for almost 3 months with them and had an amazing experience.  

Their house is located in a neighborhood about 15-20 minutes by bus ride from downtown Seattle.  Very easy commute by multiple buses a block or two from their house to downtown (also an easy walk- about 2 miles).  It is a quiet neighborhood but easily accessible to all parts of the city.  Could walk up to the Madrona neighborhood in 5 minutes to great restaurants, cafes, and shops, down to the beach in 15 minutes, to Capitol hill in 10 minutes, etc.  

The ""cottage"" was well equipped with everything one would need, was clean, very comfortable, and had plenty of room.  They had a gorgeous luscious green backyard with a grill and plenty of outdoor seating that I used when I had people over for dinner.  

They were always making sure I had everything I needed and was comfortable. Very, very nice people.

The bathroom was surprisingly spacious and having laundry was a nice bonus. The neighborhood was an easy ~20 minute bus ride to Pike Place/City Center. I'd definitely stay again! Thanks Phil!
2612399,18938191,2014-09-03,15065383,Amy,Our stay was great. They even left us treats a couple days. Would definitely stay here again. Location is great with an  awesome park next-door. We loved walking in every afternoon and smelling the fresh herbs in the garden.

Phil was very organized and even left little notes to ensure we could find everything. Phil is very knowledgeable about Seattle and recommended some great spots to visit.

The home was just as the photos and description suggested. We felt very much at home, all was neat and quiet and cozy. Andrea called to make sure all was OK. He helped with a small matter later in our stay. A very pleasant experience and a charming place."
2612399,21284176,2014-10-14,19993454,Kristofer,Phil and Andrea made us feel right at home. The directions to the house were spot in and we found it easily on our arrival.

Neighborhood is great, walk to grocery store, bakery, Lake Washington, downtown all very close. The place is quite charming, felt much bigger than we expected. My favorite place to stay in Seattle!"
2612399,21883023,2014-10-26,7464452,Guinevere,"This is the perfect place to stay while exploring Seattle! It's comfortable, affordable, centrally located near lots of busses, and in a good neighborhood with plenty of delicious Ethiopian restaurants. Phil was a very kind host with excellent communication.

2612399,22089387,2014-10-29,22904370,Brynna,"Phil and Andrea were wonderful hosts. Their studio couldn't have been more perfect. It's in a great neighborhood, very centrally located and easy to navigate. They left us delicious treats from Andrea's cafe, which was so thoughtful. The studio is a very cool space with a loft and everything you need located right there. It's extremely private and located on a great street. We would definitely recommend this studio to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Seattle. "
2612399,22190448,2014-11-01,17837627,Elyse,Phil and Andrea's place was perfect for us! We were in town for a short trip and it was just enough space for my boyfriend and I. Not only was Phil accommodating in meeting me when I got into the neighborhood but they also left us some tasty goodies from Andrea's coffee shop. We didn't really see each other after check-in just because we had pretty busy plans but it was easy to stay in communication via the Airbnb app. Overall we had a great stay.
2612399,22484881,2014-11-08,19699754,Chelsea,"Phil was an excellent host!! He was very hospitable and inviting. The loft is beautiful and has everything you need from a washer/dryer, bathtub, stove/oven, television and a spot to hang all your clothes by the bed. There were very helpful notes left in places letting you know how things worked. Also, it's nearby bus lines making transportation easy (or a $5-8 Uber from Capitol Hill). Overall an absolutely wonderful experience and would definitely suggest to everybody."

The cottage itself is equipped with everything you could need during your stay and is absolutely adorable. The location was very convenient, easy commute from airport and minutes from bus lines that can take you wherever you need to go. Phil and Andrea were very communicative regarding instructions and available for any questions...they even provide a list/map of their favorite local places. I would recommend the cottage to anyone for a comfortable stay in Seattle!"
2612399,23364772,2014-11-30,21745911,Marcy,"Thanks, Phil, for being such a great host (making sure that this tourist had all of the tools needed for a trip to Seattle) - and for being so accessible.  This cabin is a great size for two guests (though, tall guests will have to use their noggin when in the loft space and not stand up too quickly - bonk).  Street parking was safe, the neighborhood was quiet, and downtown was incredibly easy to get to (maybe 12min by car).  We were working remotely and appreciated the zippy WiFi (thank you!) as well as all of the natural light.  Also appreciated was that our hosts recycle and provided receptacles for this.  A fine home for travelers who want to see it all, but still have all of the comforts of home."
2612399,23661430,2014-12-07,8401034,Melissa,This is the sweetest/coziest place to stay! We were welcomed by treats in the fridge and helpful little notes throughout the apartment. It was adorable and toasty with wonderful natural light from the skylights throughout. I appreciate a comfy bed and good shower and both of these things were fantastic! We rented a car using priceline and were able to see so much of Seattle. It is an awesome city and  this was the best place to stay!!

2612399,24482553,2014-12-29,2275352,Stephen,"My Wife and I stayed very happily in this beautiful garden cottage for just under a week during Christmas Holidays. Phil and Andrea were very friendly and on more than one occasion we returned home from a long day to delicious baked goods.

The cabin is somewhat close to downtown. Walking downtown from the cabin is pleasant (even on the cloudy days) and Uber is very cheap in the Seattle area. If you're renting a car, the distance will not be a problem at all."
2612399,25012376,2015-01-05,22381647,Maxx,"This place is amazing! Very clean and cozy. The location is perfect for those who are looking to explore downtown, (about a $10 Uber to Pike Place) and everything you may need for groceries and dining is within walking distance. The neighborhood is very safe as well. This place offers a lot of privacy, wee were greeted by Andrea the first day then didn't see him at all after that. There were notes left all over the cottage with instructions on how to operate things, and suggestions for what to do in Seattle. If you are considering a trip to Seattle, stay here. You won't regret it!"
2612399,25407445,2015-01-15,21423729,Misty,"This was one of the best experiences in travel i have ever had!  Phil was prompt in responses from beginning to end of the entire process.  The space and location were beautiful and the little notes around the flat were helpful and pleasant.  While we never got a chance to meet Andrea, her delicious baked goodies were a delight that were told everyone about!  I will definitely be staying here again on my next trip to Seattle and will suggest it to anyone headed that way!"

quite lovely."

Before our arrival, Phil emailed me a couple days before we flew out with helpful information.  When we arrived at the cottage we were greeted with a warm welcome from Phil and a cute little note on the door that said ""Welcome Lynne!"" super awesome! His home is very cozy and very artistic! The cottage is perfect! It was a home away from home! It was a mini house in a house! Has a Loft for the bedroom a full bathroom, a kitchen and a living room! I was super impressed! Phil and Andrea have little tiny notes that were posted around the house which were super helpful! The location of the cottage was literally 5-8 minutes away from downtown Seattle and the university! Phil & Andrea gave us great recommendations on what to do around Seattle! I really recommend staying at Phil & Andrea's Cottage when you visit Seattle. They have great vibes, a great home, and its near everything in Seattle!


Cheers!
Lynne"

Phil & Andrea left a bunch of little notes around the house about all the little quirks of the place, so I wouldn't be confused about things (certain lights, locations of certain things, how to use the heating/AC,e etc.), which I appreciated.  I also came home one evening to a bag of homemade kale chips and lovely little note from Phil--so sweet!  Overall, the place is clean and comfortable, and as a fantastically well-equipped kitchen!"
2612399,26678162,2015-02-17,18613273,Paolo,"Our stay at Phil and Andrea's cottage couldn't have been better. They were so warm in their welcome and made it clear they'd be available if we needed anything, but left us to be in the space. My girlfriend and I were out most of the days and only back at night, but it was a perfect place to power up for the next day's adventures! The pastries from Andrea were delicious and the coffee/French-press was much appreciated. We definitely used the washer/dryer (we were rounding out a week long trip and packed lightly). All this comfort and SUPER easy access to downtown and Capitol Hill by bus. We'll definitely be staying here again on our next visit.  "
2612399,27792701,2015-03-12,25028907,Gordon,We were warmly welcomed by Andrea when we arrived; Phil was traveling.  Our stay was delightful.  Everything we needed was available.  There is great access to public transportation as well as a nice grocery store within easy walking distance.  There was plenty of street parking.  The space is set up nicely to allow for configuring the layout to be meet the needs of the moment.  We are looking forward to our planned extended stay this summer with great anticipation.

The descriptions on the posting are very clear, accurate and sincere, which satisfied all of our needs. The host was very accommodating  and attentive when needed; the communication before, during and after the stay was great, thanks Phil!!! 

Public transportation towards downtown Seattle is great and only 15-20 minutes away, your also not as nearby and can enjoy some peace; can't forget to mention the bakery right around was a major convenience.

2612399,28567354,2015-03-26,28140828,Christopher,"We really enjoyed staying in Phil and Andrea's cute and cozy cottage. Everything was nice and clean and all of Phil's descriptions were accurate. Everything we needed to cook, except food of course, was provided in the cottage. Phil welcomed us upon our arrival and encouraged us to knock on the door if we needed anything. We didn't spend much time talking with Phil or Andrea but I couldn't have felt more welcomed. The neighborhood is nice with plenty of street parking and easy bus access and it's close to most of the cool spots in Seattle. Overall, this is an excellent place to stay, as long as you are alright with the lofted sleeping area. This is the first time I have used airbnb and it was by far the best experience I have ever had with travel lodging. I would gladly stay here again and I highly recommend it to everyone else! "

2612399,30453690,2015-04-22,25070125,Petey,Awesome host with great recommendations for the neighborhood and  Seattle. Super cozy and welcoming house with calming environment.
2612399,30757048,2015-04-27,26026006,Jasmine,"This was a fun, clean cottage to stay in. It's located in area that has enough amenities around it to enjoy, and good transit for everything else. It really felt secluded! Very enjoyable stay. Bring a sleeping mask to block sunlight though if you aren't an early riser. "
2612399,31034975,2015-05-01,19397897,Tina,"My time at the Studio Loft Garden Cottage was wonderful.  Phil was a wonderful host.  He and Andrea were easy to communicate with prior to my stay, and very accessible while I was in Seattle.  Phil was friendly and helpful suggesting sites and transportation options while in Seattle.  My son lives less than 3 blocks from Phil and Andrea.  I am thrilled that I know about the Studio Loft Garden Cottage for future visits.  The property is beautiful, peaceful, plenty of space for one or two people.  Be aware that you must be able to climb up and down an angled ladder to reach the sleeping loft.  I think that's important to know.  If you have any limitations to knees, legs, or the ability to climb up and down talk to Phil about the very sturdy ladder.

If you like peace and quiet, a helpful and friendly host and a lot of extra touches  that made me feel valued....this is the place for your Seattle visit."
2612399,31697933,2015-05-09,7166638,Cheri,"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle. Phil was a great host. The cottage was perfect for what we needed and we only wish we could have stayed longer. We were a 20 minute drive from everything we needed so the location was perfect for visiting family, friends and all the popular attractions in and around Seattle. We will definitely be back and hope to stay at the cottage again in the future"
2612399,32002618,2015-05-12,32386244,Sarah,"We really enjoyed our stay in this ""Cabin in the city"" as we called it.  It really feels like home and is very lovingly maintained.  Our host was very kind, prompt, accomodating and thoughtful! "

Phil seemed happy to provide recommendations for places to see and eat, making us feel at home. The location was perfect and we can't wait for our next stay here. "
2612399,32586442,2015-05-19,21152251,Erynn,"What a great spot! A quick drive to downtown, Capital Hill neighborhood, Madrona. The loft was cozy, welcoming. Just what we needed for a long weekend to Seattle. Phil and Andrea provided us with a whole list of their favorite spots nearby. Surprised us with baked goods. The place was awesome. Phil and Andrea were awesome. Book it. Now. "
2612399,33217676,2015-05-26,5409887,Elizabeth,We loved staying here!!! Phil was friendly and helpful. The place is sweet and had everything we needed. Quiet and beautiful. Easy access to and from I-5. Thanks tons!!!

Their cottage overlooks a garden on one side and a park on the other, and the unit is quiet and peaceful. Wish I could have stayed longer! "
2612399,33979038,2015-06-03,26166524,Leanne,"We came to town for a wedding and stayed at Phil and Andrea's studio loft. It is very charming and is as described. There was only two of us so while it is small, it accommodated us very well.  We also appreciated the fully functioning kitchen and laundry. The oven is apartment size but we made good use of it making food for the wedding! We liked walking just around the corner to get a coffee in the morning and it was only a few blocks toward Lake Washington for some other fun shops. Thank you for a pleasant stay in Madrona!"
2612399,35285747,2015-06-17,26499093,Caitlyn,We had a wonderful experience staying at Phil and Andrea's Studio Loft! The loft was very clean and comfortable. You have all the necessary amenities for your convenience and it's a relatively easy walk downtown Seattle. I felt very safe in their neighborhood as well as on our walk to and from downtown. I would definitely recommend staying with them if you're headed to Seattle!  
2612399,35766098,2015-06-22,18135693,Phil,"Phil's place was the key to a wonderful three day visit to Seattle. Great location to travel to various sites. Free parking. Quiet, restful setting.  Good conversation with and great advice from  Phil as well as a welcoming chunk of artisan bread from Andrea.  Steps up the house and ladder to the loft are not for every guest but were no problem for these fit 60 somethings.  Would definitely stay here again."
2612399,36357546,2015-06-28,1564256,Aeris,Phil and Andrea place is one of the best value accommodation in town. Tranquil water feature in our private backyard with plenty of tree to keep us privacy. Upstairs loft sleeping area has a skylight can open it to get fresh air when we were sleeping. Phil is helpful enough to give us direction to walk down Lake Washington by Columbia street and the yummy bakery from Cafe Torino .. It is one of the good memories in Seattle trip.
2612399,49090316,2015-10-01,25028907,Gordon,"My wife and I were guests of this charming cabin in the city for the months of July, August and September.  It is located near multiple bus routes.  We purposed not to have a car and easily got around by foot, bus and an occasional use of CAR2GO.  The unit was clean, comfortable and homey.  The kitchen was fully outfitted, with neighborhood grocery just five blocks away.  Our hosts were welcoming and very accommodating. "
2612399,49772377,2015-10-06,837136,Maeve,We had a great time at the garden loft! Seattle was easily accessible and the loft was nice and clean and situated and a very pretty back yard. 
2612399,50741944,2015-10-14,27580184,Alexandra,"Staying at Phil's Studio Loft Garden Cottage was wonderful! It really felt like home because you basically have your own tiny house which is warm and comfortable. Although we did not get to meet Phil, we could contact him during our stay any time. We did not have any problems, everything went well and the house was exactly as discribed as well as very clean. Thanks again!! We really enjoyed our stay there. "

2612399,52313211,2015-10-28,39183430,Ashley,"Phil was an excellent host. We didn't cross paths much, but Phil and Andrea made us feel very welcome. The cottage was a unique and fun place to stay in a cool neighborhood. Very close to downtown, and walking distance to restaurants plus a delicious bakery just around the corner. Phil provided us with recommendations on where to eat and where to find anything we could need. We even got to sample some of the pastries from Andrea's cafe which were great! So glad we chose this over a hotel. Great stay! "
2612399,52698906,2015-11-01,43447774,Beth,"Phil was very accommodating. He supplied the personal touch of a 'welcoming' pastry and directions to nearby sights. My favorite was the coffee shop just around the corner. Usually I use VRBO, but I would use Airbnb again because of my experience with Phil and his apartment."
2612399,53321366,2015-11-08,37852864,Abby,"One of the best parts of our nearly week-long trip to Seattle! Phil and Andrea's cottage was so cozy and the perfect size for two. Good food nearby and convenient grocery store a few blocks away. They were very accommodating and welcoming, giving useful tips and recommendations.  Easy access to public transit--we had no problem getting to downtown and other hot spots. Felt safe and really at home. Thank you!"
2612399,54232529,2015-11-17,33729990,Beca,The loft could not have been more perfect. A beautiful little patio area right out back with a pond. The loft was so cute and comfortable. Phil and Andrea left little pastries for me from time to time. The bedroom area was so cozy and pretty with a sky light in the bedroom and also in the bathroom. It was amazing. I did not want to leave. 
2612399,55353144,2015-12-01,37198202,Kasumi,Phil＆Andreaはとてもいいホストでした。彼らはつたない英語を話す私達に、とても親切にしてくれて温かく迎えてくれた。コテージは清潔で夜はライトに照らされた池と天窓から見える空がとても素敵な場所でリラックスできた。
2612399,56026572,2015-12-08,1826567,T.,"I was greeted by Phil upon my arrival and he was very kind as to show me around the home along with telling me about the area such as where to find good food, transportation etc.  I loved my stay as it was quiet and even though it is attached to the main house it still felt like a separate tiny home.  Very cozy, clean and comfortable!  I would definitely stay here again!"

2612399,56659042,2015-12-16,7138931,Blair,"Phil was an excellent host! After booking his place, he sent me info on his favorite places within walking distance and detailed directions to help find the place! He was there when we checked in so he gave us more detailed suggestions to fit our needs and wants. He left us delicious treats from a local bakery! The place was clean and cute! We were walking distance from most of all of the things we did, which was very nice. We loved every minute of our trip and would recommend this place to anyone!"
2612399,57116747,2015-12-22,6688542,Jaimee,The neighbourhood was quiet but close to good stuff. Our hosts were incredibly welcoming and even left us some delicious baked goods every day. 
2612399,57865181,2015-12-30,1618802,Edgar,"Phil and Andrea were very accommodating, the night we arrived he brought us two delicious chocolate croissants from their coffee shop.

6993726,38028900,2015-07-12,32440294,Jesse,"Amazing place and an amazing experience! Brandon was such a kind host, and his rental was everything as advertised. The Madison Park area was breathtaking and a perfect place to stay: restaurants, the beach area, shopping. Couldn't have been better. "
6993726,38533527,2015-07-16,36977648,Steve,"Brandon's apartment is very nice and you can't beat the neighborhood.  It's a block away from a nice beach & park on Lake Washington.  The neighborhood has some great restaurants and shops and a nice bakery.  It's a great walking neighborhood.  It may appear isolated, but there's easy access to the freeway and to downtown.  "
6993726,40636036,2015-08-01,28714130,Connie,"We were thoroughly impressed. The condo was very clean, well equipped and perfectly suited our needs. The location actually blew us away! We loved walking around in this very interesting neighborhood; enjoying the beach, park(s), shops and restaurants. Getting to the attractions of the greater Seattle area was a breeze. This will be first place we consider for our next visit!"
6993726,41101835,2015-08-04,36582373,Mark,"We had a great stay.  The condo was clean, roomy and very accommodating for our family of four.

6993726,43688893,2015-08-21,40834730,Ashley,"The Condo in Madison Park was just we were looking for for our trip to Seattle. It is a little ways out from the city center but the location is great if you want to experience other areas of Seattle. We loved the cafes and small dining areas just around the corner and it has access to the water which was also nice. 
The condo itself had most of the things we needed. Unfortunately, no coffee machine that we could find (!) but otherwise well stocked (email hidden)e host responded quickly to any inquiries we had. 
Thank you Brandon and Melissa for a great Seattle experience!"
6993726,45137943,2015-08-31,15433940,Brenda,"Good location, bus stop across street was nice, and assigned parking spot was great!  Brandon was prompt in responding to our questions. "

It was walking distance to the Clipper, Space Needle, Whole Foods, parks for the kids, and shopping downtown. It is also close to bus lines direct to the baseball stadium. The view was outstanding, the apartment clean and nicely decorated. Sea to sky property management were very helpful resolving issues in a timely manner. Overall, an excellent place to stay! "

844939,44543646,2015-08-27,35469904,Seungho,"It was almost perfect to stay Emma's place even though it was my first airbnb experience. Very compact and neat apartment and every tourist attractions are very close to be able to walk around. The instruction how to stay here was very clear and easy to understand. Thanks, Emma. My family had really good time."
844939,47420404,2015-09-18,43808230,Katherine,"Apartment was exactly as pictured, clean and with a nice view of the space needle. The parking pass was missing, but Emma was able to drop it off that night so that my car wouldn't get towed. "
844939,48171105,2015-09-24,37361679,Lynn,"The apartment was as depicted in the listing photos and write up. Plenty of towels, kitchen items, and comfortable extras. Location is the biggest bonus!

613151,2032379,2012-08-19,3113965,Mindy,"I rented the lowered floor apartment,  the day before arrival Keith told me I got the upper level apartment. It was much older, smellier, hotter, dirtier than the space below. I was very disappointed with the outcome. Although The owner was very nice and welcoming, he was always coming in and out of the place, which took away a lot of our privacy, especially late at night.  I would just recommend renting the lower apartment, unless you like dirty old grundgy rentals!"
613151,5697704,2013-07-12,4311932,Kevan,The place was exactly what we needed.  Plenty of places for us all to stay.  Getting in was very easy and the price was great.  I definitely recommend this place to anyone.

6603376,33887490,2015-06-01,11853903,Todd,"Staying in this home was a wonderful experience!  The home itself is a beautiful architectural gem with lush views in every direction.  The furnishings are all comfortable, hip, and iconic.  It was a great experience going to the local produce store and cooking up a delicious meal in a kitchen fit for a chef.  We then ate on the peaceful deck overlooking lake views.  Analisa was a great host and gave the best advice on making the most of my weekend visit.  The home is a great launch pad for enjoying the region but it is so inviting that you may just want to stay home and enjoy the comfort and tranquility."
6603376,37070327,2015-07-04,19744514,Roderick,"Analisa is a really warm host! You can see lots of neat details in her house! She is kind from the very start! The house is really beautiful and cozy, embraced by the Forest. Seattle itself is a beautiful city, and it's even better to stay in Analisas house !"
6603376,37793013,2015-07-10,16252286,Jon,"Analisa was a great host and everything about our stay was enjoyable. The house is located in a very quiet area surrounded by trees yet with nearby bus access. Both modern and cozy, the home is truly a design wonder with a number of charming accents that made our time in Seattle all the more memorable. The kitchen has new appliances and a coffee maker with a good selection of coffee and tea left out for guests. Hope to stay here again!"
6603376,38505155,2015-07-16,34561695,Cheri,"This was our first time renting with AirBnb and it has set the bar high!  Analisa was a wonderful host and the house was incredible.  The pictures did not do it justice.  Before we even got to Seattle, we had great communication with the host and she was able to answer all our questions.  So...we felt very comfortable when we got started with our vacation in Seattle.  All the little details were incredible! We had food stocked in the fridge, wonderful toiletries, recommendations on places to see around Seattle and access to a washer and dryer.  The lego kitchen was amazing and even came with a search and find sheet for our son.  We decided to take the bus around Seattle and it was pretty easy to get the 75 into downtown with very few transfers. Analisa made us feel like part of the family and we really enjoyed the relaxing stay in this retail home!"
6603376,38865854,2015-07-19,4741535,Romel,"Analisa, is the greatest hosted you can get. She is the owner and the neighbor right next door. She did everything to make us feel at home.

The House is mesmerizing. The location is perfect. The Nature around it, is just great.

I would definitely go back next summer.

"
6603376,39769509,2015-07-26,34473298,Jeff,What an amazing vacation in Analisa's beautiful home!  We were traveling with our 3 sons (2 are teenagers) and wanted more than a couple of hotel rooms.  We also had family come visit for a few nights and had more than enough room.  The house is in a quiet neighborhood and convenient to downtown and all of greater Seattle.  Our youngest son loved the Lego kitchen.  We cooked and hung out at the house when we weren't running around taking in the sights.  It is a very open home with large windows that we opened.  The fresh air was invigorating and our experience was A++.  Thanks Analisa for making our vacation memorable!  We will definitely stay at this wonderful home again!
6603376,42166674,2015-08-11,2344270,Yi Yi,"We had a wonderful stay at Analisa's beautiful house.  Although we did not get to meet Analisa (she was out of town during our stay), she welcomed us with a note and some necessities.  The house easily accommodated our small family gathering of 4 adults and 3 kids.  The kids loved the lego wall!  Great location in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance to the beach and playground.  Close enough to downtown to enjoy all the tourist attractions.  Will definitely be back for our next Seattle trip!  Thanks Analisa."
6603376,42421607,2015-08-13,3543998,Richard,"
Analisa and her children were very welcoming!! The home is lovely and charming and truly exceeded our expectations! It was also very private, and there was a surprising view of Lake Washington from the balcony. It is at Matthews Beach! We walked the very short distance to the beach every evening after sight seeing in Seattle, and our kids swam in the warm lake water. There were always lifeguards on duty. She really equipped the kitchen with everything we could want. We can't wait to come back for an even longer stay next summer!"
6603376,43236485,2015-08-18,27240663,Steven,very nice experience.  wonderful attention to detail.  easy to relax and enjoy.  
6603376,43777981,2015-08-22,36470055,Kent,"We had such a wonderful experience from start to finish.  Analisa was very prompt in responding to all of my queries leading up to our decision to rent and was very accommodating as I tried to nail down a specific arrival time.  The home was every bit as fantastic as the pictures and other information described.  It was such a great location for us as it provided a sense of seclusion and privacy, yet we were within walking distance of parks, trails, and beaches.  The kids in our group were thrilled with the Lego decor and enthusiastically pursued the challenge to find the location of each piece that Analisa had provided on a list.  Nice touch!  Analisa made everything about our stay easy and stress free; from a notebook full of information on amenities/activities in the surrounding area to a special delivery of dishwasher soap.  We hope to rent the house again on a future trip to Seattle.  "
6603376,44527734,2015-08-27,22040406,Kathy,This home is as dreamy and unique as listed! It was a true pleasure to spend a few nights here. 
6603376,44950522,2015-08-30,3044171,Huy,"For the aesthetically inspired, this beautiful home goes beyond.  
Analisa is very hospitable and made us feel at home.  So many experiential treasures to experience in and around the house.  

thank you!

6603376,46710207,2015-09-13,12846875,Gina,"We had a wonderful time at this house for our girls weekend. The house was so unique and fun, it was perfect. Though technically in the city, it really felt like you were surrounded by forest with views of the lake. Very calming. Very clean and contemporary design. Would definitely book again. 
(The only issue we had was the neighbors power washing their roof all day on Saturday which was quite noisy but obviously out of everyone's control). 
"
6603376,47384816,2015-09-18,5450298,Karla,"The house was great & Analisa was a terrific host. She met us on arrival and checked in afterwards to make sure our stay was comfortable.  It was really nice to have a home to come back to each evening rather than stay in a hotel. The kitchen was well equipped and the house exceeded our expectations.  Loved hearing an owl one night as we were falling asleep. 
Would definitely stay here again. "
6603376,48271781,2015-09-25,34546043,Mackenzie,"Our group of five adults and two children had an amazing experience from start to finish in this spectacular house. 

Analisa went out of her way to make our stay as stress free and enjoyable as possible.  She was contactable throughout our stay to answer any questions we had. She was truly the perfect host. 

The location couldn’t have been more perfect for us.  The children loved playing in the front garden in the late afternoon after hours spent at the incredible children’s playground and beach at the end of the street. The house is so close to Seattle and all of its amenities yet the large wooded property gave us the sense of seclusion and privacy we were looking for on our holiday.  Although we did go out for dinner a few times we much preferred to cook at home in the chefs kitchen while looking out at the wonderful lake views.   

This home is truly amazing in every way and we look forward to renting it again in the future.  "
6603376,49253127,2015-10-02,43973094,Bryan,"Our family of 6 really enjoyed staying here. Analisa was a great host and made sure that we had everything we needed. The house was fun for the kids and interesting for the adults. It was our first visit to Seattle and we felt close enough to town but still far enough out that the neighborhood was very quiet in the evening. We would definitely stay here again when in Seattle. Thanks, Analisa for a great experience!"

6603376,50664339,2015-10-13,16894863,杨,"房子非常的漂亮，整个事透明的玻璃房。我们到达的时候已经是深夜所以Analisa把钥匙锁在了门上的一个小盒子里面，定到这样的房子非常的开心，家里需要用的东西都有，比如说吹风机啊，竟然连夹板都有。这些东西都有的话可以为我们减轻行李。Analisa 还为我们准备了一些饮料，她真的非常的贴心。因为我们一直外面玩，所以第三天才见到她，她希望我可以用中文评价大概是希望更多的朋友来住她家美丽的房子吧^_^ha ha,thank you for your beautiful house."
6603376,51555558,2015-10-21,44985249,Bongki,One of the most beautiful house I have ever been in and I have travelled ALot. the house is very very clean and up to date.  Also amenities in the house are awesome.  My two kids absolutely loved this house.  I felt like we were back home at our own house.  Analisa was an incredible host. This is a must stay in Seattle.
6603376,51922124,2015-10-25,18865210,Sarah,"Beyond dreamy, such a lovely space!  Perfect for the girls weekend we had, all 4 people had their own space with common areas for us to all spend time with one another, we stayed in mostly the whole weekend, cooked and just enjoyed this place!
 
Analisa was the most fantastic host, warm and welcoming.  We were greeted upon arrival and Analisa had provide some snacks for us in the fridge along with a lovely card welcoming us to Seattle. 
 
We spent two nights in this home and I wanted to never leave.  It is a 5 minute walk to a lovely, clean, family friendly park right on Lake Washington.
 
If I could buy this home I would, it is that AMAZING! The photos are spot on but the host, area, atmosphere, energy and everything else that comes with this place are an even extra bonus!!
 
I would travel back to this place in a heartbeat!!!
 

My friend Kate had similar things to say as well 
""Beautiful house--perfect for our ladies weekend getaway! The architecture and bright colors were as inspiring as the pictures. Clean lines and organized, but very comfortable. Each bedroom was lovely and relaxing. The short walk to the lake, through the quiet neighborhood and on the bike path, was enjoyable. Our host couldn't have been nicer and more accommodating. As our weekend came to a close, we didn't want to leave, but we vowed to come back. A wonderful experience!"""
6603376,53349716,2015-11-08,45490938,Neil,"Thanks, a very pleasant place to call home for the week."
6603376,53891362,2015-11-14,34702404,Katie,"Analisa was very helpful in giving us complete details for our reservation! The place was even better than in the pictures! Very spacious and clean and unique!  There is a great path to walk or bike along lake Washington, just a block away!  We would love to come back another time in the summer months.  Very accommodating host and an overall great Airbnb experience! "
6603376,54708511,2015-11-23,29007367,David,"The house was amazing! Everything was as pictured, and the area was great. No issues whatsoever. I would absolutely stay here again when visiting Seattle. Location was quiet and close to Matthews Beach. We really enjoyed the Legos built into the counter and the ensuing search, although we couldn't find Mexico [darn it! :-)]. Highly recommended! "
6603376,55103269,2015-11-28,43803031,Lynn,"My family of five, including three LEGO-loving boys, thoroughly enjoyed our Seattle vacation and five day stay at Analisa's gorgeous home!  We arrived late at night from the airport, and Analisa met us with a smile.  She thoughtfully had some breakfast essentials waiting for us in her very well appointed kitchen.  Everything about our stay was wonderful, and I highly recommend this Airbnb home.  You will not be disappointed.  From the comfortable beds and relaxing showers to the gourmet kitchen and amazing architectural details, this house has it all!  Thank you so much for your hospitality.  This LEGO loving family can't wait to return!"
6603376,55698428,2015-12-04,49564719,悦威v,房子特别漂亮！Analisa热情好客..房子一应俱全。临走时忘拿了
6603376,56125512,2015-12-09,10814334,Chris,"
Convenient, comfy and a cool place to land in Seattle.
The house is well equipped for a group stay, the beds incredibly comfortable, the decor fun and whimsical. The kitchen was great to cook in with lots of  nice kitchenware.  The only thing Analisa didn't organize was sunshine...we kept talking about how nice it would be to sit out on the decks if it wasn't pouring...but that's Seattle! In the trees, quiet and private-a great find! 
"
6603376,56407280,2015-12-13,49359180,Brian,"House was amazing, even more so than the pictures make it out to be!

Analisa was super accommodating and very quick to respond to all questions.

I would definitely stay here again!"
6603376,56796800,2015-12-18,3453511,Michael,House was gorgeous. Tons of authentic details from the furniture down to Heller bowls. Neighborhood is nice and quiet. Analisa was great. Very communicative before we arrived. We had a couple very minor issues and she lives super close making for very fast response times. There were even a few things in the fridge for us on arrival. Everything was great – can't recommend enough.
6603376,57204401,2015-12-23,40426471,Neil,"This is the perfect Seattle retreat, woodsy and secluded but with easy access to downtown Seattle or Bellevue/Kirkland. The pictures don't do the A-frame justice as each of the four levels are different and isolated, so the kids can be in the basement on the large tv while a floor above one group could be reading by natural light from the windows with a view of Lake Washington and another group mixing drinks in the well-equipped kitchen. 
Analisa made arrival easy, meeting us at our convenience and reviewing any issues we might encounter (composting, how to use the washing machine, wifi, etc) and was even available for a late-night lockout. 
This was the perfect holiday retreat for the five of us, and it would be great to return again in the summer when we could take more advantage of the outside areas."
6603376,57501112,2015-12-27,37177060,Nancy,"WHAT A GREAT HOME FOR MY FAMILY OF SIX TO HAVE A WONDERFUL CHRISTMAS.  WE DID LOTS OF COOKING AND EVERYTHING WE NEEDED WAS IN THE KITCHEN.  WE HOPE TO COME BACK TO THE LEGO HOUSE IN THE SUMMER AND ENJOY THE TRAILS, BEACH AND PARK. "
6603376,57892782,2015-12-30,17031632,Ariel,"The cabin is well designed and locates in the tranquil suburban area of Seattle. It enjoys a nice view of the lake and it is surrounded by trees. The furniture in the cabin is exquisite. The hosts provide everything you might need. The rooms are clean and tidy. The lights in the house are well designed, especially the one in the kitchen. It looks really pretty at night. Analisa and her husband are very considerate  hosts. They provide a manual with traveling guide and restaurants recommendations together with snacks and drinks in the refrigerator. They are very approachable whenever you encounter problems. We spent a great time here.


"
6603376,58516813,2016-01-03,45059990,Karen,"We spent four nights in Annalisa's beautiful home over New Years Eve. It was such a happy place to be. We spent a lot of time in the home with our kids as they were so content there and we could sit and read or rest after our adventures. A great spot close to everything especially the city. Beautiful surroundings, comfortable beds and everything we could have wanted and more. Analisa was prompt to answer any questions we had and had great tips and advice for us. This was our first airbnb experience and we won't look back now! Thank you Analisa! p.s. the little quirks and things to do within your house were a charm :)"
1531458,6972299,2013-09-01,8266552,Maryelle,"Great location if you have to go to UW .Melissa was prompt to respond and made very easy and fast to get the papers work ready.
That place is very quiet inside and out [no traffic at all ]
The apartment is very clean and spacious.
The balcony was wonderful to relax with a great view.
Thank you (website hidden) daughter is at UW for 4 years i am sure i will rent from you again.
Maryelle"
1531458,7761562,2013-10-01,8504801,Stefanie,"Everything was ok, we would recommend the appartment."
1531458,7957737,2013-10-09,9289137,Dan,"The place was great. Easy to find, centrally located to the UW campus, and an easy walk to many shops and restaurants. Would recommend to anyone looking to stay in that area."
1531458,8269121,2013-10-22,9430162,Jodi,"I had a great stay while in Seattle!  The apartment was clean and Melissa was a great host.  When I had a question, she responded immediately and I found the apartment exactly how it was described on airbnb.  The next time I'm in the area, I will either stay here or in another of Melissa's available units.  It was my first experience with airbnb, but it will not be the last!  "
1531458,10389940,2014-02-17,1423494,Yuriy,"- Actual photo.
- Convenient place (10 minutes walk from shopping center and 10..20min - from UW campus)
I would highly recommend this apartment. 
"
1531458,11157409,2014-03-23,9226562,Paul,"Very accommodating host. The location was excellent, just be prepared for steep hills if you intend on walking around. Thank you for a great AirBnB experience!"
1531458,11272954,2014-03-27,13327151,Taryn,"Melissa was very accommodating to my special request of having a corporate film shoot at her apartment.  She was very easy to work with, responsive to my emails and phone calls, and I would highly recommend her and her apartment to anyone looking for a place that is especially close to the University of Washington.   "
1531458,11324541,2014-03-30,1746717,Gregory,"Melissa was a great host. She was very easy to communicate with and was helpful in getting me oriented. The apartment is an easy walk to both the UW and the University Village shopping center, so I didn't need my car at all while I was there. You can't park right in front of the building, but there is free parking within a couple of blocks in either direction. I was in town during spring break so YMMV. The apartment is remodeled, and I was very comfortable. There is a shared deck, which provided a fantastic view of the city. The neighborhood is great for walking, which is one of my top criteria for finding places. It is hilly, though (this is Seattle), so be prepared for a hike. The downsides were a short hot water supply (I don't know how quickly it recharges), and a weak wifi signal. Overall, I enjoyed the stay."
1531458,11546816,2014-04-07,12912119,Harriet,This is a great apartment with accurate description and photos. It is in a really convenient location close to the University of Washington and shops. Melissa is a great host and responds very quickly to emails/phone calls. 
1531458,11756947,2014-04-14,534876,Shayna,"I really enjoyed my stay at Melissa's apartment. Area and building were super quiet, and the unit itself was super clean. The deck is the best part with an amazing view of Mt Rainer, great for enjoying morning coffee or reading in the afternoon. Also, though the shower/tub was a little small for me, the incredibly comfortable memory foam-topped bed, great natural light, and fast and reliable internet more than made up for it. I would stay there again in a heartbeat."
1531458,12026308,2014-04-21,1761730,Bryan,Worked well for visiting U of W!  
1531458,12230245,2014-04-26,6790945,Rhys,"Very plain, empty apartment with minimal to no amenities.  Very nice location in the center of Washington University but overall very simple.  Cleaning cost are way to much for the accommodations.  Would recommend for a single nights stay.  The house was clean and the host was accommodating.  "
1531458,12302115,2014-04-28,14091455,Laurel,"Melissa is a great host! I booked this place for my mother in law and her boyfriend. It's in our neighborhood and was the perfect spot for them while they were in town! Very quiet, clean and enough space for the two of them. The giant lilac tree in bloom was a major plus! Super cute place and I would recommend!"
1531458,13121340,2014-05-19,269209,Douglas,"Melissa made it easy to check in and get comfortable quick. Located very close to where I needed to be, it was nice to have a kitchen and clean accommodations for my trip. "
1531458,18243830,2014-08-24,17330509,Shannon,"The location and the apartment were prefect for a trip to Seattle. It is about 2 blocks from the nearest bus stop in a clean, quiet neighborhood. I would stay here again and I would recommend it to anyone looking for place to stay near UW.  "
1531458,18732859,2014-08-31,18900578,Christa,"The listing is exactly as described.  Enough space for two people to live comfortably, located in a very quiet house.  For my boyfriend and I, the location was perfect for us and the biggest selling point of the condo unit.  About a 5 minute walk to the bus station that will take you anywhere in Seattle as well as a very nice shopping and restaurant complex.  There are bike trails everywhere, so I would recommend renting bikes.  It is a fun way to get around and see beautiful scenery.  We rented bikes from Melissa, but almost wish we rented them from a bike rental company that had cyclist bikes rather than mountain bikes, as it would have been a smoother ride for us on our daily bike rides.  The only thing I would request/change from our visit was another (or few) sets of shower/bathroom towels.  Also, a little booklet would be nice that tells you about the area, what buses take you where, etc.  The condo does come with wifi (which is excellent by the way), so you certainly can look things up, but it would have been a nice little touch--especially helpful to people unfamiliar with the area.  Overall, for the price you pay, you are getting what you paid for in an awesome location of Seattle."
1531458,18902018,2014-09-02,19753532,Natalie,"It was a bit hard to find the house, especially at night. After dealing with some uncleanliness issues, Melissa had them taken care of very quickly. She was nice and timely. The house was a great deal and the price is appropriate. I had a little higher expectations based on previous reviews, but I was satisfied nevertheless. "
1531458,22803623,2014-11-15,22981685,Juliet,"Melissa was a wonderful host. The space was exactly as described, very neat and clean in a nice neighborhood. Melissa was very flexible, allowed us to change our dates with no problem, and brought over extra towels at our request. We would recommend this space to anyone. It's in a wonderful neighborhood near UW, quiet, tree-lined and close to a gorgeous park. We particularly loved the patio that has an amazing view of the UW district."
1531458,23504278,2014-12-02,12939657,Danny,Great spot just off the UW campus with all the amenities you need.
1531458,23883802,2014-12-13,5775807,David,Clean. Quiet. Close to the university. On street parking not a problem. Good value.
1531458,25991223,2015-02-01,23343723,Mari,"We had a wonderful time in Melissa's apartment. The apartment is well equipped and quite. It has a beautiful view on the large balcony/platform. We lived at her house for 1 month and it was perfect for us. It was close to shopping center and 2 minutes walk to beautiful Ravenna park, which we can highly recommend for a walk or run. We both work at the university, which is very close. We walked it everyday. 

Melissa was helpful and always replied promptly. We strongly recommend to stay at her house."
1531458,30890566,2015-04-28,8836356,John,"Melissa was a very responsive and helpful host. I would recommend her!

However, I feel that the pictures of the apartment are a bit misleading (the outside seating area is a shared space accessible from the main hall and is not part of the apartment) and the apartment is much darker than it appears in the photos. Those details aside, it is certainly livable and for the current price of $80, this is a good deal, but the building in particular is not as well kept as I anticipated. I think there are some very minor things that could be improved to make this apartment more comfortable and inviting. But there was certainly nothing wrong with our stay - and Melissa as a host and the location were both great!"
1531458,33808936,2015-06-01,31680960,Kyle,"I stayed at the remodeled unit F near the UW Campus for a month as I recently moved to Seattle and wanted to be able to go apartment shopping in person before signing a lease. Overall, the experience was good. I did not require much attention as I was primarily concerned with working and exploring the city. When I arrived the unit was clean and Melissa was quick to attend to any minor issues. The internet wouldn't connect one morning and Melissa came over and reset the wifi. No problems after that. 

The unit itself is probably best suited for 1-2 people as it is fairly small.  I enjoyed the back deck as on a clear day there is a perfect view of Mount Rainier. Close to my bus to get downtown for work but some bus lines do not come this far East. This location is literally right by campus but this street is very quiet. If you go over a few blocks on a Friday or Saturday you might hear a frat party, but you don't hear anything at this building. I think there are 4-6 units in this building but I never heard the neighbors either. University village shopping center is a 5 minute walk and is a very nice outdoor mall. Has many stores and restaurants. 

If I wasn't concerned with finding a permanent place of my own and settling in I would stay here again. "
1531458,40428974,2015-07-31,30529623,Mary Nell,"The location here is terrific -- easy access to I-5, and within easy walking distance to a beautiful park, bike path, and restaurants and shopping. 

The place is nice too. The overall size is comfortable and easy. I stayed during a heat wave and it got very, very hot, but there was a fan that helped. The shower is a bit small, but perfectly functional. The freezer is on its last legs and didn't work very well, but if you don't need frozen food you'll be fine. Those are really the only drawbacks to this place, and the location more than makes up for them. Melissa was a responsive and kind host.

Overall a very pleasant 2-month stay. Thanks!"
1531458,41126091,2015-08-04,38399955,Vincent,"Melissa's place was just as advertised: a nice, comfortable one bedroom in a popular neighborhood(close to U-district). The room was clean and tidy when I arrived and everything was as expected. I spent most of my time outdoors but whenever I was back I feel welcomed at home. Melissa was also very accommodating and allowed me to checkout a couple of hours later than agreed upon."
1531458,41628825,2015-08-08,36994459,Peggy,Very convenient location.  Very easy to get to where we were going
1531458,42545492,2015-08-14,37048348,Jane,The remodeled Walk to UW/View was accurate.  Three of us fit nicely into the unit.  It was very clean and adequately supplied.  The deck was a lovely amenity with a gorgeous view.  The price was great for the area.  Interstate 5 made access to the nearby attractions easy.  Very quiet neighborhood.  Melissa was a wonderful host.
1531458,43105220,2015-08-17,39167250,Lisa,"The pictures do not accurately represent this apartment.  It's Ok for one night, but uncomfortable for more than that.  The building is old and dirty, good location in a student area and walking distance to shopping and the university.  The best thing was that the host allowed us to check out late since we had a late flight.  The overall price including cleaning and Air BNB fees was quite high.  The bed was uncomfortable and difficult to crawl into in the tiny ""bedroom"" created out of a studio apartment with thin paneling.  The shower/bath was uncomfortable and ancient, with so little water that a real shower wasn't really possible.  Had trouble getting information about how to check in and use wifi.  The wifi didn't work very well - had to sign up with an external provider and was very limited in time allowed without paying extra.  There was supposed to be an online manual to the place, but I couldn't ever find it on air bnb. "
1531458,47707009,2015-09-21,39520225,Shelley,"Melissa was very accommodating and responsive. I even left something in the flat and she was helpful in arrangements to get it back to me.

The flat itself is in a great location. That alone was well worth the price. The kitchen is fully functional and has everything you need. As others have mentioned, the space, and in particular the bathroom, is quite small. It is fine for a single person or couple, but the bedroom is tiny and has no real privacy. The bed is quite comfortable though. While the building's entrance hall and the bathroom could use a remodel, the rest of the flat is in very good condition and clean."
6448099,40765751,2015-08-02,36454749,Marsha,"This property was all we hoped for and more! Clean, comfortable, perfectly suited for the four of us who stayed there. Easy to walk to restaurants and shopping and just a bit further walk to the beach (we did all of that and more). Will definitely try to stay here again during our next trip to the area!"
