The highway is right outside the building so if you're super sensitive to road noise it might not be the place for you, but we all are city dwellers and barely noticed it.

The apartment is in walking distance from downtown, and the neighborhood it is in is really fabulous - close to a few great coffee shops, bars, restaurants, etc.  

Miranda was great as a hostess, though I didn't meet her - their friend Bobby met us at the apartment to give us keys and situate us, and immediately we felt welcome and ""at home.""  

This was the first Airbnb experience for all 3 of us, and we'll definitely be using it again!  Only wish I had a reason to go back to Seattle soon so I could stay here again."
1601714,16762246,2014-08-02,3714055,Stefanie,"Everything went well...Great nighbourhood, everything was in walking distance.
The Place was clean and well equipped.
Unfortunatelly no Aircon and seattle is really hot in the end of july.
And if you like a quiet Place and open windows, there is the main highway directly under your balcony....but the complex itsself is quiet and a safe and clean place.
We were travelling with our toddler and there were no problems and an elevator for easy access.
People in Capitol Hill were Kidfriendly.
We liked the alternative area, its Restaurants and the wading Pool in volunteer park...Great Place for picknick!
Miranda was a great host and took carte of us!

Very comfortable and well equipped with full kitchen, laundry, gym facilities, roof deck.

Highly recommended :-)"
7350870,42920127,2015-08-16,21676409,Roger,"James was very easy and pleasant to deal with. This nice apartment is in a great location with a wonderful view. When we weren't out walking to nearby restaurants and shops, it was very pleasant just to watch the ferries, sailboats and big ships out on the bay. The apartment had everything we needed. We really enjoyed our stay!"
7350870,43964771,2015-08-23,31603677,Deborah,"James was amazing and always available:)  The apartment was beautifully appointed, clean, and cozy.  They even went out of their way to provide L'Occitane products, a very nice touch!

We wanted a view of the harbor and what a view they have!  Beautiful!  Overlooking Seattle's famous ferris wheel, beautifully lit at night, and the international port of Seattle.  Truly a treat for anyone landlocked at home.  It also had a small deck to view the evening sunset."
7350870,44836377,2015-08-29,4939561,Judith,The apartment was fantastic!  A great location and view and very clean and well appointed. James was very accommodating and responsive to all of our questions and requests. 
7350870,45605601,2015-09-04,32999020,Ricardo,"We had a great stay at James' apartment.  It is comfortable, cozy, extremely well situated and the view is stunning.  James is very helpful and responds very quickly.  I would definitely recommend staying at this lovely spot. "
7350870,48637557,2015-09-27,4446940,Todd,"Stunning views and perfectly located.
If your planning on visiting Pikes and the surrounding areas you can't get much better then this. My friend lives in Seattle and he even appreciated the location.
James was a top notch communicator and a great host.
"
7350870,52356256,2015-10-28,36243064,Tina,"Excellent place in the city. Beautiful views from the high rise apartment and such a great location. Out the door and around the corner to many of Seattle's fun locations. We were walking distance to Pike Place, the Aquarium and the Museum as well as much more we did not get to visit. The apartment was very clean and nicely decorated. Everything was as described in the listing. So many great restaurants and attractions right within walking distance. James was super to communicate with and handled everything with patience and professionalism. We would definitely recommend. The bed was SO comfortable! Would like to make a longer trip next time just to sleep in that bed. Thank you for hosting us James. Can not wait to return. "
7350870,52889228,2015-11-02,46512468,Paul,"My wife and I were in Seattle for our Anniversary, and James made the entire experience a breeze.  He buzzed us up once we arrived on site, the door was unlocked, and the keys were on the counter.

James was always a quick message away anytime we had a question, or needed a recommendation.  The view truly is spectacular, the place is very spacious, was perfectly clean, and has a very pleasant decor. 

The location is amazing, you are literally steps away from many major attractions and conveniences.  Truly the perfect spot to explore Seattle, we even spent quite a few evenings in Belltown, and even that was no more than a ten minute walk away."
7350870,53579997,2015-11-09,4957797,Michele,"James made the check in easy.  The apartment was clean and delightful, in a perfect location for exploring Seattle.  "
7350870,56332865,2015-12-12,48501506,Jeremy,"          Step into this wonderfully roomy sanctuary! We enjoyed this large one-bedroom home space while visiting Seattle for our anniversary vacation. We stayed for 4 days and didn't want to leave. 

          Tall above the hustle and bustle of the city you'll find this centrally-located and cleanly apartment in the Harbor Steps. It is so centrally located in Downtown on 1st and Western, that we were able to walk anywhere in downtown with ease. We walked to the Sculpture Park, SafeCo Field, the Space Needle, the Living Computer Museum, Columbia Tower and MORE. This place is the center of every great restaurant and bar in Seattle, too.

          The apartment is complete with a large TV, which we enjoyed Christmas music from during our mornings with cups of coffee. Although we spent the majority of our time touring Seattle by foot, this place was an amazing place to rest our heads before beginning our next venture in the city the following day. 

          The bathroom is so clean and accommodating. There is a washer and dryer in the unit, which helps when you need to dry your coat after being rained-on. 

           We didn't do much cooking, but the kitchen is full and complete with utensils, cups, and an oven/dishwasher/fridge of course. The fridge came in handy for storing our local beers we picked up. :)

          Overall, the classy and clean place is outstanding! Don't miss the opportunity to stay here if you can. The location makes it all worth while, and the comfortable and clean nature of the apartment makes it even harder to leave!"
1928010,9388973,2013-12-25,9472396,Ron,"Fantastic!  Robert's house is beautiful, clean and spotless, and quite a luxurious, homey residence.  I truly felt comfortable there, and its furnished so tastefully and solidly that I felt like I was in a classic hotel or inn. :) Robert was exceptionally patient and flexible with my situation - I moved to Seattle in a hurry from NYC, with 3 siamese cats in tow!  I had to get to Seattle faster than planned due to a real estate opportunity, and he accepted my request for a reservation with my 3 cats coming alone at the last minute without any trouble at all.  I was respectful of his lovely home and felt a sense of duty to keep the place looking great even if it weren't for the extreme kindness and flexibility that Robert showed in my situation - and I was his FIRST AirBnB guest EVER!  

Would definitely stay again in this spectacular home - safe and quiet, beautiful neighborhood and in a really prime area of Capitol Hill; short walk to the beautiful QFC grocery store on Broadway, as well as many buses to get you around Seattle.  Definitely book this home with full confidence!  "
1928010,10169823,2014-02-03,7810158,Shanna,"Robert's house is as cute as it looks in the photo, and he is a friendly, accommodating guy, who has lived in the neighborhood a long time.  We relaxed in his living room watching an old movie after a day on Bainbridge Island, used his nice kitchen to make cocktails and snacks, went out to dinner downtown, and slept well in his tidy, extra bedroom with bath/shower. With his parking pass, parking was no problem in tightly packed Capitol Hill. We will return.  Thanks Robert!"
1928010,10249192,2014-02-09,9858004,C. Titus,"Very clean, warm, nice furnishings, wonderful location.  Nothing to complain about and many things to like!  Robert was an excellent host and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay."
1928010,10680651,2014-03-03,3234523,Denver,"Lovely house/suite in a great neighborhood.  Sweet tree-lined blocks just up the hill from downtown . . .  slept soundly here during a busy conference weekend . . . and LOVED the cafes and restaurants nearby.

Robert was helpful, accommodating, respectful,  and clear.

I would not hesitate to contact Robert again in the future for perhaps even a longer stay."
1928010,10779162,2014-03-07,5670435,Gino,"Rob's home is beautiful... My dream home! He has fantastic taste in decor and color choice. I really enjoyed my stay.

The bedroom was so comfortable with the nicest pillows. The bathroom and shower are gorgeous, done in marble and subway tiles with a large shower. The kitchen is so amazing. And it was nice to have access to a washer/dryer.

The location is great! Very peaceful and residential yet just a short bus ride into the city. The bus stop is 1 block from the house and makes frequent stops throughout the day. Takes about 15 min to get to the Public Market. Beautiful Volunteer Park is a short walk through the Capitol Hill neighborhood with stunning homes along the way.

Chico Madrid a short walk from the house. They have a great tapas menu. I also recommend this place for dinner if you're looking to stay local in the evening.

While Robert wasn't there during my stay, he facilitated an easy key pickup and was easy to communicate with via email.

I absolutely recommend Robert's place. Loved it."
1928010,10831079,2014-03-09,11210656,Jennifer,"The accommodations were beautiful and the coordination with Robert was seamless. Although Robert was out of town, he graciously made his home available to us and encouraged us to make ourselves at home. It was fun to stay on Capitol Hill to get a feeling for what it would be like living in the neighborhood and the fresh donuts across the street were delicious! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay at Robert's home again :)"
1928010,10943717,2014-03-14,11997997,Ray,"This was our first experience and really enjoyed our first visit to Seattle!
Robert has done a very pleasant update to his home in a very good location to what you need to see and do in the city and surrounds.
Although he was out of town his communication and hospitality were top notch.
His home will definitely be on our list to return.
The bedroom and generous shower were very comfortable and a lot of nice touches to the whole house were appreciated."
1928010,11162354,2014-03-23,2672562,Ellen,"We had a lovely stay at Robert's house. He was out of town when we were there but was very responsive over email making check in and out easy breezy. The house/room itself is very lovely and comfortable. I always enjoy staying in Capitol Hill when in Seattle and this part of the neighborhood is quiet, but not far from many great restaurants and bars. My husband was thrilled that there is a donut shop just a block away. My only regret was that we only stayed one night. "
1928010,11245801,2014-03-26,2716578,Hubert,"My wife and I recently stayed with Rob at his beautiful place in Capitol Hill.  Quiet, well kept, clean, and very centrally located, it was perfect for us and comes highly recommended for us.  Moreover, Rob is a very personable, understanding and knowledgable host and makes you feel at home.  Very highly recommended, will be staying with him again!"
1928010,11274924,2014-03-27,7965213,Sierra,"Robert was very nice! He was very accommodating and had a quick turn-around time between the guest staying before us and our arrival. His house is in a convenient spot to walk around Seattle, and the room was nicely set up."
1928010,11384252,2014-03-31,980788,Poulomi,"Rob's house is in a great location, the house itself is very clean and well-kept and he's a great host.

The only downside was, the room we were given was different from the one who's photos were uploaded with the listing at that time. So I was quite disappointed because the room in the picture looked gorgeous but the one we were assigned was at the back of the house and very cramped. When I shared this concern with Rob, he offered us a spare room to use for our luggage, and I see that he has also corrected the photos on the listing since then.

I was just disappointed with my stay because it was my birthday weekend and I was expecting a really nice room based on the listing (at that time), but I wasn't happy with the room I actually got."
1928010,11542064,2014-04-07,12614846,Quentin,"Staying in Robert's home has been my first airbnb experience, and it's been great.  I was able to make all arrangements with minimal fuss and Robert responded immediately to the few necessary emails.  The house is great, clean, bright, comfortable, charming and with modern conveniences where I like them, i.e. kitchen and bathroom.  An extra bonus was tons of closet space so I didn't have to look at my ""stuff"" in the room.  I loved roaming around the neighbourhood which is loaded with charm and endless possibilities for coffee, dining, drinking etc.  It's also an easy walk downtown.  All in all I would highly recommend staying at Robert's.
"
1928010,11704615,2014-04-12,9840145,Amy,"This was our first Airbnb experience and we loved it!  Great host, wonderful home, great neightborhood.  Thanks!"
1928010,11784762,2014-04-14,1822776,Brooke,"SO sorry about leaving the door unlocked - total accident! LOVED our stay - house is beautiful, location is perfect and host was always reachable.  Thanks so much - will stay again!!"
1928010,11888159,2014-04-18,5814571,Matthew,"Rob was very pleasant and responsive.  He made arrangements for us to get into the house when we arrived, even though he was traveling at the time.  The classic house has been nicely restored and is comfortable, clean, and inviting.  Rob's place is convenient to Capitol Hill businesses and eateries, and is near several city bus stops.  The bedroom/bath suite was perfect for us as we used it for a home base as we visited around Seattle.  Rob was a pleasant host, but left us to ourselves, which suited our style exactly.  We had a great visit and the Airbnb lodging was a large factor."
1928010,12122898,2014-04-23,13000788,Deborah,"I had a very comfortable stay.  The bed and bath suite was very pleasant, clean and roomy.  Robert was helpful about the surrounding neighborhood which is active and fun.  

This was my first time using airbnb and I was a little concerned about being in a strangers home and sharing some of the common spaces.  It proved to be absolutely fine. I would definitely book this accommodation again.

The only issue I had was having to find street parking when I returned at night.  Robert does provide a parking pass but sometimes I could only find a space a few blocks away."
1928010,12206206,2014-04-26,2384946,Jas,"Robert is a very nice host. The house is clean, tidy and located in good location.
Walking distance to downtown and my favorite place ""Pike Place Market"". Only a few
mins walk to Broadway where has a lot of restaurants and bar . "
1928010,12295654,2014-04-28,8441577,Alyssa,"I had a wonderful weekend in Seattle, renting Rob's room. The location was excellent (especially for a first time visitor), the room was clean and inviting, and Rob was a great host. He was communicative and had some great recommendations."
1928010,13252150,2014-05-23,4667043,Katie,"There are so many great things about this house in Capitol Hill.  Location is excellent with lots of shops, grocery, bars, coffee shop all within walking distance.  The room is comfortable and private & the bed is dreamy.  Robert is a very gracious host & went out of his way to make sure that I was comfortable.  There are a few things that future renters should be aware of however -- there was some pretty massive construction starting around the house when I was there (May 2014) and I'm not sure how long it will last - there were several workmen around the house and they are just feet outside the windows/doors; as Robert mentions he works from home so you probably won't feel like you have the house to yourself very much; the internet in the bedroom that you are renting does not work very well though it works great in other parts of the house.  Overall, if you come in aware of the above-mentioned things, you should be very happy.  You will be in a very comfortable room with a spacious bathroom and you will have a very friendly and inviting host!"
1928010,13469498,2014-05-28,12958263,Matt,"Wonderful place with great decor and in a nice neighborhood (short walk to restaurants and public transit). Rob was very accommodating with check-in and check-out, plus easy to work with when we requested a second room. I'd definitely stay here again if I make it back to Seattle!"
1928010,13882374,2014-06-07,9148447,Jeff,"Robert is a terrific host and made us feel at home.  It's a lovely house in a terrifically walkable neighborhood.  There was some construction going on during the day which was noisy but I was warned before I checked in and said it wouldn't be an issue.  The home was very clean, kitchen very usable and higher end.  There was a problem in the laundry room which prevented use but this didn't impact me and it's being fixed."
1928010,14084578,2014-06-11,14617278,Ellen And Thor,"Robert was a most gracious host, helpful when needed, but not intrusive.  His home has been beautifully restored and is nicely furnished.  Capitol Hill is a convenient location, a mix of students and professionals, with casual gathering places nearby for food and drink.  We didn't think about the long staircase to the front door in terms of our heavy suitcases, but we managed.  Lots of closet space and a small dresser, wonderful bath w/2 sinks and large walk-in shower.  We had full use of the kitchen; Robert even bought a new non-stick frying pan when I complained about the one he had!  A small market is a block away. NOTE:  Side and rear decks are under construction, tho no work was done during our stay.  It will be noisy  and dusty when they're working."
1928010,14234821,2014-06-15,9445254,Kelli,"We had an excellent stay at Rob's Capitol Hill home. His house is in an awesome neighborhood and is an easy walk or bus ride to downtown Seattle and the surrounding neighborhoods. The space he has to offer is perfect. We loved having our own bathroom and having it connected to our room was even better. We also enjoyed resting our feet and relaxing in the TV bedroom. An A+ spot, we'd stay again!"
1928010,14347203,2014-06-17,2632890,Larry,"I'm somewhat hesitant to leave a review--for selfish reasons... I want to come back again and if I provide the review Rob's place deserves it would be booked months in advance :-).

Well, it is in one of the best hoods in Seattle. You can park your car and forget about it. Everything you need is blocks away.

The house is cute, Rob's a great guy. The master bedroom is soooo comfortable. Great shower. Nice TV and good enough bed in the TV room.

All was well. 

One caution, which Rob will certainly flag; there will be big construction going on next to the house for a number of months. This may, or may not be a big deal, as construction usually happens durning the day when you're out drinking coffee, milling about in local book stores, or browsing vintage clothes shops. "
1928010,14511093,2014-06-21,9964070,Maxine,"Robert, our host, is charming, intelligent and helpful.  The home is tastefully decorated, clean and comfortable.  Kitchen is fully equipped but who wants to cook??  The house is located close to amenities (coffee shop half a block away, public transit one block away, restaurants within walking distance, downtown within walking distance, charming neighbourhood).  It should be mentioned, however, that there is construction going on around the house, detracting from the exterior.  That being said, we weren't bothered by noise or dust, as we were absent during the day.   Our overall experience was very positive and I would highly recommend this listing."
1928010,14644357,2014-06-23,325828,Quinten,Robert was a friendly host and very easy to work with. The house is in a great location!
1928010,14879853,2014-06-28,16464040,Sara,"This was my first time using Airbnb and I had a great experience staying in Roberts house.  The accommodations are as they appear in the photos and the home is very clean.  Capitol hill is a really fun neighborhood with restaurants/bars within a few minutes walking distance.  Robert gave us the great tip to walk on our way to downtown, as its all down hill, and then take the bus back up.  There is a bus line with a stop close to the house that will drop you off/pick up right by Pike Place Market and lots of other touristy things.  By using public transportation we found the location to work really well for exploring Seattle without a car. It was super easy to arrange our stay with Robert and he promptly responded to all emails.  I would stay at Roberts again. "
1928010,15255050,2014-07-06,9517665,Jane,"We had a fabulous stay at Robert's wonderful place in the heart of Capitol Hill, Seattle. Everything was exactly as described. The bedroom and bed were comfortable, the bathroom and shower were exceptional. The linens and towels were more than adequate. The common spaces were wonderful, clean, and very homey. Robert was great with communication. He checked in regularly both before our arrival and during our time at his place. The parking pass was a great addition as parking on Capitol Hill can be difficult. We never had a problem given the pass that Robert allowed us to use. All in all we had a fabulous stay in a wonderful home in a fabulous neighborhood. We will be back."
1928010,15446071,2014-07-09,1664254,Ryan And Nicole,"Our 3 night stay in Roberts home was wonderful. Very clean and comfortable. Great location- walkable to many restaurants, bars, coffee shops, etc. Although we didn't get to meet Robert because he was out of town, communication was very easy and prompt. Thanks for a great stay!"
1928010,15649871,2014-07-13,705435,Jesse,"Robert was a great host, friendly but non-intrusive, and his place is immaculate and comfortable. The location is also ideal, in a quiet corner of the neighborhood that's nonetheless a quick walk to the busier parts.

I normally prefer to stay in places where I'm not sharing with the host, but I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
1928010,15814874,2014-07-16,13800473,Val,"Robert was a welcoming host who communicated well. Sadly the property is a building site front & back at present, but this didn't bother us as we were there over the weekend.
The accommodation was good and the place was clean.
Pleasant neighborhood with good eateries nearby."
1928010,16015662,2014-07-20,16249214,Martin,Robert was a great host and made me feel welcome and comfortable in his home.
1928010,16059547,2014-07-21,4153973,Seb,"Great place - very clean, beds are comfortable, and the bath & shower very nice. Rob even let us check in early which was a nice gesture. It was a short trip (one night only), but a comfortable one  - Thanks Rob! "
1928010,16122613,2014-07-22,6379548,Felicia,"Robert was a delightful host. He was very helpful with information. The house is meticulously kept and the room and bathroom are spotless, comfortable, and Robert provided all the little touches that made our stay very enjoyable. 

The neighborhood is quiet, safe and very convenient. The only problem is street parking can be challenging at night. The property right behind Robert's is undergoing some construction right now and the workmen can start before 8am. If you are an early riser or a very sound sleeper, that should be no problem. I don't think the construction will go on for too much longer also. "
1928010,16328816,2014-07-25,10715251,Simon,"I was in town for work, and Robert's home was a close walk to my office in South Lake Union.  The house was really clean and also a short walk to a street filled with restaurants.  A good place to stay whether you're in town for work or play."
1928010,16886156,2014-08-04,13890644,Aileen,"The location was perfect for our stay!  This was our first time to Seattle and we had a fantastic week.  We had a delayed arrival into Seattle and our host, Rob, was very accommodating with our late arrival.  Lovely house, clean and updated, it didn't disappoint!  When we had questions about the area, Rob was very helpful.  The house was close to some great restaurants and fun shopping.  There is some construction going on, but it didn't bother us, as we were up and out the door most mornings.  Plus when the construction is completed, it will provide an awesome outdoor space to relax with morning coffee or after a busy day of checking out the sites.  I'm sure we will be back to Seattle, and would love to go back and see how the projects turned out! "
1928010,17019480,2014-08-05,2364412,Evan,"My wife and I had a lovely stay at Robert's home in Seattle in early August, 2014. The private suite was pricey by AirBnB standards ($144 total, fees included), but location was phenomenal and the home gorgeous. We had absolutely no problems with access, and the unit was exactly as described, including a handy parking pass. There was construction going on in front and back about which Robert had alerted us prior to our arrival; not too noisy, but probably wouldn't have been able to sleep in on Monday morning. 

The only downside is that there is no A/C in the suite, though there is a nice fan and we slept fine as the daytime heat receded. "
1928010,17342813,2014-08-11,869972,Kris,"Robert's cute house is in a fabulous location. Capitol Hill is, by far, the best neighborhood in Seattle. You can catch the bus one block away and upon return, it will drop you close to the front door. The guest bed is comfy and the bathroom is newly remodeled and more than adequate.  Robert himself is also very pleasant and considerate. This listing is one of the better ones on this site. Enjoy your time in Seattle. Oh, and while you are there, don't forget to check out Mamnoon. It's delicious."
1928010,17528365,2014-08-13,18815721,Charlotte,"We had a great 2 nights at Rob's house in Seattle. The suite was amazing- far more than I imagined from the website. The bed was very comfy and the bathroom was just like a posh hotel! :) Rob was flexible about our arrival, and was friendly and helpful. The house is in a great location, with lots of cool bars and restaurants a very short walk away, and a great coffee and donut shop on the street! I would highly recommend staying at Rob's if you are going to Seattle- we loved it."
1928010,17679562,2014-08-16,16297875,Caitlin,"We had a wonderful stay at Robert's home.  It was conveniently located in Capital Hill and we enjoyed walking around the city.  The suite is very comfortable, and homey, but also tastefully decorated.  Robert is a friendly and helpful host!

Highly recommended for exploring the beautiful city of Seattle.  "
1928010,18180396,2014-08-23,17617865,Sarah,"This was my first stay with AirBnB, and it was wonderful.  Robert's home was perfect for us in every way. The location was an easy walk to many authentic, locally-owned restaurants, and even walkable to downtown.  If you're not a walker, you can always take the bus straight there. I felt very safe in his neighborhood. My mom and I are quite petite, and were completely comfortable here.  Robert is the perfect host. He's friendly, knowledgable, and an excellent communicator. His home is gorgeous and perfectly clean.  There was some construction going on behind his house, but he warned us about it, and it was never a problem. The workers always started after we were up and were gone long before we came home for the night. Thank you for a lovely stay, Rob. If we ever come back to Seattle you'll be the first person we try to book with. "
1928010,18295438,2014-08-25,10622378,Patsy,"We ended a 10 day long vacation around the Olympic Peninsula in Seattle, and had a most enjoyable 2-night stay at Rob's beautifully decorated and and conveniently located home.  The bedroom and bath were lovely ,  and it was a real plus to have the second private room available to watch TV at the end of a couple of very active days.  
Rob was a friendly and most helpful host, and was flexible with our uncertain arrival time the first night.  He provided a parking permit for the street in front of his house and it wasn't difficult to find a space.   He gave us two nearby neighborhood restaurant suggestions which were outstanding (The Skillet Diner and Correttos).  Capital Hill is a charming neighborhood and we walked everywhere, including downtown and back, even though the bus was available.  All in all it was a perfect ending to a most enjoyable trip, and I would highly recommend staying there.  We hope to be back one day.  Thanks Rob!"
1928010,18659842,2014-08-30,1429752,Matt,"I stayed four nights at Robert's house, and it was a perfect experience. Robert was an excellent host whose neighborhood knowledge helped me find great local spots close by and around the rest of Seattle. The suite was immaculate: clean, spacious, and beautifully decorated. The same goes for the rest of his house. I greatly enjoyed my stay and would recommend staying with Robert to anyone who wants to explore Seattle from a local's perspective."

1928010,18980317,2014-09-04,9478909,Christina,"We enjoyed staying at Rob's place! It was very clean and he was very helpful and friendly when we arrived, super accommodating. He let us drop our luggage off early before our check in time and held it for us after we checked out as we had a late evening flight. The kitchen is well stocked with cooking necessities, although we barely used it since we were out with friends and family the majority of our stay. We were also offered a parking pass, but didn't need it as we did not have a car. Rob did warn us about the construction behind the house, we didn't even noticed it during our stay. We loved the bathroom and extra tv room. Again, Rob was a great guy! We hope Rob's house is available next time we visit Seattle! Also- location is great and convenient and the place  was EXACTLY as described in the listing!"
1928010,19149039,2014-09-07,20073305,Andrea,"Staying at Robert's was very comfortable, clean and private and in a very interesting neighborhood."

He resides in a great neighborhood in Seattle."
1928010,19430800,2014-09-12,20539782,Sotheavy,"Rob was a gracious host. He allowed my friend and I to stay in two rooms (the master and an adjacent room), and we shared the master bath. His house was lovely, modern and clean as well as very nicely located in Capitol Hill. 

At the time we stayed (9/9/14), there was some construction behind the house on the same lot, plus some construction in the basement of the home. There were bars and restaurants within a block or two in any direction, and a bustling Broadway was a few more blocks away.

I wouldn't hesitate to stay in his house again if I were in need of lodging in the Seattle area."

1928010,20024998,2014-09-22,19688771,Taryn,"The home itself was charming and centrally located to everything in Capitol Hill. Our host, Robert, was easygoing - answering whatever questions we had about the stay, and even a few about seattle. In all, a wonderful experience, even down to the linens!"
1928010,20126828,2014-09-23,8555121,Karen,"short stay so not enough time to enjoy this charming home in the awesome cap hill neighborhood.  however, it had everything we needed.  comfortable bed, great shower, nice bedding & linens.  included parking pass (street parking) was handy.  (FYI, this home would not be appropriate for mobility impaired guests.)  communication was swift and easy.  Rob accommodated our schedule and was a great host.  highly recommended!"
1928010,20238049,2014-09-26,298870,Aaron,"This was a beautiful place to stay and just as amazing as the photos. Rob was a great host that made sure I knew were things was. I was in town to meet some friends, have a few business meetings and generally check out the city. It's a nice safe area and great little shops right down the street."

It's situated in a really ideal spot -- within a quiet neighborhood, but walking distance from many amazing food & coffee spots. Broadway (a fun avenue full of retail, pubs, and restaurants) is right around the corner.

On top of being in a great location, the house itself is very clean, modern, and cozy. With towel service, access to laundry facilities, and our own private bath, we really felt like we were staying in a high-class bed & breakfast. I highly recommend it."

1928010,21627903,2014-10-20,21737568,Christina,"Robert is a wonderful host, he took the time to chat with us upon arrival and made us feel welcome in his home. The home is just like the photographs, there are no surprises, what you see is what you get, just great! The neighbourhood is hip, with a few great spots to have coffee, dinner or just drinks steps away from the house, this is convenient especially for those who have travelled from far."

1928010,21922545,2014-10-26,22511289,Chris,"Location, location, location, and a beautiful house! Robert was out of town during our visit, but curated a wonderful stay. His arrival instructions were helpful and clear, and the house was very clean and welcoming! Fresh towels, sheets, and chocolates on the pillows. There was some construction going on in the backyard, but we were unbothered during our weekend stay. Highly recommend!"
1928010,22103932,2014-10-30,19822481,Amy,"Robert's lovely home on Capitol Hill was the perfect spot for our stay in Seattle, while his easy going demeanor and relaxed friendliness helped us feel welcome. The location couldn't be beat, with easy access to downtown by foot, as well as tons of cafes, grocery stores, parks, restaurants, shops and resources in just a few blocks walk. Parking was not as difficult as we anticipated and the use of the extra parking pass added to our level of relaxation when returning later in the evening.

Jeff and I really appreciated the calm, clean, tasteful details that both our room and the overall house had to offer - with the addition of a super comfy bed and luxurious en suite bathroom. While it seems simple and relatively obvious, we were also grateful for little things like night stands and reading lamps on both sides of the bed, q-tips and shower soap and even chocolates left on our pillow to welcome us our first night.  

This is a great place for a couple or single person to stay in Seattle, with easy access to the best the city has to offer. We highly recommend it and look forward to our next visit."

1928010,22572128,2014-11-09,14642184,Joel,Prime location! Bed was extremely comfy. Robert was a great host and the home was sweet!
1928010,22670533,2014-11-11,23023342,Elizabeth,"Our stay at Robert's Master Suit in Capitol Hill was wonderful.  Robert makes you feel very welcome and comfortable.  His home is beautiful and walking distance to all the best shops, bars and restaurants of Capitol Hill.   Everything was meticulously clean and neat, the bed was very comfortable - soft sheets and fluffy pillows, beautiful bath towels provided. It felt like a home away from home. Nice to stay in such a welcoming home while still having our own private area upstairs. We would highly recommend and certainly plan to book again with Robert in the future.  "
1928010,23172647,2014-11-24,7594043,Larry,"The home was beautiful, and just how it was pictured in the listing. The location was great. The house is in a quieter part of Capitol Hill but still very walkable to the nightlife. My wife and I will be moving to Seattle in the near future and Rob gave us a lot of great recommendations/info on the city and its various neighborhoods."
1928010,23319703,2014-11-29,20347843,Doris,Rob made us feel welcome and at home and was immediately responsive to any needs that came up.  Comfortable and very clean.  A perfect location for us.
1928010,24111420,2014-12-20,12934633,Ryan,"Robert provided detailed instructions for arrival and locks, so I had an easy time getting in.  The neighborhood is great-Capitol Hill has great views of the city throughout.  Finding a parking sport wasn't a problem--only once did I have to hunt, but it was late at night so that was to be expected.

The house is very well appointed and has everything you would need for a stay in Seattle.  The bedroom upstairs was simple and the bed was very comfortable!  I slept well--neighborhood stays pretty quiet too.  The bathroom was nice, clean and plenty of towels, etc.

Most of my time at the house was spent showering & sleeping, as I was in work mode.  I would stay again in the master suite and hope to someday soon--for vacation next time.  I definitely would recommend staying here if you are headed to (website hidden): There is a new restaurant on Summit, right next to Top Pot Doughnuts called Single Shot...I had the pork chop--it was seriously amazing food!!"
1928010,25386048,2015-01-14,14948838,Kevin,"Robert has a very nice house in an awesome location. Three bars and a coffee shop within a block, but they don't disturb your sleep. 
Nice room with a comfy bed. I slept very well. 
This is a perfect Capitol Hill location if you are visiting or on the go."
1928010,25698921,2015-01-23,26228510,Monique,"The home is very welcoming!  The space is wonderful and very well equipped. Robert was very responsive to any questions we had.
We would certainly stay again and recommend it to others."

Great water pressure in the bathrooms, and it's in an unbeatable neighborhood. Anything we wanted or needed during our stay was within walking distance... and none of it is an ugly jaunt. Big plus.
We had to alter our reservation once, and bombarded Robert with a million-and-one questions leading up to our stay, all of which he handled quickly and with grace - really appreciate that."

1928010,27888197,2015-03-14,92019,Grace,"This is a lovely set of suites in a beautifully appointed home on Capitol Hill. I stayed in ""Suite B"", a cozy yet adequately spacious and private bedroom with an en suite shower/toilet/double sink. As a single, active grandma who enjoys solo travel, I felt perfectly safe and secure given Robert's locks and deadbolts on both the front and back doors. In fact, security was such that I locked myself out of my bathroom! Unfortunately, I couldn't pick the lock (with Robert's permission) and needed to call a local locksmith who opened the door with a special screwdriver. Thus, be careful with locking yourself out of the loo! Robert is an energy conscious homeowner and maintains the interior temperature in the mid 60s. If you're an easily chilled tropical Californian such as myself, do pack some sweat pants and a sweater while visiting during the cooler seasons in Seattle. Robert provided helpful details in accessing his home, finding your way around in the house, instructions for leaving and information for parking (along with a parking permit). Lightening fast wifi, as well1 The suite was an astonishing deal and I would return as a solo traveller again. Thanks Robert!"
1928010,28149832,2015-03-18,29183215,Jeremy,"From the very beginning, as my friend and I were planning our trip, Robert was communicative and helpful. As the trip neared, my friend had to back out due to work, and I had to change some of the details of my stay. Robert made this process painless, too. 

Thanks to his thorough communication, I knew everything necessary to find the place and get situated once there. 

The room was great and exactly as described. Super comfortable bed (I want the duvet cover--it took a lot of restraint not to tuck it away in my bag, though I'm not sure it would have fit) and stylish decor. As I had most of the home to myself for several days, I couldn't have asked for more privacy and amenities. 

Highly recommended, especially as an easy way to explore Capitol Hill and nearby neighborhoods. 

Thanks, Robert!
Jeremy"
1928010,28470580,2015-03-24,10577713,Jd,"Robert was a fantastic host. He was very thorough with all of the coordinating, and provided a clean and comfortable place to stay. We enjoyed the neighborhood, and the location was very convenient for walking. I'd definitely recommend it! "

1928010,29788207,2015-04-12,27906626,Christian,What a beautiful home. My coworker had the bed and I got the futon in the TV room. Slept great. 
1928010,30197425,2015-04-19,13350411,Ashley,Robert is a super nice guy. We appreciated that his instructions were thorough so we really didn't have to bother him and ask a bunch of questions. There is some construction on the property but despite that we found the room & neighborhood to be quiet and lovely. It's very walkable & easy to get to public transportation as well. All in all it was a pleasure and we'd definitely look into staying with Robert again when in the area next time. 
1928010,30476226,2015-04-22,16502986,Nick,"Nothing but positive things to say here. Great host, great house, great location. I had a last minute business trip and it was incredibly quick/easy to work with Robert. 

House: I was in Master Suite B and there were other guests in the house, but I never knew they were there. I would see Robert a few times on my way in/out and it was nice to check in. 

Parking: I had a rental car and found parking in front of the house for four days with no problem. Grabbed the permit when I got there and was good to go.

Getting around: Perfect area for strolls. Top Pot coffee and Sun Liquor are literally right across the street. Great for catching up on work or people watching with a well-crafted cocktail. Also recommend Taylor Shellfish and Mamnoon for dinner nearby.

Thanks for the great stay, Robert! I felt at home and like I didn't have to worry about anything."
1928010,30705953,2015-04-26,3721933,Kevin,"I loved my room at Robert's place. Comfortable bed, private and lovely bathroom.

Thank you Rob for a lovely stay."

Robert greeted us and we chatted up the goings on in the city, I felt like I was staying with a buddy. The room upstairs was beautifully decorated, I slept great in the comfy bed and enjoyed a morning shower in the 5 star bathroom. A few steps away from Top Pot Doughnuts, I would love to stay again soon at this gem in cap hill. "

This was our first stay at an airbnb and it was a pleasent surprise. Robert was friendly and helpful, we felt right at home. The room was clean and quiet and the marble bathroom was a treat. 

Capitol Hill is an interesting neighbourhood. We were able to go to stores and restaurants without using the car."

There is nothing he hasn't considered to ensure his guests have a comfortable and enjoyable stay. He has a beautiful home, great coffee, the most beautiful bathroom !! and close proximity to a couple of nice places to eat. We'll stay there again the next time we're in Seattle.   "
1928010,33133174,2015-05-25,24756630,Jenny,Very happy with accommodation .Bathroom ensuite very handy. Location good for us. A bit of a challenge with the construction going on as not having WiFi did not get host's email.  Overall very comfortable with eveyhing a traveller requires for a stay.

Huge shower and lots of space. Crossed paths with Rob once and he gave us some great recommendations for some places to eat. Will stay here again next time we visit! 
1928010,34221392,2015-06-06,32920181,Kathleen,"My sister and I recently stayed at Roberts place and loved it!  Robert was a great host!  We crossed paths with him once during our two night stay and he was very welcoming.  The house was very clean and comfortable and is walking distance to great bars, restaurants and shops.  We really enjoyed the Capitol Hill area.  There was another guest staying in the second master suite on the same level as us but we didn't ever see them or hear them.  I would recommend this place to anyone!"
1928010,34373463,2015-06-07,8609662,Dorothy,Great neighborhood.  Meticulously kept house.  Robert made sure that I understood how to get in but I never actually met him.  It was surprisingly quiet.  Very nice.  
1928010,34424147,2015-06-08,13325205,Luisa,"We had a horrifying experience here.  Seattle was unusually hot and the room had only one window which did not stay open.  My parents are elderly and could not tolerate the heat so I contacted the host explaining the situation and apologizing for the need to cancel the remaining nights on the reservation.  The host responded with pretty unkind words which escalated in hostility even though I had no more interaction with him. The txts continued to escalate using increasingly foul language until around 3:30 am..  I'm not shy about using a 4 letter word occasionally but I have to say these were the kind of words one never ever ever says. 'nuff said on that.  Because of the increasing hostility, I called my parents at 1:45 am, waking them up to find out if everything was ok.  While I was on the phone with my father the host broke into my parents room and lunged at my 80 year old  father yelling at him to get out.  I could hear all of this over the phone. My parents feared he was dangerous and asked me to call the police.   They were able to push him out of the room and lock him out and waited until the police arrived to escort them out. This is an excerpt of the police report:  ""Subject Frederickson was identified as the owner of the B&B. Frederickson let
me into his home/ B&B. Frederickson told me that he had been out drinking all
night with friends and that he was intoxicated. I could smell a strong odor of
alcohol coming from him as we spoke. He told me that he arrived at his house
and found the couple in the rented room. He then attempted to explain why he
had told the couple to leave but he had a hard time forming sentences that made
sense. He repeatedly told me that he ran an ""Air B&B"" and that the couple did
not belong. I told Fredrickson that the couple did belong and that they had
keys to the property and had the code to enter the home. Frederickson
eventually became uncooperative with me and said that he thought I was against
him.
We assisted the couple in leaving the home.""    

On the upside, Airbnb and the police were amazing, taking good care of my folks and making sure that they landed in a safe and comfortable hotel after what they went through.  I'm deeply grateful to both of them for that. "
1928010,34805351,2015-06-12,31241858,Daniel,"Staying at Rob's was great. He's easy to talk to and made sure we had everything we needed in the rooms. The house looked great and the area was simple to navigate and really convenient. Overall great experience, I'd definitely recommend it.  "
1928010,35400836,2015-06-18,8634157,Ian,Robert's home is beautiful! It's about 15 minutes away from Seattle attractions like the Space Needle and the Olympic Sculpture park. We had a wonderful time and loved staying at Rob's house. 
1928010,35573498,2015-06-20,8134964,Claire,"Very beautiful old house feel with modern amenities and solid construction that has been kept up very well. As soon as construction is done, it will be ideal I am sure. We basically just used the house as an overnight stay but it was a quaint home close to downtown and a nice change amidst apartment buildings down the street. It was also nice to be able to walk to a couple of restaurants around and not worry about driving and/or parking.  Robert sent a very detailed message describing parking, entering the house and odds and inns just in case. Again, we didn't end up using any of them besides parking due to time constraints but had a very nice sleep and warm shower! "
1928010,35918607,2015-06-23,6929033,Daniel,"Beautiful hose in a great location. Rob responded to any questions quickly and was great for the entirely of my stay. The house has all a the amenities you could want and is walking distance from great coffee, brunch, bars just down the street (try Single Shot) and fantastic restaurants (highly recommend Altura on Broadway, 3 blocks away). You can also get almost anywhere is Seattle with a quick Uber ride. The suite is well appointed and very quiet. I've booked Rob's home twice now and plan to do so again when I'm back in Seattle in a few month. Highly recommended!"

This is a very pretty, quiet place. Yet it's right off the activity of Capital Hill. Easy walking to great spots as well as Pike's Market. I will stay again!"

The room was great! The location is perfect, and everything one would need is close by. I once lived on Capitol Hill, so I knew that the location was awesome. The house, the room, and all the finishes are top notch, and I would definitely stay at Rob's place again. There was a lovely couple in another room, but I never heard them, and hardly saw them. This is a great value, in the perfect location, with an accommodating host who is attentive without being intrusive.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! --Cheers!"
1928010,38597152,2015-07-17,4134523,Meg,"Roberts home is lovely. The renovations were handled beautifully and the house is walking distance to Volunteer Park, a QFC and restaurants."
1928010,38775869,2015-07-18,32160424,Joe,Robert was accommodating and the house was very clean. His instructions were clear and accurate. I had a great time and would stay here again. 
1928010,38999438,2015-07-20,4363879,Katie,I stayed at Robert's with a few friends for a wedding weekend and we enjoyed our stay. The location is fantastic and the room was very nice. Check-in was very easy and Robert even let us drop our bags early. I would definitely recommend Robert's to anyone visiting Seattle.
1928010,39616065,2015-07-25,30207331,Pamela,Robert was welcoming and made us feel right at home. His house is beautiful and simply decorated. 
1928010,40144153,2015-07-28,1989775,Joe,Robert was a great host. He provided for everything we needed and has a beautiful and comfortable home. The location is killer and the whole experience was nice and easy.
1928010,40492932,2015-07-31,37834447,Sarah,House was great! Robert provided very detailed instructions for us which we very much appreciated because this was our first airing experience! Location was great! Home was lovely!
1928010,41625123,2015-08-08,36732891,James,"We enjoyed our four days and three nights at Robert's home.  All the the accommodations were as presented in the listing.  The home was clean and very well stocked.  We had fun in the Capital Hill Area, especially Broadway Street.  We were close to many of the popular attractions on the Water Front. We would definitely stay again."
1928010,42103784,2015-08-11,23247548,Benoit,Très belle chambre bien situé à Seattle. Notre hôte Robert a été à la fois très accueillant et respectueux. Beaucoup de bons restaurants a proximité. Quartier très calme. Je le recommande à tous.
1928010,43243080,2015-08-18,36443938,Kristin,"Robert was very communicative throughout the process; he always replied quickly to inquiries and even emailed me the day of to let me know the room was ready early. The house is well located, about a 1.5 mile walk to Pike's Market. There are restaurants/bars closer by (Including a donut shop 1 block away!) but the neighborhood itself is quiet, which was perfect. The room has a big closet for storage, and the bathroom was large and modern. We did find it a bit difficult to find a parking spot in the area at night, but Robert made this easier by providing a guest pass (which allows you to park anywhere in the neighborhood), and we didn't really need a car while there given how close we were to downtown. Overall, a great stay!"
1928010,43426290,2015-08-19,38971467,Betty,"As a first-time Airbnb user, I appreciated the host making the experience easy and efficient.  It was great to have street parking, a great neighborhood to explore, and most importantly, a well-appointed, clean and comfortable room in a beautiful home designed for welcoming others.  I didn't have the opportunity to meet the host, but all of our communications were timely and efficient."
1928010,43589791,2015-08-20,1762977,Jamie And Sally,"Fantastic accommodations, especially enjoyed the new deck! "
1928010,45787944,2015-09-06,36489822,Jieun,"It was so nice experience to stay this house. The room was very clean and neat but sometimes little bit cold. And the host, Rob was very kind and reply quickly. There are lots of restaurants and market for feeling local mood. "
1928010,46507639,2015-09-11,41536363,Fran,"Roberts place was tasteful, clean, comfortable, and convienent, to downtown. Robert was very quick to answer questions and be of service if needed.  If we are ever in   again this would be our go to place. If you arrive late at night it is difficult to find parking."
1928010,46882959,2015-09-14,13202315,Carol,"An excellent place to stay. The location in a quiet part of Capitol Hill was perfect. Easy access to public bus. Top Pot is a block away for morning coffee and fine donuts. The restaurants and cafes of Broadway are a short walk. The house itself is lovely. It has been beautifully and lovingly renovated. Spic and span clean. The bed was very comfortable with lights on both sides. When we needed a fan on a hot day, Bob installed one immediately. The bathroom had two sinks and an ample shower with good water pressure. Having the additional space adjoining (a small bedroom with a futon sofa) was convenient for keeping our luggage. The living spaces downstairs were comfortable, attractive and as nice as home. The kitchen is superb with every gadget known to man. We used only the French press but seeing the array was impressive. A small caveat: Capitol Hill is, well, hilly. There is a full flight of steps to the front door; if you cannot climb stairs or hills then this house and Capitol Hill are not for you. We hope to return to both."
1928010,47041522,2015-09-15,37093457,Kristen,A great stay in a fantastic neighborhood. Exceeded expectations! 
1928010,49104898,2015-10-01,8605534,Christian,"The suite is very nice but the bed was too soft for us.
"
1928010,49973471,2015-10-08,36220510,Susan,"Robert was at the house when we arrived and helped set up the second bed for a member of our party. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Great shower with truly hot water. Quiet residential neighborhood, with a coffee shop in the next block with great lattes! About a mile from our conference center, a downhill walk into town. He directed us to nearby pub for dinner the night we arrived, and the food was good.  I was cold the first night, then discovered a comforter in the closet. After that I slept well."
1928010,50091938,2015-10-09,43489383,Lindsay,"Our host, Robert, was perfect! He was very helpful and quick to return communication (email, airbnb messages, and a text upon arrival) and went above and beyond in regards to parking in his neighborhood, since my car had been hit and damaged just a week or so before, it was a real load off my mind! I would recommend a stay in his beautiful home, in this great neighborhood (quiet but with services open late even on a Wednesday evening), easier parking than some areas of Seattle, and his home was clean, cozy and just as described. We will happily stay again - Thanks Robert!"
1928010,50624620,2015-10-13,10214709,Joyce,"I loved our stay at Robert's place! He was welcoming, friendly,  and clear and detailed in his communication. His place is lovely- comfortable, very clean, and in the perfect location! Capitol Hill is by far my favorite neighborhood in Seattle.  His home is located in a quiet residential area, but a few streets down, there's a lot to see, eat, and do! His home is about a 20 minute walk to the gorgeous Volunteer Park. I walked to downtown/waterfront almost every day- very accessible. The Washington Park Arboretum (gorgeous!) and the Seattle Center (touristy) were just a bus ride away.  If I come back to Seattle, I definitely hope to stay at Robert's home again! "
1928010,51296384,2015-10-19,5140089,Elena,Rob's place was great! The accommodations were very comfortable and the private bathroom was a great feature. Rob was a very kind host - he even let us carve pumpkins in his backyard!
1928010,51645138,2015-10-22,14473790,Jonathan,Robert was great and very friendly and accommodating. Would definitely recommend! 
1928010,52210648,2015-10-27,10086492,Natasha,"Fantastic location, beautiful rooms and bathroom, extremely clean. "
1928010,52839895,2015-11-02,7841247,Brittany,"You can walk ANYWHERE in the city from his house in under 30 minutes.  The room was clean and Robert was great!  He let us make ourselves at home and let us know we could ask him if we had any questions.  The house was very chill. It was a perfect place to wind down and recharge after walking in the city all day.

We didn't spend much time in the house during our visit but we definitely utilized the bed every night. SUPER COMFORTABLE.  (The futon in the middle room is really comfortable too. )

Stay with Robert! "
1928010,54088395,2015-11-16,35573966,Doug,We had a great time at Robert's home.  It was very warm and welcoming.  Robert s very attentive getting back to me in a very timely manner even-though he was in Mexico during our stay.  We would deferentially recommend his home to anyone looking for a place to stay in the Seattle area in the future. 
1928010,55239541,2015-11-29,47383084,Dj,Robert was very nice and has a lovely home. It is withn Uber - distance to downtown and Capitol hill. Definitely recommend!
2474569,14765102,2014-06-25,16541931,Mark,"Robert was  a good host and has a very interesting house that is like an art gallery with sculptures and art everywhere. The neighbourhood is quiet and picturesque,  but quite a distance from the downtown.  Unfortunately I also have to mention that I got badly bitten by bed bugs there, which did sour the otherwise good experience. I'm sure Robert will sort that out, but I felt other travellers should know."
2474569,16147223,2014-07-22,12695690,Phillip,amazing place! super unique. Robert is very nice and great to talk to. one could spend hours looking at his collection.
2474569,16183951,2014-07-22,18118111,Georg,Roberts place is gorgeous.  You have the basement with all you need and on top an impressing exhibition of Elvis and other fancy details. Robert is a very pleasant and helpful host. You stay in a quiet area only 10 driving minutes from fancy Ballard. Highly recommended.
2474569,16963333,2014-08-04,17091826,Jordan,"Robert is fantastic! When we arrived we brought wine to share, and we're really glad we did. Stories shared liberally, and when the evening ended we were no longer strangers, we were friends. His house is amazing and inspirational; it's filled to the brim with art, and a work of art itself through Robert's novel improvements. The room is comfortable and memorable, the house is totally unique, and the host is a gem. Would absolutely stay again."
2474569,17136546,2014-08-07,13242046,Jeff,"Easy to find, good restaurants nearby.  Charming lower level unit that showcased Robert's eclectic tastes.  Tranquil outdoor garden area.  Robert was a great host and very helpful with needs and information."
2474569,18905488,2014-09-02,19904971,Jenna,"Robert has a quirky and eclectic space, but our stay was wonderful.  He was responsive, showed us around, and then let us have space.  His place is close to I5, which made daily travel to downtown Seattle a breeze."
2474569,20394897,2014-09-28,21704162,Sharon,We enjoyed our stay in this unique and eclectic home.  Robert was very responsive to our inquiries and flexible about a time for meeting us.  This home is an easy drive to I5 if you want quick access.  He provided us with coffee/tea but Diva Espresso is a short walk away :)
2474569,25221309,2015-01-09,20130506,Michael,"Robert was a very welcoming and accommodating host. Besides the quirky memorabilia, the place had a very hotel-like atmosphere: it was very clean, well stocked with fresh towels, soaps, etc. I pretty much kept to myself, and it was easy to come and go as I pleased. I don't want to make any guarantees about what Robert is offering, but I basically got the whole lower floor to myself, so I had lots of room. Also, no one has mentioned that Robert hooked up a pressure gauge to the bathroom sink, and you can see the needle move when you turn it on. Pretty nifty."
2474569,32247112,2015-05-16,26928028,Lissa,"Robert is a gracious host. His decor is amazing,  it's like you are at a boutique hotel. Beautiful backyard in a quiet neighborhood, close to freeway ($20 uber ride to downtown). I will definitely stay again."
2474569,33560378,2015-05-29,5951266,Gus,Robert was a marvelous host with a truly fascinating house. Staying in his home was both a comfortable stay and a charming glimpse at the house of someone who has lived a very colorful life.
2474569,33886013,2015-06-01,5951266,Gus,Robert was an impeccable host. 
2474569,34045674,2015-06-03,9376693,Doug,Great space I felt like I was staying in a private tribute museum.  Very well done and the space was quite spacious.
2474569,34578592,2015-06-09,17342726,Sal,"This is easily the most interesting airbnb that we have stayed at. There are so many interesting artifacts, paintings and collections  in this house its like staying at quirky museum. And the yard is amazing. Robert is an excellent host, although we didn't meet him until our last day the communication was always easy.  I definitely recommend this host and home."
2474569,34760558,2015-06-11,901627,Maximilian,"Wow, what an amazing place! Robert has created a unique house where the Elvis room is only a small part of the picture. Robert was very flexible and provided us with great tips. We very much enjoyed our brief stay."
2474569,34897228,2015-06-13,10980371,Michael,"Fun, funky space.  Lots of fun exploring our host's collection of art and memorabilia.  Robert was very friendly and glad to give a tour.  Place was very clean.  A little cool and floors are tile so cold.  Recommend bringing slippers.  Would recommend to travelers looking for something unique, particularly if you are a fan of folk art (or Elvis)."
2474569,35055338,2015-06-14,28110007,Eunice,He is a great host. He is very kind and helpful. His room is warm and cozy. Downtown is not that close to his room but there is a but which go directly to downtown. 
2474569,35439716,2015-06-18,34586252,Shuo,It  is very cool and comfortable to live in this house.
2474569,35697133,2015-06-21,136524,Rod,"This is THE most interesting place that we have ever stayed at. 
The room itself is a shrine to Elvis, but the whole entire house is this way too, except not just Elvis stuff. It was like living in a museum. We could have spent days looking through all the interesting paintings, memorabilia, art, and collections that Robert has. Definitely never a dull moment here. Robert also was very gracious and gave us an illuminating tour of the house including the back yard which has mirrors on the insides of the fence, and the West side story inspired doors outside.  Robert communicates very well, and we were never lacked for anything. However, he was also very respectful of us, so he reminded us of Siri, always there and available, but stayed out of sight, out of mind so we felt we had the second floor to ourselves. No TV's in this place which was amazing in itself. A definite throwback time travel to a forgotten time. Would recommend this place to anyone, but we plan to return again and again so we hope this gem doesn't get too popular. Thanks Robert!"
2474569,36748256,2015-06-30,8257768,Kai,Robert was the perfect host. Before our arrival the communication was  smooth and we did find his place with ease. Robert was very welcoming and introduced us to his wonderful house. Actually the place we could use is like having an on flat. His collection of art and the ambience is awesome! Really enjoyed staying there. It was one of the best airbnb places we stayed so far.
2474569,37063013,2015-07-04,12778006,Andrea,"Robert was warm and welcoming when we arrived. The basement suite was comfortable and perfect for our needs. His apartment was beautifully decorated and his garden was lovely. We loved that he left out coffee, fruit and information for us. I highly recommend Robert's place. It's a real gem!  "
2474569,37391765,2015-07-06,29213635,Lydia,We had a great stay at Robert's house. Everything was nice and clean and he even provided coffee and fruits. The house is in a quiet and nice neighborhood and there is a bus stop 2 minutes away what makes it easy to go to downtown Seattle. We would definitely come back!
2474569,37917583,2015-07-11,5210314,Frank,"Robert has an amazing house. He welcomes you into it, thinking of a lot of little, nice details like fruit and water.

The place is bigger than it seems on the pictures, also it is very private since it's on the lower floor. We recommend to bring slippers since the floor can be quite cold.

"
2474569,38362411,2015-07-14,30030724,Joshua,"Our stay with Robert was excellent.  Communication was quick and easy.  Robert showed us the suite which was found to be exactly as described/expected. After a quick tour we were given a key and left to go about our day, although Robert was available to us if we needed him.  The house is located in a quiet neighborhood one block from a bus stop from where we were able to access any area of Seattle during our stay.  "
2474569,39237097,2015-07-21,7559330,Tiffany,"This place was my favorite part of my stay in Seattle. Robert is a fantastic host, and I LOVED his house. The Elvis room made me happy every time I walked in, and the steampunk outhouse was perfectly charming. I love how we were welcomed with fresh plums from a tree in the neighborhood. Thanks for everything!"
2474569,40125512,2015-07-28,22216865,John,"Robert's place is more like an apartment than a room.  Quite large with everything one could need.  Robert was very nice and directed me to his house quite nicely. He is a very pleasant man but, unfortunately, we didn't spend a lot of time together due to my schedule. The house is very convenient to Interstate 5 and downtown. It is a very comfortable and a quiet place to stay and I slept well amongst all the Elvis memorabilia. I would most certainly stay there again and highly recommend Robert's home when visiting Seattle.

2474569,40299352,2015-07-29,24073272,Ana Lucia,"Na realidade nos encontramos quando estavamos de partida.Nesse meio tempo toda a comunicaçao foi feita atraves de telefone,recados ou mensagens nas quais ele foi bastante solicito.
O bairro e agradavel embora muiiito distante do centro mas com onibus perto.
O ambiente Ëlvis"" é uma estoria a parte! Talvez uma replica de Graceland em menor escala. Os fas de Elvis vao delirar! Nao é o meu caso. O quarto tem conforto,silencio mas senti falta de um lugar pra pendurar as roupas ja que tudo estava tomado pelo Elvis.  Não tenho queixas mas nao me hospedaria la de novo. O clima Elvis (uma opiniao pessoal,é claro) me lembra uma camara mortuaria mas cada um tem o seu gosto e nao vou questionar isso! "
2474569,40489029,2015-07-31,28249329,Spencer,"Robert was a great host, and the house was just what had been promised. The design was fantastic and fun to look at. There were all sorts fun things to check out in the house, and Robert gave us great suggestions for places to visit and to eat. "
2474569,40637830,2015-08-01,36593549,Jami,"This place was so cool! Yes, it's totally kitsch, but it's totally fun. When my friend and I arrived we took pictures and snooped around all the cool nooks and crannies for over an hour. It was so much fun. 
The basement level was a nice, cool break from the hot weather. The garden was lovely but we didn't have much time to hang out. Robert was friendly. 
The best was comfortable enough, although I could have used an extra pillow. It did have a tiny bit of a basement smell, but I didn't mind because everything else was so awesome and for $65 I would have put up with a lot worse. 
I want to come back again soon. It was easy and convenient to get to Ballard and downtown (a Lyft was only $20 from his house). "
2474569,40822332,2015-08-02,18774451,Samantha,This is the coolest place I've stayed by far. Everything was as promised and Robert was a great host. Instructions for arrival were clear and straightforward. Wish we could have stayed longer.
2474569,42946902,2015-08-16,256373,Faruk,"Robert's place was exactly as promised: an Elvis-tastic room in an overall very art-filled, unique house. We especially loved the working gauge on the hot water tap in the bathroom! Overall however the place is nice, clean, comfortable, and Robert provided a variety of niceties to make our stay extra enjoyable."
2474569,44029003,2015-08-23,41169780,Josh,Staying at Robert's home is a treat in itself. The creative and eclectic furnishings make the stay that much more enjoyable.
2474569,45409573,2015-09-02,41113733,Amy,"The place was delightful, funky, and fun! I love how it looks like any other little Seattle house from the front, but the fence doors around the back is your first clue to the rich world within. The steampunk shower plumbing is a highlight! 

Robert was very communicative, and we felt very welcome, with coffee and milk in the fridge and fresh slippers to wear in the house.

The neighborhood is great, right on a bus line going downtown, and near the lovely Bitter Lake park. Walking distance to a good coffee shop. Little Ting's Dumpling House and Teriyaki Time were great too."
2474569,46326030,2015-09-09,42634239,Aaron,"Great place to stay, awesome house and very gracious host. Would definitely stay here again next time I'm in the area."
2474569,46747414,2015-09-13,35655061,Michael,"We were hosted by Robert twice recently. He made us feel quite welcome. The room was accurately listed and included nice extras, especially the view of the rock garden and such. The neighborhood was convenient to our plans and I imagine we will keep this in mind again."
7071021,37719965,2015-07-09,27484290,Orly,"The host was very welcoming and efficient. I got stuck in the city without a hotel room and she connected me quickly after I sent her the request for the room and even help me with getting my luggage to the room. I felt that she was responsive and attended my needs in a gentle, and pleasant manner. 
The apartment itself was nice, as seen in the picture,  and clean. Towels, soap and shampoo were provided. Kitchen was pretty big and seemed nice, however, I didn't get to use it. There was no AC, which is often a non-issue in Seattle, but that specific week was really hot. There is a very nice, big, standing fan. 
The apartment is at the back of the building, so the view isn't nice. The price was reasonable to Seattle. One additional thing that I didn't like is that it was not easy to open the building front door. One of the neighbors tried to teach me how, and we spend good 5 minutes trying to do so. I heard this should be fixed soon. 
Also, since the apartment it is located within the University district, I would recommend checking that the back gate is operating. "
7071021,39809674,2015-07-26,37289844,Daniele,"L'host è stata in generale cortese. Il mio check in è avvenuto abbastanza tardi e, pur dopo qualche perplessità e un po' di attesa, è venuto ad aprirmi un ragazzo. Quindi non ho incontrato l'host al mio arrivo e non ho avuto alcuna descrizione delle peculiarità dell'appartamento. C'è stato qualche intoppo iniziale (tipo una doccia che funzionava male), ma l'host è sempre intervenuta in modo celere.  L'alloggio è in una grande posizione per chi deve raggiungere l'università, e la zona intorno è tranquilla, anche se non è da ""canone italiano"", nel senso che ci sono vari barboni fra le stradine dietro il palazzo e le strade adiacenti, ma, purtroppo, è una cosa molto comune lì; infatti, dalla finestre dell'appartamento, da cui si ha solo uno scorcio sul retro del palazzo pieno di bidoni dell'immondizia, ogni tanto si può vedere qualche povero senza-tetto che cerca rifugio la notte. Il vero neo dell'appartamento è il palazzo in cui è inserito, piuttosto vetusto e non proprio pulito. Non amo molto gli ""odori"", e forse per questo non mi sono trovato al meglio. Quando si arriva, non si ha una grande sensazione di ""sicurezza"", ma forse è solo un'impressione. In generale, è un posto ottimo per la posizione, molto vicino a fermate del bus e a negozi, ma l'appartamento è un po' vecchiotto, e la struttura in cui inserita non è certo bella o confortevole. "
7071021,40511529,2015-07-31,38891118,Tim,"This was a superb location one block from University Ave. The unit was clean and exactly as described. The building was extremely quiet given the location. The only downside was the restricted hours to use the garbage dumps, and that was mostly my issue as I was working late and easily remedied by using a garbage can on the street less than 200 ft away. 

All in all a nice little spot in a great location."
7071021,40965672,2015-08-03,15486839,Rebecca,"We were in town to find an apartment my daughter who is attending grad school in the fall.  The location is perfect if you're visiting UW.  Also very convenient for food, shops and transportation.  Photos accurately represent unit and it is quiet (other than the occasional parking lot disturbance, see below).  Building had a lot of work going on while we were there (painting, sanding on stairwell) but it didn't interfere with our plans.  Unit was reasonably clean but very spartan.  Things one would take for granted in a furnished space (clothes hangers, trash cans, pots and pans, can opener) were missing.  We didn't use the TV so can't comment on that but WiFi worked as described.  Bed was comfortable enough and shower had good pressure.

You should be aware, however, that this unit faces a kind of sketchy parking lot.  We heard vomiting every night and had to call 911 when we realized someone had OD'ed right outside our window.  

We never met the host, Melissa.  Keys were waiting for us and we left them when checked out.  Melissa wasn't super responsive to our text inquiries but we were looking for a room, not a tour guide so that was okay with us.

Overall, for the price, this place is a good option if you need nothing more than a safe, inexpensive place to sleep in the University District of Seattle."
7071021,45091160,2015-08-31,1371014,Gabriel,"Great location for UW visitors. The unit was clean with all features as described in the post. Note that  the unit is at the back of the building, and view isn't very good. But overall concerning price to quality ratio I think it is very good. "
6065566,39942729,2015-07-27,34953621,Steve,"Our stay in Seattle was greatly enjoyed because we had a charming house on Queen Anne Hill to stay in.  It was perfectly located between downtown and north Seattle.  There is shopping and restaurants within walking distance.  And on Thursday evenings is a small farmers market with fresh produce, food stalls and even wine tasting.
The house was as described and comfortably accommodated 5.
Kevin was a great host with flexible check in and check out.  Would return again in an instant."
6065566,45142544,2015-08-31,12224221,Christina,Kevin and Jenny were very easy to work with. Coordinating our stay was easy and they always responded in a timely manner. They were even willing to let me pick up the keys a day early - making things easier for both of us. The house was exactly was we expected with all sorts of homey details. 
6670332,36730280,2015-06-30,7379416,Maria Cristy,"FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE!!! These folks were incredibly welcoming and their space was superb. We were less than a 30 minute bus ride to Pikes Market. When we did decide to drive the city center was a 10 minute drive. We couldn't have asked for a better location.

Rob promptly and clearly communicated our every question online/in person. This host met all of our needs. My mother is allergic to pet hair and he made an effort to buy us hypoallergenic sheets! The space is spotless, the kitchen has everything you would need for a long term stay, and even the pull out bed is comfortable. It was incredible having a parking spot to call our own and many bars/restaurants were in walking distance.

It's in the details: Upon arrival we were greeted by the hosts (who live next door to this site). They left us with a list of great restaurants to explore along with other Seattle specific reading material. They provided towels, tea, reusable shopping bags, and surprise treats in the fridge! 

We had an exceptional visit. Will be back! Thank you, Rob!"
6670332,38174856,2015-07-13,20662600,Kylie,"Rob and Suzi were very welcoming and fast to respond to my questions!  The house was very clean, and exactly as pictured.  My boyfriend and I stayed for 3 nights and 4 days for our anniversary- and it was just what we were hoping for- very close to downtown, quiet and relaxing!  Great weekend in Seattle!"
6670332,39430931,2015-07-23,37893019,Efren,"If I come around Seattle, will stay at this place again.  Our hosts are very nice and considerate.  I have a young member in the family and they helped childproof the house so detergents/cleaning supplies are out of reach.  We really appreciated that.

The house is very clean and all essentials for cooking, laundry, sleeping are available. Location is very convenient to grocery stores. We stayed for 4 nights and we shopped at Trader Joe's and Uwajimaya market for all our grocery needs.  Pike Market, Waterfront, and downtown areas are only 10 minute drive, and they are several trendy restaurants within Capitol Hill that are walking distance.  It's about a mile away from the freeway and it only took us 40 minutes to get to Future of Flight and Boeing tour in Everett. It's also nice that their house is right next to Immaculate Conception church.  It's one of the best choir I've ever seen in many church services that we've attended.

Our host are very gracious to give us a treats upon arrival.  It's well thought of that they have goodies for adults and our kids.  One particularly treat was a chocolate bar from Theo.  As a result, we visited Theo Chocolates, one of Seattle's very own and I highly recommend to check out the place.  It's close to Fremont Bridge, where you'll find the Fremont troll under Aurora Bridge.

I highly recommend this place to stay if you're in Seattle.  The house is conveniently located to stores and Seattle's landmarks, it's clean in a quiet neighborhood, and our hosts are very nice and friendly.  They also have an awesome dog, though I melt for Border Collies.  "
6670332,39961572,2015-07-27,2685182,Yvonne,"Rob was great at responding leading up to the trip. After a long drive, we were greeted with some lovely treats upon checking-in. Even though there was a miscommunication for the check-out time, everything went smoothly and Rob was very understanding. His home is beautiful and well-kept. There is everything you would need for a long-term stay. If it hadn't been raining, we definitely would've used the deck and outdoor spaces. I would recommend staying here to everyone. "
6670332,40805403,2015-08-02,20370711,Yuning,This place is very clean and spacious just as described in the pictures. It has a good location if you're traveling in Seattle. It is close to downtown and has good restaurants around. Rob and Suzi live in the next door. They are very quiet but are accessible for questions and information. We enjoyed our stay.
6670332,41380132,2015-08-07,36359350,Olivier,"Quel ravissement que cette jolie petite maison et ses hôtes particulièrement accueillants et attentifs. Tout était prévu pour notre confort. Nous nous sommes tout de suite sentis chez nous et avons particulièrement apprécié de déjeuner et de dîner sur la petite terrasse bien aménagée. Le quartier très agréable et calme est très bien situé et permet un accès rapide au centre ville. Merci pour ces trois jours que nous n'oublierons pas
"
6670332,45562465,2015-09-04,9761964,Eva,"We came to visit our family for more than a month and we decided to stay in an Airbnb rather than an hotel because it was much convenient to have our own house. We found everything we could ask for in the kitchen, bathroom and living-room. Plus some other delightful surprises ;)

The house is quite large and each room feels spacious. Everything is  brand new, very clean and organized.

The neighborhood is very quiet but it is located just some minutes away walking to the trendy and fantastic center of Capitol Hill.

Overall renting this house was a really good experience and I would totally recommend it to everyone who want to have a piece of paradise while visiting Seattle.
Thanks!
"
6670332,46140334,2015-09-08,38262896,Laura,Fabulous! This is a great location and a beautiful home. We are hoping to come visit again soon. 
6670332,47702740,2015-09-21,19121537,Katie,"Loved the place - great location in Seattle. Rob made everything easy. We loved the accommodations - everything was sparkly fresh, immaculate and thoughtful. Recommend it very highly!"
6670332,49631446,2015-10-05,21684508,Benjamin,Rob's place is fantastic: very clean and comfortable and in one of my favorite parts of Seattle. Rob was communicative and helpful. I wish I could have stayed longer.
6670332,50370155,2015-10-11,32072752,Megan,"This was my first experience with airbnb and I am very impressed. Rob and Suzi were very welcoming and have a great place to offer. It was my home away from home while I stayed in Seattle for almost a week to visit the nearby National Parks and explore downtown, which is within walking distance from their property. It's also very close to a nice co-op and Trader Joe's for all the groceries you need for your stay. Quiet, clean, and very welcoming. The pictures on the listing are spot on. Thank you for a great stay!"
6670332,52351322,2015-10-28,3893477,Melanie,Felt very welcomed to Rob's home. It was clean and comfortable. Would be happy to stay there again on our next trip to Seattle! 
6670332,53030094,2015-11-03,8918682,George,"We really enjoyed our stay at Rob's apartment.  The location (right across the Immaculate Conception church) was within short walking distance to Cap Hill and everything it has to offer.  The apartment was spacious, clean and well equipped with anything we needed.  I would recommend this place to friends.  "
6670332,53595002,2015-11-10,8739692,Erika,"What a clean little house, I miss it! I would stay here again. I visited Seattle this last week for work and decided to stay a couple of more days just to relax and it was perfect for that. The house is about 30 minutes away from the airport and very close to lots of little shops and coffee shops. Whole Foods is very close too which for me was a plus since I was going to be doing some cooking. The kitchen has everything you need to prepare a wonderful meal. "
6670332,54146044,2015-11-16,3937530,Chapman,"Great place and location. It was pretty much what we wanted in our visit. Rob seemed to have provided everything we needed, and it was a nice place to stay for a weekend."
6134153,35708827,2015-06-21,34619152,Todd,"The apartment was very clean and ready for us when we got there.  The neighborhood is very nice.  There's a Safeway, Trader Joe's and lots of restaurants in close walking distance."
6134153,36705624,2015-06-30,23436728,Lee,"The apartment was clean, beds and other furniture were comfortable and kitchen was great for cooking.  We loved the neighborhood which offers a lot in terms of shopping, eating out, walking and access to downtown.
That said, we would not have rented this unit had we known that it was a daylighted basement.  The unit was good temperature-wise, but had less than optimal light especially in the late afternoon.   "
6134153,37199087,2015-07-05,25505895,Gavin,"The accommodations were great and they did a wonderful job welcoming us.  They gave great options of where to dine, parking, and shopping within the area.  Definitely recommend this place again!  "
6134153,37874493,2015-07-11,35338547,Russ,"This was a delightful apartment.  The information provided was everything that we needed.  No confusion about how to get into the apartment, where it was, or when it was available.  It was very clean with a nice kitchen with all the dishes, pots, and utensils we needed.  The neighborhood is great - good public transportation, a myriad of interesting restaurants in all price ranges.  We had a great time.  (One small warning, the check out time is not flexible and there's no place to leave your luggage when you check out.)  Our hosts were also totally friendly and helpful when we called them."
6134153,40363827,2015-07-30,27979546,Liane,"The unit was great for our visit with 3 adults and 1 child.  The separate bedrooms and twin beds in the 2nd room were perfect.  Having a full kitchen to use to cook our meals worked out well to save some money and not have to rush to eat out.  Also the convenience of a washer and dryer in the units was great.  The location couldn't have been better.  The bus stop to downtown was just half a block away and the convenience of the grocery store, coffee shops and other eateries within 2-3 blocks was ideal.  The little park 3 short blocks away was cute and more geared for younger kids/toddlers which even had a little wading pool for a hot day.

A couple of things that I wish I paid closer attention to in the details before arriving: 1) no face towels are provided but an ample supply of bath towels, 2) although the kitchen had all the plates/utensils/pots/pans to cook there are no condiments so we had to buy our own and 3) the unit is downstairs as others noted so when there are guests upstairs it is a bit loud hearing their foot steps and moving around."
6134153,41127302,2015-08-04,38462292,Sen,"Very clean, decent location. We enjoyed our stay. Thanks."
6134153,42452808,2015-08-13,37741050,Fred,Great location and as advertised. I'd recommend for a family that wants to be near everything without breaking the bank. Highly recommended.
6134153,42700993,2015-08-15,27668750,Tom,The host had the place ready to go for us when we arrived. The place was nice and accommodated my family well. The best part about this apt. was the proximity to the beautiful Queen Anne neighborhood and all the things it had to offer. I would recommend staying at this location to anyone.  
6134153,45570826,2015-09-04,9932372,John And Karolina,Everything as advertised. 
6134153,46016930,2015-09-07,22241078,Forrest,excellent condition！perfect location！
6134153,49819418,2015-10-06,6288983,Jason,"Check in was easy and the mgmt team was helpful. Location is unbeatable. we were disappointed that cleanliness was not up to expectation given the perfect review, we found hair in our beds, bathtub and toilet, kitchen is also kind of dusty. The mgmt team was trying to be helpful and offered to send a cleaning team.

Gene and Shannon came all the way from suburb to personally visit and apologize and insisted to buy us dinner. I really appreciated their dedication and that showed their care and love for the place. 

So overall i would still recommend if the problem is solved. the basement level might be a problem, that gives a relatively damp environment. "
4438188,23139301,2014-11-23,9454764,Kara,"The best experience ever! Sally is wonderful, friendly, and the basement apartment was comfortable. A perfect place to stay in the U District. A basket of goodies on the coffee table was a nice bonus! I've already booked my next stay in January 2015. "
4438188,23402558,2014-11-30,742971,Freeman,"Sally and Rich are some of the kindest people we've met in our travels. They really went out of their way to make my girlfriend and I feel at home during our stay in their downstairs apartment. Fresh flowers, healthy snacks, adult beverages, soft clean towels, a super comfy bed, and great recommendations, all made for one of the most remarkable Airbnb experiences we've ever had. 

From the day of our arrival to the day of our departure, Sally was very helpful and easy to get ahold. 

And since we spent Thanksgiving in Seattle, Sally made us pots de creme and mini pumpkin pecan pies that were beyond delicious!

Amazing!

The space was even better than we imagined. It was large and open but also very cozy and private. Umbrellas, a coffee maker, pans, silverware, dishes, washer, dryer, and countless other amenities made the space easy to live and cook in for our weeklong stay. A private keyless entry also made coming and going simple and convenient. 

The neighborhood is very safe and has everything you could ever need. Restaurants, cafes, trader joes, etc. We had our own car but it seemed like public transportation was easily accessible.

Overall, this was definitely one of the best stays we've had at an Airbnb.

Genuinely caring people like Sally and Rich are what make the Airbnb community such an awesome place. "
4438188,25545657,2015-01-19,9454764,Kara,Sally is the best host ever! You will enjoy the apartment and the hospitality if you stay here!
4438188,25938335,2015-01-30,5575176,Jaimie,"Sally was an incredible host. She was the sweetest host I've had! My entire time at her cozy little apartment, she made sure I was absolutely taken care of. I felt like I was with family :) The apartment is incredible comfortable - the bed is top notch. I never wanted to get out of bed in the morning! This is a great location, and a great place to stay for your time in Seattle. I highly recommend."
4438188,26007441,2015-02-01,25693378,Daniel,Sally is awesome!  The experience was amazing and we will make sure to book it again when we come back to Seattle.
4438188,27538908,2015-03-07,3825523,Mollie,"A perfect space with a most generous, caring host. I could not have been happier!"
4438188,27953543,2015-03-15,27810134,Yiran,The house is very lovely. Comfortable bed and nice environment. Every thing is perfect. 
4438188,28495837,2015-03-24,26906609,Jane,"I felt welcomed and comfortable from the minute I walked into Sally and Rich's apartment. This safe, private, quiet, clean space was perfect for a busy six-night stay. I appreciated the very good quality cotton towels, sheets, and spa-type robe as well as the great mattress, bedding and comfy living room furniture. 
Sally's attention to detail is manifested in her welcome goodie basket, fresh flowers, basic
pantry items, and well-organized kitchen. Instructions (including arrival and entry info) and ""house rules"" were clear and sensible and parking on the street was always easy. Though I picked the location in part for the proximity to a relative living close by, I felt lucky to have found such a cozy place and warm and personable airbnb hosts. "
4438188,28933202,2015-04-01,26807015,Nicole,"The perfect place to stay! Sally is a wonderful host, and her suite is everything it claims to be and more. Sally met us when we came into town late at night and gave us a tour of the suite. She had snacks set out for us, and fresh flowers on the table. The rooms are exactly as in the pictures, comfortably furnished, clean and tidy. The location is great, within walking distance of lots of parks, grocery stores, and the university. We stayed for a week, and by the end it felt like we lived there. "
4438188,29897575,2015-04-13,5628384,Diana,"Sally was such a sweet host! She greeted us as we arrived and showed us to the lovely basement studio of her house. She left us with a gift basket full of snacks, along with some drinks in the fridge. She kept in contact with us through texts to make sure we were comfortable. Her house is less than a 15 min drive to downtown (without traffic) and a ~7 min drive to the Washington UV plaza. If you plan on staying here, make sure you read the provided house rules (and recycle rules if you're not familiar with Seattle's trash system). Overall, we had a great and peaceful stay. Thanks Sally!"
4438188,30165192,2015-04-18,12291736,Laura,"Sally's place is wonderful.  It's a basement apartment with plenty of light and views of her terrific perennial garden.  The bed is super comfortable with high quality bedding, and our two 6 foot teen boys  slept well on the pullout couch in the living room.  Sally pays such great attention to detail -- there were fresh flowers in the living room, and a fresh lilac from the garden in the bedroom; a basket of food goodies and a basket of fresh fruit.  She had some beverages in the fridge and made us some homemade blueberry muffins.  Simply lovely.    When we asked if she had a grill we could use to cook some fresh salmon, she quickly got us all set up with the grill, charcoal and a full array of implements.  Her garden is charming, and we spent a couple of hours one afternoon/evening reading out back.  I can't imagine how she could have made our stay any better.  "
4438188,31059850,2015-05-01,30800005,Nicholas,"Sally and Rich were very accommodating and made us feel right at home.  The apartment was wonderfully furnished/ decorated and had everything we needed including a lot of little extras like water and snacks which were much appreciated.   Thank you both for making Julia, my and Owen's trip so great.   Look forward to seeing you soon."
4438188,33769952,2015-06-01,2107788,Mason & Renny,"What can we say, Sally is a great hostess.  She does so much to make you feel welcome, really too numerous to list.  The place is spacious and comfortable.  Convenient to U dist. and parts of Greenlake park.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Sally and Rich, very kind and wonderful people."
4438188,34625970,2015-06-10,19046257,Sheron,"Sally was wonderful. The basement apartment is just as seen and described. I couldn't ask for a better environment and location to spend a week in Seattle. Even though Sally headed out of town shortly after my arrival, there was everything I needed and more. Plus she checked in via text and had a friend of hers check in during her absence.  I did a lot of walking and catching public transport was easy and convenient. Also Uber worked like a charm. Areas of explored and enjoyed that were a nice walk from Sally's place was Greenlake (check out Jodee's bakery and PCC market); a community gym about 3 blocks away from Sally's place was a find; Wallingford and Fremont. Not to mention a trader Joe's close by as well as the weekly Farmer's market - held on Saturday a few blocks away."
4438188,34808063,2015-06-12,34385491,Brian,What a great place to stay!  From the moment we arrived Sally made us feel at home.  Very relaxing and restaurants within walking distance.  It was great to be staying some place other than a hotel.  We would definitely stay here again.  
4438188,35067657,2015-06-15,5529462,Naishi,Sally's apartment was awesome! Great location and everything was very clean and neat inside. The bedroom and pull out couch were plenty of room for 4 adults. Sally did a ton to make us feel welcome including having snacks and water in the unit and staying in touch throughout our stay. I highly recommend it! 
4438188,35395669,2015-06-18,12405390,Tracey,"I have used Airbnb many times.  This was my favorite experience so far.  Not only was Sally's place clean, beautiful and comfortable, Sally had thought of every detail to make it a wonderful stay:  fresh flowers, freshly ground coffee, home baked bread and a variety of other snacks were there at our arrival.  Sally and her husband were very welcoming and offered recommendations for restaurants and were there for anything else we needed.   I will continue staying at Sally's place everytime I am in Seattle."
4438188,35922150,2015-06-23,2128993,Bernie,"This is a beautiful, comfortable place to stay in a convenient location. There were some good restaurants in the neighborhood, but we didn't find a breakfast location. Trader Joe's a few blocks away provided what we needed to make our own breakfast using the well stocked kitchen.

I'm 6'1"" and the low ceiling did not bother me. 

I'd stay there again next time. Sally was great at making us feel at home."
4438188,36093427,2015-06-25,9454764,Kara,As always Sally was great and the apartment was comfortable. It is a pleasure to stay at Sally's when I'm in Seattle.
4438188,36399277,2015-06-28,32434523,Alexandros,"We have no words to describe what an amazing host Sally is. We really loved everything, Sally is a wonderful person willing to help you and give you instructions and recommendations for everything. The place itself was excellent, it has easy access to downtown Seattle and most importantly you feel like home. We did spend time with Sally too, we even went out to dinner and we had a wonderful time. We loved our stay there, we strongly suggest this place for everyone's stay! Evita and Alexandros"
4438188,36948409,2015-07-03,30672405,Ben,"The apartment was exactly as listed, beautifully decorated and clean.

The host was very attentive and generous, we were thrilled to have some snacks and water there waiting for us.

The location was great. We continuously joked that everything seemed to be a 6 minute drive away. We had a rental care and parking was easy, and included.

There was tons of space for 3 of us, all very functional and nice. Firm, but comfortable mattress in the bedroom, and a pull-out bed that served our 5 year old very well."
4438188,37185697,2015-07-05,25828354,Miao,"Sally's place is neat and peaceful, and all kinds of kitchen stuff are ready to use and so convenient. Even in a hot summer day, it was cool inside the apt. And Sally was kindhearted and ready to help, and give us many advice on the route of trip. So nice and helpful!!!! Will definitely go to her place next time if i had any chance of visiting Seattle again~~~"
4438188,37741333,2015-07-10,9898638,Eun Chan,"Sally's home was very nice to me. The place was easy to find, kept clean and good to visit  city center via bus. "
4438188,38398670,2015-07-15,34396042,Jason,Sally is an amazing host! She provided several recommendations on places to go and things to see. We even had a great chat over dinner one evening. Would definitely stay there again if I ever make it back to Seattle. The place itself is clean and comfortable and has everything you need to feel at home.
4438188,40314085,2015-07-30,25593657,Thais,"Sally's place is excellent. It has easy access to downtown Seattle, it is equipt with everything one might need on an extended trip, neat and  very comfortable. I had a wonderful time there and would definitely come back. "
4438188,40906796,2015-08-03,31571004,王,Sally is the best hostess I have ever had. She always replied immediately she got my message and sent me as much information I may need as possible. She prepared a welcoming basket for us and packed the fridge with food. She even drove us to the zoo and a restaurant nearby. Her house is exactly the same as shown in the pictures and is very comfortable. It's very close to buses that can take us to the famous tourist attractions in Seattle. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to travel to Seattle!
4438188,41277436,2015-08-05,39857028,Tanya,"Sally was a very welcoming and hospitable hostess; she went out of her way to make our stay comfortable and offered her assistance with directions or recommendations in the city. Her home is clean and cozy, located in a quiet neighborhood near the university and downtown - we could not be happier with our experience. This is definitely a place we would visit again in the future!"
4438188,42519858,2015-08-14,32448322,Peggy,"Sally's place was our first experience with Airbnb and what a pleasure it was!  Sally was a gracious and welcoming hostess, the accommodations were clean and comfortable, and the location very convenient.  Thank you, Sally, for your superb hospitality!"
4438188,43048673,2015-08-17,34942667,Lisa,"My first experience with Airbnb was fantastic. Sally reached out well in advance of our trip to provide lots of useful information.  The place was perfect -- clean, comfy, spacious and nice snacks.   We didn't want to leave!

"
4438188,43779819,2015-08-22,28467455,Rosanna And Iain,"Sally is an amazing host, with a superb knowledge of Seattle and the surrounding areas. She was extremely helpful in providing us insiders/ local tips about Seattle that we would not have found out by ourselves. She was very friendly and made us feel immediately at home. The apartment itself is beautiful and done up to a very high standard. It had everything we needed. The location was brilliant, many bus links straight into down town. Within walking distance of Green Lake and the University which we made the most of."
4438188,44324011,2015-08-25,4847724,Miguel,"We loved staying at Sally's place, she is a great host. She made us feel welcome, striking the perfect balance between being available and helpful when we needed her but giving us space and privacy the rest of the time. 

Everything about our stay was wonderful: the neighborhood is great and very walkable, and the unit was well-appointed and tastefully decorated. Sally takes care of even the little things you don't think about: a few welcome snacks, toiletries in the bathroom, even an HDMI cable next to the TV in case you want to stream something from your computer. Staying here was the best Airbnb experience we've had. 

If I need a place to stay in Seattle again, either for myself or for friends/family, Sally's will be at the top of the list."
4438188,44916023,2015-08-30,16018891,Kaelene,"Sally was a wonderful host. She was kind, welcoming and an all around wonderful person. We had a wonderful time and the apartment was really great place to stay. You would pay more for a hotel with less. The bed was comfy, the room was homey. It felt like a home away form home. I would recommend this suite to anyone. "
4438188,45965760,2015-09-07,2894347,Rhonda,"I was extremely happy with my experience at Sally's. Her location, on a quiet street near the U district, was perfect. The apartment was well equipped and very comfortable. Had the best two nights' sleep in weeks :) I am planning to stay with Sally and hopefully have more great morning coffee breaks at her ultra cute bungalow whenever I am in Seattle."

4438188,47177551,2015-09-16,40074119,Ingrid,"WOW!  Where to begin???  Sally was so accommodating. Because we were coming by Ferry from B.C., we arrived quite late and we contacted her to let her know we were even later than expected.  She made it so easy with great, detailed directions.  When we arrived, there was a basket of snacks, drinks and breakfast items in the frig...more like a real B&B.  Her place is beyond spacious and ideal for extended stays.  It was perfect for us being close to the U district.  She even provided a parking permit for us and had a great Visitors' Guide in the space.  Her kitchen is well equipped and stocked.  Towels and linens are quality...she even provided bathrobes!  This all made for a VERY comfortable stay.  We only wish we had more than 3 days!  Sally was warm and welcoming...available on sight if needed, but certainly not an overbearing presence.   We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Sally and although she had a number of things going on at the time, we felt she was there for whatever we might need."
4438188,47694578,2015-09-21,25693378,Daniel,"This was our second stay with Sally and once again an outstanding place with terrific accommodations, exceptional service and absolutely perfect location with close proximity to U District and downtown Seattle.  We found our apartment impeccable, the bed comfortable and neat.  We couldn’t be happier with our experience."
4438188,50073771,2015-10-09,40433618,Stephanie,"I had the opportunity to stay at Sally's for an extended period of time and I can only hope the next time I get up to Seattle, I can stay with her again. The location was conveniently located on a quiet street in the University district. The apartment looked exactly as pictured and she is kind and helpful. I loved her guidebook full of suggestions of nearby areas of interest. The ability  to cook my own food and feel at home was so much better than any hotel offering in the area. She even had a few items in the fridge including coffee and creamer, after a delayed flight this simple gesture won my heart. "
4438188,52093418,2015-10-26,27735922,Janet,"This is a wonderful place to stay!  Our host made us feel like family, leaving snacks in the fridge, extra comforters in the bedroom and flowers on the table. She provided a street-parking permit so we  never parked more than a few steps from the front door.  The home is well located, 20 minutes to downtown, walking distance to a fabulous Saturday farmer's market, Green Lake Park, groceries, drug stores and restaurants. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful, a lovely respite afater days spent experiencing all Seattle has to offer."
4438188,53268501,2015-11-07,11136080,Marisol,"Sally made us feel incredibly welcome before we even arrived! Her communication was excellent, and the check-in/check-out process couldn't have been smoother. 

Going above and beyond, Sally left the fridge and pantry stocked with goodies and essentials, and had great advice on local food and events. There were even fresh cut flowers around the apartment!  

Perhaps the best description of our stay is that we kept finding ourselves saying, ""I'll meet you back at home"" --  The apartment was cozy enough that a few evenings we came back early just to relax and spend time there. 

The location was great. Very walkable, and a central place to drive from as well. I especially appreciated the combination of being close to the University yet in a very quiet neighborhood.

We truly had a lovely stay and will definitely look Sally up again when we return to Seattle. Highly recommended!

6489648,36740192,2015-06-30,35825909,Dingding,it was a very convenient location of the downtown area. Ten minutes to the pike place market. Suitable for a family with one child. With a fully equipped kitchen. 
6489648,42151238,2015-08-11,36718309,Joyce,Great location in Belltown. Located in between Pikes Place and The Space Needle which were all within walking distance. 
8904748,56089357,2015-12-08,27645232,Mike,Katie was very helpful in her communication with us upon arrival to the house which was very smooth.  The location was in a fairly quiet neighborhood but very accessible to the main streets to get downtown.  Great experience and we would stay there again if the opportunity presents itself
8904748,57338521,2015-12-24,10834034,Jana,"This is just an amazing home.Beautifully furnished and equipped.We found it hard to leave the home to visit our family and friends because it was so inviting.Beds and towels were the same as 5 star lodgings.Fireplaces upstairs and down were amazing.
As runners it was a short jaunt to Lake Washington's (website hidden) was easy to meet family in Leschi for holiday brunch.
Traffic is avoided to downtown Seattle because it is so close in you can avoid freeways.
Oh and there is radiant heat in the bathrooms,wow a total bonus!We 
loved it and will come back in a heart beat if still available."
8904748,57776602,2015-12-29,29835348,Curtis,Some friends and I came over for the seahawk rams game.  We stayed at Katies wonderful home.  It was absolutely perfect very clean comfortable and close to everything.   We loved it and plan on coming to more games and staying here if possible.   We have been over and stayed at several places and this is our favorite.
1815677,26347987,2015-02-09,6048083,Robin,I really enjoyed my stay at Chris' place. It's a great neighborhood and really close to downtown. There's a bus stop two blocks from his house that gets you downtown in less than 10 minutes. He pointed out some fun places to check out in Seattle and was a great host. It was nice to use the hot tub after I went jogging. I highly recommend Chris' place and would stay there myself when I'm in town again. 
1815677,39363599,2015-07-22,19710203,Beth,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1815677,41169899,2015-08-04,3354931,Sabina,"BEST LOCATION!
Chris' home is open, elegant and thoughtfully designed. There is everything here that make you feel like you are at home. The home is light and bright with beautiful, quality furnishings. It's impeccable!

We enjoyed being on a quiet street that is right next to Washington Park, yet we were able to get into downtown in a few minutes. 

Yoga is just around the corner, great restaurants are within a 2 minute walk and it was a great central location to explore the various neighborhoods of Seattle.

We highly recommend it. It just may be the best accommodation in (email hidden) was for us!"
1815677,44003896,2015-08-23,3354931,Sabina,"Again we had the opportunity to stay at Chris house. It was as I described in my last review: a great location, super clean & tidy home with well appointed furniture and cooking utensils. 

So much light floods this space (a bonus for Seattle) and being on the edge of Washington Park Arboretum was wonderful to stroll to.

Yoga & great restaurants just around the corner, a 1 min walk away, yet this home is quiet. "
1815677,45313314,2015-09-01,68983,Blake,"Chris's place has great light, great location and was very comfortable for 2 couples.  The neighborhood a couple blocks away (5min walk) has all the restaurants, cafe's, and conveniences you would need.

Definitely would stay here again, thanks Chris!"
1815677,46934143,2015-09-14,35261455,Luis Alexander,"Chris was an excellent host: clear communication, friendly, helpful, and accommodating when I needed to extend my stay. 

The property was also fantastic. Plenty of space, quiet (but close to fun parts of town) has a very nicely appointed bathroom (I'll miss the rain shower). 

No real complaints. Some issues with internet connectivity but that was Comcast, not Chris.

Would definitely stay again or recommend it to friends and other travelers."
1815677,47723303,2015-09-21,15282489,Franz,"Chris' home is really special.  The house is in a great neighborhood - walking distance from some great restaurants and a quick ride to downtown and all the sights.

It's full of light and the space flows well.  We used both bedrooms and they were comfortable.  The bathroom and kitchen are well maintained.  Water pressure in the shower is good.

The deck is a really nice feature.  Great place to enjoy the fresh Seattle air!  Also, because the house is across the street from a park, the outside area was quiet and private.

Staying at Chris' place really left us with a great impression of the city.  Would recommend to friends and family.

"
1815677,55821673,2015-12-06,2087308,Adam,"Chris was an excellent host.  His place is perfectly located, beautifully furnished and very cozy.  I highly recommend.  He was very quick and very helpful in getting back to me."
1815677,56551376,2015-12-14,20380100,Eric,"Chris was very accommodating and responded promptly when I had questions about the pull out sofa. The neighborhood was quiet and everything was reachable by walking or short uber trips. The listing really didn't disappoint, the hot tub was great and ready to go, all of the common areas were spacious and bright."
8054902,51602011,2015-10-21,13792447,John,David was a great host. Very attentive and friendly. Great place for the money. I really enjoyed the neighborhood too. Lots of great restaurants and drinking establishments. Close enough to the water to enjoy Lake Union and watch the sail boats and amazing city skyline on short walks. I really felt at home in the apartment. Look forward to returning if the opportunity arises.
8054902,52258687,2015-10-27,45853657,Kayli,"The listing is just as it looks in the picture.  Nice and comfortable.  We didn't cook while we were there, but we could have as the kitchen had plenty of pots and pans, utensils, etc.

David was really welcoming and friendly, providing a list of good places to eat and things to do and also making suggestions throughout our stay.  

The location was a great choice too.  There are several restaurants, breweries, bakeries, and sights to see all within walking distance."
8054902,52989109,2015-11-03,13585263,Celia,"David was a very attentive, personable and communicative host. Both he and Pillow were easily accessible, and David was so kind, sending recommendations on dinner and letting us know about day-of events happening in the area. And the location was great - right near a concert we were attending. The space was perfect - a full 2-bedroom apartment really. Everything we needed was there, and we felt comfortable and at home the whole time. This is a great spot to spend a weekend, or even a few weeks.  "
8054902,53772464,2015-11-12,47502386,Jeanne,"My  visit to Seattle was made so much more enjoyable knowing that at the end of the day, I had a quiet, comfortable and safe place to return.  Loved being only minutes from my daughter in Wallingford or the market, shops and restaurants in Fremont. Great space, great hosts. Will return."
8054902,54329768,2015-11-18,16156858,Victoria,"Upon arrival we were immediately greeted by David. Prior to leaving, he was super accommodating and messaged me back and forth making sure everything was in order. We needed to check in earlier than 3pm and he made the arrangements so that we were allowed to. David definitely made us feel welcomed and our stay at Seattle just that much better! The apartment was filled with super cute decor and everything was available to us. "
8054902,55004113,2015-11-27,23527155,Heather,"This was our most wonderful Air B&B experience to date. The house was incredibly warm and cosy, everything was really clean, kitchen well equipped and some very nice reading material too. We loved the Fremont location, and loved being able to walk to all the shops, a nice supermarket and Frelard Pizza which is the most kid friendly restaurant I've ever been to. The house had a box of toys which was a perfect distraction for the kids in the evening. Host was incredibly responsive, and gave us some wonderful tips for our stay. "
8054902,56196164,2015-12-10,48636758,Hoyt,Great Freemont street level apartment that was perfect for our stay.  It was very clean and walking distance to restaurants. It was easy to get into downtown and the offstreet parking spot was a bonus.
8054902,56705445,2015-12-16,7340672,Beth,My husband and I loved this Airbnb. The location is great for Fremont - walkable to all Fremont bars and restaurants.  A great location to see Ballard and Fremont.  
8054902,56815121,2015-12-18,27979215,Salman,"The Airbnb is conveniently located in Fremont, walkable to shops, restaurants, and the cultural hub of the Fremont neighborhood. The space is clean and crisp, it includes a kitchen and can sleep up to 6. A great alternative for a family - given hotels in Seattle can run north of $250 a night. It comes with a free parking spot, which is a bonus. Highly recommended. 5 stars. "
8054902,57252623,2015-12-23,40399906,Jason,The place was great and met our needs perfectly!  If family comes into town again we will surely look to have them stay there again

5618094,41473310,2015-08-07,6320317,Gary,"Our host was out of town, but her roommate was welcoming and helpful. The apartment was spacious with a fabulous view of the skyline from the deck and bedroom.
The location was great close to public transit and great neighborhood restaurants. The bed was v comfortable. "
5618094,41678019,2015-08-08,39086930,Olivia,Beautiful views of the space needle and the ocean. Room looks just like it is pictured. Comfortable bed and very close to downtown.
5618094,48546770,2015-09-27,31655805,Emily,"Staying in the ""heart of Capitol Hill"" was amazing! We were right in the center of the action with all the bars and boutiques walkable. Only a quick jaunt from the Pie Bar (yes pie and cocktails) and another that keeps Moscow Mules on tap. Who can complain? The room was adorable and guides to Seattle were a sweet touch that made us feel welcome and definitely more informed. Thanks Kathleen!"
5618094,51520612,2015-10-20,1161228,Shigeru,The host canceled this reservation 37 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

It is situated in Capitol Hill, one of the coolest neighborhoods in Seattle.
Tons of restaurants, shops and clubs right around the corner.
Even if Kathleen is not at home, you will be able to share the apartment with two super-friendly and easy-going roommates.
The view from Kathleen's room is amazing and she was even so kind to supply me with tons of shampoo, body wash, and even Ibuprofen!
Thumbs up!"
7402861,41281307,2015-08-05,39862858,Chris,"Nice, very clean room in a quiet neighborhood. It was very quick drive to everywhere we wanted to go. Evelyn was extremely nice and helpful. She even helped us find an eagle's nest in a near by park. "
7402861,49011585,2015-09-30,25420224,Ian,"I can readily summarize the experience of staying as a guest in Evelyn's home by saying that I was made to feel like a guest at 
a classy B&B.  

The accommodations themselves account in  part for this 
(the room I stayed in  was spacious and well furnished and 
I was allowed free access to the kitchen and living room 
and the use of the bathroom and laundry facilities) but the determining factor was Evelyn's qualities as a hostess: for 
the duration of my stay she extended to me a degree of hospitality exceeding the  duties and obligations of that 
role.

To give just one example: Immediately upon my arrival she 
took the time to sit down with me and take me through an orientation of the neighborhood and surrounding areas, 
complete with hand drawn maps. 

Her home is in located in a residential neighborhood in the environs of Columbia City, a small but lively commercial 
district supporting an array of shops and small businesses 
as well as restaurants, bars and coffee shops. There is also a  
nearby rail link station offering eas y access to both Sea/Tac Airport and downtown Seattle.

I thus enjoyed the benefit of staying in a quiet and secluded environment without any sense of isolation or feeling of being 
cut off from the life of the city at large.

In all I would commend Evelyn as a host to anyone sojourning 
in the Seattle area.   

"
7402861,53025979,2015-11-03,14012678,George,"Evelyn was very gracious and welcoming. I initially needed a place for a week because my new place wasn't going to be ready in time, but when my new landlord told me the delay would only be a couple of days instead of a week Evelyn was very accommodating. She lives in a very quiet, well-kept home with lots of charm that is situated between Lake Washington and Columbia City. I work at a nearby hospital and worked a 12-hour shift on Monday, then had to leave very early the next morning, so she more than met my needs. I highly recommend staying with this host for any needs. Thanks, Evelyn!!!"
7402861,57039050,2015-12-21,13623169,Sergey,"Эвелин - прекрасная, гостеприимная хозяйка. Она создала для меня все условия, чтобы мне жилось комфортно. Дом стоит у озера Вашингтон. Рядом - прекрасный Сьюард парк, можно побегать. Место очень тихое, чистый воздух. Парковаться можно на улице бесплатно. До центра города 15 минут езды на машине. Я остался очень доволен."

Bathroom next to the room was also lovely with extra toiletries (to which I had to avail myself since I forgot my toothbrush).  Exactly as advertised.  He was a great.  Thanks for the room!"
9477539,56691165,2015-12-16,10337728,Dale,"Charlie's place is great. Very clean and a great location. Having a private bathroom next to the bedroom is a real plus for me.

Thanks again for everything.

3766866,17409153,2014-08-11,1316201,Julia,"Easily the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on! Seriously, I looked at the tag on the mattress so I could remember when I buy a new bed. The rest of the apartment was great, very clean and nicely decorated. The neighborhood is great, tons of restaurants and bars a short walk away. Highly recommended!"
3766866,19745532,2014-09-17,20708692,Tracy,"We had a great time visiting Ballard while staying at J. Lynn's place.  The condo was everything promised.  She provided us with a nice welcome letter that included several great suggestions for places to check out and restaurants to eat at, it was very helpful.  The neighborhood is great and the location is very convenient.  We were able to navigate Ballard and downtown without a car as public transit and the heart of Ballard were both within a few blocks.  The condo provided everything we needed, a comfortable bed, nice bathroom and a balcony.  This is a perfect place for people that want a great base for their Seattle adventure."
3766866,25417520,2015-01-15,4659347,Suzie And Dave,"Safe and quiet neighborhood. Conveniently located relative to immediate services, e.g. groceries; deli; restaurants; pubs; health club.
Accurately described by host. The transaction and process of using the home was painless with timely responses and good information."
3766866,32605756,2015-05-19,2037588,Stacy,This place made us fall even deeper in love with Seattle. Walking distance to tons of restaurants and shops. The apartment itself was very clean and we felt quite comfortable there. The loft gave it a very open feel. J.Lynn was very communicative and easy to work with. We highly recommend this space!
3766866,36018851,2015-06-24,10349937,Tatyana,"My husband and I absolutely enjoyed our stay at this beautiful, clean and cozy place. Great location - quiet and safe neighborhood just a couple blocks away from many great restaurants and shops. J.Lynn is easy and pleasant to communicate with - she left us clear instructions and recommendations about her apartment and the neighborhood and responded promptly to any questions we had. We highly recommend this place. 


"
3766866,39224529,2015-07-21,37005832,Oskar,"We had a great stay at J. Lynn's place. It's in a great location in Ballard: walking distance to restaurants, cafes, sights to see and things to do. Despite this, the area is very quiet. Apartment is equipped with everything we needed (and then some) and excellently furnished, including a bed another reviewer correctly pointed out as a highlight."
3766866,40125878,2015-07-28,36973547,Claire,"This spot was terrific! It was beautiful, well-equiped, and comfortable. The host emailed us just after we arrived to check on us. That was so reassuring in case anything went wrong.  The best coffee was three blocks away, and there were numerous restaurants to explore. Thanks so much for the perfect place from which to enjoy Seattle!"
3766866,41090257,2015-08-04,35600196,Rose,"The apartment has a dining/living room downstairs and a sleeping quarter on the loft.  It is clean and quite roomy for two.  It also has a parking space and wifi. The location is super convenient.  There are lots of restaurants within a short walk, and every Sunday there is a farmer's market at Market square.  We never met the host in person.  All communications were through emails or e-messages.  she is courteous and accommodating.  All in all we enjoyed our stay and had a very positive experience."
3766866,42128296,2015-08-11,34383717,Kathryn,"This was a very comfortable, clean, attractive, quiet apartment very near all the charming stores and restaurants of Ballard.  Although the host was not on hand upon my arrival, she advised me in advance about the easy pincode lock that gave access to the apartment along with a detailed description of the exterior which made it easy to spot at night when I arrived, and she checked in with me by text the next morning to make sure that all was as it should be and urged me to get in touch with her if any problem arose.  She also left an informative note with an excellent map and tips for the local area.  "
3766866,43114082,2015-08-17,39532429,Matt,"JLynn's condo was beautiful and in a perfect location. She was very conscientious about getting us info for check in and check out and responsive to any questions. Great host, would absolutely return next time we're in Seattle."
3766866,45053176,2015-08-31,21657401,Wendy,"We really enjoyed our stay at J. Lynn's condo. Located on a quiet street w our own parking spot, it was big, well decorated, and very clean.  The king sized bed was wonderful!  And it really was walking distance to the coolest resaurants, bars and shops in Ballard, one of the prettiest places we have ever stayed. "
3766866,47486390,2015-09-19,21303824,John,"Pictures don't do this place justice!  Very tidy, well appointed, comfy large bed, ultra quiet street (a bicycle-way, so cars avoid it) and just 4 blocks away on foot from all that wonderful Ballard trendiness."
3766866,57030267,2015-12-21,28474380,Steven,"I stayed here for a month and don't think I could have found a better place in Ballard. You can walk to practically everything awesome in 10 minutes or less - including grocery stores, restaurants, farmer market, and all the cool little boutique ballard shops -  and the neighborhood is still super quiet and safe. The apartment itself is equally as fantastic, with excellent decor, high ceilings, furnishings and appliances, and - as other reviewers have echoed - quiet possibly the most comfortable bed in the world (no joke). J lynn is a kind and caring person and fantastic host who is attentive to anything you may bring up, and always had little goodies for the place when I'd bump into her. I would HIGHLY recommend this place for short or long term stay"
3766866,58053470,2015-12-31,11639362,Kevin,"We had a wonderful stay with JLynn. Her condo is perfectly located, an easy walk from all of Ballard's hot spots and amenities. It's both very comfortable (with an excellent bed and shower) and tastefully decorated. JLynn was next door in case we needed anything, but we had the place to ourselves and total privacy. Thanks!"
7938153,45740930,2015-09-05,42904150,Kathy,"Excellent location in the Seward Park area.  Rudy and Mellisa were awesome and very accomodating for my early departures and late arrival each day.  Their favorite coffee shop, Cafe Vita - soon became my favorite, too.  Private bedroom and bath with a comfortable shared sitting/TV room, lots of closet and dresser space. "
7938153,46032098,2015-09-07,42132228,Jie,"Great host & hostess! 
Clean and nice master suite with comfortable queen bed.
We spent a good night in relaxing and regaining energy after a cruise trip.

Most of all, thank you so much to Rudy for picking us up and drop us off at the train station. Rudy, you are such a nice man that everybody will love to be a friend of yours!

Thank you so much! We had great time with you!"
7938153,47598564,2015-09-20,44215307,Tracy,"Out of spur in the moment, me and my boyfriend booked a flight to Seattle, with no plans/hotel/car rentals at all. As soon as I saw this modern home I requested right away, and I was so surprised that Melissa replied immediately. (what an Angel!) I was texting her all day for our luggage, I was so surprised that he asked Rudy to pick up our luggage at Pike place so we can go around the city freely, we were not even checked in yet! Their place is soo pretty, accurate in the listing, relaxing and comfortable! Private bathroom is a plus too. They made us feel at home with their own home. Also Rudy toured us around the city & dropped us off the King's train station on our last day in Seattle! We were so blessed to find this spot, I would definitely recommend Modern home to my family and friends! Thank you so much Melissa and Rudy for accommodating us and for welcoming us to your place! 5 stars with flying colors!!! "
7938153,48364898,2015-09-25,23944986,Mark,"Our stay with Melissa was wonderful! The property is located in outer suburbia in a very tranquil setting at the end of a long, private drive. In the backyard is a quiet neck of Puget Sound. We were lucky to visit in great weather, when glistening Mt. Rainer dominated the skyline. There's a small market roughly a mile up the road, but it's a long drive to the wonderful restaurants at Gig Harbor. Our hosts were very punctual, helpful and friendly, without being obtrusive. We consider this property to be a great value."
7938153,48838864,2015-09-28,2186013,Yonit,"We loved staying here! Clean space, comfortable bed, great little sitting area, and a gracious and welcoming host. Couldn't ask for more! Lake Washington was gorgeous, we enjoyed the quiet neighborhood, and it was especially nice to be so close to the park and surrounded by the trees."
1618842,9868124,2014-01-15,9956835,Jennifer,"I recently moved from LA to Seattle for work and needed a temporary place to live while finding a permanent home.  I took a chance on Julie and Jeff’s studio apartment as the Ballard location and pictures were enticing. I was a little hesitant at first since there weren't any reviews yet as they had just launched on airbnb, but my hesitation quickly diminished upon arrival. Julie greeted me warmly and the apartment was incredibly clean (a must for me), decorated well, and stocked with a ton of goodies a corporate apartment does not have (snacks, drinks, fresh towels, 3 kinds of coffee pots!, cleaning supplies, and more).  The location is close to the Stoup Brewery for craft beer fans, near the beautiful Burke Gilman Trail which is great for bike rides, and in walking distance to downtown Ballard.  Downtown Ballard is a great area with many charming area with many restaurants, cool little shops, and their famous farmers market.  Street parking was readily available in front of the apartment (and it’s free parking!).  Julie was also very on top of making sure I was comfortable and had everything I needed.  Overall, my stay here was very pleasant and helped ease my transition to a new city. A bonus, I got some great decorating ideas as the apartment has a great blend of colors and decor."
1618842,9960969,2014-01-21,3958623,Alena,"We had a great time staying at Julie and Jeff's little studio. The space was really cozy and very clean.  The space was really nicely put together with great attention to detail. Really nice towels, bathroom and amenities. The bed was super comfy. I especially liked the nice coffee and sparkling water in the fridge. The space was pleasant and had nice light.  Also, great snacks! The location was excellent for walking and easy to get to and from. Julie was great to communicate with and very flexible to our needs. We felt they really cared about making the space as comfortable as possible. A very sweet family and lovely experience. I would definitely recommend their space to a friend!"
1618842,10024104,2014-01-26,8689675,Haley,"Julia and Jeff have a wonderful little spot in a really fun area of town! My husband and I only stayed for a short time but it was comfy, private, and clean. I would recommend you stay with the Angeleys for both long term and short term stays. Thanks for the hospitality! "
1618842,10246873,2014-02-09,6532581,Finbar,"Jeff and Julie are great hosts. Communication was easy and everything is just as described. I loved this space and I loved the location.
 
The space has 12 foot ceilings and concrete floors with radiant heat. It is well equipped including washer/dryer which came in very handy on my 2 week stay. Jeff and Julie left out fruit and other tasty snacks. Lots of options for the coffee lover.
 
Location is easy walking distance to the center of the very popular Ballard area. Lots of great options for eating, drinking and live music. I hope to stay again on my next trip to Seattle."
1618842,10295422,2014-02-11,4731169,Aliya,"Our stay with Julie and Jeff was a dream.  They are such a cool family and the suite is spacious but cozy, clean and well styled with an eye for design.  Location is excellent for Ballard explorations, with Ballard Ave shops and restaurants a walk away, but still in a quiet peaceful (website hidden) lovers, there are a number of microbreweries within stumbling distance, some with rotating food trucks parked nearby.  Julie and Jeff were easy to communicate with, wonderful resources on the area, and just really awesome people.  We were sad to leave our new Seattle getaway but look forward to staying with the Angeleys on our next trip down!"
1618842,10434907,2014-02-18,1409323,Nikki,"This is my first time booking on Airbnb and I could not have had a better experience! My partner and I stayed at the studio for a weekend; we were thoroughly impressed with the space (clean, inviting, and stocked with delicious snacks) and it's close proximity to breweries, restaurants, and shops. Julie and Jeff were great hosts and made sure we have everything we needed. I would definitely book with them again on my next trip to Seattle!"
1618842,10568925,2014-02-25,6927676,Summer,"I don't even know where to begin!  We had such a wonderful stay at Jeff and Julie's place.  They really have thought of every little detail in order to make you feel at home.  We visit Seattle about twice a year and will definitely be choosing their place again next time around!  The location is perfect, walking distance to the heart of Ballard where we generally spend alot of our time.  Street parking is easy and we loved the brewery across the street.  My fiance even found the amazing breakfast taco truck in the area, thanks to a very helpful guide they left in the apt for us.  The snack, drinks, coffee and tea was such a nice touch too.

Julie even went beyond the call of duty by helping me orchestrate a surprise third guest (my fiance's friend who showed up as a surprise in Seattle).  She hid the bedding for the futon so that my fiance wouldn't suspect anything.  And the place was very comfortable for three people, so if you are debating that, trust that it will work just fine.

Can't say enough great things about this place!  My only fear is that the word will get out and they'll be booked solid next time we want to visit! :)

"
1618842,10619287,2014-02-28,351397,Christine,"Julie and Jeff have created a fantastic place that I hope to have the pleasure of staying in again the next time I visit Seattle.  You will find details everywhere that show how much thought has gone into preparing the studio for guests from snacks, drinks, toiletries, more.  It felt like the roomiest studio I've ever stayed in, certainly the biggest bathroom!  Everything was spotless and the radiant heat was incredibly pleasant.  I also loved the location as it was super quiet(the chickens didn't bother me, I found them entertaining) but easy to get around, either by bus or walking(close to Walrus and Carpenter!).  I was sorry to leave so quickly but will definitely return!"
1618842,10744386,2014-03-05,11904357,Sandra,Great apartment in an awesome neighborhood. The studio had everything I needed and more. Definitely one of the most comfortable beds I've slept on. Thanks for the great stay!
1618842,10905707,2014-03-12,11676522,Sabriel,"Staying at the studio was a dream. The place is immaculate, stylish, quirky, and the hosts thought of everything! The location was perfect, you can walk to shops, bars, and awesome restaurants. They let us borrow bikes, visit their chickens, and even loaned me a yoga mat. Next time I'm in Seattle I'm definitely staying here again!"
1618842,10981824,2014-03-16,6276634,Nate,We had an amazing time staying here. We had a few requests (due to a 2 year old) and they went above and beyond making sure our stay was comfortable. We would highly recommend staying here. We hope to stay again!
1618842,11179364,2014-03-24,5401518,Diane,"I had a wonderful time staying in Julie and Jeff's charming space. I loved the creative spirit of both the studio and yard beyond, and especially the quirky mix of backyard chickens in this hipster (but quiet) area. The space itself is extremely well appointed with thoughtful items that may (and do) come in handy, the bed is wonderful and Julie and Jeff are kind and gracious hosts. I'm a regular traveler to Seattle and look forward to staying again with Julie and Jeff. "
1618842,11261669,2014-03-27,11937891,Steven,"First things first, Jeff and Julie are wonderful hosts.  Super friendly and very cool people!  They had snacks and coffee stocked in the kitchen and toiletries in the bathroom just in case you forgot something.  

As for the place, it was perfect!  Amazing overhead door that is perfect for a sunny day.  Bed was really comfortable, and the place stayed nice and comfortable with the radiant floor heating system.  Loved it!

Thanks to Jeff for showing us the chickens and to Julie for the local knowledge."
1618842,11456463,2014-04-03,4308320,Ming,"Julie has a super adorable studio, perfect for a girls trip to the city. Walking distance from downtown Ballard and several 24 hr grocery stores. Easy to pick up the Burke-Tillman trail and walk or bike all the way to Fremont. Quieter part of town (which we loved) and easy parking, but close to all your amenities. Had a fantastic time, and the snacks Julie left for us we're great for our excursions and hike! Only thing to note, though, is that there isn't a stove, but there is a microwave and toaster oven. Otherwise, everything was great. Thanks, Julie!!"
1618842,11583744,2014-04-08,4517445,Caitlin,"Jeff and Julie have a great place here!  It was very clean, organized and well decorated.  This is a great location, right across the street from a micro-brewery and a short walk to downtown Ballard.  We appreciated the delicious organic snacks.  We highly recommend this loft for a Seattle trip!!"
1618842,11652408,2014-04-10,6047253,Michelle,"We had a great time in Seattle. The studio was roomy and light.  The bed was very comfortable. It was an easy walk to get groceries and to restaurants and bars.  Julie and jeff had a book of walking tours and maps to help find your way around.  We had friends in the neighborhood,  so we didnt borrow the bikes that they had for guests to uuse.  Julie was even nice enough to let us stay a little later in the afternoon so we didnt have to haul our stuff to lunch or downtown while we waited for our train back to portland. We would definitely stay here again and will suggest it to our friends . Thanks again, Julie!"
1618842,12128901,2014-04-23,1832171,Bj,"Amazing place. The reviews and photos are spot on. Julie I the consummate host. She helped with directions to the place and to local eateries. 

The studio had great decor.  There was also a huge basket of granola, Organic snacks and fruit. Plus the fridge was packed with great water and other refreshments. 

Skip the hotel, stay with Julie & Jeff"
1618842,12344288,2014-04-29,3798013,A,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Julie and Jeff's studio over a long weekend at the end of April. We loved our time there. The apartment is in a great location--you can walk to a variety of restaurants, cafes, breweries, and stores with ease. The apartment itself is lovely. It had everything we needed and the bed was one of the most comfortable we've ever slept on. We would definitely recommend this place to anyone going to Seattle. "
1618842,12534203,2014-05-05,12446367,Danielle,"I don't have much to add, mostly echoing the positive reviews here! The space is good sized, nicely appointed, and we loved the big garage door to open up on a nice day, not to mention the cool brewery across the street. Took public transportation our whole time there and easily ventured to/from the airport as well as into nearby Ballard and Fremont, Greenlake, downtown, West Seattle, and down to SoDo for the Sounders game. Nice location, kind and accessible hosts. If we weren't moving into town, we'd surely think of this spot for another visit, and may well direct friends/family this way when they come into town. Thanks!"
1618842,14145119,2014-06-13,5709303,Martha,"We had a wonderful experience staying with Jeff & Julie.  They did an amazing job setting up the studio.  We loved the modern, light filled space.  Even though it was a small place, there seemed to be plenty of room for our stuff because of the smart choices in furnishings and utensils made by our hosts.  The neighborhood is a vibrant mix of residential, workshops and breweries.  Grocery store is close too.   We opted to rent a car and felt it was a good decision.  We loved the way the apt. can be opened up to the outdoors.   This is a great place to stay!"
1618842,14350108,2014-06-17,14771927,Jennifer,"The studio was more than we had hoped for, and in a better location than we expected. It was easy to get to and we needed to go back into Seattle several times, which was very easy. We appreciated the snacks, since we were on the go."
1618842,14730520,2014-06-25,9285076,Jeannessa,"My experience with our stay was positive! We stayed here for three nights and loved the area. It is around the local breweries (across the street from Stoups!), near excellent food options (El Camión, anyone?!), and just a hop and a skip from downtown Ballard. Fremont is quite near as well. There are close shopping areas and local public transit is just two blocks away. My husband and I made use of the bikes and that really helped us get around (usually on the Burke Gilman bike trail). Jeff and Julie were very helpful and kind. They stocked the refrigerator with milk, soy milk, snack cheese, and cream. There were selections of wholesome food and gummy bears in the kitchen! It was clean and adorable. Definitely has activity going on around it though, so helps to maintain your own privacy and just enjoy the sounds of life and activity! "
1618842,14976379,2014-06-30,4323119,Sagal,"Julie and Jeff's place was amazing, the studio was just perfect and loved the snacks they left for us in the studio. Well kept and very clean, the area was in a perfect location close walk to all Ballard Shops and we took uber, and the bus to get to other places, but the commute was not long. The bikes were also nice to have to ride to grab coffee or crepes near by! Definitely coming back to Seattle and staying at this amazing studio! "
1618842,15097266,2014-07-02,5644267,Lindsay,"We had a terrific stay at Julie & Jeff's. The room was adorable, very clean, and they even left out some snacks. Very accommodating hosts, too, and easy to work with. The studio is in Ballard close to the main street, which is a very fun neighborhood (though a 10 min Uber from downtown)."
1618842,15195452,2014-07-04,2693887,Sean,"Julie and Jeff's place was absolutely great. Location worked out well: it's just a couple minute walk from Ballard Ave. And the unit itself is great. Has everything you need (even a brand new washer and dryer), and Julie and Jeff provided a bunch of snacks, drinks, etc.

Highly recommend, and would definitely stay again.

"
1618842,15309706,2014-07-07,7479055,Sarah,"This was such a wonderful place to stay! We could not have asked for a more beautiful and well-thought out apartment, nor nicer hosts. We arrived in Seattle after camping in Olympic National Park without running water for three days, and were greeted by a quirky, comfortable place, incredible amenities (including washer & dryer for which we were humbly grateful) and a well stocked pantry & fridge. Julie and Jeff were so welcoming, thoughtful and great people to chat with. The apartment is in a really fun neighborhood in Seattle and we enjoyed going to the Ballard farmers market, trying the micro-brewery literally across the street and riding the two cruiser bikes around the city. I could not recommend this place more highly! "
1618842,15858350,2014-07-17,12649771,Jessie,"We had a really lovely stay at Julie and Jeff's place. They were very welcoming, and everything was set up so nicely. Ballard is a really fun area to stay in, and we would love to stay at the studio again if we are ever back in Seattle! "
1618842,16059616,2014-07-21,13675328,Josh,"We are so grateful to have chosen to stay at Julie and Jeff's studio for our 5th anniversary.  Their hospitality exceeded our expectations - they were attentive but gave plenty of space and autonomy.  We kept saying that they were ""our kind of people"" in so many ways.  The studio was was just as it appeared in the pictures - beautiful and a great amount of space for two.  Loved the location - really convenient for getting all over Seattle.  We'll be spreading the word and would happily stay at the studio again if given the opportunity.  A great first experience using airbnb."
1618842,16205451,2014-07-23,14992101,Lauren,"My husband and I visited the Ballard studio while on vacation, and we really enjoyed our stay. The location is great; very fun neighborhood with cool restaurants and bars and only a short bus ride to downtown Seattle. The studio itself is perfect for two guests. The hosts really thought of everything in provisioning the studio, with coffee, tea, local magazines and books, snacks, etc. Also, it was really nice having a washer and dryer on site to do laundry. We would definitely stay here again on a future visit to Seattle!"
1618842,16653483,2014-07-31,7248896,Jamela,"We had a wonderful time staying in Julie and Jeff's loft-like apartment.  I absolutely loved how it was decorated and they thought of every amenity one could possibly need.  We felt very comfortable there for our week stay.  And the location was amazing- we could walk to Safeway, restaurants, a drug store and the brewery directly across the street.  I would stay here again in a heart beat.  Thanks again.  :)  "
1618842,16823020,2014-08-03,1658275,Kat,"We really loved staying at this cool studio in Ballard. Super cute decor, plus it's really spacious. We were so happy to be able to do our laundry (after many days of camping.) Also, it was so nice to borrow the cruisers and bike all over Seattle. Highly recommend staying here!"
1618842,17045765,2014-08-06,16085801,Daniel,"We had a wonderful time staying here. The apartment is comfortable and has easy access to both Fremont and Ballard. Plus, the fresh coffee, snacks, and brewery across the street offer everything you could need. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. "
1618842,17280408,2014-08-10,110755,Christopher,"We were very comfortable in Julie and Jeff's loft. It's a beautifully designed, light-filled, and clean space. Our hosts were hospitable and attentive and the studio came well stocked (with snacks and plenty of local info). The location was ideal and convenient. We highly recommend their place and hope to return again someday soon."
1618842,17434094,2014-08-12,7030130,Suzanna,"This little studio was perfect. And exactly as described. Maybe cooler actually. Located in industrial Ballard surrounded by breweries. Spacious, clean and convenient-we had been on the road for 3 weeks already and having powerful washer and dryer was very welcomed. High ceilings. Comfortable queen bed and couch. The modern industrial garage door is fun and practical. They compose. If you like urban loft living this is your place. 
We met Julie and Jeff and liked them immediately. Jeff has a big workshop in the back and chickens. Yes, chickens. And a turkey-and a chicken that thinks he is a turkey. We will be back for sure.
Thank you!"
1618842,17611241,2014-08-15,13872560,Sunny,"Julie was great!  She was available to answer questions and give suggestions when we needed them and we really appreciated that!  The flat was clean and cozy, the bikes were a super fun addition and the neighborhood was happening!  Overall a great stay!  "
1618842,17935351,2014-08-19,8081753,Laura,"We LOVED our experience at the Ballard Studio. The space is wonderfully decorated and has everything we could need (including coffee, tea, snacks, etc.)  The location is great as well-- within walking distance to many great restaurants, coffee shops, breweries, and an easy bus ride into downtown. We would love to stay here next time we come to Seattle! Julie & Jeff were great hosts and provided clear and easy directions to the apartment. "
1618842,18465647,2014-08-27,13871182,Jd,We really enjoyed staying at Julie & Jeff's apartment.  The apartment was just as described. Food items and drinks helped us get through first hours of settling in and their coffee beans provided us with great morning coffee. The warehouse/factory nature of the area gave us some concern but it turned out to be quite and safe. Car parked on the street around the corner with no problems. Julie and Jeff are personable people who made sure we had everything we needed - didn't really need anything as the apartment met our requirements. We enjoyed their little farmyard with chickens and a turkey in a fenced area next to the apartment.  All the local tourist info in the basket was also very helpful. We would stay their again except that our son and his family moved to another area of Seattle while we were staying at Julie & Jeff's.
1618842,18530928,2014-08-28,16346083,Debbie,"We had a great time staying at the studio in Ballard - great area to explore with fun shops and restaurants.  We loved the nearby neighborhood of Fremont as well.  The studio was CLEAN, comfortable and Julie and Jeff made us feel very welcome with everything we needed in the studio. Thanks! "
1618842,19132788,2014-09-07,9105429,Lindsay,"If you want to stay in Ballard, I'm not sure why you would stay anywhere else. The location is awesome; we could have thrown a rock and hit Stoup Brewery, walked around to the corner to another, and then another. Not to mention you are walking distance away from Ballard shopping, restaurants, Percy's cocktails, the locks, etc. We were coming from staying in downtown Seattle, so I can't answer the accessibility to downtown from Ballard, but we were able to drive to our reservation in Capitol Hill with ease (about 10 min). But aside from how great the location is, the space itself is wonderful. Very cool decor, very comfortable, and Julie and Jeff have thought of every amenity that one might need while traveling. There was soy milk and regular milk, excellent coffee, and a plethora of healthy snacks laid out for us upon arrival. Robes, slippers, washer and dyer, extra pillows and blankets, and the option to take out their cruisers while you're there. We showed up on a Thursday and the street was a bit crowded with brewery goers, but our hosts were kind enough to let us park in the driveway until the crowd died down a bit. Julie checked in with us when we first arrived to make sure we were comfortable, and assured us we could contact her or Jeff with any questions we might have. If you're looking for somewhere to stay in Seattle, this space and the host are legit, and I highly recommend it! We will be staying here next time we're in Seattle."
1618842,19310409,2014-09-10,14189709,Jeremiah,"We had a great time at the apt!  Very clean, very industrial and in a great neighborhood close to Ballard.  We would definitely stay here again.  "
1618842,19514334,2014-09-14,5577548,Joanne,Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. Julie and Jeff have thought of everything to make staying at this Ballard gem the ultimate experience! Healthy snacks when you need a pick up? Check. Bikes to get around the coolest parts of town? Check. (Though do be warned-cruisers are a bit tough to ride on the Seattle hills). Central to two of the best breweries in Seattle? Check. This place is like home away from home. We loved it and didn't want to leave! 
1618842,19677355,2014-09-16,1525030,Elijah,"We cannot say enough great things about our stay at Julie and Jeff's! The studio was a fun, convenient location. The interior was beautiful and perfectly accommodating. The offered bikes were a fun change from public transportation. And while we didn't meet Jeff, we very much enjoyed our conversations with Julie, she made herself easily accessible if we needed anything. 

Thank you so much Jeff and Julie!"
1618842,20565713,2014-10-01,4764353,Isabelle,"Our stay at private studio in Ballard was more than perfect! Julie was there at our arrival and gave us good tips for our stat! There's great restaurant on Ballard Avenue at 5 min. From the studio. It is also really easy to go downtown using the bus, it's a 20 minutes ride. The studio was really clean at our arrival and the mattress is really comfortable. Julie left a basket full of organic snack that was really convenient after a long day exploring the city!!  We really recommend this studio! "
1618842,20944359,2014-10-08,15324298,Kimball,"They set up a pack n play for our 9 month old with some toys in it.  When they saw that we liked to dine al fresca, they set up a table with two chairs for us."
1618842,21138931,2014-10-12,12166540,Jason,"Had a great time in Ballard! The location was perfect and all it took was a little drive to get anywhere in the area. If we didn't want to drive a quick walk would result in great food in different Seattle districts. The location allowed us to absorb ""real"" experiences of how people in the area live."
1618842,21276550,2014-10-14,13875783,Emily,"My partner and I arrived to the space later in the evening than we expected, but all was just as described- and beautiful to boot! It was a perfect space, chalk full of anything one could want or need to make their stay comfortable. I really feel like the hosts didn't over look a single thing when preparing this property, and I would happily have friends/guests stay with them in the future! The garage door was so nice to have open on the main day we stayed here (we were prepping for a wedding), it made life so much easier in general as well as added natural light galore! I truly appreciate airBnb hosts who have properties this lovely, and happily recommend Julie and Jeff to all!"
1618842,21871249,2014-10-26,1555398,Nadia,"Endroit extra, les hôtes sont génial tout était parfait.Un grand merci."
1618842,22135656,2014-10-31,18659856,Matthew,"I unfortunately was not able to stay at Jeff and Julie's due to travel plans being canceled last minute. It is important to note though, that throughout the communication during booking process was well above any of my expectations and the next work trip I have out to the west cost this will be the first place I try to book."
1618842,22499126,2014-11-08,1822476,Kiara,"Really great place to stay in the Seattle area, little breakfast snacks, shower stuff, and heated floors. The brewery's are super close. Jeff and Julie will lend you some bikes if you need it. They give you your space when it comes to hosting. I'd say their studio is an ideal place to stay for anyone looking to tour Seattle, off the tourist path. (Plus you can bring your dog)"
1618842,22593475,2014-11-10,3966522,Stacey,"Julie and Jeff's place was perfect for our weekend away. They left really detailed info about the apartment and area around so it was easy to get settled in and feel at home.

It's just a quick walk to downtown Ballard and there's a neat brewery right across the street."
1618842,22722451,2014-11-12,14250423,Craig,"Jeff & Julie's suite in Ballard was great. It hjd all the amenities you could need and more; as good as staying at a hotel but with the comforts of home. The location in Ballard is also great; tucked away in a cool industrial/residential area, but walking distance to shops and restaurants. The Trader Joe's a few blocks away was also a plus.

The only downsides would be the noisy chickens in the yard and but nothing that would deter me from staying again."
1618842,22905460,2014-11-17,22817053,Gerrie,"This is a great place to stay.  It is immaculately clean.  The amenities are excellent, including: snacks, washer/dryer, kitchen with refrigerator, microwave and dishes.  It is well located near stores and downtown Ballard.  It is exactly as presented in the Airbnb posting."
1618842,23322655,2014-11-29,748418,Jared & Katie,"We were in town for Thanksgiving so never got to meet Julie and Jeff in person, but that didn't stop them from making us feel welcome. The studio is in a great location (across the street from a brewery), it's well stocked with basic amenities and offers three different ways of making coffee. Despite the driving rain, we had a couple of great days. We'll definitely try to rebook for future visits."
1618842,23621616,2014-12-07,4900719,Matthew,"Amazing stay, the location was simply perfect (and with so many breweries nearby how can you go wrong). Really short walk to so many transport options as well.

The studio was just as advertised, neat and tidy, all amenities which was so helpful, and wholesome snacks on our arrival which was most generous, and most appreciated. 

We loved our stay, no hassles and would highly recommend."
1618842,23810975,2014-12-11,2356946,Steven,"My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at Julie and Jeff's studio. The place was perfect -- nice kitchen area, washer/dryer and a spacious bathroom too. Plus, coffee, tea and snacks were left out for us which was really nice. Julie and Jeff were lovely people. I highly recommend their studio."
1618842,24058505,2014-12-18,3223090,Matthew,"The most awesome of spots! They leave awesome snacks and great instructions on how to get around in the area. 

Would visit again! 
"
1618842,24924032,2015-01-04,12125494,Rielle,We stayed at Julie and Jeff's studio over the Christmas holiday 2014.  This place worked very well for us.  It is very clean and well designed. Nice bathroom and new washer/dryer.   Comfortable bed. Nice and quiet. They are great hosts. 
1618842,25419830,2015-01-15,10263369,Peter,We had a wonderful experience throughout our stay at Julie and Jeff's home. Their location is close to a ton of places in Ballard and Ballard itself is a beautiful community. We highly recommend staying at their place when visiting Seattle. The home is very clean and comfortable and supplied with everything one may need. Having a washer/dryer in the unit was also a nice extra. They even set up a pack and play and left baby books and toys for our new baby! Julie and Jeff were also readily available when we had any questions. From our family to theirs we are thankful. :)
1618842,25576410,2015-01-19,1181923,J & J,"what a gem!  adorable space - they're lucky I left because I legitimately want to move in.  Great part of town, easy to retrieve lock, good communication by hosts.  Thoughtful touches in the kitchen as well.  Would absolutely stay again & recommend to friends.  "
1618842,25848869,2015-01-27,6033643,Jason,Cute space.  Yummy snacks.  Great location.  A+. Would stay again. 
1618842,26596225,2015-02-16,11105374,Lauren,"The listing was as described-very industrial feel, yet warm and cozy. Julie was very accessible and I was delighted to stay-my boyfriend loved the birthday surprise trip! Thank you for the warm welcome and for the travel maps you provided-very helpful."
1618842,27253910,2015-03-01,6532581,Finbar,"I've stayed in a few Airbnb's and this one is my favourite. Great space, perfect location and Jeff and July are always easy to deal with and very helpful."
1618842,27473036,2015-03-05,22817053,Gerrie,This was our second stay with Julie and Jeff.  The place is terrific.  Ultra clean.  Everything is as stated in the description.  Hope to stay there again on our next visit.
1618842,27653478,2015-03-09,9998637,Alexander,This place is awesome. Excellent price and the coolest neighborhood in Seattle. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to stay in a hip neighborhood with tons of amazing restaurants and bars in walking distance!
1618842,27834264,2015-03-13,25233900,Amber,"Julie was great with communication from the very beginning. We did not get the pleasure to meet her or Jeff, but instructions were very clear and helpful. Ballard is a great neighborhood. I'd say it's important to know that this place is in Industrial Ballard and is a little walk (15 minutes or so) from the main Ballard area, which has an awesome record store (Bop Records) and a lot of restaurants. This listing is very close to a bus stop (3 blocks or less) that will take you downtown in 20 minutes with no transfers. It's also a bonus to be close to the Fremont area via bus. It's full of boutiques, bars, and restaurants. Thank you, Julie and Jeff for being great hosts! "
1618842,28388781,2015-03-23,25717040,Rachel,"These are a few of my favorite things about the stay at Julie & Jeff's:  fluffy white robes in the bathroom, an abundance of clean linens, a well-rounded snack bar, including fruits and coffee fixings, in a well-equipped kitchenette.  The bed is sooo comfortable, and the apartment is situated in the back of the well-insulated house with a lot of privacy.  Ballard is an interesting mix of industrial, residential and commercial that is quiet at night and is just a short drive or bus trip to Seattle.  I was completely happy with this, my first Airbnb experience, and can highly recommend Julie & Jeff's.  "
1618842,28566040,2015-03-26,22762224,Kirsten Joie,"Although I was not able to personally meet Julie and Jeff, I still felt very welcomed and at home during my stay in Seattle! Their studio was the perfect size; comfortable and well heated for us Californians who were not used to the Seattle cold weather. We also really appreciated that you kept in contact with us throughout our stay and the snacks that you provided in the kitchen! The place was also conveniently located near public transportation, which made it easier for us to travel around the city. Thank you for the wonderful stay, Julie and Jeff! We hope to come back again! "
1618842,28799978,2015-03-30,1834586,Stephanie,"This little spot was lovely: equipped with snacks, maps, soaps and towels and a very comfy bed. Julie gave us great info prior to our arrival and we found the spot with no problem on our own. We did arrive when Julie was there to personally give us her take on the neighborhood and its breweries (Ballard is the burgeoning ""brewer's district"" of Seattle and my husband is a big aficionado so this was a highlight for us). Nice brewery directly across the street, easy access to multiple supermarkets (there is a toaster oven, fridge, and microwave in the studio) and bus lines into downtown Seattle. We would definitely stay again on our next trip."
1618842,29005448,2015-04-02,7517981,Jennifer,"The studio was great! Beautiful, clean space; hotel-like fluffy towels & bathrobes; a basket of treats to warm the kitchen; etc. A wonderful starting place from which to explore Ballard. We arrived very late after a crazy flight delay, and it was so great to arrive at a place of our own that felt like home. Julie & Jeff were wonderful hosts - great communicators & very friendly. "
1618842,30020279,2015-04-16,19586655,Kristina,"What a great experience! Julie & Jeff have really thought out this space to make it super accommodating for short or long stays. We were there for two weeks and it was just about perfect - esp. having access to a washer/dryer right in the studio and three different ways to make coffee! Julie was always very responsive to any requests we had throughout our stay - bringing some additional supplies to us, etc. I worked part-time from the studio and the wireless was very good (if that is a consideration for anyone).

The space is as pictured, some of the furnishings are slightly different than the pictures, but nothing shocking. It's really just a cool little studio, very functional and very well thought out - I'm a fan of the industrial look so I loved the aesthetic along with the functionality. Really just overall a great experience. We'll definitely recommend to any friends going to the Seattle area looking for a comfortable place to stay.

As for the Ballard area, it is super convenient too - we walked to a new restaurant (~15 minute walk from the studio) every night. You can (almost) literally throw a stone in any direction to hit a brewery in the area. Stoup is right across the street and has a delicious food truck outside on most nights (making it easy to grab a bite if you're tired from exploring all day). Our favorite brewery in the area was Peddler Brewing, a short walk up the way. In addition to easy eating and drinking, the studio is a short walk from several bus stops that will connect you to different parts of town and a short walk from convenience and grocery stores. Super easy to get anywhere you want from here (bus timeliness is another story, but unrelated to the review of this space).

All in all - awesome spot. Highly recommend. Thanks!"
1618842,30220398,2015-04-19,19182053,Jadelyn,"This studio is a wonderful spot to stay at! It's clean, super cute, functional, comfortable and located in an ideal location (right across from a great local brewery). I had a terrific experience and would highly recommend the spot! "
1618842,30390380,2015-04-21,20586778,Ashley,"I almost don't know where to begin! 

Between the Ballard Farmers Market, Stoup Brewery across the street, and the worlds most comfortable bed---we cannot express how much we loved our stay with Julie & Jeff. 

Everything was beyond wonderful & it gave us a chance to explore as if we were locals. 

The robes, welcome basket & quick responses only made our experience even more seamless. Thank you so much! "
1618842,30611768,2015-04-25,11902553,Brett,"Julie and Jeff's studio was spacious comfortable and quiet. All the logistics went very smoothly and they were very welcoming. The location is in the heart of industrial Ballard, a safe an walk-able area with new businesses popping up every time I visit. Including some of the best nano-breweries I have found in any city!"
1618842,30785185,2015-04-27,29452726,Alexandria,I had a lovely experience with Julie. She was very welcoming and understanding. The apartment was in a great location and it was nice and clean. There was enough room for 3 people. Will be back again for sure in the future! Thanks Julie!  
1618842,31435928,2015-05-05,14038446,Stephanie,"We absolutely loved this studio. We were in town for a few days to explore the area and this was a great home base.  The area (Ballard) is beautiful and interesting.  Great restaurants all within about a mile. Breweries and food trucks also super close. And even though everything is so close, there is no noise pollution at all.

The studio itself is stocked with so many thoughtful details: snacks, coffee and tea, water, maps and guides, robes and slippers. My husband and I were very comfortable and we will definitely love to stay there again when we are next in the area."
1618842,31891279,2015-05-11,3781242,Suzanne,"We had an amazing experience at Julie and Jeff's studio.  It was one of the best stays we have had in our time with airbnb.  Check in/out was smooth.  Julie and Jeff were easy to communicate with and were accommodating with anything that could have come up during our stay. The studio is cozy and has everything you could need for your stay.  Julie and Jeff had a variety of tea, coffee and snacks set out for us and had clearly put a lot of heart into making it as comfortable as possible. There is a fridge in the studio as well as a washer and dryer.  The bed was comfy and had plenty of blankets and pillows.  Everything was neat and clean.  The location was great!  You could walk to some of the nearby breweries as well as to the shops and restaurants in the Ballard neighborhood. We would highly recommend it!"
1618842,32379727,2015-05-17,5415942,Josiane,This cozy place is an absolute jewel located in a great area. Julie and Jeff are the best hosts - they have put so much thought into every detail in this wonderful space. We were so comfortable and appreciative. 
1618842,33221132,2015-05-26,4685719,Allison,"The neighborhood is great -  we walked to breweries, restaurants, and parks with our dog, and there are lots of public transportation options to get downtown or elsewhere in the city. There were snacks and detailed information on the studio and neighborhood waiting when we arrived. Julie and Jeff checked in on us over the weekend to make sure everything was okay and see if we needed anything. The space is very creative and perfect for our stay. We would definitely stay there again! "
1618842,33527130,2015-05-29,5708746,Colin,"This place was awesome! Great location, plenty of privacy, and we felt so cool about ourselves waking up here :)"
1618842,34119083,2015-06-05,6868073,Esther,"Julie and Jeff's place is awesome. I want to move in. They have taken care making it gorgeous, cool, comfortable, and totally travel friendly. 

They went above and beyond to stock little treats for us, multiple methods of brewing local coffee, bikes, everything. 

We loved opening the glass garage door wall in the morning and getting ready for our Seattle day. 

Julie was amazingly accommodating - letting us check in early and out late. She quickly responded to every question. A great host. 

The area is industrial as advertized but there's tons to walk and bike to. Some of the nationally recognized restaurants that we'd read about and wanted to visit were located right near by.

We had an awesome stay and would definitely stay again. "
1618842,34524371,2015-06-09,12515963,Clancey,"Julie & Jeff's studio was a great home base for us to explore the Ballard neighborhood and the rest of the city. Bonus: the studio is walking distance from several breweries. The studio is comfortable, very nice, and had more amenities than expected (snacks, maps, bike rental). We'd definitely recommend staying here! "
1618842,35632780,2015-06-21,1678138,Jessica,"This apartment is located in walking distance many shops and restaurants in the Ballard district. Apt was clean, quiet and comfy. The only negative is the washer wasnt working. They left little snacks for us and there was a small fridge for us to use. It is directly across the a nice brewery. We never saw our hosts but they were friendly via email. I would visit this apartment again. "
1618842,36083436,2015-06-25,26874771,Meghan,"We absolutely loved everything about our stay: the location, the apartment, Ballard and the ease of communication. Julie and Jeff really went above and beyond to make this place a gem, providing a hip, well-designed and CLEAN space with lots of snacks and extra amenities. We took advantage of the cruisers and LOVED exploring the city. You can't beat the location if you want to be close to restaurants, cafes, breweries and/or the water. We would recommend this to anyone! "
1618842,36378924,2015-06-28,30716366,Kelvin,"The studio was more than I could have hoped for. Julie and Jeff did a great job setting up the place for our stay. The studio is very spacious and chic. They provided plenty of great amenities (for example: bikes, snacks, maps, neighborhood guides, coffee and tea, bath robes, etc.) The surrounding neighborhood is great. It is within walking distance to grocery stores, coffee shops, breweries and is only a 10-15 minute drive into downtown. There is plenty of street parking right in front of the house and is not a problem at all. Communication with Julie and Jeff was easy and responsive. the next time I'm in Seattle I would love to stay here again!"
1618842,36668451,2015-06-30,25792502,Kevin,"We really enjoyed staying at Julie and Jeff's Ballard studio. It's in a great location, walkable to the main Ballard strip and very easy to get downtown by car. The unit was very cozy and Jeff was very helpful in answering any questions we had. We also appreciated the snacks they provided."
1618842,37015938,2015-07-03,36998471,Benette,"Fun and funky space with charming touches wherever you look. The apartment is small but doesn't feel that way- every bit of space is used efficiently and effectively. Jeff and Julie left snacks and drinks for us which were much appreciated upon arrival. Comfy bed, luxurious shower, plush robes and towels, a generous kitchen sink... highly recommend. Jeff and Julie are friendly and helpful. We got a private tour of the chicken coup. This is a terrific place to stay in Seattle- and Stoup brewery is right across the street. They have delicious beer and a food truck is on site every night. Highly recommend!"
1618842,37554188,2015-07-08,27952898,Kristen,"Julie and Jeff were wonderful hosts, and this studio was perfect for our stay in Seattle! It is located within walking distance to downtown Ballard, where there are plenty of shops and restaurants to hang out in. We also biked to Freemont multiple times using the cruisers they provided for us! Downtown Seattle is easily accessible by bus. Julie and Jeff were very accommodating and provided us with plenty of goodies upon our arrival. They were super flexible as well, and even allowed us to store our bags there after checkout for the day until we had to be at the airport. Really the only less-than-awesome thing was the fact that we were there during a heat wave (early July) and there was no AC. However, from my knowledge, most of Seattle has no AC due to the usually fabulous temperatures. Overall, our stay was absolutely perfect in this modern, industrial, wonderfully-decorated studio! It is ideal for a couple and was plenty spacious enough for my husband and I. We fully intend on coming back to Julie and Jeff's soon!"
1618842,38247741,2015-07-14,25296497,Megan,"We feel so lucky to have found the listing for Julie and Jeff's studio! The house and studio were very cool-looking, and it was kept up very well. I had no problem communicating with Julie about our arrival, and she was very nice in person. The space was very clean,  larger than an average hotel room, and included everything we needed. It is obvious that great effort has been made to make guests comfortable here. The snacks and information provided were very helpful, especially since our 8 year-old twins were with us on this first trip to Seattle. A short walk to the park kept them busy between activities. We would definitely stay here again!"
1618842,38709205,2015-07-18,1374526,Catt,"I want to live here. Seriously. This well designed contemporary space has all the necessary comforts (ok, if I lived here I'd add a wardrobe and a stove), and lots of tiny details that made it even better. The roll up garage door and fan made an unusually hot summer in Seattle easy, and the deliciously comfortable bed and linens made for wonderful sleep, until the friendly chickens nudged me awake with their clucking. The washer and dryer were handy. 
I was expecting an even more industrial area, and didn't realize it would be such a quick and easy walk to Market Street and central Ballard with its shops and restaurants. Julie was quick to respond to texts an emails, which made check-in and out easy, and the water and yogurt and snacks in the perfectly equipped compact kitchen were a sweet touch. I'm hoping to stay here again. "
1618842,41574517,2015-08-08,27401066,Linda,"This is a great little studio - clean, comfortable and private. In addition, Julie and Jeff's hospitality was fantastic!!! We really enjoyed our stay and hope to visit again."
1618842,42256310,2015-08-12,5599833,Claude," Accueil très agréable , logement conforme à l'annonce. Appartement très propre et très bien équipé avec pleins d'attention de la part de Julie ( corbeille de fruit yaourt chocolat....). Très bon lit y compris le lit complémentaire. Accès facile à Seattle et supermarché à coté. Bref un  très bon choix au calme! "
1618842,42557557,2015-08-14,26380161,Amy,"The studio was perfect.  Very clean, modern and they thought of everything.  They left treats, neighborhood guides, had robes.  Let's just say, they were speaking my language.  Located in a really cool neighborhood with ample parking and things to do walking distance.  There even is a brewery across the street.  I never met them but I appreciated being left alone as well at times.  I would stay here again for my next visit to Seattle."
1618842,43030953,2015-08-17,16254904,Sean,"This is a great little space, that makes good use of the industrialized space it is built out of. It was cozy, pet friendly, and served it's purpose well. Be aware that their is no oven/stove or A/C, but otherwise, has everything you would expect in a small studio apartment."
1618842,43932139,2015-08-23,35709778,Kate,"We just had a wonderful visit in Seattle visiting our grown children and thought the airbnb experience might be more authentic than a large hotel. Although the unit is right across the street from a great brewery (Stoup) the neighborhood was quiet overall. Yet only 2-3 blocks away are restaurants, unique shops, live music, groceries, food trucks and the bus line. Julie and Jeff have created a charming functional space with all the right details. Loved having the washer/dryer in the unit, fresh coffee beans, robes, books, and fresh fruit! We would definitely stay here again. "
1618842,44890949,2015-08-30,29874055,Jenna,"This was my husband and I's first airbnb experience. Julie and Jeff made it perfect! We lucked out and choose the best in the area! Close enough to walk to restaurants, breweries, and shops. They had the studio perfectly set up and unique! It was roomy enough to stay in all week. We even had my brother and wife over to hang and there was plenty of room for that. Everything that we needed was there, from coffee to towels to robes to snacks. Couldn't have asked for a more amazing first time! Highly recommended!"
1618842,45262695,2015-09-01,6000019,Kendra,"This was a really fun spot to stay in when visiting Seattle. We loved the neighborhood and the studio was fantastic. Julie and Jeff are great hosts and checked in regularly to be sure we were ok. The space was super clean and quiet. There were snacks, coffee and water available in the kitchen, which was a very nice touch. We would definitely recommend this studio to others."
1618842,45956691,2015-09-07,5626899,Amy,"Julie and Jeff were excellent hosts! This space was clean, well stocked, and tucked away in on the perfect street in Ballard.  We had everything we needed for our stay and more.  I would definitely come back here for my next Seattle adventure!"
1618842,46414783,2015-09-10,6860520,Heather,"We were thrilled with our short stay at the studio. Every detail made us feel welcome: the style, the snacks, the robes and slippers, great towels... All perfect. It was equipped with everything we could think of, and was immaculate! Three of us fit comfortably, and never felt like we were on top of each other. The neighborhood was convenient to the more bustling part of Ballard, while also being quiet. We even loved the occasional, friendly cluck of their chickens... So charming. Hope to return soon, and will recommend zebus spot to anyone we know planning a trip to Seattle!"
1618842,46889843,2015-09-14,12928187,Neal,"Julie and Jeff's place was great. Very cool studio in a nice location. We were in the area to look for apartments and had no trouble finding free street parking for the rental car. Across the street is a very cool brewery/bar that's perfect for an after dinner drink. The restaurant strip with Walrus and the Carpenter, etc is just a short walk away. Highly recommended. "
1618842,47464039,2015-09-19,26727106,Hannah,"We had a really great stay at Julie and Jeff's place in Ballard which was superb. A great area with loads to do, and all in a walking distance. Would definitely recommend."
1618842,47672702,2015-09-21,7717932,Phillip,"The studio was everything we needed. We had a wonderful stay. The neighborhood was easy to find and parking was easy. The studio was tucked away toward the back of the property. Very spacious and inviting. The laundry was a huge plus for us as we had been traveling. We loved the snacks and coffee. 

Breweries, bars, restaurants, and all of the downtown nightlife was in walking distance. 

Overall our stay was top notch."
1618842,48295168,2015-09-25,41631138,Azeem,"As one of our first Airbnb rentals, we were very impressed with Julie and Jeff's industrial studio. Julie made us feel very welcome upon arrival and even provided us with a nice assortment of snacks and drinks. The studio itself was spacious yet cozy, providing for a very relaxing experience. We will definitely be staying here when we visit next year. "
1618842,48690034,2015-09-28,20539079,Dara,The room was cozy and welcoming. We loved that Julie and Jeff provided us with some snacks in the kitchen (and coffee)! Everything was very clean and comfortable. 
1618842,49318954,2015-10-03,11678007,Aimee,"We loved this place! The bed was comfy, the towels were huge, there were snacks and coffee!...the brewery across the street was awesome- I only wish we hadn't waited until the last night to try it out. An easy walk to everything Ballard has to offer and a quick uber ride to everything else. Our hosts were very accommodating and super laid back. I would most definitely stay here again!"
1618842,49843565,2015-10-06,10096294,Carlos,Awesome
1618842,50436736,2015-10-12,37594703,Lukas,"Julie and Jeff were great hosts and super accommodating! My girlfriend and I wanted to visit Seattle for her birthday and didn't want to stay in the typical touristy locations. This place has everything you could want with a more ""local"" vibe while not skimping on great places nearby. The studio space was exactly as described in the listing and we were very satisfied with our experience staying there. I am a little disappointed that we did not have time to meet our wonderful hosts however our trip to Seattle was not huge on downtime. The studio itself was fairly spacious and comfortable for two, however I would not recommend additional guests staying in the space. Everything about this place felt easy though, from finding the unit to check in/check out and requesting additional items. The location of the studio was a huge selling point on this place as well. Located across the street from a great brewery and in walking distance to many others, there was no shortage of high quality beverages nearby. Also in short walking distance were grocery stores, excellent restaurants, boutique shopping, a spacious park, and access to several public transportation options. I would highly recommend this studio not just based on comfort and convenience, but also on excellent location and superb hosts. The next time I visit Seattle I hope this place is available. "
1618842,51261474,2015-10-19,349348,Jean,"The studio is even more charming than the photos show and provides a peaceful respite for guests at the end of a busy day. Well decorated with a fun vibe and all furniture is extremely comfortable. I enjoyed the tasty treats Julie left in the kitchen/fridge and got a few more from the local grocery store only a few blocks away.  Julie is very easy to reach and full of positive energy.  Ballard is filled with great little venues for shopping, eating and drinking. The beer at the taproom just across the street from the studio is some of the best I had all season. I would love to return someday in the future.
"
1618842,51610353,2015-10-22,27477227,Elizabeth,"We had a wonderful experience here! The studio was down right dreamy. We loved all of the small, thoughtful touches like coffee beans and fresh cream, extra towels, and fun decor. Would definitely recommend grabbing a pint at the brewery right across the street-makes for a very convenient night cap!"
1618842,53031924,2015-11-03,16330276,Jim,"Don't know what I can add to all the great reviews already in place.  It is a very nice place. Great location. Brewery across the street with a food truck every evening. Try and beat that!  I use airbnb for business yet so far this is the only place I have stayed at, where I would come back to just hang out."
1618842,53458889,2015-11-09,40649162,Steven,"The check in and checkout experience was super smooth. The place itself is very stylish and cozy. Julie was super accommodating and even brought down a steamer for me to use. Excellent place, will definetly book again if in the area."
1618842,54094347,2015-11-16,25717040,Rachel,"So private, so comfortable! I love staying at Julie & Jeff's. The kitchenette is well-equipped, fluffy white robes and towels are provided (love!) and the bed is curtained to feel cozy and secure. The studio has plenty of lighting, room to settle in if you're staying for a number of days and parking is a breeze. You're close to Seattle, but it's quiet at night in this mixed residential/industrial neighborhood. "
1618842,54440537,2015-11-20,37185996,Matt,"Awesome apartment has everything needed for a visit to Seattle.  It is located within walking distance of at least a dozen breweries (including one, Stoups, directly across the street) and several points of interest. Jeff & Julie left some great info on the surrounding area. 

The location is perfect for day trips to downtown Seattle and surrounding areas, and relaxing evenings in the Ballard/Fremont area. "

1618842,56351333,2015-12-12,23133695,Justin,"Julie and Jeff were great hosts, communicating thoroughly all along the way. The studio was ideal for me,  and I loved all the small touches that made it feel like my own private hotel. The location was quiet at night, but close to so many things. My co-workers from Seattle were very impressed when they saw it. The snacks were a thoughtful touch, especially the cans of soda water in the fridge. This is a special place to stay, and I hope to come back!"
1618842,56603818,2015-12-15,40441464,Jessica,"My girlfriend and I stayed here while we celebrated our 2nd year anniversary in Seattle. We never met our hosts, but Julie was an excellent communicator and the space was perfect. We appreciated the wonderful snacks and coffee very much. My girlfriend and I felt very cozy, safe, happy, and warm (both the vibe of the space and the temperature). There were plenty of places within walking distance and we never had a problem walking at night together. Everything was excellent and I hope that if I ever need another place to stay that I can come back here. "
7118258,40639165,2015-08-01,7595234,Andy,The place was great. Patrick is a very communicative host who knows how to prep a place for a guest. The neighborhood is exactly where you would like to stay wether returning or visiting for the first time. Lots of great food and shopping just blocks away.
5640214,28359593,2015-03-22,29416503,Nick,"Great little place! Awesome location. We spent most of our time outside of the apartment so it was a nice, easy place to crash. No TV, no wifi. And the bed is just a futon, but a comfortable one. Clean and charming old building. "
5640214,28824395,2015-03-30,26109395,Krystina,"Such a gem-  the hostess and the apartment! 
Centrally Located in Capitol Hill,  you can walk ANYWHERE from here! 
The studio was WAY bigger and more charmingly beautiful than the pictures depict. 
In an old building built in 1811, you can take 3 flights of stairs up,  or ride the charming vintage elevator-  both dump you off at the front door! 
Street parking is available,  and she provides a parking pass. 
If you're planning on eating out mostly (as we did)  just know that there's no microwave for leftovers,  but finding the pots and pans was no issue as she is very organized :-)
Communication with her was always quick and seamless and I felt like we were old friends.  
She gave great recommendations to go see local music (as she herself is a talented musician) & we loved everything she pointed us to. 
The neighborhood never felt unsafe and was peaceful,  even though you are SO close to the fun hustle & bustle! 
So great feeling like a local in a hip apartment in a hip area. 
Highly recommend staying here!"
5640214,29714134,2015-04-11,30810995,Jaime,Really enjoyed our stay with Alexandra. The apartment is within walking distance to an awesome neighborhood with a lot of restaurants and bars to visit. It is also only a few miles from downtown if you are interested in visiting any of the tourist locations. She was very easy to communicate with and made the whole process run smooth. She gave us a parking tag that allowed us to park in the street which was really helpful and even offered for my girlfriend and I to visit a music show that she was attending. I would highly recommend this listing. 
5640214,30331522,2015-04-20,13092650,Victoria,"Alexandra is a total sweetheart! From the moment I met her she was very warm and welcoming, and very relaxed. I felt very comfortable in her studio and loved the space. As a former resident of Cap Hill, I was really happy to find such a gem in my old neighborhood, with lots of entertainment within walking distance. I'd definitely try to stay here again the next time I come into town."
5640214,30704971,2015-04-26,4418621,Julie,Alexandra was very accommodating with all the chaos around my delayed flight. She made the effort to drop keys off to me where I was. Her space was quiet and comfortable and in a very central location. I really enjoyed staying at her place.
5640214,31797126,2015-05-10,30423591,Taylor,"Alexandra was awesome! She gave suggestions on what to do and where to eat. Her place is clean, cozy and full of character."
5640214,32342286,2015-05-17,29951574,Margo,Lovely studio. Perfect for what we needed in Seattle. Host was very accommodating and helpful. 
5640214,33890707,2015-06-02,33553756,Martin,The host canceled this reservation 53 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5640214,35548998,2015-06-20,11899330,William,"Our time at Alexandra's place was a joy. The apartment was very nice and had everything we needed for our short stay in Seattle. The apartment is in an ideal location to get to all the best parts of town and Alexandra was always available to contact for any advice and was also a great help in terms of recommendations. 
Thoroughly enjoyed my time in Seattle and would definitely stay at Alexandra's again.
Highly recommended."
5640214,36176142,2015-06-26,29601058,Marlyse,"My husband and I were very happy with our two night stay at Alexandra’s place! The place was clean and very cute and charming. Alexandra was very accommodating and let us check-in a little early since our plane had arrived sooner than expected. She even had a bottle of wine and chocolates waiting for us in the apartment. The location is great for exploring the amazing restaurants and bars of Capitol Hill and was about a 1.5 mile walk to Pike Place Market. I also felt it was a very quiet part of the neighborhood. We never heard any street noise, even with the windows open. One thing to note: it is an older building and does not have any air conditioning. Typically, I imagine this is no issue, but Seattle was having quite the heat wave while we there. Alexandra does have a fan and with the windows open, it stayed fairly cool. All in all, a great stay! "
5640214,36609749,2015-06-29,36092720,Jennifer,"Great experience! It was clean and comfortable. Within walking distances from bars, food and park."
5640214,37315578,2015-07-06,2988661,Mandi,"Beautiful apartment in a great location! I was able to walk to restaurants, shops, and cafes in Capital Hill. The apartment was clean and felt very safe. One drawback is that there is no AC, which is usually not an issue with the weather in Seattle - there was a fan though to keep the air circulating. I would definitely recommend this place and would stay there again myself."
5640214,37975615,2015-07-12,33249459,Pamela,Alexandra was a great host from the start - responded in a timely manner and was upbeat - she matched the excitement my husband and I had about our upcoming trip. The apartment was better than described and full of character. Alexandra made it easy to feel at home there and she made my husband and I's first Air BnB experience a positive and memorable one. The proximity to everything we wanted to do and see in Seattle was perfect! Thank you for opening your home to us!
5640214,38721699,2015-07-18,27717744,Tracy,Everything went smoothly and easily. Alexandra anticipated all of my needs. The apt is charming and well located. Thank you and I hope to be back soon!
5640214,40574466,2015-08-01,2598962,Sara,"Alex's apartment was just as pictured in a wonderful older building in a charming neighborhood. While it was a bit difficult to get in touch with Alex prior to arrival, once we were in touch she provided easy instructions on how to get into the apartment and where to find things. 
The apartment itself is safe, sunny, has a comfortable bed (much less comfortable pillows) and has a lovely kitchen if anyone feels the need to cook. But why would you with so many great bars and restaurants in the neighborhood?! I can't say enough great things about the location. Capitol Hill is great; and this apartment is situated just north of all the action.
I would say the apartment could have been a bit cleaner and better equipped: there were long strands of hair everywhere; we weren't sure if the towels left out for us were clean; and there wasn't a top sheet on the bed-- only the comforter... But I suppose that's to be expected when renting what's clearly someone's home versus an oft-rented primarily-for-Airbnb space.
Overall we had a great stay in Alex's apartment and would recommend to any travelers who just need the essentials."
5640214,41342575,2015-08-07,19315045,Iain,"We loved staying in Alexandra's cute apartment. The location is perfect -- quiet and residential but only a couple of minutes walk away from the great bars, shops and cafes of Capitol Hill. We also loved all the little extra touches, from the hand written messages through to the guitar in the kitchen. "
5640214,41947268,2015-08-10,34389329,Mandy,"Alexandra was the perfect hostess for our first experience with AirBnB.  She was available if we needed her, but easily let us have our space.  Her cute apartment was exactly how it was pictured, was quiet, and very convenient for what we wanted to do and see while we were in Seattle.  The neighborhood was quiet and within walking distance of all that Seattle has to offer.  We were very pleased with our entire trip, Alexandra made check-in/check-out a breeze.  We would definitely book with her again and recommend it to anyone heading to Seattle. "
5640214,43314319,2015-08-18,8324363,Matata,Alexandra's place was cozy and comfortable. The area is nice and has plenty to do and also is central to anywhere you may want to get to in Seattle and she was very accommodating! 
5640214,50384562,2015-10-11,129700,Jenni,"Alexandra's place is perfect for a stay in Seattle. The neighborhood is filled with cool restaurants, bars, coffee shops, all within walking distance. It's also close to many bus routes. The place was cozy and quiet. The bed was comfortable. She left instructions for the wifi and got back to me with any questions I had. Thanks so much for the wonderful place to stay!"
5640214,52552847,2015-10-30,17075225,Brooke,Great place to stay on Capitol Hill. Clean and cozy. 
5640214,53911671,2015-11-14,47332783,Claire Elisabeth,"Very comfortable and quiet, great location in Capitol Hill. Alexandra was very responsive and helpful leading up to and during our trip. "
5640214,55463493,2015-12-01,2590340,Michelle,I had a great experience! Alexandra was super accommodating!
4768038,25222482,2015-01-09,12393648,Brian,"Matt made sure I had very detailed information about how to find his apartment (and it was easy to find.) He was very welcoming and made me feel right at home in his beautifully decorated place. He's in a great location near Volunteer Park. Just far away enough from Capitol Hill's excitement to avoid all the noise, but close enough that good bars and restaurants are just a short walk away. There is also a bus line that picks up right outside his place and will get you downtown in about 20 minutes.

I'm usually not a huge fan of sofa beds, but the memory foam mattress on the bed in Matt's guest room was very comfortable. In addition to the comfortable bed, Matt provided a small TV and a nice, clean private guest bathroom.

I had a great experience staying with Matt and would definitely recommend him as a host."
4768038,25558552,2015-01-19,6041727,Bridget,"Our stay at Matt's apartment was flawless. It's in a beautiful neighborhood within walking distance to many restaurants and bars, and it's located right across the street from a huge park. We found free street parking right in front of the apartment building. Matt was very accommodating, leaving detailed instructions about everything from accessing the building, to accessing his netflix account. The apartment is well appointed with a tempurpedic mattress pad on the pull out sofa,  soft towels, and a small tv in the guest room. There are beautiful photos and souvenirs from all around the world scattered throughout the apartment, making any guest feel right at home. While Matt was helpful and accommodating, he also gave us our privacy which was very much appreciated. "
4768038,25670277,2015-01-22,23205277,Michael,"This home away from home was perfectly what I needed and suited to my needs with access to everything I required. 

Matt was a gracious host and very easy to communicate with and provided every detail needed to make my stay easy and comfortable. 

The neighborhood was quiet, safe, and centrally located to every where I wanted to go and do.  

I would definitely come back to this location and it gets a 5 star rating from me.  This was my first experience renting through Airbnb and if every host is as down to earth as Matt was, I will definitely use this service again in the future. "
4768038,25883426,2015-01-28,9191747,Sachi,"Staying at Matt's place made our stay in Seattle way more comfortable. He gave us details of direction to his place before we leave. Thanks to him, we could get there safely without any confusion. Also the apartment is in perfect location. We always went to eat or drink at night by walk. And also the bus stop is exactly right in front of the apartment. The room was beautiful and clean, we could use bathroom all by ourselves. I could feel like it was my home! Thank you so much Matt! "
4768038,26216732,2015-02-07,24557541,Rae,"Matt's cozy home worked perfectly for my visit to Seattle. I had a rental car so really appreciated the ample street parking. We had our own, clean bathroom, access to the in-unit washer/dryer (awesome for me who packed light or simply those not wanting to live with musty clothes from the perpetual drizzle), and flexible checkin/checkout. My friend liked the plush tempurpedic set atop the pull-out sofa bed, although I would prefer a firmer mattress. Like others said,  the apt. is situated in a quiet residential corner across a park, but you can easily reach local eateries/bars/shops by walking down 15th. The bus on 19th took us right to downtown. Matt is super responsive in our communications, and as you can tell by the listing's extensive descriptions, he's also thorough and helpful (Volunteer Park Cafe is a great spot downhill for brunch & pastries). Recommended for those who want a safe, quiet and convenient stay after a day of roaming around town. I would definitely check out this space again for a future trip!"
4768038,26790491,2015-02-19,26718444,Fiona,"Our stay at Matt's apartment was great. Very easy and flexible check in/check out, and the place was very clean and nicely decorated. We had access to a private bathroom and the washer/dryer, which was very handy. The location is great and within walking distance of many restaurants and spots in Capitol Hill. There is a bus stop right by, and you can get to downtown in around 20 minutes! Matt was very welcoming and hospitable, I would definitely stay here again on my next trip to Seattle! "
4768038,27102981,2015-02-25,27247835,Jessica,"This was our first time using Airbnb and Matt was the best host we could have asked for! He was very communicative from the moment we scheduled our stay up until we left. He gave us very detailed directions with pictures on how to get to his apartment, so it was easy getting in.

The apartment is located in a beautiful neighborhood, with a park and art museum in front, as well as a bus down the street that takes you downtown. It's also about a 10 minute walking distance to some great bars and restaurants. 

The apartment itself is one of the most beautifully decorated apartments we've seen! The room we stayed in was cozy, and it had a small TV and a very comfortable mattress. There's also a heater inside the room that warms up the room nicely. We are so happy that Matt let us use the kitchen and some of the stuff there for cooking.  

Matt was very welcoming and made us feel like we were at home. We would definitely stay with him again."
4768038,27464401,2015-03-05,6564681,Virginia,"It was our first time visiting Seattle and Matt's place is truly in the most beautiful area in the super cool Capitol Hill. We didn't get to see Matt ( we arrived while he was at work and we were out all day/night) but felt very well taken care of regardless. We had a beautiful and very clean private bathroom and a comfy bed. Everything is walking distance so bring a pair of comfy shoes! Oh, and super cute park across the street and a museum. I can go on but my best advice to be to text Matt, the guy knows all the good spots! "
4768038,27837862,2015-03-13,27296432,Taylor,Matt made our stay in Seattle a great experience. Matt and Lindsey's home in Seattle is beautiful and the neighborhood is great! Matt was very communicative with us upon our stay and made us feel very at home in his place. I would definitely stay here again! 
4768038,28165557,2015-03-19,708420,Ismail,"Great experience-Matt was a helpful host and his place was the perfect spot from which to explore Capitol Hill and the rest of Seattle.
"
4768038,28398056,2015-03-23,23594904,Sarah,"We unfortunately actually never got to meet Matt during our trip. However, he made sure our stay went smoothly and made himself available if we needed any help. The apartment is located in a safe, beautiful neighborhood with access to downtown.  He made it very simple for us to access the apartment, and when we arrived it was spotless! Perfect spot for my boyfriend and I to come back and relax after exploring Seattle. He was quick to respond during the booking process and always responded to emails within a few hours! Would  definitely recommend staying here!"
4768038,28607839,2015-03-27,10431862,Nate,Great place to stay. Matt was friendly and accomadating.
4768038,28719970,2015-03-29,10431862,Nate,Very friendly and accommodating host.

The apartment is located in a beautiful neighborhood, with a park and art museum in front, as well as a bus down the street that takes you downtown. It's also about a 10 minute walking distance to some great bars and restaurants. Capitol Hill is great location for exploring Seattle. We were in downtown in 20 minutes by walk. 

The apartment is clean and as described. Matt provided us detailed instruction how to find it. Matt provided every detail needed to make our stay easy and comfortable."
4768038,29568819,2015-04-09,24529445,John Ray,"Matt was a great host, very informative and easy to get in touch with. He is very accommodating and understanding and would definitely recommend his space. His apartment is close by to a public transportation that gets you to the center of downtown and all the sight seeing attractions. His place is very clean and maintained and he makes you  feel at home as soon as you get in. He gives you plenty of space and privacy during your stay. I would definitely use him again when I visit Seattle. Thanks Matt"
4768038,29991563,2015-04-15,344537,Jason,"Matt is an absolutely marvelous host.  I spent five nights at his lovely, conveniently located apartment.  Everything about my experience was positive, and I definitely plan to stay there again when I return to Seattle."
4768038,30208934,2015-04-19,14036419,Robert,"Staying at Matt and Lindsey's was fantastic. I had the place to myself for the weekend while they were away, and it's a big, beautiful apartment. So nicely decorated, and very comfortable. It was easy to get an uber or catch the bus, across the street from a nice park to run in, and walkable to nearby shops and even downtown Seattle (bit of a trek, but New Yorkers are used to walking!). Can't  wait to stay there again next time I visit Seattle. "
4768038,30819024,2015-04-27,22531947,Briana,"Great, friendly host.  A nice space & very helpful in ease of check-in, suggestions of places to go, etc. gave me lots of space & privacy.  Overall very positive experience."
4768038,31236236,2015-05-03,31474243,Dennis,"Matt was a great host. Actually, he was out of town for all of our brief visit, but he made sure we were comfortable and that we knew what was available in the neighborhood etc. 

The apartment was exactly what we expected. Perfectly located on Capitol Hill, and nicely appointed. Clearly, Matt is a traveler too, and from the various mementos around the apartment, it looks like we've visited many of the same places. Sorry we didn't get to meet Matt on this trip, but looking forward to future visits."
4768038,31653980,2015-05-08,27022633,Bao-Tram,Matt was a wonderful host. He was super friendly and great at communicating. The check-in process and entire stay was seamless. I really appreciated his flexibility and professionalism. His place is beautifully decorated and has great amenities (comfortable bed and well-stocked bathroom). Great place to stay if you want to stay somewhere residential and close to the city!
4768038,32189862,2015-05-15,28582513,Renee,"Matt was a very warm and personable host.  His instructions on how to get into the apartment were very clear and he even provided a document with photos of the landmarks he described which was very helpful.  

The apartment was very conveniently located in a beautiful neighborhood next to a little commercial area that had shops/restaurants, etc. and was a very easy walk.   The bus stop was just down the block and you can walk into the city from there, we did.  It's a bit of a haul but at least it's all downhill!

The mattress on the bed was a full queen but because it's on top of the sofa bed the top of the mattress is elevated a bit which took a little bit of getting used to.

The apartment and amenities were as described but the room was a bit smaller than we might have liked.  There isn't much room to walk around or for your luggage with the bed pulled out. "
4768038,32784400,2015-05-21,23624225,Paul,"Matt was a fantastic host! He was very welcoming and the location was phenomenal. Volunteer Park is gorgeous and right across the street.

Ask him about Paul Allen"
4768038,33107907,2015-05-25,6491960,Maria,"Matt's apartment is in a lovely area of Seattle, with large older homes nearby and beautiful Volunteer park across the street.  We felt safe walking to and from the nearby 15th Ave. eateries and shops.  Our room and bath were clean and comfortable. We were encouraged to use the washer and dryer in the apartment which really helped us out after a week of travel.   The shared areas of the apartment were  beautifully decorated and we felt welcome to use them.  We really appreciated Matt's hospitality and friendliness."
4768038,34142240,2015-06-05,27499485,Lowrie,"It was great staying with Matt. He is super nice and was really helpful. It's great staying with people who love to travel because they know what's most important at the end of a long day - hot showers, washing machine, good bed. His place is warm and clean, had everything we needed and is right on the no. 10 bus line to get into town. Only a short walk to the village for a great brekkie at the Wandering Goose. The park across the road has great views of Seattle, and Bruce Lee is nearby. Highly recommend staying here. It's a great respite at the end of the day."
4768038,34555180,2015-06-09,32934259,Ann,"Matt was a very nice host and gave excellent directions to gaining access to the apartment. A lovely place in a lovely neighborhood, a short walk to restaurants and even shorter to the bus stop. There was a fair amount of traffic noise while we were there and the room was a tad tight but Matt was fine with us leaving suitcases in the living room. His place made our Seattle stay very pleasant!"
4768038,35219740,2015-06-16,10072726,Wendy,"Matt's is a warm and welcoming host. His apartment is lovely and located in a beautiful, residential neighborhood on Capital Hill.  Parks, coffee shops, restaurants, shopping all within easy walking distance.  We were pleased to find unlimited parking on the street."
4768038,36185047,2015-06-26,31989063,Nela,"Matt's place is great, just as described and photographed! And Matt is a lovely host, was helpful with recommendations and directions and chatty when we passed. 
Also a big help are the instructions on how to get access, including step by step photos, which as a first timer to the city is incredibly helpful.
Big bonus to my mind with this listing is the location, with shops, restaurants, coffee shops etc about 10 minutes walk and a 15-20 minute single bus ride to the centre (& the bus runs so frequently you never wait more than 10 minutes!), I really liked that.
Everything was clean and tidy, room plenty big enough, I had a great stay and would recommend to anyone."
4768038,36916531,2015-07-02,32374827,Marcelo,"I had a great stay at Matt's place. The apartment is in a great location (few steps and you can get a bus all the way to downtown). The place is very organized and clean, just as shown in the pictures. Matt is a great host, always available to provide some tips and information"
4768038,37861461,2015-07-11,34159779,Fabe,"We (two travelers) had six nights and really enjoyed staying here. The connection (by car) into the City is good.
Hosts are very friendly and welcoming. The apartment is nice, the room small but really enough for sleeping, for chilling the shared living room is great. Own bathroom is quite convenient and provided everything needed. Also clean and tidy."
4768038,38726531,2015-07-18,29536455,Rachel,"Matt's apartment was great. It's located on a convenient bus line (10) which goes straight downtown, toward Pike Place. It was clean and had a good amount of space. Matt is a generous host and had both good suggestions and gave good directions. The apartment is within walking distance of several coffee shops and good restaurants and bars. I recommend both Matt and his place. "
4768038,39965003,2015-07-27,14039735,Rachel,"Matt was an awesome host. His place is located in a really nice neighborhood and was close to everything, with a bus stop on the next block. I told him that it was like I went to stay with my brother, only Matt was nicer and his place was clean. The extra bedroom and extra bath (that I had full reign over) was extremely clean and comfortable. His and his fiancés style is really great too. Exactly what you see in the pictures is what you get. Would definitely stay there again! "
4768038,40757123,2015-08-02,9099322,Patrick,"This is a very well appointed and clean apartment in a lovely part of Seattle. It is right across from a pretty park with an Art Museum and a Conservatory, and glimpses of views of down town. Within a few blocks we found a wonderful small neighbourhood cafe (N on 17th) which we used for breakfasts and several excellent and buzzing restaurants (S on 19th) for the evening - we felt no need to go further afield for the evenings. The public transport couldn't be easier - with the bus stop being just outside, and the bus running (apparently very reliably) about 5 times per hour and only $2.50 each. Although we had a car, we relied entirely on the bus for Pike Market and the Space Needle (one change required - no extra cost). It is just over a mile to walk or drive to Union Lake, though this property is on a steep hill, so the walk back might be some effort! All in all we were extremely happy to have stayed here rather than in the centre. Matt was extremely helpful, all instructions were clear, and everything could not have been smoother. We would definitely stay here again if we return to Seattle."
4768038,43250259,2015-08-18,37229280,Kathy,"Looking for a relaxing place in a great neighborhood; this is it.  The living room offers plenty of room  and comfy couches to relax after a long day touring.  If you love travel, you'll enjoy the pictures and artifacts gathered from hosts' travels.  Matt was welcoming and well informed about the area; he made us feel right at home. One of the best features; great neighboorhood and 10 minute walk to coffee houses, restaurants, bars and parks. "
4768038,44030716,2015-08-23,20743307,Ounesha,"This was our first visit to the Emerald City.  Matt communicated with us well and was easily reachable via email/phone.  The apartment is beautifully decorated but the room is pretty small.  If you have more than one suitcase you will have very little room to walk around the sofa bed and  there is no closet space to hang your clothes.  The bathroom is private but located across the hall.

Having the facility to do laundry was really helpful.  The key to open the apartment door is tricky and once it took us a half an hour to get in while communicating with our host.  Luckily, we did not have to use the washroom right away as this could have been a major problem.  Unfortunately we had to cut our visit short due to an unforeseen family emergency and it took a lot of time communicating with airbnb and our host to modify the booking."
4768038,49912602,2015-10-07,7622762,Christopher,"This apartment overlooks volunteer park, is shared with the host but you get your own bathroom, and is a easy walk to most things in the city (Seattle is hilly though). We have never stayed with a host and were not sure what that would be like, we got the opportunity to chat with Matt a few times, he is very kind and considerate, loves interacting with his guests while also providing them with space, is well traveled (the decorations reflect this), and was an all around great guy/ host. "
4768038,50488179,2015-10-12,7342598,Eva,"Me and my mom had a really wonderful experience at Matt's place! The room is cozy, clean and made us feel at home! Matt is nice and easy to talk to!"

4768038,51452216,2015-10-20,11977120,Cynthia,Matt was a wonderful Host!  The apartment was clean and lovely.   His beautiful furnishings had a wonderful Asian flare...which made me feel right at home...my home has a similar taste!  Matt was welcoming and I loved his infectious smile.  I would definitely stay there again without hesitation!  Thank you Matt!!!
4768038,51763478,2015-10-24,184732,Layla,"Another wonderful airbnb experience.  This was our first time booking a shared space, and it suited us really well.  Matt's apartment is in a highly convenient location.  The Capitol Hill neighborhood is beautiful and was close to everything we needed.  Parking was a dream.  And Matt was a very responsive and considerate host. "
4768038,52288209,2015-10-27,45570153,Xin,Matt's apartment proves to be an extremely stylish and comfortable one.  And he is a very kind  host full of hospitality，at the same time giving us a room of privacy.  The location of the apartment is excellent，and we walked around a lot during day and night without the least concern of safety.  We love the clean room and the nice surroundings，and will undoubtly choose Matt's apartment for accommodation when we come back to Seattle next time.  Thank you so much Matt！
4768038,52622476,2015-10-31,33209142,Shana,"Matt did a great job at being super communicative from the start. He gave us very clear instructions on how to find the apartment and how to get the key. He cleared out spaces in the fridge for us, showed us our room and bathroom, and was so open and kind. Any questions we had he was available to answer and was very prompt. So kind! Such a great stay. The location was great, too- right near Volunteer Park and right near the 15th Ave shops/cafes. All around great stay!"

It took us about 25 min bus from Pike market, and 30 min bus to Washington university, perfect location for our trip. "
4857192,42480486,2015-08-13,20906528,Christine,"Mar was such an incredible host. After arriving a bit later than planned, she was more than accommodating and made us feel right at home! We spent the evening on her rooftop enjoying the sunset with a glass of wine then went downtown with a quick taxi drive to enjoy a concert. The location is ideal and her space is beautiful. Mar was more than willing to give recommendations around town, driving directions and made sure throughout our stay that we were comfortable. Will be back, for sure! "
4857192,44190450,2015-08-24,1521752,Eri,"Mari was an incredible host. The room was perfect for me and my friend, and she welcomed us so generously. She was so helpful. Thank you so much for the amazing stay, Mari!"

Place could've been cleaner — although it was honestly better than I expected for what it was. Main other thing is that it would've been great to have had Internet access directly in the apartment. Overall a good value and a really nice host."
8064351,45641514,2015-09-04,34693274,Oli,"What a guy! Although a modest airbed on the floor, the flat has everything you could need and is about the most centrally located (and cheapest) Seattle place you'll find on here. Asher was kind and welcoming,  and really helped make my visit to seattle special. 10/10! Thanks man :)"
8064351,46223809,2015-09-08,34548119,Claire,Asher was very nice. He gave me a set of keys and his place was easy to find. I was a little thrown off by the neighborhood and the number of homeless people around the area but his airbed in his living room was fine.
8064351,46677547,2015-09-12,10949784,Hannes,"The room is located right downtown, a primary spot. It's a studio apartment with the bed being put up in the living room/kitchen. So there is no extra room, don't expect too much privacy, though Asher would maintain as much as possible. Asher is a wonderful, respectful and very caring host!"
8064351,46998147,2015-09-14,18897596,Alexander,"Asher made me feel extremely welcome.  He was willing to talk to me about things to do around the city before he had to go to work.  I felt very welcome.  The listing was as described.  The neighborhood was great.  It was very central to everything...shopping, the train, touristy stuff, etc.   I definitely recommend Asher's place for a stay."

The apartment was clean, and well labeled as far as what was for use by everyone staying there. Ideal location directly across from light rail. Asher was ver quiet and gave me my space. "
8064351,53395142,2015-11-08,24043410,Yvette,"Asher's place was cozy and artsy, most importantly situated right in front of the Pioneer Sq link station. I had a conference to attend during the weekend and it is very convenient to go around the city. It is perfect for an individual traveller. Asher needed to be leave the day I arrived but he stayed late enough to meet me and to let me feel familiar with his apt and the neighborhood. "

Asher has a super comfy airbed in the living room (high quality; better than many Airbnb pull-out couches & guest beds I've tried). Great bathroom & kitchen facilities. Asher himself is friendly, welcoming and generally. I feel like this is all putting it too mildly! I will definitely book with Asher again when I visit Seattle. He is a wonderful person and offers a great place to stay, with the chance to learn of fun things to do while you're in town. Highly recommended!!! "
8147215,50048442,2015-10-08,5326306,Benjamin,"Jaimee provided excellent service, the house is nestled on a quiet street with great beach access. We really enjoyed the stay, it's like a hidden pacific northwest gem. "
8147215,51166070,2015-10-18,32508614,Juan,"Our stay at Jaimee's beautiful home was great. This property is perfectly situated in the beautiful North Beach area just North of Seattle. The home decor and layout are great and allow you to feel right at home. The backyard of the property is beautiful and provided for some of our fondest memories of our trip to Seattle. During our stay Jaimee was not available but we were assisted by the ""Pillow"" management staff and they were very helpful and communicative during our stay. We ran into a small maintenance issue which was resolved within hours of us bringing it to their attention. I highly recommend this property and will definitely look to book it during our next trip to Seattle. "
8147215,53557966,2015-11-09,2989304,Jeff,"Jaimee's place was great – super comfortable and great vibes. The house had everything we needed and close enough to all necessary things. The price was right for the location – meaning it's a decent walk to the grocery, so you may need a car. And there is a 3rd Party service called Pillow that manages the listing – they're responsive/attentive if you have issues or questions (though it feels a little less personal than most Airbnb's, it works!)"
8147215,54324186,2015-11-18,14554407,Sandra,"We loved the beautiful cozy home with great art on the walls.  It was the perfect size for four persons.  The home is in an lovely quiet neighborhood with a short walk to the waterfront.  The front and back yards are private and (website hidden) on the gourmet stove was a treat.   We travel often to Seattle to visit our granddaughter and daughter, so we appreciated finding this little gem.  We definitely will check for availability at this adorable place next time we are in town."

Apartment very well-situated (e.g.: Green Lake, a nice pub, a café, and a great sushi place as well as a Mini-Market are all a stone's throw away) and well-equipped. Enough really interesting art books to keep you in the apartment should the weather be less than enticing. Looking forward to our next stay! "

There were some shops and restaurants close by and walking distance from Green Lake which I took advantage of on my sunny weekend stay. As my first visit to Seattle, I am happy I chose to stay here as the place had ample space for myself, comfortable bed, super clean, and had everything I needed. It felt like my own little apartment. I would definitely stay here again. "

The apartment was roomier than I imagined and had all the comforts of home!  Traveling with small children, we really enjoyed the nearby lake, walking path, park, and zoo.  Public transportation is close and accessible.  A quick bus ride to downtown Seattle and you have plenty to do and see.  I would definitely stay again!  "
132120,28747610,2015-03-29,11494253,Jesús,Ralph's apartment was our home away from home in Seattle. Great space for three people. Having our own kitchen made it convient and easy to make breakfast in the morning before going out to explore the city. There was plenty of street of parking for our car. The neighborhood and its sorrounding area was safe and welcoming. Ralph was quick to answer any questions we had and was very friendly the times we ran into him. He was there when we needed him and aside from that gave us our space and made the stay very comfortable. 
132120,32064200,2015-05-13,30600770,Linnéa,"Ralph önskade mig trevlig resa till en början, sedan hörde han av sig någon dag innan jag skulle komma för att få kontaktuppgifter med min son och hans familj som bor i Seattle. De skulle nämligen möta mig vid flyget och kunde också följa resan och informera om ev förseningar t ex.
Min son och sonhustru fick så småningom kontakt med Ralph och fick då veta, att om Ralph eller hans fru inte var hemma när jag kom skulle jag ändå finna nyckeln till lägenheten på ett bra ställe.
Allt fungerade bra därvidlag.

Det var fräscht i lägenheten. Ralph hade t o m ställt in ett extra element om jag skulle tycka att det var kallt eller rått. Det hade jag påslaget några kvällar.  Lägenheten ligger ju i källaren, så det blir inte samma värme som i övriga huset.

Det jag inte kunde tolka ut i lägenhetsbeskrivningen var om jag skulle ha med lakan och handdukar. Hos andra uthyrare hade jag läst mig till hur de hade det. För säkerhets skull tog jag med detta, men det hade jag inte behövt.

Det var lite lyhört. Hur vanligt det är, vet jag inte, men min son och hans familj bor i en hyreslägenhet i ett flerfamiljshus, även där är det lyhört, dvs man kan höra när någon går över golvet ovanför. Jag hörde aldrig några röster, däremot tror jag att det var någon slags hushållsmaskin jag kunde höra på mornarna.  Jag stördes inte direkt av de ljud jag hörde.

Lägenheten var bra utrustad. Enda anmärkningen jag hade var att kaffebryggaren inte fungerade, men det talade jag om för Ralph. Jag dricker aldrig kaffe på mornarna så mitt kaffe drack jag hos min son och sonhustru eller ute.
Sängen var mycket bra, så jag sov gott om nätterna.

Den lilla kontakt jag hade med värdfamiljen och deras hund upplevde jag som mycket positiv, precis som alla andra Seattlebor jag träffade: serviceminded, trevliga, hjälpsamma.

Det är ett lugnt villaområde. Ingen störande trafik. Dock bör man som ovan vid miljön se upp med trottoarerna. Plattorna som utgör trottoarerna kan ligga ojämnt p g a att trädens rötter har skjutit upp dem. Jag snubblade på en sådan platta och föll till marken. Vänster knä fick skrubbsår och högerhandens långfinger och ringfinger  skadades så att de måste jag plåstra om ett antal dagar. Jag hade tur som inte bröt mig. Det som blir kvar när läkningsprocessen är över blir troligen ett ärr på långfingret. Det här hände inte på gatan utanför Ralphs hus utan på en annan närliggande gata. Det är ju så det ser ut på trottoarerna var man än går.

The kitchen is supplied with utensils, etc. and the bathroom has a supply of goods in case you've forgotten something. Great, quiet location within walking distance to restaurants, bus stops and the beautiful Green Lake. Plenty of street parking - most nights I was able to park right in front of the house.

The apartment and its furnishings and bedding were very neat and clean. The location of the place is just a few blocks from beautiful Green Lake, which has an excellent and busy walking path, and we loved having Mighty-O Donuts, Elysian Brewery and Zoka Coffee Roasters just a few blocks down the street."

He had great restaurant recommendations, including a few which were within walking distance from the house, and was generally a great resource for getting to know Seattle.  The apartment was spacious and comfortable; everyday necessities that you may not think to pack, such as mugs or towels, were provided. The space was roomy enough for three adults and lots of luggage. All the amenities were in good working order. It was a great home base for us, and we would definitely stay again if the opportunity arose. "
132120,46715625,2015-09-13,19126793,John,Ralph is a great host. The accommodations are nice and roomy. 
132120,48187133,2015-09-24,16932151,Divakar,"Mr Ralph Coolman is a really good host and maintains his place very well for the guests with basic supplies one needs when we move in.

The place is very spacious, easy access to the UW as well as downtown. We rented a car and parking outside on street was always available.

We managed to cook the meals whenever we had time, and apartment is well furnished with all kitchen equipment, cooking vessels and crockery. Furthermore, Ralph ensured that basic supplies such as tea, coffee, sugar, salt, spices, cereals were in stock.
"
132120,55110805,2015-11-28,44280232,Alice,"Ralph called the weekend before we were scheduled to arrive to give us key instructions. He was very warm and friendly. The neighborhood is very nice with a quick walk down hill to the lake. The apartment is spacious and attractive with a nicely equipped kitchen. The bed is comfortable and there is plenty of space for your ""stuff.""  Lots of lovely pieces of his sculpting  are whimsically placed indoors and out. Thank you Ralph and family for making our stay so pleasant."
1323446,5667312,2013-07-10,2905124,Chris,"Laura and Rex were amazing hosts! Very accommodating and friendly. The space was beautiful, relaxing and a GREAT base to explore the city from. I highly recommend it to anyone!"
1323446,5796050,2013-07-16,4010131,Stuart,"Really enjoyed my stay here. Unfortunately, I did not get to meet Laura in person, but we had very nice conversations on the phone and via text message. She was very responsive and had great recommendations. The place is in a great location. Nice neighborhood. The room was very nice. Comfortable bed, nice clean shower. I would definitely stay here again next time I visit Seattle."
1323446,5970583,2013-07-24,7190588,Fred,"The quarters are clean, comfortable and private with a separate outside entrance, allowing you to come and go without fear of disturbing the household.  The location is extremely convenient to a the multitude of shops, restaurants and stores on Queen Anne Street.  Street parking is easy, and Laura is a delightful, accommodating  and thoughtful hostess."
1323446,6032915,2013-07-27,7445158,David,"Laura and Rex took excellent care of us. They helped us in all ways and made us much more than welcome;their home became our home. Our conversations were real, our feelings were honest. These are wonderful people to stay with.
The house is beautiful, convenient, safe, clean, and comfortable.
A great place for adventures to begin."
1323446,6142524,2013-07-31,271454,Katie,"Laura's home is very nice and  in a great neighborhood.  We used both the room with the queen bed and the other room with the trundle - the rooms are downstairs and separate from the rest of the house. Nice big bathroom and a separate entrance.   Laura is very sweet and quite funny!
"
1323446,6757112,2013-08-24,6735237,Sherry,"TOTALLY AWESOME!!!  You won't meet two nicer, sweeter people in the world!!  Rex & Laura are the best!  Hospitality and warmth drip from these two. =) Great coffee, fresh fruit, laundry availablity, comfy bed....the place is just as seen in the pictures.  What you don't see in the pictures is the peaceful quiet you get when staying here.  I've been coming to Seattle for 13 years & the downtown noise is always something I contend with.  Not here.  It was like staying at your own home in downtown Seattle. s available next year when I come back!!!  Thank you Rex & Laura for making this years stay the best yet!! =) =)"
1323446,6831103,2013-08-26,521879,Shelley,"Laura and Rex were fantastic hosts. They went out of their way to make us feel at home. They even invited us up for breakfast one morning! Their house is absolutely beautiful, and the guest area where we stayed is like a house in itself. The location is perfect, and I am very happy that we listened to their recommendation about Diablo's (the coffee shop around the corner). I will be checking their calendar again the next time I head to Seattle (which will hopefully be soon enough)."
1323446,6917648,2013-08-30,7763963,Beth,"Lovely home in quiet residential neighborhood, just blocks from shops and restaurants of Queen Anne district. Owner provided delicious Pete's coffee, fruit and yogurt upon my arrival. Tastefully decorated with music motif which happens to be my passion as well!"
1323446,7000035,2013-09-02,6699552,Michael,"Great hosts, great house!"
1323446,7011003,2013-09-03,2874854,Sonya,"You'd be cray to stay in a hotel instead of Laura's. Laura and Rex are the nicest people you could meet and made me forget I paid them to stay there. They truly love hosting. Their place is so convenient to get to downtown, there is a bus right around the corner, I used it the whole time and never drove. They also live in a cute neighborhood with a mad good coffee shop, El Diablo, restaurants and grocery within walking distance. It was like being at home if my house was that nice!"
1323446,7169138,2013-09-09,3740729,Krisi,"My sister and I had a great stay here.  We ended up really liking the Queen Anne district.  There are two great coffee locations, only a couple of blocks away from this property, which are right next door to one another (one is Café Diablo, and I can't remember the name of the other, but it's French.)  We would start our mornings here and then catch the #13 bus, which is just right up the street from the coffee shops.  We had access to a living area, as well, which made things seem very spacious.  Both Laura and Rex were very kind, thoughtful and helpful.  We would definitely stay here again if we were ever in the area."
1323446,7245927,2013-09-13,4634573,Brandi,"Laura was amazing! Very sweet and very helpful with directions and she also gave me a ride to the train station early in the morning!!  Location is great! Very quiet residential area, bus stop is really close that will take you to the city. There are restaurants,bars,markets within walking distance.  I was traveling alone and had an amazing experience! "
1323446,7558068,2013-09-24,4143020,Diana,"Laura's place was excellent. It's private (the garden-level floor), quiet, clean, comfortable and spacious. It's in the beautiful Queen Anne neighborhood - a bit of a hike up some very steep hills (steps in some placed). I didn't have a car, and didn't use the buses or taxis, but it was fine (good calf and thigh exercise!). There's an amazing Cuban coffee shop about 3 mins away (El Diablo Coffee - (website hidden)) and a wonderful pastry shop right next door to El Diablo (Le Reve - (website hidden) Laura is lovely - I only saw her very briefly, but would have liked to have more time to chat. "
1323446,7646570,2013-09-28,8168807,Rebekah,"This was a great little spot! I met Rex briefly and only talked to Laura on the phone, but they were both laid back and easy to talk to. We loved the space and the location of the house - close enough to everything but away from the hustle and bustle. Thanks Laura!"
1323446,8060652,2013-10-14,2949481,MaryEm,We appreciated Laura and Rex's friendliness and flexibilty.  The accomodations were comfortable and accessable.
1323446,8127437,2013-10-16,4957119,Angela,"This was a wonderful place to stay!  Very bright, clean, and in a perfect location!  Thank you, Laura!"
1323446,8449857,2013-10-31,6399247,Zach,"An amazing location and deal for anyone staying in Seattle. Laura and Rex make the nicest of hosts. The guest room is large and cozy, no complaints to be had."
1323446,8950619,2013-11-27,9923916,Denis,It's a very nice house in a quiet neighborhood and Laura and Rex are fantastic hosts! I really enjoyed my time there.
1323446,9327653,2013-12-21,10674201,Wendy,"I had to make a last minute booking due to a broken water heater at the previous place that I had booked. Laura was very kind, accommodating, and made sure that I would be comfortable. Her place was very clean, cozy, and well stocked. Also, the location is wonderful as it is two blocks from Queen Anne ave. I will definitely direct other people to her place in the future."
1323446,9432258,2013-12-28,2192116,Allison,"Laura (and Rex) were very friendly, easy to talk to, and great hosts! Their AirBnB apartment was perfect for our situation-- I live just 2 blocks from them and needed a comfortable and close place for my brother and his girlfriend to stay while my family was in town for the holidays. Their apartment is clean and spacious with lots of light and a nice bathroom.  Even though they were away during the time of my family's visit, Laura made sure to call me to check in periodically and ask if we had any questions or needed any help.  "
1323446,9567896,2014-01-02,7413305,Noelle,"Laura was a great host! Warm, welcoming and a  comfortable, clean and a beautiful space. My husband and I stayed for 4 nights and would recommend it to anyone who is staying in Queen Anne!"
1323446,10096239,2014-01-30,6511111,Maura,"This place was fabulous and Laura and Rex were great hosts! We didn't have a car and it was super easy to get around all over the place on foot and on various buses. We loved staying in a cute neighborhood that we otherwise would not have known about, yet was central to all the exploring we wanted to do. Thanks!
"
1323446,10138859,2014-02-02,11525808,Adrianna,Cozy place to stay in Queen Anne. We really felt like we were on vacation. The room felt luxurious but also homey. Would stay again.
1323446,10275965,2014-02-10,5237022,Traci,"Nice, clean place.  Great location!  I was able to jump on the bus from the house easily."
1323446,10351046,2014-02-15,11663404,Kathryn Kate,"Very helpful and friendly, Lovely space."
1323446,10429061,2014-02-18,11490300,Laura,"Laura and Rex were excellent hosts.  They were quick to respond to our questions prior to arrival.  They were very flexible on when we checked in/out.  While we never actually met them, they left several Seattle guide books for us and offered recommendations on sites and nightlife near Queen Anne.  They had a gorgeous, spacious, and clean guest suite.  The space was perfect for two of us!  Also, the location in Queen Anne made for easy transportation to all of the major attractions in Seattle.  We were within walking distance of great coffee shops and restaurants on Queen Anne Blvd. Overall, we had a very positive experience.  We would certainly recommend Laura and Rex's place to other travelers!"
1323446,10488916,2014-02-21,1933936,Karen,"My stay at laura's place was great! The response prior to my arrival was quick. She was very warm and welcoming, and even offered to drop me off at pike's place. The bedroom, bathroom and living space were tastefully decorated. Having my own private entrance was also a plus. The neighborhood was quiet and safe. It was also convenient to the bus stops. Next time I visit I will definitely stay with her again. Laura did an excellent job! I hope I will get the chance to talk more with her next time."
1323446,11065844,2014-03-18,12772478,Mack,"Laura's accommodations were very nice and clean and located in a quiet neighborhood. I worked late hours so the private entrance was nice, so that I did not disturb her. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anybody."
1323446,11192506,2014-03-24,4566791,Jae,"This was my first time using my own airbnb account (normally we use my person's). I definitely can say that my (our!) stay at Laura and Rex's hideaway has been the best one experience yet. 

The place is warm, cozy, comfortable, and spacious. I really couldn't think of anything we might've needed that wasn't provided. 

Rex and Laura are super-helpful with anything that might arise. Also, they'll leave their guests treats ^^

The neighborhood, too, is great. There are plenty of restaurant, grocery, and coffee/tea/chocolate options as well as bookstores and gift shops."
1323446,11316151,2014-03-29,1276309,George,"Rex and Laura were very kind, generous and thoughtful hosts. The basement apartment is really lovely and the walk into downtown Seattle is short and picturesque."
1323446,11375164,2014-03-31,3961769,Leo,"We stayed 2 nights in Laura's lovely home and it was a really great location to spend our week-end in Seattle.  
The house is beautiful and calm. Laura & Rex are welcoming and offer us a bottle of good red wine. I recommend this place and I will definitely stay here again."
1323446,11459207,2014-04-03,7460552,Redford,"Laura was a great host, had a lovely stay and she was very kind helping me figure out Seattle!  Thank you! "
1323446,11693366,2014-04-12,13493987,David,This was a six star experience.  Laura and Rex are great--they are warm and friendly--and the house which looks like it was built in the 1920's is in fact only a few years old.  It reflects Rex's incredible craftsmanship (he built it himself).  Highly recommended!
1323446,11871368,2014-04-17,2544554,Joel,"Laura and Rex have a beautiful home. Initially, we were unable to connect on our first day, but her prior instructions about getting in via the back gate provided the hints we needed.  Their dog Toby, was very loud when we knocked on the front door and no one happened to be home at the time, but overall during sunny days in Seattle my kids jumped on the trampoline under the blooming Magnolia (or Cherry) tree - what a lovely complement to the stay!  There was a small refrigerator that we initially didn't find because it was not a traditional stand-up.  The home has wi-fi, but it was off at the end of our stay (due to power issues, possibly).  The location and the first two beds and the hot shower were really the best parts...  The 3nd & 4th beds were a couch and an air mattress, which some may not prefer.
Anyway, I would highly recommend this location and Laura as a host when you travel to Seattle!"
1323446,12139470,2014-04-23,14341312,Alice,"Laura and Rex were fabulous hosts. Not only was their apartment a comfortable and convenient stay, but the two of them offered us great advice about the neighborhood and about hiking right outside of Seattle. We were very lucky to happen upon their apartment and will certainly stay there again if we return to the city"
1323446,12503050,2014-05-04,14064276,Alex,I really enjoyed the stay--very comfortable and friendly host.  Price is extremely reasonable considering the place is only a 5 min drive from Space Needle.  Definitely will be a repeat customer if I ever need a place to stay!
1323446,12778155,2014-05-11,3137758,Kelly,"We had a wonderful experience.  Laura and Rex are very personable and flexible.  The location is great and allows you to walk to the main street of Queen Anne.  We had a car and parking was never a problem.  They included a few items to make our stay more enjoyable - a book with love poems on our pillow, assorted breakfast foods and chocolate!  We hope to return some day!"
1323446,12960017,2014-05-15,1793253,Alejandro,"My wife and I just came back from a quick get away to (email hidden)ura and Rex were awesome host!!! and the place is totally lovely!! as owners and host of an Airbnb place our self we really have a full perspective of the great job they do keeping their guests happy and welcome.
I have to say that we are going to copy some of the details that makes a difference while choosing a place to stay.
The house may look to you as an ""old house"" with good maintenance but if fact is a relative new house with a great atmosphere and great vibe...we totally love it!
awesome place to stay in Seattle.
Thanks guys...we see you next."
1323446,13211009,2014-05-22,6473525,David,"This was a great experience.  The accommodations were very spacious with plenty of room to spread out, although we did not spend that much time at Laura's house.   This was due, in part, to its proximity to the Queen Anne commercial district, only two blocks away.  The rooms are extremely quiet and the beds very comfortable.  This was one of the best places we have ever stayed and we would definitely go back."
1323446,13271705,2014-05-24,11311414,Gwen,This property offers a huge amount of space for a small family and lots of room for two. We found it very comfortable and well located and only wished we could've stayed longer to explore more of the area. Laura and Rex were wonderful hosts- thanks so much for your wonderful hospitality!
1323446,13679500,2014-06-02,6602499,Ryan,"My experience at Laura and Rex's abode was really great. Their house is in a beautiful quiet neighborhood and if you are not familiar with Queen Anne just know that it is quite simply awesome. Great coffee shops and restaurants within 5 minutes of walking, lots of trees and unique houses with really fun people to talk to. The suite that we stayed in was why I love Air BnB, it was filled with really cool furniture and art works that spoke volumes to their character. We had a chance to meet the fine couple and they are a blast, its just too bad we couldn't spend more time as we had to run out fairly quickly. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting the area, heck I may just come back too! Thanks Laura and Rex."
1323446,13816457,2014-06-05,8631573,Kate,"Thank you, Laura for a lovely stay at your place! What a wonderful home and neighborhood! The comfortable bed and all of the thoughtful details you provided made our stay restful. We appreciate your welcoming accommodations! "
1323446,13913917,2014-06-08,13527161,Erin,This was our first time using AirBnB and it was a great experience.  Super cute and quiet house in a great neighborhood.  We had a wonderful stay.
1323446,14089886,2014-06-11,15366494,Val,This was the first time I have used Airbnb and was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was. This apartment was great value for money and it was so good to be out of the city and in a very pleasant community. Microwave and small fridge were provided but with so many coffee shops and cafes nearby they were hardly used. Although it is a basement apartment it was filled was light that was great during the day but did mean I was awake early in the morning. We used public transport which was very easy and convenient and the bus drivers were very helpful. Thanks Laura and Rex.
1323446,14165110,2014-06-13,15789462,Jack (John),"We had a great stay with Laura and Rex. The space was more than enough for the 3 of us, the beds were comfortable, and the shower was quite nice! The area around their house (Queen Anne) was great for restaurants and was just a quick walk away. Buses into downtown were also very easy. This was my first airbnb experience and it couldn't have gone any better. I would definitely stay here again!"
1323446,14233650,2014-06-15,8275091,Carolyn,"Our stay was absolutely perfect.  Laura and Rex kindly provided everything we could possibly need for two people who just travelled cross country.  We greatly appreciated the coffee & coffee maker.  The location in Queen Anne is perfect for touristing, there are many restaurants nearby as well as a Safeway should you need anything.  The 3 or 4 bus picks up just a few blocks away.  "
1323446,15119109,2014-07-02,7533205,Elizabeth,"Laura was such an accommodating friendly host. Communication with her was super easy & convenient. The place is a basement suite in a cute quiet area with lots of light in the main room. Very nice additions were a small fridge with yogurt, coffee/teas, other light snacks & TV (not that we used it). It was perfect for the two of us for the one night. "
1323446,15192568,2014-07-04,16992521,Brendan,"Laura was very accommodating to our schedule, allowing us to leave our bags after our check-out so that we didn't have to lug them around Seattle while we toured. House is in a great location with ease of access to most of the Queen Anne bus lines 2,3,4 and 13. It was just the two of us but there was plenty of space downstairs with the bathroom, bedroom and den screen-partitioned from the rest of the house.

Laura leads a busy life so please contact her well in advance of arrival. We came a little too early and found the space not ready for use. Also, make sure around holidays to check to see if others are coming in after you as this is a well frequented AirBnB and Couchsurfing stop, and Laura hosts other guests as well."
1323446,15673718,2014-07-14,14189109,Sarah,"Great location with bus stop, restaurants,  views of the city just a few steps away. Rooms were comfortable, having a sitting room with table was a bonus."
1323446,15917761,2014-07-18,4732002,Joy,"Laura's place was even better than expected!  Queen Anne is a wonderful, quaint neighborhood perfect for evening walks and convenient bus stops. Laura was a gracious and helpful host that made even easier."
1323446,16076788,2014-07-22,13857616,Samuel,"Laura and Rex were extremely welcoming and cordial. They provided us with everything we needed and more, were quick to respond to any questions or needs that we had. They also gave us plenty of suggestions for places to eat and things to do around the event that we were viewing at Key Arena. The place was exactly as advertised, clean, and well stocked with all necessities. Neighborhood was quiet and surrounded with huge beautiful houses... enjoyed our stay very much."
1323446,16303095,2014-07-25,16787959,Donna,"We were so pleased with our recent stay. The apartment was very clean and quite comfortable and convenient to all the usual sightseeing locations in Seattle.  Although the house is in a quiet neighborhood, it is surprisingly close to Seattle Center (just a little over a mile) straight down a steep hill. If you like to hike, you could actually walk down to the center. We had a car, but found that we could have done a lot of our sightseeing without one.  If we come again for a longer stay, we might try using the bus and transit system.  Our hosts were very accommodating. They provided everything we needed for our visit (even an leaving us an umbrella for a rainy morning)."
1323446,16367292,2014-07-26,100532,Mary,"What a wonderful place to stay! My husband and I came for a 1 night stay, and were lucky enough to have found Laura and Rex's place.  We were just a 5 min walk from the heart of upper queene anne, and since it was on a Thursday, we were able to hit the farmer's market with all the local outdoor food vendors, plus breakfast at the 5 Spot!  The space was huge, and very comfortable. The decor and furnishings were an added bonus....we were very intrigued with several pieces. Loved our stay. We'd definitely come stay again. Great hosts!"
1323446,16454290,2014-07-28,13779646,Vona,Laura and Rex were wonderful hosts with a lovely space to share. We were sorry to have so little time to share with these great folks and recommend their place highly! It is very convenient to the downtown Seattle - even walkable to the Space Needle. You might want some other mode of transport to return due to the steep encline! 
1323446,16776200,2014-08-02,1012970,Janice,"This house was so much better than expected. The location was great; super easy access to downtown and Kerry park. Queen Anne has a nice downtown area with small shops and restaurants. Free parking! We had our own private entrance to the bottom level. However, it was still clean, bright, and well-lit. There was a small living room area with a TV hooked up to Netflix. The bathroom provided plenty of amentities. The beds were all comfortable. The hosts were friendly and even suprised us with a fresh peach and apple. Our only con is that we wish there were curtains on all the windows. Would definitely recommend and stay here again!"
1323446,17043010,2014-08-06,14327938,Herminia,Thank you for the way you welcomed us. Our stay was very pleasant. The neighborhood is calm and close to the city center. The apartment is very convenient. 
1323446,17123444,2014-08-07,7813570,Michael,Sweet place. Wonderful neighborhood. Two blocks to Le Reve Bakery. Close to downtown. Hosts very gracious and helpful.
1323446,17214426,2014-08-09,17198731,Nina,"My boyfriend and I stayed two nights at Laura and Rex's place. The accommodations were homey, clean and provided more than enough space for two people. They  even threw in a couple of additional amenities that we appreciated!  Their space is very eclectic. They live in a beautiful neighborhood with public transportation nearby and accessible. They are within walking distance of cool shops, restaurants, and two grocery stores.  Rex was incredibly helpful and answered our questions about getting around. Both were kind to us and we felt welcomed in their home.

We only had one small concern. We requested an earlier check-in time weeks before the visit (per the suggestion of other reviews),  but there seemed to be a little confusion in the days leading to our stay. We weren't sure if we could do the early check - in. However, it all worked out! Rex and Laura were great about making it happen (even as they prepared to travel).

Overall, I definitely recommend this place. If you choose to do early check - in, try to let them know as soon as possible. Communicating via text message seemed to work best."
1323446,17350379,2014-08-11,16687685,Marjorie,"It was a wonderful stay! The rooms had everything we could possibly need or want. They were clean, spacious, and as described. There were so many places nearby to eat and visit nearby. Overall, very satisfied."
1323446,18002587,2014-08-20,7737641,Gerhard,"A wonderful and quiet place.
Laura did everything to make us feel good.
The house is much better than the photographs could show.
Thank You Laura!"
1323446,18450330,2014-08-26,5154473,Andrew,"Great place. Very comfortable bed, and surprisingly spacious, with high ceilings and a good amount of light for a basement. Would definitely stay again!"
1323446,18875541,2014-09-02,16112085,Jason,"My friend and I stayed at Laura's home for 4 days/nights while going to a convention in downtown Seattle. When we arrived we were greeted by Rex and he showed us around the part of the house where we stayed, then asked about our plans in Seattle and offered advice for places to go and ways to get around. Although we actually ended up spending little time at the place itself and not interacting with Laura and Rex much since we spent 14 to 16 hours a day out and about, their place was clean and well kept and they were nice and helpful in our few encounters with them. If I travel to Seattle again in the future or know anyone else with plans to do so, I would definitely recommend this place."
1323446,19154499,2014-09-07,18878377,Lisa,"Everything was awesome - clean, beautiful and lots of space. The attention to detail, from coffee to bath products was top notch. We loved the proximity to lots of great restaurants and bars on Queen Anne (just a short 2 blocks away). Laura and Rex were gracious hosts and we would absolutely recommend them to anyone!"
1323446,19280890,2014-09-09,1666581,Derek,"Our stay in Seattle was great.  The house is beautiful, and the space was big, private, and well decorated.  The neighbourhood was full of equally nice and well kept homes.  The hill was pretty steep, but the view on the way makes it worth doing on foot at least once.  Laura was very friendly, and provided some great info for our day on Vashon Island.  Overall it was bigger, nicer, and more affordable than a hotel.  I'd recommend staying here to anyone visiting Seattle."
1323446,19475387,2014-09-13,2498918,Meagan,The apartment was absolutely lovely. We had a wonderful experience with Laura and Rex. It was very clean with all the amenties that we needed for the week. It was the perfect landing spot for our busy week in Seattle seeing family and old friends. 
1323446,19674626,2014-09-16,17651314,Kyle,"Large, comfortable, and quiet space. Enough room for 2-5 people. The location in Seattle is great! The Queen Anne area has a great movie theatre, donut shop, and cafés. Night life is also there. Laura greeted us as we arrived and provided ideal suggestions. "
1323446,19984807,2014-09-21,12098399,Robert,"We didn't meet Laura, but the place was great!  Very clean, exactly as pictured, great location, affordable, and lots of nice little amenities."
1323446,20224000,2014-09-26,7931776,Lisa,"What a wonderful place to stay!  The apt was clean and spacious with lovely decor.  Located in a lovely, quaint neighborhood.
Laura was such a sweet hostess and we enjoyed visiting with her.
Easy access to the bus, within walking distance to Queen Anne Ave where there are wonderful shops, grocery stores, restaurants, etc.  The restaurant, 'Grub' on Boston St had a wonderful weekend breakfast."
1323446,20416791,2014-09-29,3137758,Kelly,This was our second stay with Laura & Rex.  Laura was so accommodating ... my daughter had just returned from Africa and she allowed us to do laundry which was such a blessing.  Very flexible regarding check in time.  We appreciate the small details in the room -- freshly ironed sheets and pillow cases and chocolates!  This room is also close to SPU and walking distance to shops in Queen Anne -- it's perfect!  
1323446,21147400,2014-10-12,21192714,Rik,A great experience with a welcoming hosts.  Both Rex and Laura were helpful and enjoyable to chat with.  They were accommodating with our luggage and offering us umbrellas when it rained.  The space was just as described and fit our needs well.  
1323446,21295005,2014-10-14,21154566,Angelica,Laura was absolutely wonderful! My friend and I arrived a little early so we got to meet and chat with Laura upon arrival. She's very sweet and welcoming. Her place is very quaint and very clean. It is extremely roomy and I really enjoyed the Netflix for the one evening that we stayed in. It's very close to cafes and restaurants and only a mile away from the space needle. My friend and I opted to walk  instead of drive. The views along the way are gorgeous! The details in the room were also nice. She has all the toiletries in case you forget something and she left us some chocolates and bananas. The bed is extremely comfortable. I would stay with Laura again if I had to be back in Seattle.
1323446,21698312,2014-10-22,16258772,Ruth Ann,"We arrived late in the day, but the lights were on and it was all cozy inside and ready for us.   The bed was sooooooooo comfortable and it had wonderful sheets.  The nicest I have ever slept on.   Everything was so pretty in every room--just lots of lovely things to look at and make you feel at home----a soft leather couch and recliner and a little rocker.   Nice table lamps.
We had a microwave and little fridge.   Laura had several coffees and nice teas that we could use, so each morning we had a muffin and some coffee.   
The neighborhood was just lovely with pretty homes with flowers blooming.  We could walk almost everywhere, but we also used the buses--sometimes just for fun.  We were there for opera and we were able to walk to that, and also to a very friendly church only about 3 blocks away!  We occasionally saw Rex and Laura and could always ask them anything.  It was our first bnb experience and we hope to stay with Rex and Laura again in the big Yellow House!"
1323446,22399264,2014-11-05,20789756,Michelle,"Laura and Rex were wonderful hosts. The space includes not only a bedroom with a very comfortable bed, a private bathroom, but also a very large living area which includes two extra beds. I could feel that my hosts have spent time and care into making the space welcoming and homey. I loved the antique furniture and tasteful decor.

There are plenty of toiletry supplies if you forgot to bring your own. Extra towels and blankets. Umbrella and a grocery bag (there’s a shopping bag fee of $0.05 in Seattle if you didn’t BYO) The living area has a TV, microwave, mini-fridge, coffee machine and utensils in case you decide to buy takeout from the many eateries just a few blocks away and eat at home. There’s tea and coffee, but they also leave treats for you.

Laura is one of the sweetest and most generous person I have ever met. It was the most comfortable, cozy, and welcoming place to spend two weeks. This is my first Air BnB experience and I could not have picked a better place."
1323446,22710243,2014-11-12,6174551,Lawrence,"Laura and her partner were both really nice and welcoming, the area is fantastic and Seattle is a brilliant city. "
1323446,23355649,2014-11-30,3291751,Joanne,"Our week at Rex and Laura's cute apartment was just great. Rex and Laura were extremely welcoming and friendly, making sure that we had everything we needed. The treats during our visit were so thoughtful.  The apartment itself is great with high ceilings, lots of windows and light, clean and new, and big. The bed is very comfortable. Lots of clean, good quality bedding and towels. Toiletries in case you forget anything. It's nicer than the pictures lead you to believe. We would stay here again for sure."
1323446,23656207,2014-12-07,6139163,Jennifer,I booked this home for two of my colleagues and they absolutely LOVED this place and the warm hospitality they received from Laura. Thank you for taking care of them for me!
1323446,23862661,2014-12-13,22088412,Laurie,Laura and Rex are delightful and they have a lovely home. The accommodations were comfy and quiet; loved the luxurious sheets and towels. We couldn't have asked for a better airbnb experience!
1323446,23974925,2014-12-15,869312,Matt,"What a beautiful house and a wonderful host! The apartment space is incredibly comfortable, with lots of natural light (at least during our visit, Seattle was unexpectedly sunny). The beds were great, etc., etc. We unfortunately didn't get to meet Laura as our planes arrived very late and our agenda was packed, but she was incredibly responsive to text messages before and during our stay."
1323446,24125855,2014-12-20,6328719,Matt,"Great space, wonderfully appointed. Little touches like comfy linens, clean bathroom with great water pressure in the shower,..not to mention located centrally for driving out or walking nearby. Laura and Rex are pleasant and beautiful people.  "
1323446,24362424,2014-12-27,22770685,Jane,"My husband and spent the week leading up to Christmas in Seattle at Laura's beautiful home and we felt like we were at home. Instructions on how to find it were accurate. It was spotlessly clean, beautifully appointed, quiet and comfortable. All the helpful information listed on the Air BnB site is accurate and Laura was available to answer questions and took the time to add a few festive touches to our space. We will stay here again when we visit Seattle and would highly recommend it to others. "
1323446,24571839,2014-12-30,25204519,Stephan,"This was a great location for us - a quiet neighborhood yet close enough to the space needle etc. that my boys and I could walk there (yes, it's quite a hill but our hosts told us about a route with no traffic). Plenty of space, neat, clean and interesting decorations. You can't go wrong staying here."
1323446,24767061,2015-01-02,24804720,Mark,"Laura and Rex were more than Terrific! Even after we lost one of their keys the were still incredibly friendly and welcoming. Laura offered us some old clothes as gifts and she was a great person to chat with. The Location was super convenient for two people traveling all over the Seattle Area. Their House is beautiful, and the apartment offered had plenty of space and amenities. The house is also a short walk to some of the best views of Down Town Seattle and Mount Rainier. "
1323446,25072537,2015-01-05,25514497,Joseph,Laura and Rex are wonderfully amazing. They are such kind people and it really enhances the stay in their beautiful home. It is very clean and well kept. Laura and Rex do a great job making sure you are comfortable for your stay and have everything you need. Their place is in a great location with shops and everything you need basically in walking distance. I definitely plan on staying with Laura and Rex the next time I am in Seattle. 
1323446,25373364,2015-01-13,25759865,Andrew,Great location for everyone who needs a central point in Seattle. Rex and Laura are amazing. Everything was welcoming and cozy. I Would definitely stay here again. There are great restaurants within blocks of this location. Trader Joe's is also a few blocks away. 
1323446,26291463,2015-02-09,9499115,John,"Laura and Rex were wonderful hosts, definitely going above and beyond with food, offers for rides, and information about the area.  The apartment was wonderful, large and comfy and beautifully decorated.  The bedroom was great and the bed in the living room was also very comfortable.  Its in  a very nice neighborhood with lots of trees close to buses and restaurants, about a 15 minute walk from the space needle with great views of Seattle along the way.   Its a very steep walk home but you can always catch the bus if you prefer.  We would definitely stay again."
1323446,26423688,2015-02-12,4960102,Alexis,"Great location within walking distance of restaurants, coffee shops, and a fantastic nail salon for those seeking out a manicure. 

The hosts were welcoming, and provided many healthy snacks and other niceties. "
1323446,26699503,2015-02-17,26075382,Mat,"This is a beautiful place to stay!  Easy walking to several coffee shops a block away, and also to the Seattle Center/Downtown if you're feeling up for a little adventure. 

We came in late the first night and Laura was very accommodating, making sure we could access the room. I will definitely be referring my friends to this place for a lovely Seattle getaway."
1323446,26989663,2015-02-23,7436419,Aaron,"I loved staying here.  I felt at home right away, and it's a wonderful opportunity to stay in one of Seattle's best neighborhoods (Queen Anne).  Just blocks from an array of dining options on Queen Anne Blvd., and minutes to get downtown.  Laura has thought of everything here, and was a wonderful host.  Laura even showed me around the city and is an amazing woman if you get a chance to meet her.  "
1323446,27369948,2015-03-02,5610618,Rebecca,"Short, but sweet (especially the pumpkin pie)! Laura and rex were very accommodating. Sadly, we did not get to meet these two face to face due to our nocturnal schedule, but they were available by cell phone whenever we needed to ask a question. They also went out if their way to give travel recommendations and places to see...you get the feeling they love to host!"
1323446,27506735,2015-03-06,22097403,Eric,"Our stay with Laura and Rex was perfect. We absolutely loved the space, our hosts were very friendly, and the location is quite convenient to Seattle Center. They were also in the process of adding a full kitchen to the space, which is going to be a great addition. Would definitely stay here again."
1323446,28085076,2015-03-17,27758807,Christie,"Laura's place was super comfy and homey. I particularly liked the high quality bedding and bath towels.  The space was very roomy, more than I had imagined and the location was awesome. So close to Trader Joe's (my favorite store) and great coffee shops and eateries.  I really liked the experience of being in a local neighborhood.  So much better than the sterile feel of a hotel.  We got to ""live"" in Seattle for our three days there. 
And Laura and Rex are very interesting and lovely people, made us feel important and welcome.  The house is amazing. All in all, I loved it!"
1323446,28177075,2015-03-19,28141710,Bobbie,Best place in Seattle. Close to everything and the kitchen is just perfect to make you feel at home. 
1323446,28542016,2015-03-25,3137758,Kelly,We've stayed with Rex And Laura many times and it is always a pleasure!
1323446,28665233,2015-03-28,6505032,Janice,"Loved the house, loved the (email hidden)d especially appreciated our hosts. Rex and Laura welcomed us as if we were family with advice on transportation, money-saving tips on getting tickets, ie. EMP at Seattle Center, and so much more. 
The downstairs apartment is charmingly decorated with everything we could possibly need including a full kitchen, tv with Roku & Netflix, ample towels & toiletries. 
Also it is an easy walk to cafes, shops, Trader Joe's & Safeway. I enjoyed being in a neighborhood...instead of a touristy hotel/area. Here you get the feeling of what life in Seattle is actually like.
This is where I want to stay whenever I visit Seattle! Highest recommendation."
1323446,28760384,2015-03-29,347913,Suzi,"This AirBnB space was so comfortable and beautiful. The basement space has plenty of day lighting. It feels private and has all the amenities we needed. 
Laura and Rex were very welcoming and made our arrival and departure a breeze. 
The location was a very quick and direct drive from Seattle Center, which is where we spent most of this trip. 
This will be my top choice of places to stay when visiting Seattle with others."
1323446,28891806,2015-03-31,6440624,Joel,"Very good AirBnB stay. The space was excellent, and gave us lots of room to spread out. Comfortable beds, and some nice extra conveniences: TV with Netflix, large bathroom with toiletries. Laura and Rex were great hosts, who made us feel welcome and even let us keep our bags at their home after checkout before we left for the airport. All in all, an excellent time in Seattle."
1323446,29019977,2015-04-02,27959393,Autumn,"We completely loved staying at Laura and Rex's! The apartment is fabulous, the pictures don't do it justice. Lots of space, amazing price, beautiful neighborhood, extremely comfortable, excellent location, inviting hosts:) I would move in permanently if I could! Thank you for the hospitality!!"
1323446,33622531,2015-05-30,33330154,Kristine,We enjoyed our stay. The listing was LOVELY! 
1323446,33846422,2015-06-01,21899956,Mandy,The place of Laura's is quiet and safe and it looks exactly like what has been described on the website. Laura and her husband are very considerate and provided enough information for us to have a wonderful time in Seattle. We will definitely choose to stay here next time. 
1323446,34069209,2015-06-04,31997776,Debbie,We were welcomed by Laura and Rex and offered a quick tour of the neighborhood to help us get our bearings. The location was fantastic. It is a couple of blocks from a range of restaurants and shopping (including Trader Joe's and Safeway). It also is close to several bus stops that will get you almost anywhere else you want to go. The house is about a mile from the heart of the tourist-heavy area of Seattle and the walk down isn't bad. You do have to climb a lots of hills to get back so we took a bus up most days we were there. The neighborhood around the house was very neat and we enjoyed seeing a lot of the non-touristy parts of town. The kitchen includes a gas-top stove and microwave so we shopped and made several meals there. I would highly recommend this place for a stay.
1323446,34411052,2015-06-08,9796643,Lorena,"Beautiful neighborhood, very nice accomodations. Hosts are lovely. Quiet and spacious area complete with sitting room and tv, kitchen, etc. We loved it and plan to go back!"
1323446,34698211,2015-06-11,21543050,Tina,"It was a pleasant stay at Laura's. The house is elevated as shown in the picture and the full size windows are installed, so you don't feel staying at a basement space at all. All the amenities functioned perfectly, the bed was very comfortable for quality rests. The neighborhood is walkable and has lots of good coffee places, restaurants, bookstores; one can easily spend a whole day here. On top of the hardware, Laura is what made our stay even better. She is very welcoming and accommodating for our needs. In sum, this is the place we will come back for and recommend for friends.  "
1323446,35289418,2015-06-17,5778553,Cyndee,"Laura and Rex's place was amazing! I visited for the Seattle Marathon and the location, space and every part of my stay was perfect. 

Never having been to Seattle, I just wanted to make sure that I was close to the starting line. Luckily, Queen Anne is the best place in the city - close to tons of great restaurants and grocery stores and 1  mile walk downhill to the needle, monorail and etc. Kerry park is a few blocks away for the best views of Seattle and Fremont/Ballard are a quick drive away. Parking was super easy and the neighborhood is super safe. 

The space is great for 2 people. One of my friends from Portland joined me last minute and there was tons of room for her to join. 
The kitchen was perfect for making quick breakfast before the race. The bed is super comfortable and was perfect for relaxing after the race. 

I would definitely come back for another visit!

1323446,36001449,2015-06-24,7827815,Marilyn,Laura picked us up at Union Station and gave us a lay of the land so we were acclimated to where we were at her home in relation to the City which really did help us. She was always available and extremely nice to not only us but our sister-in-law who came to visit. The apartment is very nicely done with everything we needed including a full kitchen. We felt very comfortable there. Bus line is 1/2 block away which goes to City taking us everywhere we wanted to go.
1323446,36289676,2015-06-27,21674995,Jess,"We had wonderful time staying at Laura's place. It was spacious, comfortable, and welcoming.

1323446,38372183,2015-07-15,28872359,Jerry,"Our stay was very pleasant and our host was very friendly and available to assist us with information about the area.  The apartment is well kept and conveniently located.  It was tight but worked for the one night we had 5 people there, and was great for the rest of the stay when only 2 were there.  We truly enjoyed our stay any will likely try to stay there again when we return to Seattle."
1323446,38551246,2015-07-16,7097482,Elaine,"Awesome place, awesome hosts, awesome neighborhood!

1323446,38695183,2015-07-18,4005381,Patti,We really enjoyed our time in Seattle because we had a welcoming home there. The space was perfect - private and quiet.  The rooms are beautifully decorated and Laura has thought of everything - even bubble bath!!!  We were able to walk to Queen Anne street and enjoy the shops & restaurats (five spot was great!). We also walked to Seattle center in about 30 minutes.  Highly recommend this home!

1323446,43950506,2015-08-23,37171880,Sandeepa,We felt comfortable.  The neighborhood was nice and very close to downtown area. All the instructions were very clear on the paper.

Also, Laura was very hospitable. I left my shirt accidentally in the closet. Thankfully Laura found it, and she agreed to mail it back to me for free!

I would definitely stay here again if I'm in the area."

1323446,45655168,2015-09-05,32609175,Andrea,"Laura is absolutely lovely. Her home is in a beautiful neighborhood in Queen Anne with easy to find free street parking. You can walk 1-2 blocks and quickly be at a variety of coffee shops, grocery stores, restaurants, or shops. Laura has decorated the rooms with beautiful and interesting objects. Everything is high quality, from the sheets, to the towels, to the items in the kitchen. Lots of extras like coffee, tea, and bath products were available. This was one of the most peaceful and relaxing trips we've ever taken."
1323446,46264869,2015-09-09,1228038,Dana,"Our stay here made for a wonderful experience of upper Queen Anne. Laura's lovely home apt. was perfect for our weekend celebration of art and music near the Seattle Center.  The sheets were exquisite, space was beautifully decorated, clean, and we enjoyed the kitchen with gas stove.    It is bright and cheerful in the apt.  There are great jogging routes in the neighborhood, the neighborhood is charming with grande old homes and cafe's.   Everything was beyond our expectations."

The location was great for us to explore most neighborhoods in the city. It was clean and the bed was sooooo comfy! There is even an assortment of bath products and a full kitchen (although we didn't end up using it). Laura was quick to communicate and very friendly via text. Coolio the cat even peeked out to say hi to us!"

This Queen Anne neighborhood is lovely and quiet yet only blocks away from a bustling area filled with restaurants and shops, as the description said. It was so easy to use the bus to travel downtown. The suite itself was so comfortable, well equipped, and private with a quiet back yard to sit and regroup, meditate, or whatever you needed. We wouldn't hesitate going back for a sec."

Lots of gratitude for this clean, colorful, haven to land in every night.

1323446,50426999,2015-10-12,31186496,Da,"很温馨的房间，我们三大一小住得非常舒服，附近有公园，儿童的playground,超市，药妆店，位置在山上位置，非常方便，景致很美。"
1323446,51083633,2015-10-17,177002,Tina,"What can I say that others haven't? We had the pleasure of meeting Laura and Rex. Fantastic hosts! Very very kind. Wished we had more time to relax and chat with the both of them. I sense great times would have been had from our brief encounter.

The place was great! Basement suite with all the required accommodations. Full bathroom, full kitchen, real bed, WiFi and Netflix. Felt like we stayed in a big spacious apartment.

The Queen Anne area was a great location! Far away from the crowds but still close to downtown. It's very quiet and safe. 
We were there to eat our way through Seattle. Restaurants and quaint shops were just a 5 minute walk away. Great neighbourhood! 

Thanks Laura and Rex for such a great and comfortable time! "
1323446,51887450,2015-10-25,29598882,Jennifer,"Laura and Rex were very friendly and responded immediately when we had a question. They are very nice, fascinating people and we had a great time talking with them.

The neighborhood is great.  It is quiet and you can easily walk or take public transit.  We parked our rental car and didn't use it while in Seattle. There are grocery stores, coffee shops, and restaurants within a few minutes walk.

The apartment was very comfortable and we enjoyed our time in as well as our time exploring Seattle.

Overall it was a great experience.  We will definitely stay with them again when we return to Seattle."
1323446,52271289,2015-10-27,35577593,Tim,Laura's place is very nice and well appointed   Great place to stay 
1323446,53507450,2015-11-09,16885781,Cyndy,"My second stay with Laura and experience was great again. I did not get a chance to talk with her as flew in later and had to fly out really early.  Laura made it easy to come and go. This location is so easy to get around. Did not have car first part of stay but was a couple blocks from restaurants, coffee shops and grocery. Such a great place and atmosphere for travelers."
1323446,54872907,2015-11-25,3916703,Mimi,"Our stay with Laura was perfect. We only wish we could have stayed longer. The pictures are completely accurate. The space was large, airy, dare I say sunny, and very comfortable. Parking was easy and walking to restaurants nearby was a nice treat. The views from the neighborhood were amazing. It was our first time in Seattle and we loved the Queen Anne area for the great old houses, and it's central location. If we come back again to Seattle, and we hope we will, we would definitely like to stay with Laura again."
1323446,55349535,2015-12-01,40642653,Cheryl,""" There's no place like home. "" This is how our family felt after an adventurous day of exploring Seattle! The apartment is spacioius and comfy. A great retreat after the busy day. It was Thanksgiving weekend and we didn't meet Laura until the end of our stay when she graciously offered us breakfast. See had everything ready for our early arrival on Thansgiving and was generous to allow us the extra time. 
The Queen Ann neighborhood is  a wonderful neighborhood conveniently located to all the sites. We had a car and found it easy to get to everyplace with no more than a short drive. Seattle is a fantastic city. We loved how each neighbor hood is unique. We would definitely stay with L aura again when we venture back!"
1323446,56589141,2015-12-15,3054702,Kristin,"Laura was very easy to reach via email, text and phone. My husband and I were in town for a 2 day conference so we weren't around much so we only crossed paths with Rex, her husband. 
The space was very nice. Tidy, spacious and perfect for us to fix meals and rest between our classes. We parked our car out front on Friday night and didn't use it until we hit the road to leave Monday morning. Walked everywhere, including up Queen Anne! Perfect!"
1323446,56954008,2015-12-20,43304016,Michael,"My first Airbnb experience and it was great.  Cool neighborhood, quiet and safe, parking out front, close to Pikes Place area. The basement apartment was clean, quirky and unique. Be sure to check out 5 Spot..an excellent breakfast spot a few blocks away. "
1976382,10435841,2014-02-18,5452140,Jesse,"A beautiful apartment that was very convenient to the rest of town. Autumn was great - stayed up late to let us in after a really late flight.

Would definitely stay again!"
1976382,10684092,2014-03-03,11572752,Charlotte,"Beautiful place and a helpful, friendly host! I'd love to stay here again. "
1976382,10764336,2014-03-06,5164828,Amanda,"Clean and simple space, housed three of us very comfortably. Nice little kitchen was the best part, along with the big windows and view out of them. 
Worth the money, comfy!"
1976382,11042266,2014-03-17,13007689,Regina,Autumn was very friendly and helpful. The space was very clean and comfortable and a great location. I would definitely recommend it!
1976382,11228750,2014-03-25,1120027,Clay,Perfect location in the heart of Seattle and Capitol Hill.  I would stay here again.  Autumn made it super-easy to check in and make it feel like a nice home away from home.
1976382,11937397,2014-04-19,464491,Katie,"Excellent apartment, extremely clean and very comfortable.  So easy to work with Autumn.  Nice neighborhood and convenient area.  Laundry room was clean and easy to use.  Very, very quiet apartment - didn't hear anyone in the building at all.  Just an overall great place to stay."
1976382,13349302,2014-05-26,13504196,Kevin,"My friends and I had a great time at 424 Summit Ave E! Our host Autumn was friendly and prompt and very easy to get in touch with. The location was perfect, and close to everything we wanted to check out in Seattle. I would recommend AirB&B, Autumn, and 424 Summit Ave to anyone planning on staying in Seattle. 

Kevin  "
1976382,13690035,2014-06-02,12155574,Angela,The Summit Avenue was perfect for our stay in Seattle.  It was conveniently located for food shopping and sightseeing and although not our first location choice turned out to be the best.  The apartment itself is very comfortable and well equipped with everything you would need for a home from home stay.  Thanks.  
1976382,14542385,2014-06-21,5207687,Sally,"This is a very nice apartment which is in a convenient location for doing a variety of things around Seattle.  It is very clean, comfortable and has nice, contemporary furnishings  It's really the perfect size for two, although four guests would fit if you don't mind close quarters.  The king bed in the master bedroom is very comfortable, and the sleeper sofa is much better than the standard sleeper sofa!  The choices for dining are so extensive in the immediate neighborhood, we didn't cook in the apartment, but it has a well equipped kitchen.  A big plus to this apartment is the available parking spot if you happen to have a car.  If we had not reserved this spot (for which you pay a little bit extra), I think it would have been very difficult to find parking in this neighborhood.
We were particularly pleased to be greeted by Autumn, who spent plenty of time answering questions and directing us to good spots to eat as we checked in. She gives the check-in process a nice personal touch which made us feel at home right away.  We were only in Seattle for a quick visit, but would definitely stay in this Capitol Hill apartment again."
1976382,17696134,2014-08-16,4888272,Abby,"What an awesome place! Autumn was absolutely fabulous!! She took care of everything and was so warm, friendly, and helpful. The apartment was immaculate and very smartly decorated, as well as, equipped with all the essentials.
 I stayed here with my two children, and we were very comfortable. The neighborhood was safe and quiet with everything we needed within walking distance - restaurants, coffee shops, and a grocery store. 
100% recommend this place - there is no doubt that I will be staying here next time I'm in town. 
"
1976382,19409656,2014-09-12,17510853,Helene,"Lovely apartment, as per the pictures. Great location: quiet neighbourhood, close to downtown, lots of services close by. Autumn is very helpful and easy to reach."
1976382,20283293,2014-09-27,17714901,Lucy,"Great stay on Capitol Hill. Autumn was really friendly and helpful. Had a bottle of wine waiting for us on arrival which was a great welcome. Loved Seattle, will definitely be going back! Apartment a little out of the city but close to bus route and taxis were too expensive. Would recommend."
1976382,20668474,2014-10-03,4690423,Galabina,"It was my first visit to Seattle and I totally loved it. Autumn was great with welcoming me, everything was absolutely clear in terms of instructions and I had everything I needed. The flat is really very modern and extremely clean. It was wonderful to come back home after my days at the office and chill out a bit before going out to explore the quirky little restaurants and bars of Capitol Hill. There is a grocery store literally a couple of blocks up from the flat. All in all - a great place to be. (There was construction work going on in the building next door, but it didn't bother me as I was out all day. Besides, Autumn had warned me about that in advance!)"
1976382,21668479,2014-10-21,21534902,Danielle,"This was the best location! A quick walk/bus/or uber away from everything. Very quiet (except for some neighboring construction- but didn't affect us very much). It was very clean, perfect amount of space for 2 people. Autumn was fantastic too. I would stay here again and recommend to all my friends. Perfect spot for us! "
1976382,22135002,2014-10-31,2318288,Tomasz,"The apartament is awesome and really luxury. Fully equiped - there is nothing you need more.Very clean.  Quiet, safe location - 10 dolars cab-way to downtown. Shops and restaurants in walking distance.
I'd definitely recommend this place.
Autumn is very nice and communicative person - she was waiting for me.
Thank you Autumn !
Tom"
1976382,22308996,2014-11-03,21614675,Lee,"Due to conflicting schedules, we actually didn't meet Autumn until our second day in Seattle, but she was more than welcoming via text/phone upon our arrival, then was sure to meet us when it was mutually convenient.

"
1976382,25716577,2015-01-24,562066,Eduardo,Great place! As in the pictures. Autumn is very responsive 
1976382,26021905,2015-02-01,2066810,Danyel,"I was greeted efficiently for checkin. The place is a lovely little apartment, well-located and nicely furnished, with a well-set kitchen two blocks from a great grocery store. You'll feel like you're living inside a high-end catalog. A perfect bit of quiet in an urban oasis."
1976382,27960537,2015-03-15,8219655,Rob,"We stayed here for 2 nights with our baby on a wet Seattle weekend. The apartment itself is really nice, comfortable and well equipped with everything you could possibly need. Location is great just a few blocks from Capitol Hill main strip. One warning is to make sure you also reserve parking with the rental otherwise it's really tough around the neighborhood.
Autumn was great - super communicative, flexible and friendly."
1976382,31949225,2015-05-12,5047711,Robert,"A great space and location. A few blocks walk to groceries, shops and restaurants. Lots of windows and light.  Very comfortable. "
1976382,32273959,2015-05-16,21060079,Nikhil,"The apartment was exactly as shown on the listing and the balcony was a plus. Autumn was excellent and made time to meet us on the first day to see that we were well settled. The place was clean, linen was fresh and aplenty and the kitchen was well stocked (could cook two dishes and a desert in one go). In addition, was the proximity to great restaurants and QFC (supermarket) which are all walking distance. I would however recommend to book for parking early as the slots are few, however, this is minor as cruising around the lanes would help you find a slot (otherwise there is always the QFC parking garage). Would definitely stay here again. Thank You Autumn and Airbnb....another great listing. "
1976382,35065978,2015-06-15,7336299,Jen,Autumn and her associate were very responsive. We arrived without any problems. We were greeted by Cristi who was very nice and gave us tons of info about the area. So helpful! The apt was very clean. We loved the neighborhood and the apt. 
1976382,35358762,2015-06-17,11278939,Elisabeth,"I had a wonderful stay! This apartment is complete with high end finishes and very comfortable. The king bed and TV with cable in the bedroom was a big plus. The location was perfect in the heart of Capitol Hill just a few blocks away from Broadway. Autumn was a fantastic host, checking us in and showing us around the place. This is a great hotel alternative for less cost and more amenities! "
1976382,40894064,2015-08-03,22120498,Harvey,"When we arrived we were met by one of Autumn's coworkers who helped us in and even helped carry some of our luggage and watched our toddler while we made a few more luggage runs. We had a lot of stuff. This was very helpful.

The apartment was clean and ready when we arrived. There was also a bottle of wine in the fridge as a welcome gift! Nice touch!

All together there were three of us -- myself, my wife, and my 3-year old. Our kid slept in a blow up mattress in the living room that we brought ourselves, but the couch is also a pull-out bed if your kid is old enough not to roll off. For the three of us, the place was plenty spacious. 

The location is excellent if you think you would like Capitol Hill and all the bars and restaurants there. You can also get to Seattle Center via bus without changing bus lines. A huge grocery store called QFC is in walking distance. You can also walk to Volunteer Park without much trouble. Cal Anderson park is also near, but we preferred Volunteer Park as it's a bit more kid friendly. Whenever we had a problem with the apartment, which was only once, Autumn's coworker came right over to help us out. 

Good times. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle."
1976382,41340529,2015-08-07,26648129,Mike,"The glowing reviews and premium pricing set my expectations high, but unfortunately the reality didn't quite live up to those expectations.

The unit was well updated in an otherwise worn out, dingy building.  Aside from a horrible smell emanating from the kitchen sink and a bathroom door that would not close, the space was otherwise clean and well appointed.  Contrary to another review, the unit we stayed in had no balcony.

The bed was very comfortable and the wifi dependable.  The check-in process was a bit more elaborate than it needed to be, but we were greeted with a bottle of wine and some mints, which was a nice touch.

The location is truly the prize attraction.  Far enough from the Broadway craziness to have quiet evenings but close enough to walk to most everything."
1976382,42566603,2015-08-14,38636969,Gian,Die Wohnung war schön und sauber. Checkin war sehr einfach und angenehm.
1976382,45050393,2015-08-31,13080419,Jennifer,The host canceled this reservation 39 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1976382,45813961,2015-09-06,13392713,Ken,"Autumn was great.  She was very friendly and helpful.  The apartment was exactly as advertised - modern, well furnished, and conveniently located."
1976382,47454360,2015-09-19,7882292,Jean,This apartment was very clean and well maintained.  The mattress on the bed was very comfortable.  The location was on a quiet street but within a short walk of groceries and restaurants and walkable to downtown and Pike Street Market.  Uber cars were never more than a few minutes away.  Autumn was easy to reach and responsive to our questions.  We will definitely consider this apt for future visits!
1976382,48145871,2015-09-23,219542,Nisa,"Autumn was a great host! Lovely, newly renovated apartment. She left me a lovely bottle of wine, took the time to have a conversation with me and a quick tour of the place. She recommended me to visit Volunteer Park - I went first thing the next morning for a run. It didn't disappoint! Thanks!!"
1976382,51533924,2015-10-21,21401883,Sven,"Really nice apartment in an awesome part of Seattle. The place was just as described, very clean and in flawless condition. With Broadway and Olive Way just a couple of minutes away, there's plenty to do. The place itself is in a quiet street, so your sleep will not be disturbed. This was my second stay in one of Autumn's apartments in the same building, and I'll be happy to come back."
1976382,52520497,2015-10-30,18513730,Michael,"I had another great stay at Autumn's place on Capitol Hill (2nd year in a row). Super clean and modern apt., parking in back, very comfortable and convenient.  I'll be back next year!"
7329915,39341817,2015-07-22,37274110,Pratt,"Great corner apartment with a nice homey feel just a short walk from the shops and restaurants on Broadway as well as art museum and parks.  Our host, Sarena, met us for check in and showed us around the apartment which was stocked with coffee and had wonderful soaps. 
A great experience. We felt like we were spending the weekend at a friends home. "
7329915,40976147,2015-08-03,17243438,Pascale,"Lovely apartment located in a very nice area of Seattle. Sarena is a great host, very kind and available to answer questions and suggest stuff to do around. 

The restaurants in this area are amazing, and so are the bars around. Babar for an excellent meal and Canon for a last drink are two places not to miss!



"
7329915,47745266,2015-09-21,8646925,Amy,Sare was very communicative and the apartment was great - very comfortable and clean and a great location!
3025456,16647501,2014-07-30,9455871,Alex,"This place was so awesome the first time, we stayed there a second night instead of looking for another random place on AirBNB. Heidi was super nice and even put out coffee for us the night before! Two thumbs up for anyone considering staying here! "
3025456,16759407,2014-08-01,9455871,Alex,This is one of the best places to stay in the greater Seattle area inside of a custom designed community and a park right in front of the house to boot! Heidi was an awesome host with a super clean room on the first floor and a private bathroom within the room. The bed was super comfy and I would stay there again for sure!
3025456,17873849,2014-08-18,2755664,Zel,"We loved our stay at Heidi's place. She and her partner made us feel very welcome. Their home is lovely - new, spacious and clean, with a pleasant outlook. It was great to be able to use the rather splendid kitchen. Our room was fantastic, with the most comfortable bed and very nice bathroom. It's a nice neighbourhood and was easy to access by car. It's also close to the downtown bus.  We'd certainly recommend it."
3025456,18141205,2014-08-22,19316452,Emma,"Heidi and Chad were extremely helpful, gracious host, and communication with them on arrangements were easy. Room and bathroom are exactly as described. The bed and sheets were super clean and comfortable.

It just so happened they were going to the Sounders game the evening of our stay and kindly offered to take us with them as well. 

Only stayed there a night but would definitely stay again! Park was right outside, would have loved to workout in the morning if we had time."
3025456,18283386,2014-08-24,453421,Elizabeth,"Heidi and her boyfriend Chad were the best hosts ever: so friendly, helpful, and welcoming from the time arrived late at night and throughout my stay. I highly recommend staying with them (or renting to them) just for the great company! The house is lovely and the room is pretty perfect: one the ground floor by itself, super comfortable bed, great shower in the attached bathroom, and perfectly quiet. The neighborhood is very pretty for walking around with a park right outside the front door. Can't recommend this spot highly enough!"
3025456,18345946,2014-08-25,12582599,John,"We stayed for one night in Heidi's downstairs cozy bedroom with bath in her new townhome in a neighborhood of several blocks of new townhouses. Heidi greeted us at our arrival and gave clear instructions, which included showing us the coffee maker in the bathroom and not just coffee, but tea. We did not take advantage of using the kitchen on the second level. We would gladly stay again.  "
3025456,18576908,2014-08-28,19734480,Patrizia,"Heidi was a very friendly and helpful host, she gave us a lot of good tips for Sightseeing! Her Townhouse is very lovely and comfortable! We definetly recommend staying with her! "
3025456,18613589,2014-08-28,14714972,Will,My son and I had a great experience with Heidi. The accommodations were top notch and very welcoming.  I would not only stay again but recommend to all that find themselves traveling to Seattle.  It was very easy to get to downtown.  Look forward to staying again.
3025456,19093388,2014-09-06,19842796,Brigitte,"Heidi was a gracious and fun host for our first AirBnB experience. The room was clean, nice size, quiet and very easy access from front door (no dragging bags upstairs through house). Our special treat was a private beer tasting with Chad (the boy friend brewer) and the beer was fabulous especially because of the expert explanations. The Georgetown brewers definitely make some awesome beer! Neighborhood is quiet with nice sidewalks and we enjoyed a relaxing walk to dinner with Heidi. Thank you for giving us all the helpful recommendations for Seattle. You were a joy to spend time with!"
3025456,19210108,2014-09-08,17698962,Annika,"Sehr zu empfehlen! :D
Heidi und ihr Freund waren super- sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Das Zimmer war toll-noch besser als erwartet. Neben einem Kleiderschrank gab es ein eigenes, sehr sauberes Bad. Außerdem gab es eine eigene Kaffeemaschine ;)
Die Nachbarschaft ist wirklich schön, mit netten kleinen Häuschen.
Wir haben 2 Nächte bei Heidi verbracht und würden jedes Mal wieder buchen.
"
3025456,19394112,2014-09-11,17627248,Cheryl,"Heidi was an excellent host for our first time visit to Seattle. The bedroom/bath was clean and comfortable, made even better with candles, a wide selection of DVDs, TV, coffee maker, tea and freshly ground coffee, and some pours of Chad's own brewed beer! The location is convenient and street parking was easy. Heidi was spot on with recommendations for breakfast, dinner, tours, and activities. They are nice and sweet and fun to talk with. We strongly recommend Heidi's lovely accommodation and would return in a heartbeat. "
3025456,19445877,2014-09-12,5827463,Jennifer,Great space - was a bit hard to get to but Heidi was very friendly and made us feel at home. 
3025456,19623955,2014-09-15,20067808,Naseem,My friend and I stayed at Heidi's place for 3nights. The place was very clean and close to downtown. The area was peaceful and pretty. Lots of greenery. There is a park right across from the townhouse. Our bedroom had it's own private bathroom and it was located on the main floor close to the entrance. We had an awesome time there and would defenitly recommend it to everyone! Chad was a really nice guys. He had us upstairs for some beer tasting one night ;) it was a great experience! 
3025456,19805951,2014-09-18,21301708,Cris,We had a very nice stay here. The room was as described and Heidi and Chad were gracious hosts and answered all our questions about restaurants and how to find various Seattle attractions. The location was quiet and had easy access to all the places we wanted to visit. We found the experience relaxing and pleasant.
3025456,20400190,2014-09-28,20961910,Matthieu,"Très bon accueil de Heidi dans sa charmante maison. Nous avons passé une excellente nuit, Heidi nous avait gentiment conseillé un super restaurant dans Seattle. La chambre avec la salle de bain privative est parfaite.
Je conseille vivement son logement, le quartier et en plus très joli.

Merci Heidi !"
3025456,21308017,2014-10-14,17196895,Xueqing,The room was nice and clean (especially the bathroom). The hosts were friendly and left you with abundant privacy. Great experience. 
3025456,21924105,2014-10-26,20569921,Yaqi,"Right choice! It was an good experience there! Heidi is a nice person , we arrived too late and she waited for us.we are sorry about that!"
3025456,23454718,2014-12-01,5180658,Michelle,"Heidi and Chad were very welcoming to us.  They even had some fresh ground coffee for us when they found out we drank coffee.  We found it very easy to find parking on the street.  It is a very quiet area as the townhouse faces a small park in housing development, yet they are very close to major roads in West Seattle.
Although our paths didn't cross too often as we had family in the area and spent most of our time with them, they were very willing to help with any questions.
Very nice room, bed, pillows, clean bathroom and a TV to use for DVD's.
I would have liked a small lamp as I tend to stay up later than my hubby, but it wasn't a big issue.  
We loved staying here and would do so again.  Great hosts!"
3025456,24763530,2015-01-02,22772520,Shinta,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights. Parking was never a problem to us. Love the room! It's very clean and private with attached private bathroom. The room is the only room in the main floor and close to the front door, which makes it nice and private; it's as if we have a private entrance. Lots of books and brochures thats very helpful in planning our trip there. The bed is also very comfortable. Separate heater for the room and bathroom is really nice to keep us warm. In fact, it's so comfortable there that we seems to always leave later than we had planned in the morning (cause we ended up wake up later than expected :D ). Also, the provided coffee and tea in the room is definitely very nice for the morning. Location wise this place is a bit further away from downtown though, but it's still pretty easy to get around if you are driving. 
Heidi is very nice and helpful as a host. We were visiting on the NYE so she recommended us to places and restaurants to see fireworks. Although our path didn't cross very often as she was busy but whenever I contacted her, she always respond fast and always helpful. We definitely had a really nice experience while staying there!"
3025456,24990457,2015-01-04,13285447,Nhan,The room is great! Bedroom and bathroom are very clean and well-prepared (there are even an extra heater in the room for extra comfort). Donna is very welcoming yet respect our private space. We enjoyed our night staying here.
3025456,25155406,2015-01-07,11040551,Rob,My stay with Heidi has been a wonderful experience. The room and bathroom are new and clean. Has quick access to the front door and has WiFi access in the room. I would highly recommend staying here.
3025456,26123482,2015-02-03,21537671,Abbey,"Heidi was wonderful. We booked completely last minute (and the day of the Super Bowl) and she was quick to respond and accept our request. The room was very private and the bed was amazingly comfortable. And in case you forgot anything, Heidi kept the room well stocked with a little coffee cart, toiletries, etc. I would highly recommend staying at Heidi's lovely townhome. "
3025456,26924082,2015-02-22,5110844,Carrie,I met my hostess on my first night. She waited up until my late flight arrived. The neighborhood was very nice and the house did face a small park that the neighbors seemed to use well. I enjoyed hearing the children play. It 
3025456,28589551,2015-03-26,29759436,Marty,I had a sound nights sleep at Heidi's place. The bed was super comfy with silky sheets and soft blankets. The comfort far surpasses many hotels I've stayed at. Easy to get to and a quiet family neighborhood. Quick access to restaurants. Got in late and did not get to meet Heidi. So glad she had shampoo as I forgot mine at my last hotel. Heidi also had many Seattle travel books to look through.
3025456,28766385,2015-03-29,30010334,Scott,"Heidi was an extremely gracious and communicative host.  We shared several emails before my visit, where I told her about my itinerary and she worked with me to establish a Check-In Time that would work for both our schedules.  She offered advice about the area before I arrived and guidance on local restaurants on my arrival.  Her ""house rules"" are reasonable and easy, though I did forget to take my shoes off when I first arrived to Check-In; sorry about that, Heidi!  She was gracious enough not to even mention it and I'm pleased to say I remembered to take them off on my return.

The room was spacious and impeccably clean, the bed very comfortable, and the en suite full bath provided complete privacy.  In fact, the whole layout was perfect for me - with the bedroom and bath on the first floor right inside the front door I felt that I could come and go as I needed without feeling as though I was interrupting Heidi's normal routine.  Perfect privacy for all.

Heidi's townhome is located in a new development and was easy to find with driving directions from my smart phone.  On-street parking was available just down the sidewalk from her home.  Restaurants and other services weren't in walkign distance, but were only a short drive away and Heidi provided great recommendations.

I'll be making a number of short trips back to the area and hope that Heidi's room will be available when I return.  I highly recommend it to other travelers to West Seattle looking for pleasant, easy, and convenient accommodations for 1-2 people."
3025456,28992895,2015-04-02,25504193,David,"I only got to meet Heidi briefly. However, she was very accommodating to fit my schedule and be able to access the room at my convenience. The area is very nice and peaceful. The room is impeccable, very clean, nice beds and comfortable sheets. Heidi has made the room to feel very welcoming and calming. I would not hesitate to stay at her place again in the future.  "
3025456,29149409,2015-04-04,10899548,Jennifer,"Heidi was great! The bed was very comfortable. Clean, quiet, and nice neighborhood. Would love to visit again!"
3025456,29712209,2015-04-11,30010334,Scott,"My third stay at Heidi's place and, as always, a welcoming and easy place to stay.  Neat, convenient, private, and Heidi goes out of her way to make things easy.  She even has coffee in the room for you!"
3025456,30563709,2015-04-24,30044561,Dale,"Heidi was a great hostess who was flexible on dates and times for starting our stay. The room is clean, quiet and comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet, easy to find and had plenty of nearby free parking."
3025456,31736125,2015-05-09,31180997,Henry,"Heidi was a great host.  She was very welcoming and made sure my stay was pleasant.  I didn't see her much as my room and bathroom are on the 1st floor, near the front entrance.  It was very private, very clean and comfortable.  This was the best airbnb experience I have had.  I would not hesitate to recommend Heidi's place.  Parking was easy to find.  "
3025456,32292295,2015-05-16,30039568,Juan,"Heidi has a beautiful home, with a spectacular view from the room to rent. It is a very clean and safe environment, the description was exactly right. Heidi also provides a room with complete privacy, it is on the main floor as you come in the door. So you have your room with your own bathroom and no need to invade her space. "
3025456,32646450,2015-05-19,1661219,Alan,"Heidi was a wonderful host who also went out of her way to assist me with directions to her place (when google failed me) and also to where I was going in North Seattle.  In fact I might well not have made it to the performance in time with my daughter without her patient directions which made it very easy to go to downtown and back.  The room with ensuite full bathroom was lovely and quiet, and the bed and bedding so comfortable.  I slept very well and the little park outside was perfect for practicing Qigong in the morning.  I would definitely stay again on overnight trips to Seattle.  Thank you Heidi!"
3025456,32993799,2015-05-24,30624640,Prescilla,"Heidi a été très accueillante et nous a tout de suite mis à l'aise. Elle nous a conseillé un très bon restaurant pour notre dernier soir à Seattle. La chambre était très propre et toutes les commodités étaient disponibles dans la salle de bain. La chambre est au rez de chaussée et les hôtes vivent à l'étage. Ils sont très silencieux, nous ne les avons pas entendus !"
3025456,33273955,2015-05-26,19567630,Patricia,"Heidi was a great host, happy to give us tips on where to go and what to do in Seattle. The room is super clean and exactly as depicted. Located at the very front of the house so guests can come in and out independently. It is a new house in a very pleasant neighborhood. "
3025456,33408322,2015-05-27,6619882,Cameron,"Heidi's place was just what we needed for a stopover before catching an early flight. It was clean, cozy, and very private. Heidi was super helpful and had all the amenities a guest could need. Highly recommend her place!"
3025456,33762724,2015-06-01,5277712,Ron,"We had a great stay for 5 nights at Heidi's Place.  The private room and bath were very clean and comfortable! The bathroom was well stocked with everything you would need and more!!!  It was a short walk to the bus stop into Seattle - very handy.  We loved the neighbourhood too - very quiet (a nice escape from the busy downtown area) and you could tell people took pride in their properties.  Just down the street is a great viewpoint over the city.  
Heidi was very friendly and welcoming! Unfortunately though we were so busy out exploring the city and area, we didn't have a chance to talk much.  However we were provided with her contact information and we knew she was available if needed.  We would definitely want to stay there again if we went back to Seattle.  Thanks Heidi!!"
3025456,34557020,2015-06-09,33370031,Andrew,"I had a lovely time staying in Heidi's home.  It was clean, organized, and private.  My schedule in town didn't leave an opportunity to socialize with Heidi but I wouldn't hesitate to use her accommodations again if I'm in town again."
3025456,34837704,2015-06-12,24557409,Dimitri,"My wife and I had just completed a very long 2 days of hiking and,at the last minute needed a place to stay. Hiedi's room was perfect!, awesome bed, clean bathroom and private. We appreciated her effort at the minute like that. easy 5 stars! Thanx again."
3025456,35524423,2015-06-19,11548426,Michael,Heidi was great at communicating with me about the reservation.  The room is new construction in an attractive area of other new homes.  The bed was comfortable and all-in-all a great value in Seattle.  I only stayed for one night but would definitely recommend.
3025456,36669361,2015-06-30,7985286,Jennifer,"Neat clean room, everything the ad says. Good location, great park across the way. Heidi was busy as it was over the weekend, so barely saw her, but being a tourist was easy to navigate nevertheless. "
3025456,36767076,2015-07-01,29217932,Vicky,"Very welcoming and gave us a great tip of where go go for dinner, which was just right. "
3025456,37072046,2015-07-04,7466339,Linda,"This listing is an extremely clean, uncluttered room with a modern bathroom en suite. The maps and guide books were relevant, there were reading lamps not knick-knacks on every surface.  The linens are excellent and the mattress is comfortable. The room is the only one on the first floor of a new townhouse, has an ample closet (no furnace in it, no yapping dogs or unlit back door entry!) The neighborhood is quiet at night and seemed safe.

While it is best to have a vehicle since the area is hilly, ample public transportation exists within about half a mile. Of the airbnb situations I've encountered, this was far and away the nicest all around. Heidi is kind, thoughtful, and although our schedules didn't allow for visiting, is intelligent, warm, welcoming and very accommodating. "
3025456,37221414,2015-07-05,36210145,Angelica,"The house was in a beautiful neighborhood (very calm with a beautiful park right in front) and the host was very welcoming, friendly and helpful (ie. with suggestions as to where to eat, things we needed, etc) and gave us our space to relax/unwind from a long day. The room was very clean, comfortable and had everything we needed and perfect location (right at the entrance of house and away from other rooms) . I would definitely recommend booking a stay here. "
3025456,37859132,2015-07-11,29187092,Art,"While me and my girlfriend never unfortunately met Heidi in person, she was very communicative and ensured that all our needs were met. 

The room featured such a comfy bed that you'll be out before your head hits the pillow and the room will have everything you might have forgotten to pack. 

This is a lovely place to stay and would love to come back on any other trips we may take to Seattle in the future!"
3025456,38910256,2015-07-19,1925907,JoAnne,"The room was even nicer than described. It was fresh, quiet, private, and located on a lovely little park right outside the front door.  The bed and linens were very comfortable, and everything we needed was provided.  Due to our late arrival, we did not have a chance to meet; however Heidi was very responsive and welcoming via phone, email and text.  We would highly recommend this room with ensuite bathroom to others!"
3025456,39107626,2015-07-20,2318900,Molly,"Staying at Heidi's overnight was excellent. While we didn't meet in person, she was very communicative, accommodating of our late arrival time, and gave easy directions for everything. The room and bathroom were as expected and described in previous reviews: very clean, a comfortable bed, plenty of towels in the bathroom, etc. The neighborhood was quiet and seemed very safe. We were only there briefly and so did not explore much, so can't report on shops/restaurants nearby. That said, we would definitely recommend staying here!"
3025456,39176623,2015-07-21,31462076,Kay,My husband and I enjoyed staying in Heidi's home for almost a week while we were in Seattle. It's located in a very nice neighborhood. The bedroom and bath are private and everything was clean and comfortable. Heidi was always prompt communicating with us and was helpful in giving suggestions for a restaurant and bakery which we tried and enjoyed. I would definitely recommend Heidi's accommodations and would stay there again when in Seattle. 
3025456,39661178,2015-07-25,34140839,Fitz,"I loved it, she was friendly and what little i saw of her was helpful on places to go and things to do. Not to far from a lot of things and the bed was very comfortable. Would definitely stay again whenever i comeback. "
3025456,40130379,2015-07-28,2269517,Rob&Elle,"Accurate description of a modern townhouse private room with a private bath in the residential area on the west side of Seattle across the bridge from downtown.  Everything was very clean.  When we arrived, Heidi was available to give us information on interesting local places for breakfast and tell us about parking in Seattle's downtown."
3025456,40523566,2015-07-31,4373511,Maureen,Heidi's room was exactly as advertised. We stayed for a few nights and she made sure to check in with us to make sure everything was OK. 
3025456,40977300,2015-08-03,36075840,Gloria,"Very nice and cozy room. Has almost everything you need. This's my first experience on airbnb.com and it was amazing. Thank you Heidi!
 "
3025456,41398263,2015-08-07,10680873,Maria,"Heidi's home was a great stay in a very quiet neighborhood. Although my husband and I were out of the house for most of our stay, it was nice to have full communication with her. We arrived after a long road trip when she wasn't at home, but Heidi was able to accommodate our arrival with no issues. Bed was comfy, shower was hot. Highly recommend!"
3025456,42146732,2015-08-11,36629881,Steve,"We had a great experience. Room m bath impeccable. Great tiny park w and exercise equipment. nice neighborhood to walk and coffee shop about a mile away. Heidi was gracious and flexible. 4 stars!
"
3025456,42597541,2015-08-14,3381318,Jessie,"I stayed at Heidi's for 3 days and her home is beautiful, immaculate and convenient to good restaurants and coffee shops.  My room was just inside the front door for maximum privacy.  The room itself was spotless as was the en suite bathroom.  There were Seattle magazines and many books and guides  to the Seattle area and environs  The neighborhood is good and on a lovely green space with workout equipment in it.
I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again!
"
3025456,43586553,2015-08-20,40640319,Meghan,"Heidi was a great host! I was able to stay in touch with her prior to our arrival and sort out an arrival time that worked for both of us. The space was lovely, and just what we needed. It felt very private as it was the only room on the floor, and we didn't feel as though we were disturbing anyone with our comings and goings. Would absolutely stay here again. "
3025456,44823589,2015-08-29,30810417,Kim,"I enjoyed my stay at Heidi’s place.  The space felt very private on a separate floor of her home. The room and connected bathroom were very clean and nicely furnished, and the bed was incredibly comfortable.   The townhome is in a nicely planned community overlooking a park and is within walking distance of a bus line to downtown Seattle.  A variety of shops and restaurants are a short drive away.  I would definitely stay here again."
3025456,45024105,2015-08-30,20318379,Megan,"Heidi made me feel very welcome here, with messages back and forth answering my questions. I came in late after a concert and this was the perfect clean, quiet place to rest for the night! Not a far drive at all from Pike Place; was expecting a longer drive. The place is located in a nice, new area. All in all an enjoyable experience :)"
3025456,45344462,2015-09-01,1739849,Charlotte,"We had an excellent time at Heidi's! Our room was beautiful, the bathroon very spacious and everything was superneat. Heidi was a great host- she even made our laundry. Thank you so much!"
3025456,45675457,2015-09-05,16613,Kathy,Heidi's place is great and I would highly recommend it to visitors to Seattle. The room is very clean and quiet and private. You have your own entrance and separate lower floor of the house. The bed is comfortable and the room is a great value with a nice neighborhood.
3025456,45968442,2015-09-07,9931975,Rachel,"My husband and I had a great experience at Heidi's one bedroom w/a private bath in West Seattle.  It was very private and the location was great, easy to catch I-5 downtown or heading back to Portland, and close to restaurants & nightlife in West Seattle.  The room and bathroom were immaculate and Heidi supplied several books and maps of Seattle for her guests.  She also supplied most travel amenities needed for ones trip which was a plus.  We definitely recommend Heidi's place and will check to see if it's available again the next time we stay in West Seattle.  "
3025456,46793202,2015-09-13,7556584,Linda,"Heidi was very nice and helpful, and her place is in a pleasant and safe location. "
3025456,47734613,2015-09-21,41751962,Joshua,"What a great base camp to explore Seattle from. The clean home, room and private bathroom were always great to come back to after long day trips. During our visit, the immediate neighborhood/backyard/park was so quiet and peaceful. Comfy bed, guidebooks, maps, umbrella (maybe a rain poncho or two), and plenty of clean towels for two people. Spent just over a week there and would come back for sure."
3025456,48212913,2015-09-24,963122,Peng,"Didn't get a chance to meet Heidi at all since we came in late and were out of the house 14 hours a day, but the place offered most essentials, and was pretty clean. They were really considerate in making very little noise during our time in the house and the neighborhood is also clean and quiet. I would have enjoyed staying closer to downtown, since the commute was much longer than I had anticipated, with construction going on everywhere! Overall a positive experience for our short time in Seattle! "
3025456,48768120,2015-09-28,24570298,Tiffany,"Heidi was accommodating and she was nice enough to greet me upon my arrival  even though I had a late flight. Her place was nice and I could not have asked for a better location. I would definitely stay there again as her place was nice , clean, comfortable  and quiet. She knows the city well and she gave me good advice on how to get around in the city! I used a rental car to get around  the city for the most part ,  which proved to be more convenient as west Seattle where Heidi lived seem to be residential."
3025456,49107439,2015-10-01,37161058,Peter,"Heidi's home is in a delightful green district with easy access by public transport to downtown Seattle (try the water taxi!!) and a short drive to a wide range of shops and places to eat. The accommodation is modern, light and well presented. Heidi made sure we had the access arrangements sorted out as she was out when we arrived. She was an unobtrusive host but was around to answer our questions when they arose. For a restful break close to the city but with green spaces all around this is hard to beat."
3025456,49919496,2015-10-07,10397505,Kristine,"I loved staying here! Heidi's beautiful, modern and well-lit townhouse is located in West Seattle, just a few minutes drive away from Downtown and all the ideal places to see. The drive includes a bridge where you see beautiful views of the city and water. The neighborhood is also very welcoming with local stores and delicious restaurants nearby. Heidi is very friendly and helpful about the area. the place is spotless and has everything you could need! It is also a very peaceful and quiet environment, just perfect for a vacation away. My boyfriend and I also traveled to Vancouver, B.C. and to the Seahawks game. Try the water taxi to Downtown, it's fun and real convenient. You will feel right at home here and I plan on coming back again if Heidi allows me to! Stay here if you want the most value, privacy and most relaxing time in the Northwest!"
3025456,50529141,2015-10-12,30729603,Yang,Very clean and cozy room!Make me feel like at home.
3025456,51098110,2015-10-17,15494272,Melissa,"Heidi's private room was perfect for my short stay in Seattle. The room  was clean, quiet, and with recommendations printed out for her guests! I loved the location which was in a safe and very green neighborhood. Heidi was very helpful and prompt with any question I had.I Thank you so much Heidi! "
3025456,51476527,2015-10-20,12436410,Lily,"The room was clean, the bed was very comfortable and had a nice atmosphere. Having a private bathroom was great. We really enjoyed the stay. "
3025456,55133087,2015-11-28,4885006,Eilish,"Heidi and our overall experience of staying at her place was warm, welcoming and very much accurate based on the description provided.  This private room and bathroom are beautifully appointed. We appreciated the high quality of the bedding as it was a cold November and the independent thermostat made it easy to adjust to a comfort level that worked for us.
Heidi is a warm and personable host and, as I've experienced with other airbnb hosts, has balanced privacy and boundaries for oneself and guest in a natural manner.
I'll plan to schedule with her on my return trip for sure! 
"
7596934,42747080,2015-08-15,39846548,David,"The Phinney Bungalow is one of the best places I have ever stayed at. 

When I arrived, my hosts greeted me with a warm welcome and fridge full of fresh fruit & snacks. They let me know where are the awesome places to get food and coffee, which there are many amazing  places all within walking distance. 

The 'mini home' was a perfect little hideaway from the big city. I am very grateful to have stayed there  since I needed a home away from home while I was in Seattle for work for 2 weeks. The interior was beautifully decorated & was inspiring to stay in. The street where's it's located is very quiet, peaceful and family oriented. 

If you're looking for a place just outside of downtown, in the real Seattle, imho this is the place to be. I can't thank my hosts enough for their kindness and they even gave me an umbrella on the last day because it started raining. Really nice people I hope anyone else that stays there has as great a time that I had. "
7596934,43308487,2015-08-18,40124957,Bethany And Justin,Bretton was very nice and open to as much interaction as you need/want. The Bungalow was exactly as pictured and well stocked with toiletries and everything we needed for our 2 night stay.  The fireplace is a nice touch for the chilly Seattle nights.  The neighborhood was nice and quiet with plenty of parking and good location; only 5 miles from downtown Seattle and there were plenty of restaurants and cool places to go by the Phinney neighborhood itself.  I would recommend staying here as we will be on our next Seattle trip.
7596934,45212105,2015-08-31,42613529,Bonnie,"Bretton was a gracious host with excellent communication. Everything we needed was provided (including my special request). This little bungalow was the perfect, cozy getaway. The neighborhood is quiet with delightful houses. There's free parking, and restaurants and pubs within walking distance. It was very easy to get to where we wanted from here. I wish we could have stayed longer! It was very relaxing. I especially enjoyed the way the art seemed to change color under the skylight. "
7596934,46016604,2015-09-07,41746499,Mark,"The Bungalow was great for myself and daughter.  Very quiet neighborhood, made friends with the neighbor's cat.  Enjoyed our stay.  The kitchen only has a microwave for cooking (the only negative).  Bretton was very responsive to our every request, even when I misplaced the key.  Would recommend this rental for anyone visiting Seattle."
6490091,33733388,2015-05-31,17370366,Tanis,"Staying at Andrews place was fantastic! It's true, they had just moved in and a few things were getting arranged during my stay, but they always took care that everything was fine for me. The location is really great, just between the space needle and Pike Place (5 min to either of them), and the apartment is big, fresh, and with an amazing terrace with priceless views. Also, very reasonably priced, when compared to other airBnB listings and hotel prices in Seattle. Moreover, Andrew and Shawna are very cool and nice to talk to, and attentive in case of any need. The only thing that bugged me a little bit was that the internet connection in the room was quite slow, sometimes not working, but I am sure that they will fix this soon. I totally recommend this place to stay during a visit to Seattle."
5559063,31183563,2015-05-03,28864648,Jarett,Apryl was a wonderful host and the location was as awesome as described. Thanks!
5559063,34874460,2015-06-13,14169169,Cyndi,Apryl's townhouse was easy to find and very spacious. I really appreciated Apryl taking the time to meet us in person when we first arrived.
8847108,51418190,2015-10-19,5132782,Ramiro,"Toby was wonderful! In the time I have used AirBnB I have never had a more thoughtful or timely host. We had an unfortunate cancellation on a previous host the night before my trip and Toby was VERY responsive and got us taken care of quickly and clearly with instructions. If you have the opportunity, I would strongly suggest staying at Toby's!  "
8847108,52161013,2015-10-26,16807451,Kurt,We had a great time in this cozy cute little cottage. Toby was great and even had some food and drinks for us in the fridge when we arrived. She also has a turntable and some great albums to listen to. Overall a great stay in a great location.
8847108,52773112,2015-11-01,8052919,James,Toby was very communicative.  The house is located in Madrona - a nice family neighborhood - quite close to several great restaurants and wine bars.
8847108,52951823,2015-11-02,43394295,Dale,Toby was wonderful! She made herself available and confirmed my reservation on short notice. The cottage itself was warm and cozy. The bed was great and it was nice to have a record player (with a plethora of records) and good wifi.
8847108,53767116,2015-11-12,26491184,Ashley,"Toby's place was everything I could have hoped for. The neighborhood, Madrona is just east of downtown Seattle. There are bakeries and wine shops and restaurants all over. It is quiet and quaint with amazing views and superstar hills. This was my first visit to Seattle and everything was perfect. From being 5-15 minutes away from everything we needed and wanted to the super cozy accommodations, Toby's cottage was in a word- sublime!"
8847108,54263595,2015-11-17,44892418,Abdul,"This host and the property were just great!  Upon arrival, the cottage was lit, great music was playing, and the place was just incredibly welcoming.  Everything was clean and comfortable.   I stayed here with my wife and this location and cottage couldn't be better.  It was near great cafes (a cool coffee shop is literally across the street) and restaurants, and it was just a short car ride to downtown Seattle (about 10-15min).  

We would definitely book with Toby again and would highly recommend her and her cottage.

What a delightful weekend getaway! Toby provided us with great local recommendations, and went above and beyond with wine and chocolate and coffee and eggs, and the coziest bed to hunker down in! And what a wonderful record collection, and reading material, and even a Le Creuset to cook out breakfast in! We didn't want to leave, and thoroughly enjoyed every minute in the delightfully cozy and homey space. We'll happily move in! Thank you so much, Toby, for sharing such a wonderful space, and for making it such a delightful experience! We can't wait to return! "
8847108,55236558,2015-11-29,45611652,Sean,The Cozy Cottage was a great place to stay and super convenient to local restaurants and shops.  I would recommend it to anyone traveling to the Seattle area.
8847108,55952308,2015-12-07,49273064,William,"The Cozy Cottage lived up to its name. It was very comfortable, clean, and Toby did a great job making it feel welcoming. Plus it's in a convenient location in a nice neighborhood. Definitely a great place to stay."
8847108,56510975,2015-12-14,39815358,Brooke,We had a blast! The location was ideal and the house was clean cozy and comfy.
8847108,57029500,2015-12-21,34695397,Brooks,"Toby's cottage was absolutely amazing--we loved our stay so much! It's a magical, clean and cozy home, and Toby really helped make our experience in Seattle wonderful. Incredible host--responsive to our questions and gave great advice about local places to see and activities to do, with fantastic restaurants just around the block. Thanks, Toby!!"
2516391,13431959,2014-05-27,14989529,Jimmy,"The cabin is amazing!  Great view of the Lake and the old gasworks across the water.  There are a number of nice restaurants near by, and just a block away from a bus stop that takes you directly downtown.  Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay."
2516391,17821350,2014-08-18,13547894,Jackson,"My girlfriend and I stayed in Anthony's city cabin for three months, and we couldn't have had a better experience. The neighborhood is great, the house itself is comfortable and well put together, and the view from the porch/kitchen/loft is incredible. Especially enjoyed being able to barbecue on the patio. Tony himself is great too--always available, eager to help however he could, and happy to leave us to ourselves when we wanted him to. I'd definitely recommend staying with him!"
2516391,18265123,2014-08-24,1415241,Yvonne,"Having the relaxing view of Lake Union definitely added extra value to our experience in the City Cabin. We woke up every morning in awe. It's a great way to start your day!

The cabin itself is peacefully quiet, well kept/clean + decorated, very safe, and convenient. (5 stars, really).

Anthony was communicative and quick to reply when we had any questions. This was our first trip to Seattle and my sister and I both agree-- WE LOVE SEATTLE!"
2516391,18884251,2014-09-02,17883821,Lauren,"My stay at the cabin was great- the house itself was very cozy and well furnished, and Anthony was very helpful and quick to assist whenever I needed it! (The stove burner wasn't working correctly and he came the next day to fix it.) I loved the view from the cabin and I wish I could have stayed for longer. "
2516391,20601180,2014-10-02,13758649,聖芬,第一次使用Airbnb，也是第一次到西雅圖，這次主要陪兒子去辦理入學，這次選擇住宿在湖邊的小屋，非常開心，住宿環境非常好，也很安全，房子就可以看到湖景，很舒服，房子非常乾淨，有自己的廚房、洗衣設備、吹風機、沐浴配備，Tony也很貼心，準備了咖啡，還留了許多訊息，告訴我們住宿附近的一些資訊，例如停車、餐廳、郵局、洗衣等等，也留了很多公車資訊、旅遊資訊等，這裡離公車站走路只要三分鐘，可以到市中心也可以到華盛頓大學區，真的很方便，餐廳也很多，很好吃，我待了快一個月，要離開時覺得捨不得，下次去西雅圖還會選擇住這裡～
2516391,23427528,2014-12-01,16389752,Adam,"My partner and I enjoyed  a 6-week stay at the Lake Union City Cabin. Having just moved to Seattle, this was the perfect place to get acquainted with the city. The view from the house and deck are amazing on a clear day. You can even grill while enjoying a beer and views of the lake and Olympic Mountains.

The cabin has all of the amenities you will need for a short or long term stay. This is a quiet neighborhood but there are plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance. Tony is a great host and helped fix the wireless internet at the beginning of stay. You can't go wrong renting this place! "
2516391,24880225,2015-01-03,113613,Drew,"This place is the perfect oasis!  Located in the very desirable East Lake neighbor, the cottage is tucked away on a very quiet street with great views on South Lake Union.  Its extremely spacious including the downstairs and loft upstairs bedrooms.  The well equipped kitchen is perfect for morning breakfast or heck any vacation cooking needs. The home feels cozy and lots of character and beats any hotel accommodations. "
2516391,25962055,2015-01-31,821666,Jeff,"My girlfriend and I stayed for a month at Tony’s city cabin, and it was fantastic. Clean, spacious, bright, well stocked. The pictures are a very accurate representation of the cabin; it’s extremely well lit, full of windows, and would comfortably accommodate two couples. It’s also very well maintained and comfortable. The chairs, couches and beds were all nice. The views are gorgeous, and all the outdoor space was great on dry days.

Eastlake is a good central location, and it’s pretty easy to get around. It’s not a destination area like Ballard or Fremont, so there won’t be as much to walk to as one of those areas, but there’s still a few good bars and restaurants within a 5-10 minute walk. The street is very quiet but it's part of a jogging/biking loop, so there are often people quietly going by during the day. It’s very charming, and lends to the overall community feel.

We honestly had zero major complaints. Our only issue was the internet, which was a bit finicky. It works best toward the back of the cabin, in the kitchen or lower bedroom.

Overall there’s no reason not to recommend the cabin. We had a great time and would absolutely stay again."
2516391,28949411,2015-04-01,2256631,Stephanie,"Anthony has a lovely cabin close to the water in East Lake Union.  I stayed here for six weeks while in town for business.  It was a beautiful improvement on a hotel and made the travel much easier!  I loved waking up and looking out over the lake as the sun came up.  Highly recommended!

In addition to having a great location, the house has entirely new amenities.  The kitchen, bathroom, and master bed are all fantastic.   I particularly enjoyed the coffee beans and coffee pot with auto-timer.  The barbeque grill in the back is top notch too."
2516391,30068458,2015-04-17,9626185,Brianna,"We had a fantastic week-long stay at the Lake Union City Cabin. The location is extremely convenient to both I-5 and downtown and having a parking spot is a huge bonus. It feels very special to wake up and watch the sunrise reflecting off the Olympic mountains and the lake. My husband and I generally prefer to stay in small houses (as opposed to apartments/condos) and sometimes struggle to find good options in this category; however, this cabin is a winner in our book and perfectly met our needs. We also really appreciated the hospitality extended by Tony. Top marks all around!"
2516391,31002609,2015-04-30,4847110,Cassie,We loved Anthony's home so much that we extended our stay a few days.  It was an incredible treat to wake up to such an amazing view and then also be able to witness killer sunsets.  Really convenient location with great restaurants nearby.  Anthony was super easy to communicate with. Look forward to staying there again! 
2516391,45550013,2015-09-04,4302668,Emily,"This is a fantastic place to stay in Seattle.  It's very close to everything but in a quiet beautiful neighborhood with some great coffee shops/cafes nearby.  The house is small, but perfectly supplied with everything you will need and a very nice and relaxing space overall."
2516391,47781811,2015-09-21,15737780,Natalie,"The house was perfect for our weekend getaway!  The view from the master bedroom is absolutely amazing; you can see Gasworks Park, as well as the lake and the occasional seaplane landing.  The neighborhood was quiet, yet conveniently close to either the U-district or downtown.  We would absolutely stay here again."
2516391,49809057,2015-10-06,13420197,Kun,"Great location, easy drive to downtown and walkable distance to UW campus. Nice neigborhood.
The room is clean and cozy. The internet speed is great.
The host response to our questions and requests very efficiently.
I highly recommend this place.

6305798,33156491,2015-05-25,32372112,Madi,"This was an AWESOME spot in a perfect location. I am from Seattle and know my way around, and I'm not afraid to walk. Great 2 bedroom space. Nice living room, dining area, and great kitchen! It had all kinds of extras and it is such a luxury to have. On site laundry was another sweet luxury. We would definitely stay again! I HIGHLY recommend. =)"
7441508,40038935,2015-07-27,12653798,Meng,"Neil was a fabulous host for my trip to Seattle with my boyfriend. He made us a very thoughtful and helpful welcome basket with suggestions of places and how to get around. He even bought us bus passes! Neil was very friendly and helped answer any questions we had. His house was very clean and the room was comfortable to stay in. His house is in North Seattle, conveniently located near bus stops, and is in a quiet neighborhood. We had a great time and would highly recommend staying here!"
7441508,40401875,2015-07-30,39304910,Alicia,Neil is a very considerate host and his place is a great location for anyone exploring Seattle. This is an especially ideal location if you're interested in the quirky Fremont neighborhood (10 min car ride away.) 
7441508,40700733,2015-08-01,13775192,Samantha,Neil's home was very nice and in a great location. He was kind enough to let me check in late in the evening. Everything was great.
7441508,41141331,2015-08-04,4426949,Trey & Paul,"Neil was an excellent host, and his home is very comfortable, clean, quiet, and peaceful. The bed was very nice and the bedroom is right next to the bathroom.   A nice surprise were the two bountiful apple trees in the backyard. 

Neil's hospitality blew us away!  He offered a generous assortment of coffees, teas, and snacks, slippers, an umbrella, a booklet with wifi directions and tourist recommendations.  He even went completely over-and-above, helping us to solve a problem for our son who lives in Seattle. I cannot say enough good things about Neil.  We will always ask to stay here when traveling to Seattle!"
7441508,41544333,2015-08-07,39510370,Jose,Staying at Neil's home was such a pleasant experience. He's very warm and his home was impeccable. Easily the BEST bnb in all of Washington! 
7441508,41565517,2015-08-07,32096758,实,I stay 5 more nights with my husband in Neil's guest room. That means he is a 5 star host. I will write him a comment after my stay. Thanks Neil and Arlene! can't say enough good words about you.
7441508,42198321,2015-08-11,37569527,Linly,"It was my first time using AirBnb and Neil made my stay a very comfortable one. Even though I was out and about for most of my stay, I came back to a comfy bed and clean room. Overall it was a great stay. And thank you Neil for having me! "
7441508,43194938,2015-08-17,12714431,Abhik,"Neil and Arlene are awesome hosts. They were extremely hospitable and friendly, and made our stay so pleasant that we wished we'd stayed longer than a night. The room itself is very clean and cozy, and Neil and Arlene provide you with an umbrella, Orca pass, and chocolate! The house is very well decorated and super peaceful. We look forward to staying with them again. We enjoyed chatting with Neil and Arlene the brief time we were there, and look forward to knowing them more."
7441508,44966804,2015-08-30,39844817,Aaron,"The room is very nice, clean, and has a very comfortable bed. Neil does a great job of being a host, as he is easy to reach through the Airbnb chat, is very friendly, and easy to talk to. The amenities provided to guests are well stocked, covered our needs, and there was even some fresh fruit and bottled water provided. There was also a really great welcome basket that provided information about getting around Seattle, restaurants, an Orca card for the bus, and an umbrella. The home itself is spacious and clean, and has a quiet and relaxing atmosphere. It is located in a nice neighborhood, and is within walking distance of bus stops, a transit center, and the Northgate Mall. I would highly recommend this room."
7441508,45310279,2015-09-01,41424284,Jingtao,Highly recommend!

And Neil prepared everything you may need. The bus pass, umbrella, tourist guide and even the shopping bag! All in all, I highly recommend this listing. "
7441508,46238576,2015-09-08,42324924,Jeff,"I cannot express how great Neil and Arline are as hosts. Both of them are very easy going and laid-back, very down to Earth couple. They also were very responsive and quick with any questions I had. The house is very lovely, the room is as advertised, super clean, and in a very convenient location. The collection of tea Neil has is pretty awesome too, I must add!

Their place is simply one of the best Airbnbs in Seattle. I'll definitely be back again!"
7441508,46776701,2015-09-13,101445,Sharon/Richard,"Neil was so nice and welcoming, a really good host. The room is simple and comfortable, just what we needed for a night. The shared kitchen was beautiful but we didn't stay long enough to use it. The shared bathroom was clean and simple and met our needs. The house is near the freeway which is great for accessibility but a bit noisy. Glad I brought my ear plugs. The ease of this location in our family's neighborhood made it a good choice for us. And again, Neil is really nice."
7441508,47440724,2015-09-18,44209309,Hoori,"The description and pictures are completely accurate. Neil showed us around home and made us feel we were at home. The neighborhood is very beautiful, calm and clean. I loved it."
7441508,47594892,2015-09-20,44209309,Hoori,"Neil welcomed us with a warm smile and showed us around, he tried his best to make us feel home. My brother and I stayed at his place for two days and then we extended our stay for one more day quite easily. The room was clean, the bathroom was clean as well and kitchen was awesome. He provided us with umbrella, chocolate and bus card. The neighborhood was also very pretty and calm. All in all an awesome first time airbnb experience."

All facilities are good and the environment is so nice. It's very convenient to stay there. And choose to stay there is definitely the best choice!
7404370,40027323,2015-07-27,37948800,Michael,"This was my girlfriend and I's first time using and airbnb and we couldn't have been happier with our experience. The house was clean, comfortable, private and had everything we needed to make our stay very memorable. The location was great, check in and check out was very convenient. We would definitely stay here again"

7067082,38642773,2015-07-17,6826120,Eleanor,"Fantastic location in the main, hip area of Ballard....walk direclty from the apartment to hip boutiques and coffee shops. Heidi was very helpful with accommodating my schedule and providing me great stops to eat and drink in the area. Very sweet dogs. The perfect crash pad and a gracious host! "
7067082,38905442,2015-07-19,30661617,Beverly,What a perfect location for enjoying Seattle and especially the Ballard area. Walk out the door and you can experience great eating and fun shopping.  Heida was extremely  accommodating and very gracious. 
7067082,39546789,2015-07-24,38079611,Cindy,Heidi went out of her way to make us feel welcome and the location was great!

7067082,41795715,2015-08-09,37418981,Julie,"This was our first AirBNB experience and it was fantastic!  Clean house, Heidi was friendly and made us feel right at home and at the same time gave us our own space.  Her dogs are sweet and adorable.  "
7067082,42752766,2015-08-15,37303783,David,"Heidi was great, met me at the door and introduced me to her two super cute dogs. She was very friendly and was always around for a chat and suggest things to do/see.
The place itself was excellent, right on a street with plenty of nightlife, very cool decor and was exactly the type of place I wanted to stay at while in Seattle."
7067082,44344175,2015-08-25,37898876,Phillip,"I felt completely comfortable with Heidi from our first conversation on the phone. Her home was open and very friendly from the moment I arrived. 
Only had overnight but felt like I left with a new friend in Seattle. 
As far location. You're in the heart of Ballard with more cool people and  places than you'll ever see in one trip."
7067082,48768224,2015-09-28,43541841,Bill,"Heidi was very welcoming and made our stay quite easy. Her place is in the middle of Ballard, which is what we were looking for while visiting our son. We could walk everywhere we wanted to go. The loft provides an adequate amount of privacy and plenty of room. There is some noise from the alley when the garbage trucks come through early in the morning. "
8152191,46249973,2015-09-08,43312129,Olivia,"lovely room, nice person, quiet place to live. "
8152191,46662653,2015-09-12,16646281,Chelsea,"Annette's place is ideally located to experience quiet suburbia, people-watch along beautiful Green Lake, and enjoy great restaurants - all within walking distance.  The home is 100+ years old giving it both a charming uniqueness and noisy floorboards. 
The room is as listed - with a comfortable bed. Because the 3 bedrooms are all close to each other we did feel the need to whisper at late hours.  Annette, Paul, & Mario are all kind people who will give you space and privacy and also befriend you.  Stay here if you want to enjoy Green Lake!"
8152191,47908864,2015-09-21,5222606,Denise,"This was a very sweet house in a sweet neighborhood.  Anette was accommodating to our early arrival allowing us to leave our things in the room.  The dining table looks out on a porch populated by a variety of birds (and squirrels) drawn to the various feeders and we very much enjoyed watching them while drinking morning coffee.  Taking the bus downtown was easy and we loved the local neighborhood.  
The bedroom is upstairs and there are stairs then a high step up into the bathroom.  This could be an issue for some people with physical pain."
8152191,48810953,2015-09-28,1818874,Jim,"A nice simple clean cozy room in a house with good people, located in a quiet, pretty area of Seattle with plenty of nearby options for dining and morning or evening drinks, just a few steps from Green Lake and on public transit routes.   A little tricky to locate by address, but a fine place to stay!"
8152191,49145945,2015-10-01,43626686,Susan,"Charming house and the host was most considerate. I had problems with the bathroom, as the lip for the tub was too high and there are no grab bars, so I couldn't take a shower. Very close to great transportation and I can definitely recommend the local area for ambiance. "
8152191,50000352,2015-10-08,42650491,Haluko,"The location of Annette's place is fantastically wonderful. It's within only 5 minutes walking distance to beautiful Green Lake. Besides, Annette offers you much personal privacy with only minimum questions regarding to your need. "
8152191,51804392,2015-10-24,26692142,David,"I stayed here for a week when first moving to Seattle. Anette was very welcoming, allowing me to check-in early and showing me around the house. The room itself has a desk, chair, closet, large bed and plenty of pillows. The house is in a great location. It is 2 blocks from beautiful Green Lake and many restaurants and coffee shops. If you want to go downtown, there is a bus 5 minutes away. Overall, a great stay. "
8152191,53757030,2015-11-12,15955234,Felicia,"Staying with Anette, Paul and Mario for two weeks was great! They are very gracious hosts, kind and accommodating. The late 19th Century home filled with a mix of textiles and antiques is warm and inviting. The room contains a bed, dresser, desk and closet. The hosts provided an electric tea pot with various teas. Nice and welcoming on a rainy evening arrival! Green Lake is a beautiful and safe community within Seattle. The house is a short walk from coffee shops, eateries and PCC, an organic grocery store. I was a little hesitant about doing the shared bathroom, but it was very clean and not a problem. I actually enjoyed the antique clawfoot tub/shower. Definitely, I will contact Anette before booking a hotel room for an extended stay while visiting my Seattle relatives. Thank you, Anette and Paul for a carefree and inviting space!"
8152191,54445213,2015-11-20,5506808,Edward,"I stayed here for about a week and had a nice time. Anette's home is very welcoming and very cozy. Anette, Paul and Mario are lovely people and made my stay really easy. Also,  I love the Green Lake area and you're right in the heart of it staying here. Thank you so much!"
8152191,55578632,2015-12-02,7436750,Felix,"Fantastic stay, nice location, super friendly hosts! We had a good time in Seattle. Very recommended :)"
8152191,56734438,2015-12-17,49447200,Larry,"I will quote Cabaret "" Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome fremde, etranger, stranger. Gluklich zu sehen, je suis enchante, happy to see you.""  So surely I felt welcome.  The room had a high cozy factor, with a good view of Second Ave, The neighbor was walk able, beware you may have to walk more than 1/2 block for take out coffee. The household had a centered vibe going on that was thoughtful and open.  All was well."
4144767,33406979,2015-05-27,1747443,Cameron,Great spot! Comfortable for a stay in ballard. Loved the deck and the BBQ. Walking distance from a QFC and the main drag in Ballard.
4144767,36394710,2015-06-28,19544360,Dena,"Upon arrival at the unit, I had a lot of trouble getting the door to unlock. It appears that the doors had swelled and the lock was not working properly. I made several calls to the rental company and eventually with much maneuvering and pounding the lock worked. It was difficult to use throughout my stay. The lock on the back door could not be opened after the first day. The knob was loose and the lock was stuck. I was told that maintenance was going to resolve it. It did not appear to be the case. The unit was much farther from downtown Ballard. Not really walking distance. The neighborhood was nice. The unit was decorated nicely. The bed was comfortable. "
4144767,38570345,2015-07-16,24211171,Alison,"I made my reservation the day-of and Sea to Sky was quick to respond, and very easy to deal with. The cottage itself was in a great location, clean, and super cute. I would definitely stay here again!"
4144767,39306069,2015-07-22,22256038,Sarah,"Great little casita in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance from the center of Ballard. Rental required a lot of extra paperwork outside the airbnb system, which surprised me. However, the folks at Sea to Sky were very friendly and helpful. I would stay here again based on the house, but the extra hoops will probably deter me. 
"
4144767,47111561,2015-09-15,43541833,Edward,"Perfect accommodation for my trip.  The cottage is comfortable, clean, and private.  "
2969955,17009726,2014-08-05,7530476,Aubrey,"Great stay at Heather's house! The space was clean, well-appointed, and very comfortable. The location was perfect for my needs - walking distance to Green Lake and the main restaurant and shopping drag in Phinney Ridge, a bit longer but still doable walk to central Ballard and Fremont. Downtown is a quick bus ride away, and the stop is a mere 1 block from the house. Heather's communication was quick and thorough - she provided super useful directions to the house for car and public transit and left a great list of favorite cafes and restaurants nearby. Even though we didn't get to meet, I couldn't have asked for a better host - thanks, Heather!"
2969955,58349211,2016-01-02,17436642,Peter,"Heather's home was very comfortable and easily slept four of us.  The house is located in a great area that was conveniently located near a small market, bar, and lots of good food options.  Overall we had a great stay in Seattle and would definitely recommend the house to anyone looking to visit the city!"
3518808,18911859,2014-09-02,8992292,Jack,Brian & Gina were excellent hosts. They were quick to respond to our questions and had great recommendations for sights/eats in the neighborhood. The accommodations were above our expectations. Everything was great!
3518808,19155791,2014-09-07,5217178,Luis,"Brian and his family are great hosts.  They made us feel extremely welcome even when arriving very late in the evening.  A great neighborhood centrally located and quite charming, that made our vacation that much more enjoyable.   I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle.  "
3518808,19447190,2014-09-12,4784420,Bob,"Brian and his family were great hosts. A family friendly place hosted by a friendly family.  The place was big and open, had games and puzzles for the kids, was clean and had a comfortable bed. The neighborhood is great for walking to cafes and parks, and we even got to take advantage of a wonderful mid-week farmers market next to a great kids playground. "
3518808,20829413,2014-10-06,20053327,Giacomo,"La casa è molto accogliente e i padroni di casa sono gentili e molto disponibili. La posizione è ottima, il quartiere tranquillo, insomma tutto perfetto!"
3518808,21961542,2014-10-27,21470238,Elizabeth,"Brian and his family made us feel very welcome! There was fresh baked pumpkin bread waiting for us when we arrived. A nice touch! They provided us a pack n play for our 18 month old son, which helped us out tremendously! They also had some puzzles for him that he loved. The description was accurate, nice sized kitchen and living area for being a mother in law apt. Very comfy bed!  The ceiling was a bit low in a few parts of the apt for my 5'10"" husband. But other than that, we had a very pleasant stay! The neighborhood was lovely and a short run to Green Lake.  A must see in the area! "
3518808,22712637,2014-11-12,23051695,LeeAnn,The space is just as pictured and Brian and his wife were great hosts.  The neighborhood was safe and conveniently located and parking was plentiful.  Having a washer & dryer in the unit was also very convenient.  I'd happily stay here again if ever in the Seattle area. 
3518808,22894228,2014-11-17,4549747,Lee,"We loved our stay at Brian's apt. It was easy to find and easy to check in and out. Communication was quick and simple.
His place was clean, warm and cozy. The bedroom was peaceful and quiet. We would stay here again and explore more of the Green Lake area. Great restaurants, coffee shops are close by and Green Lake is a short walk. Thanks Brian!"
3518808,23172719,2014-11-24,4687328,Alan,"Brian and Gina's place was wonderful. The bed was quite comfortable, and the space uniquely welcoming. Brian and Gina were great hosts, and they even provided fresh coffee beans with a grinder - a perfect way to wake up. Can't wait to visit again for our next trip to Seattle!"
3518808,23413741,2014-11-30,18888271,Victoria,"Brian was there to meet us, let us in, and show us the place. He was very welcoming. The space was as described and was perfect for our short stay in Seattle!"
3518808,23980226,2014-12-15,10376666,Navreen,"I booked this place for my sister, brother-in-law, and niece when they came to visit. Awesome location and Brian & Gina were very responsive and welcoming. The ceiling height is about 6'5"", so my brother-in-law hit his head a couple of times on the beams pictured on the right (near the entrance, so just a...""heads up"" ;) ), but the kitchen/living room was fine. Tons of books, the microwave and washer/dryer were awesome amenities, and there were some puzzles that kept my niece entertained.

Directly from my sister: ""Brian, the apartment was cozy and comfortable for the both of us, including our seven year old. I would most definitely be a repeat customer in the near future. Thank you."""
3518808,24529144,2014-12-30,22868786,Sharon,"This downstairs apartment looks just like the pictures!  What the pictures don't tell you is that the apartment was warm and cozy every time we came in, despite the cold, damp weather outside.  The neighborhood was comfortable:  we never felt unsafe there.  In addition we were close to, but not on, a major street, which made it a quick trip to our daughter's apartment as well as lots of wonderful Seattle locations.  Our hosts were friendly, good communicators, and very responsive to our requests.  The apartment was nicely decorated and furnished.  The low ceilings (most about 6'4"", but a couple of spots were less than 6') took a bit of adjustment.  We did adjust, even as tall people, and loved our little space!  We will go back!"
3518808,26165608,2015-02-05,18614722,Laura,"The place was a perfect fit for my needs, but Gina & Brian made it such a wonderful experience. They were very flexible when I needed to amend my trip, and were wonderful and gracious hosts. The bed was very comfortable, and the whole place was a lovely set up. I'd love to stay here again!"
3518808,26616013,2015-02-16,17852562,Fiona,"Brian and Gina were great hosts and their apartment was perfect for our needs. It's a bright, warm, clean, spacious apartment, conveniently located in a great neighbourhood. As others have mentioned, the ceilings are a bit low in some areas, but we didn't find this to be an issue. Brian and Gina provided thoughtful touches like coffee beans and a French press, and bread, butter, and jam, which were very much appreciated our first morning. We had our 1-year old with us and their apartment was very baby friendly and they were even kind enough to loan us their pack 'n play. We had a lovely stay there and would certainly recommend it!"
3518808,27007134,2015-02-23,20401941,Elliott,Brian and Gina provided a very comfortable and well appointed accommodation for my partner's parents visit.  They were communicative and responsive.  I would recommend this spot. 
3518808,27145447,2015-02-26,3160518,Adrian,"Brian and Gina were very nice and made the check-in process so easy.  They were very flexible about the move-in time.

The apartment was exactly as described and was extremely clean and comfortable.  They even left us coffee, fresh milk, and some light breakfast fixings!  I would definitely recommend this place.
"
3518808,27372668,2015-03-02,21261139,Alex,"My girlfriend and I had a lovely stay at Brian and Gina's place. It was just as described, if not better. Very comfortable, clean and in a great location just a block north of a park and a very short walk from tons of restaurants on 45th street. Brian and Gina were just as great and flexible with our arrival and departure times. We even found breakfast food in our fridge for the morning! Will definitely return."
3518808,27942329,2015-03-15,10364751,Ros,"Brian and Gina's apartment was a great place to stay on our arrival from the UK. It was well equipped, clean and comfortable, and Gina couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. There was an excellent pub just a short walk away where we ate on our first evening and Gina had kindly supplied cereal, milk, eggs and muffins for breakfast, which was much appreciated! Their house is in a nice neighbourhood, and very close to a bus route to downtown. Highly recommended, and we would love to stay there again if we come back to Seattle."
3518808,28318680,2015-03-22,27688529,John,"The stay in Brian and Gina's downstairs apartment was fantastic! My girlfriend and I absolutely loved it! They were excellent hosts.  Brian was accommodating and direct with showing us in! This was perfect, we were ready for some rest! The apartment was very carefully prepared for our visit.  We especially enjoyed the organic foods and coffee that they made available to us! We had everything to make us feel relaxed and at home.  I would stay at Brian and Gina's again in a heartbeat. Thank you! "
3518808,28751237,2015-03-29,10371555,Chung-Han,"Gina and Brain and their apartment are reeeeeeeeeally great~! Gina and Brain are very friendly, they kindly introduce the apartment, answer the question quickly and offer whole the stuffs we need during this trip. The apartment is gorgeous, clean and cozy just like the picture. Also have great location, we can buy any food and commodity just in walking distance. It is really beautiful experience that I have, I will recommend this apartment sincerely. "
3518808,28843117,2015-03-30,22439791,Garrett,"Conveniently located, as advertised, and very comfortable.  I would highly recommend if you are looking for accommodations near Ballard and within walking distance to local restaurants, shopping, etc.  Thanks for the pleasant stay. "
3518808,29322191,2015-04-06,29509105,Phil,Excellent experience! Perfectly described and very well kept. Neighborhood was gorgeous with easy access to Green Lake & downtown. Would recommend familiarizing yourself with traffic schedule. We'll be back :)
3518808,30363042,2015-04-20,2013716,David,"We never got to meet Brian and Gina personally but they were super friendly and accomodating and we loved the apartment. It was super clean, convenient and practical. The location is excellent--we were there on public transportation, and the city bus stop is just a block from their place. "
3518808,30811139,2015-04-27,3150308,Michelle,"A lovely, private place in a great location. Gina and Brian were wonderfully welcoming and the apartment was very comfortable - a terrific home base for our stay in Seattle. Unusually tall guests might want to be aware of the low ceilings, but our petite family fit in just right! We hope to be back."
3518808,31460169,2015-05-05,30792207,Riki,Great apartment in a lovely neighborhood!
3518808,31716755,2015-05-09,1639347,Amy,"We had a wonderful stay and visit to Seattle in the Greenwood area with Gina and Brian!  Such a convenient, walkable area! Beautiful gardens everywhere. Generous space.

Gina was very accommodating in any request we had. The home/apartment was exactly as pictured, and they were correct in that the ceilings were low in places!!  No 6footers! 

We would easily see renting again as one of our favorite things is to walk to dinner!"
3518808,32063912,2015-05-13,10169443,Louise,"Brian & Gina were great hosts! The apartment is clean and modern and had everything we needed (and more). Being able to do laundry in the unit, make coffee, and even breakfast with the English muffins and eggs they provided was all great! They were quick to communicate and were so kind to make our stay as toddler-friendly as possible. 
The location was perfect for us and we hope to stay again! "
3518808,32595170,2015-05-19,4070128,Eric,"The neighborhood was absolutely phenomenal. The apartment is walking distance to a coffee shop and a great donut place (Might-O Donuts). Also, the apartment is situated a short drive away from Wallingford, Fremont, or Greenlake areas, all on the North side of Lake Union in Seattle. The apartment itself was very nice, though a little short. I, am 5'8"", was almost hitting my head on parts of the ceiling. Everything else was super easy. The apartment has a separate entrance and there was never any issue finding parking. Brian and Gina also provided coffee for the morning. "
3518808,33229014,2015-05-26,20534814,Christi,Very good experience. Comfortable and excellent location-easy access to apt and centrally located.
3518808,33673409,2015-05-31,29346159,Neela,"This neighborhood was awesome! Bus routes into downtown were steps away, there were tons of great restaurants and bars and two beautiful parks within walking distance. We are looking into real estate prices (when we can afford them)."
3518808,34002382,2015-06-03,3924822,Roger,Very welcoming and solicitious of our comfort without being intrusive.  Great location for us.
3518808,34192393,2015-06-06,28098294,Judy,Gina welcomed us at the door . The neighborhood was quaint and easy to navigate. Our hosts provided us with nearby restaurants and attractions. Also a map of the city
3518808,34439298,2015-06-08,32154320,Stephen,"Brian, Gina, and the kids were quite welcoming.  The downstairs apartment was comfortable and had everything my wife and I needed.  "
3518808,35065509,2015-06-15,28098294,Judy,Gina and Brian greeted us at the door and were very welcoming. We stayed at the apartment the week before . We came back after a short trip to Portland.  We stayed a second time  because the apartment was clean and comfortable and felt like home.  The neighborhood was very nice.  Gina provided info on the local shops in the area which was helpful to grab a quick coffee and donut in the morning. We plan to stay there again in the future when we come back to Seattle again.
3518808,35206282,2015-06-16,7115290,Sami,Gina and Brian were very responsive and easy to get in touch with about our arrival. The space looked exactly like the pictures and had everything we needed in it. Gina said we could text her if we needed anything else which was also very nice. 
3518808,36185437,2015-06-26,32532832,Sally,The communications were clear about where to find the key and Brian greeted us but was in no way intrusive. It was a very trusting experience.
3518808,36573152,2015-06-29,11804786,Alyssa,"Brian was a lovely host, great communication skills and 100% hospitable.  The space is incredibly welcoming while remaining clean and organized.  All the necessary amenities and a beautiful location.  Loved this place!"
3518808,39827404,2015-07-26,14012821,Raina,"Brian and Gina were incredibly welcoming and helpful during our stay. Even though they were out of the country when we arrived, there was a key waiting along with everything we needed inside the apartment. As soon as we arrived they emailed us with a contact phone number to reach them if we needed anything. They welcomed us to use their back yard for our bikes, which was above and beyond our expectations. "
3518808,40750663,2015-08-02,7834112,Patrice,Brian and Gina's apartment was great! It was very clean and exactly how it was described in the listing. Brian was great at responding to emails and any questions we had regarding logistics and the Seattle area. The apartment had everything we needed and was very comfortable and relaxing. Parking was also very easy and the location was close to several of the Seattle neighborhoods and freeways. We will definitely stay here again the next time we are in town!
3518808,41934351,2015-08-10,30108231,Spencer,Place was awesome and Brian and Gina were very accommodating! 5 stars.
3518808,42705389,2015-08-15,37493350,Lindsay,"Brian and Gina's place was great. Clean, great neighborhood. Would definetly stay again."
3518808,43511413,2015-08-20,16992143,Ellen,"This place is darling.  I thought it was clean and the host was very generous.  
 This is actually my second experience with Airbnb and it was so pleasant. I am glad I tried it again. 
The host was so pleasant and accommodating."
3518808,43975118,2015-08-23,5533498,Emily,"Brian and Gina were wonderful hosts. I really appreciated their help in getting in to the apartment a bit early, and the apartment was spotlessly clean. As they mention in the description, the only drawbacks are the low ceilings and the footsteps from upstairs, but they were very upfront about both things so we knew what to expect! You do get used to the ceilings, and the kids were quiet each night by the time we got back from dinner. "
3518808,44308635,2015-08-25,8004214,Cindy,"Brian and Gina are great hosts! They're easily reachable via message/text and very responsive. The AirBnB is just as the photos show. Clean, minimal, and comfortable. Gina greeted us at check in and my boyfriend and I were able to come and go as we pleased. The place is situated in a great local neighborhood with many things to do nearby and a quick ride to downtown After long days/nights exploring Seattle we came back to a quiet and comfy bed! They also provide coffee, tea, and english muffi s for a breakfast. Definitely worth the stay and highly recommended!!"
3518808,46289188,2015-09-09,5603975,Corri,"Brian and Gina are fantastic Airbnb hosts!  They respond quickly, are so hospitable, and very welcoming.  The accommodations are very cozy and make you feel like you never left home.  Everything you need is included.  Parking never an issue either.

I have stayed at many Seattle based Airbnb apartments, and I would stay here again and again.  Clean, comfortable, near great spots within walking distance, and best of all near but OUTSIDE the U District.  As a parent of a UW student it is nice to be close but staying in the U District for me is challenging at best.    This apartment is far enough (only 1.5 miles) from campus but worlds away in terms of peace and quiet.  If you don't want to compromise your own comfort you have to give this apartment a try!   More importantly to many, Seattle city center is a quick car or bus ride away.  After all your busy Seattle days why not stay in a quiet, private oasis with all the amenities?  "
3518808,47579044,2015-09-20,1591822,Minda,"Brian & Gina were perfect hosts. The apartment was in an ideal location, close to bus lines, restaurants, and the zoo. The apartment is comfortable with a king size bed, full kitchen, bath and living room. I would definitely stay again!"
3518808,47991120,2015-09-22,1914535,Carrie,"Brian and Gina's flat was lovely! It had plenty of space for two, and there was also a washer and dryer, which was handy because we had been on the road for a while and needed to do laundry! We had a fabulous time in the neighbourhood (which was very walkable) and found it a good base for exploring Seattle. We didn't meet Brian, but Gina was a warm and welcoming host, and we had a great stay. Highly recommended. "
3518808,48565678,2015-09-27,209633,Veronica,"Brian and Gina's apartment was conveniently located for us to help our son move into UW. Gina was responsive, warm, and welcoming and we appreciated all the little amenities that made it feel like our home-away-from-home. There are many restaurants and shops within walking distance, but at the end of the day it was nice to relax with a cup of tea in this modern and cozy flat."
3518808,50227826,2015-10-10,5658985,Michael,"We had a great time at Brian & Gina's. Excellent communications
and welcoming atmosphere. The neighborhood is quiet. Parking was available. Low ceilings. We will be back."
3518808,51346894,2015-10-19,4118391,Nicole,"We loved our stay at Brian and Gina's place! Great location, nice place, comfy bed, really quiets and we really appreciated the little added extras provided such as snacks, shampoo/conditioner which was a really nice touch.
Highly recommend their place!"
3518808,52124473,2015-10-26,6090964,Christy,"Brian and Gina's flat is wonderful. Clean, comfortable, and filled with homey touches. The coffee and french press were a treat. Great wifi and Netflix. Lovely, walkable neighborhood with free street parking and an awesome doughnut shop!  Brian and Gina were always a text away if we needed something. Definitely recommend!"
3518808,53543316,2015-11-09,35864863,Jordan,Brian and Gina were great hosts. Their place was beautiful. It was super close to all kinds of cool Seattle food spots. Highly recommend them. 
3518808,55205251,2015-11-29,4995287,Catherine,"Brian and Gina are the sweetest hosts. They left English muffins and jam and other items for coffee to include cream.  Having a toddler, this was extremely helpful. Very child friendly. My daughter slept like a champ. We never hear them even though they're on the floor above us. They were easy to reach and flexible. The place is as described. Comfortable, clean, easy access, and a great location. I very much recommend staying with them. "
4250639,25612614,2015-01-20,918434,Brian,"Everyone I talked to at Sea to Sky was very helpful and checking in and out was a painless process. The apartment was nice and had a great location meaning we could walk to tons of great restaurants, coffee shops, and things to do. It was a great way to see Seattle."
4250639,32264484,2015-05-16,23785141,Christoph,The apartment was as shown in the pictures and the location was perfect for waking anywhere downtown. It was nice to have the option for a toddler package at an additional price. The only drawback was that it was not accessible for strollers. There are no ramps. The noise level from the freeway was something to get used to. Sky to Sea team was friendly and we consider renting again. 
4250639,33678459,2015-05-31,30982314,Deen,"The condo was great ! Very clean and everything we needed was present. The location was perfect, everything we visited was at a walking distance. Very happy with the condo and the contact with Sea To Sky Rentals !"
4250639,36275664,2015-06-27,18572509,Paul,This place was wonderful and so close to the convention center.  We were greeted when expected and shown how to do everything we needed.  Internet worked great.  
67270,195543,2011-03-09,404306,Eric,"Jean and her family are warm and inviting.  They went above and beyond to ensure my stay was enjoyable.  The living space is clean, comfortable, and offers lots of privacy.

It was an excellent experience and I highly recommend staying here!"
67270,231897,2011-04-19,457072,Kathleen,"Jean and family are fantastic hosts.  This is a wonderful family friendly place with a clean, spacious, and private basement space.  The location is an easy bus ride to downtown. In general, my friend and I had a great experience and I loved the company when we were around."
67270,241824,2011-04-26,116885,Sarah,"The basement suite was bright, big and had everything I needed for my stay.

Jean was very helpful with tips on how to get around Seattle and what places to see.

I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would consider staying there again."
67270,257365,2011-05-09,538380,Sophie,"Absolutely loved staying at Jean's home. The whole family was so warm and welcoming! The room was very private, clean and comfortable. The bathroom was very nice, clean and had everything you could need! The location was a short drive to downtown, lots of parking and a nice area. We really enjoyed our stay, everything was perfect and went so smoothly. I highly recommend! "
67270,292746,2011-06-01,366727,David,"Jean and her family were great hosts.  The space is roomy, private and clean.  We hope to be back soon."
67270,305505,2011-06-09,595517,Tamea,Jean's home is beautiful.  This family is beautiful.  We had a wonderful time.
67270,311513,2011-06-13,575965,Lucia,"Room and bathroom were very clean and comfortable. You had  kind of a living room for you, so all together was like a little apartment. Very good for just $50. "
67270,324198,2011-06-20,606993,Peter,"Very nice helpful people,easy to talk too,pleasant stay overall,close bus connection"
67270,348433,2011-07-02,355544,Sabrina,"Jean and her family were the perfect hosts! The room was great, in a great location and clean! They were friendly and nice and so helpful! I loved staying there and I would do it again!

Thank you!"
67270,355238,2011-07-05,749919,Tara,Jean and family were very inviting into their quaint home right outside of dt Seattle. I really enjoyed numerous conversations to get insight into the area. Thank you again and hopefully we will cross paths again when I am living in the area. Thabk you for your hospitality! Tara
67270,391781,2011-07-23,826086,R. Todd,"Gracious host family, nice set up in basement with private bath and sitting area. Great for traveling with a child. We loved ease of light rail from airport and into city. Columbia City is a great little corner of Seattle. We used the coin op laundry across from our breakfast diner and the public library to print our City Pass tickets. "
67270,415086,2011-08-02,770107,Tom,"The accommodations were good.  The bedroom had ample space and storage, with a good sized very comfy bed with 4 pillows, while my daughter slept happily on the unit's living room.  Ethernet cable provided internet access for one computer but with no wireless we had to take turns.  Patio was good for relaxing reading and talks.  The fridge was handy.  

Seward Park and the stores were more than ""a few blocks away""; more like a 15-20 minute walk, with some serious hills, depending on our route.  The neighborhood had some of the most gorgeous small gardens and creative landscaping I've seen (I visited at the end of July).  

Jean was sadly out of town, so we didn't get to meet her.  Husband Mike was helpful, even offered to clean our dishes after our lunch and dinner.  We had lots of schedule and number-of-visitors changes before arriving, which Jean accommodated with grace.  When my daughter and I arrived, I asked Mike if it was ok for us to stay into the afternoon on our last day because we'd planned our trains and a visit for late afternoon.  He said, sure, no problem.  However, our last evening he said he had someone else coming and we had to be out by the official 11am deadline.  This was a bit of a problem for me, but not for my daughter.  Mike kindly drove her to the somewhat distant airport-bound train at five in the morning. "
67270,432284,2011-08-09,825235,Josh,"We cannot say enough about Jean, Mike and their family!  They are just wonderful!  They went out of their way to communicate with us and make sure we were comfortable.  We are both Deaf, and Jean and her family were VERY gracious and patient with us.  Their home is just beautiful, and the garden is even better.  They have put all these little touches into their guest suite that show you they put quite a lot of thought into making sure you are comfortable, such as the maps and bus route pamphlets in the desk.  Jean rescued us when we were standing at the wrong bus stop, and she was genuinely interested in our plans and if we were enjoying ourselves.  She took the time to explain everything around us and to show us around.  As other reviewers have stated, yes-this place is one mile from the light link.  However, there is a bus stop one block away, and it is really a gorgeous location.  We both plan to go back to Seattle, and we both definitely want to stay with Jean, Mike and their family.  This is such a fun, positive place to be! :)  "
67270,444814,2011-08-14,749919,Tara,"Well another wonderful stay at Jean's home.  If you are comin to the Seattle Area, this is the place you would want to stay.  These hosts are everything you could ask for!  I even referred their place to family and friends.  Thank you again Jean and family for the wonderful place to stay and enjoyable time in Seattle. Tara"
67270,450033,2011-08-16,613322,Vincent,"Great place, nice people ! That was perfect."
67270,458628,2011-08-19,658915,Chugrad,"I have stayed with Jean and her wonderful family several times. I keep returning because the family is very warm, trusting, friendly, and hospitable (they even left a cupcake with a candle and a nice card for me on my birthday), and the space is a nicely finished new construction (radiant heat designer cement floors are a nice touch). The guest space is in the basement but is well lit and completely private. The neighborhood is safe and only a few blocks from an amazing walking/running/biking path around Lake Washington, a couple cafes, an a Natural Food grocery store. I highly recommend this place to anyone... my wife and I stayed there with our toddler and it worked out great as well."
67270,513335,2011-09-08,102726,Hope,"We had an overall nice stay at this home. The house was built by the owner, Mike...very well done, beautiful craftsmanship. The couple are very informative and easy going. The two children are also kind and the privacy great. The only one negative for me, was the bed. But if you dont mind a soft mattress, it will be fine. Clean, quiet, a walk to the lake.!

67270,525733,2011-09-12,993311,Julie,"Jean was a gracious and wonderful host and the accommodations were absolutely perfect.  The bedroom, private bath, and sitting area were all spotless and quiet.  The family's beautiful home is just 2 blocks from Lake Washington and a wonderful walking/biking trail.  The whole family is warm, kind, and engaging.  I couldn't have asked for better experience!  I'd definitely stay with Jean again."
67270,531955,2011-09-14,985227,Katie,"Jean was a fantastic host.  The  clean room, internet hookup, little refrigerator and wonderful shower were all that we needed in the short time we stayed.  Both mornings Jean provided us with a nice breakfast and we were able to catch up on what to see and do in Seattle."
67270,554223,2011-09-21,910718,Harriett,"I felt so welcomed by Jean and Mike Toutant and their 2 exceptional children.  They went out of their way to make my visit fabulous.  The apartment was immaculately clean and tastefully decorated. The 3 rooms were spacious, the bed was perfect and the shower was excellent.  The home is in a very quiet neighborhood, close to the lake, 1 block from the bus, and 1 mile from the light rail. It was very easy for me to tour all of Seattle's sites, without a car.  I would definitely stay there again when visiting Seattle.  "
67270,590135,2011-10-02,443313,Ivana,"Jean and her family are simply amazing! We spent 5 nights at their house and there is absolutely nothing we could complain about. The bed is comfortable, the wather pressure in shower is great, the location is convinient and the whole family is just awsome! Jean´s husband even took us to light rail station in the middle of the night, because we had to catch a flight early in the morning. What else can I say? Just a big THANK YOU FOR EVERYTING."
67270,624493,2011-10-12,1252823,Mona,"Our stay in Jean & Mike's welcoming home was exactly what we needed for a four day getaway.  Jean responded quickly to our email sent the day before our arrival!  Their home and guest quarters are immaculate.  We so appreciated the care that has obviously gone into this very special creation of the owners, Mike & Jean. Loved the sitting room, the privacy, quiet neighborhood & household - great place to recover from a grueling day of sightseeing :) We ate well in the local restaurants & found some great live music in the neighborhood.  Comfy bed, too!!  Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
67270,719501,2011-11-14,1383535,Karli,"(First, sorry about the late review!) We had a fantastic stay with this family! The space (bedroom, sitting room, bathroom) was gorgeous and warm and clean, and quiet. We were out and about most of the time, so we didn't get to know the family very well, but they were so gracious and flexible and we absolutely enjoyed ourselves and were able to rest and relax. The house is so beautiful, and in a very quiet location, no traffic noise at all. It was quick and easy to get to all different parts of Seattle. Comfy bed, great snacks, private space, we couldn't have asked for more. Thank you so much!"
67270,735712,2011-11-21,1016659,Katrina,I booked Airbnb for a dancer that I hosted a dancer that taught at Skin Deep Dance Studio. She was very happy and comfortable here. We will definately bring more dancers back to this lovely home! 
67270,853204,2012-01-09,74323,Chelsea,"This was an incredible place to stay.  There is tons of space, a very comfortable bed, friendly hosts, and nice personal touches.  It is very close to Columbia city center which has great restaurants, and shops.  I will try to stay here on every trip to Seattle."
67270,869501,2012-01-17,341001,Andrew,"If you're in Seattle—stay here! We had a great stay in these warm, large and private accommodations. Plus Jean and her husband are awesome hosts who genuinely love having guests and go out of their way to make them feel at home. A gem of a spot for sure. Thanks again, guys!"
67270,896467,2012-02-01,1588277,Ian,"The hosts are very approachable and nice people. The accommodation is excellent - spacious and comfortable with a very good bed. We were in town to se our son and grandkids, so we were at the b&b only to sleep. However, if we had wanted, we could have spent more time their reading and relaxing. We know the area well and there is excellent walking along lake Washington a few minutes walk away.   "
67270,1008167,2012-03-17,1819291,Micah,"Very accomadating host's. The bed was so comfortable and the room over all very cozy. Mike and Jean's home is located in a beautifull neighborhood and using the bus to get to downtown Seattle was very easy. A few blocks down the street sit's a small Cafe that we took advantage of most mornings while waiting on the bus. The Cafe is absolutely charming, cozy, excellant food and the wait staff are some of the friendliest people we've ever met. Definately reccomend Mike and Jean's place.  We where very happy with our stay :-)"
67270,1052615,2012-03-27,396751,Pat,"This turned out to be just what I wanted -- a lovely, private, immaculately clean room & bath in one of my favorite Seattle neighborhoods. 

Because I didn't bring my car, I  appreciated how near the house is to the bus stop. But I didn't go out much when I found out how conducive the room was to writing.

I'll definitely look forward to staying here again.
"
67270,1078793,2012-04-03,1502564,Juanita,"Lovely spot to stay.  Quiet, private and relaxing what more could you want. Breakfast spot 2 blocks away which was super.  
All in all a great stay!"
67270,1221263,2012-05-03,1844619,Megan,"I made this reservation for my in-laws who were vistiing from out of town. Jean was great and flexible when were were booking the arrangements. Here is what my in-laws report:

 We were extremely happy with our ""light & airy room by the lake."" My husband had plenty of places to take morning walks or just sit in the private sitting room reading while I slept in. Mike is a very handy, gifted woodworker whom (we  found out) remodeled the ""light & airy rooms"" with reclaimed lumber. Our privacy was honored daily, yet in a strange way we felt like part of the family. Their cute little dog Harri greeted us often, but I've never witnessed such a well-behaved, quiet dog. We highly recommend the Jones-Toutant accommodations.
"
67270,1248190,2012-05-08,257560,Karen,"We had an excellent experience on our stay.   Jean was so flexible after our flight was cancelled and our arrival plans changed, and the space was everything we needed.  Jean and Mike have a beautiful, peaceful home, and we would love to stay here on a future Seattle visit.  Thank you again!"
67270,1287853,2012-05-15,2335050,Jason,"My girlfriend and I were coming into the city to go apartment hunting and at the last minute we were put into something of a pinch as our place to stay fell through. We found this spot, noticed the price was right, the place looked cozy and put in a request to book all the night before our arrival. Jean got back to us very promptly and let us stay. The place is wonderful and very private. The owners are courteous and helpful. It is located in a beautiful area with very easy access to public transport to get into the main part of the city. Overall, we really couldn't have asked for anything better. Very highly recommended."
67270,1375524,2012-05-29,600097,Camille,"Jean was very hospitable and thoughtful.
The room was very comfortable, with a private bathroom and small living area. Seward Park is walking distance and the light rail did not seem too far, although we drove. Downtown was 20mns away by car.

A very good experience."
67270,1433032,2012-06-07,2308280,Cassadra,"Jean and her husband Mike was so gracious to my boyfriend and I during our stay. Jean came to pick us up at the train station and gave us a little tour of the area. We really appreciated that. Their house has a very warm, inviting feel to it and her dog is really cute. Their house is a couple of blocks away from the bus line that take you into town. I highly recommend their house!"
67270,1595163,2012-06-30,2525412,Peg,"My daughter and I had a fabulous time during our first trip to Seattle. Jean and Mike have created a fabulous retreat in their charming home. Located in a very nice neighborhood super close to the lake.   The bed and linens were so comfortable, a great shower and large sitting area with kitchen area. All spotlessly clean and welcoming.  Beyond the amenities and space we loved getting to know Jean and her family. She is a wonderful host and made us feel so welcome.  I really appreciated her simple set of ""house"" rules; it makes staying in someone's home so much easier when you know what to do with your trash, for instance.  She provided us with great tips and directions about Columbia City and Seattle (very easy to get to via light rail) and just as important was that jean made me feel like an old friend who was excited to share her fun and funky Columbia City and the big city of Seattle.

I highly recommend Jean's home as your next stay while in Seattle. Hopefully we will return before too long!"
67270,1625828,2012-07-03,2755125,Bryce,"This was our first AirBnB experience and we thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end - the accommodations provided were beyond expectation and the location was convenient for us to get to the downtown tourist attractions.

Jean and Michael are great hosts; they were very respectful of our privacy and willing to provide us with suggestions of where to go during our short stay. Definitely a great option for visitors to Seattle.

Thanks Jean and Michael!"
67270,1722137,2012-07-16,2697085,Robert,"It was wonderful staying at Jean's home, and I would definitely stay there again.  It's relatively new, and along with the beautiful gardens, is very well kept.  It's located in a nice neighborhood within short walking distance of a great breakfast or excellent pizza. The sleeping area was spacious and immaculate. Jean and her family were friendly and fun to talk to.  She and Mike offered advice on things to do in Seattle, and how to use the Light Rail System, but at the same time were unobtrusive. Her children were polite, friendly, and engaging (good luck in Jr Olympics...and Emmett, be sure to wear your helmet).  "
67270,1747977,2012-07-19,2268412,Rona,"The accommodations were very comfortable and spacious and super clean.  There is a no shoes rule inside the house. The location was very convenient to the lake, a great breakfast/coffee shop, and also to public transportation.  "
67270,1882699,2012-08-04,2441255,Wendy,Great place to stay.  Very well equipped with a great shower.  Mike was very helpful.  Never got to meet Jean as she was away.  Only thing is that wifi would have been nice as being a traveller it is a necessity so you can check emails and book other accommodation along the way.  Would highly recommend as a lovely quiet place to stay.
67270,2119398,2012-08-27,2999521,Nicolle,"Short Answer: We would likely stay here again.  (Scale: never, likely not, meh, likely, definitely).

Long Answer:  We stayed here on a Friday and Saturday night.  The host accommodated our late arrival (10PM).

Neighborhood:  Residential area with a relaxed feel.  The house itself sits just a few blocks from Lake Washington near the Columbia City area and is not too far from downtown.  The street had plenty of parking.  We parked right next to the house and did not feel unsafe.  Columbia City offers quality dining/coffee options.

House:  The host keeps the house in pristine condition.  I also enjoyed the design and construction elements.  The room itself is located in the basement.  The bedroom and bathroom were comparatively large and, of course, nicely furnished and clean.  The bathroom was probably one of the nicest bathrooms I have seen anywhere.  The washer and dryer are in the apartment space, but house rules indicate they are available to guests for 1 wash/dry. We did not experience the use of the washer/dryer by the host during our 2 night stay.

While the room has access to the internet, the connection is only via ethernet/cable connection.  Devices that utilize *only* WiFi will not be able to connect because the room offers no WiFi.  Further, my cell phone (4G/Verizon) had only a 1x signal in the basement (I loved, as stated above, the cement floors and the design, but it probably interfered with my cell phone signal.)  Irony abounded as our cell phone signal in this room was worse than the signal at the summit of a trail at Mt. Ranier (3G came in clear.)  We brought a laptop with an ethernet port (cable provided by the host), so we didn't have a problem connecting via ethernet.  

The seating area has a desk space with local brochures and public transportation schedules. Since we were in Seattle for the weekend, we drove downtown and therefore did not use the public transportation information.

Host:  We enjoyed the host's company.  She was friendly and reasonable.  We interacted with her when we arrived and when we departed because the apartment is functionally separate from the rest of the house.  During the brief time we chatted during our departure, we met her children, who were both lovely.

We truly enjoyed the opportunity to stay and appreciate the host's time and consideration."
67270,2225600,2012-09-07,396751,Pat,"Just perfect. This was my second stay, and I'll definitely want to come back. The host family is friendly and welcoming, and the accommodations are quiet, private, and almost unbelievably immaculate -- I felt as though the place was all mine, that nobody else had stayed there between my visits! The bed is very comfy, with nice linens, and the bathroom, with its attractive fixtures and roomy shower, is downright elegant.

As for electronics -- the ""Clear Stick Atlas"" I started using a couple months ago (when I figured out the monthly fee was cheaper than the multiple coffee-shop purchases I was routinely making just to get WiFi) got my macbook online immediately, and my funky Net10 cellphone worked fine in both rooms too; so, for my devices at least, signals were strong in the area. I could've gotten online with the cord the family provided and my USB ethernet adapter, though, had I needed to.

I'm already looking forward to staying here again, in a neighborhood I know and love.
"
67270,2281311,2012-09-14,1803505,Dianne,"Staying at Jean and Mikes was our first experience reserving a short stay through Airbnb.  Excellent start!  Repeating what others have said, the space is comfortably furnished and is immaculate.  Their home is in a perfect location for getting to Seattle attractions.  There is a neighborhood restaurant close by for breakfast and lunch that we enjoyed a couple of times.  Many other restaurants close by.  Just a few blocks from Lake Washington which we checked out and Seward park. Only downside is lack of internet access and no tv, but everything else surpasses the lack of  those two items. I would recommend staying here!!"
67270,2339803,2012-09-18,1588277,Ian,"We just need a place close to our son's house with a comfortable bed, a private shower and a place to sit and read at the end of the evening. Jean's place meets our needs perfectly."
67270,2469453,2012-10-01,3417756,Stacey,"Jean and her family were very gracious and welcoming hosts. We arrived very late (11 pm) on the light rail, and Jean offered to pick us and our luggage up at the nearest station, which was such an incredible relief after hours spent traveling. The rental space is the basement of their house, but has been completely remodeled, and is surprisingly bright and cheery. The very roomy bathroom features a really lovely tiled shower, and the living room space includes a mini-fridge and small couch. Jean provided a few suggestions for places to investigate, which were very much appreciated. We were afforded plenty of privacy, but were able to interact with the family when entering and exiting the property. Our stay was short, but we had a great time, and I can't thank them enough for making us feel welcome in a brand new city."
67270,2707465,2012-10-24,3832695,Karen,"This was our first time using Airbnb and it was a fantastic start! Jean was super friendly and welcoming and we felt right at home in her house. The space itself is private, clean, and had everything we needed (including an extra long ethernet cable, which was helpful to prevent roaming charges for us). The bed was really comfortable too! As it was our first time in Seattle, Jean provided us with a lot of great suggestions of how to get around town as well as tips of local eateries. There's a fantastic coffee shop right around the corner. It's a little bit far from downtown via public transit (although realistically if you can time it right it only takes about 30 minutes), but if you have a car it's in a really nice location and you get a nice feel for the city. "
67270,3036674,2012-12-06,1588277,Ian,"As always, it is a perfect place for us to stay while visiting our family."
67270,3757012,2013-03-11,2777198,Bryan,"Great place and wonderful host. Just a couple of blocks for the lake. Nice coffee shop around corner. Awesome bathroom and shower. Looks like a classic craftsman, but the entire house is new construction. Basement apartment is warm and comfortable with in-floor radiant heating. First on my list when we return to Seattle."
67270,3890055,2013-03-25,5083232,Eyja,The house is beautiful and the whole guest area is absolutely wonderful. Jean and Mike were very friendly and helpful. We wish we could have stayed longer.
67270,4372318,2013-04-30,5806272,Pam,The reservation was canceled 8 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
67270,5154290,2013-06-15,6271418,Linda,"Peaceful and gracious household!  -So important when offering a room to rent and Jean and her husband Mike, have all that it takes :).  The room is private, with a living room, mini refrigerator, private bathroom with a huge tile shower.  All new fixtures, separate bedroom with a door.  These private quarters are set-up in the basement; multiple windows with a view of the beautiful yard foliage.  If you are super sensitive to a basement setting; this is not the place for you.  For those that are not; this basement has all of the modern upgrades; amazing bed, plenty of storage for personal items; armor, dresser drawers, night stand stocked with cute lamp, over head lighting, alarm/radio clock, comfy chair all in the bedroom. The living room of these private quarters was stocked with a desk and multiple tourist and local brochures.  Jean and Mike were kind, mellow, but helpful, attentive and made me feel beyond welcome.  Beautiful house with outside seating surrounded by a beautiful yard and lovely neighborhood.  Organic grocery store, cafe and restaurant 4 blocks away.  Lake Washington just a couple blocks away...nice for exercise and day dreaming.   "
67270,5578284,2013-07-07,1552491,Elizabeth,We really enjoyed meeting Jean and her family-- all very friendly and welcoming.  The location was convenient to both Lake Washington and some nice restaurants.  A beautiful neighborhood.
67270,5668002,2013-07-10,6312858,Max,"Jean and Mike were wonderful hosts! Really nice to talk to and helpful with great advices. The room is private, in the basement but has enough light coming through the windows. The bathroom is great. I would always stay there again and recommend it to everyone, especially for couples staying in Seattle for a few days. Only downside was that there is no wi-fi, so you will need to have a Laptop for internet access. But there is a great cafe around the corner with complimentary wifi, that worked perfectly for us as well :)"
67270,5768326,2013-07-15,7238160,Jan,"My husband and I were visiting family and friends after moving away from Seattle 2 years ago. Jean's family was lovely and the downstairs apartment-like set up was very nice! It was very private with plenty of room.

Each morning we would make ourselves some tea with the hotpot supplied and have breakfast yogurt we stored in the little refrigerator in our room. We walked the two blocks to Lake Washington and we explored the walking trails and neighborhoods. Breakfast is not served in this bnb, but that was fine with us. Lovely people, lovely place. I hope to be able to stay here again."
67270,5834136,2013-07-18,1588277,Ian,"We have stayed several times. As before it fulfills our needs very well. The hosts are very nice people. The place is private, quiet, perfectly situated near our family and friends, and has a firm, comfortable bed. The only item needed to make it perfect is wi-fi."
67270,5917390,2013-07-22,849342,Ann Marie,"I really enjoyed our stay at Jean's house.  It was quiet, peaceful, and very comfortable.  It was quite hot outside and the cement floors of this place were cooling and soothing.  (I can imagine in the winter that they would be wonderfully warming, as they are heated.) I slept well, and felt very good there. I look forward to staying there again."
67270,6022088,2013-07-27,4589973,Vanitha,"This was a wonderful space for me to decompress and as another guest said, daydream with the beautiful lake a few steps away from the house.  During my 5-day stay I couldn't get enough of going down to the lake!  The space is very nice, in the basement of the house which was brilliantly designed by Mike himself.  I didn't get the pleasure of meeting Jean but all my conversations with her were very pleasant before my arrival.  And don't get fooled by basement...it didn't feel that way at all.  The way it was designed was very bright and sunlight poured into the room each day.  It was built like a 1-bedroom suite, with a large bathroom, a desk, couch, and separate bedroom.  There was a long table with a hotpot on it and a small refrigerator.  The lighting in the bedroom was so soft and inviting as there were small lights in each section of the room so if you were reading in bed versus working on the chair in the room, you could turn on different lights in there which was a nice touch.  I felt very comfortable.  There is also a washer/dryer down there that the family uses but during my couple days stay they didn't need to use it.  They do include a 1 time laundry for free and after that you have to pay.  I loved the neighborhood and get a great vibe from all the community gardens, smiling faces, and cats/dogs that were in the area.  Walking around is nice in this area and those hills can give you a nice workout!  There is a pizza and cafe place nearby as well as a coffee shop, Italian restaurant and PCC in walking distance. 

A few things to keep in mind:
-there is no wifi, but instead an ethernet cord.  The cord stretches to the bed and the desk in the room so for my purposes this was fine, but you couldn't take your laptop onto the porch or hammock (which would've been awesome)
-Mike is a very skilled cabinetmaker and has a shop in the home.  A few mornings he was drilling away early which would have disturbed me if I wanted to sleep in, but it was fine as I was up anyway.  The basement has a sliding door that separates the space from the rest of the house so you can hear most everything on the first floor.  Just something to keep in mind or mention if you want to sleep in.
-the house is about 1-1.5 miles from the nearest link station so make sure you ask for good directions using the bus or if you're walking."
67270,6312556,2013-08-07,2520782,Allison,"Jean was a great host and I had a wonderful time staying in her home. The basement apartment was a really lovely space with lots of natural light and very comfortable. I really loved Columbia City and exploring the immediate neighborhood a bit. Jean gave great advice about the area, was easy to communicate with, and I would definitely recommend staying here."
67270,6358572,2013-08-09,7896481,Luzia,"Jean's place is beautifully decorated and spotless. The downstairs accommodation consists of a bedroom with a comfortable queen-size bed, a private bathroom with plenty of towels and a sort of living-room where the family's laundry facilities are. 
The house is located in a quiet neighborhood with a nice breakfast place just around the corner. Columbia City station for the airport and the downtown area is easily accessible by bus or on foot if you don't mind walking a mile.
We contacted Jean only a couple of days ahead, but she got back to us quickly and everything was organized in no time. She is a very friendly and helpful host. We didn't see much of her or her family, this was mainly due to us being busy discovering this marvelous city, however.
I would highly recommend staying in this lovely spot.

67270,6422177,2013-08-12,6849418,Toby,"We were in Seattle for a friend's 60th birthday and were thrilled to have found such a lovely home away from home. Jean and her family were so welcoming. Their house is beautiful and they have created a very private, clean and wonderful space for visitors. They are a short walk from Lake Washington in one direction and the main street of the Columbia City neighborhood in the other. Within a few blocks is an excellent cafe for breakfast. We could not had a better spot for our  Seattle weekend. I highly recommend it."
67270,6502757,2013-08-14,8057699,Paul & Kat,"We had a wonderful stay in Jean's home. It is set in a beautiful neighbourhood, minutes from the water with a peaceful garden surrounding the house and adding to it's tranquil environment. The lower level (our private area) was spotless, consciously designed and had a very comfortable bed. The perfect space to return and relax after our busy days in the city. Easy access downtown by car (15minutes) but also near bus line or a short bus ride to the Light Rail. Jean and her family were welcoming and lovely. We would not hesitate to return if they would have us!"
67270,6596161,2013-08-18,7776068,Brenda,"Nice location for evening walks.  Close to Lake Washington.  
Room was as describe- good bed, plenty of private space, nice bathroom.  Host is easy to work with.  I would stay here again. Public transport is nearby. 
Only con- if you don't have a car there  is only one choice of evening restaurant to walk to, and only one breakfast place to walk to- but very near by.  "

Two bus routes provide easy access to downtown Seattle. On our first morning, I had planned our commute and was all set to use bus 50. But before leaving I was able to talk to Jean and she told me about bus 7. She was really helpful and I'm glad I took Jean's advice because even though it took longer, the walk along Genesee was quite enjoyable and the weather was pleasant. Just be sure to check the schedules because we were out late and missed the bus home. Other than that minor inconvenience (which was entirely my fault), our stay at Jean and Mike's was perfect. Thank you so much for having us :)"
