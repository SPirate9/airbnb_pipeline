If you've ever stayed at a hostel before, it's not so bad getting used to living with so many people in one room. They also have everything you could need for a short or a longer stay, like cooking supplies, random ingredients, shampoo, towels, etc.  It's also nice to stay here if you're moving to Seattle- you can meet a lot of cool people!"
6591894,46756420,2015-09-13,41505476,Jenny,"If you're looking to meet some awesome people, then Crayola Home is the place for you!  Seriously, the home is beautiful and so are its owners. (: Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful.  Leah was very informative, organized, and welcoming.  From the moment we arrived, she graciously gave my traveling buddy and me a tour of the place.  

The home has a very cozy feeling, albeit it's a 11 bedroom house.  Getting around the city is really easy.  You can save money by taking the transit, since it's literally just a few blocks away.  I can't get over how beautiful the neighborhood is, so I encourage you to take a jog around the place and head to the near by parks.  It's a must. 

I'll most likely be visiting Washington in the near future, and when I do, I'll definitely be checking into Crayola! 

Missin' Seattle already! 3"
6591894,47317775,2015-09-17,42331145,John,"I definitely enjoyed my stay at the Crayola Home, it was clean, well organized, and the roommates were super friendly. I never actually met the host, but he was great at communicating through the Airbnb interface. I really enjoyed the youth hostel-like environment. I had stayed in hostels in other countries before but didn't realize that places like this existed in the US. The neighborhood was quiet and residential, and while there weren't many shops in the immediate vicinity, the location was fairly central to the city itself. I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Seattle!"
6591894,47645428,2015-09-21,26694534,Shannon,"Staying at the Crayola Home was one of my favorite experiences on my trip to Seattle. The walk from the bus stop was close, beautiful and surrounded by other interesting houses. I met a bunch of really great people who made me feel at home right away. The only disappointment that I had was not being able to stay longer!"
6591894,48797430,2015-09-28,41767700,Soyeong,"I haven't had a luck to meet the host during the stay, but the manual I was given before arrival was clear enough to understand all the rules in the house. It seemed the people in the house were following the instructions very well. The place were kept clean. "
6591894,51052298,2015-10-17,25410446,Inah,"Everything about this place was wonderful! Leah was very accommodating and easy to contact. I have made some great friends while I stayed here. I am so glad that the Crayola House was my very first Airbnb.

The description was accurate. The house was very comforting and everyone was incredibly nice. There were plenty of hangouts with the other guests and also a study area if you need to do work. It's located in Capitol Hill, so it's very easy to get downtown and other tourist sites. I would definitely recommended this place :)"
6591894,51588000,2015-10-21,8132356,Yasir,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Crayola Home on my first visit to Seattle. I was pleasantly surprised to find reasonable accommodations in/near Capitol Hill which is almost impossible in Seattle these days. Immediately I warmed up to the place and all the amazing people that were staying there – some permanent, some long-term visitors while others were passing through like myself. Although I rarely stay in shared rooms, I enjoyed my stay at The Purple Room and I found the entire house very warm, friendly and full of polite people.  I have stayed at a lot of hostels in the past but Crayola Home is one place where polite strangers quickly became friends and by the time I was ready to leave it was almost like saying goodbye to a family. If you have stayed in shared rooms before and would like to stay at a place where you can become friends and hang out with others staying at the same place as you, Crayola Home is a great option! "
6591894,53003658,2015-11-03,24427349,Tom,Crayola is a great place to be. I'll definitely be returning for pizza night. Very clean and met all of my needs. Everyone is very friendly.
6591894,55159940,2015-11-28,38822457,Yongxin,"It is happy to stay in this big house just like a big family, we celebrated      the thanks giving day all together, it's really a good experience for me！"
7072218,38042775,2015-07-12,37135386,Joanna,"Nick's place was great! There's plenty of parking and places to eat in the area, the apartment was very clean, and the area was pretty quiet but also convenient. Very comfy; I enjoyed my stay."
7072218,39805156,2015-07-26,26332923,Jon,"Great instructions and information provided prior to the trip. Apartment was very clean and organized. Really enjoyed the keurig coffee provided. Great spot in a safe neighborhood very near to downtown. Nick was also very flexible and accommodating with checkout time. 
Thanks Nick!"
7072218,44945343,2015-08-30,38769772,Adam,"This was a nice private and cozy space, with everything we needed.  It was a convenient location for us!  We enjoyed our stay and are considering this one again next time we come out!"
7072218,46804667,2015-09-13,16900347,Diane,"Nick’s place worked out well for our weekend in Seattle!  The apartment was cozy and modern as described, also very inviting  and well stocked with everything a traveler may need. The location is good, very easy get around. The whole experience from start to finish was a breeze. Nick was quick to reply and provided great information. The cozy modern apartment is definitely on our list for future trips to Seattle. 
"
7072218,47914560,2015-09-21,44379284,Zach,Nick's place was my first time using Air BnB and I found it to be very enjoyable. His place was very clean with all the necessary amenities. Based on this experience I will definitely use Air BnB again. 
7072218,48574578,2015-09-27,24678425,Laura,"Fantastic and super convenient location.  The apartment is very clean and stocked, it was perfect for the two of us for a weekend in town.  Nick is very responsive and communicated well with us for check-in.  Loved the space!"
7072218,50408032,2015-10-11,12364049,Philip,"Nick's place was wonderful. He was very helpful and communicative in advance, the place was exactly as advertised, and I had a great time. I will definitely recommend this to my friends and anyone else looking for a place close to Capitol Hill."
7072218,52020184,2015-10-25,47115726,Diane,"This was my first time using Airbnb and I was really impressed with the process. Nick made this experience very easy for me. He was quick to respond, gave clear instructions and the apartment felt like a hotel. The location made for quick access to all Seattle attractions and there were several great restraunts close by. I highly recommend this apartment to others! "
3642289,16878024,2014-08-03,9649598,Celina,"Angela's home was so inviting and comfortable. I was very impressed with everything, even for a first time host. The room and bathroom were so clean and accommodating with towels, toiletries and linens.  Her pets were very friendly and her energetic children were so polite. I would highly recommend for a cozy stay in Seattle. "
3642289,17079966,2014-08-06,12628828,Bram,"They have a lovely house on a street near to a grocery store and a bus stop from where the bus takes you directly downtown. The bed room and bathroom have everything you need and they are connected to the entrance hall so you dont have to walk through other rooms to get there. There is enough parking space around the house and it is very easy to find coming from the interstate. The family is very kind and are willing to give you tips on where to go and what to do.
We had a great 3 nights stay!"
3642289,17316784,2014-08-10,14793043,William,"Angela and her family have an excellent set-up available with a lot of care shown in hosting airbnb'ers.  The bedroom and bathroom are together and private, and are at the front of the house on a quiet street with practically no traffic at all off of a front ""mud room"". Thus while it is technically a shared entrance, it feels in some ways like a private entrance because you don't need to go through the house to get to the room.  It is a comfortable bed with lots of pillows including an ergonomic ""neck pillow"" that I used along with others, and a good bathroom with a nice shower and solid water pressure.  The hosts have provided lots of little thoughtful items and small toiletries to make the stay feel gracious and warm.  They have a couple of laid back and very friendly dogs--super welcoming to me. Angela was very helpful with tips on where to run / exercise, and on places nearby. There is a cute little neighborhood about a mile up Rainer Ave with several very good restaurants (a great Italian place and more), bakery, Starbucks, sportsbar, etc.  I stopped there every morning for coffee / breakfast on my 20 minute drive downtown in the morning and one evening on my way back for dinner.  I would gladly stay here again on a next trip.  Thanks for the great experience!!"
3642289,17475822,2014-08-12,7184429,Olivia,"We had a great  stay here.  Angela was very easy to communicate with and offered great tips on fun places to go in the area.  The room was very comfortable, with an attached bathroom (fully stocked with toiletries in case you forget to bring something) and some snacks and coffee in the room.  I would definitely recommend staying here. "
3642289,17596407,2014-08-14,4232551,Katelynne,"Amazing stay with Angela and her family! Everyone was welcoming including the pooches. Everything was as advertised, and actually better. Snacks in the room, list of activities to do and to get around, zucchini bread that rocked...amazing. We drove and left out car there and we never felt unsafe about that. House was secure too. It is incredibly close to downtown transit and in a pinch it was only 20$ to can home. Great experience would stay here again if I was back in Seattle!"
3642289,17660135,2014-08-15,3833602,Daniel,"We didn't see Angela cause we had to get the early flight. But her husband is really really nice and gave us a lot of information. 
The house of Angela is a really great place to stay ! 
The bedroom is really nice and the bed is so comfortable. 
The house is clean and well decorated. 
I do recommand this place to who need to stay in Seattle. "
3642289,17876820,2014-08-18,6677164,Dianne,"Angela and Harrison's home was a great place for us during our 3 night/4 day stay. One of the first things I noticed was the sweet ""Welcome Dianne"" sign, along with their airbnb logo, on the board outside of our room. Their house is super cute and their neighborhood has plenty to offer; nearby restaurants, the PCC (coop market), Caffe Vita, and others - especially, Seward Park - it's a must! They are a close drive or a quick bus ride to downtown. Their children are a treat to have conversations with and I suggest you take a look at the biology slides! Their pets are also adorable and sweet as can be. As for the bedroom, it was just as the photo showed and even more with premium snacks, coffee/tea, homemade (!) zucchini bread (soo good), and extra toiletries. The bathroom is private and a good size. If you rent a car, though not needed, there is plenty of free, street parking. All in all, this lively house is a great place to stay and we definitely recommend it. Thank you again, Angela, if we find ourselves needing a place in Seattle in the future we will happily stay here again!"
3642289,17989015,2014-08-19,15285844,Luke,"Harrison and Angela were great hosts on my road trip. Not only are they friendly but very talkative and sweet. The room was great with an attached full bath. They had snacks, coffee, towels, and bath supplies available. 
They do have two sweet dogs and two awesome smart kids who will warm your heart. 
The house is in a safe section with included parking.

The best part about the stay was feeling very comfortable and feeling like I was being hosted. They know there way around the city and helped me on my way to get into a trouble one night. Overall a great experience and I'm glad I met these guys. 
Seattle is wonderful and my stay here was great, I'd definitively come back."
3642289,18094131,2014-08-21,20018407,Greg,"Angela was great and very knowledgeable about the area. Check-in was very easy and we communicated via text prior to arriving which was helpful.  The bathroom was very nice with a big shower and good linens and the room was small but fit our needs just fine.  Angela’s kids and dogs were very quiet and we did not even notice them unless we had the door open and they happened to walk by.  

Overall it was a very good experience."
3642289,18159585,2014-08-22,20324665,Christy,"Angela and Harrison were very friendly and welcoming.  They were incredibly prompt with replies to our inquiries.  They also had written instructions at various spots in the room which was helpful.   Their suggestions on using the light rail  were also appreciated.  The room was perfect as it allowed total privacy, yet was just outside the kitchen when we were ready to meet them.  Their family and pets were all well behaved and a true pleasure.    Snacks were so appreciated as was the coffee maker. The bed was comfortable and we had no difficulty falling asleep. This was our 1st airbnb experience and everything went well."
3642289,18217198,2014-08-23,20244934,Kaylen,I had such a wonderful experience at the home of Angela and Harrison! They made me feel so welcome upon arrival. I loved all the personal touches such as the welcome sign and the snacks and beverages provided; especially the delicious zucchini bread! They also provided useful information for how to best get around the city as well as a list of activities. I will definitely stay again sometime and recommend to friends for a relaxing stay in Seattle!
3642289,18631439,2014-08-29,1499027,James,"Angela & Harrison are awesome. So welcoming/accommodating and flexible. This was the first time I stayed in a private room and didn't rent and entire place from AirBNB and the experience couldn't have gone better. The room is clean, quiet and comfy. The on-suite bathroom is large and the way the house is set up it's almost like its own little unit. If you are looking for a good experience with great hosts...look no further. Hope I can stay here again on my next business trip! Thanks guys!"
3642289,18742109,2014-08-31,19478845,Jeff,Angela's place was very comforting & inviting. She provided many useful information around the neighborhood (and a dummy guide too!).  We were able to grab things we needed from grocery store nearby. The house was exactly like how it was described on the listing. I'd definitely recommend her place for anyone that wants to spend some time in Seattle.
3642289,19042698,2014-09-05,20116498,Tammy,"Angela and Harrison were very friendly and accommodating. My boyfriend and I arrived late in the night after a long drive and they were able to arrange with us for the keys ahead of time. They left really thoughtful post-its around the room and bathroom, which made us feel very welcome on our one-night stay.

They were very thoughtful in providing snacks, water, a coffee pot, tea, toiletries, towels, and extra blankets. They even provided zucchini bread, which I had never tried before, but it was delicious! They're really great hosts, and they also have the most well-behaved dogs I've ever met. I would definitely recommend."
3642289,19331262,2014-09-10,15603870,Cheryl,"We had a nice stay at Angela and Harrison's house!  It's just as described as in the listing and the toiletries provided were a lifesaver.  We really appreciated the coffee, tea, and snacks provided.  We have two kids and one is only 21 months old and Angela graciously provided us with a pack n play for him to sleep in.  Overall a wonderful experience!"
3642289,21035674,2014-10-10,15944167,Suzann,"Thanks everyone for the wonderful stay, you were fantastic hosts! I stayed for a month while getting my house ready for sell. It was so comfortable, great area, great people. Yummy Zucchini bread! It was a lovely way to spend a stressful month - a respite away from it all in their beautiful sun filled home. With lots of fun and love going on - great kids of the 2 and 4 legged variety. A happy house! Highly recommended."
3642289,21824411,2014-10-25,17420207,Sandra,"My parents stayed with Angela and Harrison while they were visiting from overseas. They enjoyed the friendly family atmosphere, attentive hosts, and the bright and clean room with a very comfortable bed. :) Walking distance to amazing coffee shop and evening entertainment. Ready access to public transportation. Nice area of town for day-time strolls."
3642289,22485994,2014-11-08,14771482,Todd,My father and my brother stayed at the house.  They both said it was great.
3642289,24014265,2014-12-16,16759460,Gundars,"We very much enjoyed our stay with Angela and Harrison, their children, friendly dogs and cat.  They make you feel welcome yet
you have privacy, and it is easy to come and go as the room and bathroom are right at the front of the house as you enter.  We appreciated the little touches, especially the little refrigerator with
yogurt as well as the coffee maker, coffee, and the granola and other snacks.  And the bed was very comfortable!"
3642289,24291069,2014-12-24,22285021,Andrew,"Angela's guest room is one of the best I've stayed in. It has a large bed, is warm, and has its own private bathroom. There are tons of amenities, including a little guide to the Seattle metro area, which, as a native Washingtonian, I liked because it encourages guests to check out some rural areas (like North Bend) that they might not consider otherwise. The house is pretty close to Columbia City's entertainment drag which has great bars and restaurants. It's also a couple blocks from Rainier Ave which gives you access to grocery stores and a less congested route to downtown/Capitol Hill/etc than I-5. Angela and her family were very kind and it was nice to stay in a home rather than just a house. I highly recommend this bnb to anyone visiting Seattle. South Seattle is much more working class than the rest of the city and I think anyone looking to stay somewhere less touristy would love it here."
3642289,24314011,2014-12-25,16400208,Ching,The independent room is really cozy. The equipment and EVERYTHING I the room are thoughtful and wonderful. The hosts are very nice and friendly.
3642289,24795719,2015-01-02,25286034,Azucena,"It was such a pleasant surprise to see all that was left for us in our room upon our arrive and all the thoughtfulness that had gone in on elaborating their welcome sheet. I felt like home when I saw their welcome message on the black board. The room was also quite astounding and, also, very cozy. They really do have have everything in place to become a autodidact of Seattle and wanting to see all of the places it has. Also, it felt great to be confided in, even though they have a beautiful family!"
3642289,25225341,2015-01-09,5908682,Tanja,"Angela and her family where great host's! The room was big and clean, same as the private bathroom we had wich had everything we needed and a bit more "
3642289,25702980,2015-01-23,25048062,Chaya,"It was like coming home to your own home when I arrived at Angela's home. The neighborhood was very safe and as a matter of fact the neighbors too were very friendly.
The house is very cozy and especially the room and bath where I stayed had everything I needed for the 8 days that I spent there. It was a very comfortable and enjoyable place to be, much better than an five star- expensive hotel.
"
3642289,26020774,2015-02-01,26128569,Sally,"Hello - this was our first airbnb experience, and we were very happy with it.  The room was pleasant and comfortable, and our hosts made us feel welcome. We really enjoyed the 'lively' family, it was fun to meet their children and pets and we felt right at home.  The neighborhood is quiet and nice, and walking distance to the Seward park.  Thank you to Angela and Harrison for sharing their home with us, we had a great weekend.  "
3642289,26080521,2015-02-02,764531,Mike,"Thanks for hosting us, it was a pleasure to stay at your place."
3642289,26368056,2015-02-10,26561649,Tereza,"Angela and her husband are realy nice person! The room is amazing, big bed, beautiful bathroom, small snack, tea, coffee! It was perfect time there! :) I could't choose better!!!! Thank you Angela! "
3642289,26807392,2015-02-19,17732863,Jessie,"The room was very comfortable (especially the bed) and described accurately. There were many nice touches including coffee, tea, and misc. toiletries. Angela was very accommodating with our arrival time and her instructions and communication was very clear and welcoming. We enjoyed our trip all the more for having such a nice place to stay."
3642289,27378482,2015-03-02,16688838,Nadia,"My husband and I stayed one night at Angela's place during our trip to Seattle. Angela was very flexible on check in and out. Her communication with us upon and after arriving was fast and easy.  Her place is easy to find. The room is cozy and comfortable, stuffed with everything you need in travel. We used her kitchen in the morning to cook our breakfast, which was very convenient for hungry people. Definitely will stay with her again."
3642289,27840677,2015-03-13,223726,Maria,"Very nice couple with 2 great kids! They were all very friendly and gave us helpful tips for our days in Seattle. Perfect place for us, would repeat!"
3642289,28575434,2015-03-26,27743967,Jacob,"Angela, Harrison, and family were awesome. The room was set up and everything I needed was there. The bed was extremely comfy and the shower was amazing. If you are looking for a warm and friendly place to stay, I would recommend their place. "
3642289,28640876,2015-03-27,24358406,Ivanna,Angela and her husband were very kind and welcoming! Had a wonderful time and would definitely stay again :)
3642289,28722065,2015-03-29,9432768,Cydnea,"My husband and I were very happy with our stay in Angela and Harrisons home. Their house is lovely, and they were incredibly welcoming and accommodating.  We were grateful to find a place that allowed us to bring our dogs. The room has everything you could need and more and the bed was super cozy. We would definetly stay here again and recommend it to our friends. 
Thanks for everything! "
3642289,28989291,2015-04-02,12484972,Tony,Great location and lovely family. I'd stay there again.
3642289,31656735,2015-05-08,28833177,Karen,Angela and Harrison were great hosts to my Mom when she stayed at their house to help me with my new baby. They are lovely people and offered a clean comfortable room. The house was quiet (at least during evening and night hours when my mom was there) and she enjoyed venturing out to nearby Seward Park. 
3642289,34188848,2015-06-06,8093111,Kristen,"My mom stayed with Angela & Harrison and had this to say:

""I recently stayed almost 4 wks at Angela & Harrison's place. It was exactly what I needed in every way. Angela's attention to detail & anticipation of what 'might' be needed was appreciated, for example: Q-tips, snacks, etc. Bed so comfortable, pillows great, & a super soft cuddly blanket. Easy access to bus line. Wonderful, friendly & gracious young couple with 2 adorable kids, 2 friendly dogs, & an outdoor cat who should be in pictures. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"""
3642289,35073669,2015-06-15,13581325,Mark,I was very pleased with my rental everything was as described and I would highly recommend it
3642289,35281193,2015-06-16,34664227,Rebecca,"Everything was perfect! Well appointed room, quiet and cozy, everything you could need, right down to the mini fridge. :-) Very welcoming. Angela and family were genuine hosts, I enjoyed speaking w/ Angela and her Husband, they were attentive and helpful. "
3642289,35505952,2015-06-19,2893334,Karen,"We arrived to an open door and family at home, welcoming us in.  The listing description was accurate - very comfortable and well-supplied space for 2 (a few snacks, dishware, small fridge, coffee & tea, toiletries, etc.).  The kitchen/dining room were available to us, though didn't feel we needed it except to wash a few dishes.  Angela & Harrison provided helpful information and directions for accessing public transportation and getting where we wanted to go; and, their children were delightful.  A bus stop is just a few blocks from the house (the #7 bus takes you right into downtown), and a PCC Natural Food Store is an easy walk away.  Super convenient!  The house/space and location were PERFECT for our needs!  Would stay there again in a heartbeat!"
3642289,36671353,2015-06-30,30617354,지은,Angela and her family are very friendly!! And this room is much more wonderful than the pictures~ I had a great time
3642289,37169806,2015-07-05,11886819,Petrina,"Beautiful home with a gorgeous dog safe yard. Great location, only about 15 minutes from Downtown Seattle and 20 minutes from Sea-Tac, restaurants and a dog park very near by. Small but we'll appointed room. The dogs loved playing around the yard."
3642289,37899996,2015-07-11,34140788,Rich,"Our stay with Angela was perfect for our needs. She provided plenty of tips and info for exploring Seattle and the surrounding area.  Public transportation was available very close by and downtown Seattle was an easy drive.

The room was great as it has it's own attached bathroom and had a very private feel to it.  Dogs and children live in this house which was no problem for us. All were very well behaved. 

Angela was very nice and helpful. I had several questions about getting around Seattle and dining options. She was a wealth of info."
3642289,38693587,2015-07-18,25663939,Vickie,"Angela and family were very gracious and very friendly.  A wonderful host family. They were very quiet, which I did not expect with two active children.  Angela had yogurt, coffee and granola bars for a quick breakfast, which was a welcomed surprise.  The location was perfect for me.  Love the Columbia city shopping area.  The room is perfect for one person.  I truly enjoyed my stay.  Would highly recommend to others, and I am looking forward to my next trip to Seattle and stay with the Clements."
3642289,39332075,2015-07-22,3268464,Julia,"The moment we stepped into Angela's house, we felt at home. From the welcome sign next to our bedroom door to the thoughtful extra touches (a fully stocked medicine cabinet, tea + coffee w/ hot water kettle). Angela and her family were very hospitable and extremely helpful in making sure we had everything we needed and giving recommendations on where to go/eat. The house itself is spacious and warm, and the room felt enough removed to have our own space. An added highlight was Chevy, the dog who would greet us every night upon our return. The location was very central and close to public transportation, restaurants, supermarket and only a short drive to downtown Seattle. Highly recommended!"

3642289,39777372,2015-07-26,35418658,Caitlin,"Angela was a lovely host during our time in Seattle. While we didn't see her much, she was quick to make everything as easy and accessible as possible. Her home was quite welcoming, and one would never know that it also came with two young children and two dogs!"
3642289,41213098,2015-08-05,7199287,David And Virginia,"Angela and her husband, Harrison, were very welcoming and helpful. We enjoyed their home and the accommodations plus the nice yard and garden. They are very close to downtown Columbia City which is a very nice commercial area and close to public transportation to downtown and to the airport. We stayed a week and enjoyed it all."
3642289,41453734,2015-08-07,14343118,Colece,"Angela was an excellent host. She is very friendly and helpful. The room was perfect. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was well stocked and clean. 
The location was great. Seaward Park was so beautiful, you have to check it out. Downtown wasn't far either, we took the light rail which was fast and we didn't have to worry about parking.
Overall, great room and location. We would definitely stay here again. "
3642289,41647964,2015-08-08,36311103,Pallavi,"My parents stayed for a night, they had nice time. Angela is very helpful and approachable !!"
3642289,41753362,2015-08-09,4567440,David,"Angela was very welcoming and we had a really nice chat in the morning before we left. She didn't have a guest coming in that day so she told us we could hang out or leave our baggage if we wanted. Very flexible and gave great advice for places to go! Highly recommend staying here if you don't mind a couple of cute kids and dogs in the house. The room and bathroom are totally private, clean and comfortable. "
3642289,42898187,2015-08-16,24765012,Juliette,"A lovely stay!  The neighborhood is charming, and walking around Seward Park at sunrise was a major treat."
3642289,44187641,2015-08-24,40404050,Jenna,"Cute house, and Angela's dogs were more than happy to snuggle with us while we read. Thanks for hosting us!"
3642289,44576714,2015-08-27,39862887,Andrew,I had a wonderful stay and would recommend staying here. Room was clean and had very comfortable bed as well. Small snacks were provided in the room and anything else you needed. 
3642289,44745712,2015-08-28,40990567,Steven,Great place and Angela was really hospitable and helpful.
3642289,44839094,2015-08-29,6370421,Christov,Angela and her family are fantastic. Getting in and out was super easy.  Close to public transport. Definitely recommend staying here.
3642289,44948115,2015-08-30,13305528,Nathan,"A little bit of everything you need in terms of snacks and toiletries, and extra soft blankets. The private bath and location of the room make for a private atmosphere. "
3642289,45608422,2015-09-04,42168711,Jonathan,"Very clean and cozy, everything was just as advertised! "
3642289,46396039,2015-09-10,19386328,Emmette,"Angela and her family are amazing hosts, do yourself a favor and stay here! Their dogs and cats are great, plus the location is wonderful & bed is super comfy."
3642289,46568113,2015-09-11,27483614,Emily,"The best Airbnb stay I have had thus far! Super comfortable bed, everything you could ever need without having to bother asking your host, and in a quiet neighborhood. I will most definitely stay here again!"
3642289,46628618,2015-09-12,42075319,Joel,"Lovely house and family! We enjoyed our short stay here, wish we could have spent more time. "
3642289,46774646,2015-09-13,32214159,Levi,"Although we weren't able to meet Angela and her family we had a great experience. The room was clean, well organized and had a conveniently connected bathroom. We'd recommend this space to anyone staying in the area!"
3642289,47012105,2015-09-14,979350,Laura,A lovely experience at a delightful house with lovely folks. Great neighborhood too. All around an excellent experience.  Seamless entry and wonderful materials. Great coffee too. Thanks Angela!
3642289,47726572,2015-09-21,35014132,Tamara,"All the amenities one could ever need. Ground coffee, coffee maker and own bathroom. Very nice hosts, children and dogs! "
3642289,48297989,2015-09-25,27924144,Yin,Angela's house is not far away from Tacoma airport and is easy to locate. The bed is so cozy and give us a good rest especially after a 11-hour's flying. The room is supplement with everything you need. Thanks for the home-like feeling.
3642289,48487299,2015-09-26,44355150,Joyce,"Angela and her husband is kind, they provide some useful information, such as neighborhood situation and room  introduction through a hard copy document by heart. The room is clean and it is the same as described as host provided.  "
3642289,48596273,2015-09-27,29446527,Jeff,"We spent a night at Angela's home for one weary night after my brothers wedding. A great location close to Georgetown. Perfect room for what we wanted. It was private and had everything we needed, including an attached bathroom with mini fridge, microwave, and coffee maker! Perfect little home away from home. There dogs and cats were quite welcoming as well.  "
3642289,49094744,2015-10-01,32984390,Beth,"My arrival was as pleasant as it could be!  I just loved all the little signs in the room -- how to find the coffee, where the wash machine is, where to plug in the hairdryer, etc. The children and pets were pleasant and quiet -- I never heard a thing except when I was speaking to them."
3642289,49239679,2015-10-02,36826100,Jason,Angela and Harrison are great hosts and live  in a quaint urban neighborhood with a great bar and brewery nearby. I personally enjoyed the front yard gardens and appreciated how Harrison took the time to help us plan our day all while he was getting himself and his family ready for work and school. It felt like we were staying with friends--much better than being in a hotel. 
3642289,49795486,2015-10-06,42773444,Thor,"A great spot - just as advertised, and well-deserving of all the good reviews!"
3642289,50660724,2015-10-13,11775808,Jenny,"Angela's place is whimsical and charming! Bed is so comfy and all the travel info provided is super useful. The room feels private and Columbia City is not far and I loved the diversity of the neighborhood; great food was easy to find. Public transportation was a breeze to access and use - we easily made it to downtown and UW campus in good time! Overall, would definitely return and recommend!"
3642289,53531498,2015-11-09,47467743,Patience,"This space could not have been more convenient for my purposes in being in Seattle for 4 days to teach a workshop that (coincidentally, as I did not use a city map when booking but just the nearness of Seward park) was just a few blocks away!  I was dog tired at night & slept like a baby & even enjoyed a hot bath w/ bath salts, that's how clean the bathtub was!!  Would definitely stay there again some day, lots of thoughtfulness is devoted to making the lodger comfy~~"
3642289,56248398,2015-12-11,46683617,Meaza,"I stayed with the Clement family for a month. I was relocating and needed a temporary place to stay with my dog while I searched for a job. My stay was more than I could have asked for! Angela and Harrison are such a cool couple and have two adorable kids. They also have two lovable dogs that became best buds with mine. I miss walking in and having the three dogs greet me at the door. 

Everything that was mentioned in the previous reviews (e.g. notes, recommendations on places to check out, cute neighborhood, etc.) are all true. They even helped me move a couch into my new apartment. I'm so happy I was able to start my experience in Seattle with this family! 

"
3642289,56834617,2015-12-18,13120075,Alan And Michelle,"We thoroughly enjoyed meeting Angela and her family.  They quickly made up feel right at home.  Moreover, Angela helped us manage two different reservation mistakes (our fault) with kindness and grace.

Angela's house is in a location convenient to downtown Columbia City and beautiful Seward Park.  We located a good coffee shop on Ranier just 3 blocks or so from the house.  The accommodations were simple (one small bedroom and an ample private bathroom) and comfortable for the two of us.  We entered via a common foyer and found their programmed front door lock to be easy to manage.  Angela's two dogs and cat were very well-mannered an not obtrusive."
3424114,16261190,2014-07-24,16597681,Joseph,"I loved staying at the Lake Union Hacker House and would definitely stay there again. I mean, it's right on the freaking (email hidden)riously. You can sit on the porch and stare at the waves while eating breakfast. Everyone who I met at Hacker House was a complete pleasure, and I walk away with memories of late night chats about everything from brain imaging and evolution to programming and virtual reality. Think of it as a hostel for your fellow science/tech nerds. The University of Washington is a pleasant 30 minute walk from the house, which was great for the short course I was taking there. As everyone else has said, Matt is glorious, gregarious house manager. "
3424114,16921328,2014-08-04,17717276,Sam,Had a great time at the new Northlake Hacker Mansion and met lots of cool and interesting people. Definitely Reccomend.
3424114,18193857,2014-08-23,451108,Mykola,"The location and price were fantastic. I'm less sold in the 'hacker house' concept - felt more like a sparsely populated hostel for the two weeks I was there, but I'm not complaining. There is wifi, there are plenty of places to sit down and work. 

The other guests were a mixed bag if interests, but some were fellow coders with interesting tech things to talk about and others less so. Mostly, though, people seemed to crash here and work elsewhere. 

The rooms, well, they're not great. The beds feel kinda cheap, and as a big guy sleeping on the top bunk for my first week I felt a bit nervous about the bed's structural integrity. It held, though. 

I will say, though, that four people in such a small room is pretty optimistic. No air conditioner and lots of bodies meant that warmer nights were a but challenging. 

Still, great price and great location. I recommend getting a car2go card in advance if your trip if you don't have one, because that was such an easy way to get around. You're within walking distance of gas works park, too, which is awesome. "
3424114,18642371,2014-08-29,2054154,Irina,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6793490,38630982,2015-07-17,31615936,Eunjung,He is so friendly. I was first guest at the house. The house is awesome. Everything is new and nice. The location is good. The house is the best in airbnb that I stayed. I hope to stay again. I was satisfied so much.
6793490,39217137,2015-07-21,10417768,Steve,"The host was responsive and easy to reach.  They house was small but not too much so.  They had a bed and a futon that made it so that up to 4 adults could sleep comfortably.

The house was close to downtown, the airport, and the other neighborhoods in Seattle making it a great location.  The neighborhood was quiet and that was nice for a restful place to stay.

The bed was a sponge mattress which was a little soft to my liking, but I know many will appreciate it's coziness.  Both the futon and the bed were comfortable.

Biggest drawback was there is no AC.  There are fans and a decent breeze.  Since most of the day we were out exploring this was not a major issue but something to be aware of.

So for the short version.  I would stay here again as the house is a charming small but not tiny house located close to everything in Seattle.  Accommodations are well suited and the hosts are easy to communicate with."
6793490,39662237,2015-07-25,36651498,Bryan,"Great location, house, and host. Rob quickly responded to all of our messages. The house was clean and modern. Highly recommended."
6793490,40110693,2015-07-28,547538,New,Place was great for a couple of nights in Seattle.  Perfect location for a short walk over to the LINK to get to the stadiums or downtown.  Listing was accurately described and check-in/check-out process was easy and efficient.
6793490,40461710,2015-07-31,35929265,Christopher,"The house was wonderful.  I love the fact the house was provided with dishes, cookware, and fridge.  I would have loved to see a microwave.  The second floor where the bedroom is can become very stuffy and hot as the day progresses.  The fans definitely helped.  The bathroom was a little small and lacked counter space or a shelf to place our toiletries.  We did not get the chance to meet the hosts but the check in process was easy."
6793490,40929789,2015-08-03,35636021,Jackie,It was easy working with Lori & Rob for are stay. If we had any question they got back with us right way. That house was as they described. Very clean  and we love are stay and the neighborhood. Would recommend it to anyone and would stay again.
6793490,41383918,2015-08-07,33045735,Gabriel,"This little house was exactly what we were looking for! The house itself is cozy with all the amenities you need. The location is extremely convenient, in a residential neighbourhood only a few light rail stops from downtown. We didn't get to meet Lori and Rob, but they were very responsive to texts (including a locked bathroom door situation we had which was quickly resolved). The self check-in and check-out are very well organized. We highly recommend this place!"
6793490,41650255,2015-08-08,7031463,Shuo,"We were pleasantly surprised with our stay at the back house. The location was perfect, very close to everything. The apartment was very clean and neat. We had plenty of room for our family (2 adults 2 young kids) parking was extremely convenient. Check in check out process was very simple. I would definitely stay there again!"
6793490,42274003,2015-08-12,25517372,Anita,"This home has been recently and nicely updated and offered us great privacy within a few miles of downtown Seattle.  It's in an older neighborhood and basically situated on an alley so the views aren't great, but having a 2 story house to yourself is fabulous.  I would note that this neighborhood is also in a flight path for the airport and you may be awakened by the planes overhead in the early morning as we were.

Rob responded to my texts/questions promptly. I would stay here again!"
6793490,42542208,2015-08-14,32770626,Jessica,This house was so clean and welcoming.  It was just the right amount of space for our family of four!  The hosts were helpful and friendly! 
6793490,43262863,2015-08-18,38262251,Rachel,I had an amazing stay at Lori and Rob's place in Beacon Hill. The house was impeccably clean and very spacious. Check-in was very convenient. The neighborhood is safe (with friendly neighbors too!) and the house is a quick walk to the rail to downtown. I would love to stay here again!
6793490,43801327,2015-08-22,32351729,Abbie,"This house was perfect for our little family. Rob was so helpful all the details for an easy check-in/check-out process. All the amenities that were provided were just what we need for our weekend stay. The location was great, neighborhood was very quiet and a short walking distance to the local market and a few shops. We didn’t rent a car during our stay so the proximity to the light rail was perfect with it being just a 6-7 min walk to the Beacon Hill Station and then a quick 15-20 ride into downtown Seattle. Definitely a great little place to stay for our next visit to Seattle."
6793490,44320388,2015-08-25,7810817,Kirk,"We had an amazing experience staying with Rob & Lori in Seattle!  The space was clean, very inviting, secluded, and very close to downtown.  It was everything we were looking for.  We plan on going back in the future and will definitely try to use this house."
6793490,44792553,2015-08-29,32191017,Alexandra,"Amazing location! If you are primarily visiting Seattle a car is not necessary if this cottage is available. You can take the train from the airport to the Beacon Hill stop and from there into town. Should you find yourself having too much fun and don't make the last train, then Über X was only $12.

I really appreciate the bottled water and emergency coffee stash left in the cabinet.  The grocery store is next to the train stop and easy to walk to for extras. The bed upstairs is crazy comfortable with amazing pillows and the shower was huge!

Just book it! The train platform is underground so it's not like it is inconvenient to take public transport!"
6793490,45078804,2015-08-31,35629558,Bryan,A very clean and quaint space newly renovated and in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance to the light rail station. Lori and Rob were great hosts. They were extremely accommodating in letting us drop off our bags at the house prior to check in so that we could get right to exploring the city. We enjoyed our stay and will definitely keep this rental in mind for our next visit!
6793490,45403668,2015-09-02,840184,Dan,"This is a lovely home, in a great location.  Rob and Lori were great hosts, giving us information in a really clear and timely fashion."
6793490,45601258,2015-09-04,15791425,Hannah,Rob and Lori are great! Their place was beautiful and very clean. They were very easy to communicate with and were super polite. I would highly recommend their place! 
6793490,46386978,2015-09-10,30741282,Gabe,"This house was great! The place was super clean and tidy, and Lori and Rob were extremely easy to reach and accommodating. I would absolutely stay here again in the future. "
6793490,47331400,2015-09-17,9129697,Daniel,"Rob was very accommodating and accepted a booking at the last minute. Also was helpful in allowing us to drop our bags prior to check in so we could visit the city.  Stand up fellow.

House was clean and well laid out for a short stay. An affordable gem in a pleasant Seattle neighbourhood. Easy access to the light rail station making for easy access to downtown and the airport. Good grocery store a short walk away. Highly recommended."
6793490,47749131,2015-09-21,41951630,Jennifer,My husband and I stayed at this charming home for our mini vacation. There are large windows and even a fire place! Its conveniently located 15 minutes from all the tourist spots. It was a very easy check-in and check out. 
6793490,48877037,2015-09-29,38163482,Jacob,"Rob was incredibly nice and accommodating from the get go. The location of their beautiful place couldn't be more convenient for getting pretty much anywhere you want to go on the train. If you are looking for a place to stay in Seattle, this is it. "
6793490,49139538,2015-10-01,18334314,Dylan,Staying up at Lori and Rob's place was perfect for my trip. It was very easy to come and go and the location was great. Rob was great at communicating the ins and outs and even let me check in a little bit early which was a huge help. The space was very clean and everything was exactly as advertised. This will definitely be a consideration for me on future trips to Seattle.
6793490,49375845,2015-10-03,15107570,Marian,"My husband, son and I stayed at Lori and Rob's for two nights and really enjoyed our stay there. It exceeded our expectations. All of our communication was managed through text messages which was fine. Rob was very prompt at returning text messages. The cottage was cozy but provided ample space. The neighborhood was quiet and we felt safe walking around. The cottage is fairly proximate to downtown and other tourist destinations. We would surely stay there again. Loved it!"
6793490,50195706,2015-10-10,40497712,Christina,"This was a nice little two-floor house with all the amenities and independent entrance . The neighborhood is nice and quiet, is close to the Link Rail Beacon Hill Station (.5 mile), and takes just 10 minutes to get at the Pioneer Station in Seattle. There is a supermarket a few blocks from the house. I never spoke to or saw the owners."
6793490,54233674,2015-11-17,41164532,Ellena,"This house was very quaint but spacious for two! Really enjoyed the cleanliness and amenities provided. Rob was very accommodating with the check in time. The best part was definitely the bed, very very comfortable!The neighborhood is very quiet and comfortable and we enjoyed being on the porch. The only thing that was a drag was the tv service was going in and out, just a few channels to choose from. But otherwise thank you Lori and Rob for the amazing house and the opportunity to stay in Seattle! Definitely coming back! "
6793490,55116909,2015-11-28,17621491,Erin,"Great spot!  It has everything you would need in an apartment and everything is very clean.  The floors felt very cold, because you can only use space heaters.   Bring slippers and you will totally be fine!  The owners also provide a few ikea slippers, but we did not want to use communal slippers.  Otherwise, this place is great!"
1110749,5148475,2013-06-15,4662173,Karianne,"The 6 of us had a really nice stay in Blairs house and everything was as described. It was clean and spacious with a fully equipped kitchen and nice outdoor areas. Blair was easy to communicate with and also left us good tips about the neighborhood, like restaurants and cafes."
1110749,5295813,2013-06-23,6436984,Salma,"the house is very nice and very charming, we picked raspberries, mint and rhubarb in the garden :)
Blair is very nice, responsive, and extremely easy to communicate with him, I recommend highly this house to all AIRBNB traveler
thank you Blair"
1110749,5806423,2013-07-17,654301,Ali,"The house is awesome, just the kind of place I'd want to live if I lived in Seattle. Plenty of space for everyone (we had 4 guests total) in just about the best location in town, with great restaurants and cafes nearby. Super quiet area, which my wife and I enjoyed, and very close to downtown (by car at least; we didn't attempt public transport this trip). We were lucky to have beautiful, sunny weather, so we sat out in the back yard one morning and just enjoyed coffee and conversation. Everything was very clean and tidy, and Blair made sure to check in with us and left us great guidebooks and instructions. I would definitely recommend a stay here, and if I'm back in Seattle I would stay here again."
1110749,6127160,2013-07-31,1352951,Mary Ann,"Blair was easy to communicate with and she also left a very good notebook on places to go and things to do in the neighborhood.  The house was clean, pleasantly decorated, light and airy, well-furnished, very comfortable, and nice.  There was plenty of room for 5 adults.  The yard was beautiful with many flowers that were in bloom. The house was also within a few blocks walking distance to a fantastic donut shop, an ice cream shop, and a pizza place.  "
1110749,6272214,2013-08-06,2721690,Christine,"We booked Blair's property after extensive research looking for a suitable place for 5 friends to meet & arriving from 3 different locations on the West Coast for an extended weekend in Seattle including attendance at a much-anticipated concert. This location appeared to be a perfect fit. And it was.

Our stay at Queen Anne between 2-4 Aug was everything we had hoped for. We all felt at HOME. The 3 queen-sized beds we all found very comfortable, and even though there is only one main bathroom, this was not a problem with careful scheduling between the 5 of us. Overall this home has a very nice feel from top to bottom.

We would stay again given the opportunity and most certainly would recommend this beautiful home to anyone looking for a comfortable, well-maintained and appointed home in one of Seattle's loveliest areas."
1110749,6583384,2013-08-18,2649244,Emily,"We had a great stay in Queen Anne. The house is in a lovely, quiet residential area, but within a few blocks of a great small market and a fabulous bakery. A little further in the other directions will take you to Trader Joes, cafes, and restaurants. The house itself was immaculately clean and comfortable with excellent mattresses on the beds, good lounging space downstairs, and a fenced backyard. The kitchen is well supplied and easy to work in and there's a large dining room table great for group meals. The only caution I would give is that the stairs are a little steep and there is no bathroom on the first floor so it could be a little challenging for someone with arthritic knees or similar. Queen Anne is a fairly large hill so, though the house is situated on a fairly level few blocks, walking further requires negotiating some significant inclines.  Otherwise a really wonderful place to stay. Blair, the host was welcoming, informative, and easy to reach when we had questions. He also provided a binder of maps and info about the neighborhood and the city that was very helpful. We did not rent a car on this trip and were able to get around pretty well using the bus that stops a few blocks from the house and the Zipcar which is about 6 blocks away. Highly recommended."
1110749,6682842,2013-08-21,5864312,Jen,"Spent two night in this beautiful home after arriving in Seattle on a very special trip.

Host was great, excellent communication and instructions on arrival as well as detailed directions from airport.

House is beautiful, with everything we needed for a wonderful but brief stay. Great beds, fab shower all you need in the kitchen and beautifully clean.

Location is good, nice neighbourhood good parking. Only thing to be aware of is if you want to walk to downtown, it's a little far. Recommend drive to Seattle Centre, park up and either walk or monorail to downtown. Seems to be plenty of public transport but we didn't use it due to limited time of visit.

Thoroughly recommend for any Seattle visit and a wonderful introduction to using Airbnb.
"
1110749,8792434,2013-11-18,5669109,Kerry,"We had a fantastic stay at Blair's lovely home! Queen Anne has become even more vibrant than the last time I was in Seattle just a few years ago and Blair's house is a short, pleasant walk away from the best of it - a toy store for the kiddies, El Diablo coffee for the big kids, great food (we headed straight for the 5 Spot), book shops, bakeries, and the legendary city view from Kerry Park. The house itself was clean, warm, and welcoming - the beds comfy, living and dining areas spacious and perfect for sharing cherished time with family and friends. I would recommend Blair's home and look forward to staying again the next time I'm in Seattle. "
1110749,9703713,2014-01-06,3177429,Lauren,"We loved staying in this house in Queen Anne! I booked this property for myself, my husband, our 6 month old daughter, and his family while we were in Seattle for a wedding. It was perfect.

Blair was kind to accommodate us with a last-minute early check-in, which was very gracious. The house slept 5 adults and 1 baby very comfortably. The heated floor in the bathroom was a real treat, and we took full advantage of the space in the kitchen on one of our evenings in by preparing a dinner of crab, halibut, and salad bought directly from Pikes Market. 

The house itself was clean, comfortable, and a quiet oasis for us when we needed a break from the festivities. It was close enough to downtown that we didn't feel inconvenienced, and far enough away from noise that we felt we were on vacation. We would be happy to stay here again."
1110749,10460147,2014-02-19,12015170,Mark,"Blair was super helpful! Had an emergency at my home and had to find a last minute place for 3 days. He got back to me immediately and maintained great contact when I had questions during stay. The house is really comfortable and only blocks away from some of my favorite restaurants! Easy street parking and a quiet neighborhood. Really loved the stay here and would do it again in a heartbeat! Clean home, comfortable beds and just felt relaxing and fun!"
1110749,10718083,2014-03-04,4249787,Gigi,"This home has character and is in a lovely neighborhood. Host was very responsive and very helpful with recommendations on nearby restaurants, etc. We hope to return to Seattle again soon! Would definitely rent from this host again!"
1110749,11138614,2014-03-22,9128324,DeWitt,"My family and I stayed at Blair's Queen Anne home in March and enjoyed the experience. We would certainly stay again.

The location is the best in the city, a short walk away from restaurants and shopping, with convenient access downtown or anywhere else you need to go.

Recently remodeled, the home is lovely, clean and perfectly equipped for a short or medium term stay. Washer and dryer in the basement, a full complement of appliances in the kitchen, and plentiful and comfortable bedding upstairs.

One thing to note is that it's street parking only, but as Blair explained in advance, parking is abundant and free on that block, and never did we have to park anywhere other than right outside the front door all week.

Some hiccups with the heat and the wifi, but nothing we weren't able to handle with Blair's immediate help.

I imagine we'll be back again on our next visit."
1110749,11231189,2014-03-25,5467797,Jen And Kyle," This house was perfect for our group of 5adults and 1 child. I don't think anyone wanted to leave. Coming and going was smooth and easy. The house was clean, comfortable and had everything we needed. We did not meet Blair personally but he was in touch and had all the info we needed all laid out for us at the house anyway. 
 Loved the neighbourhood. I took my four year old to the playground only two blocks away and we stopped in for a treat at a near-by bakery. It was lovely. "
1110749,11365366,2014-03-31,3128200,Christian,Place was great and neighborhood was really nice! We had a wonderful stay.
1110749,13614273,2014-06-01,1516983,Courtney,"Blair was awesome! He responded promptly and was so kind with our requests. My family loved the house and the location was just perfect. They loved waking up and walking to what I consider the best coffee, shop Fiore. 

Thanks Blair!"
1110749,14160655,2014-06-13,12272802,Karen,This house was a perfect place to spend the last few days with my in-laws before their flight back to England. We were three couples and we had plenty of room. The beds are very comfortable and there is plenty of closet space. It was an easy walk to the bus stop which made getting downtown very convenient.  We found the full bath upstairs perfectly adequate for our stay. It was perfect weather and we enjoyed sitting in the backyard. One of the things we appreciated most was eating our meals together around a large dining room table. It felt like home and we had a lovely experience. 
1110749,14602676,2014-06-23,12988839,Mona,"the host was great. sent us the access instructions well ahead of time, was fairly responsive in answering any questions we had.

the home was cute and fairly clean. we used the kitchen for at least 1 meal a day and it was super helpful. 

the neighborhood was the best part about this rental. a great children's park, cafes, restaurants and grocery stores are all easy walks from the home. it's also super easy to get to downtown.  "
1110749,14754244,2014-06-25,14331735,Erin,"A perfect stay, at a perfect place !. This house is beautiful and located in a trendy area of Seattle.  It is literally minutes from downtown and attractions. 

 The neighborhood is very quiet and after a busy day of sightseeing, its wonderful just get back and relax.  The house is laid out nicely and the heated bathroom floor is amazing.

Wake up and walk a couple blocks for fresh coffee and pastries.  You can even walk a couple more blocks and hit Trader Joe's for a little grocery shopping. 

This place is a must if your headed to Seattle with family or friends. We will absolutely stay here again."
1110749,14823034,2014-06-27,4077820,James,"An incredible location  - we were all so relaxed the moment we arrived - I cannot recommend highly enough. No problems, the perfect stay!"
1110749,14935302,2014-06-29,4154964,Chris,"This place was a little piece of heaven in the busy city of Seattle. It was off the beaten path yet totally accessible to everything we cared to do in town. The beds were incredibly comfortable, the house was very peaceful and quiet and we had every amenity we could ask for. Three of us stayed here and we had more room that we even needed. Blair was easy to communicate. The booking was super-simple and the check-in and out process was efficient. "
1110749,15033557,2014-07-01,13163896,Nick & Yvonna,"This place is amazing and cozy. It looks exactly like the posted photos. We had 6 people stayed in the house for 2 days and felt very roomy in the house. Great location, plenty of street parking. We love the garden! Blair was easy to communicate. There is one full bathroom in the second level and a half bathroom in the basement which we never used. With little coordination, we had no problem with that. "
1110749,15497790,2014-07-10,6538764,Sophie,"Our experience with Blair was excellent , quick and clear answers , the house was as charming as we expected  . One master room ,the 2 last more little , ( think about this if you share with other couples , one get a better choice then the others) clean and confortable .
Very calm area and that's right , near everything !
Taxis are not expencive in Seattle and for us that's what we used to go and come , you just have to call Yellow cabs .
We recomande this house with out any restriction if you like residential area !"
1110749,15555802,2014-07-11,1687064,Reggie,Me and a couple colleagues stayed on a quick overnight trip. The house was cozy and in a quiet neighborhood. And it's just a short drive to downtown. I'd recommend this place for any small family wanting to visit Seattle and stay at a quiet place close to the city.
1110749,15947906,2014-07-19,8180564,Ashlee,"We loved communicating with Blair and staying in her lovely home! At one point, we were playing a board game that required viewing a DVD. We couldn't find the remote and Blair offered to swing by and drop one off! You can't get more accommodating than that. "
1110749,16037102,2014-07-20,17845975,Karin,"Wonderful charming home in a beautiful quiet neighborhood!   This 3 bedroom home has everything you are looking for in a place to stay in Seattle - nicely stocked and updated kitchen, hardwood floors throughout, wonderfully decorated.   The house is is near bakeries, restaurants, parks.  The host is responsive and helpful.   Great place!"
1110749,16197452,2014-07-23,9504008,Jason,"We had a fantastic experience at this house. Very close to the upper Queen Anne shops and restaurants, and very close to a wonderful park where our kids had a thoroughly good time. "
1110749,16394708,2014-07-27,13205317,Rick,"My wife and I took our two children and their spouses for a short three night stay in Seattle and stayed at this property. The house was plenty spacious for the six of us plus our 9 month old granddaughter. Immediately on our arrival we were impressed with the house and the neighborhood. It is an older neighborhood in Seattle but the house and those around it are in beautiful condition. Blair was very accommodating giving suggestions for nearby places to eat and enjoy what Seattle has to offer. We loved that we were so close to everything in Seattle with either a short walk or a short drive to all of the main sights in Seattle. The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare multiple meals in the house when we did not want to go out. We also loved being able to walk to the nearby coffee shops, stores and restaurants. When we make it back to Seattle we will definitely want to stay at this great property."
1110749,16512319,2014-07-28,5182094,Kathleen,Blair was awesome! Directions and information about the place was on point. The house was well kept and super clean as well! Fantastic place for a family of 6! Thank you Blair for the pleasant experience! :) 
1110749,17122291,2014-08-07,13568423,Katie,"Great house, fabulous location! Thanks!"
1110749,18410698,2014-08-26,5862396,Gabe,Our family thoroughly enjoyed your home during our recent visit to Seattle. A great location - plenty of terrific restaurants in the Queen Anne district - even Trade Joe's! The back yard provided a nice hangout - the kitchen was well equipped. The 3 bedrooms worked perfectly for the 3 couples - all the beds were comfortable. Thanks for making your home available.
1110749,18574036,2014-08-28,19836724,Barry,"Lots of communication from Blair. Instructions were clear and concise. Queen Anne is an amazing neighborhood close to everything as the header states. Be aware that the streets are narrow and a bit tricky. House is clean and well kept. Blair even provided a local guidebook that had specifics on local restaurants, bars and such that was super helpful.
"
1110749,18873927,2014-09-02,7341463,Melanie,"The house was really great--and the neighborhood is beyond fantastic! We stayed there over Labor Day weekend (Thursday-Monday) with three adults and three young kids (a toddler, kindergartener and 2nd grader). We made good use of the Pack n' Play and high chair. Because we were coming from the East Coast and have early rising kids, they were up especially early most mornings. The TV doesn't have many channels, but we made use of the DVD  player in its place. The wifi worked flawlessly. Blair was a very responsive host--always answering my questions before our arrival within 24 hours. We wouldn't hesitate to stay there again!"
1110749,19060910,2014-09-05,8331643,Brian And Joy,"The house was wonderful and the beds in each of the 3 bedrooms were very comfortable.  The neighborhood is great and Blair was very easy to coordinate with.  

"
1110749,19190972,2014-09-08,16259441,Rebecca,This is a lovely house in a lovely neighborhood. All communication with the host was quick and easy. I would highly recommend this house for anyone staying in Seattle! 
1110749,19385323,2014-09-11,663803,Stephanie,The house was beautiful. Our host was very responsive to all our emails. Would definitely recommend this house to anyone looking to stay in Seattle. 
1110749,19463910,2014-09-13,16008611,Carla,Great location! Close to downtown and walking distance to cafes and restaurants in Queen Anne.  
1110749,19608340,2014-09-15,7988310,Shanna,"We had a group of six and stayed for two nights, and it was truly delightful. The house proved to be even better in person than the pictures showed, and was charming, well-appointed, and felt like home. The location was great--it was a quick cab ride to Belltown, Lake Union, Pike Place Market, the Space Needle, everywhere! Queen Anne is also a lovely neighborhood and has great restaurants and coffee shops. Blair is also very easy to communicate with, was understanding, and made our experience free of any stress. As another person mentioned, the home guide was quite helpful. I would certainly stay there again and recommend it to any and all! Thanks for a great stay, Blair!"
1110749,19798587,2014-09-18,20554788,Jen,"Directions were easy to follow and the home was lovely! Amazingly comfortable beds, beautiful kitchen, perfect amount of space for a girls trip away. We had rented a car and never had trouble finding parking right in front of the house. "
1110749,20011584,2014-09-22,18487676,Adam,"We decided to take a family vacation to Seattle with our two girls ages 2 and 4, and decided to use Airbnb for the first time. The house was very charming and perfect for our visit. The location is excellent, a short walk from great cafes and restaurants on Queen Anne Avenue, and a short drive to the Space Needle and other area attractions. Thanks Blair."
1110749,20251200,2014-09-26,20102939,Philip,"Great little house in a wonderful neighborhood. We felt right at home as soon as we checked in from the fresh berries and herbs in the back yard to the comfortable layout.   The house was clean, straight forward and well furnished and we LOVED the heated floors in the bathroom.   Thanks again for the great stay!"
1110749,20549000,2014-10-01,17018171,Selina,"We had a great stay at Blair's. It was nice and clean, and we had all the amenities needed. Blair was also extremely communicative, and was quick to respond to any queries that I had. 
I would definitely stay here again.
"
1110749,21196689,2014-10-13,15285166,Nicole,"Great place with very comfortable beds!!  Blaire was very accommodating and allowed us to have a late check out so that my bridesmaids and I could get ready for my big day together!  Thanks again, we had a blast.  The only thing that freaked me out was ""charlotte"" (the spider) who greeted us at the front door.  "
1110749,21330264,2014-10-14,867407,Jonathan,This is a great house in a very quiet neighborhood in the center of Seattle.  Very clean and functional.  The owner Blair is exceptionally accommodating. I highly recommend this house. My family and I felt at home.
1110749,21659930,2014-10-21,20776479,Meg,"This house was perfect for our family's visit to Seattle. Set on a quiet street in a fabulous neighborhood. We had our choice of delicious, local restaurants for all of our meals, plus fabulous ice cream all within walking distance. Easy to get transportation downtown. The host was very responsive to any inquiries and the house was clean and comfortable."
1110749,22304688,2014-11-03,18991891,Jenevive,The house is in a very central location on a quiet street in Seattle. Getting in and out of downtown was very easy! The house has lots of space and is extremely clean. I would highly recommend this place to anyone.
1110749,22435468,2014-11-06,21758441,Jess,"Listing was accurate. Beds were extremely comfortable. Cosy couches and living/dining room. Cute location, quiet - yet close to the shops and public transport for downtown. Great instructions and recommendations for local eating option. Heated floor in bathroom was amazing!! "
1110749,23016948,2014-11-20,22694568,Sarah,"We had high hopes for this house as a break from living in a construction site. It could not have failed more completely. The host forgot that I had made early check-in arrangements. The house was filthy.  The host said he cleaners would make it spotless (and when I called before going back to the house, he assured me it was spotless), it was a shock to find it dirty, smelly and almost unfit to inhabit. The surface dirt was removed the next day, but the home is old, the kitchen is poorly equipped with old, broken kitchen items and a stove that should be thrown out. The house smells, the upper master bedroom especially. We couldn't find the source of the smell, but I've had to wash all our clothes and take things to the dry cleaners to remove the stale, almost rotten smell, from our clothing. The furniture is old; the tv room couch is stained.  The throw blankets haven't been washed in a long time. The photos are misleading, the reviews can't be for this home.  I was very disappointed and would think twice before using AirBnB again."
1110749,23190464,2014-11-24,794705,Melody,"This Queen Anne house is very quaint and a great location.  I had a girl's retreat for 5 women.  The beds are comfy.  The main bathroom is upstairs with the bedrooms.  For 5 women it worked out ok, but we had to wait a few times:) We walked all over Queen Anne during our stay and loved how close the house was to everything."
1110749,23700352,2014-12-08,10864515,Lauren,"The house was wonderful - clean, warm, cozy.  It is walking distance to  all the cafes, pubs, and shops on Queen Anne Ave..  Blair was a great host.  "
1110749,23904908,2014-12-14,5014910,James,Great house! Great location! Highly recommended. 
1110749,25552848,2015-01-19,13642901,Christine,"The listing was very helpful with good pictures and reviews.  The neighborhood was well maintained, and close to Queen Anne shops (including a Trader Joe!).  It was a pretty long walk to downtown including a big hill, so we drove  part of the way where we could easily park and walked the rest of the way.  There is a wonderful walk, full of views, and a park about 5 blocks away which I really enjoyed.  The house was cozy and welcoming for our family gathering of 5 adults.  The front room was a lovely place to talk and hang out with big windows and comfy couches. The dining room has a big table- great for coming together at meals.
I had minimal contact with Blair, but enough to get the needed information.  I liked the independence, and everything was outlined clearly and worked well including the lock box for the keys.
A few draw backs I would have wanted to know: 
-There was really only one usable bathroom/shower at a time and we consistently ran out of hot water in the morning, even with brief showers.  
-The kitchen was not well stocked 
-It needs a deep cleaning for people like myself who feel most comfortable when things are very clean"
1110749,25643802,2015-01-21,6811235,Josiah,"The space was great. All three rooms very comfortably furnished, and we felt very at home. Love the neighborhood, so many great bars and coffee shops and restaurants within walking distance. Loved the experience!"
1110749,26042094,2015-02-02,8714095,Angela,"My girlfriends and I have a lovely weekend at Blair's adorable Queen Anne home. Everything was neat and tidy, the space has a lot of charm, and it's in a fantastic Upper Queen Anne location that's walkable to lots of coffee shops, restaurants, retail, etc. I'd go back!"
1110749,26371493,2015-02-10,24787767,Xiaoli,The living experience is so wonderful for us. It is convenient to go to the market and travel downtown. We do cooking in the house. Many seasonings are there in the kitchen. The house is warm and comfortable.    The host is so nice to help us with our problems.
1110749,29277585,2015-04-06,24660306,Renee,"House was great, perfect location, very clean, well furnished. Whole family had a great time. We had a small issue with the heating which Blair was very responsive to and were able to get it sorted during our stay. "
1110749,29908456,2015-04-14,16708587,Jill,Easy transaction.  We didn't need a lot of instruction as it was all very self-explanatory.
1110749,30805315,2015-04-27,2248314,Xiaoming,"The place is really cute and charming. The location is great if you would like to taste ""local"". It's really a nice neighborhood for dinning, bars and walking around. 

The heating in the house is not the best experience in the beginning. But I appreciate the host's attitude when we have a problem and no matter how late, we are going to fix it. Thanks for that. 

A good place to recommend for family stays and visits in Seattle. "
1110749,31998033,2015-05-12,32247610,Ewa,"Neighborhood was great - quiet and safe. 
The host was responsive and helpful. "
1110749,33427953,2015-05-28,21495181,Kay Louise,"The listing description was accurate, although  I expected more out of the ""bathroom"" in the basement.  It had a toilet but no sink with mirror.  I guess it was wishful thinking on my part.  Also, we did not expect to have a television with only 8 channels!  Blair was helpful in that the airline changed our flight time, resulting in an earlier arrival  than planned.  Blair let us drop our suitcases off at 1PM which allowed us to eat lunch and browse Main Street shops while waiting to check in at 3PM.   We loved the Queen Anne neighborhood.  The house was a convenient and beautiful  walk to restaurants and shops.  it was also close to downtown and tourist sites via Uber or taxi.   Neighborhood was very quiet.   "
1110749,34150144,2015-06-05,25829700,Dean,"Had a lovely stay!!  Situated in one of Seattle's nicest neighborhoods, this home is brimming with charm-- starting with the bucolic walkway to the front porch and continuing through the interiors with its tasteful furnishings.  The location is awesome and around the corner from Caffe Fiore, Top Pot Doughnuts and Molly Moon's Homemade Ice Cream, not to mention only a short 5-10 minute walk to Kerry Park (which has an amazing view of the Seattle skyline).  We actually made our way to the park twice during our stay!  The three upstairs bedrooms were comfortable, and the downstairs areas had enough space for six adults to relax and unwind.  It was definitely convenient to have a second toilet and sink available, but the main drawback was having to go down to the dark basement to use the half bath.  Not much privacy with only a curtain providing separation from the rest of the basement, plus it did not smell as if it had been freshened up before we arrived.  Despite a couple wear and tear issues like a broken microwave handle and a dining chair on its last legs (it would have fallen apart had we used it), I highly recommend this house.  We appreciated all the amenities, and especially enjoyed being able to prepare a family dinner one night.  Though Blair is hands-off for the most part, he was easily accessible during our arrival and helped us settle in smoothly by responding quickly to our concerns."
1110749,41054806,2015-08-04,2885353,Samantha,"My in-laws stayed in this house during our wedding weekend. They said it was great! I had a chance to visit the house while they were there and it was super nice, exactly as described. Blair was very accommodating and communicative in the months leading up to our reservation. "
1110749,44673727,2015-08-28,39756004,James,"This Seattle house was absolutely perfect for our family. Having 3 separate bedrooms was wonderful giving all of us some space to ourselves. The kitchen was well equipped and the sitting areas were comfortable. With fans in every room and cool nights we were very happy. Plus, with a yard, the kids were able to have some run-around time!! The neighborhood was darling with grocery, coffee, ice cream and restaurants nearby. It was a real treat to be so close to everything, but have a sanctuary away from the bustle of downtown."
1110749,45648412,2015-09-05,24720247,Andrew,Loved this house - only stayed a couple of nights but it's in a super-quiet neighbourhood that's conveniently located for everywhere including downtown.  Even went to the local Farmer's Market.
1110749,46093581,2015-09-07,8575076,Christina,"Great location, very walkable neighborhood, comfortable beds, easy checkin process"
1110749,47170329,2015-09-16,40515579,Denecia,We truly enjoyed this wonderful house. The neighborhood was extraordinary. My children loved playing on the front porch and the beautiful front yard that seemed like their own secret garden. The heated floors in the bathroom were amazing when it was a little chilly in the morning. The host was super helpful when we could not get the heater to work and responded quickly to our message. I really enjoyed the notebook that the host put together with all the places to visit within the neighborhood. We took advantage of her suggestions and visited several since they were within walking distance. 
1110749,49590257,2015-10-05,30219638,Katie,"Blair was incredibly helpful in meeting our grocery delivery and bringing things into the house before our late evening arrival. The home is beautiful! The location is perfect for a quiet, peaceful but still very central Seattle experience. The home was comfortable, furnishings, kitchen, linens, etc clean and all communication prior to arrival and in the guest book was welcoming. Thank you for a great Seattle experience!
PS- Top Pot Doughnuts are in walking distance!"
1110749,54608890,2015-11-22,33204234,James,"The house is lovely, I can't think of a single thing I would change about it. Comfortable beds / bedrooms, nice shower, great space downstairs to sit / watch tv and a fully functional kitchen.  Can't recommend this place highly enough and would like to think I will stay again when back in Seattle."
1110749,57051159,2015-12-21,27367140,Bryce,The house was so perfect for our family trip to Seattle. Comfortable and clean. The host had left plenty of information about the house and surrounding area.  It was great to have us all under one roof.
7381677,41014524,2015-08-03,38669680,Victoria,Michaela is a wonderful host. She had little nic nacs waiting for us when we got there. She made us feel so welcome and at home. Her place is very close to downtown and to all the major attractions. I will definitely come stay with her again. Thank you so much!
7381677,41475309,2015-08-07,658203,Neal,"Staying at Michaela's place was nothing short of perfect.  The location was ideal, and she made sure we were able to arrive whenever worked for us.  The place was extremely clean, and the outdoor sitting area with a view of downtown and the space needle was fantastic.  Very quiet, and the perfect place for a few days in Seattle. We were able to communicate with Michaela a few times during our stay, but did not need anything, as she had already set us up with all that we needed."
7381677,41686803,2015-08-08,6049164,Avery,This was an absolutely beautiful place to stay in Seattle! The apartment is gorgeous and Michaela is a wonderful host - she left treats for us and was very welcoming and gave great tips about the area. She also went the extra mile and gave us restaurant recommendations for our next destination after Seattle! We would definitely stay again. 
7381677,42031487,2015-08-10,12586598,Johnny,"Michaela's place is awesome. I booked her place for my parents' short stay in Seattle and they loved it. The view is as advertised and Michaela's hospitality can't be beat. My parents flew in really late and she was able to accommodate us. They loved the welcome package, especially after a day of travel. 

I would definitely book her place again when people visit Seattle. "
7381677,42324658,2015-08-12,32004166,Michael,"Beautiful home located in a safe and accessible area of Queen Anne.  Michaela and Sean did an amazing job of making us feel at home and making our stay in Seattle incredible. Would recommend to anyone looking for a clean, safe place to call home. Quick walk from numerous groceries, restaurants, bars, retail shops."
7381677,43539630,2015-08-20,1431100,Céline & Clément,"A very nice apartment, with a gorgeous design. Good location and perfect host! Would definitely come back here for my next stay."
7381677,45283651,2015-09-01,38709713,Jennifer,"We had an amazing 10-day vacation in Seattle. The flat was beautiful and the location can't be beat. It's so easily walkable to all of Queen Anne's cafes and restaurants and to the attractions at Seattle Center. We loved sitting outside on the patio and enjoying the gorgeous view. The apartment is so well stocked with all the basics plus lots of extras including spices, coffee, zip-locks, toiletries... she even leaves fresh eggs and jam waiting for you in the fridge. Michaela was so kind and accommodating. She really went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. She is quick to respond but also gives you your privacy. You'll feel like you have your own gorgeous, luxury apartment in the heart of the city!"
7381677,46307655,2015-09-09,3070546,Maurice,"The Host is the example of what AIRBNB should always be.  The depiction was more than accurate. Everything was perfect, perfect, perfect. The cupboards and the refrigerator were stuffed with very thoughtful items, and the outside patio area overlooks the Space Needle. The area is quiet and well located with a wonderful Thai restaurant, coffee shops and shopping within blocks. You could not ask for a better experience. I would never consider staying anywhere else in Seattle and would love to have been able to stay longer...we were there for a week. "
7381677,47688610,2015-09-21,39448677,Adelaida,"I'm an Old School Travel Agent, and I definitely Highly Recommend this fabulous
place ! The Location is excellent and so are the Owners.
Thank You had a Wonderful Time!
Adelaida ( Lala )"
7381677,48003477,2015-09-22,9154734,Tim,"Everything was impeccably clean, and the welcome bread, jam, and chocolate was such a treat and amazing. The space needle view is amazing, and the coffee shop and restaurant down the street were delightful. Definitely would recommend to anyone and would love to stay here again."
7381677,49034172,2015-09-30,43320607,Darb,"The flat was really nice and stocked with organic breakfast essentials such as eggs, toast, jam, and a coffee maker.  It can get hot in the summer when the sun comes in but when the sun goes down the temperature is much cooler. I would definitely stay here again!"
7381677,49479453,2015-10-04,4584238,Heidi,"Michaela and her family have created an incredibly special, chic, lovely apartment in Seattle.  We only wish we could have stayed longer!  Michaela is a great host and includes many extra, fun, unique touches to your stay -- amazing bread, jam and chocolate.  We highly recommend this apartment, the view, & the neighborhood.  
"
7381677,57034256,2015-12-21,9071300,New,"Apartment was lovely, really nice welcoming touches like fresh brioche and holiday decorations. Kitchen is well-stocked for evenings that you don’t want to go out. Hosts were available but not intruding.

Modern decor and high quality materials throughout. Comfortable, warm, and inviting. Walk in closet!

Excellent view of the city from the hill."
4317390,23140532,2014-11-23,23953479,Greg,"Cozy home, accurate as advertised, simple, perfect for our needs.  We stayed with 2 small children, 2 & 5, and all slept comfortably in the main bedroom (queen and a pull out trundle twin).  Though the downstairs setup would be great for a slightly older pair of children or a 2nd couple.

Everything was clean and tidy and our host organized everything via airbnb messaging and text.  She was very responsive and accommodating, especially considering out late arrival on night 1. The location was perfect for us, right on a main artery for the neighborhood, and a 5 minute walk from both downtown Ballard (hip restaurant scene) and the D-line bus right to downtown Seattle and seattle center.

Would definitely book again"
4317390,23376101,2014-11-30,1870669,Paulette,"Delightful space, perfect for me, husband and baby. Actually very spacious for just us three, but we really liked being able to put the baby down for his nap in the separate bedroom downstairs. Clean and well-kept furnishings, plenty of closet space and easy street parking. Love the bathroom. Would like to have some pantry items like sugar/oil/salt and pepper available for those nights we might want to cook. Really nice to have the washer and dryer which we ended up using after an impromptu swim at a friend's house. Grace was out of town when we arrived but it was easy to get in and she was responsive via text and email. Would stay here again - also a quick drive or walk to Ballard hot spots. Recommend."
4317390,23519311,2014-12-02,21331871,Tim,"Grace is very accommodating. The property is just like the pictures....new, clean, and comfortable. The location is minutes from aurora ave and I-5. I love the variety in this area with convenient shopping and plenty of restaurant choices near by.

I stayed here long term at the end of summer and returned via this site for short return trip for work. I would definitely stay here again. Highly recommend!

Oh plenty of free parking too!"
4317390,23922305,2014-12-14,24603,Caitlin,"We had a great experience at Grace's little place. The 2 bedrooms were just the right size for us and our toddler - the basement bedroom got a little cold but extra blankets did the trick. Her home is exactly as advertised - nothing fancy, but nice, clean, in a great neighborhood and perfect for our weekend. Grace was so easy to communicate with too. Would stay here again. "
4317390,24642511,2015-01-01,17531682,Danielle,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Cooley's cozy home over the holidays with our two little ones (ages 3 and 1) and my mother-in-law! The basement bedroom was a great place for my mother-in-law to have some privacy of her own, and the four of us fit comfortably on the main level with the trundle bed in the master bedroom for our 3-year-old. The house was clean and sunny (we lucked out with clear skies during our visit!), a very welcoming place to come after a long day of sightseeing in Seattle. The location is awesome! Very close to Safeway and Trader Joe's, and just a short drive from downtown Seattle. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
4317390,24977754,2015-01-04,4476682,Felix,Alles unkompliziert und wunderbar - vielen Dank
4317390,25156187,2015-01-07,23885233,Jordy,"Grace was an incredibly helpful host! She was more than happy to give us great advice on getting to and from her place as well as excellent suggestions on local places to eat, drink and must sees in Seattle. Her place was one of the nicest AirBnBs that we have stayed at in the U.S. especially considering how inexpensive it is. There was plenty of room for three of us and the whole place was super comfortable. Public transport makes it easy to get to and from downtown with bus stops less than a minute walk away from Grace's. We highly recommend staying here!!!"
4317390,25469586,2015-01-17,24841840,Aaron,"Grace has a very lovely house. It was a very comfortable stay, very clean, very inviting, and a great neighborhood. Grace was very accommodating and was very easy to work with. If we ever had a question she would answer right away. She definitely makes for a great host! Would definitely recommend! Thanks Grace!"
4317390,25568526,2015-01-19,12870511,Beth,"Had a lovely time at this home.  It is cute, warm and decorated nicely.  Would definitely come here again!  We loved it!"
4317390,25879949,2015-01-28,25558901,Vivien,This was a perfect place for us. The house is exceptionally clean and the host has provided everything you can think of. It was quite peaceful for being in an urban area. Our bed was amazingly comfortable! I would definitely stay here again. 
4317390,26012029,2015-02-01,25965827,Jennifer,"Wonderful spot in Ballard. The home is warm, inviting, comfortable and spotless! The beds and bedding were very cosy! The accommodation was perfect for 4 women on a 3 day yoga retreat in Ballard. The location is great: a quick drive to many good shops and restaurants. We highly recommend Grace's home. 

Our retreat started early on Friday morning, and Grace met us at the home and allowed us to leave our things. Very accommodating of her and greatly appreciated. "
4317390,27997851,2015-03-16,26263387,Pam,Grace's place was perfect!  It is exactly as described. We had everything we needed. The bed was very comfortable. The location is great. You can get to just about anywhere within 30 min. Lots of great restaurants in Ballard. 
4317390,30121775,2015-04-18,12254401,Vesa,"The apartment was spacious and spotless. The appliances are modern and work well. Ballard is a very peaceful neighborhood but the apartment has 24h supermarkets, cafes, some restaurants and other services within walking distance. A direct bus downtown (28) has a stop one block south and there is plenty of parking space on the streets right next to the front door. Grace responded very quickly to all requests and provided us with all we asked for.

Grace provided us with a ""baby kit"", including a large high quality crib, toys, books, DVD's and a seat for the dinner table. It was extremely useful and saved us a lot of trouble.

The only negative was that the house is quite noisy. Traffic is not a problem but the whole floor is squeaky and so is the bed. The ""forced air"" heating makes a relatively loud noise when it blows warm air through vents in the floor. This happens several times every night and goes on for a couple minutes each time (we visited in April and the outside night temperature was around 44F). To be fair, it seems that most houses in Seattle use the same heating system, so it's hard to escape it."
4317390,30716138,2015-04-26,26765279,Hanako,"Our friends and their child from oversea and my family (4 adults and 4 children under 10, total) stayed at Grace's place over the weekend.  Grace was very flexible with our arrival time, and she made sure our families' stay was comfortable.  
The house was very clean and cared for.  We had enough beds for all of us, and everything (dishes, towels, etc.) we needed.  The location was great, too.  It made it easy for us to show our friends all the great places in Seattle.  "
4317390,30921933,2015-04-29,12210070,Satoshi,"What is important for visitors exploring any city? Location, location, location! If you are in Seattle to check out the sights such add space needle, Mariners, Seahawks, Pike St, etc, the house is perfect. Without traffic you will get to these destinations in no more than 15 min. Beyond that, the community is safe and there are as lot of places to explore to eat closer to the house. I would recommend the house as well as Grace. She was helpful with tips and always responded in a timely manner."
4317390,31871361,2015-05-11,25648587,Eileen,"Met the owner and she showed us the house.  The house was very clean, well equipped, and as described.  Safe neighborhood, we were able to walk to shopping and good restaurants.  We would definitely stay again."
4317390,32277592,2015-05-16,32379313,Megan,"Grace was a wonderful host - easy to get in touch with. The house was very clean and exceeded my expectations. The location was perfect for us, very close to the things in Ballard and Fremont that we were there for and a great location overall. The beds were comfy, the pack and play worked great for my 5 month old son, and parking was a breeze. I'd stay here again without a doubt. "
4317390,32955601,2015-05-24,25055494,Jennifer,"This place was exactly as described. We loved how central it was to everything. All of our day trips were no more thsn a 90 minute drive away. Loved the coffe bar a few blocks away, went there every morning for coffe and croissants"
4317390,34677278,2015-06-10,18058993,Emily,"Grace's apartment was STELLAR. This was definitely one of the best airbnbs I've ever stayed in. It was SUPER clean, beautifully decorated with a minimalist feel. There was so much attention to detail. Definitely book this place--it will really impress you! Also, it's just a quick 15 minute walk to the cute Ballard neighborhood and lots of other amenities. Could not have been better."
4317390,34934512,2015-06-14,17897738,Kevin,Grace and her Husband were great hosts. Met us at the house and did a walk through. Gave tips on near by stores and dinning. House was very clean and as described. We were happy with the whole experience and would stay again. Thanks for a great weekend! Kevin and Peggy.
4317390,35203083,2015-06-16,17836669,Nikhil,"Grace was good about keeping in touch, and the house was very well equipped-- everything one needs is provided. from plates and utensils to towels and sheets. The wifi worked well, and parking was ample.

While the house is on a main road, we didn't find the noise to be a problem at all. 

It's not really clear from the photos that two of the beds are in the basement, so the lighting isn't great. It was fine for us, and in fact we appreciated the cool air in the basement, as it was hot in Seattle when we were there. But if we were staying for an extended period of time, the darkness might have been an issue. To clarify, the hosts did the best they could do to make the rooms downstairs feel home-y and cozy, and so it's not like you feel that you're in a dungeon. 

We stayed two nights and it was fine for us in all respects.  "
4317390,35428166,2015-06-18,35602751,Diane,"Great place to stay in the Ballard neighborhood.  Our first time staying in Ballard but we enjoyed it very much.  Close to the Ballard district for dining, etc. plus close to Fremont area.  House was clean and neat with everything we needed.  8th Ave. was a little bit noisy but it did not bother us at all.  "
4317390,36122031,2015-06-25,34846336,Julianne,"We loved this home. The location was great for everything we wanted to do and see in Seattle. The home was immaculate! Grace checked in with us during our stay, and even let us know about special events going on in town."
4317390,36364597,2015-06-28,28232793,Janet,"The house was very clean and had all the essentials required.
The house was close to my nephews place which was a good for that reason.  The cost for taxi's into the city got quite expensive so we used the bus as it was alot cheaper.
Grace was an excellent hostess and answered questions I had regarding Seattle.  
Even though there was no air conditioning in the house the ceiling fans worked perfect.  We just so happened to be there when it was extremely warm and had no rain. "
4317390,37131517,2015-07-05,1146148,Missy,"After a second stay at a different airbnb in Seattle, I am glad I have not reviewed this place yet. The two experiences were night and day!  Grace and her place are both awesome.  She was so accommodating - bringing over an extra AC unit during the heat wave, a BBQ for the 4th of July, and giving me suggestions of places to go and eat and directions several times.  

The house itself is clean and inviting, a great location near bus routes, ample space inside and out to enjoy, and nice beds and bedding.  It was great to feel like we were locals, enjoying our coffee on the patio or grilling out for the 4th!  There is no worry about using something that is theirs, as this truly is your place while you're there - way better than staying in someone's house who lives there also.  We were out and about all day long, so coming home to a nice, clean place when it was already dark was delightful.  The sun rises much earlier there, so if anything, I wished it were darker later in the basement, but I can only take that one up with nature.

An added surprise, especially for my almost 2 year old, was the closet full of fun toys.  This kept him entertained while he was not running around the yard and picking up rocks.  This house was ideal for us and I would highly recommend it.  Easy parking should be enough to convince you, but you might not realize that's such a big deal in Seattle if you're from any place where parking is not an issue. Overall fantastic stay and wonderful hosts!  Thank you!"
4317390,38098952,2015-07-13,5045034,Joan,Grace was very gracious and accommodating.  We were in Seattle during an unusual hot week.  She installed a window air conditioner for us!  We found the home clean and very convenient to Ballard.  The home offered separate rooms to sleep and also a common area to enjoy a meal together.  We would definitely like to return again as we visit our daughter and son-in-law in the Ballard area.
4317390,38592219,2015-07-17,31110257,Michelle,"This house was a perfect place for us as a family!!! Our group included 9 people staying for 3 nights and it worked perfectly for us.  Our trip was for my parents 50th Anniversary and looking for hotel rooms was NOT cost effective ($2400 minimum).  Then a friend recommends airbnb and in comes Grace, Thank God!!!  

The house was cute and neat and had enough beds for all of us.  Sharing one bathroom took some scheduling but it was no problem at all.  Seattle is very active in recycling and there were specific instructions on how to make sure we did our part.  

The pictures shown of the house are exactly what you will see when you arrive.  When we had a slight problem with the kitchen sink someone was there in less than an hour and had the problem fixed very quickly.  

Grace was great to work with when I asked for information about grocery stores, transportation (the house is right on a bus line that goes directly into the City (less than 30 minute ride) and stopped at all the places we wanted to go) and things she would suggest we do while there.  This helped us to plan our time in Seattle before our Cruise to Alaska.

If you are looking for a place in/around Seattle to stay I would definitely recommend Comfort in Ballard/Fremont.  The restaurants nearby had great food, anything we forgot we could pick up by walking less than 10 minutes from the house.  The house itself is very clean and homey feeling.

Thank you Grace!!!! 
"
4317390,39145675,2015-07-21,13345852,Cathy,"This home in Ballard was exactly as specified! The host contacted us with instructions just prior to our stay and told us that we could contact her for anything.  The house was super clean, well appointed and had all the necessary accessories to make us feel extremely comfortable.  Due the unseasonable warm weather during the month we stayed, the hosts had actually put in a window air conditioner in the living room which definitely helped with our comfort.  The home is centrally located in a lovely neighborhood with easy access to all the things we wanted to visit.  The large upstairs bedroom was very comfortable (we didn't need to use either of the two downstairs bedrooms) but did take advantage of occasionally sleeping on the living room futon which was extremely comfortable with the added comfort of the air conditioning.  The home was super clean with plenty of seating, a TV for some downtime enjoyment as well as plenty of towels, wash cloths, etc. and lots of hot water for comfy showers (great shower pressure!) and dishwashing.  We even enjoyed use of the electric outdoor grill for several meals.   We truly enjoyed the location and comfort and look forward to the chance to stay here again!  Thanks for such a comfortable stay it really made our vacation that much more enjoyable! We hope we left it as clean as we found it!"
4317390,40074211,2015-07-28,27426586,John,"We had a wonderful experience staying at Grace's house.  The house was very comfortable and a perfect fit for 3 adults and 2 young children.  Separate sleeping and living areas helped getting the kids to nap and go to bed early.  Having a kitchen and laundry in the house made traveling with kids much easier.  The bathroom was very clean and spacious enough for three adults to share over our stay.  

The location was perfect for us.  Downtown attractions were just a short drive away.  There were shops, restaurants, and breweries within walking distance and we also found a few playgrounds close by.  Street parking was always easy to find.

Grace was a great host.  She had everything cleaned and ready for us when we arrived and was close by if we were to need anything.  I would definitely recommend this house if you are looking to stay in the area."
4317390,40479925,2015-07-31,29695008,Alison,The listing was accurate and the experience seamless.  A great value for a group of people to stay.  
4317390,43214516,2015-08-18,29549094,Elizabeth,"This place was perfect for our large group. We came up for our daughter's wedding and didn't want to be separated into 3 hotel rooms.  There were plenty of beds for us and the locale was quite convenient for utilizing public transportation when we needed it. We took several walks to dinner and the library. The home was very clean and generously equipped with dishes, bedding, towels, washer/dryer, even an iron and ironing board, which we definitely needed!"
4317390,44281646,2015-08-25,4263251,Evonne,Neighborhood was centrally located - great for accessing all the popular Seattle sites. Plenty of space in the house made it easy for our two small sons to roam around. Tidy and organized place. Grace provided clear instructions for our stay and was always quick to respond to our questions. 
4317390,44755664,2015-08-29,31584344,Dan,Very accommodating. Very clean. Everything you look for when renting for a couple of days. Beautiful place perfect for a group of people. Close proximity to everything in Seattle. Thank you Grace!
4317390,45553122,2015-09-04,14207296,Felicity,"Grace's place was exactly as pictured and described, it was the perfect spot for us to call home for 5 nights. I did not meet Grace nor did we need to contact her during our stay as everything was well marked and available for our use. Location was fantastic, easy walk into Ballard and Fremont not far down the way either.  Overall extremely happy with our stay and can honestly say this felt like a home away from home."
4317390,45920213,2015-09-07,12540018,Vikki,"Grace was great through the booking experience and even let us cancel a day when needed. The home was mostly how it looks in photos. One thing that was different was that the outside was completely overgrown and dying. Nothing like the photos. Also, contrary to other reviewers, the basement to be a bit dark and scary. This house is clearly a 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom house, that they added 2 more “rooms” in the basement. We had 3 total adults staying in the house and we all decided to sleep in the 1 room that is in the main house because the first night when someone tried to sleep downstairs, they did not feel comfortable and just the noise from our footsteps and the plumbing upstairs was very loud downstairs. The basement has 1 tiny bedroom that a bed is stuffed into, but the other bed is just around a dark corner. The basement is also where the water heater and washer and dryer is. Do not be confused like we were that there are multiple rooms. 

I do not know how it is possible to stay in this house with 8 people. There is one very small bathroom and it took just 3 of us an hour to all get ready so we could all take turns in there. The plugs in the house are in weird locations, so we couldn’t bring the hair dryer into another room to do our hair so we all had to take turns in the 1 small bathroom. 

Also, the wifi speed was incredibly slow. We were just trying to do basic internet usage, like emails and it took a long time to load anything. This was frustrating trying to get some work done at the house. 

Basic supplies were not available for us. There was no laundry detergent (just two empty bottles sitting on top of the machine), no toilet paper, no trash bags, no soap, etc. We didn’t expect a lot, but we expected basic items to be provided. Grace did let us know about the toilet paper, but we had to purchase everything else. 

The couches were comfortable. The TV was very small and only had local channels. We never were able to find anything to watch on TV the few times we were relaxing in the house. 

Finally, when we arrived, we found a small container of weed in the kitchen. It wasn’t a big deal for us 3 adults but I would hate if I had kids with me and they had found it. 

The house was quiet and I felt to be in a safe neighborhood. Coffee shop and grocery store nearby and walking distance to restaurants. We did have a great time in Seattle and felt this to be a comfortable place to stay, though not exactly as we had envisioned. Though I do personally like Grace and thought her to be a good host, I would not stay here again. 
"
4317390,47789252,2015-09-21,43095796,Kathy,"Lovely place - I would highly recommend it.  Grace communicated with me prior to the trip and left us a welcome note, along with various notes throughout the home to help us navigate a new place.  She also left us hints for navigating  Seattle and shopping in the surrounding area.  Very pleased with our stay!  "
4317390,48878232,2015-09-29,26691587,Carol & Thomas,"Grace met us when we arrived and told us of nearby groceries and great restaurants as well as very close by bus stops taking us into Seattle. We were able to text her whenever we had a question. The rental was as pictured and nicely decorated as well as very clean. The beds were all very comfortable. It was just right for two couples with the one bathroom. If you have a lot of tolerance for lots of people underfoot, it would sleep eight. The location in Ballard made it easy to explore downtown Seattle and the funky Freemont area. We liked being in Ballard and would definitely stay here again. Carol"
4317390,49356564,2015-10-03,43695889,Valerie,"Grace made sure the house was immaculate when we arrived.  Everything sparkled and the sheets on the beds were fresh.  We loved the little notes on the fridge, and Grace was so helpful giving us directions and suggestions for groceries and restaurants in the Ballard area. (a.k.a. just down the street about a mile) We came out for a (much needed) girls trip.  Because of Grace's home, we were able to see the Seattle area, go hiking, and even spend a night relaxing with a DVD.  "
4317390,57010681,2015-12-21,10889234,Heather,"My roommate and I stayed with Grace for a few months while in town on business. Grace met us at the door when we moved in and showed us around. She has left information on the refrigerator about nearby gas stations, grocery stores, recycling/compost/trash rules for the city etc. that were really helpful. She was very accommodating and respectful of our night shift schedule when doing yard work, etc. We really appreciated that! We only had 1 minor problem with the house and Grace had it repaired immediately. The house is so cute and incredibly clean! The location is awesome! It's really close to both Ballard and Fremont areas, grocery stores, gas stations, and bus stops. There is plenty of room for guests to sleep comfortably and she has provided all of the additional linens you could possibly need. The washer and dryer were in great condition as well. Grace checked on us periodically to make sure we didn't need anything. We would definitely stay with her again if we come back to town!"
7953211,44383195,2015-08-25,41874127,Nan,"It's a nice house with perfect location. If you drive to Seattle, this is the only place I will recommend.  Adam is a nice guy and thank you for coming at the mid-night to help us. "
7953211,45182017,2015-08-31,42048160,Jonathan,"The description ""central area home"" couldn't be more apt. 10 minutes to Pike Market (in traffic), 15 out to Fremont... could not complain about location at all.

Decor is slightly spartan and quite clean, perfect as I hate feeling like I'm rearranging other people's lives while I'm staying in their house.

Convenient to where I wanted to go, impeccably clean... I'd stay there again."
7953211,54782477,2015-11-23,47630528,Sam,"My husband and I stayed here for about a week while we waited for our permanent housing to pan out. The house is 1) clean, 2) as pictured and, 3) the location is great (for me this means easy access to grocery stores ( 5 min), highways, and restaurants, and that it is relatively quiet). The linens were nice and there were more than enough towels for us. Also, the kitchen has the essentials. I would stay here again. 

Adam was a wonderful and attentive host, anytime we had questions he responded immediately. I met face-to-face on a few occasions and he was very pleasant."
7953211,56737745,2015-12-17,44756571,Marcel,Perfect place for me. The office and high speed internet was exactly what I needed 
3534444,16797302,2014-08-02,18284266,Rico,"Thanks To Mike and his family for sharing their home with us.  We had 3 families staying there.  I came with my 3 kids, my brother and his wife with their 4 and my sister with her partner.  We had a great time.  The house had room enough to keep us comfortable and the kitchen had everything imaginable, with enough plates and cutlery for all 11 of us plus more.  Location is tough to beat.  We were able to walk to the Sunday Flea Market, the park, the zoo, you name it.  The small extra touches make a big difference.  The whole house is wired for music, that was a pleasant surprise,  and my son who is taking drum lessons had a great time with the set in the dining room, as did my niece with the guitar.  Overall, not much more we could've asked for."
3534444,16930812,2014-08-04,11430693,Christy,We loved the house and the neighborhood!! It felt like home... Everything we needed was there. I will look at this house anytime I'm planning a small group get-a-way!
3534444,17460782,2014-08-12,18225520,Laura,"This was our first use of AirBnB and we were entirely pleased. 
So much better than a hotel in terms of space and comfort and privacy, at a third of the cost...
Our host, Mike, could not have been more helpful, friendly and responsive: before, during and after our stay he was most courteous, helpful and cordial with all our questions. 
The property itself was super nice, clean, pretty, comfortable, homey, in a well situated area with all necessary amenities nearby.... Exactly as advertised. 
I would heartily endorse any traveller to the Seattle area to rent from Mike: it was a great house, in a wonderful location, and we will definitely be using AirBnB on future trip planning. 
"
4532538,58130021,2016-01-01,21362089,Christopher,"Daniel was very welcoming and accommodating, and the house was great. It's at the top of our list for our next family trip to Seattle."
1777158,8905300,2013-11-25,1400723,Neil,Excellent service and top notch accommodations! Carol and Bruce are wonderful hosts! Will not hesitate to return again or recommend.
1777158,10430791,2014-02-18,1108934,Katrin,"Carol and Bruce live in a beautiful house in Ballard, overlooking Puget Sound and the Mountains.
They are amazing hosts - one night, when I got home completely wet from the rain, Carol brought me some Chili con Carne so I didn't have to go out again. 
She also left notes on my door with useful information (e.g., where I could find an additional comforter) and had a binder full with maps, restaurant tips, hiking trails and the like.
Their Golden Doodle Quasar is also very sweet. 
I can really recommend the room and the hosts."
1777158,19909892,2014-09-20,7765829,Jeannie,"Charming family home in quiet nice neighborhood. A view of Puget Sound from our room was wonderful. Carol and her husband very welcoming. 
We would stay here again happily. "
1777158,19982132,2014-09-21,15435898,Irene,"Hi es war soooo beautiful place thanks so much, dear Carol and your husband.....
Vielen herzlichen Dank für die tolle Gastfreundschaft.
Liebe Grüsse Irene and fam.
"
1777158,20503650,2014-09-30,11091479,Kevin,"Our host was most helpful and knowledgeable and oriented us to the Seattle area.  The view from the room is beautiful, even though the weather did not allow us to fully see the mountains in the distance.  Overlooking the sound and the moored boats and passing vessels was very pleasant.  Also, the proximity to so many interesting places to visit & eat in nearby Ballard was a real plus. "
1777158,21189649,2014-10-12,22377025,Sebastian,"Carol, Bruce and Quasar were terrific!  Very welcoming and accommodating.  Quasar the wonderdog and the kids were hard to separate.  Our stay was all that we'd hoped: comfortable, clean, peaceful lovely space.  Thanks for the nice breakfast!  The view was beautiful, even with overcast days it was replenishing to wake up to the sweeping panorama.  Would stay again in a heartbeat."
1777158,21922329,2014-10-26,212132,Ramona,"Had a wonderful stay! Hosts were very kind & welcoming.. loved my cozy & quiet room with an amazing view of the sound.. it was very easy to come & go & do my own thing.. organic breakfast goodies awaited me each morning. The location was great- quiet, with nice neighborhoods to walk around in, easy parking, close to get into town, etc.. Would definitely stay again- Thank you!"
1777158,22562256,2014-11-09,1904759,Deanna,"We had a great time in Seattle at this beautiful location. The room is very comfortable, spacious, and clean, and the view really can't be beat. Carol was very welcoming and helpful in getting us settled. We didn't take advantage of the continental breakfast since there are some really great bakeries in the area, but it's a nice option."
1777158,25943834,2015-01-30,24676103,Barbro,"A sanctuary for weary travelers! The room is clean, spacious, and unbelievably quiet. A complete break from the city. The view of the water, mountains, and visiting birds is a peaceful break from the day's activities. Carol and Bruce and Quasar the dog provided just enough attention to make us feel at home, and left us plenty of space. We thoroughly enjoyed the special treats from the garden for breakfast. Highly recommend! We hope to be back."
1777158,26289536,2015-02-08,7366376,Skye,"Carol and Bruce welcomed us openly into their home. We were in Ballard for a family wedding and Carol had no problem with us coming home late. 

The bedroom is upstairs in their home with an amazing view overlooking Puget Sound, Bainbridge Island and the Olympic mountain range. The coffee, juice, toast and fruit the next morning is a great added bonus. We sat with our morning coffee, overlooking the water. It was great. 

The neighbourhood is very quiet with anything you need being 5-10 minutes drive away. Golden Gardens Park is right next door as well. Check out the Ballard Sunday farmers market too."
1777158,26575560,2015-02-15,11998295,Peter,"Good experience. Spacious room, comfortable bed, tremendous view, good communication, gracious host."
1777158,28667424,2015-03-28,9652838,Thomas,"Carol and Bruce were both great hosts for my family and I when we visited Seattle. The house is beautiful, and the view of the mountains is even better than it appears in the pictures. Carol even offered us some of her homemade zucchini bread, and it was such a treat to have some for breakfast the next day."
1777158,28769715,2015-03-29,30085297,Tony,"Living together with Carol and Bruce likes living in family, they are very hospitable and considerate. When waking up in the morning and opening the curtain, you will be attracted by the beautiful landscape from the window of your room. If we will have a trip to Seattle, here is still our first choice."
1777158,29753707,2015-04-12,29063665,John,"Carol's room is exactly as advertised.  The view is outstanding, the location is quiet (an occasional barking seal) and the hosts are very accommodating.  A great place to stay.  "
1777158,30258695,2015-04-19,11276645,Joy,"We loved our stay. The hosts were welcoming and helpful, the room was clean and comfortable, and the location could not have been better. We would come here again.   "
1777158,30724732,2015-04-26,8548276,Sheena,"Carol's home is cozy, quiet, impeccably clean, and certainly does have an incredible view. She made my husband and I feel extremely welcome and breakfast was delicious. We especially loved petting Quasar!

I highly recommend staying here if you're in Seattle. "
1777158,31230795,2015-05-03,4667131,Nick And Monique,"What a wonderful home! Carol and Bruce were fantastic hosts, we felt super comfortable and loved the views!!!  Carol made us a wonderful zucchini bread for our first morning staying there, along with lots of fresh fruit and coffee:).  The beds are super comfortable, and we had full access to our own private bathroom.  We also took advantage of the backyard space which has tremendous views of Puget sound and Shilshole Bay.  There's also an awesome beach nearby that our daughter loved and we spent a lot of time there.  Very close to downtown, yet a quiet retreat from the city!  We would definitely stay here again next time we're in Seattle!"
1777158,31398028,2015-05-04,31485401,Jeffrey,"Carol was very friendly and recommended many places I could visit during my short stay. This BnB has a fantastic view, the continental breakfast was filling and if you have time the beach is ridiculously close by. If I return to Seattle for work I would look up Carol again!"
1777158,31683308,2015-05-08,25718787,Niko,"Carol was a fantastic hostess that went above and beyond to provide a spectacular experience at her beautiful home. The room was exactly as described, cozy and comfortable with an unbelievable view. Carol and her partner Bruce were extremely friendly, and even baked us a delicious zucchini bread to have with breakfast (in addition to everything else she provided for breakfast, which was by far the best airbnb breakfast I've ever had). I would absolutely stay with her again, worth every penny. "
1777158,46651778,2015-09-12,912918,Christel,Carol was a wonderful hostess ! My daughter and I stayed there for one night. I have gluten allergies and she was very accommodating with our breakfast! )) Thank You Carol
1777158,47385239,2015-09-18,11936360,Roxie,Carol and Bruce were wonderful hosts. The room was very spacious and comfortable and the view was beautiful. Breakfast every day was great and plentiful. Close to area attractions and street parking was easily available right outside. Quasar the puppy is adorable. We would recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle. 
1777158,47549034,2015-09-20,11976545,Tracie,Really beautiful home with friendly hosts and great views. We had a lovely stay-just in town for a wedding in Golden Gardens Park. Morning breakfast with a view of the ocean and mountains was a treat. 
1777158,49076768,2015-09-30,43506282,Dirk,We have had a wonderful stay in a cosy room at a quiet location with an exceptional view at Olympic National Park. We enjoyed the city but also the delicious breakfast at Carols and Bruce' place. Both are wonderful hosts.
1777158,49515381,2015-10-04,44463467,David,"Carol is a gracious host, visiting with us about the area.  We enjoyed her hospitality.  Our room was clean and had a beautiful view of Puget Sound."
1777158,50204768,2015-10-10,23352555,Glenn,"The view is the best I've seen in Ballard. I appreciate that Carol keeps in great communication and cares so passionately to provide a positive hosting experience. As a good and bad thing, the room is silent, as in quieter than quiet. That's very nice, as you don't hear the sounds from outside. That said, make sure to bring something that can offer music or ambient noise. The sounds of nature outside are great. Overall, I would definitely recommend it!"
1777158,50325187,2015-10-11,2708109,Joanne,"Carol went above and beyond for this special stay. My husband and I cannot express enough gratitude in sharing her beautiful home with us. 

Carol was very easy to communicate with from the start, via email and later through text. She graciously allowed us to check in early, a much welcomed gesture from our flight and schedule change. Upon arrival she gave us a thorough tour and provided us our privacy and quiet time for a productive day of sleeping. The cherry on top was  having breakfast ready outside our door by 100am the following morning. We engorged on the fresh, organic choices and tasty filtered water. 

The room itself was cozy and comfortable with plenty of extra blankets, towels, and a space heater. The view was a stunning backdrop for breakfast. We also had the whole second floor with access to our private bathroom. 

Honestly no complaints here. Carol puts her heart into her Airbnb and we would love to visit again. "
1777158,51180627,2015-10-18,45205053,Rob,Carol was fantastic! She was very friendly and had a great breakfast each morning - can't recommend her highly enough!
1777158,53333909,2015-11-08,10386031,Eriika,"Beautiful house with a great view and plenty of personal space.  Carol was a great hostess, even leaving breakfast out in the morning. The neighborhood is lovely for nature lovers and those in need of some quiet time. "
3319386,15782132,2014-07-15,4763914,Robert,"Quiet, lovely neighborhood with easy parking. The room was beautiful & peaceful. A little basement apartment furnished with great taste. Nichole was a delight. Highly recommended."
3319386,16044066,2014-07-20,18107075,Heather,"This wonderful place was located in a quiet neighborhood with ample parking space, that was a quick taxi ride away from capitol hill and downtown. The sitting room was very comfortable for a cup of coffee in the morning, which was supplied by the host as well as some organic cream for the coffee. If I need to stay another night in Seattle, I will definitely check if this place is available. "
3319386,16133875,2014-07-22,8084530,John,It was so nice we stayed a second night.  Nicole is wonderful.  The bedroom was lovely and quiet.  And neighborhood is terrific for walking and dining.  Don't miss eating at the Red Cow.  
3319386,16233752,2014-07-23,18245453,Cody,My wife and I had a wonderful time staying at Nicole's room. The room was beautiful and private. The best part was the wonderful smell of the room.  Nicole even left us with Rainer cherries and banana bread she had made. We couldn't have ask for a better stay. Ill never stay in a hotel in Seattle again. Thank you Nicole for making us feel welcome in your home. 
3319386,16510061,2014-07-28,7992085,Ron,Lovely room in one of Seattle's best neighborhoods. It's actually quite large compared to a hotel room and beautifully decorated. Nice restaurants within an easy walk. 
3319386,16992944,2014-08-05,17310637,Teresa,Staying with Nicole was great. Beautiful neighborhood and gorgeous room! This place was the perfect distance. We were out of downtown traffic yet close enough to be a quick ride to all downtown attractions. The hospitality we received from Nicole was great and the fresh local fruit she provided was wonderful. I highly recommend staying here and will stay again when I come back to Seattle.
3319386,17313951,2014-08-10,958094,Brianna,"My boyfriend and I had such a serene experience. Nicole was very helpful, going above and beyond to help us have a relaxing stay. The bed was like sleeping in a sea of pillows, with a window to nature right beside it. If you are looking for something quiet and relaxing to recharge...this is perfect.

One day, Nicole even left us a plate of delicious peanut butter squares for us at our door (not to mention the to-die-for blueberries in the fridge)."
3319386,17406146,2014-08-11,19340711,Nate,"My wife and I stayed one night here. It was just what we needed and expected. Everything was very clean, smelled nicely, and was comfortable. The shower was amazing, the room was at a perfect temperature the whole time, the house and neighborhood was quiet. 
I recommend this place and hope to maybe stay here another time!   "
3319386,17488945,2014-08-12,18073509,Bekah,"Nicole's house was so beautiful and cozy! The place is quite spacious with the attached living room area. It was awesome because she had beers waiting for us to drink, and fresh blueberries for breakfast. All the ceiling lights could be brightened or dimmed which was a Great feature for a cozy or romantic evening. She also had board games available, which was fun since we hadn't played Monopoly on years. 
When we had questions about places to eat, she texted back immediately with multiple options and directions.
Highly recommend this place! The shower was awesome, and the bed was super comfortable. "
3319386,17549275,2014-08-13,12288924,Zhongtian,"Nicole rocks! She is such a nice host. Everything in the room is very clean and comfortable. My parents are always picky about their sleep but they just loved it! The house is in a quite and clean neighborhood, probably the best place we've ever stayed in Airbnb. Definitely will come back again."
3319386,17721610,2014-08-16,15483088,Jeff,"I had a wonderful stay, Nicole was a great host with a wonderful space. The mattress and bedding we're incredibly comfortable and I slept extremely well.  The neighborhood is very nice and quiet."
3319386,17911396,2014-08-18,19588623,Chris,"Excellent communication and response time, very professional.   Listing is very accurate.  There's a separate entrance for the guest room which is great.  Nicole was very friendly and accommodating, leaving a few small treats in the fridge.  Even though the ad says there are pets on the premises, they don't have access to the guest area so allergies weren't a problem.

The place looked even better than it does in pictures and it felt expertly cleaned.  We ended up taking Nicole's recommendation and took a stroll through the neighborhood.  A short walk and you're on what could very well be a perfect street.  Awesome breakfast spot, next to an amazing wine bar.  On the net block there's a wine store with a free wine tasting on Saturdays, and amazing ice cream at Molly Moon's.  

In short, highly recommend! "
3319386,18216332,2014-08-23,16650768,Louise-Wayne,"Our stay in Seattle at Nicole's apartment was fantastic, the apartment is beautifully presented, it is a serene setting, very restful after a big day out sight seeing. Nicole welcomed us on arrival, she was really friendly and advised us on all the necessary info like where to catch the bus to the city and info on all the local eateries, her recommendations were accurate we had some lovely meals in the village.
There were lovely touches that she left for us, chocolates and beverages in the fridge, lovely bathroom products to use and left freshly baked biscuits one evening for us. We really think that Nicole has made the apartment a really special place to stay she has put a lot of effort in to making it comfortable and we would definitely recommend staying here. The city was only a 20 min bus ride away or around $10 in an Uber Taxi, there was nice local walking down by the lake. Great location, very nice safe suburb. "
3319386,18293722,2014-08-24,11580728,Marin,"My experience with Nicole was beyond words AMAZING! I contacted Nicole a few hours before my arrival and she was able to accommodate me on such short notice. She went above and beyond as a host leaving some food and even made me some homemade banana bread in the morning. These little surprises, great communication, and amazing space are all reasons I would highly recommend staying with Nicole if you are ever in Seattle.  Loved my stay there and would be back in a heartbeat! "
3319386,18374058,2014-08-25,8660315,Annie,"Nicole was the best ever! I wasn't able to check in on time, and she provided excellent accommodation and made sure everything went smoothly. Not to mention the guest suite was extremely cozy and comfortable. Her house is in a fabulous neighborhood and just minutes away from downtown Seattle. We will definitely come back next time! "
3319386,19339493,2014-09-10,9134033,Todd,"Local beer and chocolate in the fridge upon arrival was the perfect welcome to Nicole's charming space. A relaxing spa ambiance made for an incredibly restful stay, and while the room is a 1BD, the attached rooms make for a spacious feel. The private room was inviting, clean, and smelled wonderful. A careful attention to detail and several amenities made the stay fabulous.

Favs: 
ridiculously comfortable bed

3319386,19658430,2014-09-15,411799,Susan,"A charming place in a nice neighborhood. Renovated basement spot good for 1-2 people, perfectly comfortable in a Seattle summer. The queen bed is raised high off the floor, and the two sinks in different locations makes it easy to get ready. Shower has a ""rain"" showerhead and large enough space for two. In fact, seems like this is a perfect place for a tryst.

Being tucked away in the basement on the north side of the house this isn't a sunny room to while away your trip. Its yoga-studio aesthetic is for relaxing.

The room in the photo is a living space with an old full-sized refrigerator. A tucked-in door between the spaces eliminates its motor sound. Tea and coffee were supplied, and the host asked if I wanted a cheese plate sampler, which was very nice.

I have two quibbles. First, I'm not sure the host knows that foot and paw steps, along with creaking wood floors, can be clearly heard directly below. This wasn't a big deal until a loud entrance estimated at between 1:30-2:30am on a Sunday morning. I didn't get back to sleep until sometime around 4am. The second quibble is about the laser-like light that then shot beneath the wall outside, through the lightly-veiled window by the bed, ricocheted off the mirror on the opposite wall, and hit me in the face at 7:38am. Oy! 

I did not meet the host but we communicated via the Airbnb site."
3319386,20064357,2014-09-22,21382279,Joseph,"My wife and I had a terrific stay. This was my first time using Airbnb and I couldn't have been happier. Nicole was super easy to reach but unobtrusive. Cheese platter and a sampling of local Seattle beers was unexpected and refreshing upon our arrival. Great neighborhood - make sure to try the Hi-Spot Cafe for breakfast. Noise upstairs (dog, wooden floors) was infrequent and not all at bothersome.

Favs:
Super comfortable bed
Large natural stone shower
Super clean
Easy street parking
Fun area to run with lots of nearby trails, waterfront
Quick access to downtown"
3319386,28634035,2015-03-27,28101635,Kay,"A wonderful suite with a gracious host. Clean, calm, quiet and near to transportation, lake, Arboretum. The bed was very comfortable, and the space nicely decorated. This had everything I needed for a lovely stay."
3319386,28851423,2015-03-30,30021732,Sonny,"Great location and very attractive looking suite.  Enjoyed the complimentary amenities, and overall experience that was provided.  Nicole was extremely responsive and friendly.  I would recommend and stay here again."
3319386,29775637,2015-04-12,30124601,David,"Pleasant and comfortable suite in a beautiful setting, and an extremely convenient location for our purposes.  The cheese plate was a nice touch and appreciated.
Our first airbnb experience and a positive one."
3319386,30367754,2015-04-20,29520845,Scot,"We had an exceptional experience. Nicole was gracious, helpful and unobtrusive. The room is just a beautiful place to be. Well appointed and elegantly styled. A beautiful cheese plate awaited us. A couple of beers in the fridge. We also got massages from Nicole: they were outstanding, relaxing, physical poetry. And if you need any dinner recommendations, she is a wealth of information. Beautiful! As many stars as there are to give!"
3319386,33545248,2015-05-29,28720533,Richard,"The suite was indeed very cozy, and it's located in a very calm and descent neighborhood. Nicole was very nice, she gave very good suggestions on places to visit and restaurants to dine in. I would definitely come back when i get to Seattle next time."
3319386,33633295,2015-05-30,5440750,Jacob,Great room. Very clean and nicely appointed. Nicole was a gracious and accommodating host. Wonderful experience  overall. 
3319386,34108461,2015-06-04,10811038,Matt,Stayed here for 2 nights and had a great experience. Nicole was very responsive over text and gave us lots of great amenities. Bed was super comfy as well!
3319386,34981755,2015-06-14,6682067,Carolyn,"Had an excellent stay at Nicole's place. Space was just as described and pictured. Quiet, very clean and in a great neighborhood. Comfy bed and great smelling amities ! Walking distance from a great wine bar....and restaurant both of which we visited. Would certainly book again. "
3319386,35243519,2015-06-16,34217006,Ed,"This apartment was absolutely perfect for my wife and I whist in Seattle for a couple of days.  It's located in a great , quiet neighbourhood, but only a few minutes walk from a couple of great cafes and restaurants, and only 5 mins drive from Lake Washington.  The apartment itself was great, 2 large rooms, and a modern shower and bathroom.  We really liked the décor, a good mix of modern and reclaimed materials.
Nicole  was really helpful and friendly, giving us local knowledge on where to eat, what to see and even where to rent kayaks from to get a different view of the city."
3319386,35691301,2015-06-21,19256132,Susan,"I live a mile from this airBnB and my father stayed here on a recent visit.  It was ideal for him... quiet, comfortable, attractive, and well-appointed.  He said he ""slept like a baby"" in the cozy bed.  Nicole was attentive and responsive to getting the reservation made and upon welcoming my dad.  We/I will definitely book here again and recommend it to others."
3319386,35961429,2015-06-23,35168473,Anna Marie,"What we loved most about staying here was the clean and tranquil room.  The decor is modern, yet comfortable and you feel like you're in a spa.  The host also provides quality hair products for you to use, such as shampoo, conditioner, hair spray, pomade, etc.  The bed is raised quite high above the ground and so you'll need to use the stepping stool to climb it.  Other aspects we enjoyed include the beautiful shower and separate living room area with refrigerator.  

You should be aware that this suite is located in an upscale, residential area of Seattle so there's really no walkable shops or restaurants.  My husband and I were fine with this, as we used Uber and Lyft to reach downtown.  

Overall, very satisfied with our 1st Air BnB experience."
3319386,36567355,2015-06-29,7467956,Naomi,Nicole was an amazing host! Super friendly and welcoming :) her place is a complete spa and it's so inviting and cool. Loved it

Our trip was nearly perfect in large part to how nice this property was, and how well it meet our needs."
3319386,38176835,2015-07-13,36438516,Heather,"The suite is absolutely beautiful. Nicole has created a serene, luxurious, and private space that was wonderful to come home to after a day of sightseeing. She provided a lot of little touches like having a tea kettle in addition to a coffee maker. As a tea drinker, I appreciated that. Everything was upscale, from the linens and thick towels to the beautiful fixtures and shower to the chocolate brown leather arm chair and ottoman. Nicole had a small, elegant pottery bowl of chocolate-covered cherries and mango on the table for my arrival and some sample craft beer in the nifty vintage refrigerator. The location is perfect, extremely close to public transportation. There was no need for me to rent a car to get around the city. The number 2 bus goes right to the downtown area where there is a train you can take to the airport. The neighborhood is a quiet residential neighborhood that is a very short walk to the Madrona shops, restaurants, and cafes. So, you get the quiet neighborhood feeling while still being close to activities. I would definitely stay here again. As a woman traveling alone, I felt very safe staying here. Nicole is a charming hostess."
3319386,38559252,2015-07-16,24008582,Lindsay,"Great location; kind host.  

Nicole was very welcoming and helpful in providing suggestions for things to do around the neighborhood.  I really appreciated being able to easily park on the street and take a quick bus ride to get to where I was going downtown.  The houses in the neighborhood are beautiful, and it was a short drive to good restaurants as well as the Lake Washington loop.  I would definitely stay there again.  "
3319386,39061938,2015-07-20,37045360,April,"We had family visiting us in Seattle and were in desperate need of one extra bedroom.  Nicole's place was blocks away, clean, well stocked and made my in-laws feel more than welcomed. "
3319386,39957646,2015-07-27,36056300,Stephanie,"This was my first airbnb experience so I was nervous and didn't know what to expect. I started communicating with Nicole a month before my trip, and was reassured that I had nothing to be nervous about. She responded to my questions promptly and was very specific. My boyfriend and I were greeted by Nicole when we checked in and she gave us a run down of everything. The suite was beautiful and clean,and was portrayed exactly like the photos. Nicole's airbnb definitely exceeded my expectations and I will be booking with her again whenever I come back to Seattle."
3319386,41669097,2015-08-08,39059333,Denise,This property was just as listed. I loved the neighborhood and centrally located to everything I wanted to see in Seattle. Nicole was lovely and very hospitable.  I'm so glad I chose this place for my first bnb experience. It did not disappoint! 
3319386,41962355,2015-08-10,19225186,Samantha,"The place was lovely! It was clean and comfortable. I really appreciated the thorough instructions, the welcome note, and the farewell email - that made the experience very personal. Thanks for making our stay great!"
3319386,42467341,2015-08-13,37189021,Charles,"This was by far the nicest place we stayed on our whole trip, and that includes expensive hotels in both downtown Seattle and Portland. Nicole clearly takes pride in her home and it shows. Everything about our stay was flawless and we would love to stay again next time we are in the area. Can't recommend this room highly enough. "
3319386,42960225,2015-08-16,37421712,Nicole,We had an amazing time! Our host was super friendly and accommodating! The room was quiet and serene and very clean and comfortable! Everything was perfect! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! 
3319386,45169477,2015-08-31,6831794,Jane,We loved our stay at Nicole's place. She made us feel very welcome with candies and beer upon arrival. The place was clean and completely separate from the main unit. Plenty of towels and other amenities. Location in relation to downtown was a bit far but easy with a car. We enjoyed the neighborhood. We would highly recommend staying here!
3319386,46333536,2015-09-09,31692006,Brian,"We had a great time staying in Nicole's guest apartment in Seattle. It was exactly like described and Nicole was always very prompt and thorough in answering questions and providing information.

The neighborhood was very nice and we felt totally safe the entire time. There is plenty of free parking available within a few steps of the apartment. It is a very quiet area, but there are plenty of locals around walking their dogs and whatnot. From what I could tell, there were no tourists in this neighborhood which gives you a great opportunity to meet the locals. It's within a 5-10 minute walk of downtown Madrona area with some very trendy/hip restaurants, all of which are very nice but reasonably priced and having a great selection of local brews and wines.

It took us about 15 min (by car) to get to the Seattle city center. Though it seemed like there were a lot of busses around that I'm sure would take you downtown quickly as well if you don't have a car. Non-Seattle folks, be prepared to spend a while finding parking downtown. Spots on the street were very rare and the lots can be quite expensive (ranging from about $5-$20 per hour).

The apartment itself was very clean and had very cozy/modern decor with high quality finishes. We had no issues whatsoever.

All in all, it was a great time. Thanks, Nicole!"
3319386,57531524,2015-12-27,23910530,Josh,This is a lovely spot. My mother and her husband stayed here over Christmas and found it warm and welcoming. Nicole is a responsive and gracious host. 
7131797,38446508,2015-07-15,37694062,Jim,"This was our first time using an airbnb and the experience with John and Bridget was AWESOME. The place is private, fully equipped and brand new. There is a healthy organic food store walking distance, and plenty of other nice local spots that are walking distance. It's a quick drive or water taxi ride (highly recommend this) to downtown, and the beach is less than 10 min away. It was nice to explore the downtown area during the day and come back to our quiet, beautiful place nestled in the lush area of Seattle. 

To speak more about the place itself, it's a newly remodeled and fully furnished suite, with skylights! Cable included and WiFi included. was better than most hotels that we have been too. Also, there is private parking next to the unit which was also very convenient . highly recommended! Our hosts were available for us when needed which was nice. We took them up on some of their local eating spot recs and we're not disappointed!"
7131797,38925570,2015-07-19,26002021,Rada,"I choose this Airbnb rental because it was located in West Seattle. I wanted to take the water taxi downtown and be close to bus stops, coffee shops, and restaurants.

This was the perfect spot. My dtrs and I had a great time. The cottage is private, cozy, and very comfortable.  It has a full kitchen and a very comfortable bathroom. The only discomfort was the very hot weather and warm conditions during sleep. However, it was a small discomfort and we slept like babies after our long day of adventure.  We were able to walk to the beach, take the ferry downtown, and bus line is a block away. 

Thank you John and Bridget for opening your home.  Do not hesitate to rent this cottage for your Seattle adventure. 
"
7131797,39456835,2015-07-23,37039633,Dan,"I go to Seattle frequently for work. I have been increasingly frustrated at the price of very mediocre hotel rooms and figured why not try Airbnb?   Sooooo glad I did!  This place was perfect.  Relaxed and cozy atmosphere in a beautifully-done studio.  I could have stayed for another week!   Introduced myself upon arrival to the John and Bridget.  For a couple just starting out with Airbnb, they sure seemed to have everything dialed in like seasoned pros!  They were respectful of my privacy and I didn't hear from them the entire time, although I know they certainly would have made themselves available to me if I needed anything.  To have as stressful week as I had and have the quiet place to work was a Godsend. Plus, so much local stuff to take advantage of from restaurants, bars and markets.  I'm pretty sure that I'll be booking with them again in the future.   "
7131797,40485452,2015-07-31,31841198,Diane,"John and Bridget were lovely people and their little apartment was beautiful. Perfectly sized for my husband and I with everything we could ever have needed. In fact we asked if they had a kettle and it appeared on the doorstep. They even gave us a fan as they were worried we would be too hot. We could not have wished for a nicer stay. Nice and quiet with off road parking and a supermarket a few steps away at the end of the lane. Beautiful beach 10 minute drive and ferry to Seattle too and a great walk to the Sunday market at the Junction.
We loved our stay and intend to come back again.
Thanks again for a wonderful stay."
7131797,41989555,2015-08-10,36023044,Dora,"This studio is lovely, and it is more spacious than the pics suggest. The bedroom is separated from the kitchen and the bathroom, which I like. Everything is immaculate, the 3 rooms nicely furnished, and the hosts leave in the kitchen a supply of coffee and teas next to an electric hot water pot and a coffee brewer. 

The studio is bright with natural light as a result of having several skylights, some open to the sky, others shaded (but one could open them if so desired). 

The studio is in the back yard of the main residence, with its own access to the street or back alley. Thus ensuring privacy, although Bridget and John are available a few yards away, should one need anything. They are a lovely couple. 

I also like the convenience of this studio to California avenue (a block away!). Within a very short walk away one finds cafes, restaurants, and two market grocery stores.

Overall, this studio is a bargain: pretty, clean, and rather affordable. It's perfect for a couple or a single person wanting solitude. I recommend staying at Skylights studio to anyone, and if I return to West Seattle, I'd rent it again."
7131797,42714252,2015-08-15,30114363,Douglas,John and Bridget were wonderful hosts and their place was very nice! Just minutes from Downtown and within walking distance of local shops and cuisine. We are so glad we found this place. We would definitely stay there again. 
7131797,44154840,2015-08-24,38793937,Karen,"This bnb deserves a 5 star!  We stayed at Skylights while visiting our son in West Seattle.  The location was great and the accommodations much better than a hotel.  We found the  cottage  extremely clean.  When we arrived we were greeted warmly by John & Bridget.  They were very gracious, but not pushy.  I would definitely recommend staying here on your next visit to Seattle!"
7131797,45307343,2015-09-01,41054738,Jonathan,"Bridget is very kind and a terrific host.  Check-in was a cinch and she was very quick with any back and forth communication.  

The place was exactly how the pictures look.  The quality of work put into the unit is excellent.  I believe there are 4 skylights that provide plenty of light during they day.  Looking up through them at night is just as great.  We felt very comfortable with our accommodations as it is very clean and tidy.  

West Seattle is a wonderful location with plenty of local businesses.  Alki Beach and the ferry are about a mile walk, so walking there is a snap.  If your idea for accommodations are private, quiet, and cozy, then this is your place.  "
7131797,46493710,2015-09-11,40165225,Don,Really enjoyed our stay.We were first time travelers and first time for airbrb. The skylight studio was excellent.Everything we needed was there.Would highly recommend the studio for anyone. Thanks again.
7131797,47805513,2015-09-21,43343172,Paola,"This was our first AirBnB experience and it was a successful one! The Skylights Studio was just as described. Bridget was a wonderful host and provided us with anything and everything we needed. We also had complete privacy as the studio is not attached to the main house. The location was also perfect, walking distance from Alki Beach and several restaurants and markets. The PCC market is just up the street and was great for grabbing food and drink items. I would definitely recommend this studio. "
7131797,48546796,2015-09-27,41801310,Peter,Very welcoming. Accurate listing.
7131797,50587380,2015-10-12,2854578,Thomas,"Excellent host!  They were very kind, accommodating and made everything so easy. I highly recommend them and their cozy cottage!!!"
7131797,51346559,2015-10-19,6282533,Ellen,"We loved staying at John and Bridget's cottage! The posting is accurate as described/pictured.  They were very easy to communicate with, responded promptly to any messages, and were exceedingly helpful with providing public transit information.  The cottage is tucked into a quiet, friendly neighborhood only one block away from stores and restaurants.  The check-in and check-out process were very easy and the cottage was a perfect place for a long weekend.  We'd love to stay again next time we're in West Seattle!"
7131797,52793901,2015-11-01,1936550,Kathleen,Bridget met me at the door and gave me a quick tour of the space.
7131797,54874562,2015-11-25,36749027,Lea,"Great location! Easy access to grocery stores and restaurants (many within walking distance). The space was clean, cozy, and private. We'd stay again."
4046863,19447716,2014-09-12,14836838,Patty,"Really beautiful house in a great neighborhood. About an 8 minute walk to major buslines downtown, and 7 minutes from the lake, which is gorgeous. Roland was super friendly, and it was overall a great experience!"
4046863,19851393,2014-09-19,8950673,Jimmy,"Roland created a near spa-like experience in his beautifully renovated craftsman-style home just two blocks from Greenlake.  The Blue Suite is spotless and features a brand new queen size bed, pillows, and linens.  Plenty of fresh towels to use, too.  Roland is friendly, outgoing, interesting to talk with, and provided me helpful connections to get me going in Seattle.    I had full use of the kitchen and laundry and the enjoyed relaxing in the den after a day exploring.  Also his home is just four blocks from a great coffee shop, donut shop, two gastro pubs, a highly rated new-american bistro, an elegant wine bistro, and the best japanese restaurant in town.  I'm sure I'll be visiting Roland again, whether to stay or just to chat."
4046863,20063268,2014-09-22,11917671,Anthony,"This is a beautiful Craftsman home in a quiet neighborhood near Green Lake. My wife and I arrived late (around 10:30pm), and Roland cheerfully showed us around the house and made us feel welcome. Upstairs, there are three bedrooms rented out, along with a bathroom.  There's also a much larger bathroom available on the main floor downstairs. Roland provided plenty of bottled water and snacks (e.g. cereal, yogurt, chocolate), shampoo/conditioner/soap, and there were extra pillows and towels in the closet outside our room.  Note that a cat lives here, but I didn't have trouble with it, even though I'm allergic.  We would happily stay here again."
4046863,20213092,2014-09-25,5348321,Steve,"Roland was a fantastic host making us feel welcome and it felt like it was our own home. The list was very accurate and he provided so much more! He provided us with food, drinks, great stories and his home was really beautiful. If only all hosts were like this, we would be so spoiled :)

I would highly recommend this to anyone who is visiting Seattle."
4046863,20872944,2014-10-06,12094286,Amanda,"This place was great. We freely roamed the city of Seattle via bus and bicycle, all easily accessible from this location. The room was clean and quiet, and (bonus!) came with chocolate and water when we showed up. Roland was really interesting and personable, and we spent time chatting a couple of times over the course of our four day stay. "
4046863,21148487,2014-10-12,21342855,Suri,I feel so lucky that I booked Roland's rooms for my parents during their two-week-long stay in Seattle. The neighborhood is safe and quiet; rooms are tidy and cozy; Roland is considerate and interesting! My parents speak little English but Roland successfully taught them how to use washer and dryer by using body language:) I definitely will recommend this place to my friends when they visit Seattle in (website hidden): Roland's cat Jaspurr is super cute!
4046863,21991648,2014-10-27,22661237,Carol,"We had a wonderful experience staying in the Blue Suite. Our host, Roland, welcomed us and made us feel right at home. The vintage home is pretty, well maintained, and has a nice character. The room itself had a very comfortable bed to sleep on and had some nice chocolate awaited us on our pillows. Coffee/Tea was always available to us, as well has cereal and yogurt for breakfast."
4046863,22091868,2014-10-29,22922202,Eric,"We stayed with Roland for a long weekend and had an amazing time. The house was absolutely beautiful and very clean. Roland made us feel as if we were staying with family. He gave us fantastic recommendations on what we should do and see. His house is walking distance between two beautiful neighborhoods and is a 30 minute bus ride downtown. We did not have a car and had no problems getting around. We cannot wait to come back, and will plan our trip around Roland's availability!"
4046863,22934509,2014-11-17,3421468,Dana,"Roland was a great host! I put my father up at his place while he was in town. The place was immaculate and exactly how it was described. He rents a few rooms and there is a great community feel to the house. My dad thoroughly enjoyed his visit. As Roland's is just a few blocks from my place, I'd definitely put friends and family up there again. "
4046863,23882465,2014-12-13,3192103,Nik,"Roland's place is really great.   It's clean, quiet and has everything you would need.   A great value.  "

4046863,24626204,2014-12-31,33859,Margarita,"Our stay at Roland's was great. The location worked really well and for those runners, it was super close to the GreenLake loop. Roland was very welcoming. He let us drop off our bags early and generously gave us a tour of the house. Everything was clean, tidy and comfortable. "
4046863,24875347,2015-01-03,9010781,Natalia,"A great host and a great place to stay, thank you Roland! The house is large and very clean and beautiful. It was especially great to use the kitchen in the morning for tea and breakfast. The location is great - a close walk to Green Lake where our friends live and a 30 min bus ride (#16)  to downtown Seattle. A very cool cat too!

"
4046863,25586973,2015-01-19,5230103,Matt,We had a great stay with Roland. Nice neighborhood and a nicer home. Very accommodating and a great host. House was clean and cat was friendly. Over and beyond what we expected and would stay again.
4046863,26250247,2015-02-08,21989017,Hatsuji,"BLUE SUITE is perfect!!
It Is super clean and there are a lot of spot that put something away. Then, the public space is very comfortable.
Host, Roland Morgan is a very kind person!"
4046863,26504548,2015-02-14,2084336,Angela,"I honestly couldn't imagine a better place to stay in Seattle. Roland is not only a gracious host, but his home is stunning. It has all the old world charm that makes Seattle so unique, combined with all the modern necessities one would need. 
It was my first time staying at an AirBnB that had multiple rooms for rent and I simply loved meeting and interacting with the other guests. It was a great week and I would absolutely return and recommend to all friends and family. Thank you Roland! "
4046863,27148568,2015-02-26,16232094,Alan,"The stay was wonderful. The house felt like a creative studio. The bedroom was so cool. So much shelf space, the bed was like sleeping on clouds, and you seriously can't beat the neighborhood. We lived in Seattle for 5 years and we knew Greenlake/ Wallingford is a safe and quiet neighborhood but close to everything you want especially to Mighty Donut organic goodness.

Roland welcomed us with bottles of water and delicious Theo chocolate. 
 
I would stay here again when I'm back in town and I would also recommend anyone I know to check out this place when visiting Seattle."
4046863,27289108,2015-03-01,9008960,Kara,"This is a warm, cozy house. The host(s) and neighborhood are more of the same. I say ""hosts"" because of Jaspurr the cat. He was also quite lovely and was waiting to greet me from my bed! I totally appreciated the chocolate Roland had for me and the fantastic feeling of a home away from home. "
4046863,27682069,2015-03-09,7635053,Daniela,"Excelente! El lugar es exactamente como está en las fotos, super acogedor, muy limpio, parece hotel. Ronald nos recibió con chocolates y botellas de agua en el cuarto. 
Llegamos super tarde en la noche, y muy amablemente nos recibió. 
El gato Jasper es lo máximo!! lo amamos. 
La zona esta super bien, a pesar de que está un poquito lejos del centro, caminas unas cuadras y estás en el autobús que te lleva al centro. Es un barrio muy bonito, si te tocan días de sol tienes el Greenlake ahí cerquita, y es precioso.
También la 45th St esta ahí a unas cuadras, y esta llena de comercios y lugares para comer. 
Definitivamente nos volveríamos a quedar en casa de Roland cuando regresemos a Seattle. "
4046863,28170913,2015-03-19,17744152,Zoe,"Second time staying at Roland's place....same awesomeness!  Clean, cozy, convenient, friendly.  Great experience, would strongly recommend!"

4046863,30170995,2015-04-18,28883377,Ken,"Roland provided an clean and spacious room, plenty of amenities, and the location was perfect.  The home has great decorations, everything you could need, and being just across the street from Green lake was awesome. Roland was a superb host, he provided excellent information on the area was great.  I highly recommend any of the rooms he has available. And Jasper is a very well mannered cat."
4046863,30270061,2015-04-19,28883377,Ken,"When else can I say, but that this is one of the best Air Bnb experiences... I will definitely be back to visit again."
4046863,30460699,2015-04-22,5356219,Star,Roland is much younger than the photo shown. Check this out!
4046863,30644028,2015-04-25,24677628,Marta,"Super great spot in Seattle! I will totally stay here again and again. The space is beautiful, clean, and in an awesome, central, beautiful location. Roland is great - fun to talk to and easy going.  House has 3 airbnb rooms, but still feel plenty spacious and privacy in the bedrooms - big open common spaces as well. Recommended!"
4046863,30930331,2015-04-29,27016741,Mandy,This was our second stay with Roland and this time we booked 2 rooms for 9 days.  Our visit was just as wonderful as the first one in February.  The home is extremely clean & comfortable and has every possible amenity.  The location is perfect.  Roland is a fantastic host that quickly feels like a friend you have known forever.  We loved having him join us for my birthday dinner as well was so kind to come visit our son in the hospital as we were in Seattle for his surgery.  We have 2 more stays booked with Roland this summer and are looking forward to it!  
4046863,31085302,2015-05-01,21326003,Srikar,"Roland was awesome, and his house was great!

He was really welcoming and warm, friendly and helpful, and was clearly an experienced host, which made things a lot easier. I was even welcomed with a bottle of water and a bar of lovely dark chocolate.

His house was clean and had everything i could have wanted...good internet, a friendly environment, an adorable cat, great location that was close to everything, and even spare towels and toiletries.

I'd definitely stay here again if i get a chance to come to Seattle. It felt like i was staying at a friend's place."
4046863,32078108,2015-05-13,3105977,Gina,"My stay at the Blue Room of Roland's beautiful home was simply lovely. Roland made me feel welcomed in every way, from picking me up at the airport to introducing me to the other guests and having conversations. The house is quiet, peaceful and a pleasure to be in. Guests have access to two bathrooms, one on the second floor where the bedrooms are and another on the main floor. Everything is convenient, including a spacious walk in closet that doubles as a little study. Guests are welcomed to watch Apple tv on the large flatscreen in the living room and also full use of the wonderful kitchen. There's a little seating area in the backyard where you can enjoy morning coffee or enjoy the birds chirping while reading a book or writing postcards. The bed is super comfortable. Jaspurr the cat is friendly, funny and talkative. He doesn't trigger any allergies to those normally affected by cat dander. If you are friendly to him, he will visit you and even snuggle up on the bed with you. An equal opportunity kitty :)
The house is in a very convenient location, with the scenic Greenlake - very popular with locals for walks and runs - basically one street down and the sought after Wallingford neighbourhood, with a grocery store and various restaurants, about four or five blocks away. Buses to downtown Seattle are very accessible too. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed being there and highly recommend Roland's home for anyone contemplating a Seattle stay! "
4046863,32209290,2015-05-15,32932973,Ebba,"Great location, beautiful house, well organized kitchen. Friendly hosts and curious cat."
4046863,32436196,2015-05-17,4392534,Lasan,"Ronald is a very nice and friendly host. He made sure that we felt at home at his place. Also, his house is very awesome! Really clean and spacious. He is also very generous with stuff in the kitchen including unlimited K cups :)"
4046863,32922409,2015-05-23,10643534,Melissa,"The house and room was exactly how it was described in the listing. Roland and Jane were both very welcoming even when I arrived at 10pm. Roland gave me a tour of the house and I got to hear some charming stories about some of his family members' work in Hollywood. When I went to settle into the suite, I was greeted with a big bottle of water and dark chocolate (so good). There were guests in the other two suites, but we were never in each other's way. And there was no waiting for the shared bathroom. The neighborhood is quiet and right next to Greenwood Park. I walked to Fremont and the northern part of Wallingford with ease (I recommend Zoka coffee and Mighty-O's vegan donuts!). Overall, it was a wonderful stay and I would definitely stay at Roland's house again."
4046863,33302440,2015-05-26,22405962,Jessica,"Roland, our host made us feel very welcome. The description was very accurate. The location was very nice neighborhood, very close to Greenlake and Park. Very friendly atmosphere. I highly recommend this place."
4046863,33580910,2015-05-30,12743390,Jan,"Roland made us feel very welcome upon our arrival at his lovely Craftsman home, helping us get settled and acquainted with the house and neighborhood.  I loved that each day, some new ""treat"" appeared in the kitchen - a massive bowl of cherries, a stash of Tillamook yogurts in the fridge, lovely selection of coffee and tea available.   "
4046863,33997872,2015-06-03,24924230,Ruizi(Jane),"It is a special experience for me to stay at Roland's house. He has a white board and map in the living room so that you can see where the previous visitors come from as well as their commends. There is a cute cat in the house, and the music is playing all the time. Roland has an interesting basement:) Overall, I really enjoy my trip in Seattle staying at Roland's house."
4046863,34157152,2015-06-05,30937523,Emily,"Our stay with Roland was great! He was at home to welcome us when we arrived and show us all around the house. He let us know where the things we would need were and what we were welcome to use. We chatted and he mentioned that he did yoga in the mornings and that we could come along if we wanted. We decided to go and the experience there was great too! It was my husband's first yoga class, and he loved it! He's asking me if there is hot yoga near where we live :P

In terms of the room, it is exactly as pictured and very comfortable. The bed is awesome- down pillows and comforters :) Roland also has a large variety of coffees and teas that you can have, and there was chocolate waiting for us in our room :)

The Green Lake area was really nice. My husband and I really enjoyed walking around the lake itself, and checking out the little shops. Great area if you want a morning run. The trail around the lake is paved and I believe Roland said that it was just under 3 miles. "
4046863,34662338,2015-06-10,22492417,Shiqiao,"Our stay with Roland was amazing! He showed us around the house when we arrived. The location is great. We went for running around the Green Lake one morning, which is really nice. Bus stops are within walking distance. 
The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. There are two bathrooms, both very clean. 
Roland also took some amazing pictures for us as a professional.
P.S. The kitty is adorable! lol 
I really enjoyed my stay here. Definitely will come back to Seattle.
"
4046863,35297983,2015-06-17,19334396,Natalie,"Beautiful renovated home in a great location and with good parking options if you're driving. The room is spacious and the bed is comfortable. Note that there are 3 AirBnB rooms on the top floor of the house (this is one of them) with one bathroom on that floor and another on the main level. You can certainly hear noise from the adjacent rooms, though we were fortunate to have respectful neighbors. Note that there is a very talkative cat in the house that is friendly and affectionate but is an early riser."
4046863,35476844,2015-06-19,26387351,Rolando Alfredo,"This is a really super clean house and bed. Roland is a great host, he was waiting us with chocolate, super kind. The bedroom is awesome, comfortable, it have a great space. The house and amenities are beautiful. Is very recommended this house"
4046863,35712350,2015-06-21,35102344,Shanelle,"First time using Airbnb and I am glad I picked Roland. He was very welcoming and kind. His home was lovely and the room I stayed in was amazing. Next time I'm in Seattle, definitely staying here again. He also was very prompt in his communications, so I felt at ease setting up my trip. Thank you."
4046863,35956903,2015-06-23,33312913,Gayle,I had a great stay in this beautiful old house.  Roland was very welcoming and helpful when I checked in.  He maintains a very clean home in a convenient location.  I would be happy to stay here again the next time I am in Seattle.  
4046863,36087286,2015-06-25,8596287,Jeffrey,"AMAZING!  Roland's place was in immaculate condition (I really mean immaculate), and he was an extremely gracious and attentive host.  It really felt like home.  Had so much fun chatting with him during our stay, along with greeting his friendly cat Jaspurr.  Would love stay again next I'm in Seattle."
4046863,36295879,2015-06-27,6184460,Meriem,"We had a great stay in Seattle! The location of the house is great, near to Greenlake (shops, restaurants and sunset view) and close to access to downtown. The room was perfect, just as described with all required amenities. Roland was very welcoming, he helped us program our visit of the city :  we had very interesting conversations (Thank you Roland :-))
We definitely recommand Roland's place and would surely come back for our next Seattle trip!"
4046863,41925853,2015-08-10,30324583,Clover,"Roland is hospital, considerate and helpful, the best host ever!!!

My parents went to Seattle for one month. This is their first time in US and Roland gave them an awesome experience. He even kindly picked them up from the airport and gave a tour of Seattle city. The room is comfortable, the yard is amazing and you can feel that every detail in the house is carefully designed. He made them feel at home and in the end of the month my parents can't tear themselves away from it. 
Besides, thanks for the fantastic photographs you took for us. These days are really unforgettable..."
4046863,42158329,2015-08-11,2061860,Ioanna,"Roland was a fabulous host!  He graciously allowed my mom and sisters to hang out for an hour while they were waiting to leave for the airport, let us all leave our bags in the house hours before check-in, and left me two huge chocolate bars and bottles of water in my extremely clean and charming room.  I would definitely recommend staying here!"
4046863,42537968,2015-08-14,221062,Juan Felipe,Roland is the best host ever. He really goes the extra mile to make you feel comfortable and have a great experience in the city but also in the house. He's a very interesting guy and spending time talking to him is a must while you're there. He even invited us to a yoga class!!!
4046863,42928479,2015-08-16,39776708,Amelia,"This was my first Airbnb experience, and I have to say, Roland has set the bar extremely high! The house is amazing and perfectly located in the very walkable neighborhood of Green Lake. It's easy to get to downtown Seattle from here as well. I stayed in the Blue Suite and it's exactly as pictured, super clean and cozy, with a comfy bed, an entire wall of built-ins for your stuff, plus a spacious closet that even has a desk in it should you need a nook in which to do some work (there's a window in there so it shouldn't get too claustrophobic). It's been hot in Seattle lately, so Roland already had a fan set up in the room, which was great. The bedrooms are upstairs and the common areas are downstairs. The entire house is incredibly clean, including the kitchen and the (shared) bathrooms. There are two bathrooms, one upstairs and one downstairs; both have showers. The common areas include a living room with comfy couch and TV, a dining room with a giant table, white board and map (in which guests have put flags to mark where they're from), a full kitchen, and a back patio. As for Roland himself, what a great and interesting guy! He definitely has some stories to tell, so if you have time to chat with him for a bit, you won't regret it! He was incredibly welcoming and accommodating, and you can really tell that he wants to make sure every guest has an enjoyable and comfortable stay. Chocolate and sparkling water were waiting in my room when I arrived, and he even made me fresh veggie juice with his impressive industrial juicer one morning! He's a great communicator and got back to me quickly each time I contacted him regarding my reservation. The only thing he forgot to mention beforehand is that his neighbor is very protective of the parking spots on the street in front of her house! That's really on her and not him though, as those spots are public property, but if you are going to have a car during your stay, make sure you park in front of his house, and not the one to the left of his (while facing them from the street). Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here, and will definitely be back on future visits to Seattle. Sitting around the table the first night with Roland and the other guests, hanging out and drinking wine with people I'd just met, I was happily reminded of the times I stayed in hostels in Europe. It was even better than those days though, because I had my own room, and it felt like I was staying with an old friend, rather than renting a room from a stranger. Roland's place tends to be booked up a lot, and I now know why...I feel very lucky he had availability on the exact dates I needed! Thank you so much Roland, see you next..."
4046863,44887421,2015-08-30,30324583,Clover,"Roland is extremely great. Room is sweet and clean. Jaspur(kitty) is sweet.Neighborhood is quiet and bus stop is 5-min away. My stay her e was very very enjoyable. 
It's my second time staying here. I hope I could have a third!!!  "
4046863,46915885,2015-09-14,3590996,Francis,"I had a FANTASTIC time staying at Roland's place. He is a very interesting guy and I really enjoyed sharing stories and listening to whatever anecdote he talked about. The bedroom was as described and the house in general was beautiful. I also had a great time interacting with the people who were staying there at the same time. Roland, thanks for your warm hospitality and you know I will be staying at your place again some day. "
4046863,47514353,2015-09-19,3291389,Tom,"This was a trip to Seattle to meet my new granddaughter. I love the Green lake area. Nolan's house is a very clean, well kept home in a quiet residential area. My room, and I assume the other two that he rents out, was very peaceful and comfortable. Roland was great at communication and strove to meet my requests. I plan to stay again next visit"
4046863,47519118,2015-09-19,4138425,Richard,Roland was great - met me at the door on arrival and made sure I was welcome into his home and settled.  There are a couple of bathrooms to share - upstairs and downstairs - so no problem if 2-3 guests are staying at the same time.  The nearest bus stop is a few blocks away - but good service downtown and back again.
4046863,48007692,2015-09-22,8597685,Elizabeth,"When we arrived we spoke to James, Roland's assistant. He gave us a tour of the house--just as beautiful as the pictures--and then showed us to our room. We loved the little extra nook / closet and that there were lots of shelves for storing our things. 

Roland's home is a few miles from downtown, but we were in Seattle for a wedding at the UW campus, so the location worked really well for us.  The neighborhood is quiet and has a lot of beautiful homes. We were a 10-15 minutes' walk away from a couple of areas where we found a handful of restaurants and shops. A bus going over to Ballard is also nearby. "
4046863,48253912,2015-09-24,29661139,Angela,"Roland and his cat Jasper were so inviting! Roland was helpful with last minute my situation. Everything was so perfect in the house. Me and my guest had a house tour and then we settled down in our blue suite. There are two bathrooms, which was convenient for us, one upstairs and one downstairs. Also, there was a room where we can just hang out and we can post a little flag on the map showing where we're from. The house was roomy and cozy at the same time. We would come back to stay if we come back! Thank you Roland!"
4046863,48793651,2015-09-28,29402024,Tawnya,"We were welcomed to the home by James, Roland's new assistant. He was awesome! He greeted us and took the time to show us around and welcome us. The house was just as it was advertised. We didn't spend too much time there, but felt right at home while we were there. If you want a great place to stay, close to the city (10 dollar uber ride) and not have to deal with high hotel costs/parking then this is the spot for you! I wish we could have enjoyed a walk around Greenlake:) Short on time. SIDENOTE: I left my keys in the side table and James was a total Gem and sent them to me the very next day. Awesome people!"
4046863,49053987,2015-09-30,4425141,Jim,"I had a wonderful stay at Roland's place and he is very helpful in every way. The room is very clean, comfy and the wireless reception in the room is super duper fast and stable. "
4046863,49290448,2015-10-02,638046,Jennifer,"We had a wonderful stay at Rolands house. We were welcomed by Roland himself. He showed us around the house. Everything is like in all the pictures. The room is very clean and bed super comfy. The shared bathroom is not a problem because there are two. Everything is very organized for hosting guests. For example every room has its own place in the fridge or cupboard. Wifi works excellent. James is also very kind and helpful and Jasper the cat is a very beautiful cat. Thanks a lot for welcominf chocolate and San Pellegrino bottle. This was the best stay we had via airbnb until now! We felt like being at home! :-)
 We highly recommend this place!!!"
4046863,49678471,2015-10-05,26603967,Bruce,Nice guy! I loved the map they had. 
4046863,50866731,2015-10-15,44928820,Steve,Roland made me feel as his home was my home during ny 10 day stay.
4046863,51089146,2015-10-17,30910802,Avi,"The house was beautiful, tidy, and warm. The room was more than advertised, with lots of shelf space, a walk-in closet nook, and a luxurious first-floor bathroom. 
Roland was friendly and welcoming as he walked me around the house, and every interaction was pleasant. Very accommodating when I changed plans to have my girlfriend stay the second night."
4046863,51489732,2015-10-20,30451109,Kyle,"Our stay was really great.  The house was quiet, and the backyard was nice to enjoy a afternoon snack in.  The location was really great -- right in the middle of everything.  Plenty to do nearby that doesn't involve downtown, though downtown itself isn't too far, either.  Oh, and we loved their kitty; it slept with us the first night!"
4046863,51839993,2015-10-24,34310462,Shannon,"Super welcoming and accommodating upon my arrival at the house. He helped me with my bag, showed me to my room then gave me a tour of the house. I loved my stay here and would absolutely recommend it to anyone passing through the Seattle area. "
4046863,51941043,2015-10-25,36243454,Brian,My stay was great! The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable. Roland was a very good host. 
4046863,52367140,2015-10-28,43703540,Fabian,"We had a very pleasant stay at Rolands home. It's a nice 2-story house in a quiet and safe neighborhood, but only 8 minutes to downtown Seattle and the Lakes.

The room was very big and clean, we felt very comfortable. It felt like we rented a home, not only a room. There were two bathrooms available for us and a well equipped kitchen. "
4046863,52928379,2015-11-02,37309763,Nick,"Having just driven up to Seattle, Roland was an excellent greeter to a city that is known for rain and well.... more rain...

The room was exactly as offered, and Roland was quick to offer the other things that I needed to make myself feel at home.

Great guy and great stay..."
4046863,54607531,2015-11-22,41887218,Kniffen,The Blue Suite was my home away from home for 3 weeks.  Everything was just as presented on the website and the shower / bath was awesome.  I always felt comfortable here and Roland or James were always abailable when I needed anything.
4046863,54908681,2015-11-25,2086024,Briana,"Roland's place was just what I needed. As a solo female traveler, I felt safe and comfortable. House is gorgeous. Hope to be back one day!"
4046863,55399255,2015-12-01,17267735,Chase,Roland had a superb place in a perfect location - I have never slept better in memory and asked him how to completely recreate the bed and he kindly shared all his records and where he got it. :) No complaints
4046863,55555095,2015-12-01,15176196,Patrick,Roland's house was great! I had the blue suite and another set of Air BnBer's were in the next room over (the yellow suite). Great bathroom upstairs and an even better one downstairs. Insane internet speed which was great for the work I had to get done. The cat(s) weren't around much at all - they did say hello in the morning upstairs but that is about the only time I heard from them. James who helps Roland out was very kind and cordial . I'd definitely stay there again - great location with (limited) street parking and a great value!
4046863,56009352,2015-12-07,44103984,Mark,"Roland is a friendly and helpful host who provides clean, comfortable rooms and several other amenities to make your stay easy and enjoyable. Situated in a charming neighborhood adjacent to beautiful Green Lake park, Roland's home is a warm, relaxing place to stay. Additionally, Roland pays great attention to the small details that make a good experience a great one. Truly outstanding!"
4046863,56330988,2015-12-12,1740834,Tierney,"Roland and James were welcoming and run a very well-organized operation. The house and room were clean, comfortable and with any amenities one could need. Beautiful home in a great neighborhood with ample street parking. The only downside is that due to the acoustics of the house, you can hear every little step, door opening or movie played downstairs. If you are a light sleeper you may want to book elsewhere or just bring earplugs! Great value though and would recommend! "
4046863,56624980,2015-12-15,39643240,Yingying,"Very clean place not far from downtown (12min drive). And I really love the cat. He is so cute!
James also gave me very good suggestions of interesting local places to see. Much appreciated. "
4046863,56801062,2015-12-18,44741000,Vance,"The room was very clean and as-advertised.  Common facilities were great -- I especially appreciated the big work table in the common room.  Thanks for a pleasant, stay, Roland!"
4046863,57308988,2015-12-24,49264332,Phuong Thao,"Roland and James provided great hospitality. Whatever I needed, they tried to accomodate. For instance, the Blue Room doesn't have heating but they provided a plug-in heater, which warmed up the room nicely. You get your own cabinet space and refrigerator space to store your grocery items. Also, there is a Keriug and different types of teas in the cabinet (Earl Grey, Black Tea, Green Tea). The bed and pillows were super comfortable. The housecat, Jasper is super cute and well-behaved. I'm usually allergic to cats and dogs, however, I was not allergic to Jasper at all. Moreover, there is a beautiful bathtub downstairs for guests to use (unfortunately, I was too busy to take a relaxing bath). If you want to cook, everything you need in regards to pots/pans and utensils are provided. Roland's place is close to everything. A nice walk to Greenlake and a quick drive to neat coffee shops (Zokas and Diva Espresso), restaurants and grocery stores (QFC is five blocks away and Trader Joes is 5 minutes away). It is conveniently close to the U-district and downtown Seattle. Also, Roland is working towards a secured internet connection especially with wireless internet. Many places that offer free wifi are surprisingly not secure so Roland is actually trying to do something about it. The only downside would be you could hear people opening/closing their doors and walking up/down the stairs but I used ear plugs so it wasn't bothersome for me. Overall, I enjoyed my stay and would come back next time I'm up in Seattle."
506542,1476267,2012-06-13,511219,Alexander,"Jordan, Michelle and Zevin make wonderful hosts . . . eggs, honey, precocious talent with stilts and a ground floor apartment with a perfectly equipped kitchen convenient to Wallingford, University of Washington and more.
"
506542,1501679,2012-06-17,2623876,Tiffany,"My family and I could not have asked for a better experience. Jordan, Michelle, and Zeven were a pleasure to meet and they have a very lovely home. The actual apt is inviting and comfortable, with everything you would need.  You can't beat the location and the eggs and honey were an awesome extra. We will definitely be staying here again next time we travel to Seattle.  Thank again to the Schwartz family!!"
506542,1569008,2012-06-26,444321,Elena,"We like Jordan's apartment. It was comfortable, very clean and  had  a lot of extra space.  Jordan has a beautiful front yard.  The apartment is located in a quite and nice neighborhood "
506542,1651498,2012-07-07,2712679,Jesse,"Lovely hosts and a great place to stay. It was much larger than I expected, and the eggs and honey were amazing. In a gorgeous area, I would recommend to anyone!"
506542,1836677,2012-07-30,507530,Eve,"Great neighborhood, great little apartment, friendly hosts.  The only thing preventing me from giving it 5 out of 5 stars was the fact we could hear every step taken by the family, especially the little one.  This was not a problem at night, though, as the little one went down early.  Would recommend to others and would stay again!!"
506542,2019825,2012-08-18,924352,Maureen,"We loved Jordan's place!  We happened to stay during a wonderfully hot summer week and the apartment was perfectly cool and our little cool escape.  Jordan was great and showed us the bees and chickens and was so welcoming and friendly.  Highly recommend!  

"
506542,2055016,2012-08-21,2945798,Ann,"Very nice spacious and comfortable apt. Lots of room- probably could comfortably fit a whole family: king bed, fold-out futon and couch. Full kitchen with pots, pans, dishes for cooking. Very quiet, nice neighborhood. And the eggs and honey were great!"
506542,2081843,2012-08-24,2926525,Kevin,"Communication with Jordan before our stay was just right- we knew all the details we needed before we arrived. Jordan turned out to be a nice guy as well.
We really enjoyed our stay- the apartment was perfect, and the Wallngford area was just right for us- close to everything, with awesome views of the city. We would stay here again!"
506542,2135130,2012-08-29,1922180,Alexis,"It was our first time to Seattle and we couldn't have stayed at a better place. The apartment came exactly as advertised. We traveled with a toddler, getting in late our first night out, and the nicest touch was milk in the fridge so she could have a cup first thing in the morning--I didn't have to worry about running out to a store to get her any. That attention to detail started the whole trip off on the right foot. Thank you for such a wonderful stay!"
506542,2179057,2012-09-03,2858769,Erin,Cute apartment in a great location.  Apartment is stocked with everything you need - including eggs and honey! Host communicated well and were friendly and flexible.  Great place to stay!
506542,2271740,2012-09-12,2984909,Shannon,"What a great place! A huge and well stocked kitchen in the cute and trendy Wallingford neighborhood.  We walked all around the neighborhood- its only a few blocks from a Dick's Drive Inn too... a nice PNW perk!

Jordan, Michelle & Zevin were great hosts, easily communicating everything we needed prior to and during our stay.  We truly felt at home while staying in their basement apartment. 

The eggs and honey (and fresh ground coffee) were a great perk. The honey was especially amazing and delish on toast every morning for breakfast. 

The house has plenty of safe street parking, and is right off the freeway for easy access to downtown Seattle. 

I hope to be able to stay with them again on my next trip to the northwest!"
506542,2336560,2012-09-18,3389706,Alisa,"We had a great visit in Seattle and thoroughly enjoyed having this nice studio apartment as our home-base. Jordan and Michelle are very nice and accommodating and made our stay very comfortable. We felt welcome on the property while still having privacy. You can definitely hear noise from the house and especially from their energetic son Zevin (sp?), but we love kids and didn't mind at all. We used the provided earplugs on a couple mornings when we wanted to sleep in and they worked great. The honey and eggs were delicious and a thoughtful addition to the apartment. Overall a great place to stay and we would definitely consider going back in the future!"
506542,2415801,2012-09-25,3620763,Cassie,This studio apartment was perfect for my quick trip to Seattle.  It was a charming house in a great neighborhood.   Had no trouble parking.  Enjoyed walking around and running on the nearby trail.  Kitchen was well stocked.  Would stay again.  
506542,2496084,2012-10-03,3034491,H.C.,"Loved the space and the hosts; they were communicative and accommodating. The studio is actually more spacious than the photos let on, and it was clean, well-maintained and charming with nice, quirky touches of art. It also had plenty of outlets for people worried about keep all their tech charged.

Since this space is below the main part of the house you'll occasionally hear noises from above (particularly from their son in the morning,) but I didn't mind since I'm an early-to-rise person myself. 

Oh and the honey is amazing too! Had it with our teas, on toast, and even on its own.

Would definitely recommend this space to my Seattle traveling friends, and for myself next time I revisit the city!"
506542,2570528,2012-10-10,185205,Lisa,"After staying in so many hotels throughout our vacation, it was great to stay and Jordan's house.  It's a cute and perfect size for me, my husband, and two younger boys.  It's private, but Jordan made sure he and family were accessible if we needed anything.  There are plenty of kitchen amenities, spices, and food.  I love that they have composting and recycling containers in the house.  The neighborhood is quiet and convenient-close to freeway and not too far from a bus stop.  We were able to leave our car with no problems.  Honey is delicious!  I'd definitely stay again."
506542,2590208,2012-10-12,2929491,Wheeler,"Jordan's a great host, very friendly and responsive. The apartment is a great garden level space -- very clean and comfortable. "
506542,2650458,2012-10-18,3686783,Rachel,"We loved our stay at Jordan's garden apartment.  The space was very clean (which, with a 10-month-old roving around, we really appreciated!)
and seemed to have been recently remodeled.   Everything worked well and was set up very nicely.  Our hosts provided everything we could need and we appreciated their thoughtful touches of multiple tissue boxes placed around the space, Q-tips in the bathroom, a space heater and multiple extra blankets for colder nights.  While there were personal touches, we didn't feel like we were staying in someone else's space.  The location was great for us as well, and was within walking distance of good eateries and fun things to check out.  It was a wonderful first airbnb experience.  I'd definitely stay there again if the place is available next time we're in Seattle.  
"
506542,2912244,2012-11-19,2925332,Kelsey,"We stayed in this apartment for a month. It was ideal! Along with the delicious eggs and honey the space is clean, has a fully equipped kitchen, and is actually larger than I expected. We were a quick bus-ride from down town Seattle and within walking distance of grocery stores, coffee shops, restaurants, and Greenlake! Parking is convenient, usually right out front. The host family is very accommodating. We were traveling with our 1 month-old and they couldn't have been more helpful, everything from fixing flat tires to great parenting advise! I'd give them six stars if I could!"

506542,3994722,2013-04-02,4439979,Regan,"This is a wonderful place to stay -- a great location to explore the neighborhoods of north Seattle on foot or by bike with easy access to fast bus lines downtown. I stayed a month and loved the coziness of the apartment and the surrounding neighborhood, as well as the easy walk to Gas Works Park and fantastic views of the water and the city. Jordan and Michelle are kind and gracious hosts!"
506542,4196881,2013-04-17,136726,Renee,"Really conveniently located to the University of Washington, great restaurants and the highway to downtown. No traffic noise. Nice neighborhood. 

Jordan and family were lovely hosts. You do have to be willing to wake early with the little fella but his sounds are joyous. 

The garden apt is clean, warm, with a big kitchen. Well stocked with pots and spices. The honey is yummy. Separate changing area/ closet type area. Slightly tricky shower (the more you turn the handle to red the colder it gets, so keep it in the blue section).

The only drawback was the second mattress which had a vertical fold in it about 1/3 of the way in-- which is no problem if you don't need the second bed for two adult size people or have little kids who sleep horizontally anyway.

506542,4901793,2013-06-01,5567364,Todd,"I stayed with the Schwartz's for a month while searching for a home in Seattle.  Everything was as advertised with the accommodations.  The family was very gracious and always ready to provide some advice be it on where to go or what to do.  The apartment is spacious, clean and comfortable.  It tends to be cool at night but there is a space heater provided if you want it.  I would gladly stay again."
506542,4943018,2013-06-03,6167961,Carlyn,"We loved our stay with Jordan! So friendly, showing us their bees and chickens! The honey was unreal! The apartment was very clean and spacious! I loved the kiddie noises from upstairs motivating us to get up and explore seattle! "
506542,5026796,2013-06-08,3703945,Kaveh,"Great location, lots of street parking"
506542,5602182,2013-07-08,6246224,Dawn,"I agree with all of the positive reviews for Jordan's Garden Apartment. I came into town for a wedding and this place was just perfect. Jordan was quick to respond to questions and gave me fair warning about the crowds on the 4th of July. 
As everyone said--the place is CLEAN and so well appointed. The sheets are incredibly smooth--I must find out what is on the bed. 
Jordan also left a great deal of information about area conveniences. The largest wine store in the PNW is a couple of blocks away. They were great! I had plenty of wine shipped home. 
Also, those must be some seriously happy chickens and bees, because they produce such yummy food. 
An added plus--there is an additional room between the bathroom and general living space to use as a dressing room/ walk in closet/ suitcase storage space. 
I highly recommend this apartment without hesitation!
"
506542,5681466,2013-07-11,3884309,Sharon,"We enjoyed a lovely stay at Garden Apt and indeed we had fresh eggs and honey! The apartment is cool despite the heat of summer and was very comfortable. A roomy kitchen and a separate dressing/storage room also add to the comfort and ease of the space. The neighbourhood was especially a treat, nearby walks and shops and interesting places to explore. Nestled between University and Fremont makes the location fabulous as well as close to bus routes to downtown. We thoroughly enjoyed our Seattle experience by staying at this Garden Apt. "
506542,6229318,2013-08-04,6826668,Susan,"Very central location.  Nice host family. Spacious apartment.  Comfortable bed.  Jordan's family was quite nice, and let us do a load of laundry in their home. THANKS! They do have a small, energetic son that likes to run around in the morning, and you can hear it downstairs.  It wasn't really a problem if you wanted to wake up around 7:30 in the morning.  On the other hand, things were very quiet in the evenings, and nights so it was easy to get a good night's sleep."
506542,6486357,2013-08-14,169396,Greg & Maribeth,"Although I wasn't able to join my friends for this stay as originally planned, they tell me that Jordan's place was perfect for their trip to Seattle. I'd like to add that he was very accomodating with the multiple changes I had to make to our reservation, thank you Jordan!"
506542,6784878,2013-08-25,5550258,Arden,"Jordan and Michelle were gracious and very thoughtful hosts.  Their son was adorable and my dog loved him. The gift of honey and eggs was a lovely personal touch...and delicious. The apartment was private, comfortable, immaculate and stocked with many convenient items, including ear plugs in case the happy child sounds were early and you wanted to sleep in (very thoughtful).  Location was quiet, easy access to I-5 and convenient to Wallingford and U District local spots.  Wi-Fi was reliable for work and catching up on Netflix viewing.  I would definitely recommend for a comfortable home away from home."
506542,6869759,2013-08-28,7076806,Eric,"Great location, awesome space (everything you need and very clean), but you will not sleep in. Plan on waking up by 7am. "
506542,7323015,2013-09-16,5991832,Sue,The space was very clean and comfortable.  The honey was amazing!  Thank you ! As noted in earlier posts don't plan on sleeping in - as the pitter patter of big and little feet do get going early! Everything you need is there for your use. The location was great for the Om Center - easy walk.  Great gratitude for fresh eggs and amazing honey. 
506542,7643796,2013-09-28,7895045,Cathleen,"Eggs 'n honey were great!  The place was clean, cozy, and well located.  Jordan and family were welcoming and helpful.  I highly recommend staying here."
506542,7781853,2013-10-02,2314801,Megan,"We only booked Jordan and Michelle's place for the first four nights of our trip, figuring we'd wing the rest. Boy, did we make a mistake when we learned it was booked for the rest of our trip and we wanted to stay put. Our family of 3 was so comfortable in this basement suite. We had plenty of space, loved the dressing room area where we could unpack and hang all our damp clothes after a wet day outside, etc. We also liked having the fold-open bed in the same room as the queen bed. 
Something nice, and that we haven't seen with typical VRBO condo-like bookings is that they are willing to leave basic condiments in the fridge and cupboard from other guests (and some they provide, like fresh-ground coffee, tea, honey from their bees, etc.). It made cooking a meal at home so much easier, and cheaper -- greatly appreciated.  
There were times during our trip that I wished we could go home and sit in front of a fire and look out the window (neither possible in this suite), but the location was so convenient, the Schwartz' so friendly and last, but not least, our daughter loved playing with their son. Built-in playmates make vacations even better. "
506542,8088958,2013-10-15,3995804,Melissa,"This in-law studio was perfect for our family of three.  It was very large, clean and comfortable and had a huge, fully equipped kitchen. It is very centrally located and right off I-5 and had easy street parking. The hosts were lovely and even helped us out of a pinch by lending us a power cord for our laptop. Our six year old really enjoyed the company of the four year old that lived upstairs. Will definitely stay here again!"
506542,8158657,2013-10-18,9246313,Christine,"We had a good time. Everything was fine and clean. The bed is comfy and the kitchen a dream (you can cook a really dinner. There is everything you need incl. basics e.g. herbs, salt, pepper, oil etc.) 

It's also in a safe area and very close to a couple of bus stops.

"
506542,9211326,2013-12-14,8840025,Nizameddin,I had a very pleasant stay at Jordan & Michelle's place. Everything was as advertised. They were very hospitable people. The location was very convenient being close to many bus stops and the university way. I would recommend their place for anyone visiting Seattle. 
506542,9397551,2013-12-26,10577879,Kei,"Jordan is very accommodating. My son and I arrived in Seattle when there was a cold snap. Since I'm new to the whole Air BandB gig, we were cold for a couple of days (Jordan was out of town). I finally thought that I should email to see if he has an extra space heater. He told me that the furnace must not have been working and told me how to turn it on and where to get an extra space heater. 

Then the carbon monoxide monitor went off. I realized it was probably due to old batteries because of the beeping pattern.  Jordan had his neighbors bring me batteries and check in on me. When alerted to our problems, Jordan was very responsive and worked to solve our issues promptly. And the honey was delicious!"
506542,10696352,2014-03-03,329136,Heather,"This is a lovely place and a good escape from the city.  Roomy and spacious--there were two adults and two kids and we were very cozy and comfortable.  Well equipped, clean, and enjoyable! "
506542,13665552,2014-06-02,12002519,Carter,"Had a wonderful stay the month of May! Jordan and Michelle are lovely people, and were always accommodating to making my stay the best it could be. Lovely area of the city and highly recommend this apartment."
506542,14182498,2014-06-14,13362281,Will,"My wife, two kids, and I really enjoyed our stay. The apartment was perfect for us- plenty of room, clean, full kitchen, and curbside parking. 
Jordan and his family were great to us. They received the pack-n-play we had shipped prior to our arrival and even had a spare for our kids. They also set them up for us as we were arriving pretty late into the night.

My only complaint might be that the noise travels downstairs, but we were up early anyway. No big deal for us."
506542,14313498,2014-06-16,1851528,Ann,"We were in Seattle for Grad School graduation at nearby University of Washington and our stay at Jordan and Michelle's was cozy, comfortable and convenient beyond description. The space was amazingly bright and cheery for a daylight  basement apartment; spotlessly clean with colorful and thoughtful touches throughout; the bed was comfortable and our hosts (including the chickens) were very quiet in the mornings. If all that wasn't enough, the fresh eggs and honey were scrumptious!
 The day of the commencement, we walked down to the end of the block, turned left and strolled along the beautiful Burke-Gilman Trail to campus. No traffic, no parking fees, just the chirping birds and friendly nods and smiles from the occasional early morning joggers and bicyclists.  We arrived at the ceremony relaxed, refreshed and with time to spare!  All in all, a wonderful stay. Thanks to Jordan and his family for their generosity, thoughtfulness and hospitality!"
506542,14677350,2014-06-24,11999991,Mary,Hosts were very welcoming.  Accommodations were great. Enjoyed the privacy and cooking accommodations - much cozier than a hotel room.  
506542,15857605,2014-07-17,11563665,Nils,"Very pleasant two weeks staying in Jordan's house. Everything was perfect! The location is ideal for access to the University District, where I visited for work. Easy access to Wallingford/Fremont as well. In short, this was 100 time better than a hotel room. "
506542,16291608,2014-07-25,13235599,帅,nice house and nice host
506542,16827709,2014-08-03,14863947,Liel,"House was great, Jordan and his family are a very sweet bunch. Awesome location, within walking distance to a lot. "
506542,17204357,2014-08-09,3041584,Marcia,"The stay was amazing. The apartment is private, very clean and beautiful throughout. Nice touches like a minibar and a nicely stocked kitchen made the stay easy. Jordan is a wonderful host! We even had fresh eggs from the resident chickens left in our fridge! "
506542,17355545,2014-08-11,17176404,Julie,This is a great location to serve as a home base for exploring Seattle. It is in walking distance from the water and a variety of restaurants. Close to downtown and the university district. The hosts were warm and welcoming. This was a very successful Airbnb experience.
506542,17555576,2014-08-14,11878837,Rachel,Lovely aparment and great communication from host Jordon prior & during our stay. Even though Jordon and family were away for the duration of out stat we were able to access the accomodation with ease and he made regular contact with us to check all was good. The location is great if you don't want to be in the city centre and good places are within walks/short drive. We tended to get the buses into the city centre which took a bit of working out but once we had understood the bus routes all was fine. A great place to stay with excellent facilities. Thanks Jordon & family
506542,17933508,2014-08-19,4134523,Meg,Our host offered us eggs from their chickens and fresh honey from their bees! The apartment is a good size with two comfortable beds and we appreciated having cream and coffee waiting at the house for us.
506542,18239414,2014-08-24,16675661,Kathryn,"Everything was lovely and welcoming.  Yummy honey and fresh eggs, great location, and comfortable apartment.  "
506542,18528276,2014-08-28,16382299,Melissa,"The apartment is really cute and the hosts were super nice. The fresh honey was delicious! We were going to a conference at the University of Washington and the house is within walking distance - perhaps 10 minutes to the closest UW building, and about 15-20 minutes to the conference center itself. Lots of restaurants are also within walking distance. The pull out sleeper is comfortable, though obviously not as comfortable as the actual bed, but there was definitely enough space for the two of us. There is a bed, a sleeper sofa, and another smaller two-seater sofa. The kitchen was nice and roomy with all the utensils and pots and pans if you wanted to cook, and the bathroom was nice. Everything was super clean. Overall, great stay, good deal!"
506542,18791559,2014-09-01,1344602,Matthew,Jordan's places was awesome! Location was great and easy to goto downtown and Ballard. Place was clean and spacious and fit all 6 of us comfortably.
506542,19041515,2014-09-05,19872532,Mo,"The apartment was great.  It was in a great location-- totally walkable.  We enjoyed Jordan, his wife and his son , who was a great playmate for mine.  The room was clean and had all the amenities we needed.  Would stay again!"
506542,20369862,2014-09-28,21152394,David,"Jordan and Michelle were great. Even before we arrived they went out of their way to accommodate us by giving us recommendations in the neighborhood and telling us we could leave our bags at their place before check in (since we weren't renting a car, this was a huge convenience not to have to drag our luggage around town). They recommended a ton of great restaurants, some of which were just a short walk from their place -- and for those of you with special dietary guidelines (gluten free, vegan, etc.), Jordan and Micelle have great recommendations. 

The house is located in a nice neighborhood that, though it doesn't have a ton around it (at least not that we found), is convenient to everything. I had to get downtown everyday we were there, and using Uber (which has a bunch of cars around the neighborhood because it's close to the university campus), it took 10-15 minutes to get to Pioneer Square (Pike's Market, etc.) -- and that's with the awful weekday traffic. 

The apartment itself is simple, but has everything you'd need. The listing gives a great idea of what you'll be walking into -- no surprises. Nice, clean, simple -- just what we were looking for. 

Lastly, this is a great place for people with young kids (3 to 5) to stay because their little boy is awesome. He invited our kiddo up in the mornings to play with his toys and was very sweet. 

Would definitely stay again on our next visit to Seattle. "
506542,20831167,2014-10-06,20493767,Julia,"Good large space, large kitchen that is well equipped, good neighborhood that is not far from downtown but far enough to be outside the hub-bub.  The family was home and available if we needed them.  Enjoyed their honey and eggs too.   Oh, and not having a TV to distract the family was nice.  "
506542,22425419,2014-11-06,19089635,Kira,"I had a very happy stay here for a month while visiting nearby UW. Jordan and Michelle are very welcoming and helpful hosts! The apartment is comfortable, clean and extremely well-equipped. I particularly wanted to stay somewhere where I'd be able to cook meals if I wanted, and the kitchen is more than prepared for that. I enjoyed the eggs and honey too!

The apartment is also really well located. It's a lovely neighbourhood where I felt completely safe. Most days I was able to walk to UW along the Burke-Gilman trail which is nearby. There's a bus stop just round the corner and more bus routes close by so it was easy to get further afield.

This was my first AirBnb experience and the bar has been set very high. I hope to come back if I'm ever in Seattle again!"
506542,22560191,2014-11-09,5696057,Deanne,"The space was nice and clean with everything we needed. The neighborhood was very cute and walkable. The hosts were welcoming, and very flexible!"
506542,23908324,2014-12-14,23834810,Jacinda,"Both Jordan and Michelle were incredibly kind and welcoming! They made us feel comfortable; just like we were at our own home. They were extremely flexible too! The location of their home was excellent for us, close to downtown Seattle. We really enjoyed our stay, and we look forward to coming back. Thank you so much for being so awesome!"
506542,24766833,2015-01-02,17313173,Lisa,"My family and I couldn't have chosen a more wonderful part of town! The surrounding Fremont, Ballard, and Wallingford neighborhoods were all easily accessible, and Capitol Hill/Downtown was a short drive away. 

Jordan was very accommodating, even when we got in super late. The space is large and cozy, fit the four of us very comfortably. Well-prepped kitchen, sleeping space, bathroom...everything was as described in the listing.

Couldn't have asked for a better first airbnb experience!"
506542,26018228,2015-02-01,22497094,Kevin,"The rave reviews everyone else has posted pretty much speak for themselves, but I'll add my three cents: Great location, welcoming hosts, comfortable accommodations. Excellent place to stay. "
506542,26193902,2015-02-06,24727285,Nick,Jordan and Michelle were wonderful hosts with a great place to stay while in Seattle.  Their basement apartment is plenty big and has everything you need.  They go out of their way to make sure you are comfortable and have everything you need.  Jordan was incredibly helpful in helping us navigate the neighborhood and find great places to eat.  The posting is 100% accurate and their homemade honey from their backyard bees is delicious.  The beds are comfortable and the place is clean and in great condition.  I highly recommend staying with Jordan and Michelle when in Seattle.
506542,26658809,2015-02-16,2399440,Amalie,"I'd highly recommend this place to anyone. The bed was super comfy, the kitchen had everything we could possibly need. The location was super convenient to Fremont where we spent the most time. Jordan was super personable and gave great recommendations. I don't have a bad thing to say "
506542,26869593,2015-02-21,5658985,Michael,Michelle met us at the appointed time and gave us a welcome tour. The apt was just as advertised and we had a great time. I would definitely stay there again.
506542,27535228,2015-03-07,23897783,Brian,"A really well kept apartment and in a great location; sometimes if you peek out the back window you can even see the chickens wandering in the yard.

Jordan was accommodating and has put up helpful little notes all around the apartment letting you know how things work.

I very much enjoyed my stay here."
506542,28173555,2015-03-19,28066605,Fred,We didn't meet Jordan as he was out of town. The place was clean and comfortable and suited our needs quite well. It was also surprisingly convenient for our Seattle excursions. 
506542,31433170,2015-05-05,28317858,Sam,"Jordan is a great host.  Even though he was travelling during our stay, he was quick to respond to our questions and made sure everything went smoothly.  The space felt larger than the photos, which was great for us and our two boys (ages 2 and 4).  Plus we could take them to play at the elementary school playground across the street.  Parking was a little tricky during school hours,
but the location was very convenient to several bus routes."
506542,32555017,2015-05-19,31591890,Kelly,"Jordan's place was our own little piece of Seattle. The space was well appointed, well equipped and very comfortable. We walked to many great eateries. The neighborhood was beautiful. 
We appreciate that we were able to have a late check out due our red eye flight back east. 
Hope we will be able to return someday! "
506542,33189707,2015-05-25,3156246,Sarah,"Great location! Cozy. Jordan was super accommodating. Ideal place for family, definitely would stay here again! "
506542,34090519,2015-06-04,2512659,Stephanie,"Jordan was quick to respond to my reservation and questions, and it was a last minute booking so I appreciated having somewhere nice to stay! The apartment was as described. There were people renting above me so there was a bit of noise at night but nothing majorly disruptive. A good value for the location."
506542,34708386,2015-06-11,26240920,Jason,Great place to stay for families. Enjoyed our experience and location is conveniently located for all things Seattle. 
506542,34942273,2015-06-14,12041009,Jenny,"Warm cozy basement apartment in a nice relaxing garden set up. Excellent stay in combination with a nice weather in Seattle and very convenient location. 

However, we have a few spiders visits due to being in basement and occasionally there are noises from the tenant above, both at odd times, at night running or bright early in the morning moving furnitures. 

Other than that, very pleasant stay. "
506542,35344913,2015-06-17,20827018,Chanse,"Long story short: I would only recommend staying here if the owners are out of town. We left a day early due to noise.

PROS: Spacious apartment with lots of information about the area easily available. 

CONS: The noise was a real issue for us - the apartment is directly below the home floor and ALL noise travels through it - talking, walking, everything. While they state in the description noise begins in the morning we didn't think it would be a problem since my girlfriend and I are often early risers. The first night the hosts were gone and we had a great night sleep - if every night was like this it would have been the perfect place to stay. The second night of our stay, however, the hosts returned from their trip. This meant they made noise until 10pm and every time they walked it sounded as if someone was stomping on the ceiling. We thought it wouldn't be an issue once people went to bed but starting at 4 am (yup, FOUR in the morning) until we left the apartment at 7:30 am people were consistently up and making noise. This meant we barely slept at all. We returned from a long day seeing the city at 6 pm to noise again coming through the floor. It was so bad (we were unable to nap or rest) that we actually left the Airbnb a day early and checked into a hotel since we didn't think we'd get any sleep. When we asked the hosts if this was expected they felt it was called out in the review."
506542,36771560,2015-07-01,6961626,Emily,"I loved staying with Jordan and Michelle for the last two weeks while I was in Seattle for work.  UW was an easy walk away.  The apartment was clean and had everything I needed from a well-stocked kitchen to access to laundry.  The fresh honey and Theo chocolate bar were a nice welcoming touch. Plus in the summer heat, this is definitely the place to stay as the apartment always stayed nice and cool.  I would definitely stay here again! "
506542,40558641,2015-08-01,28091371,Patrice,"We spent two wonderful weeks at Garden apt, fresh honey. Our hosts, Jordan, Michelle and their son Zeven have been extremely nice. Upon arriving (on a very late Saturday night) we easily found the key and there was coffee, honey, fresh eggs and fruits waiting for us! We were allowed to use the host's laundry machine, backyard and printer, which was very handy and helpful. The apartment is very nice, all the commodities are there, it is very conveniently located if one wants to walk to U Washington campus (15 minutes). The neighborhood is a peaceful one and there is no problem to  park the car just in front of the house. "
506542,41732519,2015-08-09,30381214,Shiloh,Hosts were incredibly welcoming and facilitated our rather strange coming and going hours. Place was clean and comfortable and close to transportation. Overall a wonderful experience and would gladly return!
506542,43131633,2015-08-17,2703240,Nate,"I booked this on behalf of my visiting in-laws, and Jordan and his family did an excellent job of welcoming them into their home. The accommodations were roomier than expected, and my in-laws were blown away by how well they were taken care of. The complimentary jar of homemade honey was a great little touch that speaks to the lengths Jordan and his family go to make their guests feel welcomed. 

The location was perfect for our needs, and my in-laws enjoyed being in easy walking distance to both the Wallingford and University District neighborhoods. 

Communication with Jordan leading up to, during, and after my in-laws' stay was fast and clear. I'd definitely book this space again.

Thanks Jordan & family!"
506542,43902090,2015-08-23,2705037,Carole,"Great spot for a long weekend getaway. Plenty of privacy, good location, easy access to bus service, UW, restaurants, coffee shops, and gorgeous views of the Seattle skyline. 
Noise from upstairs (footsteps and voices) heard in the early evening and morning, but it didn't bother us as it quieted down at a very reasonable hour. We had no problems with noise keeping us awake. Quiet at night. Very comfy bed. Spacious kitchen. The apartment was clean and well stocked with cooking utensils and serving ware. "
506542,44736537,2015-08-28,39358641,Steven,"Big thumbs up. Great value in this unit.

Extremely well organized unit.  Everything you would need is available already or written in the ""manual"".

The organic honey that Jordan provides is a nice touch.  It is from Jordan's hobby/side-business and he has his own bees.  How cool is that!

Pictures of the unit are accurate.  Note that the windows are glossed/covered now in case you're curious about that.

Communication was quick and efficient.

I really enjoyed what was nearby in Wallingford, Fremont, Ballard, and University District.  Right beside the I-5, but you definitely won't hear it.  The ""manual"" will give you a good summary of the highlights.

I read a couple other reviews of this unit and can re-iterate two points.  There was one morning where I woke to hear kids running upstairs and other sounds, but I quickly went back to sleep.  Also, you'll see the occasional spider =)"
506542,45165300,2015-08-31,11101527,Shannon,Great place. Great location. Just as advertised. They were very easy to work with.  
506542,46927590,2015-09-14,41007712,Wenshan,非常愉快的一次旅行！这套房子很宽敞，干净整洁，旁边就有公交车站。主人还送了蜂蜜和巧克力，可惜行李太多没能带走。并且主人十分热情，在我们需要帮助时都很热心帮助我们，非常感动！It was a very good experience
506542,47649766,2015-09-21,1195379,Allison,"We very much enjoyed our stay at the Schwartz's garden apartment! The space was very welcoming, comfortable, and clean and they went the extra mile to make sure we were taken care of. After longs days out exploring Seattle, this place was such a great refuge to return to. And the Wallingford neighborhood is super lovely (and an especially nice place for families with kiddos). We'd stay there again, no question!"
506542,48422531,2015-09-26,42875096,Rachel,"What a truly delightful stay I had at the beautiful home of the Schwartz family. They space was clean, cozy, and had many thoughtful additions to make one feel right at home. Jordan was very quick to offer help with directions and to give suggestions for places to eat nearby. Michelle was also very friendly and helpful in letting me store some belongings beyond check-out time. The backyard honey and chocolate bar were a very sweet touch as well."
506542,49438834,2015-10-04,39439715,Gabriela,El departamento es cómodo y cerca de las rutas de transporte. Tiene todo lo necesario para una estancia agradable. Está bien acondicionado y el anfitrión ofrece información de utilidad para moverse en los alrededores. El departamento es tal y como está descrito en el anuncio.
506542,50321133,2015-10-11,38122123,Karen,"Our 4 nights' stay in Jordan's place was pleasant experience. The location is good, within 30min's drive to places we visited. The place was spacious and clean, had many lights to make it bright enough for our son to do his homework. Though we didn't meet in person, Jordan was responsive upon our arrival to answer questions. It was very nice of him to leave honey, eggs and chocalate, thank you! "
506542,50887861,2015-10-15,45948098,Susan,"Lovely gem of a basement apartment. Walk-in, walk-out, no need to use stairs to access. Within 15 minute walk to UW. Very clean, comfortable, and affordable. We used greens from the garden for our morning smoothies and enjoyed the homegrown honey. We slept very well here. The apartment is dark, quiet, and cool at night with access to fresh air. Mattress was firm and nice assortment of pillows. Our only complaint is street parking signs aren't super obvious. We managed to get a parking ticket on our last day, even though we thought we were in an allowed space. Neighborhood is best setup for small cars. We have a mid-size truck, which made parking more of a challenge. We would definitely stay here again."
506542,51315954,2015-10-19,42992387,Carolyn,"The Schwartz family was awesome; everyone was very welcoming and friendly. The basement apartment was comfortable, safe and aesthetically pleasing, and well stocked with essentials such as extra pillows and blankets, hair dryer, shampoo/soap, bottled water and other beverages, umbrella, and for me, interesting books! The added touches of fresh honey and chocolate helped make my visit wonderful. The location close to I5 and UW was perfect for me to walk, drive or catch a bus. You can hear the Schwartz family above you but to me it was comforting."
5069495,27402474,2015-03-03,22531694,Alisha,"The room was just as described. It was perfect.  Devin and Linda were awesome hosts. Upon arrival I was met with the keys, and Devin gave me some recommendations for the city and told me about the area and what was close by . They checked on me to make sure everything was ok and to see if I needed anything to make my stay more comfortable. To top it off, they even bought cupcakes for my birthday. I would definitely stay here again! "
5069495,27832643,2015-03-13,24655498,Ariam," This being my first AirBNB travel and traveling on my own for the first time, Devin and Linda were phenomenal hosts. They always had great suggestions on where to go and what I should do. They also made sure I was doing well and always asked if I needed anything. Devin even let me borrow a charger after forgetting mine. They will certainly not disappoint! The room was described perfectly. From waking up to going to sleep, everything was amazing. If I wanted quiet time, I'd go there but you're going to want to hangout with them. They're definitely people you want to meet in your life! And baby Liam was too cute! If you get a chance to go get something to eat with them, do it! When I go back to Seattle, I'm staying with them again! Thank you for everything! "
5069495,28183679,2015-03-19,28772620,Robert,"Awesome place, very roomy and comfy in a great neighborhood with convenient access to Seattle.  Devin was a great host and friendly guy.  He even had sweet recommendations about what to check out in the city.  Bonuses: Cats + Coffee.  Would stay again!"
5069495,28571927,2015-03-26,27891060,Renate,"Devin and his wife were so welcoming, and have such a cool spot. It was easy to get to downtown, and is a block away from an awesome coffee shop that they recommended. The bed was comfortable, and there was tons of room in the studio. Would definitely stay here again! "
5069495,28889139,2015-03-31,28646260,Annie,Devin and Linda were wonderful hosts and very helpful in getting us information about how to get around in Seattle. This was an awesome location (definitely check out Broadcast Coffee next door!) and the studio was very roomy and comfortable. Thanks for having us!
5069495,32276232,2015-05-16,21290062,Katharina,"The Studio is a stylish and great alternative. It is a great experience. The Studio match the description.  

Thank you for the nice time!"
5069495,33603248,2015-05-30,2407415,Janet,"This is such a cute, modern studio! Devin and Linda were both very welcoming and accommodating and gave such great recommendations during our stay. The studio is chic and in walking distance of 12th Ave and a quick Uber ride to Pike Place Market. The hosts were fun to talk to, but at the same time respected our privacy. We loved the friendly and adorable cats, too! Thanks so much!  "
5069495,34241739,2015-06-06,9990003,Ben,"Very good, left a key for me, guided me, gave me a good tour. No problems at all. Very simple"
5069495,34876396,2015-06-13,5282182,Erin,"Nice little place to stay, the location is right by the city so it was great for easy access. It's not every day you get to sleep in a photo studio, tons of space, very unique. Devin and Linda were very friendly and helpful, would highly recommend! "
5069495,35482930,2015-06-19,5727874,Jesse,Devin and Linda were excellent hosts. They were very accommodating and hospitable. The one small issue that came up was handled right away. The space was great too. The studio was spacious and comfortable. Also very private. They even let us catch up on our Game of Thrones with their HBO subscription. Would definitely recommend and would stay again. 
5069495,36204488,2015-06-26,34605937,Patricia,"The description for this Airbnb is spot on. It is a lovely studio that is down the road from a good coffee shop. It is close to downtown Seattle, so taking an Uber was very reasonable. The hosts were very nice and accommodating! Our flight was delayed 3 times out of Philly due to severe thunderstorms and Devin met us outside the unit and gave us a tour when we finally arrived past midnight. I would hug my recommend this space! "
5069495,37053123,2015-07-04,30484432,Alexander,"You couldn't ever wish for better hosts. Linda and Devin made our stay in seattle unforgettable by taking us out for dinner and sharing some drinks on their beautiful rooftop terrace. 
The room is spacious, the location is close to downtown seattle."
5069495,37635493,2015-07-09,25406446,Marcel,"Devin and Linda are great hosts. I had the pleasure to celebrate 4th of July with them and their friends. I enjoyed this a lot!
They were really hospitable and always helped with whatever they could. The studio is really roomy with it's own bathroom (shower on the 3rd floor). I also liked the three friendly cats!
If you have a chance to stay with them go for it!"
5069495,37865141,2015-07-11,25650798,Alice,"Devin & Linda are so sweet and accommodating.  The studio was clean, spacious, and modern.  There is a private restroom in the studio, and the showers are two floors up.  Close to downtown Seattle, and there are always tons of ubers around.  We had an awesome stay, thank you for having us!"
5069495,38746431,2015-07-18,26704058,Hans,"Devin and Linda were quite accommodating. Linda gave us a tour upon arrival; Devin set-up a second bed for my daughter. The location is manageable to King St train station, downtown, ferries, etc via Metro or walking (mile-plus). Neighborhood felt safe. Excellent coffee shop within a block.

Private bathroom within unit; shower available on third floor. Very nice."
5069495,39951344,2015-07-27,35642589,Emily,"Spacious, clean spot a little ways from downtown.  Wonderful, friendly hosts!"
5069495,40259619,2015-07-29,24247616,Brian Jennings,"Great place, great host! Devin was easy to coordinate with upon arriving. He has great energy and makes you feel like you're a friend he's known for years.  The space is very large and private and is a great location for easy Seattle access.  I walked over a mile through China town to my favorite restaurants in Pioneer Square from the apartment. There's a park and great coffee a block away. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend this space."
5069495,42168245,2015-08-11,38400503,Erin,"We had a wonderful time in the funky studio space. The location worked well and we enjoyed the walk down into downtown, finding a neat roadside smoothie shack along the way. The rib joint next door is worth a taste too. Devin was great with directions, suggestions on where to eat and made our stay as comfortable and private as possible. "
5069495,42712979,2015-08-15,37730778,Carly,"Devin and Linda were two of the nicest people! We loved chatting with them and Devin even text us some local places to explore. The studio was private and spacious... everything they described and more. The street and water pipes were a bit noisy, but nothing unbearable. The bathroom in the studio is all you need on a regular basis and the shower upstairs is extremely accessible. Everything in Seattle is just moments away and we even walked to dinner one night and the coffee shop down the road each morning. Staying here made our trip to Seattle more enjoyable!"
5069495,43796463,2015-08-22,3585039,Heather,"We had a great time in Seattle. The space was unique and convenient to the bus stop. Broadcast coffee was just a block from the studio, we'd grab coffee and then head downtown. We only got to chat with Devin and his wife once but a very sweet and accommodating couple. The weather is so cool in the mornings  and evenings making it nice to keep all the windows open. The shower is on the 3rd floor, but there is a private bath in the studio. Overall it was a wonderful option:) "
5069495,44673737,2015-08-28,39748377,Briana,"Devin and Laura were extremely kind, friendly hosts. They made us feel welcome right away and were very helpful in providing recommendations for what to do in the area. The studio was comfortable and spacious, with lots of privacy. The location was convenient for taking the bus to the downtown area. We're glad we had a chance to stay here!  "
5069495,45255354,2015-09-01,17526513,Louie,"Devin and Linda are great hosts. Myself and 3 other friends stayed in their unit for 3 nights over PAX Prime Weekend, so we were all mostly out and about. Devin and Linda made our stay that much easier by being flexible with us in terms of our luggage. They're both great hosts and wonderful!"
5069495,45602681,2015-09-04,41719168,Kent,"Devin and Linda were great hosts.  The studio is nice and roomy.  I recently moved to Seattle, and they gave me great advice on neighborhoods, restaurants, and activities in the area.  I highly suggest them."
5069495,46385778,2015-09-10,38715229,Jordan,"Devin was very welcoming and provided an insider list of things to do in Seattle. The room was big, concrete floors, modern. Convenient bus stop right outside and walking distance from downtown. Highly recommend. Shower is on the 3rd floor but is not inconvenient. Room has a private half bath. The room is on the first floor, exposed pipes on the ceiling and along the side of bed. If water is running you can hear it coming down the pipes from upstairs. Not a huge deal but you will hear it. Also, there is no way to lock the room... You can lock it but it can be unlocked from the main hall by turning the knob. Overall, a great find and good deal."
5069495,49710911,2015-10-05,6817153,Ashley,"Wonderful experience! Devin was really accommodating, and the downstairs studio gave us perfect privacy. I would highly recommend staying here! "
5069495,50173067,2015-10-10,20143409,Charlotte,"Great place, Devin and Linda are very nice people and were really helpful! Would highly recommend it anyone, it's the perfect place to stay in Seattle!"
5069495,51823283,2015-10-24,46594559,Colin,Devin did a great job of making us feel welcomed and gave us a lot of excellent tips on restaurants to check out in the area.
5069495,53229477,2015-11-06,19589739,Jason,"Devin's space worked out perfectly and was much larger and more convenient than I had expected. My only regret was that my schedule was packed and I only had a moment to say hello to Devin and family. Great food nearby at BaBar - I went both nights that I stayed! (Also, I had meetings downtown which I walked to - this worked out quite well as street parking is unmetered and easy to find.)"
5069495,55057850,2015-11-27,46962741,Jake,"Great stay. Devin and his wife were great hosts and my girlfriend and I had zero issues during our three night stay. Devin provided a cheat sheet for places we could visit which was great — the Babar Vietnamese was very good. The room itself was very spacious and served as a great place to sleep. While the bathroom is only a half, Devin kindly opened up his shower to us during our stay."
5069495,57391712,2015-12-25,50609778,Rynn,"Devin is very welcoming upon our arrival. The place is spacious and clean. Devin is kind enough to provide another air mattress for us! The guest bathroom is a little bit small but it still work. We enjoyed our stay, thank you! "
5069495,57575092,2015-12-27,44029080,Jinpu,"The house was nice and clean and big, Devin was really nice and flexible. We loved it!!!"
5069495,57814188,2015-12-29,147388,Mary & Juan,"Devin is great, and was welcoming to myself and my husband. We had planned to host a tiny party at the studio which he was open to as long as we ended early and cleaned up after ourselves. I was already to comply! But, sadly, our plans changed and we didn't get to stay at the studio. But I'd love to. It looks fantastic and has great reviews. Maybe next time!"
5069495,58467478,2016-01-02,52721080,Ashley,Great stay at the studio! My husband and I had a wonderful time and it was a perfect location from downtown. 
3793790,17597354,2014-08-14,5629356,Philipp,Cris was a very kind and friendly host. Everything was clean. The room was very comfortable and pleasant. I appreciate her assistance with printing our tickets. 
3793790,17666841,2014-08-15,14136215,Lexis,"Chris made me feel welcome in her home, and offered me a nice clean room to sleep in that came with a TV and a printed out list of reminders.  Her and her husband were very flexible with check in/check out, next time I'm in Seattle I will definitely consider staying here again.  I even forgot something and Chris offered to mail it back to me :)"
3793790,17977072,2014-08-19,19766786,Ryo,"Cris's house was wonderful!!! Cris is the greatest host!! She made me so happy  when I stayed there. Location is also good. About 10minutes from a station. not noisy, so you can sleep well.
In conclusion, you can have great and wonderful staying!!"
3793790,18221489,2014-08-23,20191532,Lee,Cris was very accommodating for my last minute request for only one night. She was very quick to respond and made me feel very welcome upon arrival! Cris is very friendly and was a great host
3793790,18385128,2014-08-25,11935612,Kelly,"We had a great stay at Cris' house! Cris was the perfect host. She was very responsive both before and during our stay. 

The house was absolutely adorable. Cris has a beautiful garden out back with fruits and vegetables, and was very gracious in offering to share with us. There are a bunch of great restaurants within a couple miles of the house, and the light rail is nearby (10 min walk). Thanks for everything, Cris!"
3793790,18695978,2014-08-30,6933721,Shane,Cris was very welcoming and accommodating!  Her home was very clean and neat!  She also provided everything necessary to be comfortable.  I would highly recommend staying here! 
3793790,18825858,2014-09-01,7198972,Adrian,"Cris was quick to respond and flexible regarding check-in/out times. Cris and her husband were very welcoming, friendly and wonderful hosts! I stayed two nights and slept very well in the large bed. The room was comfortable and clean in a quiet neighborhood, only 10 minutes walking from the Seattle Link Light Railway, which provides very frequent and cheap access to both downtown (20min ride) and the airport. However, her house is on a steep hill, which was fine walking for me, but might be difficult if you have much luggage."
3793790,19959914,2014-09-21,20805779,Matt,"Cris was very accommodating and available and friendly but not intrusive. I would certainly stay in her place again. I booked the room only the day before arriving, and she was very flexible. Also, I extended my stay and then reduced it at the last minute, all of which Cris was happy to accommodate. The room, bathroom and entire home were very clean and well kept. Internet was fast. Cris has a wonderful backyard with covered porch. I rode the light rail to downtown Seattle every day. The walk to the light rail is about 10 minutes and the ride to downtown 20-25 minutes. "
3793790,22191460,2014-11-01,13141520,Greg,"Cris is great, very kind and generous. The room is spacious and comfortable. Highly recommended. "
3793790,30835686,2015-04-27,31149376,Mary,This was my first experience with Air BNB and it couldn't have been better. The house is beautiful and my room was super comfy! I had come straight from the airport and I didn't realize how hungry I was until I found homemade muffins and a fruit bowl. The fridge had plenty of bottled water for me. I was given a bunch of info about things to see and do in Seattle. That was a really nice touch. I would highly recommend staying here. You won't be disappointed.
3793790,35664393,2015-06-21,25504193,David,"Cris and Raul were lovely hosts that provided not only temporary housing but a home for four weeks. The house was lovely, the room was comfortable and spacious. They were always very attentive, courteous and friendly and they truly care about providing you with a good experience. The area is in a part of town that is seeing a lot of changes lately. I thought it was quiet and safe. I was able to both enjoy their company at times and my privacy if desired."
3793790,35974328,2015-06-23,23468253,Joseph,this is a good experience.The house is amazing and Cris is a very kind person.I like her little dog.she is so cute.A greet impression in my heart.Thank u very much.
3793790,36242054,2015-06-26,13939379,Chloe,"I had a great experience staying here during relocating from Texas. The house was beautiful and incredibly clean, and communication with the host was prompt and gracious. The individual locking rooms and free morning coffee and croissants made it seem like an old-fashioned BnB! The backyard was great for my dog, and the landscaping and garden added beautiful and peaceful ambience. You will absolutely love this place."
3793790,36457796,2015-06-28,26360039,Jose,"We got into Seattle pretty late at night, but when we showed up to Cris' place, she was standing in front of her window patiently waiting for us. Our room and bed were fantastic, and very comfortable.  The towel swans were a nice touch.  
Cris even cut up some fruit for us for breakfast.  She was incredibly nice and accommodating. It's too bad we were only there for an overnight, I would have loved to interact with her and her husband and little dog some more. "
3793790,36716014,2015-06-30,35717568,Brady,"MY wife and I stayed the night before a very early flight in the morning. We arrived at 10pm or so, and left at like 5 in the morning so we didn't have a lot of interaction. The house was clean and very colorful, and Chris was accommodating (and forgiving of our noisy early departure) =)"
3793790,36928312,2015-07-02,24232819,Daniel,"Cris is an amazing host and the stay at her apartment was almost like in a hotel. She provided small sanitary product samples, coffee, the WiFi worked great, everything was really clean and the bed very comfortable. It was the first time I didn't rent an entire place on airbnb, and I was positively surprised how comfortable it felt, no matter whether the hosts were around or not. "
3793790,37026171,2015-07-03,18743059,James,"A nice, relaxing place to spend the night. Hosts were kind and very responsive!"
3793790,40603294,2015-08-01,35510628,Kara,"My wife and I stayed with Cris for a month since we were moving to Seattle and wanted time to look for property of our own. Cris and her house were very accommodating and nice. This was our first Airbnb experience, so we're glad it was a good one.

Our space: Our room was nicely sized with a large bed and good closet and drawer space. It also had a desk and a couple stools, and we were able to manage with our two laptops. We had room in the fridge/freezer and pantry to store some food of our own.

Amenities: TV with Roku/Netflix, good Internet. Our dogs had a large (enclosed) back yard to run around in. Cris provided free coffee and water and some snacks (bread, fruit, sometimes sweets). Cris has a decent sized kitchen with basic supplies and I was able to cook a few basic meals while there.

Area: Several restaurants within walking distance, and so is the tram line which has several stops all the way from SeaTac airport to Westlake. We spent several days taking the tram up to areas to eat and shop, including the aquarium. We considered finding permanent housing in this area because we like it.

Host: Cris is nice, and told us a bit about the area. She also had a map with some stops on it we visited. She also has a small dog who is cute. She barks a lot, but mostly just when people are coming and going."
3793790,41274454,2015-08-05,37283729,Tilly,"Cris and her husband were lovely hosts with a lovely home. It was in a great location with only a 5 minute walk to both the Skytrain, which goes straight into downtown Seattle, and the supermarket. The room was pure luxury after a month of camping and hostelling; the lock on the door and Netflix in the room was a nice touch. We would absolutely stay with Cris again if we were in Seattle again!"
3793790,42154360,2015-08-11,5486602,Tanin,"We stay at Cris's place for 7 days.

The room is very clean and comfortable. There is a full kitchen with complementary breads/fruits. There's a lot of space in the living room and in the backyard for hanging out. Jennings, the dog, is also very friendly. The laundry is free and in the basement. It's so convenient.

Cris and Raul are great hosts and spent efforts to welcome us. She even bought instant noodles (as complementary), when she saw we liked eating them.

The area is OK. It's a bit isolated, but we walked from and to the Othello lightrail station almost every day with no problems."
3793790,42353365,2015-08-12,21662542,Bryan,"Had a very nice stay with Cris. Her house was an easy walk from the light rail station. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Cris provided coffee and pastries for breakfast, which was a nice touch.  Highly recommend."
3793790,42716723,2015-08-15,38275947,Colton,Chris was a great host!  Greeted me like family and was very friendly.  I didn't spend much time at the residence but my time there was comfortable and welcoming. 
3793790,43590809,2015-08-20,26591412,Casey,"Cris was very friendly and gracious. We arrived later than planned, but she was there to let us in and show us around before we went to bed. Very convenient location and great place to stay the night. "
3793790,44508936,2015-08-26,8235910,Michael,"Cris was wonderful to meet and very welcoming. The place is clean, comfortable, and as advertised. We stayed one night before flying out the next morning, and enjoyed being about an 8 minute walk from the light rail. Cris left us fresh fruit and pastries for the morning.

As noted in at least one other review, the last couple of blocks walking to the place are up a very steep hill. We're reasonably fit and were winded on arrival.

Tip: visit Tammy's Bakery by the light rail station. It's a nice Vietnamese market with a variety of food you can get to go. We got a delicious ham/egg/cilantro sandwich for $2.50.

We would definitely stay here again. Thanks Cris!"
3793790,44949837,2015-08-30,39869829,Derek,"They were very nice and we had a pleasant stay. They offered us muffins, OJ, cereal, etc for breakfast, that was very accommodating of them!
The only complaint we had is it was a little too hot in the house. Other than that, what a perfect experience!"
3793790,45672755,2015-09-05,37722598,Tom,"Staying here was perfect !! Cris couldn't have been any nicer or any more helpful during the stay and helped with any issues I had. The room was well sized and perfect. The location is a distance from Downtown, but is well connected by bus and light rail. If coming from SeaTac Airport, I'd recommend using Uber as it's much cheaper than a cab. I'd also avoid using light rail to/from the airport, as the house is up a large hill, something which I didn't check before hand !!

I would recommend staying here to anyone and when I eventually return to Seattle (which is a fantastic city), I would love to return here."

3793790,46020878,2015-09-07,35252525,Tammy,"It was nice staying with Cris! Her and her husband are very welcoming and they have a really nice, sweet small dog. The neighborhood is safe, convenient (there's a local grocery store), and I would stay there again the next time I visit Washington. It's right by the highway so it is easy to get into the city as well. They were also really nice by having food and drinks for the guests that visits them in case they get hungry or thirsty. They do provide body wash and shampoo as well if you forget to bring some. All in all, they were great. "
3793790,46923768,2015-09-14,33290008,Kaitlynn,Cris was so welcoming and made my boyfriend and I feel right at home! She also helped take care of dog for me while I was at work. I extended because I liked it so much. Location is easy access to the freeway 
3793790,47795635,2015-09-21,35296042,Taryn,"Cris was a spectacular host!!!  Her place was perfect and the room was just as described! She even ran out to help us with our luggage when we first arrived and when we departed. I really enjoyed the animal shaped towels and the coffee, fruit and pastries she provided every morning. The whole family was just lovely!  We couldn't be happier with our stay!  Thank you Cris!!! "
3793790,49193769,2015-10-01,658883,Assaf,"My brother and I felt very welcome. The experience was mellow, relaxing, and our hosts were very nice. Overall a great experience. "

There are always bread, fruit and drinks in the kitchen that are free to all guests. There are a lot of local eateries in the neighborhood that made getting food very convenient. Cris and Raul, thank you very much, welcome you to visit Hangzhou and China."

3793790,57327875,2015-12-24,50751439,Rebecca,"The Blossom Room was exactly what I needed : a soft spot to sleep, a safe place to stow my stuff. Cris and her husband provided the perfect spot for my business trip. They are friendly and kind, and I enjoyed talking to Cris when I returned to her house at night. I appreciated the breakfast and coffee options! Parking is ample. I envisioned myself using the treadmill, but with such long work days I didn't have the opportunity."
3939683,47516624,2015-09-19,37961835,Yuki,"This place was super nice. Location was good, facilities were all ok and host was so kind! 
I really like this place and recommend here!"
1063855,5581451,2013-07-07,5514028,Ingrid,"Our family of five had a really nice stay in Molly and her family's green house! Everything was spotlessly clean and wine, homemade (!) granolas and jam was there for us. But what we liked most about it was the garden filled with vegetables and berries (and we were allowed to eat from it:-) as well as getting the oportunity to live in a house where everything is made or planned with so much concern for design, natural materials and our ecological footprint.We are inspired to do some changes in our own home in Norway. 
The bus is right outside, so easy access to citycentre. We could park our car outside. 
Thank you again!"
1063855,15073689,2014-07-01,15008164,Shawna,"We loved staying at Molly's place in the Central District. Their home is very beautiful with tons of great, natural toys for my children to play with. The beds were very comfortable too. And, we love the coffee shop just a block away. It was the perfect place for us to stay while in Seattle with two little children. I would definitely stay here again!"
1063855,15544734,2014-07-11,16869762,Alex,Lovely house and a very helpful host!
1063855,16903104,2014-08-04,16775533,Ranjani,"House was like a little cabin! We really liked it.  Host Molly was so friendly and answered all my questions. Parking on the street was no problem at all!! We really enjoyed staying at Molly's house.  House had one queen bed and one bunk bed- beds were really comfortable.  If you open the window's you get a nice breeze! We felt really comfortable and safe in the house. We were out most of the day - just slept in the house! Any time I could call Molly and she answered right away! I really enjoyed spending morning ours in the porch with my kids.

Thank you Molly:)"
1063855,17498330,2014-08-13,2038743,Pierre Yves,"Great family house with vegetables garden, nice neighbourhood equally close to the lake and to downtown, very inspiring books and vibes."

Thank you for making our holiday even better with your house and your fantastic host skills! 
1063855,36701243,2015-06-30,3369927,Camille,"My in-laws had a wonderful stay at Molly's home.  It is a lovely house that is thoughtfully decorated and full of character, and they were quite comfortable.  We would definitely rent it again!"
1063855,38306431,2015-07-14,8119187,Terry,"Molly's house is charming. Perfectly located at a walking distance from shops, restaurants, bars, and Capitol Hill.
Molly provided detailed directions via email, which was perfect for me. I would strongly recommend staying at her place."
1063855,40353064,2015-07-30,35023629,Tamara,"Molly and her family went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. They left beer in the fridge and even offered us their perishable food items. Their home is comfortable, cozy and relaxing. "
1063855,41950335,2015-08-10,624825,Susan,Molly made us feel welcome. She was away when we arrived and left yet had contacted us to make sure all was set for us to get in the house. The location was good; we liked the neighborhood and felt safe  and the place clean. 
1063855,44566764,2015-08-27,182536,Kristopher,"We loved our stay at Molly's and felt right at home!  The neighborhood was perfect - within a few minutes walk to coffee, farmers market, and a wide variety of restaurants.  Molly was pleasant and easy to communicate with as well.  We had no trouble at all with parking and we were very happy to enjoy some delicious heirloom tomatoes from the garden."
8505421,48662310,2015-09-27,26518746,John,The neighbourhood was great.  Didn't rwalize the hospital was right there which was a little noisy from some sirens but not too bad.  
8090541,45758454,2015-09-05,36950858,Carly,"Bryce's is home was really beautiful and very clean. We made our reservation last minute, but he was so accommodating and had the place ready. I would recommend staying here to anyone! The neighborhood felt really safe, and was in a great location. We were close to everything!"
8090541,46222968,2015-09-08,22386870,Sierra,"Bryce's apartment was the perfect place to stay over Labor Day weekend! The three-story apartment was impressive -- everything was beautiful, modern, and clean. It was only a 10-minute Uber ride to Seattle Center.

Bryce was a responsive and considerate host. I highly recommend to anyone."
8090541,48765315,2015-09-28,1921937,Vanessa,"Bryce was geat. Very responsive and totallya ccomodating to all our needs, it was an absolute pleasure . His place is fantastic. Homey, charming, totally mdoern and it's got everything you need. The best part  is the location--capitol hill right where everything is at and still  on a quiet street so you can sleep well at night. We enjoyed staying over and I would recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle.

Thanks so much Bryce~!  You have a gorgeous place"
8090541,49684288,2015-10-05,1541295,Mike,As advertised.  Bryce seems to live in his townhouse and leave when it's rented.  The place was clean and centrally located.
8090541,50583037,2015-10-12,31111808,Stephen,"Bryce's condo was an amazing place to stay for the night!   Its a beautiful space and conveniently located to downtown.  We were within walking distance of excellent restaurants and bars near capital hill.  It's upscale, clean and Bryce was very easy to work with.  I'd highly recommend staying here to anyone.  (Also, the best southern style brunch in Seattle can be found at the Wandering Goose)"
1857141,8552510,2013-11-04,9706794,Jasmine,"My sorority sister and I stayed here for two nights and it was perfect for the two of us. The location is wonderful, we were in walking distance from great places to eat and shopping. Julia's place is really quaint and has a ton of quirky decorations that really made the atmosphere relaxed and welcoming. Julia was a wonderful host, she left a ton of tips and tricks about the apartment on her computer and she was readily available if we had any questions. My soror and I were really looking for a convenient place to stay and Julia definitely supplied us with a wonderful stay! "
1857141,11314525,2014-03-29,8013961,Chris,This is a cute little place right in Belltown. Julia was super easy to work with.
1857141,11966780,2014-04-20,3167019,Gerald,"Julia's studio is beautiful, clean, and in a great location in Belltown near downtown Seattle. Coffee shops, bars, restaurants are all close by to her place.

She's also very accommodating and quick to contact! I have nothing but compliments for her as a host."
1857141,12106072,2014-04-22,4460563,Taki,"This apartment was very well located in Belltown. I featured a kitchen, bathroom and double bed and was small but cozy. Communication was a little tricky and connecting with our host and meeting up was nerve racking as we had no clear address  at first and had to find wifi when the apartment intercom was not signposted. The apartment was  dusty and needed to be a little cleaner but not dirty per se. My sense was that it would work for someone looking for student type accommodation. Our host herself was very friendly. "
1857141,12193489,2014-04-25,8013961,Chris,I came to town for business and stayed at this cute little place. It is very centrally located and Julia is super easy to work with…
1857141,12259996,2014-04-27,3380821,Grace,"Julia's studio is indeed charming! It is located in an excellent and convenient area of town--perfect for getting around without a car. The studio is the perfect size for a couple, and features tons of cute furniture and tasteful artwork. Julia accommodated our last-minute reservation, and was very pleasant. 

My husband and I had a  generally very nice stay. My only criticism was the level of cleanliness. Nothing too distracting (I think a dog may live there), but enough that I thought it could use just a slight more detailing. Overall, it was convenient and well worth the stay! "
1857141,12306356,2014-04-28,4123020,Matt,Great location and across the street from an awesome cupcake bakery. I would definitely stay there again. Only a ten minute walk to light rail Westlake that runs to the airport.
1857141,13103238,2014-05-19,1572455,Melissa,We had a great time at Julia's- it was a fantastic location and she was very accommodating. 
1857141,13427326,2014-05-27,2839774,Wendy,"If you want to experience life as a local - well a young and active local...stay here!  This is a wonderfully placed studio in what must be an nearly historic building. It is ground level, excellent access to Pike's Market, the Seattle Center and countless restaurants and shops.  We loved it !  Some might find it well...""urban rustic"" !"
1857141,14282027,2014-06-16,14841461,Julia,"My husband and i really enjoyed our stay. The location was great, the studio was very comfortable and was perfect for us. We enjoyed the character that this place has, -- it really made us feel like we were staying at a house of a friend! Julia was super helpful, and very nice. Whenever back in Seattle, we would definitely try to book with Julia again!"
1857141,14431322,2014-06-19,8903875,Alexander,"Julia was very good at communicating with us. The place was definitely in the best spot right by all the great downtown amenities and restaurants. Pikes Market was just a 10 min walk away. As for the location it looked kinda run down from the hallway. As for the bedroom it was pretty clean. The only negative thing I was able to find was the bathroom, just be cautious about the shower you should bring slippers because it's quite dirty. We didn't use it ourself but just the only bad thing. Overall Julia was FANTASTIC and this is a perfect place to stay at if you wanna be in downtown!"
1857141,14495710,2014-06-20,89611,Peter,"Julia was great at communicating throughout our stay in Seattle. Her place is perfectly located in Belltown; close enough to walk to Pikes, but far enough to be away from all the traffic. A great host!"
1857141,14563084,2014-06-22,15369337,Nadia,Very cute apartment in a great location close to downtown in belltown. Communication was very smooth. Comfy bed and there's even netflix and amazon prime if you're feeling lazy! would recommend. 
1857141,14859641,2014-06-28,14456986,Jessica,"Julia was a great hostess. We were able to communicate easily with her via text messages to arrange check-in and check-out times that were mutually convenient. The apartment is small, but clean and well-maintained. The building is a little run-down. However, the location cannot be beat! It is within easy walking distance of downtown, but is a few blocks away so it is quiet at night. Would recommend!"
1857141,16156053,2014-07-22,17804481,Joseph,"This was my first stay through AirBnB and it couldn't of gone any better. Julia's place was a short walk from both Key Arena and Pikes market, and the rail station to the airport was right down the road. It couldn't of been in a better location. Julia was always very helpful and quick to respond through the whole process, I was new so I had a few questions. I got a good laugh out of the bathroom and fridge art, and once you sit in the couch you don't want to get up. This is the perfect spot if your looking for a place downtown and traveling with two.  Thanks for having us!"
1857141,18273324,2014-08-24,19803277,Frederic,"Julia was very nice to us. Godd communication and she answered quickly to our emails. The apartment is in a great location, lots of bars, restaurants and close to the space needle and EMP museum. You can't beat the location. But it just needs a good clean up. We had a lot of fun and we enjoyed our stay."
1857141,18390366,2014-08-25,8945013,Abigail,"Julia is awesome and her place is lovely! She made it super easy and seamless to arrive, and had everything nicely organized so we could immediately relax. Her place is in a super ideal location- close to the water, lots of restaurants within walking distance, and a little market across the street if you need any of the basics. I loved the way she has decorated, and everything was clean and tidy. The building was safe. I totally recommend her spot! "
1857141,18699028,2014-08-30,20209551,Siegrun,"We had a great stay at Julia's place. It was clean, had a comfortable bed, and we appreciated the coffee! Perfect location for waking around downtown."
1857141,18859003,2014-09-01,178199,Paul,"Great, clean place, exactly as advertised. Recommend!"
1857141,18932819,2014-09-02,18678098,Badriah,"This was a wonderful experience. Great host. Good location. Really couldn't have asked for anything more. After a long travel day this was perfect. Close to everything. If you're totally new to the city or revisiting, this place is ideal for either! Best airbnb stay yet! Thanks for everything Julia! You were a gem to work with and great communicating with. "
1857141,19256468,2014-09-08,21048324,Max,Great value in the heart of Seattle. Julia's place had everything you need (plus a few nice extras) and is in a great central location in Seattle. She was very accommodating and the apartment was very clean upon arrival. Would definitely recommend. 
1857141,19384676,2014-09-11,20496422,Michael,Great location and a great apartment. Super good experience.
1857141,19614208,2014-09-15,7075644,Joshua,"Can't recommend Julia and her awesome studio enough. It's literally walking distance from everything and was just as cozy and comfortable as the listing makes it sound. Julia herself was very welcoming even though we never got the chance to meet, but she made sure she promptly and accurately answered any and all questions my wife and I had about our stay. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking for a place downtown. Thanks again for your hospitality!"
1857141,19840286,2014-09-19,20093252,Brian,Host was very nice and friendly. Told us everything we needed to know about the place and let us be after. Didn't bother us and let us know to contact her with any questions or concerns. Provided us with fresh towels and sheets. Also let us use her shampoo and everything in her kitchen. Great experience!
1857141,20069635,2014-09-22,3806838,Lauren,"Julia's place was a nice size for two people, clean and comfortable, and the price was right. The area is great and right near the market and several bars/restaurants. Julia was friendly and helpful and made checkin/checkout a breeze. Would recommend it!"
1857141,25776475,2015-01-25,3355283,Bill,"The great: Julia. She's extremely accessible, provided great info about the area and was terrific to deal with. Also, the location is really nice - tons of excellent restaurants and Pike's Place within easy walking distance.

The so-so: Parking. On-street parking is limited (we ended up 4+ blocks away), and unless you want to park in a lot with no in/out privileges, you'll be stuck in 2 or 4 hour max locations between 8AM and 8PM. If you have the option to stay here without a car, take it.

The less-than-stellar: A couple items.

First up - cleanliness. We read this in other reviews before booking, and were hopeful it was simply others being more picky than us - but it's not. We'll even stay in a Motel6 on occasion without complaint. However, the apartment complex itself is absolutely filthy. Walking through the front door and down the dimly lit hall assaults several of your senses. Unfortunately, the apartment itself is also in serious need of a deep cleaning. Yes, it's tidy and uncluttered - and Julia's unique flair for decorations are indeed quaint and very pleasant. We loved the artwork. It has tons of potential, but it's not close to anything we'd term clean. Hairs in the bathtub. Toilet was dirty. Sticky floors/surfaces throughout. Dust everywhere.

Second up - heat and noise. There's a lone radiator in the unit with no functioning controls, and the place gets very warm. At first, we weren't concerned - we simply cracked open the window to bring the temps down. Trouble is, this is what causes the noise. The apartment complex itself is very quiet, but the buses and nightlife exist directly outside the only window that opens - making a good night's sleep near impossible. We finally decided the heat was the lesser evil, closed the window and slept on top of the bed - roasting and sweating in January.

In short - we'd not stay here again. However, it might very well be perfect for others; we've admittedly moved beyond the ""anything goes"" mentality we had has college students, and prefer accommodations that aren't so...rustic."
1857141,28718587,2015-03-29,19452485,Madeleine,"Julia was very accommodating about our arrival, I asked to arrive several hours earlier than planned and she made it happen. The apartment was just as adorable as pictured, and in a beautiful building. We had everything we needed here! Fantastic location, as well, I was able to walk around downtown, capital hill, and belltown and enjoyed all those areas. "
1857141,28897193,2015-03-31,25903556,Julia,Julia was very easy to coordinate with and made us feel very at home in the apartment. She even put together a helpful document of things about the apartment and suggestions of what to do around the area. She was also available via phone and email if we had any questions. The apartment is super cozy and well decorated and we had a very enjoyable stay. 
1857141,34348184,2015-06-07,2809369,Kelsey,"The apartment was great, with all the amenities anyone could need.  Julia is very open and makes you feel at home, welcome to use most anything in the place.  Walkability for the neighbourhood is great, with access to most activities you could possibly want.  We would definitely stay here again."
1857141,36451586,2015-06-28,33296690,Rebecca,"Julia was such a perfect host! She gave us very clear instructions for getting into the apartment, and when we arrived the place was extremely clean and neat. Any remaining questions we had, Julia had prepared a little visitor's guide for us! The decor was charming and the neighborhood was close to Pike Place! An overall excellent experience. "
1857141,48962411,2015-09-29,44964610,Blake,"Julia was so welcoming and provided a great experience for our first Airbnb stay. We were very impressed with available wifi, toiletries and kitchen amenities. Just what we needed for our trip (more than what we would have access to with anything hotels in the area). Location was fantastic, close to the market, museums and public transportation.  Would definatly stay again."

1857141,53213669,2015-11-06,2322897,Patrick & Reva,"Great neighborhood, great space and as described. If you want to avoid the humdrum of boring hotels, this is an ideal spot to see the sights of the city in a location central and walk-able. I would repeat! "

1857141,55397834,2015-12-01,10752080,Sunny,"So cute ! As a fellow studio resident in a major city (SF) I always love to see how other studios are set up and what creative storage solutions other people come up with. If you want to feel like a local in Seattle, this is the place for you. Great neighborhood and perfect location for walking to all the touristy and non touristy places. Julia was super easy to work with even though we never met in person. I would highly recommend this Airbnb location of you're in Seattle !"
1857141,55619498,2015-12-03,48245720,Kyunghee,"Julia's house was great location!
Near Westlake shopping Center and Macy's! Neighbors was kind and quiet.
Place was artistic and interested.
And while we stayed, she gave a fast feedback. Thanks Julia.

 일단 웨스트레이크 쇼핑센터와 멀지않은 거리에 위치해있어서 접근성은 좋지만, 여자 혼자 여행을 계획중이라면 다소 위험할수 있습니다. 집은 깨끗한 편입니다. 질문사항에 대한 답변은 빠른 편입니다."
1857141,57247497,2015-12-23,50751730,Erik,The apartment was clean and cozy and very well- situated adjacent to the downtown area. Truly walking distance from all of the major sites. Would strongly recommend!

So friendly and had great stories to share. Local knowledge local insight to the area. "
4760968,23934942,2014-12-14,17531456,Rebecca,"What a wonderful and welcoming house! I must admit, I was hardly there but while I was, Dan and his wife were wonderful hosts. I would definitely recommend them to friends visiting Seattle. 

Also, the view out the window in the morning was gorgeous."
4760968,24907651,2015-01-03,3005115,Theresa,We had a great experience. Daniel was welcoming and accomodating. Gave lots of good recommendations for bars and restaurants. Beautiful house with a cozy room. He even made us coffee in the morning. We would stay here again absolutely.
4760968,25376217,2015-01-13,25914579,Felicia,Great stay in Portland. The house is outside the city but very close to the light rail. Cute neighborhood and comfortable room. Dan and Laura were really welcoming and great hosts!
4760968,26345373,2015-02-09,22588128,Sina,"Thank you very much for this short stay in your beautiful house. It was better then in the description, especially your way to host us! Just from the start of our time in Seattle Daniel cared about our feelings, questions and needs. The room was clean and well prepared for us. We got snacks, water and flyers which we didn't need because of Daniels help. His tip for a asian restaurant was perfect and one of our highlights of the trip. The beautiful view from the room and the well selected furniture makes us feel relaxed at any time. Thank you very much for this stay. and we hope to come to you again!"
4760968,26462817,2015-02-13,9929895,Helen,"Daniel's space was exactly as advertised. It's a lovely character home close to the highway so it was very easy to get to by car from downtown and Bellvue. I met his housemate who was also friendly and welcoming too. The futon was so comfy that I didn't want to get out of bed! Daniel was great at responding to my emails, always prompt and detailed. I look forward to staying here again in the future!"
4760968,28040800,2015-03-16,18345115,Taylor,"This was the first American Airbnb and the experience was absolutely superb. I couldn't be happier. Both Daniel and Laura were super welcoming and engaging. I was given a wonderful tour of the house and location of where many necessary things were. I had full range of the kitchen and everything was very easy to find. The bedroom was huge and the futon was super comfortable. There was even a little snack basket and water waiting for us when we arrived. They also had an orca card that we could use while in the area. They were one of the best hosts that I have ever had, I enjoyed them so much that I will be coming back next week ;) "
4760968,28121973,2015-03-18,5035083,Rob,"Even though we didn't meet Daniel the contact with him was very smooth and he was very helpful. At his home we met his wife Laura and his housemate George. Both were very friendly around and Laura was welcoming and made sure to make us feel at home. Additionally, their place is really accommodating and only a short light rail ride from downtown Seattle away. Highly recommended for anyone!"
4760968,28358249,2015-03-22,18345115,Taylor,"This was my second time staying here, and the stay was just as pleasant as the first. We unfortunately missed each other through the short trip, but communicated well via text message. Everything worked out and I couldn't be happier. "
4760968,28489193,2015-03-24,23753916,Katherine,"Daniel was a very friendly host, showed us right away the accessibilities  around the house. The neighborhood is quite nice, and there is a supermarket right across the Beacon Hill Lightrail station!. Common area such as kitchen, living room, and the bathroom were clean. I really like this place, and would recommend Airbnbers to stay!"
4760968,28623595,2015-03-27,14346836,David,"Dan was great! He gave us lots of suggestions for our trip and was always prompt to reply. Couldn't ask for a better host. The room is beautiful and on a sunny day, the view is amazing."
4760968,28664632,2015-03-28,28655192,Teri,"I was in Seattle to sight-see ergo my schedule was non-existent.  Daniel was very flexible and maintained a high level of communication to ensure I would be welcomed. 
My rooms were just as stated in the listing. I had a large bedroom with a spectacular view. It was very clean, the bed quite comfortable and linens were laid out for my use. Daniel had a basket of Seattle information with a bus card that could be pre-load. How nice is that?
The house is a few blocks from a major bus line that got me into the city very quickly."
4760968,29115153,2015-04-04,23375076,Benedikt,Best host ever. All perfect. 
4760968,29400839,2015-04-07,23438092,Emily,"My friend and I had a wonderful stay with Daniel and Laura. They were extremely flexible with our early arrival/late departure times, prepared our room beautifully, and gave great advice on what bars/restaurants/neighborhoods to visit! I would love to stay with them again. They are wonderful people!"
4760968,29702673,2015-04-11,30448466,Thomas,"First time in the US and first time using Airbnb to compete for the World Aeropress Championship, so I had the pleasure of a very warm welcome by Daniel and Laura. The place is neat and clean and everything is done to make you feel at home. I had a nice stay at their place, the view is amazing and it's a handy location to reach the city center, some coffee shop or buy/eat food. I really enjoyed the night talks about travelling, coffee and languages. They are very easy-going and respectfull people."
4760968,29807944,2015-04-12,2657409,Juan,"Daniel & Laura were great hosts! Apart from their house, a 5 minute walk to Beacon Hill station with picture perfect mountain skyline views, they were very accommodating.

I was able to drop off my bags early and head out into town for the day; when I came back, the house was freshly cleaned.

They're a friendly group and have a huge table and common areas that were a perfect (and scenic!) workspace."
4760968,30176588,2015-04-18,21257763,Björn,"Daniel was a great, personable host! In addition to being accommodating and providing everything you could want from a b&b, his background in travel and local knowledge made for great conversation and insights about the area. "
4760968,30243145,2015-04-19,18674313,Elissa,"I absolutely loved staying with Dan and Laura at their adorable home in Seattle. They gave great directions on how to get there from the LINK station (a 3-minute walk) and were incredibly welcoming and sweet. My room was on the second floor with a separate key if I wished to use it, and they'd laid out a little folder of information about Seattle, their neighborhood, and maps of attractions. Although I wasn't able to take full advantage of their hospitality - I spent most of the afternoon and evening with local friends - I appreciated their attention when I was there, from their welcome basket of protein bars to the little Orca card I could load and use. The view from their home was beautiful and it was overall a 100% satisfactory experience."
4760968,30430776,2015-04-21,17762531,Chelsea,Stayed one night at Dan and Laura's beautiful home in North Beacon Hill. Location is prime! Wonderful views of the mountains. Sunrise is breathtaking while laying in bed (which is very soft and heavenly if that's what you prefer) Only a short walk to the light rail which is a great source of transportation into the city and other surrounding areas. Unfortunately didn't meet Laura but I'm sure she's just as hospitable and accommodating as Dan. We will be back in June! Thanks again 
4760968,31354174,2015-05-04,498207,Clemens Maria,"Before everything: Set your alarm clock to watch sun rise - this is thrilling, the view from the guest's room is amazing! But let's come to all the other great points: Daniel is an awesome host: We arrived quite late & he stayed up until midnight waiting for us.  The house is cosy and very close to a great neighborhood, perfect to visit SEA downtown and getting to/from the SEATAC airport. One more plus: Our host prepared 2 orca cards (public transport), some organic snacks, apples and so on. Totally glad to stay at this place - highly recommendable!"
4760968,31672348,2015-05-08,9166322,Denise,Daniel was a great host.  He had lots of great advice on things to do while I was in Seattle and the location is great.  He gave me great directions on how to get around and even provided a local transit card which was really helpful.
4760968,32072781,2015-05-13,21408584,David,"Nice quiet neighborhood, great stay with very helpful hosts.  Thanks"
4760968,32189139,2015-05-15,18713182,Carly,"Had a great 2 night stay at Dan and Laura's. When I arrived Dan showed me through local info, let me use the guest orca card and gave me some tips on sightseeing. He also showed me round the house meaning I felt settled as soon as I arrived. I ended up seeing great things in Seattle that I wouldn't have without their advice. When I returned in the evening they said 'welcome home' which made me feel really welcome. The house is great, kitchen well equipped, bathroom is close to bedroom, view is spectacular. Also thanks Dan and Laura for the healthy snacks in my room. Lovely people, great location near the light railway so easy to get to the airport or train station. Will defo stay again and recommend others to do the same."
4760968,32299629,2015-05-16,32184295,Sam,"We only stayed the night at Dan and Laura's, but they were great hosts. They gave us a ton of info on what to do in the area and had two Orca cards waiting for us. The apartment is beautiful and the view of the mountains from the room is great. It was very convenient to the light rail, which was really nice for our early morning flight. "
4760968,33002063,2015-05-24,16719136,Olivia,"A lovely place to stay. The location is superb! Daniel and Laura are lovely people who are sooo helpful with everything. They where so welcoming into their home, they made our Seattle experience a good one!"
4760968,33607698,2015-05-30,11040407,Nick,"Dan and Laura were very nice and easy to stay with.  They provided good recommendations for things to do, were very friendly and welcoming, and the house was as advertised!  I would certainly stay with them again. "
4760968,33781229,2015-06-01,3674390,Ally,"Dan was super flexible with our uncertain/changing arrival time, which we really appreciated. Also gave us great tips for exploring Seattle. The house is full of character and is in a good location. We really enjoyed our brief stay!"
4760968,34239023,2015-06-06,34153640,Dayanand,This was my first experience with Airbnb and it couldn't have gone any better. I was able to move in without any hassle and the location is very well connected. The room is very neat and tidy and has an incredible view. Both Daniel and Laura were very helpful in answering my questions and made me feel at home. A great start to my stay in Seattle! 
4760968,34329409,2015-06-07,1343253,Sue,"Great location a short walk to the light rail. Room is large and bed is comfy. We were able to leave our bag there when we arrived early. Daniel emailed us all the check in details well ahead of time. Didn't meet him but his wife was very friendly and helpful, gave us cards for the rail and a map of downtown and answered questions. Would recommend this place to anyone who wants to stay out of the busy downtown area."
4760968,34599152,2015-06-09,35004250,Christian,We enjoyed our stay and all expectations were met by Daniel and Laura. ORCA cards were also provided for our convenience.
4760968,34687424,2015-06-10,19931953,Hanna,Divine
4760968,35127213,2015-06-15,34022479,Eoghan,This was my first time using AirBnb and was a great experience! We arrived late into Seattle and Dan stayed up late to welcome us. We were made feel right at home and Dan also gave us some great tips and the use of two orca local travel cards! Accommodation was lovely and clean. Would definitely return if back in Seattle again
4760968,35567821,2015-06-20,1631151,Sandra,"Daniel and Laura were excellent hosts! The house is in a great location, it is clean, the room is spacious and comfortable. We were easily able to enjoy the local neighborhood or hop onto a train or bus and quickly get to downtown. Dan and Laura are very welcoming, fun, and enjoyable to talk with.  They gave us great tips of local events and places to go, we loved our trip in Seattle! Highly recommend staying with them."
4760968,35686303,2015-06-21,1936882,Kurt,We enjoyed a too short of stay at Daniel and Laura's house.  The location is perfect as it is very close to the light rail to take downtown.  Communication regarding check-in was excellent.  The nicely kept room was wonderful with a beautiful view and windows that offered a fresh summer breeze.  We would love to stay here again in the future!
4760968,36015204,2015-06-24,6284084,Petra,"It was perfect. Daniel and Laura were super nice, very helpful, had some very good tips and borrowed us some hiking stuff, which was very useful. The house is very pretty, with an amazing view from the bedroom they are offering. The neighborhood is as good as everything else, nice green area with cafes, the train station is only some blocks away. If we are coming back to Seattle we would love to stay there again. "
4760968,36197695,2015-06-26,14183,Joanna,"Daniel was fantastic. He was very communicative throughout the time leading up to our trip and was very helpful when we arrived. He provided a little ""guide book"" with nearby food/coffee/bars, and how to get to them. It also included places further away, and how to easily get to them. The house is right in the middle of Beacon Hill, so it was quick and easy to get downtown, or pretty much anywhere we wanted to go. 
The room was lovely and was stocked with some water and little snacks. Amazing view. 
The only drawback was the bed, which was a futon. For me it was fine, because I tend to nest my pillows and blankets and sleep in a ball, but if you have a bad back, please be aware that this is not a mattress. 
I would definitely stay here again. Daniel was a fantastic host."
4760968,36885451,2015-07-02,29832603,Alex,"Daniel and Laura were very hospitable. They were gracious hosts that offered plenty of recommendations on things to do, see, and eat. We will likely stay with them again when we return to Seattle! "
4760968,37498602,2015-07-07,35201405,Hubert, 地點很棒，很安靜，房東人很好。能夠提供你所需要的資訊，這是一個很棒很特別的行程。
4760968,37876495,2015-07-11,35523023,Paige,"Staying with Daniel and Laura was simple and easy!  Everything was exactly as described, it was easy to find, their house is gorgeous, and they are genuinely nice and caring people.  As this was my first AirBnB experience I was concerned we'd feel obliged to make conversation with strangers, but ultimately I wish I'd had more time in Seattle and more time to get to know them as they are wonderful and interesting people. :)"
4760968,39766567,2015-07-26,17636791,Michael,"We felt at home from the very first moment. Dan and Laura are a lovely couple delightful to talk with. The room is spacious with a nice view and a very comfy bed. We were allowed to use the kitchen and living room, too. The neighbourhood offers some nice restaurants and coffee bars. Downtown can be reached easily by public transport. We can highly recommend to stay with Dan and Laura. Thank you!"
4760968,40147089,2015-07-28,7982172,Tia,"This place is conveniently located in the Beacon Hill area near the light rail station.  If you are planning to go to a Mariners or Seahawks game you are only 2 stops away by light rail!  Pike Market is just 4 stops away.

Laura and Dan were friendly and easy to stay with.  They offered up great suggestions when asked.  

The bedroom is a nice size with a fairly comfortable Queen sized futon bed.  You get to wake up to a sunny mountain view.  

I would recommend this place to a single person or couple interested in staying in a quiet neighbourhood (with free parking) not far from downtown."
4760968,40363379,2015-07-30,13464140,Esteban,Daniel and Laura were very kind and considerate. The location of the place is so great and easy to get to everywhere. The environment nearby is quite and tidy. We did enjoyed a lot and will definetly visit Daniel's place again and bring him some special chinese tea as a gift :)
4760968,40522395,2015-07-31,4419318,Heidi,"I thoroughly enjoyed my quick 'in and out' visit at Daniel's place. In Seattle for business, I had little time to hang out but the room was bright and open, bed comfortable and sunrise spectacular (east facing).  It was a hot evening and the hosts gave me the larger fan and were very helpful in setting things up so the room was the most comfortable it could be. 

The home is in an up and coming neighborhood with super easy access to Downtown, the Stadium and Pioneer square on the train.

The only negatives I can see for folks considering this room are the amount of stairs (I didnt mind but you would want to be moblie) and the shared bathroom (but, again, the hosts were very accommodating).  

I will return."
4760968,40674589,2015-08-01,342532,Margie,"We took the train in, and were able to get to Dan's house via light rail very easily. The walk from the light rail is slightly downhill to the house, and the house is easy to find. Dan was very welcoming from the minute we arrived, and gave us a house tour as we chatted. The house is comfortable and surrounded by a beautiful garden, and of course, the view from the bedroom is amazing. There are stairs up to the house, and the bedroom is on the second floor. The bed was a little hard for my taste, but that is personal preference. Dan thoughtfully provided a fan for the room, which was definitely needed. He was also accessible via text, and reminded me of a restaurant that we had talked about, although I didn't get a chance to visit it. Thanks for everything!"
4760968,41746418,2015-08-09,25821052,Joshua,"Me and my brother stayed here for a week and had a great experience.  The house was clean and beautiful, and Laura, Dan, and their roommate George were awesome and helpful with everything.  It's right by a light rail station and there's a grocery store and restaurants a short walk away.   Very pleased with my stay here, hopefully it's available same time next year!"
4760968,42226462,2015-08-11,19531075,Zakary,"Listing was very accurate. Beautiful location, beautiful home. Bed was so comfortable. Would recommend to anyone! They even left snacks and fresh water in the room :)"
4760968,42407768,2015-08-13,28716872,Cassandra,"Daniel's place was really welcoming, and we loved staying here!  We were given so many amazing recommendations for things to do in the neighborhood, as well as the rest of the city. The room is just as pictured, and the bed is surprisingly comfortable. The shower is a bit hard to maneuver around, but everything else was so nice hat we didn't mind so much. We would definitely stay here again! "
4760968,43591103,2015-08-20,19108759,Alyssa,"This was a great place to stay! Daniel was very accommodating of my late arrival. The house was lovely and they left snacks, water and info about the neighborhood in the room for me"
4760968,44103656,2015-08-24,2315805,Olive,"Had a fab.fab time here, Laura is lovely and couldn't do more for us. We wanted to stay on our return but that wasn't possible for Laura."
4760968,44613756,2015-08-27,26303217,Peter,"The place is fantastic, easy to reach from downtown and with wonderful views of the sunrise. Laura was super and made sure I had all the information to know where to go in the city. Made for a great stay in Seattle! "
4760968,45362170,2015-09-02,26879826,Keiron,Daniel and Laura were terrific hosts and went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Their home was inviting and well set up and we were welcome to use the home as our own. Dan and Laura's home was a very short walk to the light rail and shops. 
4760968,46300959,2015-09-09,36042668,Maki,"Daniel and Laura were warm welcomed to me, I enjoyed having my time with them. 
They always tried to help and relaxing to me, I had a lot of wonderful memories. 
This place was easy to find, quiet, easy access to the airport and downtown, there were nice cafes around this area.
The room was just like advertised, the bed was comfortable for me and they offered snacks, fruits, water etc..
I highly recommend staying here.
"
4760968,47182929,2015-09-16,41970096,Tanya,"despite the fact that we never actually SAW each other dan and laura still made us feel welcome! they had a packet full of seattle info and maps, orca cards to use, and info about the surrounding neighbourhood. cute home, clean, easy to find and super close to the light rail station, and that makes it so easy to get to all the places we hoped to! neighbourhood is lovely, you have to go to ""the station"" coffeehouse 3 blocks from their house  or 1 block from the light rail station, so delicious!!! it was easy to stay there and dan is always super fast email responder. made our first time using airbnb very easy. thanks again! "
4760968,47531745,2015-09-20,15391094,Pia Olskær,"We had a great time staying at Daniels. The place was as described and he was friendly and kind. It was really usefull living so close too the lighttrain, because the travel by car in Seattle was super slow.
We would stay there again, the location was perfect for us."
4760968,47810815,2015-09-21,12582159,Tim,"Dan and Laura are indeed Super Hosts.We arrived at their home while they were away, but nonetheless felt comfortable and at home. As he says the house is full of character. This comes with an 100 year old house. (I have an old one too.)

• Communication was easy and smooth prior to our arrival.
• Entering the house was simple.
• Access to the city by public transit is very very simple and convenient.
• The house was clean and the room clean with a great view.
• Neighborhood felt safe and was very quiet.
"
4760968,48444104,2015-09-26,2530514,Charlie,"Daniel represents all that right with Airbnb. He is a conscientious host who approaches listing his space with the perfect balance of friendliness and professionalism. The room is lovely and comfortable. His proximity to light rail is perfect for exploring the city, and the neighborhood has good bars and restaurants should you care to stay close. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. "
4760968,48596759,2015-09-27,37443692,Alejandra,"Daniel communicated with us to make sure we were able to find his house and upon arrival he was very welcoming and gave us a house tour and answered our questions.  We also really enjoyed being able to  talk to both him and his wife, they are both very nice genuine people. Would love to stay here again!"
4760968,50374524,2015-10-11,2660927,Susan,Such a lovely place and very close to light station. Super good!
4760968,51102896,2015-10-17,7609730,Rosemary,"My mother was coming into town and needed a place to stay. By her accounts, everything was just great. Daniel was responsive, and the host was kind and welcoming. "
4760968,51640083,2015-10-22,45464625,Kurt,"Ich wusste, dass mein Gastgeber nicht anwesend sein wird. Der Empfang seiner Stellvertretung war freundlich. Die zwei Bewohner, die da einquartiert waren, waren positiv unaufdringlich. Das Haus befindet sich in einer sehr schönen, ruhigen Gegend, nahe an der Light Train Station, umgeben von kleinen Coffeeshops, Supermarkt und feinen kleinen Restaurants und Bars.
Zu Seattle selber ist zu sagen, dass der Aufenthalt selbst für Schweizer Verhältnisse unheimlich teuer ist. Soll noch jemand sagen, die Schweiz ist ein teures Land."
4760968,53306984,2015-11-07,11187838,Allen,"Daniel was a fantastic host! The home was fantastic and the room was very nicely done, offered me tea and snacks along with breakfast. Would definitely book again!"
4760968,54128537,2015-11-16,36862772,Emily,"We absolutely loved staying with Dan, I second every positive review written above and below and would totally book again/recommend a 100 per cent. As Seattle was the last stop on our Washington tour we hadn't researched it a lot but with the material on Seattle that Dan made available and his patient and elaborate replies to our (phone number hidden) questions, we had the best time :) the house is absolutely amazing, the room was probably the best Airbnb room I've ever stayed in (super comfortable bed and bedding too) and TOP location (especially its close vicinity to the local supermarket had us well stocked with American junk food and saved us expensive eateries in the city). Do book it! "
4760968,54576630,2015-11-22,19406827,Dominic & Oznur,"We had such a lovely time at Dan and Laura's home. They have a beautiful home in a quiet neighbourhood. The room itself has an amazing view and very cozy bed.

Dan was away, but we met Laura and she gave us some nice recommendations on things to do. We also had some of her delicious home made scones!

This is a really great place to stay and we highly recommend it. It's really easy to get into town, and Seattle itself is a beautiful city to explore. We just wish we could have stayed longer!"
4760968,54910933,2015-11-25,22466205,Christina,"Excellent stay. Great communication, beautiful home, great location and so accommodating. Highly recommend!"
281789,906016,2012-02-06,991433,Jina,"We arrived on a Friday night, and our host met us at the door, helped me with my bags, and gave us a little tour and handed us some information sheets including a map and some nearby places to go. There are nuts, fruit, and chocolates pretty much throughout the whole Inn. We stayed in the Topaz room, which had a queen bed and a twin-size bed, which was perfect since we were a party of three. The bathroom was plenty spacious, as was the room.

The breakfast was great. You get greeted with a glass of orange juice and you sit around a big table with other guests. Saturday morning we got an omelette with toast and grapes. Sunday it was oatmeal pancakes with berries, bananas, nuts, and whipped cream. And of course there is coffee, yogurt, nuts, etc. available as well no matter what's being served. The table is by a huge window, so be careful for that *one* seat that puts sun in your face. ;-)

The neighborhood is great. We were able to walk to a lot of things to do. We particularly like the Capitol Hill area because it reminds us of San Francisco (where we live). Great food, cool bars, and awesome shops.

I definitely will consider staying here again for future Seattle trips. Everyone was super polite and nice. Most of the guests were a bit older than us, but we didn't worry too much about fitting in. Just be quiet when you come in at night. Also, if you get the Topaz room, remember to shut the visor to the sunroof if you plan to sleep in a little bit. That sun will get you! ;-)"
281789,1250209,2012-05-08,2253598,Amy,"David was very gracious and helpful - he listened when I expressed concern about being a light sleeper in the apt below the kitchen, gave helpful maps and directions, and was great overall.  

Our room was the small apartment on the bottom floor in the back of the house - so tucked away and separate from the other guests.  It worked really well for us (as we are not morning people!!) and I would totally stay there again!  

The location and the neighborhood is unbeatable if you want ""real Seattle"" and not a tourist trap like down by the waterfront - but also close enough that we did walk downtown also."
281789,26052653,2015-02-02,5048912,Janet,"The 11th Ave. Inn is excellent and I will stay there again in a couple months on my return to Seattle.  David and his staff are professional and very helpful, without exception.  My room was great and the bed very comfortable.  The breakfasts prepared by Tomlinda and Albert were exceptional, although a low carb alternative offering every morning  would be quite helpful for us diabetics.  The Inn is furnished with period antiques that is like living in a museum. The location in Capital Hill is excellent with short walking distance to restaurants and stores.  I highly recommend this Inn.  "
281789,27050050,2015-02-24,25507915,Edith," A better place could not be found,
With signs of spring all around.
The delicious breakfasts were first rate,
And were offered for two hours straight.
The room was comfy and the help was friendly;
All in all we certainly felt like family.

3720731,17549184,2014-08-13,19856295,Cody,"This was my first AirBnB experience. John was very kind, professional, and accommodating. My friend and I needed a place close to downtown Seattle / Broadway street and John's home was in a great location- quiet street, felt safe, and was clean. The basement space provided had all amenities necessary for us. 
Overall great experience considering the expense, location and host!   "
3720731,17787290,2014-08-17,6582604,Mark,"What a lovely trip :) The standalone basement apartment set-up made it easy for us to come and go, and the neighborhood is nice and quiet yet convenient to major bus arteries.

John & Donna made the two of us feel very welcome. They were also very kind, supplying coffee and contacting their friend for tickets to a sold-out event for us.

If we come back to Seattle, we will certainly look into the place again!"
3720731,17902530,2014-08-18,8116742,Kelly,"This place was great! Perfect location in Capitol Hill with a short, scenic walk to the bus stop.

John was a nice and friendly host, and even provided a full list of information about the bus lines, attractions and things to do in Seattle. It was quite helpful.

Overall the apartment was comfortable and met all my needs while I was travelling."

The bed was super comfortable and the apartment was clean and nicely equipped and furnished.  Location was great for us as we wanted to do things close to downtown Seattle.  John was a very welcoming host and communication was easy and friendly.  This is a great bargain if you're looking for a place to stay in a safe and quiet neighborhood very close to downtown.  We would definitely stay here again and couldn't have been happier with our Airbnb experience.  Thanks so much John!
3720731,19394078,2014-09-11,2162670,Bill,"Great basement apartment with private entrance, clean and comfortable. And fantastic neighborhood, love Volunteer Park Cafe down the street from John's house"

We did not get a chance to meet John, our host, but he left clear instructions on accessing the apartment.

Basement apartment well equipped for  our short stay. Towels, linens and a very comfortable bed.  A bit dark- it is a basement apartment- but otherwise comfortable and quiet."
3720731,22213665,2014-11-01,22887292,Heidi,"John made us feel welcome...he answered the door with a big smile and helped to orient us to the place. We didn't realize how low the ceilings in the unit were, but after sleeping in the super spacious and ridiculously comfortable bed, who cares about ceilings! The neighborhood was quiet and beautiful and near bus stops , which was great for us, since we didn't have a car. We enjoyed our stay and would consider staying again."

3720731,28756584,2015-03-29,4698487,Melanie,Clean apartment in a very lovely residential area. An easy and pleasant walk takes you to the bustling hub of Capitol Hill and if you're feeling energetic you can even walk downtown through some really lovely neighborhoods. John was a great host and was willing to let me stop by in the morning to drop off my bag so I didn't have to lug it around. 
3720731,29777933,2015-04-12,872998,Sameer,"I had a great time staying at John's apartment.  John greeted me when and I arrived.  He spent time walking me through the apartment as well as giving me tips on public transportation and restaurants in the area.  The apartment is very close to the main hub of bars and restaurants in Capitol Hill.  It's a short walk to the #10 bus, which takes you downtown.  If you have a car, there is plenty of street parking available.  If you need to stay in a place that is centrally located, is clean and comfortable, you will be hard pressed to find anything better.  "
3720731,30626189,2015-04-25,30071215,Aubrey,John was a great host and the apartment was a perfect place to stay. The accommodations were exactly as described and the apartment had everything we needed. The neighborhood was absolutely beautiful and provided central access to all we had planned.

He was very open and communicative during our entire stay. The basement apartment is very cozy with all the necessary amenities for a few nights stay. Convenient location as it was a short walk to both the 10 and 48 bus that takes you down two of the main shopping / dining areas in Capitol Hill and even further if you wanted to go downtown. Beautiful and peaceful neighborhood, would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking stay in Seattle! "

My friend and I made the basement apartment our home for the weekend of the Seattle Rock n Roll marathon, and it was a great place to stay. The bed was SUPER comfortable--which was really important to these two running women. 

The neighborhood was nice and quiet, just about a mile away from restaurants, bars and shopping. The cutest a coffee shop is just half a mile away. John is a friendly and accommodating host, willing to give recommendations and help make your stay in Seattle the best.

A warning: don't take the 70 bus line to get there. You'll have to walk up ~20 flights of stairs, which is great for working out, but not so much if you have lots of stuff!"
3720731,35430239,2015-06-18,34714761,Shannon,This was our first Air BnB experience and John was great! He let us check in early and showed us everything about the apartment.

I loved the soft carpet in the hallways. The beautiful decor showed the personality and style of the owners. The house was completely modern and at the same time cozy. Close to PCC AND Whole Foods and extremely convenient to travel to the city (only 10 min away) The hosts were welcoming and super sweet. To summarize: Heavenly."

From the home you can walk to excellent dining or drive a few minutes to pick up a great bite to eat - and there are all sorts of cuisine available.  If you don't want to go out, the home is incredibly comfortable and well-maintained.  Everything you need is in the kitchen and the hosts have left simple instructions for you.

It was a quick walk from the house to Green Lake for a nice walk and picnic lakeside.

Ryan's communication was excellent in signing on and other questions.  He was welcoming but with details orientated answers.  We were thoroughly pleased with the home, lovely and very functional.  Met Ashley, his wife, who shared ""this and that's"" about front door key particulars etc.. those needed but with trusting leeway. We highly recommend this home with no reservations.  Lynne"
4122325,39724482,2015-07-26,25554537,Lynn,"

This was our first time going through Airbnb and it was a very positive experience.  Ryan's home was perfect for our family vacation.  Our family consists of two adults and two teenagers (ages 18 and 17) and we had plenty of space to all have our own bedrooms but still a small enough home that made it very cozy where we could spend quality time together.  
The gourmet kitchen was beautifully appointed which made cooking several meals fun and easy.  In addition, we appreciated the many small touches such as the soft bath towels and the organic sweet smelling hand soaps.  The residential location was great and we were able to walk to the local coffee shop and restaurants and spend beautiful mornings walking around Green Lake.  Grocery stores are an easy 5-10 minute drive from the house and it's easy access to both I-5 and I-99. This home would be great for small families like ours wanting to take a campus visit to the University of Washington or explore the many sights of Seattle.  We would stay here again without hesitation."

Ryan's communication was extremely prompt and clear. He also left a nice list of recommend restaurants and activities nearby which was helpful.

I definitely recommend this listing and Ryan as a host. We felt very welcome at this house.

oh, and I forgot my running clothes hanging in the bathroom  which Ryan was kind enough to remind me of immediately and made arrangements for me to get them back."
4122325,47846178,2015-09-21,43880230,Jamie,"Our favorite part of visiting Seattle was having the comforts of this home. Ryan's accommodations allowed us to park off street and escape the pace of the city without being crammed into a hotel room.
Ryan is very efficient with his communications. He made sure we had contact info, and assured us he was available if we needed anything. The description of the home, and instructions for using amenities were spot on. We all slept well on their comfy beds! They really put a lot of thought into anticipating what we would need, from easy access to linen to providing maps and local business information. Well done! Our only regret is we did not have the time to enjoy the back yard. The only complaint my husband had was he could not get comfortable on the sofa.
  Thank you so much for sharing your comforts with us. "
4122325,49539700,2015-10-04,9071624,Susan,"This home is fantastic!  It is better than advertised.  It is simply yet tastefully decorated, very comfortable and inviting, great kitchen and a perfect location.  We loved this home and did not want to leave.  The owners were easy to communicate with, were very accommodating to our later arrival time, and quit friendly in every correspondence. I highly recommend this home.  There was absolutely nothing at all wrong with this home.  In fact, it was spotless with not one speck of dust! Every item in the home was beautiful, interesting, and placed perfectly. I tool photographs to inspire some changes to make in my own home.  If you are able, stay here!"
4122325,51204321,2015-10-18,38101897,David,Great spot - exactly as described.  Very cozy but lots of good design and flow to the space.  Its tipping towards Greenwood rather than Greenlake but truly close to lots of things.  Hosts were great too!

7462428,41008469,2015-08-03,4173973,Mary Anne,"HOST: Patrice was a fantastic host! Everything was clean and well-prepared upon arrival.  She kept to herself yet was easy to contact.  We ended up seeing a play together later in the week.  Gotta love folks who support the Arts!  (I didn't get a chance to meet her son Gabe, but apparently he was there the first night of my stay.  Quietest teen ever!)

ROOM: Small, cute, and furnished with drawers, a writing desk and plenty of room in the adjoining closet to hang things.

'HOOD: The neighborhood was green, clean, and the #2 bus gave me easy access to hip Capitol Hill and Downtown.  There's not much in the immediate area as far as dining or bars and it should be noted that there is a playground across the street."
7462428,44371723,2015-08-25,8708740,Ana,"Patrice was a great host! Kind, accommodating and was very welcoming. The room was very comfortable and clean. Her house feels like a home from home the moment you walk in. The location is great as it's just a bus ride to downtown and it's is a safe and quiet neighbourhood. I can definitely recommend this place for anyone visiting this great city. "
7462428,44503411,2015-08-26,6891584,Remi,"She has warm personality and the house is located calm and beautiful neighborhood.
about 15-20mins from very central downtown by bus, Roue No.2.
room, bathroom, key system and WIFI condition are very nice, no stress.
Excelent host :-)
thank you so much, Patrice!!
I will come back when I have chance to come Seattle again. 
"
7462428,44950154,2015-08-30,21091103,Katharina,Best stay! Patrice is a very kind person and it was a pleasure staying at her place! 
7462428,47708198,2015-09-21,8161113,Lisa,Partice and her son Gabriel are great and very sweet hosts. They made me feel home from the first day and helped me whenever I needed something. I can highly recommend everybody to stay with them. And whenever I'm back in Seattle I hope they have a free spot for me. Thank you two for everything. 
7462428,48433243,2015-09-26,11080147,Mary,Patrice was a good host. House was clean and well cared for . Nice family
7462428,48640149,2015-09-27,7872133,Nicole,"My stay in Seattle was very busy so I did not get the opportunity to visit with Patrice all that much, but I did find her to be very friendly when we did cross paths.
 
I found the location to be great. It was nice to be close to downtown and Lake Washington. Patrice has lots of helpful visitor information in the room.

I found the bed to be quite soft, which isn't a knock on the accommodations, it's just as a firm bed sleeper it wasn't ideal for me. 

Overall, a great place to stay."
7462428,50187703,2015-10-10,2698787,Marion,"A very nice, comfortable room in a beautiful house, in a quieter neighborhood but with nice shops and eateries a couple blocks away (on 34th), and with excellent transit. Patrice was very friendly and helpful, and welcomed me with beautiful flowers in my room. A couple of days before I was scheduled to arrive, she was called away unexpectedly, but rather than cancel, she was kind enough to let me stay anyway. That was much appreciated!"
7462428,50652247,2015-10-13,13860828,Grace,Patrice was not there when I arrived but she gave me information as to how to get into the house.  I had a little trouble with the key box so for me it would have been helpful if more instruction was provided. Once Patrice arrived she was very friendly and accommodating.  
4410789,25067092,2015-01-05,6607718,Ben,Great location and beautiful apartment.  Would recommend to anyone!
4410789,25291985,2015-01-11,24323461,Mark,"Overall, it was a nice location and a comfortable place for two people who wanted separate bedrooms and bathrooms.  A couple of exceptions, though: The current pictures must be from another unit in the same building because that's definitely not the unit we stayed at.  Also, there were long, long hairs right in the middle of the top sheet on my bed.  Yuck!  It made me wonder if the sheets had even been cleaned because they were so apparent, so I put them through the wash myself.  My bathroom had a similar hair infestation, mostly in the shower.  Not too terrible, but since I'm being charged a $125 ""cleaning fee"" I expect a really clean place when I arrive.  And even with that fee, they ask that you empty your own garbage when you leave.  The instructions for connecting to the internet were incorrect (maybe it's for the other unit in the building?) but the helpful people over the phone got me up and running soon enough with the right ID and password."
4410789,25550790,2015-01-19,22093010,Genevieve,"The unit was beautifully furnished and roomy. The location of the unit was very convenient for tourists in Seattle. It was less than a mile to Pike Place Market and the Space Needle, as well as the Pacific Science Center. The neighborhood was hip, plenty of restaurants to dine in and even a market on the corner. However, while the unit was heated, it was not central, each bedroom and the living room had individual thermostats. All in all, a very pleasant stay. I would recommend this place. "
4410789,25884822,2015-01-28,26107693,Eric,The apartment was great and very well located.  It was easy to get into and was clean upon arrival.  The pictures need to be updated on the listing as it looks a bit different but overall the layout/concept was accurate.  I used it while in town for business and would do so again.
4410789,27175139,2015-02-27,9833936,Lisa,"Wonderful apt located conveniently in heart of Seattle.  Check in and check out was fast and easy, and the apartment itself was better than the nicest hotels in the area.  Many thanks for the fabulous stay!"
4410789,29518812,2015-04-08,29522376,Caroline,"Our stay was very pleasant and the condo was well equipped with all the essentials. The beds were soft, lots of pillows, extra blankets, and even a pack-n-play for our baby. Kitchen had all the essentials for cooking including different sized pots, baking dishes/pans, mixing bowls, blender, coffee maker, toaster, tea kettle, etc. The furnishings were of very nice quality. Thanks for a worry-free 5-day stay!"
4410789,33102856,2015-05-25,30561306,Peter,"Jordan is a great host. Very quick to respond and helpful for a first timer like myself with Airbnb. The Condo was very nice, very comfortable and locate in a great downtown area within walking distance to most attractions and many good restaurants. I will stay at this condo again next time we are back in Seattle.

Thank you!

4410789,33858490,2015-06-01,33897961,Valerie,"We didn't get a chance to meet Jordan, but the unit was nice and as expected.  Liked having the comprehensive guide in the unit with all the rental and area information.  The location and neighborhood is very conveniently located, with lots of bars and restaurants nearby, especially on 2nd Ave.  "
4410789,34269619,2015-06-07,7865872,Fiona,"Amazing apartment, great location & easy to check in & check out. Perfect all round. "
4410789,40223224,2015-07-29,16611775,Megan,"Our stay at the Shelby was wonderful.  The apt is in a great location allowing us to either walk or take buses to all over Seattle. All six of us slept well each night as the beds were comfortable, the bathrooms very clean and spacious, and the kitchen area was well stocked.  Once we got the StayAlfred system figured out we were able to get in and out quite easily.  It was a great experience for all 6 of us."
4410789,41731980,2015-08-09,36468,Jonathan,"It was a joy staying at Jordan's Belltown apartment, checkin was a breeze and the available parking was an added bonus. The apartment was clean and everything was easily accessible. The area had everything we needed and was quiet at night. Checkout was also very simple."
4410789,46557610,2015-09-11,2749885,Paul,Self service process suits me well. We got in late after 10pm so it was great. Minor hiccup with keys not working but that was resolved the next day. Fast Wifi - always important. Good communication. Customer service by phone was good. The service agent was friendly and eager to help. 
4410789,47698371,2015-09-21,39299557,Sharon,"The location was perfect!  Within walking distance to the Space Needle and Pikes Place. Having a fitness center , washer and Dryer was awesome too. A few things that could be improved: the initial code for the lock box did not work. Called the toll free number for assistance and they could not help as they gave me the same number. Figured maybe it was a typo and so tried a different combination  of numbers and voila- we hacked in. The. all of the keys for the front door a stuck and did not seem to work. There is a trick to pull in the door slightly. Thought it was an alignment problem with the deadbolt but it seems to be a problem with th locking mechanism. Also don't think it's right that there is only enough paper towels and toilet paper for 'a few days'. With  the price of the condo, would think the least that could be provided would be enough toiletries to last the stay. Other than that, a wonderful stay! "
4410789,53386356,2015-11-08,29238476,Aditya,"Fantastic host. Easy to communicate with, accommodating, and friendly. Couldn't ask for anything more; very solution oriented to any issues I had.  

The location was fantastic and easily accessible by all modes of transit."
4410789,54405627,2015-11-19,17426663,Rimpal,"Good neighborhood, listing was as described. Convenient, clean and spacious. The apartment was nice, there were two issues though: the garage clicker was not working, making it difficult to come and go. The internet also was not working for 2 days. Other than that the location was ideal, the apartment had a nice layout."
8061699,46648932,2015-09-12,38410884,Lisa,"The room was pleasant and looks just like the picture.  There is a big closet with a place for clothes.  I like a chilly room, so the window fan was a plus.  Seattle weather is warm during the day and cool at night, so the fan was perfect.  Diana has a lovely home, and she is welcoming.  Street parking is no problem.  There is a Safeway a block away for groceries and coffee and a cute shopping area  10 short blocks away.  "
2749725,12301755,2014-04-28,862971,Clint,Really great location. Awesome and clean apartment. It was super easy to coordinate with Thomas. Free parking in such a busy area was extraordinary. I would definitely stay here again.
2749725,13219104,2014-05-22,7433856,Isabelle,"This was such an excellent place to stay. Thomas was really responsive as was the woman who passed along our keys, Elizabeth. They were both incredibly accommodating and Elizabeth really took the time to go over everything we'd need to know about the apartment. Aside from that, this apartment was awesome: central location, clean, comfortable, stylish, and the rooftop deck was amazing. As someone who'd never been to Seattle, this was an exceptional first visit."
2749725,13702504,2014-06-02,15501842,Jim,"Where does one start with Thomas' apartment? Shall I begin with the lovely Elizabeth, whose generosity and humor make for such a welcoming experience? Or with the absolutely gorgeous rooftop deck looking out on the bay? Or perhaps the fully stocked kitchen? Or the record player? Or the records themselves? No, I can't do them justice. I'll merely give a few vignettes of my girlfriend's and mine weekend in Seattle, with Thomas' lovely flat as focal point.

As I said, Thomas employs a local ambassador to help set everything up and distribute keys. Elizabeth is a joy: very easy to get into touch with; responsive to any requests; down-to-earth, good people.

The apartment is light and airy. The location is perfect, just blocks from all major landmarks, and within a stone's throw of the best Seattle eateries. God I gained so much weight.

Upon check-in, an excellent bottle of wine and flowers greet you. Thomas' record collection is eclectic and fun: Cyndi Lauper, Ozzie Osbourne, and The Cars, I seem to recall. Thomas also hangs some of his original artwork about the place: the fracturing of female beauty makes an excellent backdrop to a romantic weekend in the city.

The toilet and facilities are excellent. I can't remember a better shower head, as it turns out. The bed is large and the foam mattress keeps your partner's movements well muffled.

STAY HERE if you want to experience the Seattlest of Seattles. Just wonderful."
2749725,13962761,2014-06-09,79062,Ann & Jeff,"Outstanding location, outstanding apartment—a truly incredible experience. I want to come and live here for a month!"
2749725,15272002,2014-07-06,9954799,Lina,"Thomas was a great host and we loved our stay at his spacious apartment. We primarily communicated with Elizabeth, who helps him manage the space. We really appreciated Elizabeth's flexibility since we had a late check-in of 10:30 PM. She was really nice and gave us a tour of the place and the beautiful rooftop area when we arrived.

The location is amazing because it's super close to all the shops and to Pike Place and the waterfront. Very easy to get around on foot, which was great since we didn't have a car. Would definitely stay again!"
2749725,15500676,2014-07-10,16616354,Jeannine,"This spacious apartment was a great place to stay.  It's in a great location, only a block away from the Pike Place Market, and right in the center of downtown Seattle.  The check-in process was very easy, Elizabeth was very friendly, flexible with the check-in time, gave a great overview of the apartment, and suggested restaurants in the area to try. The apartment has a great style, and an awesome record collection for perusal/use. 

 There is parking available a few blocks away, which was essential since I had a car.   One of the best perks of this space is the rooftop deck that is available to use.  It offers a great view of the seattle skyline, and the waterfront.  I would definitely reccomend staying here!"
2749725,15826414,2014-07-16,1664673,Marie,"Great place! A block away from the Pike market, a few blocks away from the sculpture park and Capitol Hill. The perfect spot to discover Seattle. Elizabeth was extremely helpful and we loved the places she recommended. And, last but not least, the view from the rooftop is STUNNING! "
2749725,16199467,2014-07-23,14143134,David,"My first time using Airbnb to book a place to stay: 
-Location was Fantastic
-Plenty of towels and bedding
-Place was clean
-Thomas and Elizabeth both were very responsive
-Elizabeth was friendly and helpful in accommodating us.
-Would book again"
2749725,19413234,2014-09-12,18222177,Subhash,Good host. Communication was perfect with all details and local host greeted us at door with a wine bottle. Local host Elisabeth made sure that we were comfortable in this place and provided all necessary details required to stay and park our car in garage.
2749725,19727585,2014-09-17,17763995,Weston,"Amazing experience. This was my first time using AirBnB and I am beyond satisfied with how everything worked out. 

To start, my girlfriend and I arrived early for check-in on the day we were scheduled and Elizabeth (Thomas' helper with the space since he travels a lot) met us with flowers from the market in hand to greet us with a smile. What a pleasant way to welcome two complete strangers to a new city! She proceeded to give us the keys, a quick tour of the place, and some recommendations on where to go to sight-see/eat/hang. Also, Thomas left a bottle of his favorite wine for us which was a crazy awesome gesture (the wine was incredible, thank you much Thomas for the kindness). 

As to the place, completely clean, spacious, and convenient. Thomas leaves a few notes on how to use his record player and take care of other important things if necessary during your stay. This place is in the heart of downtown right next to Pike Place Market, which was great for us as we frequented the market for fresh seafood, veggies, fruits, etc. to cook meals in. Also we were super close to a massive selection of great restaurants, walkable alleys, music venues, and only a short ride (10-15 min) from many other neighborhoods/parks we wanted to check out. 

Quick note about my favorite part of the place - ROOFTOP DECK. The lady and myself spent a few mornings and evenings here, enjoying an INCREDIBLE view of the water/mountains/Rainier/skyline. At night it's crazy cool as the ferris wheel lights up, providing a cool light show to complement the lights of the city surrounding you. Quite romantic and relaxing. 

The best part of this location is you have multiple options when it comes to whether you'd like to walk around downtown, take a quick ride to other attractions, restaurants/bars, or parks. We did stay in on one of the nights to cook our own meal of fresh seafood, and the kitchen had more than enough cookware for us to use (boiling a whole crab, sauteed shrimp/asparagus, melted butter, sliced fruit). We paired this food with the wine Thomas left us and it was nice to just chill in the pad. 

If I haven't convinced you yet to stay here, then you've read too many reviews on too many places. Do yourself a favor, stop reading other reviews on other places and just book with Thomas. He and Elizabeth will make your stay in Seattle fantastic.

Thank you both for such a great experience. If we return in the future, we'll definitely contact you again. Take care!

2749725,20185594,2014-09-25,14685088,Laura,We were warmly welcomed by our host who settled us in swiftly so we could take immediate advantage of the excellent location and get down to Pike Place Market and start enjoying ourselves. The apartment was exactly as advertised and check in and out couldn't have been easier. It was an ideal location for our five day stay and we really made the most of the stunning roof terrace as well. Thanks so much for a great stay. We would highly recommend the apartment and our host.
2749725,20493369,2014-09-30,9263771,Quinn,"I had a great stay at Thomas' place. Great location, spacious suite and rooftop patio is amazing. He was very kind and I highly recommend this stay!"
2749725,22502566,2014-11-08,22756808,Lisa,"We got in really late after a flight from the East Coast and picking up a rental car. We had prearranged our late arrival with Alicia, Thomas's friend. She was very helpful, flexible and welcoming . As a thoughtful gesture Thomas had left flowers from the market and a bottle of wine . The apartment itself is  accurately represented in the photos online. We found the location to be ideal . Since  we had a rental car for the rest of our trip down the coast the included parking was a dealmaker."
2749725,28324268,2015-03-22,3683433,Chris,"It was fun to be right in the middle of so much Seattle has to offer - the Market, waterfront, downtown core, etc.  The view from the apartment itself is of 1st Avenue and we enjoyed watching the construction activity.  The view from the rooftop terrace even includes Mt. Rainier, what a lovely surprise.


"
2749725,29285149,2015-04-06,13711667,Nikola,"Everything was great. There's a construction site accross the street, but that didn't bother me."
2749725,29914937,2015-04-14,21171360,Jean,"What a great place to stay in Seattle!  I normally stay in hotels and wanted to try the airbnb hype this time.  I was there for a 7 day conference in Seattle.  More space,  more flexibility and more privacy than a hotel!
The apartment is located inside the Pike place market so everything is really at your feet... With a stunning roofdeck and a great reception Thomas' place is worth every penny.
Enjoy it"
2749725,30450766,2015-04-22,28750618,Sarah,"We had a great time staying in Thomas' Pike Place apartment. We were welcomed into his home with a bottle of wine and fresh flowers. His place is within walking distance of everything you'll want to see downtown- Pike Place, the convention center, shopping, museums, etc. Having a parking space was a great amenity for the days we got out of the city. Alicia, his property manager, was super sweet, helped us get settled in, and directed us to some great restaurants and bars. Our absolute favorite part of this place was the roof top deck which we enjoyed the sunset from almost every night!

There was some construction occurring across the street, so bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper who enjoys sleeping in during the weekdays. They are usually up and running a little after 7am, but seemed to start later or not work at all on the weekends. I managed to tune it out, but it drove my wife a little nuts at times :P"
2749725,33776906,2015-06-01,10475666,Heather,Great neighborhood but a little noisy. Thomas made us feel welcome with coffee and a bottle of wine. 
2749725,35065207,2015-06-15,27956837,Kellsie,"My boyfriend and I had a great time in Seattle! This apartment is perfectly located! We walked all over the place. We also rented a car, which we were able to park in the garage two blocks away. Super convenient that Thomas has a parking pass for his guests! The roof access is awesome, the view is beautiful and is set up really well with chairs and tables. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who hasn't been to Seattle before and also to people who have been before. We can't wait to come back!"
2749725,35906662,2015-06-23,14544090,Drew,Thomas met me on time and showed me everything I needed for my stay. The apartment is great and the location can't be beat in Seattle. He even let me stay late on my checkout date to accommodate my late flight. Highly recommended. 
2749725,49795608,2015-10-06,30147563,Rob,Alicia met us and gave us the tour and was very helpful with advice and questions!
2749725,51286536,2015-10-19,25607011,Kelsey,"My Husband and I came to Seattle on a surprise trip for his Birthday. He was extremely surprised and enjoyed staying at Thomas' well located apartment. The best feature would definitely have to be the roof top deck, you have an amazing view of the entire city. Thomas and Alicia made our stay extremely comfortable and were receptive to any questions we had. We would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone we know!"
4936647,25483536,2015-01-17,25908383,Elsa,Robin & family were very welcoming. The bed and room were comfortable and private.  I will be staying there again!
4936647,28526815,2015-03-25,14723479,Rachel,"Beautiful neighborhood very close to Hwy 99/Aurora making it easy access to downtown,airport, and I-5. Description was accurate, and Robin was very kind to allow us to arrive late night from airport."
4936647,29367377,2015-04-06,1441556,Marvin,"Robin was a fantastic host for my family. The location of her home is just 15 minutes north of Seattle's city center. It's just a short walk to a beautiful beach park where we watched the sun set each night. Her backyard is a delightful garden complete with a chicken coop and tree swing that my kids (both under 12) loved.  The accommodations are in the basement of her home with a private back entrance. They were nicely decorated, comfortable to sleep in, and its really kid friendly (locks, outlet covers, and even a changing table - though we didn't use it).

Robin was also very helpful in providing directions to the park, and making local recommendations on where to go. My only suggestion would be for them to have Wi-Fi access set-up for guests, especially since the cell-phone reception is not very good from their home.

Needless to say, I would definitely stay here again. "
4936647,29891585,2015-04-13,10645156,Corina,"We had a lovely time visiting. The space is very kid friendly. The set-up is inviting. The neighborhood is pleasant and quite walkable. The beds were comfy, and the library was excellent! Robin and her family were very hospitable. We will definitely add this to the list of great places to stay in Seattle!"
4936647,30843279,2015-04-27,31740874,司(Tom),"We stayed Robin's house for Seattle trip with 4 of my friends.
Robin & family are warm hart and very kindly as they not only provided us with Seattle recommended spots and directions(and They even research for us Seattle's parking situation as well), but also They provided us with neighborhood Carkeek Park.
And She taught lots of things around there politely for us even I spoke clumsy English.

According to their recommendation, We went to the beach in neighbor Carkeek Park in the evening.The beach was awesome. We enjoyed to see not only Sunset, but also running train along the beach. It was ... very nice view and It was enough us to decide to change our other evening plans to laying on the beach and on the lawn in the park.
Accommodations are the first floor of their house, but the first floor and the second floor was totally separately and we used private back entrance. We also use private Kitchen, shower/toilet and bedrooms on the first floor. Although, Our five people stayed there, the space was more than enough. We all were able to spend a very relaxing time.

In this Our Seattle trip, We can also touch the nature, not only downtown spots for tourist. And we were able to spend time in feeling comfortable. I think that it was because we stayed in Robin's house.
Thank you so much. I'm going go back to your place some day again!

今回、友人5人のシアトル旅行にRobinのお家を利用させていただきました。Robinはとても親切で、シアトルのオススメスポットや行き方(シアトル周辺の駐車場事情なども、私たちの為に調べてくれました)、また、近所のCarkeekPark の説明を地図付きで提供してくれ、私のつたない英語の質問にも丁寧に答えてくれました。
彼らの子供も、とても人懐っこい子供達で、到着の際、裏庭で少し一緒に遊ばせてもらいましたが、可愛くて天使のような子達でした。

説明していただいた通り、Carkeek Parkのビーチにいってみましたが、Sunsetだけでなくビーチ沿いを走る列車の往来も楽しむことができ、とても素敵なところでした。夕方の予定をキャンセルして、ビーチや近くの芝生の上でだらだら過ごすことを決めてしまった程に。

宿泊スペースは彼らの家の一階ですが、1階と2階は完全に区切られたスペース（入り口も別々）になっており、とても広くプライベートな空間です。私たち専用のキッチン、バスルーム/トイレ、ベッドルームが全て1階にありました。今回は5人で宿泊させていただきましたが、それでも十分過ぎるスペースがあり、とてもリラックスした時間を過ごすことができました。
今回のシアトル旅行で、ダウンタウン観光だけでなく、自然にも触れることができ、ゆったりとした時間を過ごせたのはRobinのお家に泊まらせていただいたからこそだったと思います。また、是非泊まりにいきたいです！"
4936647,31232740,2015-05-03,1834995,Elvira,"Robin and family were so amazing! The place itself is as if your walking into a nature conservatory. The basement was clean and beautiful. My 7 year old son enjoyed the toys/ hanging chair! There were a total of 7 of us and plenty of sleeping room. I would recommend and come back to Robins anytime, all of us were raving about it all day!"
4936647,31735253,2015-05-09,32006956,Michael,"Robin was great. She responded quick to questions and the place was clean and thoughtfully laid out. They even had a changing table for our one year old, and Robin placed some toys out for him as well. We where late coming in and the private entrance allowed us to come in quietly and without disturbing anyone. "
4936647,32701459,2015-05-20,31671586,Olivia,"We had a wonderful stay, the apartment was clean and comfortable, with everything we needed and the garden and the area was beautiful. We felt very welcome, but still had privacy. Loved the walk through the woods to the shops and bus stop! Robin and her husband were great hosts that really went above and beyond to make our trip easy and enjoyable! "
4936647,32894924,2015-05-23,30342919,Kishan,"Our stay was wonderful. We felt welcome and cozy, Robin gave us recommendations and we enjoyed our stay in Seattle very much. The neighbor hood is nice and a good location to drive into the city proper."
4936647,33251183,2015-05-26,15112629,Alfreda,"We found Robin and family to be very friendly and welcoming.  She was very communicative and quick to respond.  Their listing is the entire lower/basement floor and includes a kitchen, room with a bed, additional room with an inflatable mattress, and a third family room with a sleeper sofa.  The rooms were clean and modern and provided more than enough space for four of us to stay.  

The location is about 20 minutes to downtown Seattle (without traffic) by car, so it provided convenient access to tourist attractions. It is in a quiet part of town and the surrounding areas are lush and green. However, phone reception was spotty, especially since we were in the basement area. Being in the basement, we could often hear footsteps and voices from above.  This may pose a problem for light sleepers.

Overall, we enjoyed our stay.  Thanks to Robin and family.



"
4936647,34071601,2015-06-04,32307322,Vien,"Robin and family were welcoming and very responsive with texts and emails which we appreciate. The house is a located in a serene and quiet neighborhood and relatively close to the main attractions in downtown Seattle. Although the place itself was big enough to accommodate my group of 6, do note that there is only one restroom. At the time of our booking, the listing has mistakenly noted 1.5 restrooms. Fortunately, this has now been fixed for future guests to avoid confusion. There is also no phone reception in the basement. Despite these concerns, overall we did find Robin's home hospitable and a pleasant place to stay at. "
4936647,34440091,2015-06-08,16143537,Lisa,"What a perfect place for four friends to be reunited and spend the weekend. The basement space was perfect with comfortable sleeping arrangements, our own kitchen space and not to mention a beautiful backyard to appreciate.  Robin and family were so wonderful, we really appreciated our interactiona with them.  Every email and every question was answered quickly which was really appreciated. Nice quiet neighborhood,  not too far from the city and close by to a beautiful park. Will be staying again if I am blessed enough to travel to Seattle again in the future.  "
4936647,34646183,2015-06-10,5579407,Krista,The neighborhood was nice and the place was clean.  When we had a question about accessing wifi she was friendly and helpful.
4936647,35087008,2015-06-15,31250768,Joseph,"Great neighborhood, very quiet and peaceful. The place looks exactly like it does in the pictures. It was very clean, well furnished, and accessible. The amenities provided were very useful. Robin did an excellent job with preparing the place for our stay, and immediately answered any requests and concerns we had. Overall, we all had an enjoyable stay, thanks to Robin's hospitality."
4936647,35464895,2015-06-19,17744152,Zoe,Overall a very nice stay.  Great location and a lovely house. 
4936647,35934069,2015-06-23,16975468,Anna,"What a wonderful stop!  The place was perfect for us and for traveling with our three small children. (That said it would have been perfect for just adults too).  The backyard was amazing and the inside space with kitchen, bedroom and play area worked out perfectly.  And our toddler loved the sleeping nook! Robin was very responsive and made everything very easy.  Couldn't have asked for a more perfect place to start our trip.  "
4936647,36382145,2015-06-28,26364717,Mark,"Robin made us feel very welcome. She and her kids were very friendly and enthusiastic. They gave us great information on where to go and where to eat. 
The apartment is exactly like the pictures. Our daughter loved the playroom, especially the swing, and all the toys. Toys I loved as well! 
The garden is beautiful. Too bad we only stayed here for two days. We would definitely stay here again."
4936647,36887312,2015-07-02,34728673,Karen,"This property is located in a well-kept, wooded, established neighborhood overlooking Puget Sound. The house itself has a lovely setting and is extremely well-kept. We were able to park near the walk-way to the private entrance of our part of the house."
4936647,37751116,2015-07-10,7411702,Suzy,"We had a lovely time at Paul and Robin's house. We are a family of six, with three teenage boys and a younger daughter and we were all very comfortable in the space. The backyard was beautiful and our daughter was so delighted to find eggs in the chicken coop, swing on the swing, and climb the tree, all things which they graciously shared with us. The house is located in a quiet residential neighborhood and the drive to downtown Seattle and all the touristy things only took about 20 minutes. We found a great nearby pizza place and yummy sushi as well. Sunset at the nearby park is a treat too. We look forward to visiting the fairy garden again next summer. Thanks for making us feel at home."
4936647,39021845,2015-07-20,16812669,Tommy,"A very enjoyable week has ended in Seattle. As a family of 4 we spent one week in Seattle staying at Paul's (and family) house just north of downtown Seattle. The location is very nice in a quiet neighbourhood and only a short walk from a park, the sea and an excellent starting point for exploring downtown Seattle either by car or bus. We had the whole basement of the house and Paul was very helpful whenever needed. The house was a welcoming break from 2 weeks in hotels/motels - we'll always favour the house as it allows more space for the whole family. The house has a very nice and quiet garden with a very ""talkative"" cat.
If anyone plans a visit to Seattle, we'll highly recommend staying with Paul/Robin. We'll love to come back if we get a chance to visit Seattle again."
4936647,40530899,2015-07-31,26291623,Jonathan,"The apartment is really nice, exactly as described. We really enjoy our stay there."
4936647,41143157,2015-08-04,35309205,Anna,The suite is cool and calm. Our son loved the sleeping quarter underneath the stairs and the great collection of children's books. Our daughter loves the trampoline. Good location. Easy access to Seattle Center. A microwave oven and a toaster would have made meal preps easier with children. A regular size fridge can help with keeping milk for a longer stay. Truly enjoy the warm reception of the host's family.
4936647,43021080,2015-08-17,27559274,Jordina,"Highly recommend this place if you stay in seattle, really clean, comfy bed, feels like at home. My 3years old daughter love with the toys that their provide. Definitely will come back, we are originaly from Indonesia but we live in Vancouver, there is Indonesian restaurant close (email hidden)ank you so much robin and family. Will come back soon "
4936647,44108917,2015-08-24,2221586,Jacqueline,"What a wonderful experience!  We spent a long weekend in Seattle at Robin's delightful home. The space is clean. Spacious and full of character. Our only regret, that we didn't have more time to spend!  My eight year old grandson was particularly delighted with the 'sleeping nook' and the selection of toys that were made available to him. A short drive into the heart of the city - with a comfortable urban farm vide. What more could we ask for! "
4936647,45367531,2015-09-02,79042,Patricia,"My sister, daughter and I had a wonderful time at Robin's home. The location was easy to drive downtown on 99. Beds were very comfortable. Robin and her family were wonderful hosts. The garden is a lovely relaxing oasis...with a chicken coop. Would return. Thank you Robin.
"
4936647,47083250,2015-09-15,21468102,Casey,Robin is a great host! Her place was very nice and the pictures listed are very accurate. It was very clean and well maintained. My guests and I absolutely loved the space. It was everything we expected and then some. I would definitely recommend this place.
4936647,47492572,2015-09-19,41273185,Alethea,"The hosts created a perfect space for our small family on vacation.  After a long flight with two kids under the age of 4, it was exactly what we all needed: a comfortable place with loads of space and appropriate entertainment for the children; a place with awesome things to do outdoors - an adorable garden, chickens, a park with a great playground; a location that was a convenient drive to all of downtown Seattle's sites.  All of this made the transition from the East Coast to the West Coast so much easier for us all.  It was clean, peaceful and offered a lot for the children (the toys, swing, trampoline, nook! were loved by my littles).  The amenities and details were wonderful and thoughtful.  The home's proximity to Carkeek Park, in particular, was the cherry on top.  We enjoyed a hike, the beach, the trains, and the views as soon as we settled in!  The hosts were very welcoming and easy to chat with.  I'd recommend this place to anyone, especially with young children, in a heartbeat.  If we ever return to Seattle, this is the first place we'd book!  Thanks, Robin and Paul for a such a wonderful stay! "
4936647,48728113,2015-09-28,130698,Sachiko,"This was a very roomy space with a kitchen, two sleeping areas and a livingroom space.  Everything was maintained with care to create a cozy atmosphere.  Books of all sorts, a washing machine and dryer, and toys for kids were provided.  The private entrance through a charming backyard made the experience just that: private.  The neighborhood was lovely.
"
4936647,49971461,2015-10-08,34788657,Santhe,Wonderful place!  The location was perfect.  Place was very clean and nice.  Robin offered to meet with us when we arrived- which was a great help as we arrived late with three kids.  I will definitely stay here again next time in Seattle!
1266459,5645182,2013-07-09,4756660,Ben,"Dahlia's place was a perfect base for us to explore Seattle and the lovely walkable attractions of Ballard in particular. Dahlia went out of her way to make sure we were well catered for; the apartment was clean, amazingly well organized and had everything you could need in a home from home, even stocking the fridge with bits and pieces that we might need.

Make sure to visit some of the places that Dahlia has recommended. We enjoyed our meal at La Carta de Oaxaca, had great breakfast at Portage Bay on the walk to Hiram M. Chittenden Locks, and the Farmer's Market is a must do if you are there on a Sunday. I'd also highly recommend the D'Ambrosio Gelato.

The bus service into the city works well (20-30 mins) if you don't have a car or want to leave it behind.

We were 2 adults plus a baby and the space was just right.

Thanks Dahlia! "
1266459,5736561,2013-07-14,6965775,Jake & Hannah,"Dahlia's apartment was perfect for myself and my wife to enjoy our honeymoon in Seattle. It is in a great location in relation to the city and provided a peaceful, quiet, relaxing environment. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a great Seattle experience!"
1266459,6490153,2013-08-14,728996,Alyssa,"Dahlia's place is just as pictured--bright, pretty and full of charm. We loved being on the fourth floor so we could open the windows and let the breezes come in and even see a little of the city. Dahlia is a super-organized and friendly hostess. She left a whole binder of suggestions and info (she has excellent taste in bakeries!). We also very much enjoyed the laid back Ballard/Fremont neighborhoods. Don't hesitate to rent here!"
1266459,7046244,2013-09-04,7838053,Laura,"Dahlia's apartment was perfect for my boyfriend and I during our quick weekend getaway to Seattle. Her place is very centrally located in Ballard, close to amazing restaurants, quaint boutiques, and bus lines to downtown Seattle. We loved exploring all of Ballard, as well as downtown during the Bumbershoot festival. The apartment was very clean and bright, and Dahlia was an amazing host. As my inaugural venture into the world of airbnb, Dahlia definitely made the process painless, and even provides guests with food recommendations (all of which proved to be spectacular). Thank you Dahlia! I definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a beautiful place to relax with easy access to anywhere a sightseer may desire. "
1266459,12842469,2014-05-12,1607512,Amanda,"My mom and sister came to visit me in Seattle and I booked them at Dahlia's place (there are no good hotels in Ballard!). They had a great, comfortable experience and it was wonderful having them so close by. The place was clean and Dahlia's friend met us exactly on time to drop off the keys. I would definitely recommend her apartment for anyone wanting to stay in the Ballard neighborhood."
1266459,15341217,2014-07-07,3046151,Mary,"We had a great stay at Dahlia's Ballard abode. Her apartment was clean, cozy, and well-decorated (and full of coffee and other treats to enjoy). It's located on a quiet block, two blocks from the ever-bustling Market Street. Ballard is a great spot for your Seattle visit, and Dahlia's condo is a perfect home base."
1266459,15870628,2014-07-17,15742358,Kirsten,"Dahlia's apartment was exactly what we needed for the week. We were traveling with an 11 month old and her place gave us enough room to spread out. It is right in the middle of Ballard. Unfortunately we were there during the hottest part of the summer and the apartment doesn't have A/C but i was assured by our friends that the weather wasn't normal and most people do not have A/C. Dahlia did have a fan that helped to cool down the apartment and there was a great breeze coming through.
Dahlia left everything for us including travel sized toilet tree items which was helpful when we ran out of toothpaste. "
1266459,18901713,2014-09-02,19541465,Jin,"Dahlia was an amazing host. I'm only giving her five stars because I cannot give her six. Her place is as warm as charming as the picutres would indicate. She left a binder of information on what to do around Ballard - specifically a list of great restaurant/market locations. She's also great at communicating - every question I had she answered within a day - most of the time much less than that. Everything was clean and tidy upon arrival and supplied us with some amazing amenities. I would highly recommend Dahlia's space to use for anyone who is interested in staying in Seattle. Her apartment is a quick bus ride off the D line to downtown Seattle. I had no trouble getting to anywhere I wanted to - whether it be the Space Needle, the Seattle Center, the Public Market and many more! I could not recommend her space highly enough and will look for her listings in the future when I return to Seattle! Thanks Dahlia so much! "
1266459,38596347,2015-07-17,2321185,Thomas,We had a wonderful time staying at Dahlia's!  It's a great place and in a perfect location.  Right around everything you'd want to see and do in Ballard.  She made our stay very enjoyable.  Highly recommended!
2620429,12982721,2014-05-16,6884354,Jeremy,"Do yourself a favor and stay at this place.  Walking distance to Pike Street Market, full kitchen AND washer/dryer, spacious, clean, and awesome rock and roll posters on the walls.  Siena is also an amazing host, she  is very responsive to any questions...and when I arrived there was a welcome basket with fruit, bottled water, and beer.  I've stayed in a lot of hotels and this is by far the best travel lodging experience I've ever had.
1 heads up -- if you plan on having a car just know that the only available free parking is on the streets, and you better be good at parallel parking.  I had to drive around a bunch of times a couple nights.  Lots of paid parking available too. 
As for me this will be my first choice for any future stays in Seattle."
2620429,13249549,2014-05-23,9148447,Jeff,"A lovely condo with a great 2br layout that makes it feel larger than it is.  The location is terrific and walkable to great restaurants, bars and markets. The palce is very clean and Siena went well out of her way to make everything perfect for our stay.  Parking is hard but the guest pass makes it better.  I was able to park out front all but three times in my week long stay. I'd definitely stay again."
2620429,13427902,2014-05-27,13418043,Kat,"I have never had a nicer experience, both with a host or with a location! The apartment was beautiful, airy, spotless, exquisitely furnished and well located between Seattle's downtown and Capitol Hill neighborhoods. Our hostess, Siena, saw to every conceivable need, providing toiletries, a kitchen well stocked with cooking implements and several pages of extremely helpful instructions on the rooms, the building and getting around in the city. The welcome basket she left also had delicious treats and cool beverages to sooth the weary traveler. Siena seriously thought of anything we could need - there were even a couple of umbrellas left in the apartment for us to borrow if we forgot to bring our own! I only wish we had been in Seattle longer so we could have prolonged our stay in this gorgeous apartment. "
2620429,14395267,2014-06-18,14762576,Paras,"Siena was simply the best! This 2BR 2BA modern condo is perhaps one of the nicest places to stay in Seattle. Siena's attention to detail is unmatched as are the amenities provided in each room. She welcomes you with a welcome basket filled with beer, wine, fruit, and chocolate, and each bathroom is stocked with plenty of toiletries, towels, and even first aid kits! In addition, the second bedroom has a Nintendo Wii (with one controller) while every bedroom + the living room has a flatscreen LCD TV with a wide selection of BlueRay and DVDs to choose from. The beds are also extremely comfortable and every kitchen supply is available should you feel the desire to cook. Finally, you get to dictate how much you want to interact with the host - something I value about a good host. If you wish to communicate with Siena, she's simply a phone call away, however, if you want private time she honors that too! Next time we are in town, we would love to stay here again. "
2620429,14614940,2014-06-23,15011513,Gregg,"Siena was thoughtful, responsive, and generous.  The condo was even better than my high expectations.  Comfortable bed, great amenities, and the perfect location for getting to/from the heart of Seattle's convention area.  Also, this is very convenient to Light Rail to/from airport and Monorail to Seattle Center.  Add walking distance to Pike Place Market and downtown and you have an unbeatable Seattle location!  Plus you are in walking distance to the Capitol Hill neighborhood where some of the best restaurants are located. 

Siena even hand-picked my favorite breakfast and beverage items to stock the welcome basket that was waiting for me when I arrived.  Thanks for a great travel experience!"
2620429,14818628,2014-06-27,14756989,Jennifer,"This listing was absolutely as nice as the pictures. It's in a great location, walking distance to Pike Place Market, shopping, restaurants, even the monorail that takes you to the Space Needle and museums.  We loved the panoramic views from the rooftop deck, especially at night and kept the windows open to enjoy the cool breeze. Siena provided more amenities than you would ever get staying in a hotel. There was a welcome basket, toiletry baskets in the bathrooms, fully stocked kitchen including all the condiments you might need. An espresso machine with coffee. There were even movies and books available. Unlike staying at a hotel, our stay here was more personal, starting with a welcome letter filled with lots of good information and ideas for our trip.  And whenever anything came up during our vacation, Siena was always reachable.  My family and I are extremely glad we stayed here instead of at a hotel. Being able to spend the day sightseeing and coming back to this comfortable home base was absolutely worth it and was actually one of the best parts of our trip. Siena definitely puts a lot of effort into pleasing her guests. We would stay here again in a heartbeat."
2620429,15039411,2014-07-01,2734499,Jason,Fantastic space. Great location. This was the best experience I have ever had with an Airbnb rental in Seattle. Thank you Siena. You are the best host ever! I highly recommend this listing!
2620429,15186205,2014-07-04,12404221,Libby,Perfect place near downtown Seattle and a perfect host.
2620429,15677270,2014-07-14,14895128,Sharon,"Neighborhood was nice, right next to the Convention Center in downtown.  Easy walk to all the major sight-seeing spots.  The bus was just a block away, but we never had to ride, everything we wanted to do was just a walk away.  Siena was an excellent host - she met us the first night and was able to sort out the parking issue (previous guest had taken the parking pass) so we had no issue what-so-ever parking."
2620429,15907038,2014-07-18,541590,Michael,"The condo was perfect; clean, comfortable, great location.  The welcome basket was a wonderful surprise, too!  We will be back anytime our travels take us to Seattle."
2620429,17338485,2014-08-11,14859897,Suzanne,"Our host Sienna did a wonderful job of making us feel welcome and right at home!  The neighborhood was centrally located to touring the city by foot, light rail, or bus system.  "
2620429,17613091,2014-08-15,4422091,John,"We very much enjoyed our three nights at Siena's apartment.  Siena was a terrific host. She provided lots of information on how to find the apartment, parking, how to get around, sights to see, etc...The apartment itself was close to public transportation, shopping,restaurants, etc...and very spacious: more than adequate for the four of us. The rooms were all large, comfortable, bright, clean and well furnished. The kitchen was also extremely well stocked! I would certainly recommend this accommodation to anyone. "
2620429,17927915,2014-08-19,14760583,Amy,"We had a great stay.  The condo is beautiful, comfortable and in a great location -- close to downtown and a store in short walking distance.  Our host was available whenever we needed help and she even went the extra mile when we needed some extra help on our arrival day.  She provided all the information we needed in advance for the condo, the parking and the surrounding sites.  The beds were comfortable and we loved the basket of goodies waiting in the refrigerator! Highly recommend."
2620429,18785139,2014-09-01,14282789,Nathaniel,"My friends and I have attended conferences in Seattle for years.   Ususally we stay in some of the nice hotels around, but Siena's place more than exceeded both our experience and our expectations.  I spent the entire weekend receiving praises for finding such a gem of a place.   You would be hard pressed to find a more convenient place to stay when attending an event at the convention center.  The condo was immaculate, everything was literally perfect when we arrived, very professionally taken care of and prepared for us.
As a host, Siena is top notch.  She is friendly, easy to communicate with, quick to respond, and follows up with exceptional attention to any details you might have discussed with her.  
All in all, this was our best experience staying in Seattle so far.  We will certainly be booking with her again!"
2620429,19121320,2014-09-07,2006812,Jenna,Siena was an awesome host! The condo was the perfect location and had everything we needed and more! Siena was extremely helpful and made sure to be informative on all the great things to do and see in Seattle including checking out local restaurants that were great and walking distance from condo. If you are visiting Seattle you should book with Siena!
2620429,19319494,2014-09-10,18146689,Anya,"BOOK IT. I just can't say enough good things about this location and about Siena's customer service. First, the location, which was just perfect. We were lucky to get this place while it was discounted, or else we would have been further out in the burbs. It's a short walk down to Pike Place Market, and an even shorter walk to the Monorail stop that goes straight to the Space Needle. I wasted weeks trying to book units right next to Pike Place Market, when this unit was still so close (10 minutes walking, maybe?), and probably had better parking than down by the waterfront would have (parking is tough downtown!). The unit is also around the corner from a useful little grocery, the excellent Tango tapas bar and restaurant, and a yummy crepes joint a couple blocks down Pike. Plus, it's right by the highway, yet you don't hear the traffic noise. 

The unit's layout is PERFECT. A good master bedroom with a flexible guest room (a door at each end, which was handy to get our baby in and out without waking the toddler). And two bathrooms - stocked with essential shampoos, soaps, etc AND a stocked medicine cabinet, like, advil, benadryl, etc. What a nice detail! Great decor throughout, nice open living layout, and a ridiculously generous welcome basket in the fridge - beer, wine, chocolate, bottled waters, and much more. My one complaint was the roof decks. They are practically useless they are so small.

Other reviewers were right on the mark about the host, Siena - she was prompt, thorough, funny and gracious. She brought us cupcakes and cookies before checkout, either for no reason or maybe because the toilet momentarily backed up that morning, which was no big deal with another one to use. Dealing with such a friendly host was so nice. 

We enjoyed the heck out of this unit - and let me tell you, it is really hard for a family with 2 kids under 4 to truly enjoy anywhere that isn't home. We would most definitely stay here again if we come back out West. Take my word for it, this place is THE ONE if you are visiting Seattle, especially if the price is right or even close to right. You will feel right at home, right away.  "
2620429,19455983,2014-09-13,4931507,Carol,"We had an amazing time in Seattle.  Siena was there to great us when we arrived.  Apartment was clean and welcoming...complete with food, coffee and other goodies.  We were left needing nothing.  I hope to return to Seattle and would reach out to Siena again to rent her place.  It was incredibly convenient.  Loved the place and Siena's hospitality!!"
2620429,19767583,2014-09-18,14118711,Miriam,"Lovely neighbourhood, lovely quiet spot but close to nice restaurants, tourist attractions, pubs.  Also easy to access the I-5 if you're visiting farther afield.
The flat is well laid out and tidy, the rooftop space lovely, and Siena left treats in the fridge and a welcome bouquet of sunflowers in the kitchen.  Wifi setup is very handy, all kitchen and entertainment appliances functional and new.

We would recommend this place to friends visiting Seattle and would stay here again another time. Only caveat is that --as Siena refers to in her text--parking can be tight even with an area parking permit.  Overall a lovely experience."
2620429,19921689,2014-09-21,4722348,Christine,"I was in Seattle with 3 friends before leaving on an Alaskan cruise.  Siena was a great host... Very helpful and patient answering any questions we had (and we had a lot!) putting together a nice welcome basket complete with snacks, etc.  The apartment is exactly as pictured... A great sized space, even for 4 people.  

The location was great... A short walk to the Capital Hill area (I recommend Pie Bar, Sushi Maki and via Tribunali), and also Pike Place Market.  The building is at the top of a hill though, so be prepared. 

A few things to note about the area... We did notice a few homeless in the area around the apartment (not nearly as many as downtown though). We never felt unsafe, it's just something to be aware of, especially if you're going to be out at night.  Also, though the highway does run underground on either side of the street the building is on, you can still hear the traffic. I'm from a large city so it was just background noise to me, but in case you're not it's something to keep in mind. I always travel with earplugs and that took care of it at night. 

If you get the chance, make sure to check out the rooftop patio areas. They're smallish, but have amazing views at night!

Finally, the only issue we had during our stay was with Yellow cab when we needed to get to the port at the end of the stay. If there's more than 2 or 3 in your group, make sure to use the car service Siena recommends. We told the taxi company we needed a car big enough for 4 people and our luggage. Apparently cars are dispatched by computer so you have no control over what you're going to get, and you can only request a minivan if you have a wheelchair, etc and are going to the airport. We got a Prius. And a driver who left us all standing on the sidewalk once he realized everyone wasn't going to fit into the car.

2620429,20183709,2014-09-25,5105529,Bonnie,"It was definitely a fab experience to stay at Siena's place. The location is very downtown. Siena was very sweet and considerable. She prepared everything we need, even a hamper of snacks and drinks!!! She is always available to answer our questions and offer helps. It is definitely a home away from a home. We love their deco theme - Beatles!!! We will stay at her place again if we travel back to Seattle next time. We really enjoyed our stay at Sienna's place. Sincerely thanks to Siena from Bonnie, Andy, Jessica, Baoer and Kelvin. "
2620429,20410778,2014-09-29,1313516,Whitney,"The arrival was perfect. The instructions were simple and easy to follow. The condo was very well appointed with all the amenities one would expect. Plus there were many extras that added to a fine overall experience. The condo is located in a trendy area, a short walk ( downhill) to Pike's market and the cab ride home was, for 4, little more than bus fare. The unit was comfortable and squeaky clean. We know where we will be staying on our next visit to Seattle. Overall 5+ stars.
"
2620429,20634472,2014-10-02,21889414,Cyrus,"Very clean, great homely touches, close to everything, I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle. "
2620429,20812707,2014-10-06,2515487,Amanda,"Wow! First off, the house is incredible! I love the style, convenient location, and cleanliness of the home. Siena and house keeper Nadia provided everything we needed. Chocolate, wine, popcorn, restaurant suggestions, a set of keys for each of us and easy to follow instructions for washer/dryer + espresso and coffee machine. We are coming back to Seattle and we're staying here!"
2620429,21029261,2014-10-10,17696271,Linda,"Siena was wonderful.  From the moment I made the reservation to the day we left the apartment she was great!  Helpful, kind and full of information."
2620429,21507706,2014-10-19,18813145,Greg,"What a wonderful stay for our first trip to Seattle! Siena provided personalized timely and valued support from booking through departure.  The apartment was exactly as described, which is to say, perfect, and quite a value, given it's convenient location. Nice galley kitchen, comfy beds, two full baths make for a great stay for two couples.  Truly, right around the corner from the convention center, easy walks to most points of interest.  Good restaurants nearby.  As with any large city, on street parking may require some searching, but paid parking is readily available.
In summary, SUPER! If we are lucky enough to return to Seattle, there is no place we would rather stay!"
2620429,21850196,2014-10-25,22502496,John,"Excellent apartment, excellent host. The apartment is spacious and immaculate. Siena was in contact with us from booking through check-out, ensuring everything was just right for our stay. It's within walking distance of the light rail, Pike Market, and the monorail to Seattle Center. It's also very close to the convention center if you're in town for that. We highly recommend this apartment and we plan to stay here again the next time we're in Seattle."
2620429,22097676,2014-10-30,19073493,Joe,"This was our 1st experience with AirBnB. We were not disappointed. The apartment was much larger than we thought it would be. The 2BR2BA allowed both adult couples to have their own suites. I can only comment on the spare BA/BR. In my opinion, the bed and pillows were much more comfortable than a hotel. All rooms had black out curtains, and outside noise was never an issue, even with morning construction outside the front of the building. Lots of closet space, great shower water pressure. The apartment came with fool proof laundry that was very helpful. The living room and kitchen were big enough for all four adults to lounge around and unwind after a day of sightseeing. Both roof top patios offer amazing views (pictures on site do them no justice). I met multiple building residents who were all friendly and helpful in suggesting local places to eat, and places to take a day trip. The building was in the Capitol Hill area, which unbeknownst to us, is the young trendy part of town. We were able to walk to restaurants, bars, Pikes place, a pharmacy, a mall, movie theater, multiple coffee shops, light rail, and bus stops with no issues. To put it in perspective; my wife was 6months pregnant on this trip, and we never once had to walk outside her comfort level, to find good food or fun. On longer trips, we took a taxi, which seem to always be driving by the entrance of the building, due to its location next to the convention center. The neighborhood and building felt very safe. We had no worries, walking to and from, even later in the night. Siena went above and beyond with information/options on how to get to the apartment from the airport. The refrigerator came stocked with goodies, the bathroom had lots of amenities (even simple things like tylenol and bandaids). The apartment was very clean and smelled fresh when we arrived. Lots of little perks that a hotel does not offer (dvds, wifi, dishes). One day, the wifi stopped working. I contacted Siena, and she got it restarted and working in no time. This was a fantastic experience from start to finish.  Staying in this apartment made our trip. Hotel rooms get cluttered and offer no place for community hang out. This apartment was great for a family or two couples. If I ever come back to Seattle, I will be sure to stay with Siena again. Great host. Great apartment. Great part of town. Might I suggest Stumptown Coffee on Pine St to any first timers in Seattle. "
2620429,22576813,2014-11-10,11735041,Michael,"I thought I provided the best AirBnB experience until I stayed at Sienna's place in Seattle. Wow, she knows how to do it right (and I took notes)!!If you are going to Seattle, my guess is there is no better place to stay. I am looking for an excuse to go back so I can stay there again! "
2620429,22825494,2014-11-16,19053996,Chris,Siena's apartment was just right for our needs. My family of four had plenty of room in this very comfortable and attractive listing in the heart of downtown. Siena made us feel so welcome and even included some beverages and snacks. Kitchen was well equipped for meal prep. Parking could be challenging but was manageable. We would all highly recommend!
2620429,23356472,2014-11-30,18898683,Donna,"Our first experience using airbnb was terrific thanks to Siena Ross and her 2 bedroom, 2 bath downtown condo.  The condo was clean and pretty and the perfect place for our family of four to wake up to each day and return to each evening.  The location felt very safe and was conveniently located to walking downtown, to Pike's Place Market, to catch the monorail to Seattle Center, to shopping, and walk to the harbor for ferry.  Siena was most accommodating and respectful and we will definitely stay here on our next visit and highly recommend to friends."
2620429,23742791,2014-12-09,12912511,Mark,"I've stayed at a few Airbnb places now, but this was a standout. Siena is the most marvelous and attentive host, and everything was unbelievably well arranged. The apartment is clean and spacious, and has everything you need for a comfortable stay. It is REALLY close to the conference centre, which was great, and on the edge of Capitol Hill which has fantastic dining and interesting shops. It's a short walk downtown and 15 minute walk to Pike St. Market. My family had no trouble keeping entertained while
I attended the conference. I couldn't recommend this any more highly. "
2620429,23997422,2014-12-16,14902620,Jorge,"Siena is incredibly organized and thoughtful.  The place was outfitted with every possible item one could want from toiletries to first aid to snacks, gourmet coffee etc.  The apartment is ideally situated not only next to downtown but as importantly to the abundant restaurants and bars of First and Capitol Hills.  I highly recommend it!"
2620429,24352989,2014-12-27,2629367,Glenna,"Siena greeted us at the building to ensure that we got into the apartment alright, etc.  The apartment size was perfect for me and my husband, our son and his friend, and we were so happy to find all the provisions Siena makes available - free treats in the fridge, all kinds of condiments in the fridge and spices in the cupboards, plus every kind of cooking utensil you could want, foil, plastic wrap, etc.  We had planned to cook Christmas dinner there, so all of this was extremely helpful!  Next time we will get fresh fish from Pike Place Market!  Plus, she had a fully stocked medicine cabinet - the EmergenC came in handy!  How nice is that?  We travel extensively in the U.S. and Asia and this was a top-notch accommodation and exceptional value.  In addition, the location is fabulous - decent walking distance to everywhere we wanted to go (including the new Starbucks Roastery - about 3 minutes away), and that included everything we wanted to do.  Oh and did I mention Siena provided a lovely Christmas tree complete with decorations for us?  That's definitely going the extra mile.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will be back next Seattle trip.  "
2620429,24633299,2015-01-01,4798014,Megan,"The accommodations were as described, and exceeded our expectations. We found free street parking right in front of the building, and because of the convenient location that allowed us to walk everywhere we wanted and needed to go, we left our car parked for our entire trip. The kitchen is well-equipped, and the kitchen stocked with the staples - coffee, tea, condiments & spices. The apartment was ready when we arrived, and Siena calmly greeted us (after a slightly frazzled drive). Welcome snacks and drinks were also. appreciated, and especially Siena's note to ""pour yourself a glass"", and read about the apartment amenities, neighborhood services, and best restaurants. Grocery, market, pharmacy, transit and many sites within walking distance. Wish we had more time to explore the area. The apartment had plenty of space for our entire family.  We would definitely return!"
2620429,24910140,2015-01-04,17272084,Bonnie,"We had a Fantastic stay at this Apartment, The Place itself is so Funky, we were two couples and all loved it as soon as we walked in! It is completely Stocked with everything you could possibly need and is very comfortable, Siena is an Amazing Host! She was so welcoming, and provided so much useful information, we tried some of her recommendations and they where all great!  we very much appreciated the welcome pack and having cold drinks and a little snack waiting for us!  The place is in a great location, we didn't use public transport at all, you can easily walk to the major attractions. I cant say enough how great the Apartment and Siena was! Stay here you wont be disappointed! "
2620429,25272234,2015-01-11,24244189,Alex,The accommodation was in excellent condition and was very well appointed. The location was fantastic - only a short walk to the pike place markets and a plethora of restaurants could be found nearby. Siena was an excellent hostess who really went out of her way to ensure we were well looked after. We would definitely stay here again
2620429,25797032,2015-01-26,6728125,Monica,"Siena was a great host and left us all sorts of great information to get us started on our trip!  The home was very clean, stocked with everything we could need during our trip and close to everywhere we went.  We walked everywhere from the home, it was so conveniently located!  We loved it and would definitely stay again!"
2620429,26152341,2015-02-05,24380059,Anisa,"Location, location, location!! This place was in the heart of Seattle, with an amazing rooftop view. The apartment was very clean and nice with comfortable furniture and an inviting environment. Siena, the host, was more than accommodating. She offered us early check in because our flight got in hours earlier than the scheduled check in. She then offered to hold our luggage on the day we checked out until we needed to go to the airport. Loved the experience and will definitely stay here again anytime I come to Seattle!! "
2620429,27289798,2015-03-01,1869589,Uriah,"Wow! Wow! Wow!  That's exactly what we were saying as we walked in and explored Siena's condo.  The place is clean, kitchen well furnished, and in a great area.  The beds provided a good night sleep.  The condo is a beautiful 15 minute walk to Pike's Place, at the cusp of Capital Hill.  The wine, chocolates were definitely a warm welcome as well as the amazing coffee she left for us for those foggy mornings.  We would definitely, stay here again and highly recommend."
2620429,27997799,2015-03-16,14865255,Susan,The condo is in a great area of Seattle. We were able to walk to most places. The condo was immaculate and  was very comfortable for four adults. We appreciated Siena's thoughtfulness at providing snacks.
2620429,28244489,2015-03-21,17272261,Scott,"What a great experience! I have never felt so welcomed before! The place itself was great.  The full kitchen was wonderful and the place was so spacious and wonderfully decorated.  Any utensils I could ask for were there and I was pleasantly surprised by all the ""goodies"" left for us by Siena! The rooftop was breathtaking! Perfect location to the convention center and walking distance to so many attractions and restaurants.  Siena was the best though! She was super friendly and very accommodating with my reservation I made months in advance.  She went above and beyond to help me make my trip happen.  Siena was available whenever I needed something and her emails were very thorough and packed with info on the city.  I was not surprised when I found even more help in her welcome letter to me.  I cannot imagine a better host than her!!! Thanks Siena!  "
2620429,28565739,2015-03-26,27622659,Sara,"Siena was a wonderful host.  She left a personalized note to welcome us to the apartment and also stocked the fridge with a few nice snacks and drinks.  The apartment is immaculate and has any amenity that you might need - from extra toothbrushes in case you forget, a stocked medicine cabinet, and a washer/dryer unit.  We really appreciated the black out curtains too - a really thoughtful touch to block out the city lights  This apartment is in the heart of the city - within walking distance to Pike Market and right next door to the convention center.  It's a great place to stay, and we would stay here again in a heartbeat!  We had to contact Siena during our stay and she was easily reachable and able and willing to help us quickly!  "
2620429,28695824,2015-03-29,12935175,Stephanie,"I cannot say enough good things about my stay in Sienna's home. She was attentive to all my needs and then some. She was always available when needed. The best host I have encountered yet!

The apartment is perfectly located. I needed to be near the convention center, so this was ideal. Having the parking option available is also amazing, as parking in Seattle can be really difficult. It was a breeze having a spot available just for me. 

The apartment is exactly as pictured. It is beautiful, spacious and relaxing. The bed was amazingly comfortable.

I would absolutely recommend staying with Siena. "
2620429,29061716,2015-04-03,29327181,Michael,"With an excellent location between downtown and Capitol Hill, I put many miles on my shoes staying here, and then got to come home to this funky apartment. The decor has a lot of character; it's just as pictured and feels more like a home than some places I've stayed in. Seeing Jimi every time I walked in the door made me happy. It's also built like a bunker, so there is no noise from neighboring apts, though you'll hear the freeway if you open the windows.  Siena was great, and provided me with plenty of info before I got there, so initial entry was effortless. The packet she wrote up to explain the building and surrounding neighborhoods was comprehensive. The price was right and it was smack in the center of everything, so it would be my first choice if I go back to Seattle."
2620429,29478187,2015-04-08,18401362,Eric,The apartment was clean and worked well for my family of five.  It is in an ideal location in walking distance to Pike Place Market and many other attractions. 
2620429,29809261,2015-04-13,11735206,Victor,"Siena is a very kind, thoughtful and welcoming host.  We arrived to a very clean place, a tray fresh strawberries and thoughtful niceties everywhere-- fridge nicely stocked with coffee, beer, wine, chocolate etc..., plenty of towels and bath amenities,  plush bathrobes hanging in the closet, and washer/dryer combo in the condo.  The condo is a 1 minute walk from the Seattle Convention Center (amazingly convenient) and the very nice Capitol Hill neighborhood, also only 4 blocks to downtown and the Westlake light rail airport line.   Stay was awesome, highly recommend!"
2620429,30490298,2015-04-23,23980165,Joshua,Great downtown Seattle location! Awesome rooftop deck
2620429,31172971,2015-05-03,27688854,Cindy,"Sienna is an Amazing Host, and this is such a wonderfull appartment! You might not see it from the pictures, but this place is quite big. The apartment is wonderfully located, right next to the convention center, short 15 min walk to Pike street market, in short wonderfull!"
2620429,31706368,2015-05-09,27128355,Chayne,"Siena was great, very responsive and accomdating. The street and neighborhood are perfect, the listing was better than expected pictures don't do it justice. Great trip, I've been recommending to all my friends. If you're attending a conference absolutely perfect place to stay! "
2620429,32339256,2015-05-17,22081782,Grace,"Best decision for our trip to Seattle!
This was my first time using Airbnb and Siena has made me a believer! Amazing apartment with room for all 5 of us, best downtown location close to everything, clean, and priced very fair.  Siena was so helpful during the preplanning with directions to the apartment from the airport and the apartment was stocked with everything we needed.  I think I may be spoiled for future travels at Airbnb because the bar has been set high! Thank you Siena!"
2620429,32959080,2015-05-24,26866534,Nick,"Great time, great city, great host. Would contact Siena in a heart beat if I returned to Seattle. "
2620429,33436530,2015-05-28,29827358,Dan,"This is a great location. It's right next to downtown, and only a short walk to Pike's Place Market, Capitol Hill, restaurants, bars, shops, and only a few blocks from the Light Rail, which we took from the airport.

Our host, Siena, was extremely accomodating, professional, and very easy to communicate with. She left us a welcoming gift, including beers, snacks, and a list of things to do and see in Seattle. If you're lucky enough to have the chance to meet her, she is a wonderful woman with a great sense of humor.

Everything described in the listing is accurate - what you see is what to expect. It's a great little condo in a clean building, and the roof-deck views are spectacular.

I would recommend staying here to just about anyone."
2620429,33641613,2015-05-31,7134177,Martin,"Siena went above and beyond to make a remarkable home-away-from-home for us -- working out parking, giving us great tips, and welcoming us to town.  The perfect apartment for our family as well."
2620429,33987124,2015-06-03,29416528,Amber,"We visited Seattle for the first time at the beginning of June, and rented Siena's condo for the first few days of our stay.  We could not have been happier, everything that was described on the website was 100% accurate.  She made you feel very welcome from the beginning up until the very end."
2620429,34212974,2015-06-06,70683,TerryLynn,"Siena was great, she helped us feel right at home by providing very detailed instructions and recommendations. The condo is lovely and very clean; the location is super; right across the street from the convention center and within walking distance of wonderful restaurants and shopping. This wonderful place was stocked with goodies much better than the finest hotels I've stayed in, no charge!!"
2620429,34635223,2015-06-10,2089409,Anna,"Siena 's apartment is the perfect place to stay in seattle. Excellent location right near pike street, convience store nearby, pike market in walking distance. Siena's apartment is beautiful, spacious, fully equipped kitchen, two bathrooms. Everything was very clean, and she left us some snacks in the fridge. We even got to check out late. Siena communicated with us before and throughout the stay when we needed something. She is the perfect hostess!"
2620429,34935966,2015-06-14,28044413,Sherry,"A FABULOUS first ABNB experience. Location was perfect, we could walk almost everywhere we wanted to go. But what made the experience fabulous was the welcome and amenities provided by our host. We arrived late (even later than the planned late arrival thanks to flight delays) and she instantly let us in (through a cool remote entry system). Chocolate, wine and beer awaiting us in the refrigerator, as well as a detailed welcome letter, and coffee (choice of decaf/fully loaded). Having a full apartment including a washer/dryer made our Seattle  stay so much more comfortable (and affordable) than 2 hotel rooms. Also it was nice not to have a long list of clean up responsibilities upon leaving! We were able to make an easy ""get away."" Thanks to Siena we have become ABNB converts and look forward to our next chance to be someone's guest. "
2620429,35452049,2015-06-19,3017559,Jeneva,Siena made us completely at home!! All needs and recommendations were covered beyond expectations! I would highly recommend this beautiful apartment to anyone! The location was perfect and in the downtown area! 
2620429,35923558,2015-06-23,31683769,Jonathan,"Siena was a gracious host and did everything to make our stay easy.  The apartment is in a great location and easily in walking distance of many attractions and great restaurants.  Even though we only used the kitchen for breakfast, it was well stocked and had everything one would need.

There are a few negative points about the unit and these all relate to the furniture.  First, the couch in the living room has a broken spring and is extremely uncomfortable.  Second, the bunk beds are not very stable and are also uncomfortable.  Third, the kitchen chairs are impossible for any normal human being to sit in.  Fourth, the TV is difficult to use and we had to call Siena for instructions (she indicated that we were not the first to do this).  Finally, the washer and, especially the dryer, are incredibly slow (5 hours or more for an average load) and one doesn't find out about this until one tries to use it.

Our family believes that if the furniture were upgraded that this would be a fantastic place to stay.  However, at $370 per night (summer weekend rate) this is not worth it."
2620429,36506912,2015-06-29,27796439,Leah,"Siena was extremely nice and accommodating.  I have bad allergies and asthma, and I needed all unscented cleaning and laundry products used in the apartment.  She even bought me special soap!  Siena was also kind enough to send me a list of wineries that are kid friendly.  My family of 4 stayed in the apartment.  My children are 18 and 20.  There was ample space for all of us.  The apartment could easily handle one more person. It was so nice to have 2 bathrooms!  The kitchen is what you would expect for a city apartment. The appliances are not brand new, but everything worked fine.  There are pots and pans, foil, plastic bags, and everything else. Siena even stocks the refrigerator with wine and beer for you!!  She brought a new table and chairs over during our stay, and it's very nice. 
It was unusually hot while we were there. I think almost 90 degrees one or two days.  Seattle did not reach the 90 degree mark all last summer. The mobile air conditioner worked very well.  The bedrooms were fine for sleeping. There is a ceiling fan in the master bedroom and a box fan for the other.  We had the windows open some, and there were no bugs.  
We loved the apartment, and would definitely stay again.  
We did rent a car, and I would recommend the parking spot if you do. I did not see any street parking available while we were there for 6 days.  
The apartment is an easy walk to Pike Market. There are tons of shops and restaurants along the way too.  And, of course lots of Starbucks! We did drive to the Space Needle,  and you can valet park there.  The restaurant at the top of the Space Needle is excellent, and it spins around. But, it is very pricy. "
2620429,39477805,2015-07-24,28522151,David,"This is close to the roastery and other great restaurants. Siena made us feel welcome from the beginning. She had a box of pancake mix for a ""midnight snack"". We got in so late we made them the next day. She also had several beers in the fridge as well. The first few days were hot (we are from Texas so more warm to us) she provided a little ac unit to keep us cool. The rest of the time it was cool enough at night to sleep with the windows open. Siena provied instuctions for us and was very helpful. I wouldn't do this place justice if I didn't mention the roof top. We enjoyed an adult beverage as we watched the sun go down. Very relaxing after a day of walking. Siena did an awesome job making us feel welcome. "
2620429,39920092,2015-07-27,6157730,Ken,"Siena was an outstanding host. She communicated early and politely to ensure we knew everything necessary to have the trip go smoothly. Her pre-arrival email was a wealth of information about the apartment as well as providing a huge amount of information about the city for unfamiliar visitors. The apartment itself is in a great location for a city holiday, close to a lot of amenities and within walking distance of just about anything you would want to see while visiting. It is well set up and comfortable. We will definitely stay here again if visiting Seattle."
2620429,40553369,2015-08-01,18065184,Tamara,"Our stay in Seattle was wonderful and we felt very much at home in the apartment.  Sienna did everything she could to make us feel welcome!  She knew our flight landed late in the evening so she left pancake mix and syrup for us the next morning!  We loved all of the little touches like the the restaurant recommendations, the very easy instructions and the stocked kitchen.  

The apartment is spacious and clean and a perfect option for our family of 5. "
2620429,41199669,2015-08-05,32278938,Stacey,"Siena is a wonderful hostess and made us feel at home. The condo was comfortable and had everything we needed, and is within walking distance of many of the places we wanted to see. It was like staying at a friend's house!"
2620429,41723882,2015-08-09,11484271,Cathy,Great location for exploring downtown. Our family of 4 had ample space & appreciated the cleanliness of the apartment. The kitchen was very well stocked and we enjoyed the goodies in the fridge too!
2620429,42379557,2015-08-13,30735850,Catherine,Quiet street but easy access to everything we wanted to explore in Seattle.  Communication was good and the whole experience was smooth.  The size of the apartment was perfect for a family of 4 and our teen sons especially appreciated the cool decor. 
2620429,42846669,2015-08-16,34592244,Jane,Although my party did not meet Siena she communicated thoroughly and promptly and we had no trouble accessing the property. Siena detailed many options of how to get to downtown Seattle before we arrived and we took her advice.  The condo was clean and welcoming.  Everything we wanted was there. We noticed there were even a couple of umbrellas by the door. This is a great listing that we would have no hesitation in highly recommending.
2620429,43603531,2015-08-21,28809138,Gloria,"This was a very welcoming condo thanks to Siena.  She gave very good directions and instructions so we settled in very smoothly.  This condo is very well stocked and Siena had provided snacks for our arrival which was very welcome!  She's really on top of things and very accessible and friendly!  The condo was pretty comfortable.  There is an AC unit in the living room area that works pretty well.  You can't really open windows because it's located near the freeway...but very quiet if you keep the windows closed.  The location was ideal.  We walked to Pike Place Market and to many restaurants in the area.  Don't forget to see the nearby ""Starbucks Reserve"".  Very interesting!  "
2620429,44291027,2015-08-25,34591232,Breanna,"This experience was amazing. Siena was super accompdating and personable. I'm elated that I got the chance to meet her. It was beautiful to start the experience with wine and chocolate, my two favorite things. The location was perfect and close to everything, downtown and capitol hill. Lots of great shopping and coffee. The beds were so comfortable and it was the perfect place for 5 people. Siena also left a list of easily accesible places to go and see Mali g it easy for any visiter. I would come back here versus a hotel any day for the cost and the comfort!"
2620429,45469367,2015-09-03,31032294,Gordon,"The host is amazing, best experience I've ever had renting. The apartment is very nice, accurate to the pictures. Maybe even a bit nicer than the pictures. And the location, it's beyond perfect and an easy walk all over the best spots of the city. Will book again my next stay in Seattle. Loved it!"
2620429,46578922,2015-09-12,33615790,Megan,"I cannot say enough good things about our experience.  The location was fantastic for a family of 5, which includes 3 under 5 years old.  We stayed for a week and never got in a car.  We walked everywhere or took the monorail.  The place was laid out really well and even the building residents were friendly and helpful.  Saving the best for last...our host!  She has thought of everything - snacks, coffee, a full water pitcher in the fridge, pancake mix and maple syrup, pages of recommendations, a map of the city, plenty of towels, extra blankets and pillows.  I could go on forever!  I wish she could write a handbook on how to host an Airbnb because this is how it is done best.  We've rented quite a bit from both Airbnb and VRBO and this was hands down the best experience.  You could tell that she was invested in us having a great trip and she succeeded."
2620429,47048665,2015-09-15,37778477,Alexandra,"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle! the apartment was perfect, we stayed with another couple and had plenty of room (and our own private bathroom). Location was a short walk from most of the places we wanted to see and we loved the views from the roof deck. Siena was a great hostess! "
2620429,47646578,2015-09-21,6970067,Aneka,"Our stay at this condo was great.  The location was close to many attractions - definitely within walking distance of so much. Our flight was very delayed and we got into Seattle very late - Siena was welcoming and a great host. We were luckily able to get into a condo with another tenant.  Siena left us some goodies and snacks  - and most importantly - creamer for our much needed morning coffee!  The place was clean, the beds were comfortable. It can be noisy in the morning but we liked having the windows cracked - it would have been great if there were screens on them!  The size of the condo was perfect for 4 people. It was fully stocked as well - we were able to make a full breakfast one morning.   I would recommend this place to friends. "
2620429,48264719,2015-09-25,605725,Neil & Carol,"You can't ask for a better hostess than Siena!  Access to the building couldn't have been easier upon arrival.  She did everything possible to insure that my party had a positive experience while visiting Seattle, from the welcome snacks to the plethora of information about the surrounding area, things to do and great restaurants.  Siena's condo was perfect for our party of five.  The location was close to many terrific eateries as well as public transportation and walking distance to shopping.  I will definitely stay at Siena's on my next trip to Seattle.

Sincerely, Neil."
2620429,49588263,2015-10-05,16005937,Jessica,We had a great stay at this condo. Sienna was absolutely lovely to deal with and very accommodating. Perfect location- walking distance to Pikes Place. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here!
2620429,50444249,2015-10-12,6640390,Bram,"This is an absolutely gorgeous place. It is spacious, comfortable, cosy and perfectly located. All that you may need, is available. Siena makes you very welcome and is extremely helpful, if needed
If you want to stay downtown in Seattle, this is the place to be!!"
2620429,51129169,2015-10-18,26905994,Samantha,"This is a fun place in a great location, walking distance to the monorail to Seattle Center, pike street market, shopping, restaurants, and a quick trip from airport.  Siena is a welcoming and lovely host, both in person, and with all the thoughtful touches in the place...such as wine, beer, coffee, and chocolate in the fridge.  We stayed there with two small children, and there was plenty of space for all of us to relax.  It is very clean and well-kept.  I would highly recommend the whole experience, and would love to stay there again!"
2620429,52572920,2015-10-31,34631118,Bernt,"Siena is the perfect host. Great information, that you can read while having a beer that was waiting for us in the fridge. Great space and very central. Perfect if you are going to the Convention center next door."
2620429,53452658,2015-11-09,38510621,Gabe,Siena was great!  She made our first AirBnB experience one to remember.  The neighborhood was great and it was easy access to all the sights and attractions of Seattle.  The condo was as described and access to the building was both safe and easy.
2620429,54165808,2015-11-16,8442322,Dan,"Loved the friendly and helpful labels on various things around the apartment.
Welcome snacks (including beer!) was a wonderful touch.
Fully stocked medicine cabinet came in very handy
We were Siena's first visitors with children, so Siena bought and set up a portable crib for us, which was essential.
Incredible location. Just a quick walk or super quick drive to anything and everything."
2620429,54895811,2015-11-25,47322104,Lee,My family stayed in Siena's Seattle home for several days. We had a wonderful experience. We had an infant with us. Siena bought a pack n play because we had an infant with us. Her communication was excellent. If we ever make it back to Seattle we would not hesitate to stay at her apt. 
2620429,56362078,2015-12-13,33184741,Kieren,"The best Airbnb experience ever. Look no where else for accomodation in Seattle except for sienas apartment. Located a few blocks from the famous and amazing pike place market in downtown, and near some great shops, this place is perfect for anyone visiting Seattle. The apartment was very clean and comfortable we were able to easily accommodate five people. We received welcome snacks and drinks which was a nice treat after a long flight. Siena is the best host, I hope everyone who visits her apartment gets the opportunity to meet her. She definitely goes out of her way to make her guests feel at home and comfortable in a new city. From a personalised welcome letter to a long list of sights and tips, our stay in Seattle was so great because of this amazing accomodation. The beds were very comfortable, the showers were amazing, the towels as soft as a cloud, and everything was provided for us. I highly recommend staying at sienas apartment, don't look anywhere else because there's no where better to stay."
2620429,57012196,2015-12-21,24713877,Matt,"Sienna's place was amazing and awesomely located. This made our stay in Seattle very enjoyable. Sienna was fantastic and there was nothing she couldn't help with. Thanks so much, can't wait to be back! "
2620429,58114553,2016-01-01,34618900,Mark,The apartment was a perfect home base for our family in Seattle. Would absolutely stay again. Siena was a great host. We are new to Airbnb and she made the extra effort to make our experience perfect!
3096191,15455036,2014-07-09,11211622,Madhu,"We didn't have good experience at all. There was no tea or coffee kettle, no toaster. Hot water problem in the bathtub, really have to jigle to get water. Shower faucet was not working. Sink drain was clogged. Rug was dirty. Bedroom door had whole. There was smell in the building. This house is very cheap furnished. Apt. Is on 3rd floor but ne elevator. There was water in soap bottle instead soap in the bathroom. Kitchen utensils were bad. I never met host but my friends met them. We were very unhappy."
3096191,15698055,2014-07-14,2545729,Kristian,"The apartment is in a quiet neighborhood and was very clean. The description mentioned it was upgraded, which I would expect to mean newer kitchen and baths. There was nothing wrong with them, they were just older and definitely not upgraded. The only problem we encountered was they didn't leave enough towels. We let them know there would be 4 staying but we were only left 2 towels. I emailed around midnight when we realized and they brought us additional towels around noon the next day."
3096191,16407418,2014-07-27,6065639,Matthew,It was a pleasant place in a quiet building. As advertised. The host did a nice job trying to accommodate us and bring in extra bedding because we had 4 unrelated people trying to stay there.
3096191,16836413,2014-08-03,9812010,Steven,"Apartment is in an excellent location, especially if one wants to be close to the UW campus and the University District with its many restaurants and shops. The apartment is very pleasant, clean and comfortable. The neighborhood is quiet and pleasant. Upon arrival, we thought that parking might be a challenge but we had no problem parking right in front of the building all four nights that we were there. It is on the fourth floor and is a walk-up so that could be a challenge for some.  "
3096191,17352654,2014-08-11,16834014,Paula,"Following are the positives:
- two full bathrooms and two bedrooms with comfortable beds;
- it's in a quiet neighborhood and walking distance to upscale shops, a large grocery store and a variety of good restaurants;
-it has wifi.
- there is a security lock at front entrance.

The negatives:
- the apartment is bare bones. The kitchen has a few unmatched plates, bowls, cups, silverware and only 2 glasses.  There are a few pots & pans but we had to ask for a coffee maker;
- there are no waste baskets, just a garbage container in the kitchen;
- we had 3 towels for 3 of us & had to ask for wash cloths and hand towels but never got the hand towels.  No rug or shower mat in bathroom either;
- no broom/dustpan;
- it's on the 4th floor & the entrance, stairs and hallways were very dirty;
-there is a view but it's not gorgeous, mostly the tops of buildings through some trees.

Our main complaint was at check in.  We had arranged with Ren, the host, to call him 30 minutes prior to our arrival (about 9:39 am) and he or his wife would meet us there.  I left several voicemails, emails & texts for Ren with no reply over 7 hours.  His wife's VM box was full.  When I finally reached his wife, she first said she didn't know we had a reservation, then said we were expected at 2:00 or 3:00, then told us we couldn't get in for a couple of hours because the apartment was being cleaned!  We drove over to the apt.  She was there, gave us the keys but said we couldn't move in until the cleaning was done. We left and were finally able to settle in 9 hours after our agreed-upon time.  I have high praise of Airbnb's Caelen S. the customer service staff who was responsive and efficient.  She told us the Airbnb would put us in a hotel that night & find us housing for the remaining 6 days and offered to pay for our meals we ate while waiting to get into the apt.

Paula & Doug"
3096191,18338882,2014-08-25,5530406,Ronald,"The location of this apartment is quiet and convenient -- centrally located in the University District and a short drive to many areas include downtown Seattle and Ballard. The interior is simple but got the job done.

However, there were several communication mishaps with the host which could have been avoided and created much confusion during check in. Also, the wireless network had a tendency to go down every once in a while which isn't a big deal if you're out a lot, but was a hassle for us."
3096191,18595025,2014-08-28,20334682,Jack,"This apartment is near WU on a hidden and quiet dead-end street with very little traffic and lots of trees. The 4-story building is functional, but not particularly attractive or clean. The apartment is very large and can comfortably accommodate 2 couples. I guess it caters to students and university visitors. It was very quiet while I was there. There is no elevator, so mobility-impaired guests would have difficulty getting to the 4th floor. The apartment was functional. Everything (kitchen, bathroom, shower, towels, fans, lights) worked adequately. Cleanliness is an issue. There is ingrained dirt and stains on walls and carpets in the building and even in the apartment, that makes one question whether it is real dirt or the remnants of past dirt. And it makes one question the cleanliness of sheets and towels, though I had no particular reason to doubt that those were clean. The host was available and responsive to emails, and they were there when I arrived and helped me with my bags. All in all, I had a good experience there."
3096191,18889152,2014-09-02,15945031,Jordan,"The apartment was fine for our stay and had everything we (website hidden) responded quickly each time I sent a message.

Positives:
* Host was responsive to our messages
* Parking right in front on the street was easy
* Drive to downtown was usually about 15m
* There is a nice open air mall s better than some, but nothing gorgeous."
4118282,22009793,2014-10-27,22958266,David,Excellent place!!  Very clean and the owner was very helpful and accommodating.  Bathroom was amazing and the heated floors and towel rack were great!  Highly recommended!
4118282,22220573,2014-11-01,23048098,Bruce,"This was a lovely place to stay. Very well laid out, and the bathroom with heated floor and the giant shower with rain shower head is fantastic. The location is great, very close to the terrific restaurants in Ballard. I would definitely come back."
4118282,22667575,2014-11-11,22893182,Wendy,"Julien was welcoming and accommodating. Our family of  4 enjoyed staying in this beautiful townhouse. The neighborhood was perfect for us! Ballard is great and it's within driving distance to downtown Seattle. The townhouse was clean, spacious and the beds were super comfy! The heated floors in the bathroom were awesome in the morning and the shower is my dream shower! Highly recommend staying here!! We will be back!"
4118282,23053868,2014-11-21,20975647,Kelsi,"We loved this house! Comfortable beds and shower was amazing. We enjoyed watching movies on Netflix. The host provided very specific and helpful instructions on things like how to work the shower, heater, and complicated door lock. 

Tip for staying here (and most air bnb homes): bring your own blow dryer!"
4118282,23244150,2014-11-26,22906541,Wanda,"This was our first time using airbnb. Although we personally did not meet our hosts, communication via email was excellent. The two bedroom townhouse with a fully stocked kitchen made the experience even more enjoyable as we purchased local food from nearby Ballard open market. The beds were comfortable and the heated bathroom was a dream."
4118282,24007847,2014-12-16,24412478,Natosha,"Julien's condo is beautiful and in a great location. Communicating with Julien was super easy, he is way more responsive than are my own family and friends! His instructions for the condo were thorough and any questions we had he was immediately responsive. This was my first Airbnb experience and it was wonderful thanks to Julien!"
4118282,24310768,2014-12-25,22200510,Andrew,Nice apartment.
4118282,24475885,2014-12-29,23543483,Linda,"Our experience was just right. Beds were comfortable, rooms were clean and directions for everything were well written. We only used the space for sleeping, so it was fine. "
4118282,24574067,2014-12-30,16351484,Megan,"We recently relocated from the Bay Area, and needed a place to stay our first night in town. Julien's place was perfect! The townhouse was spacious, bright, and clean, and Julien was communicative, welcoming and accommodating. Great neighborhood, house directions were easy to follow, beds were comfy, bathroom/shower were delightful. Highly recommend.

Thanks Julien! "
4118282,25083821,2015-01-06,22734253,Gregg,"Julien's house was very amazing! He's very communicative and polite! His house was very clean and located in the midst of Ballard which is very nice because you could travel by foot or bus nearly! He's also very responsive and understanding. I love the features that he had in his hometown, such as the bathroom floor, kitchen, and he even provide roku! This house made my first experience using Airbnb wonderful!! Me and my family have stayed in this house 2 different times and we look forward to our next stay at Julien's house!!"
4118282,25286072,2015-01-11,25247077,Joyce,"Julien's place was lovely, warm, clean, and convenient. We met, on the second day, when he came by to change a lightbulb, and he was very easy-going and helpful. Parking was a relative breeze (surprise!), and it was nice to have the convenience of a washer and dryer in the apartment. Ballard is a wonderful neighborhood, and I will look for lodging here again, the next time I visit Seattle.
"
4118282,25365008,2015-01-13,8284104,Jill,"Julien was a great host... Had instructions for everything detailed out and checked in with us upon our arrival. Very clean and spacious townhouse. The townhouse is on a busy road so there is some traffic noise in the bedroom, but it's in an urban neighborhood and very close to all of the great shops, restaurants and bars in Ballard.
Would be more than happy to stay hear again!"
4118282,25550068,2015-01-19,870577,Alan,"This is one of the best AirBnB places we have ever stayed in.  Large, spacious house with great furnishings in a cool area.  A bus out the front will have you in downtown Seattle in 30 minutes or it's a short 15 minute walk to Ballard where there are a huge number of restaurants, bars and cafes.

Julien did everything possible to make our stay comfortable and easy.  Check in and out was a breeze.

I would definitely recommend this place to all my friends and have no hesitation staying here again if we find ourselves back in Seattle."
4118282,25642050,2015-01-21,20371519,Diana,"   This place has a problem--you can't lock the front door. We had four intelligent, educated, competent adults puzzling over the elaborate instructions, and we could not get it to engage. The lock needs to be replaced before you rent it again.
   It's a nice place--bamboo floors, fancy shower--but sparsely furnished. There are no pictures on the walls, and the living room echoes in the emptiness.
   But it is as advertised. The kitchen is well stocked with dishes and pans and all. The beds are super comfy, and there are lots of pillows."
4118282,25879229,2015-01-28,25451873,Marie,The host was helpful with questions that I had. The space was as described and very clean.
4118282,26062294,2015-02-02,18233635,Ml,Thank you. The space was as described and great for walking distance attractions! 
4118282,26343384,2015-02-09,4847524,David,"Great place, great neighborhood, great host.  All directions were spelled out nicely making check in and check out a breeze. Will plan to stay next time we are in town."
4118282,26746343,2015-02-18,26324418,Cate,"We had a wonderful trip. Julien made us feel right at home and provided us with lots of useful information about the apartment and the neighborhood.  The apartment was spacious and very clean. It was in a great location with just a quick walk to many bars, restaurants, and public transportation.  We would definitely stay there again. "
4118282,26990533,2015-02-23,2083284,Rain,"Julien was an amazing host. He went above and beyond to recommend places to visit and eats to check out. His place is very clean, warm, and modern. Close  to the main  area in Ballard with lots of things to do. LOVED the heated tiles and the fancy shower. Towels were thick and comfy, beds were big and inviting, and should you have a car-parking was a breeze. I couldn't figure out how to work the Roku the first night we were there and Julien came to immediate rescue with batteries and then came back a second time to set it up for us so it was ready for use when we got back. He responds quickly to inquiries and communicates well. He was accommodating to us and let us drop off our luggage hours before check in time and we were actually a bit late in checking out but he was very kind and understanding. He had a house manual that thoroughly provided all the information we needed on the place. Thank you so very much for having us, we look forward to our next stay with you."
4118282,27136139,2015-02-26,27181362,Kevin,"Julien made sure I had everything I needed before I thought to ask. The place is very clean with room to spread out and has nice little features like the heated tile floor in the bathroom. The location was perfect as well, I will be returning the next time I am in Seattle."
4118282,27332075,2015-03-02,7862649,Moon,"Love this apartment, clean, comfy and a great location close to downtown Ballard. Perfect for a weekend getaway with friends. The well thought out booklet for the house came in handy! Would recommend to anyone!
Thanks Julien"

4118282,27577227,2015-03-08,8073575,Sarah,Julien's townhome is a lovely and comfortable place.  Great location and spotlessly clean.  We would definitely think of staying there again on a future trip to Seattle.  
4118282,27688023,2015-03-09,28465143,Shanel,The home was very clean and everything was as described in the listing. Great location and plenty of space. There were four of us staying in the home and we were all very pleased. Thank you!
4118282,28086096,2015-03-17,24082561,Miriam,This townhouse was very clean and had all the essentials for a relaxing stay. Good location within walking distance to Cafe Besalu's tasty pastries and coffee.
4118282,28241255,2015-03-20,19968492,Jay,Julien was great host.  Would live at this townhouse...hope to come back. Thanks.
4118282,28598694,2015-03-27,18058327,Pamela,My mother and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Julien's townhouse. We were there for a week and it was nice to come back after a day of exploring. Both beds were very comfortable and the place was immaculate. We were happy we chose the Ballard neighborhood. It was like coming home to a small village. Julien responded to questions and concerns within minutes. Highly recommend! Finally if you have a car take it on the ferry to Brainbridge island and and if not walk onto the ferry. It is a lovely day trip. 
4118282,29036865,2015-04-03,8214412,Susan,"My husband, son and I stayed here while visiting our daughter who lives in Ballard.  Julien was very responsive.  Townhouse matched description.  Be sure to get to cafe Besalu for pastry and Sunset park for views.  "
4118282,30307770,2015-04-20,8995883,John,"Julien's town home was comfortable, spacious for the four of us, very clean, well appointed, and full of light. Julien's house guide is precise and thorough and he was helpful in recommending favorites amongst the many many nearby restaurants and activities of Ballard. His response time to questions is nearly immediate. Parking is on the street or around the corner and was never a problem for us. There are lots of places in Ballard within walking distance. We truly enjoyed our stay here. "
4118282,30635144,2015-04-25,5510499,Erin,"The home was wonderful and a great layout and location!  We really enjoyed having space to relax while we enjoyed the city!  It was within walking distance to so many cute shops, restaurants and the grocery store!  There was also a nice book with recommendations of where to eat and where to visit in the condo. 
Hosts were great and able to be reached easily for questions!
"
4118282,30807845,2015-04-27,4247121,Eric,Photos were accurate. Julien was helpful the entire way and even texted me the first night to make sure I arrived on time. The apt was very clean. THE BATHROOM IS SO NICE!!!
4118282,31648933,2015-05-08,14554731,Gillian,"This Ballard townhouse was so cozy and was the perfect place for our Seattle trip. We loved the location, loved having an actual house to make our base in between wandering around the city, and Julien was quick to respond to all of our questions and concerns. He and his wife also gave us great recommendations for what to do in the area.  Ballard is an amazing neighborhood, and we were really glad to be staying there. Everything about our stay was efficient and as we hoped! The townhouse was clean, well-appointed, and we would love to stay there again.  "
4118282,31861127,2015-05-10,9554385,Jack,"Had an excellent stay at Julien's spot!! The place is super spacious and clean and nice and in a really cool neighborhood that we actually never left the 2 days we were in town. (It helped that we played at the Tractor Tavern down the street which is a really cool little music venue btw.) Julien was very responsive even though we booked last minute, and sent over a detailed and nicely organized packet of info on the house, like how to use the shower, laundry, locking up, etc. Bathroom and shower were hella nice too, and a cute little balcony. Would definitely stay here again."
4118282,31918305,2015-05-11,15015650,Rick,This was a very comfortable two bedroom in the popular Ballard neighborhood.  It's located on a busy street.  It was a warm evening and we  left our bedroom window open.   It was a bit noisy from the traffic. I would definitely recommend it. 
4118282,32214845,2015-05-15,23589835,Jeff,"Julien went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and welcome. We absolutely loved our stay and would stay here again in a heartbeat. As advertised, the townhouse was very clean. Highly recommend if you're looking to stay in Ballard (which I would also recommend doing)."
4118282,32630552,2015-05-19,167544,Eris," The place is exactly as described. It looks even better in person. I didn't meet him, but when I called about checking out, he was very kind and provided a great breakfast recommendation. I would stay here again hands-down."
4118282,32668400,2015-05-19,479096,Aaron,"Julien was great!  The day I was arriving there was an annual ""Norwegian Pride Parade"" in Ballard and he gave me great instructions on how to avoid getting caught up in traffic in getting to his Airbnb.  My co-worker and I stayed in the home as part of a work trip.  House was awesome...  Julien was also SUPER fast at responding to my enquiry.  Made me feel confident that everything would go smoothly, as it did."
4118282,32907916,2015-05-23,31763500,Greg,"Thanks to Julien for hosting us.  We stayed with our three kids in the townhouse for 4 nights while the floors in our house were being refinished.  The listing was accurate, and we felt right at home from start to finish.  There was plenty of space in the front bedroom for two twin aero-beds in addition to the bed that was there.  It was an easy half-mile walk down 24th to the center of Ballard."
4118282,33041902,2015-05-24,28199551,Megan,"Julien was very helpful and friendly when coordinating and the place is fantastic.  It worked well for five people, because the place is so spacious.  I only stayed one night, but would definitely have wanted to stay longer to make use of the great kitchen, living room, and amenities. "
4118282,33293678,2015-05-26,10737603,Liam,Apartment was awesome!  Julien was super helpful and responsive.  Everything was clean and easy. 
4118282,33831327,2015-06-01,15976108,Brick,Julien's place was perfect for us.  Everything was clean and looked exactly as it did in the photos.  The couch is comfortable in the living room.  We enjoyed watching a couple Netflix and Youtube videos in the evening after we came back from exploring Seattle.  The bedrooms were great and everyone enjoyed the fancy shower!
4118282,33974437,2015-06-02,16086657,Heather,Had to cancel last minute.  Julien was super easy to work with.
4118282,34587505,2015-06-09,13977018,Kelsey,"Julien was very easy to communicate with and our check-in/out was seamless. The home had all the basics we needed to cook and feel right at home. The location was convenient to Seattle, restaurants, and nightlife. Julien provided lots of awesome recommendations as well, which helped get our short stay off on the right note. I would definitely consider staying again the next time I'm up in Seattle. Thanks for having us, Julien!"
4118282,34611369,2015-06-09,1406509,Justin,Julien was a great host! He was quick to respond throughout my stay and provided detailed info on any and all questions. The house itself was great. Lots of space and very clean. 
4118282,35390151,2015-06-18,33068684,Sarah,Overall our experience was very good.  Ballard is a great community and one that was easy to get around in.                  
4118282,35680790,2015-06-21,11461350,Alex,"My family's stay in Julien's townhome was fantastic. It was the perfection combination of space and privacy with accessibility to downtown Ballard and Seattle. Julien's guidebook was exceedingly helpful - we ended up eating at two of the restaurants he recommended, both of which were excellent and only a ten minute walk away. 

Julien was kind enough to leave Keurig coffee for us, something which was greatly appreciated for a caffeine addict such as me. Both the kitchen and main bathroom were modern, clean, and stylish, and we had no trouble finding parking within a block of the residence."
4118282,36105034,2015-06-25,33189427,Jennifer,"Julien was incredibly accommodating and helpful.  The apartment was clean and bright. His welcome manual was detailed and clear, with step-by-step instructions for all aspects of the home, from the lock on the door to controlling the heat. We loved the neighborhood and appreciated the suggestions for local restaurants and services.  The bathroom is beautiful, so tasteful and luxurious!  Thanks for a great stay!"
4118282,36433716,2015-06-28,3851816,Josh And Conee,"Julien provided us with a very helpful house manual that answered all questions we had. Pictures listed are accurate and the shower is great. Our only complaint about our stay is that we happened to come during a heat wave and there was no AC in the house (or fans) to make it more comfortable. We had to keep windows open and the street was pretty noisy. Overall, we had a great stay in Ballard and the location of the house was very ideal to explore easily without a car. Would return!"
4118282,36544008,2015-06-29,25467348,Sabrina,Our experience was great! A beautiful home close to the heart of Ballard! Julien was very helpful throughout the booking process to make sure things went smoothly! 
4118282,37004787,2015-07-03,22266556,Justin,"Good accommodations, nice place, would rent again!"
4118282,38005294,2015-07-12,9586652,Kevin,Would stay here again. Lots of public parking nearby. Host very accommodating. Thorough guide and easy check in.
4118282,38410355,2015-07-15,25792873,Trudy,"My cousins and I really enjoyed Julien's location in Ballard. It's only a few blocks away from Market Street, the center of activity, the vibrant Sunday Farmer's Market, Starbucks and shops. We liked that there was a grocery store so near by and that the reknown ship locks, lovely gardens and fish ladder were a seven minute drive away. It was also easy for us to drive down the street and get on the major thoroughfare and within 10- 15 minutes be able to go sightseeing at some of the major tourist attractions. Julien's home is trendy, bright and cheery with lots of space to move around in. Nice kitchen stocked with the essentials. All the necessities we needed were there including comfortable beds. My cousins and I agreed, we would definitely stay here again."
4118282,39706317,2015-07-25,39071370,John,"Great place.  We just stayed overnight, and used very little of the amenities available, but it was very practical, very nice, and in a great spot.  It is within walking distance to the center of Ballard (restaurants etc.) and there are local coffee shops etc very close to the condo.  
I will definitely stay there again if the opportunity presents itself - no question.  "
4118282,40020153,2015-07-27,20861587,Gian-Marco,The listing was very accurate and the place was very clean. The hosts were extremely nice and were very quick to respond to any questions we had. If i'm back in this area I would stay again. 
4118282,40157553,2015-07-28,38044447,Sophia,Nice place to stay for a family :-)
4118282,40291916,2015-07-29,15121499,Kathryn,"Julien is a fantastic host! Super easy to communicate with and takes great care to make guests feel welcome. The listing is lovely and in a fantastic location, just a few blocks away from restaurants, shops, parks .. the best of Ballard! Highly recommend and would happily stay here again!"
4118282,40651812,2015-08-01,8168743,Galen,My hosts were great even though I did not meet them.  They always got back to me promptly and the house manual was very informative.
4118282,41253168,2015-08-05,32300944,Julie,"Clean, comfortable, and great location. Hosts were very friendly and helpful. "
4118282,42007637,2015-08-10,38689267,Kai,"The townhome advertised was as expected. The rooms, restrooms, kitchen, and the rest of the rooms were clean. Our family of five stayed in the townhome for six days. Two person per bed, and the fifth person used a (borrowed) air mattress. 
This home met our needs,including extra sheets and blanket for our air mattress. 
A parking space would have been nice, but we always found a street parking within the block, so it was OK. 
We would definitely stay in this townhouse again. I recommend this place. Please note that the home is a 3-story, so it's not ADA friendly. "
4118282,42188914,2015-08-11,39475373,Tracy,"Just as adverstised! Clean, spacious, walking distance to Ballard's restaurants and shops. We would definitely stay again. Natalie even dropped by to provide coffee for the morning. We were there when it was pretty warm, so the street noise was noticable with the windows open. But that wouldn't stop me from staying again. Thanks!! "
4118282,42745538,2015-08-15,8595438,Seth,"Julien and Natalie were very responsive and helpful. Their place is comfortable and nice, and for those wanting a Seattle neighborhood experience (great Ballard location), highly recommended."
