3835995,24776820,2015-01-02,22905715,Noel,Was just as described and pictures were accurate. Very inviting and clean. A bottle of wine was a lovely touch. We enjoyed our stay!
3835995,25072651,2015-01-05,7529931,Lisa,"Jamie was great!  The chocolate and wine were a plus.  The place was spotless.  Best pillows ever.  I ended up blowing a fuse by using my hairdryer and the room heater at the same time (same thing happens in my place), and they were able to reset the breaker for me right away.  She even texted me while I was out later to let me know the dome light was on in my car!!  Dead battery crisis averted.  
I fully expected to hear people walking around above me, which I didn't.  Would definitely stay again!"
3835995,25222734,2015-01-09,25660173,Stephanie,Jamie did a great job of making our stay comfortable. She not only had all the amenities necessary she gave us suggestions of local restaurants. Here place was very comfortable and cozy. The surrounding area was also very nice and safe. I would recommend this to other traveling to Seattle.
3835995,25301658,2015-01-11,3836613,Serina,"This was one of our best airbnb experiences, very tastefully refinished space with lots of attention to the existing character. Jamie was very flexible and generous host."
3835995,25336665,2015-01-12,25607192,Kelsey,"It was a nice cozy place. The heat in the bedroom worked great, maybe a little too great ha. We had to turn off in the middle of the night. The wine of course was a nice addition."
3835995,25420455,2015-01-15,10089162,Scott,"Jamie was lovely. She was overly accommodating, but not too much. 
The place was quaint, nice and clean. Good bed and bathroom. Coffee from a Keureg. Sofa. A nice place. 
Thank you Jamie. "

3835995,25804314,2015-01-26,10103404,Ann,"
Jamie's basement apartment was clean, quiet and comfortable.  It is centrally located, yet on a quiet street.  She lets guests park in her driveway, which is convenient.  She had coffee, yogurt and wine available.  It was a good experience to stay there."
3835995,25977430,2015-01-31,8883656,Lily,"Host was very helpful, apartment was nice and clean and very user friendly/comfortable. Neighborhood is awesome and close to Ballard businesses. Great experience overall, would definitely recommend it"
3835995,26076334,2015-02-02,16011533,Jason,"One again we had a wonderful experience staying here! We felt so welcomed with the wine, chocolate, tea, and coffee available. The place is so comfy and we slept very well. We also love the Mrs. Meyer's hand soap and Trader Joe's products! I would recommend staying here if you enjoy the Ballard and Phinney Ridge area! There are so many great coffee shops and restaurants nearby. "
3835995,26163378,2015-02-05,5540194,Linda,"We had a great stay at Jamie's in Ballard -- location was good, the bed and furniture were comfortable, and everything worked!  We especially loved the ottoman to put our feet up, books she shared, and the wine & chocolate bar:)"
3835995,26235729,2015-02-07,1326282,Daniel,"This is a beautiful place, great quiet neighborhood, wonderful hospitality (the bottle of wine was a nice touch)."
3835995,26298160,2015-02-09,10636987,Nancy,"We felt welcome when we arrived because the apartment was spotlessly clean and ready for us.  We appreciated having a place to park in the driveway and motion detector lights to guide our way to the apartment.  The neighborhood is very safe & quiet and has many fun shops and restaurants nearby.
The apartment has a very comfy bed, plus the bed & bath linens are very nice quality.  Having a small fridge, microwave & beverage maker is very convenient, plus the host graciously provides treats like wine and yogurt.  We think it's such an excellent value for the money, we've stayed here twice!"
3835995,26606400,2015-02-16,9721494,Rachel,"We loved this place!  A friend and I stayed here over a long weekend and were very happy with our experience.  First, the place had an ideal location for us and we could walk (1 -1.5 miles) to any shop or restaurant in the Ballard area.  The neighborhood and all of Ballard were so much fun to explore.  Second, it was really clean, cute, and had a lot of amenities (e.g., iron, hair dryer, shampoo).  We blew a fuse using the hair dryer one day, we called the owner and within a minute (literally) the power was back on - doesn't get any easier than that.  Would definitely recommend this place to a friend!"
3835995,26702779,2015-02-17,26502125,Kirk,Jamie was an awesome host.  We got to meet her on arrival and she personally walked us to our apartment.  She provided the most amenities out of any place we've stayed at. The wine and chocolate were the deal-breaker.   She provided many amenities but we did not use them all.  I was so glad to stay there.  Everything was clean and the back area was well lit when leaving or arriving in the dark.  I give her an A+.  Thanks for the pleasant stay and we will look you up again when we visit Seattle.
3835995,27068495,2015-02-24,27436709,Pete,"This place was PERFECT in every way. Very clean, very warm, plenty of hot water. The bed was sooo comfortable. I didn't have any of the bottle of wine that was there when I got there mainly because of Seattles great beers, but I did take the chocolate. I hope to use this place in the future. Thank you, Thank you Jamie!"
3835995,27498156,2015-03-06,2187925,Jana,Jamie was extremely accommodating and responded immediately to all messages! Great place!
3835995,27619060,2015-03-08,26208231,Lindsey,"I had a great stay. The apartment  was exactly as pictured. I didn't meet the hosts in person but they were very responsive and had many nice extras that enhanced my stay: wine and chocolate, brita pitcher, refreshing bath products, luggage rack in the closet, and a space heater. It's a lower level unit but doesn't feel like a dungeon. The space heater came in handy at night when things cooled down a bit. 

Also, this place is in a fun neighborhood. It was a pleasant walk over to the main streets of Ballard for brunch and browsing. Good overall rental."
3835995,27668814,2015-03-09,7227200,Amy & Dan,Jamie & Dave are lovely hosts.  The apartment is comfortable and well-appointed.  The location is great.  We walked a couple of blocks for an excellent breakfast.  We will definitely be back!  Dan & Amy

She was also very helpful with information about public transportations and local attractions to visit around town. We loved the City and already planning our next visit, and know exactly where we'll be staying. Thank you Jaimie."
3835995,28522360,2015-03-25,27662810,Charles,"Jamie was great! The place is SUPER clean, quiet and flat out great! I would not hesitate to rent this place again. Thanks Jamie!"
3835995,28663197,2015-03-28,28655192,Teri,"This was my first Airbnb experience. And I couldn't be more delighted. First, my accommodations were exactly as detailed in the descriptions, a ""Ballard Craftsman Charmer. "" The rooms were impeccably clean, with large fluffy towels, a well made bed and plenty of coffee.
This listing is an easy two block walk from the bus line. The neighborhood is simply lovely. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.

The neighborhood is lovely; had a fabulous meal at a nearby restaurant; close to many different neighborhoods, Phiney, Fremont, etc. Room was very clean and accurate to pictures. Kurig coffee was a delight to get us going in the morning to the airport. The garden is delightful, especially in the spring."

The suite was SUPER clean and had everything we needed. Lots of towels, hair dryers, coffee maker, fridge. Jamie even left us a bottle of wine, chocolate and yogurt! The bed was also super comfy. The house is located in a beautiful neighborhood and walkable to downtown Ballard (about 15 min) We did a self-guided tour of some of the local breweries in the neighborhood and it was the perfect location to start and end our tour. We checked out the awesome farmers market in Ballard Sunday am and enjoyed some of the great shops and resturants. Highly Recommend! Jamie is a great host! :) "
3835995,29959250,2015-04-14,18482058,Alec,Jamie was very hospitable and gave us tips on where to go in the area. The place was cozy and welcoming. It was perfect and just what I was looking for. I would highly recommend Jamie to anyone looking for a place in Ballard. 
3835995,30278872,2015-04-20,9097112,Maribel,Absolutely Perfect!  We unexpectedly had a car at our disposal and were able to park in the driveway for our entire stay (street parking is scarce in Ballard).  We made good use of the Keurig and the beer growler provided!  My husband was very excited to find out you can take any growler to any brewery for a fill (not allowed here in San Diego).

She allowed my mom and I to park our rental car in the driveway which made parking very simple.  Upon arrival she provided us with a bottle of wine, chocolate, yogurt, and a Britta water pitcher.

The location is walking distance to downtown Ballard and Jaime was extremely helpful with providing us with dinning recommendations. The yogurt, coffee, wine, chocolate, Britta water pitcher and cable TV shows Jamie cares about the comfort of her guests. We would definitely recommend this place. Thanks Jamie!"

3835995,36148709,2015-06-25,22293671,Jeanne,"First and foremost: Jamie was a life saver. 
I had the great opportunity to send a couple hours at Jamie's airbnb while in Seattle for an interview. The apartment was perfect, cute and had all the necessities (Thank you for that Keurig). She even let me know I left my straightening iron and hair brush in my frazzled, pre-interview state. She made it readily available to pick up. 

Check in was a breeze. She lives right upstairs and available if you need her. Check out was even breezier.

I highly recommend this place, and I definitely recommend staying with Jamie. She's very kind."
3835995,36269277,2015-06-27,30450914,Forrest,"Very cute, clean 1br/1ba with private entrance underneath the main house. Jamie was accommodating to our weird hours and provided us some good suggestions on sights to see on our trip to Seattle. "

The unit was super clean and comfortable, well furnished, and came with a  large quantity of added touches to make our stay more comfortable. Jamie greeted us, took care of us, provided us with information about the neighborhood and city, and genuinely invited us into her home. The bed comfortable and felt cozy and open; it felt like we had rented an apartment, as opposed to a basement. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again if we return to the area. "

"
3835995,40074488,2015-07-28,23076792,Michael,"We rented Jamie's Ballard Craftsman for our maid-of-honor and her husband who traveled to Seattle for our wedding. While we did not stay in the unit, we did visit and found it to be exceptional! Our guests absolutely loved staying here. Jamie was incredibly nice and accommodating during the booking process which took a lot of stress out of the equation. Great place, great host, great neighborhood!"
3835995,40319741,2015-07-30,16494982,Katherine,"The apartment was sparkling clean, with beautifully chosen furniture, paint colors, and decor. Jamie has an extensive library with a wide variety of books and has provided lots of brochures and guide books about Seattle and the Pacific Northwest. There is a very sweet little sitting area just outside the apartment and the plantings in the garden and yard are lovely. The neighborhood is full of adorable houses and close to everything including Slate Coffee Bar.  The apartment is nicely stocked with everything you need for a comfortable stay--even an empty growler that you can have filled at a local brewpub!  "
3835995,40503565,2015-07-31,29277190,Jane,"Jamie did a great job at explaining the home and area to us. She wasn't overbearing, and was very easy to get in touch with if you needed anything. The area was great, and so was the house. We were a little disappointed with the comfort of the bed overall, but the house was great besides that.  The outdoor deck was really nice in the morning.  "
3835995,40896379,2015-08-03,25592974,Sarah,"Wow! This was our first time using Airbnb and I have to say we were very impressed. My main thing in staying in a hotel is most definitely cleanliness. Jamie's wonderful apartment was most definitely sparkling. I was a little apprehensive about trying something new but it was definitely worth it.
Jamie was a wonderful host and interacted with us as much as or as little as we wanted. She gave us wonderful recommendations for local eateries and they were fab.
The apartment was very private, secure and had all the amenities that you'd expect in a really nice hotel room and lots more little luxuries. Everything was provided and Jamie was easily on hand for any queries we had. There was abundant seating room inside and a little table and chairs outside. The shower was fab with some lovely chic toiletries and Jamie left some nice foodie treats in the room also. It's the little extra touches like this that made our stay so welcoming. Plus the coffee machine.
She is a very friendly host and like I said is quite happy to chat or leave you to your own privacy.
The apartment was situated in a nice quiet residential area and was a lovely stroll into Ballard Main Street where the are lots of lovely restaurants, bars, boutiques. 
The bus is at the end of the road if you need it and Jamie also let us park in the driveway. We parked up for the weekend as it was so easy to get around on foot or public transport.
Seattle was a really interesting friendly city to visit. I definitely reccomend anyone to stay in Jamie's. We did and we loved it.
Thank you Jamie.

3835995,42254946,2015-08-12,24796411,Ian,"This was a great little apartment beautifully decorated, immaculately clean and well appointed. 
Jamie was a really nice helpful non intrusive host. 
We thought that visiting Seattle was about visiting the downtown but Jamie suggested that Ballard (where the apartment is) was an area worth considering- she was right it was a lovely a great place to eat and generally walk around.
So the apartment is great, it is about 30 minutes on public transport from downtown ( pike market etc) but also the local area is great. "
3835995,42397947,2015-08-13,34537868,Travis,"Jamie made us feel very welcomed when we arrived. We were welcomed with a bottle of wine. The neighborhood was quiet and relaxing. It was also very close to downtown Ballard. There were tons of restaurants to choose from, and lots to do. "
3835995,42664809,2015-08-15,31990683,Sarah,"Very, very happy with our stay! Jamie's place was cute, clean, in a great location and just what we needed. Jamie was very accommodating and went above and beyond setting the place up for our stay! We will look her up again if we go back!"
3835995,43043173,2015-08-17,33700750,Christina,"Jamie was a wonderful host. From the moment we arrived until we left, we felt welcomed and extremely comfortable. It was the perfect location and very close to downtown. Jamie was willing to help us with any questions should we need help. I would highly recommend her listing and would go back if the opportunity presents itself. Thanks so much for the hospitality. "
3835995,43612882,2015-08-21,29590276,Gerd,"Thank you for the cozy stay.  Jamie was very welcoming.  The neighborhood was quiet, bed good, very clean and loved the shower!

3835995,44892721,2015-08-30,32439766,Thomas,Place was clean and welcoming located  in a quiet neighborhood. Jamie responded to emails quickly with clear directions. Place made us feel home after a long day out.  Worth of mention is it is within walking distance to my new favorite coffee shop for coffee tasting. 
3835995,45070825,2015-08-31,22896061,Keenan,Great place in an perfect location. One of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on.
3835995,45340719,2015-09-01,3240106,Peter,"The place was perfect for our 1-night getaway to Seattle. Jamie was able to accommodate us (2 adults, 1 kid) without a problem. The place has everything we needed, and a few nice welcome gifts, which were appreciated. The place is clean, and the Jamie was friendly and knowledgeable. "

3835995,45609240,2015-09-04,30145054,Mackenzie,"Even though we arrived late at night, Jaime was so welcoming and informative. The stay area is great because you have your own patio area, own entrance, and she gets you all set up with coffee and yogurt for the morning. She was a wonderful host and the stay area is perfect!"
3835995,45923356,2015-09-07,23031081,Sophie,"Jamie is an amazing host. She's very friendly but she also respects your privacy. The appartment is great and very clean ! Very nice neighbourhood.Nice bed, very nice bathroom, TV, internet and a little patio. We were travelling with a toddler and she even found us a pack and play.

I would highly recommend this place to all travelers. "
3835995,47458976,2015-09-19,27717700,Kimberly,"My husband and I had a great time on our visit to Seattle and Jamie is partly to thank for that.  Her little apartment was a cozy and perfect for us!  We drove there and ended up getting in late, Jamie still came out to greet us and show us around.  
We were busy the whole week with family showing us around but Jamie kept in contact with me, making sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed.  Jamie, next time we are in Seattle, we will contact you again!"
3835995,48061708,2015-09-23,32537147,Dan,Jamie made us feel very welcome upon our arrival offering suggestions of things to do in Seattle.  The space was perfect to come back and relax from a long day of touring Seattle.  The location was great.  A few blocks from bus stops to take you downtown and to the unviversity of Washington's campus.  Also easy walking distance to downtown Ballard.  I could not recommend this location more.
3835995,48259127,2015-09-24,42802959,Mark,"Jamie was an amazing host. Very accommodating with a bright personality. The space was clean, cozy and affordable. We will absolutely stay with her again when we're back in the neighborhood!"

The location of the apartment is great, walking distance to so much that Ballard has to offer and to public transportation.   We loved this neighborhood!  Lastly, the space is perfect, this was a great place to relax after our busy days.  I would recommend this airbnb to anyone visiting Seattle."
3835995,49351963,2015-10-03,4676817,Shasta,"My boyfriend and I had a great stay at Jamie's listing. We were only in town for about 12 hours, so not a lot of time to get settled in, but everything was fantastic. Jamie very kindly let us check in late, as we were driving to Seattle after work, and even had a bottle of wine waiting for us in the cottage. She had great restaurant recommendations and was quick to see if there was anything else we needed for our stay. Her neighborhood is wonderful - I wish we'd had more time to explore! I'd definitely recommend staying with Jamie if you find yourself in Seattle. "
3835995,49567441,2015-10-04,32378350,Kevin,Jaime was super inviting and helpful when we arrived. Knew exactly where we should get food and a drink within walking distance and welcomed us with a bottle of wine and chocolate! The apartment is tucked in the backyard among an awesome garden and the neighborhood is centrally located. 
3835995,49768883,2015-10-06,9340613,Lauren,"The Ballard Craftsman Charmer was exactly what my husband and I had hoped for: cozy, comfortable, and clean. It is located in a great neighborhood with easy access to many great areas in Seattle. Jamie was a great host who made us feel at home. My husband and I really enjoyed our stay and plan to visit again soon!"
3835995,49927281,2015-10-07,44708210,Ellen,"We spent one night at Jamie's place and loved it! It was perfect for the one night that we needed it for.  Great bathroom amenities (timer on the fan),  great privacy,  very clean,  and she was super friendly! We would definitely recommend her place to anyone!"

3835995,50321010,2015-10-11,13696631,Shanna,"Jamie was a very gracious hostess who was super accommodating to my requests from before I arrived. Her response time was immediate. The apartment is really cute and was very clean and welcoming. Jamie even left a welcome bottle of wine for me, that was a much needed treat after a long day of travel and missed flights. The bed was really comfortable. I was only there for one night so only saw a little bit of the neighborhood, but very quaint from what I saw. I hope to return and would absolutely stay with Jamie again. "
3835995,50472081,2015-10-12,7630744,Charlotte,Loved the space. The location is perfect. Jamie's place is quite and clean. Jamie was accommodating and gave us our private space. Highly recommended.
3835995,50943093,2015-10-16,44121726,Lisa,Jamie is a wonderful host and very accommodating.  Her place is conveniently located and the neighborhood is nice to walk around. The bed is super comfortable.  Enjoyed my stay!
3835995,51437959,2015-10-20,23899939,Anna,"Jamie was a great host. The apartment was comfortable, clean, and had everything we needed. The wine and coffee were a nice touch. The location is great: in a residential, quiet neighborhood but within walking distance of a few bars and restaurants, and a short drive from everything else Seattle has to offer.  Jamie was available if we needed anything but the apartment itself was totally private. Had a great stay there- thanks Jamie!"
3835995,52083545,2015-10-26,32631168,Debbye,"Jamie and David are wonderful hosts. The apartment was exactly as it appears on the listing. It seems to be newly remodeled and was sparkling clean, the bed is ultra comfortable, and the linens and toiletries provided are of high quality. Jamie left us some treats...a bottle of wine, an organic chocolate bar, yogurt and organic bananas.  There is one spot for off-street parking and there is a small sitting area outside just for guests. The neighborhood is quiet and there are many good restaurants and activities fairly close by. I can't say enough good things about this perfect little pad. We will be back...definitely."
3835995,52994446,2015-11-03,39060615,Kylie,"(I'm writing this review on behalf of my parents, as well as myself. I live near this location in Ballard, but my apartment was just too small to comfortably accommodate for their visit. Basically - they were really happy I found this place!)

If you're planning a trip to Seattle but still want the comforts of home with a hospitable host, I'd highly recommend staying at Jamie's! Her home is beautiful and cozy, located on a safe residential street in the very popular Seattle neighborhood of Ballard.

With this apartment style stay, you get all the essentials - including a very nice bathroom/shower and extremely comfortable bed - plus some extras, including a Keurig coffee maker with a huge assortment of K cups! That was definitely nice to have on hand for the chilly Seattle mornings and evenings.

So lovely, A++
Would stay again!"
3835995,53163779,2015-11-05,22584868,Mitchell,"This is a lovely apartment in the basement of a beautiful home. It is comfortable and well appointed with toiletries, snacks, drinks, a fridge and a microwave. The bed is large and comfy. There is off street parking. It is convenient to the totally hip Ballard neighborhood. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. "
3835995,53431699,2015-11-08,18220206,Andy,Jamie was super communicative & prompt in helping me find a place to house a member of my production crew so quickly when it was a last-minute request. People like her who go above & beyond to help make accommodations in her fantastic location are exactly the reason I like using Airbnb to put up my crew during a film shoot. Thanks Jamie!
3835995,53965492,2015-11-15,43904756,Beth,"Cute, comfortable, and convenient little spot! Jamie and David were very responsive hosts, from answering questions pre-trip, to check-in, touching base during my stay (not intrusively) and on my check-out. They responded to a couple queries early in my stay about the heat and the Keurig, which was much appreciated. The place was SUPER clean and as pictured. Queen bed was comfy; lots of nice towels provided. The treats provided (wine, chocolate (yes!), yogurt and bottled water in the fridge, bananas on the counter) were certainly a lovely surprise. The pix illustrate, but I'd failed to put two and two together, that there is no sink in the kitchenette, so I hand washed in the bathroom sink. Jamie did offer to pick up any dishes needing washing, but as I only did breakfast there, that wasn't necessary.  There IS a hair dryer (think the listing details don't indicate that). I will look them up again; they're super convenient to my kids and granddaughter, and that's what counted for me. Thanks for a very comfortable stay, Jamie!"
3835995,54284614,2015-11-17,5634369,Holly,We have only great things to say about our stay at Jamie's lovely Ballard space. The space was cozy and exceptionally clean. Jamie was an excellent communicator - flexible and accommodating. Loved the Theo chocolate. We would visit again.
3835995,54903751,2015-11-25,3120681,Rachel,"My friend and I had the most wonderful weekend stay at Jaime's!  The place was so cute, and so clean, and Jaime was so sweet to leave wine, chocolate, and coffee.  Jaime responded right away to our questions and checked in to make sure we were having a comfortable stay.  We felt like we had a home away from home during our weekend visit. Thanks, Jaime! "
3835995,55635515,2015-12-03,35569592,Joanne,She met us when we arrived to be sure we had all that we needed ? The neighborhood is fabulous.
3835995,55951683,2015-12-07,24014886,Thor,"All was as advertised. This is a basement (half of the basement) small apartment, with daylight door and window looking out under a deck. The overall environment is pleasant and comfortable. "
3835995,57233537,2015-12-23,35569592,Joanne,"Thank you Jamie and David , you have a nice clean quiet place that we simply enjoy, thanks again for all the snacks and the nice bottle of wine. The bed is so comfortable , and the shower has immediate hot water my husband says you must have a. Constant pressure system in your home, it's great to have all the television channels to choose from though we only watch the news in the evening. Thank you again will be sure to look you up next time were in Seattle!!"
9031119,56733716,2015-12-17,23196381,Paul,"Exactly as pictures - extremely convenient location and very nicely apportioned apartment. Everything I needed to have a great stay was exactly where I thought it would be! Host was very responsive to my emails notifying them of my check-in/check-out, but since they had already thoughtfully provided everything, I didn't need any assistance during the trip. The bed was extremely comfy, and the internet speed was fast as well. Highly recommended and hope to stay again!"
7527242,43005787,2015-08-16,29831955,Cortney,Great location. Beautiful property. All the amenities left were such a treat!
7527242,44040759,2015-08-23,13286474,Belle,"Hi Juliet，we have driven back to Portland. We had very good time in your house. Virginia and her husband are very nice people. If we come to Seattle in the future, we would love to book your house again. Thanks! Belle"
7527242,44742468,2015-08-28,17361959,Darren,"Very responsive hosts!  

The home was very spacious and fun with the sauna and hot tub.  It was quiet, felt secluded even in the city with the home set back form the road.  It is a bit different having someone stopping by the place twice a day to feed/tend to the pets, but it was mentioned to me prior...and they were extremely friendly."
6990882,38657953,2015-07-17,2137626,Nate,Great space and perfect host - Ted was very responsive and set everything up so it was easy for me to just arrive and enjoy the space. I was here on business and needed somewhere that I could relax while not working. The townhouse is beautifully decorated and was just what I needed. Thanks Ted! 
6990882,38921679,2015-07-19,36999272,Christina,"My friends and I absolutely loved staying in Ted's home. The house is beautiful, comfortable, and very spacious. 5 of us slept comfortably in the bedrooms but we could have easily fit several more people. It was in a great location, close to Capitol Hill and downtown Seattle and we felt very safe in the neighborhood. Parking was easy to find, as well. Ted was a great host, very accommodating and quick to reply. I would definitely recommend this home to anyone looking to stay in Seattle. Thanks again, Ted! "
6990882,39083642,2015-07-20,20316668,Thomas,Ted was a wonderful host with a beautiful modern home. He was very accommodating and quick to respond to questions
6990882,42753135,2015-08-15,40081608,Sandy,"Ted's house is fantastic!  We loved our stay in Seattle and wish we would have been able to stay at Ted's home the entire trip.  The house is absolutely gorgeous and we found it to be very comfortable and relaxing!  We utilized all three bedrooms and baths and never had a single problem!  We had rented a large SUV, so we were happy to have ample street parking!  Getting around Seattle was a breeze, due to its great location!  Ted was very quick to answer questions and was a fantastic host.  We hope to visit again!"
6990882,43066594,2015-08-17,9090607,Rafael,The house was absolutely excellent. It was so convenient to get to and from downtown it was basically a straight shot. When we arrived the house was absolutely immaculate. It was so clean and modern very easy to find things in the house. The three bedrooms were awesome and very well appointed and comfortable. The host is very accommodating and made it easy for me to contact him anytime. Anytime I message him he would immediately message back which made it easy to get my questions answered and knew everything about the area. My group and myself there was total of six of us could not have asked for a better experience while staying in Seattle.
6990882,43714163,2015-08-21,41399213,Greg,"My group of three employees were on a weeklong west coast trip. We decided to try Airb&b for the first time and had whole house sites in San Fran, LA and Ted's town home in Seattle for one night each. By far the best place was Ted's. It is virtually new and well stocked. Appliances and furnishings are GREAT. Ted was very helpful and supportive of our schedule and requests. Responses to all our questions were quick and effective.  We would definitely stay at his place again. Location was central and good access to downtown from a quiet neighborhood."
6990882,44129595,2015-08-24,8058071,Chris,Ted has a beautiful home and my 5 friends and I had a great stay. Plenty of room and super clean. Ted was a very responsive and accommodating host. 
6990882,45259859,2015-09-01,36217573,Issac,"The entire interaction with Ted as absolutely wonderful. He was very quick to respond, promptly answering every question no matter the time of day, and gave ample detail in his responses. He made it very easy for us to check in and was flexible. The home itself was absolutely wonderful - the kitchen was well equipped, the bathrooms were spacious, and it fit our entire 10-person group comfortably. I don't think Ted mentions just how great the recliners are - we had people choosing those over bed space! The family / living room was very spacious and easily sat all 10 of us. The location was excellent, very close to the convention center. I think most importantly, I will be looking to stay in this location again next time I am in Seattle. I highly recommend this home."
6990882,45956864,2015-09-07,33075641,Jaclyn,"Ted was completely hospitable, and has a beautiful home! He was available all hours of the day if we had concerns, and had a home manual that told us exactly what we could and could not do.  The home was really large for the price, and very close to downtown and everything there is to see in Seattle. We would highly recommend Ted's home."
6990882,46239834,2015-09-08,43236338,Weilin,"The communication with Ted was pleasant.   He contacted me right after I made reservation and reminded me about the arrangement of cleaning and check in.    There was no surprise when we arrived. 

The house is new and all the equipment are in good condition.    The picture of the kitchen is exactly what we had.    The TV is Netflix ready.   Kids love the reclining sofa and enjoyed watching Netflix.   The bed are comfortable.

There are two things need to mention: 1. the house is next to a busy street.   At night, there were some noise, if you are a light sleeper, you need to be aware;  2. the garage is behind the house, and is not in an easy position to park your car in, especially if you have a big car, so prepare for street parking.

Overall, it was very good experience."
6990882,46736460,2015-09-13,40224477,Brenda,Ted made us feel very welcome and was very prompt to answer all our  messages - as this was our first airbnb stay we had quite a few before we even arrived!  Once we got there everything was clean and very well organized.  The pictures accurately depicted the home and the neighborhood was nice and within walking distance of a grocery store and other amenities. Overall we had a great trip and would recommend staying at Ted's.  He was very accommodating and has a great house.  Thanks Ted!
6990882,47258099,2015-09-17,21542079,Tatiana,"ted's house was perfect for our family vacation to Seattle. with the 3 bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms, there was more than enough space and privacy for our party of 6. the house was extremely clean and had everything we could need. the house is located on a main street and can get a little noisy, but we were all able to sleep just fine. the recliners in the living room were amazing and the perfect place to relax after a long day walking around downtown. we didn't utilize the nearby bus stop, but ubers were readily available and about 15 min/$10 to downtown. the house is also in walking distance to a beautiful park and lake Washington. I would highly recommend ted's house for anyone looking for housing for a bigger group in Seattle. Ted was easy to reach and responded to my questions within minutes."
6990882,47707231,2015-09-21,31305275,Grant,Ted was very welcoming and helpful. It was a pleasure to stay at his home. He made sure we had everything from fresh towels to bottled water ready and waiting. I would highly recommend.
6990882,49880838,2015-10-07,7813689,Hobart,Ted's place is amazing. And he was very prompt in returning emails upon arrival and if I had any questions. Parking on street was very easy and always had parking spots available.  Would stay here again if ever in seattle.

His place is very roomy, very clean, nicely styled, and has a warmer vibe than shown in the photos. The neighborhood is convenient to everything. We had no problem getting downtown or walking over to Capitol Hill. This was an extremely nice place to stay for 5 people - 3 bathrooms is really great - and I would definitely stay here again."
6990882,52626636,2015-10-31,46605844,Carrie,The house is good for family! It's clean and lovely. And Ted is a great guy. He is always there when you need him.

6990882,55194387,2015-11-29,43724512,Sam,We stayed at this location the day before Thanksgiving.  We appreciate that Ted allowed us to check-in a litte earlier so that we could get situated and do grocery shopping for Thanksgiving dinner.  The kitchen is open to the front room allowing all of our family to be together while cooking and enjoying the football games.

The location is great -- quick access to the highway and pretty much all of Seattle. The neighborhoods in the area are so cute! 

The space is the entire basement and is really cozy. It's clean, comfortable and there's a lot of light, which isn't always the case in basements, and I loved the heated floors in the bathroom!

I would recommend Christina's place to anyone!"
7789438,46451979,2015-09-10,767129,Dena,Shay made me feel right at home.  Very accommodating.  The apartment was cozy and decorated in great taste!  I will definitely rent this again when I return to Seattle.
7789438,46791487,2015-09-13,19612237,Tally,"The apartment is fantastic. Everything is precisely as described, perhaps better! It is brand new, fully equipped and extremely pleasant. We didn't want to leave :) 
The location is perfect. A few minutes' walk from Capitol Hill's excellent bars and 10-15 minutes from downtown. 
Although we didn't meet Shay, he was super nice and helpful. While he doesn't live in the area, he's 100% available to answer any questions. 
Will definitely stay here again on our next visit to Seattle. "
7789438,47293754,2015-09-17,42996815,Victor,Great space. Clear arrival and departure instructions. Great experience.
7789438,47774696,2015-09-21,13784271,Gina,"Lovely apartment for a weekend getaway.  Shay was very responsive and had extremely clear instructions for how to get in/out! I very much appreciated how clear everything was.

This neighborhood is the place to be. Lots of restaurants and bars within walking distance.  However, since this is such a happenin' place, there will be rowdy people stumbling home from the bars late at night, and the windows are not the best at keeping out the sound.

The place was very clean and tidy and well decorated.  Very comfortable bed for two people, and although the bedroom was small, there was more than enough space in the living, dining, and kitchen area.  The apartment definitely takes advantage of Seattle's soft sunlight as there are no blinds.  Great natural lighting to help us get our day started each morning! All the appliances and fixtures (and ""stuff"" in the apartment) were in great shape and accommodate two people comfortably.  I would recommend this place for a couple to stay in!"
7789438,48143051,2015-09-23,2019385,Robin,"This is a wonderful place. Shay is a great host and went the extra mile to make us feel welcome. 

The neighbour is quiet and relaxed, with a number of cool bars and restaurants. 

The apartment looks exactly as in the photos but possibly better. It has lovely clean linen and excellent decor....

Thanks Shay!"
7789438,48750514,2015-09-28,11345519,Stephanie,"We had a wonderful time in Seattle! The location of the apartment is perfect. Capitol Hill is an amazing section of the city. It's slightly less urban than downtown and has tons of trendy shops, restaurants and bars. It's also a short walk to all parts of the city - downtown, waterfront, Pikeplace ect. The space itself is cozy and clean. The bathroom was stocked with all essentials needed for traveling. Shay was easy to communicate with and accommodated a later departure time for checkout. I would highly recommend this listing!"
7789438,49808197,2015-10-06,729805,Alyson,"We loved our stay in Seattle! Shay's apartment is bright and clean and had everything we needed (including toothpaste and a hairdryer!). The location was perfect and convenient to awesome restaurants and a quick walk downtown. It was also super easy to communicate with Shay, and he was helpful and accommodating with our schedule."
7789438,50045815,2015-10-08,767129,Dena,Apartment is very cozy and clean.  Shay is very accommodating.
7789438,50473510,2015-10-12,13080419,Jennifer,"The Capitol Hill condo is beautifully appointed, comfortable and clean and located walking distance to all of what makes Seattle great.  
The neighborhood is alive and offers tree lined streets, parks and within a mile, you have eclectic local eateries as well as upscale and trendy fare.  
Shay could not have been better to work with from my initial inquiry to allowing us to check in a little early and check out a little late.  Shay was detailed and very timely in his communication and we felt at home as soon as we arrived. 
Thank you for making our long weekend away so comfortable.
We would love to come back!! 
Jennifer & Don "
7789438,51357516,2015-10-19,6060370,Jessica,"Great apartment, great location! Shay was very helpful, letting us check in before the usual time. "
7789438,51951579,2015-10-25,6545488,Jessie,I had a wonderful stay at Shay's home. His home is exactly as pictured; super cute and cozy. The location made it very convenient to walk to all the trendy bars and restaurants in Capitol Hill. Would definitely stay here again!
7789438,53007062,2015-11-03,9060557,Jordan,"Awesome spot, Shay was more than accommodating. We loved the clean, well decorated space and the location was perfect. "
7789438,53303272,2015-11-07,4152097,Daniel,"The place was exactly as described and immaculately clean. Shay was an extremely accommodating host when it came to check-in, and was very responsive whenever I had a question about the place. Also a fantastic location. Will definitely try to stay here again next time I am in Seattle."
7789438,53527132,2015-11-09,27663408,Monica,"Such a lovely, conveniently located apartment. Decor was wonderful, you really feel at home and happy walking into this apartment! Bed was SO comfy! Very clear and concise directions are provided by the owners. I am giving a 5 star review but do want to note that parking is not ideal. We spent over $60 in parking charges over a 2 day, 2 night stay. "
7789438,53835507,2015-11-13,156663,Duane,Great flat. Right downtown with easy access to parks and Seattle. Funky part of the city too. I'd stay here again next time I'm in the city.
7789438,54914569,2015-11-25,373220,Noam,"This apartment is fantastic. It's located in a great location right in the center of Capital Hill. Plenty of great coffee shops to work from around the neighborhood. Great restaurants as well for the foodies. 

The apartment was spotless when we got there! Has comfy and beautiful sheets as well as towels. Felt like I was at a 5-star hotel! Would definitely recommend."
7789438,55811478,2015-12-06,39874851,Rylan,"My wife and I stayed for a weekend at Shay's place. It's a really nice apartment with stylish decor. It's located in a really cool area of Seattle with some good restaurants and bars nearby. Shay was very accommodating and friendly as well. Overall, a great experience."
7789438,58073144,2015-12-31,44756571,Marcel,Perfect place perfect location 
7789438,58402297,2016-01-02,7426463,Brian,"We had a great experience here. Space was immaculate and Shay responded immediately to all of my questions. Apartment is in a great, central location with easy access to everything you need while in Seattle. I would definitely stay there again!"
5905958,41544459,2015-08-07,5677333,Alexis,"I am very happy with my stay at Rachel's. The place was very nice, roomy, cosy and personal! Great value! Will definitely come again if I get the chance. "
5905958,42069475,2015-08-10,124562,Noah,"Rachel was out of town when we were renting her place, but she ensured a friend was available if we had any requests, and he left the keys in a convenient spot.

Rachel's place is really well located, there's so much cool stuff in Fremont, and as we were arriving by bike from downtown Seattle, we even got to see the famous bridge troll on the way to her place (it's a block and a half away). You'll be only a couple of short blocks away from waterfront standards like Fremont Brewing, and a very short walk to ""downtown"" Fremont itself. The location also provided really convenient access by bike to both Ballard and downtown Seattle by waterfront bike trails.

The place itself is wonderfully decorated, and the bedroom and couch easily accommodated the two of us.  We didn't have time to take advantage of the television, but there were very detailed instructions on how to start a Netflix binge, should you so desire.

We couldn't have asked for a lovelier bit of one-night accommodation that allowed us to explore North Seattle pretty extensively, given our limited time. The center of the universe indeed!"
5905958,44010303,2015-08-23,11422581,Max,We had a good stay at Rachel's abode. The flat is fairly basic but has all the essentials and is clean and comfortable. The location is superb -- we really enjoyed the close proximity to the lake and many restaurants nearby. Rachel was kind enough to let us use her parking space. We would stay there again.
5905958,44999922,2015-08-30,41871219,Alexander,"This was our first time using Airbnb and we had a wonderful experience. Rachel was very nice and gave us lots of tips on what to do in Seattle. Her apartment was clean and within walking distance of the Fremont Troll, Gas Works Park, Theo Chocolate Factory, and several good restaurants. We had a great time and would highly recommend Rachel's place."
5905958,46029858,2015-09-07,11477410,Rod And Theresa,"Rachel was awesome, making sure to meet us personally and walk us through her apartment.   The place was simple but comfortable, and just exactly as described in the listing.   The location was super convenient, right near the 'Center of the Universe"""
5905958,50360695,2015-10-11,19361410,Kate,"Such a fun neighborhood, Rachel's place was super cute and she left us chocolate from the Theo chocolate factory (out of this world!) and a sweet note, and Rachel was a perfect host. Although she was gone (since we rented out the whole place) she was very communicative and responsive. Loved it!"
5905958,51182153,2015-10-18,34411126,Nina,"Nicely appointed and clean home in a really awesome and super convenient location. Just what we needed for a quick weekend in Seattle. Rachel was always responsive and left clear notes (and chocolate!) so it was easy to settle in. Thanks, Rachel!"
7178239,45861351,2015-09-06,41931522,Chia-Yu,"Here is really a good place to stay~ it's really comfortable and clean !
Sherry is very friendly and nice;)
I love here a lot ;)"
7178239,52882511,2015-11-02,1010034,Rocio,"I loved staying here! Sherry is an amazing host, and the place is very clean and comfortable. She provides everything you could need and is also very happy to help and give recommendations. The house is located close to various bus lines, restaurants, and stores; and it's very easy to get around even without a car. As a female traveling alone, safety is my number one concern, and this listing is incredibly safe. I always felt comfortable coming back alone at night. I highly recommend it! I would stay here again. :) "
6727729,36980640,2015-07-03,15665579,Richard,"Ryan and Taylor were fantastic hosts. After doing a really useful and detailed hand over they were out of the city but were easily contactable and very responsive to our occasional questions. 
Wallingford Manor was perfect for our stay, really nicely done inside and the yard was a fantastic bonus on hot June evenings and weekend mornings. 
There's lot's of stuff in an easy walk, great bakery, plenty of bars, coffee shops and restaurants, plus the downtown bus stops right across the street. You couldn't ask for anything more from a Seattle stay. Book it."
6727729,38303718,2015-07-14,32123162,Leanne,We had a wonderful time - thank you!
6727729,42161320,2015-08-11,763386,Chris,"Ryan and Taylor have got this whole Airbnb thing running really smoothly. They reached out a few days in advance to clarify check-in plans / timing and help us get comfortable. The key system worked flawlessly and they also had all the information that we needed to make sure our stay was smooth and comfortable.

The house itself is beautiful, spacious and really well-decorated. I love Wallingford as a neighborhood, although amenities aren't really within walking distance. It's not a problem, but something to be aware of if you don't have a car or bike. "
6727729,43103255,2015-08-17,4835752,Shana,"Thanks Ryan & Taylor! We had a great stay. Your house is adorable and cozy. We were comfortable and all the special touches made us feel very welcome. Coffee already grinded, a bottle of wine . . . . You were also very responsive to our questions and messages leading up to our stay. We will definitely keep the Wallingford Manor in mind for future trips to Seattle. Thanks again!"
6727729,46333335,2015-09-09,5298494,Thomas,"Ryan and Taylor have a lovely home and it was a nice place to stay while visiting the Seattle area. We stayed for 3 nights and felt the location was perfect for us.  It seemed pretty central and easy to get around from that area.
They were both out of town, but the communication was not an issue as they provided all information needed prior and during our stay. The downstairs bedroom futon could use a little improvement for my taste as I tend to prefer a real mattress. 

Overall the house was comfortable and would recommend their place to anyone looking to visit the Seattle area."
746380,2871947,2012-11-12,1364450,Katherine,"David and his apartment are both AMAZING--he is an absolutely kind and generous host who went above and beyond to make sure our stay was perfect! The apartment itself is even more stunning than the pictures convey--honestly this experience made our weekend in seattle truly unforgettable!! So much so, that we haven't been able to stop raving about the experience to all of our friends and family!"
746380,3033895,2012-12-05,75605,Steve,"David and his place were fantastic for us.    The space was ideal and David was at once accessible and respectful.  At times with Airbnb one overlooks minor annoyances or difficulties because of the good spirit of the host.  With David we had a good spirited host whose environment is nearly faultless for the traveler.  As a professional artist and designer I especially appreciated our stay.

The house, designed by its owner,  is architecturally impeccable and comfortable.  We had a room and full bath to ourselves. Radiant heating (a true plus in Seattle) kept us cozy.  We slept well on the bed and new bed linens. Kitchen is well-appointed.  There is no clutter anywhere, leaving both physical and mental space to guests.  David even provides light breakfast things and thoughtful set of toiletries if you've left something behind.  

On the last leg of a long working trip,  we appreciated the peace and quiet of our stay; it granted me a moment to catch up on some important writing.  When the moment presents, David is also a charming conversationalist.  

Highly recommended."
746380,3099182,2012-12-16,2773399,Jay,David was a awesome host. Great to talk with and what a beautiful home. Room was very comfortable with it's own heating control and quite spacious. The house is just blocks from great restaurants and cafes. A great place to choose when in town.
746380,3313623,2013-01-08,2773399,Jay,Second time I've state with David. He more like a roommate now than a host. It's the best place to stay while in Seattle.
746380,3370967,2013-01-19,932772,Tom,"Super stay - I'm booking my next stay there. Everything is really tip top from the gorgeous view deck to the the big, fluffy towels. You'll find this feels like an extension of your own home. David was there to welcome me at the curb and show me where everything that might be needed was located."
746380,3409266,2013-01-24,4779435,Liz,"I stayed at David's place for two nights while I was in Seattle. The apartment sits above his studio and is very chic and modern. It is minutes away from downtown whether you drive or take public transpo and is located a walks distance from great coffee shops, restaurants and bars in West Seattle. David gave me some great tips on how to get around and what to during my short stay in the city. He was a great host and his apartment is top notch! It made my stay in the area very enjoyable. "
746380,3415754,2013-01-26,2448974,Stephanie,"I can't say enough wonderful things about David and his place.  You won't find a better place or host.  The home is beautiful, quiet and easy to get to downtown.  Thank you David! "
746380,3437568,2013-01-29,2448974,Stephanie,Simply wonderful in so many ways.  David's home is beautiful and peaceful and he makes you feel at home.  
746380,3459962,2013-02-02,2448974,Stephanie,"I just moved to Seattle from Chicago and David helped with anything he could.  He was wonderful and his home is beautiful, clean and very peaceful.  If I didn't have enough room in my new place for any out of town guests, this would be the first place I checked to see if he does.  Thank you for a wonderful welcome to Seattle!  "
746380,3697869,2013-03-05,122255,Tamara,"This room is large and comfy;  the space is located in trendy desirable neighborhood. Close to several grocery stores, convenient to mass transportation, and many restaurants. Schools and park nearby which makes this space very family friendly.  However, not accessible to an individual with mobility impairment. The host was charming and helpful. Great space to have an outdoor event/party! Thank you, David for making me feel welcomed!

746380,3947025,2013-03-30,932772,Tom,"Second stay was just as great as the first one. David is helpful and generous. The house is super clean with everything you'd need. With the weather turning nice, it was so nice to just sit out on the deck and enjoy the view. I'm already planning my next stay."
746380,4007619,2013-04-02,5357214,Amy,"I only stayed a short time at David's place in West Seattle, but it was a very pleasant experience. David was a discreet and warm host. His home is beautiful, and nicely located in an area of Seattle I may not have visited otherwise. 

The room and private bathroom were very clean and comfortable (more comfortable than my own home :) 

Overall, it was a great experience, and I would recommend staying here!"
746380,4106595,2013-04-10,2354134,Gregory,"David has an amazing flat in West Seattle. Despite what little time I spent there, it's ideally located for mass transit travel and located in a great neighborhood, especially to the water taxi downtown. Our schedules didn't match up but David was very informative and responded quickly. Staying at David's places made my trip to Seattle one not to forget."
746380,4166370,2013-04-15,4167637,Eryn,"Really enjoyed our stay at David's place - it's clean, well located, cool and easy. Definitely recommend!! "
746380,4217567,2013-04-19,5863254,Kevin,David is the perfect host and his home is fantastic. Very convenient for downtown. It's the perfect place to stay. 
746380,4257115,2013-04-22,3922084,Olena,"Awesome trip, very welcoming host and great place. Down the street the bakery (opens really early) had outstanding pastries and good coffee! Easy street parking, close to the walk on the shore, downtown of West Seattle, easy to get from the airport. Thank you and definitely would recommend it!
Thanks,
Olena
"
746380,4344878,2013-04-29,5782322,Chris,"David was a great host..easy to talk to and made me feel at home immediately. Such a joy when a host has good pillows on the bed, an extra set of face cloth and towel.Granola and oatmeal was a great addition as well as the fruit bowl that was always full . I wish I had more time to be able to chat .The beautiful house mirrors David's good taste . The room was super clean and comfortable and the house in a great area. A hop and a skip to downtown. i will be back if I have the opportunity!"
746380,4455236,2013-05-06,5868761,Annie,My boyfriend and I stayed at David's for 2 nights and it was perfect!  Very nice area and the bedroom/bathroom were clean and comfortable with all the amenities.  David himself was a very laid back and unobtrusive host.  I would definitely stay here again!!
746380,4769695,2013-05-25,932772,Tom,Yet another ideal stay with David in Seattle! Ideal location near Alki Beach and easy access to Seattle. Ideal host with the right mix of availability and information and privacy. I'll be back.
746380,4843197,2013-05-28,5743144,Kristle,David was an awesome host. The apartment is clean and cozy and in a great location. I would definitely stay here again if I ever come back to Seattle. 
746380,4903679,2013-06-01,5551452,Sophie,"We had a very nice stay in Seattle ; David is very discreet and nice. The appartment is beautiful, very modern and spacious. The room is exactly as depicted, nice and very clean ; there are no blinds though so it's very bright in the morning. There are several cool cafes and restaurants nearby. To go to downtown Seattle we strongly recommend taking the ferry boat - it's much simpler than taking the bus, and you won't get stuck in the traffic jams. "
746380,4957108,2013-06-03,2204900,Peter,"Great host, great location, great apartment! Tip: I walked down to Alki Beach one sunny evening, and passed through Schmitz Park on the way. I finished up this walk with dinner at Blackboard Bistro. Great evening!"
746380,5059644,2013-06-10,6271086,Bryan,David is a wonderful host. His home is beautiful and close to some amazing restaurants and (of course) downtown. He was a non-intrusive host and extremely kind. I would recommend his listing to anyone. 
746380,5150265,2013-06-15,4379190,Win,"It is a very nice place David has. Both the bedroom and bathroom are large, clean, airy and admit a lot of light. There are many restaurants, cafes, shops and bookstores up and down California Ave, all within walking distance. There is a bus stop nearby where 50, 55 and 128 can take you to downtown Seattle (although I think 55 is peak-hour only). But I like to walk down the road for a few minutes and take the faster rapid-ride C line. All in all, it has been a very comfortable and convenient stay at David's."
746380,6732975,2013-08-23,7303405,Jennifer,"Very clean, comfortable, attractive apartment in a really nice neighborhood.  Perfect accommodation for us and our 11 year old daughter.  Also great location for bus routes, and many good restaurants within walking distance.  We loved West Seattle, especially Alki Beach, and riding the water taxi to and from downtown!  "
746380,6997038,2013-09-02,8096547,Bev,David had info to share on our arrival. It is a long walk or $7 via cab to the water taxi which takes u right downtown.  West seattle was a nice area to wander around. 
746380,7095071,2013-09-06,7015371,Annie,"Je n'ai pas eu la chance de voir beaucoup David mais l'appartement est vraiment vraiment beau et confortable. Mieux que sur les photos.  Par contre, si vous voyagez par transport en commun sachez que ce n'est pas tout près du centre ville. Il faut se coordonner avec les horaires ce qui m'a semblé contraignant."
746380,8275335,2013-10-23,7323399,Megan,"David is a very kind and courteous host. His place is an ideal spot to kick up your feet after a day out and about.  It has an cool artsy feel to it as well as always being clean, cozy, and comfortable. Also, it's just a hop/skip/jump on the bus to just about anywhere. It was the perfect place for me until moving on to my next journey. I would most definitely recommend David's hip Seattle pad.                            
Thanks David! "
746380,8554916,2013-11-04,8631668,Jeremy,I contacted David late in the day before my arrival about renting his room. He responded quickly and I was able to reserve which took the stress off of finding a place to stay last minute. David's home is incredible. The pictures don't quite do it justice. The room is large and between the bedding and the heated floors was such a comfortable place to be. David is nice and easy-going. I would definitely recommend his place to others.
746380,8750634,2013-11-16,932772,Tom,"That this is my 4th time staying at David's should say it all. Ideal location, nice place, and great host. I'm already booked for another stay!"
746380,8852468,2013-11-21,8244265,Nicola,"I had an amazing stay here.  Easy check in and the house is gorgeous.  Lovely room, bathroom and really comfy bed! 
Great location with lots of nice local amenities.  Bus stop just outside house so getting to downtown was pretty easy.  
Sadly I didn't get to meet David but he was very prompt at replying to emails and check in process was very smooth.  
Would definitely stay here again on return visit to Seattle! Thanks again! "
746380,9122404,2013-12-08,9472396,Ron,"I LOVED staying at David's beautiful and chic pad!  Heated stone floors! :) It was a beautiful, calming space, with fantastic furnishing and design.  Everything was absolutely SPOTLESS and clean; bathroom, bedroom and kitchen.  I felt comfortable and relaxed here.  David was friendly and available for questions, etc., but also is mindful of a guest's need for space and privacy.  He coordinated my rather late-night  check-in (due to a late arriving flight) and I was able to gain access easily.  I highly recommend staying with David to all Seattle travelers, especially if you are looking to stay in West Seattle; as this quiet, spacious dwelling is located on a main road through West Seattle and is within walking distance to everything. Would definitely stay again! :)"
746380,9318670,2013-12-21,932772,Tom,"After numerous times - great place, ideal location, and thoughtful host."
746380,9802448,2014-01-11,10349175,Ken,"I enjoyed my stay with David and would highly recommend staying with him. He was an excellent host. He has a very high quality top floor flat that is very safe, clean and nicely decorated, just as advertised on the airbnb.com site. My bedroom was large with plenty of closet space. The queen size bed was very comfortable. The bathroom and shower for my use was very clean, up to date and in working order. Quality towels were provided for my use. There was plenty of street parking right in front of Dave's building every evening of my stay. David's free WiFi access worked! 

During my stay, I was leaving for work early and coming home late so I did not get the chance to use the spacious, well equipped kitchen or enjoy the lovely outdoor deck. I did get the opportunity to eat dinner at several of the nearby restaurants. West Seattle really has quality dinning options.

Again, Dave was a terrific host with a high quality space that I would highly recommend."
746380,10041351,2014-01-27,9243145,Kyle,Wonderful accommodations to experience West Seattle in style with a kind host. Perfect location to stroll to many of the restaurants and cool districts in the area. Highly recommended!
746380,10614773,2014-02-28,10110134,Barbara,"This accommodation is conveniently located in West Seattle on California Street approximately midway between the commercial areas surrounding the Admiral Way and the Junction intersections, within walking distance of a huge selection of restaurants, small shops, groceries, and services, yet not in the middle of them.  The bedroom and private bath are very comfortable, within the host's well insulated contemporary and spacious unit - which he designed himself.  A simple granola breakfast, coffee and fruit are provided.  The host is pleasant, accommodating, helpful and considerate.  Highly recommended airbnb location - convenient to bus, beautiful walking environment, very comfortable accommodation."
746380,10761507,2014-03-06,7488141,Reinhold,"We really were happy with our stay. We have family in the area and his home was a perfect place for us to stay. 

The accommodations where clean and comfortable and David made us feel right at home by giving us a tour. He offered the use of his kitchen and space in his refrigerator but since we were on the go from morning till night we never took him up on the offer. "
746380,11278582,2014-03-28,5993666,Rhys,"David was a great host. Very down to earth, helpful and understanding. His place is amazing, and the bed has to be just about the most comfortable one I've ever slept on. He was also kind enough to invite me out to a show! Public transport is fairly easy to navigate, and David was definitely willing to help me figure things out. I also felt like I had a lot of room here in comparison to other places I've stayed. I would definitely recommend this listing!"
746380,11361183,2014-03-31,93237,Noe,"We had a pleasant time at David's place. He greeted us with a friendly attitude and made us feel comfortable while there. His place is very peaceful and although it is located on a main avenue, you can barely hear traffic noise. It was easy to get to downtown Seattle from here as well as connecting to main roads and highways. "
746380,11461278,2014-04-03,13229071,Madeleine,"David was a thoughtful, and kind host.  I wish I could've had some more time to properly visit with him.  His home is lovely, and beautifully put together.  
I am grateful to have rested quite well in the comfortable guest room. 

Thank you David for being such a gracious host!

It was great staying in your beautiful home. :)

"
746380,11588013,2014-04-08,12266830,Amelia,"The apartment was conveniently located near shops, restaurants and some 24hr convenient stores and public transportation. That fact made traveling to downtown Seattle easy and stress free. The room accommodated our travel needs. I would definitely rent again if I am in Seattle! "
746380,11828873,2014-04-16,82723,Ann,"An ideal place to base your Seattle visit. Serene setting, gracious host. David's apartment is convenient to busses, just steps away, and is also a quiet night-time location. Easy parking in front of his home. Soothing bed and sparkling bathroom.
A wonderful deck invites one to slow down and enjoy a restful moment in whimsical blue deck chairs. "
746380,12066326,2014-04-22,4143738,Bob,David's Condo was clean and comfortable. David was a good host. I would not recommend this for older people that have a problem with stairs.
746380,12187996,2014-04-25,10640830,Wayne & Ellen,"David's Apt was just as advertised.
Great location, lots of privacy, and easy to park.
Both of us were very busy, so we did not have much time to connect.
Found out we were both Marylanders.
Yes I recommend.
"
746380,12378594,2014-04-30,14006079,Luc,"David has a beautiful space to share that is conveniently located near the water taxi line. For those who have never been to Seattle, West Seattle is not far from the downtown center and has a stunning view of the city skyline. This apartment is clean, comfortable and run with care. Great morning light in the bedroom on a sunny day. Thanks David for a great stay!"
746380,12463776,2014-05-03,13751067,Jelena,"This was my first time with Airbnb and I would definitely use it again.  David’s home was beautiful and clean.  I was very pleased by the spaciousness of the room and the bathroom was right next door.  The location was perfect for my needs and within walking distance to my sister’s place which was further down on California Avenue.  We didn’t get to interact a whole lot, but he was a great host.  Staying at his home was very pleasant and a contributor to my overall Seattle experience.   "
746380,12758998,2014-05-10,2324410,Yvonne,It was wonderful to spend three days at David's. The house was everything we asked for and more! Thank you for being a great host!
746380,13278042,2014-05-24,14327184,Alexandra,"Davids apartment is beautiful and he is a very friendly host. The room is very spacious and I had a bathroom on my own, what I enjoyed alot. The place is very clean and comfortable. The neighborhood is ok, it was a little bit to far away from downtown for me though. "
746380,13412297,2014-05-27,13509437,Kumiko,We had a very pleasant time at David's. The room is very clean and comfortable! We would definitely ask to stay here again when we visit Seattle. Thank you David for everything:)

746380,14137482,2014-06-12,16404980,Jat,"The apartment is very nice, clean and comfortable.
Good location, easy to go to downtown. There are many shops, restaurants and supermarket in the area. We will ask to stay here if we have a chance visit Seattle again. 

It was our first time with Airbnb and would definitely use it again.
"
746380,14431469,2014-06-19,14518877,Jessica,"We loved staying in David's space in West Seattle! It's in a fabulous location, near PCC Natural Market, several good restaurants and hang-out spots, some great parks for the kids and fun boutique and consignment shops. The space is well-appointed and most importantly, the bed was very comfortable! Had the weather been warmer we'd have spent more time on the large terrace! If you're in the area, consider this spot, it's a real gem in the airbnb world! We'd most certainly stay again!"
746380,15703627,2014-07-14,17040515,Carla,"David was the perfect host.  He made us feel very welcome in his home.  He was quiet, yet available if we had any questions.  We were comfortable and loved the open floor plan and roof deck.  The apartment is as beautiful as it looks in the photographs.  It was a perfect spot to relax when we weren't out enjoying the city and all the area has to offer.  There were a number of great restaurants within walking distance.  I would be so happy to stay there again when I am in the Seattle area."
746380,15933307,2014-07-18,17771038,Leigha,My boyfriend and I stayed for 3 nights and it was a perfect first airbnb experience for us. The apartment was modern and nice and the rooms were very clean. The neighborhood was homey and had lots to walk around to.  We'll definitely use airbnb again after this experience. Thanks David!
746380,16108420,2014-07-22,3312512,Zahara,We had such a wonderful time in Seattle and this place was so perfect for us. Very clean and welcoming. The neighborhood was great and our host so on top of it. He ended up not being there but his sister was and she was awesome too. He was available at all times for us to call when we arrived and he was very timely on all of our questions before we arrived. I couldn't have ask for a better stay and will definitely use this place again when in Seattle.
746380,16353927,2014-07-26,16841919,Matthew,"Whilst David was away, he left some fairly easy instructions on access and transport to the property, which was great. West Seattle is very chilled - I can also recommend the bar with the German food about 10 doors down - very nice! :)
For transport there is a bus stop out the front which takes you to either to Alaska Junction (for rapid bus to the city) or the Light Rail station (for train to the airport). It's about a 30 minute trip to the city, and close to an hour for the airport, however at $2.50 it beats paying for a cab fare!
Bedroom was well set-out, plenty of room and a really nice atmosphere."
746380,16744995,2014-08-01,18605580,Deborah,"We had a pleasant stay in David's home.  David was out of town during our visit, but the house was ready and welcoming for us.  The location was great. Bus stop right there. A pub, cafe, pizza place and grocery store all within walking distance. We ended every day with a stop at the pub. :) We thoroughly enjoyed visiting Seattle and staying at David's. Also his sister was in touch with us to make sure we were okay. "
746380,17017465,2014-08-05,18349704,Shaun,"The pale is outstanding. Very clean, comfortable bed, great location. There was no problems whatsoever with my stay. Highly recommended. "
746380,17185991,2014-08-08,17038381,Catherine,"My friend and I stayed for 3 nights in David's apartment and we are very satisfy. The apartment is beautiful, very luxurious... Even if the place is situated in West Seattle, it is very easy to go downtown by public transport. It is also possible to enjoy the beach in West Seattle. I recommend to walk on the Alki trail on the waterfront up to Seacrest Park to take the Watertaxi. You will have an amazing view of downtown Seattle from the western shore. I highly recommend David's apartement."
746380,17355891,2014-08-11,4557054,Doreen,"We've been at Davids place for 3 Nights. Convenient location for layed back West Seattle atmosphere and great downtown Seattle experience.
David is a relaxed, welcoming and a ready to help providing a spotless clean Apartment. "
746380,17627290,2014-08-15,17693103,Sheri,"David met me outfront helped me with my bags showed me everything I need to know about my living space . Offered me clean linens , a clean shelve in the fridge. Took the time to answer any questions I had . Explained the few guidelines to keep
a peaceful environment in his home. quite between 10-8 am
Yet you have your own freedom to come and go at anytime ..
It was a great experience , one I hope to repeat soon! "
746380,18062263,2014-08-21,8688905,Sarah,David was very communicative regarding my check in. The condo is in a safe residential area with lots of great street parking. Great restaurants are only a quick 10 minutes walk. The bathroom was very clean and I appreciated having extra space in the fridge. 
746380,18420358,2014-08-26,17410691,Chris,"This is a great apartment in a great location.  It suited me as I was visiting relatives in West Seattle and just needed a place to sleep.  The bed was very comfortable, the room spacious with lots of closet space and the bathroom was clean and convenient.  The host was practically never around so there was lots of privacy though I didn't use the living quarters except to have a light breakfast.  David seems like an interesting guy and would have liked to get to know him a bit but our schedules didn't seem to allow that."
746380,18800259,2014-09-01,5921996,Vikki,"Great stay, great price.  This is a good bet if one cannot afford to stay in Central Seattle.  David is a lowkey host and was clear in his instructions for the stay.  "
746380,19277268,2014-09-09,19445365,Amy,"David's place was wonderful.  Contemporary, clean and quiet.  Our brief interaction with David was pleasant.  He was easy to communicate with both prior to our arrival and during our stay.  West Seattle was a perfect location for us.  Eateries and transportation within walking distance.  The bus line runs in front and the water taxi is a nice 20 minute walk.  "
746380,19463730,2014-09-13,7148214,Melissa,We had a very pleasant stay with David. His home is warm and inviting and we had everything we needed. Getting to downtown Seattle was quite easy with the bus routes. The West Seattle neighborhood is also nice to explore in and walk around.
746380,19799563,2014-09-18,21124212,Josephine,"David was a great host very straight forward with everything. The apartment was gorgeous, nice homey feel, comfortable beds and plenty of parking. Downtown Seattle was an easy 15-20 minute drive and staying in West Seattle allowed us to stumble upon a great Seattle skyline view that we probably would not have come across if we'd stayed anywhere else. :)"
746380,21205232,2014-10-13,19813054,Marcus,It was easy to coordinate an arrival time with David and the accommodations are as promised.  The location is excellent for anyone visiting West Seattle.  The neighborhood is suburban and very walkable.  I had a car and was able to find parking without issues.  David keeps a beautiful home and was gracious in sharing his kitchen and even some chocolate cake!
746380,21592413,2014-10-20,20916465,Ron,"David was very welcoming, though we weren't there much.  This is an urban neighborhood -- good and bad:  nice restaurants, coffee shops and pubs within a few blocks, but lots of traffic on the street, so a bit noisy if you are use to quiet at night (we did catch warm nights so we left the window open).  The apartment is very nice and large.  If you are going to West Seattle it is a great choice, unless ""quiet"" is your first priority."
746380,21800023,2014-10-24,22302156,Jodie,"Lovely apartment, and the location is right on the main thoroughfare. Our contact with David was limited, but he was a friendly and accommodating host. The bed was very comfortable, and we loved having fridge space."
746380,22418560,2014-11-05,2773399,Jay,Always a pleasure staying with David. The house is beautiful and perfectly located in West Seattle in walking distance to Shopping and dining. 
746380,22651119,2014-11-11,7488141,Reinhold,This was our second stay with David. The house is very nice and the bedroom is comfortable. David is a great host but as usual we did not spend that much time at the house.
746380,22815172,2014-11-15,7053401,Crystal,"David's home is beautiful, well kept and well designed. Location wise, there are several bus lines that are within walking distance of anywhere from down the street (50, 128) or the C and 56 which are about a 10-15 minute walk. There are plenty of things to check out within walking distance. The room was comfortable, we had three people. Kitchen use was great and David had coffee and cereal available for us to make which was a great way to start our days. 

Ultimately it seemed like everywhere we wanted to go required us to get downtown first, so having so many options to get there made the commutes easy.

David was a great host and I highly recommend him. Everything was easy and up to par!"
746380,23104655,2014-11-23,22627455,Corrin,"David was a very gracious host. I was in town to visit a friend and had to fly in late, then had a delayed plane.  He helped me find the place and get comfortable before retiring for the evening. His place was close to groceries and restaurants. I recommend staying with him."
746380,23266891,2014-11-27,6064897,Kevin,David's home was beautiful and inviting. We had an excellent stay and the location was very convenient for us (with a rental car). 
746380,24271643,2014-12-24,9897404,Steve,"David's place is great. The place is tastefully designed, and the room clean. We have already recommended to several acquaintances in the area. We will definitely come back next time. "
746380,24373735,2014-12-27,23679201,Christine,"This was our first AirBnB experience and it was great. Nice place, good neighborhood. Just as described. David is a friendly and easy-going host. The room was clean and spacious, and the bed was comfortable. The private bathroom was very nice. Street parking and access were easy. Thanks David!"
746380,25725842,2015-01-24,10132034,Ramani,"Being in David's place is like jumping into a page from Dwell magazine.  Downtown Seattle is minutes away by RapidRide bus.  David is mostly busy with work, but he is a very nice person once you get to know him a bit.  Anyone will enjoy their stay here, but it would be ideal for someone who likes architecture, interior design, and green building."
746380,27216692,2015-02-28,27188055,Yin,"The apartment is just like the picture, very pretty.  The location is convenient, especially if you have a car. Lots of grocery stores nearby. Parking on West Seattle is plenty.  Easy drive to Alki beach. Also easy to get to Downtown Seattle, by car or by bus. David is very nice host."
746380,28097074,2015-03-17,9244707,Jessica,"David was a great host. Great room, wonderful building. Clean safe and quiet."
746380,28607409,2015-03-27,27849158,Jordan,"David's space is an interior design dream. Tons of free space and natural lighting punctuated by bookshelves and furniture full of quality books and glassware. Very generous with his stash of oats, fruit, and granola! The three of us shared a room across the space from the router so our wi-fi was pretty unreliable, but otherwise a fantastic experience. "
746380,28834156,2015-03-30,5763919,Gottfried,"David's apartment was amazing! Spacious, clean and cozy. West Seattle is a nice area to stay. To go to downtown you need with public transportation around 25-30min or car 15min. We can highly recommend David as host. We would definitely stay again at his place. "
746380,30295446,2015-04-20,20382934,Linda,"David was welcoming and accommodating.  He encouraged us to make ourselves comfortable, use the living room and kitchen areas, and had space set aside for us in the refrigerator and the cupboard.  The neighborhood was safe, and parking on the street was very easy and quite safe.  The stairway entrance to the south of the building was well lit with motion sensor light, and the exterior and interior lighting was kept on at all times.  The room was spacious and comfortable.  The description of this venue is accurate, but the pictures, while very nice, don't really do it justice.  It is smartly designed and very artful.  I highly recommend this bnb. Thank you, David.  "
746380,30880927,2015-04-28,29961490,Jerry,"David, thank you again. We had a great time staying in home. Your pictures didn't do it justice it was much more beautiful than we could've imagined We rented a car parking on the street was easy to find right in front.David was very accommodating when asked if we could have our granddaughter stay the night. We stayed 5 days and only saw David twice but he did recommend places to see & eat! We would go back tomorrow if we could . It was a great change from North Texas. Will be recommending to friends & family.This was our first time for AIRb&b but definitely will do it again. 5 star trip!!!!!"
746380,46241237,2015-09-08,42918102,Eric,I had a great time and have no complaints. It was a better experience than any hotel I have ever been too. I would highly recommend this listing. 
746380,48873776,2015-09-29,37813294,Marc,"David offers a great place to stay as a base for exploring Seattle. The location provides a pleasant, walkable base, with easy access to coffee shops, restaurants and other daily needs, yet the streets are leafy and quiet and you soon feel at home. At the same time, it's within easyreach of the downtown area. You can take an express bus that puts you in the heart of downtown very quickly, or, as part of the fun, you can take the water taxi. 

The room itself was very clean, the bed comfortable, surroundings quiet and the facilities very convenient. "
746380,49979505,2015-10-08,9760667,Rene,"It was very easy to communicate with David. His instructions were easy to follow and very helpful. His place is beautiful and very clean. The room is exactly as describe. Comfortable bed,  a small desk to work and a window facing the street. 

The bus stop is less than half of block away, and about a mile from the place you will find a couple of coffee shops and many restaurants. Also, to get to downtown from this place is very easy and fast.

I'm probably forgetting to mention everything but I have only good things to say about David and his place.  "
746380,51502531,2015-10-20,31303667,Yiwei,This is my first Airbnb experience and it was great. 10 minutes drive to downtown. Safe and beautiful neighbor. What can not beat this apartment is the extraordinary design and the price I paid for it. I always dream about living in such an apartment which is full of cozy modern design and a feeling of living itself. Thank you David for this outstanding apartment and unbeatable price (very very important for a college student). 
746380,53615432,2015-11-10,45989169,Cathy,"David's place was lovely and he was a kind though very quiet presence when there which wasn't very often.  It was a very easy distance to downtown by car and located on a street with lots of interesting shops and restaurants.  Being on a main street, the traffic was a bit noisy while trying to sleep so if you're sensitive bring earplugs.  The main bed was oddly soft so if you love super soft beds you will love this one, if not, the futon was much firmer.  David has a lovely library and I have some new books on my list to read after having browsed his shelves."
746380,53840565,2015-11-13,2613775,Jason,"Absolutely beautiful luxury apartment in West Seattle. Very clean and tidy in a quiet location. The place was mostly to ourselves as David only works there. Only drawback is location if you are looking for a place to stay to see downtown Seattle. We took Uber into downtown (missed the water taxis), and it cost $15 each way."
746380,54842645,2015-11-25,39355747,Bea,"The listing was clean and beautiful. The bedroom is much more spacious than you can tell from the photos and the bed was more comfy than my own! We did have a problem with the WiFi the first day, but after a few tries, David had it fixed the following day.  Overall it was a wonderful experience! If I had to name 1 thing that needed improvement... it did take a while for David to respond to texts. I had a question about late check in as soon as I booked, I texted and emailed  but didn't hear back until we left a voice mail. We also had a question about where we could put our trash and he didn't respond until the next day, so our takeout boxes stayed with us until then. But issues were very minor.  We would definitely book again for our next visit!"
746380,55522819,2015-12-01,3035622,Kreek'T,"This place is awesome. We had such a short stay in Seattle, but David kept the place warm and cozy for us. Sheets and towels ready, some small breakfast treats, and full use of the amenities. Definitely picking this place again when we come back to Seattle."
746380,55844418,2015-12-06,48484570,John,"David has an incredibly beautiful and modern home. It was very clean and well kept. David was very informative and prompt in answering any questions I had regarding the apartment as well as the area.

There are many restaurants within walking distance of the apartment and David provides a number of recommendations. (Luciano’s and Circa were great). The neighborhood is quiet but the room is facing the street so there is a good bit of traffic noise.

It should be noted that the location is located quite a ways from Downtown. Transportation is limited to taxi, Uber and bus transit. "
4772997,33303967,2015-05-26,32223034,Heather,Ours and their first Airbnb experience was a total success! This space is awesome. The hosts are so friendly and thoughtful! They left us fresh flowers and brought down water carafes! The king bed is so comfy and the bathroom was very clean. We left with (for real) no complaints! 
4772997,33752128,2015-05-31,34313823,Bradley,"My stay was fantastic. I slept like a baby in the quiet confines of my room, and with tastefully ground coffee beans waiting to be brewed when I awoke, my time as a guest always started on the right foot. I was able to peaceully spread out and get much needed work done in their well equiped, downstairs quarters as well.

My hosts made great recommendations when put to the test. I was able to take the Rainier Light Rail to downtown - only 5 minutes drive, and free parking all around the station - to enjoy a Mariners baseball game, and other Seattle city offerings with ease. Further recommendations, led me to Georgetown, a wonderful foodie haven and social hotspot, which became my go to spot for great food during my stay. Think great coffee shops, craft pizza makers, and an undisturbed local culture.

For beer lovers, Georgetown brewing is Seattlites favorite, also 10 minutes away, and taking their tour is a must if time permits (don't belive me? check out the ratings). Overall, a great, well fulfilled, airbnb experience, and much obliged to the hosts efforts. To summarize, Highly Recommended."
4772997,34631736,2015-06-10,15941858,Ebony,"We loved staying here!  We had the privacy of the lower level of this great house with our own bathroom.  The location was optimal as it was just about 15-20 minutes to downtown.  Our host Alisha communicated very well with us and she made it very easy to access the house even when she was gone. While we didn't get to directly meet Alisha on this trip we did get to meet her roommates and they were so accommodating and made us feel very welcomed.  She set out some water and wine glasses for us, and had a personalized sign and real flowers decorating the space.  We would definitely stay here again on our next trip to Seattle!"
4772997,35317583,2015-06-17,33652776,Kali,We absolutely loved staying at Alisha's home! Her and her roommates were all extremely friendly and helpful when it came to suggestions around the city!! This was our first air bnb and will probably be very hard to beat! The space downstairs was very clean and inviting! 
4772997,35585109,2015-06-20,32869395,Erika,"Really appreciated the flexible check-in/check-out time as we got in past 8pm. Neighborhood felt safe, place was quite spacious and lovely as advertised. We were ridiculously comfortable in the king-sized bed! Other house occupants were in and out so we only met them in passing, but they seemed quite nice. Overall, a very nice stay and would be happy to recommend the place to anybody. :)"
4772997,36443312,2015-06-28,35470542,Ellie,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was great! The house was just as described and was exactly like the pictures. It was so nice having the entire lower level especially because it was so spacious! We  felt very welcome when we walked in and saw the personalized chalkboard, and we were kept stocked with fresh towels and pitchers of water. Our hosts were great about any questions we had and gave us some great recommendations about things to do around town. I would most definitely recommend to anyone!"
4772997,38300156,2015-07-14,35824110,Lesa,"The space was exactly as described, very clean and very quiet.  The hosts were very respectful and responsive.  The location was very convenient to the airport, Lake Washington, a lovely Japanese garden, and Georgetown.  Downtown was a short trip.  There were very nice touches such as flowers, wine glasses and bottle opener, coffee pot . . . . We would definitely stay there again."
4772997,40279648,2015-07-29,37577016,Craig,"What a great experience. This was my third Airbnb property and so far it was the best. That is not to say my previous stays weren't good, but this stay had everything I was looking for in a property. I had the entire level to myself. It was very private, quiet and secure. The bathroom was full bathroom and had all the amenities. It was located right outside my bedroom with easy access. My hosts were welcoming, but not intrusive. Unfortunately, I did not get to meet Alisha because of conflicting travel and work schedules. I'm sure she is as pleasant as her friends, and it was my loss. All in all a great place and I hope to be able to stay there again and have the pleasure of meeting Alisha. I highly recommend this property."
4772997,41443564,2015-08-07,38798672,Rachel,"This was a very spacious and beautiful place.  My son and I had a wonderful time and the bed is to DIE for.  It made it incredibly hard to get up in the morning.  Alisha was a great host and very attentive when needed, yet maintained our privacy. "
4772997,42467806,2015-08-13,40128237,Marc,"Very nice, confortable, clean, quite large, beautiful of new house suite. We really enjoyed at 100%. Brandy and Alisha were very kind. Without any hesitation I would make the experience again. Seattle is absolutely great to visit."
4772997,43135445,2015-08-17,12762602,Luis,"The lower level room was exactly what we wanted. Privacy with the door closed or open. Never even heard footsteps upstairs. When we arrived we first noticed how impeccably clean everything was. The decor was inviting and cozy. Nice touch with the map and pins! We slept like babies on one of the most comfortable beds I've had the pleasure of laying on. It was really difficult to roll out of bed in the morning. Easy access to and from Seatac and had no problem summoning a ride share car to the city. Although we didn't meet Alisha, we felt welcome and comfortable in her place. She had everything we needed in the room and more. Would definitely stay here again. Highly recommended. "
4772997,44176866,2015-08-24,39966251,Vanessa,I had a fantastic time staying in Alisha's home. The location was great. It was right on the bus line and in a nice neighborhood. I felt at home and comfortable. The bed and couch feel amazing after a day out on the town and are both huge! Many thanks for a great space and will definitely go again!
4772997,45110503,2015-08-31,19410109,Gokul,Our first airbnb ! What a wonderful experience. I had a welcoming experience and the house was easy to find. Plenty of parking on the street. Walking out of the house you get the beautiful lake view. The room was clean and organized. Bed is very comfortable. 
4772997,45978323,2015-09-07,21986177,Michael,Had a great experience staying here. The room was spacious and quiet. Coffee was also available in the room. 
4772997,47384989,2015-09-18,39169225,Lauren,"My stay was great. Alisha was very responsive to my questions and the space was as shown and described – except it was even larger than I thought it would be. Lots of nice little touches around the space to make you feel welcome. Others have mentioned the bed, and it's true, it was exceptionally comfortable.

As I was arriving, I noticed that there is a nice view of Lake Washington which was a fantastic little bonus and I was able to enjoy by walking down to the Stonehouse Café and enjoying dinner with a view. 

I was able to meet and talk with all four of the hosts during my stay and I'd have to say that the best part of staying was them. Each of them was welcoming and enjoyable to talk to. They all gave great recommendations of things to do and places to go (Smarty Pants was a great sandwich!), which is something that I appreciated greatly being new to the area."
4772997,52108571,2015-10-26,45399857,Simon,"Great first Airbnb experience! Clean, quite and very  helpful."
6884604,37259176,2015-07-05,31992629,Yash,"We liked our stay. Jordan is a good host. The studio is conveniently located within walking distance to a number of bus-stops. The thing that benefited us the most was the flexible check-in and check-out time. We could leave our stuff in the apartment (and hence did not have to carry them along with us) till we left for the airport at 6 PM on the last day of our stay. The house was clean and nice. Wi-Fi was good though not the best, but it did not effect us since we were out for most of the day. A small note- the bathroom only has a shower, not a bathtub, in case it matters. Nevertheless, Jordan did let us know about this beforehand and we were totally fine with it. We would like to stay here again. "
6884604,38556526,2015-07-16,893864,Cara,"Good experience overall- converted almost garage. Comfy and clean, very good host communication. No apparent air conditioning so could be toasty on a hot night and the windows don't open all the way.  I'd stay here again!"
6884604,38931848,2015-07-19,951987,Amanda,Great stay. Lovely space. Would book again.
6884604,39659048,2015-07-25,7960009,Glenn,"This studio cottage was exactly as advertised - and better.   For two people, it was quite roomy, and the full kitchen was most appreciated.  On arrival, everything was spotless.  The location is quiet, the bed was extremely comfortable.

It is in a residential neighbourhood, and is far enough from downtown that we felt our car was necessary - perhaps public transport would have done as well, but we didn't attempt that since we did not know the routes.

We would stay again!"
6884604,40265356,2015-07-29,38615812,Slava,"Both Jordan and the Backyard Studio are the genuine article. Communication was prompt, clear, and sincere. The studio itself is a nice little-big space. It's very well laid out and has a sort of an urban cabin kind of feel to it. Everything I needed was there. Accessibility is great too as it's a close cab or Uber ride to many attractions and downtown. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Jordan!"
6884604,40647589,2015-08-01,24743920,Amber,"Perfect, affordable retreat in a great Seattle location. The weather was unseasonably warm but the accommodations were comfortable and relaxed."
6884604,41122461,2015-08-04,37339397,Matt,"Nice location,  clean place,  good for privacy."
6884604,41498368,2015-08-07,21933343,Yiqing,"This little house is really lovely and it has everything you may need.  Check-in and check-out were both very easy, and Jordan let me leave my baggages at noon before the check-in time which I really appreciate. The environment is really quiet and everything inside is clean and tidy. I would definitely stay at this place next time."
6884604,41987754,2015-08-10,9953931,Aimee,"The house was perfect for our weekend stay. Clean, simple, great setup for a couple. The loft bed made for plenty of space to spread out our luggage. We didn't use the kitchen but it was equipped had we wanted to cook. Quiet residential neighborhood. About a $10 uber or cab to downtown or capital hill. It's a 5 min walk to one coffee shop that was great for the first morning there. Great for runners, it's right next to a high school track or you can run to Madrona park by the waterfront for views of beautiful lake Washington! "
6884604,42463979,2015-08-13,40324645,Nathan,"Good spot--clean and exactly as advertised in the pictures and description. Very responsive/helpful hosts, as well.

Also, if you're looking for a good launching pad for a backpacking/climbing trip, there's plenty of room to spread out your gear and prep.
"
6884604,43098597,2015-08-17,27236715,Ellen,"Jordan and Michelle's home was one of the best experiences I've ever had! The place was beautifully decorated (modern), cozy, and immaculately clean. The location is great and the neighborhood is peaceful. Most importantly, Jordan and Michelle were easy to communicate with. I only got a chance to meet Michelle - she was welcoming, genuine, and sweet! I would highly recommend this place to anyone traveling to Seattle! "
6884604,43464428,2015-08-19,35884521,Zelong,"We booked two nights for staying but left earlier one day prior because of cleaning problem. We found hair (lots of them, not just a few) in both bath towel and bed. And we are extremely uncomfortable about the smell in the room. It smelled like the whole house was just finished few days before we checked in. "
6884604,43966941,2015-08-23,5147575,Katie,"This was the perfect little studio for our trip. We came to visit family and just needed a place to lay our heads. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was nice. We came in August and slept with the windows open and a little fan running. We were nice and cool. Parking was easy.

Our only gripe was when we arrived shortly after check in time the studio had not been cleaned since the last visitors. Jordan took care of it within the hour and it was fine. 

There is a high school across the street so during the day we did hear the football practice and some music. We didn't really mind. "
6884604,44356167,2015-08-25,40113502,David,Studio was nice and clean. Exactly as promised. 
6884604,44667074,2015-08-28,23548610,Rachel,"Jordan was very helpful in leading up to our trip, he sent a lot of helpful tips on sights, food, and drink spots which was great for planning our schedule. 

The space was warm, clean, and perfect for our stay. We didn't use the kitchen (too much seafood to enjoy out there!) but it was well stocked for staying in. It was very cozy and well kept. 

The space was close to many bus stops and was close enough to our areas of interest (Ballard, Downtown etc) to take an Uber for an affordable price. 

A great spot for visiting Seattle for a few days or longer!"
6884604,46606600,2015-09-12,40302771,Will,"This little studio is exactly as described. It's an efficiently designed apartment in a small area, and is the ideal size for one person or a couple. The house was clean and well stocked (I liked the soap/shampoo/conditioner dispensers). The location is ideal as well, just a 10 min bike ride or 20 min walk to most anywhere. Plus the public transportation is great in Seattle which is beneficial. It was nice to have the whole kitchen as well. Actually, it was great to feel more at home than at a hotel, which is a complement to this place as a whole. I'd rented a car during my stay, and had no problems parking on the street whatsoever. While I didn't actually get to meet Jordan, he kept great communication and was extremely helpful. I'd love to stay here again."
6884604,47181666,2015-09-16,41865294,Veronica,"It's looks just as advertised. 
Did the job for a few days. 
"
6884604,47725731,2015-09-21,13068051,Rachel,Great experience.  Studio was as promised and easy to get into.  Jordan offered a lot of great information about the Seattle area.  Wonderful host!
6884604,48800215,2015-09-28,40441253,Madeline,Very quant and cozy place to stay! It was close to downtown but still in a quiet neighborhood. Jordan provided everything that you needed from shampoo to hair dryer to blankets and books to read. Ideas of where to eat or what to see were provided as well. overall very clean and would absolutely recommend! 
6884604,48954896,2015-09-29,9256329,Martina,"Easy communication to organize everything, lots of info Jordan provided via email, easy to acess the place, nice room! We had a very good night of sleep and a good morning at Jordans place."
6884604,49625673,2015-10-05,22689199,David,Good location and host. Very quiet neighbourhood and the space was exactly as described and very clean. Uber taxis were around 8-10 dollars and about ten minutes to all the downtown areas. Would definitely stay here again.
6884604,50545634,2015-10-12,45250469,Sabrina,"The studio is just as advertised - a nice cozy, private spot with its own driveway! The neighbourhood is quiet and easy to navigate. Also located in a convenient part of town making it easy to get downtown and explore other parts of the city.  "
6884604,52028624,2015-10-25,17325952,(email hidden),"We loved our stay in this unique and cozy apartment! Apartment exactly as described and pictured, perfect size for 2 people but definitely a tiny fit.  We did have a little mix up with the initial reservation but our host was quick to communicate with us and get it straightened out. We appreciated the great communication and clean and cozy room!  
"
6884604,53985581,2015-11-15,3959655,Eric And Aoife,"I stayed at Jordan's for a week and loved it. Super cozy, pictures were accurate, great communication. Fully recommend."
1214306,5171933,2013-06-16,1515589,Gord,We had a pleasant stay and found the room very clean and quiet and well appointed. The location is very good and close to downtown.We hope the room is available next time we visit Seattle. Our impression was Summer and Jay take pride in offering a quality accomidations.
1214306,5284461,2013-06-22,1871847,Yang,Summer is very nice to us. She has three cats.We are afraid of cats at first. Then we realized the cats are really quite and shy. Summer works the whole day but are available when we need help.
1214306,5374301,2013-06-26,7038429,Brent,"Amazing location and really nice comfy room with private bathroom. Also, the most adorable cats around!"
1214306,5737977,2013-07-14,155449,Linda,"
Just what a B&B should be!  Good location: near stops on two bus lines, 15 minutes to Downtown, quiet and leafy neighborhood, coffee shop on the same block, grocery store 3 blocks away.  Clean.  Super walk-in closet.  Great bathroom and shower.  Friendly hosts.  Excellent views from the roof.  Big kitchen.  The door keypad even uses your suggested combination.  We will stay here again, for sure!  "
1214306,5918424,2013-07-22,6918056,Helen,"Summer and Jay were great hosts to my girlfriend Rita and me.  Their home is lovely and has an added feature of a rooftop patio to enjoy the Seattle view.  Our room was very private with its own bathroom w/shower (very convenient!) and walk-in closet (no need to bring hangars-Summer provides plenty).  As there is only one bed, I brought my twin-sized air mattress and there was plenty of room for it.

There is street parking (one of the only places we DIDN’T have to pay for parking in Seattle-factor parking fees into your budget); but it can be tight—so, if you’re not used to it—practice your parallel parking before coming (Rita was a pro!).  One thing to note about the home if you have mobility issues, it has several levels and the entrance, your bedroom, and kitchen are all on different levels.  No problem really, even if your fitness level is zero (like mine is).  Also, if you are allergy free, don’t be put off by the cats; they are the best behaved cats I have ever experienced; very quiet-no thumping around in the dead of night-and the house was cat-hair and cat-odor free (don’t know how Summer does it).

There is a neighborhood coffee shop with Wi-Fi (the home has Wi-Fi, too) a few doors down and it’s a nice place for a cup of coffee and breakfast if you like breakfast sandwiches (no plates of eggs, potatoes, & bacon).  It was great to have kitchen privileges; saved $$ on not having to eat out each meal but don’t go overboard with too much that needs refrigeration (Trader Joe's is about 2.5 blocks away-free parking garage!).

I would stay here again and feel completely at home.  Summer and Jay are very friendly and hospitable.
Helen from Bend"
1214306,6015720,2013-07-26,7599968,Lennard,It was a great stay everything was clean and nice! We can just recommend to stay there :)
1214306,6080176,2013-07-29,1004039,Ainav,"Summer was an awesome host! She sent us all the information we needed far in advance and everything went smoothly. The room is perfect, private and cosy and really well located. We walked all over seattle and there are tons of public transportation options too. A great area to be in!"
1214306,6163760,2013-08-01,2357643,Nanine,It's a fine space as described in a great central neighborhood. I didn't see much of my host during my two night visit. My only recommendation is that if you have a need for quiet you should make that clear in your request for accommodations. It's a good value for your money. 
1214306,6202838,2013-08-03,6244983,Cayce & David,Summer was excellent in communicating prior to arriving and bedroom was clean and very comfortable. Highly recommended!!! 
1214306,6462763,2013-08-13,7230926,Ryan,Everything was as good as could be. The cats were friendly and were not a bother at all. The room was nice and clean. Bathroom was the same. Can't complain at all. Summer and Jay were both nice. Summer suggested some restaurants for me to check out when we talked. I was out late most nights and it was not a bother to either of them. Would definitely stay with them again without hesitation.
1214306,6657148,2013-08-20,6932030,Nathan,"Summer and Jay were very accommodating and welcoming! We even accidentally overstayed our welcome by a tiny bit and it was not a problem at all. Their cats are very friendly, the house is in a great location, and the rooftop patio is awesome!"
1214306,6736195,2013-08-23,1458345,Stephanie,Summer's house is in a great location and the room and attached bathroom were very clean and comfortable.
1214306,6852967,2013-08-27,2959369,Antonio,"The house is just behind downtown.20 minutes (website hidden) is clean with 3 adorable (email hidden)mmer helped and adviced me for everything i needed.
great place to stay.recommended.

"
1214306,6900607,2013-08-29,521183,Tamara,"Place is nice and very clean, close to the bus stop, and walking distance to a lot of bars and restaurants. I (Dev) was there for a short conference and it was very well positioned for this. Summer provided prompt communication prior to my arrival. We were able to have some privacy from each other during my stay. No breakfast provided but places near by have this facility. I'd recommend staying here.  Cats were very nice and well behaved."
1214306,7016172,2013-09-03,7782212,Stephan,"Everything was very good: clean, comfortable and cozy. Summer is a very good host, and we enjoyed our time in Seattle a lot."
1214306,7168053,2013-09-09,622572,Christina,"My boyfriend and I had a great time in Seattle and Summer's place had a lot to do with it. The house is comfortable, clean and inviting. Summer and Jay were gracious hosts; making it easy to find the house and gain access to our room. The best part of their place though is the location. Located less than 10 minutes walking distance from the center of Capital Hill; their place gives you easy access to a hip neighborhood with all the good eats and happening bars you could ask for. I have to also mention the attached bathroom that gives you privacy that you just won't get staying elsewhere. If your going to Seattle and want a classy and affordable home base that will show you what it's like to live in Sea-town this is the place for you. "
1214306,7296455,2013-09-14,8757777,Kirsten,"Great host! The room was also very nice, private, clean and had it's own bathroom and walkin closet. The location was also fantastic! Looking forward to staying here again when I am in Seattle. 
"
1214306,7372564,2013-09-17,3107639,Andy,"Summer's place is conveniently located close to Downtown, and is situated in a neighborhood with great selection of coffee shops and restaurants. The bedroom was clean and comfortable, and the en-suite bathroom included a walk-in closet. I didn't get a chance to meet Summer, but had a wonderful time staying there. A highly recommended location to stay at for anyone visiting the Emerald City!"
1214306,7557242,2013-09-24,7707264,Cynthia,"Enjoyed my stay with Summer. Her house is clean, conveniently located, and is home to 3 fun kitties. The house is in a quiet neighborhood that is only 15 minutes from downtown via either of the  nearby bus lines. Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to meet Summer, but hope to meet her next time as I would definitely stay there again. "
1214306,7699558,2013-09-30,567068,Julia,We really enjoyed our stay at summer's place. It is easy to reach and within walking distance to the center. As it was raining a lot we spent quite some time in our room which was cosy and comfy. Summer and her boyfriend were super friendly and made us feel at home. We would definitely stay there again!
1214306,7943991,2013-10-09,8268207,Heidi,Nice room with private bathroom.  Very comfortable bed and a fabulous rooftop with a view.  Summer was a gracious host and her cats are awesome.  The only downside was that the house is not well soundproofed if you are a light sleeper.  In general I would definitely recommend staying there -easy downhill walk to downtown.
1214306,8034484,2013-10-13,9315022,Vil,Summer and Jay were amazing hosts. Their cats were very entertaining and made me smile after a long day out and about Seattle. They are very accommodating and thoughtful couple. I mentioned having a sprained ankle and they let me used an ice pack they had. I watched a really good movie with them and visited for a bit. The room was just like the pictures and the bed was really comfortable. Should I ever return to Seattle I would surely try to reserve with them again. BTW...the bus stop is a short block away into Downtown.  
1214306,8612182,2013-11-08,5848685,Margot,"Far exceeded expectations!  Spotlessly clean, VERY nice to have private bathroom.  Great location a short walk away from Capitol Hill's bars/restaurants.  Great hosts, friendly cats too!"
1214306,9031929,2013-12-02,1462496,Gwyn,Summer's place is the perfect spot to take in all the sights and sounds of Seattle. It's only a short taxi or bus trip from the main station and Capitol Hill was one of our favourite places to enjoy excellent shopping and dining. The three cats are super friendly and we'll miss them all!
1214306,9217561,2013-12-14,2504294,Vanessia,"Summer was great! Her apt was very centrally located near cafes and restaurants in Capitol Hill, the room was immaculate, and we were humored by her adorable cats! Her pre-trip instructions were clear and she was very nice and communicative throughout.  Highly recommend!"
1214306,9765111,2014-01-08,5160549,Lucas,"Summer's place was great.  I stayed there for the first days when I moved to Seattle.  The room is very comfortable, and the private bath great (rare in Seattle).  The location is good - easy to get to via bus.  Summer was out of town for a majority of my stay but I felt very comfortable.  And her cats were great - Caz had a huge crush on me and was waiting for me everyday.  Such a great cuddler."
1214306,10605212,2014-02-27,4302530,Andrew,"Great value, good location, friendly kitties.  Also great that the room comes with a private bathroom.  Hosts are very accommodating."
1214306,10982915,2014-03-16,11435917,Tom,Staying in Summer's room in Seattle was one of the nicest accommodations I had ever stayed in. It's like a hotel but you have a great household to match. Her cats are friendly and don't get up in your grill. Would definitely stay there again!
1214306,11284717,2014-03-28,12337779,Daniel,"Summer and Jay were the phenomenal hosts as they are extremely friendly and resourceful. Upon arrival, the room and bathroom were immaculate. The apartment is very close to a bus stop and to great restaurants/bars. I will definitely stay there again and I strongly recommend anyone that visits Seattle to stay there!"
1214306,11441613,2014-04-02,5864188,Marissa & Nestor,"Had a lovely room very private, and Summer and Jay were incredibly accommodating and nice. You will love the three cats! They are super affectionate, and very well mannered. Great area,close to everything (especially Trader Joes), and you can even walk to downtown in 15-20 mins! "
1214306,11499960,2014-04-05,12161590,Diane,"I enjoyed my stay at Summer's place.  The room, bathroom and shared facilities were very clean and comfortable.  Although Summer and I never actually saw each other, she was very accommodating via text messaging.  I would definitely recommend this room/place. 
"
1214306,11617738,2014-04-09,8594655,Elaine,Our stay at Summer's place was great. The room was very nice and the rooftop deck is amazing. We really enjoyed ourselves!
1214306,12402757,2014-05-01,9009347,Benjamin,Summer's place was excellently described in her listing. The place is very clean and comfortable and the roof deck is awesome. It is very easy to keep to yourself and have some privacy or hang out in the living room and have a chat. I travel to Seattle frequently and hope to find the room available again the next time I go.
1214306,12635170,2014-05-06,14545620,James,Decided to attend Cascadia Poetry Festival in Seattle on short notice.  Found this room a five minute walk from the festival HQ 3 blocks away.  A great trip all around.
1214306,12728991,2014-05-09,13496928,Jodea,"The perfect AirBnB experience: beautiful house, friendly hosts and great location. I could happily live in their neighbourhood and easily not need to venture downtown, other than to visit the fabulous Pike Place Market, of course. 

With great bars, restaurants and coffee shops nearby and a Trader Joe's and local organic co-op store around the corner, you have everything you need on the doorstep. Our room was very spacious with a great garden view of the squirrels. And the three cats are just so cute! Our only regret is that we didn't stay longer. And our hosts gave us a great tip for a local bar with 50 beers on tap called Chuck's Hop Shop. "
1214306,12933163,2014-05-14,14877588,Gerard,"Summer was a great host, even she sent me all the info in advance and also the directions from the airport.
The room was awesome, better than a hotel, and really well-located.
In one word: perfect."
1214306,13010962,2014-05-17,1716772,Tristan/Robert,"Excellent, all around. The room was super clean and comfortable. Briefly met Summer and Jay, who were both really nice and welcoming. This was easily one of the best Airbnb's I've stayed in so far, and I would definitely stay here again. -Robert"
1214306,13309456,2014-05-25,13615872,Kira,"Simply put, no matter how much money you spend you'll never find a cleaner, more comfortable, quieter, more welcoming or well located hotel equivalent to Summer's home. 
Also lovely cats.   
11/10 will stay again. "
1214306,14233394,2014-06-15,9710403,Kon,"Summer's place is clean, comfortable and lots of privacy with a private bath. The location is convenient to check out Seattle. We didn't get to meet Summer but her pre-arrival instructions were clear. Definitely recommend the place to anyone visitting Seattle."
1214306,14400303,2014-06-18,5384756,Stephanie,"We had a great stay at Summer's house! The room was clean and cozy, check-in and check-out were very easy, and the cats were very sweet. The location is great, within walking distance of lots of shops, restaurants and bars; and there's a good coffee bar just down the street. Summer was very fast and easy in communicating, but we were out a lot so unfortunately I didn't get to meet her in person.
I definitely recommend this to anyone who visits Seattle!"
1214306,14911366,2014-06-29,665330,Hong,"Summer is a great host, very helpful if there is a problem throughout the time. I loved my stay there. The place was private, clean and not far from city and I walked everyday. Enjoyed it!!! Definitely will stay there again if there is chance and would recommend it to anyone to Seattle!"
1214306,15197927,2014-07-04,6845753,Takeshi,Summer is accommodating and friendly host. The room is clean and comfortable. And the location is convenient. There are many good cafe and restaurants in the neighborhood. I enjoyed my stay in Seattle.
1214306,15405243,2014-07-08,15959434,Alexander,"We didn't get to meet Summer because she was out enjoying the Northwest's awesome outdoors, but the accommodations were really great. We had a comfortable bed with a private bathroom well-stocked with anything we might have needed. A friend of hers who was house-sitting the property was very fun and helped us have a good time while in Seattle. The location is very convenient to plenty of things to do in the Capitol Hill part of town and public transport isn't hard to find from there, either. Also, if you like coffee, a shop called Tougo is just steps away and does a really awesome job with their Chemex (pour-over) coffee. We wouldn't hesitate to stay at Summer's home again if we travel through Seattle in the future."
1214306,15549179,2014-07-11,7099154,Dustin,Summer's place was awesome! She gave us well-detailed instructions on check-in and the room was just as described. I was initially worried about the cats but they ended up being the favorite things about the place. They are the most well-behaved cats I have ever met. 
1214306,15661820,2014-07-13,7615800,Umut,Summer has a great and clean room. It was very close to downtown. We were very busy but next time hopefully hang out with her. Thanks. 
1214306,16204981,2014-07-23,15739744,Desaree,Summer was a great hostess. She made me and my husband feel welcomed and comfortable. The room was clean and cozy. She kept it well-stocked with anything we could ever need. It was like a mini-hotel room! The place was conveniently located near several neat restaurants and bars. The location made it easy to walk around without relying on public transportation. I would definitely stay here again for my next visit!
1214306,16453178,2014-07-28,13459101,Laurie And Dave,"Staying here was a great experience, we were a bit apprehensive as this was our first time using air bnb and visiting Seattle!  But it was all great.  Summer's house is private, clean and in a great area close to downtown.  While we did not meet Summer in person, she was available through text and email.  Check in was smooth.  All three cats in the house are really nice cats.  "
1214306,16678352,2014-07-31,5903545,Fabian,Nice room with private bathroom in a quiet neighborhood only a 20 minutes busride to downtown. The rooftop deck is a perfect spot for breakfast with a great view.
1214306,16763531,2014-08-02,13323489,Nancy,"Stayed for 2 nights. Arrived really late from the airport the first night and luckily access to the house that late wasn't an issue which was a big plus for me.  Easy to find, good places nearby for breakfast, short walk to the local bus stop to go downtown to see the sights.  Got to chat with Summer in the evenings, get to know her cats and relax some on her roof deck.  No A/C but there is a fan in the room, comfortable bed and clean bathroom.  Would stay there again.  Thanks Summer for your hospitality!"
1214306,16905201,2014-08-04,17004706,Maddy,"We had a great time staying in Summer's place in this excellent neighbourhood! We came to Seattle without much of an agenda other than to see a show at the Paramount on Saturday night. We soon realized we wouldn't have to go far to find some great spots! Summer gave us some great tips on streets to explore in the neighbourhood and it did not disappoint. Lots of great restaurants, brunch spots, pubs (Elysian Brewery anyone?). We walked everywhere we went including to Pike Place Market and even as far as the aquarium on the pier. Also the room is great, quiet and on a cool side of the house, the bed is very comfy. The kitties in the house are very friendly but also very quiet, no meowing was heard the entire time. Thanks for the awesome stay Summer!"
1214306,17165050,2014-08-08,18012330,Gerald,We had a very good experience at Summer's place.  Great safe location and clean.  We would definitely return.
1214306,17350838,2014-08-11,16567899,Zack,Beautiful home with friendly hosts.  They ended up taking off for the weekend but we were lucky enough to catch them before they left to get a run down of the property and the area.  They have three amazing cats but they keep the house and particularly the guest room/bathroom exceptionally clean.  Summer's instructions were perfect and the whole process was very smooth and stress free.  We have no qualms about staying here the next time we're in the area and would happily recommend this place to our closest friends/family.  Thanks for contributing to what turned out to be an amazing trip!
1214306,17839721,2014-08-18,11029005,April,Such an amazing location! Very clean room with a comfy bed! Adorable well behaved kitty's! If you want to play with them they will love you but if not they stay out of your way. Summer and Jay were awesome. Had some drinks on their rooftop before going out one night. Thanks guys! :) 
1214306,18035324,2014-08-20,19860668,Felipe,"We stayed here for two nights and it was a great experience for us! The place's location was simply amazing. The place itself was also great, the room and bathroom were very very clean, the decoration was nice, and it was very comfy. We totally recommend it! "
1214306,18170528,2014-08-23,11056330,Ralph,"First of all, we had a perfect stay at Summers apartment. It was absolutely clean and everything we need was around. We had a lot of privacy in our room and its bathroom. We felt almost like home, could use the kitchen, loundry, rooftop etc. Summer was extremely nice and helpful, gave us really good instructions bevor arriving. We definitely recommend this place. "
1214306,18528878,2014-08-28,11982464,Elise,"The place was super nice and very clean! The neighborhood was also great- within walking distance to downtown and served by a bunch of bus lines for when we didn't feel like walking. Summer was also great about providing us a bunch of info a week before our stay, which helped us plan our itinerary in advance."
1214306,18942267,2014-09-03,17376949,Andres,"Summer was a wonderful host that was always kind and fun. She had great advice for things to do in the city, and she provided insight to things I was interested in.  The room was luxurious and the bathroom was amazing. She has the most adorable and active cats that were very friendly. If I come back to Seattle, I would definitely stay with her again.  She made my Seattle trip even better than I hoped.   "
1214306,19081108,2014-09-06,19122963,Erick,Really nice home in a great neighborhood. I liked the key pad to enter the door rather than having to worry about if i lost the keys. Flexible with my arrival time lots of great places close by. Bathroom had everything you needed even Q-tips! I would definitely book this place again.
1214306,20147319,2014-09-24,19993405,Elli,"I stayed for 2 weeks as a tourist and also a mother of freshman of UW(University of Washington). I could go to downtown easily by the bus No. 2 (within 10 minutes to the center of the city). Summer was a sweet person, and her house was very clean. A good and popular coffee shop is almost at the next door, where I could have breakfast.  I also loved three very lovely cats. How affable and adorable they are ! I miss them a lot."
1214306,20414780,2014-09-29,11001235,Timothy,"Yes!! Summer's place is amazing. It's gorgeous, and she's a fantastic host. I highly recommend her place. It's walking distance from everything you need. I loved the cats! Some of them napped with us, we felt so welcomed! I even walked from Pike's Fish Market to Summer's house and it only took about 30 minutes. I would definitely stay here again."
1214306,20759523,2014-10-05,20882939,HyeJin,"House is also very clean and nice surroundings too good. I was able to stay entertained while traveling to Seattle, friendly and convenient to transportation! Thank you, Summer ^ ^"
1214306,21017317,2014-10-09,19831289,Ben,"We both really enjoyed staying here in Seattle. Summer and Jay were great hosts, the room was clean, tidy and very comfortable. We fell in love with the cats too. Good location for exploring the city and downtown with some great food nearby. Definitely recommended to others.
"
1214306,21356309,2014-10-15,21942321,Rasit Onur,"Everything was great about the host and the room. We loved the cats as well! The location was perfect, there is a really good, hip coffee shop on the same street and several good restaurants in 4 block radius. "
1214306,21683991,2014-10-21,22347245,Natalie,"This place was in a great location.  It gave us the opportunity to explore the city and the neighborhoods as we walked to downtown.  The room was perfect and had everything we needed.  It was also very convenient that they had keyless entry to the house.  We met Summer when we first arrived but was out and about the rest of the trip that didn't see them anytime after that.  They were nice enough to invite us to join the party they were having, but we were so beat from walking around so much we just slept through it.  They were also kind enough to let us check in a little early and a checkout a little later.  All in all, a great place to stay!"
1214306,22037330,2014-10-28,21103580,Matt,My stay with Summer was great. I was in and out at odd hours (and working) so I didn't have much of a chance to visit with the hosts. The room was great and the attached private bathroom was also a huge plus. The cats were very friendly. The neighborhood had a great coffee shop and diner within walking distance and I found consistent parking for my rental car just 1 block away.
1214306,22333017,2014-11-03,5355473,Jake,Great place to stay. Awesome location. Spacious and clean room! Would definitely stay again. 
1214306,22680045,2014-11-11,6846104,Brian,"Summer was a fantastic host. Very accommodating and clear communication on check in, house rules, etc. The room was very clean and fully stocked with everything you'd need. Her and Jay were very hospitable and gave great tips on places to go and how to get around town. Their place is perfectly walking distance to lots of good restaurants/bars/nightlife in Capitol Hill, and their cats are very friendly. I would absolutely stay here again."
1214306,23335867,2014-11-29,19174723,Ed,"Summer provided us with a relaxing place to stay. They welcomed us into their home and were very gracious. Clean, convienient and friendly. We enjoyed our stay. "
1214306,24609367,2014-12-31,12498970,Katharina,"Schöne Airbnb Wohnung! Sauber,  gute Lage und super süße Katzen! Durch das Code System sehr einfach ins Haus zu kommen ohne sich über den Schlüssel Gedanken zu machen. Thank you Summer!"
1214306,24897042,2015-01-03,1492380,Adam,"Definitely the best experience I have had in Airbnb so far. Very clean room, hotel quality, with good space + closet and bathroom ensuite. Super easy to get into the apartment using the pass code lock. Beautiful apartment with adorable cats. Very accessible via public transit, and walkable to Capitol Hill and (with a little more time) downtown. Summer was super nice and we enjoyed staying at the apartment immensely."
1214306,25560774,2015-01-19,24486349,Rachel,"My friend and I chose to stay here because the neighborhood looked nice and it was in close proximity to The Paramount - we had tickets that weekend for a two night concert series. Everything about our stay was terrific - the room was a great size and very comfortable and clean. Extra towels, blankets, pillows and little toiletries were provided - a nice touch! The wifi was fast. The house itself was cozy and welcoming. The layout is really cool and the rooms are away from the common areas, so the rooms feel extra private and quiet. The neighborhood is lovely, too - and the view from their roof provides really attractive views! Summer was an ideal host - helpful, hospitable, and fun to chat with. I'd definitely stay here again!"
1214306,25958485,2015-01-31,21050338,Elicia,"Summer is a great host. The room was immaculate, the bed comfortable, and there was plenty of space for two. The bathroom was well stocked and beautifully clean. The location was unbeatable. "
1214306,26611847,2015-02-16,4661769,Mila,"In LOVE with her cats! My boyfriend and I spent Valentines Weekend with Summer and her husband. Summer's place was great. Happy to have had my first Airbnb experience at this location. Easy to find my way around the neighborhood. Super comfy bed! Perfect level of involvement: Summer was around to greet us, for us to ask questions and to have friendly conversations, yet we were still able to do our own thing and maintain a comfortable level of privacy. Plus the keyless entry pad made me not have to worry about losing any keys, so that was great too. Thanks so much Summer and Jay!!"
1214306,28105223,2015-03-17,21261382,Ron,The room was just as described and my stay was most enjoyable. And...what a great location!
1214306,28915735,2015-03-31,22379559,Cole,"Summer and Jay are awesome hosts. They are both friendly, available and have great tips about the surrounding neighborhood and Seattle. The room as well as their home is wonderfully sunny, super clean and very quiet (much appreciated by a weary traveler) and they also have three lovely cats. Their home is also conveniently located: there are great coffee shops nearby, tons of restaurants/bars in nearby Capitol Hill, and downtown is walkable. I highly recommend staying with Summer and Jay!  "
1214306,29767033,2015-04-12,29759655,Jeffrey,"Summer and Jay were friendly hosts who seem to take the approach of giving visitors privacy unless approached in conversation.  It was easy to get in and out of the house using a simple keypad.  The cats were well behaved and had plenty of toys and scratch pads to play with. The room and bed were clean, with the expected cat hair here and there, and comfortable with a walk in closet.  Beware, the shower handle is sensitive transitioning from hot to cold and will suddenly change and take some time to return to normal after a faucet, toilet, another shower, or laundry cycle is used.  Also, the water pressure is a bit below normal, likely due to being on top of a hill.
The view from the townhouse style standalone house on the ridge of Capitol Hill is nice and is very easy to point out from nearly all of Seattle using landmarks, so you can never be lost.  The house is just above many tasty locations such as an international street cuisine restaurant Nue, a rare cider bar Capitol Hill, a retro style arcade, and a brewery, with further walks to Starbucks Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room and Paramount Theatre.  Trader Joes and Central Cinema serving alcohol and food during classic movies also provide a local environment.  There is also a bike share stand nearby.  "
1214306,30451149,2015-04-22,4341493,Sylvia,"Staying at Summer and Jay's home made our Seattle trip so easy and comfortable. The room was very clean and well-stashed with clean towels, shower supplies, clothes-hangers, pillows, reading materials...  The walk-in wardrobe was definitely a plus. We were also able to dine on the rooftop, which was a lovely experience.

The neighborhood was also well-situated. Within walking distance, we had access to coffee shops, restaurants, bars, grocery stores, parks, public transit, and even a bike-share station. 

P.S. The cats are very friendly and sweet, too."
1214306,30839879,2015-04-27,23634405,Nathan,"Clean and comfortable, an effortless stay.  Thanks!"
1214306,31905691,2015-05-11,30113122,Jimi,"Great home, great location.  Summer was a very relaxed host, which made everything easy.  The cats are super sweet!"
1214306,32229890,2015-05-16,155449,Linda,"This was our second stay with Summer and Jay. They were not at home this time but everything was ready for us. The home is well kept and very clean. The neighborhood is still quiet, with a lot of trees. Access to public transportation couldn't be easier and a coffee shop is almost next door. We will be happy to stay here again."
1214306,33229650,2015-05-26,3099136,Siri,"Staying at Summer's house was my favorite Airbnb experience so far. The room was perfect and the location was exactly what I needed. Very handy with the code lock (after I figured it out - which was all on me)! Also, the cat was super friendly. Would stay there again for sure. Thank you!"
1214306,33808820,2015-06-01,31630620,Puma,"Great host, and the cats are so cute! The room is super clean, and they really respect our privacy. It's not difficult to find a parking spot, great neighborhood. and I love the keypad---don't need to bring the key with you!"
1214306,34295907,2015-06-07,31040527,Betsy,"So glad we stayed here! Summer's home is centrally located, quiet, and the neighborhood is easily navigable. There are restaurants and grocery stores near by. Summer greeted us right away, and she is very warm, friendly, welcoming, and helpful. The cats are delightful. :) Definitely recommended!"
1214306,36003788,2015-06-24,29188542,Autumn,"This room was a perfect first-time Airbnb experience for us! Awesome location close to Cap Hill night life, but far enough away to be quiet and peaceful in the evenings! Walking distance from groceries, coffee, and other essentials. And the key-less entry was amazing! Made check in / check out a breeze, which was great for our late/early flights. The room was clean and spacious and the bathroom was fully stocked with towels/toiletries. Tons of walk-in closet room, too!

Summer was great! Super helpful and always available for help if we needed it.

Bonus: The cats are adorable and very friendly! :)"
1214306,36584085,2015-06-29,7803631,Heather,"One of my friends and I stayed at Summer's for a few days as part of a trip through the Pacific Northwest.   We got in a little early on our check-in date, but the room was ready to go and in immaculate condition when we arrived.  We had a great stay and Summer was very helpful and accessible, even provided us with some beach towels and beach bags as we made our way out to enjoy some sun and water!  Was a very walkable area and also just down the street from a bus line that we took a few times during our stay.  Would highly recommend!"
1214306,37987929,2015-07-12,29662970,Neil & Annette,"Excellent, really nice home, well organised and a great host. Lovely cats who greeted us upon arrival. Nice position with some great eating places nearby. You won't be disappointed here. Top class. "
1214306,39428160,2015-07-23,37677780,Kevin,"I loved every bit of this experience, and it was my first booking which made that all the better. The room was spacious and comfortable, with its own adjoined bathroom.  The neighborhood was as I like it: away from the busy commercial area but also a few blocks away for easy access.  Summer was very nice, and I barely saw her and Jay.  The cats did a great job of making me feel at home.  I highly recommend this home for Airbnb'ers, and would definitely stay here again."
1214306,40105469,2015-07-28,34686416,Jennifer,We stayed with Summer for the weekend while we attended the Capitol Hill Block Party a few blocks away. The location was perfect and so much more reasonable than a hotel! Summer's cats were adorable and friendly. The room was clean and well-decorated. Would definitely stay here again! Thanks Summer. 
1214306,40882345,2015-08-03,19438084,Anne,"We spent 4 nights at Summer's. Her place is in a great location from where we visited the city. The room was clean, comfortable and convenient with its big closet. The place is really quiet, perfect for the night."
1214306,41364236,2015-08-07,34404360,Christina,"We were greeted by Summer's husband, Jay, who showed us how the keypad worked as well as offered to give us tips on where to go in the neighborhood. The three cats were also very sweet & friendly and visited with us daily. The rooftop view was amazing and the neighborhood was perfect for us. We had a rental car so drove into the downtown area a few times, but we also used the bus which was right on the corner and only took about 25 minutes. We used an uber service one night which cost about $8. There are many eating & drinking establishments within a 5-10 minute walk of the house. Summer recommended a great place to try different beers and it was a short walk away. Our hosts were very nice and the room was extremely clean and the bed comfortable. Private bath was perfectly clean & included soap as well as shampoo/conditioner and plenty of fresh towels for our use. I definitely recommend staying here. Summer provides great information & makes you feel welcome. It was a pleasure."
1214306,42536122,2015-08-14,21750410,Sharmodeep,"We had a nice stay at Summer and Jay's home in Seattle. The house is situated in a quite residential part of Capitol Hill. It is about 10-15 minutes walk from downtown area. There are nearby cafe and shops, like Trader Joe's. Our room was situated in the first floor. The room is as described with an attached bathroom and walk-in closet. One can get nice view of the downtown and mountains from the roof of the house. Summer and Jay were very gracious and made us welcome at their place. We would absolutely recommend staying at their house in Seattle."
1214306,43254123,2015-08-18,37724558,Patricia,I really appreciated Summer's prompt responses to my email inquiries. Her information was helpful and timely.
1214306,44327234,2015-08-25,15093414,Tony,"Really great place to stay. Everything was extremely clean, nice, and comfortable. The location is perfect,  a quick walk to the best restaurants and bars. The cats are really cute too."
1214306,46367120,2015-09-10,5716482,Genevieve,"Nous n'avons pas rencontré Summer et son conjoint, mais ils demeurent dans une magnifique maison avec leurs trois chats. La chambre est spacieuse, le lit est extrêmement confortable, et la localisation de la résidence est super. Durant nos cinq jours là-bas, nous avons tout fait à pied pratiquement, puis revenions le soir (les côtes de Seattle!) en autobus.

Nous recommandons sans hésiter cette chambre...et cette ville magnifique!"
4454121,22514137,2014-11-08,23352555,Glenn,"The treehouse is amazing. The location is awesome and it's worth staying out if you're in town for only a day or for a couple days. With the outside deck that's really nice way to spend a day whether it's sunny or rainy so it's good year round. A wonderful, responsive host. I definitely would recommend it!"
4454121,22717972,2014-11-12,8294172,Catherine,We stayed here for a long weekend and really enjoyed it. The house is beautiful and spacious for four-five people. The location is quite unique and you get a warm feeling being surrounded by trees and nature. Sven was very welcoming and responsive and we highly recommend staying here when you are in Seattle. 
4454121,23533279,2014-12-03,9422302,(email hidden),"What a wonderful place to stay! Sven and Destiny were great hosts, making sure even before we arrived that we knew how to get there, where to park, etc. Nothing was left to chance. After a long travel day, the waiting bottle of wine was a fantastic welcome. 

Everything was exactly as described. While only minutes away from busy Seattle, it truly was a nature filled oasis which we enjoyed tremendously.  Would love to stay again."
4454121,23699990,2014-12-08,2441654,Andra,"The Apartment in the Trees is a GREAT spot for a weekend getaway in the city. The apartment is clean, well organized, comfortably modern and the perfect spot to host a few friends for the night. 
The Nest temperature system was awesome and the layout of the rooms gives a sense of privacy when needed but also allows for great communal relaxing. 
The kitchen was so fun to cook in but if you plan to make food bring your own cookware and extra tools; the kitchen was equipped with the essentials but not stocked for a 5-course meal :)
Sven was more than accommodating and I couldn't have asked for a better host from the outstanding welcome gifts to timely communication the next day.
I will definitely keep the Treehouse in the books for future trips to Seattle.
Thank you!!"
4454121,24884238,2015-01-03,12199379,Denise,"Beautiful view, great fit for four people - close enough to everything that ubering is perfectly affordable. Host was responsive to questions and we had a lovely stay. "
4808173,24439789,2014-12-28,905781,Joshua,"We didn't get a chance to meet Caitlin on this trip, but she was very communicative and helpful beforehand. Her instructions for getting into the apartment were very thorough and easy. The apartment itself is wonderful. It's in an amazing location, and yet very quiet despite being so near such a busy part of town. Her place is very comfortable (the bed was amazing), and has everything one would need for a Seattle stay. It was a perfect apartment and a perfect stay!"
4808173,24795534,2015-01-02,12912760,Tegan,Caitlin and Charlie's flat is in an excellent location and is super comfortable. We loved feeling like we had our own place in Capitol Hill with everything in easy walking distance. Caitlin's communication before arrival was outstanding. We would love to stay here again.

3563218,17474831,2014-08-12,3345297,"Hita, Matt & Magali","James is a wonderful guy. We chat a little bit with him when we arrived. He even offered snacks! :) We had to leave early to drive down to Portland to catch our flight home. My daughter enjoyed staying at his place. The room itself is located in a very convenient location near a bus stop and Safeway (next door). We left the window open all night to let the cool air came in, we slept like babies! Thank you so much for letting us stay at your home, Jim!"
3563218,17549325,2014-08-13,16446088,Gunner,James was fantastic!! He really helped us out when we were in a squeeze. We appreciate James very much and wish him the best in his future endeavors! 
3563218,17650611,2014-08-15,19445521,Angela,It was a nice stay. The room was clean. You also have nice access to the roof at this apartment. James is a very kind host. He mostly keeps to himself but he has all kinds of snacks prepared for his guests in his kitchen. His cake/bread that he bakes himself is delicious! Thanks James!

3563218,18073410,2014-08-21,2900847,Dora,"Staying at James' was great. He greeted us when we arrived and gave us a quick tour of the place. My boyfriend and I stayed for 6 days and 5 nights. It was everything we needed; a place to sleep and clean up. Towels, snacks and WiFi were provided, which were nice perks. We never took advantage of the washer and dryer, but I wish we had! James gave us a key to the apartment and a key to our room (even though I never felt a need to lock the bedroom door). We didn't rent a car, so our mode of transportation was the bus. Fortunately, there was a stop for the 73 right across the street and it took us right into downtown. Only a block away was a Safeway with a delicious deli/cafe counter. They even had a little area to enjoy your food. It's perfect if you're traveling on a budget. And across the street from Safeway was a 7-Eleven, for anything you needed after Safeway hours. We usually came back to the apartment after 10pm and the only thing I was most concerned about the noise level. Meaning, I wasn't sure if we were quiet enough coming in. Overall, it was a positive experience. "
3563218,18445477,2014-08-26,20086550,Marina,"James was lovely! The place was clean and tidy, and all the basic necessities were provided. The area was nice too, easy to drive to all parts of the city. A perfect place to stay on a road trip! "

His place has all of them. Safeway is just around the corner and bus stop is in front of the house. Subway is a block away and Northgate Mall is 20 minutes away on foot. Thank you so much Jim to be so nice to my little daughter! Special thanks!!"

I was disappointed there wasn't breakfast available. There was a coffee machine but it looked complicated to use. The other BnBs I've stayed at had stuff like granola, cereal, bagels, etc, some kind of milk, coffee, juice, etc easily found in the kitchen. I looked here and didn't see stuff like that. I went out for breakfast instead. :["

Also loved the keyless entry....a code provided gets you in and is how lock the door. The house from the outside does not impress because it is being renovated, but the inside apt is perfect.

6361863,48936672,2015-09-29,44046035,Josephine,"Kurt and Anna sent us information on the area before we arrived so that we would have some good walks and places to eat.  They offered any type of help that we needed in getting to know the surrounding neighborhood.  The apartment was very clean and had magazines about and maps of the area.  The best part was that the house is within walking distance to several blocks of shops, bars and restaurants.  If you want to go further (e.g., to Pike Place Market), you can see the sights of Seattle in a 2.5 mile (one-way walk).  We didn't need to do that, though, because we have seen downtown and had fun in Queen Anne Hill."
6361863,49279512,2015-10-02,34195674,Dan,"Kurt and Anna's place was a perfect place, great location and the pictures are very true and accurate. It was a busy trip for me and only did get to meet Kurt in person, very friendly and welcoming. Highly recommend staying here and will be looking to see their availability the next trip to Seattle.   "
6361863,49395469,2015-10-03,7097482,Elaine,"Fantastic location, fantastic place. A quick, last minute trip, in and out, but the place was perfect. Thanks! Kurt and Anna were very prompt to respond and send entry instructions. Would stay again! "
6361863,49678395,2015-10-05,22070422,Gary,"Immaculate, nicely finished basement.  You'll hear the host's baby occasionally, which they do disclose, so you have to be ok with that.  Very comfortable bed, rain shower was amazing, great water pressure.  Easy access, loved the location.  Short walk to shops, coffee, restaurants."
6361863,49930043,2015-10-07,31731936,Taylor,Great location. Very clean
6361863,50107296,2015-10-09,4496823,Jessica,"Their home was a lovely place to call home for a few days during our first visit to Seattle. It's clean, cozy and private and was a wonderful home base for exploring all Seattle had to offer. Would definitely stay again!"
6361863,51317959,2015-10-19,9271485,Carol,"Our stay was wonderful!
Directions to the location were great. Entering and exiting was simple. Plenty of parking. Walking distance to stores, restaurants and everything you could need.
Fabulous bed, linens, towels and amenities! They thought of everything... Literally everything! We will definitely stay again!"
6361863,51596064,2015-10-21,40905555,Susanna,"Super cozy yet modern basement apartment in a great location. This is a perfect place with great lighting, and we never heard the owners. It had everything we needed including great restaurants and grocery stores within walking distance. West Queen Anne is a safe area close to the city and parking was no problem. We really appreciate the little touches that made us feel so welcome for our last minute booking. Thank you so much for opening your home to us Anna & Kurt."
6361863,51849175,2015-10-24,46678420,Andrew,My wife and I enjoyed staying at Kurt and Anna's house. It was very spacious clean and located in a wonderful part of town. It's very close to shops restaurants and everything you can think of like supermarkets and other things.
6361863,52235527,2015-10-27,15217509,Anni,"Anna was absolutely wonderful! She answered all of our questions ahead of time and was very flexible with our arrival time. The mother-in-law suite was lovely. The suite was very clean and had an open feel to it. The bed was comfortable and the unit was easy to access. The unit is underground and while it is secluded, not all of the windows had blinds or curtains. However, it is the located in the perfect spot in Queen Anne. You are within 0.4 miles of a Trader Joe's and plenty of restaurants and short bus ride to the heart of downtown. We thoroughly enjoyed staying at Anna's!  "
6361863,52445722,2015-10-29,46675574,Dan,The home was perfect and a great location.  It was extremely clean and well equipped.  We were able to walk to great restaurants and shopping on Queen Ann Blvd.  Whenever we are in Seattle we will be staying here if possible!!
6361863,52620835,2015-10-31,5357063,Richard,"We had an excellent experience at Anna and Kurt's rental. The location was amazing, just a short walk to Queen Ann Ave. This place is lovely, everything about it is first rate, very clean, lovely appointments, great bed and wonderful shower. One of the nicest places we have rented. "
6361863,52908894,2015-11-02,9271485,Carol,"The stay at this wonderful place is in the heart of Queen Ann with great restaurants, shopping and within walking distance to everything you could imagine.  The rooms, bed and bathroom are exceptional.  The experience at this particular location is exceptional!"
6361863,53616941,2015-11-10,31925950,Arun,"Incredible place in the heart of Queen Anne! Perfect spot to call home base for a weekend trip to Seattle. The apartment is beautiful. It has its own private entrance, a warm and cozy living room/TV room, great bedroom, kitchenette, and large bathroom. The apartment is very clean and well decorated and Anna and Kurt are very welcoming. They provided lots of information on things to do, see, and eat in Seattle and were very communicative and willing to help us out while in Seattle. Overall, a great experience and we would definitely repeat again!"
6361863,54924258,2015-11-25,7577595,Heidi,Great neighborhood. All expectations were met. We has a great time. The children's toys were  a nice touch considering we had our young son with us. Thank you!
6361863,55207893,2015-11-29,19604448,Chunchi,This was a wonderful comfy little place in a fantastic location in Seattle. We were thrilled to be able to find it and so grateful that Kurt & Anna have such a lovely airBnB space that they are willing to rent out. The apartment is a nice remodel in the basement of the hosts' home in the fabulous Queen Anne neighborhood. I would recommend this place without hesitation and hope to come back again. 
6361863,56270110,2015-12-11,28947974,Fiona,"The house is very comfortable, relax, convenient, clean and pretty! And easy to check in and out. Thank you Kurt & Anna give my husband have excellent trip. We will come back again."
6361863,56548198,2015-12-14,6132889,William,"The  converted basement unit is in a great location. Only a 5 min walk from the restaurants and shops of Queen Anne. It was immaculately clean and very spacious. My rating reflects the noise issues in the unit. The head of the bed is located directly adjacent to the house furnace closet which makes substantial noise as it cycles on and off about every 20 minutes all night long. Our second night there we both resorted to wearing earplugs. Also, a Saturday night party in the host living area went until 11 pm and sounded like the guests were in the same rooms us."
6361863,56891352,2015-12-19,26496285,Marisol,"There was an adorable chalkboard with all the information I needed to login to wifi and the details on what to do when I checked out.  They kept things simple - no big book needed.  The bed was awesome - so comfy with fluffy down pillows and a big down comforter.  Nice finishes, beautiful little spot.

Couple things I wish I'd known before I arrived: 

1) the kitchen wasn't a real kitchen, just a fridge and a microwave and toaster.  Unfortunately, the fridge wasn't even working while I visited, though a note said it would be replaced on the 22nd, after I left.  There were only two plates and just a few glasses and items of silverware, which also made it difficult to eat anything in the apartment beyond a frozen dinner.  No bowls meant no cereal or soup, etc.

2) the basement apartment is only separated from the main house upstairs by a door at the top of the stairs.  This was locked and it felt quite private, but I could still hear conversations going on upstairs, so I felt very bad about watching TV or making any noise downstairs.  

Overall I had a nice stay and I would recommend the place, but it's good to know what you'll be getting ahead of time."
6361863,58212254,2016-01-01,8896468,Holly And Ben,"This home was just perfect for us 3 adults and a baby - my hubby and I took the sofa bed which was comfortable and in a spacious room. Our friend slept very well in the Master bedroom. Bathroom was bright and clean with an incredible shower. There were random noises like the furnace going on and off so if you're a light sleeper like me bring ear plugs. Also, you're in a separate unit from the home owners but you can hear them walking and talking upstairs. Unfortunately the fridge wasn't working which was an inconvenience with the baby but we were given notice prior and brought an icebox. The location is superb - in quaint Queen Anne with walking distance to the main strip. Free parking right infront of the house was great. Overall we had an exceptional stay and would highly recommend the place. One our top airbnb stays. Thank you Kurt and Anna for being prompt and very accommodating! "
6569950,42076692,2015-08-10,40545935,Todd,"The neighborhood was wonderful, parking was convenient, and best of all free, and the view was amazing!

The apartment was quite comfortable, it matched the description exactly.  It was maybe a five or ten minute walk down to all the restaurants, bars, and shops in the Queen Anne area.

It made us want to rent an apartment just like it when we move to Seattle!  The location is perfect, the neighborhood peaceful, and everywhere we wanted to go was well within walking distance!"
619366,1943168,2012-08-10,1181923,J & J,"Very charming apartment.  Lovely view and patio, comfy bed, accommodating host.  Would definitely recommend to others, and would rebook on my next trip to SEA.  "
619366,1986987,2012-08-14,641991,Bill,"Our stay at Gillian's garden apartment could not have been better. Her place was spotless, well appointed and the attention to detail was evident throughout. Communication with Gillian was prompt and clear and she was very accommodating-- an excellent host, overall. Her place is central yet quiet and very charming. I would book again and recommend highly to others."
619366,2045399,2012-08-20,3157670,Mary Pat,"The garden apartment is a bit of paradise.  The setting is
lovely and peaceful.  The apartment itself is spacious and
beautifully decorated.  The kitchen is set up with everything
one needs. There is lots of storage room and the bed
is a dream to sleep on. 
The location is perfect as a base to explore Seattle.  Lots
of good restaurants in the neighborhood and easy public
transportation to all parts of the city.
Gillian and Barbara were warm and welcoming.  Gillian
provided lots of information and maps that helped us
navigate all over town.  We look forward to getting to
know them better on our next trip to Seattle.  Definitely
a 5 star experience.
and welcoming.  Wish we could have gotten to know them
better"
619366,2083013,2012-08-24,1544163,Scott,"The apartment was even bigger and better than it looked in the photos, and the view was great!  It's in a very quiet and relaxing neighborhood, but there are definitely some fun spots and great food within a few blocks.  Parking was convenient and always available close by if you bring a car, but if you don't, it was easy to get around the neighborhood, and almost anything you could need is within walking distance.  Inside the apartment is comfy and cozy, especially the bed, and if you're lucky you'll get to hear some beautiful piano music from the second floor."
619366,2126781,2012-08-28,597943,Daphne Viola,"Fantastic accomodation. LOVELY apartment, beatiful view, quiet and yet central, and probably the most comfortable bed I ever slept in. 
Gillian and her mother were lovely hosts who left us enough privacy but were available when we needed help. 
Absolutely reccomended."
619366,2179893,2012-09-03,1021350,Natalie,"Gillian's place was amazing. The view of the garden patio was so beautiful and peaceful. The apartment was  spacious and clean. And the bed was comfortable and warm. The East Lake neighbourhood was quiet and safe and there was lots to visit near by. But the real jewel would be our hosts. Gillian messaged me of the first night to make sure I found everything alright and on top of it all, I forgot my earrings and necklace there and she is sending them to me. I definitely would be staying at Gillian's place next time I am in Seattle, and you should too."
619366,2263817,2012-09-11,3226791,Steve,"The apartment exceeded our expectations - we give it 5 stars.  It was very clean, spacious, comfortable, and full of warm and thoughtful decorations and furnishings.  The fresh flowers on the table when we arrived were just one of the many warm touches this place provided.  When we arrived we were greeted by Barbara and Gillian with warm smiles and offers to assist if we should need anything.  We have been to Seattle several times over the past 4 years and this absolutely was the best place we have ever stayed at – beats the hotel life big time!  We look forward to staying here on our next trip to Seattle!"
619366,2346288,2012-09-19,3271702,James,"As a frequent traveler for business and pleasure, I appreciate finding places I would recommend and will return to...this is definitely one of them. Enjoying my coffee on the patio each morning while watching the sun (yes, SUN) come up and shine on the lake as the crew teams glide by effortlessly on the water was surreal. The apartment is quaint with plenty of charm, yet modern and VERY clean. The bed is comfortable with quality linens. The kitchen has everything one might need to cook for him or herself. Parking is easy just steps away. Gillian and her mother are delightful, helpful and perfect hosts...always willing to help when asked, but in no way intrusive. All of this, plus its proximity to dowtown, restaurants, markets, public transportation and entertainment make this apartment an IDEAL alternative to a hotel. I just can't say enough nice things about the apartment, the setting and the host(s)."
619366,2427881,2012-09-27,3167835,R Kent,"This place is wonderful !
   
We had never stayed at a home while on vacation, always at a hotel.  With this great experience, we will do it again.
   
The location is close to downtown, without being too close.  The neighborhood is quiet and the few neighbors that we did meet were very nice.
The view of Lake Union is great - watching the sea planes come and go and the crew teams practicing.  
  
And the sunsets are too good to be true -  they were beautiful!
   
The apartment is a good size and has everything you would need and more, including a back porch for enjoying the evening.
I really enjoyed the kitchen -  we cooked 2 meals a day at the apartment and saved quite a bit of money.
"
619366,2456755,2012-09-30,100160,Shaula,"Lovely apartment, clean and comfortable. Beautiful view. Very easy check-in. Great communication by host. Plenty of street parking. Overall, a very nice alternative to a hotel.  "
619366,2537589,2012-10-08,1126242,Melissa,"A delightful spot. Bright and with magnificent views (indoors and outdoors) of water and sunset. Comfy bed and well appointed. I loved my stay there, and the Heathers were unobtrusive but kind and helpful when needed. I recommend this listing without a single qualification!"
619366,2842980,2012-11-09,2910126,Zori,"I HIGHLY recommend staying at Gillian's apartment on Lake Union.  The location is perfect. You are close to some great restaurants and buses  are a very short walk! The apartment is tucked away, creating a quiet oasis. I spent my mornings drinking coffee and watching the hummingbirds feast in her garden. The bed and couch were extremely comfortable, and the kitchen was perfectly stocked with cooking utensils. It was clean, cozy, and I loved how it was decorated. Gillian and her parents were always available when we needed them. We definitely plan to stay here again!"
619366,2887385,2012-11-15,3892321,John,"We had a wonderful stay at Gillian's Sky Cabin (rather than the Lake View garden apartment). We explored the neighbourhood and loved the restaurants and coffeeshops. We loved watching the seaplanes and rowers on Lake Union. Recommend visitiing Pete's Wine Shop (website hidden) and Volunteer Park Café (website hidden)

Getting to downtown is very quick on the bus and these some very frequently from just around the corner. The freeway is also close by but you don't hear it in the house.

As the other reviewers have said, the apartment is very very clean and comfortable and has everything your will need.

Highly recommended. "
619366,3134609,2012-12-22,3352041,Lynda,"I live in Seattle and I wanted to experience the semi-urban life of walking to work and I found the perfect place at Gillian's.
Gillian is a caring host and I stayed at her Sky Cabin (with an 180 degree view of Lake Union).  
The Sky Cabin would be a romantic get away or a personal retreat to journal, write, or do yoga!
I plan to stay at Gillian's Sky Cabin again!"
619366,3353564,2013-01-15,4530194,Susan,A wonderful stay in a serene setting. Gillian has thought of everything to make your stay comfortable and worry free. 
619366,3595829,2013-02-20,91381,Antje,"I am grateful for the opportunity  that I was able to stay at your lovely and indeed very relaxing ""sky cabin"". It was wonderful! The apartment is beautifully laid and has everything one needs to make you feel right at home. It has also an amazing view of Lake Union and everything from grocery store to restaurant and coffee shop is within walking distance. I would definitely recommend it for a a relaxing stay in Seattle. "
619366,3763754,2013-03-12,4990046,Robert,"Although our reservation was for the garden level unit, we actually stayed in the sky cabin due to construction. The sky cabin is on the top floor with a wall of windows overlooking Lake Union and Gas Works park. The unit was spotless and was newly constructed or remodeled. It was very quiet; Gillian's mother said she had been practicing piano, but we heard nothing. A small vase of fresh flowers greeted us on the table. The bed was very comfortable and the shower fantastic with 3 shower heads, lots of hot water, and a heated tile floor. The kitchen is basic, with dishes and cooking pots/pans provided. There was no dish washer or garbage disposal.

Parking was on the street a block away from the unit.

We did not have the pleasure of meeting Gillian and dealt only with Gillian's mother who was a gracious as promised."
619366,4727986,2013-05-22,2830624,Bill,"This is a terrific apartment in a very cool neighborhood.  It is exactly as advertised.  My only complaint is I couldn't stay longer.  Thanks
Bill Kramer"
619366,4866042,2013-05-29,6216594,Alexandra,"We had a great stay in the apartment, loved the back deck and the beautiful view.  Gillian and her mother were great hosts and we appreciated the information on near-by things to do."
619366,4937352,2013-06-03,5708153,Emily,"A spacious, comfortable apartment with a great view of the lake, Gasworks Park, and plenty of seaplanes.  Everything was as described and Gillian responded quickly to all questions. Street parking within a block or 2 was easy to find. Several good food options in walking distance, especially Luisa’s bakery.  Bathroom a bit small but that was not a problem for us. We would absolutely stay there again."
619366,5157822,2013-06-16,5478577,Marilyn,"Our stay was quiet and restful. The setting was beautiful, with a patio, lovely garden, and view of the water.  Inside was nicely decorated, with a comfortable bed and convenient kitchen.  We very much enjoyed our stay there. Gillian was responsive and attentive to our needs. "
619366,5340595,2013-06-25,81566,Michael,"It is epic to stay there, super fantastic. The location is very central to all of the neighborhoods of Seattle and made getting to and engaging the region so easy. 

The space is heaven and so nice/peaceful to stay in, the view is so great, the setting and the amenities are as well....epic.

The very best thing I can say is...I would love to stay here again, but as well know that as the word gets out about this gem, I know the place will find many romantics to keep this place fully booked. We deeply and happily enjoyed this very special space.

The neighborhood is safe and parking easy to find. The nearby places that we enjoyed were the waterfront of Lake Union/houseboats and seaplanes, the cafes(14 Carrots), Voxx(coffee) and Serafina ...all great...

You will be thrilled with this...lovely place"
619366,5457652,2013-07-01,4538973,Rebecca,"This garden apartment far exceeded my expectations, which were already high thanks to the beautiful photos and to Gillian, who was incredibly friendly and helpful from the beginning. The apartment was clean and bright, and the bed is one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in. The garden patio was a perfect place to sit with a cup of tea in the morning, looking out over the lake. The apartment was well stocked with everything you need for a comfortable stay, and the space was more than enough for two. I would absolutely stay here again, if given the opportunity."
619366,5530768,2013-07-04,263047,Heather,"Location. Location. Location. Nestled just a block off Lake Union this charming apartment is the gateway between downtown Seattle and the University district. We were lucky enough to visit during a very warm, sunny summer week, which among many perks meant we were able to walk just a short distance for a refreshing dip in Lake Union. Gillian's garden apartment is also the perfect place to stay if you enjoy riding bicycles. Just minutes away you'll find the Burke Gilman Bike Trail as well as the I-5 Colonnade mountain bike park - what a brilliant use of formally unused space under the freeway. The apartment is very clean, quiet, and boasts an amazing view! "
619366,5752023,2013-07-15,5488118,Amy,"We had a great stay in the garden apartment. The place is fantastic, well furnished, with a phenomenal shower (much better than ours at home) and a bedroom opening onto a beautiful garden patio overlooking the lake. We previously lived in Eastlake for 6 years - it's a great neighborhood and we were happy to get to visit again. Gillian was extremely friendly and helpful in providing information about the apartment and the area. We were also lucky enough to get to hear the wonderful piano playing from the space above on a lazy Saturday afternoon. We can't wait to stay there again the next time we visit Seattle."
619366,5838450,2013-07-18,7483168,Amy,I absolutely love this place!  This is my first airbnb experience and it set the bar pretty high.  The place is so cute and cozy.  I could live here permanently.  It is right by the water and you can see the house boats floating nearby.  I walked to the local restaurants and enjoy all the town had to offer (The Blind Pig Tavern was my favorite!).  It felt like I was a local and not in a busy hotel district.  The place was spotless and very comfortable.  Gillian left me coffee and even beer!  I would definitely stay here again and again!
619366,5910499,2013-07-22,2753100,Michael,"Gillian was a great host and effectively communicated everything I needed for my stay to run smoothly. The space was very comfortable, clean, spacious, came with everything that you would need in your own home and had a gorgeous view of lake union(as seen in the pictures). It was also conveniently by a few busses that took me to downtown seattle in a few minutes. The neighborhood is quiet, safe and nice with a few good restaurants that are walking distance from the garden apartment. I had an amazing time in Seattle and Gillian and her place certainly helped with that. "
619366,6452933,2013-08-13,2381845,Diane,"Everything is perfect in this garden apartment with a lovely view of Lake Union and, in the distance, Gas Works Park.  We ate dinner on the patio most nights, looking out over the lake and watching the boats.

Location is excellent; we walked to nice bars with terraces on the lake an also good internet cafes.  Parking was fine.

 The apartment is exceedingly clean and everything is beautifully organized. Gillian was around and could not have been more helpful.  A wonderful experience. "
619366,6562786,2013-08-17,3084510,Anna,"This was the perfect place to stay for our quick two days in Seattle! Check in/out was very easy. The apartment is nicely decorated and has the essential items you may need in the kitchen, as well as books and Seattle information, and the bed is super comfortable. Overall a great experience. "
619366,6684975,2013-08-21,1644619,Nicholas,"Our stay at Gillian's was our best airbnb experience so far. You can tell she is in the hospitality industry, she has thought of everything. From kitchen utensils to bus schedules, it's all there along with her informative notes. The apt was bigger and brighter than expected- beautifully decorated. The view from the patio of Lake Union was stunning, We spent considerable time sitting on the patio, sipping a glass of wine, watching the boat and float plane traffic. Next time we're in Seattle, we woiuld stay again. Thanks Gillian"
619366,6778227,2013-08-25,6303584,Ian,"Gillian was an amazing host, she was a pleasure to work with and responded promptly to any questions we had. The apartment was a great size, clean, and well stocked with anything we needed. In addition the location and view were great. I would recommend Gillian and the garden apartment to anyone."
619366,7034065,2013-09-04,6746464,Alison,"My boyfriend Seth and I stayed at Gillians place while we went to the Bumbershoot festival. Her place was wonderful, it has a gorgeous view of lake union. Was very close to bus lines that ran frequently. Gillian left lots of information on where to eat, grocery shop, and a very detailed diagram on where to park, which was very helpful because there are parking restrictions in that area. We had a great time and really enjoyed staying in her place, it is very nice, many kitchen supplies, great artwork around the house, we were able to make nice dinners. We would love to stay there again and explore more of Seattle. "
619366,7550234,2013-09-24,4523817,Sascha,"I stayed about a dozen times with AirBnB and Wimdu, this stay ranks in the top 3. The appartment is in a residential area, safe and quite. It is a very cozy place, ideal when it is raining in Seattle and you want to stay at home with a tea, watching lake Union or reading a book. 
You need to take the car or the bus to go to downtown, the next bus station is 2 minutes from the appartment. Some shops, bars and restaurants are close to the appartment.
Gillian and her mother helped me to find a optician because my glasses were broken during the flight from Frankfurt to Seattle. Her mother even drove me to the optician, what can you ask more?
Conclusion: Highly recommended, better than any hotel stay."
619366,7670788,2013-09-29,3700593,Regina,"We greatly enjoyed our stay and even had 2 sunny nights to sit on the patio overlooking Lake Union.  The apartment is spacious, clean, and has everything you may need.  Lots of good restaurants within walking distance, which is nice since you don't have to worry about using your car much.  There is on street parking, but she has a great map of where you can go at which times, so we were able to park within 1/2 block each time.  We would love to stay here again!"
619366,7760702,2013-10-01,225658,Deb,"Gillian was friendly,helpful and accommodating.  Her garden apartment was awesome!  Beautiful views of LakeUnion and the houseboats,  fabulous location near everything.  Gillian also had great recommendations for close by restaurants.  Would definitely stay there again!"
619366,7794098,2013-10-03,2459928,Trey,"This is a nice clean and warm bottom floor apartment with a great view. There was no really noticeable disturbance from the upstairs. As a very tall person (6'5"") I found myself ducking under a few things so it was not an *ideal* space for me but other than that I have no complaints. The parking ""situation"" is really not an issue, there were plenty of places to park nearby every night. During the day there seemed to be fewer spaces but we never had to park inconveniently far away. It's in a central location in Seattle and I definitely recommend staying here!"
619366,8037591,2013-10-14,1126242,Melissa,"I just got home from my second stay at the Heather House lake view apartment with the prettiest garden right out the door ... and I miss it! Everything about the apartment is choice: the view of course!; it is well appointed; the bed is cozy. The ease of interactions with Gillian and her parents--all so responsive, kind, and easy to talk to--made my stay wonderful. They are very unobtrusive and considerate. I just love this place! It is lovely rain or shine!!!"
619366,8238107,2013-10-21,6219537,Michelle,"Loved Gillian's place!  Clean, fully stocked, comfortable, and SURPRISINGLY quiet for where it is located.  We thought we would have heard I-5, but did not.  Safe and quiet.  Only thing we'd have liked is a bathtub."
619366,8298646,2013-10-24,206203,Amanda,"The Lake Union View Garden apartment is that and much more. It is nicely decorated, very comfortable, quiet, and has everything you could need for a home away from home. Good value also. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it as a great hotel alternative."
619366,8465892,2013-11-01,8989421,Judy,A wonderful little hideaway but so close to everything.  We were so comfortable in Gillian's apartment. Very easy to get around from East Lake and very central to everything.  We did ride the Burke-Gilman bike trail from the apartment and had a great time.  East Lake Bar and Grill is a close fun place to visit (twice). Would recommend easily.  We enjoyed meeting Gillian's mother and listening to the piano music.
619366,8824686,2013-11-19,7862902,Maggie,"This apartment is charming, cozy, relaxing and perfectly placed. We loved having a view of the lake while lounging around this adorable space. Gillian decorated the space to feel like home away from home. She also chose incredible furniture that is all really comfortable! The bed is wonderful to sleep in. LOVED it! It is clean and has all the necessities. The location is wonderful too! I had to work in Seattle for two days and it was a short and easy 10 minute drive into the city.  We only wish we would have had more time to enjoy the space and the surrounding area. We highly recommend staying here!"
619366,8945560,2013-11-27,52803,Ursula,"This apartment is absolutely fantastic. It was just as lovely, cozy, & well-appointed as you'd expect from the pictures, and the view was stunning. The location itself was also very convenient, and finding parking was consistently easy. Gillian made check-in and check-out a breeze. I would highly recommend staying here to anyone!"
619366,9083621,2013-12-05,7067049,Adele,"Loved the unit. Clean, cozy and gave us some great ideas to take home with us. Enjoy this area, good coffee shops and restaurants, public trans is easy from here. Hard to beat and the price is right. Thanks again Gillian.
"
619366,9131534,2013-12-09,376519,Emily,"What a beautiful, cozy and relaxing apartment in Seattle! We had a wonderful time at Gillian's apartment for the weekend. She was great at communicating directions and instructions before our visit. The apartment has everything you could want and felt like home. We wished we could stay longer and would love to stay again!"
619366,9495218,2013-12-31,7659986,Roberta,"Gillian was a lovely host and the apartment was cozy and lovely.  Thank you, we will be back:)
Roberta and Philip Hermann"
619366,9867753,2014-01-15,10906820,Chenghui,Fantastic! Fantastic! Fantastic! Very nice house and a nice landlady. 
619366,10184260,2014-02-04,1572780,Mike,"I have a hard time writing this review because my fear is that everyone will find out this apartment is a gem, and won't be available next time I come to Seattle. 

A view of the lake ... from bed. A bathroom that was spotless. Great water pressure and heat in the shower. A full kitchen. Quiet. Real quiet. A very warm bedroom with a thermostat that functioned marvelously. And a host that responded within minutes every time I contacted her. Helpful maps and diagrams pointed the way to parking and shops and restaurants. 

Everything new, everything clean. If this was a hotel room, it'd cost over 300/night. Fantastic. 

Only con: As a 6'4"" guy, I almost hit my head on one of the ceiling beams. A small con that I really have to stretch for, but I figured I'd put it in to give the rest of my review gravity. My girlfriend wanted to live there. Beautiful. 

"
619366,10427905,2014-02-18,5326024,Peter And Mary,"Gillian is very responsive and the apt is very nice and perfect for our four day stay.  It was more than just comfortable, we really enjoyed all of the small touches of the flat.  

Would stay here again.

"
619366,10490262,2014-02-21,6438676,Kate,What a wonderful apartment!  We have to agree with Mike's review; this place is a real gem!  We truly felt at home here and Gillian had clearly thought of everything to make her guests feel this way; it was such an easy and comfortable stay and we couldn't have wished for more.  Gillian was easily reachable and very helpful in her responses to our emails.  Would recommend to all!
619366,10818176,2014-03-09,11869178,Dieter,"1)There is nothing to complain about the apartment: the kitchen equipment is overcomplete, everything is clean and well prepared when you move in. It is an old, charming building nicely renovated: the heating system does the job very well, the shower room is very good, maybe a little small but sufficient for one to two persons.
2)I was surprised not to hear any of the traffic noise of the I5 nearby when being inside of the apartment. Even outside on the little veranda it was surprisingly quiet. The weather could have been a little better at the time of my staying but you cannot blame Gillian for that.
3)When planning the next trip to Seattle I would check about Gillian’s apartment again.
Kind regards Dieter Ketels

619366,11194266,2014-03-24,1976629,Allon,"My wife and I stayed in Gillian's apartment for 3 nights.  We found it very clean, comfortable, and quiet.  Will definitely consider coming back the next time we're in Seattle!"
619366,11291280,2014-03-28,13387582,Sue,"Really enjoyed staying in the Garden Apartment, very well equipped, amazing view of the lake and very nicely furnished.
Barbara was very welcoming and helpful, but we quickly found how to get around and it was close to the University of Washington and Lake Union, as well as near the city.
Tried to book again for our return but it was already booked, will be back though."
619366,11366543,2014-03-31,12883719,Carly,"My husband and I had a great visit. The apartment is clean, cute, and extremely comfortable. Parking was so easy and I love the Eastlake neighborhood. We would definitely stay here again and certainly recommend it!
"
619366,11552605,2014-04-07,12934633,Ryan,"Gillian's garden apartment is an absolute gem!  I found everything to be perfectly appointed and clean.  The view from all rooms overlooking Lake Union is amazing!  

I was in town for multiple days for work.  Gillian covers every detail and is incredibly easy to work with.  In fact, she is so detailed, that I never had a need to contact her during my stay.  The bed is incredibly comfortable too--I slept better than my own bed!  Parking is surprisingly easy--I never had an issue finding a place close.  And last, the Italian restaurants nearby--Serrafina & Chiccohete are outstading.

I would highly recommend staying here--fantastic experience."
619366,11717511,2014-04-13,6169333,Kate,"Loved it.  The description was accurate.  Nice and quiet but centrally located.   Parking always was easy, within one block.  Apartment very comfortable and we would happily have stayed longer than our five days.  "
619366,11935621,2014-04-19,14012398,Marya,"[Written by husband who was the guest, under wife's account reservation was under.]

This was a wonderful in-city getaway for me to relax and focus. Surprisingly spacious, quiet, and private even though it's loaded with windows.

As mentioned, it's a bit low-ceilinged but 5'11"" me didn't have a problem. Other quirks of a 1912 home folks should expect: The steps down to the entry are a bit awkwardly spaced/sloped, and part of the floor is sloped which can be awkward if you're not expecting that.

If we are ever in need of another in-city getaway, I'm definitely looking here first."
619366,12067744,2014-04-22,7803729,Kerri,Gillian's lake view home was PERFECT for us. Peaceful and charming!  I can't wait to return!
619366,12247598,2014-04-27,8293504,Debora,"Gillian was a perfect host for us.  Her home was clean and very comfortable with all the amenities you would need for a relaxing stay.  The location is perfect, close enough to walk to downtown and far enough so that you can relax.  We stayed four days for a coffee event at the convention center.  Gillian was kind enough to allow us to check-in early...also we forgot our check-out day and she was very understanding.  I definitely recommend her home and would like to visit Seattle again in the future."
619366,12337374,2014-04-29,5839279,Tania,The apartment was so charming and just perfect.  It had everything we needed for a comfortable stay.  Wish we could've stayed longer!
619366,12553802,2014-05-05,13649445,Maria,"How do you describe a perfect place in words? Near impossible. We loved the garden apartment so much we did not want to leave it again. This is not a strange anonymous hotel room, this is a place to come to and feel right at home!
Communication with Gillian was very easy and we had a very detailed description of how to find the place.
We discovered the surroundings mostly by foot. Until the last day of our stay we did not have a car but the bus stop is just around the corner and takes you into Seattle in about 15 minutes."
619366,16392081,2014-07-27,12034599,Robbie,Wonderful place! Just as advertised. Both Gillian and her mother are extremely nice and welcoming and very easy to communicate with.
619366,16703839,2014-08-01,13442311,Renate,"Gillian provided us all the information we need to feel at ""home"" in her place. Everything was there as she described. We felt very welcome, also by her mother who lives on the 1st floor."
619366,17040573,2014-08-06,13713362,Karen,"Gillian's apartment was perfect for us.  It was a short driving distance to anywhere.  Street parking was easy to find.  

The apartment had everything we needed to be comfortable.  We had a nice view of Lake Union from the back patio and we sat out there 2 of our 3 nights.  

I would definitely stay here again!"
619366,17213185,2014-08-09,7495259,Jihong,"It takes 20-30 to downtown by bus. It has fantastic view. You can see the lake union on the bed. 
It has everything that you need. Maps.infor.books.Many towel. Enough cooker.The room condition was very nice and clean.
You should stay here."
619366,17496896,2014-08-13,12805593,Janine,"Gillian was an excellent host -- allowing us an early check-in, fresh picked plums from the yard on the table and flower on the table when we arrived.  Full information about the area, including maps and tourist magazines were provided, which we found really helpful.  We feel like we really lucked out being able to stay in such a clean, light-filled, cozy place with exceptional views of the water from every spot.  The kitchen was fully stocked with cooking supplies and essentials; additionally, coffee beans and other pantry items as well.  The Eastlake area on Union Lake is a quiet area with close and quick access to downtown and central Seattle."
619366,17685922,2014-08-16,17014603,Virginia,"We loved the Garden Apartment!  The location was convenient, both for driving our own vehicle for activities around the city (parking near the apartment was not a problem) and taking a local bus to downtown.  Very good restaurants within walking distance also.  The apartment was very comfortable, with such nice attention to detail.  It was like a small home away from home.  Thanks for sharing this location on Airbnb!"
619366,18164104,2014-08-23,12882623,Lesley,"This is a charming apartment.  We loved coming ""home"" to it after exploring the district.  Access to the garden with a great view over Lake Union was a plus.  Gillian had thought of everything for our comfort and convenience, and her warm personality was in evidence everywhere."
619366,18297122,2014-08-25,13168493,Monica,"I could not have asked for more from this experience. The home is beautiful, cozy, and had everything I could possibly need. The view was breathtaking, especially with the warm weather and all the fun activity going on in the water and across the lake at Gas Works Park.  The backyard and garden is adorable. With such a fantastic home, it was hard to force myself to leave and explore the area! There were so many things to enjoy in walkable distance, including great food, coffee shops, a killer French bakery, and sweet little parks. It was also fun to see all the house boats. Gillian had all the guides, maps, recommendations, and information for the entire area needed to make sure nothing was missed.  I had such a wonderful time! I am still daydreaming about this place! I would definitely recommend Gillian's home to anyone and can't wait to return myself!"
619366,18648984,2014-08-30,1881015,Asti,It's a very very lovely place to stay in and Gillian gave very detailed description before we arrived to ensure smooth check in. I wish we could have stayed longer in Gillian's as it really is that comfortable and homey. Thanks for your hospitality Gillian! I highly recommend this place.
619366,18782950,2014-09-01,12188986,Amy,The place was great and had everything we needed! It was very comfortable and perfect for a long weekend. Gillian is a great host. 
619366,19491432,2014-09-13,20856445,Greg,"My host, Gillian, made me feel welcome by promptly responding to me when I first inquired about the availability of her apartment, and thoroughly providing directions as well as instructions for gaining access to the apartment.  I found a clean, inviting apartment waiting for me upon my arrival along with maps, tour books, and information about restaurants, grocery stores, and public transit etc.  Thanks to Gillian's directions, I was able to easily catch a nearby express bus to downtown Seattle each day which was only about a 15 minute ride to the stop for my conference.  The apartment offers a nice view just like viewers see in the bedroom photo and I found it to be comfortable in all respects.   This was my first time utilizing airbnb; but, it won't be my last because Gillian helped make my experience such a positive one!         "
619366,20155773,2014-09-24,1544218,Van,"Wow this place is great! I put my parents up at Gillian's for a week during my wedding. It's so cozy and well appointed. You are basically looking right out onto Lake Union, great view of Gas Works Park and totally in a cute part of the Eastlake neighborhood. My parents loved it. My dad walked around quite a bit and just felt really comfortable there.  Parking was really easy, the location was really perfect, wifi was great, bed was comfy and it just had a really great feel to it. Nothing cheap or shintzy about it! It's the kind of place you'd want to live in! My dad said he wished he could stay for month!"
619366,20357267,2014-09-28,20672451,Janet,"This a real gem of a place to stay in Seattle. A home away from home. Gillian has not overlooked anything. The apartment is so well equipped with a wonderful ambience. Large comfy bedroom with walkout to the pretty little garden. Lovely living room with a comfy chair looking out to a wonderful view of Lake Union. Kitchen is well equipped with staples! It was lots of fun to work in. 
Eastlake is a great community with great walks, proximity to the water along with a good choice of restaurants. Good transit to downtown Seattle. I am so looking forward to making this my Seattle home when I come to visit my family. Thank you Gillian. This apartment reflects your creativity, warmth and generosity."
619366,20653687,2014-10-03,2534572,Doug,"Great stay at this cozy apartment. Plenty of room to spread out, nice view of the lake from the bedroom, very well kept and comfortable. Convenient to downtown and I-5. Good restaurants a short walk. Would recommend this as a great stay. 

Parking can be a little confusing but the host makes it very easy with maps and recommendations. "
619366,21712872,2014-10-22,21604954,Elaine,"Host was very engaged in making sure we had access to the property and directions on how to get settled in.  Very friendly but not intrusive.  

The property was clean, orderly and exactly as described.  Very private space.  Very well located for both downtwon and univeristy.  Great walks along the lake or in the neighborhood.  Louisa is great for breakfast, lunch or dinner in walking distance."
619366,21884925,2014-10-26,20631712,Jen,"Gillian's place was perfect!  The desciption of the place is dead on.  It was cozy, very clean, and had eveything you need for a short or extended stay.  It was very quiet in that neighborhood, not one siren or barking dog :)  The wild life (birds & squirrels) outside was so nice to watch as well.  The view from the livingroom and bedroom were an added bonus.  Yes anyone over 6'2"" not a great fit, the ceilings are low but also is what made the place so cozy!  Thank you for such a great place Gillian and mom. And we did get to hear the paino playing, very nice :)"
619366,22221981,2014-11-01,2368444,Jae,We loved our stay. It was so lovely and clean. The host also provides all information you could possibly need. The mattress was not the most comfortable thing but i slept fine. I highly recommend it!
619366,22459640,2014-11-07,21342600,John,"Great location near excellent restaurants, good wine shops and grocers, the Seattle Caviar Company, bus lines, the Burke-Gilman Trail, and the University of Washington. Great view across Lake Union to Gas Works Park. Very spacious and quiet. Very well equipped in kitchen, bath, and sleeping departments. I thoroughly enjoyed staying there and it will be my first choice when I next visit Seattle. "
619366,22602315,2014-11-10,6490610,Jema,"The listing is exactly as the pictures show it.  My boyfriend and I had a wonderful time here.  We stayed for 3 nights, and on the morning of check-in I received a text from Gillian letting me know that the previous booking checked-out very early and that we wouldn't have to wait until 3pm to check-in because it was ready for us anytime.  

We had no issues with the apartment whatsoever, and it really is a little gem.  The neighborhood is very quiet and quaint.  We enjoyed walks down by the houseboats, to coffee in the morning, and late night food/drinks at Babirusa.  And by the way, Babirusa is the most amazing little bar I have ever been to.  Imagine a medley of Skid Row, Joan Jett, Journey and Def Leopard playing while snacking on fried almonds & chick peas, a salad of apples with braised celery, kohlrabi, oats and pecan butter, and sipping a Fun Uncle.  A-Ma-Zing.

The only drawback to the listing was finding parking.  But we never parked more than a block away."
619366,22782954,2014-11-14,2446528,Darren,Great location. Beautiful view. Will stay here again.
619366,23007242,2014-11-20,748405,Deborah,"I loved it as it didn't feel like staying in a hotel - felt like home.  Which is good because Seattle is my second home :) I know the neighbourhood well as I used to live only a 5 minute walk from Gillian's house.  It is a lovely area.  Close to the city centre but on a quiet street with amazing views of Lake Union, Gas Works Park and the Olympic Mountains in the distance.  It is also very close to the Houseboats and there is a lovely walk closeby.  The house itself was so cosy and quirky; and was very well equipped with things to make you feel right at home.  The bed and sofa were both comfortable.  I absolutely loved it and hope to stay here again each time I come to Seattle."
619366,23175069,2014-11-24,719449,Kathy,"My husband and I were so happy with this space. The apartment itself is lovely with excellent views. Location and the neighborhood is great and ease of access to other parts of Seattle is very easy as well. We will definitely have this as a go to location in the fantastic  Emerald city. We love Seattle and this space is icing on the cake for us. Gillian was great in her communications with us before we arrived, we could not have asked for a better few days."
619366,24247709,2014-12-23,22718805,Christina,I had a great experience staying at this lovely apartment for several weeks.  The unit is very comfortable and the view is a treasure.  Gillian is a wonderful host and the neighborhood is cute with many restaurant options.  
619366,25268929,2015-01-11,23671889,Serena,"This is a great apartment.  Much larger than the photos are able to make it look.  Great little kitchen, fully outfitted even a little coffee to get use started in the morning.  Sitting room is nice and roomy with the TV and bathroom.  The bed was comfortable and the room was great, love the decorations.
The location was great, close to the 5 and Lake Union.  We were able to see the lake from the every window, especially the bedroom.    Would love to come back and stay again.  "
619366,25414427,2015-01-15,25107374,Matt,"All the amenities of a hotel and all the comforts of home. We were able to walk to Pete's market 3 separate days, and cooked dinner and breakfast. Bus stops a block away provided easy transport north and south. Beautiful neighborhood, great for (website hidden) and Netflix for a quiet evening in. Responsive and unobtrusive hosts! Beautiful view, cozy and safe. This was my first time using AirBnB, and it was definitely worth it in every way!"
619366,25556935,2015-01-19,16712806,Shanna,"This adorable place was cozy and perfect for a romantic getaway with my boyfriend. The boats on Lake Union are literally the first thing you see when you wake up in the morning and if you're lucky enough to have a non-overcast day (like we were) you can see the sunrise over the lake as well! Gillian provided lots of extra blankets, towels and even went the extra mile to stock the fridge with eggs, beer, condiments and every pot/pan/utensil you may every need! The neighborhood was right around the houseboats where Sleepless in Seattle was filmed, so very picturesque -- yet, it was a few blocks off a main street so easy to get to and only 12 minutes (according to GoogleMaps) to downtown! She even has a nice TV that you can watch Netflix. I highly recommend this spot to anyone looking to stay in Seattle. It is better than any hotel, hands down!"
619366,25931230,2015-01-30,18098628,Creagh,"Our host, Gillian, made us feel very comfortable in her great setting.  The apartment was very clean, had all the things we needed (coffee, basic kitchen supplies, magazines, head lamps for reading, umbrellas, lint remover, etc) and the rooms were tastefully furnished and decorated.  The bed was very comfortable, the TV was great with basic cable and netflix... Who could ask for more?  Location, Location, Location and a really great view.  There are many good restaurants near by as well.  "
619366,26388649,2015-02-11,6726569,Patrick,"This was a great location and a really cozy and next space that was well appointed, very clean, and in a great neighbourhood close to everything. Great care and attention went into the space and Gillian's mother was charming.
We would love to stay here again!
"
619366,26508308,2015-02-14,13114174,Goria,"Gillian is very considerate in making everything perfect for me, her apartment is lovely & comfortable, especially I like the small stuff decorated inside & the garden. And the location is good, a few bus lines to downtown nearby. I really enjoyed my stay at her apartment & felt at home : ) "
619366,26744393,2015-02-18,20672451,Janet,"Once again, I enjoyed my second stay in Gillian's Garden Apartment, My home away from home. It is so cosy and I love the view of the lake and The Gasworks. As clean as ever and so well stocked....nothing is lacking. Was fun to see the little garden in almost spring bloom. Slept well on the comfy bed. Louisa's Cafe/Bakery just around the corner is a great find. Looking forward to my next Seattle visit and stay at Gillian's."
619366,27337220,2015-03-02,3291139,Donna,"Very quaint, darling and very quiet one bedroom.  I loved staying here.  It's a little gem.  Very clean and well decorated.   Great views and I'm sure in the summer the garden is awesome.   Gillian was great and everything you need to know about the neighborhood was spelled out.  I will definitely be back! "
619366,27870446,2015-03-14,1126242,Melissa,"I love staying here. It's the third or fourth time in as many years, and it is always so wonderful. Why? Innumerable reasons. Beautiful to look at the garden in the foreground, the lake in the background, and if the weather's good, the Olympic Mountains in the distance. Beautifully appointed apartment, comfortable; and warm, unobtrusive host. I feel welcome there, cozy, and at home. Parking is a plus. I really can't say enough good about Gillian's place and her kindness when we communicate. Thank you!"
619366,28188767,2015-03-19,29069811,Jordan,"I stayed at Gillian's place in Eastlake with a girlfriend Paige for two nights. We absolutely loved it. Really hassle-free, on an adorably weird private little street (residential alley? - Note: cabs couldn't find it the first night which was a bit of a struggle), so homey and perfectly well stocked. The neighbourhood was incredible for morning wanders, coffee and breakfast before heading into other parts of Seattle. I would definitely recommend staying in this location!"
619366,28406941,2015-03-23,28168919,Ashley,"The place was amazing, it was clean and spacious with a beautiful view. The description was accurate. We felt very welcome there. Would stay again."
619366,28626625,2015-03-27,29518828,Katy,We would stay at Gillian's place again in a heartbeat. It's so convenient to get anywhere in the city and the Eastlake area has so much to offer. Loved the cozy spaces and killer views. A quiet retreat for our stay in Seattle. So much better than a hotel stay!
619366,28784018,2015-03-30,26430674,Courtney,"Immediately Gillian made us feel welcome by allowing us to drop our bags off a few hours before our check in time. When we dropped our bags Gillian introduced herself and let us take a look around. This apartment is gorgeous, impeccably clean, and so cozy. You can't beat the views or the picture perfect neighborhood. We had a lovely experience here, and on our next trip to Seattle next year we hope to stay here again! Thanks so much, Gillian! "
619366,29178054,2015-04-05,27256188,Jessica,"This place is super. An amazing view from every room and a perfect location for getting to downtown and the university campus. There's loads of useful info about Seattle in the flat, as well as tips for the local neighborhood. Gillian always responded super quick to any queries and gave really detailed info on getting to the property making it straightforward. I'll definitely be stopping here if I ever visit Seattle again!"
619366,29516285,2015-04-08,29284498,Xinsheng,"This is an excellent experience. You could find anything you want in Gillian's house. The room is very clean and comfortable, just like home. We love it. Also, Gillian and Barbara are very very nice, kindly allowing us to deposit our luggages after checkout. In the morning, you could walk around to enjoy amazing lake view. Everything is so great. We definitely would choose to stay here when we visit Seattle next time:)"
619366,29745775,2015-04-12,28575473,Laura,"There are so many wonderful things to say about this apartment. It is a lovely space-nicely decorated, spotless throughout and very comfortable. We had everything we needed. The view is stunning across Lake Union to the Olympic mounatins. The garden was colorful and inviting and we would have enjoyed more time to sit on the patio and relax. Gillian was great to work with. We will definitely stay again. "
619366,29972025,2015-04-15,24844734,Michelle,"Gillian was very friendly and quickly responded to all of the emails and texts that we had.  The description of the room and views are very accurate to the posting and the pictures are just what you'd expect.  A very cute little apartment.  It was a ton of fun to see all of the sea planes land and take off from the porch.  Gillian had a lot of brochures and information about Seattle, so it was a breeze to get around a new town. Walking distance to markets and restaurants, but it was raining for most of our trip, so we drove.  Directions to the apartment were easy to follow and very descriptive.  I would come here again for sure!"
619366,30380793,2015-04-21,12133182,Lisa,"We have had some truly wonderful experiences with our Airbnb world stays, and this one, our four night retreat at ""Lake Union Garden Apartment"" in Seattle, may just be the best yet, which is saying a lot.  My husband and I booked this one-bedroom apartment in Eastlake based on the great reviews, the photos, and the ""thumbs-up"" from our daughter who lives nearby in her houseboat.  We enjoyed going back and forth between ""our"" place and hers,  relaxing, and then having a quiet and restful place to sleep each night.

We were mostly out and about in the city and at the houseboat, and each time it was such a pleasure to be able to return to our cozy, beautifully maintained airbnb apartment in this lovely neighborhood. Gillian mentioned that we might hear some piano playing.   We were looking forward to this, and on our last evening we did hear the soft, sweet strains of a sonata coming from upstairs.  As we were leaving, we met the pianist, Barbara, and got to tell her what a pleasure it had been to listen.

A quote from our daughter: ""Amazingly well-stocked, spacious, comfortable space with a beautiful view of the lake and a lovingly tended garden and patio."""
619366,30678678,2015-04-26,21784039,Darlene,"Gillian's apartment and location is exceptional. 
While everything one would want is within .25- 1 mile (shops/restaurants, grocery store) by foot, we 
 used public transportation to get downtown every day. 
The setting is charming and everything about the apartment exceeded our expectations. 
Apartment very welcoming and interior thoughtful and very well kept.
Lots of light and great view of the lake.
Spotless-clean
The most comfortable bed and softest cotton sheets you can imagine!!
Layout of apartment is brilliant -- feels very open with lots of windows.
A lovely, lovely garden is directly out side the glass doors from the bedroom.
Gillian has thought of every detail!
The host was accessible and helpful in answering any questions I had about my trip to Seattle.
 
"
619366,30958211,2015-04-29,31479778,Jennifer,"This was my first time using airbnb and what a great experience. This was the most perfect little studio I can imagine set in a beautiful location. Gillian and her mother Barbara have made this studio as close to a home as possible. It is decorated beautifully and Gillian has provided so many extras to make your stay pleasant- shampoo and conditioner, hair dryer and diffuser, plenty of extra blankets, a full kitchen including coffee grinder, and even some cereal choices. She has put together a basket of maps and tourist and restaurant info and has several books of things to do. There are umbrellas and shopping bags on hand and just about anything else you can think of. Gillian responded immediately to all of my inquiries and made check in/out a breeze. She introduced herself after we arrived but then left us to ourselves. Her mother Barbara was so sweet when we saw her working in the yard a few times. The view from the studio is gorgeous and it was fun to watch the pontoon planes in the lake. The area is perfect for walking and running and is centrally located. 

Parking can be a little tricky- you can unload at the studio but then must park in nearby streets. We only had trouble finding a spot 1 time, and even then only had to walk 2 short blocks. This was definitely not a problem for us but just something to be aware of. There is a short flight of fairly steep outdoor steps down to the studio- again not a problem at all for us but it might be difficult for anyone with a disability so just something to be aware of. 

The price is amazing- the place was immaculately clean and much nicer than any hotel we could have found. We would definitely stay here again!!"
619366,31178503,2015-05-03,28375749,Michael,"We loved our stay at Gillian's place.  The views are stunning.  You can see the lake from every room.  She has thought of everything, from info about the area to toiletries and kitchen supplies.  There are so many little areas to hang out or work in.  It made us feel at home right away and we didn't want to leave.  We'll definitely be back."
619366,31701373,2015-05-09,3607826,Doug,We really enjoyed staying in Gillian's roomy apartment for 4 nights. She has decorated it appropriately in a travel theme. We had no problems with getting there or using the nearby local bus system to get downtown. If you are a senior the bus fare is only one dollar. Highly recommended.
619366,31984463,2015-05-12,946214,Shannon,"This is one of the best places I have ever stayed. Gillian has the whole AirBnb experience down to an art form. From the garden to the delicious coffee waiting for you in the kitchen, she adds a lot of personal touches. She immediately makes you feel welcomed when you arrive and the apartment is very cozy. The view and the neighborhood are unbelievable. My partner and I are moving to Seattle in a couple weeks and we will definitely be sending people to stay here in the future. "
619366,32069476,2015-05-13,31210753,Jack,"We really enjoyed our stay. The accommodations, location, and Gillian were awesome. We would definitely stay here again in the future. "
619366,32495739,2015-05-19,5799447,Pat,"The unit, view, and location were exactly as described, and could not have been nicer!  The Garden Apt was so very nicely appointed; charming, and with lots of small touches that make for a very pleasant experience.  Gillian goes the extra mile for guest comfort!  If you like a pleasant walk around the lake, try the Chehsiahud Lake Union Loop (a map is in the basket of info.)  Seattle has some wonderful neighborhoods, and this is one of them!"
619366,32816686,2015-05-22,7186837,Katie,"I stayed in this apartment for 2 nights in May and I thought it was wonderful! I have stayed in a handful of airbnb places to date and honestly in terms of how it is furnished and equipped and the beautiful view from the terrace, it would rate as my best.  The apartment has everything you could possibly want and more - the décor etc is charming, it was plenty big enough and the kitchen was really well equipped, from simple touches like cereal I could help myself to, to a range of oils/seasonings/condiments etc which meant that I could easily make the most of cooking the special provisions I'd bought at Pike Place Market.   I really enjoyed my stay here and found the instructions and recommendations well set out.  I didn't have a car but there is a bus stop really close by; however, I enjoyed walking around a lot as it's a quiet neighbourhood and the streetcar is not too far away.  Thoroughly recommended.  Especially for sitting outside on the terrace with a glass of wine watching the sun set over the lake!"
619366,33069504,2015-05-25,20785706,Joshua,"The Garden Apartment was exactly what we wanted for our weekend away in Seattle.  It is plenty big enough and provides anyone with all the amenities a couple would need.  Gillian's has created a very warming experience in East Lake that easily exceeds any hotel experience.  The location is ideal to be 9 minutes away from most things downtown.  The neighborhood is very quiet and you can walk to great restaurants, an amazing coffee shop, and a tremendous beer/sandwich bar.  We will be back with some friends and rent both units."
619366,33533608,2015-05-29,16479498,Chrystal,Very clean place in an excellent location. Good views of the lake.
619366,33767625,2015-06-01,26252363,Alice,"
We felt very welcome, like family. Besides all the useful items, her studio is furnished artfully and comfortably, a home away from home. We loved the view of the garden and the waterfront. We would have enjoyed staying a lot longer there."
619366,34276336,2015-06-07,5878921,Marilyn,"The apartment was absolutely wonderful! We were so comfortable and Gillian provided so many helpful notes and recommendations. Everything was so clean and organized and we really felt at home. We used her restaurant guide multiple times and were never disappointed. The apartment has the most amazing view of the lake outdoors as well as indoors. We could not have been happier with our stay. If we make it back to Seattle, we hope this location is available. It was perfect!"
619366,34653478,2015-06-10,33606591,Eric,Gillian made us feel very welcome.   The  detailed instructions were very helpful.   The apartment was very clean and located in a quaint area.   I would recommend this to anyone. 
619366,34849770,2015-06-13,27634938,Ilyoung,"The apartment is absolutely amazing.
My friend and I were very happy and comfortable. Garden view was great and restaurents that Gillian informed were very satisfied. In the house there were many useful things including towels.
If I visit Seattle later, I want to stay this apartment again."
619366,35377740,2015-06-18,21822971,Zhang,非常棒的体验，房间非常干净，温馨。房东人超级好！很开心
619366,35552915,2015-06-20,10334877,Menno,"The place was comfy and on a great location. 
Nice lake view, fast internet, rented out by lovely people and all for a great price. Triple A"
619366,35910806,2015-06-23,9105951,Colleen,"Fantastic Airbnb stay! Everything was as advertised and just about anything you would need is there from a nicely equipped kitchen, to nice bathroom towels and toiletries, fleece throws to make you cozy on a cool evening, tissues by the bed, luggage racks, a walk-in closet with hangers, comfy bed and furnishings, nice lighting and very clean!  And of course there is the beautiful view of Lake Union, boats, floatplanes taking off and landing, peaceful garden, a nice patio, table and chairs, convenient to the bus line to downtown, restaurants, coffee and the university.  Really could not have asked for much more!"
619366,36769188,2015-07-01,6213362,Zachary,Our stay was great! Very nice and very clean apartment with a great view. Would stay here again. 
619366,37290237,2015-07-06,28936356,Christine,"WOW!!! Gillian's place was the first airbnb experience my boyfriend and I dared to venter out to.  Our time in Seattle was amazing and Gillian had a huge hand in making it happen.  If you are looking for a great get away that is a short 5min car ride/10min bus ride to anything you could possibly see, eat or experience, then this relaxing place is what you are looking for.
Although we did not get to meet Gillian in person, she was easy to contact 24/7! She was even accommodating and offered an early check in time so we could explore Seattle sooner.  The provided coffee, towels, toiletries and Netflix were appreciated. The comfy bed has a gorgeous view of Lake Union. 
Not only did we get a great view of the Lake, but we experienced the BEST Firework display from the backyard.  With parking being scarce on the July 4th weekend, it was nice to share our view with friends in the area who we were visiting.  A free private entrance to the lake is right down the road as well.  
Thank you Gillian for being so considerate and helpful.  Hopefully we will meet you the next time we book with you in Seattle!
-Christine & Thomas"
619366,37563594,2015-07-08,32713656,C.J.,"Beautiful view. Quiet neighborhood. Found parking just a quick walk away. Comfortable bed. Wonderful little touches --coffee, extra blankets, ear plugs, etc. Will recommend to friends and would stay here again!"
619366,37844935,2015-07-11,404458,Rachel,"We loved staying at this adorable apartment right by the lake! Exploring this quiet neighborhood's great restaurants and eclectic homes was a real treat, but it was still very close to the heart of Downtown! The apartment was very roomy and comfortable-we enjoyed staying in watching Netflix (provided!) just as much as exploring the city. I would heartily recommend staying here, and hope to have the opportunity to return very soon!"
619366,38255213,2015-07-14,29366229,Sarah,"Gillian provided us with a very comfortable and spacious flat. Everything we needed was there, including some thoughtful touches, such as cold beers and coffee.  The location is no problem, as it is very near bus routes into the centre of Seattle. Gillian gave us very helpful tips about local restaurants and shops. Parking was easy, just around the corner. It is in a quiet neighbourhood, which suited us fine. We had to catch a ferry to Bainbridge Island, and we got to the ferry terminal very quickly, despite the challenges posed by major road works in Seattle.  Thank you, Gillian, for ensuring we had a very relaxing place to return to after very busy days in Seattle. "
619366,38823831,2015-07-19,4225957,Joe,"Gillian's place in the Eastlake neighborhood in Seattle was a great place to spend a few days while visiting the area for a wedding. Her home was cozy, comfortable, and full of charming home-away-from-home details like a beautiful wooden writing desk and ornate door hinges. With a separate bedroom, living room, and kitchen, it felt spacious and welcoming. While we never met Gillian in person, her communications with us through Airbnb were detailed and informative. The space was filled with helpful information on local attractions, schedules for public transportation, and parking nearby. And the view of the sun setting behind Gas Works Park with boats passing by on the lake was a very relaxing thing to come home to after a day of exploring the city."
619366,39268252,2015-07-22,11872258,Glenn,"We enjoyed our three night stay at Gillian's charming apartment. It was roomy with a nicely appointed kitchen. The bed was super comfy. We liked the view over the small garden to Lake Union. The apartment was super clean. There was a lot of travel information available. We felt very much at home, and it was a comfortable and welcoming place to return to after a day of sightseeing. 

We arrived in Seattle at 9 pm, and at the apartment after 10. Gillian had given us great directions and instructions about where to park. You do need to go down outside stairs to reach the entry door, but this is all clearly explained in the description. Gillian responded promptly to all our questions. 

We had breakfast each morning at Louisa's, a cafe about 3 blocks away, and it was delicious. 

This is a delightful place to stay!"
619366,39737323,2015-07-26,30119495,Joedy,"This apartment was a terrific find!  The host thought of everything - we had all the comforts of home.  Great location, quiet street, plenty of room, clean and comfortable, and explicit instructions that made parking easy.  "
619366,40427310,2015-07-31,29957740,Arnold,"My wife and I loved the nice apartment near Lake Union, not only because it was near our son who we were visiting, but also because of the apartment and how great it was.  The pictures and description on AirBnB were very accurate and the real thing was even better in person.  Roomy apartment, comfortable bed, with all kinds of thoughtful details arranged by Gillian.  She had left everything I could have thought of, from linens and towels to small appliances, to tissue boxes throughout - even earplugs if needed!  Clean and a beautiful little place with an overlook of Lake Union while sitting and eating breakfast.  The location was very near Seattle Center and a ton of activities.  Our stay could not have been better.
We will certainly be returning on our next visit."
619366,40714580,2015-08-02,29475871,Anna,"Our stay at Gillian and Barbara's was amazing!! I ended up booking the Garden Apartment for me and my now ""Husband!!!"" and booked the sky view apartment for my mother and family for my August 1,st Wedding.  Our stay was perfect!!  It was so nice to wake up and walk to our wedding venue and walk right back up after the wedding.  So relaxing and stress free.  The view was amazing and inside the home was so comfy.  We are looking forward to our next stay there!  "
619366,41199993,2015-08-05,29170461,Susan,"We didn't get to meet Gillian but she was a great host. She was very friendly in our online communications. She checked in with us a week before we arrived and while we were there to see if we needed anything. The apartment is cozy, clean and spacious. The view of the lake is awesome! The bus stop is only a few blocks away that takes you into downtown Seattle. There were a lot of restaurants and coffee shops in the area as well. I would definitely stay here again."
619366,41922064,2015-08-10,17888964,Laurent,"Logement parfait, veritable cocon de sérénité et de calme absolu aux portes de Seattle. Logement bien agencé et fait avec gout. Petits mots d'accueil et explicatifs sur les protocoles du logement, terrasse tres agreable et vue parfaite. La rose en arrivant est un joli bienvenue. Si nous devons revenir à Seattle nous y retournerons. "
619366,42274776,2015-08-12,35829738,Janice,"This garden apartment was ideal for our stay - beautiful surrounding area, and easy access to transportation & restaurants. The sunsets over Lake Union were unforgettable!

 The hosts did a lovely job of providing all the things we needed, and the apartment gave us the perfect place to relax in between excursions. The apartment is spotless and well-equipped. I greatly appreciated having coffee, toiletries and lots of information on all things Seattle.  I hope to come back."
619366,42525098,2015-08-14,12060821,Anthony,"Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. You get ALOT of space for your money. Bedroom, living room, kitchen, bathroom, outdoor sitting area with garden...all of it furnished with pretty much everything you'll need for your stay. We never met the hosts in person, but they clearly care about delivering an amazing experience. The neighborhood is quiet but just close enough to downtown (and everyplace else). Parking wasn't an issue. The view is great. Basically, you'll wish you lived there. The only bad thing about the place is that at some point, you'll have to leave and go back home.  Just book it. You won't regret it. "
619366,43032946,2015-08-17,28178715,Stefan,"We had a wonderful time in seattle. The apartment was Quote perfect: clean, got everything you need, welcoming... make you feel like home. The little terrace is perfect for breakfast and has a wonderful view.
We didn't get to meet Gillian but she was a great host. The online communication before and during our stay was excellent.
The bus stop is only a few blocks away to take you to downtown.
The neighbourhood was peaceful and our stay was very relaxing and stress free.
We highly recommend."

619366,45183343,2015-08-31,42082573,Jenna,Gillian was so helpful. We arrived to a super clean and comfortable place.  She had everything you could imagine needing and more.  We felt super comfortable and the view was great! Parking was a breeze. It is located in a great neighborhood and was pretty central to  major tourist attractions. We highly recommend staying here!!!! 
619366,45467837,2015-09-03,6531294,Gail,"We loved our stay in this wonderfully appointed apartment! Gillian has thought of - and provided - everything you could need for a comfortable stay. The location is great, with easy access to bus routes and to nice places for a meal. There's no reason to stay anywhere else. "
619366,45930815,2015-09-07,2205629,Jenny,"Gillian was a wonderful host, and this Lake Union apartment is absolutely perfect. My husband and I stayed there for three days, and we enjoyed breakfast on the patio with Lake Union views (and incredible views of the Gas Works park). The apartment had everything we could possibly need and was very comfortable. 

Location is so central, and parking was very available nearby (we visited on a holiday weekend). 

Gillian was helpful, responsive, and went well out of her way to make us feel welcome (and ship us an item we left there!). 

Highly recommend this apartment. "
619366,46464936,2015-09-11,3576014,Jessica,"Gillian's apartment is such a beautiful place! We spent four nights here and really felt like we were living here. Everything has been decorated like in a real home: you are relaxing on the couch, watching TV and need a tissue? Tissue box is right there..."
619366,47997322,2015-09-22,19899041,Tom,"A fantastic ground floor apartment with views that the photos don't do justice, it really is lovely. 

Huge bedroom and excellent living quarters for cooking and relaxing. You really won't want for anything. 

Gillian was very communicative and provided everything you would need for a very comfortable stay. The place is really easy to get to from the I5 and then get into town on the bus so close by. 
One of the best places we've ever stayed. Thank you so much. "
619366,48413596,2015-09-26,15202199,Poonam,"Excellent stay! Neat and Clean. Although I did not meet Gillian personally, she was very helpful. Organized and detailed, just the way I like it.

619366,49636078,2015-10-05,28416418,Galen,"Gillian's place was perfect. The neighborhood is close to downtown, the u district and capitol hill without being as busy as any of them. The house is only a few blocks from the lake, though with the view from inside and the little patio area, you don't really have to walk anywhere. Inside the house is spacious, full of beautiful art, tidy, and had everything we needed. If I get to come back to Seattle, this will be the first place I look. "
619366,50321785,2015-10-11,23772733,G,"Gillian was an amazing host, although we did not get a chance to meet her, her listing was very accurate, actually better in person.
She had maps, lists of restaurants . She had a note  welcoming us. I can't give her property enough praise. Coffee , purified water, very clean unit, very comfortable bed.
Great view of gas works, perfect neighborhood. I will definitely stay at her place again . My wife was very happy! 
Gillian was very responsive to all emails and extremely accommodating, Thanks Gillian!"
619366,51153251,2015-10-18,38624050,William,"My girlfriend and I stayed at here for a few days and we loved the place.  The view of the Union Lake was amazing!  Gillian provided all you could possibly need, even bus routes, Seattle travelers magazines, and an umbrella to name a few.  She also had these little messages posted around the apartment that provided useful information.  We had a great time and the stay here is definitely worth it.   I would recommend it to anyone."
619366,52097354,2015-10-26,20072909,Daniel,"I had to cancel my stay, but Gillian followed the rules of Airbnb and promptly refunded me my cleaning fee.  Wish we could've stayed!  Next time!"

5781547,31664028,2015-05-08,31337881,Harish,Kat is a great host and the house is as described and more. Amazing views of the mountains. We held our small company's retreat in this house and everyone was pleased. The chefs kitchen is particularly good for team cooked meals. We grilled out one night too. There are a variety of small touches throughout the house that mad everyone feel at home. The house sits on a hill which affords it magnificent views on a clear day. Kat is an incredibly responsive and gracious host. If you're looking for a place to stay in the neighborhood I could not recommend it more. This was our first airbnb experience and I'm very happy. 
5781547,33120577,2015-05-25,3707842,Joanne,"We had a wonderful stay at Kat's home.  The location is perfect.  The house is nice, and great for entertaining.  Love the kitchen!  Kat was attentive, and quick to respond to questions."
5781547,34558403,2015-06-09,22205832,Jennifer,We had a wonderful stay! Everything was really clean and nicely decorated and the views were amazing! We arrived in the middle of a Seattle heat wave and weren't expecting temperatures in the 80s. Kat went out of her way to make sure that we were comfortable - she brought us three brand new fans to cool the house. I would definitely recommend the house and the location.
5781547,35787179,2015-06-22,2504776,Samuel,"The house was great, Kat was an amazing host, and the neighborhood was vibrant and close to major transportation arteries. We had a wonderful time."
5781547,36385193,2015-06-28,23107999,Nancy,"We loved our visit to Seattle and our Airbnb experience!  Kat was so responsive, it was great that she got back to me very quickly with thorough answers to all  my questions--even before I had them.  The house was beautiful, very comfortable with spectacular sunsets.  We loved the chef's kitchen and hosted a small brunch with no difficulties.  The stairs were a little steep for my mother-in-law, but she is 87.  The location was very convenient--close to both Safeway  and Trader Joe's.  We would recommend the RockCreek Restaurant not far from the house.   We had no trouble getting to any Seattle location from this great house.  The beds were comfortable, everything was very clean, and all amenities were available.  Kat made our stay very comfortable and easy.  "
5781547,37145349,2015-07-05,30555810,George,"Kat was very helpful when we first moved in.  There was a heat wave in Seattle and the house was uncomfortable.  Also, the TV system was not easily used.  I called her and she was an hour away but dropped everything and came over.  She got the TV working properly and also brought a portable air conditioner the next day.  It worked well and it was a great help.  There was a problem with the freezer not making ice so she brought over bags of ice for our use.  The house was in a decent neighborhood, on a hill with a nice view.  Some of the doors were a challenge.  It is an older house.  The kitchen was good and had been redone recently.  The basement was cooler but rough and somewhat dank.  The bathrooms were good.  There were plenty of linens and towels and an excellent washer and dryer.  There is a pleasant porch sitting area.  The wi-fi worked well."
5781547,38109476,2015-07-13,9641026,Shawn,"Great place, nice kitchen with enough space for 6 adults and 2 kids!  Parking was a bit tough for two cars and the road noise was a bit loud since we had to open the windows due to the unusual warm weather, but otherwise, really comfortable place to stay!  Oh, Safeway is just a few minutes away."
5781547,38837369,2015-07-19,32636120,Rob,Very nice welcoming instructions and directions to the house. Clean and presentable lodging. 
5781547,39741718,2015-07-26,9658861,Xiaohua,"I really enjoy the life here base on these reasons.First,the house is very tidy and have all the things we need.Second, beds are very comfortable and soft so that we have a good sleep.Third, the equipments are very compete.  Besides, host answers our questions patiently and helps us a lot.All in all, we have a good time here!Thank you very much!"
5781547,40721894,2015-08-02,29185027,Cheryl,"The house was ready when  we arrived in Seattle, Kat sent an e-mail letting me know."
5781547,41927149,2015-08-10,11461185,Christina,"Kat's home is even more beautiful in person. My family had a hard time saying goodbye. No detail was left untouched whether it was the decor, the comfy beds, the beautiful living space, or spacious bathrooms. 

It's conveniently located between trendy, safe and walkable neighborhoods of Ballard, Fremont, and Phinney. We took drove most places but could easily take public transit if we wanted to. The views are spectacular and for the price it's the best deal in town. 

I would highly recommend staying with Kat again and wish we had another reason to get back to Seattle sometime soon. "
5781547,42543779,2015-08-14,9882057,Margret,"We absolutely loved this beautiful home.  We stayed there for four days in August while having a family gathering in Seattle.  It was charming, comfortable, extremely clean and very home-y.    The large chef's kitchen was to die for - we had so much fun preparing some very delicious meals in it.  The view from the front deck was fabulous as well.  We had all our meals and enjoyed some wonderful conversations over bottles and bottles wine on that deck.  Kat, our host, was very helpful and sweet (but non-invasive).  She even sent us a message suggesting that we check out some shooting stars happening one evening.  We did and it was very cool!  It was awesome to have her as a resource.   The location was a really good central base from which to explore the area and it was a relief not having to deal with the downtown Seattle gridlock traffic.  The only small negative was the street behind the home was a bit noisey.  This was not an issue for my husband and I as we live in the city.  My inlaws, however,  are country people so they found it a bit loud for them during the rush hour times.  The house is just as described.  The host is excellent.  You can rent with confidence.  "
5781547,43223668,2015-08-18,24125269,Mark,"The house was great, and Kat was very helpful and attentive."
5781547,44100165,2015-08-24,7533471,Cindy,"Our family stayed at Kat's lovely home when we were in Seattle for a family wedding.  The house was great, exactly as described.  We hosted  the rehearsal dinner there, cooking for 25 people in the well equipped kitchen.  
Comfy beds, impeccably clean, convenient location.  
We had a fabulous time!  We will definitely stay here again."
5781547,46881076,2015-09-14,24156179,Molly,"Kat did a great job of making us feel at home!  The place was clean and the beds were made.  Kat's place is in a perfect location with fantastic views!  In the evenings, we loved to sit on the back porch and stare at the mountains.

We can't wait to go back!"
5781547,48848479,2015-09-28,37839761,Amy,The host was great and allowed us to check in early! Very accommodating and easy to work with. The house was wonderful and in a great location - close to Ballard and Fremont. 
5781547,51338586,2015-10-19,44961499,Anneliese,"My husband, 3 children and I loved the time we spent at Kat's house.  The neighborhood is full of character and yet the house is totally updated and tastefully decorated.  At Kat's suggestion, we loved walking down to Slate Coffee Shop and actually did every morning we were there.  Everything was available - great towels, nice linens, a gorgeous, well-appointed kitchen, the best washer and dryer you could imagine....The view is spectacular too and the gardens are beautiful.  I especially loved the Lavender in the front yard.  Easy distance to Safeway, great Chinese, etc. Downtown areas of Ballard and Fremont are a little farther - but great restaurants there also.  Also easy distance to down town Seattle.  I highly recommend this as a place to stay with a family.    Only slight negative is the road noise on the back of the house and the lack of a TV on the main living level.  I would absolutely stay there again.  "
5781547,55094459,2015-11-28,31333183,Johnna,I rented this home while in Seattle visiting family during Thanksgiving.  Kat was always available and very flexible.  The house is located in a nice neighborhood and easily walkable.  Kat stocked the house with the usual necessities as well as two bottles of yummy wine and great breakfast cereals. The house was comfortable with a great view.  The kitchen was amazing for cooking Thanksgiving dinner and the beds were comfortable.  The only down side for me was the small TV Kat installed for us in the living room was just that- small and not great for family football viewing.  I really do consider the TV a small thing.  I would recomend this house.
5781547,57874045,2015-12-30,9195865,Jeanne,"Kat's home is beautiful!  Very clean, comfortable & spacious.  It has wonderful views of the Olympic Mountains!!  She even had a beautiful Christmas tree for our Holiday week!!  We had a fabulous time in Kat's amazing home.  It's also close to shopping and dining.  I highly recommend!  Thanks Kat!  Happy New Year,  Jeanne

7389483,46773697,2015-09-13,39963087,Kim,"Great apartment, really close to pike/pine st and the downtown area. Would definitely recommend. "
815017,3022739,2012-12-03,1322263,Anthony,"Great host: Mia was warm and gracious, inviting me to spend time in the common areas, using the kitchen as I wished, chatting with her and her delightful daughter, and watching the playful cats. The location on Beacon Hill is good with several restaurants within a few blocks. At Bar Del Corso, check out their pizza margherita and their pear ginger cocktail. While you're on the hill, enjoy the large, newly reconstructed park nearby--whether you have kids or not, it's worth visiting for the city views and the vibrant community.

(Sidenote: I'm reasonably confident that the cats don't go downstairs, which is where my room was. But I took Loratadine anyway and had no problem with my allergies.)"
815017,3087993,2012-12-14,4218984,Matthew,"Mia and her daughters are super friendly and welcoming and I enjoyed chatting with them.  Sadly, my stay was super short, but the room was very nice and comfortable with a lovely view.  The neighborhood seemed nice also; although I didn't get to explore it much.  Super close to the light rail though."
815017,3099500,2012-12-16,4239309,Willem,"The first bed was a bit small so she transfered me to the king size.
Slept like a baby and was fresh in the morning.
Mia is a wonderful woman with a big heart."
815017,3963384,2013-03-31,5303789,Leam,"Mia, her daughters and the people who came and went to and from the house during my stay were all extremely friendly.

I arrived during the evening of a graduation party, so I may have been in the way upon arrival and they still made me feel welcome. However, at that point I mostly needed to sleep, which is handy because they have a really comfortable bed which overlooks the distant Bellevue.

I would definitely be getting in touch if I am going back to Seattle."
815017,4512498,2013-05-09,5626058,Nick,We arrived on a very warm afternoon. Before we knew that it was exactly what we needed Mia had supplied us with a plate of delicious watermelon! The room is so beautiful - a magnificent view and the world's most comfortable bed. Easy access to Downtown via bus or light rail. Some good cafes and a taco van nearby. Mia was a delight - so helpful and accommodating. A very lovely household. 
815017,4639484,2013-05-17,1875365,Ryan,"This has been my best airbnb experience yet! Mia, her daughters, and her cats were wonderful hosts. I had an absolutely blast.

North Beacon Hill is the perfect neighborhood if you're visiting. It is quiet but also a short rail ride away from downtown Seattle.

I had a great time and highly recommend them. "
815017,4944009,2013-06-03,1275276,Yaeko,"Mia is super friendly and I enjoyed staying at her place with her daughters and cats. Beacon Hill is close to downtown Seattle, especially to International District and you can take bus very easily. Also the view from the room was simply beautiful. I wish I could more time to spend time and talk with Mia, but I was very busy and lots of things to do during the short stay. Still, she was very kind and we had great time to chat. THANK YOU, MIA!!"
815017,5089425,2013-06-11,5887724,Amanda,"Mia and her family are friendly and welcoming hosts, always willing to to share coffee and conversation. I loved waking up in the morning, there was a great view of the sunrise through the large windows in the room.  I had a great time staying here and would definitely recommend it for creative artsy people."

I felt welcomed from the first moment I walked in. Mia is super nice, fun, interesting, well rounded and very easy going. The room has access to a super nice patio. The house is located in a very nice area accessible by bus or light rail. I recommend Mia's place to anyone who is going to Seattle and I would definitely stay there again."

815017,5390397,2013-06-27,6995907,Cristina,"Staying with Mia, her daughter and 4 cats was absolutely wonderful! The home is in a convenient location, close to public transport (buses/lightrail). I really enjoyed my stay here- she wasn't kidding about the beautiful view from the balcony! Had I more time in Seattle, I would have stayed out there writing for hours!

Mia and I had a few great conversations and I found her a kindred, artistic, free spirit. In short, she's awesome and I wish I had more time to talk to her. I felt very comfortable in the home- which has some pretty chill/artistic vibes to it. The cats were also a plus for me, since I love animals. The next time I visit Seattle, I'll definitely be looking Mia up either to stay with or just grab a cup of coffee.

I really recommend Mia's home to those who are chill, open to the sun room set up (which I LOVED!) and aren't high maintenance (she's into conservation of water and energy, and I agree with that philosophy). So, basically, go stay with Mia! :-)"
815017,5502170,2013-07-02,7130314,Justine,"We spent 4 days in Mia's home. It was our first experience with Airbnb, and it was a very nice experience ! Mia is a great host, very friendly, open-minded, fun and interesting. We don't speak very well english, but we had a lot of chatering with she and her daughter. The bedroom was really beautiful with a nice view. We were happy to finish our trip by meeting this family.
Thanks very much Mia for your hospitality ! And maybe see you one day ! ;)"
815017,5755501,2013-07-15,5896164,Celine,"Mia was a very cordial and likable host. We really enjoyed our stay at her home. There was really much going on, what we liked. Her two daughters are amazing. Our room and the bathroom we could used were very clean and cute. The kitchen and the dishes were a bit dirty and there was a bit of a disorder. 
Anyways i would really recommend Mia's place, we had a wonderful time."
815017,6349005,2013-08-09,6918709,Nicholas,"Mia was a wonderful host! She was great to talk to, very accommodating, and had a very warm and welcoming home. Her house is located conveniently by many bus routes and Light Rail stations, and if you are into cats, hers are the sweetest I have ever met. I loved staying with Mia, I wish I had more time to really get to know her, maybe sit down and have a cup of coffee with her. I'd recommend her place to anyone who is travelling through Seattle! "
815017,6410355,2013-08-11,117230,Sean,Mia is an excellent host and I really enjoyed staying at her place. It's in a nice quiet neighborhood close to the freeway. Great view and one of the most comfortable beds you'll find.
815017,6429852,2013-08-12,1893167,Tempee,"Mia is a wonderful host and she has such a kind heart! Her house is beautiful and artistic, I am sure anyone will appreciate its beauty.Her daughter helped me to braid my hair for attending a wedding, which was very nice of her! Upon my arrival, we figured that the light rail wouldn't run as early as 4:00 a.m on Sunday and it seemed like taking a taxi was the only way for me to get to the airport on time (my flight was 6:00 a.m).Mia said she would drive me to the airport so that I didn't have to pay for a taxi or stressed out about it! I just can't thank her enough for all the help she offered! Thanks so much Mia!"
815017,6497995,2013-08-14,7884693,Kathleen,"Mia was very nice and the bed quite confortable but i cought fleas in this house!!!!! A real nightmare to get rid of that!!! I dońt know how it will happen but i still have them on me for 3 days ! So, now i warned you... It´s up to you"
815017,6509670,2013-08-15,6947250,Evan,Mia was a nice host. Her house was very welcoming and had a great view of the area above the bed. The pillows are definitely a plus and her cats were very warm and loving. I would recommend her as a host to anyone!
815017,6794231,2013-08-25,5553290,Zhe,"Good place to stay, it has all I expected, flexible check in time and nice host, cute cats and great balcony view!"
815017,6913341,2013-08-30,2402160,Yara,"Whatever you can see on pictures to Mia's place just gets so much better when you get there. The room that Mia is giving away for Airbnb people is definitely the best spot in the house and you will be stunned by the view and the room itself. Mia has a great taste to things and interior and her loveliest and easygoing personality just makes the whole stay feel like visiting an old friend. 

That was the last day of our West Coast trip and it just couldn't get any better. The house is very live, and the people that we met there were as nice as Mia herself, which really made it a true Airbnb experience. All of Mia's 4 (or 5?) cats have come over to our room one by one to greet us and they all seemed to be totally in the flow with the atmosphere in the house - chilled, loving and friendly.

Thank you for making our final day in Seattle so lovely, Mia! We hope we will see you again sometime in future.

Hugs from all 3 of us!"
815017,7115935,2013-09-07,2551584,Alix,Mia's place was incredible! Unfortunately she was helping her daughter move to university so we didn't get to meet her but she was great with communication and her housemates are so lovely and welcoming. Everything was laid out for us all ready and we felt wry comfortable at Mia's. the bed / back room is so comfortable and especially to sleep in on a rainy night! The light rail station is not far from her house and is very easy to get downtown and to the airport. They have some very friendly cats too :). Thanks Mia & housemates!!

815017,7491979,2013-09-22,8639715,Melissa,"Mia and her family were  wonderful hosts to us during our 4 day trip to Seattle. Location wise it was very easy to take the central link into the city, and the neighborhood itself was a nice break from those busy days in downtown. The accommodations were amazing, and we had a wonderful time playing with her cats, who were all friendly and very cute.  "
815017,7751708,2013-10-01,8645113,Xuzhi,"Mia is so nice and the room is perfect to me. I stayed in Seattle for 4 days and felt warm and cozy everytime I came back to Mia's home, although it was pouring and frezzing outside. It is also a heaven for who is carzy for cats. The white cat is the most sticky to people and I hug him for sleep everynight!:)"

815017,13228884,2014-05-22,15286084,Lorenzo,"Mia was a open, friendly and an altogether welcoming host. I quickly felt at home in her cozy-made bed and adorable white kitty (Whitey) to keep me company. The house was beautifully decorated throughout with eclectic, yet chic furniture & the room was very spacious with windows all around that let in a gorgeous morning glow. I am a student (new to the city) and Mia was very helpful with figuring out bus schedules and suggesting places to eat/visit. I hope to stay here again (:"

I couldn’t have asked for a better airbnb experience. If you are coming through Seattle, you must meet this amazing woman and stay at her stylish, fun place!

815017,13687063,2014-06-02,6376715,Erika,"Mia was a fantastic hostess. We immediately felt welcome in her home and the room was glorious. The view is spectacular, the bed is heavenly soft, and the room was private, clean, and spacious. Mia's cats and bunny provided great company. We would have love to stay longer and will be sure to reach out to Mia next time we are in town. She provided great customized advice on sights to see and community events to check out. Thank you Mia for being such a warm and welcoming hostess."

815017,14135074,2014-06-12,13424345,Andrew,"Was perfect for my just there to sleep stay. Beautiful morning view, access to back patio, and bed was super comfortable. The room had lots of charm. Mia was super nice and flexible with my late arrival. Warning if you are not a communal living or cat person don't stay here, but if you are use to that, like me, you'll love it. "

815017,14411385,2014-06-18,16397093,Michael,My son and I had a great experience on our vacation and Mia's house was a big part of that. The room was the perfect size for us and the view was beautiful. We did not get the best of weather while there but during nicer days you could spend hours on the back porch. If you have little ones there is a terrific park that's less than a 5 minute walk from her house. Great stay and worth every penny!
815017,14568643,2014-06-22,2624597,Katharine,"Mia's cozy home was perfect for my two-day stay in Seattle. The house is located on a cute street, and is a convenient bus ride away from Downtown. The room itself was warm and has large windows that let in a lot of natural light. Mia was very welcoming and accommodating (and so were her cats)!"
815017,14799612,2014-06-26,3860441,Chris,"Mia was super cool! Her home is beautiful, her pets are the friendliest animals ever, the view from her deck is awesome. She lives really close to the light rail line, so travel downtown was super easy. 10/10 the best!"

815017,15072205,2014-07-01,16108433,Ai Thi,Mia is lovely. She went out of her way twice to accommodate us when we had to cancel the day of our stay the first time. She was very understanding and super kind. I am very grateful to her trying to help us have a nice vacation.
815017,15216163,2014-07-05,14372333,Jared,Mia's place is probably the best place you can stay in Seattle. The room had a balcony with an amazing view. Mia was incredibly kind and very personable. Definitely gonna stay here again!
815017,15637385,2014-07-13,16643592,Alen,"It was a great time staying in Mia's house. Amazing view,what a scenery,wauu. She is really easy going person,full of energy. It was nice to wake up in the morning and see that beautiful view from a bed. You won't regret if you book with Mia,you will get more than you maybe expect. This was my first stay on airbnb and I couldn't imagine the better start. Thank you Mia :)"
815017,15728966,2014-07-14,13918655,Marie,"Mia was very friendly and her house was really beautiful. Lots of paintings and decor. I only stayed for one night, but enjoyed the view from the room. Mia's cats were very cute. "
815017,15771798,2014-07-15,16266343,John S,Mia's was homey and welcoming. The room we stayed in had an amazing view and with the weather being so prefect we slept with the windows and doors open which made the home feel like a beach house.  Mia's was our relaxing oasis that was around a $12 ride away from any of the main Seattle downtown attractions using Uber.  We didn't use the bus system but heard it was a easy to use as well. The pictures show the room exactly like it is but dont do justice to the amazing view. The cats were adorable.
815017,15838276,2014-07-16,8627738,Merle,"I only stayed for one short night at Mia's place but really enjoyed it. For once, the room and the whole house and the view upon Lake Washington is amazing! The house is also very close to the light rail station Beacon Hill, which helped me a a lot catching a very early train to the Airport the next morning. Everyone in the house is very quiet and respectful which I really liked. And also, Seattle in the summertime is an amazing place! Wish i'd have the time to go swimming in the lakes!"
815017,15891282,2014-07-17,17838402,Sarah,"Mia's room with the view was absolutely gorgeous! The short showers and saving on electricity were not a problem, and the cats didn't bother us as we are cat people (: and we ended up sharing our room with them! If you're big on privacy, this probably isn't the place for you, but it was excellent as a place to crash while traveling around. So unique and fun. The park nearby is wonderful and an excellent spot to watch the sunset!! It was perfect for our one night in Seattle. Beacon Hill is amazing."
815017,15976248,2014-07-19,87536,Sami & Melanie,We had a comfortable stay at Mia's and our son loved playing with her cats. Thanks Mia!
815017,16016626,2014-07-20,10642454,Kailen,"Mia made us feel very welcome and was respectful of our privacy. The best partS (yes, there are more than one!) of our stay was the view of Lake Washington and the bed. Both were heavenly and so perfect after traveling away from home. Although she asks that guests take short showers and save on electricity, it really was not a problem and again, she made us feel so welcome. It was a short stay, but I would definitely come again! Her cats and bunny rabbit (rabbit was in the front yard) were adorable but respected our privacy as well. :)"
815017,16357722,2014-07-26,12135668,Brett,"The description was accurate and the neighborhood was very nice and quiet. Lots of street parking, also close to Public Transit, Downtown, Capital Hill etc."
815017,16446471,2014-07-27,7446712,Alice,"Mia was wonderful to my father and me when we stayed with her. We had an odd schedule and she was extremely accomodating. Her house was so-so beautiful, smelling of lavender, full of friendly furry friends and a breathtaking view of seattle. We will definitely stay here again if we come back."
815017,16533792,2014-07-28,5864711,Olivier,"Beautiful house, amazing view, great welcome from mia, it was perfect! "
815017,16576925,2014-07-29,13665644,Lauren,"Mia made me feel completely at home, directing me to local yoga classes, and starting me off with homemade chai in the morning. Everyone in the house, including her other, longer term guest and daughter were wonderful company, and I wish that I could have stayed longer to get to know them further. The room itself was extremely comfortable, and perfect if you're a cat lover ;)"
815017,16622015,2014-07-30,4913233,Dasal,My friend and I stayed in Mia's room with the Eastern View (beautiful view of the mountains and a great place to watch the sun rise if you get up early enough). The space was perfect for two people and Mia was very flexible with check in and out time. The neighborhood is charming. There is also plenty of parking space on the street and it is a easy commute to the city. Mia's four cats are super friendly and she also has a cute pet bunny.   
815017,16831410,2014-08-03,7608364,Timothy,Mia's a very kind host. Her home is beautiful and the room has an awesome view of Lake Washington. We loved the cuddly cats!
815017,16931688,2014-08-04,11163716,Hannah,"The ad for Mia's space is accurate. She is welcoming, accommodating, helpful, and neat to talk to."
815017,17023850,2014-08-05,4668126,Linda,"Mia's is a lovely person and she made us feel very welcome. I was traveling with a very social and curious 11-year-old, whom she communicated with in a loving manner. The back deck was truly the highlight of our stay, and I highly recommend Mia's home over your standard hotel. "
815017,17293276,2014-08-10,17927678,Alison,"Mia's place was great! The room looked exactly like the pictures and the deck was such a peaceful place to unwind, have breakfast, and enjoy some sun. There's plenty of street parking in the neighborhood but if you want to use public transportation instead, there's easy access as well (5 blocks from the house). The neighborhood was really safe and charming and the view from the bed was incredible. The cats are super friendly and Mia was a great hostess. "
815017,17593392,2014-08-14,3373279,Philippa,"We had a very short overnight stay at Mia's house but it was perfect for our flying visit to Seattle. The room was beautifully decorated, cosy and so comfortable, it also felt very private. The view is amazing and it's so lovely to wake up and enjoy it without leaving the bed. Access to downtown Seattle is very easy via the light rail ($4 for an all day pass) and there are a few nice bars and restaurants just around the corner in Beacon Hill too.

Mia, her daughter and the cats were lovely hosts and we felt very relaxed sharing their home. We would definitely stay here again, a great Airbnb experience for us!"
815017,17812085,2014-08-17,14271270,Claudia,Thanks for this nice stay. Mia was a very pleasant host and we love the great view about the city. There you can have a wonderful breakfast in the  sun. Also very cute are the little rabbits. We would come back every time :)
815017,17855535,2014-08-18,14794547,Marisha,"Gorgeous view, charming home, and a welcoming host ! Staying at Mia's home was a treat. I would highly recommend her to anyone visiting Seattle !"
815017,18076987,2014-08-21,12670181,Jessica,"Mia's home was BEAUTIFUL!  The view and the room were actually better than described. The small room with an eastern view was in fact much more private than expected.  A door closes off to the sun room and a curtain can be closed to provide more privacy around the bed area. The bed was by far one of the most comfortable I've ever experienced overlooking an amazing deck and view of the city. Her cats were cuddly when around but quiet and out of sight for most of my stay. The other guest was polite and bathroom sharing was not an issue at all. If you can respect the simple house rules like the 5 minute shower rule then you will be set to enjoy this adorable house. Everything was as described. I only stayed one night but was happy to find such a clean, quiet and peaceful home to rest my head. Although we did not have much time to get to know each other, I found Mia to be very pleasant, accommodating, and essy to talk to. I will DEFINITELY be back to stay with Mia and highly recommend her lovely home to anyone traveling to Seattle."
815017,18312478,2014-08-25,17017775,Marcia,"Mia made me feel welcome - the front door was open (and that was possible for her to do ie., I wouldn't want my hostess to feel unsafe if that was not appropriate in the setting).
The listing description was accurate and the view is something she can use to such an advantage.  I imagine most people must come away with a sense of perspective.
The neighbourhood was seemed okay ie., it was quiet so I was not able to meet a lot of people who lived there but it seems to be able to offer this section of Seattle where you can get away from the busy areas and have some time for yourself.
"
815017,18738690,2014-08-31,19260977,Chris,My one night stay at Mia's place was fantastic. It was exactly what I needed. I found the 36 bus to be the most convenient transportation to and from the downtown area as the pickup and drop off is much closer to the house than the light rail station. I was unable to meet Mia but her daughter was very helpful. 
815017,18939605,2014-09-03,16389032,Melissa,"What a wonderful trip, made even better by my stay in this delightful little room. I spent half of my first day in Seattle dozing on my big plush bed with the door to the porch cracked open, letting the sounds and smells of a light afternoon rain drift into the quiet room. 
I did not get a chance to meet Mia until my last night in Seattle, though she was altogether very friendly and accommodating. 
The house was cool and a little bit funky. Being only 5 blocks from the lightrail made it easy to visit downtown, the waterfront, and Columbia City at virtually any time of the day or night. I felt safe in the neighborhood. I was also just a short walk from Jefferson Park, where I spent many hours reading and enjoying the cityscape.

Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience, and I was happy to have a safe and comfortable place to come back to after a long day of exploring the city. I definitely recommend this room!"
815017,19145378,2014-09-07,5840005,Matthew,"Charming home in a very characterful, peaceful neighbourhood. Great view from your bed and the balcony is a few strides away! Mia was very easy going and peaceful, matching the personality of her home. Great restuarants and pubs just down the street and easy enough to take the bus straight into downtown..simplemente recomendado!"
815017,19207210,2014-09-08,14558227,Anne,"Intriguing neighborhood, a lot of cultural and economic diversity. Gorgeous flowers, many with vegetables. Mia has an open door policy for humans and kitties alike. Mia and her daughter were eager to talk and help anyone. Very open minded, laid back folks. Artsy home, too. We slept with the backdoor open, so the cats slept on the bed with us. If you're there during a heatwave, be ready to be a little ... mmm..steamy during the day. The queen bed is very comfortable and there are great views all time of the day. We thank Mia and her family for their hospitality!!"
815017,19476180,2014-09-13,8636985,Jaclyn,"Mia was great and the house is beautiful! One of the cats even snuggled with us while we slept, it was a lovely experience!"
815017,19694587,2014-09-16,4756537,Jennifer,It was a pleasure to stay at Mia's house. She very helpful and the house was extremely beautiful. Expect the best view over the mountains. Beside that we got some helpful advices for our road trip along the west coast. We had a very nice time Portland. Thanks Mia!!!
815017,19751728,2014-09-17,8504054,Stephen,"Mia was very welcoming and made sure her daughter was there to initially let me in.  Both are very friendly and helpful about orienting a traveler to the area.  The Beacon Hill area is much like Portrero Hill in SF.  It is a nice area and bohemian at the same time--my kind of place.  Light rail is nearby, and there are a number of taverns and restaurants.  I was able to get to downtown easily and enjoyed the local fare."
815017,19947216,2014-09-21,15699035,龄萱,"My second Airbnb exprience in Mia's house was amazing!the best thing i love about mia's house is that when you wake up in the morning, there is a cute white and black cat sleeping next to you and sunshine go through the window and all over you!You have a moment that you feel like you really live in Seattle and become a part of this amazing city!and i like people who keep an open heart and have an optimistic attitude towards everything, Mia is the perfect explaination of that! Have a great time talking to Mia! I am definetely gonna stay at Mia's house again!!"
815017,20230707,2014-09-26,16211545,Beate,"Mia was really nice in greeting me at her house. The room is a sunroom, and as it has a great view and an awesome bed. Be aware that you walk through another room to get to this room with another person staying there. It was a bit chilly in the room but the blanket was really warm and nice. Mia has many cats that stay everywhere, so if you don't care for them you shouldn't book. As Mia was very busy professionally which might have been the reason for the kitchen being chaotic. I met the nicest people at Mia's place, it was a pleasure!"
815017,21297626,2014-10-14,923842,Erika,"What a perfect little corner of the world! We were looking for a cozy, peaceful and scenic location in Seattle, and this was just the thing. The bed was like a cloud, the view of the Cascades was majestic, and the location was very accessible to all points of interest. Mia was responsive and flexible when we arrived -- a delayed flight put us in Seattle relatively late, and she was warm and welcoming from the start. The kitties and cuddles were an added bonus :) Only piece to keep in mind is that several other folks share the home, so plan accordingly for showers! All-in-all, great weekend, and a great hostess. "
815017,21607727,2014-10-20,18289554,Chris,"really enjoyed my stay at Mia's place. Love her sense of art, and the two cats are fun to play with. Perfect sunrise view from my bed! and the other visitors are just as awesome to talk to. "
815017,22279007,2014-11-02,18136096,Pauline,"My time at Mia's home was very short, but I was very well welcomed. The room is very nice and the view is wonderful. I wish I could have the time to drink a cup of tea on the patio -- maybe next time!"
815017,28097094,2015-03-17,21679363,Hongcheng,"This is a pleasure place  staying like at home.Having a good lake view from room. The cats are very friendly to us,it is very nice to play with them.Mia is very beautiful and charming,who likes to provide as much information as she can."
815017,28229588,2015-03-20,8190287,Grace,"Mia was a very kind, helpful host. She made a point to check in with me frequently and make me feel welcome. The room and location were perfect!"
815017,28470406,2015-03-24,20088601,Halimah,"I visited Seattle for a meditation retreat. After a day's ""Work,"" Mia's house was the perfect place to settle in to.  Mia is warm, generous, and unique. She lives an artistic life and her space reflects it. 

The house is incredibly close to Central Link Light Rail. I commuted to the University District and was pleasantly surprised on how quick of a trip it was.

To top it off ~ I stayed in a room that welcomed in the sunrise every morning. Feel very fortunate to have stayed here and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good soulful place."
815017,28751467,2015-03-29,29416228,Yang,"My experience staying at Mia's home was amazing.Mia is a very kind,helpful host, she gave me a lot of information about the city,the room has a very good lake view. 
Also, the location is great, you could take No.36 bus(2 block away)
 to downtown in about 15min, or take the link light rail.  
Mia's home locates in a very beautiful and safety community,neighbour is very nice.
Mia has 4 cats, you should definitely select here if you like cats.

"
815017,30467896,2015-04-22,29840175,Lana,"Mia's guest room was perfect for my needs, and a pleasure to stay in for the couple days I was there. The room is in the back of the house and completely private, opening into the back deck with a breathtaking view. It was clean, convenient, and very comfortable with a heavenly queen bed.  The cats of the house roam free, and I enjoyed interacting with them. I met Mia and her daughter, Julie, as well as the two other guests who are staying with Mia for the time being. Mia's home is well-loved, featuring living plants and animals, and beautiful artwork adorning the walls. Her house has a 5-minute max shower rule, which is easy once you have your priorities in order. All in all, Mia was a great host and I'd love to see her house again soon!"
815017,30807006,2015-04-27,30696373,Vanessa,"It was just amazing! Mia is a really welcoming host. My friend and I really enjoyed the Stay. We had a stunning view in the mornings and the bed was also really comfortable! 

Thank you so much Mia, 

I hope you liked what we wrote in your guest book :)"
815017,31413879,2015-05-04,25362634,Benjamin,"While the room offered privacy and a view, the kitchen was a great place for cozy conversation with Mia. The sunrise was amazing, the kitties were snuggly, and all in all, my stay was very much enjoyed. :D"
815017,31998841,2015-05-12,32273889,Amy,房间的风景非常好，mia是一个非常热心的主人。在我们到来后对环境和交通做了详细的介绍。但是洗手间空间比较小。
815017,32153015,2015-05-14,10134755,Kelly,"This is my ideal Airbnb stay.  Very open, communicative and with a ""lived in"" feeling.  It was a pleasure to stay with Mia, her family and pets.  I will surely use again when in the area.  Thanks Mia!"
815017,32223207,2015-05-15,17641932,Nate,Mia was great.  Super comfortable place with a fantastic view. I liked it so much I extended my stay.  Mia described the place well and she is very kind and interested.

815017,32423347,2015-05-17,33152477,Nadia,"Wish we could have stayed more than just 1 night. This was a great place- beautiful views, easy to get via public transportation (bus and light rail), and a fun area with restaurants and cafes. Loved that there were animals all around :) "
815017,32544498,2015-05-19,22702299,Ali,"Mia was an exceptional host with a wonderful home (not to mention a spectacular backyard view!) my friend Carolyn and I had a great weekend, and I was so glad we chose to stay at Mia's since there was sufficient transportation to down town and wonderful parks by the water near by! I would definitely stay here again! Also her pets were so adorable!! "
815017,32750996,2015-05-21,6203162,Francisco,"My wife and I have spent a beautiful time in Mía  house in Seattle.

 

To describe the place, we must mention the word charm, as every room and basically the back room with his beautiful style, visuals, its white painted furniture, provided a magical touch to our stay.

The reception was very warm by the host, sitting down to dinner or breakfast at the table Deck has always been a pleasure.

The neighborhood is charming with its low houses and splendid gardens. (Natural lush mind such as Mia)

Communication with the downtown is convenient and fast through train linking the city with the airport.
You just have to walk a few blocks, and this becomes a walk to appreciate the wonderful gardens.
The kitchen of Mía  was ready so we could prepare breakfast and quick dinners.


The dog, the cats, plants, everything makes you feel in a free place  

Thanks for letting us see Seattle  from such a creative and friendly perspective ,as is the atmosphere of your house ."
815017,32860658,2015-05-22,33437771,Anna,We had a very nice stay at Mia's place.  She was warm and welcoming and shared her knowledge of the surrounding area as my daughter was moving to Seattle.  Nice quaint neighborhood centrally located.  Thank you Mia!
815017,33393142,2015-05-27,31824309,Nikol,"Mia was so wonderful! It is not everyday you get to really sit down and chat with a host and we were very grateful to have had the pleasure. Apart from that, the space itself is pretty, clean and airy (we stayed in the big bedroom with the eastern view) and what a balcony!!! I was so happy and excited for this space. Other comments: I thought I would mind having to walk through someone else's bedroom to get to and from the bedroom and bathroom, but the curtains are more than sufficient privacy. "
815017,34182219,2015-06-05,6170859,Jessica,"I don't know whether I should begin with how incredibly kind Mia was, how lovely the neighborhood was, or how exceptionally beautiful the room was. I wish there was some way to convince her to let me rent it out permanently. :) "
815017,34718767,2015-06-11,89693,Jade,"Our stay with Mia was a wonderful experience. Five stars all around! She made me feel very welcome from beginning to end, and was the perfect level of helpful while giving us privacy. The neighborhood was very nice, and it was surprisingly easy to get into downtown (the Seattle light rail system is impressive!) as well as out to the nature areas. The room was extremely comfortable. The view from the window and patio (which felt like our private balcony) was very pretty, and the yard below was adorable. All of Mia's cats and her dog Yogi were the sweetest creatures, giving me some much needed animal love while I was away from my own pups. Overall, would highly recommend if you're in town to explore Seattle, to attend a conference, or want a very comfortable spot to touch base as you explore the national parks. Thanks, Mia, for a delightful time!"
815017,34899834,2015-06-13,34780250,Katie,"Mia was amazing, after a 16 hour drive from Calgary Alberta, it was truly a treat to see her friendly face.
The house was beautiful, everyone was so nice there.
The view from our window was stunning, waking up that morning my partner remarked he felt we were in a Dove commercial, so funny, but everything was so white and clean and shining with the sun coming in to great us through the windows.
A wonderful experience :)"
815017,34982512,2015-06-14,30428244,Twyla,Mia was very pleasant.  Her daughter was extremely sweet and very helpful. The neighbourhood was really cute and quiet.
815017,35133440,2015-06-15,28633733,Daniel,"Mia was very pleasant and lives in a beautiful home. The bed was comfy and located in a conservatory which had a stunning view and windows open all day. This meant I caught a few mosquito bites at night. Having said that, I still enjoyed my stay very much."
815017,35276915,2015-06-16,27995258,Laura,"We only stayed at Mia's for one night, but it was a wonderful experience. She was welcoming from the moment we met, and gave us plenty of privacy. Her daughter's puppy Bodhi was delightful, and we wish we could have taken him home with us. Although we had to catch well after the check out time, she allowed us to keep our bags at her home after check out. The room is absolutely stunning, highly recommend!"
815017,35484152,2015-06-19,33519241,Janet,"Mia is such a warm, welcoming host. The neighborhood was conveniently located near downtown Seattle and Mia gave great recommendations for places to explore in the city."
815017,36143311,2015-06-25,18298097,Silke,"Mia was very welcoming, helpful and hospitable. The house and neighborhood was great. It was a breeze to get to traveling from Portland on I-5 and close to public transportation. The room was cozy and comfortable and perfectly private at night. "

The Beacon Hill neighborhood is a treasure, and it was easy to walk to a great coffee shop, bars and restaurants.  Thank you so much for sharing your home, Mia, you will definitely be my first choice when next I am in Seattle!"
815017,37222569,2015-07-05,19983342,Adams,Mia has such a great home and was very welcoming. We loved our stay and hope to return!

Big room, super comfy, clean, lots of character, sweet deck to hang out on, and the hostess and daughter were very amiable and helpful. Overall awesome experience, 10/10 would recommend. Woke up with a cat laying on me. Awesome. "
815017,37696184,2015-07-09,5595925,Juuso,"I feel so happy I stayed couple nights at Mia's place. The house and its people were warm, friendly and welcoming - you will be inspired! The view from the room is amazing and everything feels really cozy. Highly recommended."
815017,38146851,2015-07-13,1685871,Diana,"Mia is such a friendly and welcoming hostess! She is full of information about fun things to see and do in Seattle and her coffee is deeeelicious! The room is very comfy and the view is beautiful to wake up to. And the collection of furry friends seem to be completely fine with all newcomers. I had a cat-away-from-home sleep on my bed just like every other night at my own house. Delightful! The location is a bit off the beaten path for anyone who really wants to be closer to downtown Seattle, but the price is right and makes staying a bit longer more affordable."
815017,38602951,2015-07-17,29106306,Lee-Na,"We had a lovely time at Mia's wonderful place. She welcomed us with open arms and a huge smile on her face making us feel right at home the minute we arrived. The room itself is beautiful- we had the deck almost entirely to ourselves and enjoyed early breakfasts in the sunshine with a beautiful sunrise! 
We loved all the other people and animals in the house too- we seemed to fit right in and everyone was just lovely.

I can highly recommend this place!

815017,39642622,2015-07-25,31560005,Gigliola,"We had a wonderfull two days stay at Mia's place.  The room was fantastic with a great view - very romantic... - and we could use the terrace for breakfast and relaxing. Mia and her daughters are very nice people, and they were very warm and friendly with us, as well as their pets (one dog, 4 cats and 4 rabbits...) Too bad we had planned to stay only two days !!! The district is a residential one on the hill, there are good restaurants and you can easily go downtown with a subway-like train, leaving the car in front of the house. This stay was one of the very special moments of our trip."
815017,39977707,2015-07-27,5129278,Hugues,Our stay was short and sweet. We arrived a bit late but Mia made sure there will be someone at home to welcome us. We left early the next morning after a very relaxing night. The bed was confortable and the neighboorhood quiet and peaceful. Mia also recommended us a nice mexican restaurant were we had a good breakfast.
815017,41439013,2015-08-07,35399898,Annie,"Mia was absolutely wonderful!! She was so kind and hospitable. We got extremely lost and ended up being almost two hours past when she expected us. Mia was so understanding and showed no sign of frustration at all. Really cozy bed, wonderful view, especially at night! Such an awesome experience! "
815017,42283431,2015-08-12,32089221,Livia,We loved our night with Mia. We felt very welcomed in the house and the cuddly animals. The neighborhood was great. Easy to walk to the light rail and some tasty restaurants nearby. The room was beautiful and the deck was great to wake up too. We definitely recommend it. 
815017,42591358,2015-08-14,39461258,James,Mia was very sweet and her room was sooo cozy and comfy! It matched the pictures completely. The view was spectacular! She had great recommendations for us. And her animals are adorable.
815017,42734561,2015-08-15,39256961,Sarah,"We had a fabulous stay at Mia's. Loved the easy quick walk to transit and accessibility to downtown. LOVED the animals, all very sweet and helped make us feel right at home.  It was our first stay using airbnb and Mia and her beautiful home set our standards very high. Mia was extremely helpful and friendly. The room was perfectly simple and beautiful with a fantastic view."
815017,42875463,2015-08-16,19145571,Nia,"Mia and her two girls were welcoming, easy to talk with, friendly and mellow. I felt at home right away. The vibe is low key and open. Because guests generally need to walk thru the main floor to come and go and the bathroom is shared, a guest wanting lots of privacy may not be a good fit. The house and the room I had is what I'd call ""shabby chic"" and very sweet. Bed was comfy with plenty of pillows and comforters. I even had a cuddly cat who slept all night with me, on my invitation. The view from the bed was lovely, and there is a deck outside the bedroom where one could sit and drink a morning cup of coffee, read, or just enjoy the scenery. The quiet older neighborhood has lots of character, pretty homes, big trees and mature landscaping, making it very private. Driving from out of town, Mia's house is easy to find, close to the freeway (but not too close) and the city center.
I had an evening event and Mia had a dinner party...when I returned, she, her daughters and a few friends invited me to sit down , enjoy a desert and share in the conversation. I couldn't have asked for a nicer finish to a great evening.  "
815017,43525744,2015-08-20,38370225,Weston,Mia's place had an awesome view of lake Washington! Also it was a quick walk and a train to downtown Seattle approximately it takes 15-20 mins to get downtown from Mia's! Would recommend staying here! Also Mia is super awesome.
815017,44325965,2015-08-25,37995925,Brandon,"Mia was awesome! Everything was just as expected and she was super helpful for people new to the city. The room was well worth the price, the view is amazing, and all of the pets were great company. The deck in the back was essential for recollecting our thoughts after our busy days. Her place is definitely close enough to Seattle to not worry too much about commuting each day. I really appreciated the come-as-you-go style that Mia offers, she is very laid back and friendly. One morning she even made us coffee as we gathered our plans for the day. 
5/5, great experience."
815017,44565401,2015-08-27,40308490,Kathryn,"Mia and her daughter were very friendly. The room was absolutely beautiful with a wonderful view and direct access to a magnificent porch. The furry critters are also a wonderful addition to the family, featuring rabbits in the front yard, the most friendly dog, and no fewer than 4 cats. We felt very welcome and it was a piece of cake to follow house rules. Easy, direct 20 minute bus ride to downtown and no issue street parking in front of Mia's house. As she disclosed in advance, guests should be welcoming of pets and understand that the bedroom is a through-way to the porch. "
815017,45283033,2015-09-01,39664895,Kaitlyn,"Mia's space is so great! We had a really busy weekend in the city and we picked her place based on it proximity to public transit. Not only was it convenient, but it was nice to come back to her place every night because we knew it would be calm and quiet (and we knew that her cats would come and cuddle with us, which made us feel even more at home). Mia and her daughter were both really welcoming, and very helpful whenever we had questions about the area. If you need a low key place to stay when you go up to Seattle, I would definitely recommend staying here. "
815017,45603158,2015-09-04,41871610,Caleb,"Mia was a very gracious and welcoming host. Both Mia and her family are incredibly friendly, including her pets. The room has a beautiful view with access to a spacious deck and a super comfy Queen size bed. The neighborhood is quiet, mostly residential with some great restaurants, coffee shops, pubs, and other businesses along the major streets. Mia's home is a 5-10 minute walk from the Light Rail station with easy access to downtown and the airport. I recommend this spot for anyone looking for a quiet, comfy, and welcoming home to stay in!"
815017,46038466,2015-09-07,15746965,Lauri,"Mia was a really friendly hostess. She helped us to find a budged way to Canada and advised with the local restaurants in Seattle. We enjoyed our stay. Our room was perfect, it was clean and had a lovely view over the Seattle city."
815017,46160286,2015-09-08,20867448,Ni,It was a nice one-night stay at Mia's house. The neighborhood was safe and quiet. Mia welcomed us with her lovely dog and 3 cute kitties. ;)   The room was big and clean with a great view outside.  The communication before the stay was really smooth too. I will choose here again if I get another chance to visit Seattle in the future. :)
815017,46955250,2015-09-14,42366569,Snezhana,"Staying at Mia's place was like staying with an old friend. She makes you feel instantly at ease and is wonderfully thoughtful. She knows Seattle really well and has a good feel for different neighborhoods and great suggestions of places to visit, restaurants and events. 
The room is cozy with an adjacent deck and breathtaking views of the lake and a comfy bed.  
There are lots of animals in and around the house. There are bunnies, funny cats and the sweetest dog. So if you are not into that it might be a problem for you.  
I loved every minute of my stay and would definitely go back and stay with Mia again. "
815017,47333963,2015-09-17,991268,J.L.,The listing was as she said. She greeted me with open arms. 
815017,48414724,2015-09-26,31260515,Imke,The view is awesome and the pets are so sweet. Mia and the other people were nice and helped us a lot. It was a nice stay.
815017,48907267,2015-09-29,16024103,Jesse,Mia was very helpful and accommodating.  My fiancé and I flew into Sea-Tac and Mia gave us simple directions to follow from the airport via the light rail to get us to the house.  Mia greeted us as we walked from the light rail station to her house.  The house is about a 5-10 minute walk to the light rail stop so it is very convenient and cost efficient to go downtown Seattle.  The view in the bedroom is amazing.  Mia has a dog and a few cats.
815017,50275245,2015-10-11,9014217,Valentine,Mia and their cutie pets are truly a sweet family to spend time with. The place sits in a quiet neighborhood in the city. The house is adorable with tons of natural lights and tress that makes dappled shade. Mia is very nice and it was a pleasure to stay with her. I hope you all the best. Thank you so much again!
815017,51470181,2015-10-20,38839006,Mahmood,"Nice room, very comfy bed and good location. Beautiful neighbourhood with many restaurants. The place is also close to the light train station which goes right to the downtown and the SEATAC airport.
Mia and her family were very friendly hosts and have friendly pets. Very well coming environment. Great hosts to talk with about general conversations.

Simply, Mia,is a great host. "
815017,52252953,2015-10-27,31302881,Miying,"Mia has a nice place in a quiet neighborhood. It's close to the airport, downtown, and most of the visiting sites. Also about 15 mins walk to the light rail station.  The host and her families are very welcoming. There was another guest during the time we were there and we had no problem sharing the bathroom. Overall, it's a nice experience."

4581256,24014763,2014-12-16,24582391,Justin,"Simon and his wife were very welcoming and hospitable. They offered lots of coffee and food (pastries, noodles, etc). The house is kept very clean, and it was generally quiet and comfortable both day and night. Only very minor concern was that the washer/dryer were downstairs, where other tenants sleep during the day because of night jobs. "
4581256,28368394,2015-03-22,7413598,John,"I had a great time here. Simon and his family were very welcoming. It's a quiet house, and I loved that aspect. Internet was fast. Room was on the small side, but comfortable and suitable nonetheless. I'd go back for sure."
4581256,29783956,2015-04-12,9393535,Steven,"Can't beat the rate and convenient location for just a place to sleep and hot shower.  Wifi signal is strong.

Clean and simple room is as pictured on upper floor of house.

Quiet after 10pm.

Experienced hosts.  Nothing weird here."
4581256,30244869,2015-04-19,16171658,Shardendu,"Welcoming host, my checking time changed due to flight delays and Simon was very accommodating on a Sunday afternoon by coming home early for the same. Room is cozy and clean. Neighborhood is very Peaceful, easily accessible to downtown via bus, safe. "
4581256,31997587,2015-05-12,16592484,Mario,Simon has a nice little house in a very nice neighborhood. There are bus stops all around and light rail station just a quick bus ride away. The room is right next to a bathroom which is very convenient and the hosts were kind enough to have two bottles of water waiting in my room when I arrived. This room is well worth the price.
4581256,32286013,2015-05-16,29930471,Sai,"It was a great experience stay at this apartment. The house is just a few minutes work from 36 bus stop and the room is very clean, highly recommended."

4581256,34709879,2015-06-11,31766842,Huguette,Je n'ai jamais vu mon hôte. Je ne connais pas Jennifer Pan. Ce devait être Simon mais c'est Isaac qui m'a accueillie et je ne l'ai plus jamais revu...Logement propre et bien décrit. Je n'ai vu presque personne à part un couple. Mais comme c'est loin du centre j'ai annulé le reste de mon séjour. J'attends toujours le remboursement...
4581256,36027061,2015-06-24,32347028,Ekaterina,"The house is in a quiet neighbourhood indeed which is important for my sleep :} I will join the rest of reviews and will also say that it's clean. The host appreciates if you remove shoes prior entering the house.
Was out most of the time to be honest and only needed a place to sleep. Still have a good impression."
4581256,37103282,2015-07-04,30837583,Jon,"The house was very clean and quiet. Laundry room was made available to me, and street parking was easy. Good place to stay!"
4581256,38329418,2015-07-14,1097033,Philip,"Jennifer was a very friendly host. The room In stayed in was clean, simple, and cozy. She allowed me to use the washing machine which was very helpful. If I could ask to improve one Thing it would be to explain the front door lock policy to all guests (there are several rooms being let out). On one occasion I almost got locked out because a new visitor thought that the door should be bolted. Otherwise a great experience that I would do again."
4581256,38750385,2015-07-18,32582515,Reza,"Anything was perfect. If you want to find a really clean, nice and safe place it's the best one.

The house wasas described, Jenifer was at home. She was business like. Showed the room, the bathroom to be shared with bunch of other pople.  Then she left and did not see her again.  The room was clean but small and very basic. Location was far from city center. No stores of any kind in imediate vecinity.. Next time I will choose a better lotion.."

There is a printed sheet with house rules (The city of Seattle makes recycling mandatory, etc.), and the access information for the Wi-Fi. A nice bathroom and a roomy tub/shower enclosure. It is a very comfortable place, indeed. I hope to book here in the future, but it already appears booked out for quite some time, so that should tell you something about how nice this family and their home is. "

The space is extremely private, tastefully decorated and is exactly as pictured. My boyfriend and I are both tall people, and we did not feel claustrophobic in the basement space at all. Dominique was very accommodating and provided us with great restaurant recommendations and ideas for outings. We are seasoned Airbnb guests, and I would definitely say this has been one of our best Airbnb experiences yet. I highly recommend staying with Dominique if you can; you will not regret it! "

He is extremely fast at responding to texts if you have any questions and is very personable. It seemed like he put a lot of thought into the cute little details here. I stayed here for 3 nights with my boyfriend and we absolutely loved his place. It felt like a cozy hotel. Great design. He provided us with everything-- coffee maker, mini fridge, blow dryer, towels, netflix, wifi, etc. He also gave us a list of restaurants that he recommended nearby with his personal reviews. I also really liked that the room had it's own private entrance too, it felt like we had our own place. If I'm ever coming back to Seattle I will definitely stay at Dominick's again, no doubt about it! Darn, it'll be hard to top this airbnb experience now!! "

Nos dejó un detalle en el escritorio que apreciamos mucho, además de una lista de lugares para visitar.

Definitivamente recomiendo la estancia en este lugar, la decoración muy buena, escuchamos música y aprovechamos Netflix para ver pelis."

In person, the private entrance, parking space, and amenities instantly reaffirmed my choice to stay here. The space is quiet and relaxing, which is perfect after a day in the busy city. 

Dominick was able to provide a background on the area that oriented me better to Seattle and made an impact on my trip. I fell in love with the neighborhood as well. Great and affordable restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance as well as being within walking distance of Lake Union and Gas Works Park. Plus, the listing is within walking distance of an express bus to downtown. Overall, this property and its gracious owner enhanced my time in Seattle. I would absolutely book this space again. "

Dominick is a delightful and thoughtful host making sure I had everything I needed including local gourmet chocolate and coffee as a welcoming treat. This is a gem of a space, cozy, private and in a perfect neighborhood with lots of great restaurants in walking distance. My favorite personal touch though, was the turntable with Dominick's great music collection...Al Green, Mingus to name a few. I would come back and stay here in a heartbeat. It's a total gem."
4871348,28648431,2015-03-28,10265348,Kacy Young-Won,"My boyfriend and I had a great time here. Dominick is a great host! He was so very accommodating! The room decor was authentic, we felt cozy and I think it's perfect for a couple. The shower pressure felt great and never had issues with the water temperature. He had a record player which we utilized a lot- he has great taste in music ;) the bed was firm yet comfortable- I often have a hard time adjusting to a new bed but had no problem here. It got a little chilly the first night and we notified Dominick right away and he was able to get that taken care of. He gave great recommendations as to where to go eat drink as well. I enjoyed having the private driveway since we had a rental car. When I return to Seattle I'll definitely be coming back here! Thanks for everything Dominick! "

He thought of everything when it came to the room, including a great coffee machine and the room was beautifully clean and spacious.  The neighbourhood was very colourful and easy to navigate around with plenty of shops, restaurants, cafes and bars close by. I would recommend anyone to stay in this private room and would stay there again in a second. One of my best airbnb experiences yet. "
4871348,30381904,2015-04-21,27209341,Linda,"This was my first experience with airbnb and I am pleased. Dominick was friendly, but also gave us privacy. The basement room had windows and was neat as a pin. Delicious coffee and a local theos chocolate bar were lovely extras. There was a small dorm frig to keep any drinks cold. The neighborhood is great, about 3 blocks from Wallingford."
4871348,31015965,2015-04-30,12934633,Ryan,"Dominick's place is really perfect!  He met me briefly when I arrived and showed me in.  The space is very clean and super comfortable-Perfect for me, as I was in town working a couple of days.  
The bed was great and I slept well, which isn't always the case.

One thing I enjoyed immensely were his collection of old vinyl records and the turntable.  Listening to old jazz records on his stereo is a must!

Lastly, I misplaced the room key and could not locate it (very embarrassing)...Dominick was quick to respond and had a spare handy--Thanks again for that.  Great place to spend a few days in a great Seattle neighborhood.  I highly recommend it!"
4871348,31372166,2015-05-04,3498175,Michael And Curt,"Dominick has perfected the art of being an airbnb host! Everything was just as described except for the fruit, chocolate, coffee/tea that was laid out in the room. Thankfully I don't have an allergy to these items;) Well done!"
4871348,31641897,2015-05-08,20802442,Xiao Yun,The location is well situated between 2 walkable neighbourhoods (Fremont and Wallingford) with nice restaurants. Dominick is very prompt and helpful.
4871348,32106541,2015-05-14,13177234,Sam,"We really enjoyed our stay at Dominick's. He was a very nice guy, and kind enough to leave us some coffee and some local chocolate :). We only ran into him once. Lots of recommendations were left for us, and he is in a great location for what we wanted. Within walking distance of a lot of great places, and the place was exactly as described, and cozy.  Street parking was no issue for us either, even though he offered the driveway. We would definitely stay with Dominick again!"
4871348,32321533,2015-05-17,16837245,Brandon & Sara,"Wow, what can we say: Dominick's place was a delight! Better than described, and the record player is AMAZING. We felt so at home, and the location can't be beat. Extra surprises were a mini-fridge and hair dryer! If you are coming to Seattle, this is the spot: hands down. This was our first airbnb experience and we're pretty sure it's all downhill from here. Thanks, Dominick!! "
4871348,32688707,2015-05-20,30215106,James,"We arrived before check in time, but since it was a Sunday we were able to meet Dominick and leave our things in his place. He gave us the key for the room, and placed our stuff in the room when it was ready. We went off to a watch a ball game, then upon returning in the evening we were very pleasantly surprised at the wonderful accomodation. It is a very nicely refurbished basement room, with great artwork, an awesome walk-in tile shower, and a record player with classic jazz, R&B, and folk music that added warm atmosphere to the space. Coffee was top notch! Dominick placed a listing of restaurants and coffee shops he recommends in the area, all within walking distance. What left to say, other than we are worried he will be booked solid next time we are in Seattle! Thank you!"
4871348,32970455,2015-05-24,29221597,Kevin,"Dominick was very accommodating. This was the cleanest room I've ever stayed in. He provided complimentary coffee, water, chocolate, and even a record player with a ton of classics. Words cannot describe what a pleasant experience it was staying here and I would highly recommended this location for anyone traveling in the Seattle area. "
4871348,33297269,2015-05-26,30060889,Malyssa,"This is a beautiful location. The neighborhood is filled with flowers and trees. It's very peaceful & quiet. The room has nice decor and is immaculate. Dominick is very easy to coordinate and provides delicious chocolate, coffee, and tea. The bed is comfy. I had a very relaxed stay and got to meet Dominick briefly who was very friendly and kind. I was so pleased with my first air bnb stay. "
4871348,33520764,2015-05-29,9097210,Pearly,"The space was clean, beautiful, and exactly as shown in the pictures. There was a sleek turntable and great records to listen to. The space is very inviting and had lots of warm lighting. The shower was spacious. There was a handy fridge for leftover foods from out trips out. This place is quite close to restaurants in Fremont and Wallingford, about a short walk away from both. The description was accurate and met my expectations. 

Dominick was considerate and let us know he was working on a project that would be noisy and could move it around if we were home at the time. He left a list of great places nearby to eat and drink at. My friend and I enjoyed our stay here and would stay here again."
4871348,33779965,2015-06-01,11901793,Kati,"Wir hatten 3 tolle Tage in Seattle bei Dominick. Frisch gelandet nach der langen Reise aus Deutschland war das Appartment genau das richtige für uns. Mit dem Taxi kommt man für ca. 13 Dollar ab Westlake bequem vor die Haustüre. Mit einem sehr bequemen Bett, einem schönen Bad mit großer Dusche, sehr gutem Kaffee und einem liebevoll eingerichteten Zimmer in sehr hübscher Nachbarschaft ist man bestens versorgt. Wir haben es sehr genossen in Fremont zu wohnen. Es gibt genügend Restaurants und Cafes fußläufig zu erreichen. Wirklich lecker und echt nett ist es im Restaurant El Camino. Da bekommt man sogar die Biere zur Probe vorab! Auch wirklich schön ist es abends am Burke-Gilman Trail zu sitzen und den Booten zuzuschauen und der Brücke, wie sie immer wieder öffnet. Am bestem was im Supermarkt holen und einfach die Abendstimmung genießen... Obwohl wir Dominick leider knapp verpasst haben, hat uns seine Bekannte Nina sehr nett empfangen. Vielen Dank nochmal für die liebe Gastfreundschaft! Dominick hat uns im Voraus bei der Planung der Anreise bestens geholfen. Besser kann man für seine Gäste nicht da sein!"
4871348,33986821,2015-06-03,798445,Sarah & Luke,"Dominick's place in Seattle is fabulous! It's a perfectly sized home away from home with every comfort considered. We throughly enjoyed the record player, the impossible rubicks cube, Netflix, freshly brewed coffee and the lovely little treat that was left for us to enjoy. Everything is superbly appointed - the bathroom is modern and pristine, the bed is really comfy and there's even a little fridge to store a few bits. The place is about a $13 cab ride to downtown, a 7min walk to a super fast bus connection downtown and close walking distance to some fantastic eateries and bars. The whole suburb is leafy & peaceful. Dominick's friend Nina looked after us superbly and made us feel right at home with wonderful communication :-) Thank you both for a great stay! "
4871348,35793760,2015-06-22,31672454,Jamie,"We were there for two nights to meet friends st Seattle. The place was really clean and seemed like very well maintained or recently renovated. Because we arrived late and spend most of day at friends house, I did not have a chance to meet the host but he left all necessary information on his welcome letter and even left us a chocolate! All we need, hair dryer, coffee maker, clean towels and linens and some toiletry was there too. If we visit Seattle again, we will visit this place for sure! Thank you!"
4871348,36271586,2015-06-27,4437256,Emily,"Arrival was quick and easy. Everything was explained well and Dominick even left a guidebook to restaurants around the area specific to what I told him we were interested in. The space was beautiful and perfect for our stay! Also, he left some local Theo chocolate for us that was delicious!"

4871348,37299472,2015-07-06,30883082,Ivette,"As a first time airbnb user my experience was great! Dominick's space is clean, functional, with a touch of home. I enjoyed the small record collection and and accessibility  of Netflix  after winding down from a long day of tourism.  It a great location to explore Fremont shops and restaurants and an uber away from visiting other fun Seattle neighborhoods. I definitely recommend this space for Seattle Explorers ;)"
4871348,37560337,2015-07-08,29222750,Françoise,"L'accueil de Dominick a été très sympathique,il nous a conseillé des quartiers à visiter, ainsi que des restaurants  tout était parfait"
4871348,37847714,2015-07-11,408003,Nicole,"This was a great setup for an Airbnb. The room was very private and cozy, and Dominique was a good host. We ended up not interacting in-person, but he left information for everything we needed and we knew he was available if anything came up. We also appreciated all of the small touches like providing coffee and chocolate and leaving a stack of fun records for us to listen to. The room itself was spotless, the bed was comfortable, and it was really quiet. We also loved the neighborhood. Fremont has a lot of cool shops and places to eat and drink, and it was all very walkable. "
4871348,38265287,2015-07-14,26072855,Jill,"We loved Dominick's place! It was clean, comfortable, and exactly as he described. The location was ideal - a short walk to the bus, zoo, and several restaurants, and a 10 minute drive downtown. Would recommend!"
4871348,38712449,2015-07-18,33079957,Ashley,"We stayed at Dominick' s for 4 nights. Everything was perfect, (just as described) and we could not have asked for a better experience!  Only a $10-12 ride to city attractions with uber.

 We highly recommend the room and would stay again of ever in the area!"
4871348,39274585,2015-07-22,31174888,Rojelyn,"The place was simple, clean, and very cozy. It is a basement with everything you need including desk, fridge, fan, and bathroom. It is private enough to where you can come in late and won't disturb the owner or guests at home. The location is central, just a few minutes to downtown and every major parts of Seattle. Dominick is very helpful and accommodating, he left maps, snacks/chocolates, and coffee/tea during our stay. He even lends you 2 bikes if needed. Thank you Dominick for being a great host. I would definitely recommend this place if you are staying in Seattle."
4871348,39489297,2015-07-24,11627662,Lori,"When we walked into the room it was very evident that Dominick is a perfectionist. The room was immaculate, and the décor was very nice.   Also it was very quiet and private."
4871348,39751587,2015-07-26,24051940,Leah,The space was quite small but immaculate and served our needs - which was to be very close to our son's place. It is perfect for anyone looking for a great bed in a great Neighborhood.   Not a place to hang out in - too small for that. 
4871348,40115083,2015-07-28,36067648,Michelle,"Dominick contacted me prior to our trip to make suggestions about what to do in the area during our short trip. The room was as described and pictured - clean and welcoming. Dominick had a coffee maker with local coffee in the room as well as some other small touches which made the room feel more like a home away from home. There were maps of neighborhoods within Seattle as well as bus routes, which we found very helpful. He also had bikes available for use. Dominick was friendly and personable, though we only saw him once when we introduced ourselves. "
4871348,40581229,2015-08-01,12907654,Sabrina,"We love Dominick's place, it's literally better than a hotel room. Weather in Seattle was unexpectedly hot during our stay, Dominick was very nice to set up the air condition unit to cool down the room. Coffee and chocolate he left us were really nice as well. Dominick also provided the bicycles for us to borrow, but we never get the chance to use it!Thanks a lot for having us. 
"
4871348,41748119,2015-08-09,16786855,Jake,"Dominick was a great host, very accommodating and was always willing to answer any questions I had. He even left out coffee, tea, and water which was great after the plane ride."
4871348,42265192,2015-08-12,2535837,Jamie,"I had a great time staying at Dominick's place. Dominick seems like a very friendly guy and a good person to ask for tips if you need them. His place was just the size I needed, and very clean, comfortable, and tastefully decorated. He stocked it with nice amenities too, like coffee, tea, water, and a set of good local recommendations. There are many interesting touches, most of which I didn't have time to take advantage of, like the TV with Netflix, turntable, and mountain bike to borrow. Highly recommended!"
4871348,43043047,2015-08-17,34389416,Bettina,"We really liked staying at Dominick's place. We would recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle.

4871348,43632373,2015-08-21,8630354,Kate,"Dominick's room is a lovely place to stay. He provided all sorts of notes and guides when I arrived, a small gift of Seattle, and set out the bikes for me to borrow. I ended up not using the bikes cause I love walking and he is so closely located to Fremont, Wallingford, and the University District. The house is quiet and cozy and I made sure to take advantage of the in-room record player. I definitely recommend this room for a quaint Seattle stay, off the beaten path. "
4871348,43949713,2015-08-23,28429210,Andrew,We had a great experience in Seattle! Dominick was very accommodating. The place was easy to find with close parking.

4871348,48069243,2015-09-23,14141786,Jason,"Cozy nook under the main house that is just enough space for 2. Had great amenities including 2 bikes, coffee, awesome vinyl player/aux receiver, towels, space heater, and complimentary chocolate bar. Dominic was very friendly and welcoming as well as very considerate of our privacy. Thanks for providing such a lovely place in a central location!"
4871348,48399115,2015-09-26,40537818,Darlene,"First experience with airbnb at Dominick's and it was great!! He was such a great host; very accommodating of our schedule. Prior to the trip he even helped me figure some things out by answering questions! 
The room was exactly as described - clean and private. It was just the perfect space for two people. I felt special with the welcome notes and chocolate bar, and the recommendations for restaurants, coffee shops, etc. around the neighborhood. Thumbs up on the coffee and fridge provided as well! Staying at his place made our quick trip to Seattle just perfect! I would definitely try to reserve Dominick's place again when I'm back! "
4871348,49004074,2015-09-30,38459974,Nina,"The room was very comfortable, clean and spacious. The bathroom was equipped with everything we needed and had a very roomy shower.
Dominick was a great host and gave us helpful tips about Seattle and provided us with maps and flyers. When we arrived, he greeted us personally and told us about the most interesting places in the neighbourhood. We had a great stay and can only recommend Dominick's room to anyone visiting this lovely city."
4871348,49268296,2015-10-02,27243296,Emily,"We loved our stay in this space! The room was spotless and Dominick left us chocolate, tea and local coffee. The location was fantastic and I'll definitely recommend his room to friends."
4871348,49615174,2015-10-05,11001693,Katie,"Dominick was a wonderful host! My parents were looking for somewhere a bit outside of the city and my studio in Ballard is too small to accommodate two extra people. This was the perfect solution. They were welcomed with wonderful chocolate, he has books to read and Netflix. He was also great at communication and he was very accommodating when it came to check in time! If my parents ever come out to visit again, we will definitely be booking with Dominick again! "
4871348,50092018,2015-10-09,43497504,Tom,Great place to stay. Clean. Dominick had fresh local coffee and chocolate set out to try. He let me use his bike one day to explore the area. Good walking distance to many locals even a great zoo to go to about a mile away. 
4871348,50835137,2015-10-15,223194,Susan  And Allan,"Our stay in Dominick's home was perfect. The space was cozy an had everything we required. The shower was good, the lighting was great  and my husband enjoyed making coffee each morning. We could not have been happier.

Not too far away from Downtown Seattle and perfect area to walk around and enjoy some great restaurants.  The room was clean and had everything we needed.  Very private and cozy.  Dominick was nice enough to leave us some great coffee and delicious chocolate and great records to listen to. 

Thanks so much Dominick, would definitely like to stay here again when we return to Seattle. "

His place was just as described--cozy, quiet, clean, private, and in a great neighborhood that was walking distance to awesome restaurants, cafes, and bars. Dominick's neighborhood suggestions were on point--we went to Eltana's, Revel, and Russel's. "
4871348,53180847,2015-11-06,42203109,Nicole,We stayed at this private room for 3 nights and enjoyed it very much. Everything was decorated with good taste and I loved the selection of natural products and tea. Dominick also has his finger on the pulse regarding cafes/restaurants and events on around his area.
4871348,53521996,2015-11-09,37373269,Kenny,"Dominick was very easy to communicate with and schedule our arrival time in Seattle.

Awesome AirB&B in a great location. Very clean and well taken care of.

Would highly recommend, great host!"
4871348,53970233,2015-11-15,3351526,Doreen,"Great place to stay, even looked like the upload images :) Everything was neat & clean!!! I like that. Dominick was very helpful pulling together some hypoallergenic sleeping goods for me too with out giving me any grief! He also provided a great list of places to eat with a personal note to go along with each one. I can highly recommend Cafe Bizzarro too! Fav food, crazy fun setting, nice wine list.
There was excellent fresh ground coffee for the main' & we were greeted with a yummy dark chocolate bar :)
Neighborhood is small hip houses and you could... walk to several good eating spots, park etc. We felt safe and sound there. Thank you Dominick for creating a lovely get away space!"
4871348,54585429,2015-11-22,44627807,Sandra,Our experience was awesome! This was our first time w/AirBnb after a friend told us how great it was. The weather was great while we were here. Only a little bit of rain the evening we arrived which we took full advantage of by walking the streets. Dominick's place was very easy to find and extremely inviting. Perfect size. Having Netflix available was great as after exploring all day we were tired and decided to stay in after dinner and drinks. I am now in love with Seattle and hope that when I come back Dominick's place will be available. It is the perfect distance from everything and being in a neighborhood where you can go walking around to cafes and even a bar for drinks was nice. Took his advice and saw the Glass blowing exhibit while at the Space Needle. I highly recommend buying the pkg for the two. Such a beautiful sight. 
4871348,55040689,2015-11-27,310357,Wassim,Dominick thought of everything and keeps a very cozy place filled with amenities you'd expect at a hotel. Location is great and keeps you connected to the local neighborhoods with easy access to downtown Seattle.
4871348,55199879,2015-11-29,5820883,Nancy,"Dominick was an exceptional host in every way. Communication was great, place was spotless and as described, he was helpful and accommodating. Loved the note and restaurant suggestions, coffee and tea bar, and a locally made chocolate bar. Thanks for hosting us over the Thanksgiving weekend!"
4871348,55811560,2015-12-06,9701922,Jeff,"Dominick was very friendly, quiet, and responsive.  The room was clean and included some delightful welcoming touches such as excellent coffee for the morning and some fine chocolate. The separate entrance was a welcome feature. The home is located in a a quiet neighborhood with plenty of free parking, but it is also close to friendly neighborhood coffee shops and  restaurants that reflect the best Seattle vibe.  Since I was speaking at a conference, I  was delighted to find how short the drive was to downtown; there were good public transit options too.

Since our visit was in the winter, Dominick naturally had the furnace on at night.  When we mentioned the noisy fan interrupted our sleep, he quickly came up with an alternative heating option that worked perfectly. 

We look forward to staying at Dominick's place again the next time we visit Seattle."
4871348,56339618,2015-12-12,6392868,Joshua,"Very good space with a number of amenities that one doesn't always find at an Airbnb.  As someone who used to live in this part of Seattle, I can speak to the quality of the recommendations for dining and drinks that were provided.  There were a lot of things that I remember from the neighborhood and a few new things (or perhaps hidden gems!) that I didn't know about.

Would certainly stay here again."
4871348,57376562,2015-12-25,48641508,Michelle,"This airbnb is one of the best I've stayed at. It's in a really great location between two good walking neighborhoods, and while it may be a little far from downtown, you can easily catch an uber or (if you're in the mood) just walk anyway, because the route is pretty safe! Dominick is a great host - I never got to meet him (he's a great host for travelers who like privacy!), but he provided a very clean, pleasantly-decorated environment with lots of thoughtful amenities, as well as great tips for restaurants nearby - so I still feel like I got to know him a bit, through his sense of design! I'd say the space is even nicer than in the photos!"
4871348,57669899,2015-12-28,36973468,Alyssa,Great room and safe feeling location. Not right in the heart of the city so it was quiet and relaxing at the end of the day after being touristy and being completely exhausted.
4871348,57889811,2015-12-30,27503451,Whitney,Beautiful space! We absolutely loved this cozy room. The record player in the room was the perfect way to help end our days exploring Seattle. Dominick was friendly and gave us great suggestions of places to eat!
4871348,58229674,2016-01-01,22043506,Claire,Dominick's place was perfect for our quick stay in Seattle. He was so easy to communicate with from the get-go and the room was even better than the pictures. The record player was a great added bonus. 10/10 would recommend. 
1114695,5184330,2013-06-17,76825,Clay,"Cool place, there are a ton of great restaurants nearby and you can get on the bus easily if you want to go downtown to the market or other touristy stuff. House really stands out!"
1114695,7366855,2013-09-17,7873771,Scott,We really loved the place a lot.  Great location in Wallingford.  We actually walked to the UW campus where we were dropping off our kids.  Kind of a long walk but very nice.  Close to downtown.  Comfy beds and great kitchen.  I would rent the place again.
1114695,7635673,2013-09-27,102623,Stephen,Fast response. The unit I was looking at was unavailable but Seth suggested another one that was just as good. Will definitely stay with Seth again.
1114695,11473759,2014-04-04,4717006,Emily,"I was traveling to town with two work colleagues for an in-person session, and we decided to get this Airbnb instead of a hotel. It was so nice!! Even though we had office space downtown for the day, we did a lot of our work in the living room -- which was light and open and had plenty of room for 5-6 people to sit together. 

The house was very clean and comfortable, and a great location. We were able to go for walks around Green Lake, do our own grocery shopping (just a three block walk away), and walk to tacos, ice cream, coffee, and more! The kitchen had plenty of pots, pans, dishes - so we could do some of our own food prep.

The Host was very responsive and available for small questions during the stay, all of which were promptly resolved. We left just one piece of feedback - which would be for better window coverings for the bedrooms. Still, we'd love to come back. "
1114695,11795127,2014-04-15,9315466,Lindsey,I rented Seth's place during my sister's wedding for the bridal party. It was so perfect! The house is very classy and spacious. There was bath products in the bathrooms that smelled great! The lounge area was comfy and a great atmosphere. The deck was incredible; you can see downtown and the space needle! We were walking distance to a bus stop that took us anywhere we wanted to go.  The kitchen is very nice with the best appliances; it was also stocked with any utensil we needed.  The beds were so comfy with memory foam! Also there was a blow up mattress too. Seth is responsive and a pleasure to rent from. I will use Seth again and would recommend him to any out of town family traveling to seattle.
1114695,12086568,2014-04-22,13898125,Katy,"The place was amazing.  Great kitchen, nice roof top deck.  Perfect location in Wallingford close to a grocery store, and many bars and restaurants.  He is very respectful toward his neighbors, he kept in good touch and called to check in to see how things were going.  "
1114695,12455130,2014-05-03,12549936,Ada,"I miss this house already. 
My friends and I were actually kinda sad when we left this beautiful home. We had a group of 6 and it was very comfortable and spacious. Everything was clean and modern with plenty of towels for everyone. Our flight was early and Seth was very accommodating and let us check in early. The home was located in a great neighborhood with lots of delicious eateries and even a 24 hour grocery store that's a block from the house. Oh and we even bumped into Dave Matthews (he lives in the neighborhood - how cool is that?!). We will definitely stay at Seth's place again and would highly recommend it to all of our friends and anyone who wants to visit Seattle. WAYYY better than a hotel and super fun if you have a group traveling. "
1114695,14171288,2014-06-13,1348384,Nick,The house was clean and the owner Seth was very prompt with all of our questions. I would stay there again.
1114695,14480987,2014-06-20,1164139,Matt,Great pad.  Love the rooftop deck.  Perfect for business travelers.
1114695,15066132,2014-07-01,16794452,Sophie,Great place. Very central. You can even see the Space Needle from the roof deck. We were 7 in total and had plenty of space. The decoration is very nice too.
1114695,16079281,2014-07-22,2582741,Eliott,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. As pictured, the structure was a brand new, spacious and fully outfitted three story structure with a roof deck. Appliances were brand new and all features were top grade. Besides the garage, there is also a full drive way combined for two parking spaces. The neighborhood streets were quiet. The location is one block away from N 45th which spanned 7 or 8 blocks, as well as next to Stone Street, which combined offered excellent restaurants, ice cream, as well as a top notch supermarket just a block away. The property owner was readily available and sent regular emails to make sure everything was just right.

I would highly recommend this rental to anyone without reservation."
1114695,17088293,2014-08-07,12581250,Chris,Hey Hey! This was my first AirBnB trip. Seth's place was very nice. Pretty cool architecture in a great location. Wallingford is a really sweet area and I'd be happy to return.  Thanks Seth!!!
1114695,20251328,2014-09-26,20783527,David,"This was my first airbnb experience and staying in seth's place was great. He was very prompt to answer any of our questions from check in to check out. We definitely enjoyed spending time around the neighborhood and it's a plus that everything is so close by walking distance (groceries, restaurants, gas station etc). If I have the opportunity to return to Seattle, this would be a great place to come back to. "
1114695,21009138,2014-10-09,6451979,John,"The house is great, very comfortable living room to hang out in, nice bedrooms, etc.. we stayed for two weeks and would happily stay longer. The neighborhood is really laid back but with a lot of stuff in close walking distance (a 24h QFC/Bartell is  2 blocks, as are a couple of good coffee shops -- Chocolati and Fuel are right across the street from each other -- and a few good restaurants, with a lot more not very far away). Definitely recommended."
1114695,21797029,2014-10-24,21411092,Zhihao,Seth was extremely accommodating of all our requests and went out of his way to make our stay as comfortable as possible. He was also very responsive by phone/e-mail when we needed to get a hold of him. The house is located in a great neighborhood and we enjoyed our stay tremendously.
1114695,23730354,2014-12-08,24380126,Andrea,Seth was an awesome host. I had a weird time schedule for my length of stay- and Seth had no problem making it work. Such a relief! The home was cozy and modern just as pictured. I would definitely recommend him to my friends!
1114695,25379654,2015-01-14,1825625,Karen,"Beautiful, modern, luxury condo in ideal location.  Walk to everything -- great restaurants, shopping, and parks.  Easy public transit to downtown.  Great view from the rooftop deck, you can even see the Space Needle.  Seth is very professional.  "
1114695,25531858,2015-01-18,7988618,David,"What a house! Great spot, everything we could ask for and more. Seth was the perfect host available via text and instructions laid throughout the house. We will definitely be back next time we are in Seattle! "
1114695,27041672,2015-02-23,1190698,Christy,The reservation was canceled 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1114695,27157274,2015-02-27,6894980,Michael,"Seth is very professional and organized.  The house is clean, comfortable, and modern.  The neighborhood is absolutely lovely, and in a perfect location for everything.  There are many wonderful restaurants within walking distance, as well as beautiful parks.  "
1114695,30117656,2015-04-17,5467133,Inna-Marie,"Seth was there for us and so accommodating when we had a nightmare with another listing we had booked. The AMAZING folks that staff Airbnb found Seth for us and moved our reservation, he has several properties and sent us to this one that was very clean and ready for us to head to immediately. The place was huge!!! I loved the location because it was right in the heart of Wallingford where I used to live (Al's is the best neighborhood bar ever, I miss it, stop by and say hi to Dave for me when you're there). The apartment itself is everything it appears to be in the listing, super sleek and modern and very clean and very comfortable. 

One downside for us was that our bed (the master) was way way way way to soft. I wrenched my neck and it hurt all the next day, and I'm usually the one who likes a soft bed. So be aware. 

Also be aware, there were no essentials available, maybe it was cause of our last minute booking, so bring your own shampoo, etc.

Overall it was fantastic! Thank you so much, Seth!"
1114695,32571580,2015-05-19,21109698,Grady,"The property was as advertised...an amazing, new, modern property in a wonderful location. We will be back! Seth is prompt amd professional. Lucky to find this place. Love the neighborhood. "
1114695,33757077,2015-05-31,11162714,Nick,"We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay while visiting Seattle.  We were out here for work and needed a place at the last minute.  Seth was more than accommodating and ensured that our stay was very comfortable and easy.  The house is beautiful, in a great location, and very comfortable.  I would definitely stay here or at one of Seth's other places the next time I visit."
1114695,34674370,2015-06-10,7333572,Margaret,"Beautifully designed modern home! Seth's place was well kept, clean and well appointed. The location was perfect: nearby restaurants, bars and even a grocery store! I'd recommend this for sure and I can't wait to go back myself. "
1114695,35364952,2015-06-18,21936405,Laura,"Very modern, clean townhouse in Wallingford section of Seattle. Worked wonderfully for us, as we were in town for the UW graduation. Very comfortably slept six; relatively quiet neighborhood with lots to offer!"
1114695,35526000,2015-06-19,1864369,Kyung,"We had a quick stay on a last-minute business trip. Super-fast response, awesome house in a great Seattle neighborhood - will definitely consider again next time we need a place to stay in the area."
1114695,39297880,2015-07-22,28399108,Marleen,"We loved staying in your fantastic, very modern design home ! It is very spacious, comfortable and clean, located in a quiet neighborhood, with a grocery store in walking distance, and all that not so far from Seattle Centre. Really a perfect location ! Hope to be back once !
MARLEEN"
1114695,40298260,2015-07-29,39719906,Robert,It was a great place in a cool area. I was in town for business for a single night. I totally recommend the place!
1114695,42286983,2015-08-12,10650828,Nora,Lovely house in a great area of the city! Seth was quick to respond to our questions as first time airbnbers.
1114695,42437484,2015-08-13,3179871,Glenn,Great overnight accommodation for our group of 6. Love the roof deck and kitchen with everything easy to use and find. Very convenient to get to after Seattle sightseeing.
1114695,43352862,2015-08-19,3552675,Barbara,"Neighborhood was great!  Description of condo great! Photos were very accurate!
Seth was easily available and it was great having a door passcode rather than dealing with a key. "
1114695,44003454,2015-08-23,31616215,Darshan,"Checking In and Checking out was quick. The home was clean and nice. Would recommend for anyone looking to have a nice, quiet stay."
1114695,44996975,2015-08-30,5565721,Dana,Seth was very accommodating and a great communicator. 
1114695,46273180,2015-09-09,36250326,Laura,"This was a great property. Walking distance to a number of great restaurants and the waterfront and not too far to the city. 

The apartment was nice and homely and had everything that we needed for our 10 night stay from Australia. "
1114695,48581178,2015-09-27,41678408,Alan,"Neighborhood is great and listing is accurate, my wife and I, with our 2 young boys (2 & 4 y.o.) enjoyed our 10 day stay in this great place. Superb Location + Excellent Property! Only wish that we could have stayed longer. Had a small issue with TV and Seth came by and fixed it right away. Amazon Prime and Netflix is awesome! Communication with Seth is instant and easy. Do have to watch out for noise level as this town house shares a common wall with the neighbor. One night our boys was watching TV too loud got the neighbor knocking on the wall. Property is super clean like a 5 star hotel, the cleaner is doing a great job!
Thanks Seth! "
1114695,49993544,2015-10-08,8852589,Kyle,"Seth's home was an ideal accommodation for our group of six people. The home's main floor has an open kitchen that connects to the living room, so it works nicely for larger groups. The location is quiet and convenient with a large supermarket located only one block down. There are also small restaurants and other local shops in the immediate vicinity. 

The only downside (minor) is the TV was hard to use. "
1114695,50304741,2015-10-11,15832374,Margaret,This is a beautiful house in fantastic neighborhood. My friends and I had a wonderful weekend at Seth's home. The rooftop view of the city was beautiful!
1114695,53854308,2015-11-13,214802,Anton,The house is modern and located in a quiet residential neighborhood. Everything is brand new and it is very clean. There are many hip restaurants and coffee shops within a short walking distance.
1851863,8947510,2013-11-27,9728153,Nick,"The apartment was exactly as described: simple, but exceptionally clean and comfortable. Susanna went out of her way to insure that my stay was pleasant and that I had anything I might need. Thanks again Susanna!"
1851863,12596850,2014-05-05,14909370,Holly,Absolutely wonderful place to stay! It was clean and welcoming! Susanna was so kind and helpful. We would stay again! 
1851863,13815006,2014-06-05,1343509,Susan,"I had a very pleasant stay at Susanna's duplex. With good bus routes nearby, I got around easily without a car. The kitchen is minimally stocked with cookware and dishes, so it might be difficult to host a dinner party there, but I had everything I needed. "
1851863,14161175,2014-06-13,58896,Paula,"Susanna is a fabulous host! She is very sweet, welcoming, and available all the time to answer my questions. She makes sure that my stay is comfortable and I have what I need. The apartment is super clean and beautiful. It's simple, spacious, and comforting. The whole unit has a great air flow and enough windows to allow natural lights getting in. Parking space is available right in front of the apartment, internet connection is fast, most furnitures are brand new. The apartment is close to both local and Asian grocery stores; it is located in a great neighborhood and very close to any point of interest in Seattle. This is the best apartment option in the area. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who is visiting Seattle or looking for a temporary housing. "
1851863,14439563,2014-06-19,5035833,Patty,"Susanna was a very gracious host.  We were happy that she reached out to us to get the check-in time and procedure set for our arrival - not everyone does that and we appreciated it very much!

When you rent this apartment, you are renting the entire place - and it is YOURS.  Too often homeowners who rent their place on Airbnb simply push their stuff aside to try to make room for you.  But while you are living here, the entire place will feel like your own.  Loved that.  :)

Cannot say enough about how clean and neat this apartment was.  And while the decor is minimalism at its finest, Susanna has added some nice touches, it doesn't mean that quality has been sacrificed.  We loved the organic teas and spa-like bath soap.  And the washer/dryer are awesome - very powerful yet energy efficient and we appreciated being able to wash our clothes during our travels. We loved that Susanna was available if we needed anything (she lives right next door), but she left us to our own devices and we had complete privacy.

The home and neighborhood were super quiet.  And we slept like babies in the amazingly comfortable firm bed - and the pillows were perfection. We love to go for walks, and while it is one block to a busy street that was not very pretty to look at, simply heading in the other direction brought us through quiet streets.  We didn't know until we left that if we would have kept on going in that direction we would have run into some very cute restaurants and bars.  So be sure to ask Susanna how to get to them.

Thanks, Susanna!  :)"
1851863,14703989,2014-06-24,9606147,Suzy,Susanna's place was great! It was very clean and even more spacious than the pictures. I would definitely stay at her place on my next visit to Seattle!
1851863,14845152,2014-06-27,17021424,Cheng,Susanna was a good and kind host. She was easy to reach and tried to resolve whatever issue there was. Her place was very comfortable and exactly what was shown in the picture.
1851863,16344606,2014-07-26,15512043,Edward,"I relocated from New York City to Seattle for my new job and before I could lock down on a neighborhood and apartment I needed a place to stay for a month. I'm glad I found Susanna's place here. I had the entire fully furnished apartment to myself. Clean furniture, bathroom, kitchen, comfy bed, included wifi, and a parking spot - it has everything. Also since I stayed for a while the new washer and dryer were perfect. This place literally is the best of both worlds - equipped like a luxury hotel suite but has the roominess and privacy of a house.

Compared to NY, Seattle's summer is cooler and dry. But there were still hot days in the peak of July but the place stayed completely cool throughout. It is right by a main arterial to downtown and has access to the RapidRide which is a quick 20 minute from downtown Seattle. The neighborhood is quiet and noise-free. I also frequently ran in the nearby Green Lake Park - nice large park with tons of activities. There are restaurants, fastfood and supermarkets all within walking distance.

Susanna was very attentive and great in making sure everything is up to spec and even the little details like a fruit peeler is stocked in the kitchen (which I broke!) She even made sure my UPS packages are safe when they left it on the doorsteps. She is always reachable via text. 

I now moved into a smaller apartment downtown, so I kind of miss that Greenwood / Green Lake area. If I ever have friends coming over to Seattle (hopefully to visit me) I would definitely recommend Susanna's place."
1851863,16483119,2014-07-28,17222605,Shiho,"Loved our stay! The place was very clean, close to cafés, restaurants, and a grocery store. Susanna was wonderful. She answered questions we had I a timely manner. I'd recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle."
1851863,16753238,2014-08-01,18951255,Ryan,"My wife and I stayed here for a few days and it was perfect for what we needed. 

Here is the lowdown on this place:
-your own place. 
-Susanna is awesome to deal with and very helpful and kind 
-easy access to downtown. 15mins max on bus and you can also use car2go (get an account if you don't have one yet) so easy and awesome. 
-very clean and comfortable 
-exactly what you see in the pictures and even nicer. 
-20 min taxi ride from the airport 
-you can easily walk to restaurants close by 

we will stay here again if we are in the area. 

thx again Susanna.

1851863,16872509,2014-08-03,8614940,Rachael,"This was a GREAT stay!!! The space is super cute and exactly what I wanted!! it was clean, convenient and Susanna was an excellent host! "
1851863,17157112,2014-08-08,17274274,Alexandra,"We had a really good time staying at Susanna's place. She was really accommodating, had great tips for us and even supplied our kids with some sand toys. Thanks so much for having us :)))"
1851863,17445518,2014-08-12,17060990,Susan,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in Susanna's suite. The suite comes with a private entrance, so you have the entire place to yourself. It is also very clean, modern, and extremely comfortable, which was much appreciated. I was really impressed by the washer and dryer in the unit. As a host, Susanna was extremely accommodating, thoughtful, and easy to reach. She went out of her way to make sure I had everything I needed in the unit, and was happy to answer my questions about the area. The house is located close to a main arterial, which means really great public transportation to downtown Seattle. Green Lake Park, located a mile away, is accessible by both foot or bus. I got around by bus for most of my stay and rented a car for one day. During that day, Susanna made sure I had a parking space right in front of the suite. All in all, I highly recommend staying in Susanna's suite and would not hesitate to stay there again. Thanks Susanna! "
1851863,18090846,2014-08-21,19856530,Joseph,"Susanna made me feel very welcome. The unit was exactly as described. It was very clean and quite spacious for a single traveler like me. The kitchen is equipped with plates, silverware, and cooking utensils to make simple meals. The washer and dryer are a big plus. The neighborhood is quiet and centrally located for any day trips you may take throughout the Seattle area."
1851863,18324115,2014-08-25,18059584,Jenna,"We had a great stay in Susanna's home near Greenlake. It was a short drive away from the park and easy access to other Seattle neighborhoods. Her home was spare and minimal, but very clean and comfortable. Communication with Susanna was great and she was always available if we needed anything. Thanks Susanna!"
1851863,19398508,2014-09-11,14275030,Chris,"Susanna was awesome as a host, easily reachable and attentive. The place was very clean and comfortable as well. I enjoyed my stay and would stay again. Only downside is that you must drive to any of Seattle's attractions. "
1851863,19639518,2014-09-15,3237962,Paul,"We arrived via rental car, easy to find , right off a main road, only 15 to 20 min from Seattle.  The place was very clean, kitchen had what you needed(all most) expect small things like sugar and condiments  which would have been nice. No TV, which we did not need but it would be a nice addition. We were there in Sept so no heat wave but it was a little warm, and unfortunately there is no a/c, but I think that is the norm in the north west coast. Otherwise it really isn't a walking around type of neighborhood,  you really need to drive to a nicer part of town. Green lake is close by and we did go there twice for a walk. It's also convenient to ferry service just 20 min further north. Overall can't complain about anything.  Easy check in and check out."
1851863,20141141,2014-09-24,7100136,Barbara,"This is a very pleasant and comfortable space, with plenty of room and a kitchen with everything you need.  (Although who cooks when there are so many wonderful places to eat nearby?)  Near a main street, but very quiet.  Suzanne welcomed me by maing sure there was coffee in the kitchen, and was always ready to provide information and guidance about things to do and how to get to them by public transportation.   No TV, but the WiFi made it easy to stream things on my laptop.  "
1851863,20249994,2014-09-26,14609494,Steve,"We loved staying at Susanna's place. The apartment was clean, fully equipped, functional, quiet, very comfortable and in a great location. Susanna was there to meet us as planned and gave us a warm welcome. I will look forward to staying here again on my next Seattle visit. "
1851863,22561891,2014-11-09,23187995,Karin,"Susanna was very welcoming and showed me around the place when I showed up to check in. The place was exactly as cute as pictured and provided a comfortable private sanctuary for the weekend. it had a fine sized kitchen, washer and dryer, great bathroom, and comfortable bed. "
1851863,26125232,2015-02-04,4428168,Justine,Susanna was a wonderful and generous host. The apartment itself had everything I needed and was very comfortable.
1851863,32164313,2015-05-15,28481875,Brian,Susanna is great.  The place is awesome.  I had trouble one day getting network access and she came over and fixed my computer.  The apartment is quiet and has easy access to downtown.  I wish I could have stayed longer.
1851863,42815391,2015-08-16,27103216,Staci,"Susanna was a wonderful host and this apartment was great. I stayed here for three months during the summer and I was very comfortable. Susanna was there to welcome me on the first day and she was attentive throughout my stay. When the weather got unusually hot she checked in to see if the apartment was still comfortable and offered to provide me with a fan. The apartment was clean, the bed was comfortable, and the kitchen was good sized. The neighborhood seemed quiet and safe even though it's by a main street. There are some great shops just a few blocks away on Greenwood Ave, and there's super easy bus access right to the heart of downtown. I would definitely stay here again if I return to Seattle!"
1851863,44899069,2015-08-30,315433,Bob,"Susanna was very gracious to adjust our check in time when our flight was twice delayed. She provided clear instructions verbally and in written form. She was readily available had we needed anything but never intruded during our visit. The guest house was clean, neatly furnished and exactly as advertised. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will recommend Susanna's place to our friends. "
1851863,46297814,2015-09-09,682401,Alan,"Really, Really lovely place; it was perfect, actually; an absolute bargain for the price - and the photos don't do it justice.  I mean SO nice, in ways both large (the onsite washer/dryer is a huge plus; made it possible to live a whole week out of just a carry-on) and small (really nice bath fixtures, bedding, coffee & tea, current bus schedule, Wi-Fi boosted & worked flawlessly).  Great location; quiet street, friendly neighbors, trivial to get downtown on the E-line and inexpensive to cab anywhere around.  Most of all Susanna's just a lovely person - so warm and welcoming and kind (when I'd needed that for my week) - as well as a great host:  Makes sure you have & know everything you need - and if you need anything else, she's right next door - and beyond that, leaves you to your privacy / solitude aside from friendly waves and/or quick chats whenever passing one another in the driveway on the way in or out.  Really couldn't have been happier or more thankful to Susanna for this stay - and apologies for not having left her a bottle of wine as I'd intended to say thanks (I'd been offered a lift to the airport and had to take it while the getting had been good).  If she'll have me again, though:  Next time :-)"
1851863,47343613,2015-09-18,30661711,Steve,"Susanna provided a clean and comfortable duplex property.  We felt welcome and secure in her rental unit.  We loved the hardwood floors and bright interior space.  The on-site parking was very nice because the adjacent residential street was often full of parked cars.  Access to the duplex was easy, just 1/2 block off the main street, but the commercial street was very busy so the city noise was ever present.  We enjoyed our stay and would love to visit Seattle again."
1851863,48002610,2015-09-22,23107183,世暐,Good place Will definitely book again if I have the chance to visit Seattle
1851863,48571323,2015-09-27,2014862,Donna,Had a wonderful stay. Our Seattle home away from home.
7161725,39084348,2015-07-20,17301135,Jane,"We had a wonderful stay with Theodora in Ballard! She was very welcoming and gave us lots of great recommendations for breakfast, (which we were glad we took) and things to do. He also gave us complete privacy. We had bottled water and all bathroom necessities as well as closet and dresser space to put our things. 

Her space  consisted of two bedrooms and a bathroom on the ground floor. One of the bedrooms had a single bed, which we didn't need, but we used the desk in the room and the space to put our things. The double bed in the our bedroom was very comfortable and we had a great night sleep. The space was air-conditioned, which was very welcome in the heat. We walked to Ballard's shops and restaurants (about 10 min walk) yet were away from hustle and bustle.

What a nice vacation! We would definitely stay with Theodora again."
7161725,39841812,2015-07-26,38440497,Reuben,This home is so much nicer than appears in photos. The two bedrooms were perfect for our stay. Theodora made sure we had everything we needed. Two thumbs up!! Oh and there's an awesome taco shop across the street. 
7161725,41164546,2015-08-04,29343542,Steven,"This is good experience for me to first time using Airbnb, i arrive Seattle at early of morning and Thea just wait me at home although normal check in at afternoon. We have 2 rooms with provide bathroom, Thea also give us introduce of the attraction place nearby, thanks Thea."
7161725,42057305,2015-08-10,25663556,Marko,"My friend and I were desperately looking for a place to stay during a busy week in Seattle. Luckily we stumbled upon Thea's and Bruce's condo through the website. 

The condo is structured with the master bedroom/kitchen/living area are on the second floor while two bedrooms and a bathroom are on the first level. We were greeted graciously by the hosts Thea and Bruce and their cute dog Sophie! One bedroom (the one i used) had a twin sized bed, a desk and a tv. The bed was a little small for someone of my stature but regardless i had a great night sleep. The only critique i could have for the room was that this room probably needs black out curtains if you are someone who is easily woken up by the sunlight.

The other room had a double bed, storage/closet space with blackout curtains. Because we came in August the weather was phenomenal and during the night it was perfect temperature for sleeping.The bathroom and bedrooms were all very clean, and Thea provided towels when needed. 

Ballard has to be the nicest neighborhood within Seattle. It had so many foodie restaurants, bars and options for the weekend. The condo was less then a mile away from the main street.

Overall the experience was amazing, i would highly recommend using Thea & Bruce for your Seattle vacationing! "

The home was just as pictured, clean and well kept. Please don't let the twin bed discourage you! It was super comfy! 
There is plenty to do within walking distance and we felt very safe just walking around even after daylight hours. The city is just a short ride away! We enjoyed our stay very much and can't wait to go back!"
7161725,44342135,2015-08-25,30148145,Roy,Theodora was a lovely host arranging our arrival even as she flew home from Europe. She is helpful and knows the neighborhood well enough to recommend two great places we could walk to for breakfast. The two bedrooms and bathroom are small yet comfortable and private.

The apt is just as it was shown in the photos, clean and well equipped. 
Perfectly located just out of downtown, and very walkable to downtown attractions like the Seattle Central Library, a marvel of modern architecture and design. "

The apartment was clean, beautiful and exactly as it was displayed in the picture. This place was super awesome and in an awesome location. I walked everywhere including the convention center, space needle/EMP/Chiluly Garden and Glass."

The apartment was clean, tidy and well appointed and had everything you could need. Eve made us feel very welcome and understood exactly what we needed and how to make a guest feel comfortable and free of worry. "
5372156,39669074,2015-07-25,6313242,Laura,"My husband and I had a very comfortable stay at Eve's place in Seattle. Eve met us at the building and was very accommodating about our schedule. The apartment was clean, spacious and well appointed and the bed was divine! There is a sweet little coffee shop right next door to the building that was our go-to breakfast spot before starting our days exploring the city. We look forward to another stay when we return in the future and hope this apartment home will be waiting for us. "
