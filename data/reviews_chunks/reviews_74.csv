Although our bedroom is quite close to the nieghbour's, it's quiet in the day and night. The futon is comfortable and cozy. The private bathroom is next to the bedroom. We have a wonderf experience here. Look forward to the next stay at Craig's house!"
6424859,37068128,2015-07-04,28433045,Bingwei,"Second stay in Craig's place. Clean, quite, and comfortable as alaways. Good choice for couple who needs privacy and good location in Seattle."
6424859,37487619,2015-07-07,6015035,Brian,"Craig is an excellent  host.  All messages were returned very quickly, with helpful information.  His house is very tastefully decorated, clean and inviting, and the location in the middle of Capitol Hill was perfect for me.  I had a car for my visit, but it's kind of tricky to park in that area of town.  If you don't need a car, I certainly wouldn't hassle with renting one.  I hadn't been to Seattle in many years, and Craig was very helpful in orienting me to the city, and happily answered any question I had.  I would not hesitate to stay here again  if my travels come back towards Seattle."
6424859,38305524,2015-07-14,26757515,Matt,Craig was a fantastic host. He was super friendly and had everything ready ready for my arrival. He also was very helpful with advice on things to do around seattle and was always checking up on me to make sure my stay was enjoyable. His place was very accessible and within walking distance to many sights in downtown. I would definitely choose to stay with craig again if I travel back to seattle!
6424859,38652362,2015-07-17,19727685,LiAng,"Craig is very nice. The house is beautiful, room is small but clean. Location is great, less than 10 mins driving to UW or downtown. Overall it is very good！"
6424859,39682452,2015-07-25,38383293,Tracey,This was my first airbnb experience and I don't know how any other stay could beat it!  Craig was a fantastic host and I feel as if I have a new friend in Seattle.  His home is absolutely beautiful and so clean and neat.  The bed was so comfortable and I enjoyed having a private bath.  Craig suggested activities and places to go and was kind enough to drop me off at the Pike Market one day.  Five stars plus!
6424859,40125973,2015-07-28,35980383,Alexis,"This was my very first time using Airbnb, so I was a little nervous.  Craig kept in touch throughout the week leading up to our arrival with all the instructions we'd need for entry and parking.  We had an early flight and got to Craig's house before check-in (and by that I mean I barged into his house!), but Craig let us leave our luggage while we explored and he got things ready.  He was very welcoming and gave us great tips on using the transit in the city, places to visit, places to eat, and fun things to do.  He even lent us some umbrellas to use. The bed is very comfortable, and the bathroom shower has a great shower head!  Craig was a wonderful host and does everything he can to make you feel comfortable.  I would highly recommend him!"
6424859,40388372,2015-07-30,21267927,Jeffrey,"Craig was fantastic. His home was very clean and neat. Check in was incredibly well organized which was great since I was unfamiliar with the area. 

Craig provided street-side parking which is impossible to find in Seattle, and I was free to come and go as I pleased. Check out was painless as well. I highly recommend staying with Craig if you are in the area. Location and accommodations are fantastic."
6424859,40548293,2015-07-31,39481484,Alberto,Great experience with this stay! First time using this and he was a great host. Great price for the location. Would use this location again if i were to return. 
6424859,40977025,2015-08-03,26797801,Jeffrey,"I stayed at Craig's place for three days this summer, and it was fantastic. Communication from Craig was frequent and extremely clear. He also went out of his way to recommend things to do around Seattle.

The condo itself is great, and in a fantastic neighborhood. There are lots of good restaurants, bars and shops that are within walking distance.

I'd definitely stay at Craig's place again."
6424859,41958982,2015-08-10,35236622,Zhipeng,This is my first time using Airbnb. Craig is very nice host. My experience at Craig's house is great. The room we stay is small but clean. The location is great. I would choose here again when I travel to Seattle next time.
6424859,42345663,2015-08-12,6549090,Deia,"Craig's house was clean and comfortable. It's also super convenient, with restaurants and shops just a few steps away. I love that the check in and check out times were flexible. There were clean towels and toiletries in the bathroom, and fresh sheets in the bedroom when I arrived. Highly recommended!"
6424859,42774943,2015-08-15,1386132,Naysawn,"Craig was a great host! His place was super clean, well located and super comfortable! 

Craig made the check in and check out process very seamless which is very appreciated. He let us leave our bags late to check out late and set his keypad with our lock to let us come in pretty late. 

Overall, I would highly recommend staying with him "
6424859,43273809,2015-08-18,20653949,Tara,"Craig set the bar incredibly high for our first Airbnb experience. He was a gracious host, greeting us warmly then leaving us to our privacy; the house was comfortable and clean, the price fair and the location excellent; then there were the little things: a basket of toiletries at the bathroom sink, fresh towels and sheets, and even space in the refrigerator. Easy check in and out, plenty of space for two, and just general ease and comfort. We appreciate how clearly thoughtful yet unobtrusive Craig is to his guests. His listing is ideal for a couple looking to spend some time in a very hip, non-touristy, and artsy part of Seattle. He was always quick to respond and understanding even when we made a booking error. Would recommend highly and would absolutely return! Thanks Craig! "
6424859,43734647,2015-08-21,41926758,Matthew,"Clean, convenient location, friendly host. Recommend!"
6424859,43995916,2015-08-23,18886471,Kevin,"Craig was a great host. He was very friendly and flexible during my stay, and was happy to give me advice on the neighborhood. I ended up checking in pretty late and it was no problem, Craig made it a breeze. The location is excellent, in a great neighborhood and just a short walk to Pike and Pine for great food and drinks. I highly recommend Craig's place for anyone traveling to Seattle."
6424859,44247379,2015-08-24,5576325,Liz,"Loved the room, a perfect launching point for Seattle.  Quiet, calm, lovely - Craig was super welcoming! Would definitely choose to stay here again when in the area.  Also my partner said the bed was more comfortable than ours and wants to buy a similar setup - don't be deterred by the futon listing! :)"
6424859,45389851,2015-09-02,39097868,Patrick,"Craig was a lovely host, his house is nestled in a quiet street of a nice area, the room and house were great, clean and warm and I couldn't have wished for a better experience staying there.
Craig was very helpful with giving tips and suggestions, and was always very kind and willing to hang out and chat while we made dinner.
I would highly recommend staying with Craig, it's an easy 25 minute walk from downtown and has easy bus access.
Thanks for having me Craig, see you again soon!
"
6424859,46627520,2015-09-12,9601391,Nick,Beautiful house in a really nice neighbourhood. Craig was a really accommodating and friendly host. Great experience. 
6424859,46995091,2015-09-14,43599525,Dinesh,"Craig is a great host, and made us feel comfortable straight away by giving a quick tour of the place. The place itself is great, as shown in the post, and quite conveniently located.  Having the parking permit in hand made it really easy for multiple stops and driving around the area. We will definitely keep this place in mind next time we visit Seattle.  Cheers"
6424859,48035029,2015-09-22,43877139,Jerome,"Craig was an awesome host...Great place in a prime location (bars, restaurants, shopping, etc.). We will definitely look this place up again next time we're in Seattle."
278830,1676200,2012-07-10,1908086,Meghann,"We had a great time staying here, very conveniently located with lots of space.
"
278830,1723159,2012-07-16,2771275,Renee,"Emily's home was beautfiul. It was so nice to be in a place that felt like home away from home. Highly recommended. I would definitely stay again!
"
278830,1922917,2012-08-08,2522428,Larry,We very much enjoyed our stay at Emily and Daniel's house in the Queen Anne area of Seattle. The house was perfect for our family and the neighborhood was conveniently located.  I highly recommend their house.
278830,2198628,2012-09-04,3307103,Nancy,"This house was awesome! We were not planning on cooking too much, but the kitchen was setup so well, that we ended up eating almost every meal in. It was also pretty convenient that Whole Foods was near by. We comfortably fit 6 co-workers into the 3 bed + 2 bath spaces. 

Our only small complaint was that the bed in the 3rd bedroom on the main floor isn't set up as nice as the other two rooms. Aside from that, it is exactly as described. Everything was easy to use and we were happy that recycling & composting were in place. 

It isn't located downtown, but we took cabs into town for around $12.00. Pretty cheap when split amongst several people. It was pretty easy to get to downtown when driving as well. 

We would definitely stay here again.    "
278830,5956274,2013-07-23,7499010,Vickie,"We loved Emily's beautiful, sunny home! And my son especially loved the muffins waiting for us. Thank you!"
278830,6241736,2013-08-05,6671871,Christina,"Great house. A little tight but effective use of space. Kind of bummed the backyard was under construction but the deck with firepit more than made up for it.
Very nice host!!"
278830,9439553,2013-12-29,8820586,Vanessa,Emily's house is lovely!  Very quaint and a great location.  It was everything we hoped it would be and Emily was very helpful!  I would definitely stay there again!
278830,11823906,2014-04-16,14088521,Shane,The reservation was canceled 118 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
278830,12867702,2014-05-12,3553609,Todd,"Thanks so much!
The house is beautiful and cozy.
Emily was very accommodating!

"
278830,14290105,2014-06-16,10936049,Morgan,"Emily was fantastic! She kept her distance yet made her help clearly available. The home was clean, comfortable, and easily accessible. Emily exhibited great communication and a friendly misdemeanor. The pictures don't do the home justice. It was roomy and well accommodating for our group of 3. "
278830,15325980,2014-07-07,15899919,John,"We loved the unique design features of the house and the personal touches left by the owners. The photo books outlining the restoration and remodeling were a hit and the photos with toddler Oliver got several cute comments. We especially enjoyed the top floor deck and proximity to whole foods. There were plenty of linens and pillows for the six of us and fresh flowers, fruit and pastries were left for us upon arrival.  Emily and Daniel were quick to respond for any issue in a prompt and professional manner. We felt at home here and all of us were very comfortable during the stay."
278830,17434707,2014-08-12,12772367,Kevin,"Emily did a great job with communication before and during our stay. 
The house was terrific and very comfortable for our family. Whole Foods was a 3 minute walk from the house which was incredibly convenient when we needed supplies to cook our finds from Pike Place Market. I would highly recommend Emily's house. "
278830,18417248,2014-08-26,8606278,Joe,"Before actually booking this place; the photos alone had me at [wow!] + then when I arrived + saw the full details in person; I was in love.

I have a soft spot in my heart for great interior design that is very modern but also very welcoming + warm at the same time.

Our host Emily was very professional + welcoming of my guest + I although we never met in person but I could tell that she wanted to make sure our stay was as grand as possible :D"
278830,18876858,2014-09-02,13600776,Zee,"This was a perfect little house for our yearly girlfriend getaway with 6 adults.  The location of this house was perfect to enjoy Seattle, close to all the attractions as well as fabulous restaurants.  "
278830,19280832,2014-09-09,19916127,James,"This house was so perfect for our needs and the hosts were very thoughtful in their editing of furnishings and food.  They left us fresh flowers, fruit, coffee, half and half, orange juice and pastries.  The bed in the master bedroom was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on in my life.  Furthermore, I'd say that the master bedroom itself was perhaps the nicest that I've experienced.  The bedroom's big windows made for an urban en pleine air sleeping nirvana.  Plus, the deck outside the bedroom was fantastic for lounging in the late afternoon sun.  

The owners have made unique and creative alterations to the layout of the house, with the kind of small and thoughtful high/low design considerations that made our stay not just comfortable, but inspiring. 
Also, the location in Seattle, is central and convenient.  Perfect.  Thank you! "
278830,20424857,2014-09-29,11729192,Erica,"My family had a great stay, everything was comfortable."
278830,20591036,2014-10-01,4915157,Emilio,It is great place to stay at to take up morning exercises
278830,21300212,2014-10-14,21186276,Kayla,"There were 6 of us that stayed here for the weekend - and it was the perfect size! There were 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms which was ideal. The house is located in Queen Anne which was perfect to get around. It was great to have street parking out front to be able to get in and out. The house was clean and well maintained which made our stay enjoyable. The only downside was the construction going on next door that started rather early in the morning. Good thing this was only on our last day as it would not have been ideal to occur over our 3 day stay.

I would definitely stay here again in the future - Emily was a great host and I really appreciated that she allowed us to drop off our luggage before our check in time so that we could site see around the city without our luggage. "
278830,21331120,2014-10-15,11600814,Kelsie,The reservation was canceled 10 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
278830,21732387,2014-10-22,8593248,Devon,"After an incredibly last minute request, Emily was so accommodating and helpful in making our trip a success. The house is beautiful. Three, large bedrooms, great views from the deck, always easy to get an Uber. She even left us pastries, fruit, and local coffee for our arrival, not to mention fresh flowers. It was a perfect trip. "
278830,24304917,2014-12-25,2829726,Lawrence,We had a great stay at this lovely home. Great kitchen and living room.  Close to Whole Foods and nice walk to Queen Anne neighborhood. More than enough space for our family of 4.  Emily was responsive and hospitable.
278830,24534007,2014-12-30,2186194,Matthew,"Charming well restored heritage house in Queen Anne area of Seattle. Love the feel and motiff of the house. We stayed for 2 nights and had 6 adults 2 kids and 1 infantnin our group. Emily was kind enough to accommodate futons for the kids and were prepared prior to our arrival.

Some construction noise in the morning but if its a weekend its not a problem.  

Would love to stay here again in the future.

"
278830,24933131,2015-01-04,3422084,Nicolas,"Excellent and big house! We found inside almost everything we needed, expect for washing machine that was out of service! Neighborhood was nice but a little bit far from the city centre! Thanks! "
278830,26124569,2015-02-03,6281689,Jenny,The reservation was canceled 72 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
278830,29847978,2015-04-13,7017892,Lynn,We had a lovely stay. The house was as good as the description. A great view from the back deck and easy to get to everything we needed. 
278830,32579954,2015-05-19,32092763,Eric,"Our host was very friendly and provided us with all the information we needed for the house, which was a charming old (but nicely renovated) house in the Queen Anne neighborhood. It had a partial view of the water and was very comfortable - it worked out perfectly for our stay."
278830,32784726,2015-05-21,19632256,Eryka,Emily's home is lovely and is just as pictured and described. The home is comfy and very tastefully decorated. Proximity to grocery store is convenient and neighborhood is beautiful to walk through!
278830,33340688,2015-05-26,23270070,Nathan,"This place was truly amazing. It was close to downtown, and different areas of town, and it made that much easier to get around. This place made you feel at home and it was very nice and peaceful. "
278830,35302551,2015-06-17,5444050,Jim,Our host was very helpful in addressing our practical concerns and the house was conveniently located between downtown and the university district. It is also very convenient to Ballard and Fremont with their restaurants and shopping as well as that of Queen Anne Avenue. The house is very comfortable and accommodated our family well for its visit to Seattle. Be sure to check out the views from the end of 10th Avenue further up the hill and from Bhy Kracke Park.
278830,35800054,2015-06-22,31982792,Kirk,"Emily was very friendly and responsive to any questions we had regarding the home.  The house was very clean and offered great views from the top deck.  All essential items we needed for our stay were provided at the house and made our stay an enjoyable experience.  If planning on renting this home, just double check to find out if construction has ended as the building next door is being built.  Overall, the house was perfect for our family of 5 to stay at for 4 nights.  "
278830,36541460,2015-06-29,32274083,Jennifer,"There were fresh flowers waiting for us, which was nice and welcoming. There was ample parking and the location was convenient. This was a great base for our girls weekend. The house is cute and comfortable!"
278830,37842588,2015-07-11,30915483,Richard,"It's a cute house in a convenient location to everything.  Parking along the street was never a problem, even returning late at night.   Emily was a wonderful and responsive host.   Our family of 6 had a great stay while visiting!"
278830,38163066,2015-07-13,4096896,Danielle,"Emily was a great host. We had scones waiting for us, which was such a kind and welcoming gesture. The house was so adorable and perfect for our girls weekend! Loved the open living and kitchen area for cooking and gathering. "
278830,38594861,2015-07-17,4718617,Ashley,Adorable house in convenient location. I loved having Whole Foods so close! Nice balcony and cute patio. Emily was a pleasure to deal with and we didn't have any issues!
278830,38935780,2015-07-19,17271839,Renna,"This home was absolutely charming with the cutest family [from the pictures within]! Check-in was a breeze. Blueberry scones & fresh flowers were waiting in the house. Plenty of street parking & the contruction next door wasn`t a bother to me at all. A wonderful stay for my girlfriends & I, I`d definitely consider for a future stay when we`re in Seattle again!"
278830,46315539,2015-09-09,40721044,Stanley,"The house looked exactly as it was in the picture and even better. I loved the fact that there was a patio on the upper deck that had a nice view in the morning and night. The house was very modernized for an older house. I loved the decor of the house. It's quite spacious and well kept. 

Emily was really helpful and accommodating. Even though she couldn't personally welcome us, she left us a note and delicious muffins! I definitely will be coming back to this house next time!"
278830,49923321,2015-10-07,21089585,Chris,Great space - great host. Everything as noted and central to lots of great Seattle sites and things to do. Highly recommended.  
278830,51792189,2015-10-24,1090184,Brice,Emily's house was great! It was just as listed & worked perfect for our needs.
4264056,23916017,2014-12-14,23548526,Mark,"Check-in was simple and quick! The room was pretty sparse but the essentials were all there which was great. The kitchen sink was filthy and was on the checklist so I cleaned it so the owner wouldn't think that I did it. The kitchen and fridge were great but I didn't use either. The location was perfect for walking to the major sites around Seattle like the space needle, pacific science center, and pikes market. "
4264056,24196854,2014-12-22,424358,Heidi,"The room was fine for the two of us for one night. The kitchen sink was clogged up, so we didn't end up getting to do any cooking - but Lori warned us that morning before check in."
4264056,24309134,2014-12-25,7184773,Don,The location is quite ideal nestled between 4 star hotels and only about 4 blocks from Pikes Place. Check in and check out went swimmingly. Though the building is quite old which offer the good and bad of that. On the Airbnb spectrum of hotel to homey I would say it falls more firmly into the hotel slot.
4264056,24430101,2014-12-28,7120347,Aditya,"Loved this small downtown studio. The location is perfect if you want to explore downtown Seattle. Pike Place Market is just a few block away. Although we didn't get to meet Lori, everything was setup perfectly on our arrival. We had absolutely no problems checking in and out."
4264056,24855907,2015-01-03,24264948,Samantha,"My fiancee and I could not have asked for a better location to stay in Seattle! We were right in the heart of the Seattle hustle and bustle, there is a grocery/deli across the street which was incredibly handy! Minutes walk to fabulous restaurants in Belltown, the Monorail, Pikes Place Market and downtown  We parked our car and didn't need to use it till we left! Lori our host was very helpful letting us know about parking and check-in was very easy! The apartment itself added to our amazing stay in Seattle, it was old school but very homey and romantic! I would happily stay there again if Lori would have us! I will recommend this apartment to anyone and everyone! "
4264056,25394638,2015-01-14,9810231,Ruth,Great location.  Easy to get around and a lot to do in the surrounding area.  The apartment was pretty sparse but it had the essentials. There is no Wi-Fi or TV but that made me explore more.  We coudlnt figure it out how to get the heat to work but stayed warm anyways.  The only thing that was wrong that it was a little bit dusty. 
4264056,25502486,2015-01-18,24248290,Trang,"The location was PERFECT. We took the Link in from the airport and it was only a 5 min walk to the apartment. All the touristy things were within a 15 min walking distance of the apartment. We decided to rent a car our second day there to explore the rest of Seattle (the car rental place was only a 5 min walk!)

Lori was an amazing host. She promptly answered all my questions before arriving and she continued to be available for us throughout our entire stay. "
4264056,25631404,2015-01-21,24455828,Eric,"Lori made our whole experience of finding and staying in a place in downtown Seattle super simple. Very clear listing, very flexible and willing to communicate, and simple procedure for picking up and dropping off the keys. The location along with the price tag attached cannot be matched. This will likely be the best bang for your buck that you will find downtown!"
4264056,25717438,2015-01-24,4491324,B.,"The apartment was great, and Lori is so awesome, helpful, and friendly.  It was just steps from the tram, so getting to and from the airport was easy.  The location is right downtown and close to lots of fun things (museums, library, food,pubs....) I felt safe and slept well. I will be back."
4264056,25845580,2015-01-27,4359003,Laura,The description pictures were accurate. The instructions given for check-in and check-out were clear and straight-forward. The host was also able to reply back promptly on her phone. You might want to bring slippers for the cold floor tiles. There was no cleaning fee so the place had to be tidied up afterwards. 
4264056,26104052,2015-02-03,17157781,Melinda,"The location is fantastic! I had never been to Seattle before, so I wasn't sure exactly where to stay, but I really lucked out with this place. Bars, restaurants, Pike Place market, the Space Needle, and Seattle Center are all in walking distance. The space itself was pretty cool because it's in a restored historic building, but I think I might have enjoyed it more on a shorter stay. The original Murphy bed was not so comfortable by the fourth night! Overall, the price was right and the location was unbeatable so I'm really happy I stayed here."
4264056,26684242,2015-02-17,25705293,Trisha,"Location and Price are a hit, everything else is  a miss. 
Location: The location of this apartment is ideal.  It is within walking distance to several restaurants, Pike’s Market, and, if you are in shape, the Space Needle.  There is a Metro bus just around the corner (download the app to figure how to get around) but there are plenty of restaurants and movie theaters within walking distance.  
The Room: We chose this place because of the age (pre-war) and expected features characteristic to it.  We were not disappointed, this room has high ceilings with beautiful molding, unique closets and a charming claw foot tub.  However, this is not a home but an empty apartment (perhaps awaiting rental?).  The space is sparce and provides the barest basic needs.  If you are looking for a place that is cozy with the comforts of home (typical of an AirBnB or a Bed and Breakfast), this is not it.  This place lacks a couch, coffee maker, or even a throw rug. The room has NO ambiance.   Despite the urban/downtown location, it is a quiet room.  However, the pipes in the corner of EACH room transport hot water (radiators?) and crackle and pop every hour on the hour, loud enough to wake you EVERY HOUR.    Unfortunately, to sum it up this room was grimy.  The baseboards and floor edges were soiled/dusty, the dish drainer was dirty and the tub and toilet were unclean and required scrubbing (by me).    
The Host:  We never met Nick the host, but he promptly provided extra towels and cleaning supplies upon request.  He left us a bottle of wine.

4264056,26827971,2015-02-20,26404155,Michele,"This was a great first time with AIRBNB.
The whole process from booking to checking out was awesome. 
A great value, a perfect location.
Nick was great. He was there when we checked in and was helpful with communication throughout the process."
4264056,27054248,2015-02-24,17694631,Thekla,"Nick was prompt at getting our room heated up- it was freezing when we arrived but the heating in the building had went out.  The building is clean but very old with steam/heat radiator which I have only seen in the movies.  The pipes made all kinds of awful noise during the night which resulted in a huge lack of sleep.  Parking was an issue, before arriving I asked about parking and was told it was $4 an hour on the street or discounted daily rate across the street.  We were not told street parking was free on the weekends - which we were staying Sat-Mon, until after was paid for a garage.  The garage was better anyway since the location was shady once we walked around.  There also isn't a coffee pot, BUT Moore Coffee down the street is amazing and they make cute animals in the foam.
"
4264056,27334784,2015-03-02,15393870,Raquel,"Great location. Across the street from a delicious bakery and only a 5-10 minute walk to Pike's Place. Safe area, well-lit at night. The building itself leaves a little bit to be desired. It was small, which we didn't mind, but it was very old. The bed and floorboards were creaky, walls were paper thin (we could hear our neighbors talking) and whenever water moved through the pipes (ie. someone showering), it sounded like banging pots / pans near our head. Hard to sleep. But... can't complain too much given the price. And more importantly, the towels were clean. "
4264056,27444970,2015-03-04,28197327,Brooke,"The location couldn't be better – especially for the price!  Very close to the water and the market, great food, and nightlife!  The building was safe and fairly quiet, and the apartment had everything we needed for the weekend.  One word of warning is that the apartment is creaky and squeaky.  If you’re a light sleeper, you might want to bring along a little fan or noise machine.  Otherwise, it was great!"
4264056,27500180,2015-03-06,27078735,Kanika,"The best thing about this listing is the location. It is quite close to the Waterfront and Pike's Place market as well as many restaurants. It is also only a few blocks from the public transport including monorail to the Space Needle. The apartment itself is on the smaller side but it was perfect for our two day stay. It was clean and well-stocked. The maps and other information about Seattle were a nice touch.
Overall it was a great experience. "
4264056,27639747,2015-03-09,24599152,Ellice,"My husband and I enjoyed a marvelously sunny weekend in Seattle. Nick was a great host-- he was always timely in communicating, provided clear instructions regarding how to pick up the keys, and was very accomodating as my husband and I arrived after 11pm. 

Pros: Location! Perfect downtown location with easy walking distance to all of Seattle's great sites (space needle, museums, pike market place, restaurants, etc.). Price-- affordable. 

Cons: The apartment is very old.-- the building is very old and charming, however, all of the appliances/amenities are very old/rusty. The pictures listed make the apartment appear larger and nicer than it was.  The bed was only a full size and very lumpy/little support/squeaky, with the head of the bed in a closet. For this reason, you could hear everything. We would go to sleep and be woken up very early by banging and clanging. In addition, at least for Verizon users, little to no reception.

"
4264056,27897769,2015-03-14,3626961,Grant,Great location downtown!  Historic charm and a comfortable Murphy bed to boot.  Nick was a pleasant host who was nice enough to accommodated our late arrival
4264056,28083997,2015-03-17,27552224,Alexis,Great location. Clean and cozy apartment. Nick was very helpful. 
4264056,28385855,2015-03-23,26112601,Lisa,"I would definitely recommend the apartment if you're in Seattle for a few days and looking for a cheap place to stay. Great downtown location, only a few steps away from pike place market and the waterfront but it's quite noisy at night and could have been cleaner. Nick was quite helpful and always answered promptly."
4264056,28524065,2015-03-25,175077,Sharon,"Nick was easy to communicate with, had an easy time of getting in and out on my timeline. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the building and heating itself are old and loud with the usual, but notable, banging and squeaking. It is indeed a basic, and well-located, apt."
4264056,28776996,2015-03-30,25052379,Jacob,"Great communication with Nick and his assistant prior to and during the stay. Very easy check-in process. The apartment was clean, and is also a bit more spacious than in looks in the pictures. Great experience overall!"
4264056,29037499,2015-04-03,26188451,Rosalie,"Nick was a good host, quick to answer and kind enough to let us be a little bit late. I agree with the other reviews that the apartment is a bit creaky and loud pipes, but that's what comes with an old building. Maybe bring a small blanket next time since the space heater doesn't work that great. Other than that, I loved my stay. Its really close to Pike's and a lot of small bars. I would definitely stay here again."
4264056,29912247,2015-04-14,26295996,Brandon,our stay was wonderful. Amy was very quick to respond and was even nice enough to let us check in early. The place itself is in a great location central to to pretty much everything I was interested in. The apartment is older but  very clean. I would stay here again.
4264056,30441573,2015-04-22,3492951,Valerie,"Great, basic apartment in a good downtown location. Agree with other reviewers that it's a bit loud (old building/creaky pipes), so bring ear plugs! I was in town for a conference, so I wasn't around in the daytime too much and it was nice to have an affordable place to crash. Good communication with Amy and super easy checking in/out, which I appreciated. "
4264056,30754720,2015-04-27,25110425,Peter,"Everything about this airbnb experience was fantastic from start to finish.  Amy wrote ahead of time with clear instructions about how to pick up the keys.  Since our flight arrived earlier than the check-in time, Amy was wonderful and met us early/held onto our bags until the apartment was ready so that we could begin exploring early.  The location is perfect, near the space needle, pike place market, ferry terminal, airport Link train, great wheel and stadiums.  We took the Link from the airport to the apartment and walked everywhere else on our trip, no taxis or car are needed at this apartment.  The neighborhood felt very safe and we were comfortable.  The apartment was stocked with what we needed, and definitely felt more homey than a hotel room, and at a much better price point than area hotels.  The entire place was clean when we arrived, and the building is quiet.  The apartment rocks, the location rocks and Amy rocks as a host.  We would definitely stay again and recommend to friends or family visiting Seattle."
4264056,30974820,2015-04-30,14133130,Carly,This is an awesome little apartment with a location you can't beat. Amy was quick to respond and very accommodating! I'd definitely stay here again.
4264056,31795270,2015-05-10,26019496,Preston,"Great location downtown Seattle in walking distance from everything! I recommend not bringing a car if at all avoidable because parking is crazy, but I was able to figure out that meters on the street in front of the building are free from 8pm-8am if you must.  

The apartment was clean and appeared as pictured.  Very old building so as expected the walls were pretty thin.  Only complaint was the noise from the water pipes at night.  Again, it is an old apartment building so I would recommend bringing some cheap ear plugs if you are at all bothered by noise.  

Other than that Amy was super nice and easy to get in touch with.  Check in and out were quick and easy and I would recommend staying here to those looking for a great deal on an apartment in the heart of downtown."
4264056,31988127,2015-05-12,32092467,Louis,"Nice apartment really well situated, I didn't even have to take the bus ! A bit old but not a real problem. Amy answered quickly and seemed nice although I didn't meet her. Maybe a wi-fi could be an improvement  idea for the apartment.
Would definitely recommend it if you're in Seattle for few days and need an ordinary place downtown."
4264056,32169768,2015-05-15,29657166,Sean,"The overall experience was good. The apartment is very well located within walking distance of downtowns shopping areas, Pike Place, and the Space Needle. Lots of amenities which I never used but good to have the option. Wish the bed wasn't as uncomfortable as it was but I'm not one to let something like that ruin my time. "
4264056,32492922,2015-05-19,18418095,Brent,Excellent location
4264056,32764432,2015-05-21,31542228,Adrian,"Amy's place was perfect! The location was right in the middle of everything you'd want to see or do in downtown Seattle. Even our local friend said we scored a sweet spot with the location. If you're looking for an affordable place to crash after a day of exploring Seattle, this is the place! The apartment included all the basic things you would need for a quick stay. Great location and price. The needle, pike place, emp, chihuly, top pot doughnuts, & the shopping district are all within walking distance. "
4264056,33069680,2015-05-25,18151416,Erin,My boyfriend and I had a good experience at Amy's place in Seattle. The place was a perfect size and true to the pictures. We didn't hang in the apartment very much but the space was clean and ready upon arrival. Entry/ departure procedures were very easy to follow. The location was perfect for us!
4264056,34623954,2015-06-10,297935,Summer,"The apartment is in a good location. We were able to walk many places, and catch public transport easily. There is no Internet, so be prepared to use data. The walls are very thin, so don't say anything you don't want others to hear. Overall, the apartment is a good price for the location. "
4264056,34776877,2015-06-12,31052485,Lucie,"This apartment is in a great location and is quite roomy, but we would've benefited from having wifi, since we were international travellers and didn't have an American SIM for our phones. We knew this when booking but didn't realise how reliant we were on having it once we got to the States. The building is old and a little creaky, but we only stayed 2 nights, so it was ok. Easy to check in and out and Amy was great with communication. Definitely recommend based on location."
4264056,35197573,2015-06-16,27340293,Rachel,"This is a fantastic location and a great space to stay for 2!  The apartment was very clean and VERY quiet.  It's in perfect walking distance to ANYTHING you want to do in Seattle.

The instructions for getting in to the apartment were clear.  Amy was tough to get a hold of in the weeks prior to our reservation which left us a little anxious.  Luckily, everything worked out and we were very pleased with the space!"
4264056,36515964,2015-06-29,8542183,Tarun,"""Fantastic downtown location!"" - as the title says, the only thing this place has going for it is the location. 

- Floors were horribly sticky as though someone dropped goo all over, every step we took a step our flip flops would unstick off the floor - messaged Amy to re-clean but she was out/busy/unresponsive. She claimed that at 130pm it was fine, we entered at 2pm and it was impossible to walk barefoot anywhere. This lasted both days.  -1 star

- Amy was not quick to respond to our requests/concerns/messages and never picked up her phone. She also did not meet us upon check-in while we waited at the restaurant outside.  -1 star

- The weather was very hot and there was no fan provided in the apartment. Amy offered to provide one but did not inform us when she would drop by and missed us. -1 star

You get what you pay for but for $100 a night, least we expected was a clean apartment. Would not stay again."
4264056,38108711,2015-07-13,168978,Stace,The stay work out really great for us. The location is fantastic close to everything you'd want to see. Post was extraordinarily responsive even getting us into the apartment early which helped us out after a long train ride. Would definitely stay here again.
4264056,38581373,2015-07-17,27842027,Kelsey,"We spent three nights here and it was perfect! The location was great, close enough to walk to the space needle and train stations, and in a nice downtown area. It was a lovely space with a rustic feel, we felt very comfortable in that cozy place. Would love to stay here again! "
4264056,38984316,2015-07-20,16346854,Lisa,"As stated before, prime location, low cost. "
4264056,39375332,2015-07-23,640745,Delite,Very true to description.
4264056,41058933,2015-08-04,6142376,Anneleen,"The location of this appartment is great: it is a five minute walk from Pike Place Market, and at walking distance from the Space Needle, downtown and Pioneer Square. 
Communication with Amy was efficient - everything went well. 
The appartment was clean, nicely decorated, convenient and spacious enough to put all your baggage. It is located in an impressive old building and definetely has a certain charm. However, we do feel that it needs a new mattress on the bed (the bed itself is beautiful, built-in) and a new bath (nothing charming about a very old bath).
Other than that, we had a wonderful stay in Seattle!"
4264056,41313156,2015-08-07,26957579,Owen,"exactly what we wanted - basic apartment in a great location. pike place market, the space needle and seattle art museum all within walking distance. perfect for a short stay in seattle!"
4264056,41919298,2015-08-10,26712438,Jannet,"The apartment is true to description and the location is prime! It's in an old building, a bit outdated, but clean. The flat felt a bit stuffy when I checked in but opening the windows solved the problem almost immediately. Overall a good value!!!

I didn't get to meet Amy in person but communication via texting worked well. Thanks Amy, for a pleasant stay!"
4264056,43684003,2015-08-21,14775330,Sarah,It was a pleasant stay and the apartment was very well located within a 10min walk to the Space Needle. The communication with Amy was easy and everything was taken care of when we arrived. Wifi will be offered in the near future - that would have made it perfect. We can recomment it. Thanks again for having us.
4264056,43935813,2015-08-23,26611849,Adrienne,"This was a great location! Check in and check out were a breeze. Accommodations were clean and simple, but definitely ""vintage"". It's a fair price, but you are mostly posting for the location, which was more than worth it to us."
4264056,44410897,2015-08-26,26690547,Joe,"It was cheap accommodation, it was in a good location a few blocks from the market, space needle and downtown. It was a bit grubby, but you can't really expect much more with the money you pay for it. It did the job!"
4264056,45239117,2015-09-01,11160330,Catalina,"We loved our stay!  The location could not have been better.  It was a great basecamp for our time in seattle;  easy access to pike place, space needle,  belltown and downtown!"
4264056,45484991,2015-09-03,34232213,Jessica,Amy was absolutely fabulous! She was incredibly accommodating and  very understating. Check in was very easy and the location is great!  I was in town for a wedding and was able to check in a little bit early and had to leave a little early as well. I left my necklace in the room so she will be mailing it back to me. 
4264056,46387474,2015-09-10,39386637,Melissa,"Listing was accurate- very convenient location. Easy check-in, easy check-out. Amy was available for questions, etc. "
4264056,47154256,2015-09-16,11058600,Melissa,The location of this place was the selling factor.  A bit grubby but it served all our basic needs as we weren't in the apartment much. Good for a weekend of exploring Seattle.
4264056,47372742,2015-09-18,40768340,Siegrid,"Die Lage der Wohnung war ideal, da wir mit dem Zug angereist waren.
Die Wohnung war mit dem nötigsten ausgestattet, im Badezimmer das Waschbecken mit Rostflecken, der Duschvorhang mit Schimmel. Wir wollten dort nicht duschen, hatten versucht den Schimmel zu entfernen. Kontakt zu Amy nur über Haustelefon zur Schlüsselübergabe. Ich hatte im Email nach Anreisemöglichkeiten vom Bahnhof zur Wohnung gefragt, bekam aber keine Antwort darauf."
4264056,47623307,2015-09-21,13369487,Francis,This is a very convenient apartment which is very near to Pike's market and a lot of restaurants around the corner as well.  The apartment though small is good for a couple with a kitchen and bathroom. Recommended
4264056,47963222,2015-09-22,36124474,Maryann,"I was getting uncomfortable at first since I hadn't heard back from Amy via Airbnb and finally called her.  Check in and Check Out were a snap.  I loved the place.  It is older as others have said, but I would stay there again in a heartbeat.  The location was central and you couldn't have asked for a cleaner place.    The brochures on the table of everything going on in Seattle was a great idea.  Somebody staying here should be aware that there is no TV and no coffee pot.   I almost went out to Target and bought a cheap coffee pot and would have left it.  I really didn't need the TV, but could see where it would have been nice on a really nasty night or to watch the news since there was no internet.   There is a great bakery and a grocery store across the street and a couple of restaurants in the same block.  Once I discovered them, the lack of coffee pot became a non issue.    The apartment is also an easy walk to Pike Place Market (5 or 6 blocks)...  "
4264056,49324304,2015-10-03,18321085,Roi,"Excellent location. Apartment offers everything, but note that there is no Wi-Fi at the current moment. 
I found that there is a good Wi-Fi connection in the adjacent restaurant (which is quite expensive), and also a free, very stable, Wi-Fi in the Macey's branch which is only 2 minutes walk away."
4264056,49875677,2015-10-07,7126137,Olivia,"Right in the heart of down town, we literally could walk anywhere! The value for this place is fabulous any hotel in this location would easily be 3x now. "
4264056,50087859,2015-10-09,33201330,Shane,"Great location! Walking distance from the market which was very convenient.
The place itself was a bit gloomy and it would be really nice if there was wifi provided.
Amy was a bit tough to get a hold of sometimes but she'd pick up every time you tried calling her directly."
4264056,51010678,2015-10-17,5352115,Angela,"Excellent location right in the heart of downtown Seattle. It was perfect if you're looking to walk around and explore the city and just need a place to crash at night, which is exactly what we did. Very cool, old school, historic building. "
4264056,53449725,2015-11-09,34316174,Kathleen,"The apartment was easy to find and as described. It did need a bit of airing out as most old buildings do. I was in town for a conference and, having been a former Seattleite, was planning to spend much of the days out and about so only needed a place to sleep. This was definitely a great value for the location - easy walk to the Convention Center, light rail, buses, and Pike Place Market. Check in and check out was very easy."
4264056,53882133,2015-11-14,17685970,Katherine,"Amy was a good host, check in was easy. The room was nothing fancy, bed was very squeaky, but a good place to sleep otherwise. The location was amazing. I would stay here again. "
4264056,54229029,2015-11-17,22264263,Vanessa,"Amy was extremely hard to get a hold of. She basically ignored us until the day of our reservation. I messaged her on Airbnb a week prior. I called and texted the day before with no response what so ever. We had never been to Seattle, and we had experienced a last minute cancellation with Airbnb previously, so it made us apprehensive. The location was great once we made it in.  "
4264056,54517910,2015-11-21,37561045,Luis,"Everything worked out perfectly during our air b&b trip.  When we arrived we called Amy as instructed, she immediately buzzed us in and we picked up the key in the designated pick up spot.  When we walked into our unit, everything was as expected.  The heater was turned on so the apartment was nice and warm.  We bought an umbrella at the airport but noticed one was provided along with miscellaneous toiletries.  We did not see Amy at all during our trip, but it was not necessary as we had everything we needed.  The location was great as it was walking distance from Pike Place Market, the waterfront, and other various bars in surrounding neighborhoods.  Check out was simple as the check out policy and procedures were clearly listed on the door.  Location is walking distance from the light rail to head back to the airport.  Awesome location and perfect for a couple exploring Downtown Seattle."
4264056,55678322,2015-12-04,38772517,Nick,"Amy was very easy to get a hold of and everything was as described in the unit. It was very clean and location couldn't be beat! 5 minute walk to the market and 15 minute walk to the space needle.  As others mentioned, no Wifi or TV so beware if you need to be connected! Only other thing missing was body wash or soap! Plenty of shampoos/conditioners, though."
4264056,56585864,2015-12-15,19711412,Paul,"Good location, easy communication with Amy. Thank you."
6590264,37266950,2015-07-05,25596781,Nick,"Pretty awesome place! Close to everything we need: Safeway, restaurants, clubs, cafes etc. 
Just 10 minutes away from Seattle downtown tourist zone (Space Needle as example of one of the most popular).
Kerry park, Google campus, different parks and access to ferry - everything is pretty close. Ow, and apartments itself are new, and it was pleasure to live there. Thanks, Tim."
6590264,37427476,2015-07-06,37099204,Will,"Tim was an amazing host. Not only was he extremely flexible with us on arrival and departure times for our stay, he prepped linens and maintained a very clean space for our one night stay in the Ballard area. His apartment complex was new and fresh and the interior decor presented a homey modern Seattle vibe. It was exactly what we were looking for!

Thanks so much Tim! We would definitely recommend you as host to any of our friends!

Will & Hannah"
6590264,42031678,2015-08-10,39556373,Michael,"Tim was a great host. Very easy to work with, and he had everything we needed. His place is terrific, great location. Walking distance to very nice restaurants and grocery stores. We will definitely stay there again."
6590264,45297911,2015-09-01,2168926,Linda,"This was a great apartment in the heart of Ballard-near a grocery store, shops, restaurant and bus line.  The place was very clean and had everything you could want.  We stayed a week and even the Seattle weather was great!"
6590264,53862327,2015-11-13,5870140,Favian,Tim greeted me and gave me a overview of the apartment. Everything was clean and in order. Right by downtown Ballard. Great place to stay
598023,6409632,2013-08-11,815392,Diego,Jeff is a very friendly host. We had the chance to go out together for lunch to the beach area and spend a great time!. Thank you Jeff for opening the doors of your house. And also a big hugh for Pilot your lovely dog. See you soon.
598023,16226260,2014-07-23,17930274,Juan,"Jeff was a very gracious host. The accommodations were exactly as expected, and Jeff made it feel like I was home by always providing anything I needed. The location is incredibly convenient, near the bus line that goes straight to downtown Seattle. There are also a high number of shops, restaurants and bars right around the corner."
598023,17483642,2014-08-12,3442361,Tobias,Very nice host! We had interesting conversations. Very nice bathroom :) Thank you Jeffrey! Hope to see you again.
598023,20268101,2014-09-26,21018389,John,I had a great time staying at Jeffrey's place.  He made me feel welcome and the location is unbeatable.  His dog Pilot is a great pup and the shower is borderline spa treatment.  All in all it was a very comfortable stay.  
598023,35503495,2015-06-19,25997493,Ann,"Jeffrey was a great host!  His house was gorgeous, just as depicted.  The bed was firm and comfortable.  Jeffrey was very friendly and welcoming, offering me info about living in / moving to Seattle, giving recommendations of where to eat in the neighborhood, offering to make me coffee, etc.  He was, at the same time, respectful of my privacy.  He was super responsive to my suggestions of ways to improve the lodging.  The neighborhood is also excellent, with tons of hip cafes/bars/shops/etc within a couple minutes' walking distance.  Pilot was a sweet dog - quiet, well-behaved, friendly.  I recommend this host and would gladly stay here again."
598023,36830039,2015-07-01,2036148,Chris,"Jeffs home is perfect for the chilled out Seattle experience! Plenty of cafes, restaurants, bars just round the corner and only 20 mins from downtown. Jeff was always willing to recommend stuff to do and more than happy to have a chat over a beer! Pilot (the dog) is also awesome company, would return in a heartbeat!"
598023,41462364,2015-08-07,39221558,George,"Jeffrey made me welcome from the second I signed up for his house. The listing description was accurate. You get what you see!

The neighborhood was nice. Minutes away from bus stop to city and plenty of stores and dine-in's nearby."

He has an amazing whippet dog, Pilot: very friendly and loving. 
Situated in a great location: West Seattle is peaceful and beautiful with a great vibe and a wide range of places to choose from to socialise locally, yet only about 25 mins by direct bus to Downtown.  Get the best of both worlds. "
1157083,5277248,2013-06-22,5652767,William,"Grace was a great host.  My flight came in a little bit late on Friday night, but she met me at the Elektra, walked me through and showed me all the details.  The main elevators are being renovated, so only one was working, but there is a freight elevator (its actually nicer inside than the main elevator).  The freight elevator only goes to the 4th floor (and above) but the back door of the building is on the 4th floor, and closer to Pike and the convention center than the front door.   The apartment was well appointed and very comfortable.  A colleague and I used the apartment as a base during a conference at the convention center, about a 3 minutes walk, and there was plenty of room for both of us."
1157083,5387908,2013-06-27,5492173,Lisa,"This condo is in a nice, safe location and not far from Pikes Place Market where we picked up ingredients to cook our dinners in the large condo kitchen which was fairly stocked for most cooking. Cleanliness was decent but not pristine. Grace was very kind and accomodating and explained everything well before leaving us to enjoy the very exciting Seattle city. "
1157083,8255227,2013-10-22,7488691,Christopher,Grace was a wonderful host and the condominium was very comfortable. Thank you so much! :)
1157083,9295970,2013-12-19,6412067,Kamala,Grace is super friendly. The condo is beautiful and is in an amazing location. 
1157083,10675052,2014-03-03,9966074,Sarah,"Grace's condo provided a clean, safe home away from home for myself and group of colleagues visiting Seattle for the first time for a convention. Our flight arrived at 1 o'clock in the morning but Doug was at the condo to great us when we arrived. The space is just as it looks in the pictures. The kitchen is a wonderfully nice space to socialize and unwind after a long day in the city. I was impressed with Seattle itself and our accommodations played a large role in that. "
1157083,12338397,2014-04-29,7207649,Mery,"WOW! This was perfect for us.  The place is clean, comfortable and cozy, next to the Convention center we were attending and we could have cook our own meals.  Safe for women traveling alone.  We are so happy that we coming back next year. It felt like being home in many ways. Thank you Grace for sharing your place.  Grace is a great host.   "
1157083,13088966,2014-05-19,5136929,Amelia & David,"In every way possible, Grace's 2 BR/2BA apartment is perfect.  3 of us stayed for over 1 week and loved every moment of it.  It is a spacious apartment with great views of the city and water with a fantastic kitchen located 1 minute walk from everything, we LOVED IT!  Grace and her family are wonderful hosts.  Thank you so much for having us,  we look forward to a future visit. "
1157083,13402611,2014-05-27,4735759,Adrienne,"Grace was super helpful and the apartment was fantastic. I've stayed at several airbnbs, and this place was probably my best experience. The apartment was clean, had all the amenities described, and was in a perfectly location between downtown and Capitol Hill. Grace was quick to respond to any questions. I and my friends would readily stay here again on our next trip to Seattle."
1157083,18870610,2014-09-02,6725239,Jake,"Grace was amazing.  Very friendly and accommodating.  The apartment is in an amazing location.   You can walk to Pike Place Market, the International District, and the Stadiums.  The roof has great views of city and is a nice place to have a beer and relax."
1157083,22886620,2014-11-17,18642523,Balázs,"Beautiful, spacious and very clean apartment. Very well equipped as well. The location is very convenient too. Couldn't ask for more!"
1157083,23364346,2014-11-30,21687549,Helen,Rachel and Grace made us feel very welcome.  They were reachable when we needed them to be.  The apartment was lovely and the neighborhood and neighbors were very friendly.  There is a small grocery store up at the top of the hill and they have everything you could possibly need to make a quick meal.  
1157083,25436866,2015-01-16,3466688,Ken,"Rachel & Grace were perfect hosts: readily in communications, kind, supportive and generous. 
The apartment is exactly as in the photos and it was ideal for our family stay in Seattle for a month over the year end holidays. The place is well - appointed, well - supplied, very comfortable, and most conveniently located. The latter was particularly appreciated since it's only a short walk to the downtown area for all the Christmas shopping we had to do. Also, grocery stores, restaurants, and other conveniences are all in the immediate area. We were frequent visitors to the famous Pike Street Market which is only a short walk away. If one happened to be in town for a convention, the Convention Hall is virtually on your doorstep.
Our hosts were even gracious enough to provide some delightful holiday ""goodies"" which was very thoughtful.
All in all, we couldn't have had a better place and better hosts for our family holiday experience."

1157083,28206111,2015-03-20,12374759,Zeyuan,"The location is perfect, space needle and pike place market are just nearby. The condo is nice and clean. We had 5 people and it's comfortable for us. Grace & Rachel are really nice people. They are responsible and helped us a lot. And luckily I can speak Chinese lol. The neighbor is also friendly. I went to Seattle for my spring break and it's a nice trip and experience. Thank you Grace and Rachel!"
1157083,28522660,2015-03-25,2845110,Joanne,"We had a great time at Rachel and Grace's condo!  We didn't have the pleasure of meeting Grace but Rachel is charming and an outstanding host; she was very accommodating and was only a text away when we had questions.  She gave us great recommendations for local eateries, etc.!   Their place is very comfortable, clean, well equipped, and within walking distance to many of Seattle's downtown attractions and public transportation.  We were sad to have to leave beautiful Seattle and would love to stay at their place next time (and there will definitely be a next time)!  By the way, the condo is actually more spacious than the pictures depict.  "
1157083,29963106,2015-04-15,17572131,Jodi,Rachel and Grace did a great job hosting and answered my many questions prior to and during my stay. The condo is spacious and nice. We were there attending a conference at the convention center and it could not have been any closer! The location of the condo is perfect for business or leisure! Everything is within walking distance. The kitchen in the condo is really big and nice. I will stay here everytime I'm in Seattle. Thank you Rachel and Grace for a wonderful stay!
1157083,45362999,2015-09-02,28352995,Adam,"Rachel and Grace are everything that is great about AirBnB. On a trip that was marred with cancellations, family issues, and roster changes, these two were incredibly understanding and flexible. Communication was great, and they were so nice! 
The apartment was GORGEOUS, and huge! Even the celebrities we ran into were jealous of the place. If you're looking for a place, stop here; you've found it!"
4231670,22405577,2014-11-05,21335663,Violet,"My boyfriend and I wanted a centrally located spot for our 5 day trip to Seattle.  This pad was very relaxing, clean and comfortable.  Tons of bars and restaurants walking distance, the neighbors all seemed young and cool and were friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend this spot,  very quaint and zen in a way."

Her place was comfortable, hip, and *extremely* walkable. The shower was temperamental - it seemed to be too hot or too cold - and the mattress was a bit soft for my taste."
4231670,24597902,2014-12-31,11390282,Sarah,"Great apartment! Super spacious, very clean and easy to walk to bars and restaurants. Emily was a great host and provided us with everything we could need!"
8248970,49396873,2015-10-03,44953766,Beth,"Since this was my first experience with Airbnb, I appreciated that the host contacted me so quickly to answer all my questions and to help me navigate the booking process. The host showed concern for our individual needs.  She was kind and very welcoming in her correspondence. The description of the house was completely accurate. It was roomy, beautifully furnished and clean.  The bed linens were high quality and the towels were soft and plentiful. The kitchen was well furnished with quality utensils that made cooking enjoyable.  We were very comfortable. The neighborhood was clean and quiet.  Both the house and the neighborhood were truly a retreat for our family. We would definitely rebook at this location. "
8248970,54980515,2015-11-27,43176885,Mark,"Can't say enough about my experience.  Sally made the whole process very easy, as this was my first booking with Airbnb.  The home and area were wonderful. I highly recommend the neighborhood and this house for anyone visiting Seattle."
3543247,22004232,2014-10-27,22866972,Susan,"What an absolutely wonderful experience!  My husband and I had a great stay in Jeff's space.  He welcomed us with several thoughtful treats, fresh eggs from the host's chickens, and the most gorgeous modern space we could have asked for.  Jeff was great at providing detailed instructions for the amenities in the house and at giving recommendations for restaurants and bars, but he also gave us plenty of space and privacy.  The house and the amenities are just awesome - there are clean, comfortable living and dining spaces with a fully appointed kitchen, a cozy loft for sleeping, and an outdoor hot tub and sauna.  The surrounding area has lots of cute houses and a great neighborhood feel with a grocery store, drug store, and spots to eat within walking distance.  We headed out by car and explored the city, which was easy to do from the home's location.  We didn't want to leave!  We'd definitely book Jeff's place again."
3543247,22131957,2014-10-30,12202196,Eldridge,Jeff has created a beautiful space. My wife and 2 children had the opportunity to stay for a night. We loved the chickens and the fresh eggs. They made for a great breakfast. There's a park close by and a few really tasty restaurants with in walking distance. After a nice walk around the neighborhood we all took a soak in the hot tub then watched a family movie. Wish we had time to use the wood burning sauna. This place made for a great stay in Seattle. I highly recommend this retreat. Can't wait to get back. 
3543247,22716490,2014-11-12,23210210,Kasia,"This was our first airbnb experience and Jeff made it fantastic. He was extraordinarily kind and considerate. Since we brought two kids, he ordered bath robes for them so they could have more fun using the hot tub. The house is gorgeous, beautifully designed. The nespresso coffee maker made delicious coffee that was appreciated even by our coffee snobs. The kids loved having chickens and bunnies to watch out the window, and the fresh eggs were a treat. We didn't get a chance to use the wood sauna, but that just gives us another reason to go back. We highly recommend this Seattle Greenwood getaway!"
3543247,22868382,2014-11-16,1693755,Stacy,"This is by far the best Airbnb experience I've had.  Jeff made me feel super welcome.  His place was spotless and he really did make it a bed and breakfast!  Every morning, I felt spoiled as he left fresh eggs from the chickens outside my door, mimosas, waffle ingredients and more! The place is super cozy with custom made lofts. Everything in the house is built with care.  The best part is the hot tub and sauna with real firewood.  I didn't even want to explore Seattle! The neighborhood nearby is convenient for local bars, coffee shops, etc.  It's about 20 minutes to Pikes Place. I stayed for work and was very easy to get around with a car.  "
3543247,22992648,2014-11-19,14947718,Carlicia,"This place is amazing is a house in the back attached to the main house, but you will have your own entry and patio. It was cold in Seattle and my husband and I enjoyed the sauna and the hot tub, both are in the patio. The house has a charming cabana style decoration. You won't want to leave the place because is so comfortable and has a good environment. Thanks to Jeffrey for providing great amenities, he is a great host. The pictures are very accurate, this place is awesome, 5 stars "
3543247,23445266,2014-12-01,23001026,Kevin,"The house is amazing and Jeff and family are even more amazing. We felt welcome and comfortable from the moment we arrived until we had to leave. Everything was as-advertised and the pictures don't do justice to all of the design touches and well-thought features. Our kids (ages 4 and 6) loved the rabbits and chickens as well as the hot tub and outdoor shower. My wife and I loved the sauna, the stocked kitchen, and the overall aesthetic. We look forward to returning on our next trip to Seattle."
3543247,23559956,2014-12-04,774427,Andria,"I truly can't wait to stay at Jeff's place again.  When we travel, we always look for a unique experience.  I can't express enough how special and super cool this house is.  Jeff has honestly thought of everything.  While the photos are impressive, they don't capture the best part of this place, the details.  It has been designed and outfitted with everything you could possibly want for comfort, privacy and relaxation.  It is a destination within itself.  We didn't even want to leave for more than an hour or two at a time, so that we could basque in this paradise and reap the benefits of its healing nature.  The sauna, hot tub, outdoor shower and back deck are all completely private with plants, fences and trees to shelter the serene energy.  You hardly notice that you are in a neighborhood, because it is like a world of its own.  That's just the backyard.  Inside is perfect too.  Jeff has created a spa-like experience including towels, robes, blankets and super comfortable mattresses, furniture and heated floors.  We honestly didn't want to leave.  With impeccable taste, every interior detail and utility has been thought of.  The kitchen and bathroom are both perfectly stocked with top-of-the-line everything.  Also, its juxtaposition from the front house make for a completely private experience, sharing only one wall.  We felt like we were in our very own perfect world.  Jeff welcomed us and gave us all the info we may need while giving us the space to enjoy for ourselves.  The quality and style in each and every detail was so very impressive.  I am grateful to have been suspended in this amazing space for two days.  It was incredible!!  Seattle is my hometown and EVERY time I visit, I will look to stay here.  "
3543247,23667902,2014-12-07,16719488,William,"There's so much to say about this beautiful home and spa that Jeff has designed and hand built to such exquisite detail. We felt immediately at home when Jeff met us and checked us and gave us the grand tour and showed us the fully stocked kitchen with gas range and oven (which we definitely put to use), the new, cozy sky loft, the visually pleasing living room with a huge window and enormous redwood coffee table. But the real relaxation set in the next morning after a perfect nights sleep on the memory foam mattress. We woke up and made coffee in the nespresso, grabbed a robe and the champagne and orange juice that Jeff left for us and made a beeline for the back yard. And here is the best part- the fully stocked wood fired spa in the back yard, the outdoor shower, the massaging hot tub, all nestled in bamboo made us feel like royalty. I've never been so relaxed in my life. This is the standard for all of my future Airbnb stays, and the bar has been set up in the stratosphere. "
3543247,23797956,2014-12-10,24210879,Beau,"Jeffrey's place was totally beyond expectation. In addition to being spacious, clean, etc, it's extremely well designed and crafted. To say it's a 'value' would be a gross understatement. It's architectural-icon quality at a price that's under a hotel rate. The sauna is also probably the only of its kind in Seattle! Also, Jeffrey is the human equivalent of his house, which is to say that the stay was perfect. "
3543247,23908875,2014-12-14,23907410,Kevin,Jeff was an incredible host.  He showed us around the place on arrival and explained everything well.  My wife and I felt like we were on a second honeymoon even though we had our two little toddlers with us.  He has done a beautiful job on the interior of the unit and it was a really enjoyable space for us all to spend time when not out exploring.  The spa and sauna were just the perfect relaxation at night after the little ones went to sleep.   The whole family absolutely loved the chickens and rabbits and Jeff was gracious enough to let our little ones visit with all the animals.  The neighborhood is quiet and the back yard provides a lot of privacy.  We would most definitely stay again and we glad to have stayed in such luxurious accommodations and to have felt welcomed into the home by Jeff.
3543247,24235871,2014-12-23,23487087,Elena,"Jeff is amazing! He is SO accommodating. Jeff was quick to communicate with me immediately after booking our stay, he suggested music venues, restaurants, and attractions. We even had to change our trip date and he was very understanding. Once we arrived he showed us around the place immediately, and familiarized us with the sauna/spa, (which was a terrific experience.) The unit had literally everything we needed and more! The neighborhood and the house is unreal, the atmosphere is so welcoming.  If we ever make another Seattle trip, we're definitely staying again :)"
3543247,24483509,2014-12-29,11901498,Liz And Jonas,"We had a wonderful stay at Jeff’s urban retreat! The space is beautifully and artistically designed and has every amenity you could wish for. It is quiet and private and has a lovely feel both inside the house and in the spa/outdoor area. Jeff has truly thought of everything: from the personal slippers and robes (he even had them for our daughters!), to the organic dark chocolate, champagne in the fridge, gourmet coffee, and incredible selection of spices to cook with. Jeff goes above and beyond in his hosting. He was great about communicating with us ahead of time, offered us a warm welcome upon arrival and was on hand to offer suggestions about local restaurants and places to go. As Airbnb hosts ourselves, we can truly appreciate how much thought has clearly gone into all of the details. Not only is this a fabulous place to stay, but a truly a unique Airbnb experience. We highly recommend it and hope to return on our next trip to Seattle!"
3543247,24768774,2015-01-02,13916,Yannick,"Overall, this was the by far most pleasant AirBnB experience I've had to date. Jeff was the most gracious host - he greeted us upon arrival, gave us a splendid walkthrough of the flat and informed us about what to do/see while in Seattle. The place itself was absolutely perfect! We felt immediately at home. The kitchen is well stocked, the sauna and the hot tub are both amazing, and the bed is extremely comfortable. The flat is on the same property as the main house but provides a lot of privacy. Jeff has supplied everything you could need for a relaxing getaway. I would highly recommend Jeff's place for anyone planning a trip to Seattle. This is the standard for all of my future AirBnB stays. "
3543247,25252622,2015-01-10,7409725,Angela,"Jeff was a wonderful host. He was flexible about our arrival time which made things easy. His place was exactly as described but even better in person. When you walk in, you can tell that every detail was a labor of love project by Jeff - truly inspiring. Jeff is an equivalent of his house for sure. His whole place was very clean, cozy and comfortable, especially the glorious Cal King bed! Jeff thought of everything that made us feel welcome...from the slippers,  robes, Nespresso coffee, champagne, organic chocolate bar, to the fresh eggs from his chickens that he left outside our window each morning. My husband and I made fresh eggs for breakfast each morning during our stay and the hubby couldn't have been happier...he has inspired us to get our yard started for farming :) The whole ambiance of the place is very peaceful; we had a great time being able to use his sauna and hot tub as well. The location is absolutely the best for Seattle's Greenwood and Phinney neighborhood, walkable to everything and entirely safe. We loved it and will be back! Great place to have family stay at too! Thank you so much Jeff! "
3543247,25316279,2015-01-12,13585860,Jon,"Jeff embodies the core of what Airbnb is all about.  His listing is neat, clean, organized, and you will not want to leave. Every amenity is first-class and much thought goes into your entire stay.  The listing is close enough to the city to visit, but far away enough to feel like local. The neighborhood is quiet and quaint and close to tons of waterholes and yummy food.  I cannot wait to return!"
3543247,27529740,2015-03-07,24640992,Schonna,"The Readers Digest Version Review:

If you are going to Seattle, stay here. No really, STAY HERE!!! Wonderful, friendly hosts along with a fabulous, beautiful and clean environment. The pictures do not do these lovely accommodations justice.

The More Detailed Review:

This is a quaint, architecturally beautiful, serene environment to stay in. We stayed here long term (almost 2 months, we were remodelling our kitchen and didn’t want to live in a construction zone). As mentioned in the short review, this place is nicer than the pictures show. I remember almost holding my breath worrying that the pictures were photoshopped or something, only to walk in and be pleasantly surprised with a simply beautifully designed mini apartment with cool design features like a Sky loft. It doesn’t hurt that you have your own little private back yard with a hot tub and a wood burning sauna!!! If you are musically inclined, there is a steel string guitar available to play, or if you just want to watch movies there is a large screen TV with a surround sound setup to take in a show. If cooking is your thing there is a great selection of spice mixes with a wonderful little recipe book to match them, or just use the fully equipped kitchen to make your own creation. The only problem I can think of about when it comes to this abode is that you don’t really want to leave. It’s just so nice.

The hosts of this wonderful AirB&B were amazing. They were available promptly if needed. They were super friendly and welcoming. It was made very clear to us, that us enjoying our stay was their goal. They made us feel like we were almost like family. Kind, friendly and really good people.

Truly, if you need a place to stay in Seattle. Stay here. This artistically asian inspired, little corner of Seattle is truly the best kept secret on AirB&B."
3543247,27805133,2015-03-12,22220884,Kate,Jeffrey is a very wonderful person. He was quick to respond and confirm all details. unfortunately we were not able to stay. We had to cancel near last minute due to our dog being very I'll and Jeffrey was so accommodating and understanding. I hope we can stay sometime soon! 
3543247,27994566,2015-03-16,25790009,Jordan,Jeffrey was an incredible host. This was an unforgettable experience for me. I was able to fully rest and recharge. Waking up completely relaxed. It was so nice to make a latte in a beautiful kitchen and cook breakfast for my friends who were also staying with me. One of my favorite surprises was the spice drawer!!! If you love to cook then this is the place for you!! Jeffrey spoils his guests! I absolutely did not want to leave. The space was beautiful and so inviting!! I only wish that I had booked a longer trip! I plan to come back soon and  cant imagine staying anywhere else. Jeffrey did not miss a single step. His passion for hosting is evident in every detail. Do yourself a favor and stay here!!!!  :) 
3543247,28602622,2015-03-27,26414964,Sean,"Jeffrey was an unbelievable host - we felt completely spoiled by all of the wonderful amenities at the house. Everything was impeccably clean and felt like a true home. His design choices are superb! Greenwood is a fun neighborhood with lots of good food (many recommendations coming from Jeffrey, too) but it is not too difficult to get around to the rest of the city. It was truly an incredible experience and I would definitely choose to stay here when in Seattle again! "
3543247,28793351,2015-03-30,20862434,Micah,"We can't stop gushing about this place and Jeff's excellent hospitality! From the moment we arrived we were blown away by the beauty and grandeur of the space. Jeff was kind enough to walk us through the apartment when we arrived and provided many useful suggestions for how to best enjoy our stay. We loved the place so much that we decided to cancel our plans to go out the first night, and instead lounged in our peaceful retreat.

The location is primo! Greenwood is a quaint community, with many shops and restaurants within short walking distance.

There is not one detail that Jeff has overlooked. Every aspect of our stay absolutely exceeded our expectations. We felt right at home in this space; you can tell that a lot of love and care went into designing it.

This is simply the best trip we've ever taken! Jeff, thank you for everything."
3543247,29755586,2015-04-12,16928542,Dallas,"Although we never met Jeffrey in person, he was very responsive, communicative, polite, and accommodating in our conversations. Our stay at Jeffrey's place was fantastic. The place was very well prepared for our arrival, he went above and beyond. It was truly a retreat with all the amenities. The neighborhood had plenty to do within walking distance and plenty more a short drive away. Thanks again to Jeffrey for our awesome weekend! "
3543247,30604225,2015-04-25,2833514,Nancy,"Spotlessly clean, freshly built/remodeled, tasteful, stylish, bright and airy with nice extras like a little yard, (really clean) hot tub, wood-fired sauna, outdoor shower and view of owners' rabbits (awfully cute with an unexpected calming effect, kinda like a fish tank).  Jeffrey was a great host - very easy to communicate with and gracious.  The unit adjoins owners home, but there is a completely separate entrance and good privacy.  Keep in mind the sleeping area is up in a loft and accessed via a ladder, which we found fun but might not be for everyone.  Mattress and pillows seemed to be good quality memory foam.  Easy five mile bike ride to the U.  Would stay again!"
3543247,30786415,2015-04-27,191823,Meredith,"This was a weekend retreat that was  fabulous. Everything you need is there in the retreat. The sauna and tub was perfect. Location was great access to downtown Greenwood for groceries and good eats. the bicycles were a bonus. 
Jeff was a perfect host very helpful and always available. 
All around great peaceful zen experience. 
We will go back.
Meredith and Tom"
3543247,31094861,2015-05-02,4888132,Helen,"This place is amazing! I had high expectations from other reviews and they were exceeded. The ""guest house"" was designed/landscaped  by Jeff, the owner/host/architect with great thought into details. He even built the finnish sauna! He was great About showing us everything in the house and recommended a drive to carkeek park our first nite which is gorgeous.  This was a girls weekend so we wandered shops in greenwood, got a great hour massage at ""happy feet"" for $35 then  had wine/cheese/etc in the backyard pre hot tub.  I would love to return with my hubby. "
3543247,31699727,2015-05-09,22487847,Peggy,"We decided to go on a girlfriend Birthday trip and picked Seattle being we had never been to Seattle. Jeffrey and Ellen are great host. I can't say enough about the them, friendly, nice, lots of great suggestion. The house was amazing even better than the photos, so cute.  Very clean and I am picky. The neighborhood was safe and cute little downtown area with lots of Coffee shops , Restaurant and a wonderful grocery store that has everything you might need. If you are thinking about stay here definitely do, you will not be disappointed. the back yard area is just a bonus. Sauna, Hot tub, and and outdoor shower so cute. Make sure to allow a little down time to enjoy the back yard with a glass of wine or beer. I would suggest this place to my Friends and Family if traveling to Seattle. The Greenwood neighborhood is only about 5 to 6 miles north of Downtown Seattle easy to get on the # 5 bus to blocks away.  Hope to come back with my Husband soon and stay here again. Thank you Jeffery and Ellen for sharing you're beautiful house.   Peggy & Debbie"
3543247,32448780,2015-05-18,25814386,Kathleen,"Jeff's welcome was perfect.  He explained everything in detail and told me to text him if I had questions later in my stay.  I was there for four nights and would have been happy to stay longer.  
The village of Greenwood is quite close, with shops and restaurants; I walked there a few times.  There's a park a half block away from the apartment with green space and kids' play space.  The neighborhood is nice - mostly single-family homes in the immediate area.  There's a #33 bus stop about two blocks from the apartment.  
My long weekend in Seattle was a very busy one, so returning to the peaceful apartment was always a pleasure.  "
3543247,32812149,2015-05-22,15029897,Frank,"Jeff was very welcoming and communicative! 

He's an awesome guy, and his place is definitely worth checking out. I would definitely stay there again!"
3543247,33858763,2015-06-01,33437505,William,"Wonderful place and fantastic hosts.  Super clean with elite surroundings and an enjoyable Asian garden with outside shower.  WiFi is super quick, and the 5.1 surround sound was great for playing action movies.  We'll definitely return if the unit is available.  We had a great time.  "
3543247,33979042,2015-06-03,19530135,Susannah,Jeffs place was in a great location. Close to the city and accessible as we had a hired car. Jeff was friendly and welcoming and accommodated all of our requests and queries. He was extremely generous and easy to contact. He went above and beyond in making us feel at home. We had a fantastic time.
3543247,35285540,2015-06-17,21604954,Elaine,"Jeff and his family made us feel very welcome and pointed out local hiking trails, eateries, and other points of interest.  The space is very charming, quite and private.  We took full advantage of the hot tub, sauna and outdoor shower.  Yoga mats were provided for morning stretches on the patio.  

The neighborhood is centrally located with many services in walking distance. 

I would say that the space exceeded our expectations and look forward to staying here again.  "
3543247,36004607,2015-06-24,2871011,Susan,"This house is fabulous!  Really quiet but in the thick of a happening neighborhood.   It's inspiring:  there are yoga mats (and ""zen"" bunnies) and a hot tub, outdoor shower, and sauna.  There's an awesome coffee machine and a foot massager!  There are cookbooks and spices to help yourself to, along with the cookware to make a great meal if so inclined!   Most of all, there is Jeffrey there to help you if you need anything, his adorable wife, daughter, and dog, Hugo.   All cute as they can be and very friendly.  What more could you ask for?  I didn't want to leave and in fact, booked again for next month! :)"
3543247,37785901,2015-07-10,2871011,Susan,"This was my second stay here--wanted to come back with my kiddos.   My son said it all in one sentence:  ""Mom, can we just not ever stay anywhere else but here while we're in Seattle?""   It is hard to believe a place can be so entirely comfortable, relaxed, and welcoming, and yet clean and chic at the same time, but this place does!  And Jeffery makes sure you feel welcome and have everything you could possibly need.  I mentioned we were going to an outdoor movie (highly recommend) and he ran to get us some folding chairs.   He even got under our car and looked at it when it was making noise before I left!  Also--their daughter is so adorable and will give you her restaurant recommendations.  :)  Lastly, as all the other reviews mention, the backyard is a little piece of heaven.   Cannot wait to get back.  
Thanks again!"
3543247,37960865,2015-07-12,31080481,Justin,"My girlfriend and I had the pleasure to stay with Jeff and his beautiful Seattle retreat. Take a second to read all of his rave reviews - They are all TRUE. The space is gorgeous and spotlessly clean. It’s not every day that you have access to a private hot tub, sauna, and outdoor shower in your back yard.  From the second we arrived till the second we left Jeff made sure we were taken care of.  Jeff’s location was perfect; we were literally 10-15 minutes from restaurants and all of Seattle’s main tourist attractions.  We felt we were at a 5 star resort! We had an awesome time and hope to return in the future."
3543247,38369304,2015-07-15,27790947,Logan,My wife and I stayed at Jeff's place for 3 nights while on vacation in the pacific NW and had an amazing time!  The day we arrived Jeff welcomed us and showed us around the place.  We enjoyed all of the awesome amenities that were provided including the espresso machine and a really cool sauna.  Jeff also gave us a lot of privacy but was open to talking to us and giving us suggestions on places to visit and eat at if we asked. It was a great experience to stay at Jeffs place and will definitely be back if we ever return to Seattle. 
3543247,39273597,2015-07-22,19105110,Deborah,"Jeff was the perfect host. His home, hospitality and amenities far exceeded our expectations. Kitchen was excellently equipped. Beds were comfortable. Backyard spa was literally world class. Looked and felt like we were in an urban oasis of peace and quiet. Many nice places are within walking distance but the bicycles were a pleasant alternative. We hope to visit here often in the future when in Seattle. "
3543247,39497930,2015-07-24,33784817,Erin,"Jeff's guest house in Greenwood is simply a dream. He has thought of every possible necessity, and then some! Fully stocked kitchen (spices, coffee & tea, champagne and organic milk included!), plush robes to lounge around your zen retreat and lush backyard, plenty of extra pillows and towels. The unit is really something special, the two sleeping areas are lofted with lots of light and windows so you feel like you're sleeping in the trees... And of course, by the way, there is a PRIVATE hot tub, sauna, and outdoor shower!! There are so many windows for fresh air and something different to look at. There are fresh herbs right outside the kitchen windows to cook with. Greenwood was a fun little neighborhood, 5-10 minutes walking to lots of coffee shops and restaurants. Jeff gave us TONS of recommendations for our stay and was so pleasant to work with. OH and the bunnies are so sweet!! It was overall just such a treat and a real vacation. "
3543247,40071190,2015-07-28,23907410,Kevin,"This is our second time staying here.  We LOVE it!  Jeff is a friendly, kind host.  Our family of four was quite comfortable and we look forward to visiting again.  The sauna and spa are incredible.  I highly recommend!"
3543247,40419123,2015-07-31,10953136,Kathleen,"My family had a wonderful time staying in Jeffrey's beautiful home; in fact, my daughters (16 and 21) wanted to move in permanently! The 16-year old loved having her own loft bed and Netflix. We all loved the hot tub, Finnish sauna, comfortable  and private home, and location (nice neighborhood and close for visiting Seattle). Jeffrey did everything possible to make sure we had a great stay. There were lots of extra little touches. Very highly recommended!"
3543247,41188276,2015-08-05,27232679,Benjamin,"I don't even know where to begin. What a relief it was to come back from adventuring around town to be able to cozy up in the hot tub or in the amazing loft bed. It was almost a challenge to actually leave and go explore around the city.The only regret we have is not being able to try out the sauna. On top of the beautiful space, Jeff is an amazing host. He made everything easy with recommendations on places to eat and things to do. He really went above and beyond what I had expected and made us feel like we were staying with an old friend. Thank you again for helping us relax and kick off our honeymoon in the best way possible! "
3543247,41915143,2015-08-10,19730695,Stephanie,"The neighborhood is super cute and quiet but still very close to downtown. We had good communication with Jeff right up until we got here. I loved the chalk board with things to do and contact numbers in case we had questions. Jeff also sent us addition recommendations. We appreciated the chocolate bars, wine, and milk in the fridge in addition to all the other great surprises. 

This house was even better than the pictures! We got in after 1230 in the morning and were so excited to explore. The sauna was great and we loved opening the windows and talking to the two bunnies outside! It was all perfect and beautiful."
3543247,42531094,2015-08-14,4565180,George,Loved loved loved. Made me want to move to Seattle and live in this neighborhood. Jeffrey was great and made everything easy. We were real tourists and bought Salmon at Pike Place Market and grilled it on the amazing grill. The spa is incredible. Apartment is great. Very private. loved the super cute neighborhood. We visit family north of Seattle - this made it feel like a luxurious vacation. Can't wait to go back!
3543247,43619423,2015-08-21,31754614,Kristina,"This was an amazing place to stay! This was my families first trip with a toddler and the space allowed us to have some privacy and feel like we were on vacation when working around his sleep. The neighborhood is very walkable and close to public transportation, if I was coming back I would probably skip the rental car. The kitchen was stocked with great equipment and spices. "
3543247,43902467,2015-08-23,5760141,Ariela,A beautiful place and gracious host!
3543247,44758462,2015-08-29,8639694,Andreas,"We've stayed at many places on airbnb, and this one is definitely among the best. Jeff is very organized, and created a lovely space with a lot of attention to detail. We enjoyed the hot tub, sauna and grill, and the bikes were really useful, too. When we return to Seattle, we'll definitely see whether we can stay with Jeff again!"
3543247,45122278,2015-08-31,39298071,Robert,"Don't stay here, it's a trap!  This place is so amazing you won't want to leave the house.  If you do manage to break free from the spa retreat, there are many restaurants and shops within walking distance.  There is even a nice little hike not too far from the house that will lead you down to the Puget Sound. Jeff was there to greet us and give us the tour.  He was also very helpful is his suggestions.  By far one of the nicest places we have ever stayed."
3543247,47679581,2015-09-21,33682307,Robert,"Our three visitors from Aomori, Japan (women in their late 60s, early 70s) were very pleased with their one-week stay at Jeff and Ellen's listing. The facilities were excellent, and the guests felt very much at home. The host (Jeff) went out of his way to accommodate the ladies every whim with fresh cut flowers and even finding a Japanese language channel of broadcast TV. We would recommend the listing to others, especially to larger groups up to four. "
3543247,48312344,2015-09-25,8769549,Mark,"Jeffrey is incredibly gracious, generous, and hospitable.  The space is quite attractive and loaded with amenities.  We will certainly look to stay here again when we next visit Seattle.  Highly recommended!  "
3543247,49065396,2015-09-30,5109944,Taylor,All in all a great stay! Hot tub was a nice perk too. 
3543247,49294883,2015-10-02,5109944,Taylor,"I had a great stay at Jeff's place—wish I'd spent more time in the home! Very comfortable and spacious, and gracious hosts. "
3543247,49474504,2015-10-04,18116174,Ashlyn,Jeffrey and his wife were amazing hosts! We showed up to beautiful red roses in the house. The house is absolutely stunning and the backyard is out of this world! We definitely want to return sometime. 
3543247,50610765,2015-10-13,26803167,Ana,"I super recommend staying at  ! Jeff and his wife, and their fun dog and cute bunnies very well received us. They were always available when needed to ask anything and gave us really nice recommendations on the neighborhood (restaurants nearby, how to get a taxi, where was the supermarket, unsafe places we should keep away). 
The space is exactly as it looks in the photos with some additional amenities such as the outside garden, friendly bunnies, and a state of the art coffee maker fully stocked with a variety of coffee flavors, and great heated floors. 
Our stay in Seattle was definitely a great one thanks to the great atmosphere Jeff brings forward with this Airbnb. Looking forward to coming back to Emerald city.

3543247,53977691,2015-11-15,31701998,Stacey,"The hosts were amazing and very accommodating. I am blown away at how peaceful and beautiful this place was. It's going to be in rotation to somewhere I go back to. It's almost like you could skip Seattle all together and just hang out there. I would suggest you make time for the space as well as the city. One of my most favorite places to stay and I don't sit for too long.  The chocolate, champagne, and Nespresso spoiled us. The design and little touches around the space are well done. We loved it and will come back as long as you will have us!  Thank you for the lovely experience!  You nailed it for this trip!"
3543247,54846606,2015-11-25,40864364,Jen,"We loved our stay at the Spa Retreat in Seattle! The space was perfect for my husband and I - very private and full of amazing amenities. We loved the sauna and the kitchen was stocked with all sorts of appliances and such. 

The Greenwood neighborhood was inviting and offered numerous shops and restaurants nearby, including a large grocery store just minutes away. It was literally 15 minutes from downtown Seattle.

Our host was wonderful! He was very responsive to questions and offered up many suggestions for things to do while visiting the city. 

I would welcome a return trip to the Spa Retreat anytime. :)"
3543247,54911711,2015-11-25,3229827,Anilyn,"Thank you Jeffrey for allowing us to stay in your amazing guest house! If you are in Seattle and need a relaxing place to stay, this is it! Modern, but not cold, finishes adorn this quiet, expertly planned home. The sauna and tub are easy to use and very private. The house is located close to restaurants and bars, but far enough that you are away from the hustle and bustle. There is everything you need there! Jeff and Ellen have thought of everything! We will definitely be back! Thanks for having us! "
3543247,55195574,2015-11-29,17985593,Susan,"Absolutely WONDERFUL!!  We stayed at Jeffrey's over the Thanksgiving weekend and found the whole experience to be great.  Jeffrey was very welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable.  The place is very quiet and in a great location near restaurants, coffee houses and stores.  Nothing has been overlooked that helps to make guests feel at home and pampered. The kitchen is well stocked, the bedrooms are very comfortable, and hot tub, sauna and outdoor shower are fabulous.  I highly recommend this Seattle retreat.  You will not be disappointed."
3543247,56165390,2015-12-09,1635066,Sophia,"This place is even more amazing than it looks in the pictures; heated floors, italian vases, marble night stands, surround sound TV, Nespresso machine and milk frother, etc, etc!  Jeff has added all kinds nice touches to his place like a full spice drawer, a child-sized bath robe and local, high-end chocolates by Theo. The loft beds make you feel like you are up in the trees; the beds are memory foam and he has all kinds of pillows to chose from. There is a hot tub and sauna with outdoor shower that are super private from the neighbors. It really is a little in-city oasis. On top of all that, it's only two houses from a playground/ park and walking distance to shops and food. Actually, can I move in??"
3543247,56385473,2015-12-13,342783,Sylvain,"The place was immaculate and thoughtfully and beautifully designed.  It was perfect for 4 women to treat themselves to a beautiful getaway.  We appreciated the treats, luxurious beds, bathrobes and of course the sauna was heavenly! "
481220,1732633,2012-07-17,255350,Elaine,"A lovely suite in the basement of a character home in Queen Anne. Good location for great views and restaurants, close enough to downtown for an easy bus ride or drive."
481220,1761703,2012-07-21,218689,Roma & Jesse,"I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to stay in Nadine's MIL flat.  The newly designed space was hip and comfortable and no detail went unattended.  Fresh baked banana bread, coffee fixings, even a blow dryer in the bathroom.  Both beds were a dream sleep, the yard was quiet.  Nadine, Mark and Stanley could not have been more welcoming and kind.  I highly recommend this flat as one of the finest stays in Seattle.  Thank you Nadine!"
481220,1784351,2012-07-23,783751,Stephen,Amazing apartment with very kind and friendy hosts. We arrived late on a friday night but Nadine was very understanding and welcoming. We were blown away by the decor and cleanliness of the apartment ( would have no problem getting Nadine to decorate my house ) and it comfortably accommodated 4 adults. She also cooks amazing scones :-) which were kindly left for us. It is great location for accessing town and I would have no hesitation recommending this place to others. I will definitely be staying here again.
481220,1800588,2012-07-25,2949392,Daniel,"The place was lovely, Nadine and Mark were very nice. She even baked us fresh scones. Everything was clean and fresh. Couldn't ask for anything more. "
481220,1860478,2012-08-01,2674595,Brian,"Staying in Nadine and Mark's little flat in Queen Anne seriously made our trip to Seattle. Not only was the location perfect, but the flat itself was amazing -- it felt like home. There is a bathroom, w/d, kitchen, a dining room with a couch and dining table, a living room huge flat-screen TV with a trundle bed and a bedroom that can be closed; we fit 2 couples (4 people total) perfectly. Everything was very clean, and we were even provided coffee, tea, creamer, sugar, water and juice for our week long stay. Though we did not get a chance to meet Mark, we saw Nadine, who is a gracious and thoughtful host. Very quick and easy to communicate with too. BONUS: Nadine gave us a loaf of fresh-baked banana bread and was kind enough to drive us on our last day to the metro. Just FANTASTIC hosts and a wonderful flat -- I can't recommend it highly enough!!"
481220,1879670,2012-08-03,3069267,Pat,"Staying at Nadine's made our time in Seattle really wonderful. She was very helpful with directions and places to go. The suite was clean, peaceful and absolutely gorgeous. You could walk to many places from her house.The house had a very interesting history dating back to 1892. I would definitely recommend staying with Nadine."
481220,1918932,2012-08-07,3059517,Tanya,"Brilliant!  Nadine was an excellent host, very easygoing and welcoming.  She gave us some great recommendations for restaurants and shopping.  The suite is well appointed; you can tell that it was decorated with care and thought, not just someone's old discarded plaid couches from the 80's  like so many vacation rentals seem to have.  It was super clean, very private, and had everything we needed.  There is a pretty well kitted-out kitchen as well, so we were able to cobble together a nice breakfast out of some pike place market goodies.  We could walk to the downtown core, or take the monorail to save the hassle of driving and parking.

I would definitely recommend the suite for anyone who was looking for more space, comfort and privacy for their money than if they stayed in a hotel.  It has loads of great space for lounging around and a lovely little patio for evening drinks or morning coffee; very peaceful."
481220,1958094,2012-08-12,1982753,Misty,"Five stars, absolutely!! We spent the first half of our honeymoon here and it was perfect! As you can see from the pictures the place is very clean, spacious, and tastefully designed. The bed is super comfy, the couch in the TV room is perfect for snuggling up and watching a movie. Having a full size fridge is great for stocking up on snacks and storing leftovers from the many nearby restaurants. Nadine and Mark are very laid back, friendly, wonderful hosts. We felt so lucky to have found this place at a fraction of what it would have cost in one of the nicer downtown hotels.
The Queen Anne neighborhood is beautiful and is within walking distance to much of the downtown area. We walked to City Center, rode the monorail downtown, walked a bit more to catch the ferry and then went over to Bainbridge Island for the day; all very easy to do from this location. We did bring a rental car for checking out other WA sights.
We look forward to staying with Nadine and Mark in the future."
481220,2030040,2012-08-19,2948152,Kevin,"We spent 4 nights in Mark and Nadine's garden apartment. This was our first airbnb experience, and based on this experience, we will be using the service again. The garden apartment is truly a private place in the lovely Seattle neighborhood of Queen Anne. It's great for people who crave a bit more privacy than the typical BnB experience, and has it's own entry, bathroom, and kitchen. The apartment is so tastefully decorated and so well appointed that we were even able to make dinner at the apartment one evening.

The hosts were very accommodating; Nadine baked us scones and left coffee and creamer for our stay and Mark offered ice cream and beer to beat the rare Seattle heat wave. The bed is amazingly comfortable and the linens and towels are all fresh and clean. We ate out at two of their recommended restaurants and both were excellent. 

You really can't go wrong with the location, which is close to Seattle Center, downtown and bus lines. We will definitely book with the Hucks again and hope to spend more time with them next time!"
481220,2082068,2012-08-24,2984436,Laura,"We had a great stay at Nadine and Mark's apartment.  The apartment was great--clean, nicely decorated, and had everything we needed (including fresh baked scones!).  Our hosts were very helpful with advice and the loan of toys for the girls.  The garden is very nice and our stay was very relaxing.  The location of this apt is great-easy walking distance to the Seattle Center and all its attractions, and only a short bus ride (or longish walk) to downtown.  I would highly recommend this apartment.  "
481220,2162108,2012-09-01,3142733,Kendall,"My experience staying in Nadine's adorable Garden Apartment was amazing. She is a great hostess and greeted my family and I with open arms. She left croissants, coffee, cream, orange juice, and nectarines for us to enjoy upon our arrival. The communication between us was great and helped make our first Air BNB experience the best. I would definitely recommend anyone interested in staying in Seattle to book a stay at Nadine's quaint, comfortable apartment.  "
481220,2192221,2012-09-04,2874195,Gowa,"Awesome start to finish.  Nadine gave a us a warm welcome and baked us scones for our first morning.  The fridge was stocked with juice, beers and cream for coffee.  The house is thoughtfully furnished. Overall great stay. "
481220,2333771,2012-09-18,995242,Norman,"Very spacious and nicely decorated apartment, short walk to shops and nice stroll to Seattle Center. Had everything we needed for our three nights stay and thoroughly enjoy our time there. Thank you to Nadine and Mark for being such great hosts! "
481220,2369517,2012-09-22,3093547,Andrea,"We had a short stay in Seattle, but were totally impressed by the standard of the cottage & Nadine & Mark were wonderfully helpful hosts, accommodating our little later arrival time. Their cottage is spotless, with a little welcoming coffee, beer & marble cake.
The bed was really comfortable as was the sofa/couch. All the facilities were good, and whilst one appliance wasn't operating they made their own available to us.
The cottage was easy to find, and very easy to get into Seattle Centre and downtown. We used the monorail a couple of times, which was cheap & easy to use.  So the whole of downtown was easily explorable. 
I would highly recommend Nadine & Marks cottage as being in a quiet neighbourhood, with easy access to everywhere in Seattle. 
Thanks to them we had the best start to our holiday we could have wished for. 

Best wishes to them for the future - we know we'd love to stay with you again, and more than likely will ......Regards Andrea, Sue & Family. :-)"
481220,2427149,2012-09-27,1688089,Lauren,"This was my first Airbnb experience and if they're all this great, I can't wait to do it again! Nadine and Mark were incredibly nice, and offered great suggestions for places to go and things to do.  The apartment was adorable, clean, and in a great location. Easy walking distance to things, and they were also really easy going about us keeping our rental in their driveway.  It was a great stay in Seattle."
481220,2482670,2012-10-02,1701218,Anne,"We had a wonderful 4 days at Nadines Seattle apartment.
It was spotlessly clean with absolutely everything you might need provided.Situated in historic Queen Anne's it was a comfortable walk to all the sights in the centre of Seattle -we walked our socks off, ate at some great restaurants and thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful city of (email hidden)owing we had such a comfortable and relaxing base to return to each day made our stay so enjoyable!"
481220,2579714,2012-10-11,335576,Peter,"Excellent stay. Candy - Nadine's mother welcomed us and helped us settle in. Very stylish apartment - everything carefully chosen and in tip-top condition. Quiet, great location (near the waterfront, cafes, food markets etc). Will be back"
481220,2634286,2012-10-16,3695615,Lauren,"Mark and Nadine were very accomodating! Their place is perfect, a great home away from home! We had a great time on our trip and really enjoyed staying here. We are already looking at booking again! Thanks so much for everything:)"
481220,2687628,2012-10-22,3790080,Kathie,"The Garden Apt. exceeded our expectations.  It was spotlessly clean, very comfortable and a perfect location from which we could launch day tours of Seattle.  The apartment itself is very private, but if you should need anything, Nadine is steps away to help point you in the right direction or assist in any way.  

Nadine is very hospitable and has great suggestions for local eateries and sights.  The banana bread was out of this world. 

Ours was a Mother/Son trip with my teenage son.  This location in Queen Anne was optimal for being able to walk to restaurants and stores, down to the Seattle Center where there is the Needle, Chihuly Gardens and the Monorail to take us downtown.  

We really enjoyed our stay and hope to come back.  Next time with the hubby, too.  "
481220,2756616,2012-10-29,3949572,Maria,"Our stay at Nadine's was nothing short of magical! 
From the time we arrived the city, until the moment we left, Nadine was extremely accomodating, and she worked very well with our schedule. 
Upon our arrival, we were greeted very warmly and with home made pumpkin bread. She had very thoughtfully left a few waters, and beer in the fridge for us (needless to say, she won my boyfriend's heart with that!) There is also a coffee pot, and she provides you with tea, coffe and sugar. Also, don't bring shampoo or conditioner, she has all of that for you ^_^ 
Nadine is truly a very thoughtrful hostess! She is a natural at being a hostess. She is extremely welcoming, but unless we had questions for her, she allowed us the freedom to come and go as we pleased. 
In regards to the place: Very clean! Felt like home! Gorgeous apartment. 
I went there with my boyfriend and his son, and the set up of the place was perfect! There is a private room with a Queen bed, and there is also another bed, right in front of the TV (Perfect if you have a child with you!) Nadine also offered all of the accomodations the apartment came with, and she was always more than available if we needed her advice with anything! 
Our flight was scheduled at eight, and she was super kind and let us leave our bags there, so we could explore the city a little more.
In other words, this was my first airbnb experience, and Nadine was nothing short of amazing! Her home inspires comfort and culture, since the house itself is a part of the history of seattle. If you have the pleasure of staying at her place, look for the literature she leaves about the history of the house! Very interesting! 
Transportation: the place is walking distance to Pike's Place, or you can take a cab there for eight bucks, or even the bus. The neighborhood is great! "
481220,2886250,2012-11-15,2062620,Sarah,"Nadine's apartment was absolutely perfect.  It had all of the luxuries of a 5 star hotel with the coziness of a dear friend's house.  I would absolutely recommend this apartment to any who are visiting the Seattle area.  Not only are the amenities superb and the hostess kind and thoughtful but the apartment is also located in a great neighborhood, within walking distance of tons of downtown restaurants, bars, and cultural activities."
481220,3189073,2012-12-30,1850014,Jay,Place was very clean and comfortable.  Nadine was a wonderful host.  We will stay here again.
481220,3287023,2013-01-06,3579027,Irene,"We had a very comfortable stay at Nadine and Mark's historic home garden apartment. The place was clean, modern and equipped with what one normally needed for a few days stay. The location is superb, short bus trip to city centre, walking distance to Seattle centre and monorail, nice walk along coast nearby, with good restaurants and supermarkets walking distance away. Nadine is a friendly and helpful host, very responsive and generous with flexible check out time."
481220,3353104,2013-01-15,425934,David,"Super convenient location, a large cozy space and warm hosts make for perfect accommodations in the beautiful city of Seattle!!!"
481220,3616069,2013-02-26,3904687,Lindsay,"I didn't stay personally at Nadine's apartment, but rather rented it for four friends coming to town to visit, as my apartment is too small to host a big group. I live right across the street, so the location was incredibly convenient :)

The apartment is fantastic -- very clean, modern, and with all the amenities you'd need. My friends found the beds to be very comfortable and enjoyed the numerous Seattle guidebooks and books about local companies and shops that were in the apartment.

The location is great -- walkable (5-10 minutes) to a number of good and trendy restaurants and bars in lower queen anne (down the hill) and upper queen anne (up the hill) as well as several theatre and entertainment options in Seattle Center (Ballet, Opera, Repertory Theatre, Space Needle, Chihuly Glass Museum, etc.). Walking downtown to Pike's Market along the waterfront is a also a pretty option of you're up for a longer hike (30-40 minutes), otherwise it's quickly accessible by bus.

Nadine is friendly, easy-going and accommodating. She texted me the morning of our check-in to see if we would be interested in arriving a bit earlier than the scheduled check-in, and then had delicious banana bread waiting for us when I brought my friends over to settle in.

In sum, I'd highly recommend staying at this apartment on your trip to Seattle :)"
481220,3630497,2013-02-26,4743837,Sarina,"Nadine is a fantastic host, and I loved staying in the apartment. The location is unbeatable and just steps away from one of the most beautiful views in Seattle. Highly recommend this accommodation for anyone planning a trip to Seattle. "
481220,3839630,2013-03-19,4421129,Jenn,"Apartment is very clean, modern and cozy; we loved it!!  Up the street is one of the best views of the city, and the Space Needle/EMP park is totally walkable.  Nadine is a great host-- we've found our Seattle vacation spot.  "
481220,3878657,2013-03-24,1227970,Jonna,"Nadine's place is gorgeous! The apartment is lovely, with everything you need for a comfortable stay--and Nadine is a charming and wonderful host. When we arrived, Nadine was warm and friendly, showed us all we needed to know about the place, and introduced us to her cute dog. Fresh pastries were waiting for us, as well! The house the apartment is in is gorgeous, a real piece of Seattle history, and close enough to everything. We'll definitely be back--! Definitely a gem. "
481220,4080999,2013-04-08,4588939,Romey,"I was needing a place to recover from minor surgery.  Nadine and Mark could not have been more accommodating.  Nadine even left a  beautiful vase of flowers that she picked from her garden in front of our door to greet me at my return from the hospital!  Their place lived up to the pictures, it is clean, well appointed and very comfortable.  I would highly recommend this place!"
481220,4481247,2013-05-07,3213380,Jonathan,Was as advertised and very pleasant in a great location. Nadine was really helpful and friendly. We would stay again.
481220,4548806,2013-05-12,5624977,Olivia,"Nadine was a wonderful host and we adored this little apartment. The beds were super comfy, there was lots of space and had everything we needed. My friend and I are both animal lovers so it was great having Nadine's friendly dog around to pet at times. Our only criticism was the wifi, it connected to our phones only in some parts of the apartment but when it did it was fast enough. Nadine even baked us delicious banana bread for our trip home! Definitely recommend this place, we had a wonderful stay. "
481220,4603677,2013-05-14,5548964,Heidi,"The apartment was perfect and Nadine was a great host! The apartment had everything we needed, the location was great, and Nadine even made us some delicious banana bread. We would love to stay here again when we visit Seattle!"
481220,4685292,2013-05-20,6091776,Meredith,"My husband, one year old, and I called the Garden Apartment home for a week.  It was the prefect retreat after a day of touring Seattle.  We could not ask for better hosts in Mark and Nadine.  Nadine was quick to respond to inquiries while planning our trip.  On our way  from the airport we were caught in a Seattle downpour. Nadine quickly came to our rescue and delivered us safely to the apartment.  They gave us space during our stay but were quick to respond when we had questions.  They had guidebooks, maps, a history of the house, and a list of favorites for us, all which were helpful.  There was cinnamon bread waiting for us when we arrived and warm towels.  The apartment was spacious and clean.

The location is perfect.  A beautiful grocery store is around the corner as well as many great restaurants and coffee shops.  Don't miss happy hour at Toulouse Petit. I think we went 3 times! We walked or took the bus everywhere and were happy we didn't need a car.  It was liberating to be car free for a week.

My only words of caution would be for parents with young children.  The apartment has stone tile floors which don't necessarily complement a baby tinkering with walking.  The apartment is not baby proofed.  We felt we would have had similar issues wherever we stayed so this isn't really a negative just a point of consideration for parents.  Our son did enjoy watching the doggies in the yard! And Mark and Nadine were super welcoming of the baby.

I'd recommend bringing slippers to wear on the stone floors!

We had a fantastic trip to Seattle and would recommend to anyone that they stay in the Garden Apartment.  "
481220,4841288,2013-05-28,1457282,Sarah,"This space was so lovely I hated to leave.  It was super confortable, immaculate and central to all my activities.  I will definately come back next time i am in Seattle."
481220,4886477,2013-05-31,5335441,Janet,"The apartment was really lovely, proper home from home. Spacious and luxurious, very very clean and very very comfortable.  I am now looking for a sofa just like Nadines to put in my tv room.  Would recommend this as a fab place to stay in a lovely neighbourhood.  Janet and Paul, London UK"
481220,4979989,2013-06-05,5519716,Christine,"Our stay at the Garden Apt was great. I was doubtful that the pictures could be accurate but they were! It's a beautiful apt situated on the lower level of the house. It is nicely decorated, clean, and comfortable. We used the heater a little at night and it worked great! The kitchen is well equipped and the garden is beautiful to look at from the large windows. It is a 15 min walk to seattle center (space needle etc), great walk to waterfront via 3rd ave, and close to kerry park's panoramic view of seattle (just be ready to walk up hill. worth it though!). Great grocery store (metropolitans) and cafes near by. Nadine and Mark were great! We received beers and fresh baked scones (regretful I didn't get the recipe). Nadine had great recommendations for us and flexible with our check in time. We also had our 18 month old baby with us. Great place for young families. Our little one slept in the bedroom while we were able to be up in the other. Little things were great: maps of the area, books and magazines about seattle, a new kitchen sponge, a hair dryer, extra towels, cable tv. Totally beats paying the same price for a multi-room hotel suite! We would stay here again! "
481220,5148689,2013-06-15,6577225,Irma,"Stayed in this lovely apartment with our two teenagers and had a great time wandering the streets of Seattle.  The location was great, we easily walked to the Space Needle, the Olympic Sculpture park and Kerry Park with its amazing views of the city.  The layout of the apartment also gave us all some privacy (important with teenagers) and their gardens and Nadine's baking and hospitality were both welcomed and much appreciated after a day of walking.   We would recommend it highly and hope to return soon."
481220,5206883,2013-06-18,5053496,Donna,"All I can say is FABULOUS!! The apartment was sparkling clean, beautifully furnished and every attention to detail was provided (extra linens, shampoos, soaps, delicious Seattle coffee, homemade banana bread upon our arrival, etc). It felt like our own little home away from home for the long weekend.

The Queen Anne location is convenient to central Seattle neighborhoods which we visited, and enabled us to use public transportation during our entire stay. 

Nadine is friendly, communicative, efficient, and she made sure all of our needs were attended to. What a LOVELY place to stay!!"
481220,5248595,2013-06-20,3442684,Sara,"Nadine was a very nice host.
The Apt was beautiful and clean.
Defintely gonna recommend her and her Apt !!!
 "
481220,5289328,2013-06-23,3538046,Virginia,"I can't say enough about how great this place is, and how accommodating Nadine and Mark are! We stayed here at the beginning and end of our trip to the San Juan Islands, and they went out of their way to help us out. When we first arrived, we tried to walk to the place and had the wrong road, and Nadine came and picked us up! There was warm banana bread waiting and lots of advice for our visit (Toulouse Petit was well worth it!) They were super friendly and helpful when we had to pick up our rental car a day early due to the marathon, and offered to move their family car out of their driveway so we could park on the street when we returned! Apt. is the best we've ever stayed in thru airbnb or vrbo. Clean, beautiful, with everything you could possibly need or want. Will definitely stay here anytime we're in Seattle, and have told everyone I know about it! ABSOLUTELY no problems recommending it. Nadine even texted me about a parade happening downtown on the day of our return, because it would be a traffic nightmare. Could not ask for better hosts or a more beautiful place or convenient location."
481220,5360556,2013-06-26,2395441,Matthew,"The house in Seattle was awesome!  The place was very clean and well presented.  Easy access, free parking and great communication from the host.  Would definitely recommend!"
481220,5434689,2013-06-30,5879160,Kathy,"What a fantastic place and such a gracious host! We loved everything about staying with Nadine, and she made us feel right at home. We were especially delighted that they were so great with our boys and even had a few things to share that they could play with. The neighborhood was ideal, the weather was perfect, the apartment was very well furnished and accommodating for our family, and we could not have enjoyed ourselves more. If we get back to Seattle, we would choose to stay here before anywhere else. "
481220,5481914,2013-07-02,3538046,Virginia,"We stayed with Nadine and Mark at the beginning and end of our trip (see earlier review). They couldn't have be more hospitable. Our flight didn't leave until the evening, and they held our bags for us so we could walk around on our last day without dragging our bags with us.  Great place, great people!"
481220,5555619,2013-07-06,5608425,John,"Very attractive, clean, well-equipped.  Lovely terrace outside.  Owners live upstairs and you can hear them walking around.  Parking on the street is very difficult but in the driveway can be managed."
481220,5654112,2013-07-10,4218289,Mo,"What a lovely apartment and interesting house! We arrived after 1 am, as we had problems with our flights. No problem for Nadine and Mark, as we emailed them to let them know of our late arrival. There were pastries, fresh milk, beer and a bottle of wine left out for us by Nadine, which were a welcome site to two exhausted travellers. The apartment was super clean and cosy, with the furnishings being a great mix of old and new. Super neighbourhood and easy to walk or catch public transport to downtown.

We definitely rate this apartment as superb, and would want to stay there again if we were ever back in Seattle."
481220,5840076,2013-07-19,3256623,Bernard,"Un appartement meublé avec gout. Très fonctionnel et bien situé. 
Des hotes acceuillants, attentionnés sans etre envahissants.
"
481220,6153110,2013-08-01,6554195,Elizabeth,Lovely  stay at peaceful comfy apartment!  Perfect for our group of 4'
481220,6193889,2013-08-03,6727556,Mary Jane,"This is a beautiful house in a great neighbourhood. Plenty of room for the four of us and very quiet and private. Lots of nice extras: soap and shampoo etc. and even a few beers to help us settle in. Nadine was very helpful and we loved the dogs. The house was centrally located, not far from Pike St. And several nice restaurants. We would love to stay again."
481220,6341173,2013-08-09,3012822,Janet,I enjoyed staying in the comfortable garden apartment.  The apartment is close to Kerry Park and down the hill to all the Queen Anne restaurants.  Nadine was a wonderful host with lots of great ideas of where to eat and what to do.  Thanks to Nadine for saving the house and not letting the lot become another condo. 
481220,6396970,2013-08-11,7157688,Nancy,"We had a WONDERFUL experience with Nadine and Mark! They were such warm, welcoming, helpful hosts. The apartment was private, beautifully arranged, super clean and comfortable. The house is a very special place - historic and in a great location. . . we walked to restaurants, the grocery store, coffee and delicious doughnuts :) and parks (Kerry Park for the view and Parsons Garden). If we are in Seattle again, I would definitely want to stay here. THANK YOU SO MUCH NADINE AND MARK!"
481220,6608881,2013-08-19,4158015,Carol,"I went to Seattle for the opera's Ring cycle. The Garden Apt was a 10-20 minute walk to Seattle Center and the opera house.  I stayed for eight nights and it truly felt like my home-away-from-home. Nadine and Mark were very friendly and helpful. It was evident that Nadine had tried to anticipate a traveler's every need--there was shampoo and conditioner and soap in the bathroom, tea and coffee, maps and restaurant suggestions on the table. Nadine was also a great source for travel information--how to get from one part of Seattle to another. The garden is a wonderful spot to relax in."
481220,6683377,2013-08-21,5877859,Gail,"The apartment has been beautifully remodeled and decorated.  The kitchen and dining area is so inviting, and the entire space opens out to the garden.  Walking distance to everything.  Delicious pastries, coffee, and beverages provided.  Just an awesome experience !"
481220,6727714,2013-08-23,4938963,Susan,"Absolutely perfect--maybe best place I've ever stayed: clean, comfortable, easy access to Seattle sights, helpful hosts, great bed, huge television, beautiful, tasteful furnishings, roomy, lovely outdoor space. Plan to return."
481220,6811160,2013-08-26,7217164,Julian,The new wave in travel. Much better than a hotel and you get to beat the Government out of some tax money!
481220,6940119,2013-08-31,7783425,Chris,"We enjoyed our stay at Nadine's place. The beds were comfortable, and the kitchen and bathroom were marvelous.  While the wireless access was a touch on the slow side, that did not detract from our experience one bit.  This place is in an excellent location, and is more than comfortable.  The washer/dryer and full-size refrigerator certainly came in handy.  Also, Nadine left us a wonderful baked treat, gave us plenty of recommendations, provided city materials, and made themselves completely available.  A great time!  "
481220,7032520,2013-09-04,2996111,Diane,"Loved this cheery apt. Would stay here again in a heartbeat. It's a great location, Kerry Park is just a few blocks away, and restaurants are close by. Mark and Nadine are delightful and jumped my car when my battery died. We loved our stay."
481220,7146301,2013-09-08,8159884,Andrea,"Nadine and Mark's place is perfect, and perfectly located to great attractions, food, and ""real Seattle vibe"". Nadine was welcoming with croissants, fruit and a couple of much needed beers - and went the extra mile to source local recommendations for dim sum and to hook my 6 year old up with an awesome big box of LEGO. I'll definitely stay here next time I come to Seattle!"
481220,7505273,2013-09-23,1099418,Faye,"Nadine's garden apartment was perfect for us. My husband and I found the neighborhood to be well located and convenient. It was close to a fantastic market and to the water, where we took a lovely morning run. 

Nadine baked us brownies on our check in and stayed in touch to ensure that we were doing well. The apartment was clean and well stocked. Incredibly cute! The full kitchen was great as we like to cook on our trips. 

Take a short bus ride up to Queen Anne for more restaurants, shops, a trader joes and Thursday farmers market. 

Can't wait to be back!!"
481220,7594845,2013-09-25,2556218,Frederic,"Place very highly recommended for short or long stay and small groups of people looking for very nice and quiet area.
Our stay at Nadine's place was just great. The place is perfectly clean, tidy and modernly furnished which made the whole stay very pleasant. We really felt like home. That was thanks to Nadine as well who has been a great host: very reactive and helpful before arrival and very nice, welcoming and available during our stay. On top of that the place is in a very nice and quiet neighbourhood with bars and restaurants around. And a few minutes drive from animated downtown areas."
481220,7692701,2013-09-30,6609133,Shenna,"Nadine was very responsive to emails. Booking the place was extremely easy. We arrived around 10p and Nadine greeted us and helped with our bags. The apartment was clean, we'll stocked with all the necessities (towels, soaps, kitchen supplies, blankets etc.). We were delighted to find banana bread and wine. It was the perfect late night snack. 

Throughout our stay, Nadine and her husband, Mark made themselves available and also respected our privacy. We had a very comfortable stay and would highly recommend their apartment to anyone visiting Seattle."
481220,7923782,2013-10-08,309549,Kimberly,"The apartment was better than expected. With its modern design in a quaint historical house, it was everything we hoped for and more. The location couldn't have been more convenient, being a couple of blocks (uphill) from Kerry Park, to easy access to public transportation, it was a breeze getting around Seattle in any direction. Nadine was super friendly, kind, and very accommodating.  She recommended great local spots to eat and places to see. "
481220,8150215,2013-10-18,2556685,Leah,Nadine is hostess extraordinaire. She is fun. Funny and generous. We feel like we hit the airbnb jackpot. The apartment is well appointed and comfortable. Attention to detail is her specialty. She left red wine for us upon our early check in. She delivered Legos and pumpkin bread for our four year old in the afternoon. I am finding an excuse to return to Seattle just so I can stay chez Nadine again. 
481220,8675577,2013-11-11,5506528,Christina,"Nadine's in-law apartment was immaculate, spacious, warm, and extremely comfortable, and Nadine herself was so friendly and welcoming, communicative, and an extraordinarily quick responder to emails, texts, etc. We arrived from the airport very late, and Nadine had the light on for us and pumpkin bread and wine waiting in our kitchen -- such a lovely treat! The apartment is a very quick stroll (just around the corner, really) from a lively stretch of cute, bustling restaurants and bars (and grocery store, drug store, and delicious frozen-yogurt shop), but Nadine's street is absolutely tranquil and quiet, and we had the most peaceful setting and restful sleep. Also, the apartment features a great shower, a big TV, and an adorable private patio that opens onto a beautiful yard. An absolutely wonderful spot!"
481220,9116189,2013-12-08,1552925,Olya,"Having read the reviews, we had no doubt the apt and the hosts would be wonderful. And even then, our experience was beyond expectations!  We felt very welcomed and cared for when found a bottle of red wine and fresh pumpkin bread upon arrival (the best way to welcome a guest I believe). Nadine was very friendly, helpful ,charming and easy to reach in case you have a question. We absolutely loved the house! The house itself where apartment was situated is very unique and beautiful, so is the garden! Our apartment, besides being beautifully decorated, had a personal touch to it: it had many details/little things that make this apt a HOME, a very cozy one! In fact, we thought that the apt was a lot cozier and more beautiful in reality than it is in the pics! And location was just wonderful, in a perfectly walkable distance to everything. Just go for this one folks!"
481220,9242659,2013-12-16,3665976,Caryn,"My husband, daughter and I rented the lower level of Nadine's home last week and it was absolutely wonderful.  The house itself is awesome; the location in lower Queen Anne is convenient and well suited for either an overnight or longer stay.  Nadine couldn't have been more cordial.  She met us upon check-in to show us the apartment, then was just a text or phone call away for any questions.....but not at all intrusive.  Her two dogs, Belle and Stanley, put our dogs (left home) to shame!  Not a peep out of them the entire week-end but oh so cute looking out the living room window!  Nadine left us delicious homemade banana bread and a bottle of Washington wine upon check-in.......very welcoming.
All in all, I couldn't recommend this location any more strongly.  You will love your stay in Lower Queen Anne!  We have been traveling to Seattle for the past five years while our older daughter was in grad school....just wish we had known about this home earlier!
And an extra bonus:  an Airstream camper is also available on the property  to rent, in the warmer months.  Something for everyone!

"
481220,9543723,2014-01-02,8402321,Mathew,"Mark and Nadine are amazing hosts and made us feel right at home.  They both are easy to talk to via text or in person, provide great recommendations for things to do in and around the city, and their apartment is absolutely spectacular!  The apartment has a full kitchen with a beautiful wood countertop, spacious living/dining room that is bright and welcoming, and a fantastic bedroom with a very comfortable bed. We loved our stay and look forward to coming back!"
481220,9810671,2014-01-11,10984198,Suzanne,"Such a beautiful apartment in a brilliant location. Nadine and mark were super. Greeted us, upon our rainy arrival, with umbrellas and helped us with our luggage. Very graciously shared their driveway with us so we could park off street. Really lovely people. They thought of everything. Even left us with a bottle of wine and croissants. We will definitely book again. Thank you so much!  "
481220,9879710,2014-01-16,1472474,Melissa,"We had a great time in this little oasis in the heart of Queen Ann. It was perfect for our family of 4 and Nadine dropped off a huge box of legos for our kids to play with. The apartment is even prettier in real life...very stylishly decorated. Perfect location, perfect hosts, simply perfect!"
481220,9928136,2014-01-20,10397461,Raphael & Beth,"Nadine and Mark are extremely hospitable and friendly. The garden apartment is bright, modern, clean and well-equipped. It's exactly as in the pictures. Great location, too. We were able to walk through the sculpture park and continue on to Pike Place Market."
481220,10179369,2014-02-04,8665567,Myeka,"Nadine is a fabulous host, wine and cinnamon rolls on our arrival, and cupcakes to celebrate the Seahawks win! This is a beautiful space in a gorgeous Seattle home.  The location is excellent, an easy walk to the Space Needle, the EMP Museum, Kerry Park and other attractions in the Seattle Center, and an easy bus ride downtown. Being in Seattle on the night the Seahawks won the Superbowl was very special, cheering in the streets, firecrackers on corners. We hope to go back to explore the rest of Seattle from this great apartment one day."
481220,10346412,2014-02-15,4499728,Irene & Michael,"My friend and I had a fantastic stay at Nadine's garden apartment.  The place was clean, spacious and well supplied with everything we needed from soap to maps to umbrellas.  We wanted to do our own cooking while in Seattle and the kitchen was well stocked with pots, dishes and even plastic travel containers.  There's no oven, but Nadine was happy to share their kitchen, if needed.  It's a beautiful apartment and Nadine was a wonderful and attentive host, I'd definitely recommend it to anyone staying in Queen Anne.  Thanks, Nadine!"
481220,10454423,2014-02-19,9582704,David,"What a cute, and well appointed hide away! We wholeheartedly enjoyed staying at Nadine and Mark's. Nadine is gracious and quick to answer questions and offer suggestions for things to do and see. Loved it!"
481220,10536344,2014-02-24,11329677,Kam,"Nadine was a gracious host who made sure my parents and I had everything we needed for a lovely stay. Their place was so comfortable, and sure beat a cramped hotel room. It was very clean and was as comfy as it looked in the photos. 

The neighborhood was perfect. So close to downtown, the space needle and Queen Anne. Thank you!!"
481220,10679579,2014-03-03,11236131,Cathy And Bruce,"We were in Seattle for weekend. This place was perfect. Great location. Very Easy to get around the city. Nadine was a great host. The apartment was well appointed with everything you would need, including the coffee and Danish for breakfast. It was like being at home. We would definitely stay here again if ever in Seattle again.

481220,11051696,2014-03-18,12058913,Dylan,"Mark and Nadine were wonderful hosts. Their garden apartment is gorgeous, comfortable and very well-appointed. My wife and I spent a week there and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The location is within walking distance (~30 min) of South Lake Union and most of downtown. And even closer to The Space Needle/Seattle Center and the popular restaurant and bar scene in Lower Queen Anne. I highly recommend this rental to anyone looking to enjoy there time in Seattle!"
481220,11326576,2014-03-30,5026620,Carol,"Our family of 4 had a wonderful stay at Nadine and Mark's Garden Apartment.  The apartment is lovely - just as described and shown in the pictures.  There was a bottle of wine and breakfast pastries waiting for us, which was very nice.  The location was perfect - walking distance to great restaurants, Space Needle, Chihuly Gardens, IMAX and Monorail.  We would definitely stay at this apartment again."
481220,11404681,2014-04-01,7128020,Gabrielle,"We took a recent girls trip out to Seattle and wanted to stay in a place more homey than a hotel!  Nadine's garden apartment was the perfect match!  We were thrilled to be staying in the Lower Queen Anne neighborhood filled with rich history and class!  Her home was beautiful and well decorated and just what we needed.  We were really impressed with the location as it was within walking distance (as promised) to Seattle's main attractions.  The four of us had never been, so it was nice to experience the city as a local would instead of a tourist! "
481220,11586371,2014-04-08,2434143,Lena,My 8 college friends and I rented the garden apartment & the airstream. I left a separate review for the airstream; the apartment was fantastic. It's in a convenient area. The beds were all comfortable and there were dishes & a coffee maker in the kitchen. The free wifi was helpful for planning each day's events. Nadine was very kind & helpful; she gave us a bottle of wine as a welcome gift & there maps & brochures of the city as well. I would highly recommend this location & if I ever come back to Seattle I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Nadine!
481220,11748436,2014-04-14,5801907,Lianne,"Nadine and Mark are fantastic hosts. They made us feel right at home, had plenty of time and patience for our questions about the neighbourhood, and kindly left us a bottle of wine upon our arrival. A very nice touch!  The space works for 2 couples if you don't mind one of the beds being a little more open. Both beds were very comfortable. As a ground floor unit, the apartment stays cool and is a bit dark but we spent most of our time outside exploring and we had use of the lovely yard which was sun-filled during a brilliant warm weekend in April. There are great places to eat within walking distance - including fabulous coffee shops and fantastic pizza at the Masonry.  We loved being able to walk down to the beach too.  Definitely a great place to stay if you want to experience a thriving neighbourhood a little outside of the downtown core."
481220,12224822,2014-04-26,14407252,Tom,"We were very happy with this apartment and location. Nadine and her husband were very welcoming and helpful.  We usually stay in hotels downtown but it was such a nice change to stay in the outskirts of this beautiful Queen Ann neighborhood. There are spectacular views just a street above the apartment where we could take beautiful runs around the area.  A very nice grocery store and wonderful restaurants are within blocks. We found the walk to Pike's Place to be about 40 min. A little long when it's raining but ok. We grabbed a cab if it was late. The apartment is just the right size for 2 adults and 2 older children. Not cramped, nice bathroom and kitchen. The set up was perfect with two separate rooms. We definitely would recommend this apartment and we would go back."
481220,12337968,2014-04-29,5166419,Jay,"Amazing house and gorgeous apartment, very clean, spacious and well decorated. Lovely yard, neighborhood is great, close to transport. Nadine was easy to communicate with and very nice. Great spot!"
481220,13276388,2014-05-24,14079975,Megan,"We only stayed for a couple of days but Nadine had beer waiting for us on arrival (which was perfect!), helped us navigate Seattle, and even offered to drive us to the ferry terminal on our last day so we didn't have to carry our big heavy bags around."
481220,13399623,2014-05-27,4840714,Chereen,"We stayed at Nadine and Mark's apartment twice in May and it was an absolute pleasure. The flat is conveniently furnished and we had everything we could possibly need for our stay there.  I remember reading a review that Nadine thought about everything a tourist could possibly need and made sure it was available. This was absolutely true. I guess this is because they are such avid travelers themselves. Nadine usually leaves some baked goodies for her guests but I warned her about our dietary restrictions. Instead she left us some delicious fruit. Nadine and Mark were fabulous hosts and in all my Airbnb experiences staying at their apartment was by far the best. They have set the bar high and I now expect this kind of service everywhere, I go! I would recommend their flat to anybody looking for a place to stay in Seattle. Just a warning to tall people the ceilings and doorposts are quite low. My husband is 195cm and knocked his head a few times when he wasn't paying attention. Nadine and Mark, thank you for a great stay! You were fantastic! I look forward to meeting you in Cape Town one day."
481220,14185040,2014-06-14,344327,David,"Nadine's Garden apartment was perfect for our stay in Seattle, on the lower level of a wonderful old house the apartment is beautifully appointed and comfortable. Nadine met us as we arrived and was the perfect host and on hand for anything that we needed during our stay. Which was particularly useful when our flights were cancelled on the day we left and we needed to urgently arrange new accommodation (Nadine was fully booked), Nadine let us hang out in her house until we had sorted ourselves out. She was also very gracious when we confessed that we had broken the coffee carafe...

The apartment is in a great location, there are bars and restaurants a short walk away and the Space Needle and Pike Place market are also easily accessible on foot."
481220,14260487,2014-06-16,10956565,Sheri,"Nadine and Mark and their two dogs are the perfect hosts. They helped us with our luggage and got us situated. We were pretty busy so we didn't have much time to visit with Nadine and Mark. They gave us our privacy but were easily available when something came up. The apartment is so nicely decorated, fresh and clean. And you can't beat the location for access to downtown, restaurants and public transportation. "
481220,14676403,2014-06-24,11304187,Stephanie,"Our time at Nadine & Markwas wonderful. The appartment is clean and cosi. The two are Great hosts, who really help you out with every question. We were able to use their BBQ and could use the entire Garden. Our kids had so much Fun playing with a Big box of legos and they loved Bell - the dog.

Thank you, Nadine & Mark for your Support and the warm welcome. We hope to come back!!!"
481220,15034694,2014-07-01,10598,Sarah,"This place was wonderful. Just as described, comfortable and cozy. Our hosts were so nice and made sure we had everything we needed. Would definitely stay here again!"
481220,15442309,2014-07-09,12650590,Teresa,"My Seattle Sanctuary!  The apartment is beautiful and serene. It is so well decorated and cozy, the bed is incredibly comfy...it is just a joy to be in this apartment.  The gardens and yard are wonderful, and I enjoyed walking them while having my morning coffee. Now, about my hosts...the most gracious, friendly, fun, easy to talk to, accommodating people I've ever met. Nadine and Mark are just wonderful people and I hope to see them (and Bella & Stanley), and stay at this sanctuary again soon."
481220,15567616,2014-07-12,9527307,David,"wonderful !  we were 2 couples. the place is very roomy,  pleasent and convinient. a garden table to have wine  in the evening under the stars. and , most importent: NADINE is hosting with all her hart. whaterver wish or need - it is alwasy ""yes"".
and, after a day in downtown - take a day at this neiborhood: full of quiet charm, restaurants, small shops, and great view from top of the hill (the view comes with a little workout) "
481220,15858566,2014-07-17,4674790,Karin,"Best place to explore Seattle. Close to everything by foot or public transport. It was great to return to nadines and marks quiet, clean and comfy place after a day of sightseeing. We stayed with three kids and this worked out fine. I can't imagine a better place to stay in town. Nadine was super helpful with any information needed. Thanks again!"
481220,15998952,2014-07-20,10057349,Cath,"As a family of four we couldn't have found a better place to stay.  Nadine welcomed us personally, brought us a cold beer each and was really friendly and easy going.  Her apartment is clean, well stocked and a great location- walking dustance to space needle and monorail to down town, bus c routes, the best breajfasts and great supermarkets.   We would recommend to anyone and we are very pleased to have stayed there.  Thank (website hidden) we also liked the look of the airstream you rent out too!"
481220,16456778,2014-07-28,11653915,Beate,"Der Aufenthalt im Garden Apt. von Nadine war wunderbar. Alles ist so schön wie auf den Bilder. Die Gegend ist sehr ruhig und sicher. Man ist schnell mit dem Bus Downtown und in Laufnähe zur Space Needle. Wir haben und dort sehr wohl gefühlt. Nadine war sehr nett und hilfsbreit. Wir würden jederzeit wieder dort übernachten, wenn wir in Seattle wären."
481220,16649232,2014-07-31,11772300,Alfred,"Excellent location, very nice and comfortable apartment.
Nadine was a very knowledgable and friendly host.
I highly recommend this location.
 "
481220,16893813,2014-08-04,1101873,Dena,"Our stay at Nadine's garden apartment was wonderful. The unit was extremely clean, comfortable, and inviting. The beds were very comfortable for our group of 4 and the sheets, towels, and pillows all in great condition. Nadine was an easy going host and gave great recommendations to nearby restaurants and activities. The area was very walkable and I would love to stay here again. "
481220,17447769,2014-08-12,747594,Stefani,"We stayed here in the midst of a two-week road trip where we stayed in a total of nine hotels. Our experience at Nadine's was far and above any of those other places, including some pretty ritzy hotels.

She left coffee for us and creamer in the refrigerator, plenty of guide books and maps and extra pillows, sheets and towels. Another major plus was that she left laundry soap to use with the washer and dryer so we were able to do our laundry! 

I could go on and on with all the extra amenities she provided, but basically, it was like living in a home away from home. 

The apartment is also in the best neighborhood in Seattle, where from the front of the house, you can see the water, and from two blocks up, you get the classic, postcard view of downtown Seattle, the water and the mountains beyond.

She was also really helpful with local recommendations. We had a great meal at her recommended restaurant just around the corner. 

It was so great we talked the whole trip about moving to Seattle!"
481220,17838263,2014-08-18,15740179,Raelynn,"This one of the most perfect places to stay. Nadine was the perfect hostess. The place was super cute and very clean and comfortable. If you are looking to stay near the space needle or in QA stay here! walking distance to the seattle center, blocks away from kerry park and one of my absolute favorite restaurants for breakfast happy hour and dinner (petit toulouse). Had a very pleasant stay, will stay again, and recommend to friends and family!"
481220,18161205,2014-08-23,11324591,Myrna,"We really loved the garden apartment! We stayed for five nights and we immediately felt at home. Nadine was very, very friendly. She even welcomed us with croissants and other delicious treats. The apartment was very clean and Nadine obviously did a great job furnishing and decorating the place. Very comfy beds. We stayed with our two sons (5 and 2 years old) and that worked out perfectly; especially with the box of Lego Nadine left for them. Only a short walk (steep hill!) for the most amazing view over Seattle. The bus takes you downtown in ten minutes and shops/restaurants (great Thai!) just around the corner. Absolutely no negative feedback: highly recommended!"
481220,18396577,2014-08-26,6179007,Christine,"Gracious hosts with an uber chic apt with premium furnishings. The suite comfortably provides a division of space for more than a couple.  Nadine and Mark have a beautiful set up in the heart of Seattle.  Despite some lost privacy due to the traffic back to the airstream and the dogs, it is a lovely space.  "
481220,18619687,2014-08-29,17267857,Alison,"Had a perfect experience staying in this apartment; it was clean and had everything we needed for our 4 day stay.  Nadine was terrific, and was able to answer any questions we had about the neighborhood, transportation, things to do, etc.  This historic home was a gem in a lovely neighborhood central to all things Seattle.   I would recommend unconditionally, and this will be the first place I check if I decide to return to Seattle."
481220,18786723,2014-09-01,15344418,Jeremy,The house is gorgeous and perfectly situated for making trips into the city. Nadine made us feel welcome and gave us some tips for navigating the area that worked great. Arriving to find some fresh baked cookies and a few things in the fridge was fantastic. Our family of four had a great time hanging out and playing cards after a long day in the city. Made me want to move back to Seattle!
481220,19066451,2014-09-06,12868359,Torina,"We had a great stay at Nadines place. The location in Queen Anne was really cosy and near to Kerry Park, a great spot to take pics of Seattles Skyline, as well as Seattle Center. 
The Appartment was clean, comfortably and well equipped. Nadine was able to answer all our questions and wellcomed us with some beer and snacks at our arrival. I would definetly recommend this place."
481220,19368316,2014-09-11,6646371,Vegard,Great apartment in quiet area. Excellent for our stay in Seattle. Service-minded host. Highly recommendable!
481220,19672132,2014-09-16,2743991,Jason,"Nadine and Mark were wonderful guests willing to help in anyway we needed. The apartment was fantastic, clean and has everything you need for your stay. The location is close to downtown Seattle but located in a very nice hood which makes you feel like your not caught in the hustle and bustle of a busy city. I would definately stay again. "
481220,19848588,2014-09-19,19080672,Ralph,"We absolutely loved staying here and the only thing I hated was that I couldn't stay longer! We were welcomed by Mark and he took his time in highlighting all the features of the apt. He even had with two cold beers in the fridge for us!

It's a short walk up to Kerry Park where you'll enjoy a beautiful view of Seattle and also a short walk away from Pagliacci's pizza which was really good.

Everything worked perfectly, from the TV to the washer and dryer which is convenient and allows you to pack light.

It's a cozy apartment and it really felt like a second home, I see myself booking this property again and again."
481220,20740487,2014-10-05,18305001,Oskar,"We were staying in Seattle over a weekend for a conference and were happy to stay at this great apartment.  It felt like staying at a suite, the host Nadine had baked the best spiced pumpkin bread and left cold beer in the fridge.  What a way to welcome somebody after a 8 hour flight :)  She was very helpful and gave us great recommendations on nearby restaurants (btw we recommend Toulouse Petit for brunch)  Its in a quiet neighbourhood and very central.  We found the place to be very clean and well equipped with a nice kitchenette and a washer and dryer.  Will defiantly come here a again, next time we are in Seattle."
481220,21000359,2014-10-09,8058900,Cheryl,"Our host and the flat were delightful. I loved the neighborhood, too, and would consider staying there again. The kitchen was a bit sparce for a longer stay--e.g., no oven, few pots and pans, etc., but we didn't care to do much cooking so it was fine for us.

The bed was super comfy and in a windowless room, which I thought I might not like but, instead, I loved it! It was like a round enchanted cave."
481220,21192047,2014-10-13,9271034,Cathy,"Suite is just as glorious as in the photos!  Beautifully appointed, loads of space and great amenities.  Nadine and Mark were super hosts.  Nice and friendly, without being intrusive.  Two cold beers were waiting in the fridge, warm ginger loaf upon arrival and a bottle of red bought down.  We couldn't have been happier or had a nicer stay.  Plus the location is great.  We left the car in the driveway, walked and took transit all over the city whcih was super easy. "
481220,21697704,2014-10-22,14890816,Leslie,"We were warmly greeted by Nadine upon our arrival, and found the apartment and the neighborhood to be OUTSTANDING...as well as the delicious bread and wine that our hosts had waiting for us!  It is everything we expected, and more.  It was extremely comfortable for 4 of us, with the two bedrooms and a separate sitting area...plus a very nice kitchen.  Squeaky clean, and beautifully decorated it is part of a very lovely historic house.  As an added bonus, their friendly dog Belle would pay a visit every morning, and is welcome to come in and get some loving.  The location is really great.  We love to walk, and it was easy for us to hike to downtown, the Space Needle, Pike's Market and all the things you would want to see.  Go up the hill one block, and you see Seattle's best view from Kerry Park.  We would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Seattle.  An A+ experience.  Many thanks to our friendly hosts."
481220,22354154,2014-11-04,3560923,Itxaso,"We had a wonderful stay at Nadine and Mark's apartment. We absolutely loved the place in the quiet neighborhood. We had all we needed and we all thought (four of us) that sleeping in the beds felt like heaven; so comfortable. Mark welcomed us and was very nice to show us the place and tell us about everything we needed to know. They gave us a bottle of wine and delicious pumpkin bread, too. They thought of every detail. 
We would definitely come back and recommend it to friends. Thank you, Mark and Nadine!"
481220,22584423,2014-11-10,10521590,Ken,Nadine was an excellent host. The apartment is in a great part of town and beautifully decorated. Nadine had a bunch of great ideas for places to go and places to see. This was a great experience. 
481220,24805278,2015-01-03,19055481,Lillian,"Both the apartment and hosts were fantastic.  Nadine greeted us with freshly baked pumpkin bread (delicious!) and cold beers.  The apartment was immaculate and the decor beautiful, with all the mod cons one could wish for.  We would certainly stay there again and recommend Nadine's apartment most highly, along with the stunning Queen Anne area, to anyone visiting Seattle."
481220,25182740,2015-01-08,17655008,Katherine,"We were welcomed with wine and tasty pumpkin bread!  Great place--we would recommend it.  Parts of the ceiling are not much more than 6 feet, so if you are very tall you will have to watch your head.  Perfect for a family of four.  The Seattle tourist info was very useful.  The location was very convenient to down town."
481220,25717084,2015-01-24,13370850,Andrew,"Nadine was a great host, the apartment was fantastic and in a great location. We really enjoyed our stay and it was a comfortable fit for the 4 of us.
Thanks again and we hope to stay with you again."
481220,26509620,2015-02-14,295374,S L,"PERFECT accommodations!  We were welcomed with a smile, bottle of wine, and banana bread in addition to our cozy apartment 'just the right size'. We chose this apartment since we know Seattle weather can be fickle. So, if we were holed up due to weather, we'd have a nice place to hang out, cook in, relax and rejuvenate. Truly, it was as if we were staying in a friend's apartment. Free parking, pretty neighborhood, easy access to all areas of the city, terrific 'home' ambiance. ALL pictures and information are 100% accurate. Can't wait to return 2016!"
481220,26678732,2015-02-17,18462882,Michelle,A lovely neighbourhood and warm place to stay. Hosts left very good instructions to make it easy to settle in. 
481220,27186041,2015-02-27,28079368,Zou,除了房间的布局和我们理解的不一样，不太适合2人以上居住。其他感觉不错，房东也很热情。
481220,27506170,2015-03-06,560455,Andre,"Greeted us at the door at 11:15 PM, very accommodating with our flight being late in from Austin TX.  Conveniently located at the SW base of QA, near Pesos and Cafe Ladro. "
481220,27602743,2015-03-08,27965722,Katie,"Our stay with Nadine was fabulous! A perfect fit for the five of us over a sunny beautiful weekend in Seattle and GREAT location! We had no trouble finding it, parking was a dream, and she even left a bottle of wine and croissants for us to enjoy. A perfect getaway, so clean and tidy, stocked fully with coffee and fresh cream, and everything within walking distance. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a fabulous stay in Seattle!"
481220,27921714,2015-03-15,26032883,Talia,"What a lovely, comfortable, stylish, easy, welcoming home!!!  Nadine, thank you for your generosity, the half n' half and croissants, the huge tv to watch my squad play horribly (again), and just the overall warmth of your home!  It was perfect!!"
481220,28391222,2015-03-23,10469691,Jennifer,"Nadine and Mark were the perfect hosts - communication was great, the apartment was exactly as pictured and super clean and comfortable, and their historic home is beautiful! They were both so friendly and easy-going and offered great suggestions for restaurants and coffee shops nearby and a playground for our 3 year old right below Kerry Park. We had croissants, water, wine and creamer waiting for us upon arrival which was such a nice welcome since we hadn't had a chance to stop on the way to the apartment. The apartment has everything you would need for a comfortable stay and they definitely make you feel welcome and at home. We had our 3 year old and 9 month old along with us and it was a great apartment for them - and the outdoor area is beautiful and was fun for the older one to explore. The location is great - going up or down the hill there are tons of options for restaurants and coffee shops and cute shops if you go up Queen Anne. We had a wonderful visit and would definitely stay here again! Thanks so much!"
481220,28667440,2015-03-28,9060498,Donna,The apartment was true to description.  Nadine greeted us upon arrival.  It was a great fit for a family of four.  The location is fabulous with one of the best views of Seattle just a few blocks away!!!  We would definitely go back!
481220,28939205,2015-04-01,27758644,Yi,"Perfect place to live and experience Seattle, the host (Nadine) is VERY helpful! This is the best living experience you can expect! The location is perfect, you can WALK to space needle, EMP museum, and we even walked to pike place market. It's close to everything. There's many grocery stores and many restaurants nearby. 
The house is clean, tidy, bright. A lot of things are provided so you don't need to bring many things. Overall, this is the perfect place to live if you want to visit Seattle.  Everything is perfect!"
481220,29192935,2015-04-05,15031548,Jiajia,Mike and Nadine were great hosts with a unique and home away from home. I would greatly recommend this place to anyone looking for a place around downtown Seattle. 
481220,30219680,2015-04-19,29620312,Josh,"Nadine's home is as beautiful as the photos indicate, and she and her husband were very welcoming. We arrived to a gift of beer and scones, and Nadine showed us around and told us about a nearby park that boasted a beautiful view of the city. The patio was pleasant for reading and drinking coffee in the mornings. The walk to EMP and the Space Needle was short, pleasant, and safe. We would have been happy to spend more time simply relaxing in the apartment."
481220,30687350,2015-04-26,25304383,Esra,"Nadine was a great host. We were welcomed to her lovely place with a warm greeting when we arrived. We were very touched by seeing her sweet little message for our anniversary along with a bottle of wine and delicious croissants on the kitchen counter. We are keeping that note as a memory of our trip. She gave us great suggestions for dinner and we ended up going to Etta's for Italian food that night and it was quite good. 

Nadine's place was very spacious, warm, and we had everything we needed to feel at home for our short stay there. Her garden was so pretty. My only regret is not spending enough time in that beautiful garden. Location was great and it was in walking distance to all the places we wanted to visit during our stay. 

We highly recommend staying at Nadine's place if you are traveling Seattle."
481220,31244283,2015-05-03,30183183,Karen,"We loved our stay! The house is so adorable and the apartment itself was amazing. It was a great location, not too far from downtown and had some great restaurants around the corner. Only thing I would say is that the wifi does not work so well. I would recommend!"
481220,32570038,2015-05-19,20992946,Brian,"Nadine's Garden Apt was a great place to base our Seattle outings.  It was very open, light, spacious, and very clean!  Nadine was very helpful, and a great host: she met us there even though we were an hour late!  Always responded very quickly to text's we sent, when my son and GF stopped by, she directed them to the Apt, managed parking of the cars in the driveway, but otherwise was very unobtrusive.

Her place is two blocks from the iconic spot where post card photos of Seattle are taken, and a few blocks from the Space Needle and all it's attractions.  In other words, a perfect location.

If you are traveling to Seattle to see the sights, this is the place to stay!"
481220,32910433,2015-05-23,31929909,Donna,"The apartment was just like the pictures. Very cozy and right in the middle of everything. We loved the Queen Anne neighborhood and enjoyed being one of a few single residence in the area. We walked across a foot bridge, then along the waterfront to get to downtown. The Seattle Center was talking distance in another direction. The local restaurants were fabulous. 
We loved having Nadine as our friendly resource. We just wouldn't have had the Seattle Experience without her.
Nadine made our apartment so warm with all her thoughtful touches. We had a wonderful time. Thank you, Nadine. If you ever want to visit Boise, we would love to have you stay with us. Sincerely, Donna and Steve"
481220,33232432,2015-05-26,28318768,Katy,Wonderful location and excellent host. Can't say enough great things. Near several parks and nice grocery stores. Walking distance to everything. Will be back!
481220,33673997,2015-05-31,14110958,Chris,"Nadine was very welcoming and helpful. She even left us some beers in the fridge!  The apt was GREAT,  very comfortable has everything you'd need for a stay.  There is a nice garden and patio area and your own access via the garden. The house that the apt is part of (the basement) is very unique (in a good way).
GREAT location with a short-medium (15-30 mins) walk into Seattle centre and close to the space needle (science centre) and kerry park area (although that has a steep hill to get to, which should not be an issue to healthy person) .. all in all, very good !

The neighbourhood was quiet (quite bohemian with a street of good/decent eateries and basic shopping- if you want more then head into town) ..   "
481220,34735997,2015-06-11,20392204,Liz,"Nadine made us feel extremely welcome, she provided helpful tips upon arrival. Their home was in a fantastic location, within walking distance of most popular areas. We rented a car and didn't end up needing it as we were able to walk most of Seattle. Their space was clean, comfortable, quiet and very relaxing. We will definitely try to stay here again, when back in Seattle!"
481220,35058346,2015-06-15,18456739,Gretchen,"Wow! This was our best stay ever in Seattle! Nadine was welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed.  We were in town for our daughters graduation from SPU. We were able to walk to the venue at Seattle center, but despite being so close to the city center it was so quiet and relaxing at the apartment.  I wish I had found this 4 years ago when our daughter first attended SPU! Thank you Nadine for the perfect weekend! We LOVED it!"
481220,35378007,2015-06-18,7488141,Reinhold,Conveniently located quaint apartment in Queen Anne. Nadine was an excellent host. Our train was 5 hours late and made our arrival at 2 AM. Nadine responded quickly to our update and made our arrival smooth.    The apt had all the amenities we needed. Plenty of great places to eat within walking distance. Nadine's recommendations for meals were spot on every time. 
481220,35998247,2015-06-24,26298419,Ivanova Maricela,"Nadine's Garden Apartment was beautiful, clean and comfortable. My family and I had a great time at Seattle due to the location of the apartment. The Apartment had hairdryer, scissor and iron which helped a lot. Nadine was very friendly and a great host: she met us there even though we arrive very late. The dogs are so cute and friendly. The garden is gorgeous and a great place to relax and chat. The Wi-Fi connection worked pretty well.
We are very happy with our visit and we totally recommend this apartment because of its location, host and beautiful and friendly dogs.
"
481220,36274976,2015-06-27,3116780,Patrick,"Nadine and Mark could not have been better  hosts. They are truly AirBnB professionals and their basement apartment was lovely. 

Four of us (plus a 2 year old) stayed for two nights. Their home is conveniently located in the quiet and beautiful Queen Ann neighborhood. It was very easy to get around the neighborhood and into the city and surrounding neighborhoods. The basement apartment opens up into a beautiful garden, which was great for relaxing after a day of exploring the city. 

I definitely recommend staying with Nadine and Mark. They are very kind and maintain amazing rentals on their property. "
481220,37023528,2015-07-03,31421267,Mj,Amazing experience and stay. Nadine and her husband were incredibly friendly and hospitable. It was our first time in Seattle and Nadine's recommendations were on point! Would definitely stay again and recommend to a friend!
481220,37552796,2015-07-08,20129345,Marwin,"Nadine and Mark's garden apartment was the perfect place for our trip.  Comfortable, clean and tons of character.  The neighborhood of Queen Anne was  a great place to explore!  Nadine was very helpful with great tips about the neighborhood/attractions/restaurants etc.  and even provided us chairs and a blanket to make our 4th of July fireworks much more comfortable.  Would definitely recommend the place to friends and family staying in the Seattle area.  Great hosts!"
481220,37775407,2015-07-10,26273784,Karen,"Nadine was a wonderful & genuine hostess! She welcomed us when we arrived (made us feel like old friends) she was very accomindating, loved to share helpful information about her neighborhood & the city. The Garden Apt. was exactly like the discription & picks. It was only a 10min walk or so to the Space Needle, Safeway, and local restaurants (The Mecca is a must for breakfast). The Garden Apt is a must stay"
481220,38102647,2015-07-13,27360258,Nicole,"Just wonderful! We were switching from other place to Nadine's place, earlier than expected. She graciously said we could bring our bags over early and that she would text us when the apartment was ready. She greeted us at the door. Gave us additional information so that our day out in Seattle was better than expected.  The apartment is  just as it is pictured. We loved the space and the layout!   The bathroom is very bright, which is helpful when getting ready in the morning. Having a washer and dryer was perfect, as we had been traveling for 2 weeks and catching up on the laundry was a treat. Nadine has little extras which makes it possible not to hit the grocery store for coffee first thing. We highly recommend this Garden Apartment, as the location is perfect and the walk to downtown isn't overwhelming, just the right amount of going and coming! Thanks again, Nadine! You are a gem and we loved meeting your dogs too! :)"
481220,38444881,2015-07-15,14910539,Shaunna,"AirBnB perfection! From the quick initial communication and personal greeting to the beautiful digs, our experience could not have been better. Super clean and fully stocked with everything we needed for a relaxing evening, great sleep and refreshing start to each day. This place is as described and as beautiful as the photographs depict. Looking forward to returning again! "

481220,39396086,2015-07-23,35162333,Keith,"Everything was as described.  The neighborhood was great and easy walk to space needle, EMP and monorail to downtown.  Never even had to move our car. "
481220,39742588,2015-07-26,11265557,Nita,"This was a wonderful experience and wish I could have stayed longer! Nadine went above and beyond to welcome me to this lovely apartment.  It was perfectly located within walking distance to restaurants, grocery and Seattle Center.  The apartment had everything you could possibly need or want.  The beds and linens were cozy and comfortable.  The kitchen stocked with coffee, fresh cream and croissants!"
481220,40079129,2015-07-28,29746918,Eileen,"Nadine was an absolutely wonderful host.  Greeted us when we arrived early and helped us with our suitcases which she kept in her apt until we could get into our unit. Texted us when the apt was available and when we arrived back after a very busy day all our very heavy suitcases were in our apt. Left goodies in the fridge as well as maps, etc. Helped us with restaurant choices, transportation around town, directions, etc.  Could not have been a more wonderful experience.  "
481220,40881782,2015-08-03,3442832,Debbie And Chris,"We had a wonderful time at Nadine's home. The Garden Apt. was excellent for 4 of us. We stayed here for 5 nights for our son's wedding. Nadine was friendly, accommodating and helpful.  The home is beautiful and clean- it was a perfect resting spot for us during a very busy time. The location is perfect- and convenient for activities down town.  Highly recommend!!"

481220,42423371,2015-08-13,38127330,Elizabeth Suzie,"We had a lovely stay in Nadine and Mark's basement apartment. Nadine was warm, welcoming, and even left us scones and a bottle of wine. The location is great. We walked to the Space Needle, EMP, Chihuly, the Sculpture Park, and Pikes Place Market. She let us park in her driveway and we didn't move it until we checked out. There is a very nice market nearby if you want to cook. The kitchen had everything we needed and the coffee, tea, and pitcher of cream in the fridge was especially appreciated the next morning. There is a charming patio where we relaxed with pre-dinner drinks. The beds were comfortable for our family of four and the apartment is nicely decorated. Nadine and Mark have put a lot of thought into making it feel like your home away from home. We hope to return soon. A very pleasurable stay."
481220,43036593,2015-08-17,10137667,Marni,"We did not meet Nadine, but she was very helpful in the initial phases of booking the delightful garden apartment in Seattle. Mark and Nadine were flexible about our check-in time.

Mark greeted us and was a super helpful host, orienting us to the area, giving us suggestions about places to eat, and walks to do.

Mark also made us yummy banana bread on our first morning, going above and beyond!

The apartment had everything we needed including a bottle of wine which was very generous. The makings for coffee, tea and even a pot of cream were provided.

The location is fantastic, as it was walking distance from the Seattle Center, the space needle, the Chihuly and Experience museums."
481220,43672077,2015-08-21,39933878,Sherry,"Great location and beautiful home.  Everything was as described, very clean and comfortable. Nadine was a perfect host. The location was private, nicely appointed and had lots of little extras - really appreciated the yummy banana and  wine. We'll be back!"
481220,44771988,2015-08-29,36170286,Elizabeth,"This was our first airbnb experience and Nadine and Mark set the bar high. The apartment is just as advertised--light, airy, in perfect condition (not to mention a perfect location) and with all the amenities and thoughtful touches you could hope for on a visit to Seattle (maps, umbrellas, first-aid kit, etc.) and it worked out perfectly for our family of four. Nadine immediately greeted us upon arrival, and made herself available if we had any questions/concerns during our stay. I would highly recommend this property to a couple or a family looking for a city retreat.    "
481220,45061462,2015-08-31,6721899,Simone,"Our stay at Nadine's place was fantastic. The apartment was beautiful and spacious, the location was just walking distance to Seattle Centre + many great restaurants in Queen Anne. Nadine was welcoming and helpful. We loved the wine/muffins! Would stay here again."
481220,45568504,2015-09-04,14123478,Danielle And Joel,"Nadine's basement apartment is well designed and comfortable. It was spacious enough for 4 people, and the kitchen was well appointed for making meals. Easy walking distance to restaurants, grocery store, Space Needle, EMP and Chihuly Museum. Check in and check out was easy. Nadine was an excellent host and was helpful with directions."
481220,46705095,2015-09-13,34678629,Jennifer,"Nadine was great about keeping in contact with me. It was super easy to access the home, even though she wasn't there when I checked in. And I had plenty of parking space. The apartment itself is absolutely perfect and quaint, with a great patio for lounging in the sun. I used the space to host my bridesmaids, hair stylists and makeup artist on the day of my wedding. We all had plenty of room to get ready on my special day. And the groom and I stayed the night of the wedding here for a very romantic experience. I live in the Seattle area, but I would consider reserving this space again just for a night out on the town! 
"
481220,47030295,2015-09-15,31829878,Jeffrey,Nadine is a fantastic host and made us feel at home right away! This was our first AirBnB experience and it was great. The apartment is very clean and comfortable. The surrounding neighborhood has just about any type of food you can imagine. Great areas to walk with views of Seattle and very close to the Seattle Center where the Monorail and Space Needle are located. The Monorail takes you to a light rail station (Westlake) which makes getting around town very easy. We had a great time and would come back in an instant! Thank you Nadine.
481220,47371375,2015-09-18,8752317,Linda,"Lovely, lovely, lovely!!!  Everything about Nadine and Mark's place was wonderful.  From the moment we arrived to our departure, we felt very welcomed; from the freshly made scones to the bottle of wine!!  Everything was just terrific and if we are ever in the area again, we would definitely stay again.  Thanks so much to both of you for making our Seattle mini-vacation terrific!"
481220,47672610,2015-09-21,33769456,Deborah,All communication with Nadine was fast and easy.  I felt very prepared for a smooth arrival.  Nadine was very kind to leave us a bottle of wine and a plate of muffins.  The apartment is beautiful and very comfortable.  Many good restaurants in the neighborhood.  One of our primary destinations was the Chihully Museum which turned out to be walking distance from this apartment.  It was also great fun to be able to walk to blocks uphill for a fantastic view of Seattle - day and night.  I would definitely stay here again!
481220,48393646,2015-09-26,3676255,Jess,"Nadine communicated with us very well starting from before our trip. Check-in was smooth; she came out to meet us and showed us around the apartment. Nadine was friendly and made suggestions about things to do. She saw that we were a group of three and asked if we wanted an extra set of keys, which turned out to be really helpful. Her place is just like the pictures—comfortable and stylish—and had everything we could need, including plenty of extra linens. As a bonus, there was a bottle of wine. The neighborhood is quiet and not far from Kerry Park, which has an amazing view of Seattle. It's also close to many bus lines, which I used. All in all, Nadine did a wonderful job to make us feel welcome, and we would definitely stay again."
481220,49026144,2015-09-30,42805679,Hyejin,We had really great time at Nadine and Mark's place. It was clean and homey. Location was great. Easy to get public transportation and A local market in walking distance. Thanks again your homemade banana-bread!  :-)
481220,49455191,2015-10-04,3851957,Jenny,"We really enjoyed staying in this charming suite. The house and neighborhood was beautiful. It was clean and we'll decorated. Nadine the host was very easy to get in contact with and we appreciated the local restaurant recommendations. They even left us fresh muffins, coffee, and fresh cream in the fridge!  We would definitely stay here again!"
481220,50442381,2015-10-12,9481879,Teri,This is a wonderful flat in a fabulous neighborhood. Convenient to everything and packed with every amenity you might need for an extended (or brief) stay.  Nadine is fabulous and communicative and easy to work with.  I would happily stay here again next time I'm in town.
481220,51001072,2015-10-16,238234,Shauna,"Nadine was quick to respond, very accommodating and her quaint apartment was perfectly suited to my needs for an impromptu work trip. It was quiet, comfortable, and in a great location. Plenty of nearby restaurants, a grocery store, and great running paths along the water. Thanks Nadine!"
481220,53479518,2015-11-09,2079274,Julie,"The apartment is exactly as described, very well decorated and a wonderful retreat. It is close to Seattle Center and all that the area has to offer. Kerry Park, which is just a few blocks away, is one of the best vantage points for seeing the Seattle skyline. Thanks for everything, Nadine!"
481220,54989578,2015-11-27,25145150,Karla,"We had a wonderful time staying at Nadine's apartment! It was just enough room for the four of us (two adults, and two kids). She has clearly put thought into what a guest would need for an overnight stay, and has also added a few extra special touches. It was a very quiet street in a beautiful neighborhood. The apartment was clean and had all the amenities one would need for a while. Note: there is no oven, but it does have a small kitchenette with a couple burners/microwave/fridge. Be sure to head up 2nd Ave a block or so to Kerry Park to see the amazing view. We also enjoyed eating breakfast (and dinner) at Petit Toulouse nearby. Close enough to downtown, but away from the bustle. "
481220,56520603,2015-12-14,20730202,David,"Nadine was very accommodating with our checkin uncertainty and was there to meet me at her beautiful historic and well cared for place was perfect for a walking visit to the neighborhood for 4 days, very comfortable, clean, smart and spacious, everything was perfect for 3 adults and 1 toddler.  Super easy ground level access.  Would highly recommend!"
490076,13479778,2014-05-28,14703146,Andrew,"My parents stayed at Ann's apartment during their recent visit. They enjoyed the location with both walking distance to both upper and lower Fremont. The neighborhood had beautiful lush foliage, and the kitchen was well-stocked with utensils and cooking gear. Ann provided tourist information about Seattle and Fremont, which helped us plan things to do. Overall, they enjoyed their stay."
490076,13695442,2014-06-02,8163269,Cristina,"We had a wonderful time staying in Fremont. Ann was a very attentive and available host. The property was close to many restaurants, cafes, and bars, as promised. 
"
490076,14134642,2014-06-12,1582946,Wen,"Ann was a wonderful host.  Very responsive and friendly.  The place was clean and comfortable.  And the neighborhood had many cafes, bars, and restaurants, just a short walk away."
490076,14281947,2014-06-16,14689149,Bing,"Ann was nice and responsive. The place was cozy and at a very good location. It is about 7 min walk from the heart of Fremont so you get to enjoy the area easily with quiet nights to sleep on. I was able to get my groceries from a PCC supermarket nearby.
There is an outdoor fireplace that I didn't get to use (but totally should) during my stay. It's a good place to be if you want to be relaxed and hang out with friends."
490076,14495010,2014-06-20,2633274,Stacey,Ann was an incredibly helpful host!  When my friend's flight was delayed she had no problem with a (very) late check-in - even picked her up at the airport  The apartment is as described and is an excellent location/neighborhood for visiting Seattle.  
490076,15488185,2014-07-10,14659435,Lee-May,"Our trip to Seattle was made possible by Ann and her awesome apartment. My husband and I traveled with our 1½ year old son for the first time out of California and everything was perfect.  The place is tucked away in a lush, hilly area with a beautiful garden and had all the amenities for our 12 night stay. Ann welcomed us warmly, providing us coffee from Lighthouse Roasters and tips on local grocery stores. She was accommodating (especially with the washer/dryer which we used many times), friendly, and respected our privacy.  She was so kind as to let us pick raspberries in her garden and, on July 4, invite us to watch fireworks. The location is ideal. The walkability score is high and is central for getting to/from sites of interest in the Seattle area. Though we were mostly there to visit friends, family, and sight see, we also liked just hanging out in the apartment. It is clean and quiet with natural lighting. The kitchenware and appliances are good and allowed us to enjoy several delicious meals.  The bed is comfortable and we all slept well.  Usually we are not big on TV but the one in the apartment is incredible. We were there during World Cup and watched several games in high def on a huge quality screen. Overall great host and wonderful place as a base for a family vacation.  My son called it “home” and at the end we didn’t want to leave!"
490076,16090192,2014-07-22,16093248,Dana,"We had a great time in the apartment in Fremont! it was perfect for our long weekend in town - convenient to everything, and Ann was very nice and helpful! Her garden was so beautiful!"
490076,17283328,2014-08-10,16334943,Lindsay,"Ann's place was awesome, exactly as she had described it. There are tons of cute little places right down the street, and it has easy access to public transportation. The house had everything we needed to cook and feel at home. "
490076,17608852,2014-08-15,9265924,Beatrice,"Tres bon accueil , emplacement parfait fremont est un emplacement idéal pour seattle calme , très
belle vue , plein de restaurant  et bar sympa à (website hidden) petite maison est parfaite tout ce que vous avez besoin est à dispo . Merci Ann pour votre accueil .Seattle est une ville très intéressante à visiter ainsi que ses alentours ."
490076,17852446,2014-08-18,3461694,Kathrin,"The photos of the place are very accurate, the host was friendly and accommodating and the neighborhood and location was perfect. Just about two blocks from the hip Fremont District. I had a brilliant time there because not only is it so green in the summer time, but you can hear a bit of the fog horns from the ships at night time, and really get that feel that you are in a nice, quiet, safe place!"
490076,18166262,2014-08-23,12004240,Andrea,Great location! Easy access to downtown via the bus and in walking distance to anywhere in Fremont. Bed was comfortable - Ann was very accommodating and quick to answer our questions. 
490076,18409026,2014-08-26,17221961,Lenore,"Ann was a great host.  She met us at the apartment during check in and walked us through her place.  As former Seattle residents, the Fremont location was a great home base for us to visit our old hang out spots in Ballard and explore new places in the surrounding neighborhoods. Parking in front of the apartment was very convenient as well.  Thanks, Ann!"
490076,18625247,2014-08-29,5031586,Anne,"We had a nice stay at Ann's apartment. She welcomed us with a bar of locally-made chocolate and was a great host.

The apartment itself is an oasis of peace and calm and yet only a couple of blocks walk away from literally dozens and dozens of great independent bars and restaurants of Fremont.
We actually ended up spending more time in Fremont than in downtown Seattle.
We also loved having breakfast in the garden with a great view over the hills.
If you are sensitive to light while you sleep it may be worth bringing an eye mask as the bedroom does get a lot of light in the morning. The bed is so comfy you won't want to get out!

Thanks Ann for welcoming us so warmly."
490076,18789721,2014-09-01,16142097,Tripper,"Ann was great. Good communication. It was a business trip so I didn't have that much time at the house, but it was nice having a cozy place to come home to after my long days. "
490076,19483436,2014-09-13,841159,Roxanne,"My husband and I were visiting our daughter in Seattle, so Roxanne made our reservation.  Our host, Ann, met us at 10pm because of our flight arrival which we appreciated. We had Theo's chocolate and Lighthouse coffee waiting for us in the morning. The location was perfect within walking distance to Freemont. The apartment was sufficient and the bed was extremely comfortable. As far as cleanliness goes, I felt like that was overlooked especially in the bathroom.  Leftover personal items from previous renters were in and around the  tub and sink area.  All in all, with a little more attention to detail this place would be charming."
490076,19877804,2014-09-20,19336030,Odile,"Logement très agréable , literie excellente, équipement suffisant, wifi  performant , lieu calme et bien situé pour rejoindre down Town . Je recommande ce airbnb."

The apartment is super comfortable, private, clean and has a sweet vibe to it. I can feel how much care Ann puts into renting out this space. Her list of local attractions was also useful."
490076,21229774,2014-10-13,21352886,Wil,"This is a fantastic little spot in the heart of Freemont. tons to do within just a short walk and a beautiful historic (if hilly) Seattle neighborhood. Ann was very sweet, easy to work with and a warm and gracious host (thanks for the wine and snacks Ann!). The apartment is a small finished basement but very sunny and doesnt feel stuffy at all. Great sunlight, super comfy bed. Shower and bathroom are small but sufficient. This was perfect for our trip and pretty much what we expected. "
490076,22166619,2014-10-31,3150315,Victoria,"Place not as nice as the pictures,will benefit from some remodeling, especially bathroom and windows and doors (very drafty). Pretty dark and cold in the winter, the heater wasn't quite enough. Kitchen was pretty nice and well equipped. Ann was very welcoming and helpful. Location wise close to center of Fremont, but be prepared to climb a couple of pretty steep blocks to get back."
490076,22271937,2014-11-02,11665349,Mike,"Thanks Ann for welcoming us into your home. We loved the privacy of your apt and the location is perfect in Fremont.
We hope to stay again."
490076,22695037,2014-11-12,20618932,Andrea,"Our stay at Anns apartment was wonderful! And her welcome couldn't have been nicer :) After flying for almost 24 hours from Spain, getting to her cozy home and seeing those wonderful beds was great! 
She explained where we could quickly go out to buy some organic food and she was very helpful with any other questions we had.
The apartment was really cozy and had everything that you could need for a weeks stay. It was warm and we felt at home.
She was helpful and available for anything that could come up. She even bought some beautiful tulips for us to have in the house!
The kitchen had everything you could need to cook and she even left some coffee and basic stuff to have breakfast.
The house is really close to the center of Fremont, a neighbourhood that is full of life during the day and the night.
We loved our stay and wouldn't hesitate to stay at Ann's again!
Thanks Ann! :)
Andrea, Alberto and Anna

490076,23297762,2014-11-28,23003155,Hanbo,The apartment is cute and sweet. My wife loves it. And it has all the cocking wares I need to prepare a simple meal. Thank you Ann for the nice host and the unbeatable price.
490076,23411399,2014-11-30,2134525,Anthony,"A rustic apartment close to the hip, Ballard neighborhood. If you're looking for an ultra modern apt with new appliances, this is not the place for you. The bed was comfortable and the bedroom was quiet. 

Ann was very communicative without being obtrusive and quick to handle any household issues."
490076,23581027,2014-12-05,15121499,Kathryn,"Ann is a wonderful host. She went out of her way to make sure that I was comfortable in my stay, even taking the time up upgrade a heating unit midway through the week as the temps were pretty low in Seattle that week. The location is great and the space has everything you need for an easy stay."
490076,24361889,2014-12-27,20707412,Julie,"Ann was the perfect host for the private getaway my husband and I were hoping for. She met us as soon as we arrived to show us the apartment and stayed in contact via text message when we had questions. Our gracious welcome included an organic bottle of wine, a wheel of brie (my favorite!), and dark chocolate with almonds. The apartment was just as described - cozy and comfortable with everything we could possibly need for our holiday getaway. And we loved that the place was tucked away up a hill and enveloped in greenery. The Fremont neighborhood is fantastic! Lots of independent shops, delicious restaurants, blocks away from the waterfront, and quick and easy access to public transit. We stocked up at the PCC market and ate at home quite a bit. Definitely take the Fremont walking tour and check out all the great art in the neighborhood!"
490076,24567854,2014-12-30,3092779,Jacob,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here! The location was awesome in the Fremont neighborhood- there was a lot to do nearby and downtown Seattle was a short drive away. The place was private, warm, and clean. Would definitely stay here again."
490076,24696290,2015-01-01,4066160,Richard,Great location. Easy to walk everywhere. The apartment was cozy and had everything we needed. There was even a fir pit in the backyard.
490076,25296249,2015-01-11,17741163,Elise,Such a beautiful apartment in the best location in Seattle. My mom and I so enjoyed hanging out and cooking in this clean and cozy spot! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a true home away from home! 
490076,25475776,2015-01-17,442771,Jess,Ann's place was just what we were looking for - a cozy little in law unit near our friend's apartment. Her pictures and description were accurate. We didn't really take advantage of the kitchen. All of our interactions with Ann were positive. Thanks again!
490076,25640015,2015-01-21,731115,Tyler,"Ann was a very warm and accommodating host. She held our bags in her own home for us on the morning we were scheduled to check-in while the apartment was getting prepared.

The apartment fits the description: super cool, cozy, quiet.The bed is comfortable and the kitchen allowed us to avoid eating out every meal during our stay in Seattle.

The location is great. Right in the heart of Fremont, one of Seattle's coolest neighborhoods. You can walk downhill just one or two blocks and find some fantastic food (I recommend a  grinder at Royal Grinders or deep dish pizza from Kylie's). My wife and I also loved how this was a great starting point for Brewery hopping (Fremont's, Hale's, Maritime Pacific, Bad Jimmy's wee all we had time to try).  

This is a great place to stay in Seattle.

490076,25911574,2015-01-29,1023598,Alyssa,The apartment is eclectic and fun. Ann was a great host and we enjoyed our stay. The location is definitely tucked away and was a little difficult to get to so don't be dismayed if you feel like you're headed into back-country on the dirt road when you're really in the heart of (email hidden)e apartment does exist.  It's an older home with lots of personality and feels very secluded in the midst of the city. 
490076,26425065,2015-02-12,1867193,Frank,A quiet place just a short walk away from the heart of Fremont. Host was generous with her time and getting me acclimated. Space was clean and well maintained. 
490076,26738580,2015-02-18,25664829,Cooper,"Ann met us in the driveway to show us around. She provided a bottle of wine and a chocolate bar for my fiancee and I on Valentine's day which was thoughtful. This was a really cozy and inviting place to be. Everything was very clean and worked the way it should. We had a fire one night which over-looked  a great view of the city. If you're looking for a great, welcoming place close to the water's edge in Fremont, this is it."
490076,26840346,2015-02-20,487475,Theresa,"Ann was a friendly host. The apartment was clean, large, and comfortable, and the location in Fremont is unbeatable. The wine and chocolates were a nice, appreciated touch."
490076,27271081,2015-03-01,3104076,Kirill,Ann was a very welcoming host. The location was perfect.
490076,27605034,2015-03-08,15653052,Noelle,"Ann was a really great host! She showed us around the apt right when we arrived and recommend a great place to grab some food in the neighborhood. The apartment was just as described and it was perfect for the two of us. The location is perfect! Right in the heart of Fremont area, in walking distance to many bars, restaurants, and live music venues. Also close to bus stops making it easy to get downtown and not deal with parking. We will definitely stay here again! "
490076,28252994,2015-03-21,26599286,Ornella,"Ann's apartment was a great base for exploring Seattle. It was comfortable and cozy, and in a great neighborhood. We loved being able to walk around in the heart of Fremont and running on the Burke-Gilman trail, while being close to public transportation to downtown and other neighborhoods. Our week in Seattle was incredible thanks to our lovely host."
490076,28425458,2015-03-23,26501722,Matt,Ann's place was just what we were hoping for: a cozy apartment in a great location that is walking distance from a number of things and a short ride from downtown. We had a wonderful time exploring Seattle. 
490076,28610446,2015-03-27,28263224,Hoangmy,Ann was really nice and warming towards us. She was flexible about the check-in time and we were really thankful for that. She showed us around the house and suggested how we can make good use of it. The house is really cute and nice. It is an old house but everything is well-furnished functions properly. Getting to the house is a bit tricky but it didn't bother us much. There were 4 of us and we got an extra airbed so it was comfortable. Fremont is a fun and safe neighborhood and it is really close to downtown so transportation was really easy. I enjoy our staying in Seattle and it was a good choice of accommodation. 
490076,28882292,2015-03-31,8488414,Rachel,Ann is a good host. She was waiting us to check in and showed us around the house and how to use everything of it. She also prepared wine and chocolate to welcome my family. The location is good and quiet. We drive car to downtown within ten minutes. Ann's lovely house is really value for money. Highly recommended.
490076,28988373,2015-04-02,3743475,Katrin,"This is a really nice place in the hills of Fremont. Private, cozy and in a good distance to lively Fremont. Per bus 15 min from downtown. Ann is a lovely host, we found a bottle of wine and some organic chocolate when we arrived and this was a lovely detail. Thank you, we would come again and recommend this place to everyone who wants to stay near to the city but in a calm neighborhood. Enjoy!
"
490076,29491639,2015-04-08,25450167,Katrina,"Ann's place was gorgeous. It really was like a country stay in the city. Possibly the only dirt track in seattle. Great views from the house, warm and cosy during cold days and nights. Ann made us feel welcome, greeted us on arrival and departure and left treats in the fridge. It was handy to have access to  washing machine, there was lots of space. Walking distance to PCC grocery, cool shops, bars and public transport. "
490076,29838886,2015-04-13,24039892,Christina,"A great deal for a great space. Ann was a gracious host, welcoming us when we got in late at night from our flight. Her place is in the perfect location, felt very neighborly and within walking distance of Fremont's great shopping, bars and restaurants. "
490076,30384686,2015-04-21,27759168,Kelly,"Both Ann and her apartment were fantastic! This was our first Airbnb experience and it was perfect. We arrived later than expected and Ann was very accommodating. The place was fresh and bright. (lots of windows!) We were very happy to find fresh flowers, wine and chocolate waiting for us. Next time we are in Seattle we will absolutely stay here again AND will recommend it to our friends. "
490076,30690259,2015-04-26,15102874,Josie,"I have just loved staying here! This place feels like home. Ann did a great job greeting me, explaining how to use the place and where things are at, and then let me be here. I'm amazed at how comfortable this stay has been. Every room is well equipped to handle my needs, and the place is decorated in a charming, quaint, relaxed way. This is located in the center of a block, so there isn't even any traffic noise, it feels like a retreat. I will certainly return."
490076,31130342,2015-05-02,1229638,Gabe,"Ann was a wonderful, welcoming host - she shared some wonderful gluten-free muffins and provided a super rich (>80% cacao) chocolate bar on arrival. 

The place was as described - a little funky but exactly what one would expect for Fremont and certainly well worth the money. I didn't lounge in the garden but would have had there been more time. "
490076,32178523,2015-05-15,30291629,Sarah,"We had a great stay at Ann's place in Fremont!  Ann communicated well with us ahead of our trip and greeted us upon our arrival.   The space was comfortable with a great bed and a shower with great pressure and hot water.  There were lots of nice surprises for us in the apartment:  water, wine, chocolate, fruit, breakfast foods, maps and brochures, soap, and shampoo.  Ann was available to answer any questions we had and responded quickly to any needs.   The home is close to everything in Fremont . . . a great walk anywhere!  We recommend ""Super cool in artsy Fremont"".    
 "
490076,32375593,2015-05-17,5815632,Ryan,"Great secluded getaway in the heart of Seattle. Near to fremont but off any main roads. Bed was super comfy, everything was clean and the place was well-equipped. Ann was an amazing host and made sure we had everything we needed and helped out. Will definitely look to come back again!"
490076,32843404,2015-05-22,32587481,Tracy,"Ann is a great host and the place is wonderful! You can walk to shops, bars and restaurants!   I would definitely stay again when I come back to Seattle!!! "
490076,33112266,2015-05-25,24803417,Mallory,"Ann was super accommodating to our group. She went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed and then some. Wine, chocolate and a helpful map outlining places to visit within the city were all appreciated. The space was clean and exactly like the pictures. The neighborhood itself is one of my favorite in Seattle. I would definitely recommend Ann's space to family and friends. "
490076,33410213,2015-05-27,9270685,Kristin,"We enjoyed our stay at Ann's place. She was very kind, welcoming, and communicative. The apartment was well-equipped and conveniently located. I would recommend Ann's apartment. "
490076,33656624,2015-05-31,28836102,Lynda,What a great place to stay.  It was quiet and very beautiful.  The garden is peaceful and the bed was comfy.  Thank you Anne for being a great host.  Lynda
490076,35076046,2015-06-15,17911298,Sissi,"The location of the house is very good, is not far from downtown by foot but peaceful.
Ann carefully arranged the cute suit,make me feel warm every detail.
She is very kindly,recommended us tourist tractions,and buy us beautiful flowers to decorate the room.
She is a person who is good at communication and problem solving, we are sorry for troubling her .We hope she happy every day.
"
490076,35999931,2015-06-24,25819623,Marcos,Ann was an excellent host. She did a complete tour in the house during the check in and gave us total privacy during our stay. She also was very flexible allowing us to accommodate our 3 yrs old son that wasn't planned during the initial reservation. The location is perfect to enjoy Fremont by foot and very quiet too.
490076,36642010,2015-06-29,36826182,Karl,Wonderful quite place to stay. This is a quaint place to stay and provides the necessities for a comfortable stay. Ann was able to accommodate us very quickly which saved us a lot of time.
490076,36939275,2015-07-03,26691250,Mikkel,"Ann was great, and made us feel very welcome. The place was great - just like we hoped it to be. Ann had a great yard where we ate our meals."
490076,37170274,2015-07-05,8185182,Wenye,We had such a nice stay at Ann's charming apartment. Fremont was a great neighborhood to explore. Ann is a great host and very attentive to our needs. She accommodated our early check in and helped us find a spot to watch 4th of July fireworks. Will definitely stay again!
490076,37445886,2015-07-07,28518604,Jesse,"Ann greeted us at the apartment with a bottle of wine and a chocolate bar. She was very welcoming and easily accessible. We felt super welcome and the apartment was wonderfully located close to Fremont and everything else Seattle has to offer. 

Our only complaint is that the apartment feels a little bit like staying in a friend's basement. It has its own entrance but is still attached to the rest of the house and accessible by a door through the kitchen, so it was less private than we would've liked. You can also hear loud footsteps above your head, even at the designated quiet hours. Also note that the host has other listings for the house, so while you have the apartment, there are other private rooms being rented out, which may be some of the cause of the loud footsteps. "
490076,37862741,2015-07-11,12123114,Elizabeth,We had a great time in Seattle. Ann's place was close to everything we wanted to do. It was a great little place that was tucked away and secluded. Out on the back patio we had a great view of the city and it was a nice place to have coffee. The bed was very comfortable. Just everything was as we needed. Ann was very helpful when we got there and told us of places to try out. We loved it! Thanks!
490076,38381819,2015-07-15,21540227,Ramona,"Ann greeted us on arrival and gave us an informed tour of our cute, artsy space in Fremont. We loved staying here, it's really the perfect place to be while visiting Seattle. Quiet and comfy, and close to everything we wanted to experience on this trip.
We will be back, I'm sure of it!
"
490076,39366533,2015-07-23,26815770,Lauren,"Ann was a wonderful host! She made us feel welcome and comfortable from day 1! I was also impressed how accepting she was of our 3 year old. I would be happy to stay with Ann again, and/or highly recommend others to as well! My family and I loved Fremont! We got the chance to experience many of the beautiful parts of Seattle too! "
490076,40205804,2015-07-29,31622672,Carly,This was a cozy affordable place just outside the city.  There was a market less than a mile away and it was a quick 10 minute Lyft ride into the heart of downtown.  Our host was very welcoming and helpful. 
490076,42248752,2015-08-12,29158009,Sue,"We loved our 8-day stay at this wonderful Airbnb in Fremont (Seattle).  It truly is tucked away on a quiet street in the middle a great Seattle neighborhood.  Our host was there to greet us, even after our flight was delayed 6 hours and had wine and Theo's chocolate (YUM) for us on the kitchen table.  She truly made us feel welcome and was very gracious when we asked to add our son, who surprised us by flying in from Asia.  The space is rated for 3 people and accommodated that number very nicely.  The living room is comfortable and nicely decorated.  The kitchen is spacious and had all the necessary pots, pans and utensils I needed to fix several meals for a large group.  My husband really enjoyed the coffee she stocks and the quality of it with her French press.  I liked the huge bath towels and that there were plenty of extra kitchen and bath towels.   And we both agree that the bed is super comfortable.  This location was perfect for us as it was only a fe blocks from family and we could walk to their house as well as down to all of Fremont.  It is a gem of a location and gave us room to spread out a bit during our week plus stay. An added bonus are the beautiful gardens behind the house where we could sit and enjoy our morning coffee and tea or an afternoon glass of wine.  "
490076,43211887,2015-08-18,27988064,Michelle,"This was my first AirBNB experience and it couldn't have gone any smoother.  First, Ann was a fabulous communicator.  At no point did I feel like I had unanswered questions.  She was extremely flexible (even with my late check-in to actually arriving earlier than expected).  

Our gracious host greeted us upon arrival and quickly showed us the apartment.  She had a nice bottle of local wine and chocolate for arrival.  The apartment looked and was described accurately.  The location is top notch.  Just a quick walk and you are in town.  Personally, the apartment was located a half block away from my daughter that we were visiting.  So I will definitely be returning.

Now, most importantly.  Ann was not intrusive.  She communicated with us when needed, but gave us complete privacy.  Secondly, everything that is important in a room exceeded my expectations.  1.) The room was clean!!  2.) The bed is BEYOND comfortable. 3.) The shower is hot with excellent pressure!!  

There is nothing I would change about my stay. The apartment is situated in a nestled quiet area.  Thank you Ann for your hospitality and opening your home to us!!

Michelle Bare"
490076,46260553,2015-09-09,11136739,Bob,Ann kept in touch with us and made us feel comfortable and welcome.  She took her time showing the apartment.   She also had brochures and books on the Fremont Seattle area.   We were there for 2 weeks and she made her laundry available to us.
490076,46509879,2015-09-11,10648764,Oren,"My wife and I spent two nights in Ann's ground floor apartment and would highly recommend it. Ann guided us in like an airport control tower when our GPS couldn't pinpoint the house and made us feel very welcome.  

The apartment is spacious and well-appointed with everything one needs plus wine and chocolate!  The living room with giant TV is a bonus, the kitchen is perfect for two and the bedroom small but stays uncrowded because of the large walk-in closet. The bathroom is tight, but well equipped. 

Ann was quickly available when we needed something and quietly unobtrusive otherwise.  We found her the perfect host, and suspect most others would as well.  

My only criticism would be that the listing pictures make the apartment look light and airy, but we would describe it differently.  We found it a pleasant and informal mix of 1920's construction quirks mixed with modern updates.  It was funky and nice, but not as bright as we expected from the pictures.  

All-in-all a great spot for walking the Fremont district or accessing all of greater Seattle!"
490076,46718024,2015-09-13,16493510,Stephanie,"Ann was very welcoming and communicative. Even though we were delayed and late, she was there to open the home for us and make sure we were taken care of.  The home is comfortable and bright with a beautiful garden in back.  We had a great stay.  "
490076,48170905,2015-09-24,35824469,Rebecca,"When my husband, daughter and I arrived at Ann's place it was what we expected. Clean, private, unique. Our stay was 5 nights. We were very comfortable.  I was woken twice in the middle of the night by heavy footsteps above us but that would not stop us from returning! Ann is a great host."
490076,48689792,2015-09-28,37227977,Ryan,"Perfect location, both for exploring downtown and getting anywhere N of downtown without having to deal with traffic.  Its within walking distance of everything in Freemont and one of my favorite Seattle locations--Gas Works Park.  Of course the off street parking makes it even easier to get around if you have a car. The unit was lovely with lots of space in living room, full kitchen and bedroom.   The welcome bottle of wine and dark chocolate were a great bonus.  Ann was a perfect host and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again on future trips to Seattle"
490076,49223594,2015-10-02,3131097,Craig,Wonderful space in a great location. Ann was a fantastic host. She was very attentive but not overbearing. We had plenty of privacy but any questions we had were answered quickly. We loved sitting out in the garden and the easy walk down to Fremont's main strip. Highly recommend this space to explore Seattle!
490076,50175655,2015-10-10,35553954,Jenny,"I really enjoyed staying with Ann. My family flew in from PA to see beautiful Seattle and Fremont was the perfect place to stay. The area was awesome and I will definitely stay there again. Ann supplied us with a bottle of wine and chocolate to welcome us to her humble abode. It was a very cute one bedroom apartment attached to Ann's home with a full kitchen and a high quality air bed alongside the full bed, she also has a regular air mattress for additional guests. She also had umbrellas there for us for when it rained, which was very convenient since we forgot ours. Overall, I enjoyed my stay at Ann's home and I would definitely recommend it to others! "
490076,51120358,2015-10-18,2438160,Matthew & Martha,"Ann's house is comfortable and most important to me are a great functional kitchen and located very close to Fremont's core.  Ann is a very kind, helpful and communicative host.  I'll definitely look to stay there again on another trip out."
490076,52229250,2015-10-27,7156886,Corey,"Perfect, unique location in a great neighborhood. Very cozy and comfortable. Very reasonably priced. We loved it. "
490076,52718090,2015-11-01,31538061,Corina,"Cozy and had everything I needed. Perfect for one or a couple. Ann is a very kind host. The steel drive may be a bit tricky to navigate at first, but is fine once you get the hang of navigating it. "
490076,53953764,2015-11-15,38603495,Laurel,"We had a great stay in Fremont! The place is large and accommodating, equipped with everything you could need. The wine and chocolate welcome gift is a fantastic addition and the place is clean and cozy. 
We had some GOOD meals nearby, just down the hill on 36th. Revel is amazing  for Korean fusion, but if the wait is too long, just head over to Quoin!  Same menu and such great staff. Also highly recommend Pomerol for French style food and a lovely atmosphere. The grilled octopus is incredible!!"
490076,54283064,2015-11-17,24598206,Sue,"We enjoyed our stay in this ground floor flat, which is in a great location - an easy walk to shops and cafes and parks. The weather was very cold and wet, so we didn't have a chance to appreciate the garden....but it looked lovely. Ann was very helpful and flexible about our arrival time, which was appreciated. The queen bed was very comfortable, and there was an air bed available....but this made the space rather cramped, so I think this apartment probably works best for a couple. We had some challenges with the power, which were probably weather related. It was very helpful to have parking and wifi included."
490076,54983137,2015-11-27,44534741,Susan,"Ann is a very pleasant and welcoming host: she provided wine, corkscrew, chocolate, flowers, home-baked brownies and artisan soap! The apartment was immaculate and, as promised, the bed was excellent.  The apartment is comfortable, pleasantly appointed and well-sized. The neighborhood is very quiet and conveniently located. All of this added up to a wonderful Thanksgiving weekend. "
490076,55656970,2015-12-04,19477180,Justin,"I stayed here with a friend for a week. The location was great, tucked away and secluded but with a great view from the backyard. 
Ann was very accommodating and provided everything we needed. The place was clean, comfortable, warm and had the right amount of charm.

Coming to Seattle is always a pleasure but this made it even better.
Ann is a great host and kept in contact assuring us if there was anything we needed, she would take care of it. My buddy and I enjoyed it here and would definitely come back!!
Thank you again Ann for a great place and pleasant experience!!!!
Best
Justin "
490076,55802023,2015-12-06,26432986,Morgan,"We had such an amazing stay!  The bed is so incredibly comfortable and the apt is tucked up in the hills of the Fremont area making you feel so far yet so close to downtown Seattle.  Ann is also such a gracious host, giving us a bottle of wine on arrival and she also came and supported us at the craft fair we were in town working at.  Highly recommended!  Also having a cozy living room with Netflix to come home to was a nice touch as well.  :)"
490076,56139799,2015-12-09,1583192,Sarah,"Ann's apartment was great!  Fremont is such a cool neighborhood and  the apartment is tucked away, so you don't feel like you are in a city.  The garden looks amazing.  Unfortunately it was pouring the whole time, so we never got to enjoy it.  Ann is a fantastic host.  She was there to meet us when we checked in.  We mentioned that we just got engaged, and she left us wine, chocolate, croissants, mistletoe, and a lovely engagement card to help us celebrate.  It was incredibly sweet.  If you want to stay in the best part of town, in a comfortable home, with an amazing host, this is the place!"
490076,56259373,2015-12-11,44195665,Hilmar,"Ann was a great host, responsive and welcoming. Love the attention to detail, place setting at table, local coffee, excellent tea...Rental was everything as shown, bed was wonderful, apt quiet and comfortable. Great view out back. Will make sure to visit again in warmer weather to check out gardens and patio. "
490076,57060428,2015-12-21,6651113,Sarah,"We had a great stay at Ann's apartment - the location was great, Ann was very hospitable and helpful, and the apartment had everything we needed. Thanks for a wonderful stay, Ann!"
490076,57522827,2015-12-27,14595514,Christina,"Ann's place in Fremont is ideal for exploring Fremont and Ballard. Ann is extremely involved, follows up often and is very thorough with house rules. Please note that this place might not be for everyone as lights out were from 10 pm to 10 am. Also, the place is located underneath hers so there will be plenty of opportunities for communication with Ann."
3394936,18795092,2014-09-01,15150485,Jason,Great location next to the convention center. Walking to anything in Capitol Hill or Downtown was super convenient. The apartment was very comfortable and well equipped.
3394936,20208924,2014-09-25,2276851,Reena,"We had a wonderful stay at Rebecca's place. The best thing about it is the location. It is located just North of the hustle and bustle of Pike's market.  It is a 5-15 minute walk from all fun things - shopping, restaurants, nightlife, Pike's market, the monorail (5 mins away) to take to Chihuly/Space Needle, the largest public library in the world (10 minutes), the Duck Tour, and the Underground Tour (20 minutes).

As far as the place goes - it is a cozy place that has everything you need to enjoy a comfortable stay - lots of blankets and pillows. Has all the kitchen basics that you could think of. The furniture and the flooring are a bit dated and could use an update but everything is fully functional and in clean condition.

We had a great stay - thank you Rebecca and Doug!"
3394936,25202454,2015-01-09,13490812,Tina,"We had a wonderful time in Seattle Suites. We were greeted promptly by Doug, even though our flight was late. He showed us everything we needed to know about the apartment and even let us know some good places to explore in the neighborhood. The apartment was clean and comfortable, with a wonderful view. If it hadn't been cloudy everyday I bet it would have been even better, but hey, that is Seattle.

We were in town for a meeting at the convention center and you couldn't be any closer. We walked through the park into the back of the convention center and were in the main exhibit hall in 5 minutes."
3394936,26520101,2015-02-15,8515755,Mirna,"Awesome! Rebecca and Doug were both super helpful and responsive. The apartment is clean, nicely located at the heart of downtown. Walking distance to lots of shops, restaurants and bars. Also very close to the freeway so downtown traffic is not a big deal at all to get out of there. The view from the apartment is really cool. One of the best airbnb we ever tried. Thank you for the pleasant stay :-)"
3394936,33655674,2015-05-31,14545007,Daniel,"Everything was OK! We felt like home, and the location is excellent! 5 stars!"
3394936,35772698,2015-06-22,28555864,Andy,"Great location to explore all that Seattle has to offer!  Very quiet building for being quite close to the highway.  Doug greeted us at the door, helped us with our bags and gave great local insights.  A great guy!"
3394936,36278453,2015-06-27,32057996,Justin,"Rebecca and Doug were very nice and easily accessible for any needs. I arrived early and Doug was able to come right over and meet us. Fantastic. The appt is small and nice. Everything you need is there. I searched for accommodations for 4 people (2 parents, 1 adult daughter, 1 mostly adult son). This property is a bit too cozy for that many people. For one couple, fantastic. One couple and one other person who can sleep on a sleeper-sofa, awesome. But by the time the sleeper sofa was open, we had one of the kids sleeping practically on the kitchen floor.  If you meet the ideal group size, this is a perfect little appt to stay. 

Location location location. It does not get better than this. We did not get in our car once after we parked it the fist day. Convention?  You are literally right across the street from the center.  Here to see downtown attractions?  You are downtown. Restaurants?  Go up the hill on pike street and take your pick.  

Tips: 
1. Small. Don't go thinking you can cram extra people in here. 
2. Parking is an extra cost above what you paid through airbnb. It is reasonable and safe. 
3. If you do drive it is super easy to find and get to.  "
3394936,55345058,2015-12-01,35224842,Baz,This place is amazing and central. What you see is what you get. Doug looked after me during my two month stay. He gave me tips on where to shop for food and to get local services. And anytime I needed him to sort something out in the apartment he was there in minutes. It is the best place to be in Seattle if you are visiting for a short time.
3386862,16874541,2014-08-03,3807648,Danielle,"Claire was a great host! She was very flexible and accommodating! We needed very random things during our stay and she was able to provide us with the items we needed when we asked! Her place is convenient  and very close to popular bars, shops, and restaurants~ I would definitely come back again for a stay next time I'm in Seattle!"
3386862,17473361,2014-08-12,10955341,Sommer,"claire's apartment was perfect for us.  we were in seattle with our 22 month old daughter and needed a one bedroom with a kitchen (anyone with kids knows that you can't function in the same room when the littles are sleeping, you need a separate room for them to nap/sleep so you can do your own thing), which in hotel terms is very expensive.  

PROS:
-location location location.  spend more on being in the heart of things, especially if you have kids that nap.  you won't waste time traveling.  plus this apartment is a 10min walk to volunteer park, which has a great splash pool + playground. public transportation (the bus stops in front of the apartment), cafes, restaurants, ice cream, grocery store, yoga, pilates... it's all right there.
-fully functioning kitchen with dish soap, dish rags, ice cubes, coffee maker, etc.
-fast wifi.
-uncluttered apartment.
-apartment gets great light, has nice views of plants/trees, and with open windows you get a crosswind.
-1 bedroom (which means you have a separate space from the sleeping quarters).
-includes shampoo, body wash, towels.  the little things make a huge difference.
-easy check in/out.  claire was accommodating and met us to give us the key, when checking out we just left the key in the apartment.
-claire is so sweet.  i don't expect her to do this with everyone, but she refunded us a night (we had airline problems and didn't arrive until the next day), and had coffee stocked in the apartment.  she was so smiley when we met, she's the kind of person you'd want to be friends with.

CONS:
-could be cleaner (this is actually not a con for us, but i could see others being bothered).  dust mites in the corners.
-the shower head is like a garden hose. totally not a deal breaker for us, but again, for others i could see this as annoying.
-the building is older, so sound travels.  we travel with a sound machine app so it was not a problem but without the white noise to block it out, it could be a little loud with neighbors and traffic.

things to keep in mind:
-no tv. we don't watch tv and travel with our iPad so this didn't bother us at all, others might miss it.
-no laundry on site. something to keep in mind. claire did generously offer laundry services but we didn't need it.
-if you are traveling with kids, keep in mind that there is only one queen bed. the bedroom is not large, but it could fit an air mattress on the floor for your littles if need be.

honestly i have to stretch for the cons, as for us personally they were non issues.  we had a lovely stay and would stay here again without a blink.  thank you claire!
"
3386862,18079058,2014-08-21,2523484,Caterina,Claire has a charming apartment and she is a lovely host. Would highly recommend! 
3386862,18431957,2014-08-26,4873790,Scott,"Claire was a great host -- very easy to communicate with and accommodating. The apartment was just what we were looking for -- A spacious one bedroom, centrally located. It was a great place from which to enjoy Seattle!"
3386862,19275779,2014-09-09,174378,Milena,"Claire was super communicative and welcoming and waited for us at the house. She explained how stuff in the house works and gave us some great recommendations for nightlife. The house is absolutely perfectly located and we were able to walk to coffee shops, bars and restaurants in Capitol Hill. We would definitely stay there again!"
3386862,19708453,2014-09-16,16210215,Phil,"This 1 bedroom is in an older building in a great location of Capitol Hill. Coffee is a quick walk away. A few more blocks and you are in the heart of a vibrant area. With the age comes beautiful windows, hardwood floors and unique design features. There are also loud doors and floors but the neighbors seemed to be relatively quiet and respectful.

Be aware that if staying on a busy weekend you might have difficulty finding parking. 

Also, as others have noted, the showerhead will pound your face like Niagara Falls.

I really enjoyed my stay here. Claire was clear with instructions and was nearby if we needed anything. I appreciated her attentiveness and post-it notes."
3386862,19859271,2014-09-19,21385186,Ann,"Claire was very helpful and prompt in responding to our request. When we arrived, she was extremely welcoming and friendly! She made herself available in case of any emergency (but that wasn't necessary because everything went smoothly!) The neighborhood was very close to many eateries and grocery stories. The listing says that there is ample parking but it's extremely to hard to find parking because the entire neighborhood also parks on the streets."
3386862,19885129,2014-09-20,20127332,Damien,"Claire was a very friendly and welcoming host. Her apartment is very well located in Capitol Hill. The place was very clean with minimal furnishing, bed was very comfortable and wifi worked without trouble. Highly recommended. "
3386862,20025805,2014-09-22,7988447,Humberto,"The apartment is in a great location—plenty of hip bars and restaurants to check out within a few minutes. It also offered everything we needed and was an accurate reflection of the pictures and description online. Claire was fantastic with responding to texts and emails. The whole process was very smooth. All in all, we had a wonderful time in Seattle!"
3386862,20097022,2014-09-23,10397165,Emily,"Claire was a delight! She is super sweet and responds quickly. Her apartment is spacious, very clean, quiet and in a great little area of town. It's walking distance to coffee shops, restaurants, bars, etc. The wifi works great too! She even recommended a few places in town for us to drink delicious beer and get some food. The parking is street parking but we didn't have any trouble finding a nearby spot on a Sunday night. Check in and check out was a breeze. I'd definitely recommend Claire as a host! Thanks again! "
3386862,20918598,2014-10-07,6067496,Bella,"The three of us had a great stay at Claire's apartment. Claire responded quickly to any questions, and she recommended some great restaurants to check out. The neighborhood, Capitol Hill, was absolutely perfect, and a lot of the best places to eat (and drink coffee!) were located within a 10 minute walk. It also felt very safe, and was very quiet. There's a bus (#49) which is a 3 minute walk from the apartment that goes straight to downtown, too.
The apartment itself was very comfortable. It was clean, with lots of light and room. There is one bedroom, so if there are three of you, there's a couch to sleep on (you have to bring your own bedding though). We didn't use the kitchen to cook, but all the usual amenities were provided. There isn't a tv, but that wasn't an issue for us, and the wi-fi worked great.
All in all, Claire's apartment is the best place to explore Seattle from, and I'd highly recommend staying here! "
3386862,21011393,2014-10-09,3037417,Chester,"Claire and her place helped us to have an amazing time in Seattle. It's located in a charming, safe, and fun neighborhood with plenty to explore and do with walking distance, and a short taxi to downtown and other land marks. The apartment had all the essentials and was very comfortable. Claire provided great tips about her favorite places and activities nearby, and always responded quickly whenever we contacted her. We will be back to Seattle and when do we hope to stay here again."
3386862,21106751,2014-10-11,2000339,Jessa,"Claire was very nice, and the listing was accurate. "
3386862,21298478,2014-10-14,21369887,Emily,"Claire was very responsive to my emails and was able to push back my check-in time, when I was running late.
The unit was spacious and in a quiet neighborhood, only a few blocks from Volunteer Park, and some restaurant/coffee shop options.  The location was also good for going to downtown Seattle, as the #49 bus stop was only a few blocks away.
The bathroom was a little cramped, with no counter space, but easily managed with some planning.  
The unit is listed as being able to accomodate 3 people, one bedroom and a large couch.  Claire provided 3 sets of towels, but the couch sleeper should bring their own sheets, pillows and blankets, only linens for the bedroom are included.
Overall, this was a good value in a convenient location."
3386862,21558570,2014-10-19,22132253,Nicole,"Claire's place was in a fantastic location. It was super clean and tidy but you could still see her cool personal style in the home. Communication for me is key and Claire was very fast to respond to any questions. Thanks, it was perfect for what we needed. "
3386862,21671908,2014-10-21,21510508,John,Great place to rest your head after a long day of running around the city. Perfect location in the best neighborhood in Seattle. 
3386862,22118644,2014-10-30,7322080,Mike,"Clair was very easy to communicate with; we had to reschedule our arrival time and she was very accommodating and responsive.  The apartment is a full 1 bedroom, 1 bath, and is well laid out in a great neighborhood and was exactly as advertised.  It is just a tad spartan, but really had everything we needed."
3386862,22439129,2014-11-06,6697859,Drew,Claire was helpful and her place was lovely. I'll be back for sure.
3386862,22536041,2014-11-09,22042576,Jeffrey,"Claire was a responsive host and easy to communicate with. The apartment is clean and in a great location in Capitol Hill -- close to numerous coffee shops, restaurants, and Volunteer Park. "
3386862,22697459,2014-11-12,21406179,Jimmy,Claire welcomed us upon arrival gave a good overview of the place and there area. Located in the trendy area of capital hill. Close to everything in capital hill and a close ride to downtown Seattle. 
3386862,22861761,2014-11-16,747114,Bob,Claire was great at making arrangements for my arrival.  The apartment's location is hard to beat.  A block away from shops and restaurants and yet on the nicer end of Capitol HIll.
3386862,23387853,2014-11-30,8537693,Amber,"We enjoyed Claire's place. It was warm and exactly the refuge we needed on a cold, rainy day. Claire was very accommodating and even loaned us her umbrella. The location is great and there is a bus stop right across the street. Overall a great experience!"
3386862,23494199,2014-12-02,513879,Camilo,This apartment was well located and Claire was very nice and helpful.
3386862,23761043,2014-12-09,8712437,Adam,"Claire's listing was a great, charming and comfortable spot. It's conveniently located in Capitol Hill is a great walkable location lose to all that The Hill has to offer. Claire couldn't have been more helpful in coordinating our arrival or more accommodating as a host. Looking forward to staying there again in the future."
3386862,24061971,2014-12-18,312430,Nathan,Apartment was exactly as described in the posting. Claire was really easy to communicate with and very accommodating. Perfect location for exploring Capital hill and downtown 
3386862,24096814,2014-12-19,24899345,Bobby,Claire is an amazing host and the space is equally stellar!  Highly recommended. 
3386862,24159134,2014-12-21,6427739,Fazeela,"Great place, lovely neighbourhood, super host. My friends and I had a fantastic time staying here. Thanks Claire :)"
3386862,24437673,2014-12-28,23465939,Lindsey,"Claire was a superb host! Very understanding and sweet despite my late arrival (and my poor communication as I was coming from outside the country and didn't have immediately cell phone service). She made sure to even restock the paper towels at the apartment for me and left them on the back door so as not to disturb me. The place is great, maybe even more spacious and comfortable than I imagined.  Everything was more than adequate for my 6 day stay, and I'm sure anybody with shorter or longer stays will be pleased too. Note: The whole building is extremely quiet so squeaky doors and bed made me feel a little criminal moving about but I really enjoyed my stay, parking was not a problem, restaurants and other are walkable distance and I think Claire has pretty cool taste. "
3386862,24628741,2014-12-31,25265698,Lauren,"Claire's place is a perfect place to unwind from jet lag and long travels - it's very quiet and cozy, yet close to dining, cafes, and grocery. One of the few remaining authentic independent coffeehouses in Capitol Hill, Joe Bar, is located just one block away. Another plus is her flat is just a few blocks from Volunteer Park, one of Seattles best urban parks featuring the Seattle Asian Art Museum, a gorgeous glass conservatory, and some of the best trees. Next to the park is a graveyard where you can visit the burial of Bruce Lee.  The bed is very comfortable and the space is very tastefully and artfully done - minimal yet with character. Though we didn't meet Claire, she was very prompt with all communications, allowing for the overall experience to flow stress free. I'll definitely be booking this space in the future. Many thanks, Claire! "
3386862,24840221,2015-01-03,3914030,Sara,"- easy to communicate 
- very accommodating and thoughtful
- great location and great apartment"
3386862,25139845,2015-01-07,14877506,Lachlan,Location was absolutely perfect and just a short walk down the road to everything fun. Decent cafe on the corner. Place was comfortable and stylish without feeling cramped. 
3386862,25443571,2015-01-16,6562381,Kris,Clairemont was great! Easy to work with and she made my trip a joy. 
3386862,25657768,2015-01-22,6233512,Helen,"This apartment is cute, old-style & uncluttered. The location is lovely & convenient to many cool areas. I would recommend it highly for these attributes. However it is very basic - no microwave, toaster or kettle; no extra blankets, no place at all to unpack a suitcase. And we were caught by the 2-prong powerpoints (we had brought USA 3-prong) which was a problem for charging our many devices. "
3386862,25752617,2015-01-25,8121652,Tianna,Had such an awesome time! Such a great location and Claire was so easy to contact and get a hold of. If I'm ever back up in Seattle it's the one place I would be looking forward to staying :) 
3386862,26311537,2015-02-09,173226,Patricia,"Host:
Claire made it very easy to stay in her apartment. We arrived pretty late at night, and we were easily able to communicate with her on the day of arrival to figure out where to get the keys, etc. We never actually met face to face, but it was easy to communicate via text.

Apartment:
There are great post-its around the apartment to help answer FAQs. The apartment itself is larger than it looks in the photos. It was quite clean, although the building itself is a bit older, so not everything is sparkly clean. One downside is that the heating elements cannot be adjusted; instead you have to open and close the windows (which have no screens) to adjust the temperature. When we were there the heat was turned up pretty high, so if we didn't open the windows, it would've been way too hot. It worked okay for us, but something to note. We didn't end up using the kitchen, but it looked like the basics were there, although the space is quite small.

Amenities:
Wi-fi worked well. Be sure to bring your own shampoo and other toiletries etc. There is a coffee pot, but you'll have to provide your own coffee.

Location:
Great! A short 2-3 minute walk to the north end of Broadway in Capitol Hill. Lots of delicious restaurants, coffee shops and bars in the area. A slightly longer walk to 15th ave, which has more eateries."
3386862,26425520,2015-02-12,3906593,Justin,"Claire was an amazing host as she was very responsive to all my questions at any time of the day.  The location of the listing was already super convenient as it was really close to markets and coffee shops.  However, the heater was turned on a bit too high for my liking (caused the air to feel dry and stuffy) and we had to regulate temperature by opening windows.  I'm sure Claire probably would have fixed it for me had I asked, but I didn't want to bother her.  The walls and ceilings were also kind of thin so we could hear people coming through the front door of the complex but I was able to sleep through it.  Definitely understand that this is an older apartment before going into it and you should be fine.  "
3386862,26601648,2015-02-16,14286304,Jonathan,"Claire was super accommodating and extremely easy to get a hold of. From the moment we arrived to when we left, she was always available to help us out whenever needed. Getting in contact with her was no problem. The place itself was perfect, very cozy and very quiet. Couldn't have slept better. The area, right in Capitol Hill, was awesome - lots of great and lively places for nightlife and tons of good food. We rented a car, and street parking was no problem at all. I would definitely stay again when I come back to Seattle. Thanks a bunch again, Claire!!!"
3386862,26757219,2015-02-18,11149243,Katherine,Great space for a great price. Claire was super easy to work with. Fantastic location!
3386862,27018172,2015-02-23,27532687,Kevin,"Claire was a wonderful host for 3 days. She was extremely patient with my newness to the whole AirBnB process. She went through the trouble of buying an ironing board for the apartment just because I said I had an interview. The place itself was great. A block away from my favorite coffee shop, about half a mile from some of the more mild bars in Cap Hill and probably about a mile to the main scene.

Everything came as advertised. The living room was great to hang out in or do a little bit of work. Claire also kept the place nice and warm as it was mid winter (although a very mild winter). I plan on coming back to Seattle in about two months and will definitely look to stay here again."
3386862,27227785,2015-02-28,27643209,James,Claire was cool. The place is in a very good walking area. Couch and bed where comfortable. Plenty of street parking.
3386862,27851280,2015-03-13,6312364,Dallas,"I didn't get a chance to actually meet Claire in person, but everything about my stay was great. Claire was very flexible regarding my booking and very helpful in making sure I had everything I need. The space itself was great, and the location is amazing - very conveniently located and in a beautiful neighbourhood. I would definitely stay here again."
3386862,28176951,2015-03-19,22187076,David,"Great little apartment in a great location. Has all the basics for a short stay in Seattle. Although we didn't meet Claire, she was easy to stay in contact with, and promptly replied. Claire also left us a fresh bag of local coffee, which was a nice touch. "
3386862,28880957,2015-03-31,12461061,Julie,"This space was perfect for us! Easy to find, although parking was a little bit of a challenge at times. It's a minimalist type space, so if you're looking for bells and whistles this isn't the place for you (although you'll certainly have everything you need). It was perfect for us as we are more interested in exploring the city than the extra amenities.  Claire was very welcoming and gave us a thorough walkthrough of the apartment. She was very reachable and easy to communicate with the whole trip.  

We had access to a full kitchen which was nice, although we didn't end up making anything but sandwiches due to the wonderful restaurant options around! The bed is very comfortable, although it is on wheels which we were not expecting, so it slides around a bit when you sit down. There is excellent Wi-Fi, and a large flat screen TV in the living room. We brought our laptop and cables and were easily able to hook up our computer to watch Netflix on our downtime.

The neighborhood is absolutely beautiful, with lots of trees and flowers everywhere. It is very walkable and has kind of a small town feel. Everyone we met was extremely friendly and kind. It's a short walk to restaurants, a couple of bars, and the biggest grocery store I've ever been in. It's also a short drive to pretty much anywhere in Seattle. It's very centrally located and is perfect for getting around the whole city.

I would definitely recommend this space!"
3386862,29144832,2015-04-04,20874111,Cecilia,"A lovely one night stay, apartment as advertised. Great location. Claire was super helpful in her contact and left notes with instructions around the apartment where needed, the finishing touch was a couple of cold beers appreciatively left for us in the fridge. A great start to our Seattle stay. "
3386862,29756901,2015-04-12,29181997,Kaitlin,"We had such a great stay. The place was nice, Claire brought us toilet paper and paper towels part way through our stay when they were running low. There was some unexpected maintenance on the building while we were there, but Claire communicated with us best she could and even left us an apology present! We couldn't have been in a more perfect location."
3386862,30003851,2015-04-15,16745765,Ewa,"We had a very relaxing night at Claire's lovely place - it looked just like  the pictures, was very clean, warm and spacious and in a safe and great neighborhood. Claire was very helpful and accommodating and easy to communicate with. I will be happy to stay at her place again next time I am in Seattle."
3386862,30208860,2015-04-19,27715143,Maria Delia,"Perfect little Apartment, Perfect location & Perfect host.  Had the loveliest time.   Thank you Claire!  "
3386862,30869156,2015-04-28,4827400,Lionel,"We had a great time at the apartment! An old charming apartment with everything we needed. Great location, within walking distance to all the great places to eat and drink! I loved the neighborhood! We had a car and was worried there might not be any parking spots but we were able to street park all nights we were there within a 2 min walking distance. The place was very clean and Claire was very helpful with everything!!! Thank you Claire! And come visit when you are in Hawaii :)
Brenda & Lionel "
3386862,31802010,2015-05-10,30785312,Agile,"It was a very positive experience - clean and spacious apartment, with a very accommodating host. It's also in a great location, walking distance from Volunteer Park with easy access to Downtown. "
3386862,33714144,2015-05-31,2708364,Jason,"Claire was very helpful and welcoming and then completely discreet and left us to enjoy the place in complete privacy. The neighborhood is very nice, north end of Capitol Hill so it's an easy walk to everything but the street itself is quiet and just outside of all the madness. Parking was ok; one night I did have to park in a ""four hour"" zone but I never got a ticket (not to say that's a general rule - I have no idea). The apartment is comfortable and well decorated. The kitchen has all the basics including a french press (though a sauté pan is missing).  Overall a very positive experience. "
3386862,34139293,2015-06-05,11908713,Audrey,"Although I didn't meet Claire in person, she seemed very nice and accommodating. The apartment was in a great location and was exactly as described. I would definitely stay with Claire again if I were ever in the Seattle area."
3386862,34541887,2015-06-09,31606807,Dee,The location was great. Walking distance to some great restaurants and bars. Witness was a excellent restaurant with great service. Also going downtown or to Pike and Pine street was a $10-$15 Lyft ride. There is no microwave so just keep that in mind if you bring back food to eat later. Although I never met Claire she was quick to reply when I contacted her for any questions and issues that I had. 
3386862,35217386,2015-06-16,10215876,Laura,"Claire was a great host; she helped me to feel at home immediately. Her apartment was clean and comfortable, wIth everything I needed! "
3386862,35557878,2015-06-20,31435909,Alexandra,"I don't think we could say enough about this space to really capture how lucky we got! This was THE perfect location. My husband and I spent 5 days here and were able to walk everywhere. I think the only day we used our car was when we drove to Canada for the day. There is an incredible selection of restaurants, bars, shopping, people watching, late night sidewalk cafes, and an incredible grocery store, all within a 2 block walk from the apartment. Not to mention the adorable street it's located on (little neighborhood bookstore, tiny cinema, and two different coffee houses). We walked to Pike's Place in about 20 minutes, and it only took about 15 to get to Volunteer park, the Arboretum, and the Lakeview Cemetery (you know, where Bruce and Brandon Lee are buried). The space was clean, large, and has all the necessary amenities -- even an iron & ironing board!
"
3386862,35928912,2015-06-23,9174551,David,"The apartment itself was great - a TV that I could hook up to my MacBook, clean kitchen/bathroom with well-stocked supplies and amenities, close to many different bus lines, and an extremely comfortable bed that was perfect after a full day of walking.

Aside from that, Claire was what made this stay awesome.  She went out of her way to make sure we had a smooth check-in/check-out, and made herself available throughout the trip for any questions or problems we might have had.  I'd book again in a heartbeat!"
3386862,36399749,2015-06-28,17788173,Sheena,"Loved Claire's place and had a fantastic stay. The location in Capitol Hill area was perfect, right next to amazing restaurants and bars. Could easily get the bus or walk into downtown area. The flat was clean and spacious, just as it shows in the pictures, and had amazingly fast WiFi! Claire was really helpful with personal suggestions/recommendations in the area and made check in / out really hassle free. Thanks for a great time in Seattle!"
3386862,37854391,2015-07-11,32462105,Jemima,"Awesome place to stay; clean and quiet. Claire was welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed. Great location as well, many restaurants and bars nearby. Downtown is also really close (10 min by bus or 20 min by foot). Would definitely book with her again!"
3386862,38181049,2015-07-13,36469172,Marissa,The neighborhood was great and the apartment was a perfect resting spot during our Seattle adventures. 
3386862,39048865,2015-07-20,36166684,Patrick,"Claire's place in Capitol Hill was perfect. Walking distance from some great restaurants and the bar scene Capitol Hill is known for. Claire was great with communication while checking in, and made sure we had everything we needed for the duration of our stay. Kitchen and bathroom were clean and couldn't ask for a more well prepared place. We had a minor issue with the front door lock being stubborn, but Claire was prompt to get us a new set of keys which solved everything! I'll definitely look up Claire again if I plan on staying in Capitol Hill again."
3386862,40121428,2015-07-28,36541051,Jane,"Claire was a wonderful host! She communicated with me promptly and in such a friendly manner that I felt welcomed even before our trip began. The space itself is lovely; it's in such a vibrant and convenient location. It's kept spotlessly clean, it's airy, with lots of natural light, and has everything you need for both a short-term and long-term stay. Between Claire and the apartment, we didn't want to leave. I would definitely stay at this property again! Thank you, Claire!
"
3386862,40480929,2015-07-31,1150797,Morgan,"Claire was a very accommodating host, allowing us to check our bags in earlier than the check in time, head out for the day and then come back once the room was ready. She was available via text for the length of our stay.

The apartment is in a beautiful tree lined street area within the very trendy Capitol Hill. The apartment is basic but fulfils the needs of a short stay. There is a bus stop near by which takes you downtown however the half hour walk was our choice of transport for our stay!

Arriving from the airport is simple: a $3 light rail takes you downtown and then its a quick $12 cab ride to Capitol Hill.
"
3386862,41124136,2015-08-04,37988452,Bryan,Claire called and welcomed us to her place. 
3386862,41645847,2015-08-08,21569393,Cecilia,"Although I did not meet Claire we talked over the phone and she walked me through the checking in process. She was very pleasant and her apartment was exactly as advertised. The apartment is a bit on the older side but perfectly sized. We didn't stay in the apt much since we wanted to explore the city, but would be nice to have a DVD player to watch a movie if you wanted to stay in. The neighborhood is awesome perfect for public transit (there's a bus stop about 1 block from apt.) that will take you downtown/pikes place. There are lots of bars, restaurants, coffee, etc. Had a great time exploring the city!"
3386862,41997685,2015-08-10,19309235,Paula,Claire was very accommodating and communicative the entire weekend. She made it easy to get into her place and although it wasn't walking distance to the main area of Capitol Hill it was in a cute neighborhood and very peaceful. 
3386862,42560131,2015-08-14,12519921,Dan,"Claire was very accommodating with our arrival and was quick to communicate anything we needed. She sent out some great recommendations prior to our arrival as well. 

The place is a nice size and is in a perfect area for a Seattle stay. You can easily walk anywhere you need, even the ball park if you are the waking sort. I would suggest looking into who is performing at the Paramount Theatre as your stay approaches.

The place was clean and was easy to find. As some other guests mentioned, it is a bit dated, so just be aware that certain features are not as modern as some may be used to. 

We eventually found that the street to the South west? (on Broadway behind the apartment) had free all day parking. I would suggest just parking there and leaving it for the stay, unless you're visiting the outlet malls which are a 45 min drive north, which if you're coming from Van, I would recommend visiting on your way down. 

Overall it was a great stay. The price for the location cannot be beat. "
3386862,43389732,2015-08-19,6135759,Amanda,"Claire's apartment is great! We loved it. Great location in Capitol Hill, near shops, restaurants and transportation. Claire is easy to communicate with and friendly!!Wish we could have stayed longer!"
3386862,43647495,2015-08-21,36057597,Qing,An old charming apartment. Perfect location. The neighbourhood is absolutely beautiful. Claire is very nice host.
3386862,44550124,2015-08-27,38675713,Ashley,"Claire was a very nice and accommodating host. The place was in a very convenient and beautiful spot in Capitol Hill- walking distance to some great restaurants, coffee shops and bars. The nightlife was not too hoppin (during the week at least) in the area, but there were several bus stops nearby to be able to explore different parts of the city. The place was very clean, comfy, and spacious. I would definitely recommend this spot!"
3386862,44746162,2015-08-28,31786182,Nelle,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3386862,45106235,2015-08-31,15563676,Savannah,"It was our first time visiting the city and we chose Claire's place because it was economical and in a good location! Our stay started out with a small set-back since the key broke off in the lock and had to be re-keyed the day we were coming in. Claire was very helpful in getting the situation taken care of and keeping us up to date during the re-keying process! The apartment has all the basics and is in a great location. Its a quiet, safe, and walkable neighborhood. We especially enjoyed walking to all the shops and restaurants around. Overall, it was a good spot for a few nights in the city! "
3386862,45696033,2015-09-05,10623040,Natalie,The apartment was clean and the photos shown were accurate.  We loved the location.  The bed was very comfortable.  
3386862,46931570,2015-09-14,41861539,Andrew,Excellent location if you enjoy the hip vibe of urban living. One block walk to great bars and restaurants and easy access to public transportation that make the whole city a short ride away.
3386862,47174596,2015-09-16,8856828,Jennifer,"Claire made everything easy and was very welcoming. Her apt was immaculate, and the location is great. Easy walking to great coffee, buses to downtown, the heart of Capitol Hill, etc."
3386862,47737859,2015-09-21,3338653,Rizwan,"The apartment was really nice and cozy. Enjoyed the stay there, everything was well explained and convenient. Thanks!"
3386862,48199617,2015-09-24,23274836,Kelsey,"Claire was extremely helpful and clarified any questions that we sent her. She was also really thoughtful - she left an umbrella for us to use just in case! The space itself is spacious indeed and a major plus is that Claire has a water filter in the fridge (not that we used it though because we had already bought water ahead of time). The bed is also comfy!

A close spot to major bus stops that take you to downtown, Pike's Place, International District, and Pioneer Square! It's also right around the corner from a street with lots of late night eateries and coffee shops. "
3386862,48415267,2015-09-26,40328272,Chris,"This place is great! Everything was clean, the bed was comfy, and the shower was hot. It's within walking distance of tons of bars, restaurants, and coffee shops, and it was very easy to get downtown. It felt like a home away from home - a great way to test drive city living in Seattle!"
3386862,48720090,2015-09-28,3946777,Matthew,"My stay at Claire's was a great way to experience Seattle and Capitol Hill. Her place was very cozy and comfortable. She was easy to communicate with and the entire process was streamlined. The location is perfect for anyone looking to checkout the downtown area or Capitol Hill. Great places to eat within walking distance, and very fun nightlife. My only difficulty during my stay was the parking, since I rented a car. If there was no parking on Broadway St. the other parking was 4 hour parking only. Other than that I would recommend Claire's place to everyone. "
1978743,10472190,2014-02-20,12163866,Katie,"Melissa and Abil's home is inviting, lovingly maintained, and was the perfect place to stay on our 5 day trip.  They put a lot of care into making sure their guests are comfortable and happy.  I was traveling with my partner, who is vegan, and Melissa researched and made a different vegan baked good for our breakfast every morning along with plates of fresh fruit, which were laid out when we came downstairs.  She also packed our breakfast for our very early return flight.  They were very helpful with suggesting transportation routes, things to do, and places to eat.  We are considering a move to Seattle and Melissa answered all of our questions and had a lot of great insight about the city she so clearly loves.  Their home is centrally located and a good home base for exploring many different parts of the city.  I would highly recommend their place to anyone and will definitely stay there again on future trips.  Thanks for everything!"
1978743,10704978,2014-03-03,12547386,Christopher,"Melissa and Abil are excellent hosts! You will not be disappointed with the level of comfort, privacy and price. Beats a hotel in Seattle any day. Plus, Melissa bakes continental breakfasts. Put in a request for her banana nut muffins. Thanks guys!"
1978743,11213183,2014-03-25,10745736,Henry,"We stayed in both the Garden room and the Cedar Tree room during our stay.  The Cedar room was so bright and open.  The couch, chair, and desk gave us a great private place to just sit and read or work.  The art on the walls was eclectic and wonderful.  I can't wait to stay in this room again.  

This place is so much better than a hotel.  Feels like a home, with great food and good people."
1978743,11354992,2014-03-31,2797450,Adam,"Melissa was amazing. I put my mother up here for a week while she was in town. Not only were the accomodations spectacular, Melissa happens to be an incredible chef. Daily my mother boasted of the delights that awaited her in the kitchen, and on my mother's birthday, Melissa was so kind as to bring her breakfast to her room! If you're looking for an amazing place to stay in Seattle, this is the place! "
1978743,11617982,2014-04-09,12775436,Kathryn,"My daughters and I stayed with Melissa and Abil to celebrate my daughter's 30th birthday.  It was our first stay at an Air BnB and we were more than thrilled with our experience.  Such gracious hosts, beautiful house and rooms.  They gave us just enough privacy mixed in with a blend of their expertise with suggestions of things to do, transportation, restaurants ect.  We wanted for nothing and loved our stay at their home. The breakfasts were delicious and just enough to start us off on our day exploring Seattle.   I highly recommend staying with them!"
1978743,12228999,2014-04-26,14565253,Veronique,"The place to stay in Seattle!!
J'ai passé un excellent séjour chez Abil et Melissa. La chambre est superbe, tout est décoré avec délicatesse et finesse, le moindre détail a son importance. Le lit est très confortable, idéal pour dormir profondément. La maison est un havre de paix en rentrant d'une longue journée de travail ou d'excursion. Et le petit déjeuner, que dire, des muffins aux myrtilles tout droit sorti du four, un vrai régal !!! Abil et Mélissa sont charmantes et super accueillantes, elles adorent leur ville et seront les meilleurs guide pour vous indiquer des balades, des restaurants, des shows… Et pour couronner le tout, vous êtes au coeur de la ville.
Bref, ne cherchez pas plus loin pour vous loger!"
1978743,13154017,2014-05-20,14815949,Burke,"My stay was very pleasant.  The room  provided all I needed and the bed was very comfy!  Melissa & her partner are great hosts.  The location is good if you need to be close to the central Seattle area, and public transportation stops are
close by.  I would definitely stay there again."
1978743,13423352,2014-05-27,1486150,Rachel,We had a great stay with Melissa and Abil! Their house was beautiful and every room had its own individual style. All the artwork was gorgeous and we really enjoyed seeing the different pieces. The breakfast was always great with different teas coffees and yummy baked goods! A must do is a beer tour with Abil and ask them about any cool events going on in Seattle when your there; they both have great knowledge and could suggest something new and interesting. All in all a great stay with an awesome couple and some really cute cats!
1978743,14038013,2014-06-10,15377348,Julie,"This is just home from home. No! Better. Melissa and ABil made us so welcome in their lovely home we felt like old friends. Beautiful clean room. Comfy bed. Delicious home made fresh muffins every morning, and really helpful for good addresses and how to get around. Wouldnot, could not go anywhere else."
1978743,16092658,2014-07-22,10696228,Syriah,"Brilliant first airbnb experience. I came to Seattle to spend time with a friend and work the following week. It was the perfect place to do both and within easy walking distance of Capitol Hill for all our restaurant, bar and shopping needs! Other local (10 minute walk) restaurants and bars were easily accessible and recommended highly by Abil.

The room itself was adorable - plenty of closet and drawer space for two. We had water in our room ready on arrival and a lovely tour from Melissa. Every morning, a beautiful breakfast of fruit, coffee/tea and baked goods were served. When I had work early (this was every morning for a week!!!) Melissa and Abil packed some fruit to take to work with cute notes that brightened my day. They even saved me a baked good every day for when I came home. I really appreciated the little touches and detail during my stay, especially the guest shelf loaded with beer and their outside picnic table when I got a chance to relax :)

Melissa, Abil and Jenna made every effort to make my friend and I welcome :) Melissa and Abil left for a weekend and Jenna made every effort to help me and other guests on their absence. My friend enjoyed the camp fire night! I hope to stay in Cedar Tree when I come back! "
1978743,16549308,2014-07-29,8501384,Martha,"Melissa and Abil could not have been more kind or accommodating. The house has been lovingly designed and decorated to make their guests comfortable and at home. The continental breakfasts were yummy! I truly felt like I was staying with friends. And the proximity to Pratt Art School, where I was taking a class, was perfect! I highly recommend their lovely home to anyone visiting the school. "
1978743,16890402,2014-08-04,5089719,Edith,"Melissa was a fantastic hostess!  My husband and I enjoyed the breakfast treats, including fresh fruit muffins.  Melissa was able to help direct us to great local spots like Chuck's, where you can get amazing beer and ice cream.

The house is in a pleasant neighborhood that is a bit more bohemian than other parts of the city. We managed to find the house via public transportation in the middle of the night, and while some of the people on the bus were a little strange, we never felt unsafe.  We ended up using the bus quite a few times, as well as Uber.  Melissa will provide you with a code that gives you a free Uber ride!

I would recommend our room, which was comfy and cozy.  Never had a problem getting to the bathroom down the hall.  All in all I would say it was a great place for us to stay on our short visit to Seattle."
1978743,17508342,2014-08-13,16654788,Lan,"the house is very nice,the host is very great！"
1978743,18000612,2014-08-20,16067342,Karen,"This was our first time using airbnb. We couldn't have been happier with the whole experience!  We spent a total of nine nights in Melissa and Abil's comfortable and beautifully decorated home. Melissa never served the same muffin or breakfast cake twice!  All delicious and from locally found sources, as in rhubarb and apples from backyard. The fruit plate was always artfully arranged and they happily satisfied my desire for decaf coffee each morning. It was always so interesting and such fun each morning to discover who else was staying in the house and to hear their stories. We experienced a very international representation of cool folks!  Great location too! We walked to four different independent coffee houses as well as to the International District and many city parks.  My husband enjoyed the Pike's Brewery beer provided by Abil in the fridge. We both enjoyed going on her tour at Pike's Brewery as well!  Both women and Jenna were very helpful with special requests, such as using the washer, dryer, and closeline and needing help with cable connections.  Both rooms were very clean and the beds were comfortable. I appreciated the white bed linens and towels. Even though the house was fairly full of guests when we stayed in the Cedar Tree room, there was never any issue with using the shared bathroom. I would definitely recommend these accommodations. The only negative thing I can think of is they did everything so well, we hated to leave!  "
1978743,19957933,2014-09-21,14550404,Derry,"We were warmly welcomed by the housekeeper, Jenna and by Melissa herself when she arrived a few minutes later. We found the room and ambiance very comfortable and having access to the entire house, including free beer in the fridge(!), was an unexpected bonus, as were the coffee, sliced fruit plates, and breakfast pastries created by Abil. Overall, it was more like a family gathering than a hotel experience. Highly recommended but suggest bringing a vehicle. Regular taxi service in Seattle is a bit of a gong show at the moment, apparently due to fierce competition from the Uber online service."
1978743,20448075,2014-09-29,20566632,Dagmar,"We had a great experience with Melissa and Abil, they are very communicative and friendly, helped us a lot with  exploring the city.
Especially the breakfasts we will remember, as Melissa baked every day a special treat for us. 
The room had all we expected, we could use the kitchen if we wanted to.
And we could do our laundry, which was great.
There is a lot of information laid out for guests and we got even two orca-cards for the bus, which we could use to travel arround in Seattle.
The house is in a nice area of Seattle, we liked to just walk there and look at the trees and houses. We got arround by bus pretty good and did not need a car.
"
1978743,20826693,2014-10-06,9315663,Gail,"This is a beautiful home, kept by beautiful people! We couldn't have been happier with our time at Melissa and Abil's place. Jenna made us feel welcome immediately, and hurried to make our room up for us early (we thought we were just dropping off our bags). The entire house is just as lovely as it looks in the photos, and immaculately clean. We truly enjoyed chatting with the hosts and felt like we had found new (old) friends!
The neighborhood is very safe and walkable--you can walk to Capitol Hill, Pike Place Market or the International District in 20-30 minutes. It's also very easy to catch a bus back home at the end of a long day exploring. The room and bed are very comfortable, and the bathroom is super nice too. Great breakfasts every day with our choice of beverage (tea). Melissa and Abil take care of every detail to make sure you have a wonderful, carefree stay. We will definitely return the next time we are in Seattle!
"
1978743,21907537,2014-10-26,22381939,Charlotte,"This was the first time we've used Airbnb so we weren't sure what to expect, but we loved it. Both Melissa and Abil were extremely hospitable. They were always up for great conversations, especially when sitting around enjoying a local Pikes beer that Abil kindly keeps stocked for the guests. The suggestions for things to do around Seattle we found extremely useful and we did most of them. We never felt uncomfortable at any time staying with them, and we were more than comfortable in their home. The freshly baked muffins/pastries and the fresh fruit every morning was incredible. Also, because they have 4 guest rooms the chance of meeting other travelers is a good one. We absolutely loved our weekend in Seattle and if we ever make it back we will definitely be staying at Melissa and Abil's again!"
1978743,22583343,2014-11-10,21155572,Ville,"It's pure perfection. We were welcomed with open arms and showered with attention when appropriate. Everything was clean and there was loads of room to hang out in. Our friend became seriously ill and they helped take care of him and schedule a doctor's appointment. The hosts were accommodating and flexible with everything. A best stay anywhere ever, I recommend it to anyone going to Seattle."
1978743,24095911,2014-12-19,20286401,Alex,"This has to be the coziest coolest place to stay in Airbnb. Better than 5-star hotel by far. Place is super comfortable, bed is awesome, rooms are great, super fast wifi! And I haven't even mentioned the hosts, these ladies are super awesome. On top of everything breakfast is not only delicious but nutritious.  This place and hosts will make you feel at home and possibly better!!!!"
1978743,24680918,2015-01-01,20461081,Maya,"Melissa and Abil are really nice!!! The house is really adorable. They really care about their guest, we felt just like at home. We had wonderful breakfast everyday mad by Melissa. If we have chance to come to Seattle, we will definitely visit this place again!!!!

"
1978743,25335342,2015-01-12,3158779,Grace,"We had a wonderful time!  We didn't meet Melissa and Abil as their assistant, Courtney, was left in charge. She was a terrific host and extremely gracious and accommodating ... and her breakfasts were delicious!"
1978743,25715571,2015-01-24,14565253,Veronique,It s the second time we stay there because it s cozy and the hosts are fantastics. This time my  lost his passport in Portland airport. Melissa organized everything to have it back! And of course the freshly baked muffins are still delicious! Well it was perfect as usual!! 
1978743,26270140,2015-02-08,2470664,Jack,"I still can't believe what a stroke of luck it was finding Melissa and Abil. Scouting the perfect location for a short film can be one of the most difficult things to do on a budget. When I saw the most suitable place (this is an understatement) on airbnb, not only was this couple open and excited about the idea of accommodating a film crew, but they helped us through the whole day as well. Melissa is a top-notch professional chef who figured out a catering and craft service plan that kept the cast and crew morale high throughout the day. Delicious muffins, polenta stacks with pine nuts, oven-roasted yams, rosemary chicken, enchiladas with home-made sauce and Mexican rice, gourmet desserts, and plenty of fruit and vegetables and salmon and coffee to keep us going. One actress was had a handful of dietary restrictions, but Melissa took them all into account, making her feel very welcome. Also, she timed the preparation of everything to perfectly harmonize with the shooting schedule. We were constantly busy filming the whole day, but looking back now, I honestly don't know how she was able to do all of this.

When Melissa gave a tour of the whole place (they also have their own costume studio), I wondered how the house was so perfectly charming and victorian, and the only explanation has to be the years of hard work and artistic talent she and Abil put into creating it. Again, I feel touched and ridiculously lucky that they welcomed our crew. As a seasoned traveler myself, I have often wondered where someone would stay in Seattle to feel not like a traveler/tourist, but a resident of a home. This is that place.

Melissa and Abil are two intelligent and experienced, and incredibly patient people, warm conversationalists, and the whole cast/crew fell in love with them. It was a long day of filming (13+ hours), after which Abil picked out the perfect beer for each crew and cast member and we all celebrated. We certainly wouldn't have made it through the day without them, and now I know two people I'll want to stay in touch with in the years to come."
1978743,27983305,2015-03-15,18362681,Kris,"I arrived late nite on a short notice booking, and Melissa and her partner Abil were extremely warm and friendly welcoming me to their huge, historical home in Seattle's central district.  I was in Seattle for a short time and in fact spent just a short 2 nite's in a very comfortable room with ample space and privacy, just what I needed to rest up after spending a fast weekend out socializing w old friends.  The hosts provide great hospitality and there are many small, but welcome details such as water pitcher/ glasses in the room and continental style breakfast.  Very cool house and property!"
1978743,28435685,2015-03-23,28471831,Michael,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was great.  Melissa  met me at the door , gave me the tour, and I immediately felt at home.  The old Victorian home was spotless through out, tastefully and interestingly decorated.  My bed and bedding was very comfortable.  Fresh baked muffins, fruit and coffee were a perfect start every morning.
  The neighborhood is residential  and quiet.  A few restaurants within walking distance.  Figure out how use the bus system and you can go anywhere for cheap.  Take the 3 or 4 bus from the corner stop to 3rd street, from  3rd you can walk, bus , train, or trolley anywhere.  Get a samosa at the bodega across from the bus stop while you are waiting.
 Melissa, Abil, and Courtney were fun, easy to talk to, and made me feel I could really relax and ""let my hair down"" 
  Oh, I almost forgot the best thing.  A refrigerator shelf full of complimentary beer!
"
1978743,29738663,2015-04-12,27792170,Robert,"I consider ""Bed, Baked and Beyond"" to have been a very lucky find and I recommend it very highly. The hosts, Melissa and Abil and their assistant Courtney are all friendly, thoughtful and helpful. There are 2 cats. El Gato is aging and sedate, while Perla is elusive almost to the point of invisibility. The neighborhood is convenient to downtown and to Capitol Hill and is lovely in its own right.  If you bring a car, the hosts will provide you a guest pass allowing you to park in the street without time restrictions. The house and rooms are tastefully appointed with many thoughtful touches such as a desk and a pitcher of drinking water and glasses in every room.  The wifi is reliable. Guest rooms are on the second floor and there are comfortable sitting rooms on the first available for use by yourself and your guests. Every morning there is a breakfast consisting of fresh fruit, your choice of coffee or tea and Melissa's baked goods of the day, usually two muffins per person.  Melissa is a chef with a large repertoire and the baked goods are varied and delicious.

Based upon a stay of almost 3 weeks, I think the clientele is another advantage here. I met friendly people from the UK, China and South America.

The only potential problems during a stay here that I can imagine would be for people who have difficulty negotiating a flight of stairs or who are allergic to cats.  Unless, of course, you bring your problems with you."
1978743,30578605,2015-04-24,31175999,Jennifer,"This was my first stay through Airbnb and it certainly set the bar high for any future trips. Melissa and Abil (and their assistant Courtney) were very welcoming and instantly made me feel right at home. Their home is a true Seattle historical gem that is beautiful inside and out. My room was bright, clean and comfortable. I was taking a class at the local hospital and they made sure that I had fresh fruit and coffee each morning before I left. The house is located in a really fun neighborhood with many bars and restaurants within walking distance. I only wish that I had had more time to explore the neighborhood and house. I fully intend on returning for a longer trip with friends in the future. "
1978743,32357839,2015-05-17,6278739,Steve,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Cedar Tree guesthouse. Melissa and Courtney were easy to communicate with and very accommodating about our arrival time. Courtenay greeted us and was super friendly. The house was very lovely and well maintained, felt right at home. Comfortable bed, very clean and well appointed. Loved the artwork and books. We had the run of the house and helped ourselves to delicious leftover muffins at midnight after returning from dancing. Overall great experience. "
1978743,34132870,2015-06-05,30989039,Vic,"This was our first time to use Airbnb and what a pleasant surprise. Our problem now is Melissa has set the bar of expectations too high that most will surely suffer.  
Courtney who welcomed us when we arrived immediately attended to our needs by answering the typical queries of a first timer in a place.  And she gave us a tour of the house.
The place was as pictured, if not more. In this case the place was much nicer ""live"".
Melissa's muffins were something else.  Even her coffee was also very good.  Complaints, minor ones, were immediately attended to.  Melissa's wife  helped us in finding solutions to our travel issues. 
The couple indeed will make guests will at home thus improving the overall quality of one's vacation.  "
1978743,34939722,2015-06-14,15642376,Evelyn,"Our hosts Melissa and Abil and their assistant Courtney were so charming, warm, intelligent and joyful.  Their home is beautiful..clean, inviting, full of character and lovingly appointed. Breakfast is simply and deliciously homemade - healthy and served on china! Our room the Cherry Cedar was quiet and so very comfy.  Their garden and outdoor sitting area was picturesque with flowers birds squirrels and a very cool housecat smartly named El Gato. We Loved our stay with these amazing ladies...truly we wished we had booked a longer time.. We really felt at home."
1978743,35225624,2015-06-16,32820811,Elizabeth,"We were greeted with warm friendly smiles, with a beautiful room waiting for us in a gorgeous location convenient to all the places we wanted to see."
1978743,35578255,2015-06-20,805459,Linda,"Abil and Melissa are wonderful guests. They welcomed me by message on Airbnb first, and then made sure I could get to their location without any trouble. They walked me through the house with much details, and provided nice coffee and breakfast in the mornings. 

The room is quite spacious, with a dresser, desk and big closet which are not shown in the main picture. I travel light, and my hosts provide me with towels and shower essentials. I find myself feeling at home in this place. 

It is also a safe neighborhood to walk around.  "
1978743,36569189,2015-06-29,32161034,Spring,"All the hosts were extremely welcoming and super sweet! They'll do anything to make you feel at home and help out with almost anything, such as getting around Seattle, etc.The room in my opinion looks a lot better in person than the photos. The neighborhood is a bit old fashion but it has great bus lines that'll take you to UW and downtown area without any transfers. Parking is super easy which is also a plus, most likely will stay here again!!"
1978743,37177646,2015-07-05,7207896,Mark,"Melissa and Abil are gracious and entertaining hosts.  Our room was large, clean, comfortable and decorative.  Melissa makes delicious gluten-free muffins! We enjoyed our stay and we would stay with Melissa and Abil again."
1978743,38119542,2015-07-13,5956012,Nikki,"Melissa and Abil are amazing hosts! They are so thoughtful, and really took the time to make sure we had a comfortable stay while exploring Seattle. We were so grateful for their travel recommendations, since we were traveling from the NYC area and weren't too familiar with the neighborhood. By the end of our trip, we felt like pros! :)

Their bed and breakfast is beautiful, conveniently located, and there was plenty of on-street parking on their block. I can't say enough good things about our stay -- We can't wait to come back again! Thanks for all of your hospitality, Melissa & Abil!"
1978743,38600651,2015-07-17,165574,Jonathan,"As a Superhost myself in San Francisco, I have a good idea what it is like to create a setting and experience for Airbnb guests.  I can tell you that my stay at Melissa and Abil's home was fantastic.  They are both such warm, inviting and open hosts that make everyone feel welcome and special.  

The home itself is wonderful as they've fixed up a beautiful 1903 home to be the ultimate pensione for visitors to Seattle.  I stayed in a wonderful room that was clean, roomy, had great cross ventilation and just down right comfortable.  There are other rooms on the same floor that also look great.  The two bathrooms they have are convenient, clean and well equipped.

Melissa makes a fresh continental breakfast each morning including fresh fruit and it was divine each day.  I also had many wonderful conversations with Abil who is a fantastic woman.

One final note, I am quite allergic to cats, and they have two cats living in and around their home, but there was not once that I had any trace of allergies in my room and that was a huge and wonderful  benefit.  

All in all, this is a great place to stay for anyone coming to Seattle.  It is also especially close to Seattle University.  Very highly recommended!!
"
1978743,39063695,2015-07-20,17134735,Paula,"Our experience with Melissa, Abil, and Courtney set the bar for what home away from home should be! We felt instantly welcomed and charmed by the aesthetics and history of their home. But it was the hosts that made it all come together so perfectly. The reviews and photos were spot on and we can not say enough great things about our experience. In fact we did not want to leave and only wished we had more time to stay and talk with everyone. Don't think twice or waste your time and money elsewhere. Book your stay or private event here, they book up very quickly!"
1978743,39542433,2015-07-24,5069061,Amani,"Melissa, Abil and their assistant were absolutely wonderful and welcoming. We felt at home right away in their beautiful home. Our room was lovely and exactly as described and pictured. We will definitely be back the next time we are in Seattle. Our time with Melissa and Abil was special and precious. And the morning fruit & muffins were amazing!!!"
1978743,39736525,2015-07-26,4733105,Yasmin,Beers in the fridge waiting for us! everything was great
1978743,40232768,2015-07-29,20763517,Christian,"Abil and Melissa were delightful hosts and wonderful, funny ladies to be around during my recent 3 night stay in Seattle.   I felt completely at home the entire time.   The Arty ""Cedar Tree"" Room of this beautiful and charming home is exactly as advertised- clean, comfortable, and cozy, all the while having a artsy aesthetic and an overall great vibe.  The bed is particularly heavenly-- just sayin'. 

Upon arrival, I was greeted by Abil and immediately given a tour of the entire home.  Everything including daily procedures, home etiquette, directions to and from downtown Seattle, as well as transportation, and nearby restaurants and cafes.  Both Abil and Melissa were extremely helpful in suggesting the best local spots to visit.  You're given keys to your room and the house as well and complementary breakfast is served from 8-8:30 every morning including delicious muffins (made by Melissa) fruit, and coffee.  There's also a lounge area out back in the shed which they've transformed into a cozy space for a recreation of your choice.  Also, don't forget to say hi to their cat ""El Gato"" if you bump into him along the way.

Just can't say enough good things about this place.   I will definitely return the next time I'm in town! "
1978743,40900619,2015-08-03,18143813,Shauna,"Melissa and Abel were fantastic hosts! We had such a blast in their beautiful home. This is not a typical air bnb experience because they take it to the next level. We were served a beautiful breakfast of fresh fruit and fresh baked muffins every morning along with our choice of coffee or tea. Two lounge rooms, big dining room and kitchen all available for guests to use as well as plenty of outdoor space. They had plenty of recommendations for our stay as well. Courtney the house assistant was also extremely helpful, so you had three great ladies there and available if you needed anything. We highly recommend staying here if you're in Seattle! Location wise, it's a close walk to the Capital Hill area and a longer walk and short uber ride to Pike's place. Oh and we can't forget the fridge full of complementary beer for the guests! Not a thing to complain about here! We were even fed dinner the first night we arrived thanks to Courtney cooking up a large batch of chicken pot pie! So lucky to have found this place and will stay here again if we come back to Seattle!!"
1978743,41237644,2015-08-05,23952696,Rhys,"This place is hands down the BEST bnb you can imagine. Warm, humble beautiful hosts, great attention to detail and amazing cooking. The muffins for breakfast are to die for (and Pikes Place beer stocked in the fridge is a bonus). Our hosts had great knowledge and understanding of the local area and their passion for showing off Seattle made our stay the most incredible experience we've ever had traveling. Thanks so much for your hospitality. If you're in town make this your number one stop for AirBnB, you will love it! "
1978743,42688712,2015-08-15,428620,Joy,"This was the best airbnb experience I've ever had! Melissa and Abil were welcoming hosts, even stocking the refrigerator with free beer for guests. The room itself was tastefully furnished, clean, and comfortable. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I've never slept so well away from home (even in comparison to hotels)! 

Every morning, a light breakfast of tasty, homemade muffins were provided along with fruit. Melissa and Abil were both quite knowledgeable about Seattle, and my husband and I had a great time chatting with them about the wonderful city. Street parking was not a problem, and the location itself is convenient to downtown. Overall, Melissa and Abil made us feel right at home with their kind hospitality, and I would not hesitate to stay at their place again in the future."
1978743,45074286,2015-08-31,34020784,Suzanne,"Excellent accommodations and excellent hosts!! Super wonderful place to stay for any trip you have to the Seattle area. The hosts were very welcoming, everything in the accommodations was as posted. It was not like staying in someone's home, but in an actual Bed & Breakfast. The complimentary breakfast of muffins and fruit was delightful! We will absolutely book here again!!!"
1978743,46325851,2015-09-09,42524369,Doreen,"Melissa and Abil are fantastic hosts who seem to love what they do, and they do a wonderful job keeping up with all their guests and making sure everyone has a great time. The location was great for us (just a short stroll to get to downtown or public transport) and our room was very nice, clean and cozy. Melissa was very great at accommodating my difficult dietary restrictions and the great local beer in the refrigerator was a very nice touch. All in all, the reviews don't lie; very positive experience and a great place to enjoy what the city has to offer!"
1978743,47104911,2015-09-15,5338700,Melissa,"From the moment I walked through the door I felt like was at my friends' home.  I arrived late in the evening from Olympia and Melissa immediately offered me something to eat.  The room was great, the bed was comfortable, and everything was super clean.  I had to leave for a meeting early in the morning so they saved me fresh fruit and a muffin for when I got home.  They also were flexible on when I turned in my keys and parking pass which was helpful since I had to be at a conference until 4pm.  This was a wonderful first time airbnb experience.  Thanks to Melissa and Abil!!!! "
1978743,51695366,2015-10-24,36541063,Andrea,This place is amazing. Melissa and Abil are wonderful hosts and really make you feel at home. They have a great knowledge of the city and great suggestions for things to do. The house is beautiful and amazing as well. My husband and I did 7 days in Seattle for our honeymoon and cannot express how much fun we had. Thank you so much for everything!
1978743,54459896,2015-11-20,14565253,Veronique,"It's our third time at Bed Bake and Beyond and as usual, our stay was perfect. Abil and Melissa know how to make you feel at home. We walked down to Downtown Seattle, it's only 30 min and it a great way to discover the city. The neighborhood is very pleasant and peaceful. There are some very nice restaurants near by and we're also close by Lake Washington for a nice run on the morning. "
677266,2339304,2012-09-18,3515772,Mary Beth,"Angielena was a wonderful host. She gave us a great introduction to the neighborhood and the art center, and was available when we needed anything, always friendly and cheerful. Her dogs were sweet and adorable, and quiet. There are no words for the awesomeness of the shower, and the kitchen was a gret resource too. Such a fun area of ton and such a great place to stay!"
677266,2873146,2012-11-12,966003,Kelly & Cyril,"Talk about lovely! If you want an inspiring, friendly and cozy place to rest your feet.....you found what you're looking for. First let's talk about the space....private room, shared quiet kitchen and the most amazing ""Barry white"" bathroom. I could spend days in that shower! not to mention that you share the building with the friendliest, most creative and innovative local artists in that part of town!

Now about our host: Angielena is extremely kind, incredibly helpful, informative and honest. We instantly felt welcome and free to respectfully be at home in the space. She is a lovely, genuin woman. We are happy to know her as a future AirBnB host and as new found friend."
677266,5541013,2013-07-05,6124061,Rusten,"The space is really nice and we appreciated the artistic and non-commercial atmosphere. The room itself was extremely comfortable and despite all of the activity in the building, the thick walls insured the possibility of privacy and relaxation. The bathroom is luxurious, almost to the point of absurdity although we were not complaining and enjoyed it thoroughly. It was also nice to have a functional kitchen, being sick of eating out after a month away from home. The hosts were extremely welcoming and helpful. Recommended for those looking for an alternative to a fancy bed and breakfast or hotel with an uptight character. "
677266,6239836,2013-08-05,6559891,Jacki,"Angielena is the warmest, loveliest host imaginable.  The rooms are nicely appointed, have window AC units (useful during the few warm summer days Seattle gets), and, despite being in a grand old building in the heart of Georgetown, are quiet!  The ultra-glam bathroom will astound and delight, and the charming wide balcony overlooking the Georgetown Trailer Park shops is fantastic for hanging out."
677266,6359061,2013-08-09,7897897,Erin,"Angielena was so friendly and a wonderful host. The space is amazing. Perfect for my few days in Seattle. I definitely recommend staying here if you get the chance, and definitely take a shower in the ""Barry White"" shower!"
677266,6434545,2013-08-12,3837801,Logan,"This was an awesome place to stay and Angielena was super cool.  It's located in Georgetown, an old industrial area with awesome buildings (one of which holds this room) that has become a sort of arts district.  Behind the building is the ""Trailer Park Mall,"" a sort of flea market/vintage shop gig with vendors selling out of old-school trailers.  ""Art Attack"", a monthly art walk happened to correspond with our visit along with some surprise entertainment--a drag show--on stage in the Trailer Park Mall. We had the perfect vantage point for the show, the balcony porch on the back of the building.  Also, the room was clean and comfortable and the (shared) shower was awesome."
677266,6695783,2013-08-21,7978810,Amy,"This is a charming and cozy place to stay. The building is old and classy and FULL of art--in the rooms, in the hallways, in the studios of all the artists who work there. 
As mentioned by other reviewers, the bathroom is super cool. 
Host Angielena is wonderful. Very knowledgeable about the building and the Georgetown neighborhood and she's genuinely concerned about making you feel welcome, safe and comfortable (I had a minor problem with my room and she helped fix it immediately.) 
The Trailer Park Mall takes place just behind the building and there's a sweet back porch area overlooking it. I didn't get a chance to enjoy either one properly--it was a busy trip this time around, but when I come to Seattle again, I know where I'll stay!"
677266,6903321,2013-08-29,7930374,Sarah,"We spent three nights in Georgetown at Angielena's bed and breakfast. She was very nice and welcoming. It was unusual and pleasant to stay just nearby an art studio and in that nice old brick building with lot of charm. We appreciated the former industrial neighborhood with great restaurants just next door, artsy shops, and a local brewery. The Toulouse Lautrec Room was small, we were surprised that the window could not be opened, so we had to use the fan or the air conditioner unit (old and noisy), which was quite annoying. The breakfast provided was coffee, juice and a pack of muffins to share with other room guests that was not sufficient after a couple of days.
Kitchen and bathroom were well-equipped and clean. Easy access to downtown through bus that stops just across the street."
677266,8467152,2013-11-01,1058448,Claudia,"Inspiring house, surrounded by art and artists, good place for concentration, working and to relax. Thank you Angielena - for the good art tips and the hosting! see you soon:-)."
677266,10442839,2014-02-18,11803109,Patrick,"Angielena was very nice.  The value isn't bad but I think a couple changes would really make this a good value.  First, a cheap fix would be to add 3 more coat hooks in the bedroom...a couple for hanging your towels and a couple for hanging coats, etc.  The room and bathroom was clean.  Gripes: the bed wasn't supported very well on one side, the transom window is way too bright at night (I ended up unscrewing the hallway light...sorry!) and the bathroom is bit of a walk from the room.  It's in a cool & funky building and a cool neighborhood.  It's close to the freeway and downtown."
677266,10560477,2014-02-24,1308662,Josh,"My stay at Angielena's glorious Georgetown building was so wonderful and comfortable - and she is such a lovely, charming and accommodating host! The building itself reeks of history - just walking down the hallways and hearing the creaks of the hardwood floors and staircase gave me goosebumps wondering what stories the walls could tell. If you want a good experience exploring one of Seattle's oldest neighborhoods, stay a weekend roaming around Airport Way, grab a drink at one of the many fun bars, get a haircut at Spectrum House, pick out some vinyl at Georgetown Records - and stay at Angielena's place, which is right in the center of it all!"
677266,11800185,2014-04-15,942004,Lily,"Beautiful, fabulous, and VERY comfortable room!  We slept very well in the ultra comfy bed this room has.  It comes with two fantastic bathrobes, which I completely forgot about til the last day!  So if you stay in this room, don't forget about the bathrobes!
Angielena is an amazing host and made the check in/out processes super super easy.  I want to LIVE in this building!  It's awesome!"
677266,13115947,2014-05-19,9252239,Shandra,I loved staying in Georgetown in Angielena's bnb. The neighborhood was so cool with three breweries blocks from each other. The room was very nice to stay in and the shower was awe-inspiring. I will definitely be back to stay! 
677266,13449976,2014-05-27,1911486,Andrea,"Comfortable and unique stay at Angielena's art studio/bnb.The Toulous Lactrec room itself was charming and basic. A bit small for two people perhaps, but I fine for just myself. Comfortable bed.  Everything was clean; having forgotten my flip flops, I walked around bare-foot at times and the floor was amazingly grit-free!  Everything is well-thought-out for guests, toiletries in the bathroom, breakfast items in the kitchenette, bathrobe, etc. 

Wish I could have spent more time exploring the neighborhood which seemed to offer many interesting places to eat and shops to explore.  Neighborhood is a bit industrial, but was very safe.  The bus downtown is right across the street and was very convenient.  I would recommend this place to anyone who wanted to get another view of Seattle!"
677266,13514518,2014-05-29,15004393,Nico,"Georgetown is a great place, close to the airport and less than 30mn to go in downtown (bus). Angelina was a perfect hostess, with good advices (food, places to visit). Last thing : amazing bathroom :-)"
677266,14911320,2014-06-29,3558440,Angel,"Angielena is a dear!, a wonderful hostess and source of info for the Seattle area. The room was cozy and the building was quiet. The Barry White bathroom is all that and then some. A great bar sits below the rooms. In fact, the entire Georgetown neighborhood was a treasure: great bars, restaurants, and a record store. If ever we return to Seattle, we'll be staying at Angielena's awesome place. "
677266,15221240,2014-07-05,6771426,Nick,"I had a blast in Seattle. Angielena was fantastic, and I appreciated being able to bring Kevin (my dog) along with me so much! She was so helpful, even walking my dog when I was gone for an afternoon. The room came with a ton of neighborhood and city information which was also very helpful.

The room was small, but comfortable, cozy and perfect for what I needed (a place to sleep!) The bathroom was incredible... definitely a selling point. I think I counted 8 shower heads? It felt amazing #enjoy. The building was historic and awesome: wood floors, art everywhere, cool tenants. The bar downstairs was great for food, beer, and camaraderie.

Also, there's an excellent yoga studio right up the block (Yoga Smith) which offered a ""Men's Only"" class which I found stimulating and cathartic. Definitely check it out, or try one of the co-ed classes. Great teachers! Angielena recommended it and I'm so glad she did!"
677266,15562468,2014-07-11,17772592,Heidi,"Angielena was fantastic! She was super friendly, accommodating, and a pleasure to have as a host. Georgetown is within easy public transportation to the rest seattle, as well as being a wicked area to spend time in. I came through traveling with my 60 y.o. mother and she had a blast in this location. It was wonderful to be around all of the art in her building. All of the other artists renting space from her were wonderful people and phenomenal to be around. I recommend this space to anyone traveling through and will definitely stay here the next time I'm in Seattle!"
677266,15644540,2014-07-13,16194590,Rina,"Angielena is a super awesome host! She is very accommodating and very knowledgeable about the area. She was super quick responding to my text and answered every question I had regarding anything related to my trip/my stay in the room. The room is perfectly cozy, just right for one person, with lots of sunlight in the daytime and a big comfy bed. The whole building is overall really marvelous, (if you have a chance walk around and explore it). There's a back porch that makes it perfect for enjoying lunch of just lounging. Easy access to Downtown Seattle and other areas of the city by bus, but there are lots of places to walk to around the area. Totally recommended for any artist/anyone interested in art to come stay here, or for anyone looking to see a super groovy part of Seattle."
677266,15791439,2014-07-15,17652617,Max,Very hip & funky b&b/artist studio space! Angielena was a great hostess. Loved the Barry White bathroom. Thanks!!
677266,16085732,2014-07-22,357847,Patrick,"My wife and I enjoyed our stay at Angielena's listing.  She was a very thorough and kind host.  The room had everything we needed with access to a kitchen with a fridge which was nice.  The building is mainly used as private art studio, with lots of studios, so there were fun people around.  We enjoyed the neighborhood and restaurants around the building, though we found ourselves taking the bus downtown each day.  Overall, we had a great time."
677266,16276230,2014-07-24,17616921,Corwin,"Thank you for such an amazing stay!
Angielena was amazing! The building, the atmosphere, the neighbourhood... it was all so much more than I had expected. 
We arrived a little early and Angielena dropped what she was doing to welcome us and give us the low down on the building, and the neighbourhood. 
The building is part ""hotel"" (for lack of a better word), part artist's studios/apartments/part art gallery. What a great and friendly atmosphere. 

Very historic building, and neighbourhood, and great restaurants and shops. Of special note, La Catrina (a Mexican restaurant just steps from this building) was probably the best Mexican place I have ever been too. 

If I hadn't stayed at Angielena's then I would never have discovered the Gerogetown neighbourhood, and I'm certainly glad I did! Unfortunately I stayed during the week, so I missed the Trailer Park Mall (full of vintage and artistic goodies) that happens behind this building every weekend. So, next time I'll definitely try to hit that next time I'm back. Also, I will certainly be recommending this place to family/friends looking for a place to stay in Seattle.

Thanks again for a great stay!"
677266,16355875,2014-07-26,16211270,Marcy,Loved LOVED our stay in this amazing room and building! Angelina is a very accommodating host--especially with our hectic travel schedule! The room was just lovely! Bed super comfortable and the location was perfect! Georgetown was the perfect place to stay in visiting Seattle! We will absolutely be staying here again!
677266,16918250,2014-08-04,16927619,Lauren,"Angielena was a fantastic and accommodating host. The building had such amazing character and the Georgetown neighborhood was very vibrant. The building houses artists studios as well as other guests, so there were great people to meet and people were always coming and going, but the space was peaceful and quite. I would definitely recommend staying here. "
677266,17161688,2014-08-08,2933330,Martin,"Lovely place to stay - exactly my kind of neighbourhood and a great,old building. Truly astonishing shower and good coffee."
677266,17534179,2014-08-13,17483693,Paulina,"Angielena is such an amazing host. I love her energy and beautiful spirit. She is easy and fast to reach out to her. Both my sister and I took her suggestions for the local spots around the area. The area itself is a small block full of great local bars and restaurants. The vintage trucks in the back are incredibly awesome. Adds that extra charm to the zone.She has a great deck to enjoy a nice glass of wine overseeing the vintage stores. Great for those relaxing evenings. The place itself is about 10 min drive to main downtown area in Seattle and being so close to the freeway makes it an easy access. The room size is great for the price. The shared bathroom is 5 star awesomess. Super clean, never had an issue with sharing with other guests and can we say the awesomeness comes from the beautiful 7 shower heads. I would highly recommend checking this place out. You won't have to deal with the craziness traffic in town and the parking costs. "
677266,17634276,2014-08-15,4966833,Brianna,"There was a slight mix up with our reservation so this review is for a different room.  Angielina was very very helpful, the room is clean and the location is great! Georgetown has a ton of great place to eat and drink.
Angielina was very accommodating when we needed to stay another night!!"
677266,17819660,2014-08-18,13955808,Greg,"great room,great host, great location, steps from great coffee, beer. We couldn't have asked for better, and a fun fancy bathroom!"
677266,18212548,2014-08-23,709056,Brad,"Fantastic experience for the sadly brief period I was there. The neighborhood is phenomenally cool, both in terms of the vibe and overall aesthetics, but mostly because of the people who live there--Angielena being a major presence and influence. The space itself is in an older, character-ridden building and quite comfortable being a shared environment. There's plenty of privacy in the room itself, and the bed is fantastically comfortable. The shower is other-worldly. Really enjoyed my stay and look forward to returning."
677266,18435020,2014-08-26,11711646,Victoria,This place is amazing! Angielena was such a good host she told me all the great spots to hit and was so nice! I loved Georgetown I definitely would stay here again in a heart beat. The bus was right outside and a cab downtown is under 20 bucks. Thanks again! Loved it!
677266,18608134,2014-08-28,2313468,Aly,"We had such a great stay and Angielena was wonderful! We really appreciated that she gave us a detailed tour of the building when we arrived so we knew where everything was/how everything worked, that she recommended restaurants and things to do, and even spent some time going over Seattle neighborhoods with us when we told her we had just relocated to the area and were looking for an apartment. We had high expectations of the bathroom/shower after reading other reviews but it still managed to exceed what we were imagining, and we miss it a lot. The bed/sheets were really comfy, the parking was easy and convenient and the neighborhood's super cool. Thanks so much! "
677266,20285680,2014-09-27,19579810,Xinyu,Perfect place  to stay with artists
677266,20858278,2014-10-06,21576529,Lucas,"Angielena was ready for our arrival and made us feel very welcome. Room was just what we needed, and like she describes, the bathroom is amazing. Georgetown is a lot of fun and not a bad place to spend a weekend in seattle at all."
677266,25362653,2015-01-13,6868309,Tony,The room was very private and the bed was comfortable. It was perfect for my stay.
677266,26403311,2015-02-11,24680413,Robert,I had a fantastic time in the Toulouse Lautrec room. The room is clean and spacious as pictured and the bed is super comfortable. The way the room is laid out was perfect for me and I was able to work at the desk and do yoga in the evening. There is a really great kitchen two doors down and 2 bathrooms around the corner. I really liked the vibe and it is a great deal for the price. Angelina was a delight and covered everything I needed to know about my stay in a really friendly way when I checked in. I would definitely stay there again.
677266,27327331,2015-03-02,18655532,Doreen,"The space was pretty awesome, with lots of art and cool furniture everywhere. The fancy bathroom was really nice, even though we were asked to use only one of the multiple showerheads. There is also a lot of light coming into the bedroom at night, as there's a window over the door and the hallways are brightly lit. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend Georgetown visitors to stay at this place."
677266,27435797,2015-03-04,27205990,Lukas,Unfortunately I was unable to contact the host by email and phone on the day of arrival and ended up sleeping for a night on a friends couch. It worked out for the second night though.
677266,28480459,2015-03-24,20118621,Kristin,"We had a wonderful stay at Angielena's. She was warm, inviting and helpful, offering us many tips on where to go.  Our room was comfy, the Barry White bathroom was amazing with its six showerheads, the building quaint and quiet.  The location is excellent, within a few blocks of sll of Georgetown's hot spots.  Highly recommended!"
677266,31524671,2015-05-06,2373605,Mike,"Staying at the arts center was really a great choice. There was a show while it was there, along with studio tours. The accommodations are excellent and Angielena make's sure of it. The suites are in a vintage building with historical value. The Georgetown neighborhood is very friendly, very unique, and its benefit sufficiently isolated from the rest of the city. "
677266,33280320,2015-05-26,28810439,Courtney,I had a good time at Angie's place. The area and other tenants are always very friendly which immediately makes any stay more pleasant.  Quite disappointing that the wifi wasn't working for the entire time as I specifically booked a place with wifi because I needed to work. Luckily All City Coffee down the road was fantastic and I got a lot done. Angie was friendly and helpful. The photographs of the place are not quite accurate - there are many different rooms and the photos seem to be a mixture. I stayed in the vintage room and there are much more modern-looking rooms. The stay was overall good and the shower was a lot of fun!
677266,34328231,2015-06-07,458773,Maureen,"I have a mixed response to this accommodation.  On the positive side,  Angielena provides all kinds of useful maps and information for her guests.  The building is apparently an old hotel which she is in the process of remodelling--you should see the fabulous main bathroom.  It looks like something from an elegant spa!  The room was clean and the bed very comfortable, and there's a bus stop right outside the door.   

On the negative side, most of the place has not yet been remodelled and looks rather like a sleazy old hotel (except for the great artwork!). The room was small, dark, and somewhat dismal with peeling paint on the ceiling.  The bed, wardrobe, small desk, and hard wood chair almost totally filled it and there isn't much of a public area simply to sit comfortably to talk or read.  The bar fridge in the small kitchen is inadequate for 6 guests, even though some overload is possible in a 2nd one which seems to be for non-AirBnB tenants, and I had to go to a thrift store to buy myself some forks.  One tenant told me the neighbourhood “isn’t too good.” I arrived early–my bad; I should have paid attention to the check-in time (3 pm)–but, though we connected at 2 pm, she didn’t have the room ready ‘till 4 pm and seemed in no hurry to get it ready.  I don't think I'd stay there again."
677266,35584415,2015-06-20,21864434,Nick,"Our stay with Angielena was great. Luckily we arrived right before carnival so it was definitely the place to me. The room is simple but suitable for the price. The kitchen is shared but we had no problems with other guests. 

As all reviews state, the multi headed shower is pretty sweet. Pity you cant keep them all on. 

Location is great, public transport right outside the door and plenty of cafes and bars nearby."
677266,36799534,2015-07-01,573841,Scott,"I loved my time in Georgetown. While the location is a little distant from downtown (if you don't have your own car), Georgetown itself offers a variety of small shops and restaurants each of which is delightful and staffed with friendly folks.

My room was air-conditioned, which was nice because of the abnormally warm week. The balcony in the back of the building was also a delight to hangout in.

However, if you are looking for a traditional airbnb in someone's house or apartment, this is not it. This felt more like a cozy small hotel rather than the usual airbnb experience. That being said, the other tenants and artists were polite and didn't make any disruptive noise.

Additionally, the space is shared with local artist studios, and they seem to use most of the space in the kitchen. So if you stay here, you'll find it easier to have your meals out, since the kitchen is small and has little/no storage space."
677266,37381182,2015-07-06,23201386,Amy,"The space was perfect. Our room was comfortable, quiet and clean with a life saving air conditioner! Hanging out on the back deck in the evening was super dreamy. Angielena was so friendly and laid back it was like staying at a friend's house if your friend had a huge historic building that used to be a brothel. ;) I was a tad worried that it would be creepy (I scare quite easily) because it's such an old building but it was peaceful and positive even at night. We will be back if Angielena will have us!"
677266,39415206,2015-07-23,34749272,Ian,Very welcoming host. Great location. Clean comfortable rooms. Would recommend!  
677266,39968946,2015-07-27,36726732,Sheila,"I had a wonderful experience at Angielena's place. She made me feel welcome and gave me a complete tour of the building space. The room was exactly what I needed for my short stay. I was taking a painting workshop in Georgetown, and this was very close to the art center which worked out perfectly. It was fun to share a building with other artists since she has lots of artwork (including her own!) hanging on the walls."
677266,40819058,2015-08-02,34328773,Laura,Fantastic place! Angielena was so welcoming and gave great recommendations for my first time in the neighborhood. The building is gorgeous and full of interesting people. Will definitely visit again!
677266,41241262,2015-08-05,38023452,Ian,"The Toulouse Latrec room was a lovely place to stay! From the get-go, Angielena set a joyful tone for my stay with a warm welcome and informative orientation. I thoroughly enjoyed the communal atmosphere of the building and the back porch was a frequent haunt of mine, for reading and relaxing. The location in the historic Georgetown neighborhood led to excellent food options and its closeness to bus stops made this place ideal for launching excursions into Downtown Seattle. This was one of my first dealings with AirBnB and the wonderful hospitality and great location will undoubtedly draw me back here again!"
677266,41454783,2015-08-07,13217748,Ecaterina,"I had a great time in Seattle! Angielena was a great and very helpful host. The room is nice, great bathroom (so many shower heads!! ^_^) and also a small and convenient kitchen. The back terrace is a nice place to have a glass of wine in the evening or coffee in the morning. The location is nice, 15 min by bus to Downtown, but also many nice restaurants nearby. Thank you Angielena!"
677266,41962983,2015-08-10,19185026,Lucia,"Had a wonderful time there during a long weekend business trip to Seattle.  Angielena was a wonderful hostess.  She gave a warm welcome when I arrived, took time to show me around and explain the building, and gave me the privacy that I needed.  The room was small but cozy, very clean, had a big comfortable bed, and had a very efficient window A/C unit that was greatly appreciated.  Wifi was consistent although not particularly speedy.  The bathroom shower was AMAZING and definitely a highlight of my stay.  The artists community was fun and eclectic and I really enjoyed the area, which was also very convenient and a short bus ride to both downtown Seattle and the SeaTac Airport.  I highly recommend this place and would definitely consider staying there again for future trips to Seattle!"
677266,43313573,2015-08-18,5670855,Bill,"This was a great place to stay in Seattle. I wish I had made more time to hang out in the Georgetown neighborhood, but this was our first trip to Seattle and we did the tourist thing, Even though we ended up getting in to town unexpectedly late, Angielena made arrangements to make sure we could check in hassle free. Would stay here again on our next trip."
677266,44184512,2015-08-24,2579472,Julie,"Staying with Angielena was an amazing, hassle-free experience. She was very good with communicating to us, and she showed us around the historic building, which make our stay in Seattle a unique experience. She was also always available when we called her if we had any questions. My husband and I had an enjoyable stay and we highly recommend staying with Angielena in this historic part of Seattle! "
677266,45300725,2015-09-01,40897590,Nathaniel,"Angielena is one of the most welcoming people I've ever had the opportunity of meeting. Upon entry, I was given a comprehensive tour of the building and explained the rules of the house in a manner that made me feel very comfortable and safe, as well as part of a community (Simple rules, like turning off the A/C when out, or being respectful of bathroom/shower lengths). 
Not only was the place as wonderful as advertised, but also there were hidden gems throughout my stay! the shared balcony outside is particularly my favorite accommodations, but also the lending library in the foyer and the Barry White bathroom (with over ten different shower heads!) made every aspect of my stay entirely comfortable (also, the provided bathrobe was one of the softest I've ever used).
Also, throughout my stay, Angielena and Fred (the night manager) offered me countless courtesy's simply because they wanted my stay to be enjoyable and, in my opinion, because they're nice people. 
From the record store around the corner to the Trailer Park Mall in the backyard, the area is as charming and interesting as one could hope. Angielena and Fred aren't the only people worth meeting in this area, as the locals are warm and welcoming to out-of-towners. 
Overall, I can't find a single negative thing to say about my stay with Angielena, I would absolutely do it again, and I think it's an experience that anyone could find enjoyable. 
"
677266,46139555,2015-09-08,3850735,Katy,Angielena was a wonderful hostess. I stayed here when I was in town for a friend's wedding reception that was being held at the Stables which is a venue next door. It was a VERY convenient location! She took the time to make me feel welcomed and was very accommodating. She was very useful and recommended the best way to get to certain places and recommended great restaurants in the area. 
677266,46434638,2015-09-10,2380289,Dixon,"This old timey hotel is very worthwhile and in a great neighborhood for drinks, food and friendly bohemians. "
677266,48005113,2015-09-22,42434439,Glenda,"Angielena was a perfect host.  We communicated several times prior to my arrival.  She met me and gave me a tour of her building, how it is used and her goals.  I was in town to attend an art class that was in walking distance of the BNB.  Angielena being an artist understood my needs perfectly.  The room was perfect for my needs and the bed was the most comfortable one I have EVER slept in.  I would definitely recommend her to others, especially artists."
677266,49641208,2015-10-05,42956339,Colleen,"This is my second time staying with Angielena and, as before, we had a wonderful time. Everything was as described, clean and very comfortable. We came to go to Elysian's Pumpkin Festival and it was wonderfully close. The neighborhood is charming and eclectic with a great coffee shop right next door and a bar/restaurant underneath. Despite how busy it was, the noise was minimal upstairs and I had no trouble sleeping. The rooms have both A/C and heat depending on the weather, though it was still warm out so we still needed the A/C. The Barry White bathroom is a nice luxury, as well. We will definitely stay again! "
677266,52307909,2015-10-28,32893968,Emma,"Angielena was a great host! She made us feel very welcomed, gave a little tour of the space and a brief history of the building. We were a little scatter-brained upon arrival due to the change in time from the east coast and she took it in stride, which we appreciated. The room was just as listed. The neighborhood was a mix of artsy and industrial, just how we like it. We really lucked out with this place, there was a coffeeshop & a bar right downstairs which are two things I enjoy."
677266,54856432,2015-11-25,7091526,Ginger,Greeted us like old friends. Who love staying at Angelina's. 
7664899,42209096,2015-08-11,1756513,Andrew,Alex was a great host. He was super welcoming and gave great tips for exploring the area. The house is very close to several downtown neighborhoods. Would absolutely stay here again.
7664899,42614302,2015-08-14,21337314,Min,Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay during our short stay in Seattle. Alex was very accommodating and the place was immaculate and conveniently located. 
7664899,51787184,2015-10-24,8386274,Helge,"What an awesome stay. We were in Seattle for 9 days and stayed here the whole time. The house is like new and absolutely beautiful. Staying on the rooftop with downtown in front of you is impressing. The rooms are clean with nice furniture in it. The location is great and all the great neighborhoods with bars and restaurants are only a couple of minutes away. Alex, his girlfriend and their dog are really nice and easy. We recommend this place and would stay there again any time. "
2032805,9559133,2014-01-02,8938233,Blain,"Melissa and Abil were amazing, helpful, outgoing hosts that you could tell take great passion and pride in being Airbnb hosts. 

Their house is large, newly reno'd and gorgeous. There's plenty of room to entertain my own guests and surprisingly comfortable beds (I'm kinda a bed snob). 

They made my extra-long weekend stay so comfortable! It truly felt like a home away from home...I just didn't need to do laundry or make breakfast! 

Speaking of which I highly recommend their southern breakfast! Delicious and large. I also took part in their very educational beer tasting. I was amazed with Abil's depth of knowledge; from the different styles of beers to their general and specific histories and the creative processes that go into this amazingly old, complex craft. 

They went out of their way for me, succeeding in finding me a ride when on NYE no cab company could be reached. Their love for life and even strangers added so much to what was a beautifully relaxing vacation. 

I look forward to returning to this Airbnb soon and HIGHLY recommend it to anyone seeking a relaxing, chilled time in Seattle with two connected, lovely women. 

Blain Lowden"
2032805,10690040,2014-03-03,7318523,Lisa,"If you're going to go to Seattle, you NEED to stay with Melissa and Abil! Their house is beautiful, they are wonderful and informative hosts, and Melissa bakes delicious goods. They were even nice enough to help me get to the airport on my way back. I was in town for a writers' conference and everyone else who stayed in the huge hotel was jealous of my amazing find. They're within walking distance of a lot of fantastic bars, food markets, and restaurants. Take all of their advice! They have great recommendations!   "
2032805,11213185,2014-03-25,10745736,Henry,"The true joy of a bed and breakfast is feeling like you are in a cozy, welcoming home vs. a non-descript hotel room.  Not only are the rooms and garden lovely, but Melissa couldn’t have been any nicer.  From the amazing fruit, baked goods, and fresh ground coffee to her wonderful personality at the end of a long day, I can’t imagine my stay being any better.  

The house was warm and inviting and located walking distance to everything we were doing.  And don’t be afraid to let Melissa know if you have special dietary needs.  Her gluten and dairy free baking was amazing!  

Worth every penny.  We will be back, and we plan to bring friends! "
2032805,11812083,2014-04-15,5080180,Ellen,"Seriously charming!  This guest house is beautiful, well-appointed and warmly hosted.  Melissa and Abil are welcoming, open, unobtrusive, and as helpful as you'd like them to be.  There are several gorgeous rooms in this recently renovated gem, each with its own personality. My daughter and I looked forward to a delicious breakfast each morning and are missing the specially homemade goods and coffee now that we are gone.  We were visiting Seattle University and this location is an easy stroll to there and to several bus lines.  I will definitely book a room with these lovely people in this beautiful place again."
2032805,12323253,2014-04-28,13823298,Gopal,"Melissa and Abil were great hosts. The house was a charm. Every single room had an art piece to admire. You could spend hours. Unfortunately I didn't have that much time, as I was just there in the city for finding apartments. They helped me with some useful tips on places to eat and live.
Definitely try this place!"
2032805,12804369,2014-05-11,15152016,Natalie,"Our stay at Melissa and Abil's excruciatingly charming house couldn't have been any better! It was such a delightful experience that I could talk about it for days. We were treated extremely nice by this lovely couple from the second we met, to the minute we left, and you can't help but smile seeing such a nice loving couple and feeling that warmth emanate throughout the house. For a moment, I felt as if I lived there and honestly would take my sweet time to explore the city, or linger around the house simply because I felt that comfortable there that it is too irresistible not to. You can't ask for better hosts. Oh and may I add that Melissa is an exquisite chef and offers her wonderful cooking each morning-beautifully set waiting for you after your cozy slumber in their more than suitable rooms and accommodations. The decor and carefully designed home is another charm to marvel at.  Aside from their exceeding hospitality, abil and Melissa are a simply genuinely nice, informative, extremely welcoming with open arms pair that I would love to come and visit again! I am most definitely getting in touch with them again for our next visit to Seattle! After my experience at their home, I was reminded that amazing people like them still exist :) Thank you Melissa and Abil!"
2032805,13296976,2014-05-24,3346850,Evan,"Melissa and Abil's charming bed-and-breakfast is a Seattle experience you will not want to miss.  They are very warm and friendly hosts, with great knowledge of the area, and they love to get to know their guests and show them the very charming historical house and the wonderful garden area in the back where one can picnic and enjoy the outside.  The house is full of character, including a real traditional bath.  Oh, and the breakfasts!   Every morning you are treated as a guest to their fruit-and-baked-goods breakfast, complete with tea or coffee.   Since Abil is a nutritionist you are treated to nothing but the best organic ingredients, and the muffins are home baked!   I can't recommend staying at their place enough.

The neighborhood is quiet and residential, but within walking distance to restaurants in First Hill, and just a block or two from bus stops."
2032805,13516443,2014-05-29,15265574,Felycia,"We had the absolute best time staying in Victorian Charm! Melissa and Abil were fantastic hosts, the home was lovely and full of character, and the room was so comfortable! The location a as walking distance to everything on Capitol Hill and we even walked to downtown in less than ten minutes. The hospitality was wonderful including homemade muffins and free beer. We will definitely be returning if and when we make out next trip back to Seattle!  "
2032805,13677681,2014-06-02,8244982,Lisa,"Victorian Charm on Cherry Hill was an extraordinary airbnb experience.  Melissa and Abil are so welcoming.  Their home is just eye candy.  Everywhere something unique, and colorful to enjoy.  The attention to detail that these two lovely women show throughout their home makes this place a must stay.  A colorful, lively experience.  Breakfast is not to be missed.  Yummy.  I can almost smell the blueberry orange muffins! Ahhhh.  Can't wait to return."
2032805,15494381,2014-07-10,14804330,Alisa,"My experience at this property was outstanding.  The establishment is extremely professional.  The property was very clean and offered numerous common areas for relaxing.  The room that I chose was perfect for me.  It shared a common bath but there were options in the event the bath had been occupied (which it never was for me) to use another bath downstairs.  The bed was a dream!  I was visiting my elderly father during the days and always looked forward to a slice of paradise when I returned ""home"".  The neighborhood was good and within walking distance of numerous restaurants as well as being close to downtown Seattle. Each morning when I awoke I smelled the breakfast that they prepared for their guests and while I had to spend breakfast with my father at his senior residence, I was always jealous of the guests that had the opportunity to enjoy it as it looked lovely!  I  highly recommend that anyone looking for a place in Seattle stay here.  I will certainly be back!"
2032805,16017533,2014-07-20,16463737,Ginger,"We had an excellent experience staying in this beautiful Victorian mansion not far from Capital Hill! The bed was comfortable,  room super cute and I loved having a vanity. Melissa and Abil are amazing host and so cool! We even got the pleasure of hanging out with them and having a glass of wine one evening on their lovely patio! We will recommend all our friends to stay with them and I can't wait to visit again.

2032805,16470778,2014-07-28,486603,Jordi,"This has been so far our top one airbnb experience. Melissa and Abil are wounderful hosts and interesting people worth meeting. Thanks to them we've had the chance to discover some sides of Seattle that otherways we wouldn't know, making our staying here something unique and unforgettable. We choose airbnb precisely to find this local touch when travelling, and this time we are far beyond expectations.

The house is very cool too. Tastefully decorated, there are open areas where is easy to relax and interact with other guests. The room was spotless and we haven't any problem sharing the bathroom. Homemade muffins and fresh fruit for breakfast make the difference in the morning.

Summarizing, this has been an unbeatable experience that we would definetelly recommend to anyone going to Seattle. Thanks Melissa and Abil for that.

"
2032805,16725419,2014-08-01,17135754,Sandra,"Melissa and Abil are great hosts, they are very welcoming when we arrived. Abil showed us around the house and ofcourse it was better than the pictures online! Their place was AMAZING :) bathroom was amazing, beds are very very comfy! The house creeks here and there but nothing bothersome at all. These women are AWESOME HOSTS! They are very helpful when recommending attractions and also helped us a lot with our travel needs. My boyfriend definitely enjoyed the free beers! There's a lot of places around the house to wind down and relax after hiking around the hills of seattle. We had a wonderful stay! Thanks again Meliss and Abil! Hopefully, we get to see you both again on the future! "
2032805,17110090,2014-08-07,17870225,Joyce,"Melissa and Abil were terrific hosts.  I was very comfortable with the house, the room, and the setup.  This was my first AirBnb experience and I will definitely do this again.  Its a great location in the city and a wonderful home to get to stay in.  The room was spotless, very comfortable, and beautifully decorated.  The breakfast every morning was fabulous - fresh fruit, coffee/tea, and freshly baked muffins that were absolutely wonderful.  I also did some work while staying here and the downstairs parlor made a charming retreat.  Melissa and Abil are delightful and full of information about Seattle (where to eat, how to get around, things to see/do).  I have spent some time on the road for business travel and while hotels can be useful - staying with Melissa and Abil was like a mini-vacation.  I can recommend them without reservation."
2032805,17286261,2014-08-10,2054742,Marielle,"Really great people and colorful place. Only stayed there for two days, but in this short visit it already felt like a pleasant home. Would definitely recommend it. "
2032805,17644068,2014-08-15,18668450,Tracy,"My stay at Melissa and Abil's place was perfect. Their exquisite house is beautifully decorated in a vintage style. Everything was clean and cozy. Moreover as a vegan, the homemade healthy breakfast really made my day during my visit in Seattle! I would definitely come back again if I will visit Seattle next time!"
2032805,19024298,2014-09-05,7086287,Guillaume,"I'm not sure if I can add anything new to what everyone else here has already said, but just to echo...this is an incredible place to stay! The whole house is beautiful, perfectly situated (near the residential Seattle Uni area, but ideal distance for walking into the city), and Melissa and Abil are a pleasure to stay with. The room was comfortable (especially the bed), clean and homely, and the fresh muffins & fruit breakfasts actually make you look forward to getting up in the morning. Fresh towels and a washer/dryer are great extras (+ a laid-back cat to provide you with added affection).

The hosts are what really make this place though - relaxed, welcoming, kind, funny, and very genuine. They've gone out of their way to make their home perfect for all kinds of guests, and I was able to fill my trip almost entirely using only their recommendations of Seattle. My tip would be to listen to everything Abil tells you about beer (including her free Pike Brewing Company tour), and to eat anything Melissa offers/makes for you! Their knowledge and enthusiasm for the city is clear, and rubs off on you for sure. The atmosphere around the whole house is just great.

I wouldn't think about going anywhere else to stay in Seattle, and already looking forward to heading back some day. Thanks M & A!"

2032805,19477514,2014-09-13,4019547,Jocelyn,"This is really a very inviting, enjoyable stay in Seattle. Rooms are clean, and the house is very whimsical. All guest rooms are on the second floor next to each other. The bed in this room is some of the best sleep I've had in my life.

Melissa and Abil are both very friendly and genuine. So easy to talk with like old friends. (Make sure you check out the Pike Brewery tour. Abil actually gives the tour.) Every morning Melissa comes up with a muffin and serves it with fresh fruit and the caffeinated beverage of your choice. Also, they have beer in the fridge for you to drink!

If you are looking at staying anywhere near downtown, this is still a ""substantial"" drive with traffic. (Walking is faster, haha.) that being said, it's only a few miles from downtown. 

Visiting Seattle, I would stay here again in a heartbeat. The house has got a very welcoming, warm vibe to it that feels good. Thanks for a great stay, ladies! Hopefully see you again."
2032805,19639534,2014-09-15,12196460,Jos,"Melissa and Abil are the most amazing hosts you could ask for. They are really friendly their place is also very cozy and a wonderful, happy feeling when you walk in.
I will be booking here for my next trip to Seattle and looking forward to more free craft beers.
Thanks for having us."
2032805,19785467,2014-09-18,20245174,Bonnie,"This is a wonderful place to stay.  The house and room are exactly as described, clean and beautifully decorated but what made my stay outstanding were the hosts, Melissa and Abil and their assistant, Jenna.   They are warm and welcoming and create a relaxed vibe.  Their love and knowledge of Seattle leads to suggestions that will enhance your visit.  Thanks Melissa, Abil, and Jenna for helping make my visit to Seattle so great."
2032805,20707606,2014-10-04,20868021,Stirling,"Staying in seattle with Melissa and Abel was a wonderful experience. They were so kind, accommodation, and helpful through our stay. The house was amazing and the room was very clean and comfortable with a great view. I highly recommend staying here as I plan to do the same"
2032805,22583223,2014-11-10,21155572,Ville,"It's pure perfection. We were welcomed with open arms and
showered with attention when appropriate. Everything was clean
and there was loads of room to hang out in. Our friend became
seriously ill and they helped take care of him and schedule a
doctor's appointment. The hosts were accommodating and flexible
with everything. A best stay anywhere ever, I recommend it to
anyone going to Seattle."
2032805,24311383,2014-12-25,24613026,鹏,"The hosts, Abil and Mellissa, are very kind and warm heart! As we are first time come to Seattle, both of them gave me precious advices. The rooms are great, nice decorated and clean. And it's quiet as well. Very morning we ate breakfirst which cooked by Mellissa, delicious and sufficient. By the way, Abil's beers are owesome!! I miss it too much! At last, we would like to give our sinere appreciation to both Abil and Mellissa. The experience stayed in your house was wonderful, thank you and best wishes to you!"
2032805,27188772,2015-02-27,28194103,Larry,"This place was amazing!Comfortable, clean & welcoming.  I highly recommend staying with Melissa and Able.  They were wonderful, gracious hosts.  Honored to have met them.  Made me feel right at home.  I look forward to returning for sure!"
2032805,31061397,2015-05-01,30992731,Matthew,"Melissa, Abil, and Courtney are absolutely incredible hosts. They gave us great recommendations, delicious homemade muffins every morning, and they made us feel right at home. The location is a pleasant walk from a lot of great places, you really couldn't get any better than this place for a stay in Seattle. A friendly, warm, good time in a cozy, supremely decorated home."
2032805,32905462,2015-05-23,12038469,Simon,"Great location, and a very warm welcome. Easy to walk to Pike Place, the piers, local parks, and some awesome cafes / bars. Melissa and Abil go out of their way to offer recommendations and make you feel at home. Breakfast each morning was a real treat. Definitely have fond memories - hope we're back some day!"
2032805,33611071,2015-05-30,29053443,John,"I can't emphasise enough what a great thing Melissa and Abil have created with Bed, Baked and Beyond. The house itself is full of kitschy, creative character, each room decorated according to a loose theme with cool little trinkets and knick-knacks strewn about the place. KEXP radio is pumped through the house all day. It's the complete opposite to a sterile boring Holiday Inn, an actual home run by two geniune, friendly people. Melissa and Abil's knowledge of Seattle is encyclopaedic and Melissa's home made muffins baked fresh every morning were excellent. Ask Abil about the breweries Seattle has to offer. A large part of what made my time in Seattle so good was down to these two and their awesome house. A ton of bars, shops and restaurants of various styles are within walking distance and a downtown bus stop is just a block or two away."
2032805,34432505,2015-06-08,31550040,Peter,"Authentic Victorian house, overgrown with flowers and greenery, in a pleasant residential neighborhood. Beautifully decorated and furnished in a funky, original, yet warm style. 

1/2 hour's walk or 15 min by bus from downtown Seattle.

Melissa and Abil were awesome! Very professional and polished (they have been doing this for a while), yet also open and very friendly. They gave us great advice and made us feel so at home that we didn't want to leave.

2032805,34785776,2015-06-12,32286523,Benjamin,"My girlfriend Kelly and I cannot say enough good things about Melissa and Abil. They are such amazing host and the guest house is awesome! The continental breakfast is awesome and Melissa is very accommodating if you need gluten free options for the muffins. Both Melissa and Abil are very knowledgable about the city and have no problem pointing you in the right direction for a good coffee shoppe or restaurant. If you are taking a trip to Seattle, seriously consider staying here. Kelly and I will, without a doubt being staying here again on our next trip to Seattle. Oh and make sure you take the tour at Pike brewery lead by Abil! "
2032805,35411890,2015-06-18,34664525,Gemma,"My sister and I spent two nights here, and completely loved it! The house is beautiful, in a great location, and very well kept. Melissa, Abil and Courtney were absolutely fantastic hosts, very friendly and welcoming with some great recommendations for stuff to eat/drink/do nearby. Melissa even went to the trouble of making vegan muffins for my sisters breakfast, which was a really nice touch (and totally unexpected!). I would recommend staying here to anyone, and would gladly stay again if I find myself back in Seattle!"
2032805,35595569,2015-06-20,30551253,Jason,"Hosts made us feel really welcome. We enjoyed the area, very close to shops and other areas of interest. The baked goods and breakfast every morning were phenomenal. Class act all around: good people, good time, great room, reasonable rate, awesome place, knowledgeable and amazing hosts.

I'll never stay at a hotel again for the rest of my life... unless Melissa and Abil are running it."
2032805,36087634,2015-06-25,29773030,Marko,"Melissa and Abil are the greatest hosts ever. They made our stay perfect by making us feel comfortable in a natural and forthcoming way. They even lent us some stuff for our upcoming camping tour, which we were totally unprepared for. The place is absolutely lovely, Melissa's muffins legendary and Abil's knowledge about beer infinite. We would definitely recommend their place to everybody visiting Seattle. Thanks a million for letting us stay!"
2032805,36961995,2015-07-03,33397577,Allison,"When we arrived Melissa and Abil were both very welcoming and showed us around the house as well as gave us a list of fun things to do in the city. We enjoyed our time spent there and enjoyed their company. The house was better than we could of ever imagined, bright & cheery, and in incredibly well kept and clean. We couldn't of asked for a better place to spend our honeymoon."
2032805,37532147,2015-07-07,36988792,Tibor,This charming Victorian was the ideal place from which to experience all Seattle has to offer. Our hosts gave us a grand tour of their historic home and made us feel comfortable from the moment of our arrival- making sure to provide info on restaurants and other cool neighborhood sights. Breakfast was awesome!
2032805,37772757,2015-07-10,35814238,Ryan,First airbnb experience was amazing! Abil and Melissa were super welcoming and helpful and the house was great. P.s. Their muffins are the best 
2032805,38451385,2015-07-15,10138453,Jonathan,"Awesome experience. Nice room, friendly and flexible hosts, lovely back yard with wifi. "
2032805,39292319,2015-07-22,3717209,Monica,"Melissa and Abil were very friendly and kind host. I was travailing by self and they made me feel very welcomed and helped me with my travel arrangements. The breakfast was wonderful! The place was clean, tidy and the location was very accessible to everything. I'd definitely recommend this place to other people. It was a pleasure to meet them.
Best, 
Susana "
2032805,39736432,2015-07-26,13192582,Amy,"We absolutely loved staying in this place. The house is so beautiful and inviting, comfortable beds and awesome location! We walked almost everywhere we needed to go, and whatever we needed was just a quick jaunt away. Melissa, Abel and Courtney were terrific hosts. The continental breakfast they made every morning was fantastic, whatever we needed was taken care of right away and really we just had fun getting to know them! We will definitely stay here whenever we make it back to Seattle. Thanks for a great weekend, ladies!! "
2032805,42824338,2015-08-16,30607387,Tobias,This is the most wonderful place! I felt at home and on vacation at the same time. All the rooms are lovely and so are Melissa and Abil (and Courtney who gave me warm welcome). Downtown easy to reach with public transport. The breakfast muffins are delicious and Abil gives a great brewery tour downtown you should not miss. It was also a pleasure to hang out with the other guests. I wish I could have stayed longer/forever.    
2032805,43370796,2015-08-19,35730636,Garrett,"Fantastic, friendly, and extremely helpful hosts. Highly recommended! Delicious muffins in the morning, awesome place to stay, tons of advice for things to do in the Seattle area, and the potting shed is a great hangout spot."
2032805,44151695,2015-08-24,36228229,Robert,"After reading many reviews lauding these three ladies, I was prepared for a unique establishment. But let me tell you, I was still unprepared for the entirety of the experience of being welcomed into their home, and into their lives. Almost immediately I felt that I was participating as a member of their household, which as a solo traveler is a priceless commodity. I noticed that some of their other guests took little advantage of the social aspects of a true bed-and-breakfast and utilized their room as if they were in a motel, what a shame. The house, which is a grand old Victorian, is beautifully decorated and furnished in period pieces. Everything is scrupulously clean and well attended to, each and every day. Melissa bakes a different muffin each morning inspired by what fresh fruits/nuts/grains are available locally and I can’t remember when I’ve had better. Abil was a font of advice of where to go and what to see.All of my days were capped off with conversations with the hosts or other guests, getting advice for more activities and places to see, and of course hanging out in the potting shed to sample some of the beer Abil brings home from Pike brewing. Did I forget to mention El Gatto? Well you’ll have to visit to meet him. Let’s not forget Courtney, who’s knowledge and help with the local transit made my travel within Seattle so much easier. Well just in case it’s not obvious, I really enjoyed my stay here and hope to visit again!
"
2032805,44506118,2015-08-26,27748965,Cecilia And Bryan,"Melissa and Abil were warm and kind hosts.  Their home was beautiful as well as comfortable, and the fruit plates were delicious!  The level of hospitality exceeded all expectations. "
2032805,45424144,2015-09-02,42013068,Kevin,"Honestly couldn't have asked for better/more gracious/funnier/more welcoming hosts. Love, love, LOVE the two wifes and their assistant. End of story. Don't even think twice about staying with them!
(the infamous breakfast-muffin should have got enough ""news-coverage"" by now. So I'm just gonna go on record and say that if you get the chance to try anything that came out of their lovely little kitchen you should jump on it..no question about it!)"
2032805,45944898,2015-09-07,36003195,Nicholas,"We were welcomed by an offer of free local beer. We went on a tour of the brewery but were sad to miss Abil as the tour guide. Courtney and Abil both gave us many great suggestions of all the great places to eat for dinner, so many in walking distance."
2032805,46592760,2015-09-12,37718477,Cassandra,"This was our first experience with AirBnB and Melissa, Abil, and Courtney set the bar astronomically high. We adored our room, the company of our hosts and fellow travelers, and especially the delicious breakfast served every morning. We cannot say enough good things about this place (or at least not as eloquently as our Cherry Hill “home away from home” deserves)! If we find ourselves in Seattle again, we can’t imagine any other lodging option that could compete with Melissa and Abil’s hospitality. Look no further, reader, for you’ve just found your next BnB!
"
2032805,46960936,2015-09-14,42847833,Nelie,Melissa and Abil are wonderful hosts. Appreciated Abil's suggestions re bars and restaurants. Loved the house and its location. 
2032805,47358343,2015-09-18,38506269,Ken,What a delightful way to be introduced to the AirBnB experience! Melissa and Abil were lovely hosts. Room was exactly as described and the house was a treasure but most remarkable for the warm hospitality shown by our hosts. 
2032805,49433678,2015-10-04,38288794,Robert,"This was my first trip to the west coast and my 50th birthday to boot and I could not have asked for a more perfect place to spend it. Upon our late arrival our hosts were friendly and inviting. They gave us a quick tour as they knew we were tired, showed us the facilities and our room where we promptly retired. The next morning we were greeted with a fantastic cup of coffee, fruit plate and muffins. After our breakfast they gave us a more thorough tour of the place and it was just lovely, right down to the fresh flowers. We then took a walk in the neighborhood, which was nice and very easy to learn. I would highly recommend Bed, Baked and Beyond for anyone looking for an affordable and hospitable place to stay. Melissa, Abil and Courtney are the BEST!"
2032805,50941915,2015-10-16,43272035,Taly,"Melissa and Abil were AMAZING! From the get go they made me feel at home and welcomed. Their standard of cleanliness is bar-none. They share their home, which they made into a lovely boutique b&b, wholeheartedly and I will truly miss the bed in the Victorian room. The fresh fruit and homemade baked goods are superb! If I should happen to pass by Seattle again I would definitely stay here!"
2032805,52601336,2015-10-31,15200039,Mark,"I spent one week at Melissa and Abil's beautiful home, and they are simply the best of what one could hope for in an Airbnb host. Melissa, Abil, and Courtney made me feel comfortable from the moment I arrived. They put so much thought and care into every detail of their home and into the comfort of their guests. The room was very clean. The bed, also known as ""the cloud,"" was a great comfort after my workdays. The house is nearby a bunch of great bars and restaurants.

Every morning Melissa prepared some delicious baked goods. Throughout my stay Abil generously shared her knowledge (as well as her stash) of delicious local beers. They paid so much attention to my preferences. Little things like noticing what beer I liked, what coffee I enjoyed, what sections of the newspaper I might be interested in reading. These little touches really topped off an already great experience. They were also fantastic conversationists. I looked forward to our wide-ranging chats over breakfast or in the evening. They also did all of this while being incredibly respectful of my privacy. 

I was in Seattle to do work, and what I really was hoping for was a relaxing place to stay with friendly people. Melissa and Abil went well beyond my expectations. They were just so warm and they welcomed me into their home as if I was an old friend. I cannot wait to stay with them the next time I return to Seattle. "
2032805,54230068,2015-11-17,16674647,Zenyth,"Best hosts ever + best house ever = best time ever! Abil and Melissa are the sweetest gals around, paired with their lovely and helpful assistant, Courtney and the gorgeous old house, it's essentially heaven. Fresh fruit with homemade muffins in the morning and the potting shed were my two favorite bonuses of staying here. Abil, Melissa, and Courtney have impeccable taste and can recommend excellent restaurants, beers, vintage, music, burlesque, shops, nature or anything you could ask! Check out their library if you have some downtime. If you hate cats, they stay out of the way and you'll barely see them. If you love cats, Perla is evasive but El Gato will soak up your pets and scratches like a big, adorable, sleepy cat-sponge. Bed, baked, and beyond is so wonderful, I can't wait to find another reason to visit Seattle again!"
6578147,36490986,2015-06-28,36738216,Jessica,"I felt very welcome!  Kim & her roomies made me feel like I was part of the family, while still giving me my privacy.  The RV is a custom conversion, very high quality craftsmanship and materials.  It was parked literally on Alki beach, which is full of great restaurants, bars, and people watching.  The house was close - just up the alley for shower, toilet, and full kitchen (there is a little stove and refrigerator on board).  There was always a breeze coming off the water, so it never got too hot.  Public transportation is nearby - I was able to take a foot ferry across the bay to the Seattle waterfront, then onto another ferry and out to an Island that had a delightful touristy area walking distance from the ferry dock.  Nice little day trip.  Also, a little historical note, the house is the first house built in Seattle.  That doesn't necessarily make it very old, but it is an interesting fact.
"
6578147,41995279,2015-08-10,37078079,Todd,"This was quite an experience...Kim and her house mates were so willing to accept and help us...
The RV was much like advertised.
It's a block from Alki beach.  A beautiful view of the bay from there.  Many restaurants and coffee shops are only a few blocks walk down the beach...the ferry to downtown Seattle is also about a mile from the RV. 
All very convenient things when visiting...

6587443,47821615,2015-09-21,33139029,Christian,"Great host, super communicative and accommodating. Both Jeanie and David were great people and Tanny was a great dog. Would recommend this place to anyone. "
6587443,51219558,2015-10-18,26320215,Amber,"Jennie was such a great host! The space is clean, homey and just as described. We had to check in a bit later and notified her ahead of time and she was very accommodating. Great/safe area with plenty of parking, etc. Would highly recommend! "
6587443,51848449,2015-10-24,2405764,Dianne,"Jennie's Guest Suite is a cheery and comfortable space in a quiet Seattle neighborhood.  The suite was impeccably clean and the furnishings and decor appear to be new.  Having a private entrance was nice because we were out late and night, and did not worry about disturbing anyone as we returned.  We hope to stay here again on our next visit to Seattle."
6587443,53767326,2015-11-12,44876937,Bigky,David was very helpful and accommodating in every aspect of our stay. The home is beautiful and is walking distance from everywhere(if you don't mind long walks of course 2 miles) 
1980283,16144168,2014-07-22,17743150,Kate,"Conni was very pleasant and welcoming.  The basement was comfortable and so were the beds/couch. We liked having our own entrance, so we didn't feel like we were disturbing anyone if we got in late. The neighborhood felt safe, and the bus stop immediately outside the gate was very convenient.  "
1980283,16423765,2014-07-27,2206985,Bo,Conni & Stew were amazing hosts. They were unable to be there when we checked in but accommodated us and even text to make sure we got in ok and have us suggestions for dinner! The basement apartment is cozy and comfortable with all the amenities you could want. They provided a continental breakfast and even some local beer in the fridge. Will definitely stay with them again next time we are in Seattle. 
1980283,16850760,2014-08-03,3430626,Susanne,"Staying w/Conni, Stew & Finn was a great start to our West Coast Anniversary Adventure! Their cute bungalow was exactly as described and oh, so clean & tidy! The bedroom was ideal for sleeping--comfortable bed, great linens, & dark with direct access to the 3/4 bath.  While it was just the 2 of us, the 2nd bedroom came in handy as a dressing/luggage area. We were very thankful for the use of their laundry facilities as our luggage had a mishap in transit. (Not that one wants to do laundry to kick off a vaca, but it was indispensable!) Having a local craft beer in the fridge was an added touch my husband appreciated. We also made use of their wifi and appreciated their restaurant suggestions. 

Their West Seattle location was right on the 21 bus line making it both out of the way (quiet!) AND convenient to all downtown Seattle offers. While we didn't spend much time in West Seattle, we did discover a local late night brew pub that had great burgers (and gluten free buns!)  

We had great communication right off the bat, and throughout our booking & stay. We highly recommend staying with Conni & Stew and wouldn't hesitate to rebook their place should we find ourselves en route to Seattle again. :)"
1980283,17127162,2014-08-07,17480559,Binta,"We had an amazing stay with Conni & Stew. Their basement apartment was exactly as described. The space was bright, open, and quiet. The location was great with a bus straight to downtown Seattle right out front.  They were incredibly friendly and welcoming.  They gave us a list of wonderful restaurants to try that were amazing.  The beach is  5 minute drive or less than 10 minutes by bus.  We loved the location because we were able to explore so much more than the tourist spots downton. We would absolutely recommend Stew & Conni and their space to anyone looking to stay in Seattle!"
1980283,17366185,2014-08-11,4050874,Paige,"I'm a wedding photographer and flew in to Seattle with my husband to shoot a wedding. The venue was located near Conni & Stew's house, so it was perfect. The description and photos were accurate, Connie responded very quickly to all of my emails and texts. She accommodated a late arrival and there were cold beers in the fridge, along with some other beverages and snacks :-)

Their house is located just a few blocks away from California Ave in West Seattle which has some really cute coffee shops, cafes and dinner spots and it was also just a quick drive into downtown - which conveniently allowed us to fully jump into ""tourist"" mode the Friday before the wedding ;-)

I would totally stay here again!"
1980283,17651727,2014-08-15,18679627,Richard,"I wanted a clean and comfortable place for my mom and niece to stay while visiting Seattle. Conni  Stew's place was perfect, it was clean and comfy. They were both very nice and hospitable. I would recommended their place to anyone traveling to Seattle.

1980283,18012466,2014-08-20,10545070,Josh-Liz,Connie and Stew were great hosts and made sure that we were comfortable with the space.  The neighborhood is awesome.  We used the public transportation to save money and it took less sometimes to get down there with the bus.  Great Place in Seattle!  Liz and I stayed on the air mattress and her parents used the other room.  The air mattress was comfy!  They even left us a couple of local brews in the fridge.  Thanks Guys for Everything!
1980283,18426434,2014-08-26,3151098,Vanessa,"Conni and Stew were amazing hosts. They were accommodating in our arrival times and accessing the space as well as storing our suit cases before leaving on our last day. We were greeted by local brew, tips on the city, and an amazing space. The locale is a quick drive to downtown, and the neighborhood is charming. Thank you Conni and Stew!"
1980283,18887367,2014-09-02,736093,Bernard,"Ok anybody who leaves me beer and fruit in the morning( for the hangover of course) is awesome in my book. The photos are very accurate of the property. Also the fact that both bedrooms are on opposite sides of the space was great also. For those people who love the boob tube there is not one in the apartment, but wifi works very very well. This is a great place for people to use if they need to get to downtown. The bus picks you up on their front lawn and takes you into downtown in 15 min. Connie and Stew were awesome and i would not mind crashing at their house again! We used it for the PAX expo and it worked out perfectly! So what are you waiting for use this place!"
1980283,19267951,2014-09-09,2733676,Stephanie,"Jed's parents had a great stay here during our wedding, and liked the location. The place was very clean & welcoming. Only challenge was that 3 people stayed there, and the only sink was located in the bathroom, so it could be difficult to do dishes, etc. All in all, a nice place & they said they'd come back!"
1980283,19696956,2014-09-16,20579374,Hannah,Conni and Stew were incredibly nice and accommodating. I really appreciated their flexibility.

Connie welcomed us to the place and helped us settle down, with breakfast, fruits and local beers. The place is wonderful, convenient drive to anywhere. It is very quiet neighborhood and we had great sleep at nights. Connie is a great host, although we didn't have time talk much, but everything we need is very well prepared in the house and we can use right away. It is definitely better than staying in a hotel. Highly recommend."
1980283,21437995,2014-10-17,22058876,Anthony,"This was my first time with AirBnB and Conni and Stew made it a wonderful experience. The house was comfortable, they gave us excellent food and sightseeing recommendations, and really made us feel at home. :)"

The location is great too! This place isn't too far from downtown Seattle and other local attractions and it was close to all the organizations we needed to meet with.

It's a little colder in December and it would be nice if the basement could be a bit warmer throughout the night. They did give us a space heater and that was really helpful but a second one would be nice in case both bedrooms are being used.

Overall a definite recommendation. Having bedrooms, a bathroom, laundry machines, and a mini fridge for a good price definitely beats out any hotels. 

Thanks for hosting us!

1980283,24106178,2014-12-20,23046563,Roberta,"Our Host was awesome we were a little lost it was after dark, and he ran out to his porch and waved us down.  Stew had great energy,  carried in our luggage in the rain, and gave a great explanation of the room as well as the surrounding area.
The neighborhood was peaceful and safe, very clean, (just like our B & B) and was only 2.5 miles from my daughter and even closer to area shopping centers.  We had a view of the water when getting to our car.  We had NO problems with parking.  I would highly recommend Connie and Stew.  Everything was as stated on their ad.  "

Connie and Stew had stocked the refrigerator with milk, butter and bread. Coffee and condiments were supplied. When I arrived, a nice bowl of fruit and a bottle of wine was waiting. Stew also helped me carry my luggage. The location is very convenient for getting to ferries and Seattle. I will definitely stay again."

We had a wonderful time there, and what made it especially relaxing and memorable was being able to stay at Conni and Stew's place.  Their basement space was very private and had everything we needed.  It felt very homey and our little 1 year old walker had a great time roaming around the area.  Our daughter also fell in love with Conni and Stew's dog and kept wanting to see the dog!  This place is in a great location!  Easy to get to downtown and other main attractions in Seattle.  Would totally stay again if we take another trip up.  Thanks again Conni and Stew! "

1980283,35211895,2015-06-16,7903859,Kelly,"We loved our stay at Conni and Stew's! Their place was just as they described. The location was great. They live in a super cute neighborhood with lots to offer has far as good food, trails/nature, and things to do and when we wanted to go explore other areas of the city we just walked out the front door and were able to catch the bus. We tried many of their recommendations and loved them. We also loved being able to make coffee and have breakfast at the apartment. They provided coffee and some light breakfast items which was really nice. We highly recommend staying here and would definitely stay there again when we're back in Seattle."

It had everything we needed including access to a washer and dryer which was critical during our trip since we packed light.

The apartment was quite spacious--the ceiling is very low in places so anyone of above average height must be cautious but it's easy to get used to.  The hosts provided coffee, fruit, a couple of beers (thanks!) and some breakfast foods so we didn't have to shop when we arrived.  Street parking is plentiful and the drive to downtown is easy.  We hope to be able to stay again!  "

However, I'm grateful having to meet the helpful host and staying at the quiet creek house which made me feel more relax than at home. I'd wonderful and unexpected experience with Carol who is very informative and amiable as a great friend too.

Being a foreigner, I find a bit difficult to find the place at start but was manageable after a day. Besides enjoying the short walk for QFC and public commuters, I find not much hassle getting daily basic needs or to downtown.

I'm grateful to meet Carol who also shares similar arts interest. It was totally an unforgetable and  great stay. I'm certain many besides enjoy sharing any arts interest or would also appreciate Carol's bright personality and company too. ^^ "

The place is very quiet as are the other guests.  Business kept me out late at dinners and functions, so I was sure to try and remain as quiet as I could to not disturb the other guests.  It is so quiet that you could hear my footsteps. :)  This made getting to sleep very easy and very relaxing.  

Carol herself is very nice and was very accommodating and even showed me where i could find more information on the Seattle area for my day off to go adventuring :)

Thanks again!"

I'm really glad that she gave free reign of her kitchen which was a bonus for me because I prefer to cook. I'm also very happy she pointed me in the direction of the local pool.

The place is near to bus stops, cafes and grocery store. I had a great time there!

Her space is  clean and comfortable.  Best of all (besides BB herself) is that it is very quiet and peaceful.  I had a lot of work on my plate, both times I stayed there.  I was able to relax and focus without any difficulty.  Also, the other houseguests have been very interesting and accommodating as well.  Thanks BB"

I could walk or bike to the nearby QFC, as well as get to the beach on Lake Washington and Burke Gilman Trail. The room itself was comfortable with a lovely view of the garden. The kitchen had all the basic amenities that I could have asked for and it wasn't long before I started to cook up a storm! Besides the place itself, I especially enjoyed the company of the other guests. Without Carol opening her place up, I wouldn't have had the opportunity to meet such caring, thoughtful, and interesting people--including Carol herself! She was very accommodating and helpful. "

Ann made check-in very easy, responded quickly to any questions we had, and was happy to give us suggestions of things to do in the area. She also provided snacks upon arrival and even made a wonderful breakfast one morning. Beyond Ann's hospitality the basement apartment was very comfortable and nicely decorated. The sleeping accommodations were great and the living room and dining areas were great places for relaxing and hanging out. Parking outside of the house was very convenient and it was only a short drive into the city. 

I would definitely stay here again and I would recommend it to anyone else looking for a nice place to stay while in Seattle."

Our friends stayed in the bed and Ann provided my husband and I with a comfy air mattress and blankets. The location is close enough to Seattle that traveling is easy and far enough to have a quiet relaxing nights sleep with easy street parking! Checking in and out was effortless and Ann provided my group with snacks, such a charming place I would definitely return. "
4824581,28839071,2015-03-30,28986845,Chaitanya,"This place is a perfect and an ideal stay for a group of 4. The studio is well equipped with all the necessary amenities. The bedroom is good enough to accommodate 2 people and comfy airbeds were provided for the other 2. The living room is beautifully decorated and so is the dining area. These two places are absolutely fabulous for hanging out and relaxing after a tired day in the city. The kitchen is well equipped with all kinds of facilities like coffee machines, microwave, toaster, etc as well as utensils, plates and bowls, glasses, cups and what not. Everything that you need is just available here !! 

The location is  close enough to Seattle downtown and is at a very quiet and peaceful residential neighborhood. This makes it an awesome place to relax since you are away from all the city rush. There is a bus stop right at the corner about 1-2 blocks away from the house and the bus frequency to downtown is pretty good. We didn't have a car so we used the bus and Uber to get around. Uber is also easily available in this neighborhood.

Moreover, check-in/check-out was very smooth and painless. Ann had made all the arrangements beforehand and kept the apartment ready. She is an amazing person and responded very quickly to any questions we had and was also very helpful if we needed any suggestions to get around Seattle. She had kept all the necessary Seattle tourist info guides on the coffee table which was really cool and we could easily find all the information that we needed about Seattle. Also, Ann provided us with delicious snacks on the day we checked in. It was such a warm welcome and the hospitality provided was simply amazing !! 

Overall the place is absolutely fabulous. Its in a very peaceful location which allows you for a perfect relaxation after a tired and hectic day in the city. All the arrangements are wonderful and the hospitality is great. I would definitely stay here when I'm in Seattle again and would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a nice, peaceful stay in Seattle. "

She answered all our questions in a timely manner and she gave us many useful tips and suggestions during our trip. The neighborhood is very safe and about 15-30 minutes away from tourist spots depending on where you are going. The place is very cozy and comfortable. Ann accommodated all our needs and more! If I ever go back to Seattle again, I would definitely love to stay at this place!"
4824581,33381111,2015-05-27,31376430,Justine,"Ann's place was just what we needed for a weekend getaway and not too far from downtown Seattle. Ann was a wonderful host, always quick to respond if we had any questions. The place was clean and perfect for a small group of 4-5. They had plenty of towels and even provided coffee, water, and pastries  going above and beyond our expectations. This place was everything we were looking for during our visit to Seattle. We would definitely stay here again."
4824581,34345901,2015-06-07,24578635,Angela,"This space was perfect for me and my 3 friends. We had more than enough space to relax. There is ample street parking so we never had to worry about getting back at a certain time to find a spot. Ann provided all the essentials (shampoo, soap, qtips, towels, hair dryer, plates, utensils, cups) and even provided some unexpected extras that made our time here great! For example, the generous amount of Hi-Chews in the room, the Danish pastries in the fridge; as well as water bottles, cranberry juice, and wings and bread in the freezer. 

We were mainly in this space to sleep and relax and the Netflix and huge selection of movies made it possible. Both the bed and air mattress were very comfortable and the bathroom was well stocked. 

Her 2 dogs seemed very well behaved. They were never downstairs with us but we only heard them bark once or twice when we would come back at the end of the day, but never any excessive barking. We did get the chance to see the dogs when we were checking out and she was super friendly. We also met Sharon briefly during check-out and she was friendly as well. It was easy to communicate with them through Airbnb and texting whenever we had questions or needed recommendations for food and such. 

A little side note for future stayers, the claw tub is amazing but if you are taller than 5'7"" you might have some difficulty showering (the ceiling is closer than you'd think). We would definitely stay here next time we come up to town! "
4824581,34750913,2015-06-11,25885344,David,"Anna and Sharon were lovely and they provided us with an exemplary Airbnb experience. The basement suite was huge, beautifully furnished and had everything we could possibly need. They welcomed us with some pastries and juice for breakfast. They left us to our devices but it was really nice to meet and have a chat with Anna and Sharon and to get some ideas about what we would like to see in Seattle/Washington. 

Communication was great, Anna was very quick to reply from her phone and it made everything a breeze."

Place was stylish, spacious and well thought-out.  Neighborhood was very convenient for our needs.  Would definitely recommend it to family visiting in the future."
4824581,36523875,2015-06-29,8917747,Chris,"The space was perfect for us. We had 4 people visiting Seattle for the weekend and Ann could not have been more accommodating. She was very easy to communicate with, and we had no problem coming and going as we pleased. She also provided some pretty clutch snacks that helped us survive the trip. 

Only negative about the 'Mod Pod' is the shower height is a little snug. I'm 6'2"" and it was hard not to hit my head on the ceiling. Other than that, could not have asked for a better experience. "
4824581,36710589,2015-06-30,30793778,Devin,"I'm searching for the right word to describe my stay. I'll have to go with...PERFECT! The photos and description did a great job describing the suite, so nothing surprised me when I got there. Little notes around the house helped explain things (like how to use the espresso machine) and made us all feel more at home. I ran into Ann on my way out the door and she welcomed us and asked if we needed any suggestions for places to go around Seattle. Overall, we couldn't have ended up with a better place to stay.

The only tiny little complaint I'll make was about the shower/bath, which us on a raised platform. This causes people of my height (a little over 6 foot) to have to bend down while showering, to avoid hitting the low ceiling above. Not too big of a deal at all, as one could simply take a bath instead or bend over for a few minutes.

Thanks for the lovely stay, Ann! :)"

It was only a short drive to downtown Seattle so it worked out perfectly. Ann was so thoughtful and payed attention to every detail in determining what to provide guests. We had everything we would need as if it were our own house making it comforting to know that if you forgot to pack something, you could find it at Ann's. We had muffins in the fridge, water, little snack bowls everywhere, fancy coffee pods, laundry soap, first aid kit, lots of bathroom toiletries, internet and TV so we could watch Shark Week :), etc. This was our first time using Airbnb and we were blown away with how awesome it was. I don't know how future stays will be able to live up to our stay at Ann's!"
4824581,38114412,2015-07-13,11262887,Hope,"We had such a great experience staying with Ann! The place was so nice and she provided us with water, fruit and coffee! We adored this place and would definitely recommend anyone to stay with Ann. One of my favorite airbnbs I have yet to stay in!!"
4824581,38606556,2015-07-17,31885035,Doriana,"My friends and I came up to Seattle for a concert and our stay with Ann couldn't have been better! We had everything we needed, and more. It was an easy bus ride or uber to and from the downtown area but we would have been content just hanging out in the mod pod!"
4824581,39302518,2015-07-22,36244481,David,"Ann and her basement were great! It was super clean and very well kept. It's a completely separate space with an entrance through the back of the house. There's a nice lit path leading back to the door. The bed was comfortable and there's a kitchen with lots of appliances. Ann left muffins and oatmeal for breakfast for us and bottles of water in the fridge. There's a nice size TV with basic channels and access to Ann's Netflix and Hulu. Also we had access to her high speed WiFi. It was pretty warm in Seattle while we were there but the room never got too warm thanks to a fan. The only issue is the shower, it's a nice old cast-iron tub that is raised so high off the ground that most people will have trouble standing up fully without hitting the ceiling. The shortest member of our party was 5'8"" and they couldn't stand up fully. There is a shower chair that you can sit on which makes the experience better! The step to get into the tub may be difficult for people with disabilities.
This was my first Airbnb stay and because of Ann's hospitality and pleasant basement, I will definitely be using the service again."
4824581,39505510,2015-07-24,21937741,Tim,"Sweet space! Awesome decor, two beds with some privacy, provided everything needed (including snacks, coffee, toothbrushes, lots of towels...) and the bathroom had an old style claw tub- good touch! Large couch good for lounging and lots of magazines and papers to read. You have to take an uber to get around if you don't have a car, but for the price of the airbnb it's worth it. Thank you! "
4824581,39746134,2015-07-26,31838691,Gigi,"Felt very welcome & amenities (food, internet, towels, etc) were great! Place was really clean & well-kept too."
4824581,41264961,2015-08-05,38421222,John,"Ann's house is spacious and well-equipped. There is an easy bus connection to downtown Seattle. Ann communicated clearly and made my dad, son and I feel very welcome our whole stay. The lodging was private, clean and the full kitchen had all we needed ."
4824581,42856559,2015-08-16,14383565,Victor,"Ann's Basement Suite absolutely blew my three friends and I away. Checking in was no problem at all! Ann had already prepared everything for my friends and I and even left us muffins, oatmeal and water bottles. That alone goes to show how much Ann cares for her guests. During our 4 night stay we never had any problems and had a very comfortable/relaxing stay. During our stay, I had to print and sign some documents for back home. Ann and Sharon were more than accommodating to my problem. They also gave us suggestions to popular attractions in the city and even helped us for our trip to Vancouver. During our time there, we had a chance to meet Ann's two dogs, whom were very friendly and did not bother us at all. Overall, our expectations were blown away and we are very thankful for Ann to have hosted us. Will definitely stay here again next time we are in Seattle!"
4824581,43442267,2015-08-19,41124559,Marcie,Darling suite! Ann was so nice answered all my questions and was so user friendly! she even left snacks! the space was amazing and comfortable! I would go back in a second! thanks for everything! 
4824581,43777281,2015-08-22,36483614,Maggie,Great place in a quiet neighborhood. Although I never met Ann in person she was awesome with directions and suggestions for places to eat and hang out. The space itself was super comfy for four of us to call home base during our stay! 
4824581,44371741,2015-08-25,41676507,Parker,"Our time at the Mod Pod was great. It was a clean, stylish, and functional retreat from the  bustle of downtown Seattle. We had a rental car and there was plenty of parking on a safe street; it took about 10 minutes without traffic to get downtown and about 15-20 with traffic. We enjoyed the amenities, including having access to the washer and dryer. There is access from the main levels of the house into the basement, however it was extremely private and we had the level to ourselves. We'd definitely stay again. "
4824581,45097322,2015-08-31,37450904,Christal,"The hospitality offered was amazing! Not only is the Mod Pod just as gorgeous as it looks in the photos, but there were bagels and muffins, a range of coffees and teas, and even two (count 'em, two!) bowls of chocolate mints. There was an ample supply of towels, toothbrushes and other toiletries, as well as helpful notes and signs throughout the space such as remote instructions for the TV and various devices.

The place is so cozy and welcoming, my fellow guests and I settled in right away, which is exactly what you want after a busy day of travel. The place was very comfortable for the 4 of us. 

Ann was very responsive to all of my inquiries all the way through the process, and sent us a welcome message along with instructions for retrieving the keys the morning of our check-in. 

Overall, we a great experience, I'd reserve this space again in a heartbeat!"
4824581,45632731,2015-09-04,22017482,Ashley,"We felt extremely welcome at Ann's house! It was very comfortable and designed well. She had everything we could have possibly needed, she even brought us down a whole bowl of fresh plums from her mothers garden! The space was really spectacular and the beds and couch were really comfortable. I had a great stay and would stay there again in a heartbeat. The location was also very convenient for downtown, west seattle and south seattle areas. Also, I brought my parents and this was their first AirBnB stay and they loved it and felt completely at home. Overall this was one of my favorite places to stay and is the number one when considering all of the extras that were left for us to enjoy. Thanks for everything!! ^_^"
4824581,46127314,2015-09-08,22587084,Erika,"The Mod Pod was perfect for our quick stay in Seattle. It was very spacious, inviting and decorated amazingly with fun personal touches. It was incredibly comfortable with a nice couch and TV with movies and Netflix. Ann was nice enough to be incredibly flexible with us so we could drop our bags early and stay later since we had an evening flight (we got lucky that no one was booked right after us). Ann had breakfast foods, snacks, coffee and tea which made our visit even more relaxing. She also left notes around the place with directions or information which was helpful. You do somewhat share an entrance with Ann so at times I did worry we were too loud when entering and exiting the basement; however privacy was never an issue. Downtown was maybe 15- 20 minutes away and it was very easy to use Uber to and from the Mod Pod. I would recommend this airbnb highly!"
4824581,46989163,2015-09-14,2266096,Giulia,"Ann is a wonderful host, extremely helpful and kind. The Mod Pod is lovely furnished and fully equipped. We had a wonderful stay."

7396707,42498911,2015-08-13,33519864,Neil,"Had a wonderful time, Wallace was such a nice host which made our stay amazing. The place is in a great location close to shops for everything you need and is only a short ride into downtown. I would highly recommend staying here when visiting Seattle."
7396707,42982108,2015-08-16,41079908,Alexander,"A very nice stay. The house was exactly as pictured, clean and guest ready, and located very close to downtown Fremont. Wallace met me on time, despite my 10pm arrival. Wifi was fast, and there as even a vinyl record player to enjoy. Highly recommended "
7396707,43878735,2015-08-22,41830745,Beau,Wallace was very accommodating and welcoming. The house is in a great location in Fremont/Wallingford. The place clean and comfortable. Overall we were satisfied with our stay here. 
7396707,44234753,2015-08-24,23216237,Julie,"Wallace met us at the door and made us feel very welcome. The house is as pictured, a little lived-in but very clean. The location is fantastic—the Fremont neighborhood has a wonderful vibe, and is close to everything we wanted to do in Seattle. The vinyl record player was a great touch. "
7396707,44974013,2015-08-30,17472769,Emily,Wallace was very accommodating with our reservation and checking in. The house was  basic and clean. The neighborhood is convenient to eating out.
7396707,45640954,2015-09-04,5705395,Spencer,"Wallace was very accommodating, responsive, and relaxed.

Place was basic and spartan with a very good location.  Easy with no fuss and no muss.."
7396707,46017847,2015-09-07,5041916,Gwyn & Libby,"Our stay at Villa Villa Olaf was very enjoyable! It was so nice to have a whole house to ourselves in a great location. We enjoyed having off-street parking, a full kitchen, plenty of room in the 2 bedrooms and a nice big living room. The washer and dryer came in handy after a big rain and the porch was a sweet little chill out spot. Wallace was incredibly flexible and friendly with check-in and check-out. We'd definitely stay here again! "
7396707,47111356,2015-09-15,984770,Jillian,"Wallace was a great host. Made me feel very welcome and comfortable.  The listing is just as is looks in the pictures, not luxurious, but has everything you need. There were even some toys for our little one. The neighborhood was very walkable. Close to cafes and restaurants. Easy to catch a bus downtown."
7396707,50693728,2015-10-13,3364796,Rita,"The host: Wallace was friendly and answered inquiries quickly. We had some special requests and Wallace took care of them which really helped us out (thanks Wallace!) 

The house: It's an older house but very spacious and clean. We were mostly out and about so we really came back to rest and shower so everything we needed was there. The driveway was a bonus as finding parking in Seattle isn't always easy!

The neighborhood: Loved it! Villa Villa Olaf is in a great area with lots of restaurants nearby. There's a 24 hr QFC if you need to pick up groceries, and we found an awesome park for our son to play in (Wallingford Park - check it out if you have little ones). It's also really close to Greenlake Park which is beautiful. We had a car and went downtown everyday and it was only a 10 minute drive. If you don't have a car there seemed to be a lot of different bus routes available. 

We had adults and 2 children staying here and so it was a really great deal for us. If you're OK with the basics in an older home, then thumbs up for Villa Villa Olaf. "
7396707,51332254,2015-10-19,19295568,Elizabeth,"VVO is super cute and quaint and in an awesome location-- both Fremont and Wallingford centers were easily walkable, and the neighborhood itself was quiet and nice. Wallace met us at the house and was welcoming and kind, and made sure we had everything we needed (which of course we did). Really great experience!"
7396707,53032980,2015-11-03,13799492,Jennifer,"This comfy ""villa"" is a true Seattle experience. The true, real Seattle like it was before the tech giants took over. From the awesome retro motif to the vinyl you can play while you dance on the old hardwood floors it is true Seattle. The place is plenty big enough for two couples or a family with kids, so it is a bargain! It has a full kitchen so you can cook some meals there. There is also a welcoming assortment of teas and coffee. Although I didn't need it I also noticed there is a nice crib. The location is AMAZING. You can walk to the zoo, Green lake, Walingford (and my favorite bar the Seamonster, that has free live music every night.) There is off street parking in the driveway. AND you can have your dog!!  I absolutely loved my time in this little gem of a place. So highly recommended. "
7396707,54042123,2015-11-15,16864788,Risa,"We flew in late from San Francisco and Wallace was super helpful and willing to stay up late to let us into the house. He was very accommodating and made sure to give us a tour of the place, taking time to show us where everything was. The house was cozy and warm, which was essential with the rainy weather! Both house and host were amazing, I'd definitely recommend this place to any Seattle visitors!"
7396707,54636409,2015-11-22,628756,Terren,Wallace was very welcoming - the neighborhood was exactly as I expected. And Villa Vila Olaf was a quaint and comfortable place — very clean even though the kitchen is not particularly modern!. The bed was quite comfortable. I would definitely stay here again. 
7396707,55023329,2015-11-27,7533978,Kristin,"The house was great! Perfect for our stay, and Wallace was readily available for the duration of our stay. Would happily stay again!"
7396707,55492240,2015-12-01,6991168,Aaron,"Wallace was very welcoming and met me and my sister when we arrived. He gave us some good suggestions for nearby places to visit. The listing was accurate and the house was in a very nice and walkable neighborhood. Wallace was also very responsive. Great host, great place!"
7396707,56268222,2015-12-11,10264088,John,Wallace's house is pretty cool. He is a very responsive and accommodating host. He went over and above to make our stay comfortable. The house is in a great location. I would definitely stay here again.
7396707,56896894,2015-12-19,28772841,Linda,"I booked this stay on behalf of my remodeling client, who needed a place to stay while we refinished her hardwood floors.  She said the place was clean, that Wallace was very accessible, and that ""the neighborhood was just great!""  She had her two cats and young adult child with her, and they managed very nicely."
3115801,14745322,2014-06-25,15863803,Ankur,"I absolutely loved staying with Linda and Mike. First of all, their place is gorgeous. I was looking for a place for a one-month stay of my parents who visited me from India. The 1 BHK apartment is completely separate and private. This was perfect for my parents as they never felt that they were living at someone's else house. The house is very well furnished and the outside view makes you feel like you are living in mountains - it's very green, fresh air, and just beautiful. Linda and Mike are great host too - they arranged for extra mattress when I stayed with my parents for few nights. In addition, my parents wanted some Indian channels on T.V. - Linda surprised me when she visited the office of the cable company and got me the channels. My experience was just great.   "
3115801,15583997,2014-07-12,15690796,Karli,"This is a fantastic space to stay in Seattle -- Serene is the perfect word! Linda had all of the promised accommodations, and then some. My husband and I had a rental car, thus there was no need to navigate the public transportation system so I can't speak to that. But it never took us too long to get anywhere we wanted to go. The bed was SO comfortable, and it was nice to have reliable WiFi and some great TV/Movie selections. It was the perfect hybrid of home and hotel, and we loved it!"
3115801,16013577,2014-07-20,1511931,Clay,"We've stayed in quite a few Airbnb listings around Seattle and this was by far the best. The apartment was very clean, nicely furnished and has the convenience of a full size kitchen. The house is nestled up to nature for early morning cups of coffee on the porch, or you can walk across the street to the Duwamish Greenbelt for a walk. We didn't have a rental car so route 125 straight to downtown being right down the street was extremely convenient. There's nature when you want it, a very short trip to central West Seattle or Downtown Seattle when you don't.

I was also surprised to see the place was surprisingly stocked with snacks, fruit, juice, etc. which is a very pleasant surprise. This is good because the only downside (and it certainly wouldn't be for most) is that there's not a whole lot within convenient walking distance.

Overall our stay was fantastic and we had nary a complaint. We were even graciously offered a ride to the nearest light rail station so we could get to the airport. Definitely above and beyond! Wish we could have stayed longer."
3115801,16552070,2014-07-29,7966004,Nina & Travis,"Staying with Linda and Michael was serene, to say the least! What a lovely place they envisioned - we are so thankful they opened their home to share through AirBnB. Located in West Seattle, the space was quiet and calm, a great retreat after a long day of adventuring around Seattle. The bed was so comfy, and we loved using the TV w/ Roku set up for a date night-in watching documentaries! Our hosts were fantastic -  so thoughtful and responsive to any needs that arose. Meeting Linda was a true pleasure, and we were so thankful for her amazing hospitality. Thank you, again!! :)"
3115801,17209433,2014-08-09,16557281,Fiona,"A warm welcome from Linda via email began our great stay in her immaculate apartment.Linda is a gracious host who provided every breakfast need possible and attended to our enquiries. The quiet, peaceful balcony overlooking masses of trees, was a lovely place to have breakfast and evening drinks. We highly recommend staying here.

5660792,29245741,2015-04-05,5293815,Michelle,Host was very kind and friendly. Neighborhood was very central and safe. Walkable distance to downtown. Very nice stay. Thanks!
5660792,29518618,2015-04-08,29008261,Van,I loved my stay in Seattle! Thank you Caroline and Grace for being such great host! You guys were so helpful and helped us get around town with your tips. Their dog Mousse was the the cherry on top! So thankful for choosing them for my stay!
5660792,29687453,2015-04-11,16113697,Zachary,"Caroline and Mousse (her dog) are awesome hosts! She even invited me to an event her friend was hosting.

As far as the place, the photos are spot on. Check-in was easy even though I had a really late arrival. Caroline's place is centrally-located to everything in Capitol Hill and is walking distance to downtown and elsewhere. Even though you're close to everything, her street is quiet for those of you that are light sleepers.  I should mention that Caroline's house is clean and the shower has great water pressure, which is huge."
5660792,31214476,2015-05-03,3067814,Philippe,"Great hospitality. Very friendly. The place is perfectly located, calm and 15 minutes of walking distance from downtown. "
5660792,32352083,2015-05-17,28571712,Tom,Our time at Caroline's place was excellent. There were no issues at all and we got great recommendations for things to do in Seattle. Highly recommended for anyone spending time in Seattle!
5660792,32827412,2015-05-22,10473538,Auzeen,"Caroline is very welcoming and sweet. She offered anything in the house including food, and bath products. The home is so lovely (wish I could live there), clean and tidy. Mouse is such a sweetheart and probably the most disciplined dog I've ever met. The bedroom is just as shown in the photos and the bed was incredibly comfortable. It's literally in the heart of Capitol Hill. You can walk anywhere as it's a safe and hip neighborhood. There's a lot of stuff nearby and you really don't need to leave the area. I don't think I could have felt anymore comfortable staying here. I would book again if I could. Thank you Caroline!"
5660792,32916278,2015-05-23,32427614,Sara,The description was accurate and Caroline was super welcoming and accommodating and friendly! Great vibe in the space. We weren't able to spend too much time in the place (just there one night) but the amazing shower and really comfortable bed were amazing to come home to! 
5660792,33622503,2015-05-30,33943803,Luke,"Caroline is one of the most friendly and caring people I have met. She took the time to show me around Seattle and even let me use her paddleboard on the lake. Her place is very nice, just like the picture, has a great feel and is super comfy. I will definitely stay here again!"
5660792,33732773,2015-05-31,33732045,Rasheeda,Caroline was a great host. I was in and out in a short time but she made me feel very welcome. Her apartment is cute and her dog is adorbs.  I'd stay at her place again if in town. 
5660792,34563240,2015-06-09,2961398,Sarah,"Caroline's place was cozy, the bed was really comfortable- we slept so well, it really was centrally located in the heart of Capitol Hill. Everything was within walking distance. Public transportation was also really easy to use."
5660792,35392383,2015-06-18,19633020,Mark,"Caroline is a great host and made us feel very welcomed on our trip to Seattle.  Her place is in a great location with access to many delicious restaurants.  Everything went very smoothly, and I highly recommend staying with her.  Plus, she has a cool dog.  Thanks again!"
5660792,35673588,2015-06-21,13702744,Randy,"The apartment really is in the heart of Capitol Hill, just off the Pine/Pike strip of nightlife/bars/restaurants. It was easy to get to from the airport and was a quick walk to downtown (about a mile).

Caroline was a great host. She knew the area really well and gave some great recommendations on places to go. I would definitely stay again!"
5660792,35867268,2015-06-22,24163729,Folu,Lovely stay in a lovely neighborhood! The apartment felt very homely and Caroline was incredibly accommodating and helpful with restaurant suggestions. 
5660792,36132520,2015-06-25,19005794,Yun,I stayed at Caroline's place for two nights. The location is great! I took Uber from the west lake station (central downtown) to her place and it only cost about 6 dollars. The house was very clean and the room was lovely.  I didn't really get to meet Caroline but her roommate Grace was friendly and welcoming. Thank you for hosting! :) 
5660792,36218286,2015-06-26,34776256,Jackie,"Caroline was an awesome Airbnb host. Super friendly, relaxed, and able to make some great recommendations for things to see/do/eat in the area. She obviously likes meeting and hanging out with new people and even took a friend and I to Lake Washington for some sunshine and paddle boarding! Her place is comfy and funky, and her dog Mousse is a total love junkie but 100% well-behaved. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat. "
5660792,36307020,2015-06-27,27124158,Tori,"Caroline was extremely hospitable. Our room was clean and we were offered tons of helpful information about visiting Seattle.    The apartment was conveniently located to our destination and Mousse (the canine companion) was polite, friendly and well-behaved.  This was our first Air BNB experience and it was very positive. "
5660792,36480635,2015-06-28,36562765,Nina,"Caroline was so nice and welcoming! My schedule got a little messed up and she was very flexible with check in times. She even found a spot for me to park my truck (since parking in Capitol Hill can be tricky). The room was nice, clean, and very comfortable. Plus the location was perfect. It is within walking distance of all the great spots on Capitol Hill. I would definitely come back. "
5660792,36687680,2015-06-30,18097182,Kelly,"Great part of Capital Hill. Easy to get to bus stops. Caroline made it easy to get the key and check-in on my own. She was flexible with my check out time, too, because her next reservation wasn't until later in the evening on the day I left. 
I loved her roommate, Grace. We bonded over a love of blogs and food, and she gave me some recommendations for the area.
They have a dog, but it was super chill and easy. Even when I came in without Caroline or Grace, the dog never barked or even sniffed me to check me out. Since I'm not 100% comfortable with dogs, this was great."
5660792,38402835,2015-07-15,5897597,Brittany,"Caroline and Grace were extremely welcoming! In fact, Caroline picked me up from the Amtrak station and dropped me off at the bus stop when I left. I was unfortunately sick, but Grace made me some tea. I thought what an amazing experience they have given me. They were rock stars and would stay over there again. I liked having my own room/bed. The bed was extremely comfortable and smelled super clean! Thank you ladies for all you do to make my experience awesome.  "
5660792,38888565,2015-07-19,36525256,Scott,"What could possibly make Seattle any better than it already is?  How about a killer place to stay with some awesome people, an amazing location, and to top it off an adorable puppy!  I'd say WIN, WIN, WIN!!!

Although Caroline wasn't around during our stay, she was super communicative before we arrived and throughout our stay.  Her roommate Grace was there the whole time and just an awesome host.  She was not only fun to hang with, but really helpful in giving us some things to do and places to eat.  

Now, let's chat about that puppy!  What an adorable and gentle fella.  He was there to great us every time we returned and was just the fluffiest friend ever.  

Loved the space, loved the location, loved it all!  Thanks so much!"
5660792,39101353,2015-07-20,1523828,Ces,"Caroline and Grace were such lovely hosts. Their place is in a great location, and the room was tidy and spacious. Caroline was awesome at communicating... providing me a very detailed description of how to get to their place. Too bad I only stayed in Seattle for a night!"
5660792,39314487,2015-07-22,35224908,Melissa,"I stayed with Caroline during a solo trip to Seattle in the midst of a long Pacific Northwest vacation. Caroline was very accommodating of a few changes to my schedule and always promptly responded in a welcoming way. I unfortunately didn't get much of a chance to get to know Caroline (I was only there for a short night), but I had a great time with her roommate and really enjoyed the neighborhood, apartment, and their dog Mousse. The location is excellent (safe, and I was easily able to walk down to Pike Place Market), and they were polite, friendly hosts. I would certainly stay with them again. "
5660792,39471336,2015-07-23,3444994,Julia,The place was conveniently located and comfortable. A great last minute solution for me on an unexpected work trip when the rest of the city hotels were booked out. Thanks Caroline!
5660792,40299518,2015-07-29,39762336,Mark,"Great place!  Super friendly hosts! Neighbourhood full of great restaurants.  Quick communication, clean, tidy.  Felt just like staying with friends!  Highly recommend."
5660792,40626755,2015-08-01,23616495,Kristopher,"Caroline was super easy to talk to and checked in with us prior to arrival. When we showed up, a bit late, her and her roommate were making a late dinner and offered us some food after long travels. Both her and her roommate were kind and generous."
5660792,41201183,2015-08-05,20910775,Farren,Caroline and Grace were fantastic hosts! Very friendly and easy-going! The apartment is located in a great neighborhood that's easily walkable to the downtown area. Would definitely stay with them again! 
5660792,41490027,2015-08-07,6786540,Samuel,"I was in Seattle traveling for business and stayed with Caroline and Grace for one night. They were excellent hosts - laid back, easy to coordinate with, helpful with suggestions for the neighborhood. The location was centrally located and a short walk from a nice park nearby. The place itself was pretty solid considering the price and location. I hope to stay again if I'm back in Seattle."
5660792,41615087,2015-08-08,35735984,Jason,"This was a calm, comfortable oasis in the middle of crazy Capitol Hill nightlife scene.  As others have said Moose the dog is friendly and laid back.  Everything is accessible via walking so there is no need for a car."
5660792,41770695,2015-08-09,33466794,Katelyn,"Caroline and her roommate Grace were very helpful during our stay and made sure to give us clear instructions on how to arrive at their place. Additionally, although we never met either girl, they were available by phone for any questions. The place itself is in a neat neighborhood with a few restaurants and bars nearby. It was a 20 minute walk to Volunteer Park where there are amazing views of the city from the water tower. And it was not too far of a walk from the train station (although the walk was mostly uphill). 
The negative is that the place was not as tidy as I was expecting and you definitely get the feel that you are staying in somebody else's space. The bed was comfortable and the sheets were clean, but the bathroom was cluttered and the stairwell leading into their place smelled like animal urine. There is no air conditioning so the windows remain open and the traffic outside can be loud sometimes. "
5660792,42427911,2015-08-13,38472244,Gregory,"Host was great.  Room was great.  Neighborhood was great.  Dog was great.  

If you are going to an even at the Washington Convention Center, this is a great alternative to the expensive hotels near the convention center.  It's about a 20 minute walk (all downhill) to the convention center.  "
5660792,42910132,2015-08-16,37499936,Gavin,"Caroline was wonderful. Very relaxed and friendly. The location is perfect. Walking distance for great bars, food, lake washington. The list goes on. Definitely recommend. "
5660792,43252916,2015-08-18,1092709,Steven,"The location is great with many shops, bars, and restaurants within walking distance. A good ice cream spot and a brewery are only two blocks away! There are many bus stops close by and downtown is only a short walk away. The room is spacious and the bed is very comfortable. Caroline and her roommates (including the dog) are very friendly. Overall this is a good spot in the Capital Hill. Highly recommend it for visitors who are comfortable with walking and using public transportation. Seattle is wonderful. "
5660792,44698020,2015-08-28,1889890,Becca,Grace and Caroline were both super nice and very helpful. They gave me great tips of what to do around the city and were happy to hang when I was home (even if it was only for a few minutes)
5660792,45068680,2015-08-31,33705813,Preston,"Amazing location, great people, and the sweetest dog. We had a great time staying here and would highly recommend both the Amazing hosts and the location. "
5660792,45573862,2015-09-04,16686303,Mercedes,"I would definitely stay here again! Grace and Caroline were awesome hosts. The apartment was clean, bed was super comfortable, and there's lots of room too. You can't beat the location in Cap Hill. They're super knowledgeable about the city and had great recommendations for what to see and do. "
5660792,47337405,2015-09-17,15133953,Jay,"Simply stated Caroline and Grace were excellent hosts. Very accommodating, friendly and organized. Highly recommend. "
5660792,47713019,2015-09-21,3065911,Vanessa,"Caroline and Mousse (her awesome, amazing, and down to earth dog) where amazing hosts. The location was perfect, excellent walking radius to all things fun. The accommodation was very cozy. Caroline was helpful on recommendations for around Seattle. I would return to her home again!

明るく人当たりの良いカロラインさんと、元気で人懐っこい犬のムーシーに囲まれて楽しく過ごす事が出来ました！ロケーションも良く、ダウンタウンやスペースニードルなどにも時間を気にせず行けます。
おすすめの宿泊場所です！"
5660792,48863856,2015-09-29,1938525,Mike,"Caroline was a great host and the location is perfect if you're looking for restaurants, bars and coffee within walking distance. Noise from Capitol Hill was not a problem during our weekend stay. There are lots of buses to downtown, but we walked to most sights (it helps to stop and grab a coffee on the way!). Caroline was very friendly and able to give us lots of tips for where to eat. Mousse was very friendly, too!"
5660792,49966280,2015-10-07,5906994,Izabela,The host canceled this reservation 44 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5660792,49991810,2015-10-08,15277884,Andrew,"Caroline's listing is in a great location.  There are tons of food, drink and shopping options all within walking distance.  It's also within walking distance of downtown Seattle.  I walked almost everywhere I went and had no problems getting around.  Getting to and from this listing was simple, and the hosts were friendly, helpful and very responsive.  I would recommend this listing to anyone.  It's clean and cozy.  Oh, and the bed was comfy too!  "
5660792,53242983,2015-11-07,11055569,Grace,Caroline's descriptions for her place are just the way it really is. The location is very accessible to downtown either by bus or on foot. The bed is just way too comfy that I'm sure you will have a very sound sleep. Caroline is very easy-going too and I would like to meet her very much and stay here if I visit Seattle again!
10385,12159,2009-10-02,38278,Alex,Great place to stay. thoroughly enjoyable experience. very easy to get downtown.  set up of the room was devine.
10385,12361,2009-10-04,36408,Russell,"Thanks for a wonderful time. Everything was Perfect, we had so much fun and great quality time. So relaxing, great place to stay and we hope to enjoy it again in the near future. Thanks Amy!"
10385,12893,2009-10-09,37317,TomJudy,"Amy & Joey are Seattle's best kept secret! Such hospitality and comfort and unheard of in hotels.  They have thought of everything from a fuzzy robe after a bath with the best of soaps to a dark chocolate treat to fresh cold water in the fridge and wonderful coffee and tea.  We will definitely return to Amy's Places and will encourage anyone who is visiting Seattle to do the same.  What a treat after a week on the road to come ""home"" to Amy's and what a let down to go back to staying in a motel.  Thank you!  Tom & Judy - Glenwood City, Wisconsin"
10385,14279,2009-10-19,42989,Jill,"Very quiet, comfortable (too many pillows--is that possible?), private, secure, clean. On street parking around the corner--perfect, off the busy thorough-fare.  Helpful, hospitable hosts--great chocolates!  Thanks, Stefan - Saint Paul, MN  "
10385,14789,2009-10-24,43897,Ericka,"Amy and Joey's place was absolutely perfect for us.  The accommodations are warm, comfortable, super clean and stylish.  It would be worth a trip back just to snuggle up again in those (email hidden)e softest we've ever had!  Lots of very thoughtful details.  Amy and Joey manage a perfect balance of friendly hospitality and respectful privacy.  We'll definitely be back.  Thank you for everything - Brian & Ericka, Los Angeles, CA"
10385,16174,2009-11-03,50201,Evonne,"This is a lovely, cozy, warm place.  I stayed two nights as a retreat while studying for a professional exam.  

Amy was very welcoming and kind, but after the tour I felt like I had tons of privacy - a private stairwell entry to room and bath gives a nice separation from the rest of the house.

The bed has great soft linens and a memory foam top for good, deep sleep.  Their place is very clean, modern, and has tons of amenities.  Used dishes/cups magically disappear from a busing tray at the end of the hall and they offer laundry services as well, all invisibly without intrusion.   Personal fridge, filtered hot/cold water and french press for coffee were nice perks to make it easy to feel at home.  

Their salon-style and skills were also felt in the bathroom - tub for soaking or shower option, and great products - and the AMAZING robe.  

It was a lovely home away from home - I'm booking as a personal get a way before my next major exam. 

and, did I mention that I live in Seattle?  Worth paying for and I only live a few miles away!"
10385,16865,2009-11-10,39696,Jennifer,"Evonne N hits the nail on the head describing how private and cozy this place is. I can't stop raving about it to anyone who will listen. Besides being clean, beautifully decorated and well-stocked with amenities, there are many thoughtful touches that make it feel much more like being at home or in a friend's guest room than in a generic, impersonal hotel. The neighborhood is beautiful too, all quiet and residential and full of gorgeous houses and ample parking, and it's also directly across the street from a bus stop so it's convenient to mass transit too. I felt like I was staying in a five star hotel in all the good ways and none of the impersonal ones. I loved it so much I'm going to be back in a week and plan to stay here every time I come to Seattle! I'm recommending Amy & Joey's to all of my friends."
10385,18075,2009-11-23,39696,Jennifer,"My second stay was just as comfortable and amazing as the first! There's nothing not to like about Amy & Joey's place - beautiful, clean, well-stocked, private, quiet, the list goes on. Add to this that Amy & Joey are so friendly, warm, and manage a beautiful balance between attentiveness and respectful privacy. You can't go wrong booking this space. I know where I'll stay the next time I'm in town!"
10385,18488,2009-11-28,42937,Jim,Amy and Joey have taken great effort to make the room pleasant and comfortable.
10385,24025,2010-01-14,66954,Joelle,"My husband and I recently stayed here while I was interviewing in Seattle for jobs. The room was clean - with a private sink, fridge, and microwave. The hosts supplied us with a french press and coffee for the morning. The bed was very comfortable, which allowed a good night's sleep. I liked that we had our own bathroom, which was well stocked with towels, and they even had two robes laid out for us (which we didn't use but were very soft to touch). There is street parking and the house is located very near public transportation. The neighborhood was nice and felt safe to walk around at night. Overall, great value and cozy room. Felt like we were staying at a friend's house instead of a hotel."
10385,27052,2010-02-21,62545,Rameez,"Loved staying with Amy and Joey. The room and bathroom were lovely, just like staying at home only nicer!! A great spot to discover the U distict, somewhere that we wouldn't have found if stayed in the city. Amy and Joey are very helpful and we would definatley stay again if we return to Seattle."
10385,32514,2010-03-31,92575,Shelly,It was quiet and lovely.  Everything was homey and comfortable.
10385,33364,2010-04-04,99110,Don,"I just got back from a relaxing weekend in Seattle. Amy and Joey's place was a perfect respite from a blowy and wet two days. If you've never been to Seattle, you'll be surprised by the almost-rural flavor of the neighborhood, but it's convenient to I-5 and the entire north side of the city. The room is homey and the bathroom is large and comfortable. I didn't meet Amy, but Joey was a gracious host and made me feel welcome. I can't imagine a more satisfying introduction to the airbnb experience."
10385,34798,2010-04-11,88943,Veronica,I stayed at Amy and Joey's place for the weekend while I attended classes.  It was a perfect setup for me - quiet and private.  Everything was clean and comfortable.  I will definitely be staying there again.
10385,36704,2010-04-19,102111,Happy,"I was able to come & go with ease. No hassles.Room was quiet & comfortable. Private bath is a necessity for me & I had that.
I will definitely stay again when I visit Seattle."
10385,41828,2010-05-12,50201,Evonne,"stay #2 just as relaxing and private and luxurious as stay #1!  i am a regular ---  see you guys this fall!  thanks for being my home away from home.  oh, and i LOVE that you added the hot/cold water cooler directly to the room, even more convenient!"
10385,50088,2010-06-06,29058,Charley,"Amy & joey have a very nice accommodation. I was very comfortable in the room, which had a sink, and access to a private bathroom. The small fridge, microwave, and hot/cold water cooler are nice features, as well as the cable TV. The window looks out on a pleasant yard and nice houses. It's set up so the guest goes directly to the room through a foyer and stairs, without any sense of intrusion. The only thing that could have made it better is if there had been a fan because the room was a bit too warm at times."
10385,55542,2010-06-21,55876,Don,Excellent place to stay. My wife and I enjoyed it very much. Thanks.
10385,74413,2010-08-06,150574,Dave,"Amy and Joey have scoped out pretty much everything you need for what they advertise - a hotel alternative!  The fridge was handy for hydrating after the long summer days.  The microwave heated up our favorite snacks.  The bed was good for sleeping through and in addition to the full private bath, the in-room sink kept mornings efficient!  The appointments were like first class hotels.  The proximity to public transportation allowed us to forego a car - saved a bundle!  I can't imagine two weeks in a hotel being more comfortable than this."
10385,77686,2010-08-13,135523,Yvette,"nicely presented room,a short walk to good Italian restaurant, easy to find on a quiet street, yet just a short drive to a shopping centre and the motorway."
10385,84838,2010-08-26,109834,Jenna,"I stayed at Amy and Joey's Guest room with my daughter for a week at the end of August and it truly was a wonderful experience! They think of every last detail to make your stay a memorable one. From the fantastic coffee in the morning to the fluffy towels and bathrobes. They were wonderful, gracious hosts and I only hope the room is available next year when I return.  "
10385,89229,2010-09-02,206203,Amanda,Nice accomodations.  Great bed!  Very nice people.

Leonie and Sven"
10385,151036,2010-12-08,308201,Lynette,"I had a great stay with Amy & joey. The 'Upscale Bedroom and Bathroom were really great, and it was obvious that a lot of attention had been given to hosting guests in their home. Response time to any queries / questions I had was excellent.  Only sorry I was not staying there longer. "
10385,178702,2011-02-06,342583,Jeff,"Joey and Amy are a complete class act.  We got snowed in here in Chicago and our flight was cancelled.  I called and emailed Joey and Amy to let them know that we could not make it out to Seattle as planned.  Joey not only called back within a couple of hours, he agreed to refund our money, even though we were letting them know the day before our reservation! 

We do plan to get out there soon, and definitely will stay with those two. Their good deeds deserve to be rewarded!

10385,271863,2011-05-20,475792,Kristi,"This is a very nice location - close to I-5 and getting to the Eastside (522, 405) as well.  The room is nicely appointed with water cooler, fridge, microwave oven and sink!  The bathroom is nicer than mine at home- and high quality ammenities such as shampoo, conditioner, nice TP, great sheets and pillows and memory foam on bed - I slept very well!! I will stay here again when in Seattle area!  "
10385,277649,2011-05-23,595523,Christine,"This was my first AirBnB experience. I found this to be easier, more convenient and comfortable than a hotel. Amy and Joey's place was private, quiet, clean and had small, thoughtful touches (tea basket, bathrobe, foot massager, microwave, mini-fridge, plates/bowls and utensils) that made my stay a perfect home away from home. I have already recommended this place to friends and do not hesitate to recommend this to the broader community, and hope to stay here again on another visit."

I would definitely try to stay there again if the situation arises."
10385,340032,2011-06-28,578875,Kirsten,"I stayed here for two weeks with my 20 yr old son. I was in school at Bennett Stellar University for NLP, Hypnosis and Reiki and Life coaching classes due to being in class a lot my son was on his own most of the trip. I know he has a new friend for life in Joey. The home is absolutely Beautiful, The energy is positive and light, Its smells amazing and is very clean and updated. The neighborhood is great for walking threw so much to look at the homes are all well taken care of and there are so many little coffee shops and places to eat close by and a grocery store down the street. A few exits away on the the 5 freeway and your at Seattle Center. I highly recommend place to stay.  "
10385,356803,2011-07-06,647894,Joyce,I stayed with Amy in Joey for a week while I searched for an apartment to settle into in Seattle. The room was perfect!  The bed was very comfortable.  The sink and the refrigerator in the room were nice convenient touches that made the room more private during my stay.   
10385,371209,2011-07-13,647486,Carolyn,"My husband and I had a great stay, the only hiccup was during check-in but there was a very easy fix. Joey was a great host and the room was lovely. The bed and the robes provided were especially comfortable. 

We appreciated that everything was very clean, the french press and the coffee that was provided.

Overall, I'd definitely stay here again. Awesome quality for a pretty stellar price."

It has a refrigerator, microwave and wonderful pressed coffee. The bed is comfortable and the room is very quiet. I also had a desk and wifi. Joey has lots of great hair products in the private bathroom. The Terry cloth robes are a nice touch!
It was a fun place to stay."
10385,449301,2011-08-16,591871,Andrea,"This was a great location, a very comfortable room, and an affordable rate.

10385,4169933,2013-04-15,1182326,Anna,Jessica and Joey have done a great job. Their place is perfect. The accommodations are better than the photos show and it is clear that they have both taken time and trouble to consider what the traveler needs. We were comfortable and felt well taken care of. We highly recommend their 15th Ave place which is wonderfully quiet and extremely convenient.  Thanks to them both for a memorable weekend visiting our son. Anna and Nicholas Davidson
10385,5162032,2013-06-16,6217969,Liz,"I stayed with Jess and Joey for three weeks after I sold my house but before I could move out of town and it was great! They were super easy to communicate with and did everything they could to make my stay perfect. The room was exactly as advertised and the bathroom was even bigger and better! The house itself is really nice, smells great (thanks to Joey's salon) and is a good location. I can't thank them enough for making my transition out of Seattle so smooth. "
10385,5354988,2013-06-25,6940179,Debi,"This was my first time using airbnb & Jessica & Joey made it great. Their place is beautiful, super clean and convenient. .Joey's  hair studio is on the first floor, so you can get an amazing new doo while you are here. Jessica is darling! We couldn't gat the DVD to work but she should gave it a good try. She was so sweet & we enjoyed the little bit of time we had to chat. We had complete privacy and would definitely come back. I loved their decor, everything was perfect!"

The room and bathroom are everything that is advertised.  We had a great stay in Seattle and would reccommend Jess and Joey's room.  Everything was very clean and the bed is very comfortable.
10385,7774161,2013-10-02,8402155,Ray,"This was my first time trying AirBnB's service and I am very satisfied. I chose this spot mainly for its location on a bus route convenient to the University District and Downtown. Jess & Joey provided a clean, well-appointed, safe and quiet room for my 5-night stay in Seattle. WI-Fi, desk, fridge, microwave, in-room sink/counter, comfy bed, cable TV, reading chair and lamp, spacious closet and adjoining private bath: just the things I needed. Room 1 worked for me very well. "

My boyfriend and I were looking for a nice, private place to stay that felt more like a hotel than somebody's spare room, and this place was perfect because we had privacy, but it was still warm and welcoming - probably nicer than any hotel we would have stayed at!"

10385,11413335,2014-04-01,12708778,James,"This is a nice place with good access to public transit, and the hosts thoughtfully provided everything I needed in the room. No doubt I will be back should I need a place in the area in the future."
10385,14092660,2014-06-11,8712866,Jasper,"I enjoyed staying here. This accommodation is indeed akin to staying at a hotel. It included all the expected amenities. Jess and Joey are very responsive.
If you come without a car, carefully study the schedule of line 73. Particularly in the evenings when it only passes by once an hour."
10385,14732253,2014-06-25,12488607,Mamnoon,"We enjoyed our 10 day stay in Jess and Joey's home which was aesthetically decorated.  The room given to us was well appointed with  necessary amenities taken care of. Jess and Joey probably believe in giving their guests ""space"" as we hardly ran into them during our stay.  There is a bus stop conveniently located,from where bus 73 takes about 50 minutes to reach downtown. All in all, a very good first time experience with Airbnb home."
10385,15893171,2014-07-17,7600637,May,Joey and Jess are very quick to respond and is available when you need them even when they are not in the house. They are only a text or phone call or e-mail away. They are also very gracious & fair in your request. Plenty of easy parking is a plus in Seattle locations. They are here to please their guests.
10385,16732648,2014-08-01,13960822,Ken,"Check in was very smooth and professional.  The room was very clean and the bed was quite comfortable.  I really enjoyed the location, walking to the Roosevelt Ale House for dinner, enjoying the Maple Leaf Playfield in the evening.  Joey was available for questions when needed and parking was very straight forward."
10385,18255180,2014-08-24,18500545,Ethan,"Convenient to public transit—a five-night stay included exactly zero cab rides.  The neighborhood was quiet, safe, and pretty cute to these out-of-towners.  Jess and Joey were prompt and courteous, recommending some local restaurants and taking care of anything we asked for (which was little—the space was well kept)."
10385,18548234,2014-08-28,15094900,Sue,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was great. The house was safe and quiet neighborhood.  Close to Seattle downtown and most attraction.
I definitely book another stay here in the future. 
Thanks Jess & Joey"
10385,20277900,2014-09-27,17168875,Stephen,"I was a visiting medical student at the UW medical center and needed a place to stay for one month. Jess and Joey's ""Upscale Seattle Hotel Alternative"" worked out perfectly for me and is a much cheaper and better choice than a hotel. Everything was as described and even better in person. Check-in was smooth and the location is close to downtown, restaurants, and numerous local shops. I never had a problem finding nearby street parking.  Both the bedroom and the adjacent bathroom were clean and spacious and have good lighting and a homely, pleasant decor. The rooms felt really private; they are located upstairs and feel separate from the rest of the house.  The sink in my room was an extra plus. The bed was incredibly comfortable as there is a layer of memory foam on top of the mattress along with memory foam pillows. The room was always quiet and the WIFI was reliable. The minifridge and microwave made it easy for me to prepare and store food. Dirty plates and silverware were replaced with clean ones promptly. The filtered hot/cold water dispenser was a very nice amenity. I was able to schedule a time to use the laundry machines without any problems. I met Jess and Joey during my first week and they are both super friendly, respectful hosts and were always readily available via person, email, or phone to answer any questions. I will definitely be staying at Joey and Jess’s place again if I return to Seattle.  This was my first Airbnb experience and it was exceptional!"
10385,20538824,2014-09-30,21663383,Yiying,What surprised me was the room just like the pics online..it is really clean n nice...Joey is really nice and warm-hearted
10385,22620545,2014-11-10,1928839,Connie,"Joey and Jess' place is exactly as described/shown. The neighborhood is quiet, and getting into Seattle is quick and easy. As noted by others, parking was never an issue. My friend and I were looking for a hub to for our adventures in metro Seattle and the surrounding national parks, and this fit the bill perfectly. There's a delicious ramen place and diner nearby, which was a huge bonus for us. I didn't get to see the hosts, as Joey seemed busy with clients in his hair studio and I never wanted to bother them, but I definitely enjoyed the stay! The hosts had no problems with our late/midnight check-in. "
10385,24078035,2014-12-19,1193262,David,"Room was very nice and clean. I had an extended 3 week stay so found the microwave and refrigerator to be convenient. 

A lot of privacy with the room.  Location is very close to a busstop. 

I plan to stay again during my next business trips! "
10385,24706010,2015-01-02,10875580,Sharon,"This was a perfect place for us to stay when visiting family in the Maple Leaf district. Besides being close to our family, it was a great location for walking to the park and coffee.  Check in and out was super easy.  The room was comfortable and spotlessly clean.  Loved staying here!"
10385,28213895,2015-03-20,27901515,Jerry,"Very nice place.  House and room were very clean and the neighborhood was fine.   It was close to the bus stop, which helped."
10385,30047024,2015-04-16,29034662,Tunzala,"Although I didn't have a chance to meet Jess and Joey in person, everything was great. The room was as described. Neighborhood is very quiet and beautiful. I should tell, the girls working downstairs were very friendly and welcoming. They helped us with every question we had. "
10385,30255192,2015-04-19,25242950,Lingzhi,"It is a very nice and quiet house nearby UW, 15min to downtown, very good transportation and with beautiful surroundings. I like it so much! And Jess is really a kind and considerate host, offering us greatest room experience. This is my first airbnb experience but it is so fantastic that I will definitely still choose Jess's house next time if coming to Seattle !"
10385,39761050,2015-07-26,7447541,Kathleen,"Great communication. Easy to access our room. Jess was there to show us to our room and provide a fan as the room was very warm. Loved the house, room and neighborhood. All very accessible."
10385,40248753,2015-07-29,20881690,Jade,Nous avions la chambre située au 1er étage au dessus du salon de coiffure.Quartier très calme et proche du centre en voiture (15 minutes à peine). La chambre et la salle de bain sont propres et agréables. Thank you very much :)
10385,42416862,2015-08-13,37350761,Linda,Jess and Joey made it easy to arrive at any time since we were flying on standby.  They made us feel welcome before we even got there.  The room was just as described and pictured.  It was very comfortable and roomy.  It had everything we needed.  It was very clean.  We enjoyed meeting both Jess and Joey.  We liked the location and Joey's recommendations on where to eat.  We would love to stay here again!
10385,43068865,2015-08-17,37146501,Dylan,"Our stay in Seattle at Jess & Joeys was great! Unfortunately we were fairly busy and didn't have much time to meet our hosts but their hospitality was apparent. Our room and bathroom were clean and tastefully decorated, our location close to downtown was perfect for seeing all that Seattle had to offer. Parking can also be tough in Seattle but there was always a spot out front of the house that we could park in. Jess even suggested an excellent Italian restaurant down the street that both me and my girlfriend fell in love with. There are several other facilities within walking distance for those who are visiting Seattle without a car.  Overall, our experience was absolutely perfect in every way. We would definitely stay here again! "
10385,43668093,2015-08-21,39855684,Xige,"The staying with Jess and Joy is wonderful! The room is nice and cozy, even better than the pictures.  The neighborhood is very quite, I slept very well.   They provide almost anything you will need, towel, shampoo, plates, forks,etc. Also your privacy will be well protected. Jess and Joy are incredibly nice people, even though I did not have the chance to talk to them much, I can definitely feel their hospitality. This is the best place to stay!"
10385,47177342,2015-09-16,41413407,Kelly,"Joe and Jess made me feel right at home. I had the place to myself after they closed up shop every evening and felt completely safe. 
It's a great neighborhood! Just a couple blocks from restaurants and a convenient store and only a few more steps to a fantastic park with a walking/jogging path. 
Easy access to the interstate and downtown. 
I will definitely stay again if I need to stay in the Seattle area!"
10385,50090315,2015-10-09,25200042,Alice Foley & James McClellan,"The room was as pictured. It is above a home salon in a nice neighbourhood, right next to the bus stop (number 73 which takes 30 minutes to downtown).  The house is also within walking distance to the university district.

Although we didn't have access to a kitchen, the microwave and fridge in the room proved very useful.

We met Jess a few days into our stay, she was friendly and helpful.  Overall a good stay. "
580815,5034983,2013-06-09,4533977,Kurt,"Great location, lovely apartment, fast internet, polite neighbors and a helpful host - truly a wonderful place to stay. Johnny was on call and available the few times I needed something or had a question during my month-long stay.

In addition to the essentials, a handy guidebook about the apartment and area, coffee and filters for the coffee maker, and cold filtered water in the refrigerator were all nice touches I had not even expected but certainly appreciated."
580815,12084811,2014-04-22,5216961,Lauren,"This apartment was perfect for vacation. It had everything you could possibly need, and it was comfortable and clean. It felt bigger than it looked because there's a hallway attached, and it has a huge closet and storage for your clothes. You can put away your suitcase and it feels like home. 

It was decorated really nicely. The kitchen was small, but stocked with everything you could need. Since it's in such a fun area we were rarely home, but we would have been comfortable cooking and eating dinner, and even having friends over for drinks. It doesn't feel like a hotel, but it also doesn't feel like someone else's apartment; it's really cozy and sweet. 

The location is great for walking to nightlife in Capitol Hill, and it's only about a 15-minute walk downtown to all of the big stores. We loved the sandwich shop and brunch spot/bar downstairs. Both had great food and no wait. There are some fun restaurants and great venues just a few blocks away; we walked during the day and took a very short cab ride at night.  

It's in a big residential building with a grocery store across the street. The big back patio would be nice in the summer. 

Lastly, don't forget to get some of Seattle's famous late-night hot dogs just up the street on Harvard. They are to-die-for, and this was in a perfect location to indulge!

I'm listing the drawbacks below, in case you have different needs than ours. I would definitely book this place again, but I can see a few of these things taking away from someone else's experience: 
1. The water never got much above body temperature, so our showers were short. 
2. The bathroom vanity is super small with no storage, so it was difficult to plug in a curling iron and store our toiletries. We had to keep them in the closet and move them back and forth the entire time. 
3. Don't bother getting the parking permit. The lot never fills up, and it's actually much less expensive to pay for parking than to pay for the permit.  
4. The heat is really hard to control. It's either on full blast or not at all. We ended up leaving it on but sleeping with the windows wide open. 
5. The sidewalk across the street is a gathering place for homeless people. The neighborhood feels VERY safe and its very nice, but there doesn't seem to be an effort to keep drunk or stoned people quiet or off the street. A few times we were woken up by loud yelling, but it never felt unsafe. It was just a little annoying."
580815,14205757,2014-06-14,5057856,Nellie,"Location is the best!! We love staying near great cafés ad restaurants and hipster places, despite not quite managing to be hipsters ourselves! The apt had everything we needed. And just so many places nearby. We loved it! "
580815,14655715,2014-06-23,2083178,Bowie,"Apartment was very homey and enjoyable. Perfect for my weekend getaway. Kitchen stocked with anything you may need. Neighborhood was very lively at night but wasn't too loud or rowdy. Walkable to Pike Place. Staff was very accommodating with storing our bags while we were out. Overall, great apartment and experience!"
580815,23651338,2014-12-07,16510286,Emma,"This apartment was fantastic! It's not the biggest space, but provides ample room in an unbeatable location for two people. We were able to walk to all of our favorite places and transportation from the airport was a breeze on the rail. Check-in was smooth and painless. Our flight didn't arrive till later in the evening but we were able to grab our keys from the eatery downstairs. Christine left us an envelope with ""need-to-knows"" for the apartment along with the keys. The bed was super comfortable and the bathroom and kitchen were clean. Would definitely stay again! Thanks! "
580815,33601958,2015-05-30,16818358,Jean-Bernard,"The apartment is much like the description given. It is very clean, well furnished, quiet and in front of a QFC supermarket. The neighbourhood is very cool with all kinds of bars and restaurants."
580815,34082031,2015-06-04,33347866,Jennifer,"My friend and I had a wonderful stay in this apartment.  Christine was very helpful and friendly.   The room itself was great and really cute!   It was clean and comfortable. The other tennents were wonderful and very friendly as well, even inviting us to an impromptu bbq. The location is great.  Within walking distance of everything (if you don't mind hills).   The neighborhood couldn't be better; so much to do.   Every kind of restaurant you can think of is within a few blocks.  Having the 24- hr grocer directly across the street was very handy.   we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again!"
580815,34963581,2015-06-14,32062334,Janelle,"What a wonderful place! Christine was very prompt with her emails and checking in was a breeze. The apartment is PERFECTLY located within walking distance of anything you can think of! Tons of restaurants, nice little grocery store across the way, parks, and downtown. Will definitely be back and will be sure to stay at this cute place! "
580815,39977601,2015-07-27,37083852,Jessica,"The location was fantastic! Plenty of places to eat and lots to do within a 5 block radius. It was a quick trip to downtown and Pike Place Market. We really enjoyed our stay here and would recommend it to anyone! Great size for one person or couple. 

Everyone was welcoming and friendly. The apartments were quiet and well maintained. "
580815,40933472,2015-08-03,21683316,Emilia,"This apartment was perfect for our stay in Seattle - spacious, clean, comfortable, and so well located, within easy walking distance both to downtown and all the great things to do/eat/see in Capitol Hill. The unit was definitely as pictured, charmingly decorated with fun art work. We referred often to the binder on the dining room table containing lots of neighborhood recommendations. Christine, who is awesome, met up with us to give us the keys and was very easy to contact. Would totally stay here again!"
580815,56590395,2015-12-15,31530528,Ben,"Our stay at St. John's Apartment #319 was great! Christine was very responsive leading up to the stay and getting the keys/access to the room was easy and stress free. The location is great if you are familiar with the city and don't want to stay downtown. The room was extremely clean and welcoming. The pictures online perfectly show how the place looks and the bathroom (which isn't pictured) was just as nice as the main living space. Great place in an amazing, hip, neighborhood.

841049,3174960,2012-12-28,4446754,Jayne,"We had a great visit to Seattle, and enjoyed staying at the affordable and lovely space Alexia provided. She was an excellent hostess, and always made sure we had everything we needed. Alexia even spent Christmas Day showing us the sights in Seattle. It was way above and beyond anything we could have expected. I'd recommend this comfortable space and beautiful area to anyone traveling to Seattle."

841049,3313726,2013-01-08,3856394,Francois,Great place to stay! The area is such a refreshing change from Downtown and Alexia is super nice. She made sure that everything was perfect.
841049,3330097,2013-01-11,4630164,Stephen,"Great little place in a very convenient location. I was most impressed in the attention to detail. I feel like the price was fair, and the quality was way better than an equivalently priced hotel. We had a parking space in the back, but it would probably be difficult to use if you have a large (website hidden) meals was easy. Everything was very clean and tastefully decorated. Alexia is extremely responsive and attentive: she really works hard for you. "
841049,3377727,2013-01-20,979834,Brandon,"Alexia was an excellent host and very communicative.  Very nice space and great location close to shops, public transportation, while at the same time in a quiet neighborhood. Highly recommended!"

841049,3489199,2013-02-06,177359,Collin,"I was out a lot so I didn't see Alexia very much, but she was a great host and made sure I had everything I needed during my stay. Her house was remarkably clean and the location is perfect, very quiet but within walking distance of all of Capitol Hill. I'd definitely stay again."
841049,3520623,2013-02-11,4940140,Josh,"Alexia was a great host.  She offered to pick me up from downtown when I arrived and while I was reluctant o make her do so, she insisted it was fine and did so with a smile. Location was superb and accommodations were very comfortable. I would stay at her place again for sure!  Super easy and relaxing!"
841049,3603469,2013-02-22,4888351,Annebnb,"Comfortable, quiet and low-key place!  Perfect for my needs as I spent most time with nearby family.  The location is great, host is extremely welcoming and as helpful as needed, not at all intrusive.  Lovely!"
841049,3625974,2013-02-26,2677175,Rachel,"Alexia was lovely and the room was perfect! I had a great stay! Alexia was very accommodating and I felt really comfortable in her place. The location was excellent - lots of nice restaurants very close by, and the 49 bus which runs downtown is only a couple blocks away. I would definitely stay again!"
841049,3679780,2013-03-03,5100515,Raymond,"Alexia is a phantastic host and her house is nothing less than amazing, situated in one of the nicest quarters in town. Everything is just like she says in her offering. Although the weather was the typical Seattle drizzle, we had a great time and enjoyed all of the sights. Alexia was really sweet in helping us organize our daily itinerary, and even spent half a day showing us around this awsome city. On our next trip to Seattle we will definitely want to stay with her again. Thank you so much for everything Alexia! You are the best!"
841049,3713624,2013-03-07,3212428,Catt,"We were due to arrive in Seattle at 11:05 p.m., and needed a quick place to sleep before heading out of the city the following morning, so we booked with Alexia and she couldn't have been  more accommodating. Her communications were excellent and prompt, she gave us clear directions, waited up for us until nearly 1 a.m., and provided us with a clean, comfortable room in a lovely apartment. Many thanks to you Alexia for making this difficult leg of the journey so easy. xxCattxx"
841049,3753867,2013-03-11,5176764,Austin,"From the moment our plane arrived to Seattle, Alexia was a wonderful host.  She graciously agreed to pick us up from a downtown light rail station, and helped orient us to the downtown and Capitol Hill areas upon arrival.  The apartment was very clean and we were quite comfortable throughout our stay.  Perhaps the best thing about staying here for us was the wonderful location -- within several blocks of excellent food, bars, coffee, etc. (on 15th and on Broadway), but also on a quiet street right next to the beautiful Volunteer Park.  Seattle is a great city, and I would highly recommend staying at Alexia's place for any visit. "
841049,3799265,2013-03-16,1985251,Richard,"We had a great experience staying with Alexia.  She was helpful and considerate, had a huge collection of very handy maps and every time we spoke to her she told us more things to do in Seattle like watching silent films at the theatre and good restaurants (and her recommendations were great!).  Her place was also clean and quiet and located in a beautiful neighbourhood close to a big park and a short bus or medium-long walk to downtown.  Thanks for having us!"
841049,3854899,2013-03-21,5062285,Eliot,"Me and my friend stayed with Alexia for 5 nights for our first trip to Seattle. This was also our first Airbnb stay. Alexia, in simple terms, is a great host. When we got there she picked up our bags from us so we could stay downtown and explore the city because it was a beautiful day out. She texted me walking directions if we wanted to enjoy the nice weather into the night. Capitol Hill is such a nice area. She is close to Broadway which is just a run of restaurants, bars and coffee shops. While we were there she informed us about some of the stuff we should do while were there. She suggested things like visiting the nearby park, going on the underground tour, and going to Silent Movie Monday at the historic Paramount...all of which were absolutely amazing. She is close enough to the city that you could walk (in nice weather), but she is just the right distance away for it to be nice and quiet. If you didn't want to walk the 49 bus is really close by (esp. if you cut through the elementary school gates) and it takes you right to 2nd and Pine (in front of Pike's Place Market). Overall, her place is clean, she helps guide you but she isn't overbearing, she is glad to help out in any way she can while you enjoy the city, and you should stay here! You will like it better than any hotel you're thinking about. "
841049,3874689,2013-03-23,5187343,Alex,"The room was good; clean, quiet, and secure. The apartment is in a nice neighborhood, and close to some friends of mine. I was there for work and out most of the day so I didn't cook or lounge. I like that no shoes are worn in the house. "
841049,3900466,2013-03-25,5533151,Patricia,Just excellent! The house was beautiful and the room was very comfortable. We had a lot of privacy as well. Alexia had her room upstairs so we felt as if we had our own appartment. Alexia was very friendly and provided us with lots of information about places to visit and restaurants. The location was also great in a very quiet street but just next to broadway - with lots of bars and restaurants - and not far from downtown. I would absolutely recommend it!
841049,3909584,2013-03-26,3394591,Jennifer,We just stayed one night on our way up to Canada from portland. The location was perfect and very walkable. Alexia was accommodating and the place was very clean. Parking on the street was limited but she did offer for us to park behind the house. We didn't spend much time in the house but she offered coffee in the am. We would come back. 
841049,3938459,2013-03-29,2581336,Bin,"Lovely place in a great neighborhood, you will enjoy Seattle even more... Was a great pleasure to meet my host who is very welcoming and will give you all the informations you might need. I recommend! Thank you Alexia: )"

She was also generous with her suggestions on where to visit around Seattle. Her place is gorgeous and the room is clean, neat and absolutely beautiful. Would definitely be back if I ever pop by Seattle again. Thanks for everything Alexia! :) "

Alexia responses quickly to all my messages and is always making sure nothing goes wrong. We feel relaxed before going to Seattle as she gets everything ready and we had no worries.

Her place is gorgeous, clean and beautiful. Spacious room, nice bed and wifi of good connection. Tidy and clean bathroom and kitchen. We think that everything is better than expected! We enjoyed much staying at her place and would definitely be back if we would be visiting Seattle again. 

Besides she is very helpful to arrange the delivery of valuables which I left in the room. We feel lucky and glad that we can get the things back eventually.

Alexia Thanks very much! =) "
841049,4339466,2013-04-29,5089775,Ronelle,Thanks Alexia. The room and bathroom were immaculately clean and having a parking space was great (since street parking can be difficult in Capitol Hill).

We had a comfortable four day stay. "
841049,4589142,2013-05-13,2275067,Ian And Michael,"Alexia was a wonderful host. She was very accommodating with flexible check in and check out time - even meeting up with us on short notice to let us drop our bags off before heading out. Room was very clean, bright, and pleasant. We actually used to live down the street in the neighborhood so knew the area well, but for those unfamiliar with Seattle, the Volunteer Park / Hilltop area is a beautiful example of gorgeous northwestern Craftsman homes and old mansions. The house is located in a quiet neighborhood next to wonderful Volunteer Park, and just a few minutes walk to all that 15th Ave offers (cafes like my favorite Remedy Teas, restaurants, etc). Another 5 minutes walk brings you to the bustling, vibrant Broadway corridor. Checkout was a breeze, and we would definitely stay here again. Thanks for the great stay."

The neighborhood is perfect.  all was perfect.  I couldn't stay my whole visit at her place, and the other place is way below alexias standards."

The room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. Alexia’s house is in a lovely part of town. There are loads of great shops and restaurants just two blocks away; beautiful Volunteer Park within walking distance; and it’s a convenient bus ride to the downtown core. Rather than staying right in the centre of downtown, check out this great neighbourhood! "

She was very friendly, and we had plenty of freedom and flexibility with our coming and going throughout our stay. The neighborhood was wonderful; only a quick walk to Broadway, where we could find everything we could need. The room is simple and clean, with nice windows to let in as much sunlight as possible."
