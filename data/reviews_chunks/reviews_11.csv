461567,2638347,2012-10-16,3837863,Rishi,"Great quiet place to stay and Donna was a great host. Very good communication throughout, and the place was as advertised. My wife and I just needed a quiet and clean place to relax for a weekend getaway and Donna's place was excellent. Close by car to everything, including Pik market and downtown Seattle (about a 10 minute drive). Close to lots of small niche restaurants as well as the mall. If you're looking for a getaway and need some peace and quiet, this is the place!"

461567,3435462,2013-01-29,4120134,Celia,"Our stay at Ballard Charm was most positive and we'd not hesitate to recommend it to others or stay there again. We particularly loved the space, cleanliness, natural light and fresh flowers. Donna could not have been more kind or accommodating. "
461567,3799460,2013-03-16,5260386,Imaan,"Donna is a lovely host! She's welcoming, helpful, and an all round wonderful host. She was very helpful in regards to recommendations. I would highly recommend Donna as a host!"

461567,4090191,2013-04-08,5768139,Daniel,"All I can say is Wow! What a great experience for us to be able to stay in Donna's beautiful space and in such a great neighborhood! Although our trip was short, I can't emphasize enough how great it was to be able to stay in the Ballard area, with beach access, good food, great views and an amazingly comfy bed to sleep in! Anyone who's looking to spend a little time in Seattle should definitely get in touch with Donna! "
461567,4101200,2013-04-09,1400551,Sue-Ting,We had a great stay with Donna. The kitchenette and sitting area were nice! I loved having a place to read that wasn't on the bed. The room was clean and everything was as promised. 
461567,4258784,2013-04-22,5881999,Jeri,"Donna was a wonderful Host!!  She was very accommodating, helpful and fun!  The suite is cute, clean and comfortable and has everything that you might need for your stay.  I felt quite at home and the area is quiet and safe.  I will be recommending the Charming Ballard Suite to all my friends!"
461567,4314017,2013-04-27,3802877,Alison,"We had a lovely time at Donna's place. She was very accommodating to our late check in time, and even left us orange juice and a pastry for the next morning! The weather was gorgeous and we were able to walk down to the park and beach. So gorgeous! Our bed was comfortable and the place was spotless. Donna was so welcoming, and check out was a breeze. Don't miss out in the great view of the mountains from the private deck upstairs!"
461567,4637067,2013-05-17,5812402,Fabio,"Had a perfect time at Bellard Charm ;)
Donna was very very nice, helpful and a super host during the whole stay! Even got orange juice, tea and fruits as a welcome-present. The place is very comfortable and clean. Also easy to reach by bus!
All in all: PERFECT!"
461567,4732485,2013-05-22,2868090,Carl,"Donna was a lovely and gracious host, and the space was private, clean and quiet. We had a great stay and would enthusiastically recommend her place to others."
461567,4970390,2013-06-04,5820436,Patrick,"Donna is a great host.  Her upstairs suite is a quiet retreat.  She's also a very interesting person and well informed about local activities.  I was only there for a long week-end, but it felt like a vacation.  I highly recommend Donna's Ballard Charm."
461567,5053137,2013-06-10,5885920,Terri,"My criteria for any lodging is ""clean, quiet, safe, and comfortable,"" and Donna's place is all of those. Because i had friends in the neighborhood with whom I planned to spend time  -- and whose houses were within walking distance of Donna's -- the location was perfect for me. Great bed, spacious bathroom, ample parking.  Donna is a kind and helpful host who accommodated my every need. Highly recommended."
461567,5212073,2013-06-18,6059480,Emma,Donna was a lovely host and her home was tidy and bright.  We were only there for a day but had a nice relaxing time.
461567,5253020,2013-06-20,6913424,Cheyenne,"So glad I chose to stay in Ballard--and Donna's lovely place is perfectly situated. Plenty of parking, great restaurants, beautiful views, a comfortable bed, plenty of privacy and space, and a gracious host. Will definitely return here on future trips. Thanks, Donna!"
461567,5439138,2013-06-30,3641369,Bec & Andy,"We really enjoyed our stay with Donna! The suite looked exactly like the photos, very homely and comfortable. We especially liked sitting at the lounge/kitchenette table, with lots of natural light and views of the mountains on a clear day.

It was only 30 min by bus to the city, and buses were very frequent. Ballard is a lovely area and we felt very safe.

Donna was very friendly and helpful, always going the extra mile to make our stay even more comfortable and easy.

We would definitely recommend her suite, and wouldn't hesitate to stay there next time we are in Seattle."
461567,5477335,2013-07-01,7011430,Van,"Great location for Ballard and Seattle activities. Donna's home is clean and bright. (Enjoyed checking out all the books!). Donna was available via phone and email before arrival, she was friendly and helpful with stay. "
461567,5498894,2013-07-02,3848237,Elizabeth,"Donna was a lovely host, and her place was comfortable and had lots of nice little touches that I enjoyed.  Even though the upper level was not totally separate from the rest of the house we felt like we had plenty of privacy, and she was very flexible about meeting up and making sure that it was cool enough for us and we had everything we needed."
461567,6148152,2013-08-01,5854359,Linda,My husband and I so enjoyed our one month stay in the Ballard Charm. Donna was a wonderful host and we found so many things we had in common. There's also a nice walk through the woods and down to the water that is very close. Grocery stores are also within walking distance. I would highly recommend Donna's contemporary suite!
461567,6300564,2013-08-07,6029972,John,"Our three-day stay in early August 2013 with Donna was our first through Airbnb and gave us a great starting point for our 15-day trip in the northwest and BC and Alberta.  We enjoyed chatting with her each day and loved the Ballard Charm for the quiet location, comfortable bed, separate kitchen and sitting area.  We thank Donna for her helpful suggestions and directions around Seattle and for making us feel at-home.  Barb and I highly recommend that others consider staying here.  They will not be disappointed."
461567,7299442,2013-09-15,6115338,Carol,"Ballard Charm was great!  Beautiful place and Donna is a real doll.  We had a great time and if we ever visit Seattle again, would definitely stay here again.  Highly recommend this place!"
461567,7793624,2013-10-03,8441575,Linda,"Our first experience with airbnb was great. The Ballard Charm-Contemporary Suite was everything it was advertised to be. Donna was very friendly and pleasant. I was amazed that the rooms looked exactly as they did in the advertisements. The location was great. Very close to where we were spending most of our time with our son and his family. We were concerned that a queen size bed would not be comfortable since we have a king size, but it was very comfortable. The only suggestion I have is that since the weather was rainy the whole time we were there, maybe if there was a more comfortable loveseat and chair to relax in rather than the wicker. (Which by the way looked very good). My husband and I will definitely try and stay there on our next trip to Seattle. "
461567,7897483,2013-10-07,4660571,Jacqlyn,"Donna was a lovely host and her room was very comfortable! Although the location was not as close to the main Ballard area as I originally understood it to be (it was about a 30 minute walk to the shops, restaurants, and bars on the main Ballard drag), I was very happy with my choice to stay here due to Donna's hospitality as well as the fact that there were other items very close to the house (grocery store, bar, coffee shop). It was about a 30 minute bus ride to downtown Seattle, which was pleasant. "
461567,8091012,2013-10-15,8802606,Rachel,Donna was a gracious host and set things up nicely for my uncle to have plenty of privacy. Home is in a nice neighborhood and very close to Ballard.
461567,8253531,2013-10-22,8576371,Jean,"Donna's B and B was very comfortable, clean and spacious. I would certainly enjoy staying there again and will recommend her place to my friends. Very nice!"
461567,8426731,2013-10-30,1552666,Cass,"This is a ""suite"" and has lots of space.  I found the bed extremely comfortable.  The living area has lots of natural light and is very cheerful.  The bathroom is really nice.  The neighborhood feels safe and the necessities are convenient.  (I didn't have a car while staying here but could walk to all I needed.) Donna is a kind and considerate hostess.  "
461567,9245438,2013-12-16,9955364,Jessica,"My experience with the Ballard Charm - Contemporary Suite was excellent!  
The suite was kept super clean and Donna was very friendly and made sure I had everything I needed.  I felt comfortable, welcome and safe.
The bed was really comfortable and I had a great sleep!  I would definitely go back and stay again in the future."
461567,9284865,2013-12-18,3365079,Eduardo,"Only stayed for one night with my girlfriend but we really enjoyed it. Donna was nice enough to give us an early check in. Her home is lovely and the suite upstairs was perfect. Comfortable bed, plenty of space, and even a little balcony. Even though we only met once Donna seemed like a very kind person to me. Overall, a great stay and I would highly recommend this suite to anybody."
461567,9424433,2013-12-28,6223581,Rosaline,What was your experience with your host? Was the listing what you expected? What was their neighborhood like?
461567,10649805,2014-03-01,6511226,Diane,Donna went beyond the call of duty when she arrived late at night when I ended up with a flat tire. I just wanted to let her know I'd be late and she wanted to make sure I was ok.Her place is delightful. Highly recommend Donna and her BnB.
461567,11614247,2014-04-09,12120141,Abbey,
461567,12020123,2014-04-21,13895176,Justin,"Wonderful neighborhood.  Donna was there for my check-in at 10pm and greeted me with a welcoming smile.  I was out late most nights in Seattle, so I didn't see Donna much.  However, her home was welcoming, clean and actually very charming.  For the price, location and space I am very happy with the Ballard Charm."
461567,12788265,2014-05-11,13956824,Angana,"Great and responsive.  For us, Donna's place was a very short drive from the heart of the city (10-15 min) in a very quiet, nice part (Ballard).  We were actually arriving kind of late, and thankfully at the moment that Donna was!  But she had made arrangements for us to get in even if she wasn't at home.  She showed us around and made sure we had everything.  Prior to arriving, she had communicated very promptly, asking us relevant questions about our check-in time, as well as responding to ours.  The place itself has a shared entrance, though stairs go up to the private suite.  It is clean, neat, and has everything you'll need.  There's even views of the mountains!  Unfortunately, we could only stay for about 12 hours before we had to catch a flight, but plan to come back to stay here if/when we visit again!  Thanks Donna for being a great host."
461567,12894208,2014-05-13,3192232,Kathleen,Donna was a wonderful host! The suite looked exactly as pictured and was super cozy. Her garden is beautiful as well. My fiance and I stayed one night and would recommend to anyone looking for a nice place. Donna left us croissants and jam which was very kind and was fine with us coming and going as we pleased. Thanks for such a great stay!
461567,13148351,2014-05-20,86631,Lori,Very prompt with communication and attentive when I was a guest.
461567,13216095,2014-05-22,14321998,Susan,"It was very nice to spend time in Donna's home.  She was very helpful with local information.  She provided not only a room, but a basic continental breakfast."
461567,13472310,2014-05-28,13265192,Suzanne,"We were extremely happy with our time at Donna's Ballard Charm rental. Excellent parking, easy in and out access, very comfy large bed, outstanding bathroom, and very serviceable kitchenette. Donna even provided the very necessary iron and ironing board. For us, the location was perfect. The view from the windows ....beautiful. We would absolutely stay here whenever we return to Seattle. "
461567,13890782,2014-06-07,15768682,Emma,"We spent one night here and it was so pleasant - very clean and spacious with a great second story view. The neighborhood was nice and calm, too, which was a relief after spending a few days close to downtown. Donna was very friendly and a great host as well. I wish we had stayed here longer than only one night!"
461567,14117805,2014-06-12,2051071,Jane,"Donna is a delightful and friendly host and we will most definitely be returning to her lovely suite next time we visit Seattle.  Communication was great, suite was spotless, neighborhood was safe and quiet.  Highly recommended!"
461567,14349039,2014-06-17,12528891,Margaret,"Donna was a great host. She asked everyday if we had everything we needed. Her house was lovely, clean,and light, which gave a feeling of spaciousness.
I will recommend this place to any friends or family who are thinking of going to Seattle.
Margaret Sweden"
461567,14479474,2014-06-20,15872683,Dave And Karen,"Donna Linn was a very gracious host! We were able to relax and prepare for a fun filled day in Seattle. The suite was wonderful! We were given the whole top floor! It was a lovely experience staying with Donna.
Dave and Karen Shaffer"
461567,14551615,2014-06-22,8341342,Jonathan,"Donna has a beaut upstairs unit located ideally for easy access to anywhere around Seattle. Donna was a wonderful and responsive host. The accommodation ticked all our boxes. A thoroughly positive experience. Pleasant, accessible, secure, comfortable and appropriately priced."
461567,14729646,2014-06-25,12427660,Karen,"We stayed three nights with our gracious host, Donna. The location was ideal for us to attend a family wedding and to tour Seattle. A quick 20 minute bus ride caught just a few blocks away got us to downtown Seattle. After our busy schedule it was wonderful to unwind in our spacious, quiet apartment. This was our first experience with Airbnb, and our stay here reassured us of using it again."
461567,14825040,2014-06-27,15236826,Lee,We enjoyed our stay here very much. Donna was a very welcome and accommodating host. The upstairs suite was well equipped and very clean. A short drive from the downtown area yet very quiet at night. Would recommend to anyone staying in Seattle! 
461567,14892242,2014-06-28,6170599,Madelyn,"My husband and I had a great stay here. The space was beautiful - very clean, bright, spacious, nicely decorated and cozy. Lots of great amenities. The Ballard neighborhood also had lots to offer, and we enjoyed being close to Carkeek Park. It is an upstairs suite with a private bathroom, bedroom, and sitting room. The sitting room is private but has an open wall into the stairwell and downstairs living room. Overall it was lovely and convenient. Fun to explore a new Seattle neighborhood!"
461567,15039200,2014-07-01,13876414,Gilbert,"My boyfriend and I went to a wedding in Woodenville, so staying at Donna's in Ballard was perfect! It was right in the center between the wedding and Downtown Seattle. 

The house itself is wonderful and the suit is very private. It's not a private entrance, but a staircase from the front door leads directly to the suit. Very comfortable bed, shower and kitchenette (compete with fridge that Donna stalked with a Brita filter and snacks!). The room is beautifully decorated and has lots of literature on Seattle and lots of fun other books and puzzles. There is also a tv, where we enjoyed a little World Cup and 30 rock before bed.

Donna is a wonderful host! She allowed us to have a late check-in seeing as out flight got in so late. She greeted us every morning in the living room and gave us lots of little travel tips. Because of her, we went to West Seattle and enjoyed beautiful views if the Seattle skyline, great lunch and enjoyed sometime on the beach. She is such a sweet person and has such great energy. 

Balled is wonderful. We had brunch at the Fat Hen and Bastilles. Ballard Ave is also a great place to hit up on he weekend and enjoy the farmers market.

This trip to Seattle made me fall in love with the place. We will definitely be back!
Gilbert "
461567,15213533,2014-07-05,2938159,Orion,"Donna's home provided my girlfriend and me with a lot of privacy and plenty of space. The porch was a great amenity and we wish we could have used it more. Overall, it felt like renting a full, private apartment. Donna was quick to respond and flexible with our check-in time. We would definitely recommend!

*Do note that this listing is in a residential neighborhood, but as long as you have access to a car it's easy to get pretty much anywhere in Seattle. There is more than enough extra parking in front of the house."
461567,15265969,2014-07-06,10377062,Chris,"Donna was very friendly, helpful and welcoming.
Nice quiet neighbourhood to stroll around in, and a close walk to shops."
461567,15482046,2014-07-10,423381,Lynne,"Enjoyed my stay.  Very quiet and clean -  easy parking is a plus. Nice view of the Olympics, too!"
461567,17050346,2014-08-06,16856426,Jeffrey,"Donna provided a great space for us to stay while we were visiting our family nearby. It is very light and comfortable. She has all the personal care products available. Donna is very friendly.  We did not spend much time with her because we were busy with our family. She did tell us about a great little hike to the waterfront thru the forest. Thanks Donna.
 We will be back."
461567,17285521,2014-08-10,8355353,Dan,"My wife and I chose to stay at Ballard Charm for our wedding night.  It was a lovely suite in a beautiful part of the city.  Donna was warm and accommodating, even when all of my groomsmen showed up at her front door to take pictures!  I recommend staying here."
461567,17332572,2014-08-11,12930617,Jim,"Very nice room, helpful and pleasant host. Hope to be able to stay longer next time."
461567,17626272,2014-08-15,17123692,Pedro,"Donna is a great Host, very helpfull and friendly, we loved his house and his Cat Stella! The suite have everything you could need in a trip, way better than a hotel. The neightbourhod is great, have subway, safeway, restaurants, etc.   Downtown is 15-20 minutes using the bus, very easy. The city is great, many things to see! My wife and i loved all, i am sure we gonne be back if possible."
461567,17688767,2014-08-16,13143264,Deborah,"Donna's space for us was lovely...lots of room and we had the top floor to ourselves. It was a lovely neighbourhood and suited us driving north to Canada the next day, and avoiding Seattle rush hour traffic. It was such a clean, well organised space that we relaxed as soon as we arrived. There was easy access to downtown even though we preferred to drive in. Donna was so friendly and made us feel very welcome. Thank you Donna!"
461567,17938962,2014-08-19,17077837,Mark,"This was my first Airbnb experience. The directions to the location were accurate and helpful. There is a large parking area at the house off the street. 
Donna L, my host, was looking out for me at arrival time, came out to greet me, then showed me around the upstairs floor I would occupy. She later brought up a welcoming snack as I was settling in.
Throughout, there are plenty of household supplies for the kitchen and bath areas. There is lots of seating space at the dining table, the rattan divan and swivel chair. The bedroom and walk-through closet are spacious. Two people would be quite comfortable sharing the bath area with a large L-shaped counter, the bed, bedroom and kitchenette/sitting rooms.
There are sufficient lamps for close reading, interesting books and magazines, a small TV and music system, WiFi is provided and art covers all the walls. Large windows looked out from the dining and bedroom spaces towards the mountains and sunsets. All the rooms have easy to open windows and blinds for a bright, airy atmosphere.
Donna gave me a key to the house, and I  came and went as needed. She  offered suggestion for nearby eating, and there are fast foods or small restaurants as well as two grocery stores within an easy 5-10 minute walk. A sports fields and park area are 2 short blocks away which provide a large outdoors space for exercise or play. The overall neighborhood area is comfortably quiet.
The Ballard section of Seattle is neighborhood after neighborhood with many unique retail/restaurants and without the cookie-cutter, strip shopping of many large cities. Donna directed me to a huge park and sandy beach area on Puget Sound just a 10-15 minute drive from her house. With the water that close you might awaken one morning to the sound of a fog horn in the distance as I did. There was much to like in this part of Seattle and Donna's home was a comfortable base from which to explore.   

"
461567,18477651,2014-08-27,17736946,Janie,"Donna was waiting for us in her garden when we arrived.  what a wonderful space!  we loved the separate space with so much room!  This was the perfect home base to explore Seattle.  The space was even better than the listing, immaculate with a lovely view from the roof top deck.  Next trip to Seattle will bring us back to Donna  She gave us a great dinner recommendation that made a very memorable evening for us.  "
461567,18653884,2014-08-30,15246295,Carmen,"We had a pleasant stay at Donna's suite. She was very accommodating about our late arrival time, making it easy and flexible for us. The suite itself was cosy, tidy and clean.  "
461567,18741913,2014-08-31,16804510,Susanna,"We had a very nice stay. The suite is clean, bright, and cozy. We found the bed very comfortable and it was very quiet at night so we slept even better than at home! The location is convenient for getting in and out of downtown Seattle and of course the Ballard area. Donna is a great host and we would definitely stay here again."
461567,18874736,2014-09-02,15767712,David,Simple :great place very nice and neat and great host and 1/2 to 45 minutes to the center of the city
461567,18950256,2014-09-03,139935,Jessica,"We just stayed one night with Donna, but it was great! Very quiet and inviting. The space is filled with light and has a nice little patio for morning coffee. Ballard has a lot of cute little shops and restaurants that we visited during our stay. "
461567,19106670,2014-09-06,7694930,Nadia,"We had a great stay with Donna! The suite was roomy, comfortable, and clean with a nice outdoor deck. Donna was even kind enough to accommodate our 1.5 year old son in her backyard so he could stretch his legs after the drive back from the San Juan Islands. The location is great, convenient to downtown and other attractions around the city. Thanks for being such a great host, Donna! "
461567,19179833,2014-09-07,3953215,Rebekah,"Donna was a lovely host. She made an exception for our two young children which we really appreciated.  The space was sunny, clean and adequately furnished. The bed was very comfortable with great bedding.  
The ""living room"" of the space is a loft on the upper level of her house with the stairs opening into the room and no door separating the two dwellings.  There is a door that closes for the bedroom however.
The neighborhood is well kept houses, quiet, off a busier main street.  Within walking distance to some stores and food places.

"
461567,19758203,2014-09-17,21115825,Raven,"This is a lovely little suite that is the entire second floor of Donna's house. It has a comfortable bed, a nice sitting area with a porch, and a private bathroom with a very nice  shower! The house is in a great location, it is an easy 5 minute drive to all the shops and bars in Ballard and also an easy 20 minute walk to a sweet little park on the beach. Donna was warm and welcoming in getting us settled and was a very gracious host. Although we only stayed one short night, it was a great experience and I would be happy to stay here again!"
461567,20242864,2014-09-26,20643007,Max,"The second floor of the house where we stayed was kept very clean. The photo description is very accurate. It is in a very quiet neighborhood north of Ballard. If one has a car, it's fairly easy to get to anywhere. Donna was very helpful with suggestions on what to do around the Ballard area, and she struck a nice balance of making sure we were comfortable and giving us room to do things on our own. It was a very pleasant stay for me and my son and I think our impression of Seattle was positively influenced as a result."
461567,20781799,2014-10-05,7136325,Danielle,"Donna was a fantastic host! She was accommodating around check in/out times, and made sure we had everything we needed.  We didn't get to enjoy the place as much as we would like, we mostly just slept between our adventures.  The place was clean, the bed was comfy, it was just what we needed!

The only slightly unexpected part is that there is no door at the top of the stairs. The bedroom and bathroom have a door, but the kitchen area is kind of open into the rest of the house. "
461567,20881401,2014-10-06,22006064,Robin,"Donna was very communicative and there to greet us when we arrived.  She was warm and accommodating and gave us options to coming and going so that we were comfortable.  The space was lovely and clean,  and the bed was very comfortable! We will definitely return when in the area!  Thank you Donna for everything! :)"
461567,21214457,2014-10-13,10673243,Emma,"Donna was a lovely and understanding host! I didn't spend too much time at the residence, but the time I did spend there was peaceful and rejuvenating. My only complaint was that this space was listed as an ""entire home/apt"" while it was actually just the upstairs of Donna's house. I had more space than a single private room, but arrived expecting this to be separate from her house. My stay was lovely, I just think it should be categorized differently. If it was truly an ""entire home,"" I wouldn't hear another person cooking, listening to the radio, and wouldn't feel as though I would bother her coming in and out at different times of day."
461567,22096857,2014-10-30,16094482,Art,Donna is an excellent host and offers a clean and comfortable suite. We highly recommend her B&B. The only improvement is to tapper off the October rain a bit. 
461567,23777161,2014-12-09,13358021,Susan,"Ballard Charm was lovely and well described.  It was a perfect little apartment for my stay while visiting friends in the area.  The bed is very comfortable and the place is clean and spacious with lots of books and local information available.
It was easy to communicate with Donna and though I didn't meet her in person, I felt welcome in her space.  She even left gluten free muffins for me each evening, a lovely and delicious surprise!
I would highly recommend staying at Ballard Charm when visiting Seattle."
461567,24008801,2014-12-16,336565,Jim,"Our experience with Donna and staying at her place was excellent. Donna is a warm and wonderful host and we highly recommend staying at her place. The suite itself is very clean and well presented. The description is accurate. The bed is comfortable.There is a lovely view looking west towards the Olympics. The walk down to the beach is recommended. The neighbourhood is quiet and friendly, and central Ballard is approximately two miles south. We will definitely be back again!"
461567,24248077,2014-12-23,13285447,Nhan,"The suite is beautiful, lots of sunshine and Donna has prepared everything to make the stay comfortable. She is also very friendly and welcoming. Highly recommended."
461567,24441041,2014-12-28,24716111,Pete,"Donna was an incredibly pleasant and courteous host, with a lovely home. She was in constant communication due to a complicated key exchange scenario, and was always flexible despite it being Christmas. 

The apartment was exactly as it was described in the listing. Upon arrival everything was clean and in place. Rather than just handing over a key and a list of instructions, she gave us a full tour and rundown. She offered to provide breakfast, showed us tea and coffee, and was just wonderful about everything. 

The bed was comfy, a private bathroom is very nice, and even on a rainy December day the view is still nice. Highly recommend spending sometime at Donna's charming Ballard home :)"
461567,24587237,2014-12-31,10815393,Sally,"Wonderful experience with good location, great room and wonderful landlord! Thanks Donna"
461567,24693479,2015-01-01,12133535,Myray,"Donna greeted us even though we came in late, with a smile. She made us feel at home by giving us coffee cake for the morning and tea and coffee. We had the whole upstairs to ourself, which looked out to a beautiful view. The location was perfect for us as well, a short drive to the downtown Ballard neighborhood. I would stay here again. "
461567,25335012,2015-01-12,1813477,Diana & Jim,"I enjoyed my quick stay at Donna's. She was a gracious host and made me feel at home immediately. The space was ideal for my needs and my only regret was that I did not get to see the view of the Olympic mountains from the window due to the weather.

I primary need was a quiet comfortable place to stay for the night that had both a wireless connection and a TV (to watch the Seahawks). The bedroom was comfortable and I got a good night's sleep which I sorely needed. 

The private bath was awesome, plenty of space and the entire suite was clean and friendly. I would recommend this space."
461567,25427288,2015-01-15,6356061,Virginia,Host was great!
461567,25728591,2015-01-24,23631632,Bev,"Donna met us at her home at the agreed time. We spent time sharing common experiences of having lived in Poland in the early to mid-90's. The apartment was as described -- the second floor of her home. It was comfortable, clean and had everything we needed for our brief stay. We enjoyed the stay and highly recommend Donna's place.  "
461567,25880238,2015-01-28,15636376,Pepi,Our host was very welcoming and the location was as expected. The premises was clean and well kept.
461567,26898799,2015-02-21,25096802,Alyson,Donna had a great place for us to stay! Lovely neighbourhood and home. Bed was very comfortable and Donna was very friendly and helpful with suggestions and maps of the city!
461567,27886387,2015-03-14,19695775,Nora,Great space! 
461567,28447863,2015-03-23,29475994,Rich,"First time visit to Seattle.  Loved the character of the town of Ballard and Donna's place is a little gem in a quiet neighborhood.  Thanks, Donna for your travel tips and food/restaurant intel!    "
461567,29666928,2015-04-11,27598119,Rachel,"From my husband, Zeph: ""Donna was wonderful. The lodgings she provided were gorgeous and comfortable.. it was just really nice!""

From me: Yup. Agreed on all counts. Donna was very welcoming, and really made us feel at home. We had some non-standard questions and requests, and she made it easy to sort everything out.

The accomodations were exactly as pictured, and there were a number of artful touches that I thought were really cool.

The bathroom is great (lots of counter space). Easy to get more anything (e.g. towels, toilet paper) if you need it--it's right there, no need to bother anyone.

The bed is very comfortable if you like firmer beds; the mattress is in good shape. It was easy to get a good night's sleep--not like hotels, where there's noisy neighbors to all sides and thin walls. /Plenty/ of space for two people, and as there's a door between the sitting area and the bedroom (and /two/ entrances to the bathroom), if you and your roommate are keeping slightly different hours, no worries.

Peaceful neighborhood (convenient to restaurants and groccery stores, as well as drug stores and etc.), plenty of parking, and easy entry and exit without worrying that you'll wake your host. We drove often to both the north and south, and it was quite convenient (though make sure the Alaskan Way Viaduct isn't closed before you head out if you're going south--and make use of the HOV lanes going either way if you can!).

Fair warning: garbage may be handled differently than you're used to if you aren't from the Seattle area. Donna will give you the run-down when you arrive, but make sure you ask any questions you have before you start generating any.

We had a long stay (more than two weeks), and everything was great. I highly recommend staying here."
461567,29872319,2015-04-13,30299727,Anne,"We were running around with some friends that lived in the area during most of our visit. Donna was very responsive to emails and very friendly and helpful when we talked in the mornings. 

The description of the listing was accurate. The view from the room and deck was beautiful! We took the wooded trail to the beach one morning. It was a great way to start the day!"
461567,30265568,2015-04-19,29590276,Gerd,We appreciated Donna's hospitality and welcome.  Our stay was enjoyable and restful in her clean and tidy home.  Thank you so much
461567,30582669,2015-04-24,29590276,Gerd,Donna is a gracious host.
461567,30814472,2015-04-27,30978983,Denny,"Donna was friendly and very helpful with various aspects of our stay from letting us check in a bit early to giving helpful information about how to work locks/keys, etc.   The unit was very comfortable for our two night stay and Donna had the placed well stocked with linens, towels, shampoo, tea, and other items that made our stay delightful.  The location in the Ballard area was perfect for driving into the city of Seattle which only took 15-20 minutes.  The view of the Olympic mountains to the west was very beautiful and there was a nice park with trails within a 15 minute walk.  It was a great experience and we definitely look forward to staying there again in the future.   Denny and Ellen Stucke."
461567,31932201,2015-05-12,665653,Valentine,Donna was great and discrete. She gives us tips that we appreciated. Everything was clean and the place was very peaceful. All that we needed as we just landed in Seattle. Thanks!
461567,32504919,2015-05-19,4375550,Ali,Donna was a lovely host. The photos and description were accurate and we were very comfortable during our stay. I would definitely recommend this rental to friends. 
461567,33499399,2015-05-29,3861251,Scout,We loved staying at this house! It was easy to get to all the main attractions and that house was just as it is shown in the pictures! Everything we needed was provided. 
461567,35085173,2015-06-15,11977425,Lesley,"We had a wonderful weekend stay at Donna's apartment in Ballard.  The apartment was very clean and contained everything we needed for our visit - a tea kettle, coffee pot, adorable balcony for morning / evening relaxation, and a comfortable bed / well-equipped bathroom.  We were up and out early each day and back late each night, but never felt like we were intruding or making too much noise as Donna had very nicely blocked off the front entrance from her main home to accommodate and encourage quiet coming and going.  Donna was very easy to communicate with via Airbnb, as well.  I would highly recommend staying in her apartment... the price for the accommodation and location was excellent!  Thanks for a great stay, Donna."
461567,36000001,2015-06-24,25957450,Laurie,"Lovely, quiet residential area close to major bus lines.  No car needed to get to all the sights we wanted to see and experience.  Donna was very welcoming and accommodating to our needs. Easy access to the sunny and comfortable upstairs suite, including the outdoor patio where we enjoyed the sunset each evening of our stay.  "
461567,37129251,2015-07-05,20147567,Sonja,"Wir haben uns bei Donna sehr wohl gefühlt. Das Ballard Charm ist ein guter Ausgangspunkt um die Stadt Seattle zu erkunden. Donna hat in ihrem Appartment alle Informationen, die man benötigt, um direkt nach Ankunft eine Stadtbesichtigung zu unternehmen.
Die Wohngegend ist sehr ruhig und man kann fußläufig ein gutes Pub erreichen."
461567,37638549,2015-07-09,13794986,Tong,"We stayed three nights at Donna's house and it's too short we will definitely come back again!

The place was super comfortable! The room has a very good layout, bright, clean, and you have everything you need Donna prepare everything for you!

We enjoyed been there and thank you Donna, we see you next year."
461567,37833542,2015-07-11,4909367,Erin,"Donna welcomed us warmly when we arrived and gave us a brief tour. We were under the impression (from the listing) that this is a full apartment, separate from Donna's house - it is not. The space is basically the second floor of her home and is open, overlooking the entryway. That was a surprise to us, and not a welcome one. Additionally, if you are allergic to cats you may have issues here. While the cat is not in the rented space, the dander and odors waft up from the downstairs area. Otherwise, the bed and shower are clean, and the location is very good (close to Carkeek Park and in lovely Ballard). "
461567,38277024,2015-07-14,16964424,Frances,"Ballard Charm was indeed charming and our host, Donna, was lovely.  The suite was roomy with a view, well equipped and comfortable.  Walking trails to the beach near by and many conveniences including pubs and restaurants.  Rapid ride bus service into downtown Seattle easily accessible.  Really enjoyed our stay."
461567,39928315,2015-07-27,696950,Christine,Donna was really friendly and hospitable. We felt welcomed and at home. Communication was very smooth. Would love to visit again!
461567,40245162,2015-07-29,3310343,Candice,"Donna was a wonderful host and greeted us when we arrived with a brief tour of the place.  She even let us check-in one hour early.  Her place was close to Carkeek Park which has nice running trails and is about 20 minutes from downtown so made it easy to get around.  Since her place is listed as being an entire home, we were surprised that we had a shared entryway and some open spaces.  However, it was clean and we did have the entire top floor to ourselves."
461567,42274261,2015-08-12,1980431,Antonella,"L'appartamento è grande e luminoso, completo di ogni confort  e Donna è stata molto gentile e disponibile. La casa si trova in una zona molto tranquilla, è a circa 20 minuti di autobus dal centro città e la fermata dell'autobus è a soli 5 minuti a piedi, molto comodo! Grazie ancora a Donna per la sua ospitalità e gentilezza!"
461567,43237162,2015-08-18,2770591,Suzanne,Donna was an excellent host. She made sure we had everything we needed and checked in with us about our stay. The house is in a great location for folks without a vehicle. We took public transportation everywhere in Seattle and that worked out well for us. Ballard charm was certainly charming and so was Donna!
461567,43899969,2015-08-23,28953852,Dan,Nice place to stay if you are looking for somewhere quiet. Neighbourhood is also very quiet but within walking distance of a secluded beach. Donna made us feel very welcome and we had some good chats with her - even treated us to a very nice breakfast! 
461567,44333158,2015-08-25,30299103,Philip,"We enjoyed our stay. Quiet neighborhood, comfortable room. Donna was very kind and welcoming. Be aware that the only truly private area is the bedroom (it's a private room/private bathroom with an open kitchen. While you are in the kitchen you can hear conversations downstairs/smell what's in the cooking downstairs). Nonetheless the apartment is comfortable and Donna made us feel at home. "
461567,50791416,2015-10-14,36143669,Juandalyn,"I had the most wonderful time! My stay exceeded my expectations. Not only was this a quiet place for me to stay and write for my exams, but Donna (the host) was so pleasant and welcoming! I truly felt comfortable and at home. The upstairs space (which was like a mini apartment) was closed off from the rest of the house so I had all the privacy I needed. There were also great views of the mountains, lots of food options around Ballard including grocery stores, good options for taking a walk/hike such as Golden Gardens Park, and right near the bus line taking you directly into downtown Seattle. I was very pleased with my stay! I would recommend this wonderful space to anyone visiting Seattle!!"
461567,52271746,2015-10-27,11103631,Rachel,"Ballard Charm was just as charming as it looks. Donna was a wonderful host – responsive and welcoming! I had a hectic schedule and she was more than happy to let me check in a few hours early. She even greeted me at the door and gave me suggestions of things to do around town, as this was my first trip to Seattle. The space is lovely, clean and cozy, with a super comfortable bed, plenty of bathroom counter space and lots of light throughout. I would absolutely recommend staying here on your next Seattle trip – I'll definitely be back! "
461567,55214959,2015-11-29,20039403,Jonathan,"She was very responsive and welcoming. She was very kind and relatable. 

This place was very nice and cozy. it was well-organized and prepared to welcome us! Also, Neighborhood was very quite and seemed safe."
461567,56543866,2015-12-14,4546371,Gus,"Donna's place in Ballard is wonderful!  Everything you could ever want in an AirBnB experience.  The room is set up perfectly with a private kitchenette and bath, views and fabulous location.  We will definitely stay again sometime and highly recommend it for anyone visiting the Seattle area and visiting Ballard in particular."

Eric was very kind and flexible with us with our arrival- which I greatly appreciated! It's a great location, a quiet neighborhood yet still close to many great Seattle attractions! "
6445769,34881297,2015-06-13,4771548,Gap,"Eric was conscientious about communicating and made my friend feel very welcome in his clean and spacious apartment.    He went out of his way to be accommodating, a great experience for Jim who experienced airbnb for the first time!"
6445769,35235797,2015-06-16,33687929,Tom,"Eric & Medha are fantastic hosts.  This place was perfect for the four of us.  What a jewel the Greenwood neighborhood turned out to be.  If I lived in Seattle, it's where I would reside. It's a snap to get downtown on bus #5 on Greenwood Ave (you don't even have to change buses and only $2.50/pp, $1.50 18 & under).  This neighborhood is very peaceful.  Friendly neighbors.  Great parks nearby including a huge lake aptly named Green Lake.  There are Seattle magazines laid out for you to review.  These hosts are very responsive when answering questions.  We really enjoyed Seattle, the space needle, duck tour (amphibious car/boat ride on Lake Union and around downtown), underground tour, Pike's market, Pioneer square, the sunsets and of course, the amazing Orca Tour (embarks out of Anacortes).  Additionally, you can walk to neighborhood restaurants, a safeway market is close by and there is a fantastic place called Bluebird with home-made ice cream (they even make the waffle cones fresh).  You can't go wrong with this place!  It was our first AirBnB experience and it will certainly not be our last.  We're already planning our next trip.  Thank you Eric & Medha!

6445769,35687684,2015-06-21,34014085,Ron,Brand new beautiful and spacious apt. in fun and eclectic NW Seattle neighborhood.  The apt. was clean and nice.  Thank you for hosting and providing such great accommodations. 
6445769,36313892,2015-06-27,967130,Ana,"Eric was great throughout the process.  His place is quite, brand new in a fun and cute neighborhood with lots of good eateries nearby.  It was perfect for our travel needs to Seattle."
6445769,36688303,2015-06-30,17929113,Jessica,"Eric was very easy to communicate with and made our stay at his basement apartment so a pleasant experience. My friends and I would definitely stay again, it was such a cute space and in a great neighborhood! Very easy to get around the city from its location or if you wanted to stay in the surrounding neighborhoods, you would absolutely find the most charming shops and restaurants. "
6445769,36923971,2015-07-02,182381,David,"Be very careful with Airbnb listings. The reservation with ""1000 sq ft Modern Lower-level , entire home/apt and two "" was really a large basement with one bed-room, and a hide-bed in the living room.  
While the owners if the property are a very nice couple, the description should be accurate. My daughter mentioned to the owner the concern about proper descriptions  and he said he'll edit the description. Unfortunately, the bathroom had to be cleaned twice following our complaint. Unfortunately no basic cookware, pots, skillets or pans were available to prepare breakfast. We had to ask for tea kettle for a cup of coffee.  No TV cable just some flickering images to watch."
6445769,37476677,2015-07-07,6582002,Julia,Overall we had a fine experience.
6445769,38276312,2015-07-14,33519950,Christina,"We had a wonderful stay at Eric and Medha's home in Seattle. The location was perfect, it was very close to downtown. The home was beautiful and clean. Eric and Medha were wonderful hosts. They were great communicators and made the process very smooth and easy. I look forward to coming back!"
6445769,39012461,2015-07-20,216170,Marylouise,We had a lovely time at Eric and Medha's! If we ever get back to Seattle we'd love to stay with them again.
6445769,39650085,2015-07-25,14811093,Marcia Shan,"A friend and I spent 4 nights in late July at Eric and Medha’s lovely and comfortable apartment in their Northwest Seattle home.  It was wonderful to also have use of their patios.  We really enjoyed being in a neighborhood in which one felt a sense of community and that had restaurants, shops, coffee shops, public transportation, Green Lake, and Woodland Park all either walkable or a short drive away.  From their home there is also easy access to both I-5 and Aurora Avenue (a major north south arterial).

Eric and Medha were extremely hospitable, gracious, and helpful.  Eric initiated contact a couple times the week before our arrival to see if we had any questions or if there was anything we would like information about and he was exceptionally considerate to call us the day before we arrived to tell us we could get into the apartment earlier than scheduled due to a change in their booking the night before our arrival. They were readily available and quickly responsive when we had a couple questions during our stay. 

Thanks, Eric and Medha, for all your contributions to a wonderful Seattle stay!  I will certainly recommend your apartment to any friends who may be coming your way.

6445769,40344163,2015-07-30,1687146,Jeff,"Our check-in process was super smooth and we absolutely loved our place!! I would highly recommend staying at Eric's place, it's in a great location and super close to wonderful coffee (caffe vita), food, and drinks!"
6445769,41208153,2015-08-05,9272590,Laura,"PROS: Great neighborhood, spacious place, clean, owners are great with communication and attentive to guests (they remedied a minor issue immediately). Would be good for travelers not planning to make meals at home given that, as others note, there are restaurants and cafes in walking distance. 

CONS: The kitchen is really more of a kitchenette. There is no stove/oven, despite one being shown in an outdated photo, which is a crucial piece of information for families hoping to make some meals in. There is a full set of flatware, dishes, mugs, and glasses, but otherwise there is no cookware, cooking utensils, or food preparation equipment, and no condiments or staple ingredients.

EDIT: The photo with the stove/oven has been replaced with an accurate photo, and it is noted in the caption that there is no range and only a toaster oven. This could be noted in the overall description as well where it mentions the kitchen space.  "
6445769,41348092,2015-08-07,34065214,Eric,"
Eric and Mehta were friendly and welcoming.  The apartment was clean and spacious.  Location was perfect for us.  "
6445769,42299548,2015-08-12,37883145,Brydgett,"The apartment was perfect for our family.  Great space, comfortable and nice extra touches.  There were restaurants within walking distance and it was just a quick Uber ride downtown.  After 7 days on the road, it was great to have a washer and dryer available.  We appreciated the extra fan for the evening but it cooled off so it really wasn't an issue.  Thanks so much!"
6445769,42702853,2015-08-15,37190424,Silvio,Eric and his wife have an amazing home in a great part of town. They made our arrival easy and the apartment looked great. The neighborhood has many great restaurants and bars as well as is just a few driving minutes from downtown. We had an amazing time and highly recommend this beautiful home. 
6445769,43044079,2015-08-17,8333573,Donald,"Terrific location, great hosts and perfect for a Seattle visit !"
6445769,43518918,2015-08-20,19308170,Chris,"This was a wonderful space in a great neighborhood! I stayed at Eric's place with 2 friends, and truly enjoyed the apartment. We had no glitches, even though our plane was delayed from Boston and we arrived at about 2:30 am. It was great meeting Eric, and this was perfect for our purposes. Very close to awesome coffee shops and other attractions!! One caveat: the pull out sofa is a typical pull out sofa bed.
- Molly, Sue, and Chris"
6445769,44316600,2015-08-25,38518043,Ellyn,We were impressed by how clean the apartment was.  The neighborhood was perfect for our needs.  
6445769,44542660,2015-08-27,3125940,Elaine,"Eric stayed in constant communication with us to make sure we had everything we needed, including a tea set I requested for my mother who was travelling with me. Very accomodating host!

We stayed in the lower unit of Eric's property. It was a very clean and modern unit, complete with a spacious kitchen. We had a party of four, so two of us slept in the bedroom and two of us slept on the sofa bed. Bathroom was well stocked with all the amenities. Location of property was very close to restaurants and other attractions. Street parking only, but not hard to find at all."
6445769,45373303,2015-09-02,15771559,Barbara,"Daniel was an excellent host, taking care to be sure he could greet us on our arrival. He had helpful suggestions and made himself available to answer any questions we might have. The basement suite was comfortable and restful. The bed was very comfortable and the pull-out couch mattress was comfortable when laid flat on the floor. The kitchen is set up well for breakfasts and heating prepared foods. What we liked best about the suite is its location. It's in a great walking neighborhood close to good restaurants. We were most interested in leaving our car parked exploring Seattle by bike. We could get to Ballard and Fremont in ten minutes, and our ride to the Public Market downtown was 30 minutes. The bike path system in Seattle is an excellent way to get around."
6445769,46719965,2015-09-13,35907161,Ben,"Awesome place to stay just north of Fremont. Eric was really easy to communicate with, I'd recommend it to anyone. "

The apartment was immaculately clean and exactly what I needed for my stay in Seattle.  The location is in a quiet neighborhood, but also a short walk from coffee shops, restaurants, and a supermarket.  Highly recommended."

6445769,48301019,2015-09-25,31283873,Kasie,"Eric and Medha were wonderful hosts during our trip to Washington despite one hiccup. When we first arrived, the apartment had not yet been cleaned. As soon as Eric received notice from us he quickly worked on finding out a solution - he and Medha even cleaned the apartment themselves after coming back from their honeymoon (although we did clean it when we showed up). Not even that - they refunded us our first night's fee, which we felt was an appropriate settlement and we greatly appreciated. Beyond that - they gave us great dining and sightseeing suggestions, the apartment was modern and located in a quiet neighborhood, yet it was not too far away from downtown Seattle. If you have  4 guests, prepare to have 2 sleep on the pull-out couch. Not the comfiest in the world, but if you are tired from a fun time in the area, it doesn't even phase you :)

Thank you, Eric and Medha! Best wishes in your marriage and AirBNB venture!"
6445769,49005808,2015-09-30,39301223,Brian,"Eric's place was fantastic! The apartment was spacious, clean, and comfortable. The neighborhood had great restaurants, bars, and shops. My wife and I are looking forward to returning."
6445769,51186012,2015-10-18,26553244,Todd,"Thanks Eric - if in need again for the area I will look forward to joining.

6445769,54626861,2015-11-22,46935945,Sajjad,"Didn't have a great experience at this place - had to shift my family to another one. The beds are not comfortable at all, especially the one in the living room. No cooking facility - though Eric tried to make that up by bringing us a stove but didn't work out. No refilling of the washroom accessories or cleaning throughout our stay, though we were told that it will be done during the middle of our stay. Overall quite bad experience and wouldn't recommend to a family with young children. "
6445769,55256465,2015-11-29,21683437,Lei,Eric was great. Very responsive and really nice. We had a great stay!
6445769,56385509,2015-12-13,20179861,David,"Eric and Medha were very accommodating. The place was cozy, clean, and modern, in a convenient spot in the neighborhood of Greenwood. We really enjoyed our stay overall. The only thing I would add is that the apartment doesn't have any drawers or any way to hang or store your belongings, less important for short term stays however."
6445769,56703400,2015-12-16,50648443,Colin,Eric was a great host helped me out a lot
2020505,10438748,2014-02-18,5959103,Douglas N Nancy,"This is a delightful home, the apartment is very private the furnishings are all top quality. The bed is very, very comfortable and spacious. The hosts made every effort to make us feel welcome the experience was excellent from start to finish. The location is perfect if you are interested in downtown Seattle, the University district or West Seattle these are only minutes away. Freeway access is also with a few minutes so the location could not be better in our estimation. The neighborhood is whisper quiet and charming with great walking and many restaurants and stores in the Queen Anne district within min. driving or walking. We would for sure stay here again in the future. This home is a super experience with gracious hosts that will cater to your needs, provide nice breakfast choices, fine beverages and privacy if you desire. While we did not require their assistance with Seattle knowledge I'm sure they have a wealth of knowledge to share should you need it. "
2020505,10480952,2014-02-21,7723732,Polly,"I love Trish and Patrick's place. It's located in a beautiful neighborhood in upper Queen Anne. It's a gorgeous home with beautiful accommodations for Airbnb guests. Super clean, comfortable and inviting—heated bathroom floors, nice towels and linens. There is also a wonderful little TV room. They also provided breakfast fixings, wine, and just a lot of nice touches. 
I highly recommend and I hope to return!

"
2020505,10683017,2014-03-03,4227321,Katherine,"Patrick and Trish's place is beautiful!! Clean, spacious and has all the extras (track lighting, a heated bathroom floor, surround sound stereo in every room, snacks, coffee and beer in fridge). Plus the bed is enormous! What a luxury to stay in, is even better in person. Patrick was welcoming and accommodating to our late evening arrival and flexible to a late check out. We will certainly be staying here again. Thanks Patrick and Trish. 
"
2020505,10867269,2014-03-10,12780691,Sally,Exceeded our expectations in all aspects. Both the hosts and the accommodations were very charming and thoughtful. We would definitely visit again and would not hesitate to recommend to others.
2020505,11112704,2014-03-21,8096238,John,"Trisha and Patrick were completely accommodating. We arrived to a beautiful house and received a warm welcoming. Everything was even nicer than the pictures. The house was spotless but still really inviting. Trisha made sure we had any incidentals that we might need. (Can we say delicious pastries and wine!) They helped us out with directions to places they recommended around town and even let us borrow their umbrella for the stay. The bed was so comfy it almost made it hard to get up and go to the great restaurants and coffee shops nearby...I said almost. With the cold Seattle mornings the heated bathroom floors were also a great touch. All in all, the whole experience was great and we would not hesitate to use them on our next Seattle trip."
2020505,12015956,2014-04-21,8712437,Adam,"Patrick and Trish's beautiful craftsman on the top of Queen Anne Hill is by far the best experience have had using AirBnb. The apartment is very comfortable, conveniently located and Patrick and Trish are incredible hosts. Patrick and Trish's spot will always be my first choice to stay, whenever traveling to Seattle."
2020505,12337642,2014-04-29,13054721,Carolyn,"Trish and Patrick provide a unique Seattle experience. If you love Craftsman style homes, this is your neighborhood. The sweet suite provided is filled with amenities which, prior to our visit, we didn't know we needed! Such things as heated floors and towel racks in the beautiful, spacious bathroom were a delightful surprise. The luscious bedding and wonderful mattress made napping a favored activity during our Seattle adventure. Art work, books, and other special appointments found in the suite made our stay in Seattle rejuvenating and relaxing. Topping the list are the friendly owners, Pat and Trish, who invited us into their home space for cocktails and talk. This place is definitely worth the little bit extra in $. Thank you Trish and Patrick. We hope you come visit us in Chico someday."
2020505,12483450,2014-05-04,11076916,Janis,"My daughter and I had a wonderful, relaxing stay. Patrick and Trish we so accommodating from the kitchen stocked with breakfast items and a delicious bottle of wine to comfortable patio chairs to enjoy the 70+ degree evenings. The suite had everything we needed and was sparkling clean and beautifully appointed. We would definitely stay again!"
2020505,12935277,2014-05-14,415433,Dave,Patrick and Trish were great hosts.  We enjoyed wine on the front porch and the house is perfectly appointed.  We used to live in the neighborhood and could not have asked for a better experience or location.
2020505,13030978,2014-05-18,4190379,Rita,We cannot say enough wonderful things about these hosts and their accommodations in Seattle.  Their guest suite was completely done for your comfort.  Everything was spotlessly clean yet inviting and comfortable. Our hosts were just so friendly and made sure that we were comfortable.  They had left breakfast items and snacks that were thoughtful and much appreciated. The wonderful visit that we had in Seattle was just made more spectacular by the hosts. We would not hesitate to book again and they are the reason we look to airbnb rather than traditional  hotels. 
2020505,13344015,2014-05-26,9349800,Peronel,"We had a lovely stay with Trish and Patrick. They were superb hosts, even offering to drive us to the airport should our booked car not arrive, and the guest suite was beautiful - very peaceful, with a really comfortable bed and everything we could need. We loved the neighbourhood, and the great selection of restaurants within a few minutes walk. We didn't hire a car, but found the bus to downtown very easy and convenient - it's also walkable. We left wishing we had more time to spend there. "
2020505,13566641,2014-05-31,13548228,Lance,A great beginning to a long vacation. Our first airbnb booking and it was amazing. A highly recommended accommodation and very close to everything downtown. We'll be back next time in Seattle!!
2020505,13840969,2014-06-06,5188878,Carole,The hosts were very nice and helpful. The problem was that there was a terrible odor that was very apparent when you entered the apartment. We finally determined that it probably was the new sisal rug they had installed and read that the glue is often the cause of odor. It was very offensive but we didn't have anywhere else to go so we opened windows and stuck it out. The apartment was very dark (even hard to put on makeup in the bathroom.) It's a shame because this could be a cute place if it were lightened up and the odor problem was cleared up. 
2020505,14025655,2014-06-10,2691070,Allegra,"We had a wonderful time staying with Pat and Trish.  They welcomed us and made our stay easy, comfortable and private.  They were responsive, but gave us everything we needed.  Their guest apartment was splendid, with beautiful appointments and conveniences.  We used the washer and dryer.  The kitchen was well stocked with breakfast food, and the bathroom was elegant.  We spent some mornings in the secluded patio.  The location was convenient to downtown.  We had a wonderful stay.  Would love to stay here again.  "
2020505,14442792,2014-06-19,15830744,Courtney,"We had such a great experience staying with Trish and Patrick in Seattle. The Queen Anne neighborhood is absolutely gorgeous, and the guest suite had everything we needed and more. The bed was huge and very comfortable, the washer/dryer was so convenient for us to do laundry, and the bagels and juices were perfect for breakfast. We were able to take the bus (3 or 4) straight to the city center every day. The bus stop is about a 2 minute walk from the house. The shops and restaurants on Queen Anne are also very close. This was our first experience with airbnb, and it was definitely amazing. If you are thinking of traveling to Seattle, Trish and Patrick's place is great!"
2020505,14651452,2014-06-23,3957198,Laila,"My friend and I stayed booked this place and even before we landed in Seattle we knew we were in good hands. Patrick and Trish asked what kind of breakfast we wanted, which is certainly a nice touch! 
Patrick was very accommodating, answered any questions throughout the stay, and generally was a great host. 
The place itself has some nice touches, such as heated tiles in the bathroom, a great speaker system, and a nice outdoor area to bask in the sun, should you luck out on weather as we did. The location is very central; I had to be in several places throughout Seattle during my long weekend stay and it was easy to get in and out. Plus, it's walking distance to shops, cafes, restaurants and groceries should you need them. 
I would definitely recommend this place! 
Laila "
2020505,14854580,2014-06-28,10009635,Tara,"We liked all about our stay at Trisha's and Patrick's home. 

The private house was just amazing, beautifully decorated, spacious - A typical american house and a very nice location. 

Kind and generous hosts ! We appreciated their advices given to us concerning the continuation of our journey. Patrick also gave us a spontaneous ride to downtown because we were late for our Baseball game. 

It was a pleasure meeting them and hopefully we'll come back one day.

Highly recommended ! "
2020505,15208084,2014-07-05,177210,Tom,"Our stay at Patrick and Trish's lovely property was flat out super. In equal measure, the hosts and the property were just what we were looking for !  The property is comfortable, clean and classy. The bed is very comfortable and seemed to be a Cal King. There was cool shower with oversized an showerhead and a spacious bathroom with double sinks. The comfy and cozy media room/library was a great place to unwind after a day out. And, the very useful ""kitchen"" area was used for preparing the special order breakfast fixings or just as often to open a bottle of wine. The outdoor patio area has a zen-like setting with a living wall, contemplation pool and maybe a visit  The hosts were friendly, helpful and kind. They answered our many questions with humor and from a 30+ year knowledge base.  The Queen Anne area is a vibrant community and close to many Seattle attractions. There were many dining options close by and we enjoyed several including  Chinook which was recommended by the hosts.   Overall, our stay was an excellent experience which we highly recommend."
2020505,16062056,2014-07-21,14642043,Linda,This home is exactly what you see in the pictures...it is beautiful and Trish and Patrick were just lovely.  It's quiet and private and we couldn't of asked for anything more.  
2020505,16346067,2014-07-26,2928957,Shari,"The guest suite was exactly what we needed for our Seattle vacation. The  rooms are comfortable with little details here and there.  We were furnished with plenty of breakfast foods, delicious wine, towels and special treats.  Trish and Patrick are very welcoming host and provide a great location for visits to Seattle.  Their backyard is beautifully landscaped with chairs and table provided on sunny days. The kitchen is supplied with everything you need to warm up some food or make a small meal.   I also had a chance to enjoy some wine and appetizers with Trish and Patrick who are the best hosts in my Airbnb experience.  Queen Anne location is perfect for a 5 minute walk to stores and restaurants.  Getting to downtown was easy via bus or car.  We highly recommend their guest suite for a Seattle trip!!  "
2020505,17650299,2014-08-15,961803,Kauakea,"Here are the reason why I genuinely enjoyed my stay at Trish & Patricks place. It's private: you have the place (I consider it a mother-in-law apartment) all to your self and you're provided a key to come and go as you please. Parking: a lot of on street parking but that doesn't matter much when tell you that you can park right in front of the house. Setting: the neighborhood is filled with single family homes were noise is not an issue at all. Fit & Finishes: the materials used inside the in-law apartment and around the home would easily land this place inside of a custom home magazine. Landscaping: you can tell a lot of thought went into were each plant was situation throughout the property and how well they are managed. Location: a minute drive from the 99 which was always void of traffic which takes you right into down town Seattle, and about a 3 minute walk to Queen Anne's shops and restaurant but I wouldn't have noticed this hidden fact if not for Patrick letting me know. Owners: so very friendly, quiet and accommodating making it the most enjoyable part of my stay. "
2020505,18167914,2014-08-23,15872336,Amanda,"We enjoyed our stay in Seattle.  Great location and accommodations. Comfy bed, great shower and heated floors in bathroom. Exceeded expectations - back yard is beautiful - Hope to come back. "
2020505,18543622,2014-08-28,9232003,Danielle,"Trish and Patrick have thought of everything that a guest could want or need. Their accommodations are very comfortable and well-appointed, plus centrally located. We didn't want to leave. "
2020505,19037299,2014-09-05,19574701,Derrick,"Upon arriving at Patrick and Trish's we knew we had made the right decision. They were both friendly and also professional. The description of the guest suite was exactly as it said on airbnb. The description and information booklet was extremely well laid out and could not be more helpful. Patrick also gave us a nice tour of the place and assured us that this was ""our"" spot for the four days.  Queen Anne is a quaint old community with restaurants within walking distance of Patrick and Trish's. I highly suggest Einstein Bagels for breakfast. Within our house manual we had detailed descriptions of restaurants and walking distances. This was our first time using this website and we found the perfect spot. It will be hard to live up to what Patrick and Trish are offering their lucky guests"
2020505,19364452,2014-09-11,8773002,Pat Cell,"Our hosts welcomed us us at the apartment and took us through it to explain everything. The fridge was stocked with yummy breakfast items and wonderful coffees and teas were available. The space was extremely pleasant, comfortable and clean. The wonderful private patio area with water feature, comfortable furniture and perfect landscaping was just delightful.  Thanks Patrick and Trish for your thoughtful hospitality."
2020505,20224357,2014-09-26,3003842,Chris,"Trish and Patrick's place was amazing. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone else. When we visit Seattle again, I hope their place is available so we can stay there.

The best way I can describe the apartment is that it felt like we were coming home when we came back there at night. We were gone most of each day, and even stayed in Vancouver, BC one night, but when we returned, it felt like we returned home.

Trish and Patrick respected our privacy in every way. They needed to enter to perform some maintenance on the heating controller, but they let us know so that we could tell them a time when it would be convenient for them to come in.

They both gave us lots of ideas on places to visit in both Seattle and Vancouver and were really fun to talk to. I regret that we were gone most of the days we were there (so much to see and do in Seattle), and as a result, we only had a chance to talk to them for an extended period that one time.

They provided us wine, breakfast items, water, trail mix, and even gave us more when we ran out. Their hospitality is amazing and something you might not find with other hosts. Patrick walked us through the apartment when we arrived and explained where everything was and how everything worked (e.g. remote control, stereo system, etc).

The apartment itself is exactly as pictured, if not better, and is a really fantastic space. A den area is available to relax, watch TV, and read, and it's on the same wall that faces the picturesque pond/seating area. The first morning we were there, we ate outside by the water feature and it felt great out there.

The bed was a large king and the bedroom had ample closet space. An ironing board and iron were provided (not in the amenities that AirBNB lists for some reason) which was needed.

Trish and Patrick's space is somewhere I could see living, not just a place to visit, and I highly recommend staying with them if you are in the Seattle area."
2020505,20512682,2014-09-30,20696081,Modette,"When the host is waiting enthusiastically on the front porch for your arrival, you know it is going to be a great stay! What a gracious couple! This lovely property is in a perfect location on Queen Anne. It is a very short walk to a range of eating establishments, small boutiques, grocery stores, coffee houses, a book store, and more. All in such a charming and friendly environment. Just walking the surrounding neighborhoods is a terrific way to appreciate the compelling ambiance of Queen Anne! Regarding the accommodations, we give it the highest recommendation. The private entrance, with the beautiful patio and landscaping, not only creates the sense of a special place, but provides you such an enjoyable place for a meal, glass of wine, or just relaxing outdoors ( weather permitting, of course). It just feels like an extension of the lovely suite. The interior quality and decor were so pleasing! It is truly appointed beautifully. From the heated stone floors and towel rack in the bath, the comfy leather chairs in the TV room, the large king bed, convenient washer and dryer and lovely kitchenette, to the quality craftsmanship throughout, this guest suite is a real delight! Trish and Patrick are truly attentive to your enjoyment. They had our desired breakfast items provided, and even had beer and a lovely bottle of wine waiting. They are willing to guide you through any inquiries, and exhibit tremendous warmth and graciousness. Yet, once you are settled in, you retain a sense of complete privacy. We found Trish and Patrick to be absolutely charming people, and the perfect hosts! We are planning to travel to Seattle more frequently now, and we will now arrange our dates to always stay here. It just feels like ""home away from home!"""
2020505,21823840,2014-10-25,6183307,José,"Trish and Patrick were amazing hosts. Their house is a dream - so much so that we'd be first in line to buy it in the off-chance they decide to part with it! The room was the best we've stayed during our 26-day trip through the U.S., with a plush bed. The den, oh my, it was so good it was an effort, everyday, to decide to go out, even though we've loved Seattle... And Queen Anne Hill, oh boy... That's what all neighborhoods should be like.

But, although the room, den and guest area were great, Trish and Patrick were even more than that. Way more. 

Welcoming and warm, we were honored to be invited to a night cap with them in the main house. It was wonderful to get to know two people like them, interesting, knowledgeable and extremely gentle and pleasant. Patrick's stories from back when he was a pilot were fantastic. We loved the company.

Hope we get to go back to Seattle soon, when we'll definetely stay with you guys again. (By the way, thanks, Trish, for the tip on the Hamburger Lab - it was great!).

And, as we've said, you'll always be welcome in Sao Paulo should you come down here!

Cheers"
2020505,22303194,2014-11-03,836197,Lisa,"We had a great time at Trish and Patrick's! We felt very welcome the minute we walked in the door. Patrick gave us a tour of the space, which includes beautiful amenities. I joked that the only way it could get better is if there were monogrammed robes! The heated floors and towel rack were amazing. The bed was incredibly comfortable. The design is simple, yet beautiful! 

The unit was perfect for what we needed - a clean, comfortable, and close space in the QA neighborhood. More than that though, we got a library full of interesting reads when we were lounging around, bagels and coffee in the morning, which meant we didn't have to go out and buy breakfast, and they left a beautiful bottle of wine for us...no less a bottle from our favorite year! Plus, they were nice enough to let us stay most of our departure day since we had a late flight.

It is in a great location in QA as well. We were able to walk to QA Ave for yoga, shopping, dinners, and closely located to the family we we were in town to see.

We will definitely be coming back and letting our family and friends know this is a great place to book."
2020505,22675496,2014-11-11,23118455,Tanner,"We had a wonderful time at Trish & Patrick's place.  As we are first time B N Ber's, we were not quite sure what to expect.  The accommodations were both spacious and cozy and provided a great environment as a home base as well as for us to get some R&R.  On our way to the airport yesterday my wife said, 'if we head to Seattle again, that is where we are going to stay.'"
2020505,22839667,2014-11-16,422382,Howard,"My experience was exceptional...from booking through ""check out"". The guest suite is private and totally hooked up....from Bose sound system throughout, to king bed, to heated floors and towel rack in the bathroom, to kitchen w/ washer dryer.  The house is in a quiet, residential neighborhood convenient to the Queen Anne shopping/eating district and to downtown Seattle.  I hope to return in the summer and stay once again.  And thanks for the tip on the 5 Spot restaurant...not only great breakfast, but even better dinner."
2020505,23441765,2014-12-01,22773737,Leslie,"Accommodations are first class!  I felt like I was staying at a 5-star hotel - lovely sitting room, fully functional kitchenette with all the things I requested stocked in the fridge.  Oh, and the heated floors and towel rack - so luxurious!   Wish the weather had been better so I could enjoy the pretty patio area.  The Queen Anne neighborhood was very convenient for my daily walk to and from my daughter's place.  Such a lovely area of the City.  Will definitely return on my next visit to Seattle."
2020505,23685002,2014-12-08,22421973,Quinn,"We'd highly recommend a stay at Patrick and Trish's fantastic Queen Anne suite!

Welcomed delightfully with pastries and a wonderful bottle of wine plus an in depth overview of the features of the suite, our stay was off to a great start and from there proved to be comfortable and relaxing for the whole weekend.

The suite was roomy, warm, inviting and very cozy and the Queen Anne location was perfect for walking with easy access to a great Seattle neighborhood. We'd love to come back in the summer months to take advantage of the great outdoor patio space."
2020505,23907845,2014-12-14,23896934,Katie,"We loved staying here! The place was exactly as described. Parking was very easy, and the location could not have been better for access to the Queen Anne area. Also not far from downtown etc. Patrick was great and showed us around the space when we arrived. They left some great breakfast items which was very appreciated. We would absolutely stay here again and recommend this to others. "
2020505,25022929,2015-01-05,23210179,Kristen,"This was our first visit to Seattle and our first airbnb experience. We’re happy to report that we had a warm welcome and fantastic sojourn in Queen Ann with Trish and Patrick. We were visiting our son and his fiancé who live close by, so were able to easily navigate the city from this lovely home. The apartment is cozy, comfortable, and meticulously clean with plenty of attention to detail that enabled our stay to run smoothly. Little niceties that go a long way – a dish of gummy bears! meant a lot to us. Not to mention our favorite beer and breakfast items stocked upon arrival – so nice! A list of recommended restaurants within walking distance led to a delicious breakfast at “Grub” where we fought over the homemade strawberry jam. A very comfortable bed after a long day of site seeing can’t be beat! Great location. Trish and Patrick work hard to make sure each guest gets everything they need. Our only regret is that we couldn’t stay longer to get to know this nice couple. Goes above and beyond what could be expected. Highly recommend this property and host."
2020505,25559559,2015-01-19,5575735,Corinne,"This is a lovely place to stay on a quiet street in Queen Anne. Patrick and Trish are most welcoming, helpful and responsive. The space is well appointed, very clean and has everything one needs, including a very comfortable bed. We loved walking in the area, the easy parking and the convenience to downtown Seattle. We would definitely stay in this beautiful suite again!  "
2020505,26275567,2015-02-08,1157156,Mattias,This is a beautiful space with kind and attentive hosts. Highly recommended.

Their house is  beautifully remodeled and features all the amenities we could possibly have needed.  This was by far one of the best Airbnb experiences we have had.  It made our first trip to Seattle as wonderful as we had hoped it would be.  "
2020505,27666521,2015-03-09,25637222,Vy Ty,"First-time airbnb-er here!  After multiple delayed flights and getting lost via Seattle's cursed six-way intersections, we arrive to find Patrick graciously greeting us and taking us on a tour of the space. Everything was super clean and lovingly decorated. Location was key - a quick drive to downtown or skip across the river to Fremont area. The breakfast items, the yummy bottle of wine, the little treats on the side table, the towel warmer - all the tiny details just made us feel completely welcome. I would totally live in this space!"
2020505,28103620,2015-03-17,13277335,April,"We had a fantastic stay with Patrick & Trish. The space is a comfortable and private retreat. We were spoiled with plenty of treats and drinks for our stay. We were able to walk or take public transportation, so the location was excellent. We would stay again! Thank you, Patrick and Trish!"

It was so nice to be on Queen Anne again (after living there for 2 years) and it was so wonderful to have a quiet place to come back to after a day of touring and visiting friends in Seattle! We loved the king sized bed and heated bathroom floors! Trish and Patrick also made sure that the kitchen was well stocked with lots of our favorite breakfast items as well as delicious candy in the hallway! We felt very welcome and very comfortable to come and go as we pleased. We would love to make this our ""go to"" spot when we come visit Seattle and are definitely telling all of our friends and family about this hidden treasure! Thank you so much to Trish and Patrick for opening up your home to us (especially on Easter weekend!) and being such wonderful hosts! "
2020505,30241278,2015-04-19,13251842,Dan,"Loved staying here.  Location is amazing.  How to Cook a Wolf is a 5 minute walk!  Patrick and Trish have an eye for detail.  Super cozy, clean and dialed in.  "
2020505,30669428,2015-04-26,27423622,Megan,"Trish and Patrick's guest suite could not have been better, and is just as the pictures and descriptions say and parking is incredibly easy!  Once we arrived Patrick gave us a tour of the suite to ensure we understood all the bells and whistles of the place (heated floors, sound system, things like that), gave us some recommendations on where to go and how to get around, and left us to it.  They had even left us some goodies in the kitchen, although there were too many eateries in the city we wanted to try we didn't utilize that like we could have.  But it was nice to have in case we needed it, nevertheless.  The location also could not have been better - we found it quite convenient to get to anywhere in the city we needed to go, and a short walk around the neighborhood produced some amazing views of downtown.  If we were to travel back to Seattle (likely!) we would not hesitate to stay here again!"
2020505,31614926,2015-05-07,32370347,Amy,"The private ""in house"" guest suite in Queen Anne was just fantastic! The suite is beautifully done with great attention to detail throughout. It has all the amenities of home and the hosts go above and beyond to make you feel at home for your stay. Additionally, the location can't be beat - on a quiet street in Queen Anne you are in a peaceful neighborhood and only blocks away from the downtown Queen Anne shops and restaurants. I would highly recommend staying here! "
2020505,32100394,2015-05-14,17851119,Kerry,"Trish and Patrick's home was perfect for relaxing and unwinding at the end of an 8 week holiday on the west coast of the U.S. Patrick greeted us on our arrival and showed us the ins and outs of our accommodation. Lots of breakfast supplies, including fruit, juices and water,  were provided. Generously, Patrick also left an excellent bottle of Chardonnay and local beer. Our accommodation was compact but tastefully and thoughtfully (website hidden) facilities are limited but Queen Anne shops and restaurants are a close walk away and there is a wide choice of cuisines. The neighbourhood is exactly as described. It is a short distance from the city and has excellent public transport close by. The immediate streets around the home are tree lined and many of the craftsmen's cottages that abound have delightful gardens so walking is a must. I would strongly recommend Trish and Patrick's home to others."
2020505,32788332,2015-05-21,18288327,New,"I had a fantastic stay with Patrick and Trish.  I was greeted with an unusual level of hospitality: my evening flight was delayed, yet Patrick stayed up to welcome me and show me around. The kitchen was stocked with enough breakfast food for my entire stay, as well as beer.  The place has been recently renovated and features upscale furnishings all around, from a stereo system to heated bathroom floors.  It all makes for a special stay.  This was a business a trip for me, connected with house hunting -- the latter was generously aided by Patrick.  I could say many more positive things.  This will be my favorite Airbnb to stay at Queen Anne."
2020505,33106510,2015-05-25,7439569,Lynne,"Trish and Patrick were thoughtful and gracious hosts, and their home is gorgeous. The guest accommodations were beautifully decorated and extremely comfortable, with everything we needed to enjoy our stay. The property was very well located for everything we had planned. We would stay with Trish and Patrick again, enthusiastically."
2020505,34425228,2015-06-08,1946884,Amanda,"The experience in the guest suite was perfect. We both really loved the space and the amenities. While we didn't spend too much time there, I loved how they spent time picking out breakfast and drink options for us. I loved the beer! Thanks Patrick and Trish for an amazing stay. Queen Anne is Beautiful! :) "
2020505,35366589,2015-06-18,25312767,Sandra,"Trish and Patrick are most welcoming, friendly and gracious hosts. 
This was our first visit to Seattle and our stay in the guest suite made it all the more enjoyable. 
The suite is well equipped and furnished and located in a safe, peaceful and attractive residential neighbourhood, close to but set apart from the city. We found it to be a perfect base from which to explore both downtown and the Seattle area.
Frequent buses to downtown are only a few minutes away and there are pubs, restaurants and a good Safeway supermarket, only a ten minute stroll away in the ""village"" centre of Queen Anne.
Trish and Patrick provided ample supplies for breakfast and other nice touches, such as plentiful local beer and a nice bottle of wine. 
We could not have found a better place and wholeheartedly recommend a stay here."
2020505,35775713,2015-06-22,29287193,Suzette,"Patrick was very welcoming when we arrived.  He provided excellent information about the surrounding areas and activities we could participate in.  Trish and Patrick's home was wonderful, so we felt at home (but on vacation). I believe Queen Anne is the perfect neighborhood to stay in if you want to see the city.  My husband and I walked to a lot of nice locations. We hope to visit Seattle again and hopefully Trish/ Patrick's home is available."
2020505,37162795,2015-07-05,32998987,Alan,"First time using Airbnb and Trish and Patrick have set the bar really high! The space is clean, comfortable, and inviting. The back patio with the water feature is a great place to have breakfast by in the morning or a glass of wine or beer in the evening. The neighborhood is quiet, but a short distance from downtown. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
2020505,38104457,2015-07-13,1859461,Jenece,"If you are looking for a peaceful retreat surrounded by relaxing environs then this is a great spot. The neighborhood is adorable with arts and crafts homes dating from the turn of the century, Queen Anne Ave. is within a short walking distance and full of great restaurants. The property itself is immaculately kept and wonderfully organized with clear instructions on how to use all technologies on the premise. The rear garden is an oasis of calm. Quite a treat indeed. 

Patrick was incredibly adaptable to our schedule and needs.  All in all it was a lovely stay."
2020505,39387998,2015-07-23,343845,Deidre,"Trish and Patrick were outstanding host. We knew we had found a great place to stay but ended up exceeding our expectations. We were greeted and given a short tour. The property is beautiful, quiet, and very pleasant. We loved that we were a walk away from anything we needed. Tucked away in a quiet neighborhood. Grabbed the bus and headed to the city easy access. We even asked Patrick for a great Anniversary dinner place. We went where he recommended and loved it. Upon leaving we forgot one of our phones. Our host so gracious put it in the mail for next day arrival. We could not recommend this suite more!"
2020505,40074627,2015-07-28,5617134,Eileen,"Our first air nob experience was at Trish and Patrick's place and they ""knocked it out of the park!"" Their space has a warm and cozy feel to it that provides a welcome respite from the day's activities. We enjoyed using their outdoor space, which is quite lovely. As promised, Trish and Patrick provided a nice bottle of wine to enjoy, as well as breakfast items. The area of Queen Anne is a great location from which to enjoy Seattle. Patrick gave us suggestions for places to eat in Queen Anne, which we happily took advantage of and enjoyed our evening strolls into Queen Anne. Really I can't say enough about Trish and Patrick's place and their hospitality. A wonderful air nob experience!"
2020505,42396586,2015-08-13,6211771,Frances,"
We have stayed in several airbnbs in Europe and the USA and all have been good but Trisha and Patrick's place is the most immaculate. The Queen Anne neighborhood is charming and conveniently located. Patrick and Trish are very nice and provided us with a perfect stay in Seattle. We totally recommend their place.

2020505,43603182,2015-08-21,12966974,Scott,"This was our first visit to Seattle, and Patrick and Trish really helped to make it a very enjoyable visit. Their house was simply adorable,   tastefully decorated, very clean, and comfortable. It was well  supplied with whatever one may need while traveling. We appreciated having an array of breakfast items as well as a bottle of wine to enjoy in the evening. We loved walking the neighborhood- very quiet and peaceful. It was just a short walk into the quaint  village of Queen Anne, which has great restaurants and coffee shops and just a short walk to the bus stop. Our stay here made Seattle even more charming!"
2020505,44416082,2015-08-26,34775511,Charles,A fantastic experience in a beautiful little sanctuary !  A quick walk to the local Queen Ann Bistros and restaurants too.  And make sure you get to know Olive the coolest cat we ever met.  
2020505,46111011,2015-09-08,25907330,Lynette Frey,"Trish and Patrick were very welcoming and great at communicating information about their property.  This very private ""in house"" guest suite was more like an apartment and is a 5-star property - very classy.  Upon our arrival we were greeted with a bottle of wine which provided us with an insight on how detail oriented Trish and Patrick are - the bottle was Lautrec (I'm an artist). The bed and bedding were perfect, thank goodness, as we were on the go constantly and were wiped out by the time we got back.  The bathroom was perfect with lots of towels, and had a heated floor - loved that.  The kitchen was very well stocked with breakfast food and beverages.   The private back courtyard was an excellent place to sit and enjoy time with visiting family members as we shared our wine.  And the very comfortable TV den was filled with Seattle information, great books, and a glimpse of the owners.  We would have enjoyed hearing about their lives.

We were in Seattle for a wedding, and staying in the Queen Ann area was the perfect location in order for us to get to all the different venues easily.  We also enjoyed a walk to the Queen Ann restaurant area where we enjoyed a meal at How To Cook A Wolf.

If you're coming to visit Seattle and the surrounding area, don't hesitate renting this gem.  We highly recommend."
2020505,47349635,2015-09-18,27162856,Phyllis,"They both made us feel quite welcome.
Showing us around.  Explaining carefully all that was available to us with the accomodations and also willing to provide other info about the area."
2020505,49317029,2015-10-03,4943515,Tamara,"Trish and Patrick's place was absolutely perfect - a real Airbnb gem! Patrick let us in early and showed us around and explained how everything worked. The suite (lower level of their Craftsman, sealed off from the owners' residence) was gorgeous and well-appointed. I loved the heated floors in the bathroom and the ceiling speakers that let us listen to music in every room. The towels and bedding were luxury hotel quality. The house is only a 7 minute walk through the beautiful Queen Anne neighborhood to great shopping and restaurants, and a 10 minute drive to downtown. Overall, we were extremely pleased by this experience and would love to stay here again on our next Seattle visit."
2020505,50305348,2015-10-11,42751863,Kerry,"Great communication from Trish and Patrick, the apartment was just as described, and we really enjoyed staying there."
2020505,51274396,2015-10-19,39521920,Peggy,"This was our very first Airbnb experience and it was perfect!  We loved the location, the high-quality and well-designed interior of the guest suite, the wine and breakfast croissants, and the helpful, welcoming hosts.  It was the perfect place for us to stay for our son's wedding.
"
1289082,6305341,2013-08-07,7217909,Gabby,Rose & Glen were very attentive and great hosts.  The apartment was very nicely furnished and in a very walkable area of town. We could tell they put a lot of care putting the place together. Slept 6 of us quite comfortably. We would not hesitate renting this or any of their other places in the future.
1289082,6657778,2013-08-20,6987910,Stephanie,Great location. Walking distance to enough for comfort. Short driving distance to most things. Parking provided behind. Be careful not to park anywhere else as some may be Upark spots! Also the upstairs shower wasn't working which is a pain when you're the only girl and need to shower downstairs sharing with all guys instead... But we made it work. 
1289082,14953106,2014-06-30,13284087,Mal,"The house worked fine for us.  I did not like the fact that we had no personal contact with the owners - face to face, telephone, or email.  Everything went through as link.

I would be reluctant to use airbnb again."
1289082,15928455,2014-07-18,17222721,Jason,"Nicely decorated, clean home. Perfect for our party of six and accommodating hosts! Cute backyard and the best if three properties we stayed in during our NW tour. Reading material was also fun, we learnt where quite a few common sayings came from! "
1289082,16735528,2014-08-01,17971727,Kathleen,"Hosts were great. Rose was great on email.  Glen in person.  Glen met me to give me the keys and show me around the house. Great location, comfortable beds. Had everything we needed.  Top bedroom looks out to a busy street so had to shut the window to sleep...but they thought of everything and had a super powered fan to keep the air flowing.
Thanks!

1289082,16895464,2014-08-04,15577519,Julia,"Pros: The house was clean and in a good location--walk to a few restaurants and grocery store. Short drive to downtown. 

Cons: Not family-friendly. Unprofessional. "
1289082,17987359,2014-08-19,7511139,Nancy,Glen was waiting for us with a big smile after a long drive from Vancouver. We didn't know what time we would get there as we were driving during rush hour but he was very accommodating. The home is a few minutes away from the water where there were a lot of restaurants and little shops. We never explored this part of Seattle and glad we did. House was very clean and although we didn't use the kitchen it seemed well equipped. 
1289082,18877803,2014-09-02,16632837,Terry,Great house. Very clean and comfortable. Great location.
1289082,19387071,2014-09-11,20691414,Junliang,"We had a wonderful experience. Both Glen and Rose were Very nice to us. Very nice neighborhood. Great backyard , and you could do BBQ if you want. Nothing to complain except A bit noisy during the day because it's close to the main street, but quiet at night. I will definitely to check in this nice place again if I visit settle again. Best, Leon "

1289082,33066395,2015-05-25,9007386,Jonathan,"The house worked well for my grown children, their spouses and me when we were in Seattle recently for my niece's wedding.  It was very conveniently located in the nice Greenwood neighborhood near the houses of several family members and with easy access by car to downtown Seattle.  It easily slept our group of three couples and me -- I slept on the living room couch, which was comfortable.  Having two full bathrooms, a washer and dryer, wifi and a well-equipped kitchen was a convenience.  We enjoyed the backyard, too.  The house was clean, pleasant and comfortable.  We did not see Rose and Glen, but were able to easily access the house with the key lock box.        "

The neighborhood was nice and we enjoyed walking to several places including our friends who were also staying in the area. All the best, Bill and Marlene"
1289082,36663956,2015-06-30,30723814,Trish,"We rented this house for three couples coming in from the East Coast for our wedding in Ballard. Rose and Glen were very responsive in getting back to us about questions and details. The house is lovely and well situated for out-of-town guests without a car. Our friends especially enjoyed the back deck and walking to the Four Spoons Cafe for breakfast! Thank you, Rose and Glen, for helping to make our guests so comfortable!

The only downside was a complaint from the downstairs unit about noise from the hardwood floors. All of our guests are mature adults and tried very hard to be respectful, but the lovely floors in the house make it difficult to be as quiet as our neighbors would have liked. Something to keep in mind, especially if you have young children..."
1289082,37505548,2015-07-07,2615506,Colleen,Hostess made us feel welcome. Neighborhood was nice however the busy street made it a bit noisy on the deck.

We will try it again if We go to Seattle next time. thx for sending our friend to AMTRAK.
"
1289082,39902042,2015-07-27,9758433,Barbara,"Overall, we had a good experience.  The house worked well for all 8 of us, however it is important to note that the upstair bathroom has a bathtub only, no shower.  It did not turn out to be a problem for us to share the one shower downstairs, but the listing was not clear on this feature of the house.  Otherwise, the hosts have set up the house to be very self explanatory and easy to live in and we enjoyed our stay.  "
1289082,41739971,2015-08-09,6412296,Richard,"We were met by Rose and Glen and provided with a most comprehensive briefing on all aspects of the property.  The house is well fitted and very comfortable, guests are provided with plenty of lovely white towels etc., and there is easy access to the downtown area of Seattle - it suited our needs perfectly.  The neighbourhood is safe and there are plenty of grocery and other convenience stores nearby.
Our only observation is that the property is situated on the corner of a busy street and the traffic noise was quite invasive particularly as we needed to keep windows/doors open due to the wonderful summer weather!"
1289082,42817645,2015-08-16,2100391,Julie,"Great location near Golden Gardens and Ballard Locks. Easy access to freeway. Lots of cute bars, coffee shops, etc. nearby. Grocery and fuel close by as well. Hosts were very friendly. House is kind of small, but the bedrooms are nicely sized. Lots of extras in this house compared to others I've stayed in. For the price, I would stay here again."
1289082,43975426,2015-08-23,38846395,Dayle,"My family (two grown sons and an 8 year old granddaughter had a very comfortable week long stay at Rose and Glen's Ballard home. Rose and Glen are very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the ability to cook in their well-stocked kitchen as well as using the gas grill. It was great to relax in the living room after a busy day with very comfortable furniture and TV and wireless internet. Some have mentioned street noise, but with windows closed we couldn't hear it, and we quickly got used to it with the windows open. It was very quiet at night. This was our first Airbnb experience and we will definitely be using this service again."
1289082,45115306,2015-08-31,803068,Nick,"Exactly what it says in the description. The bus stop to downtown is a short two blocks away, though you'll probably need an umbrella to get there. It's really close to a grocery store and pizza shop, so food isn't a problem. The kitchen is reasonably well stocked for cooking utensils. Would recommend for groups up to 6 people."
1289082,45933790,2015-09-07,10718808,Lisa,"Rose and Glen were very accommodating hosts - quick to communicate, they provided clear instructions, and were flexible with our check-in and check-out times. The house worked great for our group of 6 people, it was clean and well-represented in the photos. A great choice for the Ballard-area neighborhood!"
1289082,48842118,2015-09-28,28412236,Joanna,"Great customer service from Glen and Rose and very comfortable accommodations. There is an apartment below the rental, and since the house is a bit older, you can hear pretty much all goings on downstairs. However, the tenants were respectful of us and everything worked out. We'd stay here again."
1289082,52693486,2015-11-01,39833487,Richard,"The description of this property was accurate. Communication before and during the stay with both Rose and Glen, our hosts, was easy and prompt.  Thanks.  We needed a place for sleep located near our work site.  This property fit our needs."
1289082,55153015,2015-11-28,21258290,Sandhya,Greta place. Good location and convenient for people with families. Everything was kept clean and ready. We enjoyed our stay a lot with (3 kids and 4 adults) with plenty of room to play and relax
7680670,41184426,2015-08-04,35972338,Zacharia,It was a good experience. It was a very clean studio with many amenities and very close to downtown. Nazar was a great host and it made a very comfortable stay
7680670,41877964,2015-08-09,40246968,Maren,Perfect for what we needed; an affordable one night stay close to downtown Seattle. 
7680670,45320509,2015-09-01,700755,Barbara,My husband and I had a good time staying at Nazar's place.  I like the neighborhood a lot.  It's within walking distance to space needle and multiple museums.  There are multiple restaurants in the neighborhood too.  Nazar's place is clean and has pretty much everything we needed.  Thanks a lot for hosting us!
7680670,46826730,2015-09-13,32988653,Karen,"Large studio, comfortable bed, great location. Close to bus stops. I rented a car and had to park 3 blocks away since it's a crowded area. Also, it can be noisy if the windows are open at night because of the people passing by and talking."
7680670,47888237,2015-09-21,44215704,Kecia,"The space was very clean and quiet with some refreshments left for us. Studio had a nice view of the space needle and was close to some good bars and restaurants in lower Queen Anne, very convenient. Easy key exchanging which was nice. "

5126365,27566108,2015-03-07,12481470,Tom,"Claire and Michael's house was wonderful and especially convenient if you have business at WSU. They were great, accommodating hosts. We had just driven for over 3 hours, so we didn't have much energy to hang out, but I can't imagine that they would be anything less than awesome people to talk to. Their dog was curious and friendly and well controlled. Claire made sure that we were OK with dogs before confirming our reservation; a great display of empathy. The bed was on the firm firmer side. Overall, A+ experience and would definitely stay here again."
5126365,28550464,2015-03-25,29768238,David,"Claire and Michael were wonderful hosts who went out of their way to accommodate my needs!  They made me feel welcome and took the time to ensure my stay was enjoyable.  Their home, room and neighborhood were as advertised and I certainly recommend them for any travelers looking to plug into all things Seattle."
5126365,29784122,2015-04-12,30387457,M J,"Both Claire and Michael are very friendly, and their dog Franklin was sweet.
     The house is beautiful in a convenient location only a block from my son’s home in the Wallingford neighborhood. The area is wonderful, lots of shops, restaurants and parks, and a great place to go on walks.  The bedroom was spacious, and the bed was very nice and comfortable, with a firm mattress. Because I was spending my waking time with my family, I was only sleeping and showering there, so I wanted a clean and quiet place to spend three nights. 
     There did turn out to be a few problems. The first was when I arrived at the agreed upon time (8:00 – 8:30pm) the first evening.  Nobody answered the doorbell or phone, so I left after waiting 40 minutes, returned later that night a second time with still no answer at the door, and finally ended up on my son’s couch the because it was late and I was tired.  The next night, Claire apologized sincerely and I was able to stay for two nights instead of three.
     The other two issues were the cleanliness and noise levels.  I’ve hostelled quite a bit, so I am used to sharing bathrooms, but I thought the bathroom was not acceptably clean.  In addition, there were times during the night and early mornings when it was very noisy in the house. I think the noise was due in part to someone arriving home late at night, and getting up early in the morning and just not being quiet. And some was attributable to Franklin running around and getting into things like the garbage in the metal step-can in the bathroom adjacent to my room (very loud), and jumping into piles of packing paper and other things lying on the floor in a room across from me in the early morning. After two nights of too little sleep, I left there very tired because of the noise both late each night and early each morning.

He was friendly, had good travel tips, the price was fair. In the morning he provided a great breakfast spread with the works. He really opened his home to us, we would definitely stay there again."
5376433,32995902,2015-05-24,28894473,Yongseok,Marshall is a great host. He truly tries to  help us to enjoy seattle. He gave us breakfast and sometime if the timing is good gave us a ride. He also paints and garden for a hobby which makes his house awsome
5376433,33602649,2015-05-30,32725376,Caroline,"Marshall was a lovely host, he picked/dropped us off at the airport. He is very friendly, but will give you your space. He gave us tips on where to go around Seattle. His place is near a bus that takes you to downtown. He also provided breakfast and went out of his way to buy some breakfast foods for my vegan friend. The bedroom and bathroom were very clean and comfy. He let us use his sauna and he's planning on building a Japanese hot tub. If we come back to Seattle, we'll definitely stay here!"
5376433,34982402,2015-06-14,7788044,Emily,"Marshall was a wonderful host, very kind and considerate. The house was clean, easy-to-access, and close walking distance to downtown Columbia City. "
5376433,35168172,2015-06-15,18121556,Aysja,Marshall was nice but the room was extremely hot. Even with the windows open and the fan on it was uncomfortable. However in the winter this would be a great stay. 
5376433,35955979,2015-06-23,9455377,Heejae,"Comfortable. Homly and much better than photos. Easy to aceess downtown. And during the weekend, We went nature reserve hiking with Marshall. After hiking we had a BBQ together.  Thanks for everything. :)"
5376433,41101533,2015-08-04,10677219,Emil,"We only stayed at Marshall's place for 1 night, but it was a nice stay. Marshall was a good host and the place was nice and clean. There were plenty of amenities provided. If you have a car, or you're ok with taking public transit to downtown Seattle, the location is not far. Overall we had a pleasant stay. Thanks!"
5376433,42873656,2015-08-16,37042887,Bianca,"Marshall was really helpful and we enjoyed our stay with him. 
He even offered to pick us up from the train station during his lunch break.
Since we stayed with him during the weekend he made breakfast for us which was really nice. 
The room was just as described and his home is well located to get in and out of the city!
"
5376433,43804310,2015-08-22,38948665,Brett,"Marshall was a incredible host!  His house is cute & comfortable, and his cat made us feel at home too!  This location is exactly as described, and very close to the city center.  Buses made it easy to get where we wanted to go, and it was always nice returning to his home after a day in the city.  I don't how most hosts are, but Marshall was very welcoming and it was a pleasure sharing a bottle of wine with him as part of our Seattle experience.

If you want to stay in a cozy neighborhood close to the Seattle attractions, this is where you want to be."
5376433,44013705,2015-08-23,40301999,Anneli,It was a great stay at Marshall's place. We felt very comfortable and Marshall gave us some good advice about where to go and how to get there in our short time in Seattle. Thanks a lot!
5376433,44599751,2015-08-27,41966921,Michelle,"We had a great stay at Marshall's. He was friendly and was very helpful in regards to where and how to get to some great local spots. 
Also if you are a cat lover then you are in luck; his cat is more than ready to lavish attention on you or you on to him. I would stay here again and I would recommend his place to friends venturing out to Seattle :)   "
5376433,44921371,2015-08-30,2585369,Sean,Marshall was a great host during our two-night stay in Seattle. He made us feel very much at home and was fun to hang out with too!
5376433,45968867,2015-09-07,5714112,Luke,"Marshall's place is absolutely fantastic! We loved staying with him, he made us feel right at home. Marshall gave us all kinds of advice on what to check out and he was always absolutely friendly. While we were there, he cooked a Filipino soup and slow cooked chicken and rice and shared with us. He's an incredible cook!

Marshall's place is easy to get to anywhere from. We picked it because it was about halfway between the airport and downtown, but we really got to know the neighborhood and ate at the Ethiopian restaurant nearby - it is delicious. 

The room is huge, very cozy, and clean. No complaints at all! Be sure to check out the garden and hang out with his cat, Dwayne, too."
5376433,46458361,2015-09-10,4883795,Maximilian,"Marshall was a wonderful host. He accepted my rather last minute request and made me feel right at home. His house is spacious and thoughtfully decorated. The location is great, only a few minutes walking to the up and coming places of Columbia City and a few blocks away from the bus that takes you to Downtown."
5376433,46840875,2015-09-13,16222784,Veronika,"The space was cozy and inviting, Marshall was very nice and made us feel at home. By far the best deal to stay in Seattle that I have found. We had a great trip :)"
5376433,47757306,2015-09-21,40802967,Ilya,Beautiful and cozy house. Welcoming and nice host.
5376433,48336850,2015-09-25,20513908,Alan,"Marshall's room was comfortable, and the location is convenient to bus line #7; also a 15-minute walk to a LINK light rail station.  

The only problem I had was on first arriving.  We had exchanged emails in which I told him the time when I would be arriving, and he said he would be at home waiting for me.  When I got to his front door, it looked to me like a garage door, and lights were on inside.  There was a keypad next to the door.  I knocked several times and waited outside 10-15 minutes.  There is a gate, closed when I arrived, to the right of the door.  The gate leads into the back yard, but I didn't think it right to open and look back there.  

At last, Marshall heard me knocking and came out from the back yard to let me in.  The entrance is from the back yard, and has its own keypad for guest entrance.  He did not inform me of this entrance before I arrived.   Perhaps he should let future guests know where the entrance is prior to arrival."
5376433,48798558,2015-09-28,16548533,Cindy,"One of our best stays with airbnb! Everything was a bit better than what we were used to. Marshall is very friendly and really made us feel welcome! His house is very nice and clean. Our room was perfect with a comfortable bed! We were able to do our laundry, which was very helpful. We loved the ""help yourself"" breakfast with lots of delicious things!! We also loved Dwayne the cat :)
Ah and the location is convenient, close to bus number 7 which brings you downtown in less than half and hour. There is also a Walgreens nearby."
5376433,49550614,2015-10-04,17465235,Mallory,Marshall is such a nice and welcoming host. I don't have a reason to not stay with him. He made us breakfast both mornings when he wasn't working and chatted at night with wine provided. His home was comfortable and we never felt bothered or in the way. It was in a great location also with grocery and delivery near so you could relax at night and go into the city during the day with one easy bus ride. Thanks Marshall! 
5376433,50240515,2015-10-10,9323989,Iana,"We loved it! Great friendly and helpful host, lovely artsy house, good location. Awesome cat :-)"
5376433,53089543,2015-11-04,11143483,Elsa,"Chambre confortable, à 20 min de downton en bus"
5376433,53925118,2015-11-14,28722839,Mitch,Marshall had a great place and gave me a fantastic experience. Rooms and house was as described and everything I would have expected. Would recommend his place to anyone staying in the area.
2776890,18917009,2014-09-02,367411,Jennifer,"Claire's apartment is comfortable, functional and in a great location. You can easily access the walk/bike trail which leads to Fremont and Ballard neighborhoods. The bus stop to go into  the city is within 3 blocks. Though we didn't meet Claire, she responded quickly to any email contact and is obviously interested in her guests' experience. I highly recommend this listing for people who want a relaxed setting and enjoy exploring smaller areas around a big city. An added plus is the vine covered patio for cocktails or meals!"
2776890,20396775,2014-09-28,2384216,Rian,"Claire was very responsive (via sms) throughout my entire trip and even pre-trip. She offered restaurant recommendations and tips on how to get around. She was also very accommodating; I was in town for a wedding and she ran out and got an iron and ironing board so I wouldn’t look like a wrinkled mess at the ceremony. She also provided some breakfast foods for me in the kitchen.

I didn’t get a chance to tour the neighborhood since it was a brief visit, but from what little I saw and from what my Seattle friends told me, Wallingford is a really nice area. The house itself is simple, but well maintained. I didn’t have any issues with appliances, the wifi was worked fine, and the windows in the house provide tons of natural light (I happened to be in town on a day when the sun was actually out!). On the downside, the closet was locked up so I didn’t have a place to hang my formal attire, but I made do. The other thing that was slightly annoying was dealing with the creepy crawlers (I must have caught like 5 or 6 spiders), but again not a huge issue. All in all I would say given Claire’s responsiveness and the area I was in, my first airbnb experience was pretty positive. "
2776890,21187553,2014-10-12,12364767,Elizabeth,"I contacted Claire on short notice. She responded right away and made arrangements for the place to be ready ASAP. She was also really good at being in touch when I had questions. It's a charming, comfortable and well-equipped place within walking distance of Gasworks Park as well as Fremont and Wallingford shops and restaurants. I loved staying there."
2776890,21542155,2014-10-19,22052615,Mary,"Our experience at Claire's duplex was very pleasant.  The place itself is charming (especially the patio!), in a cute neighborhood walking distance to Lake Union and centrally located to nearly everything in Seattle.  Claire was very easy to communicate with, and so friendly! She left us some treats, and a ton of great coupons. The only improvements that she may need to make would be the addition of some basic amenities.  A coffee maker would have been awesome, and a TV might have been nice to wind down with (there was a screen not plugged into anything).  Also, a real bed would have been great- her's is a thick, hard foam mattress on a stand.  I ended up sleeping on the couch because I found it pretty uncomfortable, although my husband said he didn't mind it :)  All in all a great, very private, cute little place."
2776890,22567369,2014-11-09,6626317,Matt,"This was amazing. Claire was incredibly quick to respond, the ""handoff"" was seamless, and the place was clean and even nicer in person than it was in the photos! It was close to a bunch of great places and very easy to access; even in the craziest traffic. I definitely hope that I return in the future. "
2776890,23419106,2014-11-30,8104145,Christelle,"Probably one the best place we ever rented on Airbnb. The house was comfortable, clean and quiet. We really appreciated that the breakfast was provided (fresh and organic products!). Claire was perfect as well she would always answer our emails super quickly and she was flexible on the check-out time. Thank you!"
2776890,29749465,2015-04-12,16754544,Arny,"Claire was excellent in her communication before and during my visit at her home. The home itself was clean, and very nicely located. The bonus food supplied was delicious and a wonderful addition to my stay. I would definitely stay there again next time im in Seattle"
2776890,30231370,2015-04-19,30229348,Scott,"Great neighborhood, centrally located to the action. Claire left several food amenities to make our stay that much easier. She was very accommodating of a late arrival. House is clean and very comfortable. Thanks again!"
2776890,31228732,2015-05-03,11245115,Tara & Jeremiah,"Adorable small home, just as described. Claire responds quickly and helpfully. All aspects of our check in and check out were smooth and simple.

The neighorhood is quiet, pretty, and friendly, just a few blocks from the water. If you like long walks, this is an ideal location. Walk to lovely Green Lake in just a couple of miles.

The house is attached to at least one other unit, but you'd never know that from the inside - very quiet and private. The outdoor patio with its pretty grape arbor is a wonderful place to relax on a dry day."
2776890,31848286,2015-05-10,2480025,Robert,"This place was perfect -a gem of a house.  I stayed in it while house hunting locally, and it was perfectly situated for exploring Seattle.

The house was great- very quiet and peaceful, Claire was a great host, and was incredibly responsive to my questions.

Late night arrival was no issue, and I would gladly stay her again.."
2776890,33156004,2015-05-25,3500601,Casey,"Enjoyed our stay in Wallingford! The location was fantastic, super centrally located and easy to get to everything. It was the perfect home base for the activities we had planned around the Seattle area. Quiet, safe neighborhood with street parking available and a great little kitchen with all the amenities. Thanks for a great stay.

~Casey and Matthew"
2776890,35714912,2015-06-21,3666160,Bo,"Claire is great to communicate with and very accomodating to our travel schedule. Her house is clean and ready when we arrived at 3 am. She even stocked the fridge with breakfast food and coffee that we were able to enjoy. The location of her place is very convenient, easy walk or drive to the u district or bellard, and fantastic views of the canal at the gas works park nearby. We had a balast while staying there."
2776890,37111345,2015-07-04,513192,Maxim,"Clair is an excellent and host and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at her charming little house. She was instantly responsive to all requests and queries. The house was meticulously cleaned prior to our arrival and the fridge was generously stacked with breakfast essentials. That local ice cream in the freezer also came in quite handy:) The house is conveniently located in Freemont, just a block away from the water (5 minutes to Gaswork Park) and a 15-20-minute from to the university. The neighborhood is quite attractive, with plenty of bars, restaurants, and coffee shops reachable on foot. We had a rental car, which was great because Seattle neighborhoods are kind of scattered around + we wanted to explore the parks and hiking trails around the city. Highly recommended."
2776890,37982191,2015-07-12,9107529,Gregg,Great place.  Claire did a really nice job making everything easy and special for our visit.
2776890,38941030,2015-07-19,18147739,Molly,"Bright and welcoming, neat and comfortable cottage with inviting arbor-covered patio and a mesmerizing nighttime view of Seattle skyline from the kitchen window.  Splendid location. Quiet, friendly neighborhood. Convenient walk or bike ride to shops and restaurants. "
2776890,39789148,2015-07-26,715649,Kate,"This was my first time to be disappointed by an AirBnB booking. We arrived later in the afternoon than planned (due to heavy traffic) and needed to find transportation to Safeco Field. However, there was no contact information of any kind at the house and no directions about how to access the internet or public transportation. With our phones on roaming, we were really stranded. As well, there was no air mattress in place as had been promised, no table for 2 people to eat at, no place to comfortably sit in the front room (since the couch had been hastily made into the second bed we needed). For a father-daughter celebration weekend, this was a big disappointment. "
2776890,40822638,2015-08-02,39076013,Sarah,"Lovely home, delightful setting. We loved having our coffee on the deck. Breakfast provisions were great and Claire was good about asking if we had any special requests. We'd stay here again!"
2776890,41820232,2015-08-09,9662624,Jonathan,"We had a lovely, problem-free stay at Claire's place. It's a brightly lit, clean, spacious 1bd apartment that's the upper level of a cute house. The kitchen is really nice to cook in, with all the requisite supplies and an awesome selection of breakfast foods (including organic eggs!), coffee, and tea provided by Claire for us. The bed was very comfy--I think the mattress is a memory foam. The location and neighborhood is great: a block from the waterfront running/biking path, prosperous, interesting. There was also a TV with Netflix that I availed myself of while I did some work in the sunny living room one morning. I'd definitely go back!"
2776890,42935083,2015-08-16,3740006,Charles,"Claire's place is clean, cheerful and well situated. Claire was very communicative and went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and at home. Claire exceeded my expectations as a host. The place itself although perfectly adequate did not quite meet expectations. At this price point we were a little dissapointed with the rather spartan bed, the apparent lack of spare blankets for cold nights, the lack of anywhere to hang or drape clothes (we set up an ironing board for the purpose in the end). Perhaps we have been spoiled by other Airbnb's but access to a back-up bar of soap would also have been wonderful, especially on the first night. All relatively minor things and overall I would still recommend Claire's place."
2776890,44026066,2015-08-23,27850359,Shannen,"The house was so inviting, it felt like our home away from home.  It was easy to communicate with the owner and we found the place right away.  It was clean, comfortable and just the sweetest little place.  We will definitely be using this house again when traveling to Seattle.  It's so nice to stay away from the downtown area but be close enough to go if we wanted to."
2776890,45900124,2015-09-06,42834218,Molly,"Overall had a great experience, Claire was an excellent host, providing helpful tips about the area and filling the house with breakfast foods. The house is in a great (quiet) neighborhood with street parking available and quick access to Fremont/Wallingford. "
5946675,34150639,2015-06-05,33484040,Victor,"Melanie was very welcoming when she met me and brought me to the apartment. The apartment was lovely, exactly liked it looked on the website pictures. I made use of the well equipped kitchen to cook several meals and ate breakfast by the window looking out at Mt Ranier. The apartment has a great location. It is just a couple blocks up from the waterfront where there is a long walking/biking path. And there is a bus stop on the block. This was my first time using Airbnb and I enjoyed it and will do it again. I had the apartment to myself and it was a much more homey experience than staying in a hotel. "
5946675,35376815,2015-06-18,27875738,Marco,"Melanie was an excellent host. Meeting up with her and checking in was very smooth. She made sure we had everything we needed and recommended some great places to visit during our visit. FYI: perfect location for walking to parks, bars, restaurants and getting anywhere in Seattle quickly. 
Her place is very nice - great kitchen, comfy bed, and that huge soaker tub!! Our favorite part was enjoying a cup of coffee on the balcony every morning. 
Melanie's place is definitely at the top of my list for my next trip to Seattle. "
5946675,36016129,2015-06-24,20630997,Michael,"Melanie was an excellent host! Very friendly and welcoming to the city, and willing to answer so many questions-- also very easily accessible when needed. The unit is warmly decorated and very modern, clean with all sorts of supplies for your stay. The best AirBNB experience I've had yet."
5946675,36956675,2015-07-03,5609878,Julie,"Melanie met me at a nearby coffee shop and we walked to the apartment just a few blocks away.  The neighborhood is charming with 2 grocery stores, Kerry Park, a coffee shop, an arts theater, yoga studio, nail salon and Elliott Bay all within easy walking distance.  The apartment was exactly as it appears in the photo + a spa bathroom and a super cozy bedroom ""retreat"".  There is a great view of downtown and Mt Rainier from the patio.   The apartment is in a gated building which felt safe and secure at all times.  I immediately felt at home and was sad to leave this warm and welcoming space at the end of my 7 day stay.  Melanie's taste in color is terrific - I found myself admiring and enjoying every detail of her cozy home.  This will be my go to place each time I am Seattle!"
5946675,41734041,2015-08-09,30128114,Nick,"Melanie was an awesome host. She met with us (my brother and I) at a nearby coffee shop and showed us around the area, and finally the apartment. We were in town for an event at Key Arena. We were able to comfortably walk to and from the arena every day, as well as to some local restaurants and a nearby grocery store. So, the location was absolutely perfect. 

The apartment looks even better in person than in the photos. Plenty of space for my brother and I (he got the bed, I took the couch, which was fine by me). The bathroom was beautiful and the decorations made the entire space feel welcoming. I hope that if (when) we come back to Seattle, we get a chance to stay here again!"
7418814,39863593,2015-07-26,32873049,Beth,"We had a excellent stay with Kelly and co. Everything was as described, and we found ourselves surprised by the quality linens, hospitality, and overall tranquility of the setting. We were there with our teenage daughters, and found the accommodations surpassed our expectations. Fresh coffee in the fridge was a welcome perk, and my husband faved about the toiletries! We especially loved spending quality time with Rocky the dog while we were there. 5 stars all the way! Thank You!"
7418814,40183068,2015-07-28,103252,Rona,"Kelly's place was just what we needed. It was clean, pleasant, in a nice quiet neighborhood, and only 5 minutes from Green Lake where our relative was living. We got to watch one of our favorite Netflix shows, the bed was quite comfortable...with lots of pillows. The kitchen had the basics you will need...we enjoyed a nice cup of tea. Walk-in shower that was perfect for me since I have a broken ankle. Kelly wasn't there, but the instructions were clear, and there were no problems at all. 
I highly recommend it, and will stay there again if I am back in Seattle. "
7418814,40508195,2015-07-31,38524677,Susan,"We didn't have an opportunity to meet Kelly, but we were very happy with out stay. The place was very clean and nicely appointed (great towels!). It was easy to get to downtown. In addition Kelly left great instructions for restaurants within walking distance and other nearby activities. She even mailed us items we left behind. We highly recommend Kelly's place."
7418814,41462673,2015-08-07,24664982,Sydney,"We had a great experience booking with Kelly. I ended up booking  the Roosevelt Roost for an employee who was in town for business and Kelly was great to work with. She was very understanding of our situation, quick to answer questions, and easy to work with.

Lauren (the guest) also had a great experience, so I wan't to pass along her feed back as well:

I wanted to thank you for your hospitality last week. It was a welcome change to not to stay in a hotel. Your recommendations on local restaurants and things to do was a nice touch. I travel to Seattle a few times a year and now have a few new favorite places to eat! 
Thank you!!"
7418814,42435870,2015-08-13,38709849,Ginger,"The listing description was exactly as presented, very nice, clean and quiet neighborhood.  We really enjoyed our stay, parking was tight but I believe that is the norm for the city.  Thank you for the coffee and chocolate!  "
7418814,43273869,2015-08-18,7900580,Larissa,"My husband, mother, and I stayed in Kelly and her husband's daylight basement for 5 days while we were checking out neighborhoods for our upcoming move to Seattle. It was fantastic! The space is spotless, and super comfortable. I was a little worried about having my mother on a sofa bed, but she was totally fine and slept great.

It's quiet and convenient - Kelly even leaves a book with a list/directions to local places for food, drinks, etc. There's a Whole Foods within walking distance, and the place is really convenient to freeways and getting around town. 

Finally, Kelly and her husband are so sweet! They were available if we had questions, but mostly just left us to our wandering about the city. And they have the cutest little dog, Rocco. We would definitely stay here again. "
7418814,43808174,2015-08-22,8880386,Spencer," Really enjoyed our stay. Kelly's place is super pleasant, immaculately clean and in a very nice location within easy walking distance of some great places for coffee, food or beer. Kelly was a pleasure to deal with -- very friendly and responsive. Great option for staying near the U-district. We would happily stay there again. "
7418814,45125897,2015-08-31,17816276,Youngmin,"Kelly's place is awesome.  We love her neighborhood surrounded by trees and flowers. The grocery stores (Whole foods market & Farmers market), cafe, park, even U of Washington are walking distance. That is very convenient.  Everything we need to stay is there. We enjoyed sitting on a chair as feeling the fresh air and playing her dollable dog, 'Rocky' in front of porch. Kitchen is very confortable to cook. She prepared olive oil, spices, dinnerware, and many things to cook easily. Kelly and her husband, Patrick are so nice. They care guests sincerely. If we visit seattle to see our sons, we want to stay at Kelly's house again.   "
7418814,46168741,2015-09-08,40619236,Theo,"My son and me had a great stay for one week at Kelly's. Kelly and her husband are perfect hosts. Very friendly and helpful. The apartment is exactly as described: spaceous, clean, well equipped. For a basement it is pretty light. Has it's own entrance and opens to the garden side. The neighborhood is residential and quiet, parking on the street easy.
All in all we had a great time and can highly recommend it."
7418814,49337989,2015-10-03,38223058,Sarah,"Kelly was so easy to work with - very accommodating. The apartment is wonderful - very spacious. The private, keyless access made coming and going easy and I never felt like I was disturbing anyone. As a 3-week renter, she gave me access to my own washer and dryer, as well as space to store my bicycle. Kelly was friendly and helpful with every request - even as small as me needing a vase for flowers I purchased at the market. The apartment is not completely sound-proof from the house above - I could often hear footsteps and voices, but nothing that ever woke me up or kept me awake. The location was awesome. Walking distance from anything I needed in Roosevelt/Ravenna and just close enough to the U-district for those special amenities. The bus stop is one block away, too, with direct access to downtown. I will certainly consider staying here on my next trip to Seattle. I highly recommend this rental - especially if you're staying more than a few days. The apartment is spacious enough for two to stay very comfortably (in a real bed) but definitely large enough to have additional guests visit for meals or study sessions."
7418814,49905408,2015-10-07,42150330,Deborah," Ravenna/Roosevelt Roost met all our expectations. Quiet, clean, comfortable, very well cared for. We were so happy to stay in such a nice apartment in a convenient neighborhood.

7418814,55113894,2015-11-28,92973,Andrew,"The apartment was very nice, exactly as described. Everything was in great shape, well-maintained and very comfortable. Kelly was an attentive, flexible and super-helpful host. 

I live nearby, and we rented the apartment for my parents who were visiting from out of town. They want to stay there again, and I plan to recommend the spot to other out-of-town guests as well!

843812,3754925,2013-03-11,419381,Cathy,"Eric's home was a comfortable home away from home.  We stayed there for 4 nights and the space was spacious enough for three adults and our one year old and everything we needed was provided for.  Because of the wonderfully high ceilings, there is a lot of great acoustics in the place which meant we had to be extra quiet when our son was napping or sleeping.  The abundant windows comfortably warmed up the entire house for us considering it was March in Seattle (not to mention it also made it bright and sunny during the day)!  There are some nice local shops, restaurants and coffee shops a few blocks away which we took advantage of on our daily walks.  Thank you for sharing your wonderful home with us!"
843812,3797612,2013-03-16,3731987,Genevieve,even more beautiful thank the pictures! amazing location. thank you so much for sharing your home with us
843812,3840152,2013-03-19,5253951,Haddy,"Any initial hesitation I had of staying in this zero energy house vanished as soon as I  walked into Eric's spacious, bright and warm contemporary home.  The place was spotlessly clean, new and decorated in a minimal fashion that worked well with both the contemporary and antique pieces around the rooms.  Although the kitchen was well stocked with supplies and equipment which Eric generously offered us to use, we had only 3 nights to enjoy Seattle so we dined out but definitely enjoyed the open concept kitchen and eating area was great for breakfasts.    From the very interesting eco-friendly house construction features such as water-saving dual-flush toilets (the design channels the clean water used to fill the tank for the next flush through the sink on the lid so that when you flush, you simply wash your hands at the same time!), to the solar panels on the roof to collect energy enough to run the entire home (yes even with all the rain!) to the reclaimed building supplies such as in the gorgeous wood floors, my family of 5 gave 2 thumbs up that this was indeed a vey cool and comfortable place to stay.  With regards to location, Ballard is a fabulous central location to explore most places one would want to go when visiting Seattle.  We were at the SOMA & Pike Place market within 10 minutes and just a few minutes to the Woodland Park Zoo.  We enjoyed the little boutiques and unique offerings that  Ballard features including the Ballard Sunday Farmers Market (amazing artisan food selections), to the occasional Viking/Norwegian influences in the neighborhood.  Although we have been to Seattle dozens of times (from Vancouver, Canada) and stayed at 4* hotels previously, we enjoyed this trip immensely as we could feel like a local instead of a tourist again. 
"
843812,6278222,2013-08-06,7028992,Peter,"The accommodations for six of us (4 adults, 2 children) were great. Nice bright home with lots of natural light. Fully equipped kitchen, quiet neighborhood, plenty of street parking, shopping near by.
Very modern with great energy saving features.
What more would you want? "
843812,15380441,2014-07-07,17599800,Hasnain And Jenny,"We had a wonderful 4th of July weekend in Seattle. Eric and Alex left a whole book of tips for us that made the trip super easy. The house is beautiful and in a quiet neighborhood, but also close to many attractions. Loved it!"
843812,23366245,2014-11-30,21922811,Bobby,"Our family very much enjoyed the house. My wife loved the look and feel of the place. I really appreciated the fact that net zero added to the space and in no way felt restrictive or onerous. The kids got a kick out of the Caroma basins. It was warm and comfortable, even as it was snowing outside. Definitely looking forward to staying there again."
843812,25660765,2015-01-22,13717425,Ashlee,"Eric's zero energy home was simply amazing. We had a surprisingly sunny stay in Seattle and the light beaming through the windows is just magical. His cozy, warm home is nestled into an amazing part of Ballard and we were able to walk or take just a short drive to everything we needed during our stay. While he was out of the country on holiday during the duration communication was seamless. His home also provided an amazing lesson in conservation, while I'm sure we generated more trash and used more energy than he's accustomed we realized just how wasteful we are in our daily lives, the ability to spend a week composting and conserving was truly a gift. Did I mention the beds are amazingly comfortable as well? Yes that too!"
843812,41118128,2015-08-04,37939406,Shelly,"I stayed at Eric's Zero Energy home for a weekend with my family when we were visiting for a July wedding. Eric was great!  He was super responsive to all of my questions and very welcoming.  The house was wonderful.   My family was amazed at how well the house was stocked with everything we could have needed!  It was perfect for what we needed, we couldn't have asked for anything more.   As a bonus, the house was very convenient to everything in Seattle.  I don't think we were in the car longer than 20 minutes to get anywhere - and that included the trip to the airport!

 I would recommend to stay at this house to anyone!"
843812,46137556,2015-09-08,7366355,Linda,"Eric left us  printed information about the house, about Seattle , transportation. Like a true tour guide. Made us feel comfortable. He was in touch all the time by email if anything was needed. The neighbourhood is beautiful, quite far from downtown but we were looking to stay at Ballards. We even took a run from his house to the centre and it is so worth it because there are amazing parks along the river, close to Fremont. Excelent experience "
843812,51430254,2015-10-20,38505238,Christopher,"Eric's place is clean, modern, and comfortable. I had a great experience, and would recommend it to anyone!"
7381005,46204145,2015-09-08,1682242,Dave,"Magic & Jeff's place was incredible-- the location was perfect & near all the great shops, bars, and restaurants in Capitol Hill. This place was a STEAL especially for the price, location, and quality of the apartment (and the hosts!) The apartment & room were clean, stylish, comfortable, and very safe.

While Magic was out of town, his roommate Jeff welcomed my friend & I into their apartment and was extremely nice, helpful, and even invited us out to join him & his friends at a local party. I definitely think both Magic & Jeff went out of their way to make my visit to Seattle one of the best trips I've taken. On my last day, my flight was scheduled really late in the evening (way past the standard check-out) and Magic & Jeff were kind enough to let me  hang around until I had to catch my flight without any problem. They were both two of the coolest, down to earth, and friendliest people I've met while traveling. I would ABSOLUTELY recommend staying with them anytime. "
7381005,48957404,2015-09-29,22422185,Joshua,"Israel was very responsive and welcoming.  The place was very clean (I happened to have a black light with me and checked to make sure).  There are heavy curtains that make it easier to sleep in without the sun bothering you. Israel's roommate Jeff was very helpful and friendly.  The Capitol Hill neighborhood is very cool with an active nightlife, great restaurants and is easy to get to."
9061048,53566322,2015-11-09,4532754,Ruby,"Daniel was a great host and his location was wonderful!  Daniel was very flexible and hospitable and the apartment was spotless, just like the pictures.  The neighborhood was great and was in walking distance to everything we needed (restaurants, bars, coffee shops, grocery stores, and our event at the Seattle Center).  Thanks again for everything!"
234898,751700,2011-11-28,1426391,Matt,We had a wonderful stay at Megan's and have recommended it to all our friends.  
234898,790094,2011-12-17,373340,Casey,"Wallingford Studio was the perfect place for me to stay during a recent work trip.  ""Studio"" often implies small and cramped, but this is anything but.  I had lots of great, well-appointed space to spread out and relax.  The kitchen is nicely equipped. Had I shook of laziness long enough to actually cook, it would have been perfect.  The bed is incredibly warm and comfy, and the bathroom is spacious and modern.  I cant recommend these accommodations more."
234898,844509,2012-01-06,1522662,Samir,My parents had a great stay.  Very clean and comfortable.
234898,863467,2012-01-15,1533114,S.,Cozy studio. Just like the pictures! We enjoyed the stay a lot. 
234898,878339,2012-01-23,1559052,Maggie,Beautiful space that was more than we could have asked for!   There's a kitchenette to use and a beautiful bathroom that you could spend all day in.  Everything was very clean and comfy.  Megan made sure we had everything we needed and were plenty warm during a big snow storm.  Close enough to the university that you can walk there and also on a main bus line that runs frequently.  Would definitely stay here again.
234898,895969,2012-02-01,285157,Marilyn,"Megan's Wallingford studio was the perfect home away from home for me.  I stayed 6 nights and truly enjoyed it!  The studio is quite large, well appointed and very cozy.  Megan even had cookies set out for me to enjoy...how nice is that?  I cooked in the large kitchenette, I soaked in the DEEP, LARGE bathtub and I slept super cozy in that super cozy bed!  Thanks again Megan!  I recommend this place without hesitation and I hope to return soon."
234898,900727,2012-02-04,373340,Casey,"Still great.  The Wallingford studio is a perfect place for a stay for the discerning business traveler who likes staying in cool new neighborhoods, rather than downtown proper.  It's a great, super comfortable place, and the food within walking distance is unbeatable."
234898,905234,2012-02-06,1644679,Derek,The studio was clean and highly updated.  Really great finishes make it feel like an upscale stay.  Megan is a great hostess and is there to accomodate when needed.  Wallingford area is one of our favorites areas to hang out in.  Lots to do and plenty in walking distance. 
234898,930714,2012-02-19,1622439,Bobby,"We were comfortable, cozy, and warm in Megan's studio. Very clean, and imbued with an artist's energy. I love Megan's art :). Lots of space to flop out after a long day hoofing it around Seattle. Plenty public transportation stops nearby to reach all parts of the city, including SeaTac. Great restaurants, one after another, on N 45th Street. A perfect poetry bookstore around the corner! Imagine that! We would stay at Megan's again, and will recommend her to friends and family."
234898,953499,2012-02-27,86690,Anne,"Spent the weekend in Megan's comfortable basement studio.
My tall husband didn't mind the low ceilings and loved to be able to cook simple meals in the kitchen. The bed was cozy and the bathroom was pretty with a deep tub/shower to relax in. We enjoyed walking everywhere in Wallingford, eating some great ethnic food, window shopping, drinking lots of good coffee, and hanging out in the public library for an afternoon. It was a wonderful place to spend a relaxing weekend! Thanks for sharing your home, Megan! "
234898,996141,2012-03-13,1639347,Amy,"We had a wonderful at Wallingford Studio 4622!  Everything was as expected and more!  We would and hope to visit again.  Megan was very congenial and helpful.  Great location in a very accessible neighborhood.
Thanks Megan and Airbnb.  Amy and Bill"
234898,1016364,2012-03-19,1581651,Karen,This is a wonderful little apartment with all the amenities.  I especially loved the deep soaking tub.  The Wallingford neighborhood is charming with lots of restaurants within walking distance.  The host even provided toys for my grandson.  I enjoyed my stay.
234898,1178509,2012-04-25,1893319,Ireta,"This is a basement apartment, well furnished and very comfortable. I enjoyed my stay there."
234898,1209860,2012-05-01,2018088,Kristen & Matt,"This is a very quiet and private place to stay. Megan is nice though I only saw her for 5 minutes when I arrived. The studio is quiet and clean. It has all the cooking equipment you need and a few of the basic ingredients like salt, sugar, and oil were already there. WiFi works well. No TV though...it adds to the relaxing experience:)."
234898,1305812,2012-05-19,565239,Anton,"The place was nice and definitely as pictured. Megan was a great host. The reason for the three stars is thus: One, it was definitely very cold in the basement and while Megan said she would adjust the temperature, it was quite inconvenient. Two, no oven. Three, if you are fortunate to drive a car, parking was pretty unavailable near the house. And four, it was cold, cold, cold. Anyways, I gave it three stars because the price was comparable to other places where you get to adjust the heat, parking isn't a concern, and you can get a full kitchen."
234898,1327731,2012-05-22,889698,Janice,"Great Location! Lovely property.   Immaculate clean.  Super comfy linens and blankets.  Firm bed.  Well equipped studio kitchen.... we didn't have the need or desire to cook, especially with all the fabulous restaurants and cafes within walking distance.  Comfy couches for hanging around in the morning sipping coffee.  "
234898,1365249,2012-05-28,2326279,Alyssa,"Nice quiet location, easy walk to restaurants and a quick drive downtown (15 minutes). We always found street parking on the block and had no problems. Megan was nice and took care of everything we needed.  "
234898,1388460,2012-05-31,1540789,Sara And Josh,"Megan's studio was perfect.... great location, clean, and plenty of space.  We absolutely recommend it and would love to stay here again"
234898,1441133,2012-06-09,1652981,Gloria,"Unlike a hotel or motel with corridors to one's quarters, Wallingford Studio 4622 was like home--quiet, spacious, comfortable, clean, at an unheard-of bargain price. We were happy to have found the apartment; and we were surprised to find in the bathroom a deep Japanese furo (tub)."
234898,2051230,2012-08-21,1321431,Stephanie,"The place was great. It was convenient to everywhere we wanted to go while we were in Seattle. Wallingford is a great location and I was so happy to find Megan's place! We would definitely stay again. Also, I would note that the mattress is extra firm. So if you're looking for a soft cushy experience, book elsewhere. However, my husband and I slept great! We were extremely happy with the place and would recommend it to anyone else visiting Seattle!"
234898,2096250,2012-08-25,502164,Carrie,Great apartment-- convenient and everything I needed. Thanks Megan!
234898,2189823,2012-09-04,2173131,Faye,"The Neighborhood--Our first image,  ""what a cute neighborhood""!.  I am guessing the homes were built in the 1930s.  At night all the porch lights were lit and on Saturday night two families were sitting on their porches having wine.  The neighborhood felt very warm.  The parking is limited on the street, but on our 3 days there, we never had a problem finding a space.  
The Studio--The studio was exactly like the picture.   Large space which also includes are large closet which I didn't see mentioned in any of the other reviews.  Megan mentioned noise from her 7 yr old.  We heard occasional footsteps, but nothing that was bothersome; otherwise the studio was extremely quiet. We didn't cook although the kitchen seemed to be fully stocked with utensils.  There were many canned lights and basement style windows which made you forget that you were in the basement.  I need a lot of light to feel comfortable and the studio had what I needed.  The studio is beautifully decorated with maple counter tops and a cork bathroom floor.  This was a concern for me because I was afraid that I might damage some of the finishes.  Both are sensitive to water and I felt like I had to be very careful.  Megan has dish towels and bath mats available to make keeping the finishes looking good easy.  If you are a slob, this may not be the place for you.  We would defintely stay with Megan again if we are in Seattle.  "
234898,2234910,2012-09-08,3452322,Vishwath,"My wife and I stayed at Megan's for 5 days and we really liked it. The  decor was tasteful and cozy, and the location was very convenient. The  downside of a basement dwelling is that sounds from upstairs, especially footsteps, transfer easily. But in our case it was minimal and only in the mornings. Overall, it was a very positive experience, we would definitely stay there again. Thanks Megan!"
234898,2272010,2012-09-12,2837129,Emily,"Megan was a terrific host - she was hospitable and always willing to meet our needs. Her studio is in an awesome location & was plenty spacious & comfy for 2 of us.  And, her recommendations for area restaurants were spot on.  Thanks, Megan!"
234898,2307397,2012-09-17,549804,Ira,"My wife and I spent six nights at the 4622 Studio and found it to be just as advertised and everything we could have wanted in a place to stay in Seattle. It was very clean, tastefully decorated , comfortable and conveniently located- and all at a terrific price.  Also- we liked that we had the use of an entire apartment just for ourselves.  I would highly recommend Megan's place to anyone looking to stay in Seattle.
Thanks Megan."
234898,2379402,2012-09-23,549804,Ira,"4 Stars.  Megan provides a clean, comfortable and convenient place to stay when visiting Seattle.  We most enjoyed having an entire apartment for ourselves.  The space has been thoughtfully furnished and provides more than adequate space for a couple.  Visitors 6ft and taller might not find it quite a comfortable as we did- as the ceiling is low in places to allow for heat ducts (basement space).  That aside- it is really a good choice- in a good neighborhood - with good access to  
some fine restaurants and excellent coffee.   Highly recommended.
Photos etc were accurate; place suer clean; host was responsive, location great for us; check-in problem-free."
234898,2387955,2012-09-23,3631122,Rory,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
234898,2447665,2012-09-29,3001431,Megan,"We stayed at Megan's studio for 4 nights. It's spotlessly clean, beautifully decorated and super comfortable. Megan even offers a closet full of different pillows and blankets so you can find the one that's just right for you. The studio is walking distance to everything in Wallingford, has easy bus access to downtown Seattle, and there's plenty of street parking. 
Wi-fi was fast and easy. Megan took great care of us. "
234898,2503735,2012-10-04,3309455,Kay,"Megan was a good host.  She accommodated our privacy, but gave us opportunities to contact her if we wished. Her apartment was within walking distance of a neighborhood commercial area with many good restaurants, and it was close to bus transportation.  Megan provided transportation schedules and recommendations for restaurants.  The apartment was a lovely, modern space with a kitchen and private entrance, and it was quiet, no t.v.  The bed was very firm, something to consider if you like a softer mattress, and Megan provided extra pillows and linens in the closet.  We enjoyed our stay and would go back again.  "
234898,2555697,2012-10-09,2512617,Kevin,"Megan's studio was perfect for my stay in Seattle. The space is warm and inviting and the neighborhood was quite and safe. Anytime I'm in Seattle again, I will definitely stay at Studio 4622. I highly recommend this space. Feel free to write me privately if you have any questions."
234898,2678237,2012-10-22,1887384,Jim,Very comfortable stay.  Particularly loved the mattress; pillows and sheets - all top class.  Great location and a great hostess. 
234898,2786585,2012-11-02,413396,Paula,"Megan's studio was a very comfortable and delightful place to spend a week as part of my move from NYC to Seattle. The creative vibe to the place enhanced the whole experience, on top of the nice open space, the great bed (I love firm mattresses and got great sleep on this one) and the fantastic bathroom. We made great use of the kitchenette -- it was just perfect for the space and made us even more comfortable. The location itself is very convenient to both the Eastside, where I'm working, and downtown plus lots of other neighborhoods. Some very nice restaurants in Wallingford, which is a charming place. And Megan herself was terrific to deal with in all communications. Highly recommended!"
234898,2820781,2012-11-05,3619937,Freddi,"Wonderfully cozy place in a super convenient location! Lovely neighborhood and house! Megan was very accommodating and communicative despite  my last minute inquiry, provided everything as needed and left us to feel like we were in our own home.
Highly recommended!"
234898,2874339,2012-11-13,864788,Michael,"Megan has a beautiful space.  The studio is just as described.  Bed is super comfortable, shower water is strong and hot, and WiFi is strong.  It is perfectly clean; very obvious Megan takes pride in her space.  Very welcoming to travelers.

It is a perfect location for me when I visit my son; it's about a 5 minute walk to his apartment.  In another 5 you are at Starbucks and another 2 the Rusty Pelican (great place for breakfast).  Local pubs are all over.  Dick's Hamburgers is at 1st/45th.  A ten minute walk to the bus stop to downtown and close to I5 if you have a car.

Highly recommend Megan's studio if you need or want to be in the Wallingford area.

234898,3082283,2012-12-13,315949,Nancy,"We loved staying in Megan's place.  It was clean, very nicely appointed (great bed, nice sheets and towels, great kitchen), had excellent wifi, nice working spaces, and the bathroom and its soaking tub were a special delight.  On street parking was free,and we could always find a place nearby.  The apartment was quiet and warm, with comfortable seating, really nice.  I'm not sure the photos do it justice, though.  Megan was a great resource for us, answering questions, providing guidance quickly and thoroughly -- and she was so nice.  Another reviewer mentioned footsteps from above; we heard the running of little feet very occasionally, and it was not a problem.  We'll be back.   I highly recommend her place in Seattle."
234898,3142224,2012-12-23,1600866,Jun,"Megan's place is perfect. Super clean, big space, comfortable bed, beautiful deep tub/shower, and a nice kitchen. I agree with the previous reviewer who said the pictures don't do the place justice. The Wallingford neighborhood is great. Nearby to lots of cool spots including shops, restaurants and a big, wonderful lake and park. You could easily spend a trip to Seattle exploring this neighborhood alone, but there are a number of buses that can quickly take you to other areas.

Thanks Megan for making our transition into Seattle easy. Highly recommended! "
234898,3166780,2012-12-27,388744,Roger,"I really enjoyed my stay here - it is very comfortable, clean, and well decorated.  Megan is a great host and was easy to communicate with.

We had some problems with the WiFi, but Meghan was diligent in addressing the issue.  As I said before, if you need or want to stay in this part of Seattle, you could not do better and could do a whole lot worse.  Bravo."
234898,4188076,2013-04-16,3609538,Florina,"Megan's studio was lovely. My husband and I are artists ourselves so this instantly felt more like home!

The house itself is located in a very convenient street in charming Wallingford (across from Dick's!). We'd definitely stay here again!"
234898,4241192,2013-04-21,5672258,Geordie,"We had a very comfortable stay in Seattle. The studio is a perfect little hideaway and is very private.

Location-wise, we could walk to Wallingford and the University District, it is close to bus stops, and if you want to drive, it's close to I5 but far enough away that you don't hear freeway noise! The studio is completely well furnished and comfortable. A good bed, a great bath tub, a ceramic stove and anything you might need in the kitchen, including some non-perishable staples that are really helpful if you want to cook in.  Wifi was also important to us. And parking was relable. She is on a quiet narrow street, and we did not always get a spot immediately in front of the house, but there was always something close. Best of all, Megan is responsive to texts and emails, even if she's temporarily in Japan! She has an eye for adding beauty, and you can now enjoy a beautiful back yard."
234898,7259290,2013-09-13,6800343,William,"We had a lovely stay! This was our first time in Seattle and really 
enjoyed our experience.
The place is clean and spacious. There's even a workshop for art projects (that we didn't use but enjoyed as part of the environment). The bath tub is large and nice. 
The location is near bus stops (that takes you directly downtown), few block away from restaurants (Thai Toms is an amazing ), and close to a cute parks and nature. We will definitely stay there again for future visits.

234898,7484940,2013-09-22,7798800,Caroline,Really nice studio in a very convenient vibrant community.
234898,7584081,2013-09-25,5681324,Shanni,"Was here for four nights recently with my boyfriend and we had such a comfortable stay. The space is really lovely and clean-- really nice place to return to if you are sight seeing during the day, it has everything you will need. It is a 20min bus ride to and from the city and while we stayed we made use of the nearby 7-11, QFC, and laundromat-- so convenient. Dick's drive-in is also nearby and we tried Molly Moon's ice cream, Tea House Kuan Yin and Issian izakaya on 45th, all wonderful and close by. (Also Tilth restaurant!) Megan is super nice and responsive.  "
234898,8098091,2013-10-15,9152510,Patrick,"I booked this stay for my San Jose friends. Megan was a pleasure and easy to work with in setting up the stay on their behalf.  Bottom line: Great accommodations for the price and location. Wallingford is a fine n-hood, very central with easy access to the best of Seattle's attributes.  Check-in time will be a challenge for many travelers (such as my friends who were unable to get in before 7 pm).  While Megan provides an explanation in her materials, there are two back doors from which to choose. This was initially confusing for my friends. Tip: the studio door is the more hidden one.   I would definitely use Megan's place again should the need arise."
234898,8276524,2013-10-23,3095122,Kelly,"Megan's basement studio was a perfect fit for our trip to Seattle. Clean, stylish, and the perfect location! The street was almost never crowded and we could find parking each evening within a block radius of the house. Overall the experience was GREAT! Megan was most helpful when I lost the confirmation email and a quiet upstairs neighbor. Thanks Megan! "
234898,8336046,2013-10-26,5526130,Dan,"Had an enjoyable stay. Clean, cozy space in a beautiful, classic Northeast neighborhood. "
234898,8535613,2013-11-04,7317455,Shannon,The house is in a wonderful location and was a great place to stay for a week while we looked for a long term rental. Adorable little basement with everything you need! Megan was super flexible with us and very easy to work with. 
234898,8705833,2013-11-12,4024359,Sam,"Excellent place, great location, and accommodating/very friendly landlord/owner. 
Completely satisfactory stay and I have only good things to say!
Highly recommended.  "

234898,50506738,2015-10-12,19930213,Benjamin,"Great basement apartment in a great location in NE Seattle. Megan's friend, Lizzie, was our primary contact for the stay.  She made arrangements for us to pick up keys as we were arriving late, although she ended up greeting us when we arrived a little earlier than expected. We never had any trouble parking near the house, and the neighborhood was great.  We had easy access to I-5 to drive into downtown or to other parts of Seattle.  The house was about 1 mile from Green Lake Park, which was a great place for running.  The apartment was clean and had everything we needed.  No complaints!"
234898,51926423,2015-10-25,39815803,Frank,This was a great place to stay. Private and quiet. Lizzie was a terrific host. 
234898,53482684,2015-11-09,45400225,Heather,Listing looked just the like the photos. Host was helpful and followed our lead in terms of hosting style. Love the neighborhood- we ended up feeling like locals by the end of our stay 
234898,54864571,2015-11-25,34108455,Dorie,"This apartment was very nice, clean and more spacious than the pictures showed. My husband, college age son and I stayed there . It was on a quiet side-street close to Wallingford and Green Lake, a perfect location for us. The manager, who lived upstairs, was very welcoming, helpful and respectful of our space. The washer and dryer in the apartment came in handy for us.  
We enjoyed our stay there and would definitely stay there again. "
234898,55207969,2015-11-29,1671839,Erin,"The apartment was clean and cozy during the thanksgiving holiday. Everything we needed was there and we were able to access green lake, Wallingford, and other great Seattle spots from the apartment. Lizzie did a great job communicating even though she was abroad during our stay! We will definitely stay here again when we come back to Seattle! "
234898,56299547,2015-12-12,8364150,Amanda,"loved the location, close to great coffee shops and stores. the bedroom was cozy and has a great bath tub. "
234898,56938480,2015-12-20,49145703,Jennifer,Love the place. Will come back and stay here again when I'm in Seattle. Thanks Lizzie for being very responsive and accommodating! :)
566435,2199790,2012-09-04,2675289,Melanie,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Flor's Place. She is the perfect hostess, so welcoming and friendly and full of great stories. Flor truly made us feel at home, only better because we were treated to her delicious breakfasts each morning, and didn't have to lift a finger. Our conversations over breakfast and afterwards were always a blast, and by the end of our stay we felt like family. 

Flor was more than happy to help us any way she could: from picking us up & dropping us off at the airport, to suggestions of where to go and what to see, and how to find the bus. Her house is conveniently located for easy access to the bus routes, but far enough out from the city that it is quiet and relaxed. 

I would highly recommend anyone visiting Seattle to stay at Flor's Place. You're in for a treat!"
566435,2487996,2012-10-02,3262808,Leah,Flor's Place is absolutely amazing! We recently hosted 4 international guests from Tanzania here for a conference at UW. Flor went above and beyond as a hostess -- our team was calling her Mama by the end of their stay! We could not have imagined a better place for our team members to stay. Flor cooks delicious and plentiful breakfasts. The rooms are very clean and comfortable and each contain a fridge and microwave for convenience! Flor even showed our guests around parts of Seattle!! We will DEFINITELY use Flor's place again for anyone who comes here from out of town in the future. Look no further - you have found home in Seattle!
566435,5040345,2013-06-09,6404545,Justin,"I am staying at Flor's Home for 10 weeks, and Flor has offered me a great experience since the day I arrived in Seattle. She offered to pick me up from the airport and told me to make myself at home. I am well over 6 foot, so I was unable to fit in the original twin bed that was in the room, but Flor was extremely accommodating and went out of her way to get a bed that was the appropriate size for me as quickly as possible. 
The first few days before I started my internship, Flor made a few different delicious Peruvian breakfast items, checking in about time the night before, and even woke me up to let me know when it was ready. The house is very clean and welcoming, and has everything a visitor or resident would need, both within the house and specifically in the individual rooms. There is a microwave and a refrigerator in the room, and if you would like to cook the kitchen is available to do so as well.
Overall, I would highly recommend staying with Flor for an pleasant, affordable stay while visiting Seattle - the house is in Ballard with about a 30 minute bus ride to downtown. I've a great experience so far and would definitely come back the next time I come to Seattle.
"
566435,5693285,2013-07-12,6166218,Katie,"I stayed at Flor's place for almost 5 weeks while I was looking for a more permanent residence.  It was very comfortable and quiet, she had my room cleaned several times and offered to help me out with my errands etc. since I was so busy with my new job. The amenities were good, I liked having my own fridge and microwave,and dvd's to watch.  I was able to use the kitchen to make bigger meals to bring to work.  She made great food and let me cook alongside her one day so I got to learn about the Peruvian food/culture a bit. Was great being able to interact with other guests from all over the world with all sorts of different experiences.  There were a lot of other guests when I was there, but it was always pretty quiet, and I work night shift so I was able to sleep well even during the day.  She's super knowledgeable about the area. I only wish I'd had more time and a better work schedule that allowed me to do more when I was there!"
566435,5796686,2013-07-16,1862955,Dori,"Our stay at Flor's house was mostly very nice.  She is very friendly and an interesting person.  She has a big house in a quiet neighborhood with a grocery store and a Starbucks walking distance.
There was a full size refrigerator in our room -  it is a bit noisy but I have ear plugs so it was not a problem.  The room was fine, but there are lots of people in the house, and only 1 bathroom upstairs so it got a little busy at times.  Flor put nice snacks and drinks in the frig, and offered us samples of her great Peruvian cooking.  All in all, a very positive experience.
Thank you Flor!"
566435,6276753,2013-08-06,276584,Ashok,"We enjoyed our time at Flor's Place.  We did not get the chance to meet Flor, but her family made sure we were well set up and made special arrangements for our infant child.  The house is in a nice neighborhood with easy parking, a bus line a block away, and a supermarket and various restaurants only a couple blocks away."
566435,6357229,2013-08-09,3805383,Rachel,"We had a wonderful stay at Flor's Place! Everyone was very friendly and respectful of our privacy, but eager to help. Public transportation is easily accessible nearby, and the neighborhood is lovely. I highly recommend this place!

566435,7990150,2013-10-11,7529467,Oihan,"Great experience at Flor's Place. They made me feel like being home. The people in the house was very friendly and we spent good times sharing the dinner.
Flor is a really nice host, 100% recomendable. I forgot my driving license in Spain and she helped me in everything she could.
I can only say thanks!"
566435,13386331,2014-05-26,13387683,Cecilia,"Flor is a wonderful host! She prepared everything for a comfortable home-like stay for me. The room and bathroom are both very nice and clean with all the essentials. She even picked me up from the train station which made my trip so much easier. The only issue is the location, which is a bit far from downtown area, but with 24-hr supermarkets and food options nearby. If you don't mind travelling a bit, Flor's place is a great choice!"
566435,14443093,2014-06-19,15686524,Kathleen,"Flor was a wonderful host.  The house was a little busy, but very quiet.  Flor lent us a bicycle which helped us explore Seattle.  The neighborhood was also very convenient for buses.  We enjoyed our stay and our vacation to Seattle."
566435,16211960,2014-07-23,15481032,Sidney,"Flor's place is a wonderful experience for my first time in the US. Hospitable host who ensures all your needs are met. If you would like to be left alone or just want to talk to someone, Flor can do both ways. The house is exceptionally good, with all the basic amenities and even more. Flor provides with towels, drinks, fruits and food, and everything that you may have missed out along the way. Bed is cozy, and good to sleep in.

Location-wise, it is good if you like a quiet neighborhood. Has many diners and grocer's nearby, and it is quite convenient to reach downtown Seattle in, with many bus services going in and out at anytime of the day."
566435,17009571,2014-08-05,18220061,Candace,"Flor was great showing me around to where the parks, bus stops, & grocery store was. Easy to walk to the bus stop from the house and it was a cheaper option to pay Flor to drive us to the airport rather than use a taxi or take a 2 hour bus ride. So that was nice.  We stayed in the purple room which was cute and fully equipped with microwave and fridge which was helpful. It was a warmer week in Seattle and we kept the windows open as it was very warm inside until late evening. Having the fan in the room was a huge help and if you are gone during the day out and about like we were it worked for us. 
The house is a fun place with so much life and color. It felt safe and secure. 
Flor takes pride in her well run air bnb location. It's a busy place but kept very well and she is always available to help or answer questions. 
We had a great time and fun experience in Seattle. "
566435,18957171,2014-09-03,2292065,Ashley,"I booked a room in Flor's house for my in-laws while they were visiting us in Seattle. It is a beautiful house and Flor takes her job as host very seriously. She has thought of virtually everything, but if there is something you still need then you simply have to ask and she will be happy to accommodate you. One morning, she made us all Peruvian-styled omelets and they were muy delicioso. Since she rents more than one room, we had the opportunity to chat with other guests at breakfast which was treat. In short, my in-laws loved it and are already talking about planning a trip back to Seattle, and bringing their friends. "
566435,19255593,2014-09-08,79909,Christian,"The 5-star House is a real pleasure to stay in. The rooms are comfortable, bright, clean and have all the facilities you can expect - and on top of that Flor is a wonderful host with whom we shared many conversations. There is a great international vibe in the beautiful house and the area is adorable (we took a run in the morning and saw much of the neighborhood - highly recommended). Additionally several bus lines runs practically right outside the door, making it really easy to get to downtown and many other of the charming areas around Seattle. We'll surely come back to stay with Flor next time we're in town! "
566435,19662259,2014-09-15,7214359,Amelia,"Flor's house is like a magical wonderland, we didn't want to leave. We felt completely at home, free to roam around as we pleased. All the rooms are full of personal touches. Flor put loads of girlie trinkets in our room when she found out two girls were staying. She's a wonderful host with a great sense of humour and it was a pleasure to be invited into her home.

The location is great for the northern parts of Seattle like Ballard and Fremont and the University District. It's a little further to downtown but cost us about fifteen quid in a taxi, not bad. Plus, there's a great park and beach nearby.

Seattle's superb and I'd come back again just to hang out with Flor."
566435,21328020,2014-10-14,8615760,Tausha,"The neighborhood was nice and quiet. Flor and her family were so welcoming!!!  Flor is the sweetest and goes above and beyond to make sure you have everything you need. The rooms are full of every possible thing you could need and the little things she thought about like the eye mask were amazing when my husband wanted to watch TV and I wanted to block out the light.  

Flor shared her Peruvian spaghetti and we loved it.   We didn't spend a lot of time at the house since we spent our days traveling the city, but anytime we were there it was a pleasant experience.  "
566435,25566342,2015-01-19,25624543,Jenni,"As the name says, it was a 5-STAR STAY with Flor! As it was my first time in Seattle I was looking for more than ""just a room"" - and that was exactly what I found! The rooms are all cozy and clean and you will feel at home right away! Flor and her husband were really kind: inviting me trying new food, showing me around the neighborhood, answering all my questions. It is a safe and nice neighborhood with a big variety of different buses that bring you to Downtown or the university or other places. Within a short walk you'll find a grocery store that provides you with everything - although Flor has everything you could have forgotten, too ;) What I really enjoyed too was the short distance to Carkeek Park - a lovely spot to enjoy some of Seattle's nature. I can totally recommend staying at Flor's and will totally go there again if I come back to Seattle! "
566435,27783183,2015-03-11,28655347,Kelly,"A really great unforgettable stay in THE 5-STAR HOUSE with Ms. Flor! First of all, this was my first time to book a place from Airbnb, and also this is my first time to visit Seattle. Flor has made my living fantastic.
THE 5-STAR HOUSE is a cozy, nice and clean place. You don't need to worry about if you have forgotten to carry anything. Flor has prepared for everything! The neighborhood is quiet and safe. Many buses can take you to the downtown. Also, there is a QFC only 5 minutes from the house. You can buy anything there. I have bought stamps to deliver my postcards. 
About Ms. Flor, she is really really nice, lovely and smart. When I first arrived at house, I told her I was starving, she immediately drove me to the Anthony's house. We enjoyed happy hour and fantastic view. Flor told me many interesting things about the city and herself. We had a great time! 
Thank you Flor, thank you THE 5 STAR HOUSE for giving me such a sweet memory of the entire living.  I will definetely  recommend it to my friends.

Best,
Kelly"
566435,28492700,2015-03-24,29091640,Chris,Flor was friendly and jovial from our first meeting. She provided my girlfriend and I with information on the city as well as with maps to the surrounding area's public transit. She was very accommodating in the way that she stocks the room for you in a way that does not make you miss home. The room and house were both clean and inviting. Flor is a very hard working individual and is very passionate about her AirBnB reputation and is willing to go the extra mile for your comfort. 
566435,30612281,2015-04-25,26754664,Julie,Thank you for letting me into your space! You were very welcoming and readily availble for anything and everything! 
566435,33251524,2015-05-26,11455633,Katharine,This is the best place to stay when away from home because it feels just like home. Anything you could possibly need was provided. Super clean and friendly house mates. I hope to stay here again on my next visit!
566435,34138201,2015-06-05,13815725,Janelle,"This was my FIRST experience with air bnb. I have to say that I was very surprised at how easy it was. Flor, and her son Joseph were great guides and hosts! I felt at home, like Flor was an extension of my own family. I don't have anything negative to say. The only suggestion I have is to make it notably known bathrooms are shared. However, even with a full house my son and I had NO problems at all! Can't wait to stay here again. Room 10 is great for single moms or dads with 1 kid! "
566435,34703616,2015-06-11,27957978,Tandy,"Really enjoyed our stay at the 5-star house. Located within fairly easy access to transit to downtown. Flor was quite friendly and accommodating. She also has excellent security within the house, which is like a very nice hostel, while also making it easy to come and go. We'd certainly look at staying there again."
566435,35102113,2015-06-15,27512889,Abby,Flor's house is beautiful and clean.  My friend and I really had a good time there. The bus stop is near the house and convenient. She also provided some snack for us. I will highly recommend her house for my friends who want to visit Seattle. 
566435,35639074,2015-06-21,17949206,Sungyeong,Thank you Ms Flor for all you have done for us. I wanted to have more time talking with you but seemed you were pretty busy taking care of other things. But we were very satisfied with the foods filled in the fridge and sharing kitchen during our stay.
566435,36810317,2015-07-01,29283690,Bayarsaikhan,"Me and my family stayed at 5-star house for 8 days right after a loooong flights. Flor was really welcoming, and has tried everything she could make us feel more comfortable. The place is nice overall. Our kids loved the back yard and the grill area. Amenities are all well thought and put in places before you might need them. 

Thank you for Happy Birthday Song for my daughter!

Bayar and his family"
566435,37253390,2015-07-05,37005455,Yanling,"I spent 4 nights in the five-five star house, the room is so nice, just like home. Flor is a really nice lady, she tried everything to make me feel comfortable. I will stay in the five-star house when I come to Seattle next time."
566435,38028457,2015-07-12,36523603,Craig,"Had a wonderful stay. This house is ultra functional, everything you could possibly use is in your room. Our personal refrigerator was stocked with breakfast items and beverages, we had a sink, microwave, toaster, hotplate, and all pans, utensils, and supplies. The home was clean, safe, secure, comfortable, and positive. I think this would be an ideal location for international visitors and for long-term guests. Flor is an exceptionally organized and efficient host who would make sure any desire, need or concern you had was met. A super value for visiting Seattle!"
566435,39960913,2015-07-27,22162385,Sharry,"Thank you so much, Flor, for making my stay interresting and pleasant.  It is a great neighborhood for walking around.  "
566435,40472404,2015-07-31,36741728,Emma,"Flor was very welcoming to us, the house was just like the posting and very accomadting there were extra things if we needed them, food along with a fridge in our room and a microwave. The house as a whole was amazing, along with the people in it. She cooked us a traditional Peruvian dish for my birthday which was very good and a good time too. Needless to say, if we are ever in Seattle again, we'd be happy to visit flor. "
566435,41583260,2015-08-08,30452966,Danielle,"My kids and I stayed at Flor's 5-Star House for a week.  By the end of the week we felt like we were leaving a family member's home.  Flor and Nacho really go out of their way to make sure that guests are well taken care of and completely satisfied with their experience in the 5-Star House. 

Our room was very clean and comfortable with many useful amenities. Flor welcomed me to use her kitchen, which I did.  Our room was actually beside the kitchen but everyone respected the quiet time in the evening and the common area was empty by 10pm.

I would highly recommend Flor's house to any traveler, from singles to families.  Flor is extremely accommodating and easygoing, yet she upholds her house rules firmly.  I will definitely stay at Flor's house again when I travel to Seattle.  "
566435,42295565,2015-08-12,37877429,Xiangyang,"This is my first airbnb experience and it is very good. Flor is a great person, kind  and helpful. I am quite impressed with the variety of fruits, drinks and food in the fridge for breakfast. The free parking by the roadside is also a great convenience. The room is clean and neat. I especially like the artistic and stylish decoration. The only problem might be that the room is a bit small and needs better ventilation. But as a whole it was a wonderful experience and I would recommend to anyone who is coming for a short stay in Seattle."
566435,42771245,2015-08-15,40636580,Brenda,"It is a nice and convenient place to stay, very comfortable, clean, secure and quiet. Just like the name"" 5 star"", everything you need is there. The host Flor is very  accommodating and very helpful  ! She even prepared an authentic delicious Peruvian dinner for us. Highly recommend this place to other travelers . "
566435,44022820,2015-08-23,37625028,Jace,"My travel buddy and I have both recently stayed at a handful of different AirBnB's in a mix of cities. We think Mrs.  Flor's was the absolute best one so far by a long shot. The beds are incredibly comfortable and every room is stocked with everything you could possibly need [cable television, fridge, cooking items, snacks, toiletries, fresh towels, bath robes, and much more]. Furthermore the rooms have a lot of character in comparison to previous boring AirBnBs. You can tell Mrs. Flor put a lot of love and care into her house.

There is as little or as much privacy as you want. Everything is in your room afterall, but if you want to be social then everyone is incredibly nice. The bathrooms are shared, but me and my travel buddy has always found it available when we needed. Mrs. Flor made us feel very welcome and was very pleasant to talk to.

Would absolutely stay here again,
Thank you Mrs. Flor!

-Jace and Liz"
566435,45422355,2015-09-02,33084695,Carina,"Flor is an excellent host and the house is clean and comes with everything you need during the stay. Flor has thought of everything and the room is fully equipped. Flor is very generous, she stocks up the fridge with snacks and has also invited me to eat peruan food with her. 
The house is well connected to public transport and I found it very easy to get around. 
Overall I had a very enjoyable stay. "
566435,46020283,2015-09-07,41776147,Emily,"The ""5-Star House"" was our first airbnb experience and it couldn't have been better! Flor and her family made our stay easy and so enjoyable. Her home was comfortable, clean and full of character! Our room was fully stocked with anything we could want, and we had a great, quiet sleep. Flor's home is super close to the bus lines, which took us right downtown without any trouble! We were picked up from the ferry terminal by Flor's son Joseph, who was welcoming and helpful, adding to our great experience in Seattle! We took several of the suggestions made my Flor and Joseph and we were glad we did! Plus - there isn't a better breakfast in Seattle than in the ""5-Star House!"" Thank you to the Cruz family for having us stay, and making our first airbnb experience a tough one to beat! "
1541705,6999744,2013-09-02,8186715,Noah,"This place might be ideal for guys who doesn't care cleanness of the house and who are JUST looking for a place to sleep in the night. For me it was okay as I was out most of the day and came back late to sleep and also 24 hour Macdonald is 10-15 mins walk distance.

Basic facilities to live like a human are working fine. You could cook in the kitchen as they had many kitchen utensils. But to ladies it might not be ideal as you will be sharing the house with other 3 + guests mostly, if not all, guys in the house and some of them stayed there for more than a month. Also as I could not lock bathroom door, I had to put chairs behind the door when I had showers. Bathroom basin was a bit weird. It seems it was not completely blocked. But didn't go down until some level and that level was quite high so it looked like blocked...but I don't know maybe it was block. Anyway I used a kitchen basin to brush my teeth.

The room itself is better than other common places in the house. You will have a separate outdoor entrance door. So you will have two keys so you could lock both entrance door and door to the inside of the house. It is really spacious. 2 people can stay without any problem. Internet speed was okay. I was able to stream videos without difficulties. "

1541705,9724672,2014-01-06,5290426,Ryan,"Melissa was a very accommodating host.  She went above and beyond what a typical airbnb host would do.  The location was a little out of the way for me, but the room was good and very quiet considering other members of the house. "
1541705,9969719,2014-01-21,11379143,Eric,"Melissa met all of my expectations. The room was quiet and comfortable. It was close to shopping, bus stops. No complaints."
1541705,11147057,2014-03-23,716807,Barbara,"Melissa Yao is not a host, in my experience.  She wrote a couple of days before my trip to ask what time I would arrive.  I wrote back a detailed message with arrival date which ended with the statement  ""According to the trip planner I should be at the airBnb by about 9:30 pm. Will that be OK?""   Her response was ""Good to know"".  I arrived in the rain at the time I predicted, knocked on the locked front door, found no host, called Melissa and received no answer.  Finally I went to the back of the house, found an unlocked door, and wandered around knocking on closed doors till I found a resident who was willing to help me.  He also was unable to text or call Melissa but took me around the house to find an empty room ( the one I was knocking on before) and suggested that it seemed available.  Two hours later (around midnight) Melissa responded with a text message ""is this Sid?""  after I was settled in, no thanks to her.

A simple message ""Come to the back, your room is number 3, and the keys are in a specified place.  We'll get together later during your stay""  would have saved me a lot of anxiety.  "" Good to know"" is not the response of a host.

The stay was otherwise uneventful.  An electrician and a plumber was called to the house to fix problems during my stay.  The room is as described, the other tenants are somewhat quiet.

1541705,11379870,2014-03-31,7468,Breck,I had a fun time staying at Melissa's and meeting the other guests. Thanks!
1541705,16195326,2014-07-23,11596590,Corentin,"The room is very confortable and quiet. The house itself is well equiped (Kitchen, laundry, etc.) and rather clean. It is near everything (two grocery stores, U village, UW). 
I strongly recommend this room. Melissa is very kindly and open. Check in and out were easy."
1541705,17221120,2014-08-09,3096383,Dustin,"Melissa was an awesome host! She helped with everything I needed, including finding an iron and an ironing board. One day she even brought apples from her tree at home!

The room is as described, clean with a bed and private entry. Facilities are clean and kitchen is equipped with most basic utensils. Checking in was a breeze (Recommend following check-in procedure to the letter). Neighborhood is quiet, and centrally located.

The room is not well isolated from the sounds in the rest of the house. The roommates are not necessarily quiet (loud TV, creaky floors). They are NOT partiers, and don't play loud music or otherwise cause a ruckus. These noises can typically fade into the background, or be ignored with earplugs/headphones. 

Would highly recommend this listing. I had a fantastic stay!"
1541705,18899474,2014-09-02,1688887,Sarah,The room was good for the price. Convenient location. House was a little noisy during the night on the weekend but overall very quiet. 
1541705,21203089,2014-10-13,8364019,Jen,"Pros: Private entry/porch. This is especially nice if you receive a lot of packages in the mail like I do. Nice hardwood floors, large room. Plenty of storage. Free washer and dryer and the dryer is a VERY nice one! 

Cons: Where do I start? I guess my biggest issue was that it says on AirBNB "" We have cleaning people to clean the kitchen and bathroom biweekly. We always keep it clean."" I thought this meant it would be cleaned twice a week, but when I asked Melissa she said that meant every two weeks. A house full of men only being cleaned every two weeks - I don't need to spell it out. After a few days the bathroom would get VERY DIRTY to the point I just started using the one downstairs which tended to be slightly cleaner. Cannot stress enough how gross the bathroom was - urine and hair all over the toilet. So you can either clean up after other grown ass men who should know better, or deal with the nastiness. 

The kitchen never seemed to be cleaned either - the trash was taken out yes but that seemed to be the extent of it. Again I had to go and clean up after the other tenants who would leave their dishes piled in the dish rack and never put them back in their place. There seemed to be a layer of grime covering everything in the kitchen. Definitely didn't use any forks or bowls unless I washed them first. Moths and spiders in the cabinets. 

People left the lights on at night which is not only wasteful but it attracted moths and all kinds of bugs and I was always bombarded by them in the mornings when I was making my breakfast and lunch. The tenant beside me would play the tv/computer super loud at night so I got hardly any sleep during my stay. I could hear every word even with ear plugs in. After putting up with it a couple nights I asked him to turn it down and he didn't - I had to contact the owner and get her to ask him and finally he did, but only for a few days and it started again. 

Room #3 has one large wall that doesn't go all the way up to the ceiling. There is some foam padding stuffed up there but I still feel like it was not very private. It didn't provide a very good noise barrier and there were cracks where bugs would get through from the kitchen. 

Also I'm pretty sure my bed sheets had not been washed before I arrived. The floor was also dirty and had not been vacuumed before my arrival. "
1541705,25645220,2015-01-21,10281202,Elaine,I love the room that feels like home with the porch outside.  Melissa came over to help me get settled.  The location is so convenient! I will definitely return again!
1541705,28270574,2015-03-21,28476900,瑭,great place！nice landlord！thank u
1541705,28894298,2015-03-31,28944056,Terri,"This house was off the main arterials, so very little car traffic, yet it was an easy walk to the University of Washington campus.  The other students who live there were very nice and helpful.  I plan on using this venue again soon."
1541705,31113577,2015-05-02,2487840,T.J.,"This is a beautiful room in a nice house. The room was much bigger than it looked, very comfortable for me and my stuff. The housemates were very respectful and the house was quiet most of the time. I will say that there was some construction/maintenance going on both next  door and in the house. While not totally under the host's control, this did make for some loud mornings.

There is something of a dearth of space in the kitchen, but it was never super problematic.

Melissa was very easy to communicate with, responded very quickly and was very respectful and pleasant. We didn't run into each other very often but I never had any issues that went unresolved. I had a problem with an electrical outlet in my room and it was fixed the next day! Thanks!"
1935439,14557300,2014-06-22,13970389,Xixi,"Tim is the person who has a very healthy life! He grows a lot of strawberries, rasberries in the garden that I can enjoy. He drives, also ride bikes to work. He helped me find the bus routes, found the best dye for me, showed me his healthy food. We always have a good talk. As for the house, I can find everything I need in the kitchen. My room in the first floor has a private bathroom, which is so convenient. Wifi is everywhere. QFC is just in 2 min walk! I really enjoy staying here!"
1935439,44599602,2015-08-27,2157207,Leena,"Tim was a really nice guy and mostly kept to himself, which is great as I am a pretty private person. The pros to this place is that you get a LARGE, clean bedroom and your own very very clean bathroom for a very affordable price!

The cons are that there is an intense cloying odor, that your nose will never adjust to...I can't imagine what it is, but it might be from multiple fruit trays being dehydrated in the property (many are left out of the dehydrator for days, as well, as the condo is next to Tim's impressive side garden, where he harvests grapes and greens), and there is also a cat on the property, which is very sick at the moment. The smell at the front door/ground floor is intense, probably from the cat, and different from the smell on the 2nd floor, which is sweet/cloying and also intense. The smell does pervade where you will be staying as well (top floor). The cat currently is vomiting, and there was a small pile of vomit that was left to dry next to the sliding glass door for several days. I had a hard time eating in the dining room table as it was nearby.

The other thing is that the rest of the property isn't very clean, and there isn't really a ""shared"" space...meaning, no living room, no TV, and not even space to eat at the dining table (as the table is full of stuff). 

Finally, Tim does not keep up with text messages and phone calls in a timely manner. For two days and nights in a row, I had to scramble to sleep elsewhere as the fire alarm battery went low and beeped for 48 hours straight. I texted AND called Tim several times, leaving messages. He is not at home at night, due to a night job. I had to wake up friends I had nearby at 2 am so I could crash with them, and the next day I called the AirBnB emergency line and they routed me to a $250/night hotel. For my pains, I was reimbursed $200 by AirBnB and Tim gave me an extra day's stay...but this was a spectacularly stressful experience, in my opinion. 

Also be advised that there is NO INTERNET, and the futon is in need of a featherbed or some medium-soft support. 

In all, I DO recommend this place, but with the caveat that you need to get all your needs met in real time with Tim, as he does not keep up on his phone in a timely fashion. Because of no Internet (in all fairness I did not check the amenities section of his page, which had ""Internet"" crossed out), I had to go to cafes everyday. This was good in a way, because it got me out into the neighborhood; however, I spent a lot of money that I could have saved if he had wifi at home."
1935439,49458983,2015-10-04,35261803,Helen,"Tim is a great person, he seems to be really calm and with great vibe, the room was as shown in the pictures, great size!
His house has a great vibe, lots of details, it is a cozy and comfortable home...
We had a lot of privacy in this room.
"
2016613,9525200,2014-01-01,9593423,Vince,We really enjoyed our time in Seattle.  The house is nice and comfortable so we could totally relax and feel like home in there.  Rick is very thoughtful for our family.  He prepared everything we need before our arrival.  He also provided any information that we might be interested.  The house is close to the city and convenient to food stores and supermarket.  
2016613,9564465,2014-01-02,7075970,Tina,"Rick was an awesome host, very responsive and accommodating. The house was even better than the pictures show! Extremely spacious with great views of the surrounding areas! I rented this home for a New Years Eve get together with friends it was it perfect space for entertaining and we had plenty of room for all the guests. "
2016613,11636136,2014-04-10,7089671,Mike,Rick's house is great and communicating with him was easy.  The home is clean and well-appointed.  The kitchen is top-notch.  The house located about 4 miles from downtown.  We will contact Rick again for other trips to Seattle.
2016613,11806756,2014-04-15,6738979,Henry,5 stars!  Rick was such a great host!  My family of 6 stayed for 5 nights and couldn't have asked for anything nicer.  Very nicely decorated and the hot tub was so relaxing after a day of trekking around downtown Seattle (less than 5 mi / 15min drive away); very Zen!  The area has a very rustic feel and surrounded by foliage while still conveniently located in the hip/gentrified Columbia City district of Seattle with shopping and dining only minutes away.  The kitchen was just amazing and fully appointed with all the tools a gourmet chef would need.  I would not hesitate to stay at Rick's home again when in Seattle.
2016613,15300323,2014-07-07,11127178,Louis,Beautiful home and furnishings. The owner obviously took care into making it a luxury vacation feel. The unique rugs & flooring along with the many balconies gave us a beachfront feel.   Louis
2016613,15666761,2014-07-14,11907270,Randall,"This was our first Airbnb experience.   We could not be happier.   The accommodations were even better than promoted.   The host was fantastic.  Communications were timely, house preparations were unbeatable, and overall provided a feeling of being at home.   For all future travels to Seattle, we will pursue this rental and airbnb, before looking into hotels.  "
2016613,16733377,2014-08-01,17834789,Joseph,"House was perfect for our needs and exceeded our expectations. We had a group from Portland going to a concert in Seattle at safeco field and didn't want to drive back late. Ended up getting a limo, but it's not to far away. Also, I would highly recommend Amy's limo service. She accommodated our last minute needs when another company tried to pull a fast one.

The house was clean. Rick left the keys in a lock box so we were able to arrive at different times without issue. Parking was a little tricky, just b/c I drove my big work truck. In the end it worked out. I would recommend it to anyone, family or groups looking to be in Seattle without being downtown. He also gave recommendations for some local restaurants."
2016613,16889818,2014-08-04,14513243,Laura,"Rick was gracious, responsive, and very easy to work with.  The home is beautiful -- all the essentials, lovely landscaping and views, and lots of space for our large group of adults to spread out! 

(Note - It is a 3-story home in a very hilly neighborhood, so I would only recommend this home to those with good mobility.) "
2016613,41404175,2015-08-07,18279457,Amir,"We stayed in this house for four nights and we really felt comfortable and like home. The owner had really put a lot of attention to details and everything was as described in the listing.
The house is over three levels and allowed our group to have enough to space to rest, read, barbecue, play, and sleep. 
I had forgotten couple of items when we left the house and Rick kindly sent them back to us. 
Thank you very much for a nice prepared and welcoming house. Our trip to Seattle was a good experience and the house was an important part of it."
2016613,43073659,2015-08-17,25519145,Steven,"We had a great experience dealing with the owner, Rick. The house work great for my family. Definitely recommended."
2016613,43978644,2015-08-23,107870,Scarlett & Billy,"Staying at Rick's house in Seattle was incredible. It has ample space for a lot of people and the house is set up in a really cool way, with lots of balconies, living rooms, patios, and common space. The house is also beautiful and has everything that you'd want. Check-in and check-out was super easy and Rick was responsive to any questions we had, including allowing us to check-out super late. 

It looks like it would be pretty easy to get to a train line, and there was a grocery store and a few restaurants within easy walking distance. 

Fantastic place and great value for a large group. We would really recommend this house. "
2016613,47048917,2015-09-15,38466586,Sam,Rick was very nice and welcoming.  The house was wonderful and a quick shot to downtown Seattle.  Would recommend to a friend.  Everything posted is accurate. 
2016613,49895772,2015-10-07,22100860,Ryan,"Rick is a very good host.  He was responsive, with a very detailed check-in packet, and was very flexible on our arrival and departure times.  He even had some breakfast treats waiting for us at check-in.

The house location was very nice.  Without traffic, you're within 15 minutes of downtown, and you're also within a short drive of many other parts of the city (as well as 2 hours from Mt. Rainier NP, with an easy exit from the city during AM rush).  Beautiful sunrise view from the kitchen and dining/living room, looking out to the mountains over the eastern part of the city .

The kitchen was very well appointed, and there is ample seating for meals (and there are both good grocery and carry-out options nearby).  We had a very easy time preparing dinners at the house.  The house has lots of room, and is certainly well-sized for a larger group.  If you plan to use more than two bedrooms, though, it should be noted that the other two bedrooms and three beds are futon-cushion fold-downs, rather than traditional mattress/box-spring beds.

Agree with another reviewer that good mobility for guests is a must.  Zero issue for us, but the house and the walk from the street parking to the front door include a number of steps."
2016613,51473348,2015-10-20,2111113,Heath,"My girlfriend and I had an amazing stay here with my kids. The home is beautifully decorated and very well-maintained. Rick is a great host; he met us at the property and gave us a thorough tour of the home.  There is plenty of room, very comfortable beds and a fun hot tub!  "
2016613,55008592,2015-11-27,2816894,Katie,"We arrived later than anticipated so we did not get to meet Rick. But our exchanges with him were all friendly and helpful. The home is a very nice home. It sleeps 6 comfortably, with the other 2 on futons in the basement, which tended to be chilly at the end of Nov. There is some minor TLC needed to the hot tub area but overall the property is beautiful The neighborhood is no the nicest but dining, shopping and entertainment were very close (walking distance). That said, this house provided a great venue for a wonderful Thanksgiving with friends. "
2016613,55428617,2015-12-01,18893029,N,"Great house!  Good walk to nice restaurants and easy walk to Light Rail - which made life really easy as we were there for a Seahawks game!
Loved the number of bathrooms, easy parking out back, good system for security and kitchen well stocked!!"
2489339,12790782,2014-05-11,12798676,Chris,Fantastic experience. Perfect location. Very clean. Very friendly owner. Could not ask for more!
2489339,13276538,2014-05-24,13299743,Claire,"Really lovely apartment in a very nice and secure block.  Great location, walking distance to the Space Needle and Pike Place Market.  Pool and fitness centre are great, although it was a shame the sauna wasn't working during our stay.  Very smooth check in and some nice goodies left by the Seattle Oasis people.  I didn't want to leave!"
2489339,16244506,2014-07-24,14014540,Pedro,"Beautiful and very well equipped apartment very close to everything! The staff were extremely helpful and attentive at all times. If I'm ever back in Seattle, I'll definitely stay with them again!"
2489339,17168826,2014-08-08,4622694,Rajive,"The rental company running this establishment is professional. A few too many emails before, during and after. I acknowledged this and they are working on this.
The suite was perfect in location, better to saty in quiet and trendy Belltown then in bustling, overcrowded downtown locations.
Everything was included from welcome basket (water, coffee, etc), to towels, and full kitchen. We have rented many places but were overwhelmed with this location.
Gym was fantastic with an outdoor courtyard to stretch etc.
Walking distance to all the key places - space needle, pike place, java stops, and restaurants (especially Macrine bakery next door).
Would recommend this to any travelor."
2489339,18633793,2014-08-29,8114906,Benoît,Great Seattle location. The host was very nice and the apartment more than what I was hoping for.
2489339,24891141,2015-01-03,25005936,Leslie,"This was a very nice condo, well equipped and lots of nice amenities like a gym and pool. Even shampoo and a hairdryer! We would stay here again."
2489339,38660216,2015-07-17,6371498,Arielle,Decent and clean place but the check in process is really difficult to have to meet someone at a specific time to do a key hand off would prefer a less involved system. Also a lot of online forms etc made it extra clunky. Good location and accommodation.
2489339,43179082,2015-08-17,5740327,Darryl & Vida,"We had a wonderful four nights exploring Seattle and this is an excellent location that is close to many great restaurants and attractions.  The accommodations were very comfortable for two people and acceptable but a little tight for four (using sofa bed in living room).  It is a small apartment but has all the basics necessary for an enjoyable stay.  We did not cook because there were so many great restaurants but the kitchen would have worked well had we decided to eat in.  The people were easy to coordinate with and very polite although the process is a little more involved that necessary as it is necessary to download documents and coordinate exact time to meet, etc.  We prefer a simple checkin with a single click confirmation on airbnb and a key lockbox for self entry.  Not a big deal, but something to be aware of.  The apartment appears to be well used as the carpets were in need of replacement (or at least a deep clean for the many stains), shower drained poorly, and other small repairs needed.  These things didn't detract at all from our experience as we chose this primarily for the excellent location.  We would stay again, but would choose an exterior, west-facing unit to view the water.  The photo showing the rooftop water view is not easily accessible from this unit as it is on the opposite side of the complex which did not appear to be internally connected."
2489339,46001085,2015-09-07,6203666,Amber,"Perfect location in Seattle! Walking distance to Pikes Place, Space Needle, Olympic  Sculpture Garden, Pioneer Square and much more! Getting checked in was a little rocky (the host isn't actually the person giving you the keys, they have a staff member do that. The staff member was at a different entrance than the one we were told to go to, so we were playing Marco Polo for a bit). Apartment is clean, more than enough room for 4 people, free parking, cute balcony, pool etc. I also love that they left us free snacks to eat! Only complaint is that they asked us to take out the trash and wash the linens before checkout (even though we paid a $96 cleaning fee when booking the room). Thanks for hosting us Darik!"
5787922,33161182,2015-05-25,20191717,Jessica,Deb Greeted us when we arrived.  The room/bathroom were lovely!  Deb was great and so very helpful.  The neighborhood is so great!  We walked to a restaurant and wine bar and enjoyed every minute!  Thanks Deb!
5787922,33836128,2015-06-01,6492730,Hope,"Deborah was a warm, welcoming, and thoughtful hostess. She emailed prior to our arrival to find out our interests, likes and dislikes to ensure everything was perfect.  Upon arrival, she gave us a listing of events in the area we could enjoy. Finally, we were impressed at the level of care in every detail of the room. Her mindful touch--from the calming art to the quality towels, toiletries, breakfast items,  snacks, and Keurig drinks--made this weekend a wonderful getaway.   

This place really was a secret garden. Deb set up an adorable patio with comfortable furniture and accents lights that beg you to sit for a while, read, chit chat or enjoy the spring time air. 

The location is perfect, truly in the heart of Fremont. We could easily walk down to restaurants and bars as our leisure. There is an amazing Philly sandwich shop about a block away!"
5787922,34608312,2015-06-09,8270167,Katie,"Deborah was very timely in her responses and very helpful in her answers to our questions. She made us feel very welcome and was very accommodating to our needs. She gave us great suggestions about local places to eat and insider tips for things to see and do. She has created a  beautiful guest suite, the decor is stylish and inviting. She has put a lot of effort into making it a comfortable space, with numerous thoughtful touches. I was impressed at the simple but yummy snacks and breakfast food items she provided. The outdoor patio is a great setting to relax and enjoy an evening cocktail, or your morning coffee. The space is clean and safe, a great place to experience real life in a vibrant and colorful Seattle neighborhood. This has been one of the best airbnb experiences I've had so far! I'd stay there again for sure! "
5787922,35109375,2015-06-15,32200542,Kellen,"Deborah was a great host. She provided a great list of restaurants and activities going on in the area. Her basement room was exactly as pictured - cute and spotless with all the amenities you need (shampoo, soap, hair dryer, water, etc.) for a stay. The room is within walking distance to all the sights of Fremont (including the Fremont troll). Thanks for a nice stay!"
5787922,35939890,2015-06-23,31036231,Heather,"This space was in a great location, and Deb was a wonderful host. She surprised us with a few bottles of local beer in the mini-fridge, because she knew that my husband was a home brewer! We greatly enjoyed meeting her. We hit up most of her restaurant recommendations and were not disappointed. 

We only spent a long weekend in Seattle, so we spent most of time out and about. We appreciated the super soft bed when we finally turned in. Deb made herself available without being intrusive.  We would stay there again in a heartbeat."
5787922,36221527,2015-06-26,29883633,Maree,"Deb was a warm and welcoming host. Our space was cozy and cute. We easily took the bus to downtown sites, and enjoyed the Fremont neighborhood. We had a great Seattle experience."
5787922,37200348,2015-07-05,24453818,Brandon,"Deb was an amazing and welcoming host. Her room was very neat and tidy, exactly as it looks in her photos. Deb was very organized and easy to contact, which made coordinating a breeze! 

Her home is also next to a bunch of interesting restaurants and shops in Fremont so there is plenty to do near by. We would absolutely stay with Deb again next time we're in Seattle! "
5787922,37325666,2015-07-06,33787194,Bob,"We really enjoyed our stay for many reasons:
Simple and super clean,
Charming neighborhood close to fun spots to explore
Deb is so hospitable. She gave us a ride to an event we were attending!
Loved the small details:
Snacks mints lotion coffee water.
The listing was very accurate. 
"
5787922,38404162,2015-07-15,35130256,Jeremy,"Fantastic rental and host!  Clean, bright and comfortable, exactly as described in the posting. Such an amazing retreat after long days of sight-seeing and hiking.  Deb went above and beyond for us, inquiring throughout our stay about our needs and leaving us extra food and beverages in the room.  She even offered us a ride to our friends wedding!  The location and neighborhood are perfect if you prefer to walk to restaurants, boutiques and coffee shops, or take the bus to the sights downtown - no rental car needed in my opinion. I REALLY didn't want to leave."
5787922,38741318,2015-07-18,36140987,Christina,"Our family loved staying at Deb's lovely rental. It was nice and bright, clean, relaxing, keyless entry and the beds were fantastic (especially after getting your walk on everywhere)!! The water pressure and shower gel and shampoo were a nice touch. Deb was AMAZING!! She always responded quickly to any questions we had and left us wonderful GF/DF goodies (so thankful for this). We appreciated the helpful advice on restaurants to try, coffee shops to visit and shops to check out at Pikes Mkt. Not to mention that with a toddler, a teen, and picky hubby I was concerned about finding good food everyone would like within walking distance, no problem there. The neighborhood has a lil bit for all, including some pretty awesome playgrounds :) 
We will definitely come back next time we are in Seattle."
5787922,39639112,2015-07-25,1637656,Grace,"We loved Deb's guest apartment. It was like staying in a nice, quiet, tasteful hotel room, but with its own private entrance, secluded garden/deck area, and free parking. The Fremont neighborhood was terrific-- we ate and drank in various places and had a great time. Deb was helpful to the max, full of suggestions and tips, and very flexible with our check-in which was a big help. Wouldn't hesitate to stay again. "
5787922,39934000,2015-07-27,33079203,Ryan,"Great place, amazing host, beautiful city and area. Definitely a place to stay if your looking for more in a place than just a bed. I will stay again."

Felt welcome "
5787922,40334719,2015-07-30,35436119,Pat,"Deb was very welcoming, steered us to great local restaurants all walkable from the bnb and the place was very comfy and absolutely spotless! The Fremont neighborhood is a very sweet place to stay with interesting shops, parks and good hilly walks. The street was fairly busy especially during rush hour, but the room was in back and fairly quiet."

전용주차공간이 있고, 침실 그리고 욕실구조입니다.
호텔과 유사한 구조이고, 호스트가 나름 신경써서 전반적으로 괜찬은데, 호텔과 유사한 구조라는것이 장점이자 단점일 수 있을것 같습니다.
약간 반지하 느낌도 있고, 호스트는 밝고 햇빛이 많이 든다고 강조하지만, 조금 어두컴컴한 느낌 있습니다.
호텔처럼 침대2개까 방을 꽉채우고 있어서 여유공간 별로 없고, 그리고 욕실이 전부라서 이점 참고하시고,
그외 관리수준과 호스트의 친절함은 훌륭합니다.
참, 그리고 부엌은 없습니다. 전자렌지는 있습니다.

The extras were appreciated such as some local beer and fresh fruit. If we are able to travel to this area again, we would certainly book this property again. "

5787922,42411283,2015-08-13,32934732,Carol,"Everything was just terrific. Location, parking, facilities, host! Deb was wonderful. This was our first Airbnb so we couldn't believe the lovely accommodations--with so much thoughtfulness. The porch was our favorite--chatting with friends, having a glass of wine in the evening/coffee in the morning. Loved this place!! and host! "
5787922,42695949,2015-08-15,36491061,Tasha,"Deb was a great host! she was there to great us (even though we arrived later that originally planned).  The little details, Coffee maker, milk, dried fruit in little jars for the instant oat meal for our kids and the advice about restaurants it was all greatly appreciated. 

The private patio area was quiet and lovely in the evening just to sit and enough the cool air and a coffee (it was hot during the day! ) 

Location was PERFECT, so close to great restaurants and a short drive to the zoo and the space needle. 
"
5787922,43058147,2015-08-17,35984726,Becky,"Great experience! 
This secret garden has a great parking spot which is important in Fremont. Deb stocked the mini ""kitchen"" area with the best little items - corn flakes and milk were much appreciated at 2:00 when we arrived :) 
Everything was attractive and well thought out and clean and the whole experience was really simple. 
Thank you!"

With ginger chews and local beer,  I felt right at home. I loved staying in home in the Fremont neighborhood. Thank you Deb for giving us a wonderful place to stay."
5787922,44738032,2015-08-28,41825821,Nick,Hotel like accommodations. Exactly like what what's described. Great place to relax!
5787922,44778957,2015-08-29,11850729,Keely,"Deb's home was a perfect oasis in the heart of Fremont. It was so clean and well-designed. It was the perfect place to stay for our evening in Seattle. She was a great host too giving us lots of privacy but making herself available for any help. We had to text her about some pods for the Keurig and it took 5min for her to bring down an adorable tray with water, a flower, and the pods. It was a really great stay. "
5787922,44959622,2015-08-30,18192996,Jessica,"Deb's place is absolutely wonderful. She was the most gracious host, providing a fairly stocked fridge and a basket of breakfast treats. I was traveling alone, and I felt very welcome and safe.

I would book this room again the next time I'm in Seattle!"

It was really the perfect place for us! We felt like we were staying in a nice hotel (there were even plush robes in the bathroom!), except better because Deb is such a great host. I had so many questions for her, and she graciously answered them all and in a timely matter. We had a chance to meet, and she was so warm and friendly! She is also full of great recommendations for restaurants in the area. I hope to get a chance to stay at her place again!"
5787922,45355456,2015-09-01,20181438,Christine,We had a great stay in Deb's place in the Fremont neighborhood! Cozy apartment within walking distance to lots of restaurants and breweries. The place is clean and tidy with thoughtful touches throughout- not to mention the lovely garden patio!
5787922,45385338,2015-09-02,5125601,Des And David,"Deb was a gracious and communicative host. We felt very comfortable prior to our arrival with the help of her instructions and prompt responses! The room is as pictured and then some. Perfect in its own way with everything you may need. Truly a hidden gem you can't pass up while visiting Seattle. We stayed for just a night but wish we had more time to enjoy the local area. Though, Deb's hospitality and space was enough to have us back. Fremont is a nice neighborhood with interesting attractions and little shops. It's a quick drive around and short walk. There is a nice walking path we planned to go to but it was raining. I'm sure it's worth doing while holding a cup of joe in the morning. The listing also has parking space, yay! If you like well designed, stylish, and private, this is the place to book! "
5787922,45515611,2015-09-03,9123035,Perry,"It was a lovely room - comfortable beds and a good suite of basic appliances - refrigerator, microwave, TV, coffee maker. Definitely better equipped than most actual hotels I've stayed at.

Location was great, coming and going was easy, and the area was quiet at night. Couldn't ask for anything more."

She continuously checked up on us to see if there was anything we needed and was super generous in providing us with what we needed. The room was super cute and cozy and had everything necessary. Would come back and recommend :) 
5787922,46812173,2015-09-13,551525,Isar,"Deb was an amazing host and the space was beautiful, comfortable, and in a wonderful location. There was tea, coffee, and snacks available! Thank you so much for a lovely stay!"
5787922,46944186,2015-09-14,6334121,Steven,"Fantastic stay at Deb's Secret Garden! There were 3 of us in town for a wedding and Deb made every effort to accommodate us. The Fremont area is a great place to stay - lots of cool shops, restaurants and bars. I highly recommend staying here - something different for those who have stayed in Seattle before and have done the whole downtown thing.

Thank you Deb!"
5787922,47294348,2015-09-17,42957653,Colleen,"This was my husband and mine's first trip to Seattle and our first Airbnb. It was truly a fantastic experience, both Seattle and Deb's ""Secret Garden"". We used public transportation to get downtown and there were many bus stops located a short distance away. It was fun for us to walk around the neighborhood and enjoy the weather. There were also many delicious restaurants and cafes in close proximity to our stay. 
The room itself was perfect. It was very nice having the little patio area to ourselves to both start and end the day by relaxing out there. Deb went above and beyond with all the little extras she provided! The snacks she provided were delicious and her binder full of local restaurant and attraction info was useful. Deb herself was very helpful with suggestions and very accessible. 
Overall this was a wonderful visit, both my husband and I were saddened that we couldn't stay longer! We will definitely stay here on our next visit! We absolutely recommend staying at Deb's. She is a wonderful host and made our stay special!"
5787922,47699911,2015-09-21,33059826,Jaclyn,"Beautiful room. Fine space for 2 couples for the night, with lovely outdoor patio space, and private parking! Great neighborhood, walking distance from real good restaurants and bars. + Deb provided OJ and breakfast too. 20mins from airport! Highly recommend."
5787922,47870063,2015-09-21,39859854,Tristen,"Deb was a great communicator and an excellent host. There were treats and other lovely luxuries... like bathrobes. All the attention to detail made us feel like we were staying in a fancy hotel. We didn't get to meet her during our one-night stay, but we would definitely stay again and for longer!"
5787922,47945689,2015-09-21,42640664,Deborah,"The neighborhood was very quite, and there were many awesome restaurants nearby! Great location, super close to downtown. Deb provided us with tons of goodies to eat and drink! I was starving when I got there so when I saw the food in the fridge, I was so happy! The bed was super comfortable and the washroom was super clean! Will definitely stay again. "
5787922,48883883,2015-09-29,39826235,Tom,"Deb was a terrific host. Secret Garden is a great accommodation, it is even better than the pictures show. Deb provided snacks, fruit coffee, tea and a few local beers were in the fridge when we arrived it was terrific!  The private patio is great for morning coffee and off street parking is a plus. The location in Freemont is great only a block from the main drag which has great shops, restaurants and the bus to go to downtown Seattle.
We had a great stay and will be back next summer. 5 stars !!"
5787922,49491951,2015-10-04,43801393,Kristine,"This was our first Airbnb experience and we loved it! Deb was a wonderful hostess and the unit was everything we hoped for and more. The location was super convenient to walk and drive to all the places we wanted to explore and reconnect with in Seattle. The amenities were very thoughtful and made us feel pampered on our vacation. Loved the off-street parking, privacy of the patio, and quiet home base to rest in between activities (especially for me as I get used to life with a brand new hip!). Also appreciated the recommendations for local resources - we found some great new restaurants! Hard to leave, and we hope to come back!"
5787922,49822937,2015-10-06,33401954,Amanda,"Great place, great location, great host!  The place was amazing and charming, decorated adorably and the patio was an amazing place to enjoy a beverage. Location was in walking distance to great restaurants and shopping. Deb was amazing host, offering great dining advice and filling the place with special touches from beverages to robes to make it feel welcoming and comfortable!"

The beds were comfy and the lovely breakfast items that Deb provided for us were a thoughtful touch. We chose one of the restaurants on Deb's recommended neighborhood joints and it did not disappoint. Thanks Deb for another great airbnb experience, we'll be back!"
5787922,50509186,2015-10-12,1227867,Noel,"Exactly as pictured.  The place is clean and well kept.  It sort of made me think that they watch a lot of HGTV and got some remodeling ideas (not that there is anything wrong with that).  Seattle is expensive hotel-wise, so the price is right (plus are there any hotels in Fremont?).    Literally 1 block from all the bars and restaurants.

I guess the downside is that you're staying in somebody's basement.  I sort of felt like the teenage kid with mom upstairs making dinner and running the vacuum.  Not much for furniture.  I think it's great for one or two people, one night.  Not sure I'd do more than that, but I'm a picky guy when it comes to airbnb"
5787922,50897774,2015-10-15,46224156,Jinshan,"房子的位置开车很方便，而且开放的庭院还可以停车，房东很好，他们开放了一层对外出租，房东住在上2层，这样让我们觉得很安全，房间内给准备了一些早点、水果、水总体上来看很干净很温馨，离开当日还短信告知后面没有等着入住的房客，我们可以随意时间退房，异国漂泊我们觉得无比的暖心，离开前她下楼慰问了我们。
总之很不错，这是我第一次体验Airbnb。"
5787922,51716101,2015-10-24,4427274,Karen,We only had a very short stay in Seattle but we wished we had longer! The Secret Garden apartment was absolutely adorable and Deb had put so much care into the little touches that made us feel so at home and welcome.  We'll definitely be back! 
5787922,52020510,2015-10-25,19589739,Jason,A wonderful stay in a great location. Deb really does a wonderful job of making the place comfortable and is the definition of a great AirBnB host! Thank you. 
5787922,52228569,2015-10-27,21110024,January,"Staying at Deb's was one of the best experiences I have had with AirBNB.  She was the kindest host.  Everything was setup perfect.  She was incredibly consider of the fact that we were traveling with a preschooler.  From the treats and snacks that were available to filling us in on playgrounds in the area.   The apartment was clean and beautiful.  The area is so much fun.  We walked down to the canal, hit up the Sunday Market and took a tour of Theo's Chocolate factory.  This was all in a couple block radius of the apartment.  I will definitely be back."
5787922,52754581,2015-11-01,50348,Cindi,"The room is well-appointed and the beds are WONDERFUL.  Deb checked in with us several times to make certain all was ok, which was very welcoming.  We loved the little secret patio even if the weather didn't allow us to use it much!  

Everything was thought out and there were little touches that made the Secret Garden a cozy, attractive and comfortable place for our stay in Seattle.  "

I would definitely recommend staying here!"
5787922,53502451,2015-11-09,6617533,Carolyn,"I had a great experience staying at Deb's!! 3 girlfriends and I were up in Seattle for one night. Everything was exactly as she described, and it was really easy to communicated with her. The  location was great--we had a car and it was easy to navigate, plus super nice to have parking right out front. Deb's place was adorable and the room (which has its own private entry) was exactly what we were looking for. She makes it feel like a hotel, with everything from room snacks to bathrobes! I never got to meet Deb, but that's because we were too in and out the whole time to coordinate. If I go back to Seattle, I'd stay here again in a heartbeat!"
5787922,53789086,2015-11-12,1527941,Mary,"Deb was so warm and kind and checking in and out was super easy! The location was perfect and the space felt like the coziest hotel I've ever stayed. I didn't spend a lot of time in the apartment, but I enjoyed the time that I did. It was clean, modern, and full of bells and whistles. Even though it didn't have a kitchen, they made the most of the space and all the essentials were there. I really appreciated the fruit in the morning too! It was so nice to have on my flight back home. Thanks Deb!"
5787922,54050252,2015-11-15,27791903,Tri,Great area. Great location. Great host. The amenities including the snacks and drinks provided are great. Keep it up!

Deb's place is very comfortable, clean and supplied with nice amenities for a light breakfast, snack, etc. Loved that it was walking distance to downtown Fremont's stores, restaurants and cafes.  Our son lives in the neighborhood so we found this to be a perfect location to spend time with him without driving all over Seattle.  We will definitely come back again as our stay was lovely!! Deb is a great hostess!"

The hospitality was above and beyond what we could've expected - from the couple beers in the fridge, to the chocolates by the bed, to the plethora of clean towels, everything was fantastic. The driveway parking was perfect and allowed us to not have to worry about our car, and the location of the apartment was close enough to Uber around the city with no problems. We would love to stay with Deb anytime we return to Seattle!"
1123977,7743058,2013-10-01,8072414,Aapo,"I and my wife stayed at Kristi's and Peter's basement for about three weeks, while looking for a permanent place to move in. Overall, the experience was pretty good: the location is superb for UW and there are lot of restaurants, shops around. With 50$ extra we got to park on the street which was very convenient. 

Home is clean and comfortable, bed was good and bathroom as well, kitchen was good enough for us. Internet connection is fast, which was important for us. 

Kristi was always very helpful and helped us to get settled.

I'd like to point out that this place is not for light sleepers. There are lot of student houses around and parties going on late in the night. Also, be prepared to wake up early in the morning as the house is full of kids running around :). For families with children, this would be an ideal place to stay. 
"
1123977,8117567,2013-10-16,5202448,Colleen,We had a wonderful stay!  Thank you so much for providing a comfortable and relaxing space for our family to feel at home while we were visiting Seattle.

Kristi and her family are wonderful hosts, immediately responsive to my every request. The airbnb pictures give a very good sense of the apartment, which was spotless when I arrived. I would certainly stay here again!"

Spotless and comfortable with a lovely garden outside the door. Very quiet neighborhood. Perfectly equipped kitchen.  Every spice you could wish for. 

It's like an oasis in the busy UW neighborhood."
1123977,16763079,2014-08-02,12981735,David,"We stayed at her place for 6 weeks this summer. We had a great time with her family.

1123977,45570830,2015-09-04,36244706,Stephanie,"Everything was as Kristi described it. The lockbox was easy to figure out, the place was immaculate, with lots of airy space to call my own during a grad school program at UW. Just a 15 minute walk to the main campus gate, I was thrilled that I opted to stay here and not in the dorms. Comfy bed, clean hot shower (with shampoo/conditioner and Agraria luxury soap), fluffy towels, an equipped kitchen and desk for working, and lots of privacy in a Seattle garden setting. Easy walk to UDistrict or UVillage. The WiFi was fast and never went out, the laundry right outside the interior locked basement door was handy, and the sounds of the family upstairs going about their daily lives was a comfort as I was missing my own for 2 weeks. Would love to stay here again, and Kristi + her family are sweethearts. Thanks for a great stay, Kristi!"

Wifi worked well . The soft early morning piono practise and steps made me feel a part of their house even if I was staying below.  Kristi , her husband and  kids are very friendly and hospitable.  I spend couple of evenings with them in their  backyard enjoying the beautiful flowers , bushes and tress.  10 min walk to my daughters dorm, 5 min walk to the bus stop and the grocery store was  very convenient.  My stay in Seattle was pleasurable thanks to her  (she answered all my queries promptly) . IT WAS A HOME AWAY FROM HOME.  "

The pictures do not do this place justice. There is also a rooftop with the most beautiful view of the city. We grilled there and had a few friends stop by in the apts. club house -- must see. Brad left a welcome list of places to visit in Seattle and also let us know where everything was around the house. The listing is decorated beautifully, properly stocked with cooking utensils and perfect for a stay in Seattle. Super friendly host, amazing views, cozy stay!"

The apartment was immaculate, everything you'd need was made available and Brad gave me a tour of the building as well as a short brief as to where the nearest stores were for all our needs.

Even with Kristen out of town, the process was so smooth.  Kristen's mother-in-law Shellie, hosted us and was phenomenal.  She was flexible with check-in & check-out times and even supplied various snacks $ beverages for us.  Shellie met me at the loft to give a tour, as well as directions to the rest of my group! :) She was quite informative and so very accommodating. Keith produced an event at a venue about a mile away,  so the convenience could not have been better for us.  

That evening I had lost my phone and had to call Kristen to get the code again for the keyless entry and even though it was late, she answered the phone immediately.  She was so friendly and understanding about the situation and sent me the code right away.  The loft itself was nice, comfortable, clean and is so well located with in the city.  We had an awesome stay and have already planned to go back, as we handle plenty of affairs in the area.  - K&C"

Close walk to old financial district with underground tours  and waterfront. Comfortable large air bed. Only pitfalls were the loud exhaust fan making sleep difficult and the loft gets hot in the evening. "
1080097,4583060,2013-05-13,6076692,Rachael,"Kristen's loft was awesome. 
Everyone who came to my husband's surprise Bday party was really impressed with the location and space. 
We loved all the unique touches like the chalkboards in the bathroom. The loft was clean, with lots of space for seating and sleeping. We also loved checking out all the cool bathtubs in their business below the loft. We kind of felt like we were in a secret place. Once again, it is a great location for any sports fans!!
The only small negative would be that it was a bit warm, but they turned on fans for us and AC so we were fine. 
And the shower did feel awesome the next morning! 
Thanks Kristen!!"
1080097,4823013,2013-05-27,6523498,Maks,"A few friends and I rented Kristen's loft on a recent Saturday night. The space was fantastic, and exactly as described. The location was also great -- right next to Safeco Field (perfect for taking in a Mariners game) and only a few minutes away from Pioneer Square. Everyone had a great time, and the loft was a big reason why."
1080097,5122588,2013-06-13,1140401,Ward,"Fantastic location, especially if you are attending events at the stadiums. Also, easy walking distance into downtown Seattle. Hospitality was beyond the call of duty. Well and comfortably furnished."
1080097,5184954,2013-06-17,6391414,Charlie,"What an awesome place!  Everything you need in a place, and the hosts bring you breakfast in the morning.  We had a great time!"
1080097,5397033,2013-06-28,5764371,Viola,"Our stay at the downtown loft was a pleasant experience.
The pictures capture the appearance and urban charm of the loft very well.
One enters the loft on the second floor via the business rooms on the ground floor.
Due to this close arrangement, the loft space is not completely seperated from things happening downstairs.
Kristen, Steve and Shelly were great and caring hosts, 
especially because during buisiness hours, there was always someone downstairs to talk to, 
to answer questions concerning the loft itself or the city.
The loft provides almost all items one might want to use, 
including for example a hairdryer, a flat iron, fridge, coffee machine, microwave, waffle maker, TV, DVDs, WiFi, games, pizza oven, 
microwave, air conditioning, towels, beddings, and even a fireplace.
The sleeping couch is comfortable, as is the air mattress.
The only thing that we missed was a window.
The loft is located downtown next to the stadiums close to King Street Station 
and one can walk to Pike Place market in 25 minutes."
1080097,5422477,2013-06-29,483241,Jane,We had a great stay in the loft!  Shelly took great care to be sure we were comfortable and gave us great advice about the area.  We hope to stay again in the future!   Staying with you made our Seattle adventure even better!
1080097,5441127,2013-06-30,1972570,Sandy And Simon,"A great location for baseball fans! We went to two games in two days and given the traffic generated by the crowd, we were very glad to have been within walking distance to Safeco. Noise was a problem for us (downstairs neighbours), but it was quickly resolved by our hosts once they were made aware of the problem! We met several of the ""Innovative"" family, all of whom were lovely."
1080097,5495548,2013-07-02,6877875,Flannery&Steve,"My friends and I stayed here for the long weekend!  It is in such a great location! We walked to pike market during the day and were only a 2 minute walk from Safeco field to catch the ball game. It was a super hot weekend, so it was nice to have A/C. The hosts were awesome! Super helpful when it came to recommending good spots around the city. Only downside was that there was no windows in the loft. Will definitely be staying here again :) "
1080097,5591967,2013-07-07,4692893,Danielle,"We stayed here for the long weekend of the 4th and had an amazing time! The loft was ridiculous - clean, full of all the amenities you need (including Belgium waffles to make when you wake up!), plus was crazy cool and in a great location! Kristen and the others were all super nice and very accommodating through booking issues (glitch with website) as well as around our timing (we were getting in at 3am from our drive). Beautiful place to stay and very nice people...we will be staying again next time we go back to Seattle! Thanks!"
1080097,5710076,2013-07-13,4157879,Bernard,"Ce loft est incroyablement ben situé, surtout si vous souhaitez voir desmatchs des Mariners ! Mes enfants ont adorés la décoration et le billard ! C'est certainement un des meilleurs rapports qualité prix de Seattle. Petit inconvénient, il n'est pas possible de faire la cuisine (mais ce qui doit être un inconvénient pour les Français seulement;-) mais notre hôte a eu la gentillesse de nous acheter des petites pâtisseries toutes faites et de quoi faire des gauffres. Il y a toujours de la place pour garer sa voiture mais attention les jours de matchs les parkings sont très chers (nous avons payé jusqu'à 45 dollars pour une pres midi de match international). Vraiment un excellent choix, merci !"
1080097,5849621,2013-07-19,7005280,Erin,"This was the first time I had used the site, my kids and I had a wonderful stay. Close to everything as we walked for the most part but did use public transit.  Although our flight arrived early we were able to drop off our bags. We were given a tour, then went to enjoy the day and received notice when the loft was ready.
We were plenty comfortable and it was great having everything there, whether it was in the bathroom or the kitchen. Nice to make breakfast in the morning and relax before starting your adventures. We will be back! Thank you for a wonderful stay!!"
1080097,5944147,2013-07-23,6725757,Caela,"This loft is awesome! I booked it for my husband's surprise 30th birthday, and with lots of flights/friend arrivals/events to coordinate, I sincerely appreciated Kristen and her father-in-law's helpful and friendly demeanor when I checked in. They helped me unload a very full car load and made sure everything was ready for the weekend before leaving. Check in/check out was super-easy, and the loft setup was perfect for our group. It was even stocked with extra towels and sheets to accommodate all 8 of us, slumber-party style. The fridge came stocked with ingredients for homemade waffles, very considerate. Great location next to Century Link Field for the Sounders game on Saturday. I definitely second Kristen's suggestion to use Uber - inexpensive parking is difficult to find in this neighborhood on any day except a quiet Sunday, so we used Uber for the majority of our transportation. Would highly recommend for group events, especially if you plan to attend a Seahawks, Sounders, or Mariner's game!"
1080097,6029620,2013-07-27,7241809,Matt,"We stayed here for a bachelor party in the area and had a fantastic time.  The loft is everything we could have asked for - and more.  If I am staying in downtown for either a game or a night out again, I will definitely try to book this place again!  Highly recommend.  "
1080097,6108710,2013-07-30,5003168,Kenneth,"Great place, great hosts!  Close to everything downtown and a perfect place for a pre-game event (Sounders, Seahawks or Mariners)."
1080097,6344917,2013-08-09,2424592,Yuri,Great location for sports events. Loft is located in the same building as a unique family business. Very friendly owners.
1080097,6457274,2013-08-13,6569093,Shaun,"This Loft was awesome. We ventured to Seattle to watch the Brewers play the Mariners Fri, Sat, and Sun. We were a block from the stadium and just a few blocks from downtown. Pikes Place was within walking distance as well.

The Loft was spacious, well-furnished, and especially accommodating for a group of people looking to have a lot of fun. There was plenty of sleeping room for 5 adult males. The bathroom and kitchen were decorated with some of the items for sale in the business below the Loft; they added a nice, sophisticated touch.

The owners were fabulous. Not only did they provide everything from pillows, blankets, a toaster oven upon request, and other odds and ends, but they got us in contact with individuals around the building to provide convenient food and transportation (Joe's hot dogs out back are outstanding!). One of the owners noticed the wifi was down and had it working within the hour. We cannot say enough about their hospitality.

I am definitely going to request this loft on my next stay in Seattle. I highly recommend this loft and its owners.

"
1080097,6543696,2013-08-16,288924,Tiffany,"The loft was a very hip and fun space to hangout with our friends in Seattle that offered pool, darts and a neat poker table on top of a great location. Seriously, our friends kept wanting to come back to the loft.

It was only a block or two to get to public transportation (Bus 99 goes to Pike and the Needle) and you're minutes (walking) from the football and baseball stadiums, Cherry Coffee and Elysian Brewing Co.

The hosts were great! They had fruit, snacks and drinks waiting for us when we arrived. They even went so far as to have Belgian waffle mix and syrup ready so that we could use the Belgian waffle maker. 

The bathroom had a locking door for the toilet and the shower had a privacy curtain so it was easy to share with other people. I also loved that your could decorate the walls with chalk! Oh, and they had plenty of emergency toiletries and supplies in case you were in a jam.

As for the sleeping arrangements, between the sofa bed, queen air mattress and really comfy (and huge) couch, there was plenty of room to spread out.

I have no doubt that we will be staying here again (if we visit Seattle in the near future) and I would HIGHLY recommend the loft for any group trips: bachlor/ette parties, girls night out, etc. "
1080097,6584548,2013-08-18,1281246,Simon,"1. Location: great for anyone arriving/departing King St Station - an easy 10 minute walk. Sea-Tac airport an easy half-hour light rail, too.
2. Hosts very helpful and made arrival easy.
3. Spectacular space with amazing artwork. Everything worked."
1080097,7006389,2013-09-03,2957266,Tina,"Everything was fabulous!  Shelly was a great hostess and super friendly.  Everything we needed was there and ready for us.  Having the door code for entry was ideal with our group of 4 keeping different schedules all weekend.  The waffle iron was easy to use and a great way to have breakfast each day, and having a fridge for our restaurant left overs meant there were always snacks handy at odd hours.  So many sitting areas throughout that we could each have our own space or mix and mingle to play a game or chat.  We hope to return next year as well!"
1080097,7212177,2013-09-10,8635901,Borja,"The place is great, lovely decoration. It is perfect for parties or tailgates, so go for it if that is what you are looking for. "
1080097,7365319,2013-09-17,7656290,Jennifer,"We had an amazing time at the loft!  It was comfortable, clean and best of all super convenient!  The innovative family was great and we can't wait to stay again.  It really is the perfect spot if you are wanting a great Seattle experience.  Thank you so much for all your hospitality!  "
1080097,7745371,2013-10-01,5815632,Ryan,"Perfect for what we were in Seattle for - a music festival. I'd recommend this to anyone that wants a bit of chill-time after a night-out, but mainly wants to get out and about downtown. We came and went as we pleased and the hosts were all very friendly and helpful!"
1080097,7893351,2013-10-07,2028343,Lauren,"Sheli and this ""woman cave"" were amazing! Perfect spot for a group of friends coming down to Seattle for some fun. Honestly, we felt like we were in THE REAL WORLD: Seattle, which was exactly what this group of late 20s professionals were looking for. And again Sheli is amazing and we wish we could hang out with her more often. We will definitely be back! "
1080097,8095604,2013-10-15,3921388,Steve,"Fantastic place, really added to the Seattle experience. Highly recommended!"
1080097,8366294,2013-10-28,8144950,Kevin,The Loft was awesome! Shelly and Juli were super sweet and very welcoming! Treated our group like family! Will defiantly be staying there again! 
1080097,8432705,2013-10-30,5922428,Rudy,"Had such a great time, in wish we had more time to spend I seattle and explore the list of fun things in the folder that was in the drawer!"
1080097,9075826,2013-12-04,10278230,Sean,The loft was perfect! You can't find a better place for a football game. Shelly was very friendly and kind. I will definitely stay there next time I'm in Seattle. Thanks guys and can't wait to see you again! Hope I can stay a little longer next time. I recommend it to everyone.
1080097,9782602,2014-01-09,6620654,Allie,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1080097,11765003,2014-04-14,7170287,Stephen,"I stayed with friends at the loft for a weekend away in Seattle and I must say that the accessibility to Safeco Field and nightlife downtown was perfect. There was plenty of sleeping space, a pool table to relax and chat at the loft with and an enoumous TV to enjoy. The features made it hard to leave, but the proximity to pike place helped. Thank you for having us! I am sure we will be back soon. "
1080097,12889734,2014-05-13,13282254,Dan,"Place is awesome for a Seattle trip! Its a 5 minute walk to the ballpark! The loft was very clean and it was a great setup. We actually didn't get to take full advantage of the pool table and poker table cause we were so busy touring Seattle. The hosts were great, noise was minimal downstairs. Thanks so much for having us!"
1080097,13019950,2014-05-17,7826206,Leanna, Great location  (just a quick walk to Safeco field). It slept 5 people comfortably and was exactly what we were looking for! The hosts were very prompt to reply to any questions we had and were very welcoming. We all agreed we would recommend and will book again next time we're in Seattle! 
1080097,13079206,2014-05-19,3181079,Sarah,"My husband and his friends adored this flat! It is perfect for any events at Safeco, well kept and clean and a total ""man cave"" feel. Sleeping for 5 is total space, so if a couple guys/girls can bunk together all the better. Thanks so much guys it was awesome! 
"
1080097,13421386,2014-05-27,374682,Michael,"The loft was great! It was a lot of fun. The dart board, pool table, poker table got a lot of use.

Pros:
Great location
Things to play with
Great place to hang out

Cons:
Not many sleeping spots.
Shower is slow to drain
Not many cooking implements"
1080097,13703393,2014-06-02,2743656,Rachel,"The response time from Shelly and Juli was amazing, we had our booking set within a matter of hours.  Shelly was there to greet us, and let us check in a few hours early!  The space was great for our needs (kind of a home base during baseball games).  Tons of space for our large group to crash and lots of great character to the space!  Would definitely come back here!"
1080097,13898207,2014-06-07,14493579,Max,"The best flat we had, since we started using Airbnb. The most friendly and helpful hosts you can imagine. Nice pool table, flatscreen, poker table and darts. Good location to see the city and a safe neighborhood. Thanks for the great time we had in Seattle!"
1080097,14118462,2014-06-12,1135765,Melissa,"The host was great, she was so accomadating and helpful.  I will definitely book this loft again!!"
1080097,14641039,2014-06-23,7686587,Chan,"The place was great. It's a huge studio/loft above a bathtub showroom. It's a very spacious bachelor pad type place. Pictures are accurate. Plenty of street parking (luckily there wasn't a game at either stadiums) and there are train stops at either the International District or near the field. There aren't any windows to the outside, but it's spacious so you won't ever feel confined. There are 2 air conditioners which keep the place nice and cool during the day. The hosts are very helpful and answered all the questions I had. The place has everything you'll need - iron, hair dryer, soaps, utensils, plates and cups, etc."
1080097,14867628,2014-06-28,13196475,Natalie,"We picked this place to host a bachelorette party and it was absolutely wonderful!  When we first arrived the neighborhood seemed a bit sketchy, but our fears about the Loft were allayed the second we walked. Shelly was a wonderful host and sweetly left us two apple pies for our party. The Loft is gorgeous, large, and perfect for entertaining or hanging out. Half a block from Century Link stadium it is perfect place to spend the night after watching a game. Overall everyone loved the space and it was the perfect place to host a party or spend the night. Walking distance from pioneer square and all of the stadiums. "
1080097,14948544,2014-06-30,9012170,Dawn,"What a great place! It is conveniently located walking distance to both the football stadium and the baseball stadium. Great location as a home base to see the city. 
I had a chance to meet Shelly and she is so nice. Thank you family for hosting us.
"
1080097,15191283,2014-07-04,960945,Shawn,"The loft was just as we expected and a great place for a few friends to hang while in Seattle. The hosts were very welcoming and easy going. Check-in was smooth. There are no beds in the apt. but there is a pullout, a futon, and couch to crash on. Overall the place fit our needs perfectly and we had a great time playing pool before going out."
1080097,15334572,2014-07-07,16396893,David,My friends and I decided to stay for fourth of July weekend because of its close proximity to Alki Beach and restaurants. The actual loft is a beautiful space and is perfect for hosting. I will definitely be coming back. 
1080097,15473030,2014-07-09,12029304,Mary,"What a wonderful place to stay! Me and my 2 friends loved the loft - it was charming and certainly unique. It was super convenient to the football and baseball stadium, a very easy walk to the train station (King St/International District light rail, Amtrak), and only a short jaunt to the water and to other great attractions (like Pike's Place). All in all, very happy we stayed here!"
1080097,15920766,2014-07-18,16999706,Joe,"This place was amazing!  I arrived early on sunday afternoon and Shelley had me all set up to check in even though I was a couple hours early.  She event lined up Mariners tickets for me!  I loved Seattle and loved staying at this loft, can't wait to come back!"
1080097,16479435,2014-07-28,1037115,Rose & Glen,"We use Airbnb in all our travels as well as being hosts.  The place was wonderful with a location that couldn't be beat.  I like places that have their own personality and not just a place to sleep.  Their place fit this bill perfectly with its ""man cave"" feel.  I would stay here again with no reservations.  Thank you for the wonderful place."
1080097,16709554,2014-08-01,15183623,Lisa,"This loft is amazing! Love the vintage decorations and I felt very at home! They were kind and generous, offering us anything we wanted from the fridge. They had everything you could need in the kitchen and bathroom, I really didn't need to bring shampoo/conditioner etc.  I was in Seattle mainly for a concert at Safeco field so this location was absolutely ideal being literally beside Century Link and Safeco. The loft of course also has tons of fun things inside - huge tv with cable and dvd's, pool table, poker table and board games! It also is not far from pike place and other great shopping in Seattle (i.e Nordstroms, Ross, TJ Maxx etc). I walked to and from these areas several times or it is a cheap cab or uber ride! Very close to many great spots to eat as well!  It was a great experience and so much cheaper than a hotel! "
1080097,16986236,2014-08-05,14888396,Jared,"Such a unique place to stay, definitely a bit of a party loft. The lack of windows and the hum of the extractor took a bit of getting used to, but would be useful for anyone looking to sleep through a hangover :p Absolutely LOVE the decor, so quirky, and the sofa beds are very comfortable. Obviously ideally located for anyone coming to Seattle to catch some sports."
1080097,17207754,2014-08-09,15858613,Kemery,Not much to say that hasn't already been said about this place. Spacious. Unique. Close to everything we wanted to see on our trip to Seattle. Overall it was a great value. Shelly is very friendly and quick to communicate back. I would have no hesitations booking here again.
1080097,17609294,2014-08-15,2675219,Tiffany,"We had a wonderful stay in this Seattle loft! The location was perfect for us since we attended 3 ball games and were able to walk to the stadium in a matter of minutes. You could also walk downtown and to Pike Place Market.

Parking is challenging in the area, however our hosts were able to find us a free parking spot close to the loft which was appreciated.
There were 4 of us staying in the loft so the bedroom situation wasn't ideal (there aren't separate bedrooms, it's all wide open), however that was my fault for not reading the description properly before booking!
Also there is no stove in the loft so you can't cook your own meals. Although this wasn't a huge problem for us since we were out and about most of the time and ate out a lot.

The hosts were great to deal with and were very helpful in getting us settled. We would highly recommend this loft to those travelling to Seattle!"
1080097,17946982,2014-08-19,17885538,Brian,"Spacious. awesome, fun. Easy to travel to and from. It is exactly like the other reviewers have wrote. First Airbnb experience and I'm glad i took this one. "
1080097,18176470,2014-08-23,13829415,Brandon,"The listing was absolutely amazing, better than described. I unfortunately was unable to meet the hosts because I had gotten into Seattle so late and had to leave early but they were great with communication throughout the entire booking process through Airbnb. Location could not have been better! Definitely recommend for anyone wanting a fun and unique time in Seattle. "
1080097,18783482,2014-09-01,12161032,Kyle,"The loft was awesome! Couldn't have been closer to Centurylink and Safeco. We had a great weekend and walked to everything we went to (smith tower, the water front piers, pikes market, downtown bars and restuarants). We didn't get to meet the hosts but they were very helpful in the reservation/check-in process and responded right away to any questions which was great! The Loft was a lot of fun and was a great deal! Especially since we stayed on such a busy and expensive LaborDay weekend. "
1080097,19856833,2014-09-19,21341862,Alexander,"It was great fun to stay in the loft. It is a walkable distance from the loft to downtown, which was great."
1080097,20004486,2014-09-22,16745363,Andrew,"The team was super helpful in getting us settled in in Seattle - proactive!

The neighborhood is decent, not super attractive but felt safe. Couldn't be closer to CenturyLink - awesome for football!

Great amenities, not too much as far as the kitchen (fridge, microwave, sink, cupboards, but no oven or stove). Can't beat the pool table, darts, and TV - this is the best chill spot to go for a guys trip to Seattle!"
1080097,20467301,2014-09-29,21580226,Ellis,"Check in was smooth.  The place was as described.  However, the wifi was so slow it was almost non functional.  Also, the cable line up was limited (no ESPN).  One day an unknown man came in to the downstairs part of the building and plugged in a battery to charge.  He had the code to the lock and full access to the room.  This was alarming because we were away from the room during the day and left our things there.  It definitely raised some safety concerns.  Location is good.  "
1080097,21275619,2014-10-14,3921388,Steve,"Second time staying here, and would stay again any weekend! Although we didn't get to meet them, our hosts made us feel welcome with freshly made beds when we arrived. Within walking distance of anything downtown, great location, great place, can't say enough great things about this unique loft!"
1080097,22293033,2014-11-03,18847703,Brandon,Awesome place and close to everything. Really spacious and has everything you need. Hosts were always available if you had questions.
1080097,23478345,2014-12-01,15764228,Monique,"It was a very nice place, at 5 minutes walking from the downtown Seattle, so we were very well located for our trip! The house is nice and there is everything you need to spend great parties with friends. We played pool and poker a lot! 
The district is pretty simple, but because it was closed to the center, and all the good place to go, it wasn't annoying... quite the contrary!

The apartment has been well described by the hosts, but the only negative point is that we missed heater and nights were little bit cold.

The overall comment is this place is the one you need to go to enjoy Seattle!!! It was a pleasure :)
"
1080097,23509834,2014-12-02,10782452,Sandra,"did not get to meet the host, but had stayed at the loft last October. great space, great location."
1080097,26353095,2015-02-10,17798750,Chiho,"I've stayed in the room for one month.

The location is easy to go to downtown, international district, 

and capitol hill. 

Fortunately when I stayed in Seattle, I could watch 

Super Bowl and go to Art Walk. Also, I really enjoyed playing 

pool and darts. 

And Shelly and Mike are so nice person!!! 

They are so kind and friendly.

I miss them already. If I go to Seattle again, I want to stay in 

there again.
 


オーナーのシェリーとマイクはとてもフレンドリーで

親切にしてくださいました。部屋はとてもお洒落で

広くて快適でした。交通の便も良く、シアトルを散策するには

とてもベストな場所でした。ぜひ、また利用したいです。
"
1080097,28727801,2015-03-29,28592419,Tao,Our hosts Mike and Shelly were really nice and friendly. They gave us a lot of information including the famous restaurants nearby and about the traffic. 
1080097,30261598,2015-04-19,31099880,Nigel,"We had a fantastic time during our Friday night stay in the lost.   We were celebrating a retirement party and the loft was the perfect location for our pre-game and post-game entertainment.   Firstly this place is unique - if you are expecting a classic house/bedsit that this is not for you.  

This place is all about chilling out and partying.  It is located over a commercial business so the location feels really odd when you walk in.   Head back, up the stairs and you are in party heaven.  It has everything: poker table, pool table, fridge/freezer (with pre ice'd mugs!!), pizza oven, TV with endless sports channels, pull out sofa beds and a super cool bathroom with shower.   Toiletries, towels, sheets, etc. were all provided and the place was spotless.

The location is great for sport events, Pioneer square, etc.   It's literally feet away from CenturyLink field.   Parking during game days can be challenging - we dumped our supplies then headed North a few blocks and found an overnight underground lot by King St station for $20.   5 minutes walk back and it was game on.

Shelly and Mike are perfect hosts - super friendly and just fun people to be around.   We will definitely rent this place again and are already planning out the summer return."
1080097,30358765,2015-04-20,31151834,Lily,"The listing was clean and comfortable, however, I did not feel safe as I am a woman traveling alone and this rental was open to pedi-cabbers who came in at various times to charge a battery. Because it was a keyless entry, I did not feel secure. That was a little unnerving for me so I slept with mace in my hand! 

Additionally, there were no actual beds (only couches and 1 pullout) so for the price, I was a little shocked, however, I did make the most of it and found the space fun as it had a pool table. "
1080097,31293434,2015-05-04,3181079,Sarah,This is our second time renting this loft and it is perfect every time! Great location! We were there for an event at SafeCo and it could not be better suited!! 
1080097,31976000,2015-05-12,31812157,Rebecca,"This place rocks! We stayed here after a Mariners game and it was the most convenient location! Easy walking distance to the ball fields and afterwords we had a great time playing pool and darts! If you want an awesome weekend downtown, stay here! There are really fun bars just blocks away but truly the loft is all the entertainment you need! Word of advice if you are looking to have pizza delivered- the only place open late that will deliver there is A Pizza Mart. And their pizza is pretty good. 

I didn't get the opportunity to meet Shelley but we did meet Mike and he's a stand up guy. When I first read the other reviews, some people said how odd it was that others had access to the entrance to the loft. That did make me nervous but once you see it- it's really no big deal. There is a business downstairs and that's the only place they go. They are pedicab drivers and it's their ""home base"". The loft is totally separate and private, plus those guys are cool. They'll give you a ride if you need one!

All in all we had a killer time and can't wait to stay there again! "
1080097,32546800,2015-05-19,31369183,Jason,Very helpful and hospitable hosts. The place was exactly as the pictures depicted. A great place for a group of friends to stay while catching a game. Couldn't be any closer to the stadiums. Really fun clubhouse vibe.
1080097,33835564,2015-06-01,33119871,Deja,"Shelly was so friendly and helpful! We felt right at home in this beautiful FUN loft!! The loft is clean and decorated perfectly, Shelly even has all the toiletries you could ever want. The location was impossible to beat- parking was even easy! Six of us had plenty of room and the couches were all very comfy! We cannot wait to come back. I cannot recommend this loft enough, and we are so thankful we had the opportunity to stay here while in Seattle!"
1080097,34384599,2015-06-07,15541498,Shelly,"The loft was memorable and unique-- the decor was very well done and funky/fun. The place is conveniently located near the stadiums and Pioneer Square, plus we walked to a great breakfast and coffee at Macrina bakery, which is only a couple blocks south. Overall, a very convenient spot in a one-of-a-kind building. Plus, Shelly had cold beers waiting in the fridge for us when we arrived. Nice!"
1080097,34427747,2015-06-08,31315504,Austin,"The loft was literally in the best location possible! Walking distance to SafeCo field for the Mariners game and some great bars after. The next day we walked to Amtrak and caught our train back to Portland (highly recommended btw).

Our group was here for a bachelor party and it couldn't have been more perfect. "
1080097,34828771,2015-06-12,5529981,Mary,"The owners were great to work with and everything was very smooth.

I chose this property because it was close to my office for a work trip.  I did still manage to shoot some pool.  The place was maybe better suited for a vacation trip, but it worked fine for me.  I would stay there again.

"
1080097,34850657,2015-06-13,29334404,Vic,"Host was fantastic and super helpful.  Directed us to some great lunch spots.  The place was as advertised, right in the middle of downtown and plenty of room.  "
1080097,35091304,2015-06-15,867211,Max,"We hosted a small bachelors party in the space and had a wonderful time! The space is fun and just steps from Pioneer Square, highly recommended! "
1080097,35494840,2015-06-19,175219,Beth,"Shelly and Mike were great hosts, keeping in touch before and during our stay.  The location is perfect to visit Safeco Field and the football stadium and easy walking distance to Pioneer Square and Pike Street Market.  Good restaurants within a few blocks.  The loft is quiet and we slept very well.  I'd be happy to stay here again."
1080097,35597031,2015-06-20,13002044,Chris,Couldn't have worked out better.   Amazing location right by the stadiums.  Great communication from the host.  Will always try to stay here when I come up for a game.  Thanks Shelly! 
1080097,35952623,2015-06-23,32988710,Matthew,"This place is a hidden gem.  If you're heading to 1st Ave for a football game, baseball game or soccer match, you won't find anything better, especially for the price...and you and all your friends can stay together without having to book a bunch of separate rooms.  Also, the place is decked out for entertainment with a mini-kitchen, pool table, etc.  The location is fabulous and the owner is a trip!  She made us feel very welcome.  The only downside is parking, but just find a garage or street parking (just down the street), and leave your car...you won't need it.  Everything is really close...sports venues, restaurants, the Market, and there's a bus line if you really need to head out across the city."
1080097,37031378,2015-07-04,26689898,Karl,Shelly was extremely hospitable and upfront about everything! We could not have had an easier time locating the loft and she provided everything we needed! If I ever have the opportunity to come back to Seattle this is where I will stay without a doubt!
1080097,37485136,2015-07-07,19203428,Eli,"Awesome spot, very unique, I would suggest staying when there is a sporting event on in Seattle due to its perfect location. "
1080097,37869322,2015-07-11,34950925,Alex,"Seattle unique loft was everything it promised and then some. 
The proximity to the stadiums (century & safeco) is unbelievable, and my first reaction when walking into it was 'do we have to leave?'. It is a beautiful space, clean, fun, inviting and completely private. The loft is stocked with everything you need for a comfortable nights stay, and fun extras to make you feel at home (movies, stereo, stocked fridge and kitchen items). I can't say enough good things about this rental. I would (and have) recommend it to anyone wanting an awesome place to have a party, or crash out after a Seattle game.
The owners of the space might actually be cooler then the space it's self... after meeting them the next morning I was tempted to book another stay just so we could all hang out.
Definitely a hidden gem."
1080097,38275178,2015-07-14,33514945,Brandon,"The Mission: Spent a long weekend in Seattle with my brother and a couple of buddies from college to attend some Seattle Mariners games and see the sights. 

The Host: Seattle's Unique Downtown Loft was the perfect place for us to stay. As soon as we arrived, our host treated us like family. She made sure we had everything we needed to enjoy our time in the loft. She gave us tips and suggestions on restaurants, neighborhoods, bars, and local festivals. In case you forget, she leaves you with a binder full of local information and restaurant delivery menus. She even drove us to the store to pick up snacks and beer! We could have walked, but thats just not their style at this place. They really make sure you are taken care of! They are also attentive to any needs you might have during your stay. 

The Loft: This place was perfect and exactly as advertised. We arrived to clean, well appointed, and definitely unique accommodations. We had a blast shooting pool and playing darts while we watched sports on the big screen HD TV. It was the perfect place to spend time with friends and family in-between going out to see everything Seattle has to offer. The chalkboard walls in the bathroom were a great touch and we left our share of graffiti all over them.

The Location: The Downtown Seattle location was perfect for us. Our main goal was to attend a couple of Seattle Mariners games, which we did, by simply walking about 50 yards from the Loft to the gates of SafeCo Field. It was awesome. It was also walking distance to Pike Place Market, the Space Needle, and a ton of bars and restaurants. When we didn't feel like walking, we never waited more than 5 minutes for an Über to swing by and scoop us up. 

The Wrap-Up: Seattle is an amazing city and this Downtown Loft is the best. 10/10 would stay again and again and again. Honestly, we didn't want to leave. 

Perfect For: Baseball games, Football games, Sightseeing, Family Reunions, Bachelor/Bachelorette Parties.

Thank you so much from all of us. We really had an amazing weekend and couldn't have asked for anything more, although if we did, I'm sure you would have accommodated! "
1080097,38582071,2015-07-17,27909243,Hayley,"Location is PERFECT for an event at Century Link/Safeco Field.  Could not have been any closer, easier or more convenient.  Highly recommend this hidden gem and would definitely stay here again.  As four girls visiting, we felt completely safe in the loft and in the surrounding area, even late at night. Our favorite part was the huge, open floor plan with lots of room for dancing!  Loved the chalk in the bathroom too :)  Shelly was awesome - she checked in to make sure we arrived alright and answered a couple last-minute questions within seconds.  Perfect host and perfect loft!"
1080097,38734387,2015-07-18,35594232,Bradley,"This loft was AWESOME. I planned a bachelor party for about 10, and it went over REALLY WELL. The location is a little hard to explicitly explain, but everyone invited has a really great time. It's located above a business, and there's a door code that unlocks the front door. It's secluded enough that you could make a decent amount of noise and not bother anyone!

Shelly was awesome in her constant contact with me while I was setting stuff up at the venue. "
1080097,39494699,2015-07-24,33395967,Robert,"Stayed in Seattle for a few days and wanted to spend time downtown- incredible location only a couple blocks from Pioneer Square, and the perfect spot for game days! The space is a great place to hang out and our host was wonderful. A great alternative to an expensive downtown hotel and a wonderful experience. Parking during the day can be tricky but there are plenty of reasonable garages nearby. it was a great place to come back to after a long day in town and was an excellent addition to our trip!"
1080097,39630000,2015-07-25,28190224,Sophia,"This loft is AMAZING! We had our bachelorette party here and everybody had a blast.  The loft fit the description of the page very well, and we did not have any unpleasant ""surprises"" with the listing. While parking in the area is a bit tricky, the location is great. only a block away from nightlife in Pioneer Square and supremely easy to find with the stadium basically in the loft's ""backyard"". All around, a great place to stay! I look forward to hosting more parties here. "
1080097,39907705,2015-07-27,29295639,Kyle,"Location is everything with this place. You can't stay much closer to CenturyLink or Safeco Field. Shelly and Mike were very helpful and friendly, providing lots of suggestions for things to see and do and good shopping spots. The Loft was a great place to stay for a baseball weekend. One tip for future guests is to pick up everything you'll need for your stay when you get there as it is a pretty far walk to the nearest store to get groceries or alcohol. "
1080097,40529970,2015-07-31,39543658,Sara,"The unique loft in downtown Seattle is more than worth the price!!!  Shelley is so accommodating making sure we arrived with no problems!!  I would love to come back and stay at the loft anytime I visit seattle!! 
Thanks for the best downtown Seattle experience ever!!  Everything is within a few blocks. Walking to shops and restaurants was so easy!!  "
1080097,40907602,2015-08-03,33312870,Renae,"We booked the loft for a bachelorette weekend, and it was an excellent space! We could be as loud as we wanted and wouldn't bother anyone and there was lots of sleeping locations (we did bring a few air mattresses as well, there were 7 of us in total) The only thing that was a bummer, was that we didn't know there wasn't a stove top or oven. If we would have known, we would have brought a griddle or something, but that is just more of an FYI to future guests than any kind of complaint. Shelly was fantastic with her communication with me! The location is fantastic, although parking is a pretty pricey (which is no surprise for the area.) The bride to be loved the space and how we decorated it and she couldn't have been happier. We had a fantastic experience and I am sure I will be booking here again in the future. "
1080097,42311980,2015-08-12,13915304,Isaac,"With a top stadium area location and a cool artsy vibe, this loft fit our groups needs in Seattle perfectly. It was spacious and private.

The billiards table got a lot of use and we frankly used the various props in the place to make our outfits and competition more interesting. The place is well appointed and cool, but it is a bit dark without windows, so keep in mind that there are no balconies or porches for enjoying the views. 

In the end, it is easy to get out of the place to see the shipyards and sports venues or many places to eat and drink in the neighborhood. We enjoyed the place and would stay here again."
1080097,42461211,2015-08-13,40223409,Jodi,"Perfect location! We walked to the boardwalk, walked to dinner, then walked to the Mariners game. You can't get much closer to the stadiums than this. And the hosts were helpful and friendly, as were their small herd of adorable dogs. There was even food in the kitchen."
1080097,43054719,2015-08-17,35815962,Pamela,"We had a wonderful four night stay!  The loft is definitely one of Seattle's  most unique & hidden gems!! Shelly is awesome & our stay was a nice change from staying in a hotel. Super location for sports fans, and walking distance to shopping, great restaurants & pubs. We will definitely be back!"
1080097,43776531,2015-08-22,36153751,Richard,"We didn't get the chance to meet Shelly in person but she was very proactive & quick to respond to any questions. She even suggested a great spot for breakfast. The location of the Loft is weird & excellent all at the same time! As previous people have mentioned, it's above a bathtub & ricksha storage business. You walk through the tub showroom to the back and up the stair to the Loft...that's the weird. The excellent is the location to the baseball stadium, football stadium and Pyramid Brewing, all a short 1-2 block walk. The atmosphere is great; pool table, darts, poker table, TV, sound dock, chalk walls and heels! My only warning would be the lack of a real bed. It has a couch hide-a-bed, a futon & nice sofa which are great for a night but you quickly remember why you don't sleep on a hide-a-bed or futon at home...but for 1 night, this was not an issue. A great time & I hope I have the chance to go back when there is a game. Thanks again for everything Shelly."
1080097,44133751,2015-08-24,37252942,Mathew,"The loft was the perfect place to base our bachelor party. Central location downtown next to the stadiums and easy walk to pioneer square. The room was large and included everything we needed to keep everyone entertained. The owners were great with communication, never leaving anything to question. This is the best place for a small group to gather before or after a M's, Sounders, or Seahawks games."
1080097,44443982,2015-08-26,1358664,Weldon,"This is definitely a unique downtown loft. Shelly really did a great job in decorating and outfitting the loft. It has that great feel for fun group to hang out together, from the pool table, to the poker table, and others. It's located great, right next to Century Link field but you can't hear the noise at all. Great for mornings when you aren't at your best! 

It should probably be noted for couples, there is not a secure way to lock the room from the business below, though there was no concern or problems. The stairway leading to the room has an open half wall with a doorway that you can lock, but a determined sort could look over the half wall and see into the room.

Again, was not an issue, but would be something that would be good to know going into it. 

Shelly is great about communication, and it was a good value, clean, and well appointed. 
"
1080097,44723056,2015-08-28,4153423,Matt,Nice place. Easy to work with. Thank you!
1080097,45374438,2015-09-02,21265469,Aleen,"What a great location, especially if you are going to a game! The place was clean and had everything we needed (except no oven or range so don't plan on cooking a meal). The kitchen had snacks and essentials already there which was a nice touch! Loved the pool table and bathroom set-up. Be aware that sleeping arrangements include a pull-out couch and an air mattress so if you have issues with comfort this would not be your best bet. Also, there are no windows so it was a little strange when waking up to pitch blackness and wondering if it was 6am or 10am! Overall it was a great pick and I would highly recommend. Uber rides to tourist locations like the Space Needle and Pike Market were only $6-$9! "
1080097,45779915,2015-09-06,35675038,Jerome,The loft was great! It was perfect for what we needed for the day before my wedding! The location was awesome! Thanks again for everything Shelly!
1080097,46112809,2015-09-08,21129494,Jason,Very enjoyable!
1080097,47017214,2015-09-14,15323825,Mitchell,Very cool spot in a great and central location. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here and the decor was a nice touch!
1080097,47796095,2015-09-21,29320340,Bryan,The host was friendly and made us feel welcome. We were given suggestions on places to go and things to do. The loft was clean and comfortable and it felt safe to come and go. 
1080097,49886806,2015-10-07,39969209,Lex,Shelly was a fantastic hostess! She responded promptly and assisted our party in all our requests! Alaska will be back!
6327506,35498683,2015-06-19,34984852,Erwin,"We found a very comfortable and clean studio with all you can imagine. Even the smallest detail was taken care off so nothing is missing. Great value and close to down town Seattle. We had a rental and were within 10 min in the center. Tyanne and her partner are very friendly and offered several times to supply us with anything that could be missing. Bed is comfortable and coffee and thee is available. 
Thanks again for the hospitality, Erwin & Maud."
6327506,35836470,2015-06-22,29544970,Catherine,"Tyanne and Elizabeth's place is the perfect place if you're visiting Seattle. Quite frankly, I'm surprised why they don't have more reviews! Located just 10 min away from downtown Seattle, the studio was easily accessible and Tyanne and Elizabeth made sure we knew they were available for help or just recommendations on foods and sightseeing. The studio had a fresh, modern look and was fully equipped with everything you needed and more (saved us trips to the store!). We were constantly in and out during our stay, and the separate access was super convenient, especially for those who don't want to be bothersome. There was also plenty of free, easy parking right outside. Again, 10 min away from downtown, so it's not like you're out of the way. Plus, it's on the way back to SeaTac airport. Will definitely stay here again!"
6327506,36152677,2015-06-25,35593224,Stephanie,The prefect place to stay when in Seattle! The location and room were both ideal. When we return to Seattle we'd love to stay here again. You have your own private studio that's makes you feel like home- just a lot cleaner. 
6327506,36574926,2015-06-29,23398588,Marx,"Tyanne and Elizabeth were very accommodating. They texted us on the way to Seattle just to tell us that the unit is ready and that we do not have to wait until 3:00 PM. That gave us a couple of hours snooze time before going out.
Although we were not able to talk to them personally, they were only a text away if you need anything. The unit was very comfortable and private. I love having the kitchenette. The small fridge has simple but necessary items and the keurig coffee maker was a huge plus.
It is close to a bus stop and plenty of street parking. 
They kept us updated with recommendations on where to eat and where to go. Overall an excellent experience."
6327506,38304336,2015-07-14,29516888,Jessi,"The place was amazing, every detail!!! We loved it and we hope go back really soon, the are is quite and good parking in the street, really close to downtown, and the hosts really heplfull"
6327506,38726585,2015-07-18,12811878,Diane,"We had such a wonderful stay at this suite! Tyanne and Elizabeth were very easily accessible via phone/airbnb for any questions. They were very welcoming and willing to help. We had a few unexpected changes in our travel plans, and they were so flexible and accommodating. The suite is just as advertised in the pictures and even better! It is nestled on the back side of the townhouse on the lower level of the home. In a quiet neighborhood that felt very safe. The suite was very clean, and Tyanne and Elizabeth certainly make sure you feel at home. Even down to the small details of post-its and pencils for travel notes/reminders to ear plugs in case you're a light sleeper. The bed is very comfortable, and we enjoyed relaxing with netflix (provided on the tv) after a long day of exploring. The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed (even ziplock bags, which really came in handy!). The closet was spacious, and the bathroom was very clean. We also enjoyed the convenient access through the door code instead of worrying about keeping track of keys while we roamed the city.  Traveling downtown is easy whether you rent a car or take public transportation. We also took advantage of Uber, and the average cost to Pike Place area was ~$13. Overall, this was one of the best airbnb experiences that we have had, and we highly recommend this suite! We would definitely stay here again!"
6327506,39408699,2015-07-23,35751637,Tamara,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and it was a great one. Tyanne and Elizabeth were excellent hosts. They thought of everything in the suite, from a hair dryer in the bathroom, to ziplock baggies for packing lunches, to tourist maps and city information that was very useful. Although we didn't meet them in person (since we had a code for the door), they kept in touch with us via text message to make sure our stay was going smoothly and to see if we needed anything. When we did need one small item (a spatula) it was waiting for us at the door when returned from our day of sight-seeing. I would highly recommend Tyanne & Elizabeth as your Seattle hosts!"
6327506,40011844,2015-07-27,21855517,Emily,"Tyanne and Elizabeth are excellent hosts! The suite was very private and comfortable. The coffee/tea/hot cocoa bar was a great touch that I took advantage of. We also loved the smart tv and available parking! 
"
6327506,40756264,2015-08-02,719922,Susan,"Staying at Tyanne and Elizabeth's was terrific! Not only was the studio perfectly tidy, but it really did have everything we could have needed. Nothing was left out, and it felt like a home away from home. It's just the right size, and the bed is fantastic. The location and neighborhood was nice, quiet, and convenient, and my husband and I were able to bus into downtown or around anywhere with ease. Besides all this, Tyanne and Elizabeth were wonderful hosts and went above and beyond to help us out when we ran into some unexpected medical mishaps during out trip. We loved staying here and would recommend it with gusto! "
6327506,41380166,2015-08-07,4778787,Lysa,Tyanne and Elizabeth are the perfect hosts and their apartment was exactly what we needed. I would highly recommend this location.
6327506,41950860,2015-08-10,34877484,Karen,"It felt like a nice little studio home! The host put cute sticky notes to welcome us with a can of cookies. There's also few bottles of water in the fridge,  which came very handy when we were thirsty. The place is very neat and complete...even the little detailed things like having a hair dryer, salt, jam, different phone charger outlets, hangers,  towels,   microwave,  glasses and plates, Netflix, fans, tourist brochures, umbrellas, etc. It's everything that a visitor can asked for! The door lock can easily be locked with a code, and the entrance is very private and kind of hidden through a side gate.  Easy access and super private!  Love it! The parking on the street can get pretty full in the evening though. And the neighborhood is very quiet. Would definitely recommend this to anyone that loves a cute and comfy, private and quiet stay :)"
6327506,42690259,2015-08-15,23292385,Josh,Tyanne and Elizabeth were wonderful hosts. Both were extremely accommodating and ready to help with anything we needed while in Seattle. The room was completely clean and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this listing to anyone going to Seattle!
6327506,43384104,2015-08-19,22294170,Rosemary,"I want to write about how lovely this unit is but more importantly- I've never met such wonderful hosts! The girls, Tyanne and Elizabeth, answered so many questions for us during our stay. This was really helpful since we are relocating to Seattle in a few weeks. The unit itself is perfect. Every single detail was thought out and each need anticipated. We felt right at home! The bed was really comfortable, the unit clean and spacious, the area felt safe. The girls also let us check in a bit early which was really helpful. We normally use airbnb when traveling but have never had such a pleasant experience as our trip this past week! Thank you Tyanne & Elizabeth!"
6327506,44641194,2015-08-28,33450964,Christina,"Tyanne and Elizabeth were excellent hostesses! They consistently checked in to ensure we did not need anything and did everything to make our first airbnb experience perfect! Their studio was exactly as described and the keirug coffee, tea, creamer, first aid kit, iron and ironing board were all much appreciated! Would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a comfy little spot!"
6327506,45496235,2015-09-03,1012994,Sarah,"If you are staying outside of the city to save a little money this is a very cozy place to stay. It is easy to Uber to downtown Seattle and during high traffic times the most you will pay is $15-20.  We loved the apt and found it to be spotless and welcoming. Our hosts also went out of their way to make sure everything that we needed was available and even had extra coffee and creamers for us when requested. They responded  quickly to all communication leading up to the trip which was very helpful as we were traveling through multiple cities. There is AC, extra umbrellas, use of a small kitchen-this apt has everything a traveler needs, plus everything is new and clean. We also enjoyed the private yard outside of our door. And enough cannot be said about our hosts Tyanne and Elizabeth, they are wonderful AirBnb hosts!-Sarah and Mylaina. "
6327506,46151690,2015-09-08,30232295,Chloe,"This little suite was a life saver. It had everything we needed and a great price. All of the reviews I read on it were extremely accurate. It's technically in south Seattle, but about a $10-13 uber ride to any sight seeing spots. Overall, great place to stay and the hosts were so helpful and sweet. "
6327506,46598249,2015-09-12,38788808,Ben,"Tyanne and Elizabeth were great hosts, responding quickly to every question or comment we had about their suite. They couldn't have been more accomodating. As for the place itself - it has a small footprint, yet doesn't feel the least bit cramped. It was incredibly homey. My wife LOVED the cute amenities left everywhere, from the coffee and pancakes to the box stocked with toiletries. Even the bodywash smelled amazing and the towels were like fluffy clouds. Her words, not mine. The location is a bit of a distance from the heart of downtown but within $10 on an Uber or Lyft. Quiet and safe. Would highly recommend staying with Tyanne and Elizabeth."
6327506,47260498,2015-09-17,39558637,Dafne,"Tyanne and Elizabeth's studio was really great! It was very beautiful, homey, and smartly set up. They were both great to communicate with and were very flexible with our arrival and check out. Their suggestions for eateries and tourist[ing] were spot on, especially the Hanger Café (Triple B for the win!!!).  Also, the location was pretty great. The bust stop was in the next block over and we were about 35 to 45 minutes away from all the major Seattle spots like Capitol Hill, Pikes Market Place, and the Space Needle. It was a really great quiet residential area to just walk around and relax. I would highly recommend this place to anything interested in visiting Seattle."
6327506,48177422,2015-09-24,36349434,Stephanie,"WOW!!! I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay during my vacation in Seattle! Everything looked exactly like the pictures!
Location: super quiet neighborhood and a 5-10 min drive to downtown!
Studio: was perfect! It's small but just what you need for two people, my girlfriend and I never felt cramped even with our 4 suitcases and two backpacks in the room. It is immaculately clean and has all the right things you need and then some! The kitchen is fully equipped with dishes and utensils for cooking. The mini fridge came stocked with a few waters, some eggs, hot sauce and butter which was a godsend because we flew in hungry and thirsty! Bathroom has everything you need: shampoo, conditioner, body wash, shave gel even a flat iron under the sink! Bed was comfy, my girlfriend found that she actually slept better in that bed than in her own. They also have city guide books, a little map of places nearby, a really cool charging station in the corner and the television is amazing! 
The private walkway and patio was also really nice to have; we never wanted to disturb anyone with coming in and out and we never felt like we did.
Host: AMAZING!! Tyanne and Elizabeth were so sweet!! They live upstairs but we rarely heard anything. They checked in with us every so often to make sure we had everything we needed and gave us suggestions on places to go see/eat. They respected our privacy 100%, I was even a little bummed that I never ran into them or had real time to talk and thank them face to face for their wonderful hospitality. 
So if you're looking for a nice, clean, quiet, comfy place to stay while visiting Seattle, I HIGHLY recommend this studio; I give it an A+! I will definitely be looking to book this spot for my next trip and will be telling my friends and family about it as well!"
6327506,49283038,2015-10-02,39731940,James,"This was my first Airbnb and it was a fantastic experience. Everything in the description was very accurate. The memory foam bed was amazingly comfortable, which came in handy after a long day out in Seattle. I didn't spend much time inside (basically only to sleep and shower) but it's definitely a nice place to just hang out and relax if you don't feel like doing anything for a day. I didn't get a chance to meet the hosts in person but we communicated via text and they respond quickly. The neighborhood is nice and quiet. The streets can be packed with cars at night, but I was always able to find parking within a few blocks away, so keep that in mind if you're driving. I used Uber most of the time to get to downtown and it only cost about 13 bucks. Overall I had a great experience and would definitely look them up again the next time I plan to stay in Seattle. "
6327506,49980853,2015-10-08,40167472,Cindy,"Wow, what a wonderful introduction to Airbnb! The ladies were very nice, helpful and interesting. The unit was very clean and had everything I could have wanted. I could imagine living here full time it was so nice! I especially loved the thick white towels in bathroom and push key entrance. They recommended restaurants and I loved the mexican one (didn't try the others for various reasons). It was quiet and near the bus stop. Getting downtown was easy too. All in all I would recommend this place 150%. I would definitely use again if I go back to Seattle. "
6327506,51013450,2015-10-17,34316014,Casey,"My husband and I had a wonderful experience in this studio. Upon arrival (which is keyless entrybtw-awesome), we admired how well laid out everything was. They had snacks for us, bottled water and every ""oh crap, I forgot to pack..."" item you can think of. 
The tv was a tad complicated for us cause it's an Internet tv and we weren't sure how to do everything. (Which for the record totally would have been easily fixed if we had called to ask, but we found Netflix and honestly what more do you need!).
The bed was comfy and I really liked the comforter. It was chilly one night and they were so nice to call and see if we needed more blankets. The studio has everything you need and is in a good neighborhood. A bunch of local restaurants and bars down the street and ten minutes to downtown Seattle. This place is perfect for a couple or single wanting to experience Seattle without all the hassle of a hotel. We would absolutely stay in their place again if traveling again. They say they live upstairs, but we didn't hear them once. Overall, great air b&b experience!"
6327506,51911003,2015-10-25,29544970,Catherine,"This is my second time staying at Tyanne and Elizabeth's studio, and just like my last review, all has been excellent so far! Although there has been a change in the weather since I was last here (Summer), we were still very comfortable and were even offered additional blankets that we ended up not using all of. Oh, and great air purifier/humidifier machine thing that helps if you're sick! Again, very accommodating and, without a doubt, would come back anytime I am in or around Seattle. Two thumbs up. "
6327506,52866278,2015-11-02,45685260,Alexandria,"Tyanne & Elizabeth set a very high standard as my first AirBNB experience. The room was better than expected, even with a bag of cookies waiting for our arrival. Perfect size for 2, the room was fully stocked with everything from Q-tips and make-up removal wipes to a hair dryer and shampoo/conditioner. We even got to enjoy our morning coffee on the patio (when it wasn't raining). The house is no more than a 10 minute drive to downtown, although we chose to walk (took about 40 minutes) to enjoy the views. Overall, Tyanne and Elizabeth provided everything we could need to make our vacation the best. Recommend for anyone."
6327506,53495009,2015-11-09,46040499,Dayna,Elizabeth did a great job making us feel welcome in the suite. It was easy to find and easy to get inside without her help. The neighborhood was our favorite part with restaurants just a short walk down the hill. The scenery was gorgeous and we loved that it was just a quick ride to downtown Seattle. Overall a great experience from beginning to end - we'll be coming back again one day no doubt. 
6327506,54245778,2015-11-17,45315667,Michael,"This was my first time using Airbnb and let me tell you these hosts made it so easy and comfortable for my gf and myself. I was a little nervous at first but as soon as I opened the door to our place, the atmosphere felt so welcoming. They left a little welcome note with a bag of yummy cookies. This little cozy studio had everything you needed for the most part. The fridge came with eggs, water, condiments, beer and even the cupboards were stocked with cereal, pancake mix, spaghetti and more. This place was the perfect size for the 2 of us! I kept in contact with the hosts throughout our trip and they were so nice and always told us that for we need ANYTHING to let them know. Parking wasn't too bad. It's street parking and first come first serve. But the few days we were in and out, the furthest we had to walk was just around the block. They also left a lot of brochures for things to do and places to eat so that helped a lot as well. I would definitely come back and stay here when I come back to Seattle! "
6327506,54728242,2015-11-23,12813474,Tim,"This was my first AirBnB and it was a great first impression. Everything was clean and they even provided snacks and tea! The maps with nearby points of interest was a really nice touch and was very appreciated.

This was a great place to have a nice weekend in Seattle. I'll be checking to see if the room is available again the next time I visit."
6327506,55566865,2015-12-02,7462939,Istvan,"The 2 ladies are super nice, they do so much to make the guest feel comfortable. Also, they were the first hosts for us who made sure we do have something to eat (as airBnB should mean bed AND breakfast originally). They also refilled the sugar & cream supplies for the coffee machine (which is a very good machine btw). The flat is very clean and cozy too. Bed is big and comfy, tv is also cool, we liked watching netflix by the end. Area feels safe, the only disadvantage is it is situated like 20 min from downtown however several bus lines are nearby. All in all we had a wonderful stay here, highly recommended."
6327506,55904322,2015-12-07,149028,Adrienne,"Very cozy and the bed is super comfy! Tyanne & Elizabeth thought of everything you need. 

FYI, Google takes you only to the street where you can't see their address. The house is actually at the back half of the condo complex which you can get to by the driveway in the middle of it (around the corner). "
6327506,56670923,2015-12-16,48368857,Rob,This was an amazing studio. I walked in on my first night and felt at home. Studio looked exactly like it does in the picture. Liz and Tyanne are very welcoming and very helpful. They provided various tourism information if you ran out of activities to do in Seattle. The studio is about 10 minute drive away from the city and is a very quiet neighborhood. Parking was easy to find any time of day on the street. I'd definitely stay here again in Seattle when I come back. 
6327506,57018679,2015-12-21,10616939,Calvin,"A well-situated and affordable choice for visiting seattle. The room and adjacent bathroom were both very clean and the bed was quite comfortable. 10 minute walk to a number of great restaurants and a few antique shops. About a 40 minute bus ride into downtown, so allow an hour to get there."
6327506,57393679,2015-12-25,36241630,Yuxuan,This place is amazing! So cozy to live. Public transportation is also convenient to reach nearly everywhere. If I have a chance to go back to Seattle. Their place will be my first choice
6327506,58336718,2016-01-02,49033036,Bianca,What an awesome first experience for us using air b&b! Elizabeth and Tyanne's place was simply perfect and we could not have asked for a better experience. They answered all of our questions and even provided a few suggestions about their neighborhood. Their attention to detail made staying their feel like home. We will be back for sure!
6686072,37390163,2015-07-06,6586490,Theresa,"First off, the cottage is adorable!  Everything is brand new and super clean.  We slept very well on the king size bed.  On top of the comfortable space Mariam was so accommodating.  We stayed here with our 2 month baby and asked Mariam if there was a rocking chair.  A few days later, she send me a message saying that she found a rocking chair and it was already in the cottage!  When we arrived, she had local wine and snacks waiting for us.  How kind!!!  This cottage is also within walking distance to Greenlake.  Unfortunately, our schedule was fairly busy but we still made time to make the short walk there and enjoy the water.  She went above and beyond to make our stay relaxing and enjoyable.  Both my husband and I enjoyed visiting with her and throughly enjoyed our stay in her cottage.  We have stayed in a few different houses/apartments using airbnb and this was by far the nicest!  If we are in the area again, this cottage will be our first choice!  Thank you so much Mariam!"
6686072,38414797,2015-07-15,33860247,Yusef,The host was great. They gave us space but made themselves available if we needed anything. The description was fine. 
6686072,40462653,2015-07-31,26937638,Mineko,"This was my first time using AirBnB.  We booked the cottage for two weeks during our one- month visit to Seattle.  As soon as we saw the place, we realized we should have splurged and booked it for a month.  The place was beautiful and had all the amenities we needed.

Traveling with a 21 mo old picky eater, being able to cook really helped.  We also loved the fact that there were a washer, a dryer and even a dishwasher.  The bathroom was roomy.  Our toddler really enjoyed running around in the backyard.

What made our stay really special the location.  We were minutes away from Tangletown (great family friendly restaurants) and Greenlake.  My husband enjoyed running around the lake almost every morning.  We also took our child to several different parks within walking distance.  

We highly recommend this place!

>

PCC Greenlake - a natural food store near the lake, with 90 min free parking.  A great place to buy wild salmon, local organic produce (NW berries and cherries!), ready meals, etc.  A good place to pick up food if having a picnic.

Woodland Park Zoo - a few minutes drive from the cottage.  Our toddler loved the zoo.   

Ballard Locks and Fish Ladder - our boy loved looking at yachts and boats.

Golden Gardens - nearest beach, I think.

Seattle Center - has a huge fountain.  Seattle Children's Museum was a good place to escape the summer heat.  Older kids may enjoy the Space Needle, EMP and monorail.

University Village - a family friendly mall with a nice, covered play area.  There is a cute toy store next to the play area.  Din Tai Fun in the mall is an excellent Chinese restaurant...authentic food, good service and kid-friendly."
6686072,41966007,2015-08-10,36304006,Shannon,"This experience could not have been more positive. The accommodations were all we were looking for and more! Very convenient for where we were going to be each day. Everything was modern, new and very clean and comfortable! Bonus of having a garden with fresh fruits and vegetables to enjoy, as well as being provided with some extra comforts when we arrived. We would highly recommend this location and hope to go back again!!! "
6686072,43084645,2015-08-17,18118078,John,"Marian and Peter made us feel very welcome, and the apartment was as described in the listing.
This is a wonderful place to stay. First, the apartment itself is beautifully done and all fixtures and appointments are top flight. Secondly, the location is excellent. It's in a quiet neighborhood away from the bustle of downtown Seattle and a short walk from Green Lake (the lake itself) and a small shopping area with some excellent small restaurants and a brew pub."
6686072,43642353,2015-08-21,37907871,Olivia,"What a wonderful place to stay! The unit was brand new and a beautiful space. My family was in town visiting (grandma, mother, sister and my 20 month old niece), and while the space was a little tight with all of us, we were very happy with the space we had. We were delighted to have all the kitchen tools we could possibly need to make meals during our stay. The bedroom had enough space to put a pack n' play for the baby to sleep in and the kitchen sink was the perfect size for my niece to take a bath in. :) Marian and Peter were great, they were helpful and available but gave us plenty of space. Greenlake is a very nice neighborhood in Seattle and very walkable. I highly recommend checking out The Butcher and The Baker restaurant down the road. As far as driving to other areas of Seattle, getting into the city center/downtown from Greenlake is pretty easy but I recommend trying to avoid rush hour because you can find yourself sitting in traffic for quite some time. All-in-all, my family and I were very happy with our stay! "
6686072,44781713,2015-08-29,30193954,Kim,"This cottage could be featured on HGTV!!  It is beautiful. The location has great access to I-5. We had breakfast in the Tangletown area which was an easy walk. Marian welcomed us with snacks, wine, and coffee/tea.  The kitchen was well stocked and there are lovely amenities in the bath. Communication, which can be worrisome, was excellent. Don't hesitate....just make the reservation!!!"
6686072,45499950,2015-09-03,16261772,Frank&Marta,"The description of this property is very accurate, the home is amazing and very functional .
The attention to every detail was greatly appreciated!
Marian is a great communicator and the keyless access is a great idea. ( saves time )
We also enjoyed a great local white wine and snacks left for us
I simply can't say enough about our stay and host."
6686072,45978875,2015-09-07,40118485,Robert,"She communicated to us everything we needed to know about the apartment and greeted us upon arrival. We loved the unit, its cleanliness and all the new appliances and TV. It is truly a unique and beautiful place to stay and we hope to return our stay on our next visit to Sesttlr. The neighborhood and location were perfect.
"
6686072,46604857,2015-09-12,40040856,Judy,"We were in Seattle for 5 nights and totally enjoyed staying here! Marian is a terrific hostess, immediately making us feel at home and making sure any questions were answered. The pictures are accurate, the place is really cute and very clean. We absolutely loved the Garage Door open - and there is privacy with the Bamboo they have growing right outside the door. Kitchen is wonderful - stocked with all one would need (and a dishwasher!). 
We were there with our adult son who slept on the sofa bed in the living room and we thought there was plenty of room. The bathroom is a very good size, not small at all. The bedroom is wonderful - great bed! If you have a car, they have even given us the driveway to park in.  This is great for loading/unloading and we always have a parking spot. We noticed that the street parking gets tight.
We'll be back in Seattle and this is where we look forward to staying again.  Honestly, this could not be a nicer place to stay - but the icing on the cake is Marian! She made us feel so welcome.
Last thing I'll mention is that Trader Joe's only has 3 locations in the Seattle area and one of these is only about a mile from here. Huge plus!!
We felt that the location was also good in relation to the Seattle area. You just can't miss by choosing this place to stay!"
6686072,48178900,2015-09-24,38553039,Praphanit,"Marian was very welcoming and everything about the place was just perfect for my family and I. The neighbourhood was nearby the bus stop as well as multiple restaurants just down the road, which was great! Also, Marian took care of us really well and made sure we didn't feel like something was missing. It was a home away from home."
6686072,50942663,2015-10-16,7761201,Daniel,"I reserved this airbnb for my parents while they were on an extended visit in Seattle. They were very happy. They had this to say: 
""Our two week stay was very pleasant in this airbnb. The accommodations were clean and comfortable.   It was nice to have a perfectly planned efficiency apartment to call home for our visit to the area.  The washer dryer was one extra that made life easy as a visitor.  We would definitely stay here again."""
6686072,52758687,2015-11-01,19006008,Maria,"We rented this place for our first two weeks in Seattle. We were moving from Montreal and we didn't know anyone and had never been in the city. 

Renting La Casetta was a gamble but it was worth every penny!! 

The place is big, clean and cosy! It has everything  anyone might need. 

Full equipped kitchen with pantry essentials  ( coffee, tea, creamers, spices, salt, pepper, snacks,oil, vinegar.... All the cleaning and cooking products you could ever need). 

Fully equipped bathroom with a big shower and with all the hygiene essentials (big size shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, lotion, they even had a blow dryer and some shaving razors.... Toilet paper and Kleenex). 

It has a washer and dryer and dishwasher and all you need to use them.

The king sized bed was very nice and comfy... Fluffy pillows and extra banquets. Everything was brand new and really clean!! 


We were only 2 but you could easily accommodate 2 more because of the big sofa bed in the living room. 

Internet was fast and the cable tv had many channels and was big. 

We had our own parkway to park the car but the street looked like it is easy to find parking in case you have more than one vehicle.


The best part about this perfect little home was its owners: Marian and Peter. They were waiting for us with a local wine bottle and they were always ready to answer all of our questions! They were very generous enough and welcoming!! 

They were very knowledgeable of public transport and what to do around the house and neighbourhood. 


Green lake is great!!!! Awesome place with coffee places, restaurants and a great jogging and summer water sports (you can rent kayaks near the lake) and all if this is minutes away from the house. 

I could not have asked a better way and better hosts to start this adventure!!! We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to anyone!!! 
 
THANK YOU SO MUCH MARIAN AND PETER!!!  

Maria and Marc "
6686072,54329467,2015-11-18,849407,Joni,"We stayed at Marian and Peter's for a week. Marian was out of town which was the only negative as I would love to have met her. Since we use to live in Seattle we didn't need much help, but Peter was available if necessary. All the previous reviews were spot on. We have stayed in a number of Airbnb properties in Seattle and this is by far the nicest. In the future it will be our first choice. We were here during a nasty storm and when were out it was warm and inviting to come back to. Lots of great amenities so all you need is your toothbrush. Thank you Miarian and Peter. Look forward to meeting you Marian next time we are in town."
7021906,47427181,2015-09-18,43965964,Katy,"Our group loved staying here. Mercy was totally accommodating with times to check-in and check-out. The house was exactly as advertised, with some great additions not even really highlighted (cork flooring, take a beer leave a beer policy, plenty of privacy, close to stores/bars/etc.). And with 7 people it was more than enough space. "
7021906,50839645,2015-10-15,21503673,R,"Wonderful stay, home was beautiful and very cool Neighborhood. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. "
7021906,53964005,2015-11-15,7759171,Steven,"This is a FANTASTIC house. We were 5 adults and two children and we had plenty of room (we rented the main house and the basement apartment). It is in fantastic condition. The kitchen is enormous and has everything you could possibly want. We made a meal for 15 one evening and it was a not a problem at all. There are toys galore for children and laundry facilities as well. Ballard is a great neighborhood and it's easy to get downtown, easy access to the airport, safe, and convenient. The systems worked great including lots of TV options. Would stay here again in a heartbeat. "
7021906,56025039,2015-12-08,8119485,Nancy,"The Plum Modern house was ideally suited for a recent trip to Seattle for a family wedding. With ten adults and two children coming in from various states, staying at Plum Modern allowed us to stay together as a family, prepare and eat meals together, and was only minutes from the wedding venue. We all took turns exploring the neighborhood and shopping at the local stores. The kids enjoyed playing with available toys and eveyone pulled books out to read on especially rainy evenings. We even got to enjoy a little time in the hot tub - such gorgeous views from the roof! We were all grateful for the opportunity to stay together at Plum Modern, and several of us discussed renting the apartment at some point in the future when we return to visit the bride and groom. :)"
7021906,56678587,2015-12-16,221417,Karthik,The place was gorgeous and really nice. We loved how well everything was labeled (the documentation for the place is fantastic). We used it as a work retreat and found it quite spacious. We'll definitely reconsider the place for a future Seattle visit.
4694479,28761029,2015-03-29,29914518,Alasdair,"I had a extremely comfortable and restful three nights here. I felt very welcomed, the room was immaculate and very comfortable and I was given all the information that I needed. The location is quiet, perfect for exploring Ballard and downtown Seattle is only a short journey away."
4694479,29347154,2015-04-06,1241829,Nicole,"Kaiser and Heather made us feel so welcome staying with them in Ballard, and definitely went above and beyond to make us comfortable! Kaiser was full of tips and local recommendations, and the extra touches really made our stay great. Thanks so much Kaiser and Heather!"
4694479,29535564,2015-04-08,1241829,Nicole,We had such a great experience with Kaiser we ended up extending our stay. Thanks for making us feel so at home! 
4694479,29708049,2015-04-11,17040894,Kathy,"Kaiser was on top of communicating with me, timely and concise, since our differing schedules meant most likely we wouldn't actually see each other. The bedroom is on 1st floor of 3 story residence, with separate, private bath down the hall. Very private and quiet. This was single night stay with an early morning departure, chosen because I had 8 am class at adjacent Fishermens Terminal, followed by my departure from Seattle. I know this neighborhood well and it is a walker's dream with close access to all Central Ballard has to offer. Bed was comfortable, shower's water pressure excellent-all was clean and comfortable. A definite recommend!"
4694479,29896905,2015-04-13,29978216,Johnny,Kaiser and his family are very welcoming and have a beautiful home. The area accommodates for pretty much any need you would have. Would strongly recommend.
4694479,30306355,2015-04-20,22824918,Kerry,"My stay at Kaiser's home was perfect for my needs. He was very prompt and clear in responding to all of my questions related to checking in and the neighborhood. The room is quite comfortable, very clean and very nicely furnished with a private bath just down the hall. I loved the privacy of the first floor accommodations so I could come and go without bothering my hosts. The street parking was easy and the neighborhood is quiet and very safe feeling to walk around even late at night. His location is very convenient for exploring the wonderful Ballard restaurants, Sunday farmers market and coffee shops by foot. I would definitely recommend a stay at Kaiser's beautiful home. "
4694479,30640449,2015-04-25,29471290,Casey,"Kaiser and his family are great! The place is about a 10 minute walk to the busy parts of Ballard and a two minute walk to the bus. The bus system in Seattle is amazingly easy to navigate. The room is a bit small, but everything was impeccably clean and the hospitality was top notch. Also, the bed was so soft and comfortable. You get what's advertised, and Kaiser and his wife go above and beyond to make sure you are comfortable. "
4694479,30836871,2015-04-27,14909874,Lisa,"Kaiser's home is conveniently located to shops, coffee, restaurants, bars, etc...  The house was clean and comfortable.  The floor plan is perfect because guests have the street level floor and Kaiser and his family live upstairs so there was a sense of privacy.  Thank you for a lovely stay, I hope to come again!

"
4694479,31400710,2015-05-04,55652,Crystal,"This truly is the ""Perfect Room"" in the Heart of Ballard. Description and directions were all perfect. Bathrobes and snacks were all perfect. Now, I can't say the bed was perfect because IT WAS BEYOND PERFECT! Truly, we have never slept in anything so comfortable. Better than even the nicest hotel I've stayed in. Kaiser & Heather have really created the perfect, cozy room for those wanting to explore all that Ballard has to offer. "
4694479,31650235,2015-05-08,375055,Marcy,"Kaiser was very attentive from the time I made the reservation. The room was spotlessly clean, as was the bathroom down the hallway. I especially appreciated the hotel-quality bathrobe in the closet - a very welcome touch! You have your own floor for a good amount of privacy. Location is Ballard is great and walkable to everything. An excellent Airbnb experience."
4694479,32042801,2015-05-12,33065808,Sean,Kaiser was very welcoming and made sure we were comfortable the secod we were at his doorstep. The accomdations/amenities were exceptional and the aurrounding area had plenty to do. Highly recommend staying here if you have the chance!
4694479,32217280,2015-05-15,27017638,Andrew,"I have nothing but positive things to say about our stay with Kaiser. The check in/check out process was a breeze, the place was impeccably clean and organized, and Kaiser had tons of great suggestions on things to do while in Seattle. We really enjoyed being able to come and go as we please and having our own bathroom. Oh and the location is absolutely perfect-5 minute walk to everything that Ballard has to offer. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
4694479,32562372,2015-05-19,31762138,Arianna,"The room was exactly as it is described and was very cozy for the days we were there. Kaiser made sure we were comfortable when we got there and as our stay continued, emailing me since we were out of the house a lot of the time. When we did meet, he was very nice and made sure that everything was working for us and that we were enjoying our stay in Seattle, including recommending some places to see since we were house hunting. Would definitely stay again and would recommend staying here!"
4694479,32795064,2015-05-21,20267313,Gilbert,Kai was great! He made my parents feel at home and everything was perfect. Thanks!!
4694479,32985147,2015-05-24,30872596,Tammy,"My hosts made me feel so very welcome! The room is wonderful, the neighborhood is quiet, and and the private bathroom is comfortable (with a GREAT shower to boot!). They had left a welcome basket on the nightstand with goodies, and their check-in instructions were perfect! A seamless experience from beginning to end, and a VERY convenient location - close to everything!"
4694479,33384963,2015-05-27,10717780,Andrew & Michelle,"Kaiser's place was great! It was easy to get to, and the Ballard neighborhood is beautiful. The room was clean and very inviting. It is on the bottom floor, with its own bathroom, so it was very private which was nice after a long day of exploring. We would definitely stay here again! "
4694479,33635866,2015-05-30,10911621,Jordan,"Excellent experience staying with Kaiser. The accommodations were clean and beautiful. Comfortable bed and bathroom. Super easy coordinating with Kaiser and getting checked in. Excellent location in Ballard, walking distance to all of the neighborhoods bars and restaurants, etc. Highly recommend staying here."
4694479,34476074,2015-06-08,33948960,Matt,"This is a very nice room for a stay in Ballard.  I did not meet my hosts, but communication with them via txt and email was great, so everything went smoothly and I felt welcome.  I parked my car near the room and visited friends in Ballard on foot.  The location is really convenient to the shops and amenities of the area, but I was delighted to find on my walk back at night that the neighborhood is quiet and peaceful.  A great stay."
4694479,34813753,2015-06-12,29292407,Kimo,"Great location, nice host, very welcoming room that matched the description.  A good stay."
4694479,35108620,2015-06-15,30868861,Colleen,"Listing description was super accurate. Bedroom and bathroom on the lower floor, you have it completely to yourself. Super close to everything Ballard and we walked everywhere. They leave a really excellent list of must-sees within walking distance which was much appreciated, and they really went out of their way to make our stay special, from bedside snacks and water to personal touches based on why we were in town. They were also really fast to respond to messages when we had questions. Would absolutely recommend!"
4694479,35795428,2015-06-22,31658668,Larry,Enjoyed the experience very much.  The room and bath were exceptionally comfortable and clean.  Appreciated the amenities provided and extra touch.  Location was awesome and convenient for my coming and going.  Looking forward to a visit in the Fall and will check here first hoping this room is available.  Thank you!
4694479,36127872,2015-06-25,33462979,Chris,"We had a great trip, the location was how it was described with great walking access to Coffee, Dinner and the Water. Very clean and plenty of privacy to come and go. Met our hosts briefly very nice, ended coming back 3 nights latter for another night."
4694479,36273810,2015-06-27,4059159,Peter,"Great host. Responsive and bed / bathroom was über clean. Was a tad warm at night without AC the bed was comfortable and TV with numerous channels was great! Also, a great area to bed! Overall would recommend to anyone!!!"
4694479,36996678,2015-07-03,29903932,Marissa,"This listing was exactly what I wanted and needed. Apart from just being in an excellent location, Kaiser's room was incredibly welcoming. A basket with snacks, water, and tips for the area made it even more so! I never met Kaiser in person, but I was truly grateful for the privacy I was granted in his home. I didn't feel like I was renting a space surrounded by others.. It was like I had my own place. A real hotel experience."
4694479,37341949,2015-07-06,3654850,Ariel,"The room was very clean and the bed was super comfortable. The goody basket was quite thoughtful and the bathroom soaps, shampoos and lotions were high quality and smelled nice! The house was very easy to get in and out of. The bed takes up most of the room, but it didn't matter, since we were exploring all day! Fantastic location and neighborhood. The hosts were very easy to communicate with. We were grateful there was a fan we propped on the window, since it was super hot in Seattle this weekend! "
4694479,37565267,2015-07-08,2306298,Nadia,"We had a great night in Kaiser's room. It is very clean and cozy and really neat. Everything you need is there... From shampoo to travel guide:)
Communication was great as well. 
We really liked the neighborhood, too!
I can really recommend this place!!"
4694479,37874457,2015-07-11,7597127,Emily,Easy going hosts and the perfect space for a comfy stay in a fantastic neighborhood. 
4694479,38614186,2015-07-17,31941886,Emily,"We had a great stay in Ballard!  I used to live in Ballard a few years ago, and I loved this neighborhood.  The room was cozy, and everything was super clean.  We had everything we needed, and all the cool coffee shops, Ballard Locks, and breweries/bars were just steps away.  The Ballard Seafood Fest was in full force when we arrived, and we enjoyed some great food and beer!  Downtown Seattle, Greenlake Park, Gasworks Park, and Pike Place Market are also pretty quick drives if you’re planning an extensive tour of the city.  We met Heather very briefly one day, who was extremely nice and helpful.  The only thing I noticed on the amenities list was the availability of a washer/dryer.  When we arrived at the room, there was a packet of information stating these items wouldn’t be available.  It wasn’t a huge deal for us at all, but for someone needing a washer/dryer during their stay it could be confusing.  Also, the front entrance was not entirely private, since we could hear someone going in and out of the residence in the mornings.  I’m not sure if the residence had a back entrance, but just be aware that someone may come in or out at times.  Overall, this was a really great location, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone I knew traveling to the area!"
4694479,39430636,2015-07-23,7226882,Crystal,"Kaiser and Heather were excellent hosts! I highly recommend this stay for anybody visiting the Seattle area. It is in a great location, private, clean and comfortable. Our hosts even brought us breakfast and a birthday card. Very thoughtful! "
4694479,40105453,2015-07-28,5462960,Alan,"This accomodation was very well situated for our purposes in that we could arrive late at night with luggage and walk to the from the ORCA bus - less than a block from stop. 
The small room on first floor was clean as advertised and just down the corridor was a spotlessly clean private bathroom.  Our host provided us with croissants for breakfast one morning which was appreciated.
We also liked the location in general in that it was well located with a grocery store just up the street and the main Ballard commercial district with restaurants, bars, shops etc a short walk away.  
"
4694479,40802198,2015-08-02,23091228,Kuniko,"The listing was accurate, room was clean, and host was easy to reach electronically. They replenished us with water upon request, and the bedside had snacks, while not the Kind bars depicted in the listing. The bedroom door does not lock and you can hear people going in and out of the front door right next to it.  We were too warm to sleep during the hottest days of Seattle in the small room at night, but they provided us with a fan. 
We never got to meet the host who live in the same townhouse, whose visiting family and a small child awoke us early in the morning. They offered us coffee and croissant to make up for it, but I do not have breakfast in bed and already have had a fair share of croissants.
Ballard is a great neighborhood and their location is extremely convenient."
4694479,40927865,2015-08-03,35746901,Andrew,"Kaiser and his family were very welcoming. My wife and I were able to park on the street in front of the place, which was very convenient. Most of the room is taken up by the bed, which made it tricky to get things out of our large suitcases; the room would be better for those with smaller bags. We chose the place based on its proximity to the Ballard Locks, and it was very convenient to be able to walk there."
4694479,43038222,2015-08-17,16913112,Mark,"We really loved this room and the location!  The room and the bathroom were very nice and worked perfectly for the two of us.  Parking can be a little tough but we were never more than 3-4 blocks from the home.  Lots of great shops, food and coffee within walking distance."
4694479,44295559,2015-08-25,35595701,Karin,"My husband and I were very content with the accommodations. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. Kaiser and Heather  knew we were going to be in late from our flight, and kindly gave us a free gift certificate for their favorite morning coffee shop...and where it was located in the note. Heather was very helpful once we had already arrived and gave additional advise and solutions to issues that faced us, first in person, and the rest of the time by texting. We had total privacy. It is nicely located within walking distance to historic Ballard and on the bus routes. Parking is crazy in Seattle, but we found parking spaces within a block every time. We would stay again when we go visit our daughter and son-in-law.   "
4694479,45622941,2015-09-04,41497460,Eric,"This was an ideal place to stay for the first couple of nights we spent in Seattle. The room was very clean and professionally maintained, like you'd expect from a hotel. We were given a nice gift basket and some info about the neighborhood. The bathroom was also spotlessly clean, private, and convenient. We enjoyed being so close to the bars, restaurants and shops in Ballard - the neighborhood was really charming. Nights in the bedroom got a little too hot with the window closed, but after I opened it the temperature evened out pretty well. We appreciated having a clean, well-maintained, and very private location for such an affordable price. Thanks guys!"
4694479,45995690,2015-09-07,28322656,Ashley,"Kaiser and Heather were so thoughtful. I didn't get a chance to meet them, but they made us feel so welcomed by leaving us a gift card to their favorite coffee shop, a basket of snacks, and water bottles. Kasier was very responsive and and made it easy to get our key. We enjoyed having a private bathroom that was very clean. We also thought the location was perfect, walking distance to anywhere in Ballard. 

We highly recommend this place and would love to stay here again when we are in Seattle. "
4694479,46474851,2015-09-11,9767244,Mackenzie,"Our stay with Kaiser and Heather was wonderful! The house is centrally located within Ballard and was very walkable to many bars and restaurants.

We would absolutely stay here again!"
4694479,47723047,2015-09-21,41315499,Kelly,"Kaiser and Heather were absolutely amazing! We arrived Thursday morning and they had no problem with us checking-in early. The accommodations were very well kept. We did have the same entrance, but we didn't have too much contact with them throughout our stay. They were very helpful in offering us things to do in the area. The location was great - within walking distance of numerous shops and restaurants. We would definitely stay with them again!"
4694479,48921040,2015-09-29,9707801,Jennifer,"We adored the neighborhood of Ballard, and Kaiser's room was in a perfect location for walking around the area. The room was so comfortable (that bed was divine), the bathroom was spotless, and we appreciated the snacks, water, and guide to the area our hosts left in the area. The bed takes up most of the room, so it's a bit of a tight fit with luggage and such, but we expected that, and it was not a problem. There is a closet with hangers and we found that storage to be perfect. We wanted a clean, well-kept place to sleep and leave our things while we explored Ballard and the rest of Seattle, and we found it in this room. We would absolutely stay here again!

Thanks, Kaiser and Heather!"
4694479,49721041,2015-10-05,4244955,Stephen,"What a great find! Ballard has a cool community vibe with lots of nice restaurants and bars. The Farmers Market on Sunday was a highlight.   

Kaiser's private room was perfect. Everything about the rental was good but it was the little touches that made all the difference: gift basket filled with snacks, a $10 gift card for the neighbourhood coffee shop and the softest bedsheets on the planet! 
The Townhouse is also perfectly situated on a quiet street just 5 minutes walk from the main hub.  
We rarely heard from the hosts (who live upstairs) and only saw them once so our ground floor bedroom and bathroom felt very private. We will definitely be staying here again."
4694479,50760664,2015-10-14,5621268,Katja,"Everything was perfect. Kaiser and Heather made sure I had all the information I needed before my arrival and also made sure that my late arrival was not a problem. The area is great and I felt safe travelling alone. The room has all I needed and I was welcomed with a personal note, snacks, water. Although we didn't meet in person they checked online with me if I had everything I needed. I would stay here again immediately. Thank you!"
4694479,51516355,2015-10-20,33857198,Jonathan,Fantastic restful place. Clean. Considerate hosts. A very convenient arrangement. Short walk to heart of Ballard.
4694479,52053530,2015-10-26,10284066,William,Great experience - 5 star treatment!  Bed was super comfortable (although it pretty much fills up the entire room).  Listing and pictures are accurate.  
4694479,52663482,2015-10-31,19764744,Tony,"Very nice place. Exceptionally clean. Lots of nice small touches such as a detailed welcome guide and a small basket of snacks and bottled water. Lots of nice cafes, bars and restaurants close by. The room was perfect for me, but might be a little compact for two people with a lot of luggage. Nice area as well."
4694479,53109397,2015-11-05,36007661,Mary,This was a Super Comfortable place.  The Bed was more comfortable than my bed at home. I slept great and really appreciated all the snacks the owners had left for me.  They have thought of everything to make this a perfect place to stay.  It's also very convenient and I walked everywhere I needed to go. 
4694479,53501547,2015-11-09,22824918,Kerry,"I really enjoyed my second stay at Kaiser and Heather's home. For me they offer a perfect combination of a very comfortable, clean and well appointed accommodation located in a safe and walkable neighborhood with the added convenience of nearby coffee shops, market and restaurants in a central Ballard location. I especially like their home's floor plan which has their guest room and bathroom located on the entry level. It offers privacy while allowing me to come and go early morning and late evening without disturbing my hosts. Kaiser was very prompt and complete in his communication with me and I appreciate the thoughtful amenities they provide with robes, snacks and fast Wi-Fi. It is a pleasure to stay here."
4694479,54761831,2015-11-23,16929817,Tyler,"Everything was great. Perfect spot from which to explore Ballard, comfy bed, and thoughtful touches in the room (such as snacks). "
4694479,56082423,2015-12-08,50159236,Pam,"This was our first Airbnb experience. Kaiser really helped demystify the process with his excellent and timely communications with us. He was always friendly and approachable. We were afforded great privacy.
The room was indeed cozy. There were thoughtful touches that let you know you were welcome and appreciated. The snacks and maps were so awesome. This family clearly enjoys making their space warm and inviting to their guests. I could really feel the love that they put into this. All amenities were just as promised in the listing- a very comfortable bed, nice linens. We felt relaxed and safe.
The location was amazing. The Ballard business district was easily accessible by foot yet the home is tucked away on a quiet residential street. Superb coffee is just over a block away. The bus to downtown Seattle was nearby. We felt lucky to have landed in this particular location. 
We had a great stay and all our needs were met. "
4694479,56449227,2015-12-13,33373701,Paula,"Great quiet stay in Ballard. Kaiser and Heather were very thoughtful hosts. I appreciated the snacks and coffee!
Extremely convenient location and uber comfy bed!! Thanks for the escape!"
4694479,56527141,2015-12-14,709349,Aaron,"Kaiser's place was perfect for us. Kaiser was very friendly and thoughtful. We had a holiday party on Ballard ave so the location was great. The bed was comfortable. We would love to stay here again in the future. Thank you, Kaiser! "
555858,1591662,2012-06-29,2731464,Geoff,"Qing Chen listed the apartment and claimed it was available, and then told us it was under renovations after he approved us. I even had a message conversation with him about how many people were staying and if there were anyone else staying at the property. So him claiming renovations after viewing the photos does not scream honesty to me.

He pulled out on me with less than 48 hrs notice, which was careless of him and caused us to have to book on Hot Wire spending $100 more than we had bugeded. 

Be careful of booking with this guy, or better yet, do yourself a favor and book elsewhere. 

This is my first experience using Airbnb and it has not been a good one. I tried to contact Airbnb 24 hour phone line but after the phone rang for ten mints I did not want to wait the full 24 hours for someone to pick up the phone. Airbnb did contact me the following day and refunded me and was very apologetic and offered to assist me to find another place."
555858,1878305,2012-08-03,59994,Roy,"Our stay at the Historical Victorian Garden House at Seattle war great. 
Lena Chen gave us a hearty and warm wellcome. We have been very happy to stay in this deluxe house with its furnishings, kitchen, bathroom and the nice porch,  We also enjoyed our daily brekfast.
Whenever it is possible for us to come to Seattle again, we will book this old house with speacial atmosphere. 
The good bus contection to go to the downtown was quite good."
555858,2155333,2012-08-31,119162,Adele,"This place is very beautiful -  I love old places.  Also the sun that poured into the place was great and it was in a cute neighbourhood. Lena is a very friendly and helpful host.  I'd give it a 3.5/5 if possible actually (I only gave it a 3 as you can't give half stars...).  

Just a few comments -  the place could have been a little cleaner for my high standards of cleanliness.  The bed linen and towels and stuff were all clean... just a bit more fine detail in the bathroom and kitchen would have been good.  Also, the floors seemed to have been repainted in some areas recently and were quite sticky in these areas.  This lead to dust sticking to the floor.  Hopefully they weren't permanently ruined as a result...  

Also, to make this place better they really need to stock the kitchen with a few more essentials - like a good set of knives (there were no cutting knives to speak of - lucky we had some) and a coffee pot for starters."
555858,2904520,2012-11-17,4114339,Christine,"3 friends and I stayed at Qing's house and it was just lovely!  Not only did they leave towels and snacks out for us, but they were also extremely helpful with airport transfer info (advising us which trains to take and such).  Thanks Qing!  "
555858,5553626,2013-07-05,7174500,Grace,The reservation was canceled 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
555858,5897281,2013-07-21,7423166,Gianna,"My stay went well and the house was cozy. I worked most of the day and when I was in the house, it was a great place to retreat. The room/house looked a bit different from the pictures online. The bedroom was arranged differently and the house had a room blocked off. I appreciated the cleanliness of the room and house. I would consider staying here again on my next visit. "
555858,6287973,2013-08-06,1273886,Dzmitry,"We've got a nice apartment with a separate entrance from the back of the house on the main floor. I can't say for the other rooms in this house but our definitely worth staying in. It's calm and safe neighbourhood. Every morning we woke up like in the countryside and enjoyed our breakfast on the open patio in the backyard. 

Also worth mentioning you don't have to to share common space with a host, just with the guests like you. It makes you feel freedom of actions and doesn't constraint you. "
555858,23778707,2014-12-09,20168047,Dale,"I enjoyed my visit. Studio in large house. Private entrance,  Whirlpool (brand) jet-tub in private bath, large shared kitchen, very-firm very-comfortable bed, quiet neighborhood.
"
555858,33729481,2015-05-31,27860043,Christian,I didn't meet Qing nor Lena who is responsible for the appartment (just got the code to the door). The room was nice and the separate entrance is quite handy. Unfortunately there was no duvet cover for the blanket. The bus lines 3 and 4 which stop around the corner and run regularly towards downtown. The yard is a bit messy and finding the door to the property is a bit tricky.
555858,34808491,2015-06-12,1461733,Keith,Qing is a very nice host! The room is quiet and clean. location is really convenient. 
555858,41411253,2015-08-07,7275089,Weston,"Great private room. Bed was very comfortable and big. The room has a toilet/shower but there is no partition/door between that and the main room, which could be an issue for some. There's another bathroom in the main part of the house you can also use. Overall, a great experience."
555858,42934906,2015-08-16,15634786,Lane,"A comfortable, contemporary, and seemingly recently remodeled room that is connected to the kitchen/dining room area of the main house. The entrance is behind the house but should not be confused for the guest house that is also behind the house. The bathroom section of the room is connected to the room without a divider, making bathing, showering, and using the restroom an ""open"" experience if there is more than one guest. It's not far from Capitol Hill where loads of restaurants are found; proved convenient for us. I didn't meet Qing personally but the house manager, Lena was sweet and available to answer our questions. "
555858,48478424,2015-09-26,23542822,Bryan,"Everything was great, just as advertised."
8102349,48045444,2015-09-22,15138194,Jessica,Staying at Jay's West Seattle Crash Pad was fabulous! Jay and his family were wonderful hosts. The room is like a mini apartment. They even had coffee and little snacks for breakfast laid out for us when we got there! The location is amazing. There's plenty of little shops to visit on California. We enjoyed beers at Prost! and treats at Bakery Nouvelle. We will certainly be back again! 
8102349,48260782,2015-09-24,3188406,Rick,"Hosts were away when I arrived, didn't catch up with them after dinner. Helpful via email, phone calls. Smooth check in / out. "
8102349,49156525,2015-10-01,43689904,Adam," Jay and Jenny were excellent hosts! They put a lot of time and care into making the crash pad  feel homey!  If you're looking for a great place to stay in Seattle, you found it!"
8102349,52507032,2015-10-30,26408735,Erin,Jenny and Jay are incredible hosts. So friendly and easy to work with. The house is gorgeous and the basement apartment is super cozy and way more spacious then we had expected. When we arrived we got in easily and they had yummy snacks and coffee waiting for us. Awesome people and awesome home away from home. Can't say enough good things about our experience at the West Seattle Crash Pad. You guys made our move a breeze! I would highly recommend staying here and spending some time in this fantastic neighborhood. 
461234,1451239,2012-06-10,2465763,Mike,"Rented this Guest Apt. for my daughter, her fiance and my 4 month old grandson who visited from Califorina. Diana is just wonderful and made them feel like family. The Browns Guest Apt. is just amazing. The back yard had a very country like feel. I live only a mile away and I want to stay here myself!!! This was a very good experence for both me and my family. I highly recomend it to anyone!"
461234,1488315,2012-06-15,2592419,Margo,I loved my stay at Diane's.  It was my first stay using Air BnB and it inspired me to book another night.  Her place is clean and tidy with a lovely yard to walk out onto in the morning after the paper and a cup of coffee.  Fresh eggs in the refrig was the topping on the cake.  A great place to stay.  Margo
461234,1524060,2012-06-20,1835492,Rosalie,"Great little place to stay with an excellent yard to enjoy while you're there (weather permitting). Loved the chickens & the cats (not allowed in the apartment). Diana is very helpful & accommodating and provides fresh eggs and other breakfast essentials. We did notice a little noise from the bedroom and bathroom, but it didn't get in our way at all. Overall, a lovely place to stay while in Seattle!"
461234,1537574,2012-06-22,1102875,Ali,"Browns House was an amazing retreat for my boyfriend and I! Exactly what we were looking for... cozy and quiet, while still close to town. And fresh eggs from the chickens out back! We have definitely found our go-to Seattle home base and look forward to our next stay!"
461234,1588759,2012-06-29,2402965,Pauline,"Diana's 'caretaker's flat' is a warm and friendly place to stay and a haven from the big city. Diana is a great host and can't do enough for you. There is so much provided at this B&B (including food), that you want for nothing. Getting into the city was easy as pie - walk two blocks to the main bus route which takes you straight into the downtown area - and no problems coming home late either. We loved getting to know Diana and would definitely stay here again if we are ever in Seattle."
461234,1703165,2012-07-14,2316749,Julie,"We really enjoyed staying at Diana's place in Ballard. It was cozy and charming, the bed was very comfortable, and Diana was friendly and thoughtful. We also enjoyed the beautiful flowers in the yard, the family chickens, and the lovely foods Diana provided in the fridge. We would love to stay there again any time."
461234,1736785,2012-07-17,2910656,Bernadette,"This B & B is very private. You have a kitchen, bath and bedroom. It is very clean and the host family is very friendly. 
I plan to stay there again when I visit my son."
461234,1753503,2012-07-20,935427,Bryan,"Diana's apartment is very private. It is attached to a large heritage house and is quite spacious, with a separate bathroom, kitchen and bedroom. The fridge and kitchen were will stocked with organic eggs (her own), bread, milk, cereal, butter, coffee and most  things that you would need for a two-day stay, which is what we had. It was quite central to Ballard and not far from downtown Seattle. We definitely will return for another stay and highly recommend it to others."
461234,1777333,2012-07-23,2596992,Amanda & Patrick,"Diana's sweet little apartment was the perfect getaway for our time in Seattle. She keeps the kitchen well stocked with delicious breakfast goodies, including some of the best eggs we've ever had (fresh from her chickens!). The yard is peaceful and feels private, and Diana is a friendly and generous host. "
461234,1815966,2012-07-27,2985648,Daniel,"Great little place. As others mentioned, the fresh food was a great touch. Newspaper every morning was icing on the cake."
461234,1862651,2012-08-01,2886945,Davida,"Great location. All the yards in the area are full of beautiful flowers, so it's a great place to get out and walk the neighborhood. The check in was momentarily bumpy when the designated door that was supposed to be unlocked wasn't, but everything was resolved in less than 15 minutes. The place is comfortable, has a full kitchen and everything you'd need. Their back yard is lovely and relaxing. The location is not too far from various sites that you might want to visit in Seattle. Overall I would definitely recommend this place. "
461234,1912110,2012-08-07,2357237,Heather,"After several days of staying with friends, Diana's mother-in-law apartment was a great respite. It's is easy to reach by car but far enough from major highways to feel quiet and relaxed. The bed was extremely comfortable and the cozy space was certainly adequate for our needs. We ate breakfast (fresh eggs, milk, juice, coffee, tea, bread, butter, jams, and some fruit were all provided) in the beautiful backyard listening to the song birds and the clucking chickens. The amount of sound that carries from the main house into the guest apartment is about what you'd expect if you've ever lived in an apartment (sometimes a little kitchen conversation or a radio can be heard) -- though never unbearably loud and never at odd hours. Diana and Bill were attentive to our needs without ever being intrusive and we loved the Whittier Heights neighborhood (one of Seattle's finest pizzeria's is a short walk away -- make sure to check out Delancey!). Explain to me again why anyone would prefer to stay in a hotel over a great place like this?"
461234,1957326,2012-08-12,2850968,Rebecca And Todd,"This was our first air b & b experience, and ... It was Fabulous!  Diana has created a wonderfully cozy, and very lovely home for us while we were in Seattle.  We loved the location just outside of the city (a somewhat quick bus ride @ 20+ minutes), or a quick drive if you like.  We spent some time downtown doing the traditional tourist things, and we found it more to our liking to play around in the different neighborhoods after we got our city fix ... Like downtown Ballard a nice little collection of shops/ restaurants, and we Loved our walk around Green Lake (eat at Dukes for some great food if you like), also the Gas works area is spectacular.   We would definitely recommend Diana and her Browns House guest apt.!   The back yard is a great way to relax into the morning or evening, and she stocked the fridge with a lot of goods to keep our taste buds entertained too.  Thank You Diana!  and family!  We had a great time!  "
461234,2062753,2012-08-22,2016787,Joel & Marina,"We arrived at our overnight house at around 3 pm and fell in love with the place. Diana greeted us at the door with a big smile and a warm, friendly greeting. She showed us around the cute, clean mother-in-law suite that we were pleased to call home for the next two nights. She was cute! She was worried that the floor was not clean enough and that everything was not “just right” - it looked perfect to us!
 The property was wonderful and well-manicured! It has several garden areas with mature fruit trees, several sitting areas, grassy lawns, and flower patches everywhere we looked. Everything was perfect! We went to the store for a few light groceries and when we came back, Diana made a point to tell us that she is getting ready to go to the store to get our yogurt, fresh bread etc. We were shocked. The fridge already had a cute little pitcher of orange juice, one of milk, a basket of organic strawberries, oatmeal, three jars of jelly and half a dozen eggs from the chickens tucked in a corner of her gorgeous back yard. We laughed and thanked her for such “over the top” effort, but insisted that she had done too much already and that we needed nothing more. This woman is the epitome of a gracious hostess – a wonderful gal! We sent her off to relax with her husband and kids and we wandered the grounds admiring the property – we love it! Diana and Bill’s place is one of those places that will mess up your trip if you have places to be and things to see outside Seattle. What I mean by this is that if we did not have an itinerary, we probably would have stayed for the rest of the month - that’s how much we enjoyed Diana’s home, her hospitality and her company. She’s one of those hosts that is not intrusive, but is always willing to small-talk “out of towners” – a very gracious, sincere, generous and fun host. 
"
461234,2172293,2012-09-02,2786016,Jen,"What a cute little space. It's definitely got that country-charm, with splashes of vintage and French appeal. The bed is so comfortable, the kitchen is perfect to make eggs that Diana supplies from her own chickens - there was orange juice, coffee, tea, and she would have given more if I hadn't stopped her! 

Diana is respectful of privacy and yet she somehow manages to be there when you need her without being intrusive. Also the location is very central and close to a lot of great neighborhoods in Seattle. Truly the relaxing stay I was looking for. "
461234,2367241,2012-09-21,3618800,Annabeth,"The Brown's Guest House by Diana was such a sweet spot to land at the end of a long day.  The place was set up with care for every detail, immaculately clean and comfortable.  I slept peacefully and awoke to partake of Diana's breakfast provisions: fresh strawberries and organic half-n-half for the french press coffee, which were enjoyed with her own backyard's fresh eggs.   Thank you Diana!  I would recommend this experience to my friends and family.   "
461234,2389811,2012-09-24,2503647,Lindsay,"We could not have been more content and delighted with our stay in Brown's House Guest Apt.  We were visiting Seattle on business, but wanted to be near our niece who lives in Ballard.  The apt. was spotless and comfortable, the bed was great, and the refrigerator stocked with everything we needed and then some.  Diana is a generous person; we have already recommended her place to two friends!"
461234,2463712,2012-10-01,3006224,Stephan,"As my english is not that good i will however try to write some words about the apartment and the hosts.
First of all ""book it""!! You will not find anything better. Very nice family ( we started with a nice and informative talk (no smalltalk!!!) with Diana about nearly a hour) living in a wonderful neighberhood (Ballard is only a 10 - 15 min drive to Pike Place Market). 
The apartment is a you see in the picture, there is nothing ""placed for the picture"", it is a really not small apartment where you can easily stay in more than a week. 
 As a result i will definItely recommend this place to anyone i know traveling to Seattle.
Thanks Diana and family for creating such a nice place to stay, hope to see you again one time. "
461234,2506140,2012-10-04,3548521,Andre,A great place to stay and a wonderful hostess.
461234,2515109,2012-10-05,3635722,Craig,"What a great spot!  Very comfortable.  Beautiful yard.  Great food, organic juice and cream for good coffee, kitchen is well outfitted.  My second stay and not my last.  "
461234,2665521,2012-10-20,3616174,Pandora,"This is a charming and lovely little hideaway spot. The hosts are gracious and welcoming, the accommodations well appointed. A charming little kitchen, a very nice bathroom, a lovely bedroom with a nice, comfy bed. If you are visiting Ballard or ever need a place to stay in that part of the city, this is an absolutely lovely choice."
461234,2738903,2012-10-28,1485826,Andrew,We enjoyed our stay at Browns house.  It is a cozy place with all the comforts of home.  Definitely recommend it.
461234,2839159,2012-11-08,3807718,Maureen,"Diana was sweet, helpful, funny, unobtrusive yet still present.  The guesthouse was clean, quiet, superbly stocked with organic goodies.  The bed was comfy, the shower was hot I can't say a single negative thing.  I will attempt to stay there every time I'm in Seattle!"
461234,2998651,2012-11-30,308807,Nancy,"We had a super nice overnight at Diana's and enjoyed our chat time with her.  We really appreciated her letting us bring our dog and allow the one-night - wish it could have been longer.  Had a wonderful walk in the neighborhood, perfect little kitchen and groceries provided by Diana and for a comfy morning - the Seattle rain didn't matter a bit.  Loved the property - we will for sure stay again when we are in Seattle."
461234,3012247,2012-12-03,344962,Tracy,"Thank you so much for hosting us, Diana. The fresh eggs from her chickens were a treat for breakfast in the morning, as were the fresh fruits! We felt like very much at home and were able to relax on this much needed vacation. "
461234,3284572,2013-01-05,133161,Mindy,"Diana was nice, energetic and helpful. The apartment was clean and replete with goodies! Would stay again, cannot recommend highly enough. "
461234,3374309,2013-01-19,3251257,Laura,"Clean, quiet and comfortable suite... cute and a bit rustic. Diana has chickens in the back yard so fresh eggs were in the offer. Good location close to the shops and restaurants in Ballard. We only stayed one night but Diana was attentive and welcoming. Overall experience was positive and we would recommend the suite to anyone staying in Ballard or Seattle in general."
461234,3443217,2013-01-30,4562070,John & Ruth,Diana is a great host and we liked having the fresh eggs from her chickens for breakfast.
461234,3525860,2013-02-12,4610140,Ronaldo,We greatly enjoyed out stay at the Brown's House...
461234,3835411,2013-03-19,5055543,Marni,"The guest house is pretty and comfortable, scrupulously clean, and has lots of thoughtful 'extras' that make your stay that much nicer. Diana was friendly and welcoming. This is a great choice if you're going to be in Seattle!

FYI - we were traveling with an infant, and you can fit a pack-and-play in the bedroom corner easily if you need to. :)"
461234,3980458,2013-04-01,5278098,Jason & Christie,"We enjoyed our stay so much, arrived to find a quaint cozy garden facing apartment. We hit the local Trader Joes and settled in and made it our home for 3 days. Diana has not missed any detail even little extras just to make sure you have all you need. She was very hospitable & her love for the neighborhood and area is infectious. The only thing I wish I did was to join her in the garden! Can't wait to find a reason to head back to Seattle. "
461234,4064918,2013-04-07,5242766,Rachel,"It was really nice of staying at Diana's apartment. She is so helpful and hospitable. Easily check-in, nice yard, and quiet neighborhood. The apartment is prepared with juice, milk, fruits, toast, coffee&tea, and even fresh eggs! Feel like home! Only 15 mins drive from downtown seattle, no traffic even during the weekend. Overall such a wonderful experience! Will definitely stay here again next time I visit Seattle. "
461234,4192836,2013-04-17,4954980,Janet,"I had a wonderful time at the Browns House Guest Apt in Ballard, and would definitely stay there again!  I'm new to AirBnB, and not a super social traveler, so it was nice that Diana checked in to make sure I had everything I needed, but wasn't otherwise up in my business.  The entrance is private, so I didn't have to worry about troubling my hosts if I stayed out late or woke up early.  **  The fresh eggs and bread were an extra nice touch that helped me keep some of my eating expenses down and helped make sure I got some protein.  (Although I'll have to remember not to run the toaster and the microwave at the same time! Oops!)  Diana included all the usual amenities you'd find at a hotel like soap and shampoo.  And the travel sewing kit in the bathroom vanity came in extra handy when I ripped a hole in my leggings!  ** Ballard is just north of Seattle, and is a nice sanctuary in an otherwise busy city.  The house is very close to the Rapid Ride D line that gets you right downtown, and it's very easy to get to and from the airport via rapid transit.  ** Also, as someone with asthma and allergies, the fact that Diana has a cat in the main house caused absolutely NO problems for me in the guest apartment.  I had a great stay and would wholeheartedly recommend her to other travelers.  I really do hope that I have the opportunity to stay with her again!"
461234,4303064,2013-04-26,3185536,Hannah,"Diana is a warm and enthusiastic host. Right off the bat, she gave us recommendations on places to eat (a pho place around the corner, and Root Table), both of which were delicious. The space is perfect for two people, and I think it says a lot that while we loved  being out and about in Seattle, we also really enjoyed spending time in the apartment too. It is clean, comfortable, and comes with a very generous breakfast as well as various thoughtful amenities. There are tons of great restaurants and shops in Ballard within a 15 minute walk, though for farther away neighborhoods, we found that having a car was ideal. All in all, we couldn't have been happier with our stay!"
461234,4829137,2013-05-28,5307474,Andy,"We had a wonderful experience with Diana and her rental. Everything was exactly as described, beautiful home and neighborhood, we highly recommended. Diana was very easy to work with, thoroughly prepared and attentive to our needs as guests. A delightful experience overall!"
461234,4882668,2013-05-30,3949747,Karen,"Has a lovely stay in Diana's unlawful suite.  

Diana's had her own farm fresh eggs in the fridge and provided morning papers at the door each morning.  The in law suite was co y and comfortable in a quiet Ballard neighborhood.  Directions were good.  

Diane also recommended places to eat and we tried the favorite Root Table for Appy hour and it was delicious, somewhere we will likely return to.

Communication was excellent and friendly. The only thing I missed was a sitting area to read and chat.  There is a small table with 2 chairs in the kitchen and a comfy chair in the bedroom, so perhaps that is not an issuer for most.  

I would certainly recommend Diana's in law suite and really enjoyed exploring Ballard. "
461234,4966219,2013-06-04,6066546,Petra,"Fantastic location, great size of the space, private, clean, perfect.  Would recommend Diana's Air BNB to anyone.  She was wonderful and incredibly helpful."
461234,5033291,2013-06-09,4200450,John,"I really don't want to give them a good rating as others may want to stay there and limit our ability to stay again.  We cannot say enough good about our stay at the Brown's house apartment. Fresh eggs, coffee and bread in the fridge when we arrived were an unexpected treat. Its cute, comfortable, and very clean.  Great spot."
461234,5367854,2013-06-26,653988,R Dan,"I had a wonderful experience at Diana's retreat.  I arrived a bit early and was greeted by Diana who showed me the property and suite.  She is a DELIGHT.  They have a wonderful urban garden with raspberries for the picking and sweet cherry trees with fruit ready to pick and enjoy.  The fully stocked kitchen is just perfect for cooking and making breakfast as Diana provided fresh eggs from her chickens, wonderful bread and fancy local jams for toast as well as other fruits and cereals.  The bedroom has an uber-comfortable bed and a nice window with a view of trees and a private yard.  I enjoyed a nap in the comfortable stuffed chair in the bedroom as well as in the well-worn Adirondack chair in the yard just outside the front door.   The property is well located with easy access to major streets and freeways.  I look forward to visiting Diana’s retreat on my next trip to Seattle."
461234,5447620,2013-07-01,5193421,Elaine,"Diana was a lovely host.  She kindly picked us up from the airport and supplied us with beautiful fresh cherries during our stay.  The apartment was clean on arrival, the bed was comfortable and it had everything we needed.
It was easy to get the bus to downtown.  We liked Ballard very much and would recommend the Sunday morning market.
Would not hesitate to stay here again."
461234,5632874,2013-07-09,2318684,John,"We stayed the first week of July.  The apt. was as pictured as advertised and easy to find.  Diana was there to greet us upon arrival.  The unit was very clean.  The refrigerator was stocked with a variety of items.  Almost forgot to mention the fresh eggs.  Chickens in back are quiet.  Cats are very friendly and were a non issue even for my wife and I  with allergies.  Great location only 15min from downtown.  Short walk to the bus. Would definitely stay again. 


"
461234,5781109,2013-07-16,5553555,Marie,"Our stay at Diana's guest apartment was enjoyable. The apartment was clean with nice touches such as fresh eggs, great bread, coffee, jams, lotion and soaps etc. The apartment has a private entrance with a bedroom, a full kitchen with a cozy table for 2 and a separate bedroom. The yard is a wonderful, private setting to sit and read and receive visits from cute, friendly kitties! Diana has thought of everything and then some. Given the opportunity we would absolutely stay again! Thanks Diana =)"
461234,5841723,2013-07-19,1474558,Peter,"Diana's home in Ballard is a lovely oasis with a private entrance for bnbers and a garden full of flowers. Diana has the kitchenette well stocked with breakfast items including super-local eggs (from the backyard chicken coop)! She kindly took us to a grocery nearby for other provisions . . . The bedroom is fine, with everything you might need, as is the bath.  The house is a block or so from the bus stop to central Seattle. We had a great time and strongly recommend Diana's place."
461234,5999453,2013-07-26,2011213,Cindy And Marshall,"Diana's guest apartment is quaint, clean and cozy. The bed is very comfy and she had fresh eggs, fresh bread, yogurt, milk, coffee, half and half, OJ and 4 different flavors of fresh preserves right in the refrigerator so we could start our day off with breakfast every morning!! This saved us money and reduced stress while we vacationed in Seattle! Thanks Diana! 
No air conditioner in the apartment but thankfully the nights cooled down so we could open the windows. "
461234,6174977,2013-08-02,2739876,BrandonandJessica,"Diana was an excellent host. The place was in a great area, very clean and cozy, we almost could have made Diana's lovely backyard our destination. Seattle is a great city, but I'm sure it's rare to find such an escape, yet easy to get to spot! The breakfast foods in the fridge were an amazing bonus, and chatting with Diana was one of our highlights. We recommended her place to two friends in the area before we even left town. Definitely a great place to stay!
"
461234,6553424,2013-08-17,4365823,Michiko,"My sister and niece who came from Japan stayed Diana's place. She responded to my inquiry immediately and concerned about their arriving; very thoughtful. They loved not only the cosy clean place, but also Diana's warm welcoming personality. I would recommend the place to my family and friends whenever they come to Seattle."
461234,6706286,2013-08-22,186144,Monica,"What a wonderful place to stay! We never met Diana, but her husband hosted us and was easy to talk with.  The backyard, kittens, full kitchen and beautiful decor were some of the highlights.  It was so nice to have fresh eggs from their chickens, juice, yogurt, granola, cereal, etc for breakfast options. 

I don't recommend staying here if you are exploring Seattle for the first time and don't have a car.  I think the public transportation would eat up your time (we looked into this, and decided to rent a car after all).  

I'll be happy to return!"
461234,6842633,2013-08-27,1468398,Paul,"Brown's House was easy to get to and convenient to every place we wanted to go.  Having breakfast there, especially the fresh eggs, was a big plus.  We will always think 'Browns house' when we think of Seattle."
461234,6958748,2013-09-01,7035931,Denise,PROS: Great little place. Nice and quiet. We enjoyed staying there and Diana was extremely gracious even arranging a ride from the airport and going the extra mile for us. Everything spic and span clean and well organized providing thoughtful amenities. CONS: Ballard is quite a distance riding the D Line bus to downtown Seattle (though downtown Ballard is slightly over a mile walk and very nice). Limited television channels. 
461234,7032032,2013-09-04,5363143,Judy,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Brown's House. It was such a treat to have farm fresh eggs every morning, and the local bread and fresh fruit from their fruit trees was a definite plus. 

Diana was a fabulous host, and we will definitely be staying here again when we find ourselves in the area! "
461234,7120410,2013-09-07,5468088,Lara,"Diana's home is very charming. Although it's attached to the house we didn't hear that much from the other side of the door other than the occasional piano playing (which I thought was charming). Although the family uses most of the backyard there is a seating area we used in front of our entry, and a side yard next to this little in-law's apartment that affords privacy for egress and some lovely afternoon sun. It was nice to have a full kitchen and we were really overwhelmed by the trouble Diana went to in stocking the fridge - a lovely and convenient touch complete with eggs from her chicken coop! The walk to downtown Ballard was about 25 minutes, so very manageable, and the neighborhood was residential and nice. Quiet except the schoolyard next door (which I also found charming). If you want to be closer to the main part o Ballard, this might not be for you but we were looking for some quite charm - and it fit the bill perfectly!  "
461234,7271174,2013-09-14,5683182,Nancy,"My husband and I spent a week in Seattle at Diana's guest apartment in Ballard.  We had a great time in Seattle and enjoyed our stay in Diana's apartment.  The area was central to Ballard, Greenwood and an easy bus ride to downtown Seattle.  Apartment was thoughtfully stocked with breakfast food and beverages.  Very clean.  The neighborhood was quiet at night and lovely during the day.  I would highly recommend staying in Diana's apt. for anyone visiting the area.  Bed and pillows comfortable.  Bathroom and shower clean and all in working order.  We used the kitchen every day and found everything we needed supplied; all appliances useful and in working order.  Diana was a kind, thoughtful hostess who was available when we needed her but respected our privacy.  Wonderful apartment and hostess."
461234,7938118,2013-10-08,5415425,Jamie,"Diana's guest house was just what I needed for the weekend.  Quiet, clean, comfortable and stocked with cooking equipment and fresh eggs from the backyard chickens.  Diana was so sweet and made sure I knew she was available if I needed anything.  I highly recommend this place."
461234,8254719,2013-10-22,2599477,Jody,"First, let me say that Diana was a wonderful host! She stocks the fridge with eggs fresh from her own chickens, great bread, yogurt, jams, butter, milk, and orange juice. That's only part of the list. We stopped at a local market to pick up some cinnamon for Jim's oatmeal. It didn't seem like something we should expect our host to supply. Diana caught him in line and took care of all the shopping, finding better cinnamon and refusing to let us pay for anything! Her guest apartment is very comfortable for one or two people. One of my favorite views (I even took a picture) is from the comfy chair in the bedroom looking out into the side yard. It's a lovely place, well equipped and tastefully appointed in a wonderful neighborhood. I hope we get to return soon."
461234,8369589,2013-10-28,8616166,Carolyn,We really enjoyed our stay. Diana made us feel at home and we appreciated all the good quality breakfast foods and drink that she provided!
461234,8723461,2013-11-13,414366,Kelly,Diane was an excellent host. I felt completely at home in her guesthouse and really appreciated all the delicious breakfast supplies she left for me. Bed is comfortable and shower has great water pressure. Thanks Diane! See you next time!
461234,8791328,2013-11-18,3474099,Debbie,"I stayed at Diana's guest apt with a girl friend when we were in town for a girls weekend.  The apartment was lovely. The bed was very comfortable, and I'm often picky with beds. The apartment has a cute kitchen which is well stocked. We were very pleasantly surprised by the amount of food Diana left for us in the fridge. Local coffee, fresh orange juice, fresh eggs from her backyard chickens, toast and yummy jams....it was great! Would definitely stay here again if I am back in the area. Thanks Diana!"
461234,9102259,2013-12-07,461015,Maura,"Wonderful stay in Dianna Dunnells' Cozy guest apartment. The property has everything I needed including the best coffee. She was so kind as to provide, milk, juice and bread.  I will go back again and again. The walking location is great. I felt at home, very secure and cozy"
461234,9241364,2013-12-16,1867597,Elizabeth,"Diana's an exemplary host: Her e-mail correspondence was always friendly, prompt, and thorough, and she and her husband were both very pleasant when I met them in person the morning after I checked in. 

Besides being as charming as pictured (or more so, as Diana has updated a bit since the photos), Browns House was clean, exceedingly well stocked—as others have noted, the backyard eggs and other high-quality breakfast goodies are such a treat!— and I almost wish I'd been in town a bit longer to grab a few more winks in that cozy bed. 

I was traveling solo but think the apartment would accommodate a couple quite comfortably, and I'd look forward to booking with Diana again the next time we're back up in Seattle."
461234,9309071,2013-12-20,10354259,Terry,"Our stay at Diana's guest house was very pleasant. This was exactly what we needed for our trip - centrally located for our needs, quiet and comfortable. Diana was a wonderful host. The kitchen was stocked with breakfast foods including fresh eggs. I would recommend that friends visiting in the Ballard area consider staying here."
461234,9413300,2013-12-27,9894958,Rhodri,"Diana is a fantastic and very approachable host, and her family could not have been more welcoming and kind to us. 

The apartment was clean, well-appointed and (website hidden) is full of charm, with little features that made it feel truly like a home away from home. Diana provided a very well stocked larder with all essentials and many more high quality goodies.

We highly recommend Diana's place to anyone staying in the Seattle area, and would happily return there ourselves in a heartbeat."
461234,9728209,2014-01-06,10936675,Venay,"This is a great place to stay in Seattle. Diana leaves fresh fruit, eggs that she's collected from her hens that morning, jams and a choice of cereals. I usually have a place to stay in Ballard, but will recommend this place to friends and family looking for a place that has easy access to Seattle, and plenty to offer within walking distance: some of the best restaurants, a farmers market and a movie theatre."
461234,9809387,2014-01-11,2006826,Kathleen,"Diana was an amazing host.  Very personable, helpful with recommendations for restaurants as well as knowledge of the surrounding neighborhoods.  I've already told my friends and family that should they visit Seattle they ought to stay here."
461234,9832116,2014-01-13,4798014,Megan,"Diana is an absolutely awesome host - I wish she was my neighbour!  The guest appartment was comfortable and cozy, and the kitchen well supplied with everthing we needed for breakfast. Enjoyed reading the morning paper with excellent coffee.  Look forward to visiting again soon. "
461234,9871419,2014-01-15,11124194,Christopher,"Diana was a friendly host and also a great resource for info about the  Seattle area. Her place was clean and nicely appointed, with a beautiful home and yard. Fresh fruit and eggs from her chickens were a very nice touch that made us feel at home."
461234,9950642,2014-01-21,9849211,Erica,"Diana was a wonderful hostess! She stocked the kitchen with eggs from her own chickens, yogurt, fruit, bread, and jams. I ran into her a couple times and she is so friendly and personable, lending her insights on good neighborhoods in Seattle (we are thinking of moving there). The apartment is very clean and cozy and perfect for our little getaway. It is also in my favorite neighborhood in Seattle, very close to Old Ballard, and within walking distance to some great restaurants (Delancey and The Fat Hen). We definitely enjoyed our stay and would come back again."
461234,10063159,2014-01-28,1149541,Timothy,"Diana's cozy apartment is a perfect getaway accommodation for two. Everything you would need for a long weekend trip is provided. A perfectly comfortable bed, a stocked kitchen, and a large bathroom that can be used by more than one person.

You can tell that Diana takes pride in providing a comfortable and relaxing space. Fresh eggs, from her chickens, are in the fridge when you arrive.  She provides the paper each morning, and is available for any other need you may need for your comfort.

The apartment is located in my favorite neighborhood in Seattle, and is an easy walk or drive to countless Seattle staples of good food, good libations, and great coffee.

We had a truly great experience, and will be returning each time we visit Seattle from this point forward."
461234,10158035,2014-02-03,422885,Marc & Jenni,"We visited Seattle for our anniversary and this place was in a great and quiet neighborhood, close to many sights and great restaurants. The hosts were very nice. We would recommend this place."
461234,10212378,2014-02-06,175874,Dale,"Of the many admirable things Diana's unit has to offer, my favorite was the bird watching!  They keep a wild bird feeder stocked in their lovely back yard, and flocks of Seattle-area birds enjoy visiting it.  Then, much to our delight, in the afternoon the chickens were let out.  Is there anything more fun than watching a group of hens diligently hunting in the grass and winter garden?  Totally charming--as was our hostess, who I wish we had had longer to visit with. (Our trip was work-related and we had too many appointments!)
The unit itself is connected to the main house, with several doors that presumably open when guests are not in residence.  The entry used by guests is in the back yard, past the large kitchen windows of the main house, and very easy to find. The apartment's kitchen looks to the back yard and is very functional, with full-sized stove, mini fridge and a small table with two chairs.  The bedroom sits interior of it and is compact, outfitted with very nice linens and an armchair.  We did not use the TV, but admired its placement.  

The forced air heat source (important in this case as it was well below freezing during our visit) was possible to augment with a space heater as necessary.
This place is a great value, and I'd say very suited to guests who like to see their hosts, feel part of the family and connected.  A really lovely setting!  Many thanks for offering it and welcoming strangers into that beautiful garden. A work of art."
461234,10339856,2014-02-14,11938825,Sid,Diana proved to be an enthusiastic and helpful host. The house was perfect for us and the location was great. See you next time!
461234,10383417,2014-02-17,11039707,Maggie,"A small simple apartment with a full kitchen off the back of a big old house with a big backyard. Good quality breakfast supplies. There were chickens in the back of the yard, which was lovely, and which meant that the eggs were marvelously fresh. 

Sound from the house came through, but most of the time people were quiet, and there was no noise during the night either night.
The bed would be fine for one person, but very wobbly for two."
461234,10980881,2014-03-16,11496826,Kelley,"My friend and I booked Diana's place for a quick getaway and we were super happy. The suite is really cute and Diana provided everything we needed for a great stay, including breakfast foods, tea/coffee and warm hospitality. The bed is comfortable and the location is great. I hope to get back there soon!"

We stayed here for two nights for a mini-break in Seattle. Cute and cozy. Appreciated the abundant breakfast supplies, including great coffee, cereal, fruit, yogurt, juice, bread and fresh eggs from the chickens in the backyard! "
461234,11709922,2014-04-13,1781042,Marty,"Diana, Bill and their six-toed cats provided a comfortable, clean, quiet sanctuary (indoors and out), took unexpected care to stock the apartment with the items I preferred and were great to chat with. Thanks again!"
461234,11983922,2014-04-21,845353,Erika,"Diana was the perfect host!
My husband and I had a great time while visiting. The Browns House is in a beautiful location, the Guest Apartment is very comfortable, the bed is super!  The refrigerator is  well stocked-the eggs from the garden are just fantastic!
We had a good time, Diana is very friendly and very helpful in all matters.
I highly recommend it to anyone!

Thanks Diana!   Erika L."
461234,12185882,2014-04-25,13423921,Rebecca,"Brown's House is a wonderful place to stay... delightfully cozy and welcoming!  My husband and I stayed here for three nights while we were visiting Seattle.  Diana and her husband were the perfect hosts, friendly, helpful, and informative.  They thoughtfully provided all that we needed for delicious gourmet breakfasts each morning, including the freshest and tastiest eggs... produced by their own chickens!  The apartment was charmingly decorated and fully equipped for our stay.  The bed was very comfortable and the windows overlooked an enchanting ""secret garden"".  Our time at Brown's House was a highlight of our visit to Seattle and we would definitely stay here again :)"

461234,12710000,2014-05-09,10930118,Bastian,We stayed at Browns House for a week and had such a great time. Diana and her family gave us such a warm welcome that we felt like we were visiting old friends. If you have the chance to visit Seattle this is the place to stay. You'll love Browns House and you will love Ballard. We'll definitely return! 
461234,13845385,2014-06-06,6808127,Jeanine,Lots of attention to detail with amenities. One of the cleanest airbnb places I've stayed. Loved the local fresh bread and kitchen set up. Very helpful and friendly host.
461234,14389899,2014-06-18,13460417,Van,"Didn't get a chance to meet Diana but we were greeted by who we think is her husband.  He was able to show us around inside and pointed out the provisions.  We felt welcomed to ask questions but we honestly didn't need to because we were well accomodated.  We were able to cook breakfast a couple times with what was in the fridge along with some things we went to get at the local market.  Tip: open one of the windows in the kitchen when cooking.  We triggered the smoke alarm cooking hash browns!!  No biggie, we should have known better.  Also good to know that their smoke alarm was in working order.  The bed was really comfy and both my boyfriend and I didn't have any trouble sleeping through the (website hidden) was available for us to watch the World Cup.  The decor was tasteful and not hard on the eyes.  I enjoyed interacting with her 3 cats and adorable chickens.  The neighborhood was really nice and quiet.  I felt safe during my morning jog around the area.  All in all a great experience and would definately stay here again when ever we get a chance to go back. Thanks so much Diana and family!! :-)"
461234,14769756,2014-06-26,11993187,Deb,"What a great experience staying at Browns House!  It was a perfect location for us... We were able to travel north of Seattle to visit friends for a day, south to Mt. Rainier and easily around the city of Seattle.  The neighborhood is great - lots of stuff within walking distance.  

Diane was a wonderful host - providing a balance of interaction & privacy. The apt was perfect for two of us and we had access to a beautiful backyard. Diane provided fresh eggs from her chickens, coffee, cereal, bread, and other breakfast supplies. The kitchen had plenty of utensils, etc. I would definitely recommend staying here."
461234,15148622,2014-07-03,16340897,Susan,"We has a great time at the Dunnell's.  It was easy access to downtown with the car2go system. The bed was soft and the breakfasts were amazing :)

Thanks again!"
461234,15671828,2014-07-14,344962,Tracy,"This is our second stay as Diana's guests, and we'll continue to come back each time we're in Seattle. The place is clean and cozy, walking distance to our favorite restaurant (Delancey), and just a wonderful neighborhood to be in. Plus, the fresh eggs from Diana's chickens are unbelievably delicious!"
461234,16072205,2014-07-22,2168926,Linda,"We totally enjoyed our stay at Browns House Guest Apt in Ballard.  The bedroom, kitchen/dining area, and bathroom were all attractively furnished and had everything we needed.  The bed was very comfortable! The area was very quiet at night. The apartment was light and airy and it was great to walk outside to the nice lawn and gardens and sit in the sun or enjoy a glass of wine at night.  The fresh eggs from the resident chickens were a bonus and a treat.  Diana was very helpful.  Easy to get get around by bus, car or on foot from that location depending on our destination.  We will definitely stay there on our next trip to visit relatives in Seattle."
461234,16704039,2014-08-01,13488665,Patience,"It was a wonderful experience to stay at the Browns' House Guest Apartment - the hostess, Diana, was incredibly warm and welcoming, the location was perfect, and everything was extremely well-organized and friendly.  We recommend it heartily, and fully intend to come again.  "
461234,16881658,2014-08-04,11850230,Beth,"The Browns House apartment is as perfect and comfortable as it looks in the photos. The decor is soothing and the little kitchenette attached has everything you need (including groceries for breakfast -- bread, fresh eggs, fruit, coffee, or whatever special request you make!). The bathroom is just as nice and fully stocked with sample sizes of toiletries you might have forgotten. Our host did everything she could to make sure we were happy and we were!
Be aware that although the apartment has its own separate entrance, it is attached to the hosts' house and shares the backyard with the house. If you need near-anonymous levels of privacy, this apartment might not be for you."
461234,18720681,2014-08-31,17407840,Tim,"This was a great location for us in Ballard.  We enjoyed meeting Diana and her family and the apartment was just as described.  We loved sitting the beautiful back yard at the end of the day.  Even better, we enjoyed starting the day with breakfast from the fresh eggs left at our door from the chickens kept out back. 

Thanks Diana.
Tim and Cindi"
461234,19019700,2014-09-05,12010632,Clarence,The Brown's House guest apartment was even better than shown in the pictures.  Diana made sure that everything was prepared and ready for our arrival.  Her neighborhood was quiet and we felt safe.  Parking and access to the property was easy with good access to places of interest.
461234,19205232,2014-09-08,19004118,Jared,Diana's place is amazing. I went up to Seattle for a little vacation with my wife and we fell in love with the little apartment. Diana was a great host as well; very friendly and knowledgeable about the area. We would definitely recommend staying here.
461234,19931853,2014-09-21,5235716,Murielle,"This is one of the best places I have ever been since I have been traveling to the USA.
It feels like being at home. Perfect place to work, to rest and to contemplate.
Diana and her husband are extremely nice, and easy to talk to. It feels so good to find some stuff in the fridge after such a long travel. And I would certainly mostly recommend the chicken's eggs !! 
Thank you again Diana. It has been a real pleasure meeting you."
461234,20200140,2014-09-25,5920956,Jennifer,"I had a wonderful stay at the Browns House Guest Apartment in Ballard. The accommodations were exactly as described. The kitchen was perfect, complete with a small refrigerator, full stove, sink, and essential cooking materials. An added bonus was the host, Diana, stocking the fridge with FRESH farm eggs from her chickens, milk, orange juice, bread, jam, and butter. It was a such a joy to make breakfast for myself in the morning. The bathroom was a nice size and included plenty of towels and a convenient hair dryer. The bedroom was a true delight. The bed was so comfy and there was a nice TV in the room to watch the new Fall network shows. I am so glad that I stayed in Ballard. I felt very safe and secure, which was important to me since I was traveling alone. Diane is a wonderful host, very kind, thoughtful, and a great communicator.  I would definitely stay here again. I found the setting so idyllic.
"
461234,20327967,2014-09-28,12240802,Jennifer,"Dianna was great! Helpful with recommendations and generous with breakfast goodies, including fresh eggs from her resident chickens! The apartment is as described, small but well appointed. Has off street parking, which was great. My only complaint was the small freezer in the fridge was not working at the time. The neighborhood was great and very convenient both to Seattle and our family in Shoreline. Lots of great places to eat in the area & convenient to I-5. Would stay here again and recommend to friends & family."
461234,20660833,2014-10-03,21230048,Scott,"Diana's guest unit was a great place to stay while I was in Seattle for work for a week.  She kindly stocked the unit with bread, milk, fruit and other staples, and even fresh eggs.  My stay was uniformly positive - the unit was perfectly clean, the bed was comfortable, the shower water pressure good, and the neighborhood quiet.  The nearest shopping center (Safeway, Walgreens) is walkable but a little far (0.7 mi) but the express bus to downtown was just about a block away.
"
461234,20924483,2014-10-07,1716107,Daniel,"The Browns House rental was wonderful, truly a pleasure to stay there. The yard is welcoming - the adirondak chairs, the chickens, the trees, the garden - all quite lovely. The cottage was well appointed with everything I needed, right down to the coffee filters and jam and eggs. Diana and Co. are warm and friendly and super hospitable - to the Nth degree. You're in good hands staying here. "

A good closet and chest of drawers allowed us to settle in comfortably. The location away from the street and with Diana's wonderful backyard with cats and chickens wandering about completed the very good picture.

The evening we arrived she checked to see what provisions that
she should get for our breakfast.  Of course, she had her own fresh eggs, which were delicious.  The place is very roomy with a full kitchen and bath.  We definitely would stay again."
461234,25011488,2015-01-05,20447485,Will,"This was great space to stay while in Seattle.

I am a light sleeper and I slept like a rock. Diana was kind, accommodating, and welcoming, and the space looked just as lovely as it does in the pictures. It felt like every little detail had been considered, and Diana had even stocked the space with all sorts of lovely breakfast staples, fresh coffee, and eggs from her chickens. I would stay with Diana again in a heartbeat. :) "
461234,27438789,2015-03-04,1415685,Alcoves,"Diana's House Guest Apartment was exactly as described and pictured. It was very comfortable and served as a good jumping off point to explore Seattle.

Two points I really enjoyed about my stay:

1. Diana and her family are very nice folk, very easy going and great to chat with. Diana herself really went out of her way to make me feel comfortable and I enjoyed chatting with her about traveling and the city. One of the nicest hosts I've stayed with!

2. Amenities provided are numerous and of good quality. Diana goes beyond basic amenities and provides you a variety of groceries and bathroom supplies. All were very useful!

The location is very close to a bus line which is a direct route to downtown Seattle. It still takes around 20-30 minutes via bus to get into downtown but getting to the bus stop itself is quite easy by walking. There's a big supermarket (Safeways) around 10 blocks away which is also easily reachable via a good walk.

Definitely enjoyed my stay at Diana's and i heartily recommend staying with her!"

Diana and Bill are kind and generous host and I enjoy chatting with Diana.  I felt safe which is important since I am traveling alone.  All the extras such as the fresh eggs which are delish and bread, yogurt, juice, milk, cereals and coffee and so much more.  The kitchen is so wonderful..  Full kitchen. You will not be disappointed. I felt so comfortable didn't want to leave.  I only use public transportation and the bus is cheap and runs often no need for a rental car at the browns.  The bed and sheets awesome.  Best airbnb experience. See you again real soon .  "
461234,28996347,2015-04-02,28373909,X,"This was my first airbnb.  I thought it was all couch surfing and I'm glad I was wrong.  Diana's place was perfect for me.

461234,29625899,2015-04-10,5310908,Daphne,"Diana is a true professional and made me feel so welcome. From the fresh chicken eggs, spring bouquet to the great bread from the bakery down the street. I was a busy worker gone a lot and next time I just want to stay around to help in the garden. Its is a quiet, comfortable, quaint place, that left me wanting more."

The apartment was cozy and clean, with fresh flowers and a variety of wonderful breakfast foods.  If you haven't made your reservation yet...do so.  Your Seattle experience will be all the richer when you do.

Diana and Bill are gracious hosts, providing more goodies and tips than we expected -- fresh eggs every morning, bakery fresh bread and fruit. Hanging out in the garden under the fruit trees and flowers was a peaceful end to busy days. "
461234,34632888,2015-06-10,22645672,Heather,"Had a great time in Seattle. The home was an oasis in between two busy conferences. Diana was great with ideas of places to eat and things to do.  Highly recommend Dale Chihuly's glass and garden museum. Had a lovely meal at the Skillet. Bed was comfortable and breakfast items were a thoughtful touch. Was able to relax in the garden listening to the happy sounds of the school children on their recess.  Went to Pike Place and the tower, spent a relaxing afternoon at Green Lake.  Will totally recommend this place to others and it will be our first choice should we return to Seattle. "

It's part of her big lovely old home in a beautiful, tree-lined neighborhood, quiet yet close to the routes we needed to take to get downtown and see the sights. We loved having a big back yard just outside the door, and Diana left fresh eggs from her own hens, a loaf of delicious honey wheat bread, plus fruit and coffee: we never had to buy breakfast! Highly recommend this little gem in Seattle! (And don't miss the Chihuly Glass Museum!!)"
461234,37130842,2015-07-05,1576021,Donna,Diana is an amazing host.  So very kind and helpful.  Thanks for the tip on Equal Exchange coffe. My husband and I are truly enjoying our cappacinos on our ride to Astoria!

Nice outdoor area to wind down w/ a glass of wine after a busy day. The apt. is very small but cosy. The neighborhood is great. Good restaurants near by. We loved the salmon bisque and live music at Hatties Hat. Nice view of sunset at Sunset Hill Park. There was a heat wave in Seattle when we arrived and Diana provided us w/ a nice air conditioner to keep our room cool and comfortable during the night.

The kitchen was stocked with fresh eggs, bread, yogurt, etc. that made us feel right at home.  She was also very helpful with recommending places to eat and things to do in the city.  Ballard was a really cool neighborhood and convenient to stay in.  I highly recommend staying here while visiting Seattle!"
461234,39899838,2015-07-27,25755593,Valerie,"Everything was wonderful. Diana stocked the fridge with half-n-half for the coffee kept in the cupboard, fresh brown and blue eggs from her chickens housed on the back of the property, bread, cereal, and orange juice, which was great since we didn't have time to shop for supplies.

The room was great, the bathroom had every amenity you'd find in your own home and the view of the apple and pear trees from the kitchen table were refreshing to see.  

It was easy to find, convenient and simply marvelous."
461234,41274180,2015-08-05,6261311,Paige,"What a wonderful stay! Great host, great space. Kitchen stocked with everything you'd ever need to cook, including some essentials like eggs, milk, coffee, etc. The perfect way to really make a trip truly special. Highly recommended. "
461234,41577754,2015-08-08,4398025,Ann,"We greatly enjoyed our stay in Diana's guest apartment.  She greeted us on arrival and showed us the amenities.  The space included a private bath, small kitchen with breakfast table, small bedroom with lounge chair and plenty of closet space.  Diana stocked the refrigerator with fresh eggs from her chickens, local bread and coffee, jams, butter, fresh fruit, juice and creamer.  We had a delicious breakfast before we headed out to explore Seattle.  
The house was located in a nice Ballard neighborhood close to two bus lines.  We left our car parked in Diana's driveway and took the bus into different Seattle neighborhoods to tour the city on foot.
We felt comfortable sitting in Diana's back yard on the Adirondack chairs just outside our entry door.  She even left the Seattle Times on our doorstep each morning.
Diana was very personable and made helpful suggestions regarding the city and bus system.  We would definitely return to Diana's guest house on future trips to Seattle."
461234,42418102,2015-08-13,31621902,Richelle,"We had a wonderful stay at Diana's guest house last week in Seattle. Diana made us feel very welcomed. Breakfast was given during our stay including fresh eggs in the mornings. We felt very comfortable and if we needed anything, it was taken care of. Thank you!"
461234,43073941,2015-08-17,37315705,Douglas,"Clean, quite and comfortable. Very nice extra touches like a bowl of organic fruit, eggs from the chickens in the yard, local bead and coffee all add to a pleasant stay. "
461234,43971736,2015-08-23,19934874,Marissa,"Since I don't have a spare bedroom (in my Seattle apartment), my parents stayed at Diana's Browns House in Ballard while they were visiting me. It worked out perfectly! They so enjoyed staying there and my mom wrote up this feedback for Diana: ""We are so glad that our daughter found your lovely home. We so enjoyed coming back to your cozy house and our comfy room! Thank you for the fruit and refrigerator items! Coffee was much appreciated too! We hope to come back again in the future!"" "
461234,44561846,2015-08-27,40040703,Margarita,"El apartamento es tal y como se describe en el anuncio: muy acogedor, limpio y tranquilo. El marido de Diana, Bill, muy amablemente nos proporcionó productos frescos y naturales que hicieron nuestras delicias en el desayuno. Disfrutamos mucho nuestra estancia en el jardín/pequeña granja. Es un sitio ideal para descansar después de un ajetreado día de visita a la ciudad y sus alrededores. El barrio también es muy bonito, tranquilo pero perfectamente conectado por bus con el centro y con restaurantes y tiendas cercanas. Lo mejor que podemos decir es que la estancia fue muy agradable y que nos sentimos como en casa. Repetiremos si volvemos a Seattle."
461234,44879945,2015-08-30,5563896,Geert,"Our stay at the chalet was a kind we will never forget. Despite the lack of power and a lot of rain we did not regret our stay for one moment.
Tami is a great host snd did all possible to accomodate us. The chalet is well equiped, spacious and the use of hottub and pool is an extra.
And of top of this all there is a garden full od veggiex and fruits available to the guests. We tried them all and to be honest never tasted fruit better than this."
461234,45565448,2015-09-04,11465630,Marianne,"Diana was helpful and responsive. The location was in good proximity to the old Ballard neighborhood's shops and eateries.  The bed was comfortable and the kitchen was amply equipped. We appreciated the off-street parking. Good value, safe area. Nice city! 
"
461234,46114809,2015-09-08,29404604,Christina,"The Brown's home was  in a great location-Ballard is awesome and such a close drive to Seattle!  As stated, the home is older but has all the necessities-nice bed, tv, kitchen, bathroom, etc.  Dianna and her family were very accommodating for us and we enjoyed our time."
461234,46671064,2015-09-12,43605006,Nick,"Diana was very helpful and a gracious host. When we got there, she greeted us and gave us several tips on different restaurants in the Ballard area. The location is about 15 minutes outside of Downtown Seattle, so commutes were super quick and easy. Will definitely repeat the stay if we end up in the area again."
461234,47347946,2015-09-18,34437864,Geoffrey,the window was cracked and the sash cord broken.  However fine apart from that.
461234,47968115,2015-09-22,37803948,Kirsten,An excellent stay! The place is full of charm and was great for our stay in Seattle. The breakfast food was very much appreciative and delicious. 
461234,48506842,2015-09-27,18070385,Jiaxin,Diana is very welcome and helpful. We love Ballard area. It's very quiet and nice area. Diana house is very beautiful and clean. She offers us organic eggs from the yard. It's the best eggs i ever had. The yolk is orange color. It's so organic and chicken should be very health. I will definitely recommend to other travelers.  
461234,49132432,2015-10-01,1969292,Monique,Our review is like all the others - Diana's guest house was just perfect. Everything was exactly as shown. She was as kind as everyone described. We were lucky enough to enjoy the delicious eggs from her chickens and all the other goodies she stocked the fridge with for us. She responded to all texts immediately and was simply a great host. We loved the little apartment. It was perfect for the two of us and our little one year old daughter (the Pack N Play fit perfectly). We would definitely stay here again and hope to do so in the near future. 
461234,50172078,2015-10-10,40330066,Annie,"Brown's House was exactly what I was hoping for and expecting...a beautiful, charming home-away-from-home that was cozy to snuggle in on a rainy morning, but spacious enough to stretch out in. The cottage looks just as it does in the photos, it was spotless and well stocked with toiletries, bread, coffee, eggs and fruit, and the bed was very comfortable. We never got to meet Diana but found that from the first moment I contacted her to the day we checked out she was prompt and friendly in her communication. (Her sweet kitty acted as a delightful ambassador, greeting us in the garden upon arrival). Check in and check out were both easy and hassle-free. The surrounding neighborhoods of downtown Ballard and Phinny Ridge were both charming destinations in of themselves, and the cottage was ideally located for day-trips to Bellingham, Snoqualamie and Bainbridge Island, as well as an easy in & out of downtown Seattle.  We take a short trip to the Seattle area annually, this was the first time we stayed in an Airbnb and I would not hesitate a moment to stay in the Browns house again next year. "
461234,50760010,2015-10-14,42724991,Jonathan,"Staying here at Browns House was my first experience with Air BNB, and so I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was a wonderful experience.  I'm not sure if all AirBNB locations are like Browns House, but Diana (the hostess) definitely set the bar super high!

Diana was extremely welcoming and thoughtful.  Every morning, she laid out the newspaper at the door.  Also, she gave us fresh bread, great coffee, and eggs from her own chickens.  They were delicious!  In addition, she gave us her cell phone number, and we could call or text her with any requests we had, whether it was for more eggs or if we asked for dining suggestions.  She was very helpful.

Browns House included the bedroom, a full kitchen, and a full bathroom.  It was comfortable, clean, and private, and it was a very relaxing time to be able to sleep in, then make a healthy breakfast, sip some top-notch coffee, and read the paper.  

The location was easy to find, and there was off-street parking in the driveway.  Additionally, the location was fantastic in that it was easy to get to downtown Seattle (about a 15 minute drive), but it was far enough away that traffic and noise were minimal.  Also, there were plenty of fantastic restaurants and shops in the Ballard area (I definitely recommend the Hot Cakes Cakery and the Skillet Diner, both of which are about a 5 minute drive away).  Also in the area are a Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, and other markets if you want to save some money and eat in.

Diana and Browns House made our trip to Seattle perfect.  I would definitely stay there again!"
461234,51265842,2015-10-19,59686,Agnes,"The house is at a very favourable place with good connection to the downtown. It's clean, the bed is very convenient. Diana was very helpful and kind. She even left us eggs, bread, butter, orange juice, etc. In the fridge. And the bonus: when we left, she drove us to the airport to pick up our rental car which was a great thing. Thank you Diana!"
461234,51897233,2015-10-25,6746027,Alex,"Our stay in Ballard was great! Diana was very sweet, and provided us breakfast each morning. Fresh chicken eggs, milk, toast, and jam. The guest house was also lovely."
461234,53072872,2015-11-04,3434694,Corey,"Diana is an amazing host! She really goes above and beyond in making her guests feel comfortable. The space is wonderful, perfectly cozy and private, with a very comfortable bed, and the kitchen is stocked with fresh eggs from her chickens and other delicious breakfast items -- such a nice thing to provide for us. The location in Ballard is great, quiet street but a short walk to the neighborhood's bars and restaurants, and a bus or cab ride into the city proper. Can't say enough good things about our stay!"
461234,54091577,2015-11-16,10330706,Susan,"This guest apartment at the back of the house in a nice Ballard neighborhood is easy to get to, comfortable, and was furnished with everything we needed: a comfortable bed, cozy furnishings, roomy bathroom with shower and a kitchen with all the appliances one could possibly need.  Diana was a very attentive and friendly host, but we still had plenty of privacy.  We were delighted with the fresh eggs and bread for breakfast.  The apartment steps out into her beautiful backyard with old fruit trees.  This was the perfect base for our Ballard centered trip, but it was also easy enough to get in to Seattle or out to Woodinville for some great wine tasting.  "
461234,54728354,2015-11-23,46584695,Jennifer,"Wonderful, welcoming experience. Cozy and convenient. Thank you Diana for a great visit. We loved your place! "
461234,56502066,2015-12-14,27134513,Eric,"We had a great time at the Brown's House. Its located in a quiet part of Ballard, and close to a major bus line that heads through downtown. The unit sits in the back of the house facing the backyard with a small garden and some chickens. Amenities are as described, and we found the space to be comfortable and peaceful. Diana was accommodating throughout our trip, providing breakfast items, including eggs from her chickens, and checking in to answer any questions we had about the city. Overall, the process was easy and really contributed to a great trip.  "
1909058,10052415,2014-01-27,11465617,Brian,"Spacious, nicely appointed, clean, quiet, fast internet, the bed was comfortable, and the private entry was just as described. Everything I could have asked for! Highly recommended."
1909058,10284636,2014-02-10,4871955,Christian,"Excellent stay. Gary came home early to meet me and make sure that check-in went smoothly. The bed room and bath was very clean. It was also very quiet something that made it easy to relax and work. Location is very convenient with easy access to neighborhood cafe, restaurant etc. I had a rent a car and street parking was ample, with access to most locations in Seattle in 10-15 min. Last night i stayed it snowed and the whole neighborhood was so pretty! Loved it. Would definitely stay again. "
1909058,10393105,2014-02-17,4358372,Howard,My stay with Gary and Beth was comfortable! Thanks again Gary! 
1909058,10956969,2014-03-15,11626225,Goof,"I had a great stay in Gary and Beth's house, a warm comfortable room and lots of privacy. I felt very welcome and was well looked after. The house is lovely and situated in a very good part of Seattle, and easy to reach by public transport."
1909058,11076260,2014-03-19,195211,Kristine,"Gary and Beth's home is very convenient to Seattle but in a comfortable neighborhood situation.  I really enjoyed my stay and felt refreshed.  Gary and Beth are wonderful hosts. 

Kristine from Boston"
1909058,11458065,2014-04-03,13419973,Ingrid,"Staying at Gary and Beth's Queen Anne house was perfect for me!  I only wish I had more time to knit with Beth, and talk hiking with both!  The bedroom and bath were clean, comfortable, and homey.  The house was easy to get to, and the neighborhood was quiet and pretty. I especially appreciated having a hot water kettle, so I could make tea.  I would be happy to stay with Gary and Beth again, next time I need to be in Seattle! "
1909058,11845826,2014-04-16,1452223,Amy,"Gary and Beth were very welcoming yet leave it up to the guest as to how much they want to interact. The space is very private; description is accurate regarding separate entrance and that it is indeed totally blocked off from the rest of the house. It was extremely quiet, cozy, and an easy walk to cafes/coffee in Queen Anne or easy bus ride downtown. Wifi connection is fast (thank you!). I would highly recommend staying here! "
1909058,12133000,2014-04-23,4059727,Tracy,"This place was perfect for the two of us! Super convenient by multiple bus lines to major destinations. The room had everything we needed; the private bathroom is a major plus. Gary was super communicative leading up to us arriving and even accommodated our early arrival before the check-in time. Once he showed us around and told us about the small quirks of the place, we were left alone in private bed and bath. I loved the bold colors and comfort of the bed. Definitely we would come back here again next time we're in Seattle!"
1909058,13051252,2014-05-18,3781182,Arthur,"Gary and Beth were ideal hosts! Superb communication right from the get go, and very accommodating of my schedule as it evolved day by day. Always in touch and responsive via text. Gary even brought in a kettle and some tea as I mentioned I liked having a cup of herbal tea in the evenings. Loved the private entryway through the front door of the house - its like you had the whole place to yourself! The suite itself is fantastic! It really is a standalone suite, with a private bathroom (with adorable claw-foot tub with shower) and a bedroom with very comfy bed, window for natural light, small table for work/reading and a storage closet for any goodies you might pick up. Separated from the rest of the house. Lightning fast wifi (yay!) in case you need to do work. Very quiet residential neighborhood with some very minor, infrequent road noise from the occasional car coming past on 10th ave west. A really short drive to downtown Seattle, but peaceful and removed from the insanity of it. Also close driving distance to the Fremont/Ballard neighborhoods! Street parking out in front is hassle free and convenient. Really loved the tiny microhood feel. Within walking distance is an eatery/grocery store called the Icebox that featured amazing breakfast specials (the waffles were wonderful)! In the other direction up on McGraw street is the incomparable Macrina Bakery - a Seattle institution. All in all, thank you to Gary and Beth for an amazing, relaxing and restorative two day weekend in Seattle. Will definitely be staying again in the future!"
1909058,13513257,2014-05-29,509359,Danielle,"Gary and Beth were very accommodating for our first AirBnb stay on our west coast trip! The room was great with its own private bathroom and entrance, and was close by to main attractions. We enjoyed our stay and I would definitely recommend this location to anyone I know staying in Seattle!"
1909058,14560708,2014-06-22,4205197,Cristina And Steve,Hosts explained everything well. This place has character. Good neighborhood. Very (website hidden) two breakfast places and bus. Wi-fi worked well. We enjoyed privacy and quiet. 
1909058,15195151,2014-07-04,17130044,Amanda,"This was the perfect spot to spend three nights. It was safe, comfortable, and right next to one of the best cups of coffee on Queen Anne. I would stay again and recommend to anyone. "
1909058,16198951,2014-07-23,13924821,Michelle,"A fantastic stay! The place is lovely, comfortable and quiet for a good night's rest. Gary and Beth were very welcoming in getting us settled in, and were very communicative and open to help. The house is also about less than a 5 minutes walk from buses going through Queen Anne and downtown, which is great for getting around. The neighbourhood area is very beautiful and also safe, and there are also some neighbourhood cafes and restaurants that serve scrumptious food. I would definitely recommend staying here, and would stay here again if I happened to be in town. Thank you again for letting us stay! :)"
1909058,16412258,2014-07-27,4605497,Noelle,"Gary and Beth were great hosts. You are provided with private access to an entry, bedroom and bath in their home, which are closed off to the rest of the house. The set up made us feel like we had our own mini suite in their quaint home. Gary met us on our first day and explained the set up and house rules to us, then left us to our own devices. He was easily reached by text message for anything we needed. The buses to downtown were very easily accessible from the house, and Gary told us about some great places to eat in the neighborhood nearby. Macrina bakery a few streets over has the best oatmeal! For someone looking for a quiet place to stay in Seattle,  I highly recommend Gary and Beth's home. If we travel to Seattle again we will definitely stay here again. Thank you both for everything! "
1909058,16778062,2014-08-02,10137605,Mike,"My wife and I have wanted to come back to Seattle after doing the STP event for a couple of years. We decided to look for a non tourist location for a few days. It was perfectly described, charming and clean. The easy access to the mass transit right on the street corner nearby made getting around when we weren't on our bikes super easy. The house, our hosts Gary and Beth and the neighborhood were a pleasure to spend our time in. Thank you so much for a relaxing and quiet place."
1909058,17439611,2014-08-12,16147043,Sara,"Adorable space and VERY clean :)
Everything was well explained and any questions we had were easily answered. The neighborhood was nice and quiet, but close enough to get anywhere we needed (and there was  a great coffee shop a few blks away!) We would definitely book here again!"
1909058,18314431,2014-08-25,17225474,Sora,"Gary and Beth are excellent hosts! The private room and bath is a very clean, charming renovated craftsman bungalow suite including a walk in closet with mirror, dresser, and keyless lock entry. The bed is very comfortable and has different pillow options. The room has a mini fridge, recycling, and there is a tiny food market around the corner for those who want to save a bit of money not eating out every meal. With an electric tea kettle and private porch with bench and chair you can enjoy tea in the mornings. 
Gary and Beth are lovely, helpful, personable and respectful hosts. There is no doubt I will stay here again when I'm back in Seattle."
1909058,18547103,2014-08-28,227322,Kathleen,"We had a great time at Gary and Beths place. When we arrived, Gary showed us everything we needed to know about our stay. The security is excellent, with a key pad deadbolt on your own private entrance. It is a separate wing of the house, your own entry, room, bath. If I were traveling alone as a woman, I would feel completely safe staying here. The neighborhood is very safe, but it's nice to know that you are secure. The room was so comfortable, so pleasantly appointed, and very clean. I particularly loved the bathroom colors of green and aqua. Nice Fir wood floors in the bedroom and walk in closet area. The bed had wonderful cotton sheets, and a chenille bed spread. The desk was nice to sit at. The window opened for a wonderful evening breeze.   It has a small, dorm sized refridge so we were able to keep some juice handy. The breakfast at Ice Box, just s short walk ( 1 block) to the South, on the same street, is absolutely not to be missed. And Macrena Bakery, about 4 blocks to the East, we had an organic salad, and wonderful sandwich. We felt no need for cooking in with so many great places to eat. You can eat vegetarian with ease if you like. 
We arrived by train, and took the #1 bus that dropped us within one half block of the location. Whenever we wanted to go somewhere we took the #1. You can completely enjoy the area without a car. Walking in the area is wonderful on all the streets with the old craftsman houses and views of the city and mountains. It's not too far to walk to the main Queen Anne intersection on top of the hill.  So thank you Gary and Beth for such a comfortable, pleasant place to stay. I plan on coming back regularly."
1909058,18878698,2014-09-02,8236945,Margaret,"The location and space were ideal for my Seattle vacation. Gary was very welcoming and helpful.  The bed was comfortable and the space was very clean.  The mini-fridge was a nice touch. Gary even brought me an electric tea kettle, so I could have tea in the morning.  There is much available within a short walk, drive or bus ride - including Molly Moon's ice cream and Trader Joe's. Note Trader Joe's recently moved, and is closer than it once was.  

 I'd definitely stay here again.  "
1909058,19266250,2014-09-09,21103,Nancy,"I had a lovely time staying at Gary and Beth's. It is in a quiet neighborhood, which was just what I was looking for. The accommodations are top notch. The room is private and the bathroom, with an old claw foot tub and pedestal sink, was beautiful. I have never slept better anywhere, which was lucky because I was exhausted after a demanding conference earlier in the week. I know some folks like interaction with their AirBNB hosts but I really liked the privacy. Gary showed me around and then I was on my own.
Be aware the neighborhood is lovely and historic but is somewhat far from the action of downtown Seattle. I love to walk so the 3+ mile walk to downtown was fine. It's a bit closer to the Space Needle. The Uber ride to the airport was surprisingly reasonable. All-in-all a great place in a very nice neighborhood!"
1909058,19586047,2014-09-15,12536797,Chris,"Had a great stay, lovely self-contained unit,excellent facilities,very comfortable quiet area but good shops etc close by and easy cheap transport  to downtown on the street my first ever Airbnb ,recommended x"
1909058,19878215,2014-09-20,18667328,Adam,"Gary and Beth were very accommodating, and their place was very nice. Exactly what we expected based on the listing, and they were gracious hosts. They even have a little tree swing in the front yard! A very fine stay! "
1909058,20202045,2014-09-25,20172134,C,"Gary was very accommodating and helpful.  The bed was very comfortable, I felt right at home.  Convenient location, cafes a block and a half away, and the bus stop is on the corner.  The bus runs frequently and I could be in town in 10 minutes.  Overall a great experience."
1909058,20648942,2014-10-03,19739437,Megan,"Gary and Beth's apartment was wonderful!  The place was clean, quiet and well-kept, with many thoughtful touches--I particularly appreciated the electric tea kettle and the mini-fridge.  The location was great too as it really made you feel like you were part of the Queen Anne neighborhood.  It's also really close to a bus stop, which was a great way to get into downtown Seattle.  On the whole, staying there was more akin to having your own apartment, rather than staying at a traditional bed-and-breakfast, which is great if you value your privacy and prefer a more hands-off approach.  As for Gary and Beth, they were friendly and accommodating.  Both she and Gary were very responsive to text messages.  Gary even refunded me for a whole day when I couldn't make it due to plane issues.  I'd totally stay with them again."
1909058,21288302,2014-10-14,20630722,Mark,"Gary and Beth's house was comfortable and quiet, the two things that any traveler can hope for! I could easily find me way around from their neighborhood. A pleasant experience overall!"
1909058,22545651,2014-11-09,3781182,Arthur,"This is my second time staying with Gary and Beth - my experience this time topped my last (didn't think that would be possible)! Same great private room and bath - this time they even added a little mini fridge (which came in super handy!) Same great queen anne neighborhood, close to fantastic eats (Macrina bakery is only a 2min drive/10 min walk away... a 2 minute stroll down the hill finds you a local commissary/eatery and coffee shops). So close to all the action in downtown Seattle, yet peace and quiet. Sending my heartfelt thanks to Gary and Beth for welcoming me into their home a second time (and my partner for a first time). Looking forward to an opportunity to stay again!"
1909058,25639691,2015-01-21,25645951,Jonathan,I had a great stay in a neat part of Seattle that was a great base for exploring the area.
1909058,26557175,2015-02-15,24135527,Patrick,"I had a great time staying at Gary and Beth's! I had street parking for my car right out in front, and the neighborhood was very nice and quiet. It was just a private room, but since I had my own bathroom, my own entrance, etc, it might as well have been its own apartment. I'd recommend this spot to anyone looking to experience Queen Anne!"
1909058,27780762,2015-03-11,12702974,Dave,"I loved this Air Bnb! Gary waited for me fairly late because I had a late arriving flight. That was super nice. Comfortable bed, big nice bathroom, great neighborhood, and plenty of parking. "

1909058,28612726,2015-03-27,6459952,Ali,"My daughter and I had a great time staying here! She loved the color of the bedroom wall and we both loved the luxury of the clawfoot tub. Parking was ample so we could leave the car behind, hop on the bus, and then explore downtown. The swing in the front yard was an added bonus! Would definitely stay here again. Gary and Beth were friendly hosts but didn't feel overly present. We had a great time!"
1909058,30418671,2015-04-21,30881290,Mary,"This was a great stay, very private and neat. Guests have their own entrance with a bed, bath and mini-fridge. Lots of thoughtful touches including a welcome sheet of info, a selection of toiletries and bottle of mineral water."
1909058,30787912,2015-04-27,29662363,Wes,"Staying with Gary and Beth was a warm and welcoming experience. From the moment they opened the door to their home I knew that I was making the right choice staying with them. The house is absolutely beautiful and so clean, Gary gave us the rundown of where everything is and answered all our questions and concerns. He even let us know about his favourite places to go for coffee or groceries or just a nice restaurant for dinner. People like Gary and Beth are the reason why I chose Airbnb, they have that personal touch that just make you feel at home."
1909058,31444353,2015-05-05,29542730,Martin,"We were very happy with our stay with Gary and Beth. The AirB&B description was very accurate and the neighbourhood is really nice. We were a couple of blocks from our daughter so walked it a number of times. The room itself is very homey and, while older, (ball and claw bath etc.) is impeccably clean and well maintained. Gary met us and gave a complete run down on how everything worked and was arranged. Very friendly. We hope to stay here again, next time we visit."
1909058,31849441,2015-05-10,32459833,Jie,It was amazing trip. Gary and Beth are very nice person. The room was very nice and private. And we like the swing in the yard. It's very nice. Next time I will still choose Gary 's home in Seattle.
1909058,32447161,2015-05-18,25272493,Caroline,"Gary and Beth made me very welcome, showing me how everything worked, and later having me for a meal. My pink room with separate entrance and bath was very comfortable, and Queen Anne is a beautiful suburb with marvellous trees and flowers, very accessible by bus. I was independent but I knew I could call on them if any difficulties arose. A lovely week."
1909058,33098432,2015-05-25,30300030,Rachel,"This was our first time using Airbnb, and Gary and Beth made the experience extremely enjoyable. The room and bathroom were great and exactly as described – private, quiet, and comfortable. There was a lot of amenities and were even kind enough to provide a hair dryer. The location was also convenient, right next to a bus stop that goes straight downtown. Thanks Gary and Beth!"
1909058,33553860,2015-05-29,28777876,Barbara,"What a wonderful place!! My boyfriend and I stayed for three nights at this great home and it was perfect for us. Private entrance, private bathroom and so clean, great!

1909058,35934890,2015-06-23,26429733,James,"We were very happy staying with Gary and Beth. Their home is in a pretty, quiet neighborhood north of downtown Seattle. Beth was there to greet us upon checking in, though unfortunately we didn't get to meet Gary during our stay. The room was well-furnished and we had everything we needed during our stay including toiletries and fresh towels. It was easy to come and go during the day since our room had private access with a door code. I'd definitely recommend staying with Beth and Gary in Seattle!"
1909058,36555346,2015-06-29,2226346,Kenneth,"Gary and Beth's place was perfect for my weekend stay in seattle! The room was clean and comfortable with all the essentials. It was a great bargain compare to a hotel stay. You can't really tell how nice the place is, till you are present physically in it. Getting around the city, not a problem with Uber.
Thanks gary and beth!"
1909058,36996508,2015-07-03,5822176,Alan,"Great place. good location, quiet and personal.  separate entrance and nice accommodation. Gary and Beth did the introductions and then left me to it.

1909058,41734749,2015-08-09,31036959,Man Ngoc,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Pink Palace for 8 nights. We met with Gary the first night to check in, and he went over the room details with us, such as wi-fi, closet, fan, outlet quirks, etc. He was very thorough which we appreciated.

There's a private entrance with key code lock which was very convenient, as we were in and out throughout the week. The room was clean and comfortable, and basic amenities were provided (towels, toothpaste, shampoo, etc.) It was a great stay and we wouldn't hesitate to book again next time we are in Seattle!"
1909058,42436939,2015-08-13,278842,Rebecca,"Really enjoyed Gary and Beth's home. Very nice people.  Made my grandson and very welcome.  Gave us toys to play with, many suggestions for things to do,and where the playground's were. Bus line right in front of the house. Didnt drive my car after we arrived.  If we needed anything we just text Greg and we were accommodated. Nice room. Beautiful neighborhood. Comfortable bed. Would go back."
1909058,43640510,2015-08-21,28564468,Javier,"Just perfect.

We spent a few days in the house and it was everything perfect. We had our own room and bathroom with private entrance, as in a hotel ;-) A great room with a confortable bed and a spacious bathroom with everything you need to be as at home.

Gary and Beth were very very kind. They told us about each important thing about the house and the neighborhood that were very useful. By the way, the farm market in Queen Ane is lovely, as Queen Ane in general, a quiet and well located neighborhood close to downtown.

Undoubtedly, if we returned to Seattle I would stay in this house for sure!
"
1909058,44639130,2015-08-28,3197058,Simon,We had a really great time at Gary and Beth s Place. They put a lot of effort in making us feel at home. Everything was very cozy and clean. There are several places to eat Close by and downtown  is only 20 Minutes by Bus. We would really recommend this Place!
1909058,45928718,2015-09-07,18471412,Gert,"Gary and Beth's lovely craftsman's cottage is situated in a quiet neighbourhood a short bus ride from the Seattle Centre (the no 1 bus, which serves downtown, stops a few yards down the road). We were very warmly welcomed by our hosts, who provided us with lots of great advice for our two-day visit. Access is via a private entrance. Apart from the well-appointed bedroom and lovely vintage bathroom, the space also includes a walk-in closet and entry hall to hang you coats in. Coffee and tea making facilities and a bar fridge were provided. There is a great coffee shop and a charming cafe (which serves breakfast) just down the road. We really enjoyed our stay. Highly recommended! "
1909058,46578179,2015-09-12,33054977,Michael,"I used the app to write a long review and it didn't post...come on Airbnb, fix the app. Generally, positive experience."
1909058,47224608,2015-09-16,979130,Jenny,"This was such a lovely space, and Gary went above and beyond in being an accommodating host!  I highly recommend this spot. I was traveling solo and felt so at home here; Gary and Beth's place was impeccably clean, charming, lovely, had friendly neighbors, and is in a wonderfully walkable location to many needs in the area. I'd choose it again in a heartbeat. Thanks, Gary and Beth!"
1909058,47676860,2015-09-21,27829086,Mark,"Gary and Beth were lovely hosts and the room was just as described. great location for sightseeing, plenty of street parking for my rental car and a nice room with plenty of storage space and a private bathroom.

Gary is a very friendly fellow who met me in the late afternoon to hand over the key code, the wi-fi info and to show me around the place. He also showed me where to walk in the local area for cafes and restaurants and he had a bunch of maps and area guides in the room.

I had a chat with Gary and Beth out on their patio as well and they filled me in on a lot of the local flavor. But they'll also leave you alone if you prefer. I found them quite charming.

I'd certainly recommend this rental for anybody who is looking for more of a local resident experience instead of ll of the hotel hassles."
1909058,48301191,2015-09-25,35100406,Chrissy,"Gary and Beth were incredible hosts! My partner and I stayed in their private room for 4 days/3 nights and found them to be very hospitable. They were extremely accommodating with meeting up to go over the room in detail, which was exactly what they described online. They definitely take pride in their space and it shows. We both really enjoyed our stay here and would definitely come back if we find ourselves in Seattle again."
1909058,49249881,2015-10-02,43783457,Lindsey,Beth made us feel right at home and the pink palace was in a great location.  It was great having a private entrance.

I would recommend them to anyone."
1909058,54713338,2015-11-23,617442,Rahul,Gary and Beth's place is spacious and beautiful and has all the amenities one would require for a short visit. The place is connected by downtown through a direct bus and the stop is less than a minute walk away. Gary and Beth waited for me as I arrived late in night and communicated everything clearly and promptly. The neighborhood is also very safe to walk even at night. Gary suggested a nearby breakfast place which was very good. I had a great stay here and would highly recommend this place.
1909058,55942245,2015-12-07,6460687,Michael,"I had a very nice stay at Gary and Beth's. I felt very welcome: Gary took the time to explain everything when I arrived.
The room was perfect: quiet, comfortable and very well located on Queen Anne. I could walk downtown (±30min) or take public transport or walk to Queen Anne for shops and restaurants. There was plenty of space in the street for parking which was very convenient. 
An overall very good experience."
7710713,47443437,2015-09-18,43715067,Mike,"Host did a nice job explaining check in.  Coffee, tea, and Netflix were all available.  Everything was very clean and comfortable.   A beautiful little apartment in a great neighborhood.  I hope to stay there again the next time I'm in town.  "

7710713,49489932,2015-10-04,4857313,Erik,"The apartment was even better than it looked in the photos - this place was fantastic and the location is very hard to beat. Drea was friendly and responsive in the runup to my visit, and the instructions I received for getting in, using internet, etc. were very clear. There was even some lovely classical music playing upon entry into the unit :-) I highly recommend this place!"
7710713,50111557,2015-10-09,34152006,Jason,"The experience here in Seattle was awesome .  It helped that the place we stayed in hosted by andric and drea was super clean, well styled and very convenient to everything Seattle has to offer.  Recommend this place to anyone and if I'm ever back in town I hope I can stay again.  "

It was a great location minutes away from all the great sites of the downtown Seattle area and very friendly residents. When the fire alarm was beeping we let the Jackson's know and they came right over to take care of it. The only down part is we were not able to stay longer than just the weeknd. "
7710713,50993370,2015-10-16,42047968,Chris,"Drea was very responsive and made my first Airbnb experience a great one! Place was nice and in a good, quiet neighborhood. The upgraded cloth hangers was also a nice touch. I will definitely stay again when in Seattle. It was great quality and value.

P.S. His restaurant recommendation for Japonessa was also spot on!"
7710713,51732316,2015-10-24,26987367,Gian,"Andric and Drea's place is just great. It's in a great location, minutes away from all the great shops and tourist sites. The place itself has everything you need for an extended stay. The bed was very comfortable, and the kitchen had a great gas range. Andric and Drea provided everything we needed to make our stay extremely comfortable. At the end of our weeklong stay, it really felt like home. I would definitely stay here again if I find myself in Seattle in the future. 

P.S. The coffee tree downstairs makes great coffee and awesome breakfast. "
1606171,7780897,2013-10-02,5206958,Sy,"Daisy was an AMAZING host!

I am new to Seattle and I ended up arriving a week earlier than planned. I was scrambling to find a decent place at the last minute and I'm so glad I found Daisy's place! This was my first Airbnb experience, so I was a little concerned about living in a stranger's home, but Daisy made me feel comfortable immediately. 

She's a decaf drinker, but prepared caffeinated coffee for my arrival (so considerate!). And on a rainy/windy Saturday when we both didn't want to leave the house, she shared her pizza with me. She's really friendly and easy to talk to as well, but not intrusive at all. I felt like I was living with one of my girl friends. 

The room is EXACTLY like the photos. Everything was clean and the bed was super comfortable. It was nice to have the TV and Roku. I didn't think I'd use it at first, but I definitely did. 

The neighborhood isn't the nicest neighborhood (never felt unsafe though), but it's very diverse and I found some great food nearby. The pho in Seattle is awesome. I'd recommend Pho Bac. I also found pretty good gyros at Mawadda Cafe on Graham st. Cheap eats! And if you're a sports nut like myself, Rookies is a great sports bar. Definitely go on Wing Wed (also all day happy hour on wed) and get the Garlic Parm wings!

Daisy's house is really close to the airport, which was convenient. I was surprised at how quickly I arrived. Also, street parking is abundant and the building has its own lot, which is where I kept my car. I would recommend having a car if you're going to be in this area.

Being new to this city, I was worried about a lot of things, but Daisy was so warm and friendly and helped put my mind at ease. I definitely got my transition to Seattle off on the right foot. =)"
1606171,7822550,2013-10-04,5191493,Chantell,"The room was clean, cheerful and cozy. Daisy is an excellent host with a great interior design sense."

Host hospitality.
Living here is a good choice.

1606171,8075581,2013-10-14,2180862,Lance,"Daisy is an awesome host. She is very friendly, and she cares a lot about the comfort of your stay. The room is so clean and cozy, with very nice decorations all around, my mom was so impressed about this room when we were chatting on the Internet. I would highly recommend this place, as I would definitely come back for a visit when I have a chance down Seattle again."
1606171,8146774,2013-10-17,3279656,Keri & William,"Daisy was great - she responded promptly even though I messaged her the night before my intended stay and was incredibly cheerful and a pleasure to stay with. The room was thoughtfully decorated, clean, and provided all the amenities I could ask for (VERY comfortable mattress, desk, shelving, closet space, comfy recliner for book readings). Highly recommended!"
1606171,8502326,2013-11-03,9106767,Jerry,"I stayed at Daisy's home for two weeks while starting a new job in Seattle and looking for a permanent apartment.
Daisy's home is warm, welcoming, and comfortable, and she makes you feel right at home.
The place is very clean, has a comfortable bed, and is close to everything you need in the city.
I highly recommend Daisy's home.
"
1606171,8694422,2013-11-12,9320049,Nijmeh,"Daisy was everything and more during my stay. 

1st: this was my first airbnb stay and I was really apprehensive, but from the moment I connected with Daisy I was put at ease, and made the decision to book, and let me mention, I was %150 satisfied.

2nd. I was having surgery, and needed a ride, from and back from my doctors office, and without any hesitation Daisy was attentive. She woke up early made sure I was on time, eased my anxiety, and went above and beyond what I would expect from a stranger. Besides, I was only paying $38 a night for a room. First class service, without first class prices.

3rd: I had to sit up after surgery, Daisy had this pillow that was made for sitting up in bed, I think it's called a seat pillow, which she got ready for me before I got into bed!!! Ok I don't even think first class tucks you into bed!!! Thank you Daisy!!!

4th: Daisy puts her guests first, and naturally! For instance, the night before my departure, Daisy made a point to shower the night before, so I could have full use of the bathroom in the morning. 

5th: Daisy only owed me the space that I rented at $38. Which is ridiculously cheap price for Seattle. She opened her home to me as if it were my own, and went above and beyond the call of duty, and she is truly attentive, compassionate, generous, and very accommodating. 

6th: I will be staying at Daisy's again, and I don't expect her price to remain that low because what she offers is first class service to her guests and I have never paid $38 for 1st class anything! 

Thank you Daisy , 

In appreciation of you and a wonderfully pleasant stay!!!

Nijmeh "
1606171,8849108,2013-11-21,870839,Charles,Daisy is warm and she is super helpful to my requests. I wish i can stay longer. The unit is near to Lake Washington (about 1.5 km away). There is eatery in walking distance.

It felt like a 'home away from home.' and yet, having all the amenities and a hotel would provide, made it easy for me. It was fun trying the ROKU and the luxurious bed...ah, slept like a baby!
Looking forward to return stays soon. Thanks again!"
1606171,9090481,2013-12-06,3278100,Luis Gustavo,"Seattle, one of the cities that I've always wanted to go, since I was probably fourteen years old. And I couldn't have had a better time in Seattle then I had. Daisy was very nice very funny with a lot of good stories and very helpful. And the place with all those little touches made all the difference. Thank you Daisy. "
1606171,9194565,2013-12-12,6616920,Mark,"A great inexpensive place to stay while in Seattle.  The room and apartment are modest in size, but kept immaculately clean.  Daisy has the Airbnb business down to a science.  I felt right at home and will stay there again next time I'm in town.  There's a burger place, amazing organic market and a cool coffee shop on the same block as her place.  Best to have a car to get around.  M  "
1606171,9326955,2013-12-21,292519,Eric,"Daisy's apartment is only 15 minutes' drive from downtown. The bed is really comfortable, fresh towels and soap were provided, it was perfect for a four day long business trip in Seattle. The room was very clean and well organized. There is plenty of street parking. Just around the corner is an organic grocery store and a coffee place within less than 3 minutes' walking distance. I would definitely recommend this room to anyone else looking for a good value when traveling to Seattle!

1606171,9378429,2013-12-24,10734143,Cheryl,"I had a wonderful stay at Daisy's Seward Park cutie!  Clean, quiet, very comfortable bed and I felt at home right away.  I was thrilled to find a natural food market around the corner, stumbled across a great Chinese restaurant, and the park down the street was a bonus.  Daisy is the perfect host, highly recommend to anyone traveling on a budget."

1606171,9533002,2014-01-01,1141922,Toni,"Daisy's place was Super clean and Super comfortable.  It was really amazing how many creature comforts she packed in to that bedroom: The bedding was super lush and comfortable, more than adequate lighting for bedside reading and overall brightness, the individual room heating was also lovely as I do get chilled overnight. There was also a very nice flat screen TV that I enjoyed watching to get a pulse on the local going-ons. PERFECT location in Seward Park- easy access to the lake, the park and quick trip to the highways"

Daisy was very nice and helpful, showing me around the place and helping me come up with dinner for the first night. I just moved to Seattle and had never seen the Colombia City downtown area, which was a short walk away. Daisy lives in an amazing neighborhood. 

Really, I just have nothing at all to complain about. I stayed for two nights while waiting to move into an apartment and it was everything I needed. Thanks! "

I've never felt such satiny-soft bedsheets that weren't actual satin. I almost didn't want to get out of bed most times. She was nice to invite me to play soccer -- it was so random, but I LOVE random. We had a great time :D"
