838764,25294257,2015-01-11,24730709,Oscar,"We very much enjoyed our peaceful, relaxing stay. Wayne was really considerate and provided everything we needed from food/shopping recommendations to extra blankets. He even left the Christmas lights on for us! We could not have asked for a better host and location. It was a beautiful experience in Seattle and I would not hesitate to book with Wayne in the future! Wayne is the best."
838764,25560756,2015-01-19,5230330,Andrea,"What a fabulous weekend!  The house was impeccably kept, quiet, safe, and clean, and a block from beautiful Alki Beach (where you could see both seals and the Space Needle at the same time.)  The house is spacious and nestled in a heritage part of Seattle with actual log houses!  Downtown was a surprisingly quick drive but we found all we needed in this hip and beautiful neighbourhood.
Wayne was a wonderful ambassador for West Seattle, recommending the best place to watch the Seahawks game, get groceries, eat fish and chips, and sip the best coffee.  
We had a fabulous time and plan on making the trip a yearly tradition!"
838764,26144886,2015-02-04,26106176,Heather,"we were welcomed warmly by Wayne and the home was super clean and cozy!  The neighborhood is in prime real estate just off Alki Ave.  This is a highly desirable neighborhood year round.  The house was super cozy and warm.  The bathrooms, bedrooms and kitchen very well appointed and we were given a thorough orientation of the house.  Wayne was very available foe help and questions.  
We loved it there! "
838764,45265097,2015-09-01,23464689,Kerry,"Very nice. Great location, just a  block to the beach, some great restaurants and did I mention the beach?  20 minute drive to downtown. 
The house is clean and well furnished with everything we needed. 
Wayne is a great host, met us at the door for a quick tour, and gave us the keys."
838764,46232503,2015-09-08,43116344,Chris,"Wayne was extremely gracious with my schedule as I could not meet with him to check in until around 6pm. When I met Wayne, he thoroughly went through the house with expected instructions on where things were located, how to check out and how to contact him if I had any issues. The house was immaculate, so I intended on leaving it thew say way I found it. The bed downstairs was so comfortable, I found myself sleeping in longer than I anticipated. I lived in this neighborhood for years, I knew of the house and the neighborhood is why I chose this house. Just steps to Alki beach for some volleyball or a great breakfast and a superb view if what you get with this location. Anyone wanting to see Seattle for all its glory and hospitality look no further. Between the host, the house and location, I highly recommend staying there! Thanks Wayne!"
838764,58541257,2016-01-03,8190362,Silvia,this is the second time we have stayed at Wayne's house and he is just the best host ever.  He is considerate and responds immediately.  
4125779,20325813,2014-09-27,21791390,Sean,"Very welcoming host, nice and neat accommodation and towels and toiletries left out for us.  Great location and we could come and go as we pleased, was really perfect for our stay in Seattle.  
Thanks! "
4125779,20398171,2014-09-28,18365263,Nickie,Nick was very welcoming -let us use the kitchen and shower upstairs.  The space was clean and comfortable and exactly as pictured.  This is a very convenient location to shops and the grocery and to bus downtown.
4125779,20808439,2014-10-05,21848322,Kevin,The reservation was canceled 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4125779,33606313,2015-05-30,33058306,Kathy,"Beautiful renovated Queen Anne home, with large finished basement that could accommodate 3 sleepers.  Lots of privacy in this basement nest.  Bathroom and shower on upper levels.  Family and extended family are warm and friendly without being intrusive.  
Fantastic Queen Anne neighborhood, close to shops, restaurants, coffee houses, and public transportation.  Street parking available without problem. "
4125779,42657928,2015-08-15,30216508,Orr,"Nick is nice and accommodating. The space is great for a stay of a few days. However, the space is not suited for a long stay such as mine. The family's washer and dryer are located within the basement, and they come into the space to do laundry. I was not made aware of this when I booked my stay."
4125779,43737669,2015-08-21,6013938,Tim,Great stay at Nick's home.  Nick and his family welcomed us into his home...which is in a great section of the Queen Anne neighborhood.  The basement is very spacious and exactly as advertised.  Highly recommend.
4125779,44084683,2015-08-23,42137326,Ruth,"Lovely home atmosphere. The space was clean and comfortable; great for those who are looking to check out one of the best neighborhoods, Queen Anne, in Portland."
4125779,44272912,2015-08-24,2793907,David,Clean and roomy space in a terrific neighborhood. Nick responded quickly to my accommodation request and was an excellent host. 
4125779,45033615,2015-08-30,42438013,Elena,住房特别的有爱，房东也很好，打车从派克市场到住家$20，周围也很便利，非常喜欢。
4125779,46815305,2015-09-13,3143678,Jean,"Nick, his wife, and two young girls welcomed us into their shared space. In the basement, there was a creative loft with a foam mattress. It was a cool place to stay on a warm weekend. "
4125779,51259124,2015-10-18,25672385,Jeffrey,"Nick and his family made my cousin, my wife and myself feel very welcome and comfortable with virtually zero heads-up. The basement was cozy with 2 beds, a couch, a television (with direct tv) and a sink. Nick also gave us some great tips on places to eat and visit during our stay in Seattle. "
1455269,6408023,2013-08-11,7861181,Linda,"Yvonne and her husband's place is spacious, quiet and private.  It was perfect for our family, close to downtown by both bus and light-rail transit, and with an eclectic neighborhood close by.  Yvonne went out of her way to make us feel comfortable and welcome; too bad we weren't staying longer to be able to enjoy the suite even more!"
1455269,6441542,2013-08-12,6225520,Jennifer,"Yvonne was very quick to get in touch with us each time we reached out to her and when we got to her place, she made us feel right at home! 

We were a little concerned about finding the right spot, as we were traveling with our 4 year old daughter, but this turned out to be the perfect place.  As soon as we arrived our daughter found the books that belong to Yvonne's grandchildren and she was right at home.   This is a great family spot. 

That being said, this would have been a great place for a romantic get away also, as the yard is private and Yvonne has beautiful flowers and plants everywhere .... My husband and I were able to enjoy a couple of beers together on the porch after our daughter went to bed. 

It is also convenient to both the airport and the city, the perfect in between spot.   The only downside was that I did not book Yvonne' place longer! "
1455269,6476173,2013-08-13,7900484,Gregg,"Yvonne was a great hostess, very communicative and she made sure we had everything we could possibly need. The apartment was clean  and spacious, and the location was also wonderful, tucked up on a hill in a cool neighborhood with plenty of things to do. This was a great experience, and I would definitely stay with Yvonne again."
1455269,6668467,2013-08-20,7255150,Grady,"If you are looking for a quaint, cozy and friendly quiet space to stay in Seattle, this is the place!  Our hosts were gracious and welcoming, the place itself is hidden in trees and gardens, and the accommodations are very homey.  You'll get a full home experience with a kitchen, living space, big screen TV (with a great DVD collection) and even toys for the children!  We enjoyed sitting out in the quiet garden in very sunny weather as well.  Most of all, your hosts are warm and attentive, easily accessible and leave you to enjoy this very wonderful experience.  It's south of the city, but plenty of transportation is available.  There's even grocery shopping and a strip mall about a 3 block walk away.

I lived in Seattle for 15 years, and visited this past week from Alaska.  I felt so at home, it was like I never left.  I highly recommend this rental...I intend to stay again on my next visit.  A special thank you to Yvonne...who proclaims ""I'm a hugger!"", and does give great hugs!!  It's like we've been lifelong friends...

Stay here if you can!  You won't be disappointed...except if you don't climb stairs.  It is on a well kept hillside.  "
1455269,6771554,2013-08-24,8239592,Atsuko,"What a great location to downtown Seattle, 20 minutes to Pike's Market! 

The entrance to the walkway is a charming gate to a private separate entrance to a downstairs two bedroom space.

The space was wonderful and immaculately clean and well appointed, with hardwoods throughout and accented with many decorative pots, it was quite easy to feel at home.

Yvonne was a joy to work with, she really put forth effort to communicate with us and make herself available if we had any questions. 

We really enjoyed our stay and was impressed by Yvonne's place!  With a private entrance, and a functional kitchen Yvonne's place is now our go to airbnb for future Seattle trips!
"
1455269,6822433,2013-08-26,5534884,Seth,"Yvonn'e guest space is ideal for pretty much anyone. There is a very welcoming vibe about Yvonne, the apartment, and especially the garden area. The apartment was clean, well-furnished, comfortable, and exactly what we were looking for. I highly recommend staying here!"
1455269,6902259,2013-08-29,8143553,Kari,"    Peaceful, is a great way to describe this wonderful ""Haven"" in Seattle/ Columbia City that my husband and I stayed at, August 25-27! The hostess, Yvonne, was warm, gracious and kind. Before we arrived, she even asked us if we needed anything from the store.
    The house was bright, clean, spacious and it just felt like home! Nice big kitchen... not that I cooked, because there were so many great little restaurants within walking distance in Columbia City! What a cool town, too! A Historic district with lots of character and charm.
    We enjoyed sitting on the front patio at our ""home"",  sipping our coffee in the morning and wine in the evening, being surrounded by the natural beauty of the flowers, trees and grapevines! Also, a vegetable garden, with beautiful tomatoes!
   It was really nice and private, which was just what we wanted....and much more!  We would highly recommend this wonderful, peaceful haven in Seattle/ Columbia city!
   Thanks again for everything, Yvonne! "
1455269,7075105,2013-09-05,8117158,Pahniti,"It was very nice for my girlfriend Kate and I to stay with Yvonne and Ralph. She kept in touch with us our whole way up from Portland and Seattle, and helped us coordinate our arrival via public transit, which was very helpful since we had been travelling for the past few days. When we arrived, it was close to a tree house paradise with big windows overlooking her garden and foilage. The place was set up very cozily and we felt right at home. Yvonne and Ralph were very accommodating to both of our needs, when we asked if there was firewood, they jumped up and grabbed some for us and even set up the fire for us so we didn't have to bother, which led us to a cozy and romantic evening. Ralph appears to be a master craftsman (he built an awesome fence in a day) and fire builder. The place also has a full kitchen with just about all you need to cook (and drinks to boot!), and we enjoyed a delicious meal with items we purchased from the Pike Place market. Would definitely stay here again, as it really made us feel like we lived in Seattle, at least for a couple days. Their two dogs were also very friendly."
1455269,7230377,2013-09-11,8558740,Antoinette,"Yvonne and Ralph's space is lovely. Yvonne is an excellent communicator and made this trip a breeze. She truly does have a beautiful garden space. Our family felt safe and cozy in this apartment. Beds were comfortable with plenty of blankets. Cable, TV and WiFi worked perfectly. Street parking was no problem.  Kitchen was well stocked to cook our meals. We traveled with young children who found all the games and books very inviting. We absolutely recommend this space to everyone.  "
1455269,8395795,2013-10-28,9576307,Lena,"Yvonne's home was too perfect. We are from Portland and came up for a music festival and found her place to be in a great location, super inviting and stocked with everything we needed! I would highly recommend this to anyone traveling in the Seattle area, we will definitely be back! Beautiful home and garden, simply a joy to stay there! "
1455269,8549711,2013-11-04,9677016,Negarra,"My experience at Yvonne's lovely home was absolutely amazing. Her home is in the very pleasant and quiet Columbia City neighborhood in Seattle. I felt as if I had my own home away from home. Yvonne has gone out of her way to make guests feel welcome and comfortable. She welcomed me upon my arrival and bid me farewell on the day of my departure.

It is between 10 and 15 minute walk from the main drag where there are great restaurants and shops. It is serviced by the light rail immediately to the west and 2 major bus lines just one block east. I felt safe and at ease throughout my entire trip.

I highly recommend Yvonne's home. She is the consummate hostess and she oozes hospitality. And the coffee she has in the apartment is just what one needs in the mornings!"
1455269,8753173,2013-11-16,9318028,Karna,"  We felt so cared for in this warm and welcoming space. Yvonne considered everything in advance, from wonderful bedding, menus on hand for local restaurants, a stocked kitchen and even individual toiletries, everything was perfect. 
  Our group consisted of a Mom & 2 teenage boys. We had plenty of room and having the extra TV in the bedroom was a great touch. After a long day of sightseeing we ate the most delicious pizza (about 5 minutes away) and warmed ourselves in front of the fire,(thanks for setting that up) played some games, used the wi-fi, took a nice hot shower and got a very solid nights sleep. 
  I would stay here again and again. The cost is very fair, the neighborhood is safe with a lot to do and the accommodations were terrific.  I'd like to see it in height of gardening season.- I ate a few of your grapes,Yum !!   Thanks Yvonne, well done  :)"
1455269,8797435,2013-11-18,9139984,Judith,"Yvonne is a great host. She communicates really well and she made sure we had everything we needed.
She was there to greet me when I arrived and explained everything to me.
She also was very helpful recommending places to go and things to do.
Her place is very nice, comfy and has many amenities.
I will recommend Yvonne to everybody."
1455269,9095587,2013-12-06,3404314,Cindy,"We are still enjoying Yvonne and Ralph's wonderful hospitality--we are staying on for another two+ weeks! The apartment is more than we expected--private, a great view, and every convenience you can imagine. The kitchen is stocked with myriad pots and pans, kitchen gadgets, appliances. The comfortable living room is stocked with a wide range of interesting films. The bedroom has a lovely spacious desk, television/DVD player, comfy bed. Yvonne and Ralph are so accommodating! Although there is a butcher block counter with bar stools for eating in the kitchen, they brought in a dining table for our use. Finally, there is very, very easy access to downtown Seattle via light rail or bus, and the apartment is a short walk to a grocery store and the shops and restaurants of charming downtown Columbia City. What more could a person want?!"
1455269,9343372,2013-12-23,3404314,Cindy,"My husband and I stayed at Yvonne and Ralph's apartment for three weeks while we were visiting our new grandchild in Seattle. Our experience could not have been better! The apartment is very comfortable and well-equipped, with everything we needed to be self-sufficient during our visit--including a washer and dryer. The second bedroom accommodated other family members who came to Seattle to welcome the new baby. We were car-free during our stay. The apartment is in our favorite Seattle neighborhood, with easy access by light rail and bus to other parts of Seattle. We enjoyed walking to Geraldine's and Columbia City Bakery on Rainier Blvd. Columbia City and to Mio Posto and Relish in Mount Baker. Yvonne and Ralph did everything possible to make us comfortable. They were available and responsive when we had a question or need, but did not intrude at all. Their apartment will be our first choice on subsequent visits to Seattle."
1455269,9510495,2013-12-31,10264235,Serena,"Yvonne was a very caring host to a great property. She was very attentive to us and made us feel welcomed. Her property was well cared for and very spacious. 

Thank you for sharing your space with us, Yvonne!!"
1455269,9617717,2014-01-03,7777411,Patrick,"We were four students on a road trip through the US and stayed at Yvonne’s house for two nights. The apartment was really nice, very clean, a lot of space and everything we needed. Yvonne gave us a very warm welcome, I actually never had such a nice welcome at any place we stayed before, she answered all our questions and gave us some good advices. The nearest bus station is 5 minutes away, I highly recommend it ;)"
1455269,9730829,2014-01-06,10989107,Scott,The amenities were very comfortable.  Yvonne was a very gracious hostess and took care it the extra little details that made out stay memorable.  I would definitely recommend her space for an over-night stay or longer.  Very comfortable and easy living.  
1455269,9841221,2014-01-13,4961525,Laura,"Yvonne's place was perfect for our weekend visit!    Close to downtown Seattle, easy access to Century Link Field for the Seahawks game.  We loved the space, especially the fireplace.  The weather was terrible, but Yvonne had a fire all ready to go, just light and enjoy!  Thanks Yvonne!"
1455269,9960055,2014-01-21,11043110,Nathaniel,Yvonne was an incredibly kind and gracious host. Her apartment is really beautiful and in a nice quiet neighborhood. Yvonne did everything possible to make the stay exceptional for guests. I would highly recommend staying here. 
1455269,10121610,2014-02-01,6502427,John,Yvonne's place was such an amazing place to enjoy on my business trip. She is incredibly sweet and presented such a warm reception for me. She was attentive to my needs to the point that I felt as though I was visiting a friend. Her place is such a value and I would recommend to anyone that they stay with her. I chose her place because of the accommodations but was not prepared for the luxury that she provided. The place was so inviting and warm. I look forward to staying with Yvonne again. I recommend you do the same.
1455269,10247248,2014-02-09,3404314,Cindy,"This was our third stay with Yvonne and Ralph--their apartment is our number one choice for visits to Seattle. Yvonne and Ralph are a pleasure to stay with--Yvonne is extremely accommodating, warm, with a delightful sense of humor. Ralph left us bakery treats--a loaf of French bread one morning, and a blueberry loaf on another. I have described the apartment's numerous amenities and great location in previous reviews. But I have new appreciations with every stay. For example, a drawer full of spices in the kitchen; a selection of excellent children's books; a huge library of DVDs; an assortment of games for all ages. Seattle was experiencing a cold snap during this recent stay and we felt warm and cozy under our extra quilt and the well-heated rooms, each with its own thermostat. We always look forward our stays--and are especially looking forward to returning to Yvonne and Ralph's this spring, when the beautiful garden will be in full bloom!"
1455269,10418892,2014-02-18,1613924,Claudia,"Yvonne and Ralph were very welcoming, and genuinely excited to see us when we arrived. She gave us a tour and let us know we were able to use anything. Through out our stay she even offered to let us borrow new movies she had purchased! Yvonne was literally a phone call/text away and got back to us quickly. It was a very enjoyable and comfortable stay; and if we visit Seattle again this is definitely the place I would like to stay at :)"
1455269,10696432,2014-03-03,2049764,Heather,"Yvonne's place was a perfect space for our family trip to Seattle. It was so nice having the second bedroom for our daughter and the kitchen was perfect for making meals. We also enjoyed the upgraded queen size bed in one of the bedrooms and loved all the books and games to keep our family busy. The cute neighborhood of Columbia City is an easy walk from the home. The sidewalk/entrance to the home is up a set of stairs, but wasn't an issue for us and Yvonne was more than willing to help us with our belongings. Yvonne is a wonderful host and ensured we had everything we needed for a comfortable visit. Thank you for opening up your home. "
1455269,10753268,2014-03-05,4087772,Christopher,"Yvonne and her husband Ralph were awesome. Their place was very clean, comfortable, and spacious.  Yvonne was very helpful when it came to learning about Seattle and the surrounding areas. If a journey of a thousand miles truly begin with one step, our 2635 mile journey from Atlanta to Seattle had one amazing first step with Yvonne and Ralph's lovely home."
1455269,10863103,2014-03-10,12683720,Norah,"Me and my friends really enjoyed our one night stay at Yvonne's place. She was a wonderful host who made sure we were taken care of. Her place has a very homey feel to it; beds are very comfortable and house gets warm very fast. 
Thanks Yvonne!"
1455269,11336737,2014-03-30,13424100,Angela,"Yvonne and Ralph are very thoughtful hosts and truly thought of everything to make their guests feel at home!  Our family trip included our two small children and I can honestly say that the accommodations made the trip.  The second bedroom allowed us to put the kids down for the night, kick back with a bottle of wine by the wood burning fireplace and enjoy the evening.  Our next hotel stay will pale in comparison!   When booking the property, I hadn't realized how close we were to the attractions we planned on visiting and that was a welcome surprise.  "
1455269,11355006,2014-03-31,12247463,Sara,"3 friends and I came up to Seattle for the weekend and were thrilled when we arrived at Yvonne's. It's super cute, very comfortable and Yvonne was very warm and friendly when she came to give us a quick tour. 

The house has everything you could need, from kitchen amenities to washer and dryer. The bedrooms are very cute and the beds are really comfy! We literally could not have asked for more. We'll all be recommending this to friends that are heading to Seattle in the future."
1455269,11574622,2014-04-07,2304128,Serena,"We come into the city often to relax, have dinner, and visit family. We use airbnb often. This has been the jewel we've searched for! An oasis near the heart of the city! We booked one night and ended staying two! It's like a home away from home. Yvonne was the most gracious host we have experienced. The house is a hidden gem. If you understand that the neighborhood is very diverse and it is a city, then you know to be close to downtown, traffic can heavy down the hill from this location. Being uphill, helps eliminate the noise and foot traffic in the area. There's stairs to this location to the entrance but nothing a healthy individual couldn't endure. We look forward to our next stay and would highly recommend this location for a comfy stay near downtown Seattle."
1455269,11702887,2014-04-12,6753568,Lingyan,Yvonne is super nice and always willing to help. She maintains an excellent guide book listing things to do in Seattle for the guests. She's open to all the ideas from the guests so I'm sure it will get even better the time you visit. 
1455269,11958593,2014-04-20,12721485,Aaron,"Very workable, pleasant stay.  House was perfectly clean and thoughtfully stocked with snacks.  Rooms were on the small side but comfortable, safe, and overall great.  Best for travelers who will be out of the house during the daytime or who don't mind some daytime noise (owners and pets live on site)."
1455269,12585740,2014-05-05,2675286,Andrea,"Yvonne was the most charming and delightful host. The apartment was as described, very spacious and clean. We had a short but very pleasant stay. Will definitely try to stay at Yvonne's again the next time we are in Seattle! :)"
1455269,12921537,2014-05-14,6326174,Linda,"This was such a lovely space - the apartment is clean and clutter-free but tastefully decorated. The front garden is lush and private and is a wonderful place to enjoy morning coffee or evening libations. Yvonne is a delight and has perfected the art of balancing warm helpfulness with a respect for privacy. The neighborhood was easy to navigate and both bus and train transportation are within reasonable walking distance. There is a bit of sound transfer through the floorboards as the apartment sits beneath their home, so light sleepers may want to pack earplugs...but the space really lives up to its name of ""peaceful"" Seattle."
1455269,13137522,2014-05-20,1628852,Robert,"We had a great stay with Yvonne. She was so very accomodating, and although we didn't prepare meals while there, she had the best stocked kitchen I have seen in my airbnb travels. Lots of snacks, too  Everything was very clean. Close to downtown Seattle. Yvonne was also very easy to communicate with. "
1455269,13342259,2014-05-26,12430567,Cecelia,"We had an amazing stay with Yvonne.   She is an excellent host.   The apartment was well furnished,  very clean and truly inviting.  The yard is filled with beautiful plants.   Very peaceful.  Movies galore.   We shall return.   Thank you for making our time in Seattle great.

Cecelia"
1455269,13952794,2014-06-09,13617055,Othman,"We enjoyed our stay with Yvonne. My wife attended a conference in downtown Seattle, it was short trip, less than 15 minutes by car. My kids (three daughters) love the space and the front yard. Yvonne is a great host and lovely women. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed and more. This was my first time to use Airbnb and I'm very happy with the experience. I don't think I go to hotels anymore and whenever I'm in Seattle I'll stay with Yvonne for sure. "
1455269,14100761,2014-06-11,9831691,Zilda,"I don't even know where to start. We had a wonderful stay with Yvonne. It was my first time using airbnb. I wanted to make sure that I had a good connection with my host. Yvonne was the best. I started with inquiring and got a response from her almost immediately. From there it was very smooth booking.
 
I traveled to Seattle with my husband, two kids, and my parents. The apartment was big enough and comfortable to accommodate all of us. We were getting there later than I was planning, so I asked Yvonne if she could get the sofa bed ready for the boys. Sure enough, when we got there everything was perfectly set for our stay. A clean place is a most for me and the place was really clean. I felt very comfortable there. And the location is very close to downtown Seattle. 

The extras: the living room was set with games, books and tv. The boys had a blast just playing games and doing puzzles. The kitchen was full of supplies from coffee, chips, healthy snacks, and even bottled water was available in the refrigerator. The super clean bathroom had small individual shampoo, conditioner, lotion and more. They had enough nice towels set for the whole family.
 
If we didn't feel that we had enough, that wouldn't have been a problem either because Yvonne is so nice that I know she would have made it available. She even offered to go buy sprite for my mother when she heard my mother was not feeling well. She was there to receive and greet us. Showed us the place around, but then also respected our space and privacy. She is very open and honest. I had a wonderful first time experience and could not say enough about the place and the host. I already miss the peaceful escape!

1455269,16204195,2014-07-23,2885504,Laurence,"My husband and I had a wonderful time at Yvonne's. She was very welcoming and made us feel at home. The apartment was comfortable, clean, spacious, well furnished. It was everything we where hoping for... and even more! Would recommend to anyone! Thank you again Yvonne. "
1455269,16349457,2014-07-26,15637546,Jeanene,"Yvonne was great about communicating before we booked and after we arrived. She was out of town during our stay, but called us to be sure that we settled in well. Yvonne's husband Ralph also assisted with questions and called to check on us. (With so many wonderful comments about Yvonne, I was a little sad that we missed the opportunity to meet her!)

The apartment is as everyone has described - very clean, nicely decorated and cozy. It was a perfect spot for my husband and I and another couple to share. I can see how it would work perfectly for a family with children too. We did not utilize the kitchen during our stay, but it was well stocked. The beds were very comfortable.

The garden space was beautiful and we enjoyed the fragrant lilies every time we came and went. 

The Columbia City area was great. We felt near everything we wanted to see and enjoyed the neighborhood. Columbia City Bakery was a highlight of the area! Wow! Amazing pastries!"
1455269,16607912,2014-07-30,15197900,Sam,"This place was fantastic!! Yvonne was extremely helpful and like an old friend.  I would look forward to coming back to Seattle just to stay here again.
Thank You
Sam Thomson and Family"
1455269,17091433,2014-08-07,13686022,Vicki,"Thoroughly recommended!!! Yvonne can not do enough for you. The home was complete with everything you need (plus more!). Nice neighbourhood, close to amenities and just a short walk to the station to get you downtown. Would definitely stay again if I was to return to Seattle. Thanks Yvonne!"
1455269,17683616,2014-08-16,422544,Lisa,"I recently stayed at Yvonne's place with my family. Our group of six included a senior as well as a three year old. Yvonne's place was perfect for the entire group, both young and old. The house was spacious, clean and comfortable. Yvonne went the extra mile to make our stay feel like home. We especially appreciated the little snacks left for us in the kitchen and the full selection of DVDs and games. The house is centrally located and a quick walk to the light rail station. We would definitely recommend and stay again!"
1455269,18875521,2014-09-02,2592464,Dustin,"The space was slick, with comfy beds and a good shower. There were various snacks in the kitchen that came in handy, and we were able to come and go as we pleased. Good location to get downtown, too; the train was only a 15 minute walk away.

Yvonne was friendly and professional. She even mailed us a t-shirt we left in the home, free of charge."
1455269,19188137,2014-09-08,13154458,Joyce,"Yvonne was waiting for us when we arrived she made us feel like we were visiting a good friend. Both Yvonne and Ralph made us feel so welcome it was a really great staying there, they had everything we needed and things we didn't even know we would need. Everything was so homey and so clean it was so nice too come back to after a long day of site seeing. We had our two adult children with us and we all had our own space which was so nice. We highly recommend staying with Yvonne and Ralph they were wonderful. This was our first time using Airbnb and we are so glad we did it was so much better than a hotel."
1455269,20085530,2014-09-23,179481,Enrico,"My sons and I had a very nice stay at Yvonne's place.  She meet us at the house and made sure that we were all situated. She even offered me a fresh tomato from her garden. The place is a little secluded and very quite.
Thank you Yvonne!!
 "
1455269,21192530,2014-10-13,14478473,Bridget,"Yvonne's home was warm and charming.  She greeted us upon arrival and showed us around the house.  Everything we could possibly need was provided.   We took the light rail from the airport to the Columbia City stop.  It was a 20 minute walk from there.  We also used the light rail to get to Pioneer Square, Pike's Market, and the Space Needle.  All about 20 minutes away.  It is a great location."
1455269,21653207,2014-10-21,18227782,Ashley,Very clean and convenient to downtown! Yvonne's provides a comfortable and well-stocked apartment in a quiet neighborhood. Parking is convenient and she's very helpful if you need anything during your stay. She had a pack n' play in the apartment that my 10 month old slept in and it looked brand new. Definitely felt like a home away from home! Thanks Yvonne. 
1455269,22363259,2014-11-04,21569826,Sandy,"Our stay at Yvonne & Ralph's place was ""perfect""!!  It felt as if we were in our own home.  The location couldn't have been better to the wedding venue we were attending! With rainy weather (typical in October) the home was clean, warm, cozy and relaxing. We were able to cook in and embrace the comforts on our last evening in Seattle. The views into the garden and the privacy it provided was amazing!  This was our first experience with airbnb and we were very fortunate to have fallen into a wonderful experience!! 
Everything you would need was there, from a well-stocked kitchen to books and movies!
Thank you Yvonne for being part of such a great reunion with family!!"
1455269,27406352,2015-03-03,26894873,Cian,"Couldn't recommend Yvonne and Ralph highly enough. They went the extra mile in catering for us, the accommodation was really lovely; private, clean, excellently furnished and lots of charm (and the little extra's were highly appreciated!!). 
If you're looking for somewhere in the area I'd highly recommend contacting Yvonne. Thanks a mil guys"
1455269,28253072,2015-03-21,2190408,Lesley,"Yvonne is lovely, caring and considerate. Thank you, Yvonne, for opening your home to us."
1455269,28435901,2015-03-23,29251558,John,Yvonne was very warm and welcoming. The apartment was perfect! My 18 year old daughter had her own private sleeping area. My girlfriend's three little girls shared one room. My girlfriend and i took the other room. There was still even more sleeping room if it were needed (hideabed in living room). It was nice having a large place to stay to provide room for different aged girls (and frazzled parents). The neighborhood seems like a good area and we felt safe leaving our car on the street.
1455269,28604057,2015-03-27,9862370,Catherine,The moment I stepped into Yvonne's garden apartment I felt at home. A quiet space with private bedrooms. There are quite a few stairs but I think they are worth the climb. Parking was not a problem at all which took a lot of stress off of me at the end of the day. Great restaurants like TuttaBellas are a 5 minute drive. Thank you for sharing your space with my family!
1455269,28801283,2015-03-30,23858878,David,"Very nice accommodation with heaps of instructions for seeing the city, reaching the place and transportation. Beds were comfy and the place was really comfortable and nice"
1455269,29104622,2015-04-04,26563184,Deborah,"We had a wonderful stay and felt right at home.  The place was very well stocked, including welcoming snacks, loads of movies, and games.  The beds were cozy and comfortable.  We would definitely stay here again. "
1455269,29321554,2015-04-06,8498172,Lia,"Yvonne is a lovely, welcoming and considerate person. Her place is really amazing. It is hidden behind some bushes right up a small hill with a really cute garden and a nice patio. The accomodation offered everything we need and even more. 
Downtown was just a 15 minutes drive away. During the night we used uber, that is a really nice and cheap alternative. 
We love that place and can highly recommend it! "
1455269,29674967,2015-04-11,27241967,James,"Yvonne was such a great host! Her home was welcoming, clean, and cozy. It is also conveniently located near downtown Seattle. She truly goes above and beyond as she puts much effort into making sure you feel right at home. Yvonne greeted us as soon as we arrived and she made sure we had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable. We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay and host. Thank you, Yvonne!"
1455269,29841436,2015-04-13,28842927,Hui,"It's a very nice place. Quiet, cozy and roomy. It's perfect for 4 or 5 people.  We really have a good time for staying there. 
"
1455269,30314724,2015-04-20,14442788,Sandy,"Yvonne was such a welcoming, friendly, and helpful hostess! The space was exactly as described (except more perfect). We were having trouble finding the spot in the dark so she stayed on the phone with us, watching for our lights to tell us when to stop. (Having checked later, I do think that MapQuest is now accurate).  The space is wonderful, the neighborhood is charming and diverse. We drove to the nearest lightrail location since we'd be returning in the dark and didn't know the area, but it would have been just fine to walk. Lovely spot, lots of snacks and coffee and real cream (hallelujah), wonderful experience. Would definitely recommend and would definitely stay again."
1455269,30759501,2015-04-27,13753705,John,"We had a great time at Yvonne's place.  It was very clean, roomy and inviting.  Yvonne is a great host.  We were surprised at the welcoming features: snack bowl, fully equipped kitchen (lot's of spice and condiments, pot and pans), a great Manual detailing anything you need to know including nearby restaurants and attractions, etc.  She runs a great AirBnB!!  We've stayed at quite a few the past year and Yvonne's is top-notch.  It has easy access to downtown and to the major interstate; so easy to get around.  We would recommend it to anyone."
1455269,31389788,2015-05-04,14708227,Carol,"When u enter the gate u feel immediately relaxed,  with the flowers and the inviting chairs . We loved to sit out and just relax
Yvonne met us, and made us feel at home. She explained how things worked, then left us to enjoy.
Yvonne was a great Host always right there if we needed help."
1455269,31873462,2015-05-11,1170022,Devlin,"Five of us stayed at Yvonne's and had a wonderful time in the midst of her beautiful garden sanctuary. The apartment had everything that was promised and that we could have possibly needed, and she went out of her way to make sure things went smoothly. We also really liked the location, and the good food spots we found nearby. Thanks so much Yvonne!"
1455269,32284967,2015-05-16,16816198,Issy,"Yvonne is about as good as a host can get! She is super nice and considerate. And her home is fantastic, carefully decorated and warm. Would stay at hers again if I were in Seattle and would recommend her to anyone!"
1455269,32523046,2015-05-19,26304088,Ziyi,"Yvonne is a super nice lady and the home is very beautiful. We checked in quite late that night, but she was still waiting for us there and gave us a warm welcome and the essential guide of the place. She even prepared some drinks and snacks for us. "
1455269,33365769,2015-05-27,8161295,Dan,"Yvonne's place is Awesome.... lots of space, a beautiful garden, close to the city but far enough away to feel secluded, and a great host.  Yvonne, was very helpful and available for any questions about Seattle.  I couldn't recommend her place more highly!"
1455269,34692662,2015-06-11,27242272,Joanna,Yvonne is really friendly and welcoming. Very easy to talk to and very responsive. 
1455269,34877038,2015-06-13,33297636,Jack,Very pleasant trip. Yvonne is very kind and considerate.
1455269,35200305,2015-06-16,5745118,Gary,I must say this location was by far one of the best Airbnbs I've had the pleasure of staying. When we arrived we were greeted by Yvonne who was more than willing to help us bring our bags inside (as there were quite a few of us). The place was immaculate when we entered. The fridge was fully stocked and there were tons of amenities. My family and I definitely felt at home. I can't see myself staying anywhere else next time I'm in Seattle. 
1455269,35392427,2015-06-18,32452727,Amy,We were greeted and got a personal tour from Yvonne and immediately felt welcomed. The comfortable accommodations and convenient location was perfect to access all that Seattle has to offer. Yvonne is an amazing host and I've already recommended her place to a friend who is enroute to Seattle! 
1455269,35902902,2015-06-23,25553356,Sandra,"Yvonne made us feel utterly at home!  The house was clean and welcoming, with plenty of room and everything we needed to have a comfortable, perfect stay!  We even had fragrant lilacs and other beautiful flowers in the gardens.  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and felt like kings and queens!!  "
1455269,36285818,2015-06-27,33084421,Phillip,Yvonne's home was beautiful and she was an absolute sweetheart. The space is spacious and there's a garden in the front.
1455269,37170985,2015-07-05,33759768,Charlotte,"The four of us enjoyed our stay at this comfortable, private retreat. Yvonne provides lots of amenities beyond the basics, and was quick to respond to requests. We took advantage of the extensive DVD library, and there is a diverse book collection to browse as well (wish we had more time). Within a short walking distance (down a steep hill) are a grocery store, drug store and inexpensive eateries. Downtown Seattle is an easy 10-15 minute drive away. Thank you for a great stay!"
1455269,37549241,2015-07-08,8777109,Ram,"Staying at your house was one of the best experiences. Yvonne made every house item available, concluding shopping bags and small kitchen supplies. This is truly a home away from home. We strongly recommend."
1455269,38104437,2015-07-13,17555189,Amy,A Warm and welcoming retreat!  Yvonne thought of everything!!  Well stocked kitchen and bathroom.  A beautiful place high above the streets.

这是一次完美的旅程，值得推荐。"
1455269,39157823,2015-07-21,31483860,Eric,"Yvonne was incredibly welcoming from the moment we arrived, and was a great resource for information on the neighborhood and Seattle. The home was clean, the kitchen well-stocked and the yard/garden was very lovely. Columbia City is a really interesting part of Seattle, and the home is really close to Rainier Ave, which has great shops, food, ice cream, etc., and is a short drive away from Lake Washington and Seward Park - not to mention a quick drive over to the Link station to catch the train into downtown. "
1455269,40425749,2015-07-31,29399250,Adam,Yvonne was a great host and our family truly enjoyed the space. There was plenty of room for our family of 6 to spread out so that we didn't go crazy on our family vacation. I'd highly recommend this space if you are looking to visit Seattle. 
1455269,41187000,2015-08-05,25936254,Mary,"Our family of four had a great experience staying at Yvonne and Ralph's home. The description of the property was 100% accurate, the home clean and well-stocked (even a welcome basket full of snacks after our late-night arrival). Yvonne responded promptly to all our questions, and made us feel most welcome. Beds are super-comfortable; linens are all clean, fresh and luxurious. We would definitely stay here again on our next visit to Seattle!!"
1455269,41919498,2015-08-10,24836587,Erin,"Yvonne is warm and welcoming- she even gave us some veggies from her garden!

1455269,48596713,2015-09-27,42824448,Stella,"Yvonne was very responsive throughout the process, which is especially important when you're traveling.  Her home is exactly as listed, in a quiet neighborhood, tucked away 35 stairs up from street level, which I actually liked!   The home is clean throughout and furnished eclectically with wonderful antique pieces throughout.  Her library of books and dvds is varied & extensive. Wifi & cable available, even a printer. Yvonne supplies everything you need to feel like a home away from home, right down to the olive oil and q-tips!  Unfortunately, my husband and I were sightseeing so much we barely made use of the all the amenities or to explore the nearby area but this was a comfortable place to come ""home"" to!"

Yvonne greeted us warmly, showed us around and answered any questions we had. She made it known that she was available had we needed anything. The space is clean, neat and attractive, and there was ample room for the 4 of us. Yvonne has stocked the apartment with just about anything you might need: shampoo, conditioner, soap, lotion, hairdryer; there was coffee, tea and half and half and even some snacks- all very welcoming and homey. The kitchen is well equipped with cookware and utensils, pot holders, saran wrap and the like- all the comforts of home! The patio and garden, replete with picnic table, are lovely. We found the house to be well situated and felt it was easy to get places from there. We would love to return someday and highly recommend Yvonne's hospitality! "

The house is in a great location of (email hidden)e modern style of the house felt very comfortable and it was spacious for the two of us staying there.

David was very accommodating, We had issues with our flights and didn’t arrive at the exact time we had originally agreed upon and David was completely fine with (website hidden) the midnight David came to pick up us on the road when we lost in the street,He has a lot of patient .That made us feel so great and regard David place as home away from home!!  That was extremely cool!! It was definitely a great stay and I would strongly recommend this David place as great hosts to anyone.when we left David house my sister was cring,she called David is ""GRANDPA""."
8505940,49196761,2015-10-01,20772520,Ribicca,Quiet neighborhood. Easily accessible to major highways. 
8505940,49390743,2015-10-03,8487143,Jyoti,"It was a great experience at David's place. Althogh we were there for one night, we had great time. The house was nicely maintained and the whole place was spick and span. I also liked the way David arranged breakfast and coffee in the morning. I would love to book this place again in future."
8505940,49530359,2015-10-04,27869742,Alan,Great experience. Host was very respectful and polite. Facilities were extremely clean. 
8505940,49943444,2015-10-07,45359353,Jacob,Great stay at the Cozy room near UW. Absolutely the best bed I've slept on at a Air BnB stay. Breakfast was set out every morning and the host really embraces the BnB lifestyle. Only negative was parking was little tricky if you got back late at night but parking in Seattle is tricky regardless. 
8505940,50036129,2015-10-08,7570205,Terre,"I didn't end up staying with David.  I ran into family stuff, I couldn't change.  David was really understanding and helpful.  He went out of his way to be helpful - it was greatly appreciated.  "
8505940,50891985,2015-10-15,46077771,Ajjen,"I was visiting Seattle to attend a conference at the University of Washington and found this place. The house is located at a nice residential neigborhood a short walk away from the UW campus. David is a great host, friendly and open to interesting conversations. My stay at his place was very pleasant!"
8505940,51174500,2015-10-18,44963420,Nic,"David is a very warm and professional host. I enjoyed chatting with him. He is a very cool dude. David pays great attention to detail in making sure that things run smoothly. 
 His house is exactly what I picture when I think of  a bed and breakfast.  Every morning he puts out a nice selection of cereal, breads and yogurt. His house has a homey feel while remaining very organized and well maintained. This craftsmen style home has been updated with modern appliances but still keeps the charm of an old house.
David has two rooms listed on AirBnB, and so if you're a light sleeper, you may be woken up at the floors creaking by the other guests coming in late at night.  Once the guests are in their room, you can't hear them walking around or talking, which is nice. The creaking seems to only be in the hall.
Despite other reviews saying that street parking was a hassle, I had no problem. I found parking on the back street easily.
All in all, my stay was a great first experience with AirBnB."
8505940,52940092,2015-11-02,47518109,Eric,"David is a welcoming and friendly host. He was very helpful in making suggestions of things we should do and see, and was very mindful of our privacy. His home is very clean and tidy and the room and downstairs are spacious. The bed is very comfortable and everything has the feeling of being very new. He lays out some basic breakfast items and coffee, which is an excellent perk. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with David and will definitely stay with him again if possible next time we visit Seattle!"
8505940,53841738,2015-11-13,36885959,David,Awesome host! David is really friendly and went above and beyond during my stay. Would definitely recommend staying here!

8505940,56423088,2015-12-13,23127293,Liz,"i'm going to echo the other great reviews david has, to say that my experience at his home was perfect. both my partner and i felt super comfortable the whole time ... and even shared wine and relaxing  conversation with him during part of our second night there. as a host, he is definitely available if you have any questions/needs or just want to chat, but also gave us plenty of privacy. a nice balance. even the little details were appreciated; he left a little placard to remind of check-out info, and provided us with a map of areas you couldn't park in the vicinity. the room and shared spaces were so well-kept and cozy is definitely the right word. the whole house in general was so clean and temperature-wise, ideal.

It's clean and homey, thanks to Hal's hard work and excellent taste in 1960s and '70s furnishings. It feels spacious, with a big porch, a dining nook, a functional kitchenette, and an ingenious open shower stall in the bathroom. Fremont's got some great nightlife and restaurants, but if the rest of the city calls to you, there's easy access to public transit just down the street from the house. Hal is a very gracious host. He'll gladly recommend things to see and do -- and then lend you bikes so you can zip down the Burke-Gilman Trail to Ballard or beyond. "
2731253,12634078,2014-05-06,12614331,Miriam,"Hal is a very nice host who will answer you every question you have!
The interior is made with love and a view for details especially the record player, very lovely!

Have your stay there if you like to visit Fremont!"
2731253,12900029,2014-05-13,8430229,Mai,We had a great time staying at the pad. Hal was friendly but also gave us plenty of space and yummy snacks. The pad was well equipped and we slept great in the comfortable bed. It was a great location from which to enjoy Fremont and a fun first airbnb experience.
2731253,13092282,2014-05-19,6390363,Allison,"This was my first experience with airbnb and I couldn't have asked for a better host! Hal was very accommodating and the place was awesome! Super convenient to several bus routes and a bike path, not to mention the tons of restaurants and the Sunday market in walking distance. We relied on public transportation and the bikes Hal provided to get us around and had no issues.

The Pad has a great setup and felt like home for us. It has everything you would need from a hotel but much more laid-back. We were able to enjoy coffee plus some of the snacks Hal provided on our patio one morning which was lovely. The vibe at the Pad seems to match the vibe of Fremont in general and is perfect for those who aren't as interested in hanging out downtown.

I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in town!"
2731253,13287611,2014-05-24,2738900,Markus,"We enjoyed our time in the pad very much. Hal is a friendly and welcoming host who pointed out very interesting spots for sightseeing, dining etc. The pad is an awesome place, rustic and artsy. Also very clean and functional. Outstanding.  "
2731253,13576234,2014-05-31,855123,Jon,The place was super cool and had a nice Fremont vibe. Hal was a great host.
2731253,13767839,2014-06-03,15835458,Kate,"Stay here! Stay here! My girlfriend and I had a fantastic experience at both the Tiny Guest House and the Pad (three nights at the Pad and one at the Tiny Guest House) I can’t say enough about Hal and his guest houses, the experience truly exceeded our expectations. Check-in was easy, the place had everything we needed, and Hal’s was always available to help. He even invited us up on his roof for kabobs. Also, it’s in a fantastic location. This Airbnb was a true delight, and the definitely the place I’ll be staying next time in Seattle."
2731253,14030908,2014-06-10,13322157,Quan,Convenient location. Nice and helpful host. Cozy and comfortable room.
2731253,14609206,2014-06-23,10387133,Lori,Hal is wonderful.  The Pad is amazing.  Truly a jewel in the heart of Fremont.  Lena Horn on the turn table was the icing on the cake.
2731253,14789980,2014-06-26,2207376,Katie,"Great area in Seattle, location is close to Fremont and to transit (15 min bus or you can walk!)... The place was cozy, clean and the views were unreal. Hal was very helpful, hospitable and knowledgeable about the area. Another AirBNB success!"
2731253,14920747,2014-06-29,9710549,N'Gai,"Met Hal on arrival at ""the pad"". Super friendly and helpful.  He gave us some fantastic suggestions on places to see around Fremont. His place was amazing and had everything one could  includingincluding internet access. 

 Fremont was amazing and I will definitely stay there on my next trip to the city. Great vibe and easy public transit access. Parking is street parking and if you can find one of the ""good spots"" (Hal will tell you where they are) you can just leave your car and explore the city. I'll definitely be looking Hal up for my next  to Seattle. "
2731253,15196609,2014-07-04,16373889,Ian,"We stayed at The Pad on a cross country road trip and this was easily the coolest lodging we used. This was my first AirBnB experience, and true to his profile, Hal helped me navigate the process and provided a great introduction to the community. He was a gracious host, and provided a helpful overview of the local area. Parking was quite easy for such a dense city location, and the bus to downtown was incredibly convenient and just a short ride. I will definitely check Hal's availability first next time I'm traveling to Seattle!

PS: The Deckutron. Make time to sit out and enjoy...it is fantastic!"
2731253,15258375,2014-07-06,299739,Kathy,"Not only is Hal a terrific host, but he is also someone who actually genuinely enjoys hosting, which I daresay is a rarity on AirBnB. I had originally wanted to stay at Hal's Teeny Tiny Guesthouse, but when that didn't work out, Hal was so gracious in working with me to problem-solve and offering us The Pad instead. My boyfriend and I ended up loving The Pad! It is a unique space that Hal clearly put a lot of thought into. When I woke up early due to jetlag, there were tea and snacks on hand to help me ease into the morning. Equipped with the bike map from the room, we used Hal's bikes to do a lot of our exploring (the hills are challenging!). Hal gives a great little tour of Fremont; I recommend taking down notes because he seriously has a lot of insider tips and info to offer! We made use of the record player as we lounged on the bed and watched the light disappear from the sky on a wondrous Seattle summer evening. The Pad is the kind of place we'd love to call our second home--and during our brief stay, it was just that! "
2731253,15497265,2014-07-10,16328216,Jennifer,"We had a wonderful time at The Pad! Thank you, Hal for the warm greeting and yummy treats. We would love to come and stay again!"
2731253,15680061,2014-07-14,2398462,Ali And Pehr,"Our stay at The Pad reinforced more than ever how awesome airbnb is! In town from LA for a wedding and first time visit to Seattle, Hal's Pad was key to making our trip memorable. Amazing location - one block from the heart of Fremont with plenty of restaurants, bars, shops, parks and a walk along the the canal. No car is needed around here between bus, bicycle, and uber or car2go. Surrounding neighborhoods are also so cute and filled with fun activities. The Pad itself was such a cool space. Hal has done a wonderful job with the vintage design. And as it is a hillside property, the terraced buildings and decks give privacy and a rustic mountain/modern oasis vibe. We got lots of use from the outdoor patio and enjoyed the greenery and trickling fountains. And, of course, Hal's fabulous hosting brings everything together to make this a 5 star experience. Thank you, Hal, for giving my husband and I a fantastic Seattle stay. We will recommend The Pad to all we know! "
2731253,15885792,2014-07-17,2312051,Nikolai,"The Pad itself is worth visiting Seattle. Hal decorated The Pad with so much thought, care and love - it's very creative, fun and very comfortable. You get a great outdoor terrace to have you morning coffee of breakfast, lots of privacy. Fantastic atmosphere. The location is just great - in the middle of the Fremont neighborhood, walking distance to a number of great restaurants, coffee places, amazing street artworks, music venues, and so much more, also it's very easy to navigate from The Pad to downtown or anywhere in Seattle. About Hal - he is a great host - very helpful, considerate, great communication, he provided us with the terrific city and neighborhood tips. Thank you Hal! We'd love to came back."
2731253,16081677,2014-07-22,11188386,François,"The Pad is such a great place, so many details in it (you get what you see in the pictures, really!), and perfectly located in Fremont with an easy access to downtown (many bus routes). Hal was the perfect host, he gave us many suggestions for things to do in the city and in Fremont. We really enjoy our stay and would definitely be back to the Pad if we were to go to Seattle again. "
2731253,16307847,2014-07-25,17247732,Adrian,"Hal was about as helpful as humanly possible! The Pad was possibly better than advertised... With a comfortable bed, a plethora of windows, a cool shower/bathroom,  and all amenities needed to cook and have fun, The Pad was in the running for the highlight of our trip. Fremont is home to markets, vintage stores, breweries, bars, music, nightlife, food, and coffee... And Hal's place is right in the center of all of it! Great spot I would highly recommend! "
2731253,16981009,2014-08-05,15944341,Elyse,"We had a great experience at The Pad. It was just as pictured and Hal was a great host. He gave us many recommendations for food, drinks etc.  The location was amazing, it was our first time in Seattle and the pad was close to everything. Public transit was very close and got us from the airport to Fremont area with just one transfer and a block walk to the house.  We felt very very safe at the pad even with all the windows and sliding door wide open. Great overall experience. Thanks Hal "
2731253,17151677,2014-08-08,16527296,Ted,"The Pad was the perfect spot for us to have an authentic Fremont experience.  We tried to take advantage of everything it had to offer (Hal's great neighborhood food and drink recommendations, the breezy room and porch, Hal's bikes, the kitchen, the record player and even the typewriter) and it made for a great trip.  Highly recommended.  "
2731253,17342412,2014-08-11,716499,Elise,We had an excellent time at The Pad in Seattle! Hal was a gracious host with lots of good advice for things to do in the surrounding areas. The Pad was very comfortable and we felt very welcome! Next time we're in Seattle we'd love to stay here again.
2731253,17827455,2014-08-18,963981,Liam,"Right from the get go, I felt at home. Despite arriving late in the day (9:30pm), Hal was there to greet us with his smiling presence. He even introduced us to one of the tenants that lives beneath The Pad. Then he showed us The Pad and pointed out a few things before we started chatting about nearby 'things to check out'. Hal was a great source of knowledge in this department as he is as weird and wonderful as the neighbourhood that he lives in. 

The Pad itself was beyond its description in how awesomely it was 'decked out' and spotless in terms of cleanliness. Hal even had set out a delightful little bowl of goodies including fresh fruit, chocolate croissants, and a bar of wicked chocolate. 

I would stay at either of Hal's accommodations again in a heartbeat. "
2731253,18069825,2014-08-21,17705789,Samir,This is a great base to explore Seattle and is situated in a cool neighbourhood. Hal was a welcoming and informative host and we loved staying in the pad. 
2731253,18469680,2014-08-27,14551626,Matt,"There are 3 things important to any traveller when using airbnb - a. the experience of the area you stay in, b. the experience of the place you choose to stay, c. the experience with the property owner/manager.  In all instances, 'the Pad' exceeds expectations.  Hal is an awesome host - warm, funny, accommodating, interesting and helpful.  His Pad is just the funnest place to stay - the furnishings are so interesting and you have everything you need.   Hal's creative flair really shows in the way he has set the place up. Finally, Fremont is not the typical tourist place to stay but you will NOT regret your choice. We stayed for 5 nights and it was not enough.  Great places to jog and cycle, plenty of shops (if that's your thing), and myriad places to eat and drink.  Also quite a few microbreweries and even a micro distillery as well.  

If you book The Pad you will have a great time, period.  

Thanks Hal - we will see you again for certain!!!!"
2731253,18713171,2014-08-31,16424365,Sarah,"Hal is a cool and helpful guy with an awesome vintage/eclectic Pad! He's available without being intrusive and this spot is in a great area. He even left fruit and snacks and a great selection of delicious tea. Would definitely stay here again.
 
p.s. We went hiking in the mountains and now your coffee table fairies are the proud owners of some real Washington crystals! ;)"
2731253,19075126,2014-09-06,846139,Bryan,"We very much enjoyed our stay at the Pad.  We found it clean and comfortable.  It's cleverly designed and well decorated and feels like a step above the usual AirBnb apartment.  Street parking is pretty close by and there are plenty of restaurants and shops within walking distance.  Hal was friendly and easy to contact, and has a lot of good information about the neighborhood and city.  Highly recommend!"
2731253,19114504,2014-09-07,20984887,Monica,The reservation was canceled 18 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2731253,19326802,2014-09-10,14983223,Laurel,"We had such an amazing time at the Pad! Hal was a wonderful host. Attentive and always there if you had any questions, yet not intrusive. The Pad was lovely as well. This place is a definite must for anyone visiting Seattle. "
2731253,19672391,2014-09-16,9827639,Patrick,Hal's place is amazing. It was the perfect spot for a weekend getaway. Hal went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable.
2731253,19871977,2014-09-20,16843095,Peter,"Hal's place is a very unique studio, different from other places we stayed but in a good way. Everything is very antique and quirky in the Pad. The place had everything we needed for the few days we stayed. Hal was there to greet us, gave us tips on everything to check out in Freemont. The studio was clean with plenty of tea. It is an open studio with an apartment under you and Hals place across but it has more a community vibe with people playing music around so we didn't mind. You still had your privacy. We loved the location which is right in the middle of Freemont full of cool shops, an organic supermarket, vintage and record stores, plenty of bars. 10 mins on a bus to downtown too. Hal also let us borrow two bicycles which was a huge plus as Freemont is a bike friendly area, plenty of paths down by the water. All in all a great place to stay if you are looking for something a little different than your standard apartment or hotel for sure. Would definitely recommend! "
2731253,20179900,2014-09-25,15597938,Rich,"A really fantastic apartment with amazing character. Location is also amazing! Bikes to borrow and welcome snack, surely one of the best places in Airbnb."
2731253,20953889,2014-10-08,18118375,Jimmy,"This place freakin rocks! Hal was a great host and gave us a thorough and much needed neighborhood orientation talk when we arrived. The Fremont is the place to be in Seattle. There are great restaurants and bars everywhere (including a pinball arcade!) and there is so much to see. It was easy to take the bus downtown to the Pike Market, Space Needle, and all the other sites, but we found the Fremont neighborhood (and neighboring Ballard) to be much more interesting. Once you escape the areas where there are hotels, you can have a more authentic, local experience. You will find good food, good coffee, and good beer almost everywhere you go. 

The Pad itself was perfect for my wife and I. It felt like a home, complete with a little kitchen and dining space. We loved the view of the neighborhood and the vintage vibe in the Pad. If we are back in Seattle in the future, we would definitely want to come back to Fremont and stay at Hal's Pad.

"
2731253,21460971,2014-10-18,2277911,Ashley,Hal's Pad is amazing! Perfect location and he was very gracious and an amazing host. I couldn't recommend it more. 
2731253,21946952,2014-10-27,5774320,Tomek,Great stay! The pad had everything I needed and more. Hal even gave me a nice introduction to the area and I was greeted with some nice beers in the fridge.
2731253,22607098,2014-11-10,22765484,Craig,"Hal kept in touch w/ us the entire process.  Since this was our first airbnb experience, Hal walked us through the process which we really appreciated.  The ""Pad"" was a nice place to stay and provided a lot of privacy.  Tip:  when you take a shower, put the toilet seat down or it will get wet.  There is a little kitchenette, but we did not use it.  We would stay again.  Thanks Hal."
2731253,24102356,2014-12-20,741136,Mike,"I spent 40 nights at The Pad in late 2014, and it felt like home from the moment I arrived.  Hal has created an fantastic space that makes you feel like you belong.  He was an incredibly friendly and helpful host, offering tips on places to see and do, allowing me to use his bikes to get around town, and making sure I had an awesome time.  

The location of the pad is also excellent, right in the heart of the Fremont neighborhood, just a 3-4 minute walk to great restaurants, cafes, bars, Lake Union, etc.  I would regularly bike to Ballard for the Sunday Farmer's Market, or to Wallingford for dinner.  Parking was a breeze, too - I could park for days on end on the street nearby.

I can't recommend The Pad highly enough - it truly is one of the very best places I've ever stayed on Airbnb!"
2731253,24542503,2014-12-30,22615626,Eyad,"Hal and 'The Pad' were awesome!!!!

He met us on the street and helped us park our car, and gave us so many great tips on where to eat, sight see, drink, etc. He definitely made us feel welcome and also left us pastries and chocolate upon our arrival. I mean, come on...that's super nice. He even invited us to his Boxing Day party on the first day we were there. 

We stayed at three different Air B&B places on our trip and Hal's was EASILY our favorite. The Pad is cozy, comfortable, clean and so unique. It's easy to tell the amount of care and love Hal put into the place. It was a perfect place to relax and unwind after a day of running around. We'd get home, pour a drink and play some records on the player he has set up in the Pad. The location is perfect, with tons of food and drinks in walking distance. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle and it would be my first choice to stay in Seattle the next visit. A++ Hal!!!"
2731253,24945521,2015-01-04,22218006,Drew,"Hal was a wonderful host. I spoke with him ahead of time and told him i planned on proposing to my girlfriend, and he shared different places to go to do it, and even offered to help set it up. He had great local snacks and drinks waiting for us, including some champagne to celebrate. his posting was very accurate and in a perfect location to accommodate where we wanted to go. We were very pleased with our stay and glad Hal helped make our trip one to remember."
2731253,25339945,2015-01-12,5187942,Justin,"The Pad was an amazing place.  Beautifully and lovingly decorated, with very creative construction and design.  Terrific views to the south and west.  The location is great, very close to numerous restaurants, bars, the Fremont Market, etc.  Hal was a great host, and I was thankful that he could have the place ready for me on very short notice.  It was a terrific stay."
2731253,25567613,2015-01-19,19808677,Mike,"Hal is a wonderful host, with a ton of information about the area.  The Pad is awesomely quirky, and the location really couldn't be better for checking out everything in Fremont.  Would definitely stay here again!"
2731253,27256338,2015-03-01,1776152,Cynthia,Hal's a great host- friendly knowledgeable & attentive. Neighborhood can't be beat- walking distance to souch of Seattle's charm. 
2731253,27657450,2015-03-09,18746736,Hayley,"Even with not being there, Hal was an excellent host. He made sure that we were taken care of through emails and made himself available even when he was on vacation himself. The space was very much a positive place to stay at. I didn't realize the walkway was see through grating, which made my scared-of-heights friend a little queasy. The space is comfortable, a little eccentric, but we'll cared for and clean. The only downside was the fact none of the windows had screens. We had plenty of buggies and giant moths flying in to make themselves at home. Overall, neat place, wonderful area, wonderful host, and I would definitely stay here again!"
2731253,28481280,2015-03-24,14628379,Natalie And John,"Hal was such a helpful host straight from the beginning. He promptly responded to all of my emails, answering our questions and offering transportation advice. Even though Hal was out of town during our stay, he made sure to have his friend Hillary available for us should we have any issues along the way. Hillary allowed us much privacy, which I prefer. The Tiny Guest House itself, is a very cute property with quite the collection of unique vintage decor. We found the studio to have ample space for the two if us and all of our baggage. Also appreciated, was the basket of snacks and craft beers in the fridge. This location is extremely close to the happening spots of Fremont and a very quick drive to downtown. Thanks Hal, for having us as your guests!"
2731253,28671416,2015-03-28,29229392,Emily L.,"The Pad in Fremont is a groovy little gem. It feels very private,  yet it is right in the heart of a busy neighborhood. The pictures and description given by Hal are completely accurate. If you find the vibe appealing, then you will really enjoy staying there. I especially appreciated having a porch, the kitchenette and the thoughtful layout. It is an excellent value; I am so glad I did not stay in a hotel! This was my first airbnb experience, and my expectations were exceeded. I am spreading the word already. Safe travels."
2731253,28998851,2015-04-02,7725864,Alex,The pad was really great!  It is cute and quirky.  The neighborhood is cool too!  We had an easy trip and everything went smoothly.  And we would definitely come back!  
2731253,31056045,2015-05-01,29940569,Brie,This place is somehow even more endearing and cool in real life. Hal was an absolutely lovely host! He was super quick about getting back to me and really helpful with giving us the lay of the land. I would unequivocally stay here again.
2731253,32479866,2015-05-18,13715653,Michael,Hal was wonderful.  He gave us a lay of the land of Fremont and Ballard that was super informative.  He was always easy to reach via text and very friendly. The Pad is a magical little place to stay and in a perfect location.
2731253,32929912,2015-05-23,1499027,James,"Hal is the consummate host and a true AirBnB veteran. ""The Pad"" is cosy, comfortable and decorated with an array of cool vintage pieces. The Pad is ideally located in the heart of Seattle's Fremont neighborhood and everything one could need is within an easy walk. If you are looking for an authentic Seattle experience...this is it!"
2731253,33239701,2015-05-26,17345090,Lisa,"We had a fabulous experience staying at The Pad!  Hal was a wonderful host.  We had a bit of trouble finding the place and he was available when I called and super helpful in getting us to the right place.  

The Pad was clean and comfortable with a beautiful view and plenty of space for the two of us.  The ONLY critique I have of the Pad was the bathroom - it's open with no shower curtain or divider for the shower, so the whole floor was a bit wet for a few hours after each shower.  Not a huge deal, though.  Otherwise, we loved the funky retro decor and the fresh fruit and pastries Hal had waiting for us was a very thoughtful touch!   Hal also had bikes we could borrow which was wonderful - we used them on two full days of our stay to get all around the city.  

I would definitely recommend this place to family and friends looking for a great location and a place with a fun vibe, very convenient Fremont location and a great host!"
2731253,34004674,2015-06-03,13522016,Linda,"Hal was a great host - met us as we came In and gave us a quick overview of the property and neighborhood.  He was friendly and available when we needed him.  The house was well-equipped, down to bus schedules and bike maps.  We'd stay here again!"
2731253,34258624,2015-06-06,6096030,Lea,"The Pad is very DIY Funky --  Perhaps a little too funky for me.  It is as Hal says a ""man cave"" and I was a single woman staying there.  
I liked Hal a lot.  The location near Fremont is terrific.  If you have a heavy rollerboard, it is not the place for you."
2731253,34547681,2015-06-09,31970236,Christina,"The Pad was the perfect spot for us- unbelievably close to shops, restaurants, attractions, and public transportation while maintaining a sense of quiet and privacy.  Hal was there to welcome us, and gave us phenomenal suggestions on places to visit and dine. His welcome basket of local goodies was a treat, and his eclectic Pad immediately felt like a home away from home. If ever in Seattle again, we would try to plan our trip around The Pad's availability."
2731253,35364906,2015-06-18,26685119,Reisa,"How is a wonderful host and the pad is a great place to stay. Everything was exactly as he described it and as shown in the pictures. When we arrived there was a lovely gift basket. There were ample towels and the place was very clean and welcoming. Hal is totally charming, very easy to talk with. I highly recommend this space."
2731253,36663019,2015-06-30,30473400,Robin,"We had a great experience with Hal and The Pad. It's a great location and quite cozy. Directions from the airport via train and bus were spot on. We were greeted with a welcome basket full of local goodies. Hal provided great advice for the neighborhood and city as well as bikes that proved to be useful. Overall, we would highly recommend Hal and The Pad. "

2731253,37863281,2015-07-11,202086,Jennifer,"Hal is the epitome of a dream Airbnb host -- he's communicative, friendly, warm, thoughtful, and treats his guests with the utmost care and support. He's happy to share the neighborhood gems, he leaves fresh fruit and snacks, and is super attentive and understanding around the check-in/check-out exchanges. "
2731253,38269082,2015-07-14,25698899,Louise,"The Pad is a great spot to enjoy Seattle! It's in a great location (in a cool neighborhood but not too loud at night), and Hal is very welcoming. I would definitely stay here again!"
2731253,39505625,2015-07-24,6943314,Emily,"The Pad was a great place to stay. The space was very eclectic and had everything I needed for a three-night stay. The location is amazing, close to really great restaurants and coffee shops. The bike path is fun and I was thankful Hal offered bikes and a helmet. The welcome back was a nice touch. Would definitely stay here again! "
2731253,41931132,2015-08-10,31667183,Luke,"My son and I stayed at the Pad in July/August for a week, so that he could attend the DOTA gaming tournament at the KeyArena.  The trip could not have been better.  Hal is clearly devoted to his AirBnB homes - and visitors - and wants to ensure we have a terrific time.  

Hal was in touch prior to our arrival so that he could ready the place properly.  Everything was clean and airy, the towels and linens fresh, the fruit bowl filled, and Hal himself was on hand to answer any questions we might have.  We did have questions regarding bus service to downtown, local places to eat and have coffee, and other sights.  He answered them all, and then some.  I wasn't able to follow up on every rec, but I will agree that Paseo (Cuban sandwiches), a short walk up the rather steep Fremont Avenue, is a MUST-eat.  Even if you're only using Fremont as a stepping point for downtown, it really is a wonderful 'hood: quirky sculptures of clowns and the troll abound, there are tons of eateries, and a laid-back vibe predominates.  If you are yearning to explore the city, there are probably a half-dozen bus lines within 5 minutes of the Pad, and Hal will let you know which app can help you navigate best.  (Personally, I like Transit, though it doesn't feature real-time buses.)

As for the Pad itself, it comes exactly as advertised.  Essentially an extension to the building below, Hal has created a delightful studio space that nevertheless feels like a separate entity.  The bedroom/living area is spacious and offers some eccentric touches - a bedside table made of a tree trunk, 60s magazines, a turntable, a Chinese rug from the 1930s.  Both the bed and the couch are quite comfortable.  A sliding door divides the main space from the bathroom, which is elegant and compact and holds an open shower, something I've always loved.  There's no utility room or washing machine, but Hal kindly let me use the machine/dryer in his art space, which is right next door.  The attention to detail and the design of the Pad are what I enjoyed the most.  Almost better, though, is the design of the Tiny Guesthouse, another of Hal's creations.  If you can, have him show you its incredible space-saving features . . . All in all, it was a most enjoyable stay.  I'd happily stay again, if I ever make it back up to the Emerald City."
2731253,42530410,2015-08-14,8424858,Edwin,"We had a fantastic time staying at The Pad! If you want to stay in the heart of Fremont, this is it. Blocks away from lots of great restaurants. He is a great host! He left a real nice fruit and pastry basket for us and the apartment itself is very comfortable and has lots of character, you can tell he put a lot of thought into how it is put together. We made use of the bikes (you are about 4 blocks from a 26 mile bike path). We definitely want to return again!"
2731253,43647397,2015-08-21,38408346,E,"It was cozy, spacious, and clean. The host offered some helpful suggestions upon arrival. Overall all a very good stay"
2731253,44644831,2015-08-28,35771929,Skye,"My only hesitation in writing a review is a selfish desire to keep this gem a secret! All expectations were more than exceeded. The only disappointment is not being able to make  it a permanent home. Hal has created a peaceful sanctuary in the rooftops just steps away from the vibrant neighborhood of Fremont. The eclectic/retro decor is fantastic and the result of an aesthetic labor of love and talent by Hal himself. It was a feast for the eyes to explore all of the personal touches. At the same time, all of my comfort needs were met. The bed was comfy, the shower was great, the record player and choice vinyl provided the soundtrack to my stay, the deck was a perfect happy hour venue. Hal was a great host too: friendly; accessible; accommodating. I will absolutely make The Pad my home away from home in Seattle."
2731253,45249786,2015-09-01,34851438,Coral,"The Pad is everything it's advertised to be and more.  Hal is a wonderful host who is both thoughtful and helpful.  He stocked the place with some tasty local snacks and also gave us great recommendations on where to go in Fremont.  The whole weekend anything we needed was a text away as Hal bent over backwards to make our stay a wonderful stress free experience.  

The Fremont neighborhood was the perfect neighborhood to stay in. It was clean, safe, centrally located and there was a ton to do. 

The combination of the lodging, a great host and a wonderful neighborhood made our trip to Seattle one of the best weekend getaways we've had a while. I can't recommend staying with Hal in the Pad enough!"
2731253,46128920,2015-09-08,23970938,Timothy,Hal's place was amazing. Super affordable and a convenient location. We would definitely stay here again on our next visit to Seattle. Hal was super friendly and gave us great tips on where to go about town. He was also very flexible with us about showing up early and leaving a bit late on our travel days.
2731253,46708054,2015-09-13,36296855,Ruth,"The Pad was exactly as advertised and pictured. We had an INCREDIBLE time staying in this little space. It really is in the heart of Fremont, five minutes away from shops and restaurants. However, when we left the windows open at night, the only sound you could hear was the occasional cricket chirp. Hal was an awesome host, leaving us snacks to welcome us and giving us a million suggestions for things to do. He definitely gave us our privacy, but was always readily available to chat or help. Fremont was only a 15 minute bus ride from downtown Seattle, and a 10 minute ride from historic Ballard. This was our first AirBNB experience, and we recommend it to anyone! "
2731253,47270019,2015-09-17,40944988,Todd,"Hal has done a great job in creating The Pad. It's furnished with some really cool vintage items as well as some fun details that require a closer look. The neighborhood is pretty quiet and you're just steps away from great restaurants, coffee, parks and bus stops. It's in the perfect location to venture out and explore the city.

Hal was great! He was happy to offer up suggestions for my short stay in Seattle. Whether it was a place see or a dinner recommendation, it ultimately made for a great experience. I would definitely recommend staying at The Pad!"
2731253,49108882,2015-10-01,39076134,Brent,"Such an incredible place and in a great location. Walking distance to all Fremont has to offer. 
Would definitely recommend staying here. 
Thanks for making our first Airbnb experience a great one Hal!"
2731253,49632878,2015-10-05,58524,Chris And Carolina,"Hal was super welcoming and provided us with great tips on places to go in Fremont.  The Pad is very conveniently located, with lots of restaurants, bars, breweries, coffee shops, and grocery options within easy walking distance.  The Pad is in a nice little neighborhood that's really quiet at night.  Hal provides everything you need to stay comfortably in his space.  He also included some snacks for us on arrival which was much appreciated.  Location, Location, Location!  It's also a cool little space, Hal has collected lots of interesting furniture and decorations, really unique and fun.  We'd definitely stay again!"
2731253,50014159,2015-10-08,10281620,Martina,Hal is a very dedicated host and his place is very well located and cozy to stay in!
2731253,50354673,2015-10-11,6688169,Thomas,"Hal was awesome. He made special arrangements for an early check-in, and had great recs for food in the area (go get the pork sandwich at Paseo).  The Pad was great and as cool as the pics show. Quiet and private, comfy bed, and Johnny Cash LPs on the phonograph. "
2731253,50749300,2015-10-14,2714263,Carolyn,"Hal was very communicative leading up to our stay and upon our arrival was very helpful in laying out all the Fremont hotspots. The Pad has a great location, very centrally located and we took advantage of the provided bikes and spent a great day exploring the city. The Pad itself is quirky and cozy.  Based on the location calling it the ""launch pad"" may be more appropriate as we were so close to so many great things we were rarely there. Only complaint was  the noise a couple of evenings. Being on east coast time we were consistently heading to bed around 10-11pm and on our last night  what seemed to be a live band was playing or practicing somewhere in the vicinity. Thankfully we were so exhausted from running around and exploring we passed out pretty quickly anyway. Would recommend the Pad for singles or couples looking to explore Seattle. "
2731253,51731729,2015-10-24,42777840,Bianca,"Hal was amazing, super helpfull and generous with both his time and energy. I throughly enjoyed my stay at the Pad, the place is magnificent in all its retro querky hipster Fremont glamour. Hall reuses rainwater for the toilet, a sustainablility feature that I personally appreciate a lot. He also provides bikes for you to use, which I also really appreciate. Its the little things like this that just makes the big difference, you know."
2731253,52221442,2015-10-27,4270240,Whitney,"Hal was a great host! He rearranged his schedule so I could check in early and drop off my bags before exploring the city. He gave me a quick verbal guide to Fremont and made me feel welcome. I was able to contact him late at night with questions and he stayed in contact with me, via text,  keeping me updated on a last minute house repair. "
2731253,53014477,2015-11-03,989647,Aubrey,"Hal is a gem of a host and man, and this was by far one of my best airbnb experiences, and I've had mostly positive thus far. The pad was a beautiful study in design aesthetic, efficiency of space, and plain old convenience. Upon arrival, Hal's thorough neighborhood explanations and prompt communication during the stay made it all feel that much more personable. Fremont is a lovely corner of Seattle to use as a home base, and rail/bus/uber were all accessible from here. Hal has a gift for hosting, design, and being a nice person. "
2731253,54374517,2015-11-19,43748843,Jonathan,"Hal was very welcoming, and the pad (as well as the location) was great: clean, comfortable, but also with personality. I stayed for a over two weeks, but would have stayed even longer! I would recommend staying here."
2731253,55068215,2015-11-27,44668247,Candice,Hal has great places to stay in this beautiful city. I love the rich character of this unique abode! Hal even provided cruising bikes and a great set of directions the the many bike trails nearby.. Wish I could have stayed longer ! Hal was great! It was truly a wonderful visit. 
2731253,56201727,2015-12-10,23219915,Allan,"Everything about Hal's Pad is the height of cool. From the custom set of keys, to the great interior design and artwork on the walls. Hal has a superlative location in Fremont. It's blocks away from the main drag and the bus lines.

The care given to all the details in the interior of the space is a great reflection on Hal. He is an extremely personable, thoughtful host who is just an extremely cool individual. Everything he's done has been self built and he had a great attention to detail and design. "
2731253,57116689,2015-12-22,32766219,Paul,"The Pad is very cool and ideally located.  Make sure to follow Hal's directions on how to get there because it can be a little tricky!  Great grocery store, cool bars and good eats all nearby!"
2731253,57722771,2015-12-28,309775,Gaye,"This was a nice spot, very cozy and charming, everything worked well, and the space was well-organized and comfortable. Excellent record player and records, Sunny gave us a very nice reception, plus a basket of treats for Christmas day. We had a very nice time. Fremont is the most relaxing and interesting neighborhood in the city. "
7821351,45319185,2015-09-01,31410516,Rey,Beate was a great host. Her place is amazing and very close to great restaurants. I highly recommend this apartment :)
7821351,46179080,2015-09-08,33301543,Nathan,"Beate was a great host, providing all needed information, and easy to communicate with. The townhouse is wonderful - very comfortable, very nicely decorated, all needed amenities and great location, easy access by bus and easy to park, fun shops and restaurants right nearby, and close to many interesting neighborhoods and parks and downtown. Would strongly recommend, without any hesitations and looking forward to staying there again if I can. "
9167786,54487385,2015-11-20,23745932,Degen,"Maija was great! Super friendly and flexible. Her place was clean and had an awesome location, it is tricky to find and street parking was tough but she sends good directions that are helpful. "
387079,1890537,2012-08-05,2441468,Andres,"The Apartment is great located in the hipster part of Seattle, I would fully recommend anyone to stay here. Nick made the checking for us and he was really nice and helpfull. The apartment has everything you need and is clean and organized. If I ever visit Seattle again this will be my choice."
387079,2238272,2012-09-09,236493,Trisha,"We had a great stay in Seattle in the apartment - it's a beautiful place in a great Capitol Hill location.  Check in and check out was quick and simple thanks to Nick.  

A few (walkable) favorites in the neighborhood - Top Pot doughnuts, Espresso Vivace, Roy Street Coffee & Tea, and Rione XIII (great Italian food).

Tip: Get the parking for $10/day extra.  It's well worth it, as the neighborhood can be pretty crowded.

Would definitely stay here again on our next trip to Seattle!"
387079,2451961,2012-09-30,1445111,Patrick & Kristy,"We stayed in the apartment for two weeks and thought it was a great place to call home. The apartment is well equipped for hanging out at home and we loved watching the sun set over the space needle and Olympic Mountains from the balcony.

If you want to get out and explore, the surrounding neighborhood, Capitol Hill, is wonderful. Restaurants, bars, donuts, delicious coffee and plenty more are all available within a short walk.

We'd definitely stay again."
387079,2561995,2012-10-09,3562487,Benjamin,"Had a terrific visit! The host was willing to meet up with us early to allow for an early check-in, made sure we were very comfortable in the apartment, gave us a list of things to do in the area, and provided a summary of location public transit. He also offered to keep our belongings in a safe place after we checked out, as our flight didn't leave for several hours after check out.

The apartment itself was wonderful - awesome location, very clean, and clearly new appliances. Overall it was a very hip space.

I was visiting Seattle with my girlfriend and this was our first Airbnb experience. We can't wait to do it again. All of our doubts and worries about Airbnb were cleared within 5 minutes of walking into the apartment and meeting the host.

Highly recommend!!!"
387079,2703440,2012-10-24,2498773,Derek,The apartment was great! There was a seamless check-in and I really enjoyed the location—it was quiet and only a few blocks from the Broadway corridor and essential bus lines. Everything in the apartment was super clean and the bed was really comfortable. Fast internet and cable were great amenities. I would definitely stay here again on my next visit to Seattle.

We took advantage of the parking, as the area can be difficult to find parking-- particularly on the weekends."
387079,9147433,2013-12-09,9703150,Tyler,"This place is absolutely fantastic.  It's literally 3 blocks from places to eat and shop.  It's so fantastic to stay in such a carefully curated apartment.   I felt like it was my home away from home.  I arrived close to midnight and Autumn met me we the biggest smile ever.  CLEARLY, she understands customer service.  (Rare these days).

The place is immaculate, well decorated, and my friend who came over actually said he was jealous because it was better than his own apartment.  

I plan on booking this place every time I come to Seattle.  "
387079,10236145,2014-02-08,9703150,Tyler,"I won't stay anywhere else when I come to Seattle... and I come 10-15 times a year for work.  The place is awesome, clean, the customer service is amazing.  I highly recommend. "
387079,12110176,2014-04-23,8763652,Lea,"Nice neighborhood.
Very helpful and friendly landlady.
Lovely parks in the area.
City center within walking distance.
Perfect apartment, with everything we needed.
Bus just around the corner, very easy to get around.
We had a wonderful time and would definitely stay here again.
"
387079,12953521,2014-05-15,8821940,Ben,"GREAT place in the perfect spot on Capital Hill.  Walking distance to restaurants, bar, shopping, grocery, etc.  The apartment is very comfortable and clean with plenty of storage.  It is well equipped and in a nice, quiet neighborhood on the third floor, which is a walk up.  Check in could not have been easier and our host was great at showing us everything and giving us suggestions of places to go.  Currently there is some construction going on next door that would not allow for a long, quiet weekend.  It starts around 7:30 and ends around 4:30.  Autumn was very upfront about letting us know that in advance so there were no surprises, but important to know.  Free WIFI!  Thanks for a great stay."
387079,16652516,2014-07-31,5776472,Rachel,"Overall, this was a very nice condo in a good location.  It was clean, the beds (main and pullout) were comfortable, was in a quiet neighborhood, and was close to bus stops or within walking distance of many activities.

However, there are some things that I wish had been made clear before booking:
(1) The washer and dryer are not in the unit, but in a laundry room on the first floor.  There are 2 of each machine, hours of use, the cost is $1.50 per load, and there is no change machine.
(2) We were fully informed about the construction going on and I'd read reviews from other about the noise.  Although the manager response says that the construction is fully sealed and no dust is created, that is not the case.  There are wood walls around the lower part, but we could not open the windows even on cool days because of the amount of construction dust in the air.  If you will be there during construction, make sure to confirm that the a/c fans will be in place.  They do a very good job of blocking some of the noise and are necessary for air circulation.  
(3) The info book has incorrect information:  they do not provide laundry detergent, there was no coffee, and you have to request that the Wii game system be brought in (it's not in the unit).  
(4) There are only 4 towels.  No matter if there are 1 or 4 people, staying a weekend or 2 weeks, that is how many you will get.  There were 4 of us, staying 2 weeks.  Despite the long booking, we had to clean our own towels (at cost).  Also, you will have a set amount of other supplies:  toilet tissue, paper towels, etc.  If you are staying for more than a few days, be prepared to buy your own.

Not a reaction to the unit, but to the area:  if you plan on walking, there are many steep hills!  If you plan on walking downtown, to Pike Place, the Space Needle, and so on, you will be walking downhill there.  On the way back, there are 3-4 inclines (up to about 40%) that you will have to walk up.  "
387079,19073605,2014-09-06,13894727,Jim,"The appartment is clean, comfortable and well thought out.  It is located in a great Capital Hill neighborhood and is close to everything.

Autumn is peronable, responsive and informative.
She was a pleasure to work with.  We had a wonderful time and would recommend 424 Summit Avenue East Appartments."
387079,19479967,2014-09-13,20069616,Jessica,"Had a good experience at Autumn's place. I didn't meet her in person, but communication was good. Loved the neighborhood and the apartment!"
387079,23533813,2014-12-03,13309959,Helen,Autumn was a great host. Welcomed us with a smile and took the time to show us around to make sure we settled in nicely. The apartment was clean and lovely. The location of the apartment was great for our needs. A quick 10-15 minute walk really got you to any restaurant or bar (and ice cream shop!) in the area. Would definitely stay again! 
387079,23642582,2014-12-07,675927,Timothy,"This was a great place.  It looks exactly like the photos, is in an excellent location, and was incredibly clean and well maintained.  It is, though, a little different/more corporate than a lot of the other AirBnB's I've stayed in -- whoever the owner is has a block in the building and Autumn, who is *amazing* is there to help you 'check in' and that kind of thing.  "
387079,24809880,2015-01-03,2472201,Hayssam,"Autumn was very friendly and helpful.
The apartment was absolutely perfect for our needs in term of provisions and location. I highly recommend this unit and would book it again without hesitation if I return to Seattle. "
387079,25292525,2015-01-11,13275635,Antonette,"Overall, it was a great trip. Christi (Autumn's friend) was the one who welcomed me to the apartment and gave great recommendations to the neighborhood. The apartment was clean and just like the pictures if not better. For my first time in Seattle, this was a good location to stay in. 


My hesitancies about the place are: 
-Construction in the adjacent lot where there is a new building being built. Construction workers were there from 8a-5p so there was quite a bit of noise when we wanted to sleep in.
"
387079,25603618,2015-01-20,10589179,David,"Beautiful space, very convenient for everything I needed. Everything was clean and great.

Thanks!"
387079,27303402,2015-03-01,2362827,Anne,"Loved my stay at this amazing apartment and Autumn was such a sweetheart at making sure I felt welcome! Booked this place as a stay-cation and it definitely made my weekend! Some of the special little things that made a difference included: bottle of wine and sodas waiting for us, a nice and truly well-stocked kitchen, and a cute little guestbook to read and add too. Will be recommending this to friends and family who plan on visiting in the future :)"
387079,28265923,2015-03-21,28247109,Randy,"Autumn was hospitable and warm with great information about the city. She seemed as hands off or hands on as you would like her to be offering ""I won't be in your way but I am a text message away if you need me."" Place was comfortable, great area and had everything I needed. I would definitely come back"
387079,28940412,2015-04-01,10200363,Alex,"The apartment was awesome. Amazing location in Capitol Hill (only a few blocks to Broadway and very close to Top Pot and Atomic Coffee). We had 4 people in there and it was still very comfortable. The only downside was the construction next door (where a new apartment building is going up) which started at 7am each day, but was only really loud one morning--not too bad."
387079,29515279,2015-04-08,6657404,Christine,"The place was great. Autumn was nice and accommodating, letting us check in early so we can get settled and start our vacation right away. The place was clean and bright and well supplied with extra towels and bedding. We loved the location, was able to explore so much by foot. Would definitely stay here again. "
387079,30221790,2015-04-19,1382794,Zachary,"Capitol Hill is a fantastic, quiet neighborhood. This location is next to a construction site, however it looks to be finished or very nearly so. The apartment was clean, fantastic and roomy."
387079,32212103,2015-05-15,12550888,David,This was my first use of AirBnB. Everything went incredibly well. Autumn took care of all of the logistics in a professional manner and was very pleasant on top of that. The apartment it self was great and even more than I could have hoped for. Frankly I will always try to work with Autumn and Melissa whenever I am in the Seattle area.
387079,33417463,2015-05-27,23497132,Lina,"The apartment was beautiful and looked just like the pictures! It was in an excellent location and walking distance to tons of restaurants and bars. The apartment was very big and comfortable, and most importantly, super clean! 

Autumn was an excellent host. She met us upon checking in and was very helpful walking us through everything in the apartment, as well as lots of suggestions for places to go.

We loved our stay! We will definitely return and stay at Melissa's & Autumn's place again. "

It was super clean, well decorated, had easy parking, and was well furnished with everything needed to make for a great weekend stay.  The neighborhood was walking distance from many great locations such as Paseo sandwich shop, the Fremont troll, a nice relaxing lake, and a variety of other neat little shops around Fremont.  Autumn was a great host; very friendly and helpful for us out-of-town guests, and we will definitely be back.  Thanks!

387079,49775394,2015-10-06,37492247,Gina,"We really loved our stay in this absolutely gorgeous one bedroom apartment.  Everything was as pictured, very well kept.  The king bed was a must for my boyfriend and I.  It was more on the firm side vs. overly soft- which was definitely ok with me!  This apartment is close enough to walk to downtown and very cheap to uber.  We loved this place and appreciate the very convenient booking process. Loved it!"
387079,50776944,2015-10-14,8086087,Maria,"We had a great time in Autumn's Capitol Hill apartment. It was very clean, and very nicely situated. It's a bit far from downtown Seattle, but the bus is so close. Parking is a bit tricky and you've got to be careful of street parking. Some signs are okay with all day parking, some not. Just opt for the daily parking (with a fee) that you pay to Autumn when she greets you at the apartment! 

Autumn was a really nice and warm and friendly. She even helped fix the cable problem we were having. 

Thank you for the wonderful time!
"
387079,51116476,2015-10-18,31541255,Melissa,"The apartments look exactly as pictured and are very spacious, clean, and comfortable. Autumn was great to work with, super friendly, and very attentive via text for any questions throughout our stay!

Unfortunately we rented two of these units 3 months in advance of our stay, and on the DAY OF our arrival the host notified us that one unit had been mistakenly double booked. They were able to accommodate us in other units for 3 of the 4 nights we had originally booked, and still charged us a cleaning fee for each unit. Needless to say, we were quite upset that a well-planned trip backfired on us at the last minute. I would advise to relentlessly check on your booking in the weeks leading up to your stay to ensure this doesn't happen."
387079,56081747,2015-12-08,50120279,Becca,Autumn was timely and very helpful.  The place is beautiful!!  We loved the location as it was quiet yet close to much of Capitol Hill and bus stops to go explore other parts of the city.  
859467,4091020,2013-04-08,3284491,Rick,"The house is a quirky ""very West Seattle"" place. The property is literally on the water. Amazing views from the bed and really the entire property. The pictures are exactly what you get. Mike is a great guy and very accommodating. the price is well worth what you get. I only had ""same day"" to find the place because other plans fell through. Mike was right on it to help out. The property is lived in, so it feels such. It feels like you crashed your friends house and kicked them out for the weekend...food in the fridge, clothes in the closet, etc. The positive part of that is you have all the cookware and dished you need. If you can hang with that, its all good (I can and don't mind) but I also travel allot, and know that feel isn't for everyone...so just an FYI.
All in all the property and experience was awesome. HBO, Showtime, and good Sat TV all provided. NO WIFI or INTERNET...once again...just FYI...some require it, some don't care.
Would I, will I visit again? Hell yeah...loved the place, Mike is awesome...perfect price...Loved my stay."
859467,5622646,2013-07-08,1751176,Terri,"The view is absolutely amazing. Michael was great at communicating and letting us know exactly what to expect and what was expected from us. I loved that it was dog friendly. Again the view was AMAZING!
"
859467,5721007,2013-07-13,4422548,Dave,"This is a wonderful place, right on the water. Literally, the porch and new bedroom sit right on the water, with great views of the sunset and the islands in Puget Sound. We enjoyed our stay immensely."
859467,5828306,2013-07-18,2340259,Marc,"When you walk into home and there are a multitude of air fresheners going, it should raise the question, ""what odors are they masking?"" This place was filthy, messy, and no privacy. Who puts a bed in the breakfast nook and calls it a view bedroom.  Very deceptive.  Clothes were in the closet, so no room to hang anything...hair on the soap in the shower...ugh!  I had to wash grease/dust covered glasses to use them. The carpet, furniture was dirty.  Also, there was construction going on right next door beginning at 7 AM!  Not what I call a relaxing vacation.  If you rent from this place, ask more questions and what in land's name does he do with the cleaning deposit?  I'm sure it's not for it's intended purpose, based on the condition of this ""home"".  Yuck......beware! "
859467,6490593,2013-08-14,5072241,Jennifer,"Michael and his girlfriend's home is RIGHT on the water. Best view ever and the wonderful breeze makes the house just wonderful.

We had a few issues while there one of which being a house being constructed next door that we weren't notified of before arriving. The construction disrupted many of my toddler's naps which was unfortunate and made for early awakenings. For a vacation, this was suboptimal. As a previous reviewer commented on, the house is very ""lived-in"" but there was still room for our items and nothing got in the way of our comfort.

Michael was a great host, though, and took care of our problems as soon as he could. If you are looking for a view, this is your place."
859467,6699647,2013-08-21,8144625,Linda,"This was a fabulous place to stay.  In a quiet neighborhood, right on the water, and an amazing view.  Lots of cozy furniture and a deck over the water.  Very relaxing.  I will be back!"
859467,6884893,2013-08-28,7812388,Kevin,"The Good: Great Property, good location, great food choices nearby, absolutely beautiful views from the deck (right on the water), spacious & quick replies from the host.

The Bad: The home had a very bad smell, and was not very clean.
This left us not wanting to return to our suite during the day to even have a nap. We just sort of avoided being there.

I know its harder to keep a place clean when you are right on the water, but this place just needs a deep cleaning to get it up to standards. 

Please Note though: If the host does a major clean ...it still could still be a good place to stay!"
859467,7527242,2013-09-23,2045051,Suzanne,"Hard to describe my stay at Michael's place in Alki Beach....sublime and heavenly don't do it justice!  It's absolutely amazing being so close to the water.  When first sitting up in bed after waking up in the morning and the first thing one sees is the Sound is an incredible way to start the day!  The only problem with the place is that the views are so wonderful that it made me not want to leave the house to explore Seattle!  House is very well equipped and clean and in a lovely location.  West Seattle is a nice alternative to being in the heart of the city....a real beach community feeling, and yet very quickly accessible to downtown.  Overall, a perfect stay."
859467,7804316,2013-10-03,8333499,Tiger,景色太美了，房主也很康慨，友善，非常好
859467,9411314,2013-12-27,10414303,Marissa,"Overall our stay was perfectly lovely. The view truly is incredible and we even spotted some seals from the living room! I do agree with some of the comments regarding cleanliness, even as someone who is quiet accustomed to the beach lifestyle, however this did not negatively impact our experience. I think the host provided exceptional value that resulted in a wonderful stay. He even provided a small Christmas tree for us to decorate, which was a really nice touch. I felt at home to celebrate the holiday in a very special setting!"
859467,9607464,2014-01-03,35892,John,"We really loved this place sooo much. It is right on the water, so we were constantly hearing the waves as well as the ships fog horns in the distance. We had a fire every night. It was difficult to leave to go and explore Seattle. But when we did explore, we always loved returning to our little Beach House. The only thing I would say was a bit disappointing was the construction going on next door. They would start at 7:30 am and would wake us up. And for me, when I am on vacation, I like sleeping late. But other than that, I would go back in a heartbeat."
859467,11244860,2014-03-26,12272094,Wenwen,"We had a pretty good time in this clean and cozy beach house. There are two bedrooms and one bathroom. Perfect for 3 people. Michael just prepared everything you might need during your stay, like dozens of towels, toilet paper, shampoo, and everything you need for cooking.This place is just much better than  any hotel rooms!!"
859467,11697752,2014-04-12,1623331,Jason,"The beach house was beautiful. The views were breath-taking, and we even used the fireplace one night! Michael Joseph was a kind and responsive host. My wife and I had a wonderful time."
859467,11857322,2014-04-17,9381170,Gayle,The location is unbeatable.  Waking up to the view of the Sound will stick with  you for a long time. The host  was very accommodating and responsive.

859467,13976700,2014-06-09,12657039,Allison,"We rented the ""Beach House"" as we were moving out of Seattle and it was a great way to end our stay here. The house is located in a great area and the views can't be beat. Close to downtown and the sights but far enough away you feel like you are away from it all. We walked the dogs every evening on the water front and the sunsets were amazing. There were small things as there are with all vacation rental that could be improved but overall we would highly recommend this property. The only concern which is not the owners issue is if you have small children it may not be the most ""baby proof"" house but we managed. Michael was more than accommodating and helpful. We had a wonderful experience and if we ever get back to Seattle this will be the first place we look to rent. "
859467,14449022,2014-06-19,2287418,Brian,"We had a fantastic time! What a beautiful place this is. It takes about 15-20 minutes to get to the sightseeing areas of downtown, but while you're there it is like your own private island, with the gentle waves lapping at the foot of your bed.

"
859467,15623288,2014-07-13,409912,Susan,Michael Joseph supplied an experience as shown in the photos.  My family had a fantastic time at his home. The view and lapping sounds of the water are priceless.  It was really fun just walking the street admiring the architecture of this dynamic community.  The bottom line on this property is the spectacular view which can be admired from nearly every point in the home.  It was really hard to leave the porch and explore the rest of Alki.  
859467,17044435,2014-08-06,15868439,Sandra,We really enjoyed our stay. It was a challenge leaving the deck (morning and evening). We especially enjoyed the otter neighbor stopping by to say hi. The location was great.
859467,17738386,2014-08-17,5828341,Astrid,"Das Beach House war sehr gut beschrieben und hatte eine tolle Lage. Auch die Nachbarschaft ist absolut sicher und wir hatten eine schöne Zeit dort. Die Aussicht ist traumhaft und man sitzt wirklich direkt am Meer. Wenn man morgens aufwacht und aufs Wasser schaut ist das nur grandios. Und das entschädigt für das schon in die Jahre gekommene Haus. Es ist alles vorhanden was man zum täglichen Leben braucht und auch die Küche ist komplett ausgestattet. Es ist halt ein bewohntes Haus, das vermietet wird und man darf sich nicht an den vielen persönlichen Dingen stören. Es war sauber und das Bett ok.  Alles Gute für Michael"

When I got to Michael's place I just couldn't believe what a difference it was from the first place where I stayed!  The first place was so cold and sterile......whereas Michael's place is warm and homey.    You feel like you're staying in a friend's home.  I've told Michael that his home is probably the place where I feel at my happiest and most at peace.  The views, the serenity, the light.......all sublime and heavenly.  It's an absolutely amazing place!"
859467,21409685,2014-10-16,4857803,Bob,"Yes, it's true. You can hear the water lapping you to sleep, watch the ferries,  and relax at Michael's Alki Beach home. Comfy bed with great pillows, an easy 20 minutes to downtown, with Alki beach village about five minutes away. All for the price of a lower-priced downtown hotel. Great for two people  or two plus a child. Privacy could be an issue for two couples, as the main sleeping area is open to the kitchen and separated only by a privacy screen, but it was perfect for my wife and I. You will need a car, although there is a bus stop across the street. Road noise not an issue. Recommended.  "
859467,21922205,2014-10-26,15564189,Heather,"Michael Joseph was very accommodating. The beach house was clean and the view was amazing. There was a tray with a couple of chocolates on the bed, which I thought was cute. However, I never really could get the heat to work and was cold the whole time. But the TV worked great and the bed was comfortable. 

Unfortunately,  there was a bad storm that night so we lost power for a little while and never got to see the beach.  You definitely need to take a taxi or have a car because it is not close to where the water taxi drops you off.  We ended up getting soaked along with all our luggage walking from the water taxi drop off to a restaurant to call a taxi. This would have been a great place to stay had we had more time and a rental car."
859467,22174650,2014-10-31,12776217,Stewart,Couldn't ask for a better view. Michael was extremely accommodating and a great host. Wonderful experience!
859467,22281646,2014-11-02,14198273,Natalie,"The Alki Beach home is in an absolutely beautiful location, right over the water. It was easy to find and the neighborhood is great - everyone we passed on the sidewalk was really friendly. It was amazing to fall asleep to the sound of the water and the moonlight shining in. 

Michael Joseph was very kind, responsive, and accommodating through the booking process. His instructions were easy to follow and he even left us some beers in the fridge.

After reading reviews of people taking long walks on the beach, we were surprised to find that when we tried to go down to the beach, someone in the basement of the house came out and rather rudely told us we weren't allowed down there. We weren't even aware that people were staying down below as the booking is listed as entire home/apt.

Overall, the location is really incredible and a nice getaway, but it just would have been really nice to get to go down to the beach."

We didn't plan it to be a work/free weekend. Clearly, that  is what happens when we are surrounded by formidable ocean views,  constant wave sounds, cute curious birds, wind & rain.  It was perfect.  MJ's  Place is spacious & bright, it has lots of comfy seating space, a good kitchen and a perfect little patio where we enjoyed a few cold ones.  We loved it, thank you MJ for sharing it with us! :) "
859467,30233192,2015-04-19,29882558,Nick,This place was great for a little family getaway. It was easy to coordinate with Michael Joseph; he was quick about responding and checking in throughout the process. The place is in a great location. Easy access to all things great in West Seattle. Will definitely plan on returning!
859467,31142956,2015-05-02,1535029,Dias,"The place was really nice. It was right on the side of the beach so the view was beautiful. The neighborhood is really clean and quiet. The location is pretty great too, around 10 minutes drive to the shops at alki beach."
859467,31407659,2015-05-04,3700928,Susan,"We had a wonderful stay at Michael's Alki Beach House!  It was just perfect and met all of our needs.  The views as shown in the pictures are stunning!  Upon arrival, we were greeted by a very friendly sea-lion who swam right up to the shore below the outside porch.  We were very fortunate to be there during a full moon and got to experience a ""moonset"" of right out the bedroom window over Puget Sound -  it was breathtaking.  We had perfect weather and could see the snow capped mountains across the Sound every day. We absolutely loved it there and will stay again next time we're in town.  The beach house itself was very comfortable, cozy, and lived-in (in a good way).  If was very personal and not sterile, and was stocked with more than adequate supplies -- plenty of dishes, cooking pots and pans, glasses, etc.  We would have liked to have stayed longer!  Thank you Michael for a great place to relax for a few days!"
859467,31990248,2015-05-12,31962339,Joe,This charming little house was just what I was looking for.  The location was perfect and the view could not be any better.  Everything was in working order and the host was very accommodating.  It is an old house with lots of character and therefore might not be suitable for anyone looking for a new and pristine place to stay.  My wife and I enjoyed it and would stay here again.  The Sunset was amazing!

859467,37307194,2015-07-06,16551349,May,"We enjoyed being right on the water. We saw 2 sea/river otters one night swimming right near the shore! Lots of boats to look at and beautiful sunsets! We were there over July 4th weekend and you could see fireworks from the distance, and one of the neighbors had their own fireworks over the water. The place is only a few minutes from the main beach and close to grocery stores. "
859467,37946187,2015-07-12,245167,Lori,"We loved this place so much. What a great location and value in Seattle. It's about a 20 minute drive to downtown but the view alone is work it. We were also able to walk to a nearby park and saw two bald eagles on our first day. The owner was visiting downstairs and was very nice and personable, letting us check out a bit late so I could shower after a half marathon. The one drawback was communication since the property manager has been ill. But everything worked out well in the end."

The walls are a bit thin, and the tub drain is slow. there is no furniture other than the bed in the room, which is inconvenient, but not a big deal. Otherwise, the room is fine."
4718820,32861425,2015-05-22,33396103,Brandon,"Stayed here for a week, and enjoyed it very much. Augustin and his housemate J are both super cool guys, very accommodating, and made me feel very welcome. The room was very clean, nice, and modern, as was the spa style bathroom. I'd highly recommend!"
4718820,34870906,2015-06-13,32524299,Rui,"First of all,  AUGUSTIN ROCKS!!!!! 

He is an awesome, generous and helpful guy. He picked up me at the airport for free! It's about 30 min drive from his place to the airport. When I arrived at his place, the bed is huge. It's king size, so it's literally huge. And it's super comfortable. The room is also huge. There is a door between bathroom and bedroom, so it's very convenient. 

But there is no desk and chair when I arrived. However, he bought me desk and chair!!! That's one of the reasons why I say he's awesome: he is always responsive to what the guest need, and do it quickly.  What's more, he is very respectful to my privacy. 

He cleaned the sheets, towels and blankets once a week. There is free washing machine and dryer in the room, fussball table, TV, big kitchen, refrigerator in the living room. 

Augustine is also very low profile, he said he practiced boxing, but he never mentioned that he is a boxing champion! 

In sum, my stay at this place is great! It's 3-week long and I really enjoy it. I wish Augustin all the best, and hope the others coming to this place enjoy their stay.     "

4718820,52414912,2015-10-29,44888639,Harry,"I loved staying at this listing. Having never stayed at an Airbnb before I was fairly apprehensive going in, however this listing was above and beyond anything I was expecting. The room was very clean, sheets were freshly washed, and the closet was stocked with anything I could think to need, from extra blankets to a fan in case it got too hot. While I was sharing a bathroom with the other roommate, fighting for bathroom time was never an issue. The bathroom itself was very impressive, it reminded me of a nice hotel, except I have never seen a hotel with a shower that had 2 shower heads, very impressive. The other roommate Jay was very friendly accommodating, always helpful and would even offer me some of the food that he would cook nightly. The owner Augustin was also extremely friendly and accommodating. He would make sure I had everything I needed, and even went so far as to invite me to one of his jiu jitsu classes (I was terrible). Overall I would highly recommend this listing, having not had any experience with Airbnb I'm not sure if this is normal, however I couldn't have asked for a better time "

Jogging/walking distance to the gorgeous Volunteer Park and Conservatory, plus nearby restaurants and bars. My boyfriend and I were in town for a wedding so we didn't get to do as much exploring as we would have liked, but the few places we tried were worth it. Definitely recommend a stay here."
7718203,44345786,2015-08-25,40386495,Kathryn,"Grant's place was absolutely perfect! The apartment is in a great location in Capitol Hill. It was a quick mile walk down to Pike Place Market and only a few blocks to the shopping district. We could have spent the whole visit in just the Capitol Hill neighborhood since there were so many great restaurants and shops. 

The space itself was beautiful. The apartment was spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated. And Grant and Sarah were wonderful hosts. They left a very nice welcome basket with goodies. Our flight was really delayed and Grant was really flexible and accommodating. I really can't say enough great things about this place - it really made our trip to Seattle that much more memorable!"
7718203,45297539,2015-09-01,1634804,Caleb,"Grant's place was absolutely lovely. it is perfectly located to explore the city, wonderfully furnished, and Grant was an absolute peach of a host, leaving me some lovely treats to welcome me to his place. Whenever I next visit Seattle, Grant's apartment will definitely be my first choice."
7718203,46089809,2015-09-07,42548333,Eileen,"Grant made us feel right at home immediately by his quick and ready communication, by catering to our needs, by his thoughtfulness and flexibility, and by his warm welcome that went above and beyond the call of duty. He met us at a nearby coffeeshop and gave us a tour around the place. Walking distance to the city, free street parking overnight after 6 pm, very clean and tidy, nicely decorated, a very comfortable bed and couch, a well stocked kitchen and bath with refreshments, easy check out. Only a few blocks away from the Starbucks Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room too we found out. I would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle."
7718203,47192831,2015-09-16,2860770,Oscar & Brian,"Grant was very accommodating and made us feel very welcomed in his home. His place is located in an excellent neighborhood that is very central to everything Seattle has to offer. The snacks and extra attention to detail were much appreciated. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks, Grant!"
7718203,47831575,2015-09-21,22071561,Jeff,"Grant's place was in a perfect spot for a couple who likes to do some walking. It was about a 20 minute walk to Pike Place and about 25 minutes to the Space Needle. All the restaurants and bars we wanted to go to were only about 10 to 15 minutes walking as well. The area is saturated with Uber drivers and we only had to wait, at most, five minutes for a pickup. 

There was a little hiccup with checking in, but this turned out to be entirely our fault because we couldn't negotiate the door to Grant's place. Since Grant was out of town when we arrived, Grant had us pick up the key from a cafe near the spot and wasn't able to show us firsthand how the door opens. I'm sure you'll be fine, because you're probably pretty smart, unlike us. But if you've got doubts, just ask Grant how the door works ahead of time. He's an expert. 

Once we did get in though, the place was bright and clean and exactly what we expected from the pictures. We were greeted with a basket of snacks and a welcome note with instructions and recommendations. The fridge had drinks and dedicated space for our stuff. 

We appreciated the creature comforts that were made available. Toothpaste, floss, body wash, towels, and most anything you'd need on a quick trip. 

Overall, it was a pleasure to book with Grant and get the opportunity to stay in his apartment for a weekend. We're definitely hoping to stay at his place again when we're back in Seattle. Give this place a look if you're thinking about staying in Capitol Hill.

7718203,51405145,2015-10-19,4232561,Dustin,"My stay at Gran's place was great. He showed up in the middle of a workday to check me in and easily communicated via text. The apartment is easy walking distance to many great restaurants, bars and and easy walk to downtown. Parking is a bit of an issue if you do not know the area but there is a garage nearby for $5/day (Seattle Central College Garage). I'd recommend anyone stay here. "
7718203,56334738,2015-12-12,50310230,Adam,"We had a great time at Grants' place, wonderful location, very hospitable and helpful.  Highly suggested. "
286080,808524,2011-12-27,265973,Sarah,"Great condo - smartly furnished, nice lay-out and fun/helpful amenities like a gym and parking. Perfect locale for doing anything in/around Seattle. Darik and his staff were friendly, helpful and responsive. I would definitely use Darik again!"
286080,936403,2012-02-21,1223231,Peter,"We stayed here with our daughter and her friend.  The place is very well located near downtown and all the sites.  It is spacious and clean and modern.  We were met by a manager when we arrived who explained all the details of the apt., location of pool, where to park etc.  So thus far all is good.

We think someone needs to do some needed handiwork to improve the functionality of this unit & the facility in general.  Need better window shades that roll up smoothly; need hooks to pull curtains back; need to replace or fix all sliding doors in closets and especially the one separating the bedroom from the front room; and need to fix the sauna & jacuzzi as they did not work while we visited."
286080,1283624,2012-05-15,1848900,Matt,"We a had a great time. Fantastic location to downtown Seattle, Pike's Market and ferries.  Weather was perfect. Place was a little noisy with windows open...street activity, but not too bad. Make sure you have a lighter or matches if you use the grills on the 7th floor. ( igniters did't work when we visited)

We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Seattle."
286080,1393537,2012-06-01,2044701,Lisa,"Darik and Sarah handled our reservation with diligence and care. We received multiple reminders and helpful tips, with all the information we could need to make the transaction smooth. The unit was in a great location for our needs in Seattle, it was clean and spacious (though the second bedrom is a bit small), and Darik made sure we were fully aware of all the building's amenities (gym, grilling area, pool) before he left. 

My only small complaint is that it's a bit noisy with street traffic at night. I slept with earplugs in the second night and slept much better.

I would highly recommend this unit to a family or small group  vacationing in Seattle together. Thanks for a wonderful stay in Seattle!"
286080,1937800,2012-08-09,2811696,Charlotte,The reservation was canceled 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
286080,3003983,2012-12-01,4167369,Deborah,"This unit was a great find in an excellent location.  We walked to all the central Seattle tourist spots we wanted to see on our family vacation - Space Needle area, downtown, Pike's Place - and found several good restaurants nearby (try Fish Cake Factory on 4th Ave and Macrina Bakery downstairs).  The kids LOVED the pool and hot tub and we also used the workout room.  The view of the Space Needle from several rooms was a bonus.

Many details made the stay easier: in-unit washer and dryer, shampoo and conditioner, plenty of towels, parking under the building.  Service by Darik and Sarah of Seattle Oasis and Tammy at the building was excellent.  They were very responsive to all our questions before and during the stay.  Everything was clean and in good shape.  This was my first Airbnb rental and it definitely made a good impression."
286080,3069294,2012-12-11,4212987,Ian,Went down for a Seahawks game with some friends.  Place was awesome! Great location.
286080,3194143,2012-12-31,1017322,Paul,"Space was exactly as represented in the airbnb pages. Arrived early and was allowed in no problem, asked for late check out and that was no problem either. Car Park space perfect, not a single problem with anything other than Seattle rain !!!"
286080,3292827,2013-01-06,1902391,Dan,"This is the second time we've stayed in a condo rented out by Darik.

A great stay. Easy check-in procedure, although we liked one of his other condo's that was completely self check-in.

The main bedroom is large and has a great bed. The other bedroom could of had a more comfortable bed and was only separated by 2 sliding doors.

This condo is in a great location, is very clean, and is managed by PROFESSIONALS! Thanks Darik and we look forward to renting from you more in the future."
286080,3499374,2013-02-08,3509209,Aaron,"Great place, clean and convenient! Would definitely stay here again."
286080,3614624,2013-02-26,4535386,Elizabeth,"We loved this apartment.  The location is perfect - you can walk to just about anywhere you want to go - Pike Place, the Space Needle, the Pike-Pine corridor.  It was clean and spacious - just perfect for my husband & I and our adult son.  We didn't cook in the unit very much as we were just there for a long weekend and there are too many excellent restaurants in Seattle, but the kitchen was well equipped.  The bakery on the main floor of the building is a great place for brunch, but be prepared to go early or line up!  We did hang out in the living area at the end of the day which was much nicer than taking two hotel rooms.  Darik was great, he showed us all around and gave tips on what to do in the neighbourhood.  Checking in and out was a breeze.  We'll definitely be back."
286080,3788232,2013-03-15,2287459,Catherine,Charming apartment in the heart of (email hidden)eat view of the Space needle from the balconies. We walked everywhere we wanted to go from the apartment.  Having a washer and dryer was a plus.  
286080,4265581,2013-04-23,3430137,Anna,"Great apartment in a nice location in Seattle (many restaurants and bars in the neighborhood). Easy to walk to the market, downtown and the space needle. The apartment is definately fine for a group of 4, with more people it may get a bit crowded. All is exactly as in the pictures, and both bathrooms and kitchen are convenient and well-maintained. Two comments that may be of use: the mattrasses in both bedrooms have some kind of plastic cover that are not as comfortable (ventilating). Also note that there are only two sets of keys available. Our group was visiting a conference and this was sometimes a bit of a hassle, given that we all came back to the apartment individually. The apartment (or the apartment complex) has no doorbell, so only by texting or calling each other we could open up the door for each other to enter the building. Anyway, it all worked out, but it's something to pay attention to. All in all we really enjoyed our stay!"
286080,4414599,2013-05-04,486709,Laura,"Great place to stay when visiting Seattle.  Wonderful views and easy access to everything.  Everything one could need was supplied in the unit other than your food!  The only drawback was the traffic noise at night.  When you aren't used to it, you hear it all! Thank you Darik for letting us stay!"
286080,4758691,2013-05-24,2202678,Annie,"Space, location and amenities were all spot on.  Great location with parking.  Pool and hot tub were always empty when we used it.  The place was like a 2 bedroom suite in a hotel, but with a fully stocked kitchen.  Would definitely book again!"
286080,4935118,2013-06-03,5392857,Vidya,"We had a fantastic stay in late May. This place was the perfect distance from Pike's Place and the Space Needle, an easy walk to both. Lots of great restaurants and shops in the area, the bakery downstairs was fantastic. The view from the top floor was amazing!! We had plenty of space for all of us and the apartment was super comfortable. Darik made it super easy for us and took us on a tour of the whole building during check in. The pool was incredible as well! Thanks for the wonderful stay!  "
286080,5306402,2013-06-24,2086281,Candice,"We stayed here with another couple last weekend and found this place to be very delightful.  Four of us came to Seattle to do the Rock N Roll 1/2 marathon and were looking for something close to the race start line (Space Needle) as well as close walking distance to The Market and other sites.

Upon our arrival we stumbled across the bakery next door on 1st Avenue, which became our morning routine stop for coffee and pastries (the food is to die for!) as I found out from other visitors reviews. Check in and check out was easy and hassle free and the neighborhood is quaint. Views of the space needle and Elliott Bay were a pleasant surprise from the master bedroom. I will admit that if you aren't use to city street noise this place may not be for you. You can hear a lot of street noise in both bedrooms as you are on the 4th floor and a corner unit.

The condo is perfectly sized for 2 couples, anymore it would be a little cramped. Transportation was easy to get outside either exit on 2nd and 1st Avenue. We used Uber (alternative to a Taxi) to get to further places (Safco Field and REI Flagship Store) and pick up was within minutes. The Monorail to downtown is a 5 min walk and there of plenty of breweries and wine bars in the neighborhood to choose from.

We look forward to coming back and will definitely book with Darik again.

If you are looking for a great place to have brunch/lunch in would recommend Tilicum Cafe (a few blocks away) food is fabulous !!! "
286080,10756389,2014-03-06,5388565,LauraBeth,Great condo! Very clean and great location. Short walking distance to the Space Needle and Pike Place Market. 
286080,11346733,2014-03-31,4405014,Joel,"This apartment was great for our small group. The neighborhood is an awesome, hip oasis in Seattle. The extra bathroom (which, since I paid, was mine) was very useful.  Darik and company were helpful and even let me check in early. I would definitely recommend it to friends. "
286080,12144260,2014-04-24,3970175,Sarah,"All the comforts of home (seriously, down to having shampoo and conditioner, laundry detergent,  etc stocked) in the PERFECT location to all attractions and great eats. Also the in person warm welcome made you feel like you were being well taken care of (NOT just a here's the keys type of deal.)  Thank you for the experience, I will definitely be using Darik and his crew again!  "
286080,22419564,2014-11-05,13138770,Kristian,"Excellent place to stay- well furnished, great spot in Seattle close to most things worth seeing. Notably very close to Seattle Center (Space Needle) and Pike Place Market. 

Very easy check in and out, place was easy to find, included parking spot great bonus. Would definitely stay here again."
286080,24108523,2014-12-20,23567429,Janet,"The apartment was just as described. It was clean and comfortably furnished. The kitchen had everything needed to eat meals in. The washer and dryer was a nice addition.

We were able to check in early. This was appreciated as we were able to park our car.  The car stayed safely parked for our entire visit.

The location was great. Fifteen minutes walk and we were at the Space Needle area with all the museums. 15 figures walking the other direction we were at Pike Place Market.  Tons of places to eat.  The binder with suggestions of things to do and places to eat was very helpful.

Sally explained everything to us when we checked in. check in and check out were both super easy.

I have already recommended this location to friends. Would be happy to stay here again when visiting Seattle."
286080,29367389,2015-04-06,4010246,Hamad,We made the reservation same day and we got a quick reply. The apartment was great and has enough space for the six of us. We liked its location and proximity from the tourist attraction in the city. 
286080,35662359,2015-06-21,32095776,Jim,"We arrived in Seattle called in and we were met by a colleague of Darik's Sarah.  She helped us check in figure out the parking security, internet and answered our questions.  It was welcoming and professional and we couldn't have had a better transition.

The Condominium was well equipped and in a great neighborhood. 

We would recommend the condo, Seattle, and our host/landlord to anyone.

It was a great weekend!
"
286080,37570223,2015-07-08,33828608,Megan,"Our check-in was very smooth. We were greeted by Bruce, who was friendly and professional. He gave us a tour of the building and recommended some good places to eat. The neighborhood has fantastic amenities, and it's hard to imagine a more ideal location - we walked everywhere except to Safeco Field. We appreciated being central to all the places we wanted to see. 
Less ideal: The condo can get uncomfortable in very hot weather, and it's noisy. It is also a little worn looking, not as fresh as the pictures indicate. "
286080,38434855,2015-07-15,37137935,明义,near downtown，a good choice，but，the price vs performance is not so good，this is the first try airbnb，hope airbnb becoming more better
1793138,8392743,2013-10-28,215121,John,"Carol and her husband are friendly and engaging hosts -- it was a pleasure to meet them and stay in their home.  Both rooms are large and comfortable.  The larger room has a wonderful view of the Olympic Mountains and Puget Sound.  The shared bath is large and pleasant.  The house is in a quiet Seattle neighborhood, with quick access to Sunset Park (with its wonderful views) and right above Golden Gardens -- a great place for a swim or a run by the Sound. "
1793138,8588478,2013-11-06,2845486,Gina,"Carol and her husband hosted my father while he was in town to meet his granddaughter. They could not have been lovelier to him!  The house is very nice with beautiful views and the room is great.  My father really enjoyed the neighborhood where he could walk to  coffee and lunch everyday. He raved about how gracious the hosts were and how much he enjoyed the accommodations. We would recommend this place to anyone!

1793138,10055289,2014-01-27,11371308,Abigail,"carol and her husband were wonderful hosts! sweet, informative, and hospitable. especially loved the all-organic food and the tempurpedic shower mat!!!! "
1793138,10512338,2014-02-23,1675991,Marie,"Carol and Bruce were so accommodating and lovely. We loved the view of the sound, the mountains and the sound of seals below the house. The location was perfect for us and very close the the bus line. Meeting Quasar was an extra bonus."
1793138,12036057,2014-04-21,13462814,Alisa,Carol responded immediately when an unfortunate situation left us without a place to stay upon arriving in Seattle. The house is large and beautiful and pretty close to the key bus stations. The room is quaint and comfortable. We really appreciated having breakfast and coffee available in the mornings and our own bathroom to use. The backyard also looks out over Puget Sound and the view is so peaceful and great! Carol and Bruce were very accommodating and willing to answer any questions we had. I especially loved having Quasar the Wonder Dog around!
1793138,12296621,2014-04-28,13665250,Michelle,"We loved our stay with Carol and Bruce.  The home was lovely and the view from our room magnificent.  Carol and Bruce created a very inviting environment with a continental breakfast each morning.  Having use of the mini kitchen items (small fridge, toaster, etc) made it convenient to store some food and enjoy breakfast.  The home is quiet and comfortable and we loved the vibe.  The home is located around the corner from a lovely park with one of the best views of Puget Sound.  We spent our visit walking around the neighborhood and down the hill into the town of Ballard.  Having a separate bathroom for our personal use was also very nice.  They have a very sweet golden doodle named Quasar the Wonderdog who will happily greet you when you arrive.  If driving, there is plenty of parking and the bus stop is right around the corner. "
1793138,20058963,2014-09-22,3608716,Martha,"Easy communication with Carol, a lovely view and home, they even gave us some veggies from the garden!"
1793138,20717527,2014-10-04,1145250,Sanketh,"Carol and Bruce are excellent hosts.

They have a lovely home, with a beautiful view of the Puget Sound. The beach is a short walk / drive away.

Their home is about a hour's drive from the airport in commute-time traffic, and about 35 mins otherwise.

Carol got in touch with me before my trip and was kind enough to arrange a breakfast of my preference for the one day I was staying with them. The room was cozy, and the bed was comfortable. They also have a very friendly dog, who I wish I had more time to play with."
1793138,20960803,2014-10-08,16969603,Bella,"The room is indeed cozy as well as blissfully quiet. Carol took great pains to make me feel welcome, and to explain everything about the neighborhood, my room and breakfast options. The house motto should be ""If we don't have it, you don't need it."" Because there was everything imaginable, from soaps and shampoos to powdered cinnamon for my oatmeal. Plus Quasar the Wonder Dog, whose only fault is that he won't play fetch."
1793138,30840538,2015-04-27,70666,Cherilyn,"I would highly recommend staying with Carol. Very comfortable room, great location, nice breakfast with fresh fruit, cereal etc. Carol is a gracious host and I would stay here again. It's a good location if you have a car, close to Ballard restaurants, Golden Gardens and Shilshole. "
1793138,47497755,2015-09-19,17819195,Derek,"I found it to be a real pleasure to stay there - the hospitality and
breakfast delightful! "
1793138,47754534,2015-09-21,20435363,Christian,Very friendly reception. Great location. I enjoyed the discussions.
1793138,49902361,2015-10-07,7082376,Friederike,"I had a wonderful stay at Carol's B&B in Ballard, Seattle. She is very friendly, nice and open and made me feel welcome from the start with all important information ready upon my arrival. I was also greeted by the family's very friendly and goof natured dog.
 Because there were no other guests expected I got a free upgrade to the more spacious room with a gorgeous see view I enjoyed very much during breakfast. 
All facilities were in good shape an clean. The breakfast was very good too with fresh fruits, cereals, toast, milk etc.
The neighborhood is a very calm one, with the sea near by, nice little shops and also a very good organic supermarket (Sunsethill Green market).
I can definitely recommend this place! Thank you very much again, Carol!!"
4566609,23462394,2014-12-01,23723979,Phuong,The location is pretty good. 20 minute walk to downtown. The room is a really nice experience in an old-style apartment. 
4566609,24033920,2014-12-17,12131606,Bryan,"Alex was an excellent host. She was able to accommodate our irregular arrival and departure times. Great communication made everything a lot easier as well. The apartment is in a really cool end of town, lots of great bars and its only a short walk down town. The actual apartment was really clean and looks exactly like the pictures. I would recommend this place to everyone and would stay again!"
4566609,25312291,2015-01-12,23592876,Polly,"Alex's place is so cute and lovely! The place was very clean and located in a great part of town. Everything we needed was well within walking distance. Loved the bed, which was big enough to fit two people. Alex seemed a bit busy and hard to contact at first but was very attentive once we got there. Overall we had a great stay. She was so friendly and kept us updated on when we could meet. Would definitely stay again!"
4566609,28448155,2015-03-23,29482485,Hillel,Place was prepared for our stay. Alex was friendly and made sure we had all information necessary for the trip. The place was as pictured. Cute minimalist/industrial hipster design and decor. 
4566609,29571689,2015-04-09,4901021,Andrea,"Perfectly adequate apartment in a premium location. Neatly kept; good bed. We really appreciated being so close (one block away) to a grocery store and pharmacy and found it easy to walk downtown, to transit, and to a couple different areas of Capitol Hill. Those who need quiet should be pleased with this place. It's on the back corner of the building and while there was the occasional noise from the hallway, it was all within the realm of normal apartment living, and we found the building residents respectful of sleeping hours. Nice big windows you can open and close to fit your fresh air needs, with venetian blinds you can adjust for your desired ratio of light to privacy. Wifi provided by the building is pay-to-access and device-specific; it's also pretty patchy in the apartment, but it's good enough. Alex communicated clearly with us and responded promptly when we had questions. She even provided us with a list of recommendations for restaurants and bars in the neighbourhood. Would stay again."
4566609,29980996,2015-04-15,9444005,Josh,Alex's apartment was perfect for our visit to Seattle. We spent most of our day time at the Convention Center which was a convenient walk and there was always plenty nearby to entertain us by night. Her communication was always prompt and exact. The description of the apartment was on point and as a bonus she has a great collection of vinyl for the time you're around the apartment. 
4566609,32214388,2015-05-15,25766537,Matthew,"Alex has a very cool little place. Communication with her was very good as well. I'm not certain her place is ready for ""prime time"" yet but I would consider staying there again baring some improvements. The shower didn't really work; specifically, the hot water just trickled out. She lists Wifi as one of the amenities in the listing, but it is Wifi that you have to pay for and even still, it doesn't work very well. With that said, listing Wifi as an amenity and not having free Wifi is like listing Transportation as an amenity and then providing guests with a pamphlet for Taxi service upon arrival. Considering some hotels do this, it would be unfair to say that it is entirely inappropriate. Almost all the reviewers mention how clean the place was, but I didn't have that experience at all. Maybe I came on a bad week. Otherwise, she provided things like soap and clean towels and such which was nice. I really liked the overall decorum and style of the place. With some improvements it could be a pretty nice place to stay."
4566609,32373509,2015-05-17,26703080,Adrian,Super rad spot. Wish there was wifi!
4566609,33245531,2015-05-26,25150884,Elizabeth,"Place was good, it's an older building, so lots of creaks, thin walls, draft-y room. There is street parking all over (2 hour limits for the pay by spots from 7-6PM Mondays-Saturdays). The shower pressure/temperature isn't the greatest... either pressure or warm (email hidden)n't have both. 

Messaged the host about 2/3 weeks regarding parking--no response. 
Called/texted/messaged the host the day of check-in ---no reply/response.
Called AirBnB to contact the host---literally 10 minutes after calling AirBnB, she texted back... Seemed a little sketchy but at least we had somewhere to stay."
4566609,35302083,2015-06-17,28188145,Julie,"The fresh flowers were great, the apartment was just as it was described. I really loved the neighborhood most of all. There were a bunch of fun bars and restaurants. The only negative is the wifi did not work as I had seen other guests had commented about a similar issue. "
4566609,35606534,2015-06-20,33473313,Zachery,"Overall, it was a grrat place to stay. Nice and close to downtown which was perfect. Only downfall is that the building is a bit older. (Which she does mention in the description.) Alex was accommodating and always responded promptly to any message I sent to her. "
4566609,36086340,2015-06-25,6009664,Love,"We arrived and everything was just as Alex noted I her detailed welcome email. We had no problem getting in or finding the studio. The Internet was a bit of an issue as you must pay to use it and it was not very good service. The studio is in a great area of town, Capitol Hill and all the amazing restaurants around. Good stay, we will stay again when we are back in Seattle. "
4566609,36376456,2015-06-28,30597719,Jenna,"The place was exactly as described. Rather old building with thin walls, but it was quite and clean. Like others have said, the wifi didn't work (though we didn't spend too much time investigating why). The best part is its location, and the local bars/restaurants are all so close. 

Alex was super nice and easy to communicate with. She was very fast to text back and clear with expectations. "
4566609,36727477,2015-06-30,7066547,Joseph,The photos and description show exactly what the apartment is like.  Alex had great communication about procedures and was available by email when I needed to communicate.  The apartment is in a fantastic location close to great Seattle sights.  
4566609,40785373,2015-08-02,36301606,Drew,"Cute little studio in the middle of everywhere you'd like to walk to. Alex had some awesome local recommendations (Comet, Mamas Pizza, Glos). A gorgeous city and a nice place to come back to after a long day of walking."
4566609,42251207,2015-08-12,22266451,Brent,"Alex was very nice, provided some great information on the area, and even called me once my plane had landed to help me with directions.  Check-in was very easy and Alex was friendly.

The apartment itself is as photographed, and the location is unbeatable.  Just over a block away from a supermarket as well as tons of bars, restaurants, coffee shops, etc.  It was really great.

My two complaints: the wi-fi was a little slow, and Alex was unreachable by phone when I had a question about check out on the day-of."
4566609,42723955,2015-08-15,38611114,Rob,"Alex was great with communicating with us, she even let us know the unit was ready early. Good location and the unit was clean. 

Building is old, as stated.  Could be Shabby/Chic if fixed up but is only shabby. 

Security door is nice but side door was left propped open most of the time. Also a homeless(?) person was hanging out on the front steps our first night when we returned.

The unit is badly in need of TLC. "
4566609,43360377,2015-08-19,29806469,Mattias,"This is a great place to stay in Seattle. Close to cool restaurants and bars in pike/pine area and 10-15min walk to downtown.
The apartment was as discribed and very clean."
4566609,43828113,2015-08-22,31148887,Alexandra,"Just as others have said, the space was just like the pictures and communicating with Alex was very simple and straightforward. The location was perfect for hanging out in capital hill and we couldn't have been happier with the experience."
4566609,45195073,2015-08-31,10284464,Thomas,"Location is a small but very comfortable studio in a great part of town. Alex is responsive to questions and sends great information on walkable activities. Bed / Kitchen Areas were clean. Sink in the bathroom was clean but the tub needed a scrub and old shower curtains had some mold growing around the bottom. Biggest other was Internet, which you (1) have to pay for (2) is terribly slow and unworkable. Overall if you need quiet or Internet for your travel you won't be pleased but a perfect fit if you need a place to stay for a night you plan on hitting the town. "
4566609,45365088,2015-09-02,12643917,May,"Finding parking around Alex's place was a little bit tricky, but other than that and the slow internet, it was a breeze.  Alex gave easy instructions to get inside the apartment. Mostly quick responses, although she wasn't reachable on the check-out day.  The listing is as described, old apartment, but great location and lots of suggestions on things to check out in the area from Alex.  Would recommend."
4566609,46121007,2015-09-08,2687204,Amanda,"The place was exactly as described! I loved the location as it was super easy to get to all the bars on capital hill. Very simplistic type place, so if you're pretty much just looking for a place to sleep, this is it. Only problem was Alex wasn't entirely responsive via text but it all worked out in the end. Would recommend."
4566609,49629455,2015-10-05,39821363,Brendan,"The place was exactly as Alex described and in a fantastic location, walking distance to Pike Place, downtown area and Capitol Hill. The place is pretty cozy as previous commenters noted, but for the price and the spot, it was exactly what we needed. Alex was very helpful with places to check out and see. The wifi didn't work, but we used a hotspot. "
4566609,51608824,2015-10-22,38771970,David,"After two good experiences with Airbnb this was not a good one.  The entire place was filthy, including spoiled food in the refrigerator and grit in the bathroom.  There was no stopper for the sink to wash dishes and there was only one working bare light bulb in the main room (a second bulb came on unexpectedly a few days later).  The Wifi didn’t work despite numerous attempts. There was no comfortable place to sit.  I wonder if the place would even met Airbnb minimum requirements."
4566609,52104412,2015-10-26,30667888,Kayla,"This studio is such a great value!  My partner and I were very comfortable here for the weekend.  The location is awesome a the bed is really comfy. It was very clean and well maintained.  The decor was minimal yet artistic.  We will definitely book it again given the opportunity.
I had a couple of questions throughout the weekend and Alex was super prompt/friendly in responding."
3354761,16436964,2014-07-27,12947349,Marc,"Janyce was very friendly and accommodated us very well in a basement suite with private bathroom given that we were a travelling family. The check-in and check-out process was efficient. The room offered basic amenities like a micro-wave oven, cutlery, flat screen TV and cable, and access to a separate fridge.  Janyce provided us with snacks, DVDs and many refreshments. The house and surrounding were very quiet. We felt very comfortable and secure. 

The house is located in a very nice neighbourhood of Seattle, a few minutes walk from several parks (including Discovery Park) with breathtaking vistas. While there is access to a public transit, we really needed the car to enjoy good restaurants, cafés, etc.  "
3354761,16684255,2014-07-31,18364331,Dmitriy,"My wife and I along with our two year old stayed at Janyce's place. We absolutely loved the neighborhood.  Janyce was a very welcoming host and made it easy for us to come and go as we explored Seattle.  Her special touches of flowers by the entry and drink/ snacks was perfect, especially with a two year old.  Would definitely recommend.  "
3354761,17001242,2014-08-05,10896167,Olivia,"The view in this place is unbelievable. Janyce met us when we arrived and helped us get settled . She had stocked the fridge with a few welcome items. She was very accommodating.

The room was very clean and nice but I would say it is more of a large room with beds rather then an ""entire home.""  You enter through the garage and there are other renters upstairs. It is a great place to stay for a family vacation or with close friends, but we used it for work and it was a little less private than we had hoped.

Overall, it was a great experience, but I was a little confused by this being an ""entire house"" listing. It is a great place to visit and the area is easy to access and once you arrive you could just stay and look at the view all day."
3354761,17870343,2014-08-18,5523266,Shakira," think that the advertisement is a little deceptive because it is not a 3 bed 2 bath at all and instead should be advertised as a studio with additional pullout beds. Also, should be advertised that there is no kitchen and you can only use the kitchen or upstairs living space if no one is renting the top AND you are okay with the host being there as well. Way too expensive for what you get but here is a run-down of our review below:

Host: Janice was very nice and accomodating though she does live in the house (top floor) so if you want more of a quiet and secluded type of get away this is probably not your rental. She was very involved with us and we saw her quite a lot though she was very nice and helped us whenever we needed it.

Location: Mixed- close to discovery part but there is really no food, grocery, bars, etc within short walking distance. We still walked to get breakfast a few times in central magnolia but about a 20-25 min walk one way

Accomodation: NOT WHAT WE EXPECTED OR AS ADVERTISED. There were 3 couples and we were under the impression that there are three bedrooms and 2 baths. Instead, we stayed in the basement/ground floor of the house, there is one LARGE room with two beds (one is a full one is an AIR mattress) with a couch in the middle and one bathroom. There is NO KITCHEN or area to really cook or make food though Janyce did provide us with a coffee pot and microwave as well as dished. ALSO she charges extra for a separate room on the same floor which has a non-functional bathroom (there is a sink that doesnt work and there is a urinal...yep a urinal). Overall, way too overpriced for what you get and not what is adverstised

I think that the advertisement is a little deceptive because it is not a 3 bed 2 bath at all and instead should be advertised as a studio with additional pullout beds. Also, should be advertised that there is no kitchen and you can only use the kitchen or upstairs living space if no one is renting the top AND you are okay with the host being there as well"
3354761,18813151,2014-09-01,19044696,Alexandra,Great place to stay! Close to the city and a comfortable spot! 
3354761,22923358,2014-11-17,23370025,Ioana,"Janyce's place was as described - and I do recommend reading the description, as it becomes obvious you will mainly have access to a (a very nice) room and the basic kitchen utilities.
On my arrival there were some complications with the other guests, as they wanted to stay longer, but Janyce found a solution that went very well for all of us. 
The location is very near the Exploratory Park, the views are breathtaking. If like me, depend on the bus, download any of the free apps on your phone to make it easier to schedule your day.  
All in all, a great rental, and a very nice and welcoming host. 
"
3354761,25237266,2015-01-10,13831703,Phil,"My parents stayed here for a few days - comfortable, clean, great central location.  Jan was easy to work with and very hospitable.  Will use her again!  Thanks."
3354761,26192419,2015-02-06,9681765,Drew,"I reserved the bottom floor apartment for 10 nights. I had no trouble parking my car each night (for free!!!) on the street directly in front of the house. Convenient entry to and from the apartment through the garage. 

The apt is an efficiency-type space with with living room area in the center that separates the two beds. There is a flat screen tabletop TV with cable and a couple of movie channels. WiFi was great and without any complication. 

The apt space has a microwave/toaster-oven kitchenette with dishes and washtub. There is a full-sized refrigerator right outside the apt in the garage. Even though the kitchenette is not set up for traditional cooking, I prepared meals in the microwave each night, ate well, and felt right at home utilizing the nice silverware and dishes. Two wine glasses also are provided.  

There is a very nice full bathroom with roomy standup shower and pedestal sink, hooks to hang wet towels, and space for personal items. There's also a walk-in closet with hangers and plenty of room to store luggage. Bed #1 is also on this side of the room. 

Bed #1 is very comfortable. The flannel cotton sheets and down comforter, along with the abundance of soft and cushy pillows (I used pillows from Bed #2, as well) are ideal for a deep sleep. I slept so well! I never slept on Bed #2, but I can confirm that it has four soft pillows. 

After some responsible due diligence on Jan's part as a homeowner and mine as a renter, my dog was welcomed for the duration of my stay. 

Jan is a hospitable host and encourages communication no matter how minor the need may be. Not even her trip to the Super Bowl kept her from remaining conscientious and responsive. Jan's unique way of being totally available for anything I needed yet respectful of my privacy and autonomy all while providing an accommodation in, hands down, one of the most beautiful neighborhoods in Seattle, (and free parking, location location location), is what makes this the perfect place to stay in Seattle for a home-away-from-home vibe near the center of it all in the most dynamic city in the world!! 
"
3354761,30000574,2015-04-15,2277497,Raghu,"Jan's house was spacious, welcoming, and well decorated. We rented all three floors, and had plenty of space for our group of 6. The house is close to discovery park, and you can enjoy some great urban hikes without having to drive. "
4053644,20048375,2014-09-22,9349274,Albert,"Great location centrally located in all of what Seattle has to offer! It was a short walk to Pike Place Market, the Seattle Center, and pretty much all small shops or restaurants in Downtown. Zipcars, the Link Light Rail, and buses are all close as well if you want to go further. 

Meg's place is amazing, and it's filled with lots of natural light and is incredibly spacious. Her service and hospitality during our stay is definitely one of the highlights of our trip. Book her place for your next trip to Seattle!"
4053644,20518322,2014-09-30,6513216,Emily,"Meg's apartment is right in the middle of everything, so it's great walking distance. It's a little noisy at night outside, but it's right on the transportation lines so you also have easy access to that. We had a great stay!"
4053644,21256505,2014-10-13,22217314,Caroline,Meg's apartment is great! It is very centrally located and you could walk to Pike's Place Market and the Space Needle. Lots of restaurants and things to see in the area. The apartment was very clean and the building was nice. 
4053644,33269846,2015-05-26,9970566,Christy,"The location of Meg's apartment is great; walking distance to many of the great things Seattle has to offer.  Apartment was just what we needed and then some.  We went out to eat each night, but if we had wanted, we would have been able to pick up fresh fish at Pike Place Market and cook in the kitchen!"
4053644,36020459,2015-06-24,32795794,Jason,Place was fantastic and completely as advertised. Host uses (website hidden) but the listing doesn't say that at this time.
8035212,45203631,2015-08-31,41820365,Christopher,"Unbelievable location at an affordable rate one block south of Pike Place, and 10 minute walk to the Washington Convention Center. It was mind boggling how close we were to everything. Not much interaction with the host aside from the key exchange, but everything was handled correctly. The studio had a Queen bed, fold out futon, full bath, full kitchen, and free in unit washer and dryer, and is located in a complex with a full communal patio out looking the ocean.

The host went above and beyond to provide us with amenities around the apartment such as umbrellas (a must for Seattle), extra tooth brushes, soap, shower items, towels, toilet paper, hair dryer, ext.

Amazing experience, amazing view, amazing city. Well worth the price."
8035212,46640823,2015-09-12,42326257,Jonathan,"Ryan was very welcoming and accommodating when our travel plans were changed beyond our control.  He welcomed us and explained in detail all the workings of getting in and out, using the roof and the apartment.  The apartment was clean and matched the description and photos and more than adequate for our needs.  Great central location.  Would definitely stay again if back in Seattle."
8035212,47117979,2015-09-15,43727769,Louie,"My experience at this apartment was great. It was clean and perfect. Stayed right by everything, there's a lot of walking but it's worth it. If I had to travel to Seattle again, I would stay here.  "
8035212,47529738,2015-09-20,43219415,Robbie,"Ryan was an excellent host, he met us right outside the security door and even carried my luggage up the stairs! He explained everything and took his time.  He gave us pointers and locations to visit, very helpful.  Loved the place and had a great view overlooking the Ferris wheel a focal point in Seattle.   The proximity is excellent so close to Pikes Market place, blocks to the original Nordstrom and Starbucks."
8035212,48741178,2015-09-28,18945418,Matt,"Ryan's apartment was just what my weekend stay in Downtown Seattle called for. The building features a beautiful rooftop patio, which, along with the apartment itself, offers an amazing view of Seattle's Waterfront Park and ""Great Wheel,"" and, of course, the ocean. Located just one block away from Pike Place Market and nearby several convenient public transportation options, the location really cannot be beat.

Ryan was very welcoming and took his time explaining all of the ins and outs of the building. The apartment is stocked with all of the amenities you might expect to find at a hotel, and then some. Both the apartment's queen bed and fold out futon are bit more on the firm side, which may be relevant to you, depending on what your preferences are. Additionally, the apartment is within proximity of a freeway that gets its fair share of traffic, so the building was a bit noisier than I might have expected or hoped for. But, I'm a pretty light sleeper, so it's possible that I'm just a bit more sensitive to that kind of thing. Regardless, it's a great little spot in an unbeatable location."
8035212,49652108,2015-10-05,43193862,Daphne,"Great location with nice view of the bay. The apartment looks exactly like the pictures.  I would have preferred the apartment to be more clean.  When we arrived, Ryan was still getting things ready for us.  There were still towels in the dryer and the sheets were in the washer.  I thought this should have been done prior to our arrival since I booked a few weeks in advance.  After flying all day, I didn't feel like finishing up the laundry, although having a washer/dryer was convenient.  I also booked this apartment since it had a full kitchen.  However, the kitchen was not clean and disposal didn't work (the sink smelled like cabbage when I ran the water), stove top, microwave, and dishwasher had food & grease residue on them, and there were coffee grounds still in the coffee pot from a previous user. I didn't feel like cleaning the kitchen from another person's mess, so we ended up eating out or ordering in.  My recommendation to the host is to have a cleaning service clean in between bookings, have the carpet cleaned to remove the carpet stains, and add a small dining table or place to sit down to eat (other than the futon that is also used as a bed).  This place has potential if these things were done."
8035212,50035925,2015-10-08,4921403,Anders,"Ryan was very punctual with coordinating the key drop off and showing me the apartment. Pictures were very acurate and the place was clean and well maintained.  I would definitely stay here again, without thinking twice. Great overall experience, however, I was traveling for business and had no time to enjoy the city.  The location is perfect for visiting Seattle as it is close to everything!"
8035212,50502655,2015-10-12,3163470,Tony,"Ryan was a great host. He met us and explained the ins and outs of the building, the apartment and the area. The location is perfect, great, stupendous and all kinds of good things. Would definitely stay there again."
8035212,50903132,2015-10-15,44286055,Lisa Marie,"My sister and I loved the convenient location and the bed was so warm and comfy. Ryan was punctual and full of great info for us about the local places. There is a washer and dryer in the unit and a full kitchen. The views of the Ferris wheel and the sunsets are beautiful as the unit has a good number of windows. Thank you Ryan, we'll be back. 8-) "
8035212,51181592,2015-10-18,12880743,Alan,Ryan's place was great. The place was centrally located in Downtown Seattle and he was great explaining things for us. Next time we go to Seattle I will try to get this place again!
8035212,51574562,2015-10-21,28836814,Matthew,"This is the perfect apartment in a prime location.  Located steps away from Pike's Place, this apartment checks all the boxes.  We were greeted by Ryan and he was so nice, showing us the ins and outs of the apartment, as well as a few pointers on where to go within the city.  To me, out of all the apartments I stayed in, I really felt at home here.  I would definitely recommend staying here and if I'm ever back in Seattle hopefully this apartment is available to rent again!"
8035212,52361602,2015-10-28,1700059,Bolek,"Arrival was pleasant and problem free despite my delay thanks to Ryan's accommodativeness. The place was easy to find and is located as central as it gets, a great launch-pad for seeing Seattle. The apartment is clean and exactly as described, providing all that one needs. The internet is fast and the view of the ferris wheel and waterside certainly makes you feel you're staying in Seattle. I wouldn't hesitate to stay with Ryan during my next trip. "
8035212,53099504,2015-11-04,679048,Lacy,"What an awesome check off the ol'bucket list! Staying literally in the heart of Pikes Place has been a dream of mine since I was a kid. Great apartment, easy check in, amazing location, clean, affordable! Wow."
8035212,53273998,2015-11-07,46976065,Brendan,Ryan made us feel incredibly welcome upon our arrival to Downtown Seattle. He quickly and efficiently told us everything we needed to know about the studio and also informed us of some general useful information about how to get around the area we found ourselves in. The studio itself was incredibly well maintained and all of the amenities one could expect where provided. 
8035212,53538365,2015-11-09,31554698,Miguel,"Incredible location right next to the Four Seasons and an amazing view of the ferris wheel from bed or couch. One of the building exits is practically the entrance to Pike Place Market, you're a 3 second walk from the gum wall. The listing was extremely accurate and I was shown around the apartment and they really made you feel comfortable."
8035212,53771437,2015-11-12,21617365,Nic,This place is awesome! Ryan was an excellent host and the place is even better. Perfect location. Perfect apartment. 
8035212,53920322,2015-11-14,48118752,Chris,"The place was wonderful. Prime location for eating, sight seeing...Ryan was very helpful. The view is amazing and possibly undersold and the shower is fantastic.

Would visit again."
8035212,54127263,2015-11-16,39732251,Simran,"My husband and I stayed here for a weekend visit. Ryan was prompt to respond to questions before the trip, and met us outside the building, showed us the place and gave recommendations on places to go. The space itself was just as advertised- right at the heart of the market and very nice and clean. Thanks Ryan!"
8035212,54406714,2015-11-19,1541280,Ka,"Ryan was very helpful in providing directions and recommendations for local restaurants. 

Long before Airbnb existed I have opted for apartments instead of hotels, and have enjoyed each experience from the U.S. to Europe to Asia. I am sorry to say this was the first time I regretted my choice.

While I expected a simple, no-frills apartment, I was disappointed to find many of the most basic amenities missing including comfortable pillows (ie. good condition) and bedding, hand soap in the bathroom and kitchen, matching towels, clear instructions for accessing the wireless network, etc. 

The apartment reminded me of a college dorm room. 

For the price point, you would be better off booking a 2-3 star hotel. 
 "
8035212,54542442,2015-11-21,30067460,Christopher,This place was really great. First airbnb stay and it couldn't have been easier. Kitchen is full of utensils and things one will need if planning to cook. Very comfortable bed! Netflix on the tv. Great location! Walked everywhere. I'd stay here again no problem!
8035212,54765445,2015-11-23,28723906,Michelle,Ryan was really friendly when I met him to pick up the keys. He was thorough in showing me all the amenities in the apartment and gave a few recommendations on where to eat/explore in Seattle. The apartment is located in the most convenient location between the pier and Pikes market.  I definitely enjoyed my stay 
8035212,55278056,2015-11-29,235863,Jordan,"As others have already mentioned, Ashley & Ryan's AirBnB is a really great value for the money. Perfect location for exploring downtown -about a 30 second walk to Pike Place. The unit itself is perfect as well - comfortable, has all of the amenities you'll need, and has a beautiful view of the water and Seattle Great Wheel.  

Ryan met us when we arrived and showed us everything we needed to know. Communication throughout the entire process was seamless and they made getting in and out extremely easy for us. Would definitely stay here again.
"
8035212,55677107,2015-12-04,49178273,Javen,"The apartment was in an amazing location, super clean, with a great view. "
8035212,55957210,2015-12-07,49460582,Tom," The place was exactly as advertised.    Spotlessly clean,  and well stocked with kitchen items, books, and games.   We spent most of our weekend exploring Seattle and the Market, but we were always happy to come back and take our shoes off.   Ryan responded promptly to our communications and answered all of our questions.  We would definitely stay here again!"
8035212,56165665,2015-12-09,19833842,Patrick,"Great apartment all around. Central location with a great view. A minute away form Pike Place Market, 15 minute walk to Capitol Hill. Hosts made it easy to communicate with and meet up to get the key. "
8035212,56395952,2015-12-13,48691247,Taylor,"Ryan & Ashley were extremely accommodating, friendly, and provided a well located spot for a perfect Seattle trip. We arrived on a late flight from NYC, but Ryan met us with zero complaint. The space was in a great location right next to Pike Place Market and was cleaned of any personal items, so that we never felt like we were invading someone's home. This was my first Airbnb experience, so I was not sure how it would go. I must say that Ryan was the perfect host and has really sparked our interest in Airbnb. I highly recommend this spot and can't thank Ryan & Ashley enough! "
8035212,56788173,2015-12-18,48626249,Katy,"Ryan was a great host. He went out of his way to let us check in early and gave us some great tips for where to go. The bed was also extremely comfy! The location didn't get any better with pike place market right next door and the view of the water/Ferris wheel was incredible. We were able to walk to every attraction we wanted to do including the space needle, Aquarium, and Olympic sculpture park. Overall would highly recommend, we would stay again in a heartbeat!"
8035212,56931154,2015-12-20,29712394,Paige,"It's an awesome location! Easy to find & has a very nice view overlooking Seattle Great Wheel & the waterfront. It's steps away from Pike Market & aquarium. Ryan was very flexible on the check in when our flight was delayed by 1 hr.  He waited for us by the apt & gave us a very thorough walk thru of the place, & pointers of where to explore."
8035212,57136662,2015-12-22,48632933,Dana,"Ryan met us at a pre-determined spot, and showed us the apartment.  He shared a lot of information about the area, and had a great map on the wall by the front door.  He was also very happy to answer questions or try to find items that weren't in the apartment.

The apartment was as described in the listing.  The location is fantastic for a downtown Seattle experience.  It was a 5 minute walk (or less) to the aquarium and even closer to Pike Place Market.  There is a Whole Foods Market, a 10 minute walk away at the corner of Westlake Ave and Denny Way.

We used the light rail from the airport which was easy and only a few blocks from the apartment."
8035212,57569883,2015-12-27,50218985,Kyle,Perfect location. Clean and suited with all the necessities. 
8035212,58196304,2016-01-01,1362625,Ron And Judy,Ryan's apartment was perfect for our 2 night stay and we are only sorry that we couldn't linger longer. Ryan was a good communicator and the location is very central with a good view of the waterfront. Easy access from the airport via the Sky Rail. We would definitely recommend this listing.
6278191,32649159,2015-05-19,33144536,Alexander,Had a great time at the apartment. Great location and Carlos was very accommodating.  
6278191,32857095,2015-05-22,24673112,Molly,Carlos apartment was very clean and in walking distance to everything. We had some trouble getting in touch via his cell phone but he was immediately responsive via air bnb. Would recommend this listing!!
6278191,33017654,2015-05-24,3312654,Diane,"We had a great stay in Carlos's Belltown studio. He was very accommodating with our early arrival and was available by phone whenever we needed something. The location is great and was such a great base for us to explore the Space Needle, Pike's Place and all of the other fun attractions that Seattle has to offer. The photos actually don't do this place justice. It's very cute and quaint and even nicer in person.  There were great restaurants within walking distance. We had a wonderful stay. Thank you Carlos for your hospitality."
6278191,33833715,2015-06-01,12846164,Gus,"We loved our stay at Carlos' studio apt in Seattle.  It is a beautiful place, well furnished, in a nice, secure building.  The neighborhood is fantastic - lots of great little restaurants and bars close by, with a drug store across the street and small grocery a couple of blocks away.  Location can't be beat - very close to Seattle Center and Space Needle and easy walking distance to Pike's Market and downtown.  Convenient to public transit too.  Carlos was gracious host and made us feel very welcome, even giving us some great restaurant suggestions.  We would definitely stay here again.  "
6278191,34324147,2015-06-07,12989093,Dan,"Carlos was very welcoming and ensured that we made it to the apartment.  By the way, his studio was spotless.  There were plenty of towels available as well as the usual shampoo and conditioner but what was surprising was the hairspray, shaving cream, and toothpaste as well.  You can tell that Carlos really cares about being hospitable.

The location was excellent with easy access to the Space Needle and Pike Place Market.  There was a Pronto bikeshare station one block away which was easy to use.  

We would not hesitate to stay at Carlos's place again."
6278191,34723622,2015-06-11,26561000,Kyle,"Our stay in Seattle was excellent. Carlos helped make our first trip to Seattle and first time using AirBnb a great experience. He was easily available via phone, text, or email. His place had all the necessities to feel ""at home"". "
6278191,34972355,2015-06-14,14945322,Arcelia,"We had a great experience with this reservation. The location of the unit was superb. The unit was clean and spacious, and had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable.We were in town for the Rock n Roll marathon and this location was ideal for the start and finish line. Neighborhood was cute and walkable. Short walk to the Space Needle, close to downtown and the waterfront. We had great dinners within walking distance. I highly recommend staying here! "
6278191,35803823,2015-06-22,16015950,Bridget,"This was our first AirBNB experience, and I thought it was perfect for our trip. I didn't actually get to meet Carlos, but we were able to get into the building & apartment easily.  The apartment was very clean & accurately described.  It was a perfect location for us - inbetween the Pike Market Place (about 10 minute walk) and the Space Needle (about 5 minute walk), and close to many restaurants, bars, and a grocery store.  The Belltown Area is nice - we did hear from a few locals that you need to be careful around some blocks at night, but we felt safe the entire time.  We really appreciated Carlos' flexibility with allowing us to check-out late given our later flight time.  Overall, we were very pleased."
6278191,37746692,2015-07-10,32791457,Cheryl,"The apartment was very nice, it had every thing we needed for a perfect stay in Seattle. Carlos was very prompt with any questions we had, check in/out was easy.  The location is within walking distance to almost anything downtown Seattle has to offer.  If you have a vehicle prepare to pay for parking a minimum of $25 per day and a spot to park maybe 3-4 blocks away. "
6278191,38841054,2015-07-19,10682437,Dean,"Carlos' communication was very good, the apartment is as described and the location is excellent right in the middle of Belltown"
6278191,39280199,2015-07-22,5507558,Steve & JoLea,"The rental was in a great location - 10 min walk to Seattle Center and Space needle and 20 min to the downtown area and Pike Place.  The neighborhood felt safe and inviting.  There are several nice restaurants just around the corner.  We liked the gritty 5 Point Cafe.  There's a Rite-Aid right across the street for sundry or grocery items.  Accommodations were clean and comfortable.  There must be a fire station nearby, or the street is a main emergency vehicle route, as we heard several sirens each night we were there.  A minor nuisance but not a deal breaker.  I'd recommend not bringing a car as on street parking is only 4 hours and long term lots are expensive.  We ended up paying $60 to park our car for 2 days, which we didn't need anyway because we walked everywhere.  Recommend activities: lunch in the Space Needle (cheaper than dinner), ferry to Bainbridge island and the Bill and Melinda gates Foundation visitors center.
"
6278191,39757474,2015-07-26,2921330,Jose,"Listing description was very accurate. Amazing location - walking distance to banks, Space Needle, bars, great restaurants and the waterfront! Good condo with pool and gym. Internet was a bit spotty, but other than that - I would really recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle! 

Carlos was great! Very responsive, available all the time, very welcoming and had everything ready to go for us when we got there. "
6278191,40090964,2015-07-28,10043037,Aishling,"Carlos' place was perfect for exploring Seattle by foot!  The building itself is very secure and the apartment was spacious and clean.  The kitchen was fully stocked with cooking utensils, pots, pans, plates, cups, etc.  Carlos was kind enough to supply soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and basic items such as q tips and ibuprofen in the bathroom.

As great as the apartment itself was, our favorite thing about it was the location.  There are so many great coffee shops and restaurants within a five minute walk.  We were able to walk to the Chihuly Museum and Space Needle in less than 10 minutes and Pike's Place Market was just a 10 minute walk away.  The apartment is also close to many bus lines.  My husband and I took the Link Light Rail to the end of the line and just walked the last 10 minutes to the apartment.

Carlos was a great communicator and did his best to ensure that we were comfortable.  I would gladly stay here during any future Seattle trips!"
6278191,41743963,2015-08-09,32057612,Eylon,"Carlos provided a great and clean place to stay for a week for me and two friends. The apartment is pretty spacious and the decor is very nice. One thing to note, that there is only one window that opens in the entire apartment. If you plan on cooking or need some sort of ventilation it is not ideal, but it is manageable.
The location was great! It is truly right in the middle of Belltown and minutes away from a lot of what Seattle has to offer. If you are considering this listing I would encourage you to take it."
6278191,42289915,2015-08-12,2350816,Ryan,"Carlos' apartment was a great place to stay while in Seattle. The apartment was tidy and well cared for. Carlos was communicative and quick to respond to messages. Best of all, the location of the building in Belltown was perfect, just a 5 minute walk to the Space Needle and Chihuly Museum and a 15 minute walk to Pike Place Market. Belltown is a friendly and safe neighborhood, couldn't have asked for a better location for exploring a new city."
6278191,43068963,2015-08-17,2590351,Jared,"The apartment was really wonderful and in a really great location. Its easy to/from the airport, and transportation to all the other neighborhoods in Seattle is a breeze.

The apartment was really clean and comfortable. We (my girlfriend and I) didn't spend much time there, but it was in great shape with extra clean towels and sheets.

We took off one star because communication leading up to our trip was difficult. Carlos didn't respond to email or text messages the day before, or the day of the trip, and we hadn't received any check-in instructions. This left us wondering if we had a place to stay as we headed to the airport in Tucson. As we were getting on the plane my phone buzzed with a AirBnb message from Carlos with the check-in instructions. Everything worked out fine, but the lack of response over those two days left us with a lot of anxiety.

After that everything was great. Getting into the apartment was easy and Carlos was very responsive once we were there. Check-out was also a breeze. Now that we know the drill, we would definitely stay here again."
6278191,43657487,2015-08-21,28057534,Ashley,"Everything was very nice and clean inside the apartment and the location to everything was great. Our favorite bars to go to was the Pine Box in Capital Hill and the Black Bottle on 1st Street near Pikes Market. We took the Pronto Bikes around the city and took the ferry to Bainbridge Island and ate at a beautiful hole in the wall Italian food restaurant while exploring.. My only complaint is there was no disclosure about no air conditioning in the unit. It was a little stuffy in there with only having one window that truly opens with the apartment being surrounded by buildings with very little airflow. However you get used to it after awhile. One other thing was the communication. The communication was not great. I have had experiences where they call you and tell you exactly what to do and how to enter the community but this was not the case here. I would barely ever get responses back via email,text,or call. When we arrived, we called to figure out what to do and we did not get a response for about 30 minutes. Therefore, we were sitting on the corner with all of our luggage. Luckily, someone let me in the building and I walked up and noticed the door unlocked so I went in. However, it would of been nice if he would of let us know what to do. There is also a gym and pool, however it is in another building behind the property. You are able to use it because the key works to get into that building but I had to ask around in order to even figure out it was over there. I just wish the communication was more on point than it was. Made things a little bit more difficult in the beginning than it should have been. I am not sure if I would stay here again but we did have a great time. Thanks Carlos."
6278191,44136518,2015-08-24,34785559,Regina,"This was our first time using airbnb, and we had a great experience. Our flight was delayed by several hours, and Carlos was extremely accommodating, as well as helpful in outlining all of the details. The studio itself was clean, well-equipped, and quiet, with a comfortable bed. We did notice a slight smell of cigarette smoke from time to time and assume it was coming from another unit in the building, but it was nothing problematic. The location, in between Pike Place and the Space Needle, cannot be beat, especially if you're only in town for a brief time and want to see the major sites. We'd recommend this listing to anyone looking for a comfortable stay in downtown Seattle."
6278191,44763656,2015-08-29,29336895,Shirley,Our first time using airBnB and hope all our experiences will be as good as this one.   The studio is very comfortable with thoughtful amenities and the location is very convenient.  Thanks Carlos for sharing your place. 
6278191,45098410,2015-08-31,36008550,Tom,Carlos's place was fantastic. Clean and easy to get anywhere. I have no idea who Carlos is as he never bothered to meet us. Whenever we managed to talk on the phone he was pleasant but he never got back to us about the fitness center. Still great apartment
6278191,46387514,2015-09-10,39392630,Aaron,"Carlos was very accommodating, and although we were not able to meet in person he made it very easy to check in and get settled.
The space itself is very nice and was spotlessly clean. We were very comfortable for the two days we were there.  There is access to a workout room and a nice rooftop sitting area. The main door to the building is accessed with a key fob and the lifts were spacious. There is a wifi network in the apartment for those of us who have to check back with work and home via internet and a Rite Aid across the street for odds and ends (and lost phone chargers!).
The apartment could not have been in a better location for us!  The Space Needle and Chihuly Museum are just a five minute walk away, the EMP Museum is right next to that, and we found our favorite place to relax right around the corner at the Five Points Cafe which is open 24 hours and serves comfort food at any hour of the day or night. (Think burgers, poutine, coffee and pie!)
The callizone at Bambinos' is not to be missed either, it is also just around the corner.
Pike's Market is about a 12 minute walk away in the other direction, it's best to move over on third street and then walk towards the waterfront.  We got a bit delayed walking along the waterfront itself...
All in all Carlos place is very much recommended, clean, quiet and perfectly situated for exploring on foot."
6278191,46717955,2015-09-13,3520277,Melissa,Fabulous location. Very clean and nicely presented. Comfortable and great bed. Definitely recommended.
6278191,47502077,2015-09-19,41223947,Nielsen,This was the first time using AirBnB.  The best decision.  The place was in prime location and everything was in walking distance.   The checkin and checkout was very easy and simple.  Thanks for making this a great trip
6278191,48878878,2015-09-29,15894595,Kevin,"I never had a chance to meet Carlos, but check in and check out went smoothly. The apartment was clean and in a great location. The washer and dryer was an added bonus. I would recommend staying here. "
6278191,50337471,2015-10-11,23297558,Rebecca,"Carlos has a very nice apartment in Belltown--a close walk to many restaurants & shops as well as the Space needle, Chihuly museum & EMP museum. It's in a great location. 

The apartment itself has everything you need for a comfortable stay. A washer & dryer in the unit, comfortable bed and a large TV if you want to relax after a long day of sight-seeing.  You can also go up to the rooftop--there is a beautiful view of the space needle from there. The apartment doesn't have air conditioning--there is only one window that opens & it got stuffy, but he did provide fans.

Communication is not the hosts strong suit--we didn't get instructions for check in until we arrived at the airport in Seattle & called him (after numerous messages & a voice mail). This made us nervous that we may not have a place to stay once we arrived. When we finally got in touch with Carlos, we got instructions for check in. He was then quick about getting us the wifi password and answering any other questions we had.

Overall, we had a nice stay & feel like the apartment is a good value for the money...communication needs improvement. "
6278191,53394657,2015-11-08,21840580,Liz K.,"The pictures do NOT do this airbnb justice! It is CLEAN, centrally located in Belltown, and while we did not see Carlos during our stay, he was quick to respond when we had questions. He was kind enough to let us check out late since our flight was later in the afternoon too, thanks so much!"
6278191,56871437,2015-12-19,44829484,Holly,"We had an amazing stay at Carlos' place - it was clean and very easy to find (do research parking if you're not familiar with Seattle.) The location of the apartment was very convenient. We were always walking distance of everything we wanted to see during our short time in Seattle - Space Needle, Pike Place Market, and local restaurants. I highly recommend this place! Thanks Carlos!"
8515408,50568620,2015-10-12,23828800,Aaron,Jennifer was a fantastic host and resource to all things Queen Anne/Seattle.  The neighborhood is VERY walkable and public transportation is accessible. The living space was extremely comfortable and well appointed.  I would highly recommend this apartment!
8515408,51502448,2015-10-20,46131640,Fiona,"Jennifer was very accommodating and the studio was in a great location and neighbourhood. Studio was everything as described and felt very homely. Just what I needed after staying in so many hotels!  Walking distance to Kerry Park, restaurants, shops and bus lines. I've also walked as far as downtown from the studio. Overall, perfect experience and would stay here again!"
8515408,58074973,2015-12-31,18943921,David,Jen made us feel very welcome and was very easy to contact for any information we needed. Parking was included and the studio apartment had everything we needed. Its location was ideal and within easy walking distance to the commercial district of Queen Anne.
6325283,34650458,2015-06-10,32790883,Meghan,"LaKell sent me the keys ahead of time so that I could just walk in when I got off the plane. She was out of town. There was an issue with her spare key for her building door not working, but she rectified it immediately. 
Her apt was adorable and exactly as shown. Very neat/tidy. The building itself is on the older side, and it's hard to believe her apt is inside it. The apt building 2 buildings down always had a group of guys drinking in front and I would walk down the road perpendicular to her house.  
Her apt was so close to the convention center and convenient to all of downtown Seattle with tons of restaurants and coffee shops at her doorstep. You really can't beat that. Overall a great find!"
6325283,34720193,2015-06-11,2522801,Tg,"Cozy apartment in a great location - walkable to convention center.  LaKell was very nice and easy to make arrangements with.  Neighborhood has bars, coffeeshops, restaurants.  Building exterior is bland, but the apartment was clean and inviting."
6325283,34980620,2015-06-14,23851760,Annie,This was my first time staying in an airbnb and it was awesome! The apartment was perfectly cute and cozy and in such a cool walkable area. 
6325283,37631153,2015-07-08,36904480,Tyler,Listing was accurate! Very last minute booking and I was impressed that she could respond to such short notice. The neighborhood is near a lot of nice Cap Hill spots but the street itself was a little sketchy. The apt itself seemed to be kept well.
6325283,37720486,2015-07-09,14016601,Jes,"Made a last minute reservation with LaKell. She couldn't accept both nights, but I was glad she reached out and modified my request for one night. Her apartment is in a really great area. We walked to a lot of awesome spots. The street itself is a strange pocket of characters that made me a little uneasy. But the building was secure and I felt safe once inside. 

Her space is adorable, exactly as pictured. Soft bed, cozy sheets, good water pressure, everything my husband and I needed for my quick trip in Seattle and LaKell was a great host."
6325283,46406815,2015-09-10,29280181,Katie,"LaKell's apartment was great! Don't be fooled by the building- Very cute and charming and in a great location close to coffee shops and restaurants, and easy to walk downtown or take a bus. She was very easy to book with, and even mailed us her keys for convenience! I would definitely stay there again! "
6325283,50584344,2015-10-12,9684315,Jody,Good location. Place was exactly how it was descriped. Easy to get the keys and check in. Nice little apartment!
9706229,57267021,2015-12-23,16644912,Brendan,Extremely great location to everything in Seattle! Very cozy and great price. Matt was very helpful with everything and accessible when needed.
9706229,57411546,2015-12-25,41228278,Ying,"离派克市场很近，就是上面街，全球首家星巴克就在派克市边，去梅西百货和轻轨都很方便，交通方便，也很热闹，房间干净，可煮食，出门看见摩夭伦，往摩天轮方向有水族馆，向前行还有一间吃蟹的餐馆，好正，就是入住时当好WiFi 坏了，就是夜上晚回街有点静，如是男孩就不怕，推荐
Well situated, clean n comfortable,but was dark downstairs,feel sacred when come back late, good host."
9706229,57497052,2015-12-26,15449573,Morgan,What a great place! Very nice inside and the best location in Seattle. My family members said it was perfect!!
9706229,57741490,2015-12-28,31809238,Wen-Qing,"For those who is considering to live in: The room is well decorated, though cold when I came in and it took a long time to get it warm. A pair of cotton slipper would really work for you in the winter.  I love the location - 10 minutes walk to pike market, while it could be a bit noisy since it's near the street. Mind this if you are sensitive to sounds. Overall it's a cost efficient choice if you're not picky. Matt is really helpful and he gives immediate feedback if you have any question. Nice experience."
9706229,57980265,2015-12-30,52102557,Eric,"Very nice, clean place!  Wonderful location and so easy to get anywhere!  Dan and Matt were helpful and made the whole experience simple!  They answered all the questions we had promptly. Wonderful first time experience!  "

3656508,16529148,2014-07-28,18693818,Danny,"Everything was just as described on the website, and Augustin was a very welcoming host. He was very friendly and I immediately felt comfortable at his place, even though I was gone for most of the days. I would definitely stay here again if I needed to."
3656508,16945496,2014-08-04,11614174,Chris,"Augustin was a great host. His communication was excellent. Every time I had a question for him, he responded within an hour. He had an emergency situation come up during my reservation and was still able to meet all our needs. The place was clean and well organized and we liked the fact that it was very private. I would definitely recommend using Augustin's place!"
3656508,17392661,2014-08-11,5310765,Cheryl,"Augustin was professional and easy to reach by text. The room was large and private, but he'd just moved in so it could have used a bedside table and lamp. His roommate was also friendly and accommodating. He let us extend our checkout time, which we really appreciated. It was a short drive to historic Ballard."
3656508,18193199,2014-08-23,19149268,Paula,"Augustin was very welcoming! 
He made sure I had everything I needed 
And helped me orient myself in the city.
The room was very clean and very cozy! 
Exactly as it was presented online. 
The location was perfect! Very centrally 
Located in a terrific and safe neighborhood.
I will definitely stay there again if I have the 
Opportunity."
3656508,19169358,2014-09-07,7843321,Shane,Room exactly as shown in picture.  Good area and served my purposes perfectly.
3656508,19570758,2014-09-14,17903087,Stephen,Augustin's place was perfect.  Easy check in and plenty of privacy. Augustin was a gracious host and overall nice guy.  The room is huge and located in the north end of Ballard which means easy access to downtown and other points of interest.  I would highly recommend staying at Augustin's place.  
3656508,20532069,2014-09-30,9057922,Audrey,"Augustin was very welcoming and friendly. The room was very private, comfortable and bright. The attached bath, walk-in closet and small patio were a plus. I had a car, but stores, restaurants and buses were within easy walking distance. A very pleasant and accessible place to stay with a very nice host."
3656508,21886627,2014-10-26,21430703,Liya,"It's a great place, huge space, and convenient commute!

3656508,22627746,2014-11-10,4189109,Nikolay,"This crib is amazing: the room feels like a 4star hotel (a good one), the living room with a kitchen is super cosy. Really great value. Hard to find something I disliked about it: maybe just the sound isolation could be improved."
3656508,24083211,2014-12-19,21494279,Peter,"I had a wonderful time at Augustin's place. He provided me with a fine room and a great bed in his quite-new house, along with kitchen privileges and an overall feeling of being totally welcome, not just a ""boarder"". Augustin is a fascinating person with a really interesting background. Allthough a busy businessman, he graciously spent time with me, chatting about our mutual, high-tech interests. His location near the Crown Hill and Greenwood neighborhoods provided me with a wide array of great restaurants, pubs, coffee places, and shopping. But mainly, I'm happy to have gotten to know Augustin, and I look forward to seeing him again soon!
"
3656508,26994787,2015-02-23,26467164,Phillip,"Augustin is a wonderful host and always makes you feel very welcome. He does everything he can to make your stay a pleasant one. The room is spacious, clean and comfortable, with plenty of room for two people.

Greenwood is a great area, with lots of shops and eateries within easy walking distance of Augustin's home, and you are able to access Seattle Center quickly from Aurora Ave., a few minutes drive from the house.

I highly recommend staying with Augustin during a visit to Seattle. It will only add to the pleasure and enjoyment of your visit."
3656508,28404479,2015-03-23,26467164,Phillip,"Augustin is a wonderful host and really makes you feel welcome. He makes sure you are comfortable and enjoying your stay in his home. 

The room is big--plenty of space with a walk-in closet and private bathroom. 

The Greenwood area is a great place to stay while in Seattle as there are many shops and restaurants within walking distance of Augustin's location."
3656508,28913216,2015-03-31,21687926,Iain,"The room was exactly as described, and actually much more spacious.  Augustin was incredibly welcoming and helpful."
3656508,29641249,2015-04-10,10132034,Ramani,"Augustin's space is as shown:  spacious and modern, with a walk-in closet just for you.  It's the only bedroom located on the first floor of a multi-story dwelling, and neither Augustin nor his housemate is the least bit intrusive; they mostly keep to themselves.  So you have total privacy, which is remarkable in a shared living situation.

Bus service from this location is unbeatable:  you can get downtown, to the University District, Ballard, Green Lake, and most other places very easily.  I was very happy with my stay here and would gladly stay again."
3656508,30103153,2015-04-17,10132034,Ramani,"I stayed with Augustin for two weeks or so successively. Instead of extending my initial stay, I booked the space all over again a second time, which is what prompted this auto-request for another review.  What I said in my previous review covers both stays.  And I did stay longer, enough said."

3656508,35705787,2015-06-21,3426239,Andre,"Overall I enjoyed my stay at Augustin's place. Here's a list of pros and cons I found:

Pros:
1 - Great location. Lots of restaurants, bars and grocery stores nearby.
2 - Comfortable bed.
3 - Nice chair/table if you need to get some work done.
4 - Nice private bathroom.

Cons:
1 - Cleanness. There were a number of long hairs in the bed sheets. Maybe from a previous female guest, I suppose, but this should've been cleaned. Also, there was a layer of dust on the arms of the armchair and on the table's keyboard pad.
2 - The room features a huge window, which is great. However, there're a few missing blinds and a couple that don't rotate. Because this window faces neighbors' windows, it takes away some of your privacy."

3656508,36997303,2015-07-03,36337819,Femi,"Didn't get to stay with Augustin as some friends requested I stay with them however from my communication with him, he was patient, flexible and easy going. Wish I had the time to meet him. Probably when next I'm in SeattLe."
3656508,40808821,2015-08-02,4402072,Sarah,"The neighborhood was nice, safe and residential though a little far out from the main sites in Seattle. We ended up taking our car into town most of the time since Google maps said it would be 45 mins by bus and 20 by car to lots of our destinations. We did love the proximity to Ballard and  were big fans of nearby Neptune Coffee. We had to drive everywhere for the most part but we loved how easy it was to find parking in the neighborhood.

Agustin was very professional and friendly during our interactions though we didn't meet face to face since he was away for work.

Pros
-As pictured/described
-Augustin made sure we could get into the house even though we arrived very late
-Access to public transportation 
-Good, easy street parking 
-Very private 
-Spacious bedroom 
-Nice updated bathroom 
-Comfy sheets 
-Lots of natural light 
-Agustin was kind enough to follow up after our stay to make sure we had a nice time

Cons 
- Communication with host was slow on the day of my arrival, I was at the airport about to depart from Seattle and still hadn't heard back about how to get into the airbnb which was a little nerve-wracking 
- Gets lots of sunlight in the bedroom due to missing blinds so couldn't sleep past 8am
- Furniture and decor are VERY basic, has college dorm room feel with bare minimum in room
- There were Hairs in the bed and the trashcan hadn't been emptied 
- Bed was uncomfortable since it was squeaky and moved a lot, tricky with two people
- Not great soundproofing with upstairs 

I'm docking one star because of some hygiene issues we had detailed above. Overall, it was as pictured but for the price, I would probably go for a different spot next time. "
3656508,42007829,2015-08-10,38487301,Carolyn,"We spent 8 lovely nights in Seattle. Our host, Augustin, had to be out of state on business, but his housemate left the key for us and brought us clean towels the first day. This room was perfect for our needs. It is on the first floor, so you don't disturb anyone with your coming and going. We could have gone up to the kitchen and TV on 2nd floor, but our son picked us up early every day and we came in late, so we did not use the upstairs. The room has a comfortable queen bed, walk-in closet and private bathroom. The back wall is a patio door out to an enclosed patio. We left the door open every night to enjoy the cool night air. It has a desk and chair, plus a large chair. Nothing fancy, but all we needed.  We plan to return to Seattle and would definitely hope to meet Augustin and enjoy his home again."
3656508,42966294,2015-08-16,30313149,Ryan,"Augustin's townhome bedroom/bathroom provided all the simple necessities we needed as we spent a couple nights there searching for  an apartment.  It's in a nice walkable area, but also has plenty of street parking.  "
3656508,47767658,2015-09-21,35427975,Daniel Ricardo,"I felt great in Augustin's room. It is a big room, with a comfortable bed, a desk and a chair to do whatever you need. The private bath is a great addition, and it includes clean towels and all the basic stuff you need.

You are also welcome to use the kitchen and the laundry if you need to, and Augustin's housemate, Jesus, is a really nice guy. I met him because Augustin was out, but both prepared everything for my arrival. They are both helpful for whatever you need.

The neighborhood is safe and quiet. There is a grocery store near the place, and some places to eat. Transportation is easy, as there are many stops nearby. "
3656508,48817859,2015-09-28,25115060,Kah Wai,"Augustin's place was THE find throughout my one month's vacation in Seattle.

The room is huge with my very own bathroom & office desk. The kitchen is fully equipped and I saved quite a bit by buying groceries from Fred Meyer, which is 8 minutes walk away, and cooked anything I wanted. 

Augustin was very generous by allowing free access to his living room which has a huge and what seems like hundreds of channels.

Thanks Augustin for hosting me."
3656508,51982349,2015-10-25,19011657,Ashley,"Augustin and his roommate were amazing hosts! Super friendly and accommodating, I'm really grateful they shared their home with me. If I ever need a place to stay in Seattle in the future, I would definitely stay with them again. Thanks guys!"
3656508,55734100,2015-12-05,35019553,Lauren,"I very much enjoyed my stay at Augustin's condo. It was in a great location with lots to do and eat. It was very clean and looked just like the pictures. I never actually met Augustin, but he was easy to contact if I had questions. I would definitely recommend this lovely condo."
107046,793064,2011-12-19,751416,Erna,"The place was very comfortable, spacious and well-furnished.  The hosts were waiting even though the arrival was later than expected (Seattle rush hour traffic!).  The location was great for my family, stores, restaurants and coffee shops were within an easy stroll, and candy cane lane only a couple of blocks away!  

Thanks again, we will definitely return if/when the opportunity arises!

107046,1453703,2012-06-11,1676670,Linda,"We loved staying at the Bloomsbury House. It is a beautiful home, well maintained, in a great location and safe neighborhood. The house is well appointed and interesting and the host was awesome. No concerns what so ever."
107046,2053654,2012-08-21,2766707,Chris,"Sarah's home is wonderful.  We had a great stay and felt so grateful to have a clean, lovely place to call our weekend home and to know Sarah was just a phone call away in case we needed anything.  I cannot recommend her house highly enough!"
107046,2914620,2012-11-19,2084501,Shoshana,"Bloomsbury house was the ideal place for our weekend family get together. Every detail was attended to quickly and thoroughly prior to and including our stay. The house comfortably accommodates 8 and each room is beautifully appointed to make your stay extra special. The bowl of fruit, vase of flowers and other special touches were lovely. The hosts made sure we felt comfortable and we did! We all wish we could have stayed longer or better yet - trade our own home for this lovely abode!"
107046,3356134,2013-01-16,1788558,Kira,My folks stayed here for my wedding. Sarah has a cozy home that's in a fantastic location with various cafes and stores within walking distance.  Thank you for your hospitality. 
107046,3938317,2013-03-29,5108130,Douglas,"Our stay at Bloomsbury House was delightful. It was so cozy and perfect for my families needs. Plenty of very comfortable beds, a great living room for hanging out, and a well stocked kitchen where we were able to make breakfast and dinner easily. Everyone in my family thoroughly enjoyed all the wonderful artwork and personal touches we found around the house and outside as well. It was great to have access to park in the garage, and still have enough room in the driveway to park a second vehicle too.  We lucked out and had amazing weather for our visit. It was so fun to look out the skylight in the upstairs and see blue skies. My daughter loved the mermaid tub upstairs too. We would highly recommend this house to anyone who's looking for a home away from home."
107046,8754096,2013-11-16,589257,Fred,Sarah and Andrew were fantastic hosts - the house was beautiful and plenty of shops/restaurants nearby. Would definitely stay again.
107046,16649677,2014-07-31,11708189,Changming,"Sarah and Andrew are quite friendly and responsible host. They are waiting in the house prior to our arrival. The house is clean, the decoration are lovely and artistic. Most of the paintings are the original from some local artists. The neighborhood are quiet and safe. There are several restaurants in walking distance. We love the Harissa Mediterranean Cuisine so much that we dined there twice.  It takes about 15 minutes to drive to download Seattle."
107046,16974507,2014-08-05,14379802,Andrew,"Terrific home, just as described. Hosts very gracious. House had all the essentials and then some. Kitchen practical and nicely stocked with salt, spices, all the things one forgets. Lovely fruit granola yoghurt for your first breakfast. Great linens and all the rooms very quiet. Great value: worth every penny. Quiet neighborhood near university and 20 min easy drive downtown.  Most highly recommended."
107046,19323519,2014-09-10,19137989,Sukanya,"The house was truly beautiful and artistically made up as was listed.  The hosts Andrew and Sarah were so very helpful and open that we were so glad that we chose to stay in their tastefully decorated house.  Whatever we wanted was available and the house well stocked up.  The neighborhood too was so very  colorful and nice.  Our objective in coming to Seattle was to celebrate the wedding of our elder son, the house was so very useful in getting our family relax in this very busy period.

Thanks a ton Sarah and Andrew ..."
107046,20947149,2014-10-08,1700760,Ford,"We enjoyed this quintessential Seattle home immensely. Sarah and Andrew left no detail unattended to, and their beautiful home added to our enjoyment of our visit to Seattle. The walls are adorned with engaging and eclectic artwork, and the entire house was exceptionally clean and comfortable. We'd stay here again in a heartbeat and strongly recommend it to others."
107046,22618489,2014-11-10,23122607,Scott,"Our hosts met us at the house and showed us everything.  Great house, great location, great people!  We were within walking distance to several restaurants and to University of Washington.  Really enjoyed our stay in Seattle!"
107046,32635833,2015-05-19,6627057,Zeheng(Ze),Very nice house! The host are very welcoming. Neighborhood is very quite also!

107046,45234146,2015-09-01,26498782,Jen,"This was a lovely home in the university area of Seattle. Sarah and Andrew were very reachable and responded to all inquiries very promptly. This was our first experience with using airbnb, and it was awesome. The beds were extremely comfortable, the backyard was beautiful. It truly felt like we were coming home after a day of sight seeing. It was a wonderful place to spend our 10th anniversary with dear friends. "
107046,47140700,2015-09-16,28548122,Robert And Judy,Host contacted us appropriately and made it easy to get in. It was s comfortable stay
107046,49016761,2015-09-30,2178650,Clinton,"Sarah and Andrew offered a tip-top experience. Well-organized home with the small touches considered (ground coffee on the ready, homemade granola in the refrigerator, knives that were *gasp* sharp). We enjoyed our stay for a company retreat. Great walking proximity to anything you would need. Nice back deck. Wonderful decor. Cozy furniture and beds."
107046,50447677,2015-10-12,17568158,Armando,"Great experience, nice hosts and beautiful home. We fell in love with the quiet ""Ravenna"" neighborhood and all the restaurants a short walk away. Although we didn't really expect to give much time to the home, we found ourselves on the front porch and backyard garden, basking in the peaceful, morning sunshine and cool nights. The inside is adorned with crafts, sculptures, art objects, paintings, drawings — art everywhere! On the other hand, we were about 10–15 minutes away from downtown (or really anywhere from 5–20 minutes to anywhere in the Seattle area).

Sarah was kind enough to offer us an earlier check-in time and was readily available when we called her. She gave us a quick tour of the house and some tips on what to see around the area. We definitely enjoyed Andrew's granola. My guests seemed to enjoy themselves and their separate bedrooms as well as the coffee!"
107046,51294417,2015-10-19,10396027,Thenmozhi,Wonderful hospitality and a beautiful. They really were the best hosts ever. Location was easy for us as we had a lot of university of washington events! Thank you so much. 
107046,54049305,2015-11-15,4466247,Annika,"We had a lovely stay at Sarah and Andrew's home in Seattle.  I am hard to impress but I was while in their home.  There is no detail that was overlooked.  I can honestly say that we lacked for nothing while staying there.  Andrew's granola was delicious, the decor was stylish, the location was centrally located to everywhere we were going and the master bedroom's bedding was so comfortable that I wish I could know who made that down comforter so I could purchase one for my bed at home!  There were seven of us who stayed and the home could easily accommodate us all.  We would not hesitate to stay there again, in fact, we may do so when we return in January!  Thanks again to Sarah and Andrew!"
107046,55094677,2015-11-28,3239213,Ricardo,"Perfect!  Andrew met us at the house (and did not complain that we arrived later than planned) and showed us around the house which was cleaned and well equipped.  We even able to cook our Thanksgiving dinner there.
Photos and description were accurate.
Neighborhood was great and close to U Village and walking distance to the football stadium and other parts of campus.
Fruit, homemade granola, coffee and a great selection of tea were provided.  Washer and dryer were very handy (especially with our toddler granddaughter.
We had a minor issue with the new water heater, Sarah was very responsive and even offered to come over on Thanksgiving morning to have her and Andrew check it out.  I was able to figure out the problem and all worked fine.
Would definitely stay again.  The house is beautiful and very welcoming.
Sarah and Andrew were easy to communicate with and made our stay very pleasant."

Despite this being a newer listing, the entire apartment was ready for guests and met our needs perfectly. The convenience of the location as well as the keypad lock meant that we were really able to relax and enjoy our trip to Seattle!"
6832592,38889320,2015-07-19,22936117,Deborah,"We really, really enjoyed our stay here! Our hosts Mike and Michelle were so warm and friendly; they really went above and beyond to make sure we had a wonderful stay. The house was easy to find in a very quiet and peaceful, family oriented neighborhood that was just perfect for our family. The passcode key entry was very convenient. The welcome basket was such a nice and unexpected touch. The house was super clean and made for a really comfortable stay, as well as having a great kitchen with everything we needed for those few occasions that we actually did cook since most of the time we took advantage of all the great places to eat nearby. The air conditioning and ceiling fans sure came in handy as the weather in Seattle really heated up during our time there. This place really felt like a home away from home and we definitely plan to come back here the next time we find our way back to Seattle. Thanks so much to our lovely hosts for really making our time here so special!"
6832592,39411356,2015-07-23,224285,Juanita,"Four of us stayed here in July.  Each grandson had a room (the den bed was an added bonus!).  The house was very clean.  The real bedrooms were big, with closets, plenty of hangers and suitcase stands.  They have thought of nearly everything in this house.   Great pots and pans, dishes, some goodies left in a basket, as well as orange juice and water.  Very clear instructions on Seattle's garbage/recycling.   Neighborhood was great, easily accessible to local market and just a few more blocks to a Fred Mayer store.  I never met them, but the check-in was easy.  The stairs to the place are a bit steep, so if you have mobility issues, one might keep that in mind.  Fortunately, there was an air conditioner and ceiling fans for those few days it hovered near 100 degrees.   They were always available via e-mail or text to answer any questions.   We parked our car in front and took public transportation downtown for two days.  We'd rent there again.  "
6832592,40121534,2015-07-28,19599517,Luke,"Had an amazing stay and Mike and Michelle's place. It was very clean, lots of room, and in a very nice quiet neighbourhood. Lots of restaurants, shops and a grocery store within walking distance. About a $20-25 cab ride downtown (I would suggest using yellow cab as we had bad experiences with other cab companies). Can't say anything negative about the place or dealing with Michelle who was very helpful and responded quickly to any questions. Thanks for a great stay!"
6832592,40503854,2015-07-31,38698095,Melissa,"Our stay at the Phinney Ridge house was great. The house is close to all attractions in Seattle including the Pier, Zoo and local craft breweries in Ballard. Area was safe and low traffic. Beds were comfortable. Kitchen was great for meals. Coffee and snacks were a treat! Our host Michelle was gracious and available over the phone when needed.

6832592,42146051,2015-08-11,36658932,Aaron,"We ran into some car trouble on the way which had us arriving later then we planned. The directions given to us, combined with the keycode lock on the door made it very easy to get in despite our delay. The house itself was great, plenty of space for our group, and the treat basket was a more than welcome treat. We never felt like we needed anything that wasn't available in the home.  Mike and Michelle always seemed available if we needed anything

Our stay in seattle was much improved by the fact that we felt like we were staying in a home away from home, rather than a hotel room like we had originally planned. We would definitely stay again. "
6832592,43259051,2015-08-18,37349312,Patrick,We had a great time staying at Mike and Michelle's place on Phinney Ridge. Very close to just about anything you would want to do in and around Seattle.  It's also within walking distance of the main shops and restaurants on Phinney.
6832592,44130272,2015-08-24,7958966,Jessica,"This place is super cute and very accessible to Greenlake and Phinney Ridge. Very clean and as pictured in the listing. We were visiting family so we were really only here at night and in the early morning, but it was perfect for chilling out at night, watching a bit of tv then crashing out. Very comfortable beds and couches and a well-appointed kitchen. Our thoughtful hosts left us surprisingly delicious Costco coffee which tided us over until we could get out the door and walk to one of the nearby coffee shops. Warning for families with small children - the steep stairs are tough to navigate with baby and gear in tow. Also, the old fashioned windows are screened and low to the ground so not baby/toddler safe, which is a bummer if you are hoping for fresh air because you really have to keep them shut for safety. Overall nice place and would recommend."
6832592,45387659,2015-09-02,18978182,Paula,"We loved Mike & Michelle's darling home. Everything was perfect! The home was well stocked with supplies, condiments & treats. The furniture & beds were very comfortable, the closets & chests were spacious. We had fun exploring the neighborhood, great shops, restaurants & a grocery store. We highly recommend this home. Mike & Michelle were very conscientious hosts!"
6832592,46148294,2015-09-08,10438706,Rebecca,"We lived in this neighborhood before moving out of state a few years ago. Believe me when I say that Mike and Michelle's place in Phinney Ridge is perfect for living like a Seattleite: Herkimer coffee, 74th Street Ale House, Ken's Market, Metropolis, etc., and also convenient for zipping into Ballard or downtown.  

As hosts, they were super responsive and always very friendly in our correspondence.  They have thought of everything: a well-lit coded entry, ample on-street parking, a welcome basket of snacks, fully stocked kitchen, clean and bright linens, clear instructions.  A convenient nice touch is the shampoo, shower gel, dispenser in the shower.  

We hope to come back here every year."
6832592,46762031,2015-09-13,41388082,Nancie,Very comfortable home. Very pleasant neighborhood. Parking was a little tight but we were prepared so no big deal. Nice welcome basket and very appropriately stocked kitchen. We will definitely remember this location when visiting Seattle again. 
6832592,47100323,2015-09-15,21988732,Hanah,Property was clean and spacious. Sweet gift basket. Home is a bit older so floor creaks quite a bit. Stairwell going up is very steep so be careful with kids or if older. Mike and Michelle were at the rental when we got there. Just quick intro but Michelle was quick to reply when email. 
6832592,48193165,2015-09-24,41766418,Carolyn,"Comfortable, clean, roomy, and in a great location. The place was perfect for the four of us.

6832592,51145029,2015-10-18,43431985,Paul,"Very comfortable place to stay in a nice neighborhood with walking access to some very nice restaurants and pubs. Grocery stores as well as other convinces were located within easy driving distances. Bus access to downtown was also very convenient. The host checked up on us several times to see if we needed anything and followed up promptly when we had any questions. All things considered, a great place to stay."
5457260,28768935,2015-03-29,28378625,Caitlin,"First experience w air bnb. Absolutely perfect! Room was clean and super trendy, with a comfy bed. People living there were so nice and hospitable "

5457260,34672660,2015-06-10,33273961,Elisabeth,"Alex is an incredibly fun and laid back host, smart and a little crazy in the best possible way. Communication was excellent, the house is very clean and very pretty, the room fairly clean and supercool, the housemates extremely helpful and Ballard a neighborhood worth while visiting, green, peaceful and beautiful, and 15 minutes away from old Ballard with many many bars, restaurants and fun things to do. We had a wonderful time here! Thank you so much, Alex!"
5457260,35311229,2015-06-17,32991562,Cory,"Alex, and his roommates were incredibly cool, laid back and helpful. I had never been to Seattle before, so I was looking for recommendations and directions. They were quick to help with both. Alex was amazing at communicating and making sure I knew how to get in the house (since he was at work when I got to town), and the one time he needed something out of the room, was nice enough to text me to make sure it was cool to go in and get it. 

The room was extremely comfortable. The weather was beautiful, so I slept with the windows open, and there was plenty of airflow. This is the only trip I've ever been on that I didn't miss my own bed 2 days in. 

Ballard is beautiful and the house is a 15-20 minute walk away from Market St. which has a bunch of really good restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and a cool little movie theater. If you don't feel like walking, and Uber ride costs roughly $4, and $13-$19 to downtown Seattle.  

I highly recommend staying here."
5457260,35852674,2015-06-22,35237824,Megan,I stayed at Alex's place for roughly five days in the Ballard area of Seattle. He left clear directions of how to get into the house. His roommates were very welcoming and gave us info about places to go eat and about a festival in Seattle. It was my first experience with AirBNB and I will not hesitate to recommend the site and Alex. 
5457260,37393662,2015-07-06,36635111,Leona,"This was my first time using AirBnB. At first I was nervous about staying with strangers, but after meeting Alex I knew I was going to be fine. Upon meeting him he was very friendly and accommodating. He welcomed us in, showed us around, and explained where everything was. We stay a week and it was wonderful. :) Alex and his friends would ask us where we are going each day and gave suggestions. They made sure we were okay. It honestly felt like staying at a friends house rather than a stranger. I would definitely stay there again. :)"
5457260,42152543,2015-08-11,1879249,Sophia,Alex's place was so nice to stay at. The groovy pad looks just like it does in pictures. The place is in a very nice neighborhood and it was close to a bus stop. He was very responsive and kept to himself most of the time which worked well for us! :) His roommates were also very nice. I'd definitely  stay here again.
5457260,43647427,2015-08-21,38210282,Stefan,"Alex has a lovely, comfortable room. The 70s decorations are awesome and the location, Ballard, is great as well. Arranging the room went smoothly and Alex communicates well. His roommates are also very friendly and approachable. Overall, if you are looking for a place to stay in Seattle, I can recommend Alex' room!"
5457260,46022267,2015-09-07,4331772,Leonardo,"I didn't get to meet Alex but the room was very much as described, the housemates were really nice and it was overall a very friendly atmosphere. The location is great a nice stroll to all the Ballard bars and venues. I found the location very convenient to explore the Ballard, Freemont and Wallingford neighborhoods which was my intention for this trip and I very much recommend you to stay here if this interests you. They are more laid back and less urban neighborhoods than closer to downtown but still vibrant and you will find plenty of options of food and live music and more."

5487653,38106300,2015-07-13,28297786,Becky,"Staying at Aaron's place was a treat. It's in a fantastic neighborhood (Crown Hill) and you're within minutes of Ballard, Old Ballard, and Wallingford, not to mention the Bay. Good bars and restaurants all around and pretty easy access to downtown Seattle as well. The place itself was immaculate. We had all the information we needed for our stay (key location and wifi, etc.). Communication with Aaron was great. Highly recommend staying here!"

1820794,9741853,2014-01-07,10393765,Bernadette,"I stayed with Pam & Patrick for a month. It was an amazing experience.

First, their location is unbeatable. The cozy apartment is located in Queen Anne which is a very nice neighborhood. It's located at the top of the hill. So be prepared to walk or drive up and down steep hills. A Midwest girl like me found this to be challenging.

Anyway, I could not have chosen I better neighborhood. It's close to downtown, Belltown and Capitol Hill. It's close to many restaurants, entertainment (music venues, theaters, etc.) and grocery stores too.  You are about a 5 minute drive to Pike Place market.

I worked in Bothell (far north suburbs) but getting to the I-5 was a breeze. It's close. And it's a gateway to all of rest Seattle's awesome neighborhoods. Queen Anne is about 10 -15 mins (drive) to the U District, Ballard and Fremont. 

The apartment was fully equipped with everything you need in the kitchen - baking goods, wine glasses, dishes, etc. My friends and I had no problem making full course dinners and baking gourmet sweets. 

The in-unit laundry and dryer was a plus, extra towels, walk-in closet, extensive movie collection and Internet are just a few amenities that go a long way. 

Did I mention the view? You can see the space needle from your window. This is truly a superb view. But then again you're on a hill. You have a good view anywhere you go!

The hosts were so accommodating! They communicate well and are willing to help you when you need it. I had guests visit me from Chicago and they lent me an air bed and extra bedding. 

All in all, don't snooze on this place. Good hosts, good location and an apartment/studio that feels like home. Good furniture, cozy feel. Great privacy. Enjoy Seattle with ease staying at this place.

1820794,9840237,2014-01-13,5855263,Heidi,"We stayed a weekend at Highland Hideaway and loved it! Location is fantastic, and just minutes from downtown. Space Needle view from the apartment and yard is great. The apartment is very cute and cozy with plenty of amenities. Pam was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed all weekend. Would definitely recommend this place! "
1820794,9967996,2014-01-21,1659710,Abdallah,"I booked this place for a couple of friends visiting. It was just fantastic. Great view, very clean, Pam was very hospitable and constantly checked on them to see if everything is OK. I would definitely recommend this place! I will also be booking it again for any friends visiting!"
1820794,10656285,2014-03-02,1144611,Jenny,"Terrific apartment and very attentive hosts!

My parents stayed at this Airbnb for a little over a month while they were visiting with us and our new twin baby girls. The space was perfect for their needs. Stocked kitchen, clean space, large patio with fantastic view of the Space Needle and a nice tv with Direct TV.

Pam, was super responsive with all my texts (seriously, within seconds!) and occasionally checked in without being intrusive. We liked the place so much that we extended the stay another week!

Now that two extra little humans are living with us, we're definitely going to be renting this property again for all our longer term out-of-town guests. "
1820794,12653840,2014-05-07,8265630,Natty,"I had a wonderful time here! I stayed for two months for a school program nearby and this place was great. It was close enough to everything that I could walk almost anywhere I needed to go in SLU, but secluded enough that it was nice and quiet. The view overlooking the needle and downtown was also pretty amazing, especially at night!

When I got there, the place was spotless and everything I could need (silverware, plates, laundry and bath supplies, etc.) was thought of and already there. Very helpful! The laundry unit right in the apartment was very handy as well. Also having access to a full kitchen was also very awesome.

The hosts, Pam and Patrick, were super nice and very accommodating. They were very responsive to any questions or requests I had and very knowledgable about the area, which is nice because there are lots of amazing little food places around the Queen Anne area. 

I think the only drawbacks to the area were stated in other reviews and might bug other people: namely the steep hills and the wacky parking. I mostly walked everywhere so I didn't use my car much, and being from Utah I actually didn't mind the hills at all. I wouldn't let that deter you from staying here. 

I highly recommend staying here. The price can't be beat, especially for the central location and amazing views, not to mention the awesome hosts!"
1820794,12762133,2014-05-10,9520991,Rosemarie,"Another successful Airbnb experience! We were so happy to find Pam's place on airbnb, and even happier when we got there. She has a very lovely place in a wonderful location with a view of the space needle. It was really clean and she even had extra toiletries. Definitely better than staying in a hotel! Queen Anne is a great area as well. Many great restaurants nearby and not too far from popular destinations/attractions. We would come back and stay in a heartbeat. Thank you Pam!"
1820794,13405454,2014-05-27,12558554,Rainer,"Wir hatten eine wundervolle Zeit bei Pam. Der Empfang war sehr liebevoll
vorbereitet und die Wohnung geschmackvoll und perfekt eingerichtet.
Für unser Belange ( ständiger Besuch vom Enkelkind ) war bei bestem Wetter 
vor allem die große Terrasse mit eigenem Garten und Blick auf die nahe Spaceneedle nicht zu überbieten. Wir haben 16 Tage Aufenthalt dort genossen und hoffen auf eine Wiederholung.

1820794,13564299,2014-05-31,4499728,Irene & Michael,Pam's place was perfect for our stay in Seattle!  It's a lovely apartment with everything from a great view of the Space Needle and your own backyard to a fully equipped kitchen and a study room!  We loved being there and Pam was so helpful in every way.  She was very easy to communicate with and very accessible during our stay.  We would definitely recommend and come again!!
1820794,13692731,2014-06-02,2755820,Sean,"Pam provided a beautiful, very large, and conveniently located hideaway for us. We stayed only two nights, but found the amenities delightful and Pam very responsive. We'd highly recommend the Highland Hideaway to anyone else considering a stay in Seattle."
1820794,15028039,2014-07-01,3537560,Shannon,"I stayed with Pam and Patrick for a month it was absolutely amazing!  The apartment is so comfortable and cozy and it is in a great location.  And the private backyard is simply fantastic.  Pam and Patrick are more than helpful and friendly, and there to provide anything you may need.  Their cat Blue also stops by every now and then to say hello and make sure all is well :)

Overall, you have everything you need here; the place is really nice and spacious too!  The house is on a steep hill and surrounded by steep hills so if you don't have a car, be prepared to get your workout on.  Fortunately, I came when the whether was gorgeous, so being out and walking and getting a bit of a workout was enjoyable.  You are near several options for food, grocery stores, and literally minutes from the Seattle Center.  It's pretty much perfect.

I could not have asked for a better place to stay and better hosts.  I am so grateful to Pam and Patrick for allowing me to stay in their awesome hideaway.  It was everything I wanted and needed!"
1820794,15212138,2014-07-05,13834799,Alex,"My wife and I recently stayed with Pam, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The location is absolutely fantastic.  We mostly walked everywhere, including the space needle, down to pike place, many museums, and even down to Kerry park which is in their neighborhood.  All were less than 30 minutes walk, and if you want to take the bus somewhere (like we did when having dinner in Ballard), there are numerous bus stops within blocks of this property.
The place was very clean when we arrived, and there is a little backyard patio area that is private from everything (also a view of the space needle from here).  Pam even left us a bottle of wine to enjoy upon arriving."
1820794,17258348,2014-08-10,4846922,Susan,"Two members of our family absolutely loved their extended stay (5 weeks!) at the Highland Hideaway.  The apartment is beautiful, so clean, exactly as pictured,  very comfortable, and in a fabulous neighborhood.  So close to Seattle Center, as well as shopping and restaurants.  It was equipped with everything needed for the longer stay and for lots of cooking.  Loved the view of the Seattle Center, loved the yard and patio area, too.  The hosts were so kind, welcoming, and helpful.   Communication was excellent before, during, and after the stay.   Pam always responded so quickly to any inquiry, even when she was away for the weekend.  She was on top of every detail, and so welcoming.  We would definitely stay there again.  We highly recommend the Hideaway.  "
1820794,17615446,2014-08-15,7972230,Anne,"Une très bonne adresse ! Pam est accueillante et le studio est agréable avec sa terrasse couverte, sa vue et le jardin...ça grimpe raide pour y arriver mais c est un quartier très agréable avec des architectures de maisons fabuleuses: promenez vous dans les rues adjacentes ça vaut la peine ! si vous résidiez plus près du centre vous manqueriez  tout ça ! Chouettes restos tout proches également. Un bémol : l isolation phonique : on entend tout ce qui se passe dans l appartement en dessus !
Merci à Pam de sa gentillesse."
1820794,17934689,2014-08-19,7402415,Jen,"We had a great time staying at Pam's. The condo is very nice and looks exactly as it does in the pictures. The location was perfect. Queen Anne is a beautiful part of town, with amazing views and lots of great restaurants. We were able to walk to many of the other nice neighborhoods in Seattle as well. Pam was very helpful and a wonderful host. "
1820794,18163331,2014-08-23,2496449,Lynda,"What a lovely place to stay in Seattle. Pam has provided a comfortable, clean space. We really appreciated the washer and dryer. The backyard was a perfect place to relax and the location was convenient. Pam was a wonderful host. All of her suggestions were perfect. We especially enjoyed our dinner at nearby Crows. We also have to thank her for her flexibility with check in time."
1820794,18395969,2014-08-26,2384751,Kathy,"My husband & I stayed at the Highland Hideaway & we were so happy we found this place, it was wonderful.

The apartment is as pictured, with an amazing view, Had all the amenities you would need if you stayed a weekend, week, or longer. It was comfortable & cozy. The description in the profile is exactly as stated.

Pam had maps, flyers, magazines out for anything you wanted to know about the area.  Pam was so well informed and helpful for anything that was asked.

The private backyard with the covered patio was fantastic with the view of the Space Needle and the night lights were amazing.

We came to Seattle with a group of friends to celebrate the Big ""60"" birthdays. The rest of the group fell in love with the Hideaway. When the others found out their place had no backyard or no seating outside they wanted to have the celebration at the Hideaway.  Pam & Patrick graciously said we were welcomed to have the others over, and with enough seating on the patio for our group of ten, it worked out wonderfully. We had a great time.
Pam & Patrick are wonderful host and very accommodating. They are a joy to be around!!!

Don't pass up this place.  Great host, good location, and an apartment you won't want to leave. The great backyard with a wonderful covered patio with the best view of Seattle.

I would recommend the Highland Hideaway with Pam & Patrick highly.  We definitely would stay there if we have a chance to visit Seattle again.

Pam & Patrick are THE BEST!!!    

Thanks for everything,
Kathy & Rick
from Missouri

1820794,19117249,2014-09-07,13923957,Amberlee,Pam's space was as advertised and it was in a great location. Loved how accommodating they were and how great they were with anything and everything we needed. So nice and such a great way to stay in Seattle. Thank you Pam and Patric for everything. It was great
1820794,19587058,2014-09-15,13923957,Amberlee,Pam's space was as advertised. It was close to so many great places to eat and see that we enjoyed every minute we were there. Pam and Patrick were wonderful in helping us with anything we needed or questions we had. It was the perfect way to start our trip and end it.
1820794,19927692,2014-09-21,5642013,Erika,"Everything about our stay was absolutely perfect! The place was exactly as pictured on here. The view is breathtaking and wonderful to enjoy while sitting out on the patio enjoying a good book and a glass of wine. The location is very convenient to city center and within walking distance of many eateries. Pam and Patrick were such excellent hosts and if we come back to visit Seattle this would definitely be our top choice for a place to stay. One of the best we've experienced and highly recommended!!
Thank you!

1820794,21074903,2014-10-11,13388607,Matthew,"This trip was my first time travelling to America and I am very lucky that I picked such a great place to stay while I was in Seattle which is a city that has so much to do and the area that the house is in is very close to the city. My flight landed on the night and Pam had kindly given me information of the different ways of getting to the house from the airport and when I did get into the place there was a bottle of red wine waiting for me. The listing is as it is described on here, plus some extra bits like the vast number of DVD films which you can pick from. Pam and Patrick are very welcoming and friendly and were always happy to help if I had any questions.
If I am ever to visit Seattle again (and I hope I do) then I would 100% stay here again."
1820794,21655004,2014-10-21,19574003,Britt,"We loved our time at the Highland Hideaway! My husband and I came to Seattle for some medical treatments and were looking for a private, quiet place to stay. This location was both of those things and not to mention very comfortable. Pam was more than accommodating and responded to our questions and requests immediately.  It is a really great location- near restaurants, grocery stores and attractions. They are all within a few blocks.  Would highly recommend!"
1820794,21837003,2014-10-25,718725,Simon,"Very much enjoyed staying at Pam's ""Highland Hideaway"" on a return trip to Seattle. Having stayed downtown on previous visits, it was really interesting to try a different location, and the views of the Space Needle and Downtown we're fantastic! The apartment was clean and comfortable with great facilities and lots of space. Pam stopped by just after we arrived to make sure everything was ok and gave us a few local tips, but otherwise we had the place to ourselves. Getting to and from Downtown was very easy with the city buses and there were several cute places for dinner and breakfast in the neighbourhood too. Thoroughly recommended!"
1820794,22015005,2014-10-28,15189661,Kim,"We didn't get a chance to meet Pam and only briefly met Patrick, but our stay was great. Pam was readily available to contact and was quick to respond. The place was clean, comfortable, and nicely decorated. You can tell Pam and Patrick put a lot of thought in to their rental and everything we could have possibly needed was provided. We had rented a car and the location was perfect. We were able to get everywhere we wanted within minutes. Would recommend 100%!"
1820794,22246329,2014-11-02,21662941,Ashley,This was my first time ever using Airbnb and it could not have been more perfect.  The room is exactly as the photos depict.  It's so well done...clean and cozy and it has everything you could need.  The location could not be better.  We walked downtown each day and enjoyed ourselves before walking back in the evening.  And the view!  Oh my gosh!  The view of the Space Needle from the room (and the bed!) is just the most wonderful added touch to make you feel like you're really getting the best Seattle experience possible.  I would be shocked if there is anywhere better in the city to stay.  You should absolutely stay here...or maybe you shouldn't because then it will be booked when I visit next time and I'll have to begrudgingly look for somewhere else. 
1820794,22399132,2014-11-05,3670216,Maria Luisa,"Another wonderful Airbnb experience!
Our host, Pam welcomed us with a nice bottle of Cabernet that was perfect for a cold night. The apartment was exactly as stated…comfortable, clean and cozy. The private backyard with the covered patio was fantastic with the view of the Space Needle and the night lights were amazing. The location was  very convenient and parking was ample – Pam was gracious enough to offer her driveway in the event that we cannot find parking when we come home.
Pam had maps, flyers, magazines out for anything you wanted to know about the area and was always just an email away for any questions we might have.  Her apartment was close to everything but away from the stress of the city.
A definite thumbs up!

1820794,23434007,2014-12-01,14243248,Karen,Lovely apartment! Pam and Patrick have a great space and accommodations. Would love to come back to Seattle and stay here again. My future Air BnB stays will have a lot to live up to! Thanks Pam!
1820794,23640606,2014-12-07,74747,Courtney & Julie,Pam's space was perfect! Just the right size for my us and our dog. It was so great to be able to bring him on this quick trip. The location was exactly what we needed (walking distance to the convention center) and the apartment-styled space left nothing to be desired. Pam greeted us shortly after our arrival (which was smooth with great directions/remote access) and we never felt like we were in the way. The backyard and view were great! Thank you Pam for such a wonderfully suited spot in Seattle- definitely on our list of favorites!
1820794,23868756,2014-12-13,19873556,Vicki,"This little hideaway was just as cute and nice as it looks online.  We were very comfortable and Pam thought of everything to make our stay enjoyable.  She had decorated for Christmas and we even found a bottle of wine waiting for us.  The unit opens onto the back yard and patio which was for our use.  It was great first of all, to find a nice place that allowed our dog, but also to have a green space available for her.   The location is great if you want to be in the Seattle Center or Queen Anne Hill area.  Weather permitting "
1820794,23986613,2014-12-15,19523903,Tanveer,I had a blissful experience staying at Pam Smith's residence. The cottage is in an ideal location with its own private entrance and a beautiful view of the space needle. Pam was very welcoming and flexible throughout my whole stay there. We liked the space so much that we decided to extend it for an additional day.
1820794,24642595,2015-01-01,22551885,Don,"We had wonderful experience at Pam’s place.  The unit was just as nice as the pictures showed.  It was clean and cozy and well decorated (especially all of the holiday decorations).  Pam was very helpful and always available for answering questions.  The location in Queen Anne couldn’t have been better for us, with many restaurants and attractions nearby.  The ever-present view of the Space Needle was a great backdrop for our stay, and the New Year’s Eve fireworks were spectacular (Thanks Pam for letting us know to watch for them)."
1820794,24845001,2015-01-03,1994404,Roy,Pam is a wonderful and very friendly host. The home was so close to downtown Seattle we never needed to drive and ended up walking the entirety of our 3 day trip.
1820794,25239223,2015-01-10,24563093,Renee,"This was my first Airbnb reservation and I had a wonderful experience! This place is just as nice as it appears in the photos and has everything you need. It was our first time in Seattle and Pam was extremely helpful, providing us with maps and her feedback on where to go.  :)  Street parking was a breeze for us but the location of this apartment was so convenient that you don’t even need to drive. Thank you so much Pam for everything. We loved our stay!"
1820794,25340564,2015-01-12,25718384,Keith,"This was my first experience using AirBnb and i can honestly say that if the hosts are anything like the others on this website, i may never stay in a hotel again.

The place is much bigger then it appears in the photos. It is completely spotless and clean. It has all the items you would need to cook there and save money. It has free parking on the street (curb your tires). In a great neighborhood so don't worry about feeling unsafe.

I stayed here with my girlfriend who was ecstatic about the place we were staying at. We did not drive or take a taxi anywhere and still covered all the places from the needle, to pikes place, to Nordstroms, to the ferry where we took it across the Puget Sound into some cool little Island where we got coffee to sip on.

We only met Pam briefly but she was very nice and made us feel very welcome. We are giving this Five stars because it was more then we were expecting and we had a great time."
1820794,25508691,2015-01-18,7778369,Gale,Highland Hideaway was a great place to stay.  Perfect for two people.  Very clean and all of the necessities were there.  Very convenient to all of the things that we wanted to do in Seattle.  Parking was available on the street and Pam even let us use the driveway as we were coming back late one night.  We will definitely stay here again!! 
1820794,25799671,2015-01-26,9903475,Leyla,"Oh how we loved staying here! A charming and respectful hostess - she welcomed us upon arrival and then checked in later in the stay. IT was a beautiful place with an incredible yard and view. It was truly like staying in a nice hotel! We loved everything - the decor, the view, the garden, the quiet, the amenities and washing machine and TV and bathtub and vacuum cleaner - everything was really professional and perfect. We will certainly return. I hope we get to spend a little more time with Pam next time. A really great experience - thank you so much!!"
1820794,26054007,2015-02-02,25330691,Katherine,"This was our first time using airbnb and we were absolutely spoiled at Pam's and Patrick's place. Simply the view would have made it worth it. But Pam thought of everything and anything that you would need while away- even the little details- a bottle of wine upon arrival, new creamer in the fridge that we could enjoy in our coffee, a teapot, extra towels/sheets, iron, blow dryer, tons of little information packets giving us ideas and activities to do and see and eat while in Seattle. We didn't get to meet Patrick, but Pam was so sweet, nice, and extremely hospitable. We would choose to stay here over a hotel any day. Thanks again for everything! Hope to be back again!"
1820794,26163052,2015-02-05,26500921,Amelia,"This was the perfect first Airbnb experience! The apartment was just as it is pictured and the view is incredible! I met Pam the very first night I arrived. She checked in to make sure things were comfortable and to see if I needed anything. Pam had thought of everything including fresh coffee, extra towels and blankets, wine, toiletries, even a sweet note wishing me good luck on the job interview I was in town for.  Having lived in Seattle before, I was familiar with the area and can say that the location is great if you are visiting Seattle and want to have access to downtown, the sites and public transportation. Plus, the apartment has all kinds of local maps, brochures, magazines, etc. to keep visitors up-to-date on what's happening around town. Thank you Pam and Patrick for a lovely stay! "
1820794,26257792,2015-02-08,10413283,Lisa,"If I could give this space 10 stars, I would.  I loved staying here and Pam went above and beyond to be accommodating to me.  I'm familiar with the Seattle area, but my boyfriend had never been before so I flew him out to celebrate his birthday.  Pam left a super helpful map of the Queen Anne area and we had breakfast and dinner at two of her recommended spots (Citizen & Laredo) - both were awesome! We didn't have a car and that was no problem at all - tons of walkable things to do and the farthest we went was to the arboretum and it was only a $13 cab.  The apartment itself is exactly as pictured and described.  Clean, welcoming and beautiful. Stay here - you won't regret it! :)  "
1820794,26583796,2015-02-16,18835925,Ilana,"In a word, perfect!! I can't say enough good things about our stay, and specifically about Pam.  She is a fantastic hostess and really went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to stay in the Seattle area."
1820794,26767048,2015-02-18,7747833,Mitchell,My wife and I absolutely loved the place! The pictures are spot on and Pam was extremely quick to respond and answer any questions we had along with having maps and different pamphlets of information about Seattle restaurants and things to do in the apartment which was really nice. The view is spectacular as well!
1820794,26916080,2015-02-22,6376061,Melanie,"I stayed with a friend in Pam and Patrick's highland hideaway this past weekend and I can't say enough good things! The unit was exactly as shown in the posted pictures and the location was wonderful, close to downtown and the space needle, but still quiet and cozy. Everything was very clean and comfortable, and all that we needed (like kitchen supplies) were thoughtfully provided. More than just a great place to stay, we felt very welcomed but we're definitely still given our privacy. Pam always made sure to let us know she was available if we needed absolutely anything, but allowed us to enjoy our vacation without worrying about feeling intruded on? Additionally, there was a ton of helpful maps, guides, etc. including a map of The neighborhood with key locations (grocery store, good coffee, where shops/restaurants are located) noted on it provided in the unit which was awesome. If you're considering staying here, do it, you won't be disappointed! "
1820794,27255911,2015-03-01,25744985,Emilie,Pam is very welcoming and always available for recommendations and help :) The apartment is exactly like in the pics and the neighborhood is quiet and relaxing !

The unit was very clean and had everything we needed, from maps of the surrounding area to coffee and wine. The location was very easy to get to, whether it be by bus or Uber from downtown. The view of the Space Needle from Queen Anne is also very stunning. Definitely recommend!"
1820794,28072246,2015-03-17,15516831,Michael,"Pam and Patrick provide an oasis in the heart of Seattle.  Their space is peaceful, quite, clean and comfortable.  Their attention to detail is impeccable.  Having anticipated every conceivable need or desire of their guests.  We were greeted with a personal cheery message and a bottle of wine along with hand-marked maps of ""must-see"" places and sights in the Seattle area.  After we were settled they came down to greet us personally and let us know they were available but never intruded on our privacy.  Five stars!  We would definitely visit this property again and highly recommend it!"
1820794,28256138,2015-03-21,5736436,Mary,"My co- worker and I had a business trip planned for Seattle and this was the perfect choice in lodging. Our hosts made us feel welcome with a bottle of wine and a kind greeting board. The home was clean, spacious and comfortable. I would definitely choose this home again. It was nice to have a full kitchenette and laundry area. Parking was free. Great place for walking. We got our daily walk in going to and from the convention center. Highly recommend!!!! "
1820794,28558462,2015-03-26,26438826,Kendra,"Clean! Clean! Clean! I'm a little OCD when it comes to staying at other places but Pams little hideaway  far exceeded my expectations!!! Not only that, but she was also an AMAZING host! Answering all my questions( no matter how crazy), making sure we were comfortable, she provided maps and made recommendations!! When we return to Seattle we will definitely make sure to book our stay with Pam again!  :)"
1820794,28863573,2015-03-31,4504438,David,"Pam & her husband were gracious hosts. Their beautiful home exceeded our expectations. It was clean, spacious and had everything we needed. I would highly recommend this AirBNB to anyone traveling to Seattle. "
1820794,29077016,2015-04-03,25555301,Kayla,"Pam's place was wonderful! It is in an amazing location and it was perfect for our small family of 3! We had our baby in a pack n play in the bonus room. We had an incredible view of the Space Needle from our room and it was an incredibly easy walk to downtown and the beautiful areas of Queen Anne. We not only loved the big things like washer and dryer in the unit and beautiful outdoor seating, but we also loved the small details like the coffee in room, toiletries in the bathroom and beverages in the fridge upon arrival! Thanks Pam for everything! We look forward to being back again!"
1820794,29191646,2015-04-05,8057772,Dan,"We had a great stay at the Highland Hideaway.  Pam was there to greet us when we arrived to be sure we had everything we needed. Amazing views of the Space Needle, great relaxing patio and all the accommodations of home (including a comfortable bed!).  Our dogs probably loved it as much as we did, as the fenced in yard of lush grass was perfect for them to run around and play in.   We also took advantage of the extensive DVD collection available and even watched the NCAA tourney on DirecTV.  Definitely a great place to stay for a Seattle excursion. Thanks again!"
1820794,29481387,2015-04-08,17217847,Judy,"My daughter and I had a blissful stay! By far the best airbnb experience I've had! From the thoughtful touches such as complimentary wine and coffee ( regular AND decaf) to the great view of the needle and an incredibly comfy bed with a record number of pillows...we didn't want to leave. We parked out car and hoofed it down the hill, took the monorail to downtown and then caught an Uber back. The location was superb and very convenient. Pam is delightful and very good with the communications.  I will definitely stay here again! "
1820794,29673815,2015-04-11,13081112,Monique,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay in Seattle! This airbnb experience was great. The Queen Anne neighborhood is beautiful and the apartment was very cozy, clean and comfortable. Thank you Pam for your hospitality! "
1820794,29865963,2015-04-13,28000147,Jamie,"Pam was very nice and helpful and the house is very clean just as descripted. Perfect location and neighborhood, it is only a few miles away from downtown and within walking distance to my favorite- Kerry Park. I would recommend anyone to stay with Pam. "
1820794,30288747,2015-04-20,27505757,Amanda,"Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. The listing was even better than described; huge space, totally cozy and welcoming. Pam even wrote a personalized welcome sign on a chalk board. The view from the space was incredible. Truly, if you are in Seattle. Stay here. Don't stay anywhere else. Also, the bed was super comfortable. If I could give this place 10 stars I would. "
1820794,30573124,2015-04-24,13030364,John,This place was amazing!!!! Easily one of the easiest and best experiences I've ever had on Airbnb. Pam was super friendly and a perfect host! We showed up and Pam had several maps laid out on the kitchen counter showing us her favorite places! Pam had wine sitting out for us and some water. This was a perfect place to stay in Seattle!  
1820794,31050190,2015-05-01,21064937,Andrina,"Very nicely situated, location near bus routes, good view, pleasantly private, well equipped, very clean - meets and exceeds all expectations. All in all a cozy little comfortable place to spend a few days. Thank you, Pam, for the continued good service!"
1820794,31626287,2015-05-08,24416382,Travis,"Upon our arrival, Pam reached out and provided us the detailed information for our week long stay.  Pam made our vacation stay seamless.  Our place was just as described, with plenty of added touches we didn't expect, but definitely appreciated.  We felt at home and safe.  The location of the property was absolutely amazing.  The view was priceless and to have it all outside your doorstep was incredible.  "
1820794,31771650,2015-05-10,7778369,Gale,"This is our second visit to Highland Hideaway and again we arrived to an immaculate, cozy place to stay.  We love staying there.  It is convenient to where we need to be and what we want to do.   Pam is excellent at communication always answering right back when I send her a message.  We look forward to staying there next time we are in Seattle. "
1820794,33218666,2015-05-26,19764726,Jasmin,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Highland Hideaway! Everything was as cozy and welcoming as shown on the pictures.  Pam was a great host and everything we might have needed was in the unit, including a lot of information about Seattle. We will come back everytime we visit Seattle and highly recommed it to others!"
1820794,33658408,2015-05-31,23904005,Matthew,"Pam was a great host! The place was beyond expectations. Fully stocked, convenient location, wonderful space, beautiful view of the city. Truly home away from home. We wanted to move in permanently! Pam? ;) "
1820794,33953955,2015-06-02,33504689,Julie,"This was our first time using Airbnb and what a great experience!!! Pam and her husband were right there to greet us and help us with our bags. We were then met with a warm welcoming sign for us (and a Happy Birthday wish to my husband) and a nice bottle of wine and some popcorn. Everything looks like it does in all the pictures and is homey, comfy, welcoming  and inviting! We LOVED this place and we will return on our next trip to Seattle! Thanks Pam and Patrick for EVERYTHING!!!!"
1820794,34189617,2015-06-06,3208569,Allison,"We would highly recommend the Highland Hideaway! ...Not to mention Pam was an excellent host! Not only is the place immaculate, but little touches here and there really helped welcome us and make our stay a great one (i.e. maps of the city and transportation, fliers for museums/things to do in the city, tons of magazines with food recommendations, etc).  We may have preferred to have a car rental during our whole visit, as there are some pretty steep hills in the neighborhood. But, it is a very short walk to city center and there is a lot to do right in Queen Anne alone.  Lovely place with everything you need, and a great view of the Space needle!"
1820794,34623721,2015-06-10,25847176,Terry,"Pam and Patrick provided the most lovely, luxurious, inviting and (truly) perfect retreat.  A beautiful, fully-equipped apartment with everything you could possibly need and a wonderful bottle of white wine and two wine glasses waiting for me.  Also, on the chalk board, a welcome to me and my cousin and her doggie!  The backyard is paradise and every single second I spent there was perfect.  Pam checked in on me numerous times to make sure everything was ok and her husband graciously printed a boarding pass for me.  I hope to go back next year.
"
1820794,34846065,2015-06-13,7917211,Mary,"A beautiful room with all the comforts of home plus an exceptional view day and night!  Pam is a gracious, accommodating and attentive hostess and we thoroughly enjoyed our short stay in the Highland Hideaway.  

We had stayed in a Seattle hotel for one night on our first day in Seattle before taking the Amtrak to Vancouver (go USA!) and on our return trip to Seattle stayed at Pam's place for three nights.  Not only is Highland Hideaway a fraction of the cost of a decent Seattle hotel room, it is more spacious, more inviting, more serene, private and a convenient bus trip to many of the sights around Seattle.

We would stay here again in a heartbeat if we are ever fortunate enough to visit Seattle again.

Thanks Pam for a lovely stay and for sharing your home!"
1820794,35060214,2015-06-15,26136181,Cindy,This was our first Airbnb experience and we were so happy with it. The place was just as it was described and had everything that we needed and more! The Smiths were in touch with us a few days before we arrived to make sure we had all our questions answered. They were available to us during our stay without intruding. We plan on using this place as a home away from home in Seattle!!! Thank you for sharing your home with us!
1820794,35366234,2015-06-18,24503551,Lana,"There is nothing about Pams home that you can't love, except maybe the hilly walk ;-) 
Pam was very friendly & was kind enough to have a bottle of wine waiting for us on our arrival. Also as our flight was delayed we had the luxury of checking out later & leaving our belongings, thanks, that was very appreciated. 
If we should ever come back to Seattle we'd be sure to rent their home again it's just beautiful & so well located. 
"
1820794,35711826,2015-06-21,35089893,Nelson,"I felt incredibly welcome, with a personalized note and a bottle of wine. The view was actually more incredible than the pictures could do it justice. Very nice and quiet neighborhood. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Seattle, the location is prime."
1820794,36024537,2015-06-24,8462174,Sarah,"Pam was a great host, very friendly and had everything prepared for us. She was happy to answer any questions and had a great selection of maps set out. The space has everything you might need and a lovely view of the Seattle skyline. "
1820794,36165417,2015-06-26,26324243,Karlo,Loved it here.  Pam had the room ready 3 hours before check-in to accommodate my schedule.  She responded to all questions immediately and was helpful.  The room was exactly as advertised and very comfortable.
1820794,36774692,2015-07-01,28243661,Pat,"Pam was an excellent host. She had everything ready in the apt. when we arrived including maps, bus routes, entertainment guides and a bottle of wine! She answered all our questions when we arrived and was available to answer more as they came up. The view was spectacular and the neighborhood was awesome. The apt. was exactly what we expected - perfect!"
1820794,37041088,2015-07-04,30420290,Lauren,"The perfect little get-away. Pam was very welcoming and kept the place spotless. We really enjoyed how convenient of a location it was in, especially with the parking, and yet secluded enough that we could enjoy a quiet breakfast on the patio.  Thanks for the wonderful stay!"
1820794,37440303,2015-07-07,10313406,David,The welcome was excellent and Pam went out of her way to make it easy for us to drop off our luggage before we returned  our hire car. The property is in a stunning location and is extremely well equipt. We really enjoyed our stay and explored Queen Anne and downtown Seattle walking from the appartment.. 
1820794,37732271,2015-07-10,7448489,Nancee,"Pam was an awesome host! Super attentive and the place was even better than the photos show!! Pam left maps for getting around, there was even a bottle of wine, coffee and a personal welcome on a chalkboard!! The house is on a steep hill and there are a few steps to get down to the apartment but it was no problem for us - when we needed to go downtown we used Uber and never waited more than four minutes for them to arrive! This place was great and we highly recommend it to anyone traveling to Seattle!! We will definitely stay there again!!  "
1820794,38100443,2015-07-13,28970161,Rachel,Pam and Patrick's place is a dream! It has one of the most amazing views I have ever seen! Pam is there to help with any questions you may have and to make recommendations. This place is great for a longer stay because there is a FULL working kitchen and a private and very clean bathroom. It's an apartment! The closet is sooo big it works for a Pack and Play too. We really enjoyed the patio where we could look at the great views and sip our bottle of wine that was waiting for us when we arrived. I can't wait to go back to Seattle and stay here again. Thanks for the excellent accommodations! 
1820794,38476800,2015-07-16,26791144,Pauline,"Great experience here!  Pam was very welcoming and responsive as a host.  The space is adorable and cozy - with details like wine, a welcome message on the chalk board, local maps and magazines, and cable TV.  The only thing to note is that the front door is transparent, but we didn't mind since the view was of the Seattle space needle by night!  Neighborhood is on a beautiful hill and close to the lake, downtown, and a lovely park.  Definitely a recommended experience!  "
1820794,39259947,2015-07-22,23114103,Sonja,"Pam ist eine tolle Gastgerberin! Jede Anfrage wurde sehr schnell und ausführlich beantwortet. Der Empfang war sehr herzlich, neben einem Begrüßungsanschreiben haben wir zahlreiche Informationen über Seattle (sehr hilfreich) und eine schöne Flasche Wein erhalten. Herzlichen Dank!!! Die Wohnung und die Lage (ruhig, aber dennoch sehr zentral) haben uns uns auch sehr gut gefallen. Vor allem die eigene Terrasse ist sehr schön. Für uns waren es perfekte Tage."
1820794,39726942,2015-07-26,26286444,Fabrice,"Nous avons passé un excellent séjour à Seattle. L'appartement de Pam est très agréable, très confortable et parfaitement équipé. Nous nous sentions comme chez nous. Nous avons aussi beaucoup aimé la grande terrasse et le jardin avec la vue sur la Space Needle. Le quartier est calme et l'appartement est bien situé. Il est facile de stationner sa voiture dans la rue (mais la pente est raide). Il y a un arrêt de bus à proximité pour rejoindre rapidement le centre-ville, et on peut aller à pied au Seattle Center ou au Kerry Park qui sont proches. C'était notre première visite à Seattle. Nous avons adoré. 
"
1820794,40077718,2015-07-28,29117469,Julia,"What a lovely place to stay! Pam was very friendly and helpful ! She recommended a great Thai place which was delicious and welcome after our long journey, and it went perfectly with the complimentary bottle of red wine provided! A real treat! The place was cosy and comfortable, a very beautiful view and a perfect distance from the city. Would highly recommend this place to others and would definetely return! All amenities were great and worked perfectly. "
1820794,40435022,2015-07-31,22916039,Susan,"We absolutely loved this listing. Bright clean and exactly as shown in the photos. As well as the beautiful inside there was a private patio and garden. Pam was very welcoming and friendly and there were many special touches such as a celebration drink and all the tourist info to plan your stay was waiting for you. The apartment was very accessible by foot, public transport or inexpensive cabs, you do not need a car to see all of Seattle. We  would absolutely stay here again and we thank Pam for making our all too brief stay so pleasant."
1820794,40705146,2015-08-02,25545183,Marcella,"Great view, close to Seattle center, easy to find, wonderful welcome. Great hosts, apartment is well appointed. Bed is great. Wonderful DVD library. Great coffee. The personal touches, such as bottle of welcome wine and map of the area were really appreciated.  We felt at home. Would stay again.
Easy parking. Lots of hills but easy to uber or transit of you don't have a car."
1820794,41387498,2015-08-07,32004166,Michael,"The condo was great.  Located right in the heart of the Queen Anne neighborhood with an awesome view of the Space Needle.  Several grocery stores and numerous excellent food/coffee/snack options are all a short walk away.  Condo itself is located on the lower level of a multi-floor home, offering a secluded guest experience with a distinct/segregated entrance from the main home.  The backyard and patio were excellent/large and great for early morning meals/coffee.  Neighborhood felt very safe and ample/free/street car parking was available within steps of the front door.  This is the perfect place to stay if you'd like a home base when exploring/enjoying downtown Seattle and the surrounding area!

Pam was extremely hospitable and made us feel at home weeks before we even arrived.  She was easily accessible via email/text message and communicated access/location/check-in and the condo functions very well.  "
1820794,41719171,2015-08-09,19293928,Alison,What a wonderful experience. Absolutely gorgeous apartment equipped with everything you could possibly want and in such a lovely location. The view of the city and Space needle are gorgeous. I really can't think of a better place to stay in Seattle and Pam and Patrick were wonderful and thoughtful hosts. Thank you both so much. 
1820794,42371947,2015-08-13,23228447,Kathleen,"The accommodations were perfect. Clean, comfortable and new. I was greeted with a lovely bottle of wine and a nice chat with Pam. I learned quickly why the neighborhood is called Upper Queen Anne it was quite a walk straight up a hill to get back from the Seattle center. I used Uber for the next trip up the hill.
 The location was very convenient and I enjoyed suit in on the patio and looking down at the Space Needle. I highly recommend staying at this B&B"
1820794,42649558,2015-08-15,6239050,Cecelia,Pam's place has all the comforts of home and a great location. Pam herself was a great host and made us feel welcome.  Definitely will come back and highly recommend a stay here!
1820794,43031558,2015-08-17,6819382,Chad,"Pam was the perfect host and the location can't be beat.  The apartment is decked out with everything you could need, very clean, comfortable and the view from bed is postcard worthy.  It's clear that Pam enjoys hosting people and went above and beyond in creating a relaxing and comfortable place, and in providing recommendations and guides for visitors new to Seattle.  Favorite part (tied with the view) was the oh-so-comfortable bed."
1820794,43392047,2015-08-19,37685313,Liz,"Our stay at your fabulous Queen Anne neighborhood home was the perfect introduction to Airbnb! 
We loved the wine (I usually don't like red but that was absolutely delicious!), the helpful Seattle tourist magazines and your reccomendations, the well kept apartment with everything we could possibly need, the adorable kitty, and the nice checkins from you to make sure we were doing okay.
I really enjoyed my stay and would tell anyone visiting Seattle to stay with you! The location made it so easy for us to explore everything we had hoped to. Thank you for such a great Seattle stay!"
1820794,43739978,2015-08-22,6219295,Steffi,"It was our first experience with AirBnB and it was awesome. The flat was really nice and we had so much space. Pam is a very friendly host and we felt like home. 
The flat is in Queen Anne. This part of Seattle is absolutely great. We walked every day to downtown or took the bus almost next door. My husband and I just felt in love with Seattle, it's a fantastic city. 
"
1820794,44091333,2015-08-24,6239050,Cecelia,This was our second time with Pam and it was every bit as comfortable and wonderful as the first time.  Highly recommend it!
1820794,44431584,2015-08-26,36211329,Becky,Thank you again Pam for sharing your space with us.  It was very private and nice and worked very well with its close proximity to downtown.  Accommodations had everything!
1820794,45923486,2015-09-07,23159444,Lisa & Daniel,"We really enjoyed staying at Pam's & Patrick's little hideaway with that amazing view!
Waking up every morning was so much fun!
The flat was very clean, tidy and so well equipped. Exactly what we needed after a 3 weeks road trip. Pam left a map for us with recommendation in the area and everything is easy to reach from Queen Anne. That was so helpful! Thanks again!"

Danke für 4 Wochen Aufenthalt in Eurer Wohnung!
Wie immer  ( Zweiter Aufenthalt bei Euch) hat es uns 
ausgezeichnet gefallen. Danke für Euren netten Empfang
mit Begrüßungswein und Begrüßungstafel an der Wand.
Wir haben uns rundum wohlgefühlt und natürlich zusammen
mit unserem Enkelkind die Terrasse und den zugehörigen 
Garten mit Blick auf die Space Needle genossen.
Es war schon etwas wie zweite Heimat bei Euch und wir hoffen,
dieses Erlebnis im nächsten Jahr zu wiederholen.

Bis dahin alle guten Wünsche für Euch und
""Thanks for your hospitality"" !

1820794,50918160,2015-10-16,25542991,Stacey,"Pam's place was beyond my expectations! It was perfect! The space is much bigger than the pictures make it seem, it's wonderfully decorated, the bed is comfortable, and well, you can't beat the view!! The place is on a quite a hill, but if you walk everywhere (like we did) then you'll definitely burn off all the food and drinking that you'll do in Seattle! She gave some great recommendation to go for breakfast and other places of interest in her neighborhood. I would definitely recommend staying at Pam's place! "
1820794,51114468,2015-10-18,170523,Eva,"Pam's place was clean, comfortable and super convenient for all my plans. Pam communicated promptly and clearly with me about everything. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. "
1820794,52059915,2015-10-26,41389074,Jamie,"This. place. is. amazing.  I cannot say enough positive things about our stay at Pam's Highland Hideaway.  This was my first time using Airbnb, and I can't imagine a better experience.  You set the bar pretty high, Pam! :) The location is fabulous - within walking distance of many great restaurants, bars, and all the must-dos we had on our list (Space Needle, EMP, Pike Place Market, etc.).  Pam was a most gracious host.  From the complimentary bottle of wine and bag of popcorn (!!) to the walking map & list of recs to the sweet message left on the chalk board, we were always finding some small token that made us feel most welcome.  Pam was sweet enough to stop by to make sure everything was okay and was readily available via email/text/or in person to help with suggestions, recommendations, and transportation tips whenever we had any questions.  The apartment itself was incredibly lovely.  The perfect amount of space for two people.  And the view of the Space Needle never got old!!  Easy parking....fantastic private backyard....comfy bed...so many kitchen and bath amenities....the list can go on and on.  THANK YOU for a wonderful experience!!  Both Christy and I already miss it so much, and can't wait to return to Seattle and hopefully stay at the Highland Hideaway once again!  
"
1820794,52671497,2015-11-01,3931413,John,This is a beautiful apartment with everything you could want. Good transport links and in a good location. An ideal place to stay. I loved it. Be aware that the the lovely view is high up as the property is on a steep hill. Worth it though.
1820794,53069072,2015-11-04,9269542,Buddy,"Pam was very helpful before and during my stay at the apt. giving specific details on when I arrived (late at night) and checking in the next morning to make sure everything was o.k.  (it was:)

The space is bigger than I imagined yet just as pictured; clean, complete and efficient with coffee and a bottle of wine awaiting.   The apt. was very clean.    The location for those working or visiting the downtown area is beyond perfect and easily accessible to the freeways to go further afield.   It is very quiet and has a lovely lawn (pastoral feel) with a view of the Space Needle.  It is in the East Queen Anne district and Pam provided a useful map with locations like Trade Joe's etc. which is only 3/4 mile away.  When I return to Seattle I would make this my 1st choice in the future.   Perfect for a couple or perhaps a couple with a baby too as there is a small ante room next to the main bed.   There was even an umbrella for guests…very thoughtful."
1820794,53599279,2015-11-10,4160926,Alessandra,"Pam and Patrick are great hosts that really want to make your stay as pleasant has possible. They provided brochures, magazines, maps and tips for things to do in Seattle. Check in went flawless and communication during booking was very smooth (didn't have any questions during my stay). The location is great, the view is awesome, the apartment is very comfortable, clean and equipped with pretty much everything you need. Coffee maker, stove, pots, pans, kitchen utensils, washer, dryer, alarm clock, tv, toaster. The bottle of wine and the popcorn were a real bonus. To make a long story short: highly recommended!"
1820794,54969395,2015-11-27,13028272,Richard,"What an awesome place Pam's place is. Pam was lovely, we were very comfortable and had everything at our fingertips, and what a view from the house. Seattle is a beautiful city and we had a fabulous time. We would recommend Pam's place so so much, it was an amazing space, and even the cats came to say hi. "
1820794,55114453,2015-11-28,46386939,Elliot,"We had such a great time at Pam's place. It was in a great location, private, clean, and easy. We have a big (albeit well behaved) dog who stayed with us too and it was great to have a yard for him too. They were both welcoming and helpful and we would definitely stay there again."
1820794,55375770,2015-12-01,1559807,Sheryl,"This was a perfect place equipped with everything we needed.  The linens were very comfortable,kitchen equipped with everything we needed (loved the bottle of wine as a bonus).  Would comeback in a heartbeat.  One tip, if you drive a manual car park at the bottom of the curb, that is one steep hill and the fellow cars don't leave much room!  Thanks again!"
1820794,55792534,2015-12-06,4009163,Sennett,Pam's place was perfect!  Exactly as described and had everything we needed.  She provided all info necessary and even dropped by to say hi to make sure we were doing good and had everything we needed.  The view from the backyard is also very cool!  Pam went an extra mile and left us a bottle of wine and bag of popcorn which we enjoyed while watching some DirecTV.   I would definitely recommend staying here! 
1820794,56481316,2015-12-14,17426653,Andrea,"We loved our stay at the Highland Hideaway.  We were there before Christmas and Pam had used Christmas dishes and a few other touches to make the apartment special.  She included places, glasses and a bottle of wine on the table, along with a message of welcome.  The apartment was well laid out, cosy, modern with a great outside area.  The neighborhood is safe, beautiful and has views of the city.  Just be aware, if you're a walker, that the hills are steep!  The apartment is within a few blocks (10-15 minute walk) of several stores and restaurants, and Seattle Center.  This is our favorite Airbnb in Seattle so far, and perfect for a single or couple."
1820794,57427580,2015-12-26,1640544,Dan,Had a great Christmas stay at the Highland Hideaway. It's a beautiful mother-in-law suite in great condition with a fully equipped kitchen. Pam and Pat were gracious hosts
1820794,57629635,2015-12-28,43555486,Lorin,"We had an amazing stay at Pam & Patrick's place! The place is exactly as it seems!! Very cute and very comfortable! Pam is great! She was available for recommendations or questions, and left a map of the city with her recommendations. She made us feel very welcome, and even wrote welcome Lorin & Dan on a chalkboard for us to see... The keyless entry, made coming and going very easy! What a great first experience for Air BNB "
1820794,57875821,2015-12-30,34013588,William,"Pam was a great host! She was very responsive to any messages we sent, and all the information we needed during our stay was provided to us! We really enjoyed our stay there. We arrived in Seattle early, and Pam let us know when the place was ready for us to check in (before the actual check in time). 

She left out brochures for us, including maps, bus guides and attractions, which were very helpful. She also came by to greet us when we checked in, and also came out to say bye when we left (really early in the morning!). The check in/out process was easy too! "
4016650,27312972,2015-03-01,11280431,Alec,"My girlfriend and I had a very charming stay at the Gallery last weekend. The place is tastefully, comfortably furnished with a great view of Lake Union and Gas Works Park. There was limited street parking available, but there is a really easy to access public transportation. Brian was a great host and we look forward to our next stay. Highly recommended!"
4016650,28189981,2015-03-19,10132034,Ramani,"Brian and Lydia are classy, civilized people used to a sophisticated lifestyle.  Being in Brian's place compares favorably to being in a four or five star hotel:  luxurious bed and linens,  a walk-in closet, a million dollar view, original art on the walls, bagels and coffee for breakfast.  All  just a short bus ride from downtown.  Highly recommended!"
4016650,28369026,2015-03-22,29605127,Amy,"My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed our time spent at The Gallery. Both Brian and Lydia are warm and welcoming personalities. Lydia gave us fantastic recommendations for restaurants and local entertainment. We felt very at home, slept wonderfully, and woke to a breath taking view of Lake Union and the Cascades. Wish we could’ve stayed longer!"
4016650,28543080,2015-03-25,6080550,Chelsea,What an amazing experience staying at The Gallery! Such a lovely room with a beautiful view - we laid in bed and watched planes land and take off from the lake for hours. The guide book you put together really helped get us oriented not only to the house but the city as well by providing really helpful information on bus routes + the neighborhoods. Thank you for making this an easy and unforgettable experience! 
4016650,28826826,2015-03-30,3607343,Simon,"My wife and I had a wonderful stay at The Gallery!

Our delightful host Lydia was very helpful and easygoing.  She was very happy to offer recommendations when we asked for them, including pubs in Downtown and the Sunday market in Fremont.

The house was warm and welcoming and the view of Lake Union from the room was simply stunning.  The location was perfect and was the ideal base from which to explore the area; in particular, the house is served by many bus lines so Downtown is easy to reach.

Overall, we loved it and thoroughly recommend you visit soon!"
4016650,30148912,2015-04-18,5356219,Star,"I'm a frequent Airbnb user, this stay makes me reconsider if a  hotel might still be a better idea for a solo female traveler. 单独旅行女性，慎重选择。屋主和家管不是很友善。－一位在美国居住4年，airbnb常用用户提醒。

Day 1: ""Antique shop is not suitable for you."" It's what Brian told me, when I asked for vintage shopping (email hidden)e host has critical attitude.

The room is very clean and new, but it's cold in sleeping time. I only got 3 warm nights with heat on after the hosts got notified for this 18 nights stay. Brian explained the house would be too hot for him if the heat's on. The portable heater wasn't coming as he suggested. And he called me COLD BLOODED. Lydia was laughing next to him. what's funny?

The house location is perfectly in middle of the city, and a nice walking distance to Fremont. I appreciate the laundry is open for guests, and you'll have yogurt everyday! However, I couldn't be relaxed during the stay. Sound proof is not so good. you can hear everything above your room and the gate alert easily wakes me up. 

Host dresses very casual. You'll see Brain in blue bath robe ONLY in the living room at night. Lydia is hateful to guests. She believes everything you can HELP YOURSELF with that thick RESOURCE BINDER;She watches you every move.Anything you missed from the binder, you will be judged or yelled. Once she was not happy about me replacing a piece of foil for my old lemon.""It's wasteful."" she said.  Lydia is someone who hired to host the house, she is a nice host  only when Brian is around. 

I wish all upcoming guests won't have same experience as I had. As far as you know where to go, have Uber,gps set up, this is the best place for short stay. Break a leg!"
4016650,30403588,2015-04-21,29287937,Adam,"Got back last week from a great solo four day trip to Seattle, thanks in large part to the accommodations provided by Brian.  Brian set me up in a large, very comfortable room with huge closet, top notch bed and desk overlooking Lake Union (the pictures say it all).  Waking up with the sun rising over the Cascades, a coffee and bagel in my hand, sitting on one of the balconies, was really more than I expected.    

I was out most of the time and found the location very convenient.  The bus stop back from downtown is a few hundred feet away from the front door and while the stop downtown requires navigating some stairs to get under the Aurora Bridge, it was no big deal.  Once the bus arrived, it was about 15 minutes down to Pike Street.  Buying one of the ORCA cards at the beginning of the trip made paying for public transit easy and hassle free.  Recommended.

Brian was a great host.  Being the first time using an airbnb rental, Brian made me feel welcome from the time the front door openened (the smell of garlic simmering in the air) until I left.  No awkward moments, but nice casual conversation during our fairly brief encounters.  

Brian's home was very clean and nicely furnished.  I was offered use of his kitchen and enjoyed the privacy of bedroom and shared bathroom which never seemed to be used by anyone else.  All in all, a very enjoyable experience.       "
4016650,30650761,2015-04-25,19094434,Karl,"This was my first visit to Seattle to attend a conference and spend a few days seeing the city and area. Brian couldn't have been a better host. An unforeseen change in my plans could have been disastrous, but Brian patiently and graciously assisted me in getting it all worked out. The room was  comfortable and quiet, with a spectacular view of Lake Union and the sunrise. The directions provided from SeaTac via Link and bus were spot on, with only a one minute walk from the bus stop. On my next visit to Seattle, there will be a next visit, I will definitely consider staying at the Gallery. Thank you, Brian. You helped make my trip unforgettable. "
4016650,31131638,2015-05-02,21231352,Jody,"We arrived at the property and had very detailed instructions on how to gain access  as the host was not home from work.  It went without a hitch.  The directions were perfect.  We settled into our room and immediately loved the view overlooking Lake Washington.  Everything was comfortable and welcoming.  Lydia was a wonderful host and was very accommodating and friendly.  We enjoyed the access to the kitchen and appreciated the bagels and yogurt in the morning.  My daughter, husband and I loved this property as it was withing walking distance to the University of Washington and close to many restaurants and coffee shops.   I highly recommend it...:)"
4016650,31205724,2015-05-03,14648853,Russell,"Brian's place is awesome.  The decor is great, and accurately represented (if not better in person!).  Art everywhere, and amazing views.  

There were lots of great books about the area and travel destinations all over the place to glance through while relaxing.  The views of Lake Union were great as well, so it was easy to watch the boats on the water, and the seaplanes coming and going!  If you just want to rest a bit, the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in, so that's not a problem at all.

The steak house on the corner has amazing reviews, but might be out of the price range of most travels (it was definitely out of ours).  A little more of a walk gets you to some great selections, and delivery is always an option we found out as well.  It is a reasonable walk from Gasworks park, and near 2 different bus stops to let you get down town within a few minutes. 

All of this and more is in the binder he leaves in the kitchen for you to read through, and it's a great prep for your stay in the area.  If that's not enough, all you need is a quick 3 minute conversation with Lydia to know all the in's and out's of the area and everything it has to offer.  She helped us setup a phone app for bus schedules, and gave us tips on all the options around for the rest of our stay, even beyond our stay at The Gallery.

When we get back to Seattle next, we'll definitely look into staying there again!"
4016650,31826473,2015-05-10,1916436,Cyndi,"Staying here was such a luxury, the view was gorgeous and though I sat at the desk for several hours doing work, it didn't feel like ""work"" - it felt blissful.  The bed was super comfortable, towels thick and fluffy, plenty of closet space and both Brian and Lydia were wonderful to meet.  Very accommodating and all-out good people.  Hoping that my next visit will be longer than two days!"
4016650,32422196,2015-05-17,123505,Matt,"What a great visit !  My bedroom was quiet and comfortable (btw, LOVE the mattress and pillows!).  The Gallery was nicely appointed, clean, up to date, and yes, the views were superb!  Brian was out of town and Lydia, his host/representative, was there.  Because of my schedule, I didn't see her until my last day in Seattle.  She was very quick, though, to respond via text to answer any questions.  Lydia is a bright young woman, very personable, helpful, knows Seattle well, and is a perfect host.  
As a footnote, I was initially reluctant to stay in a place with a shared bathroom (shared with Lydia).  My concern was quite unnecessary as Lydia was virtually ""invisible""......I never felt I was ""sharing"" a bathroom.  I will certainly stay at the Gallery again!!!"
4016650,32818798,2015-05-22,28620478,Amy,We had excellent communication with the hosts! They were gracious and let us check in early since we flew in on a morning. The view is phenomonal! We'd stay again if possible.
4016650,33100263,2015-05-25,93566,Sam,"Brian's place is extremely pleasant and tastefully appointed, with a lovely view of Lake Union. It is convenient to Downtown by bus (or Uber/taxi), and downtown Queen Anne and Fremont are both a 20-30 minute walk or a quick Uber ride away. There isn't much in the way of services in the *immediate* vicinity on foot, but if you have a car, or walk one way and get a ride back the other, it's no big issue to get to downtown Queen Anne for Safeway and Trader Joe's.

Definitely a great value, and a delightful property. We were apparently the first people to use it without Brian or Lydia there, so I can't thank or compliment them in person, but we had a great stay."
4016650,33697879,2015-05-31,27317080,Jordan,"If you want to stay in a great area of Seattle in a room with an unbelievable view, with a friendly and welcoming host, look no further. My girlfriend and I stayed at The Gallery for 5 days and wish we never had to leave. The room itself is spacious, with a very comfortable bed and bedding, a large closet, a desk, two luggage racks, a private balcony, and an unbelievable view of Lake Union and Gas Works Park. We had a great time watching seaplanes take off and land from the comfort of our room. The guide Brian and Lydia provide is extremely thorough and helpful with regards to explaining everything from how to use the TV to a thorough guide of public transportation. The guide made exploring Seattle via public transportation very easy. We did not get the pleasure of meeting Lydia because she was traveling during our stay. However, we did get to meet Brian. Brian is a great host and a great guy. He was always very courteous and helpful and it was great getting to know him a little bit. For example, my girlfriend and I were sitting at a bus stop and Brian saw us from his car as he was driving by. Brian immediately stopped his car and offered to get us closer to our destination. I thought that was really great. We didn't see him all the time during the stay (it was almost like having the place to ourselves) but when we did see him, we had a great time talking to him.  I would recommend the gallery to anyone looking to stay at a wonderful place with a lot of information on exploring Seattle. Thank you so much for having us Brian."
4016650,34337488,2015-06-07,23614944,Eric,"Brian was a fantastic host and his property was exactly what I was looking for. It is located in an ideal location with public transportation options very accessible and mere minutes away from the Fremont neighborhood and downtown. Brian was great at responding to any correspondence in a timely manner and addressing any issues that arose. He also made sure there was yogurt, coffee and bagels for breakfast each morning which was a very nice touch. The reality of staying here absolutely lived up to the expectations of the photos of this listing. The view of Lake Union from the bedroom was enough to convince me to return here if I'm ever back in Seattle. I definitely recommend considering this property for your next trip to the Pacific Northwest.  "
4016650,35103784,2015-06-15,30192909,David,Overall an excellent experience. The process leading up to checkin was great. Brian was a great communicator and I had no trouble getting into the property.  The view was awesome from my room and it was a wonderful property.  The room and bathroom was spotless and I felt at home.
4016650,35471063,2015-06-19,32634283,Kevin,"Our recent stay at The Gallery was exactly as described in Brian's listing. We visited Seattle towards the end of a week-long PNW trip, and the comfort and amenities of The Gallery were exactly what we were looking for. The panoramic views, proximity to multiple neighborhoods, and access to transit made for a great stay in Seattle.

The private room and common areas are well appointed, and provide a quiet retreat away from the busy streets and crowds.

Brian was a great host, and provided solid advice and recommendations for our first visit to the city. The resource binder was a thing of beauty - and it answered all our questions about what to do and where to eat around town.

We hope to return to The Gallery on a future visit to Seattle."
4016650,37707664,2015-07-09,3257924,Natalie,"While I was unable to meet Brian personally, Lydia took great care of me! Every need was anticipated and I felt right at home. They even went the extra mile with providing an optional breakfast. Places and people like this don't come around often enough. Brian's home is pristine and beautiful, and the room had a gorgeous view, giving any tourist a wonderful introduction to the Pacific Northwest. Parking was simple, wifi was fast, location can't be beat and there was always a personal touch. I would highly recommend The Gallery to anyone."
4016650,38534412,2015-07-16,26468759,Maire,"I stayed at the Gallery with Brian and Lydia, his assistant  for one week. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The house is beautiful and has fabulous views over Lake Union. Brian and Lydia were very friendly and helpful. It's very easy to get a bus or an Uber downtown from here.  I would recommend this AirBnB to anyone. 
"
4016650,38917715,2015-07-19,37575590,Karen,"We had a wonderful stay at Brian's home. He and his assistant Lydia attended to every detail and were quite helpful with travel and restaurant suggestions. We felt very welcomed. Brian's new home is beautifully decorated with a comfortable bed and an exquisite view of Lake Union. It is in a residential neighborhood with easy access to bus lines and coffee shops within a 5 minute car ride. Finding a parking space was challenging on a few nights.  We were there during a heat spell and would have liked a fan. Brian plans to add that feature.  We highly recommend this bNb. It was comfortable, welcoming, in a convenient location and quite private.  A real find!"
4016650,39461554,2015-07-23,7379729,Tim,Brian and Lydia were really accommodating and superb hosts. The location and room were both brilliant and the view of Lake Union was simply brilliant. 
4016650,39809526,2015-07-26,37282565,Bryan,"Brian's unit was impeccably clean, offered a great view/bed, and he + Lydia were very helpful hosts. It was definitely a nice base for exploring Fremont/Ballard + Queen Anne. We drove up from PDX and parking is very difficult immediately near the apartment (just a limited # of spaces on their street) but if you are willing to walk ~3 minutes up/down a hill you are fine, so keep in that mind. It is right next to Canlis if you are thinking of eating there, was certainly nice to be able to walk there! Thanks again."
4016650,40837224,2015-08-02,24772821,Tony,The house was beautiful and couldn't ask for a better view outside your bedroom window.  Both Brian and Lydia were very gracious and offered suggestions of things to do around town.  Overall a fantastic experience!
4016650,41789414,2015-08-09,36903252,Karen,"Brian and Lydia were fantastic hosts. The room had an amazing view, and provided everything we needed for our stay in Seattle. Lydia provided several recommendations for where to eat/visit,  and helped us learn our way around public transportation. Would definitely recommend staying at the gallery!"
4016650,43082026,2015-08-17,33738018,Kelly,"I really enjoyed my time at the Gallery! I have to say that waking up the the view of Lake Union and enjoying it from the living room as well was my favorite thing about my stay. The bathroom is also fully stocked with amenities, which was also a huge plus from a convenience standpoint. The sun shines into the room in the morning, but there are blinds to shut out the light until you're ready to meet the day. I would highly recommend this listing and I hope to stay there in the future again!"
4016650,43443711,2015-08-19,40985861,Sophia,"Brian and Lydia were friendly hosts. Both were very helpful in responding my questions in timely manner throughout the reservation and the stay. The amazing lake view from the room provided the beautiful sunrise to be seen from the bed during the clear days. The cute balconies in the room and the living room were excellent for the tea and the breeze. Light breakfast was provided. Overall, the Gallery was cozy and beautiful, located in a quiet neighborhood, however on-street parking could be challenge. We enjoyed our stay."
4016650,43849500,2015-08-22,6094502,Min,"The Gallery is wonderful with a beautiful view of Lake Union outside of the window! I love it! Brian is such a gentleman,  very generous and put a lot of trust on me! Lydia helped arranging all the details which makes our staying smoothly and comfortable. Thank u Brian and Lydia, your place is the one I would like to revisit. "
4016650,44959821,2015-08-30,40440667,Cal,"Great stay, beautiful apartment with an awesome view of the lake.  Very clean, very comforting, highly recommend a stay at The Gallery.  And cant forget to mention the hosts - Lydia was fantastic to work with for the planning aspects and it was nice chatting with Brian - both of which were very happy to provide some great Seattle recommendations."
4016650,45333647,2015-09-01,9977209,Sundaresan,Great location and neat place. Will definitely recommend.
4016650,46005946,2015-09-07,18733487,Rachel,"Great location! Perfect accommodations. Fast communication with Lydia and Brian prior to arriving. Hard to find the townhouse at first. It's at the dead end of the cauldasack to the left (2nd building off street). Wonderful view of the city. The room and bathroom were clean and nice. Had a nice time visiting with Brian, he had some nice recommendations on places to eat. Only saw Lydia once, I think she just rents a room from him. This is embarrassing, but we clogged the toilet and Brian cou don't have been nicer about it. 
The directions to the bus routes could be clearer, also would have liked it if they pointed out specific locations to go to along with bus number. We downloaded bus route app, which helped us. We rented kayaks a few blocks from the place - so easy and a beautiful view on Lake Union. Would definitely recommend this place and stay here again!! "
4016650,47409476,2015-09-18,43455380,Sourish,Had a fantastic experience at the Gallery - gorgeous views as promised and very well maintained neat place. Brian and Lydia were friendly and easy to talk to. Hope to visit again sometime in the future.
4016650,48965211,2015-09-29,14104079,Rami,Listing was spot on. Location was perfect. The place was exactly what we expected. The room was clean. The bed was comfortable. Access to public transit was right down the street. The veiw! The veiw is awesome! We'll reach out to this host on our next visit to Seattle.
4016650,51505936,2015-10-20,27124317,Stacey,"This is the second time to visit Seattle. We arrived in night but Lydia is really nice to keep contact with us whenever we had any question. We total stay 3 nights and when we waked up in the morning, the view in the room is so fantastic and we are really glad we stay in Brian's house since we found out the duck boat tour was not any more available by one accident they met before. So we couldn't see the the view of Lake Union by duck boat. But we had so wonderful memory for staying Brain's house. Everything is perfect here. We will visit again when we will go to Seattle again! "
4016650,52431113,2015-10-29,41320477,Sicong,"Clean, warm, perfect lake view. Making my first few days in Seattle a very pleasant time. Met Brian and Lydia only once during my stay. They were both very friendly."
4016650,54365459,2015-11-18,49265912,Laura,I had a great experience staying at Brian's!!  Brian and Lydia were both very welcoming and accommodating and interesting to talk to.   The apartment is fairly close to the downtown area and there is a rapid transit bus stop nearby.  Getting to see the sun rise over Lake Union alone makes this place worth it!
3821822,17422187,2014-08-11,9930163,Sandra,"We loved staying at Jil's lovely place for the weekend! The basement one bedroom full bath and kitchen layout was perfect for two of us - it was clean, nicely decorated and cool, still light filled during the days. Plenty of powerplugs for all of our devices. Access to the place was super easy with the keycode lock. The E bus from downtown drops you off a block from the house. Easy parking in front of the house or behind. And a short walk to the lovely lake - I managed to get my running in every day because it was so easy and nice. A new Starbucks just opened on the corner of Aurora and 82nd...and there are more coffeeshops around there or towards the lake (bauhaus just opened a shop). This was a bit of a stay-cation, explore Seattle trip to test out neighborhoods somewhat outside of the central downtown area. Green Lake is wonderful for that quiet semi-suburban lifestyle. The lake access is just fantastic as well. "
3821822,17543353,2014-08-13,17686364,Ashlie,"Jil and her family were absolutely lovely. We stayed in her basement apartment for two days while house hunting in the area. My boyfriend and I had just moved to Seattle. Jil welcomed us on our first night and was available whenever we had questions, but totally respected our space at the same time. The apartment itself was adorable. We had everything we needed and more, including a fully-equipped kitchen with compost pile and recycling. The whole space was comfortable and clean. We couldn't have asked for more."
3821822,17599750,2014-08-14,19583194,Forrest,Cool apartment. Colorful. Lively. Arts. Fridi fan. Clean. Nice bed with new sheets. Friendly host. Happy. Satisfied.
3821822,17895366,2014-08-18,1695486,Tania,"A beautiful space in a great neighbourhood. Their home is very artistically decorated with many thoughtful details. We felt immediately comfortable and would have loved to stay longer, can't wait to come again! They are vey central to fun districts like Ballard and Fremont with tonnes of amazing restaurants nearby. There is great parking space at their location and they were very generous in letting us park our two vehicles there. Jill we thank you and your husband for enabling us to have an amazing weekend vacation! Your space is so lovely."
3821822,18145859,2014-08-22,18933251,Justin,"I had an amazing time staying in their new apartment. Jil and Curtis were very accommodating, informative and lovely hosts. I immediately felt at home. The apartment is cozy and well appointed. The Green Lake neighborhood is also welcoming and easy to walk around. "
3821822,18353137,2014-08-25,19699539,Sandy,"Loved, loved, loved the apartment. Jil and her family welcomed us with a lovely email after asking her for suggestions on what to do with our 8yr old in Seattle. We arrived to a clean and tastefully decorated 1 bedroom apartment appointed with all the items one would need for their stay. And there was more then enough space for the three members of our family. There is no TV, which we were perfectly okay with, but there are games, magazines and WIFI. It's also well located, we had a car and there was easy access to all the major roads. We also noticed easy bus service but didn't have a chance to take advantage. We enjoyed our stay and will book this again when traveling to Seattle."
3821822,19086061,2014-09-06,19605834,Stephanie,"Awesome basement apartment in the Greenlake area. The space was really cute and nicely decorated. My fiancé and I stayed 5 nights to check out Seattle and are planning a move. We didn't spend too much time at the apartment as we were out and about most of every day, but there was a nice eat-in kitchen which was nice to have in case we needed it. Jill was a great host, made herself available to us but gave us our privacy as well. "
3821822,19617437,2014-09-15,16464121,Marzena,"Jils place is and was fantastic!!!Jil is nice and was very helpful!No problem!There are few shops around and bus service E if you want to go downtown!!Also beautiful lake just few blocks from the house!Great experience!So if you looking for the place to stay around Greenlake,Fremnont ect this is the place to stay!Apartment is nice,clean and private!my stay there was great!thank you!"

3821822,19880290,2014-09-20,16431232,Holli,"You can tell a lot of effort was put into this little space.  The furniture and cabinets are attractive, and it was very clean.  The bathroom was really pretty!  It was a little musty smelling, and very small, but it worked fine for us since we only needed a place to sleep."
3821822,20031015,2014-09-22,16085801,Daniel,Wonderful location and very easy. 
3821822,20506812,2014-09-30,19689519,Joseph,"We felt at home instantly in Jil's Green lake apartment.   The area has shopping, restaurants and transportation near by and worked  well for our day trips to downtown Seattle, Mt Rainer,Tacoma and Olympia Washington.  One bedroom basement apartment, it was apparent immediately that an artist was involved in the decor which displays four of Jil's rice paper shades. Each shade is a work of art. The kitchen worked for fixing breakfast(could be used for lunch and dinner as well) and the garden provides a nice space for morning coffee.  All this including a private off street spot to park the car, we have found a getaway place in Seattle."
3821822,20793357,2014-10-05,5369465,Mary,"The apartment was in a great area of Seattle, in walking distance from a beautiful lake an running trail and just a public transit ride away from downtown. The apartment itself is very cute and just perfect for a weekend trip. Jil was a great host!"
3821822,20975117,2014-10-08,14732746,James,Jil was attentive and the apartment was exactly as described.  The space is extremely well done and my friends and I greatly enjoyed our stay!
3821822,21442392,2014-10-17,5153603,Renganathan,"The house is just a tad hard to find, but Jil provided great instructions to ensure you can get there. It was private, it was quiet, it was close to where I wanted to go. 

I loved the basement set up. It is way larger than what I expected and it was a great experience living there. "
3821822,21900770,2014-10-26,4256151,Yuli,"If anything, Jil and Curtis undersell the quality of their apartment. It is clean, colorful and most important of all - on a chilly, autumn day in the Pacific Northwest - totally cozy. This is a subtle and elegant place to stay that completely ""gets"" what it means to live and travel in the Northwest - all of the details (big and small) are handled with understated panache. I'll let you discover them when you stay here. "
3821822,22532188,2014-11-09,11077581,Laura,"Jil's space is so awesome! It is, a some reviewers mentioned, much bigger than it appeared. And so nicely decorated in a minimalist style, I wanted to actually live there!
Clean, quiet and comfy. 
The wifi is very strong, so you can catch the morning news on a stream and be ready for your day!
I was in Seattle for an event and some workshops, so I didn't get to see Jil (and her awesome son) until my second day.. but it felt like I already knew her. 
Secure, clean, quiet and perfect.
Thanks again, Jil! "
3821822,22807603,2014-11-15,8288991,Irene,"Our stay in Jil's home/apt was excellent.  The converted walk-out basement apartment was clean, bright, warm and had everything one would need for a perfect stay in the Seattle area.  The location is great. Walking distance to Greenlake park, PCC groceries and great coffee shops.  "
3821822,23159913,2014-11-24,4447770,Lauren,"The apartment was perfect for our stay in Seattle - very clean, stylish, and comfortable.  Jil quickly answered our questions and made our late check-in a breeze.  We were a little chilly upon first arriving in the apartment, but a space heater was provided that quickly warmed the place.  Highly recommended. "
3821822,23371459,2014-11-30,1518798,Angie,"I booked Jil's place for 2 of my cousins to stay over Thanksgiving long weekend. It was quite cold that weekend and we got snow in Seattle. The apartment was quite cold as it's in the basement of the house but space heater in the closet was there for them. My cousins enjoyed staying at Jil's place and said that it was very comfortable :) 

The place was clean, quite roomy with kitchen space, dining area, and nice entry way. The neighborhood was quiet at night and convenient for my cousins to catch a bus to Pike Place and downtown area.

Jil was away for part of the weekend but she was very communicative and made sure that her friend was available in case we need anything. 
I will definitely put my family at Jil's place again next holidays! "
3821822,23529568,2014-12-03,140410,Sonia,"Jil is a lovely and attentive host! The apartment is cozy and warm, even through the cold spell going on when we visited! It's a great location, walking distance to cafés (try Chocolati) and Greenlake. We were impressed with Jil's 'coffee bar' offering: you can prepare you coffee 4 ways and she even had a travel mug for our walk around the lake! "
3821822,24231577,2014-12-23,2054154,Irina,"Jil is a wonderful host. Everything in the apartment is done with care, attention, and thoughtfulness towards guests. It's like having your own apartment in the city, with all the necessities included. The place is sparkling clean, too. There is plenty of space for sleeping, sitting, and working. The kitchen is very spacious, and the table - very convenient for those who want to write or just work on their computer. The apartment is located in a great neighborhood. Greenlake is almost next door. My son and his wife and their baby stayed here, too, and they loved it. I have booked it on their recommendation, and I am so glad I did. This place provides comfort and autonomy. Thank you, Jil! "
3821822,25247244,2015-01-10,16973325,Stanley,"Great place. Easy parking. Very nice bathroom, spacious. "
3821822,25482630,2015-01-17,4016681,Kate,"We loved Jil's place! Would stay there again in a minute. Well appointed, beautifully decorated, it was a shame we didn't have more time to enjoy it!"
3821822,25775895,2015-01-25,1394532,Lindsey,"My husband and I stayed here to celebrate our one year anniversary. It was great, comfortable bed, nice bathroom, good kitchen, great location, Jil even had a bottle of champagne in the fridge for us. We really enjoyed our stay. :)"
3821822,26009724,2015-02-01,25826591,Eve,"The apartment was charming, spotless, and comfortable! It was spacious, quiet, and in a very private setting.  We were in Seattle for a brief 24-hour visit (partly business, partly pleasure, and first road trip with a baby), so we only interacted briefly with Jil's husband.  However, Jil thoughtfully provided a pack and play for our son to use, something we totally didn't expect! (We had arranged to borrow friends' bassinet.) She also gave us much appreciated suggestions about nearby places (such as PCC grocery). Since the apartment is in the basement, the floors are cold, so do bring slippers. The provided space heaters do a good job at taking the chill away.  The one issue we experienced was that we couldn't get the shower water very warm, even though we followed the directions. But we look forward to coming back!"
3821822,26532335,2015-02-15,7151695,Nathaniel,"We had a really wonderful experience here. it was our first time traveling with our baby and we were worried about a good sleep schedule and just feeling comfortable in our new surroundings. The basement apartment was very private and suited us perfectly.  Jil provided us with pak n' play for our son, the bed for us was more than cozy and all three of us slept great most nights. i was happy to find coffee and a variety of tea for us to enjoy and the small kitchen was great for us. the neighborhood is really nice, even though it's close to Aurora, it feels removed and private. It's a short walk to many different restaurants and just  a few blocks from a nice grocery store. We lucked out on the weather and enjoyed a beautiful day at the lake which was walk-able from here. all in all, these are really nice people and i would come back here anytime i come to seattle."
3821822,27090155,2015-02-25,25130273,Elly,"The space was spacious and cozy for us, and everything was tidy and clean. Jil owns her own studio making custom paper lamp shades, and you can see a lot of it around the room, which was pretty cool. Love the sweetness of the room—makes us feel very at home! I will definitely choose to stay here next time my family visits Seattle! :)"
3821822,27651543,2015-03-09,2054154,Irina,"Jil is a great host. Everything in the apartment has been thoughtfully selected to cater to all the needs of travelers- linens, dishes, furniture, fully equipped kitchen have a solid and tasteful quality to them. And the apartment affords autonomy and respite from daily stress. This is my second stay here, and my friend was delighted with the accommodations, too. If you are into walking, the location is 5 minutes away from Greenlake, one of the best spots in Seattle. I highly recommend it. Thank you, Jil! "
3821822,27959578,2015-03-15,5821296,Nora,"We had not stayed in the Green Lake neighbourhood before.  We were very pleasantly surprised.  The park around Green Lake is lovely.  We had a short walk from Jil's place to the park and enjoyed being outdoors and exploring the neighbourhood.  Lots to see and do.  Jil had provided maps and info about local restaurants, so we had ideas about where to go."
3821822,28331158,2015-03-22,27187588,Emilee,"We absolutely recommend Jil's Airbnb. It was spotless, comfortable and private. The location was super convenient and just a hop skip and jump to Seattle and other points of interest. We really couldn't have asked for more!"
3821822,28559399,2015-03-26,26602945,Martha,"This space was very private and inviting.  They have done a great job of making use of the space and making it feel comfortable.  The neighborhood was great for my two small kids and myself.  In our small amount of down time after sightseeing Seattle, we enjoyed Green Lake Park and the restaurants in walking distance.  Jil let me know it was safe to walk at night and that was very convenient.  Parking was great too and it was easy to drive wherever we needed to go.  Also a great natural foods market was nearby.  The space itself offered a clean remodeled bathroom and the coffee and tea was amazing.  My only experience so far with Airbnb was fantastic."
3821822,28886867,2015-03-31,27215036,Romina,"I loved staying here! Jil was a great host. The place was clean and neat, exactly how it is pictured. It was very private and felt like it was my own little place in Seattle. The location was also perfect and close to everything I needed. When I return, I'd love to stay here again!"
3821822,30096180,2015-04-17,11280134,Kristen,"Jil greeted us when we arrived.  She was able to let us check in early because her last guests left early in the morning.  The place was easy to find, and once you arrived at the house, Jil made it easy to find the apartment.  Everything was just as described and clean.  There wasn't a TV, which I've never encountered in an AirBnB/hotel, but it didn't detract from our experience there.  The neighborhood was great -- you're so close to many cafes, restaurants, and bars, and just a few blocks away from Greenlake.  I'd recommend!"
3821822,31659146,2015-05-08,31092156,Shane,"Great place, even better location!"
3821822,32204112,2015-05-15,31092156,Shane,"Great location, awesome set up.  Definitely reccomend these guys!!!!"
3821822,32908008,2015-05-23,8667149,Steve,"Curtis is well verse on what the neighbour offers - eateries and doctors- I needed that when I sprained my foot. Jill is very kind and takes time to show me her big variety of herbs and encourages me to use them, - the basement is very clean and well equipped and cool. The neighbourhood is safe and friendly too, within walking distance to small food and stores."
3821822,33278943,2015-05-26,15609687,Rachel,"Jill has a great apartment - it really made our stay in Seattle great!  There was plenty of room for the 3 of us to stay, and we used the kitchen for breakfasts and snacks.  The house was very clean, well stocked, and a great base for u!  Thanks Jill!"
3821822,33806806,2015-06-01,1399690,Anita,"Great location, great hosts, completely outfitted apartment. Very comfortable and clean. Photos were provided of the area and detailed instructions on access, parking, etc."
3821822,34537539,2015-06-09,28722441,Emily,"Our time in Jill's sweet & cozy apartment was just right. Cool, funky vibe with everything you need in the kitchen and all the comforts of home.
We had a run around Green Lake, walked to the local market, close & convenient public transport to downtown and the beach was just a short car ride west. Great location, great apartment, great hosts...will definitely be rebooking! Thanks Jill & Curtis! :)"
3821822,34797015,2015-06-12,2160353,Jackson,"Great location and friendly hosts! Jil was super easy to communicate with. Green Lake Park nearby made for a great mini-get-away from the city hubbub.  Would definitely recommend this place and stay here again. 

Earplugs recommended since it is a downstairs apartment and not the quietest. But the bed is super comfy and the apartment is clean, well stocked with tea and coffee, and has an artsy charm that is sure to please. 

Five stars! :)"
3821822,35330624,2015-06-17,33608428,Mathew,Great apartment. Great bed. Great experience. Thanks!!
3821822,35659021,2015-06-21,4134720,Dawson,Jill was a wonderful host. The space had everything we needed and was perfectly located. 
3821822,36272177,2015-06-27,5600199,Max,"Jil's place was great! Really fun and funky, it made for a really nice way to experience Seattle. Having a kitchen and laundry was great and it's right in the rapid transit line, making getting into and home from the city a breeze. (Look into getting an ORCA transit card before your visit, it'll help you not have to manage cash fares). Also a Starbucks and great eatery (The Woodlands) like a 2-minute walk from the house. Great location all around. 

Jil was a great host, providing thoughtful notes leading up to the stay and answering questions as I had them. They were quiet and accommodating, and their house is really cute. Would definitely recommend it to others. "
3821822,36594345,2015-06-29,24425507,Michael,"Jil's place is the bees! Seriously, that's the best way I could describe it. It's very clean, very pleasant and has an artist's touch to it. She lives in a hip part of town that's about a block off of a main strip in Seattle called Aurora. Also, she makes these amazing lamp shades that were on the lamps throughout the apartment adding to the overall style of the place. We had all of the essentials that we needed and then some. I would highly recommend staying at Jil's lovely getaway. Cheers!"
3821822,36774499,2015-07-01,8074219,Jennica,Had a great time in the apartment. It was in a cool neighborhood with bars and restaurants in walking distance and green lake. Very easy to take the express bus to downtown Seattle as well. Would recommend. Very cool lamps in the apt too. Nice touch. 
3821822,37015954,2015-07-03,802400,Chad,"Everything was perfect and as expected. Basement apartment kept very cool in the very hot weather, and was very comfortable with all the amenities you might need. Jil was very friendly and helpful. Located near a very busy street yet was very quiet. Perfect accommodations for a young family!"
3821822,37157185,2015-07-05,32232963,Melissa,"We very much enjoyed our stay. Jil & her husband were warm and welcoming, but gave us our privacy. The apartment is not only lovely, but very thoughtfully appointed. We had everything we needed in a space which was uncluttered & serene. We are a family of 3, and Jil very kindly showed our 4yr old some of the treasures in Jil's lush & beautiful garden."
3821822,37569674,2015-07-08,16964424,Frances," My husband and I enjoyed our stay at Sweet & Cozy, which actually is quite roomy and comfortable.  The location is great for getting into the center of Seattle, and Green Lake has much to offer with restaurants, pubs and the lake. The apt. is nicely decorated and was quite cool which was greatly appreciated in the unusually hot weather.
Our only negatives had to do with the towels and the frig/freezer.  There were two of us and only one hand towel and face cloth provided.  We were able to secure another hand towel from a cupboard, but not a face cloth.  The freezer in the under counter frig is in desperate need of being defrosted.  We bought some gelato and ended up drinking it as the freezer won't work with that much frost preventing the door from closing.
Having said that, would absolutely stay there again."
3821822,37856907,2015-07-11,10917657,Juliene,"This was our first AirBnB experience. It was so perfect, I worry nothing else will compare!"
3821822,38290151,2015-07-14,35110263,Heidi,"Jill met us and made sure we had everything we needed. She even gave me a great book to read! The neighborhood is great with access to a  PCC market and Greenlake. The apartment was accurate to the description and very comfortable, quiet and relaxing (and we were traveling with a toddler!) They have put a lot of care into the design of this apartment. It’s both beautiful and unfussy, with everything we needed at arms reach. With one nice bed in the bedroom and a really comfortable fold out bed in the living room,  it was the perfect amount of space and we slept great!  It was also perfect for our 2 1/2 year old, and Jil was really sweet and showed him the garden. This was my first air b n b experience and I’m afraid the bar has been set pretty high. Exceeded our expectations! "
3821822,38697634,2015-07-18,24163579,Laura,"This place was fantastic! Perfect spot for those visiting Seattle. For first timers like us it gave us access to the city in 15 mins, but also walking distance to the awesome green lake. We had a blast paddle boating there. The place is large, many different rooms, lots of (website hidden) wasn't necessary as it is a cool basement level place. We opened the windows once. Off street parking was a great amenity. Internet was easy and fast. Great great spot!"
3821822,39024060,2015-07-20,10588911,Sarah,Description is accurate.  Everything was awesome.
3821822,39292737,2015-07-22,34523503,Boyd,"Jil greeted us when when we arrived and she was a polite host.  The off-street parking was convenient.  The room was clean and pleasant.  Even though the windows looked out on ground level it felt very private and safe.  There was tea, bottled water and organic milk in the kitchen area.  The only thing missing that we would have liked was a microwave but Jil said she is getting that soon.  All in all it was a very nice stay."
3821822,39934617,2015-07-27,34134212,Matt,"Very nice and quiet place! We stayed here for 4 nights and nothing to complain about. They greeted us when we arrived and every time we bumped into them in driveway they were always asking if there was anything we needed. At one point my son locked the bathroom door closed, but Curtis had no problem getting it open...  If your looking for a place to lay your head in Seattle, with great looking lamp shades, this place was perfect. It's near tons of great restaurants and breweries. It's also just a quick 5-10 mins from downtown depending on the traffic. I would recommend to friends in the future"
3821822,40719413,2015-08-02,30553408,Nicole,Jil greeted us when we got there and was so friendly and welcoming if we ran into her while we were there. The apartment was a quick walk to Greenlake and several coffee shops and restaurants. Bus access was great. Apartment had everything we needed for our 5 day stay. 
3821822,41305832,2015-08-07,24156480,Birte,The first time with airbnb. Jil was very friendly and helpful. Everything was perfect and as expected. Basement apartment was very comfortable with all the amenities you might need. The green Lake  is in walking distance. We had a great time here.
3821822,41963026,2015-08-10,10068601,Christel,The flat was exactly as advertised with restaurants and Green Lake just a few minutes walk away. The kitchen was well stocked to make simple meals and fresh coffee.  It's a great place to stay if you want easy access to downtown Seattle but also want peace and quiet at the end of the day.
3821822,42532649,2015-08-14,34916442,Diane,Jil was accommodating when we arrived a little early. The apartment was as described and well laid out. It was very convenient to a bus line that was a quick ride into downtown Seattle so we were able to get around without driving when we were headed into the downtown. There was a great breakfast place a block away that also served microbrew in the evening. We would definitely stay again. 
3821822,45773582,2015-09-06,13034206,Cortney,"Jil's apartment is great. It's near Greenlake, has great wifi, has parking, and was perfect for our week stay. I slept on the sofa bed and found it comfortable. As others have mention there isn't a TV, but who needs one when you're in Seattle!  Plus, the wifi was good for streaming (-:  I would recommend Jil's place to friend or family. "
3821822,46925980,2015-09-14,23755955,Lindsey,"We had a lovely time at Jil's place. She knew we were arriving late and left the lights on for us (and they were beautiful lamps too, made by Jil herself). She also provided thorough directions that helped us to find the place easily. We tend to not be the most outgoing people and keep to ourselves, and we very much appreciated that even though Jil and her family lived above us, they respected our privacy. The space was well-decorated, and you can tell a lot of thought was put into making it both comfortable and functional. The kitchen was well stocked with utensils and cookware and the bed was heavenly! We loved having a little ""home"" to come to at night after exploring the city all day. Jil also thoughtfully left post-it's throughout the space with tips on making our stay more comfortable. One literal heads up, and not a complaint at all, but just a warning if you are very tall: since it is a basement apartment, the ceiling is a little low. At 5'9"" I had no issue, but my husband's 6'6"" head brushed the ceiling in a few spots. It didn't bother him at all. We would both happily return should we visit Seattle again."
3821822,47195113,2015-09-16,17481536,Barry,"Jil's place was in a great location for me, surprisingly easy to get to and from downtown. The place looks like much was recently renovated, was clean and well kept. Nice to have easy access to the lake and nearby dining options."
3821822,48546127,2015-09-27,7246816,Charlotte,Jil's apartment is very stylish. We loved it. Green Lake is nearby with a good selection of neighbourhood restaurants and Downtown is just 15 minutes drive away. A perfect spot to explore Seattle from.
3821822,49057047,2015-09-30,2205934,Henk,Sfeervol en persoonlijk ingericht appartement met aandacht voor detail. Alle basis voorzieningen zijn aanwezig. Goed bereikbaar met openbaar vervoer. Jill is indien nodig makkelijk bereikbaar en een prima gastvrouw. Jill dank voor je gastvrijheid en ontvangst.
3821822,49487612,2015-10-04,30293293,Randal,"Working with Jil is very easy and she responded quickly to my questions. Jil's basement apartment is cozy and clean, as advertised, with everything we needed - a stylish private space in a great Seattle neighborhood. Merely blocks away from beautiful Greenlake park, the co-op, coffee shops, pubs, and restaurants. The location is well positioned for quick access to Seattle and surrounding neighborhoods. I use Airbnb to put up family visiting me here in Seattle and I will definitely be looking to use this space again. Thanks Jil!"
3821822,49960134,2015-10-07,20027008,Erik,"This apartment was exactly what we needed to relax in a very enjoyable Seattle neighborhood. The hosts were very quick at responding to our requests and provided everything we needed to feel at home. We were able to easily cook, do laundry, and relax. This basement apartment is really neat and the location was easy! Green Lake neighborhood is really nice with great coffee shops, a bookstore, and ice cream. The lake is easily accessible from the apartment too.

We loved staying here and very much appreciated our hosts, who were able to accommodate our needs while providing privacy as well."
3821822,50291940,2015-10-11,10699708,Liz,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Jil's apartment last weekend for a wedding and we could not have been happier with the space. The apartment is exactly a described and has everything you could need for a weekend away. Jil and Curtis were very available to us for questions we had, but otherwise gave us lots of space. Check in and check out was unbelievably easy and user friendly. I highly recommend staying in this lovely apartment. "
3821822,50793757,2015-10-14,3903741,Ariel,"I enjoyed my stay, the place was very sweet and comfortable, spacious too. Even though it is a basement apartment, it is the nicest I have seen, and there's a light quality to the interior design. It was quiet, and clean. The bed was comfortable. My host was very responsive and pleasant. I walked to greenlake from there, that was a nice bonus. Great spot!"
3821822,51447610,2015-10-20,42943872,Linda,"Great place! The apartment met all of our needs, close to public transportation, private and comfortable.  My daughter and I spent most of our time getting to know Seattle and loved coming ""home"" after a long day of exploring. We didn't have much interaction with Jil, but then we didn't need to, she had provided us with all the information we needed before our arrival.  This was our 1st experience with Airbnb and would recommend/stay Jil's place  again."
3821822,51866481,2015-10-24,33132879,Martusha,"The apartment was just as the pictures looked- cute, cozy and I loved all the midcentury modern furniture!  It was perfect for us and with a toddler, I loved that there weren't lots of knick-knacks for her to get into!  Location was amazing- central to everything we needed!  The bed was VERY comfortable!  Loved staying here!"
3821822,53060381,2015-11-04,1125430,Jill,"Comfy and homey, from the layout to the decor!
The host put their hospitality to every details: bed linens, fresh premium coffee, tableware, even bedside reading. 
All made us feel like living in a tasteful, thoughtful friend's house!
We will definitely return with our next trip to Seattle"
3821822,54028085,2015-11-15,18938196,Mark,We really enjoyed our stay at Jil's apartment.  It was nicely appointed and very clean.  Has a very comfortable bed and in a quiet location.  
3821822,54987590,2015-11-27,45485350,Mary,"We had a wonderful time staying in the Sweet and Cozy Apartment. Jil and Curtis were so friendly, welcoming and helpful. The apartment was very comfortable and met our needs well. The location was great. We loved that it was so convenient to walk to Green Lake, as well as to restaurants and shops. It was a very positive experience."

3821822,55666084,2015-12-04,746146,Keaton,it was a lovely stay! such a great place tucked away in Greenlake!
3821822,55839842,2015-12-06,49664261,Michelle,Jil was super sweet. I had a great time staying at her place. She was really accommodating to me and my friend. I would definitely recommend staying here.
3821822,56601519,2015-12-15,19877518,Mark,"The apartment was precisely what my family needed for our visit to the Green Lake area of Seattle.  Clean, comfortable and with all amenities one would need.  The ambiance of it led to a very relaxing feeling when we were there.  The kitchen was well stocked with appliances and utensils, the choices of tea and some milk for the kids was also a nice touch.  The hosts were easy to contact, very responsive yet did not feel like they were right on top of you either.  They even sent me a text with a detailed map of how to park in the back where there was more space once I got into town.  We will likely stay there again when we visit relatives nearby the next time.  I also recommended it to other family members that may visit the area too."
3821822,57171896,2015-12-22,36278563,思璇,"Jil's place is so great! Her house is so decorated and so pretty that I wanna decorate my house like that! She put gray spots in front of the gate to guid you there! Her garden is so lovely and so artistic! Also, Jil is so nice that she put some travelers guide books in the drawer! "
2303981,15257353,2014-07-06,14088863,Michelle,We had such a great time at this house! It could not have been more perfect. There was plenty of room for all six adults and one baby. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook. I would give this house a better then perfect review.
2303981,15616872,2014-07-13,12512817,Richard,"We had a wonderful stay at Kim and Steve’s house.  Overall we give it a very positive recommendation and we thank them for their hospitality.  The 3 bedrooms worked very well for us.  The apartment is comfortable and very well equipped.  The washer and dryer were a big plus!  Arriving hungry and tired, it was very nice that they had provided some starter foods (coffee, yogurts, Coke and beer).  The location is perfect for those who want to explore the woods and beach of Carkeek Park.  Keep in mind that the trails through the woods to the beach are hilly, not flat.  
 
Seattle can be rather hilly, so we found that a car was pretty necessary.  The taxi ride from the airport cost us $72, but we think we could have used the Seatac van for more like $50.  

If you walk or bike one way from their house there is quite a steep hill.  There is shopping within biking distance the other direction and not such a bad hill that way.  The nearby bus was a farther walk than we liked, so we did end up renting a car.  Once we had the car, we enjoyed the area and Seattle very much.
"
2303981,16883093,2014-08-04,12669930,Jason,"Kim and Steve are very kind and warm people.  The home is just as described and a wonderful place to say. It is perfect for a family of 6. The location is fantastic for easy access to downtown Seattle, yet you don't feel like you are in the city.  Parks are close, accessible, and wonderful."

4163851,20535058,2014-09-30,747837,Meghan,"Just had a great stay at Amy's home in Seattle. Location was very convenient to  I-5 and West Seattle. Amy also has all the low down on the backroads to avoid traffic which was a huge help while we were there. Her home is very close (walking distance) to Georgetown which is full of great places to eat and drink. Go to Smarty Pants and get the Troublemaker sandwich. So good! 

Amy's home is clean and comfortable and she's a very gracious host! Thank you for opening your place up. We'll be staying there again!"
4163851,20718392,2014-10-04,4268020,Matthew,Amy was a very welcoming host. She made her entire house available to us. Very clean. Easy access to highway. Would stay again for sure. One of the best Airbnb places I have stayed at.
4163851,21353794,2014-10-15,10591421,Dora Chi,"We enjoyed our stay at Amy's place. It's well organized and charmingly decorated. The location is good as well, only 15minutes from downtown and 15minutes from Tacoma airport. We would recommend this place!"
4163851,21623959,2014-10-20,22257018,Tina,"Amy was a great host.  Her place was very clean and she had great attention to detail.  She had coffee brewing when we met her as she gave the tour of her home and she left many snacks for us to enjoy.  She had maps left out for us of Seattle which was handy.  The location was actually quite convenient allowing us to get to the airport in about 15 minutes.  Also definitely check out all city coffee, it really was amazing coffee two minutes away."
4163851,25361315,2015-01-13,23039495,Amanda,"Staying with Amy was really awesome and I totally recommend her place. She was more than accommodating and most certainly went above and beyond. Her place was cute, clean and just as described. She had tons of yummy snacks waiting for us and even helped me out when I locked myself out (Ooops!) I used Uber a lot to get to and from downtown Seattle and it was super convenient . I would definitely stay with her again!"
4163851,26657035,2015-02-16,7487147,Colleen,"Everything about Amy and her home is beautiful! 

Amy is so generous, considerate, and flexible.  She had yummy snacks for us upon arrive. She even allowed us to dig thru her pantry. She allowed us to stay past check out time with no fuss or guidelines, just a simple ""Sure. Text me when you leave"". Checking in was a breeze. Although I made the reservation, she allowed my partner to retrieve the keys. She even gave him a tour of the house to make sure he knew where everything was placed. 

The house is comfortable and homey! Onsite, private parking was a huge plus. The master bedroom on the 3rd floor is warm and gets plenty of sunlight during the day. The kitchen is stocked with pots/pans/cups/plates/utensils.  The washer and dryer is convenient since we were there for almost a week. I don't know what to say...anything you need to feel at home, Amy will have it or she'll be happy  (and generous) to provide it before you arrive.  

We had a car and was able to get to University District,  International District, Downtown, airport, waterfront in about 20mins. Quiet neighborhood and neighbors. Close to highways=super convenient. 

Highly recommend it to anybody and everybody visiting Seattle! Thank you Amy! "
4163851,26922637,2015-02-22,24429508,Wilson,"Amy's condo was equivalent to a 5-star hotel! The place is gorgeous and has a lot of convenient amenities (washer, dryer, 2.5 bathrooms, free parking, and plenty of tea!).

Amy was very welcoming and hospitable. Upon our arrival, she greeted us with tea and food. She even allowed an extremely late check-out (6 PM vs. the usual 12 PM). 5/5 would definitely stay @ Amy's place again!"
4163851,33644363,2015-05-31,24464339,Lihi,"If you ever have the chance to stay at Amy's - take it!! The house was comfortable and homey, and she as a host made the entire stay easy and enjoyable. I was welcomed with treats and a helpful tour and she stayed in touch throughout whenever I had a question. I have stayed in many airbnbs and this one wins the prize!!"
4163851,34187099,2015-06-06,24588663,Karli,"Amy's town home was a lovely place to come back to at the end of our busy day. We felt so much at home and Amy did a fantastic job welcoming us! Though lots of traffic noise is noted in the review, we were not bothered by this a bit. If you're a light sleeper though, it may.

Overall, we had a wonderful experience and enjoyed getting to see this part of Seattle!"
4163851,35378275,2015-06-18,31217051,Ryan,"The house is really pretty inside , and has a beautiful garage attach to it. But the environment near the house aren't so good , near a high way ,hard to fail asleep at night "
4163851,35796420,2015-06-22,31996359,Erika,My parents stayed at Amy's condo when they came out for my wedding.  They loved the condo and had everything they could possibly need. Thank you for the hospitality!!
4163851,36553183,2015-06-29,22644827,Janet,"
Amy is an amazingly gracious and generous host. Her place is pretty and conveniently located and very, very comfortable and well appointed.  Unfortunately, we lucked into an unusual heatwave for Seattle (90's) so AC would have been great--her apt without it is quite stifling--no airflow at all, even with fans that she provided. Also, do beware of the traffic noise.  The apt is right next to Rt 5 . Fine for New Yorkers, and she does provide bedside earplugs, but...

All in all, we were fine but you should know these things."
4163851,38108773,2015-07-13,1753607,Ben,"Amy's home is great! We were in town for 4 weeks with work and her townhome served us very well! Easy check-in, she had some fruit and drinks ready for our arrival. It was very clean and the decor is aesthetically appealing. Be advised there is no air conditioning, but that seems like a standard thing in Seattle. It is close to the freeway, great restaurants and coffee shops. I would highly recommend staying here!"
4163851,40933985,2015-08-03,1753607,Ben,I loved staying here! Amy is one of the nicest hosts I've ever rented from. She is accommodating and so sweet. I highly recommend staying here. Great bargain for an expensive city too. Make sure you have a car if you're trying to go downtown often. 
4163851,42120095,2015-08-11,2709149,Jennifer,"Three of us stayed at this comfortable, well appointed townhouse in Seattle's Georgetown district.  Amy, the host, was there to meet us at check-in, giving us a tour, and also telling us her favorite Georgetown spots.  The townhouse is adjacent to the  freeway making for easy transportation to the airport and greater Seattle area.   We got around easily with Uber and no car.  Georgetown has an industrial edge, a great little neighborhood with casual restaurants, bars, and coffeeshops."
4163851,43022782,2015-08-17,25518195,Erika,"Beautiful town-home literally 1 min (driving distance) from the Georgetown Ballroom where our friend was getting married.  Spacious and well-layed out.  Bedrooms were comfortable and master had enough closet space for my husband and I, plus our baby- which was awesome!  Neighborhood was quiet, and central to highway/many locations.  Also garage was a plus we didn't expect!"
4163851,44293736,2015-08-25,17122652,Bryan,"Amy met us when we arrived, and gave us a quick tour of the place. She was so welcoming!! She even had yummy treats for us- which were great after a long day of travel! The townhouse was just as described and made a great base camp for our Seattle excursion. Having the kitchen was extremely helpful and saved $$$!
We enjoyed our 5 night stay and totally recommend Amy's place!"
4163851,45376909,2015-09-02,36415329,Lynley,"Amy was very friendly and welcoming, and the townhouse was just as described and pictured. Very comfortable for our five-day stay - we particularly liked the kitchen and living area, and there were lots of interesting books on the shelves. For us, as first-time visitors to the U.S. and Seattle, we found the neighbourhood quite intimidating at first - given its industrial background and proximity to railyards. We used the 124 bus to travel to Downtown Seattle (20mins) and to the Museum of Flight (8mins South) - $2.50. The bus was fine but this location is better suited for people with their own cars. "
4163851,53532112,2015-11-09,2342424,Carol,This is a great place to stay. Very handy location to everywhere we wanted to go. The neighborhood felt very safe and we were able to do our daily walks without problem. We just really enjoyed staying here and would certainly come again.
5078876,48797243,2015-09-28,42626506,Jessica,"Our hosts made us feel incredible welcomed from the moment we booked!  They checked in with us before and during our stay to make sure all of our questions were answered.  

The home is beautiful and quiet but also so close to Broadway! "
5078876,49661601,2015-10-05,29521843,Hope,"We very much enjoyed our stay at Craig's lovely townhouse. The place was very clean, cozy and comfortable and it is in a wonderful location. The host's made themselves very available if we needed anything. Would absolutely stay here again. "
5078876,49947209,2015-10-07,26805994,Cheryl,"We had a wonderful weekend staying in Craig's condo. It's very nice, immaculate and comfortable and in a convenient location. Craig is a good communicator and he wanted to make sure we had everything we needed. We would definitely choose to stay there again!"
5078876,50659553,2015-10-13,43201206,Melissa,"Craig's townhouse was great! The location was convenient and we found great places to eat, get a drink, and even karaoke within a 15-minute walk. It was also easy to hop on a bus to and from downtown Seattle with this location. We appreciated the water bottles and the list of recommended restaurants and bars! Rob & Ruby were really helpful and quick to respond. We especially loved the fact that they left a light on for us, knowing that we were arriving late at night. We would definitely stay there again the next time we visit Seattle!"
5078876,51568380,2015-10-21,45873191,Kevin,"The place was very modern, and clean. The description was very accurate. The location is only a couple of blocks from Broadway, where you will find coffee shops, restaurants, a grocery store, and a drug store.  The only potential downside we could see is that it has a lot of stairs (living area is one floor up from street level, and bedrooms are a floor above that).

We used a car or walked to get around, and there was a garage to park your car. They also had a visitor parking pass, but it's perhaps noteworthy that a car was stolen one block away so you would be better off to park in the garage unless you have insurance. The garage itself isn't very big, but we had a Toyota Prius C which fit fine (a camry would be very tight, and forget about a big SUV). There is pretty good bus transportation in Seattle so you might not want a car.

The host was very responsive, in spite of being out of town. He had a local couple who are helping out for fast responses. 

Would we stay there again? Absolutely!
"
5078876,52527590,2015-10-30,352413,John,"Great condo close to restaurants and shops, with thoughtful attention to details. Very clean and comfortable. Craig is extremely responsive and helpful.

Will definitely stay here again!"

5078876,53519492,2015-11-09,6898294,Lily,"Craig was very responsive and texted frequently welcoming us to Seattle and making himself available if we needed anything.  The location was central and the apartment was big and clean.  The check-in and check-out was seamless and ultra convenient.  The views from the master bedroom had a darling view of the neighborhood with its cute houses and trees with beautiful changing leaves.  The apartment was well-equipped with everything you might need to enjoy your stay.  Thank you, Craig, for the wonderful stay!"
5078876,54139621,2015-11-16,2591909,Ken,"Craig's place was very conveniently located, clean, and beautiful. We did not see our hosts while we were there, but it was very smooth."
5078876,55237419,2015-11-29,47829627,Kartik,"This was my first Airbnb experience. I was very happy with it. The house, the location, and the owner (Craig, and Rob and Ruby) were very professional, and maintain the house beautifully. I'd recommend this to others, especially those with kids wanting to stay in the Capitol Hill neighborhood (which is great too, btw)."
5078876,57250560,2015-12-23,3553236,Matthew,Another fantastic Airbnb experience. Craig's place is immaculate and in a wonderful location. Both my colleague and I were very comfortable staying here. Check in was super easy and the info Craig left us was helpful in helping us get to know the neighborhood. I'd highly recommend staying here if you're making a trip to Seattle. 
5078876,57927300,2015-12-30,24068512,Stephanie,"Absolutely wonderful stay at Greg, Ruby and Rob's place. Everything was as described and kept very clean. There was a very friendly manual on the kitchen counter and my whole family felt at home during the whole stay. There were times when it was rainy and we were perfectly content just staying in because the house was so cozy! I would recommend without hesitance to anyone who is planning on visiting Seattle. "
5078876,58437754,2016-01-02,8139702,Michael,"The apartment is perfect located on Capitol Hill. It's just a quick easy walk to Broadway and even downtown. When we arrived the apartment was perfectly clean and ready for all four of us to stay comfortably. One of the best features was the garage, parking on Capitol Hill can be very difficult and it saved us so much time and headache. I would highly recommend this apartment and would stay here again any time I visit Seattle. "

There is plenty of water bottles in the fridge & candy/snacks, I was thankful for that :) Communication was great, Larry responded quickly to any questions or help I needed. He was also nice enough to let me check in early and leave late. Everything is as described and went smooth, Thank you so much Larry. I would stay here anytime and would recommend this listing to anyone.!  "
6438013,57610837,2015-12-27,52121518,Jene,"Larry was great to deal with for this property! So glad we decided to stay at the loft and will recommend to friends and family. The loft was just as pictured, king size bed, small but completwly functional kitchen, 3/4 bath, and work/office area in room. On site amenities were nice too, not that we used them much due to weather and 1 night stay. Nice location with walking distance to Whole Foods, a Wells Fargo bank, and just across the street from a distillery and sampling room. The location made it an easy drive to enjoy downtown and the Seattle center while not staying in a typical touristy area of town. Plus the building we were in was quiet so it made things that much more enjoyable. 
In short, we enjoyed our stay and look forward to making another reservation when we travel to Seattle again. Thanks Larry!"
6438013,58215149,2016-01-01,50872050,Ashly,Larry was great! Very helpful and friendly. Our stay was great. The location was perfect close to everything and the building felt secure and comfortable. Highly recommended 
1796861,16351324,2014-07-26,8537839,Josh & Joanne,"We loved staying at this house.  From my initial inquiry to my last minute questions at check out, Brooke was very quick to respond to anything we asked about.

The house itself had all the amenities of a nice hotel and more.  The location felt residential but with a few nearby shops and restaurants we were never felt too isolated.  Being 1 block away from the bus line would seem noisy but the house was peaceful and quite every night."

The instant booking worked perfectly, the address description and entry instructions were perfect and the key less entry system really made life easy. I really like not having to arrange a time to meet by using the key less entry so you do not have to constantly have to watch the clock. The house layout was great for a family or even multiple couples and children, it was clean, beautify furnished and well appointed. The house is set up perfectly for holiday rental with everything you could possibly want. I would definitely recommend this and would have to say it was by far my BEST airbnb experience!!!! "

The locating gave us the prefect access to downtown and the interstate.  The local shops were great and lulu cafe coffee cannot be beat.  Being this was our first time using the service, we couldn't have gotten this experience at a better deal. 

Our host was gracious, courteous, attentive to our needs.   I can saw that we never went without.  

The green lake getaway is easily a recommendation for anyone looking in the Seattle area.   Thank you brooke for the great house."

The home was as described in the listing, and was absolutely beautiful.  We were a party of 5 and utilized all 3 bedrooms. I slept in the master bedroom and found the bed very comfortable.

The living room and kitchen were very tastefully decorated and comfortable.  It was nice having a tv with many channels available.  We also enjoyed the deck and porch.  The home really felt like a home.

The neighborhood is quite nice.  There are many restaurants within a 10 to 15 minute walk.  Also a park with lake view.  We found an excellent Thai restaurant and also a supermarket.  Nice touch was that Brooke left a neighborhood guide with suggestions.

All in all we were extremely satisfied with this rental and would definitely stay again!!"

Very well stocked, immaculate, well designed and decorated, great location with coffee, food, antiques and bus routes a block away. Even comfy beds and pillows. And the owners were super attentive and fast to respond to questions when we had them, checked in on us (by text) to make sure all was well. Friends in Seattle who airbnb all the time came to visit one night and said they had never seen a better airbnb house. Five stars! "
1796861,45339788,2015-09-01,42516270,Brad,"We had a very nice stay.  The house is very nice inside.  It has been renovated recently with a nice well appointed kitchen, hardwood floors and three nice size bedrooms and full bath upstairs.  The location is great.  Reasonable walk to Green Lake and a shopping area as well as close to I-5.  A bus route that goes into downtown also runs by the house regularly if you prefer public transportation.  This house is a great way to get a taste of the urban Seattle lifestyle.  Thanks for the great stay!"

The house was in great order, with everything we needed for a great Thanksgiving feast. The location is awesome - a pub and a cafe on the corner, a park and playground for our 3 yr old grand daughter just down the street, a zoo just a few miles away that we visited on Saturday, a Whole Foods for all of the special extras you need for a true feast. "
6674408,34593982,2015-06-09,31818565,Cameron,"I stayed with a handful of AirBnB hosts on my recent trip to Seattle, and the quality of the apartments and hosts definitely varied. Jon was far and away the best host. The whole experience was incredible!  

His place is immaculately clean, comfortable, and has basically all the amenities you could ask for. Beautiful kitchen and dining room, 4k TV with Apple TV and ps4 and Wii, in-unit laundry, and the room I used had a big iMac with guest access if you need to work or browse the Internet. 

The neighborhood is nice and very centrally located - just outside of Capital Hill, walking distance to Madison Park, and there's a huge Safeway grocery store two blocks from his house. 

Jon is awesome and extremely accommodating and friendly but will also give you a ton of space when you need to do work or if you don't feel like being social. 

Seriously, this is the gold standard, folks. Don't think twice about booking time to stay at Jon's place. "
6674408,35153226,2015-06-15,34940688,Regina,"Jon was the best host imaginable! He was so helpful, knowledgable, and extremely gracious. His home is BEAUTIFUL, every square inch of it. From the incredible entertainment system to the most comfortable bed ever, we can't wait to spend more time there! We consider Jon a friend now and feel lucky to have met him this way. What a perfect first time air bnb experience for us. Than you Jon!"
6674408,35844459,2015-06-22,34946039,Sierra,"Jon was my first Airbnb host and the experience was amazing. He has a beautiful home and a super comfy bed for guests! Jon is a very nice guy and has a lot of knowledge of the city. The location is also great, very close to a ton of bus stops and the Washington Park Arboretum (perfect for running). Any time I had a question he was always very quick to respond. Thanks for the amazing stay! "
6674408,36214827,2015-06-26,24940512,Nikita,"This was my first airbnb experience and Jon was a great host. We talked briefly the night I arrived and he was very helpful and friendly, but also respectful of personal space. I felt comfortable and very much at home during my stay. The house is beautiful and very clean. Getting downtown by bus was easy and it was nice to be so close to a grocery store (Safeway). Also, the bed I slept in was sooooo comfortable! I would definitely stay here again if I had the opportunity."
6674408,36353080,2015-06-27,16550241,(email hidden),Jon's contemporary urban guest bedroom was comfortable and clean and his home was modern and well cared for with a well stocked kitchen that he easily made available to guests.  Great location. 
6674408,36573060,2015-06-29,35027230,Kristofer,"Super clean and modern. Great location and John was the perfect host. Would use again!
"
6674408,37198241,2015-07-05,28521200,Caroline,"My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay. Jon's place is very nice and clean, and it was a good home base from which we could walk to Capitol Hill and downtown."
6674408,39395834,2015-07-23,33438264,Matthew,"Jon has a lovely home, which is very clean and tidy, and is a very welcoming host. Along with that, he has a lot of knowledge of the area and recommended a few great places that were definitely worth a visit. I would definitely stay there again if I was to visit Seattle in future!"
6674408,39684718,2015-07-25,38473445,Kelly,"My best friend and I had an excellent one night stay with Jon in his gorgeous Seattle home. It was close enough to walk everywhere, from great restaurants to fun bars in Capital Hill. The neighborhood is very safe and easy to get around. Jon gave us space to relax, but was very helpful with suggestions for places to go. We had a wonderful stay, and hope to be back sometime again! "
6674408,40335246,2015-07-30,35512908,Mariah,"Our stay at Jon's home in Seattle could not have been better. The entire arrangement was comfortable: the bed, the other guests, the freedom to come and go, the friendly conversation (and privacy) and even though Jon was not home when we arrived, there was another friendly man there to greet us. The coffee table was stocked with books of things to see or do in Seattle, which was extremely helpful for a tourist. It was a great experience for our first Airbnb arrangement!"
6674408,40500835,2015-07-31,38511708,Spencer,"Jon was extremely accommodating! We needed to drop our bags off early and pick them up later and he was really helpful in that regard! The bed was big and comfy, there were body pillows which were awesome, some travel information on how to get around town, and  some sweets. Jon is a very gracious host! I highly recommend!!! Thanks for a great stay!!!"
6674408,41627983,2015-08-08,2447938,Sabrina,Jon was the best airbnb we've ever stayed at! It was super clean and welcoming. The hospitality was everything we could ask for. If I'm ever in Seattle again I wouldn't stay any where else.
6674408,41951607,2015-08-10,34601243,Morgan,"This is my first time use Airbnb and I have to say the experience is really impressive, the house is well maintained and Jon is really friendly. The house is close to Seattle downtown so travel is really easy. I would definitely recommend to stay with Jon and will consider come back again if I have a chance in the future."
6674408,43376310,2015-08-19,16904160,Kristen,"I can't say enough good things about my experience. Jon is an extremely welcoming and kind host. The house is beautiful and very clean, and the location is excellent. My boyfriend and I had a wonderful time, and will definitely stay at Jon's house again for our next Seattle visit. "
6674408,43691744,2015-08-21,895477,Emiko,Very clean and comfortable! Jon is a terrific host and had great ideas for exploring Seattle. 
6674408,44296524,2015-08-25,35710212,Cassie,"This residence is beautiful and exactly as described. There is lots of space, and Jon is willing to share so much with you, like his television, movies, game system, wine/liquor, kitchen supplies, and food. My husband and I felt very welcome and comfortable. We even played cards one evening with Jon and another couple who was staying at this residence. The neighborhood is clean and felt safe. We were able to walk to most things, like Pike's Market, the Space Needle, and restaurants/bars/shops. If I ever go back to Seattle again, I would stay here!"
6674408,44587703,2015-08-27,41423416,Shirley,"Jon's house is so convenient that you can have everything you need. Jon is a really helpful and nice and warm host. I asked him how to go to downtown, and he used his printer to print a route for me. And he was glad to help us with anything! I really appreciate this hosted experience."
6674408,44931364,2015-08-30,38607320,Rachelle,"Jon was such a welcoming host. I had the chance to meet him the day arrived. The neighborhood was nice, VERY convenient to different bus stops, and close to area attractions. I've never been to Seattle, but Jon was able to give me a listing ahead of time of all the attractions Seattle had to offer. When I walked into my clean room, there was a clean folded towel and hand towel with a toothbrush, toothpaste, and soap. Just like on a cruise ship or hotel. Yes, I want to come back and stay here again. "
6674408,45340751,2015-09-01,36231518,Bruce,I was like we were a guest at a friends house -  
6674408,45386251,2015-09-02,37940434,Esdras,"Everything was super clean and easy to use. The decoration was amazing and the shower was really great. Also the location is quite good and was easy for me to move to the next Airbnb.

"
6674408,45707273,2015-09-05,39868854,Clint,"Jon was an awesome host. He has a great set-up, in a good Seattle neighborhood. He recommended some great restaurants and was super friendly. Parking was not a problem, when we followed Jon's suggestions. Very happy with our experience."
6674408,45946369,2015-09-07,36958151,Alena,"Jon was a wonderful host with a beautiful home. The location was stellar, as was the bed! We would absolutely stay here again."
6674408,47983135,2015-09-22,20401,Jennifer,"Amazing location, beautiful house, as described. The experience very much depends on the guests you share the house with. Nice to have breakfast. Overall - great!"
6674408,49140668,2015-10-01,43218843,Emily,Jon was such a welcoming and gracious host. He went above and beyond to make my experience the best it could possibly be. My first day (and my first time in Seattle) he went over a map with me to show me the area and gave me numerous really helpful suggestions on places to eat and activities around the city to enjoy. The house was clean and nicely maintained. I was given access to all its amenities and made to feel very much at home. I stayed in the guest room and the bed and pillows were like sleeping on a cloud! I would highly recommend anyone looking for a comfortable get away to do themselves a favor and book with Jon. You will not regret it.
6674408,49669534,2015-10-05,36044259,Sierra,"My husband and I visited Seattle for a friend's wedding and really enjoyed our stay at Jon's place! The area is beautiful and convenient for public transportation - his visitor's guide suggests some delicious restaurants within walking distance! They kindly offered wine, snacks, and free use of their huge TV - it was just lovely!"
6674408,50042791,2015-10-08,20885910,Heike,"We enjoyed our stay in Seattle very much, especially thanks to Jon and also David. Their enthusiasm in hosting us feels very welcoming. And also the useful hints we got were very good for exploring Seattle. We would recommend anyone to stay with Jon."
6674408,50452470,2015-10-12,10510006,Lauren,"Jon went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed/may have forgotten such as towels, toiletries, etc. His home was very nice, clean and most importantly, safe. The location is ideal, within walking distance to all the restaurants, coffee shops and bars on Capitol Hill. My husband and I actually walked from the Waterfront downtown back to Jon's home at one point.  If you have a car there is ample parking on the side streets near the condo. Jon is very friendly and happy to help his guests with any and all inquiries. We really enjoyed our visit to Seattle and thank Jon for adding to the positive experience! "
6674408,51074689,2015-10-17,846767,Jessica,"Jon was an excellent host with a wealth of knowledge about Seattle (and surrounding areas too). He was happy to answer my questions and also give me privacy. I had great conversation with him and a friend of his as well. The room itself is lovely, clean and serene. The bed was dreamily comfy - I was in danger of missing out on Seattle in favor of sleeping in!Do note that the room is located across the hall from another Airbnb room, so there may be up to 4-5 people in the house at a time and you will be sharing a bathroom with the other renter (however not with Jon). This was not an issue for me, and I also had a nice talk with the couple who rented the other room. The last two nights of my stay, the room was empty. Jon also went above and beyond by providing several toiletries during my stay.

Since it was my first time in Seattle, I was hesitant about the parking/driving/location situation, so I'll comment on that for others wondering the same. My first night, I found nearby parking on a side street and left my car there for 4 days with no issue. Jon's place shares a pull-in carport so I was able to unload and load my luggage there before parking, which helped a lot. The house seems to be in an up-and-coming neighborhood, which has its ups and downs. I wasn't sure if it was safe to walk at night alone, so I stuck with Uber after dark (never more than $5-10). I'm a single female traveler with little-to-no knowledge of Seattle, so that may be why. As for downtown/Pike Place Market, it was a fairly easy walk of about 45 minutes and that worked great for me in the mornings because it gave me a chance to see the city. I found it affordable to Uber anywhere I didn't feel like walking and I could've driven my car too if I were more comfortable with city parking. There are things to do in the Central District neighborhood I think, but I mostly ventured outside of it. Capitol Hill is a popular neighborhood nearby too.

I think Jon's place is best for travelers open to getting to know their housemates but who also want a quiet place to rest in the evenings. And for those who are adventurous and willing to do some walking/exploring. I'd stay again if he'd have me!"
6674408,51435841,2015-10-20,40868297,Lynette,"I had a great time at Jon's place! This was my very first time staying at an Air B&B. I stayed in the guest bedroom and one of my favorite parts was the bed. I felt like I was sleeping on clouds! I appreciated the ability to have my own AC unit in the room to adjust the temperature how I wanted. Jon has also provided toiletries for his guests to use just in case you need them. Everything is neatly labeled including items/cabinets/drawers in the kitchen. The front door has a code for entry so I didn't have to worry about keys. The only suggestion I have is a personal one. It would be nice to have the refrigerator stocked with a few more options for breakfast. Other than that, my stay was perfect. I would highly recommend Jon, as a great host, and his place to anyone! He set the bar pretty high!"
6674408,51682058,2015-10-22,4970301,Patti,"Jon was a wonderful host! His home is cozy & clean and the bed in the guest room very comfortable. We had the opportunity to interact with the couple in the master bedroom, they even offered us dinner!  Later that evening we got to meet Jon and his partner who were both warm and friendly.  We found the location to be perfect for our needs and the value exceptional for the area. Usually it is just my husband that travels to Seattle and he said he would stay there again and so would I."
6674408,52364723,2015-10-28,46901999,Krishna,Jon has been a fantastic host and kept everything ready before our arrival making it as smooth as possible. We did not have any difficulty finding the apartment or getting into our accommodation considering this our very first airbnb usage. We honestly felt home at Jon's place. Definitely recommend it to others considering the location and a fantastic experience at Jon's place.
6674408,52632983,2015-10-31,5406875,Sally,"Incredibly comfy bed in a nice place and area easy walking distance from downtown Seattle - perfect for my needs. I arrived tired and a shower and the beer Jon provided refreshed me for a night out! Good restaurants and pubs within walking distance. I spent an hour or two in Elliot Bay Book Company and Pike Place Market - Seattle is great and I'll look forward to returning with my wife!

Met with Jon and David later that night - very friendly and accommodating."
6674408,52893380,2015-11-02,31556672,Aj,I had a wonderful stay. Everything was clean and neat. Would definitely recommend Jon's place to anyone who wants to stay in the Downtown Seattle area!
6674408,53349355,2015-11-08,45323530,Zachary,This house was amazing. Jon was very hospitable and welcoming. I had a great time wandering Seattle by day and playing card games with them by night.
6674408,53697517,2015-11-11,17790080,Wayne,Jon was very welcoming and offered good tips on sights to visit and nearby dining options. The room was good. The location was very good with the excellent public transportation system an easy walk down the street. Would highly recommend Jon's place.
6674408,54138113,2015-11-16,29714672,Elias,"Jon made me feel very welcome and the whole apartment was very comfortable. I'm generally a shy person but it was easy to talk to both hosts. It was a great experience especially since this was my first time using AirBnB. 
The neighborhood felt very safe to walk in at night and was close to the center of everything. Would definitely reccomend Jon to friends who would like to visit Seattle. "
6674408,54361599,2015-11-18,11333319,Morgan,Beautiful house. Love the fire place. Very nice people. 
6674408,54554482,2015-11-21,24634874,Bhargav,"Very accommodating, beautiful house and comfortable room. Also in a great location. "
6674408,54815746,2015-11-23,31730512,Nick,"We had a great stay in Seattle at Jons apartment. Jon was very professional and a great host. The apartment was awesome and in an unbeatable location, right in the heart of the action in Seattle. Jon was also very gracious in sharing amenities  and making us feel like we were at home"
6674408,55411994,2015-12-01,1334300,Kim,"Jon's place was fabulous.  My 15 year old and I game up to see the Steelers lose to the Seahawks.  We arrived on Friday.  Jon was having a party, and we were welcomed and fed and included in all the merriment.  I would strongly encourage anyone or couple to stay with Jon.    He was very helpful in the beginning, when I flooded him with email upon email.  He was always quick to response and was always very friendly.  When we got there, again, he was in full party and didn't miss a beat.  Some of his guest even thought we were part of the his group, not just some random mom and her son, that is how welcoming he is.  My daughter goes to college over on Vancouver Island, I imagine Seattle will be a staple in my travels.  Jon's place will always be top of the list."
6674408,56013942,2015-12-07,25240708,Sapna,Jon was a wonderful host! Very friendly and his home is quite beautiful and very clean. Street parking nearby and walkable to a variety of stores/restaurants. Also in close proximity to other popular neighborhoods. Was only here for 1 evening but would definitely recommend!
6674408,56683543,2015-12-16,20956241,Patrick,"Jon was a welcoming host and made us feel right at home. The place was cozy and well decorated, which is an extra nice touch while we stayed there. It's located pretty close to downtown, and there are a bunch of good brunches around the area as well. "
6674408,57126732,2015-12-22,4267090,Ying Zhi,"Jon and David are wonderful host that are very generous with sharing their home with us. we had full access to the many board games and the wii while we were there. definitely made coming home a fun event. The house is very warm and welcoming though the wooden flooring did make sound travel rather easily in the house. Otherwise we had a lot of fun interacting with jon and David when they invited us to little gingerbread house making parties and other game nights. Because both rooms were rented out, we met quite a few other guest that came in and out while we were there. "
6674408,57343902,2015-12-24,51598308,Yuhan,It's a very great experience. We like the location very much. 
6674408,58302521,2016-01-02,46744691,Yajie,"Jon is super nice.The house is really clean and comfortable. It nears several bus stops, so we could easily go to anywhere. It's a good experience to live there."
4968752,26342573,2015-02-09,3789751,Marci,"The perfect location was pretty perfect! Green lake is a sweet neighborhood with restaurants, cafes and the lake nearby. Sarah was a great communicator, which was helpful since our arrival time was up-in-the-air. It's a great little downstairs apt. with plenty of light. Cozy comfy beds and couch, pillows, a turntable and records (!), a foam roller that I was thrilled to see, a great variety of tea and a big bowl of citrus fruit. Oh, and a piano! The only warning I would have is if you're wanting to sleep in past 9 am or so: footsteps upstairs are pretty well heard. Thank you Sarah and family!"
4968752,26711001,2015-02-17,27242173,Pam,"Everything about my stay at Sarah's home was absolutely perfect. I stayed here in a group of four, and Sarah made us all feel welcome by giving us a tour of the suite and telling us about the neighborhood. The suite is exactly as pictured, private downstairs suite with a comfortable living room, nice kitchen stocked with coffee and teas, one full bath and one half bath, and two spacious bedrooms. The location of the home is in a beautiful neighborhood in the Greenlake District of Seattle with charming houses and great places to dine and have coffee right around the corner. Overall, it was one of the most comfortable stays I've ever experienced while traveling. Should I visit Seattle again in the future, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. I would highly recommend this listing. "
4968752,27310169,2015-03-01,1374646,Jon,"Amazingly nice place!!!!
If you want a slice of home this is it. A 500 foot walk to food and other good places. And they had tea and other nice things to make it like a nice hotel!

So good!"
4968752,27678819,2015-03-09,23749006,Marissa,"We enjoyed our stay! Sarah was extremely accommodating with our strange arrival and departure hours. Unfortunately we had a quick, busy stay which didn't leave much time in Sarah's place but the location was great. We appreciated the large selection of teas and my niece and nephew loved the board games and snacks! We look forward to staying there on our next visit! "
4968752,28169997,2015-03-19,27642118,Shauna,"We absolutely loved our stay at this property. The owners were extremely hospitable. We've rented many places before and this one was by far the first that made me want to leave a review. They had all the necessities available and then some. We have a 3 year old son and they had plenty of toys, games and books. They also had BPA free dishes for him. There is a washer and dryer to use, which is always nice to have.  Great stay! Thank you guys! "
4968752,28403163,2015-03-23,831766,Abdul & Jana,"We stayed here for three nights and had a great time at Sarah's place. Staying here truly felt like home, the suite was clean, comfortable and quiet. We were provided with absolutely everything we could have ever needed. Checking in and out could not have been more easy and straight forward. There are some nice stores just a block away and it was great to explore a little bit of the area before heading out for the day. Loved the location, quiet and peaceful, yet close enough to downtown. If we ever visit Seattle again Sarah's place would be my 1st choice. Thanks for hosting us!"
4968752,28542937,2015-03-25,5054145,Kate,What a great place to stay in Green Lake! Sarah always responded very promptly to our messages. Each room in the home was very comfortable and decorated. The unit is located underneath the main house but still feels very private. So much better than staying at a hotel! 
4968752,28879157,2015-03-31,25911771,Rachael,Nice neighborhood.  Comfortable place.  Sarah was welcoming and responsive.  Great value for the cost.
4968752,29580463,2015-04-09,30293293,Randal,"This was my first time using airbnb and I must say I'm impressed. My experience was excellent. The process was simple and straight forward. And Sarah made it all go easy with quick responses and clear instructions. Sarah was a great host and just a pleasure to meet. We had no issues and even extended our stay without a hitch.
The apartment was wonderful, as advertised, with everything we needed - a bright private space in a beautiful Seattle neighborhood, especially beautiful in spring with everything in bloom. And the location is amazing - just right around the corner from breakfast, lunch, and dinner options (including a great little pub) and only blocks away from both beautiful Greenlake and the Roosevelt business district.
I will definitely be looking to use this space again in the future.
Thanks Sarah!"
4968752,30038848,2015-04-16,30131968,Elizabeth,"The description given was very accurate. Sarah was very helpful and left clear instructions about everything. She was available but unobtrusive. The house is very close to the lake, literally less than five minutes walk away. The neighborhood is very clean, safe and quiet. The houses and gardens all seem beautifully maintained. There are many cafes and restaurants, yoga studios, fitness centers and shops close by. 
The home / apartment has everything needed for a short stay. Sarah had thoughtfully provided some breakfast foods, a selection of tea bags, milk and various condiments in the fridge. There were towels and bathroom / shower supplies provided. There was a good selection of books and games too. The apartment was warm, even when it was cool and windy outside. "
4968752,31432410,2015-05-05,7020271,Joe,"Great neighborhood, awesome host. Our family had a great time here. "
4968752,32173361,2015-05-15,21066764,Rachel,"What a fantastic place! When we arrived after a 22 hour drive from Orange County,  CA we needed a nice place to rest our head and something to eat that wasn't deep fried. As if reading our mind,  Sarah provided some healthy and nourishing snacks and quiet, clean rooms. We stayed for seven days and we were all sad when it was time to leave. The neighborhood is quiet,  with beautiful walkable streets, yet central to everywhere in Seattle. Her space is simple and home-like, with a great selection of books and board games for times you just want to hang out. We can't wait to go again!"
4968752,32459888,2015-05-18,27927439,Katie,We had a delightful stay for the weekend while attending a wedding. Sarah allowed us to check in early as we had an afternoon of sightseeing scheduled & didn't want to take our luggage all over with us. She had everything set up & homey for us. Thanks Sarah!!
4968752,32811450,2015-05-22,28059546,Stephen,"What a great little spot! Sarah contacted us in advance to ask if we needed anything specific for our children. When we arrived the quaint apartment was stocked with light breakfast food and coffee, and had everything a parent could need from a pack and play and great toys to a potty seat and baby shampoo. The location is perfect, set in the kind of unique neighborhood you expect in Seattle, with Green Lake down the hill and thai food, a pub and other little shops just a couple of blocks away. "
4968752,34401568,2015-06-08,2298105,Corinna,"We had an amazing stay at Sarah's apartment.  My friend and I were there for over a week and Sarah and her family were amazingly welcoming and accommodating.  

The neighborhood is excellent, very close to green lake, around the block from several great eating establishments and a short walk to even more.  There are also a number of great grocery stores in the area.

We did some cooking while there and they happily loaned us some of the more obscure kitchen items we needed.

We did not know when we booked but this apartment has a half bath master suite (!) as well as an additional full bath. It also two bedrooms with a queen sized futon beds in each and a nice living room common and kitchen area.  It was spacious and bright and clean."
4968752,35067032,2015-06-15,28385693,Madonna,"Sarah was so responsive when I had to change my initial reservation, she guided me through the whole process. I also had to reach out to her when our flight was cancelled and we had to stay in Chicago. We arrived a day late but everything Sarah said was true about her home being the perfect location.  Every home in her neighborhood has its own unique charm.  A four block stroll to Green Lake was the perfect way to start the day with a walk or run.  We were in Seattle to attend my daughter's graduation from UW.  Sarah's house was no more than 10 min from campus and when we ventured further into the city, Sarah's house is about 5 minutes from Route 5, and an easy drive to downtown (15 minutes). 
Sarah stocked some breakfast items for us and we were so grateful. Her apartment is clean, spacious and comfortable and quiet. This was my first booking on airbnb and I'd recommend Sarah's apartment wholeheartedly."
4968752,35298810,2015-06-17,29402930,Joshua,What a wonderful place! Location and description were perfectly accurate. Sarah and her family were very welcoming. Our kids even spent some time playing together. Perfect stay for a family. Thanks again for a wonderful experience!
4968752,35912298,2015-06-23,29570180,Andrew,"The neighborhood is a great little place with some cool cafes and restaurants and easy walking access to Green Lake.  The airbnb experience was perfect. I slept like a baby in a very comfortable apartment.  I even appreciated the nice touches that the hosts left: snacks in the fridge, some local beer, oatmeal and coffee/tea in the kitchen, and spare toiletries in case I forgot anything! 10/10 stars!"
4968752,36662118,2015-06-30,26980334,Laura,great hosts - very welcoming. lovely neighbourhood. all as described. my son also especially liked playing with neighbourhood kids (and complimentary yoghurt and granola). also relatively cool considering unexpected heat. would definitely recommend
4968752,37297153,2015-07-06,4844303,Dongjing,"We stayed at Sarah's place and it was a great experience for us. Her place was on the lower floor, separated from their upper floor, and has its own fully functional kitchen, bathrooms. This is a perfect place. And Sarah was a very lovrly lady and she was very welcoming and respectful during our stay. Highly recommended!"
4968752,37735961,2015-07-10,6080726,Randy,"Sarah was a very welcoming host and we so enjoyed our stay with her!  She genuinely seemed to enjoy getting to know us and we chatted for quite a while both before and after our stay.  The basement apartment was lovely with 2 bedrooms and baths and perfect for our family and the Green Lake area has everything we needed (lovely lake with walking/biking trail, good restaurants, grocery, and close to Seattle center).  She even provided coffee, yogurt, and granola for our breakfast.  I also left a backpack there and she was so kind to keep it for me until we swung back through on our trip home.  Wonderful woman and wonderful place!"
4968752,38258660,2015-07-14,30175132,Megan,"We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. It was perfect for our group of 4 girls. Having two bathrooms to get ready in was prime! We enjoyed the yogurt, granola, coffee & tea that was provided. I wanted to pick up Cafe Lulu's from around the corner and bring it home with me! The neighborhood was to die for! It was a quick drive to all the things in Seattle we wanted to do (outlet malls, space needle, pioneer place, troll etc) Thank you thank you for such a remarkable stay. I look forward to booking with Sarah again in the future if I make the trip to Seattle again! (More than likely!)  Absolutely no complaints over here. If you're hesitant to book; don't be! "
4968752,41064431,2015-08-04,29626918,Cara,"Nice little basement suite in a fabulous location. Easy to walk to Green Lake and lots of restaurants, coffee shops and pubs nearby. Sarah was great and had lots of helpful info for us and lots of great boardgames for the kids."
4968752,41927371,2015-08-10,16833120,Debra," This lovely place was only enhanced by our fabulous, super-sympatico hosts.  They were so welcoming, warm, and forgiving of our senior citizen forgetfulness (enough said).  

The neighborhood is lovely and gives new meaning to Seattle's claim to 'walkable neighborhoods.' Our quarters were clean, neat, and stocked with breakfast goodies, great coffee, entertainment options, and games.  We had plenty of space to store our belongings. The linens were top quality and our sleeping rooms were like home. The fact that we could participate in Seattle's wonderful recycling program was an unexpected extra!  

I don't want to say too much more so that others can be surprised by the extra touches interspersed where you least expect them.  

We will definitely stay here again when we can make it back in Seattle.  Partly to visit friends, family and this lovely city, but partly to reconnect with our wonderful hosts.

4968752,44558547,2015-08-27,14046939,Emmanuelle,"Sarah is a great host ! We were a bit in the rush, because we only spent 2 days in Seattle, and Sarah explain to us quickly how did it work. She gave us all informations we need.
The flat was clean and cosy. Rooms are great, living room too.
This is easy to reach downtown Seattle by bus, and bus stop right next to the house ! Great after a lot of walking !
Sarah put in the bathroom some stuff we can use, and also some stuffs for breakfast !
I recommend this airbnb at 100%. Thanks again Sarah !"
4968752,45248270,2015-09-01,15932093,James,"Sarah met us out front and showed us the space, and left us some chocolate and tea to enjoy. We really liked the neighborhood and the chance to get away from the heat for a weekend. Very close to a lot of cool restaurants and cafes, and very close to a nice walk around Green Lake."
4968752,46118925,2015-09-08,1593093,Mike,"Host was very welcoming and had everything we'd expect and more. Great neighborhood and awesome restaurants we could just walk to.

Second bedroom was perfect for our kids to sleep in with it's own bathroom. Plus we had toys and bath stuff and everything we'd need for the kids. "
4968752,46575832,2015-09-12,26266756,Dylan,"This apartment was just what we needed. Close to public transportation, walking distance to a local pub and some great little restaurants. Sarah had the apartment stocked with the basics we would need such as yogurt, granola a plethora of teas, coffee and any toiletries we may need. It was clean and easy to find. Sarah also let us keep our luggage in her home until our flight left later in the evening."
4968752,47041929,2015-09-15,37189192,Joel,"I was really only looking for a decently comfortable place to crash at the end of long days touring Seattle. What I got was a clean, spacious, awesome place to stay in a great neighborhood. It was more than enough space for our family of three, and it seems like Sarah thinks of everything her guests might need in the way of toiletries, snacks, etc. I plan on staying here again when we come for our next visit.  Thanks!"
4968752,47961235,2015-09-22,8092724,Armen,"We had a fantastic time at this cozy apartment! It was a perfect fit for two adults plus two small children. We stayed for seven days. Sarah was super friendly and made us feel so welcome. Our three-year-old had a blast playing with the neighborhood children. While we were there we managed to sample quite a bit of the local flare and enjoyed it all. We had coffee at Cafe Lulu, Thai food at Krittika, shopped at PCC and Safeway and made daily treks around Greenlake. We had a full schedule during our visit, so at the end of the day we were glad to return to this clean, comfortable home away from home. It came stocked with all the essentials plus toys for the kids, board games, records, a piano, a mountain of books plus coffee, tea and some pantry essentials. We would definitely stay here again!"
4968752,48380905,2015-09-26,31281940,Shanshan,The house is lovely. And my host Sarah is funny and friendly. Everything is perfect. Even my aunt who can not speak a single English word said Sarah is so nice. we talk a lot with my poor English. A wonderful experience to being US at first time. 
4968752,48996942,2015-09-30,19629481,Sarah,"Seattle, the apartmentand Sarah were great.  She was very welcoming when we arrived and provided yogurt and coffee. We loved the location, right off the freeway and very walkable. The beds were comfy and the toys for my toddler were great."
4968752,49621825,2015-10-05,6424723,Nicole,"Sarah's apartment is in a terrific location - literally steps from coffee, a few good places to eat, and the lovely Green Lake. She was very welcoming and had provided some helpful staples like coffee, tea, yogurt, cereal and milk. The bedrooms were a good size and comfy, and the common area was just the right size for our group of three. The apartment has THE best stocked AirBnB bathroom of any I've ever seen, which came in handy when I needed a bandaid :). We'll definitely try to book with Sarah again on a future trip to Seattle."
4968752,50633973,2015-10-13,1669492,Steven,"Sarah's place was really perfect.  It has an awesome location near Green Lake, and she does a wonderful job making sure you have what you need.  Very highly recommended!"
4968752,51117032,2015-10-18,11040498,Estelle,"We had a wonderful time in Seattle, in Sarah's cozy appartment. It was really nice, as described on the pictures. Sarah is a great host, very welcoming. All was perfect. Thanks a lot for your help during our stay."
4968752,51620764,2015-10-22,43366345,Yvette,"Sarah was there to greet us when we arrived and to answer our questions. She was very helpful in directing us to the various grocery stores in the neigborhood (Whole Foods and PCC) and provided written descriptions of the nearby restaurants. We had 2 bedrooms, 1 1/2 baths, a kitchen and a living room. It was spacious and tastefully decorated. We tried both beds  as one of the mattresses is softer than the other but they were both comfortable depending on your preference. In the kitchen, Sarah provided yogurts, cereal, coffee and tea, orange juice and various condiments. The neighborhood is very quiet and made up mostly of young families. Sarah's house is 2 1/2 blocks from Green Lake and walking around the lake was such a joy! We even saw an eagle perched on a tree there! We also really appreciated being able to walk to nearby coffee shops and restaurants.  We stayed 4 nights at Sarah's place and wished we could have stayed longer. "
4968752,52238040,2015-10-27,14546781,Tazoe,"This was our first time using Airbnb and Sarah could not have been more wonderful! We had a bit of a frantic moment with a lost passport, but Sarah was right there to help us out. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there, the suite was cozy and very comfortable and the neighborhood was awesome, so many good places to eat right within walking distance. She also provided breakfast in the form of coffee, tea, and yummy granola and yogurt too.  We would definitely book with her again in a heartbeat, a far better experience than we could have ever hoped for. "
4968752,52870184,2015-11-02,37149366,Adriana,"My stay at Sarah's was perfect for my trip to Seattle with my boyfriend and niece. I loved that we had our own rooms with super comfortable beds to retire to each evening.

The neighborhood is amazing - close to everything! We went to Eastlake, downtown, Capital Hill, and the u-district throughout the weekend and it never took us more than 10-15 or so minutes to get anywhere (even during a busy Halloween weekend).

The apartment looks exactly like the photos and had everything we needed (coffee, snacks, tea, toiletries, etc.). Sarah is also a very friendly/thoughtful host and responds extremely quickly to any questions or if you need anything adjusted. We needed the heat turned down and she did it immediately. She makes herself available but also gives guests all the privacy they need, which was perfect for us!

I would definitely stay here again.

4968752,53473827,2015-11-09,760546,Maret,Thank you. We had a wonderful time. The yogurt was a wonderful touch for our littles.

4968752,53927942,2015-11-14,23164500,Greg,"Sarah greeted us on our arrival and introduced us to the space.  She had supplied us with everything we could possibly need for our brief stay, and the space was all we could ask for.  Quiet, comfortable, and well-equipped.  We'll stay again if possible!  Thanks, Sarah."
4968752,54538613,2015-11-21,26506338,Pk,"I very much enjoyed our stay at Sarah's home!!  Sarah's space easily accommodated my group of 4, and the space was clean, comfortable, and well appointed.  Some of the highlights included amazing snacks and teas, tons of amenities and toiletries, and a super cool record player!! There was also an air mattress available, which came in handy with our extra guests.  Sarah was waiting outside to check us into the property--no wait at all.  After a long trip, we very much appreciated this.  She also responded quickly to all of our questions.  In sum, this was an awesome AirBNB experience, and we highly recommend Sarah's home for your Seattle visit.  You won't regret it!"
4968752,55345580,2015-12-01,38603472,Lorna,Our family of 4 spent 5 days over the Thanksgiving holiday and met Sarah when we arrived and were greeted warmly.  Sarah was great about texting and answering my question before arrival about items available in the house.  The kitchen included a microwave oven and was stocked with dishes and very adequate for cooking our Thanksgiving dinner.  There was an abundance of bathroom linens and the addition half bath was a plus. The bedrooms were comfortable with closet space and other storage.  This property is in a nice neighborhood with adequate parking and was walking distance to Green Lake and shopping areas.  The location is quiet and Sarah was a terrific host.
4968752,55682663,2015-12-04,13006898,Anne,"Fantastic place! Great host! Sarah met us when we arrived, gave us a quick tour of the cozy, clean, well acquainted 2bedroom, 2 bath place. It was quiet, very comfortable and a perfect location. In fact, I think this is the best AirBNB we've stayed at. The tea, coffee, yogurt and granola provided were all top notch. We even already tried to book it for another stay (it wasn't available, but Sarah gave us information on a friend's AirBNB just around the corner). :)"
4968752,55892059,2015-12-07,6511169,Sara,"We had a wonderful visit in Sarah's apartment.  It was very comfortable  and clean.  Sarah went above and beyond by leaving us granola, yogurt and coffee for breakfast and assorted bath products.  She was also super accommodating, providing a pack'n play for our daughter and an air mattress for our friend.  It is also a great location...we would definitely stay there again!  "
4968752,56188964,2015-12-10,22043016,Jessica,"Absolutely loved staying here! It was inviting and cozy. There was a lovely selection of teas and great coffee left for us. The rooms were comfortable, warm and inviting. The neighborhood is adorable. Just a few blocks away is a lake which is nice to see even in rainy days. We were walking distance to several restaurants, including our favorite Wayward Cafe. There was an endless supply of towels. Will stay here everytime I visit Seattle!"
4968752,56336351,2015-12-12,26329001,John,"Sarah was friendly, professional and she responded quickly to messages. Her apartment is fantastic; clean, well decorated, comfortable and she even had yogurt/breakfast and coffee for us in the morning. We would definitely stay again. Don't be afraid to try one of the fun board games she has available! "
4968752,56605865,2015-12-15,11908044,David,When we arrived Sarah made us feel most welcome. The apartment was clean and tidy and had all the amenities that you would expect. As we had 2 young children it was great to have some toys for them to play with and baby cot all set up ready. Having 2 bedrooms was great so we could have one child in a separate room. We also had fast internet and a tv with Apple TV. Would recommend to friends and hopefully we will stay again soon. 
5847934,31838896,2015-05-10,4681475,Phil,Great checkin experience with Doug.
5847934,32832149,2015-05-22,30994558,Xiao,"This is my first airbnb experience, the host is very nice and shared us some useful information in Seattle. The apartment is in perfect location so can can go to Pike Place Market or Space Needle just in a few minutes. Everything is good in apartment, clean and comfortable for us to live in"
5847934,32875615,2015-05-22,31242707,Ning,The host canceled this reservation 35 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5847934,33679236,2015-05-31,30911760,Michael,"Everything was perfect. Place was super clean, the host answered all our questions, location was on point, the pull out couch was just as comfortable as a normal bed,  and lastly there was a great view from the balcony. It was extremely nice to have a parking spot in the building as well.  This was a 10/10 experience and I would recommend it to anyone asking. "
5847934,40895934,2015-08-03,4599065,Christine,"The Condo was perfect and in a great location for the market, down town and the water front. We were six adults in Seattle for my daughters wedding, there was every thing we needed for a memorable weekend.   "
5847934,44450510,2015-08-26,16401385,Buena,"The Belltown Court Suite was exactly as described.  The place was clean and had all the amenities of home that we needed (laundry, fully set-up kitchen, fitness gym).  The place was a in a prime location for walking to all of the sights:  Space Needle, Pike's Market, The Harbor, etc..
Our host Doug communicated with us exactly as expected on the day of arrival.  He met us on-time to give the quick tour.  Parking was great since we had a car.  All instructions also in the binder for ease of use.  Definitely recommend.  We had a comfortable and pleasant stay.  "
5847934,46576929,2015-09-12,32218779,Mona,"This apartment is just like the photos.  Clean, well equipped, and perfectly located.  We were 5 adult sisters and had a very comfortable stay.  There are numerous top notch eateries within a block of this building in every direction.  Easy and pleasant walks to Space Needle or downtown and waterfront.  We found the perfect apartment for a Seattle getaway!"
5847934,48502966,2015-09-27,25348642,Marty,"The short answer is ""we had a great time and the place was perfect for our needs"".  We were in town for the Cal-Washington game (final score, Cal 30- UW 24) so we were happy with everything but the longer response in bullets:

* great location!  TONS of bars and restaurants within walking distance.  Not enough time in a weekend to check them all out but it would be fun to try!
* walking distance to LOTS of awesome Seattle sights and places including:  Space Needle (with Chihuly exhibit ++), Pike's Place, and the Olympic Sculpture Park
* easy transportation options (taxi or Uber) to other parts of Seattle.  

The apartment itself was perfect for two couples.  Bathrooms for each bedroom, walls painted in SF Giants orange (+++), and terrific views from the balcony and windows.  

The Sea To Sky staff was great.  Doug, our host, met us at the front door, gave us a quick tour, and left us alone.  Perfect.  

Only downside (and a teeny tiny small one), the apartment is in busy Belltown and it gets a bit noisy with garbage trucks in the AM and when the bars close at 2am.  But the hosts graciously provided ear plugs if desired.  We didn't even use the plugs.  

Overall:  highly recommend.  

"
5847934,54351346,2015-11-18,12243526,Abe,"This place is perfect and walking distance to good food, nightlife and attractions. Doug was very easy to deal with and communicated perfectly. The place is clean and has a really nice layout. We would stay here again next time we visit Seattle. "
5847934,56456613,2015-12-13,5111263,Nikolai,"The location is amazing, in walking distance to Pike's Market and plenty of other great options downtown. Very clean and accurate description. Didn't get to try the hot tub as it was out of order but the pool was nice / heated. Kitchen had everything you could think of so was very easy to dine in for a night. Cleaning fee is a bit steep so try to stay for a few days and really enjoy this amazing spot. Can't wait to be back. "
5362889,28290224,2015-03-21,2190612,Ryan,"Thanks so much Drew! GREAT location for anyone staying wanting to stay downtown or close to the Arena. Easy access to great food and bars. Walking distance to the space needle. Host made us feel so welcome with some great recommendations. Place was spotless- looked like it had just been professionally cleaned.  His place does have an available parking spot, but the garage is pretty tight. If you have to rent a car, make sure it's a small one. My first experience in Seattle was a great one- can't wait to come back!"

5362889,33269989,2015-05-26,2022038,Russell,"Drew,  Thanks for for making available such a nice place for a visit. I'd echo everything in the other reviews. Location was great, right by the Seattle Center. Apartment clean, comfortable, kitchen adequately furnished for cooking. The only place to eat together as family was outside which was little too cold for comfort, so we ended up cooking less than planned.  Worked out fine as there are plenty of nice cafes & restaurants around. Drew met us when we arrived, and familiarized us with the condo. We had a wonderful stay."
5362889,33448171,2015-05-28,20552728,Uday,"Lovely apartment in a great neighbourhood, well stocked a provisioned by the host. Drew was accommodative to our requests and needs and provided suggestions and info when requested. "

5362889,35304693,2015-06-17,4577378,Tracy,The host was there quickly after our arrival.  We had difficulty with the lock on the door.  He exchanged keys with us but we continued to have difficulty.  Fortunately one of the party members could work with it and get the door open.  I never was able to open the door.  The house was not clean but was a great setup for us.  A good cleaning and I would definitely recommend this place.  Drew was quick to answer any texts we sent him and let us have an extra hour when we were checking out.  The location was excellent and lots of choices for dining a short walk away.  He also provided a blowup mattress when an additional person joined our party.
5362889,35457391,2015-06-19,29483292,Kimberly,Drew's place is in an awesome location. You are a short walk away to the Key Arena and Space Needle.  Everything was as described.  Amazing place in Seattle!

The kitchen was well equipped and there is even a grill on the great patio with views of the needle.   The apartment was spacious and clean (although the floors could have used swept a little better).  Overall we would stay here again!"

Drew was very accommodating and responsive to all our needs/requests, such as an air mattress for our toddler and extra keys. He even had an a/c unit in the living room for the heatwave Seattle had during our stay! Apartment location is great for kids, near Seattle Center  Fountain Sprayground and Childrens Museum (2 blocks). Having two bathrooms, laundry, parking spot and extra towels were a plus for us. Great neighborhood spots like Triumph Bar, Red Papaya are nearby. Thanks Drew!"

5362889,43219496,2015-08-18,21851584,Bill,"Great place, great location, great host.  Drew was easy to reach for any questions I had.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."
5362889,43925553,2015-08-23,34882318,ElfMan,"The location was unbelievable if you want to spend time in Seattle Center (walk to Key Arena, monorail, space needle, etc.).   We didn't bring a car this weekend and didn't need it.  Drew also pointed us to a pedestrian bridge a few blocks the other direction to get to the Elliot Bay Trail up and down the waterline.

We were glad that Drew added an A/C over the summer and we turned it on a few times to cool things down a bit (it was a warm weekend).  Checkin/checkout was incredibly smooth.  Drew showed up to greet us within a few minutes of when we texted him that we had arrived.  Thanks Drew!"
5362889,44296310,2015-08-25,35750894,Shiwen,"Very nice host, perfect location and cute apartment. "
5362889,45255986,2015-09-01,29140501,Tina,Drew was an awesome host! Our flight to Seattle landed much earlier than the check-in time but Drew had it all cleaned and prepared before we arrived. He was easily accessible via text and was very prompt with any of our needs. His place was clean and only a 5 minute stroll to Seattle Center. We had a wonderful time at his place and would definitely stay here again the next time we are in Seattle!
5362889,45925552,2015-09-07,31221273,Bolek,Drew made us feel very welcome and made an extra effort to match our arrival time.  The apartment is in a great location and has a very new/modern feel to it. We used a taxi from the cruise ship docks ($15) to get to the apartment and we used Speedy Shuttle ($35) to get to the airport.
5362889,46295667,2015-09-09,32145279,Whitney,Wonderful! Perfect location and apartment was nice and clean. 
5362889,46467313,2015-09-11,31857229,Renee,"Drew met us at the condo and gave us some tips about the area. He was very welcoming. The condo is lovely and in a terrific location. The condo is within walking distance to a local grocery store/market, several restaurants, the Key Arena, monorail, Space Needle, Chihuly  Exhibit / Garden and much more!
You can't go wrong with this vacation rental. "
5362889,46891426,2015-09-14,39030773,Krista,As advertised.   Great apartment and even better location.   Easy walking distance to downtown/Pike Place.  Drew was accommodating and quick to respond to any questions or needs.  Great time in Seattle.
5362889,47361510,2015-09-18,37668639,Donna,Location was close to downtown.  Was very clean and we (4 woman) felt comfortable and safe. Drew was helpful and really nice guy. 
5362889,47646732,2015-09-21,11984991,Kaliyann,"We had the most amazing time at Drew's place. The apartment is in a great location, only minutes away from the space needle and EMP! Very clean and it felt like home. We arrived super early and didn't realise that check in was at 5pm when we booked our flight. Drew was kind enough to let us leave our bags in the apartment when we arrived so we were able to explore Seattle luggage free! We've stayed in a few airbnb homes in the past and Drew's place takes the cake. Super friendly host.. Highly recommend!! "
5362889,48074062,2015-09-23,38336587,Angie,"Drew was responsive, however, the place was a very big disappointment, the master bedroom had no lighting the light in the fan was out and there was a small lamp that did not put out enough light to see your clothing and no where to put suitcases.  There was only one nightstand so we had to use our ice chest as a nightstand so my husband would have a stand to put his CPap machine on.  The bath had all of Drew's stuff still on counter so we had to make due to get dressed.  There was no room in the closet to hang anything it was full of Drew's stuff.

The second bedroom was basically a bed on the floor, no nightstands at all again we had to make one out of a ice chest for the other gentleman's CPap machine.  The room smelled like dog, and I specifically searched for places that were not dog freindly so we would not have to deal with the smell.  The closet had stuff thrown into it and we could not tell if the sheets were clean or dirty.  The second bath tub and sink would not drain.

We were unable to sit on patio because there were golf clubs, bike wheel and dog and cat food.  

Overall, this is where Drew lives and he basically packs a bag and stays with someone while it is rented out.  It was a BIG disappointment and especially since this was the most expensive Airbnb place we rented."
5362889,48567461,2015-09-27,24300978,Marilyn,Drew's apt was clean and ready for our arrival. Drew met us with the key and explained a few things about the garage etc. but really everything was easy to figure out. Great neighborhood. We could walk  most places or use uber so we actually never drove the car! The description was accurate. I'd stay here again.
5362889,48999441,2015-09-30,38758958,Ian,"Everything was exactly as expected per Drew's excellent information. The apartment was clean, welcoming and in Seattle's BEST location.
Drew provided a list of nearby (and I do mean nearby) restaurants, and a high end 24x7 supermarket that stocked Oregon Blue Cheese (a must-taste!).

We were attending a conference at the Washington Convention Centre which is a simple 5 minute drive. 

Would I recommend Drew's place. ABSOLUTELY."
5362889,49890701,2015-10-07,37706155,Stan,"We found the location to be very handy to the activities we wanted. The Space Needle, Chihuly Glass Gardens, the monorail, the waterfront and several great restaurants were all a short walk away. It was very convenient and assuring to have off-street, secure parking for a car full of things gotten or taken for a two month tour of the Pacific N.W.

We will definitely check for availability if we ""Go West"" again."
5362889,50310098,2015-10-11,35241426,Megan,"Drew's place is perfect for those looking to experience all Seattle has to offer.  It is close to so many great attractions, restaurants, and transportation.  The place is exactly as described and anyone will be comfortable for families and couples."
5362889,50805012,2015-10-14,21270598,Lydia,"We loved staying at Drew's apartment!  Access and parking was really easy, he stayed to make sure we got settled in but then let us enjoy, and stayed in touch if we had any questions or concerns.  Art was beautiful, he had some great coffee table books, and even a washer and dryer and grill! Great view for sunset and easy to walk or Uber to most everything without having to find parking.  A lovely stay!"
5362889,51066336,2015-10-17,29764487,Suzanne,"Great location near Seattle Center. We walked each day either down to Pike Place Market or the waterfront - long walks to and from each, but worth it to not have to pay for parking. 

Drew was very helpful - anytime we had a question he was very quick to respond.  Our flight landed around noon, and even though the unit wasn't ready until 5pm, he gave us access to park and leave our bags until everything was ready.  We would recommend Drew and this location!"
5362889,51280190,2015-10-19,40329526,Georges,This was our first Airbnb experience and it was a lot of fun. The place was clean and cozy. The bed was very comfortable. And it was in a great neighborhood only blocks away from the Space Needle. Definitely a great place to stay while visiting Seattle.
5362889,51669124,2015-10-22,45447619,Alex,"I was in town for a couple of nights for work and Drew's place was perfect! It was close to my work location as well as all of the touristy things and bars I wanted to see in my limited free time. 

Not only was his place great for me Drew was an exceptional host that always promptly responded to any and all inquiries. Most of our communication was about my inexperience with Airbnb as his place was immaculate with everything I needed."
5362889,51949698,2015-10-25,45561994,Kevin,"The condo was great. Drew was very accommodating and ensured our stay went well. The description of the place is accurate, as are the photos. Great location, 5 min walk to the space needle, and walkable (or ~$5 Uber) to pike place area."
5362889,52517913,2015-10-30,25109077,Herbert,We could not be happier with our stay. Drew met us at the door to make sure everything was okay. The home was immaculate and clean even to my wife's standards. We used Uber a couple of times otherwise everything was easily within walking distance. The Space Needle and Chihuly was less than two blocks. It was also nice to have parking within the secure basement. The kitchen was well appointed and stocked with the necessities. Don't hesitate to stay in this wonderful city.
5362889,52716912,2015-11-01,30279853,Sharma,"Killer locations, nice and clean, comfy beds. Our family of four (with two tiny kids) were all very happy. Thanks, Drew!"
5362889,53363700,2015-11-08,46258013,Cassandra,Our stay at Drews house was great! The apartment was very clean and upscale. For our first time visiting Seattle it was in a great location. We walked to the space needle and took the monorail downtown. For our first air b&b it could not have went any better. I would defiantly recommend anyone coming to Seattle to stay at Drews. Hope to visit again soon. 
5362889,53986428,2015-11-15,29349418,Jackie,"The apartment is located in a great section of Queen Anne, a ton of restaurants and quick drive to downtown Seattle. Clean and spacious apartment. Disclaimer, you can't see the space needle or water from the balcony, buildings all around!"
5362889,54622391,2015-11-22,47789352,Karl,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it could not have been any better. Drew was extremely prompt and accommodating. The house was amazing, clean and comfortable. I will definitely stay here again next time I am in Seattle!"
5362889,55056203,2015-11-27,24883056,Eric,"Drew was very welcoming and accommodating for us! We had a really good time staying at Drew's place. Everything was there as we needed; all the entertainment, including Chromecast, Xbox, Comcast, was provided generously by Drew. We will definitely be back in Seattle again, and we hope to get a chance to stay with Drew again!"
5362889,56857578,2015-12-19,1357824,Ellen,"Drew responded immediately by text to questions. The apartment is clean and comfortable. Public transportation is right outside the door.  Numerous restaurants, a great supermarket and endless entertainment at the Seattle Center are all within easy walking distance. We enjoyed the fireplace, big screen TV and WiFi. There were plenty of magazines and brochures to help us plan our visit."
5362889,57219545,2015-12-23,14997316,Rob,Amazing experience! Very comfortable feel and perfect location for going out in Seattle. 
2508065,13615172,2014-06-01,4526463,Angela,Fritz and Jody have a very nice home.  It is artistic and stylish.  They were very welcoming and communicated promptly.  They live in a quiet neighborhood that was perfect for our stay in Seattle.
2508065,13681990,2014-06-02,14817879,Bill,"This was an excellent place to stay.  We found the house to be in a neat and clean condition, and it's in a lovely quiet neighborhood.  Fritz and Jody were easy to communicate with, and they were friendly and helpful.  They clearly wanted us to have a pleasant experience, which we did.  This is a ""best of"" listing."
2508065,15673163,2014-07-14,9486967,Gail,"We loved our stay in this warm home in an older neighbourhood.  Jody and Fritz have decorated the house in a very warm and artistic manner which we enjoyed immensely.  The bouquet of sunflowers on the grand piano was the final touch.  The kitchen was very well equipped with high end cookware and all the kitchen 'tools' needed for creating meals.  

Jody and Fritz were very welcoming; checking with us to ensure we had arrived, that we had no questions or needs and that we were enjoying our stay in their home. They had a printed booklet of suggested restaurants, bars, places of interest, etc along with maps and their comments about each place.  Several newspapers and magazines about the Seattle area and current happenings were on the coffee table. 

We would definitely stay here on return visits to Seattle. 


"
2508065,16822679,2014-08-03,12295934,Marion,"Fritz and Jody have a clean house, located in a nice and quiet  neighbourhood. The car can always be  parked at the backside of the house. It is a private spot, belonging to their house. 

For planning trips or eating out in Seattle they compiled a nice little list of information. Some of the things we did as advised by them worked out perfect.  Especially the ice cream parlour nearby, TILT, is great.  
About 500 yards from the house there are several small shops where you can buy basic groceries. For bigger stores, count on a ride of a few more minutes. 

Jody and Fritz were available for advice just on the first day of our visit. The other days they made a trip themselves, but it's no problem to get around in their house on your own. Fritz stopped by for a couple of minutes the second day, to get some things for their trip. During those minutes he had good advice for the day trip we planned to Fremont, a nice neighbourhood in the northern part of Seattle.

We all had a great time the days we spent here!

"
2508065,18883771,2014-09-02,8120053,Tiffany,"Jody & Fritz were great at making us feel welcome by providing us with great recommendations specific to our trip and around their neighborhood. Our group enjoyed our stay at their clean and comfortable home. My favorite part of their house was admiring how well they have utilized their space for storage and seating, while not compromising on design. The location also made it easy to get to anywhere we needed to go over the weekend. Thank you both for letting us stay here!"
4084712,21113032,2014-10-11,7693924,Drew,"The house is adorable--very much what the pictures show.  Super comfy bed, too.  Michele was easygoing and made us feel welcome.  Definitely a great place to stay!"
4084712,23227825,2014-11-25,23125359,Meghna,"Michele's place was really quaint and cute. It was about a 20min walk into the city and was in a really quiet peaceful neighborhood. It was different from some air bnb places that I've stayed in because it seemed like she lived there, but she wasn't around during our stay. We didn't get to meet in person but she was perfectly helpful and available via text. Thanks!"
4084712,25609352,2015-01-20,120213,Scott,Michele was great for us.  She left clear instructions to get in and we were left alone to enjoy our stay.
4084712,28185066,2015-03-19,29010141,Leo,"Although Michele was gone during our stay, we were glad to see everything ready to go when we arrived at her quaint and cozy home (the title of the place says it all). She was always a text message away and was always prompt in replying to us. The home is located close to downtown, with a frequent bus line and freeway access close by. The neighborhood itself felt safe, with the home surrounded by well kept homes and new apartment buildings. We really felt comfortable staying here and wouldn't hesitate to do so again when Seattle again calls our name. "
4084712,30911745,2015-04-28,9017440,Reena,"Michele was a great host. Her place was clean, cute, and cozy. It was also in a great location. Would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Seattle."
4084712,31487957,2015-05-05,2134063,Peter,We had a great stay at M&K's space. Only stayed one night but really enjoyed it. Everything was neat and clean and ready for us when we arrived. Really nice neighborhood - just a quick Uber away from the waterfront and the rest of downtown. Michelle was very responsive via text.
4084712,32280904,2015-05-16,32543279,Lavi,"The house is clean and quiet. I like the decorations and designs. There are stairs behind one of the door which leads to the lower level and the  door can not be locked... it is a little bit scary, especially the whole atmosphere of the house is quite mysterious. But I would say it is very safe to stay in this house."
4084712,32583492,2015-05-19,23781238,Stacey,This space worked out well for what we needed.  The location was very handy.  It was great to have a kitchen at our disposal.  
4084712,33159617,2015-05-25,32588227,Tori,"Truly quaint and cozy! This was exactly what we needed, close to the stadiums and clean. Had a great first time experience and would definitely stay here again. "
4084712,33637069,2015-05-30,34405464,Jim,"Communication was great, parking was easy and close. Great neighborhood . Getting into the house was simple. Real cozy and clean place. "
4084712,33887432,2015-06-01,8527936,Prashant,"Lovely place, have a very welcoming feel to the house. Whole experience was relaxing & private, hosts were helpful with the whole process. Would love to stay here again. "
4084712,33970224,2015-06-02,30480858,Charles,Our stay was lovely! The home was easy to find and in a great neighborhood. There were many things to do in the area.  The home itself was nice and comfortable. All around a wonderful place to stay. Highly recommend this home. 
4084712,34575787,2015-06-09,34449236,Denver,"The hosts were very nice and responded to all our questions via text/email within the hour.    The house had a very cool, quirky vibe and had everything we needed to cook meals and sleep four comfortably.  Apparently there are record high temperatures in Seattle for this time of year so it was unfortunate that there was no air conditioning but there were enough fans to ensure we were comfortable.  The location was in a nice area with quick access to trails for biking and running.  "
4084712,34595808,2015-06-09,2407180,Ronnie,I personally didn't get a chance to meet the hosts but the house was lovely. Only 8-10 minutes away from Capitol Hill. I loved the house decor and the hosts were very responsive if we needed help with anything! Would definitely book again. 
4084712,35245187,2015-06-16,29469161,Amina,"Very cozy place, we felt like we were home! Highly recommend. You do have to find street parking though but we knew that going in."
4084712,35960150,2015-06-23,9389033,Rory,"M&K were wonderful. They were some of the best airbnb hosts I have encountered. Their place is in a great location, especially if you're going to a baseball or football game. It's only about a 30 minute walk to the stadiums. The place itself was amazing! It was one of the most fun airbnbs I've stayed in. And the bed was amazing! I'd stay with M&K again for sure. "
4084712,36426688,2015-06-28,34453112,Elsy,"Everything was great. Just the incident of the wifi password, but all in all a wonderful experience."
4084712,36702708,2015-06-30,30733955,Jordan,"This was a great place to cozy up for a couple of days! The location is easily accessible - easy parking too. The place was cozy and clean, and the beds were awesome! We slept great. Nice little kitchen and bathroom too. And M&K even left tips on places to eat which we loved since we love food!! Nice having access to a washing machine too. All in all a great stay. Thank you!"
4084712,37077860,2015-07-04,7449135,Burak,"The house was very close to downtown and it was very clean. It was a very good experince definetely. If I come to Seattle again, I'm sure that I will stay there:)"
4084712,37670074,2015-07-09,35073974,Shuo,The location is very good. It's almost  in the center of the city. Easy to parking.
