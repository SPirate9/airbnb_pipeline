841049,4792882,2013-05-26,790561,Cori,"Alexia's place is well located in Capital Hill right near the bustling Broadway stretch and was super easy to get to from downtown via bus as well as to walk to nearby bars and restaurants. I recommend walking down Broadway to Pike to enjoy that 'Capital Hill' atmosphere. Alexia was flexible with checking in at noon and very welcoming; her home was bright and clean. The room was nice, I loved the bar with the stools, a great place to set your stuff down or get ready. You won't find a better deal in this location!"
841049,4888080,2013-05-31,110058,Ariel,"Great place to stay! Alexia is very accommodating and helpful, and gave us good information on things to do during our stay. Her place is cute, clean and quiet (even with other guests there during our stay). The location is excellent it's close to a lot of great restaurants and parks, and very convenient to several bus lines. Would definitely recommend!"
841049,4948134,2013-06-03,6388499,Su-Lin,"Absolutely love where this place is located at! It is in Capitol Hill, just a very short walk away to Broadway and a short bus ride to downtown (buses are rather frequent too)! I stayed 3 nights at Alexia's and it was great. The room and bathroom was super clean and Alexia was kind enough to provide towels and bathroom essentials for us to use. Upon arrival, she greeted me and gave me suggestions to where I should go and how do I get there. Other than that, Capitol Hill is a pretty good place for its nightlife too! Highly recommended! "
841049,5000053,2013-06-06,4554864,Kaman,"Alexia was a wonderful host. The room we stayed in was the room for two. She left us a customized note telling who our neighbor was and all the info we needed to know. She even hand wrote us directions since we mentioned we wanted to visit Bruce Lee's grave (which is extremely close to her place). The house is old, but extremely clean. The bathroom is big and renovated. Overall, great stay! "
841049,5020440,2013-06-08,2479192,Joelle,"Alexia was incredibly helpful to me: I was travelling solo to medical appointments with my 2.5 yr old son from out of country.  We had never been to Seattle before.  Alexia went above and beyond what I would have expected, even driving us to one of our destinations and buying sweet presents for my children! She was always concerned and tried to help where she could: hanging out with my son, carrying our bags up the stairs, etc.
It was a huge help having a kitchen I could access and having a friendly, helpful host was even better!
The location was also great, across from a school park and blocks from the beautiful Volunteer Park with a wonderful children's park.  We rode the bus back from the aquarium without any problems.
The room and bathroom was very clean and worked well for us - with a bar stool and shelf so that I could hang out in the room to watch my son as he slept.  Very nice big old house.
I would highly recommend Volunteer Park room 2 and we will stay here again when we return."

She's very eager that her guests get the most out of their stay in Seattle. 
The house was lovely and clean and the morning coffee was very much appreciated. Thanks Alexia!"
841049,5165811,2013-06-16,1020404,Audrey And Morgan,"I was there for a conference and had a great stay. It was everything that I needed and would stay there again if I ever land foot in Seattle again. Her place is close to everything. It is great if you like to walk because she is right down town, or if you want public transport, again it is near. She is a great host and helped me find where I needed to be, plus also stayed up late into the night on my arrival to ensure that I could get in. Thanks Alexia!"
841049,5268016,2013-06-21,5151403,Zhu,"Alexia is a very very responsible host~ She gave me a lot of information about Seattle, and before check in, she gave me a very detailed direction about how to get to her house~ the room was so clean.  The house is very near to the downtown, about 20 minutes walk, and you can also take No.49 bus to downtown.  "

841049,5537250,2013-07-04,701635,Eric,"Made a last-minute reservation. Alexia was very responsive and worked to help us get set up. A great treat to be abel to spend a day in Seattle on our way back home from the Far East. Alexia made sure we knew everything we had to know to enjoy our stay--a terriffic host.

Her home is clean, bed comfortable and room quiet.  You will share bathroom if she has another guest, but this was no problem. Location is fantastic and highly recommend a stay!"
841049,5604299,2013-07-08,6446507,Lisa,"Our stay with Alexia was our first experience with AirBnB. We're grateful to have found an affordable, comfortable, clean place to stay while visiting our son who's on a short-term work assignment in Seattle.  There was another guest staying but we wouldn't have known it if we hadn't been told.  Alexia was a gracious and helpful host & the house is on a quiet street nearby to lots of amenities.  Recommend you leave your car at her place and walk!  "
841049,5752215,2013-07-15,6340500,Gina,"I totally recommend Alexia's apartment. It was extremely clean(especially bathroom), cozy and well located in friendly neighborhood. We had good night sleep and easy access to nice restaurants and must-go Seattle landmarks. Alexia is one of the most responsible hosts you can ever meet in your homestay experience. Thank you Alexia."
841049,5797470,2013-07-16,2925882,Natasha,Alexia's place is lovely and clean. The bed was very comfortable and the bedroom was secure. Alexia was helpful in providing maps and transit info.

841049,5892855,2013-07-21,7228570,Saline,"Alexia was extremely helpful as we planned out our itinerary (even though we only stayed for one night).  Her house is set in a great, active neighborhood (Capitol Hill) while the house itself was quiet and quite peaceful.  I would definitely recommend walking over to Volunteer Park and going up to on the tower to catch a great view of Seattle."
841049,5929294,2013-07-22,7489157,Ryan,"Highly recommend the stay with Alexia. She was very helpful in guiding myself through the AirBnB process. She was also very helpful giving directions and provided some awesome recommendations. The room is very clean, comfortable and overall a great experience. "

841049,6300972,2013-08-07,6571132,Kraig,I stayed for only one night with my girlfriend but would have stayed longer if we had more time.  The room was nice and Alexia was very accommodating.  The location was great for us in a quiet residential neighbourhood - walking distance to downtown or a cheap taxi ride back later on at night.  Free parking is also available.  I'd definitely recommend.
841049,6322168,2013-08-08,3355976,Janice,"My parents stayed here for one night before we left on a trip. They thought it comfortable, clean, quiet, a perfect place for a good night's sleep. Alexia provided directions to local places for breakfast. With both in their 70s, they had a bit of trouble climbing the stairs without a railing, but they enjoyed their stay and their introduction to airbnb."

841049,6421442,2013-08-12,4584088,Guillaume,"Wow, where should I start. 
Alexia was an amazing host and I had a magnificent time with her.
Flat is very clean, very well situated and the atmosphere is very friendly. Room is very comfy.

Alexia offered her help to let me be able to take pictures at a certain place, and then went out with the other guest on an eating trip in Seattle.

I strongly recommend anyone to stay at Alexia's place without hesitation. You will not regret it.

And Alexia, thank you so much for making my stay so unforgettable !"
841049,6611191,2013-08-19,3511573,Alissa,"My husband and I stayed with Alexia for two nights in August 2013.  If you're looking for a great AirBnB experience and accommodation in Capitol Hill (or a central Seattle location), we highly recommend staying with Alexia.  The location is superb, and the space is very clean and comfortable with nice historic charm.  Alexia is a wonderful host.  She is accommodating, prompt, personable, meticulous, and conscientious.  She went out of her way to make sure we had a pleasant stay, which we truly appreciated.  We were grateful for the complimentary parking as well. "
841049,6672910,2013-08-20,7082595,Sam,"Alexia was really nice and helpful. The place is in a wonderful location and the room is nice, sunny and clean. "

"
841049,6922279,2013-08-30,8121517,Joshua,A lovely room in a wonderful neighborhood. Alexia is a very thoughtful & caring host. 
841049,7006574,2013-09-03,5797087,Olivia,Alexia is a nice host and wants  you to feel comfortable all the time. The room is clean and you'll find everything you need. I recommend it to everybody.
841049,7114324,2013-09-07,3001382,Anja,"Alexia's place is really clean, well-located (very close to Broadway and several bus stops) and quiet. The bedroom was spacious and the bed very comfortable. Alexia was a great host and gave us many recommendations for restaurants and sights in Seattle. We had a pleasant stay and definitely recommend her place! "
841049,7148309,2013-09-08,8516322,Moraia,"Alexia is a great host. She communicated very quickly with me regarding directions as to how to get to her place via public transportation. On the day we arrived, it turned out that she was in the area so she was super sweet and gave us a ride to her place. Volunteer Park Room 2 is very clean and the bed was comfortable. Alexia is very generous and knowledgeable of the area, so make sure you get some recommendations from her! Thanks for everything!"
841049,7168529,2013-09-09,100354,Hannah,"Everything was exactly as described and Alexia was very hospitable. The room was clean and comfortable and the location was perfect. We went to Seattle for a baseball game at Safeco field and we were able to walk from Alexia's house to the stadium very easily. Coming back, we just had to take one bus. For sensitive sleepers, we would recommend bringing earplugs as this is a shared space and you may sometimes hear your neighbours in the hallway early in the morning. Great spot for a weekend getaway, thank you!"
841049,7395406,2013-09-18,1306560,Rodney,This place was a great fit for our wedding trip. It's just as described and Alexia is an outstanding host. She even provided maps and guides for Seattle. The location is in walking distance to bustling Broadway and Uber rides were usually only a couple minutes wait to bring you downtown. I would definitely stay here again.
841049,7441546,2013-09-20,8303111,Lisa,"Alexia was great in arranging our visit and allowed us to add a day to our stay after booking. When we arrived, she was very helpful but we also had lots of privacy during our stay. The apartment was very clean and the location was excellent. "
841049,7513865,2013-09-23,7287681,Mark,"Alexia was a great host.  She had great recommendations on places to eat, see and visit.  She was even nice enough to map us out to our destinations.  Her place is centrally located to many shops and restaurants within walking distance.  There's even a park (Volunteer Park) within walking distance with a good amount to do.  I would stay at her place again. "
841049,7607011,2013-09-26,8050431,Steph,"Alexia's flat is absolutely the best place to stay if you are visiting Seattle. Capitol hill is where it's at! And Alexia's flat is walking distance from all the fun bars and sites. We didn't use a car once. Furthermore, the room and bathroom are spotless like they've never been used. VERY comfortable stay. I think we slept about 10 hours in that bed, too comfy! To top it off, Alexia provided a comprehensive list of things to do and places to avoid. Very helpful.  We plan to stay with her if we ever visit Seattle again."
841049,7883432,2013-10-07,63508,Alice,"We had a short, but great, stay with Alexia. It was very easy to meet up with her to get the house keys. The house design made it very easy to have privacy. We never had any issues with sharing the bathroom with Volunteer Park Room #1. She was very professional and had everything prepared for us- coffee, tea, water, bath mats, towels, shampoo, body wash, heater, etc. She also had a great printout ready with lots of tips on things to do and places to eat. The neighborhood is beautiful and is very close to a lot of fun activities in Capitol Hill. Alexia was a great host!"
841049,7950692,2013-10-09,8288929,David,"Alexia was very helpful in suggesting things to do and how to get places. The room was very comfortable, especially the bed, and was very clean. I would recommend it to other travellers."
841049,7986032,2013-10-11,7294078,Jian,"Stay with Alexia feels welcome and happy for my husband and I. She gives us a lot of good advice for restaurants and places to go. Her room and bathroom is pretty clean and neat compare to other rooms we stay in our trip. She make her best to make us feel comfortable, including giving us electric heater and let us put our luggage in the living room until the evening of our leaving day. We recommend her place!"
841049,8134054,2013-10-17,3833141,Amy,"The room was nice, very clean, and quiet. And so close to all of the fun things on Broadway! Thanks Alexia!"
841049,8233905,2013-10-21,9273632,John,"This was an amazingly great experience. Alexia was absolutely wonderful-smart, logical, helpful & adorable--she told me many great places to go.  Her location really is the best in Seattle, within walking distance of good restaurants and shops, but also clubs. (The dancing and music was incredible).  Alexia's house was fantastic:  Clean, comfortable, functional, and simple tasty decor. I could sleep well, the bed was very comfortable. That is quite a feat, because my bed at home is really great, and I am not easy to please in that department.  So the place was really nice, but what made my trip was Alexia and the other guests. I felt like I was in my own home, and had an instant family / friends.  This was my first AirBnB stay, and I am so grateful that I landed with Alexia.  I will always come there for my Seattle trips.  And if you want the best value possible, so will you!   "
841049,8284726,2013-10-23,3843194,Patricia,"Alexia was a very good host. The room was exactly as advertised and she provided a great printed guide about the logistics. We had a good talk about the city and places to see. She even drove me to the bus stop in the morning, which was much appreciated!

The beautiful old home in which the apartment is situated in a gorgeous neighbourhood, and is on a lovely tree-lined street atop the hill. It's just a few blocks from the main drags (10th, Broadway) where there's a gas station, supermarket, many cafes and shops. I had a lovely walk around the neighbourhood and was so impressed by the parks, serene atmosphere and friendly people.

A note about accessibility: The bus stop to downtown is a 5-to 10 minute walk, and buses come only every 15-20 minutes, so you should bring an umbrella in the winter. There is a long flight of concrete stairs up to the porch, and the apartment is on the 2nd floor, so you need to be prepared for the exercise. Also, the street and surroundings are totally dark at night, so bring a flashlight if you're out at night!
"
841049,8393291,2013-10-28,9543385,Will,"Alexia was a fantastic host during my two-day stay in Seattle. The room and bathroom were very clean and well prepared. She also had great recommendations for things to do in Seattle, and in the Capitol Hill area specifically. There were no issues during my trip.
 
I would highly recommend Volunteer Park to anyone staying in the Seattle area. Fantastic location, very reasonable price, and a great host. 

"
841049,8417444,2013-10-29,9453260,Cesar,Alexia was a great host! She was very helpful and made my first trip to Seattle less stressful than it probably would have been if I didnt have her help! Leading up to the trip she had tons of suggestions for me on places to go visit and see. The room was nice and cozy and the house is located in a nice area. If you need a place to stay I totally recommend staying with her. :)
841049,8440723,2013-10-30,9652567,Linda,"Loved our ""Happy Hour"", all the helpful suggestions about Capital Hill restaurants and travel talk.  Was fun to get to know Alexia!"
841049,8495505,2013-11-02,9155112,Joanne,"Great BNB! Alexia took my boyfriend and I in at the last minute and gave us many suggestions on places to eat and spots to check out. It was our first time in Seattle and we lucked out I think with having her as a host, as she was very involved and thoughtful.
Her sheet of info is very helpful.  The house is situated in an ideal area of the city and the room is quite comfortable! I would stay again if I find myself in Seattle in the future"
841049,8594397,2013-11-06,3302964,Jenny,"I had a perfect stay with Alexia in the Volunteer Park Room! Here's all that I appreciated: Alexia was flexible with check in time, the kitchen was at my disposal if I needed it, the room was spotless, the bed so very comfortable, the bathroom clean, and a great location. Thank you for the great stay and I will most likely be staying with you again, if it's possible! Thank you!"

She even had a welcome list listing recommendations for sights and restaurants to try in Capital Hill and downtown. Her home is clean and conveniently located. She gave us very good and clear directions on how to get to specific sights and to her house. I enjoyed the assortment of teas that she had in the kitchen. Alexia even met up with us to drop off our bags so we wouldn't have to lug it around all day (before heading to the airport)! Thank you Alexia for a wonderful air bnb experience! 
841049,8837736,2013-11-20,7512353,Adam,"The house is located in a wonderful neighbourhood, 25 minutes walking from Pike's Place Market. The room was comfortable and nice, but the best was Alexia! :) The whole house was crystal clear, and we got delicious hot chocolates in the morning. 
She is a great host, helped getting know the city. It was easy to get around following her instructions.
We had some great conversations during the evenings, where we both shared our ideas and oppinions. She had a really good sense of humor, we were laughing so much during our stay. 
Hopefuly we will meet some day again! 
Thank you Alexia!"
841049,8852703,2013-11-21,6779677,Hilary,"Alexia was a very thorough host. Even though we just stayed one night, she set us up with lots of information about the area, where to eat, transportation etc. The room and accommodations were just as advertised, and were very nice and clean. The place is also in a great location for a great price. "
841049,8914861,2013-11-25,275726,Cristina,"What a treat to stay here. Comfortable room, well located, with a lovely and attentive hostess.

Her place is conveniently located nas has great access to Broadway st. Alexia went out of the way to help with some personal supplies/ toiletries that I had missed getting and gave us good info on nearby places.
841049,8990476,2013-11-30,426613,Liam,"Alexia is funny, and she gave a great list of recommendations and stuff to do in the area. I didn't get why we needed to take off our shoes in the house though, especially since she has hardwood floors everywhere."
841049,9071970,2013-12-04,225191,Matthew,"Alexia was AWESOME! What a great host. The room was open, clean,spacious, comfortable and the location was great.

Alexia is personable and welcoming. "
841049,9146108,2013-12-09,43583,Carina,"My brother and I enjoyed our stay at Alexia's very much! She made us feel very welcome, the room was cosy, clean and warm. The communication with Alexia was easy and it was very nice to talk to her. She was very helpful and caring. She was around, but we didn't see her so much, but knew she would help right away if we needed sth. We got self-made warm chocolate cookies, good advice to explore Seattle and even a ride to the metro station. Check in and out times were very flexible and convenient.
The house is in a great location if you want to explore Capitol Hill. Just three minutes off Broadway, where you can eat, drink and shop.
The bus that takes you downtown is pretty close too!
We had a wonderful stay in the best city! Thanks Alexia, I'll be back :)
"
841049,9246723,2013-12-16,9995581,Tara,"We loved Alexia and her home. Awesome area of town! She is very organized and gave great tips on what to do and see while in seattle. Would definitely recommend staying with her!!
"
841049,9446277,2013-12-29,801055,Allison,"Alexia was very very accommodating! The room and bathroom were clean. She made us hot chocolate and breakfast! We all watched a funny Japanese movie, too. She drove us around and gave us a mini tour of Seattle which was nice since we didn't have a car in the beginning and it was REALLY cold outside. Once we did get a car, there was free parking in the back which helped a lot. We liked that we had a key to lock our room in addition to the front door. The neighborhood is safe and walkable with lots of shops and places to eat close by plus a huge grocery store down the street. "
841049,9522397,2014-01-01,1377370,Melissa,"Our three night stay was great! You can't beat the great location and the ease of getting downtown on public transportation. Our host was most helpful with places to go. She was very accommodating and made our stay a pleasure! Thanks again, Alexia!"

841049,9768763,2014-01-08,10089665,Torben,"Alexia was kind enough to reply quickly to our last minute request. She made everything to make our stay as comfortable as possible, provided us with towels, a map and many helpful ideas of what to do in Seattle. Thank you so much for everything! "

841049,9775014,2014-01-09,1030062,Eric,"A friend and I stayed at Alexia's after driving down late from Whistler and stayed one night before catching a flight early the next morning. Alexia's place was spotless and was a great place to crash, I wish we could've stayed longer. She was extremely organized and had everything ready when we got there."
841049,9832956,2014-01-13,3401004,Whitney & Peter,"Alexia's home is in a very nice area of Seattle, close to many restaurants and public transit. Her house was very clean and she provided everything that we needed. It seems as if Alexia is trying to run her Airbnb like a hotel, so there was another room that was rented out on our level. Alexia provided many tips and advice for seeing seattle, which was great!

My only gripe is that she is in the middle of remodeling and the kitchen and living room were disheveled. I would have liked for there to have been a more comfortable living area available. But, overall we would stay with her again, it is a great value. "
841049,9861214,2014-01-14,10161376,Celia,Alexi was great. I really appreciated her getting us in with less than 24 hrs notice. The room was clean and we slept great. My daughter and I had a great time walking around the neighborhood as there was a ton of fun shops and restaurants to explore.  
841049,9901233,2014-01-18,9293617,Xian Hui,"Alexia was really friendly and great! She even sat us down to plan our itinerary in Seattle, which she didn't have to at all. Her place was very convenient, well-equipped, and comfortable. Thanks, Alexia, for such a pleasant stay!"

841049,10019576,2014-01-26,10035638,Mary,"As a first time visitor to Seattle, I feel I got extremely lucky in my accommodations.  Alexia's place is located in Capitol Hill, one of the most premier neighborhoods in Seattle.  The neighborhood itself is extremely lively and accessible, but Alexia's street is quiet and felt very safe.  

She is an extremely welcoming, helpful, and thorough host.  Immediately upon arrival, Alexia provided us with a detailed map of Seattle and spent a good half hour going over it with us and suggesting places to eat/see/visit.  

I would imagine this is the best value by far.  Thanks Alexia! We would love to stay again!"
841049,10115367,2014-02-01,10631508,Hyounjung,"I strongly recommend this place!! Alexia is very good person! The cleaning condition is good like a hotel. Cozy and nice!!

841049,10207307,2014-02-06,677427,Huong,"Alexia is very very great host. I have never thought that will see the friendly, helpful and ardour host like her. She not only give us detail info about the house, the neighborhood but also take care of us very much. She took us to Pike Place Market when we had just arrived and showed us the bus stop near the house, the way to downtown,...She also helped us contact to the person we want to meet. Especially she took us to the Paramount Theatre to see the piano can play by it self, inside the theatre and told us about the silent movie in Monday. I was very very happy to stay with her. The room is clean and spacious, the bathroom equipment is full. The location is great too, near the nice park and bus stop to go downtown, University district. I will stay at her house if comeback Seattle."
841049,10276955,2014-02-10,11726465,Trishanna,"The room was clean, cozy, and private. My experience was positive and the house was in a great location--everything was within walking distance. "

841049,10521222,2014-02-23,9638284,Thomas,"This was my first time in Seattle, and I am glad I stayed at Alexia's.  She was friendly and helpful with a quirky sense of humor.  My trip to Seattle was to interview for an engineering job; and I got an offer 3 days after my interview.  Overall a very successful trip, and better than staying at a hotel!"
841049,10566623,2014-02-25,11022167,Beth & Kris,"We stayed at Alexia's place for two nights. It was extremely comfortable, was in a great location, and Alexia was a fantastic host. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in Seattle"
841049,10656421,2014-03-02,429005,Jessica,"Alexia is a gracious and considerate host. She’s described her duplex and neighborhood precisely. I had business at the convention center, and it was great that a short (30-minute) walk, or shorter bus ride, could bring me to her charming neighborhood, which is another distinct flavor of Seattle. Great place for meditative strolls or seated, drink-in-hand people-watching. (A dining favorite downtown: the salmon bowl at Dragonfish, attached to the Paramount Hotel.)"
841049,10694559,2014-03-03,786884,John,Alexia was very accommodating during our stay. She was a great host. I highly recommend!

841049,10920991,2014-03-13,6378325,Nathaniel,"Had a lovely stay here with Alexia. She is super knowledgeable about Seattle and always had great suggestions for things. Since this was my first trip she was super nice, and gave me the push I needed to get out and experience Seattle. She even kindly dropped me off one night to a local bar I had been wanting to visit and insisted I check out Capitol Hill on a Saturday! The location is superb it's in a beautiful area and  super close to everything. If you're looking for a clean and spacious place to stay that is minutes from all the excitement of Capitol Hill you need to stay here!"
841049,10988854,2014-03-16,5003250,Xinmeng,"We enjoyed our short stay at Alexia's. She was very warm, provided us with a detailed list of recommendations for Seatle and our next destination. We had a comfortable and quiet room. Bathroom is spacious and clean. Alexia lives upstairs, we basically had the whole flat to ourselves. We highly recommend this place!"

841049,11075637,2014-03-19,11827016,Chanyoung,"Alexia was a great host even when we caused her some troubles, she responded in a kind, reasonable manner. She had a personalized list of sights and restaurants to see and clear guidelines for our stay in the house. She let us use her kitchen, which had more than everything we needed, and the bathroom was always clean. She picked us up from the market where we stopped by on our way to her house even when it wasn't necessary and she dropped off our bags on our last day so we didn't have to stop by her house to go to the airport. Overall, I very much recommend her room. "
841049,11092778,2014-03-20,11079120,Regina,The host was very neat and the place was as advertised. The place was in a great neighborhood and easy to get around there.

I enjoyed visiting with her during my brief stay. Thank you Alexia!"
841049,11279359,2014-03-28,11187513,Justin,"Alexia is super friendly and very organized. She has airbnb down to a science! She gives you a well put together sheet with anything you need to know about visiting Seattle. PRIME location, right near the heart of Capitol Hill, which has so much to do, even with a 2 week stay you'd never see it all. Parking is very.. compact, so good luck if you're driving anything bigger than a Ford Focus!"
841049,11371211,2014-03-31,7729979,Mervin,"Clean room, beautiful neighborhood and a friendly host. Even with my short stay, Alexia was kind to recommend me the best of Seattle. "

Thank you Alexia for all the information and conversation!"
841049,11930457,2014-04-19,1681822,Jennifer,"This was such a great location!  Right in the heart of Capitol Hill and a literally 4 minute walk (LITERAL) to the main artery of the area.  I was able to go to a cute little movie theater in the middle of the night because it was literally two minutes from her house.

Wonderful bed -- very comfortable, very clean, a great value.  Bathroom is huge.  Alexia is a great host as well!  "
841049,11979988,2014-04-20,3735133,Sascha,I stayed at Alexia's guest room only for one night. It was decent. Alexia provides an informative printout with nearby restaurants and other great tips. The room has curtains but can't be darkened entirely. I had a good night sleep nonetheless.
841049,12027604,2014-04-21,988516,Daniel,nice room.
841049,12061348,2014-04-22,2629577,Andrea,Alexia's place is wonderful. Walking distance to everything and she obviously puts a lot of effort into creating the best experience for her guests. 
841049,12447463,2014-05-02,14885690,Cathal,A nice apartment in a fantastic location. Alexia is a great host with lots of suggestions and recommendations for Seattle. 
841049,12892180,2014-05-13,13995925,Stephanie,"First off, I want to voice my appreciation for Alexia's hospitality.  This was my first experience with Airbnb, and I didn't know what to expect.  From the day I booked my room, Alexia was very helpful with providing help with Seattle's transit from the airport to her neighborhood.  She was very prompt and thorough with responses to my questions, and I found her home easily. It's a beautiful home which is surrounded by trees and flowers in the spring; it's a quick walk to a very cool area on Capitol Hill, including Volunteer Park.

The room is neat, simple and secure--exactly what I needed for my stay.  Alexia printed out information for me so I felt comfortable being in her home and with the surrounding area.  She even gave me guest passes to the Seattle Art Museum and the Conservatory at the park.

I highly recommend Alexia's rooms for your stay in Seattle.  She is an excellent hostess with a beautiful home in a great neighborhood."
841049,13011606,2014-05-17,5306776,Andrea,"I had a great stay at Alexia's apartment. Alexia was a great host - very nice, helpful, and accessible. She gave me a map of Seattle and helped with directions to get around town. She also had plenty of suggestions for places to visit and eat, and even shared her museum membership card with me. I had full access to her kitchen, and she shared her delicious organic coffee, and tea.  

Her whole apartment is immaculately clean, and the room looks just as advertised. The bed was comfy, and there was plenty of space for luggage, a closet, and a desk and chair. The room goes out to the back, and it was so quiet that I could sleep with open windows. 

Her apartment is on a quiet street in a very fun neighborhood, with plenty of restaurants and stores in immediate walking distance. There are multiple buses going there from downtown, and there's a least one bus that takes you to University District. "
841049,13064733,2014-05-19,6053465,Jessica,"We stayed at Alexia's place for one night.
Alexia was very helpful before our arrival as well as when we arrived : she took time to show us the main features of Seattle on a map and explained how to get there. 
Our room was everything we needed : a nice bed, room for our suitcases and being independent. 
The volunteer park is also great to have just nearby !
Thanks again Alexia ! "
841049,13304755,2014-05-25,8222629,Xi,"Alexia is very nice and considerate. We had good conversations. The bedroom and bathroom were clean. The thing I like most was the neighborhood. It's not very far from downtown, about 20 min walk. It's only two blocks away from everything, but secluded and quiet. Extremely beautiful."
841049,13556598,2014-05-30,15941433,Justin,"I had a wonderful time at Alexias. You can tell she has hosted many travellers, making my stay there run perfectly like a well-oiled machine. Was very impressed with the building (very clean and I definitely still had my privacy even though I was vacationing). Would definitely do it again! Nothing but thanks to Alexia!"
841049,13791216,2014-06-04,14954985,Mika,"写真通りに綺麗なお部屋でした！
机やクローゼットも用意されていてなんの不自由もなかったです。
ダウンタウンまでは歩いて行ける距離ですが近くはないです。でもバス停が近くにあるので私はダウンタウンまでは歩いて行って帰りはバスに乗ることが多かったです。
ロケーションはとてもいいところでした。周辺にはスーパーもあったりレストランなどもあるので食べ物にも困りませんでした。近くのVivaceというカフェのコーヒーがおいしかったです。
相撲好きなAlexiaにはシアトルの見所を教えてもらったり、ご飯を食べながらたくさん話をしてとても楽しかった！もう１つの部屋に泊まっていたゲストと一緒にシアトルが一望できる場所に連れて行ってくれました。近くの公園にある美術館と温室の入場カードを貸してくれたりとてもとても親切でした！"
841049,13811342,2014-06-05,187148,Tricia,Thanks Alexia! This is a great alternative to a hostel. Thank you for making us feel at home during our short stay.
841049,14188862,2014-06-14,14864883,Brian,"This is a cozy place with great location next to almost everything you needed.

841049,15425757,2014-07-08,17275955,Jeremy,"I just recently stayed in Seattle over July 4th weekend after booking through Air bnb and hosted by Alexia A. From the start Alexia was gracious, helpful & pleasant. The house itself was in a vibrant, central and safe neighbourhood of Capital Hill. The room was exactly what was described. It was clean, comfortable, & served its purpose. I would most definitely stay there again and confident to refer any of my friends to stay there as well!"

Alexia does a great job providing information about the city and the neighborhood, so you'll have no problem finding things to do. Great experience overall, and I'd recommend it to anyone. "

Her house is clean and very comfortable to stay as I love to be clean. The bathroom is spacious too and the room is essential to what I needed for this trip. Alexis is also very accommodating which made my arrival very smooth. I noticed that she has flashlights near the stairways and one in my room, first air kit in the common cabinet and several umbrellas for lending. I love such thoughtfulness that I feel like I was living there! If I get back to Seattle again I would love to book more nights with her!! "
841049,16052365,2014-07-21,9956141,John And Jean,"  Alexia was there to welcome us and give us the guidelines. Our room was just as the picture depicted and was all very clean. The location was fabulous, leafy and close to transport and restaurants and parks. A great area."

I enjoyed staying there and talking to her, and actually miss her place after I came home. The room and the bathroom are very clean, and Alexia does dish washing for guests. The location is really convenient. It takes me less than 5 minutes to walk to the bus stop for 49 bus that goes to UW. It is a great area: quiet, and beautiful. I definitely recommend staying here! "

We arrived late and Alexia had waited up to greet us and help us with any questions. Her place is spotless and the bed was very comfy. Alexia also provided lots of helpful information about what to do in Seattle. We really enjoyed our stay. Thank you."
841049,17007177,2014-08-05,18201186,Oscar,"This was my first Airabnb experience and I only have one word. Amazing. If the rest of the AirBnb community hosts guests as Alexia does I'm never spending a dollar on a hotel night again.

The room itself is very accurately showed on the picture. The entire house is very clean and feels fresh. It's a quite spacious room with a bed a closet and a desk. The bed is comfy and I slept well. Capitol Hill is a nice area in Seattle, lots of small bars, restaurants and various shops. Alexias house is walking distance to the attractions around Capitol Hill but still on a quite street so you won't get disturbance from the nightlife while trying to sleep.

I can only give my highest recommendation. / Oscar"

841049,18631195,2014-08-29,8264436,Nina,"Alexia is a friendly yet quite professional host who keeps the accommodations very tidy and organized. My room was comfortable and spacious. The location was absolutely perfect - a pleasant neighborhood just between Volunteer Park and two different areas (that I found) of Capitol Hill's shops and restaurants, great for walking but also accessible by transit so that you can easily take the bus to explore other parts of the city. Suggestion to future visitors: follow Alexia's helpful instructions on how to get to and from the airport!"

Alexia is a great host, too.  She greeted me when I arrived, helped me find everything in the house, and had really good advice about good (and bad) restaurants in the area, short cuts to save walking time, and other good info about the area.  She really does love Seattle, and it shows.  

The location is really good too, with free private parking (rare in this part of town), bus service within a block, and easy walking to lots of shopping, dining, and other things to do.  If you're coming to Seattle for the first time, this is a great place to stay to get the local flavor and a good base for visiting the other parts of town."
841049,19013394,2014-09-04,3495974,Jane,"I have great time at this place. The room was as photoed and so was the bathroom. Alexia is very nice to let me know what is around Seattle and showed me a couple of maps. Place is clean, bed is comfortable but on the harder side. In a really great neighborhood close to captiol hills and the broadway. I would stay here again! And the price is awesome. "
841049,19245435,2014-09-08,10057243,Luis,"Alexia was a wonderful, considerate host and took good care of me.  I caught a cold right before my trip, and she took good care of me throughout my stay.  She also has menus, map, and recommendations for things to do in the area.  

The house is conveniently located near Broadway and Roy Street, where you can find many good restaurants, coffee shops, grocery store within 10 minutes walking distance.  The adjacent neighbors and streets are quite in the evening so no noise issue there.  The room is lightly furnished, clean, and comfortable as shown in the pictures. 

Overall I highly recommend Alexia's if you're looking for a place to stay in Seattle."
841049,19744149,2014-09-17,15939428,Michael,"It is really I good place to stay in Seattle! Alexia has a routine to host her Airbnb guests and is prepared very well. So I found a personalize sheet with all important informations around the stay and some advice for Seattle. The room has a lot of space, the bed is comfortable and the flat is very clean. I can really recommend this accommodation! Just one advice: Don't forget to take off your shoes downstairs, it could activate some panic ;-) Sorry, I forgot to do this as I was arriving!"
841049,19812086,2014-09-18,5644003,Christine,"The ideal spot on Capitol Hill: a quiet residential area near Volunteer Park, yet only a couple of blocks away from restaurants and shopping on Broadway.  Nice quiet space with high ceilings and a very comfy bed.  Alexia was very helpful and knowledgeable about Seattle.  A good stay... Thanks!"
841049,19902632,2014-09-20,8479902,Wendy,"Had a great stay at Alexia's!  The room is exactly as pictured.  Room and shared bathroom are both very clean.  The neighborhood is quiet and residential; the house is only a few blocks to restaurants on Broadway, 10 minute walk to bars/restaurants on Pike and Pine, and 20 minute walk or quick ride to downtown.  Alexia herself is really friendly and welcoming, and is more than happy to offer recommendations for places to go.  Do make sure to read her house rules as she takes them very seriously.  "
841049,20041341,2014-09-22,2920265,Coral,"We need more AirBnb hosts like Alexia. She is very organize, warm and welcoming. She provided an instruction sheet upon my arrival which included all the essential information I need to know (house rules & point of interests). She's also very informative & easy to communicate. 

The room is true to the photos and very clean! The location is in a walkable distance to downtown and close to many coffee shops & restaurants. I had no problem walking around the neighborhood during the night. I am glad I picked this place for my first visit to Seattle!"
841049,20209068,2014-09-25,21367609,Carol,"Alexia is a fabulous hostess.  Everything was super clean, arrival time easy, best maps and tourist information provided.  I had a rental car, and parking was easy.  Nice desk with power strip and WiFi in the room.  "
841049,20380614,2014-09-28,10705120,Marie,"The location of the apartment is ideal and the apartment is clean.
Alexia is concerned to have her guests feeling comfortable and will be available to give advice about visiting Seattle.

"
841049,20526843,2014-09-30,21418894,Harlan,"I had a wonderful stay with Alexia.  The room is as decribed, very nice and comfortable.  I would certainly stay there again. Thanks Alexia."
841049,20655311,2014-10-03,19580173,John,"Alexia has been a wonderful hostess for me. She made it possible that I had really a lifetime experience in Seattle in less than one and a halve day. She offered me a list of ""things to see or experience"" off the beaten track. Neighbourhoods, museums, places to eat, to walk, tours and about the public transport which brings you everywhere. 

She welcomed me warmly as I arrived late in the evening and patiently explained me the situation, and possibilities to have a pleasant stay.
The room was comfortable and well furnished. There was no need for me to have more. In the end she brought me to the railwaystation but not before she gave me the address of a very nice Cuban restaurant where I had my lunch.

There is really no doubt for me to recommend this place to anyone who wants to explore Seattle in a more than superficial way while surrounded by a very caring hostess."
841049,20721710,2014-10-04,9254505,Lea,"Staying with Alexia was a nice, friendly and relaxing experience. Her place was very clean and comfortable. I would book her again and recommend her place to others :) Thanks Alexia!"
841049,20808163,2014-10-05,22096248,John,"Excellent host, highly recommend. Rapid responses to all communication. Very clean and comfortable room. Great location. Thank you Alexia!"
841049,20923447,2014-10-07,21126188,Saeko,"Alexia was very nice and helpful and she gave good advice about where to go. Everywhere that her told me about is wonderful.
The room was also nice and clean.
I missed to check the luggage matter, but she allowed to put my big suits case on the entrance."
841049,20983803,2014-10-08,20360072,Kelly,"Alexia offers a relaxing and spotless environment conveniently located in Capitol Hill. She was helpful with directions and her hospitality was on point. My overall experience was superb, and I look forward to booking with Alexia in the future!"
841049,21359012,2014-10-15,21891814,Andrew,"Alexia was a great host.  She was very helpful and attentive to my needs, and offered several suggestions for food/things to do in the area.  Room was nice and clean and had everything that I wanted.  The area is a trendy part of town with plenty to do and decent public transportation.  The area is growing (gentrifying) quickly, so there's a lot of construction going on, including a new light rail stop that was a bit of a traffic snarl.  Otherwise a great place to stay!"
841049,21770133,2014-10-23,3454382,Ezekiel,"Alexia was a fine host, but we only really crossed paths when I checked in, because my trip was quite busy. The house and accommodations were great, exactly as advertised."
841049,21884615,2014-10-26,21175241,Gang,"Alexia is a very nice host without any doubts. She introduced me a lot of views of Seattle which are valued to see. She also will provide a lot of suggestion for my trip.
The house's location is the wonderful, only 5 minutes to board way by walk. There are many coffee shops, restaurants and supermarket on the board way. You also can go to fish market by walk. It just takes you another 20 minutes. 
It is a very good trip and experience for me."
841049,22326933,2014-11-03,8903868,Tiffany,"I had a nice, quiet, and relaxing stay at Alexia's. The bed was comfortable and the down duvet was extra cozy. I loved being within walking distance to several great restaurants and shops. I would definitely stay there again. "
841049,22413140,2014-11-05,22917098,Sterling,"Let me just lead by saying this is an all around incredible deal. Capitol Hill is a very nice neighborhood and this particular house is very well maintained and spacious. 

Although it is offset from the main attractions downtown, the immediate area has plenty to offer and accessibility to other districts by public transportation is no issue, especially because Alexia provides outstanding and timely directions upon request. 

The amenities, both hygienic and culinary are plentiful as well. 
"
841049,22480298,2014-11-07,6155639,Sébastien,The place was great and the bed was comfy. It is closed to bus station.
841049,22548957,2014-11-09,22858164,Steven,"I felt very comfortable and enjoyed my stay in Volunteer Park Room 2. This home is centrally located in Capitol Hill, and is close to many great restaurants and shops. Alexia is a very welcoming host, and is helpful with answering questions or providing recommendations for the area. I highly recommend this as a wonderful place to stay!"
841049,23024090,2014-11-20,12275024,Cathy,"Alexia is a great hostess, she had great advice on things to do and places to go.  Really enjoyed our conversations and her yummy coffee in the morning.  The room was perfect, clean and quiet.  The house has wonderful charm and style, the location was perfect, I walked everywhere I went.  Thank you Alexia!"
841049,23179640,2014-11-24,23200842,Donna,"I enjoyed my stay at Alexia's Volunteer Park Room 2. Alexia was very nice and considerate, she always knew what I needed and provided me help promptly. 
The room was really clean and comfy, it was well organized, and I found everything I needed. Many details of the room also spoke for her considerateness. 
Location was pretty good, very close to Volunteer Park, where there was a observation tower and the Asian Art Museum. Within walkable distance, I could go to Broadway Avenue, where many good restaurant s and shops were at.   "
841049,23303379,2014-11-28,23469864,Esmeralda,"My stay in Seattle was short, but Alexia made it very welcoming. I had some issues with my check-in time due to delays, and she was very understanding. When I arrived, she sat down and showed me a map of the area and suggested places to see and places to eat. She has a list of venues and house rules, which makes everything really easy. There's a great park near by and she let me use her tripod so I can take photos. Oh, the bed has the most comfortable mattress ever! Wifi was kind of spotty though, but for the most part it was OK. If it doesn't work, you can let Alexia know and she will restart it. "
841049,23590469,2014-12-05,1488575,Bob,Great location and very clean. Host knows the area very well.
841049,23656298,2014-12-07,1912506,Stacey,"My stay with Alexia was great. I was only there for a quick business trip but she was able point me in the direction of some late night food and was totally accommodating when I needed to move my arrival to a later time of the day. The room was very clean and the bed and comforter was amazingly comfortable. (I wish it was mine)

There was even complimentary coffee, which was truly a life saver since I had to leave early for an event both days. Thank you!"
841049,23857146,2014-12-12,1852822,Gary,"Alexia is very welcoming, a wonderful host. The room is very comfortable, and totally peaceful and convenient. Even parking!"
841049,23922415,2014-12-14,155310,Debbie,"Beautiful home, very comfortable, has everything you would need to feel at home.  Also nice and warm to get away from the winter chill!  I slept so well.  Alexia is a wonderful host who will help you enjoy the sights of Seattle and ensure you are taken care of.  Capitol Hill is a charming neighborhood and much more interesting than staying downtown.  I felt like I experienced the real Seattle.   I would definitely go back."
841049,23973603,2014-12-15,9421399,Allen,"I needed a place to stay for a night on a holiday swing through Seattle, and Alexia's Volunteer Park Room 2 was the perfect solution. Alexia responded quickly to all my inquiries and was super flexible about arrival/departure time, which helped a lot. She was very proactive about making sure I had everything I needed, and generously loaned me a cable to replace one I'd left at home. 

Accommodations were just what I was looking for too, a clean, comfortable room and shared bath in a classic older Seattle home - a little bit funky, but only in the good ways. (Old plaster walls, etc. - the place hasn't been stripped to the bones and remodeled with fresh walls, so retains the charm of an authentic older home.) I found the bed to be super comfortable, and really appreciated the desk and power strip for working in the room. Alexia was conscientious about making sure the wi-fi was working for me. 

The location is great, I took a nice walk amidst old Seattle mansions to breakfast in one of the nearby food & retail areas. Parking in that part of town can be a hassle, so having a home base to leave the car at was pretty awesome."
841049,24041679,2014-12-17,6645268,Robert,"Alexia was very warm and gracious.  A great hostess!  The house is lovely, filled with elegant colors that create a calm atmosphere and very clean.  The Volunteer Park location was perfect for me and I was grateful for the rear parking space."
841049,24256502,2014-12-23,8480994,Jim,"Listing description was accurate.  Great neighborhood, and close to where I needed to be.  I would stay here again. Thanks,"
841049,24451981,2014-12-28,25120548,Yumi,"I stayed 2nights in this room for the first trip to Seattle. It was comfortable place and Alexia was so kind. She knows Seattle very well, and the restaurant she recommended to me was amazing. I spent a wonderful time in Seattle because of Alexia. Thanks a lot.

英語を勉強中の私にもわかりやすく、家までの道順を教えてくれたので、バスの乗り継ぎでも迷うことなく、たどり着くことができました。計画をほとんど立てずに行きましたが、おすすめの場所をたくさん教えてもらったので、充実した旅になりました。
"
841049,24741103,2015-01-02,23982381,Aline,"Alexia was a very helpful host. She gave me awesome tips on what to see and do in Seattle. The room was spacious with loads of storage and the bed was really comfortable. Alexia cleans your dishes and the bathroom everyday, which is extremely appreciable. The house location is very good, 2 min walk away from Broadway Avenue, which has lots of shops ans restaurants. There is also a really nice cinema around the corner on Roy, which shows independent films. All the directions and public transport access listed on the website are accurate. It's really easy to go downtown with bus 49."
841049,25148582,2015-01-07,22090554,Aaron,Alexia was very nice! She was helpful in naming places/things to check out and how to get to them. Also handy was her list of good restaurants in the area. 
841049,25284200,2015-01-11,25199305,Stacey,"Alexia was a very friendly and welcoming host. She sent me very detailed instructions on how to get to her house and explained how to get around Seattle on transit. She also explained the ins and outs of the house and the departure rules very clearly. Her house was very lovely and the room was perfect. It was clean and tidy and very airy. It was a perfect room and location for my visit. The bathroom was nice and big and very clean. Alexia had tea and coffee available in the kitchen; and even though I didn't use it, if i had wanted, I could have made use of the fridge and everything in the kitchen. There was also wifi available. The Capitol Hill area of Seattle is really fun, there's lots to do. Alexia also pointed out cafes and good restaurants in the area. I felt very safe walking around at night in this neighbourhood."
841049,25450741,2015-01-16,25759941,Amie,"The listing description was super accurate, although words cannot describe how beautiful the neighborhood around it is. It was my first time ever in Seattle, traveling without a vehicle, and Alexia was amazingly helpful with finding my way around town and getting familiarized with the city. My trip was more ""business"" than it was for pleasure as I went to Seattle for the week to secure a place to live prior to moving, and Alexia was in so many more words helpful as a host. Book a room with her!"
841049,25618417,2015-01-20,19402661,Alyssa,"I really enjoyed the stay. The recommendations you gave me were the types of restaurants I would go to SF. Also, thanks for letting me use your SAM guest card. The house was very clean, and the location made it easy to walk to places. Overall great experience. Thanks, Alexia!"
841049,25649621,2015-01-21,12234862,Tamerlane,"As a host Alexia was attentive, prompt, generous and keeps the rooms used by guests clean and uncluttered. My room was light,pleasant, free of personalization in the form of art or nick nacks, and had everything I needed to be comfortable. The bathroom (which was immaculate)  was close across the hall and although shared by another room and the host, was always available at times I cared to use it. There was some sound issue as it is an older home with uninsulated walls and no floor coverings.  I felt that I needed to be extra quiet when going to the kitchen or bath so as not to disturb others, but really not a big problem! Thanks for the pleasant stay Alexia :)"
841049,25809111,2015-01-26,470744,Peter,The house was in a great location. My room was very clean and the bed was super comfortable. The bathroom was also very clean--water pressure not great though. Alexia was nice. I would recommend this room!
841049,25934252,2015-01-30,657741,Mihai,"I really enjoyed my stay with Alexia. She was able to work with my schedule and fit me in despite the late notice and limited availability. I spent five days in the house split between upstairs and the more private downstairs suite.

The house is bright, clean and organized. Upstairs I appreciated the well defined house rules which made my stay predictable from day one. 

I very much enjoyed getting to know Alexia and the other guests while I was there. She showed great interest in getting to know me and made me feel right at home.

I recommend staying here and hope to return."
841049,26122319,2015-02-03,7528539,Magdalena,"All went great. Reliable, open minded, well organized person. Alexia is a great host highly recommended. Apartament was exactlly as descibed, clean, comfty, bright."
841049,26289860,2015-02-08,2841347,Riff,"Spacious, well-appointed room, hallway closet was always stocked with fresh towels and linens, and complimentary slippers provided to guests since it's a ""no shoes, please"" residence. Extremely convenient location, especially if you're relying on walking and public transportation."
841049,26562541,2015-02-15,16841001,Mo,"It's my first Aribnb time and I love it very much! The room is very clean and comfortable. And has a pretty good location. If I will go Seattle again, I will choose this again."
841049,26805986,2015-02-19,25602601,Veronica,"Alexia is great! She welcomed me upon my arrival and gave me a tour of the house. I rented out volunteer room #2, it is in an incredibly beautiful and spacious room I would recommend it to anybody. The entire house is very clean and the restrooms are cleaned daily. Alexia makes her kitchen openly available and the restroom is easy to use among other guests. Public transportation is simple and there are direct routes from her place to downtown which is convenient. Alternatively, you can walk to Pikes Place Market in about 20 mins (I don't think I walk that slow). Overall, I had a wonderful experience. "
841049,27221454,2015-02-28,7675819,Steve,Alexia was a very experienced and organized host.  My flight got into Seattle late and she was able to accommodate my arrival time.  The older home is in a very convenient location to downtown.  The room and bathroom were very clean and newly appointed.  Alexia is very clear about the rules and expectations for guests and overall this was a good stay for the price.   
841049,27515748,2015-03-06,7306329,Margaret And Robert,"Alexia's house is very neat and clean, and it's in a great location. She is extremely serious about not allowing shoes in her house. Although she does provide some slippers for the use of guests, my size was not available. In contrast to my first visit which I enjoyed, I felt unwelcome immediately upon my arrival this time, because Alexia berated me for leaving my shoes one step above the area provided for guest shoes, and for bringing my own slippers from home. The house felt uncomfortably chilly to me during my stay in early March."
841049,27690890,2015-03-09,510529,Balint,"Alexia is a very nice person and a great host. He told me about lots of nice places to do in Seattle and around (Bainbridge Island) and generally made my stay very pleasant.

The instructions you receive when your reservation is accepted about how to get to her apartment are super detailed as are the leaflets she has for going to nearby stores, restaurants, spectacles, etc.

The house is superbly located, in a beautiful and very safe neighborhood that is a joy to walk around in. Volunteer park is a 10-min walk, Broadway (with all the stores and restaurants) is 5 minutes away. The room is very clean and the bed is very comfortable to sleep in.

I would definitely recommend this place."
841049,27970930,2015-03-15,28977560,Craig,"This stay was my introduction to Airbnb. The room was perfect--a very nice walk to my daytime activities. Alexia gave me a parking permit so I could leave my car on the street in front. I was pleased with the no shoes policy--everything was very clean and dust free. The room, in an older house, had been updated with new vinyl windows, with screens. Alexia let me use the kitchen which was handy for my morning oatmeal and coffee. She offered me her pass to the nearby art museum in Volunteer Park and had lots of recommendations for restaurants. All in all, a very nice experience!"
841049,28365343,2015-03-22,8963429,John,"Alexia's lovely house is in a nice leafy part of Seattle, not far from what looked like a university area with lots of little eateries and bars.  Alexia is a delightful host!  Quite quirky and with a distinct personality which I managed to draw out and get her laughing over a glass of wine!  She was a lot of fun to chat to and share opinions.  Her room and the bathroom is exactly like the photo.  Alexia was very helpful with suggestions on what to do in my short time in Seattle - Bruce Lee's grave, the Fremont Troll etc.  I will have to come back for more discussion!"
841049,28423453,2015-03-23,28624855,Dachi,"Alexia is a great host, I loved the trip guide she made herself, it is full of a local resident's insights about the neighborhood and the city. The place is tidy and clean and it is located in a wonderful neighborhood ."
841049,29853466,2015-04-13,9771833,Claire,"Alexia was extremely welcoming from day one - my flight was late and she waited up to let me in, which I really appreciated! Her house is immaculate, and very organised - Do's and don't safe clearly outlined when you arrive.  She's a wealth of information about all things Seattle, and is more than happy to give you recommendations and tidbits of local knowledge, as well as providing you with anything you might need throughout your stay. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend alexia's place for others - I was extremely comfortable here, and felt lucky to be located in such a fantastic location in seattle!"
841049,30644577,2015-04-25,15469659,Arif,"Overall good experience. Great location with clean, quiet facilities. 

One point to note - Alexia runs a tight ship with a very detailed system. There should be no surprises - her ad should communicate that quite clearly. But if you are uncomfortable with a lot of rules, then think of going elsewhere."
841049,30840351,2015-04-27,23774602,Nahal,I LOVED my stay at Alexia's place! The room and the bathroom and the kitchen were super clean (I have a thing about cleanliness). The fact that we all take our shoes off and walk around the house with slippers provided by Alexia is awesome. My bed was cozy and very comfortable. The shower head pressure was a bit low but still manageable. Alexia greeted me and was very accommodating with anything I needed. She even gave me her pass to the Asian Museum to use plus a parking pass to park a car. The house is walking distance from the wonderful Capitol Hill neighborhood with lots of coffee shops and restaurants and everything else one may need. I would definitely come back and stay with Alexia the next time I visit Seattle :)
841049,31741953,2015-05-09,17314168,Kyum,"Alexia was a lovely host, very welcoming. The room was clean and the best part of it was that it was really quiet. Decent neighborhood within walking distance to the Capitol Hill area and close to bus station to downtown. I have absolutely nothing to complain. I would definitely visit her again!"
841049,31861964,2015-05-10,32877743,Herve,"Great location in a quiet neighborhood yet walking distance from Pike/Broadway nightlife, only a few blocks away. Alexia recommended a few places I could visit considering the time I had before my dinner plans, which made my short trip to Seattle even better."
841049,32013228,2015-05-12,5406659,Kimberly,I had a really nice stay at Alexia's place.  Alexia was welcoming but gave me plenty of privacy.  The house rules are clearly laid out and easy to follow.  The bed was very comfortable and the whole apartment was very clean.  It's in a great neighborhood.  Just a few blocks from all the activity on Broadway but also very close to lovely Volunteer Park.  
841049,32168151,2015-05-15,161053,Miki,"My daughter lives 2 blocks away so I was familiar with the area - and chose this address because it was close by.

She was welcoming and kind, and she talked about her travel experiences as well as her recommendations for where to go in Seattle. The house was very clean, the neighborhood is beautiful, and the bed and room were very comfortable. Thank you, Alexia!"
841049,32726435,2015-05-20,33362612,Adam,"Staying here was great. The bed was nice, there's a desk to work at, and Alexia's coffee was superb. The only lacking amenity was a good iron; the one provided got the job done, but it was kind of scary to work with.

The neighborhood is great, and overall my experience staying here was really positive."
841049,33025135,2015-05-24,33168043,Frederic,Wonderful place to stay in seattle. The room was exactly as described. The bed was actually much more comfortable than it looks on the picture. Best of all is the location!!! Really close to downtown yet in a nice and quiet neighborhood. Alexia was a great host. She pointed me to great restaurants and coffee shops. I am going back for sure. 
841049,33181712,2015-05-25,31755052,John-Paul,The room was clean and well-organized.  There are two guest rooms and Alexia has a good system for keeping everything in order.  Alexia was helpful in helping me get settled and I could tell she wanted it to be a good stay. 
841049,33523220,2015-05-29,25149454,Yukun,"Alexia is such a nice host. She provided me with lots of useful information regrading the sight-seeing around the Seattle,  traffic and delicious food.  And she is very easy going.

The room was clean, quiet and comfortable. And the descent computer desk and fast wifi connection fascinated me a lot.

In one word, because of Alexia, I really enjoyed my first time with Airbnb."
841049,33699572,2015-05-31,8316300,Charlie,"Alexia's place was the great choice for my trip to Seattle. Upon my arrival, she introduced some great cafes and restaurants  that I can check out and some useful tips to explore the main areas. 
The location was amazing too. The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful yet it is still close to all the cool cafes in Capitol Hill. The room and the bathroom was very clean and she provided me all the things that I needed such as towels and a hairdryer. 
All in all, I am very satisfied with my staying at Alexia's!"
841049,34865262,2015-06-13,26734742,Qiuyang,"Living in Alexia's house is absolutely a pleasant experience. The house is in a great location. It is clean and tidy. Basically it has everything you need. Clean towel, desktop lamp, hair dryer, fast WIFI...  I lived here for 6 days. Alexia and I chatted a lot. She is talkative. In the first day she recommended some restaurant and attractions to me and she gave me a map in Chinese(I am from China). She is considerate. In my last day, I fell down on the ground before moving out. She drove me to the hospital, accompanied me in hospital and drove me to my moving in place. I really thank her. I hope next time when I come to Seattle, I can still live in her house. "
841049,35222762,2015-06-16,32515099,Mike,Alexia's place is comfortable and safe. Alexia is friendly and gracious. The location is excellent. The neighborhood is wonderful with a great park and 12th street shops and restaurants nearby. I would definitely stay again when possible. The directions and descriptions are very helpful.
841049,35574803,2015-06-20,21656283,Aleksandar,"Alexia is a great host. The room is spotless, and my entire stay was comfortable and hassle-free. I highly recommend this place."
841049,36050698,2015-06-24,35559786,Chris,"I had a fantastic stay with Alexia. My trip was more business than pleasure, but she was still full of great ideas and recommendations for where to eat and how to enjoy the city. The room was very comfortable, and you can't beat the Capitol Hill location. She's a gracious host and I'd highly recommend her to anyone looking to get a feel for Seattle."
841049,36415036,2015-06-28,33297198,Regula,"Alexia was very nice and realy helpful. The location is just great, walking distance to down town. The room was thanks to the 2 windows quite cool even it was very hot 
outside and the bed was extremly confortabel. I would stay with Alexis again.
Regula"
841049,38155181,2015-07-13,10039188,Jon,"Alexia was an absolutely wonderful host. First she let me arrive earlier than originally planned which was awesome. She provided me with a recommendation for a cafe that ended up being my favorite place in Seattle. She was super attentive and addressed any needs I had throughout my stay. The room and bathroom were clean, the room has a key lock, and the house was very easy to get to. That brings me to the neighborhood. All I can say is WOW. It is an absolute utopia of a neighborhood, so quiet, quaint and homely, but so many parks, cafes and restaurants within walking distance. When I come back to visit I will try my hardest to get this room again! "
841049,38363462,2015-07-14,22732655,Mark,"Staying with Alexia was a great experience! The neighborhood was charming and pretty centrally located - it was the perfect spot to explore from!

The room was clean, bed was comfy, and apartment great overall. I really appreciated Alexia giving me the flexibility to store my bag while I explored Seattle for the day before my red-eye back to NYC.

Great stuff all around! Highly encourage everyone to stay here if they can!"
841049,38470131,2015-07-15,9453387,Colleen,"Lovely bedroom in the Volunteer Park Neighborhood! Clean, bright and very comfortable bed. Alexia was exceptionally accommodating, I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle."
841049,38641131,2015-07-17,12040495,John,"Perfect order and cleanliness. Simplicity of spaces was soothing. Host set the clear boundaries on shoes (just as I do at home) and kitchen. Kitchen policy was generous—ample space in the fridge—and Alexia handles the dish-washing (a rare courtesy). Clean, Bright, Cheerful all around. The location is very easy for strolling Cap Hill and the best part of Broadway East is literally 5 ma five minute walk. Alexia was ready with information on the neighborhood. She lives on the floor above, so the separation from guests is clear. Alexia is a throughly practiced and dedicated host—in the groove. 
"
841049,38763320,2015-07-18,29510233,Christine,"My second night staying at Alexia's was delightful. I had booked room 2 for my second night due to availability, she made the sure the room transition was smooth. Room 2 has foam pillows! I enjoyed my stay at this place the location was perfect I was able to go for a run at volunteer park and run back for a cup of coffee.   It was a great stay overall and I look forward to visiting again. "
841049,38945508,2015-07-19,34277298,Michele,Alexia is always available! Your first aim is to take care of her hosts! I hope to see her again
841049,39771686,2015-07-26,3867047,Brian,"Everything was as expected, and my stay here was quite comfortable. For a room in Capitol Hill, within walking distance to downtown, the price is great!"
841049,40024550,2015-07-27,6103682,Eric,"Staying at Alexia's near Volunteer Park was perfect for me. Easy to get to, in a great location near things to do and the park, and comfortable for a nice stay. I also enjoyed chatting with Alexia and the other guest during my time and she gave great restaurant recommendations. Hope to come back to Seattle and stay again!"
841049,40250889,2015-07-29,37840543,David,"The room was great, quiet, and had exactly what you need, no more, no less. It felt like sleeping at a friend's or relative's house; very comfortable. I slept much better here than any hotel. The location was also great."
841049,40468192,2015-07-31,2022125,Jimmy,"Alexia was very helpful and responsive ahead of my arrival. She gave me detailed directions to her place from the airport and looked up restaurants that opened late since I was getting in around 11pm. The house is clean and quiet and a short walk to Broadway, which has lots of restaurants and stores. During my stay Alexia even bought a new fan for my room to help keep it cool since it was uncharacteristically hot. Definitely a good choice for staying in Seattle."
841049,41102583,2015-08-04,21407173,Meimei,Alexia is a super nice host I have ever met so far. She always have me lot of information about where to go and eat... I definitely will stay her house again if I come back next time:-)
841049,42435882,2015-08-13,22433903,Atsushi,"Location is pretty nice in the quite residential area, but also very close to the bus stop from downtown, nice cafes and restaurants on Broadway and 15th Avenue.
Room is comfortable, there are enough space and nice bed.
On top of those Alexia was very kind, I had enjoyed the chat with her so much."
841049,42912809,2015-08-16,31722347,Anita,"Hi Alexia, thank you so much for everything you help during my stay.  I went to all the places you receommended and they are so awesome...by the way, your coffee is super good....I will miss you...

Love,
Anita"
841049,43267740,2015-08-18,7229511,Brooke,"Alexia was super nice and offered to help me get set up in my room right away, offered to help me navigate the city, and suggested fun places to check out. She was very clear on what the rules and expectations were for the house, and made sure it was understood. The room was a nice size and the bed was comfortable - I would definitely stay with Alexia again."
841049,43525746,2015-08-20,3843194,Patricia,"This was my second time staying at Alexia's gorgeous house and it was again great - she is super organized and communicative, the room is simple, comfortable and pristine, and the bathroom is bright, lovely and clean. The location is unbeatable too - 2 minute walk to the 'good' end of Broadway with all its shops and restaurants, and about 20-30 minutes' walk to downtown. It's across the street from an elementary school so it is absolutely silent at night despite the proximity to Broadway. A wonderful place to stay if you like a semi-urban yet peaceful location, a huge lovely old home and meeting other guests!"
841049,43961261,2015-08-23,16886819,Toni,"Very clean, comfortable room and bathroom. Convenient location with dozens of restaurants and shops nearby. Easy access to downtown bus. I highly recommend Alexia's place. I plan to return."
841049,44920482,2015-08-30,34506476,Taeho,"This was my first time using Airbnb, and I hadn't traveled alone in a long time. In my 7 days of stay Alexia had made sure the experience was pleasant. The room was clean, the neighborhood was quiet, and so many places were in walking distance, not to mention the friendly & accessible public transport system. Her description may seem to include lots of rules, but all of them are perfectly reasonable, and does little to hinder the experience. When first I got there I hadn't made much plans besides going to pax dev & prime,  but her suggestions and tips were more than enough to find stuff to do&eat. Next time I visit Seattle I'd definitely consider her Airbnb again."
841049,45351271,2015-09-01,42731729,Kai,"Overall, staying at Alexia's place is a pleasant experience. She is warmhearted and always ready to help."

841049,45797612,2015-09-06,6312905,Emily,"This was a great experience - Alexia is a very welcoming hostess!  The room and shared bathroom were very clean and comfortable.  The location can not be beat for accessibility to Capital Hill, Seattle downtown, or anywhere you want to go really.  If you don't know where you want to go or the best way to get somewhere, Alexia is very knowledgeable and happy to make recommendations.  I would definitely stay with Alexia again."
841049,46203931,2015-09-08,13092650,Victoria,"I had a lovely stay with Alexa! Although it was only one night, her home was bright and clean and ideally located. She was very helpful with offering maps and other information. The room was clean, spacious and well stocked with anything you need."
841049,46626346,2015-09-12,14753277,Fei,"Alexia is the warmest host ever. Bathroom is always spotless, countless maps and tourist info ready to be used and she makes incredible pour over coffee every morning base on guest's preference! She even gave me a short tour to the Fremont area! It's been a wonderful stay and its indeed my pleasure to have met Alexia. :)"
841049,47389745,2015-09-18,923776,Kathy,This is the second time I've stayed here so definitely recommend. Alexia is extremely helpful and friendly. 
841049,47698297,2015-09-21,24125041,Jose,Alexia was an excellent hostess. The room was exactly how it was described in the listing. It was very clean and bright. The location was perfect and the house was very cute and the neighborhood was quiet and very safe. I cannot wait to come back to Seattle and staying in the Volunteer Park Room 2. Thanks.
841049,48450146,2015-09-26,2881715,Lydia,"Thank you Alexia for sharing your home, it was an easy experience and I felt very comfortable there."

841049,48855156,2015-09-28,20360072,Kelly,It's always a pleasure to stay with Alexia! She is one of the most hospitable people I know. Prime location and cleanliness on point! 
841049,49063395,2015-09-30,15878947,Conor,"The room was very clean and had everything I need in the short time I stayed in Seattle. Alexia has clearly been doing this for a while as she has some great systems in place to make things easy for her guests; example: beads on the door to show that you're out for the day. The neighborhood was nice and fairly close to some good restaurants, bars and shops. Also a great park about 2 blocks away."
841049,49397817,2015-10-03,19667643,Maria,"My brief stay at Alexia's was a pleasant one. She maintains a clean and comfortable home. Her place is close enough to the many culinary highlights of Capitol Hill, but a far enough that you get to have a good night's sleep. Alexia was a wonderful and very helpful host. I would stay here again."
841049,49808923,2015-10-06,40081147,川Rochelle,"This is a great experience, my first impression of Alexia was she was a serious guy, but in fact she was a very considerate person, she not only gave me a warm recommendation of the surrounding excellent tourist attractions, but also very intimate tips I should pay attention to the short trip.
She also shared her experience with me, and encouraged me to go to the world to get more experience, thank you very much Alexia!
When I left Alexia sent me, and helped me get my baggage down from upstairs, I am very grateful!"
841049,50704812,2015-10-13,45511380,Yongxu,The house is good and quiet. The host is very     kind.
841049,51509964,2015-10-20,46644743,John,"This space is in a great location which is outside the center of the city, but close enough to access. Alexia is a somewhat eccentric host, but very nice and is clear about expectations. Street parking is available plus a single private spot that we were able to use. Nice little place if you're looking for a relatively inexpensive room in Seattle. "
841049,52270101,2015-10-27,8571772,Ashraf,Alexia was friendly and accommodating. The room and bathroom were spotless with additional amenities available if you need them. Location is central and within walking distance of many great restaurants and bars. Highly recommended!
841049,52539461,2015-10-30,6078081,Heather,"I stayed with Alexia one night while attending a conference at St. Mark's Cathedral and was very pleased. If I returned to Seattle and needed to stay in the Capital Hill area I would definitely return. The location was easy to find off I-5 and was close to the cathedral and Volunteer Park, which was an added bonus. The room was clean and comfortable and for being in the city, was surprisingly quiet. Alexia was there when I arrived and followed through on all communications in a timely manner. Thanks!"
841049,52921388,2015-11-02,4869555,Carlos,"Good description, good location, confortable home !"
841049,53393321,2015-11-08,17871366,Matthew,"Alexia was very helpful in letting me know what were the places that I should visit in Seattle and also about the nearby food and grocery places in capitol hill. The room was perfect. It was spacious and pretty much spotless. The bathroom was the same. Location was good, a short walk would take you a bus stop which had a bus which would take you downtown to pike place market in about 10-15 mins. Very convenient. "
841049,54095892,2015-11-16,4182685,Jeff,Alexia was a great host! She was easy to communicate with and has a great house. I highly recommend her listing to anyone wanting to stay in one of the best areas in Seattle.
841049,54673066,2015-11-22,10234216,Samantha,"Alexia's home is just as advertised, if not better! The room was clean, spacious, and well appointed, the bathroom was modern and immaculate, and Alexia was a kind and gracious host, often offering tea, coffee, or wine. Her two rooms are in an amazing location and are a bargain for Capitol Hill!"
841049,55968996,2015-12-07,1740834,Tierney,"Alexia was organized, easy to communicate with and very accommodating! The house is in a great neighborhood - walkable to many parks, bars, and restaurants. I found the room to be comfortable, clean and with all the amenities I might need! Would definitely stay with Alexia again! "
841049,56575001,2015-12-14,27444342,Chris,"It was a positive experience -- very straight-forward. The house is super close to QFC, and everything on cap hill is within walking distance.
The room is exactly as shown.
I especially liked the little things -- like dispensable soap in the shower. There was also a cellphone charger in the cabinet above the desk, which was perfect for me, because I completely forgot mine at home."
6118291,31086911,2015-05-01,8520509,Phil,"The Chapins are some of my favorite people ever. I’m so excited they’ve started being AirBNB hosts; in part so I can spend more time with them on business trips and mostly because it means more people will be exposed to how great they are. The place itself is recently remodeled, in my favorite part of Seattle, and near some of the best places to eat and drink in the city. The neighborhood is quiet and safe, and although parking can be a bit annoying Seattle is a very friendly city to be in without a car (ample carshare programs, bike lanes, and mass transit). That said, I rented a car and had no trouble at all.

I’d recommend a few great drinking spots (The Lookout, for instance), but Hannah will do a much more thorough, polite, and useful job than I will. The hosts are wonderful, and a great perk is the bedrooms have been renovated with AirBNB in mind - little touches like a towel rack in the bedroom make a big difference. I’m not sure if the listing calls it out, but note there are two different rooms available, so if you’re traveling in a party of 2 couples (or have children in tow) it’s easy to do.

I can’t wait to be back!"
6118291,32440871,2015-05-17,6825142,Kate,"Hannah's place was great! Very cute house in a great neighbourhood. Walking distance to many restaurants and shops. About a 5-10 min drive to the downtown area. Older home has been renovated and is very cozy and charming, and it's on a beautiful street. Hannah was very friendly and accommodating, and responded quickly to all my questions. The bedroom was a good size- quiet, comfortable, nice view of trees and a courtyard. The bed was a tempurpedic (foam) mattress and was very comfortable. There was even some chocolate on my pillow! Would definitely recommend to friends. "
6118291,33539883,2015-05-29,33545245,Rosie,"Hannah and Bec were fantastic hosts. Arriving in Seattle for the first time, we were given clear and concise instructions and information which we needed to instantly feel settled. An incredibly detailed information pack was waiting for us in our room which came in handy when exploring the city or looking for a bite to eat. I would definitely stay in this beautiful home again, which is located in an equally beautiful town. Thank you so much for opening it up to us! Couldn't recommend this more highly!! "
6118291,34044293,2015-06-03,28875061,Clement,"Très chouette petite maison dans un quartier très sympa et très vivant. Le centre ville est largement accessible à pied donc pour de chute parfait pour quelques jours à Seattle. La maison ne manque de rien, l'accueil est très soigné et tout est fait pour que l'on se sente a l'aise et en toute simplicité. A recommander vivement !"
6118291,34329770,2015-06-07,22544501,Barton,"This was only my second experience with ABB and it was fantastic. Hannah was the kindest host, and really made me feel welcome and at home. Lovely house, with a front porch that was beyond perfect for retreat into a book. Their location is perfect too, just off the beaten path in a quiet area, yet walking distance to anything you'd like to do in Cap Hill. Loved it, and plan on returning in the future. Thanks, Hannah!"
6118291,34833271,2015-06-12,33941417,Julia,I would highly recommend staying here! The hosts are fantastic and will provide you with a detailed list of activities to do while in Seattle. Not to mention that the room is lovely and that they are incredibly kind and sweet. I would totally stay here again! 
6118291,34927133,2015-06-13,35382,Christiana,"Great night in Hannah's beautiful Capitol Hill home. Everything was so easy, from the coded door lock to off street parking in the driveway. It was great to speak with Hannah and Beck in the morning before we left. So friendly and even gave us some Orcas Island tips (our destination). 100% recommend!"
6118291,35054286,2015-06-14,1555749,Edward,Hannah and Bec were outstanding hosts. Their house is beautifully maintained and in an excellent location. I couldn't recommend this listing more highly.

6118291,36437424,2015-06-28,35396937,Janet,"We had a terrific time in Seattle at Hannah's place. The home was in a great location on Capital Hill, it was clean and had everything we needed. Our room had a lovely view of a wooded garden and we enjoyed the front porch with friends. Hannah responded quickly to my questions and was very helpful and accommodating. I would highly recommend staying at the Woodland Room in Seattle. "
6118291,36919537,2015-07-02,34516995,Kenny,"We were so happy to have Hannah and Bec host us while we were up in Seattle. Their house was beautiful, and their hospitality far beyond what we expected. The house is in a perfect location for you to set out on foot and find the fun and trendy local bars, restaurants, and activities Capitol Hill has to offer, especially if you are looking for a LGBT friendly places.  

Hannah and Bec were both fun and accommodating, and we couldn't have been happier with our stay. "
6118291,37049834,2015-07-04,32019560,Barbara,"hannahs host was great! her lovely room in her big, clean house was very comfortable! we didn't see each other a lot because we got around a lot. capitol hill is a nice livingarea. we would stay there again!"
6118291,37478994,2015-07-07,15103187,Brianna,"The picture perfect Airbnb experience. Hannah and Bec were lovely and made us feel very at home--getting to know them was a highlight of our trip. We spent our first night enjoying their company and porch swing, secretly wishing that they were our real-life neighbors. After discussing our plan to head to the beach, we woke up to towels and sunscreen awaiting our day. Their house is beautiful and the location is perfect--tons of interesting shops/bars/restaurants are very walkable. They provided sightseeing itineraries in our room, but those were outdone by the custom one they created for us after we got to know them. Looking forward to staying with them again in the future!"
6118291,37703791,2015-07-09,10970376,Benjamin,"My girlfriend and I were visiting Seattle for the first time and all I knew what that Frasier lived here and so did Kurt Cobain, oh yeah and the Seahawks are awesome!  

Even before we arrive our communication with Hannah and Bec was great. They gave us recommendations based on our interests and were very prompt in responding to our messages.  

Their home was so welcoming when we arrived in the beautiful and fun neighborhood of Capitol Hill.  The room was very spacious with a very comfortable bed and plenty of space for our belongings. The kitchen was amazing and we were able to share ample space in the fridge.  

On our first of two nights we were invited to join their wine and cheese party on the front deck with their friends. We enjoyed some pleasant conversation and then headed off with some cool recommendations for our first evening. Including the last bar that Kurt Cobain was seen in public, Linda's Tavern (He was sitting at the booth at the top of the stairs, FYI!)  We also saw an interesting sport, bicycle polo!  The neighborhood was awesome overall with restaurants and bars.  

Our stay in Seattle was great in large part to our hosts Hannah and Bec!  Would definitely recommend to anybody visiting Seattle. "
6118291,38011844,2015-07-12,34062349,Bill,"The woodland room is as described and pictured.  The bed is not large but worked for us.  The house is very conveniently located on the north edge of the Capital Hill commercial/restaurant/bar district.  Parking was easier than I first suspected and we found street parking about a block away.  Beware of the posted areas with 4 hour limits.  Everything was clean and in good working order and the price was right.

Hannah was off riding the STP so we didn't get to meet her but she was responsive (I failed to read the instruction booklet and wanted a wifi connection) on texting even from her bike trip.  In and out was easy using the keypad but had to remember to deadbolt the door manually after entering numbers."
6118291,38514742,2015-07-16,19874531,Steve,"Hannah and Bec were very welcoming. Their description is/was very accurate. Neighborhood up scale w/ lots of greenery. Parking can be difficult to find, be persistent.

Hannah and Bec's place is perfectly located- a $9 cab ride from the Westlake stop downtown, and within walking distance to plenty of excellent restaurants, bars, and coffee places. The bed was super comfy and they provided lots of info to make our stay as easy as possible. Would definitely recommend!"
6118291,42572854,2015-08-14,37948075,Stacie,"Tom and I felt very welcomed by Hannah and her wife, Beca. We arrived late afternoon and they gave us great options for a late dinner."

They consistently checked in with us to make sure we had everything we needed. The neighborhood was safe and fun, and the house was within easy walking distance of coffee, restaurants, bars, and groceries. Would highly recommend staying with Hannah and Bec. "
6118291,43654043,2015-08-21,27036010,Alexis,Hannah and Bec were excellent hosts. They welcomed us as if we were old friends and invited us to join them with their friends during our stay. The bedroom was spacious and cozy and the entire house was clean. The house is walking distance from a bunch of great places to hang out and actually not far from downtown. We would definitely recommend. 
6118291,44331437,2015-08-25,22024644,Eric,"Great staying with Bec and Hannah. Very nice people, and awesome place; very accomodating."
6118291,44582763,2015-08-27,2796087,Kyle,"Very welcoming and comfortable.  Excellent location, great neighborhood."
6118291,45107412,2015-08-31,17741172,Sandi,"Hannah was very flexible when I had to change my reservation and arrival time, and was kind enough to put my heavy bags upstairs into my room. 
The house is cozy and in a great neighborhood, and Hannah provided a list of wonderful restaurants, I was working, so I only got to try the coffee shop. 
Staying with Hannah (I didn't get to meet Bec) will be a lovely base for your Seattle trip. "
6118291,45589157,2015-09-04,40829325,Stephen,Hannah was a very gracious hostess for our very first AirBnB experience. Such a lovely home in a wonderful neighborhood with great coffee shops and restaurants nearby. The accommodations were wonderful and the entire trip a delight. That porch swing is fantastic!  Thanks for making our first AirBnB experience so wonderful!
6118291,45979267,2015-09-07,34679465,Min-Joo,"My mom and I visited Seattle for a girls weekend and we were so happy we got to stay with Hannah and Bec. Their house in Capitol Hill is so precious and allowed us to see different parts of Seattle that we would not have seen were we in downtown. There are a ton of great coffee shops and cute little stores a walking distance away, and an uber was always nearby to pick us up if we wanted to go explore different neighborhoods. 
Hannah and Bec have a lovely home, and though we didn't get the opportunity to spend too much time with them, they were both so friendly and welcoming! Getting in and out of the house was very easy and they even left us some recommendations which came in handy for us Seattle newbies. 
Overall, a fantastic stay and would highly recommend this airbnb if you are ever in Seattle!"
6118291,46524370,2015-09-11,42123170,Arne,"It was a wonderful stay at Hannah&Becky's house, perfect location to explore Capitol Hill and all of Seattle off the beaten tracks. I appreciated the very uncomplicated way of staying at your place!"
6118291,47683810,2015-09-21,22265774,Marisa,"This was are first experience using AB&B and Hannah and Bec definitely sold the experience. They kept us updated on what we needed to do for check-in, we walked up to our room and they had all the information we needed for our stay and having a good experience in Seattle. Our passing interactions were great. They are both so nice and we hope we can stay here again in the future, because we are definitely planning on going back. "
6118291,48053248,2015-09-22,41271191,Ziv,"I had a very pleasant stay at Bec and Hannah's. They were very welcoming, and made me feel at home.

The house is located on a quiet street in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, which is very conveniently located close to a number of attractions, restaurants and Lake Union.

The accommodation was very nice with a roomy bedroom and a super comfortable bed.

I would gladly stay there again."
6118291,49012095,2015-09-30,3227017,Anna,We had a fantastic stay at Hannah's beautiful home in Seattle. The room was spacious and comfortable and Hannah supplied everything we might need - from toothpaste to earplugs! The rest of the house was lovely and Hannah was very welcoming and friendly. The location in Capitol Hill was perfect - close to bars and cafes and very convenient for downtown. We would definitely stay with Hannah again and highly recommend her place if you're looking to stay in Seattle. 
6118291,49543945,2015-10-04,1798178,Heather,"
Hannah & Bec were wonderful! With two such experienced and thoughtful hosts, communication was easy and timely, directions for getting in and situated were clear, and recommendations for around the Capitol Hill neighborhood were spot on and much appreciated. Their home has been lovingly restored, is very clean and quiet, and is filled with everything I could have possibly needed...all thoughtfully organized and labeled with guests in mind. The bed is one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in! The location can't be beat...right in the heart of a vibrant, but still peaceful residential neighborhood, a manageable walk to downtown and the waterfront, but still close to some beautiful and wild green spaces for exploring. My stay was the best possible local experience I could have imagined and I would happily recommend it and hope to return soon myself. Thank you!! "
6118291,50971530,2015-10-16,6077205,Sam,"We had a great stay with Hannah & Bec! The full house and room were exactly as advertised, and the bed was super comfortable. I only wish we had another night to enjoy the neighborhood. We were lucky enough to meet Hannah, even though we were arriving late and leaving early, and she was super warm and helpful. I would stay with them again in a heartbeat."
6118291,51197592,2015-10-18,27621600,Charles,"Hannah was a welcoming host. The house is huge century old Capitol Hill  original with lots of character. The room was nice and the full size bed was comfy. As with almost all of Seattle street parking is tough in this area too. Hannah allowed us to park in her driveway, but be aware. All in all very nice."
6118291,51738522,2015-10-24,44088664,Yates,Wonderful place to stay. Hosts are welcoming and everything is clean and well organized. Comfortable room in quiet neighborhood close to many things in Seattle. Being able to use the kitchen was also a major plus.
6118291,51996952,2015-10-25,8352114,Amanda,"I met only met Hannah, as I was staying very briefly for one night in the city. Their home was lovely, and the bed comfortable and perfectly cozy on a cold rainy night. The bathroom is shared with one other, larger Airbnb room - but I had no problems getting in, in the morning to shower. 

I really enjoyed walking around the neighborhood, as its just several blocks south of Volunteer park which is stunning. Just several blocks over from their house there is a clear view of the Space Needle as well. And for anyone who is a sucker for old craftsman, and tudor homes alike, the neighborhood is filled to the brim.  "
6118291,53269555,2015-11-07,3652438,Stephanie + Michael,"What a beautiful home! Hannah and Bec have outfitted their house with anything a guest might need. There is plenty of helpful signage on where to find everything, which is both convenient and makes their home feel especially welcoming to guests even when you are alone in the house. The location was great (walkable to Volunteer Park and close to shops and restaurants) and bed was super comfortable. "
6118291,53695084,2015-11-11,41650926,John,"Hannah and Bec's house was a great place to stay while I was in Seattle! They were friendly and welcoming, and the house was in a great location and very comfortable. Everything inside is labeled and they provided a helpful cheat sheet of the neighborhood. It only took about 15 minutes by bus to get downtown, but some days I just stayed in the area around the house since there were so many nice parks and coffee places nearby. They even let me keep my bags there after I officially checked out of the room since my flight back home wasn't until late at night. "
6118291,54526772,2015-11-21,47843497,Bruce,"Both Bec and Hannah were very personable and welcoming. They were easy going and informative regarding access to the entire house as well as activities around town. I found the location perfect for my purposes. Their home was both clean and well appointed with some amazing organizational touches that made operating in an unfamiliar environment very easy. These girls really walk the walk when it comes to living in a sustainable share community situation. From ""FakerTowels"" to separated trash and compost and right up to the high efficiency washer/dryer.  The shower water was hot, the bed was soft and comfy. The shared spaces were clean and easy to navigate. I would certainly recommend their home to my friends."
6118291,56065705,2015-12-08,18673977,Nagaraj,Hannah and Bec are great hosts and very warm and friendly!! I stayed at their place for the first week of my new job. They left me message the day before with a super intuitive keycode to get into their place. They keep the place very organized and left note cards everywhere to orient myself to all the available amenities. The bedroom was large with a closet space. Enjoyed my stay.
6118291,56351578,2015-12-12,5927336,Cole,"This place was awesome! Super welcoming, very nice place/neighborhood/everything. The piano has a lovely tone to it :D"
6118291,56403101,2015-12-13,30124374,Arnold,The house was amazing and Hanna and Bec were really sweet. Everything was so clean and ordered. Such a pleasant stay. 
6118291,57073146,2015-12-21,25177001,Mengyao,"The house is really a pretty one! And my room is also very lovely, decorated with many interesting stuff from Hannah & Bec's trip collections. I really appreciate those useful notes everywhere in the house, making it easy for me to find everything and find out how to use them. The house is located in a quite but convenient neighborhood. Lots of restaurants just within walking distance. Bus directly to downtown and tourist sites. I only met Hannah this time. She is so considerate and helpful! This is extremely important for a solo traveler like me. I will definately visit Seattle again, because there are still many things left to see in summer time. And I will try to book their popular house next time! "
1593991,14807155,2014-06-26,15580493,Mike,"Stan is an amazing storyteller and a seasoned host. I loved my time in Seattle, thanks a million Stan! Looking forward to future adventure in Seattle!"
1593991,15123218,2014-07-02,6714701,Bill,"The hosts - Stan and Carrie, made my 3-day stay totally enjoyable! They work downtown and were able to pick me up and drop me off at the light rail station which I took to/from the airport. They are very friendly and knowledgeable about Seattle. Stan will bend your ear with a poetic narrative of dozens of stories from a life well-lived. Carrie brews a mean cup of cowboy coffee! And Rocky, the Australian Healer, will give you all the love you can handle. Mind the gray dog hair (but he sleeps topside). The accommodations are what you'd expect from an aging sailboat - tight quarters, no TV and a toilet for #1 only. Hot showers and bathroom are right onshore. While Stan and Carrie would make any stay enjoyable (and they're right on the boat with you), the big bonus here is the VIEW! Amazing sunsets featuring rows of sailboats with the Puget Sound and Olympic Mountains forming the backdrop. The beach at Golden Gardens Park is a short walk. Plan your transportation if you don't want to rely on Stan chauffeuring you around. I believe there is a bus stop nearby (I didn't use it) and I also believe you could park your car or motorcycle at the marina. I rented a bike from Dutch Bicycle a few miles away. I thoroughly enjoyed my first trip to Seattle and I hope to see Stan and Carrie again! Thanks!"
1593991,15887263,2014-07-17,17718722,Waverly,"Stan and Carrie were very nice, friendly hosts. They greeted us warmly and always were able to provide advice about dining, events, and places to go. We enjoyed hearing Stan's stories about the history of the boat. Carrie was sweet and always offering various food to us (watermelon, fresh cherries). We stayed for 4 nights and really liked being in Ballard. The walk to Golden Gardens is very nice in the evening to watch the sunset...or simply enjoy from the boat! The Sunday Ballard Farmers Market is a must. "
1593991,16029808,2014-07-20,17476873,Taylor,"Stan and Carrie were great, very sweet. They picked me up from the bus stop and when it came time to go to the airport, they gladly dropped me off at the Light Rail station. The boat is cute and exactly what you expect a sailboat to be, ha! It's a short distance from the beach, which was great for sitting out and reading. It's about a 45 minute walk into Ballard proper, which I did each morning I was there. The room is small but I found it cozy. The only thing is that I do wish the mattress were a little thicker--I found my hip hurting a couple of mornings after sleeping on my side. Rocky, the dog, is very sweet and will greet you immediately. Do know that he lives on the upper deck and, being so popular with the neighbors, he will run around quite a bit in the space right above your room as he greets passersby. On my last morning, Carrie made breakfast and I got to meet a friend of theirs who told stories about escaping Haiti, so while I did not have the pirate tales that others have mentioned, these were great and very inspiring. Overall I had a great stay!!"
1593991,17002106,2014-08-05,11063541,Jeremie,"I stayed on Carrie's and Stan's boat for three days and I must say it was the best part of my whole trip. Very nice, considerate, accommodating and generous hosts. I feel a bit bad for not spending more time with them, but there was so much to see and do. Awesome people, awesome boat, awesome dog. If I'm going back to Seattle in the near future, I'd try my best to stay with them. Highly recommend."
1593991,17137183,2014-08-07,19313725,Amanda,"Stan and Carrie are amazing people...kind, respectful, down to earth and very inspiring.  They have done amazing things to help make the world a better place. Ask them!

Stan and Carrie had made our trip something we never expected by really being generous when they saw they could help us out in anyway,  giving us a ride to downtown  when they could, and being so interesting and easy to talk to. Their dog, Rocky is one of  the sweetest and most cuddle friendly dogs you will meet. 

 There are cafes and two of Seattle's best seafood restaurants are right next door. There is also a beach within bike riding distance and a beautiful view of the Olympic Mountains. 

I felt like I was staying with family and not with someone I had never met before.  I will definitely stay with them again.

"
1593991,17382278,2014-08-11,18662017,Amy,Stan and Carrie were wonderful to stay with. They were very friendly and attentive to our needs. They gave us advice on activities and restaurants and know the area really well. Staying on the sailboat is an experience I wont forget. The view is gorgeous and is within walking distance to a nice beach and some great seafood. The location is a cab ride away from Ballard or DT Seattle activities as well. 
1593991,17477348,2014-08-12,19304557,Deanna,"My overnight stay on Stan and Carrie's sailboat was exactly what I needed. Quaint, quiet and lovely.  I would most definitely return. "
1593991,17602768,2014-08-14,409802,Jeremy,Lovely experience on this beautiful boat! Stan and Carrie are great hosts who truly make you feel like home. Thank you for having us.
1593991,17776027,2014-08-17,4461743,Erick,"Staying with Stan and Kerry was one of the best parts of our trip. After some tiring journeys and rough accommodations, it's was warning to meet a great couple like these two to bring us from the light rail to boat at the marina. Their custom pour over coffee greeted us in the morning. Their bikes let us explore Ballard. Their warm company in the evening relaxed us into gentle Puget sound waves on the boat. Rocky was also a great boat mate. We look forward to seeing you again, Stan and Kerry. Lindsey came upon a quote on our way home, which we felt reflected some of the great work you do:  If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea. - Antoine de Saint.

Thank you very much for your hospitality!"
1593991,19041986,2014-09-05,3836055,Behrad,"Stan and his wife are incredible people with very large hearts.  Staying with them was a heart-warming and enjoyable experience.  If you have the opportunity to stay on their boat, definitely make sure you check out the Golden Gardens Park just a few minutes further up.  You won't be disappointed! "
1593991,19177168,2014-09-07,20669147,Ted,Stan is a fun and gracious host. He accommodated our every need and even drove us to Seattle to Pike Place market. His boat is awesome.
1593991,19254853,2014-09-08,11913265,Sara,"The night before heading to Seattle my boyfriend and I spotted a listing of a shared stay with the owners on their Sailboat. We thought, why not! 

Carrie, Stan, and rocky (can't forget this friendly pup) were flexible with our arrival as our arrival estimate was delayed throughout the day. We arrived and they set us up with wine and food, and quickly took off providing us with full privacy, although they were very sweet and intellectual,  we wanted more conversation :)

We enjoyed their wine as we watched the sunset from the deck of their boat. After, we hopped in a quick cab ride to Ballard, which was such a fun area. Friendly locals, beautiful cocktail bars and great food throughout the neighborhood. We arrived back pretty late, and it felt as if Carrie and Stan were not even there. 

We had a comfortable sleep and they whipped up coffee and bagels for us in the morning (spoiled). 

For this hospitality, atmosphere, and price you cannot beat this stay! Had such a great experience. "
1593991,19301180,2014-09-09,1605611,Jerry,"Staying with Stan and Carrie was a timely reminder of why Airbnb is so compelling. They were personal, informative and utterly charming.
My only regret was that i didn't arrive earlier and make it out to sea with them. Wonderful folk."
1593991,19561455,2014-09-14,5166799,Anna,"It's hard to leave a review for Stan and Carrie, (and Rocky and Trade winds)!  Everything I would want to say sounds too over-the-top, but honestly, they are just that wonderful.  If there is any drawback it's that I completely lost any interest in actually seeing Seattle, I preferred hanging out on the boat and getting to know these amazing people.  Stan and Carrie are not on the boat during the day, so I had some quiet time to read and drink coffee in the sun as well. I will visit again and again, that's for sure."
1593991,20067583,2014-09-22,1728510,Diane,"Stan and Carrie were extremely responsive! We loved the stay and had an amazing time. They gave us awesome suggestions for restaurants and bars. In addition, we all had a terrific time having wine on the deck of the boat. Rocky, their dog, was the most adorable puppy ever and I could no stop hugging and wrestling with it. The room was so fun and unique. The hosts were also very accommodating (especially when we stumbled in late at night)
"
1593991,20525861,2014-09-30,20558285,Vicki,"Stan and Carrie are wonderful hosts; they were available if needed, yet allowed us all the space necessary. Shilshole Marina is a lovely area of Ballard, close to all amenities.  We would definitely return for a visit & stay."
1593991,21367632,2014-10-15,17130676,Lindsay,"Well, as a 64 year old woman, traveling around the country, I don't know that I am an average airbnber...or if there is such a person.  What I do know is that my experiences have been above and beyond my (email hidden)d my last 5 days here in Seattle with Carrie and Stan have taken that one step higher! 
The thought of staying on a sailboat was very inviting; but their warmth and our connection kept me longer then expected.  They made me feel like one of the family, sharing meals and talking late into the night, covering many topics.  They are well traveled and truly happy individuals who share that happiness with no strings.
I feel I have made friends for life.
If you don't want that connection, they are also willing to give you that space...but I think you will find yourself drawn to them and you will come out richer for it!
Oh! And they were also very helpful suggesting sights and giving directions.  
And Rocky was a sweet heart,
I would definitely welcome Carrie and Stan to my home anytime and hope to return to theirs.
"
1593991,22420625,2014-11-05,3824431,Eric,"Carrie and Stan are the very definition of good people. They went above and beyond to make my stay as enjoyable as possible. The boat itself was very comfortable, cozy, and relaxing and just a short walk to the heart of Ballard.  A memorable experience for certain."
1593991,22625927,2014-11-10,23272589,Colline,"Carrie and Stan were wonderful hosts, and made us feel like friends of the family, not complete strangers. They were generous with their space and time, and sharing the small space went very well.  We really enjoyed hanging around the Ballard neighborhood.    Overall an awesome experience."
1593991,24253449,2014-12-23,20168047,Dale,"Stan and Carrie are the best hosts ever. They are nice relaxed people who enjoy having guests, enjoy being hosts and warmly accommodate their guests' requirements while making them feel at home. The boat has a great living space and cozy, comfortable sleeping quarters with a skylight and private 1/2 bath. The boat, the dock and the marina are all places that are exciting to experience. The marina is next to a beautiful park and very near to restaurants, grocery and wonderful mainstreet shops"
1593991,33288445,2015-05-26,31792000,Ziad,"it is really hard to leave feedback on Stan and Carrie , they made me feel like am at home , i felt that i knew them since ages  , and it was hard to say  goodbye at the end of my stay .

it was my first time to stay in a boat and because of what i have experienced with Stan and Carrie  it will not be my last time hopefully :) .

the area is wonderful for having quite and nice vacation  .

as a person who travels a lot and works for one of the largest hotel industry worldwide i cant truthfully say  you made my vacation unforgettable , remarkable and i recommend every one to try and stay at your boat     .

thanks  a lot Stan and Carrie 

"
1593991,34183802,2015-06-05,30739423,Lauren,"Stan and Carrie were two of the most welcoming and friendly hosts I've ever had the pleasure of staying with!  They graciously took our request at the last minute, and immediately gave us their beach cruiser bikes to ride down to the beach and catch the sunset when we arrived.  They also let us take our time checking out the next day even tho they needed to head off to work.  This was our first time staying on a sailboat and it was truly a one of a kind experience and memory.  I would recommend this listing to anyone.  I am excited to keep in touch with these two to hear more of their awesome stories!  Until next time Stan and Carrie! (They also have the best dog - thanks for the stay Rocky!)"
1593991,34502838,2015-06-08,16350803,Jean,"Stan was an excellent host and made us feel right at home.  The boat was cozy and the views spectacular.  We so enjoyed being on the water. We were in town to attend a family party so we were dashing around.  It was nice to come ""home"" and sit on the sunny deck and chat with Stan and Carrie and their neighbors.  It was fun to get an insight into the  neighborhood of the Puget Sound docks and see the variety of boats there that people call home.  We finally did get to sit and have coffee (excellent!) with our host couple the morning we left and only wished we'd had a later flight and could have taken them up on their offer of an afternoon sail.  The free bikes were a bonus and we used them to pedal down to a nearby park for sunset one evening. Our hosts clearly relish their airbnb experiences and have great tales to tell about the wonderful, international guests they have hosted.  Ask about the cheese balls."
1593991,35004489,2015-06-14,34400413,Duane,"My son and I took a road trip from San Fran to Seattle where we stayed two nights with Stan, Carrie and Rocky.  What an amazing experience and adventure.  Bed's were very comfy and the boat is nice an cozy.  They were all so warm and welcoming and made sure we knew they were there to help us or give us space to do our own thing.  I loved hearing Stan's stories and adventures and Carrie was as sweet as you can get.  Rocky (dog) was our buddy.  There were plenty of things to do and plenty of options for dining.  

The last night we were there was magical.  Carrie had an old guitar that we pulled out and some neighbors walking by came on board and we all played music and sang until the sun set.  It was truly an unforgetable two nights that we will always cherish.  Thank you both.  We will be back!  Duane and Hayden!"
1593991,35488426,2015-06-19,26231629,Yueyu,"It would be a unforgettable experience to me and my friend. Stan and his partner are so nice to us and just like your old friend. They gave us a ride if they can and try to give us as much as suggestion about visiting Seattle us they can. Although the sailboat is kind of small,but it feels like home. Well,it is always hard to say goodbye,I will miss both of you. Best wishes:)"
1593991,36916343,2015-07-02,9285349,Stephen,Amazing location and a very unique place to stay. Hosts were very accommodating.
1593991,37333434,2015-07-06,34403445,Shuonan,Stan and Carrie are really nice couple. We stay there are 2 days. All good!
1593991,37716059,2015-07-09,37614337,Elizabeth,"This was great. The space was ideal , comfy cabin with privacy . Stan and Carrie were delightful hosts. I would definitely do this again. "
1593991,38146465,2015-07-13,20548711,Kong,"Stan and Carrie are most congenial hosts and extremely accommodating giving me private space and helping in buying some of groceries, reimbursed of course.  It was very helpful to be able to cook my breakfasts the very next three days without shopping. Stan and Carrie work during the week giving me private times to relax on the boat.  They have a friendly well adapted dog, who minds his own business and just became a daddy while I was there, according to Stan who went out with Carrie to see the puppies.  Had a great time living on the boat with the quiet nights, but sometimes, in the morning and afternoons noisy Courting Sea Gulls, Wow were they loud, but it's a nature thing, which I loved....Duck families were quietly cruising the lanes between the boats, took lots of pictures!  If it was up to me again, I would love to stay there again, but there are so many choices on AirBNB...I'd like to experience more places.
Thank you Stan and Carrie...You've been SUPER HOSTS!  I'd like to introduce to my Niece Jackie Chen-Oei and her Now husband Jacob Chen who live neaby on Cleveland Street.  Their Church is less than 15 minutes opposite Seaview on 81st street and 8th Ave, where the wedding Ceremony was held...I was the first guest to arrive, practically...LOL and got the first handicap parking space up front...that was also a great benefit I enjoyed at your place with the washroom and toilets behind the handicap car park.  All in All a 13+ out of 10...well recommendation! Stan and Carrie, if I can help you with choices of Tankless Water heater for your boat w/ LP tank (Propane) give me a call/email."
1593991,38559849,2015-07-16,38084962,5012scf,Epic. My experience was incredible with regards to the accommodations and the host(s). Stan is a great host and put any anxiety that I had (my first time staying on a boat) to rest immediately. Only a 5-10 minute walk to a beach in one direction and food and fun in the opposite direction. This would be my first choice in a place to stay if I'm ever back in Seattle!
1593991,38855911,2015-07-19,31552660,Jill,Stan and Carrie are super hosts. It was definitely a treat to be out on a boat with the peace and quiet. I would consider going on a boat again. 
1593991,39346747,2015-07-22,33080759,Srinivasulu,"It was a great experience to stay on the boat and also get connected to Stan and Carrie. They both are really nice and completely made me feel at home with very good conversation and pizza. 

It was first time experience for me to be on the boat and after a few initial minutes of don't-know-what-to-dos, it was fun. Its definitely a beautiful and peaceful location. 

I am definitely planning to get my family back there next year. 

Thank you Stan and Carrie. "
1593991,39584391,2015-07-24,3192103,Nik,Great place and great hosts.  Everything as advertised.  It's living on a boat so it's tight space but great.  
1593991,39706647,2015-07-25,34742305,Ryan,Stan was an amazing host and the sailboat is absolutely beautiful. We felt welcomed from the second we booked and feel that Stan's hospitality is unmatched. Would definitely stay again! 
1593991,39961144,2015-07-27,3020439,Paul,Stan was very welcoming. Boat was awesome. Marina very beautiful and quiet. Coffee shop one block away too.
1593991,40142658,2015-07-28,33107572,Jenny,"Stan and Carrie were really welcoming and friendly as was their sweet pup, Rocky. It was a pleasure to spend the night on their boat. "
1593991,40393914,2015-07-30,3948421,Susan,"Stan, Carrie and Rocky the dog welcomed us to their boat and offered us excellent home made soup and drink. The cabin is tiny but comfortable and we slept well for our 2 nights. It was all very well organised and the hosts gave us great suggestions for our visit to Seattle and Washington State.  We would have stayed on the boat longer but had to move on. We would happily stay there again. "
1593991,40490784,2015-07-31,6547916,Ron,Our overnight stay with Stan  on his boat was the highlight of my trip to Seattle. It felt like I stopped to visit with my brother.  You could travel far and wide and not run into finer people. 
1593991,40802308,2015-08-02,38371560,Susan,"We had a great time during our stay with Stan and Carrie.  They were wonderful hosts.  Upon arrival they showed us our sleeping quarters and the galley, gave us tips about things to do and provided beach cruisers to go up the beach to watch the sunset.  They were very considerate about giving us our space but their company was much enjoyable. In the morning, we were given access to their canoe to go out on the Sound which was a lovely experience.  "
1593991,41127055,2015-08-04,7709303,Daniel,"Great place to call home for a couple of days.  The weather was perfect to play on the water or run along the endless running paths. 
  We enjoyed a bottle of wine and chocolate on the deck while enjoying the sun, and Rocky, the friendly ""guard dog"".
  Parking was free, but hard to find when we first arrived.  A better location would be lat/long (phone number hidden) Plug that into Google maps and you'll be right at the right dock ramp.
  Stan provided towels for the nearby showers. They were close and always open. Be sure to bring quarters to feed the showers.
  We planned to take a leisurely bike ride but ran out of time. There are plenty of areas to explore and lots of pubs and restaurants a mile away.  
  Overall, a nice, quiet place out of the craziness of downtown with friendly accommodating hosts."

1593991,49764802,2015-10-06,35715734,Christoph,"Wir haben und bei Stan und Carrie rundrum wohl gefühlt. Airbnb mag vielleicht auf einem Segelboot ein wenig ungewöhnlich sein, aber obwohl es natürlich etwas enger als in einer Wohnung war, hat uns nichts gestört. Im Gegenteil. die vordere Kabine, die wir hatten, war kuschelig und gemütlich. Wir wurden herzlich aufgenommen mit wunderbarem Frühstück und Kaffe/Tee am Bett versorgt. Am Sonntag kamen wir von einem Auflug in die Stadt zurück und fanden Leckereien und frisch gemachten Salat vor, ohne dass wir damit gerechnet hätten. Also nochmals herzlichen Dank an Stan und Carrie für die schöne Zeit und die netten Gespräche in Seattle. "
1709737,8142527,2013-10-17,6204194,Alan,"I attended a conference at the Washington State convention center Seattle and had a last minute cancellation by another airbnb place. I booked Riani's apartment and had an amazing stay. She was an excellent host, going out of her way to buy breakfast foods including special goodies for my dietary-restricted buddy. I felt right at home in her apartment, which was just plain cool--from the original hardwood floors, to the wainscoting, to the vintage bathtub, as well as the interesting personal effects from a well-traveled life. This is a home that you want to lounge around on a Sunday. The area itself is downtown and next to a public hospital. Probably would not walk there at night, but I felt fine walking to the conference each day, which took about 15 minutes each way. We also ubered around town for about $6 per trip. Overall, highly recommend, I would stay there again in a heartbeat. "
1709737,8906541,2013-11-25,9701694,David And Nicola,Riani and her place in Seattle were great. The flat comfortably accommodated six of us and it was nice being so close to everything. 
1709737,9413524,2013-12-27,6659869,Keri,My family came to visit for Christmas so we rented out Riani's place.  It was clean and beautiful as expected. She even left us a Christmas tree! I had a few extra questions and needed to get ahold of her and she responded promptly whenever I needed anything ON CHRISTMAS!  She was awesome. I would recommend her to anyone coming to visit: especially if they have a well behaved furry friend like I did: my dog was welcomed with a bowl of water . Thanks again !
1709737,11799836,2014-04-15,7728802,Coby,"My friends and I had a great stay at Riani's- was as described, v spacious, two bedroom apartment, two baths with large living and dining area. Great location on First Hill close to Capitol Hill's restaurants and fun neighborhood/nightlife. Easy check in and check out. Riani was v attentive via phone/texting. The parking pass is a huge convenience as well, we would stay here again."
1709737,12335265,2014-04-29,6763841,Bennett,"Riani was extremely helpful and communicative. The place was set up and ready for us when we got there and was easily left to be reset. Check in was a breeze and she even offered to come replenish towels if we needed. A quick 15 minute walk from the convention center made this perfect for me and my colleagues. 
"
1709737,14391526,2014-06-18,14014102,Kelley,Great apartment and location for our daughter's graduation from Seattle University! Walking distance to most everything we needed. It is a very spacious apartment which accommodated our large group for celebrating. Riani is a great host and easy to reach if needed. Our dog loved her place and loved borrowing her dogs toys (especially the alligator). A lot of good memories were made here! 
1709737,14678596,2014-06-24,12028038,Giovanna,"Riani’s Cosy Vintage Home on Capitol Hill is cozy, charming and comfortable. The house was great for 3 friends and within a 1.5 mile walk of everything we needed in Seattle- light rail stop, monorail, downtown tourist stops. We experienced some disappointing issues upon arrival: the apartment was not cleaned, there was not enough toilet paper and no instructions of how to get both hot and cold water out of the showers (luckily a member of our group knew to check the water shut-off valves at the wall). Riani was quick to respond to my email and explained this was the first occasion she had not turned over the apartment for guests, and was readily agreeable to compensate for the issues. Based on her responses and the great apartment, I would stay here again (with the assurance of a thorough cleaning)."
1709737,15630651,2014-07-13,15928376,Jeff,"Riani is very nice, her home is close to down town and shopping. If we were to stay in the Seattle area we would want to stay in her home.

Jeff, Danielle and guests."
1709737,15989947,2014-07-19,12009145,Brendon,Riani Townshend was prompt in answering any questions we had and was very accommodating to our arrivals as they were staggered through the first day.
1709737,16079029,2014-07-22,6485219,Gilda,"Nice cosy place, excellently situated near downtown Seattle within walking distance. We really enjoyed our stay at Riani's and she was a gracious host. "
1709737,16766946,2014-08-02,2742518,Anne-Laure,"Riani's place is extremely well located in Seattle and her place is very nice. Riani herself is a great host, communications were simple and easy.
Unlike any other airbnb places i have visited though, you can tell the place is inhabited. The trash had not been emptied. There was hair in the bedroom and the bathrooms. The fridge was packed with food. "
1709737,17211286,2014-08-09,2049462,Catherine,"We really felt at home in Riani's appartment, that is really cosy and so well vintage decorated ! The beds are so comfortable and the place is so quiet and very well located : close to the bus station, in a charming street with an organic grocery nearby. Highly recommended for a stay in Seattle."
1709737,18792533,2014-09-01,375977,Sean,The description of the apartment is accurate. Riani's place is a wonderful first floor apartment that is beautifully furnished. The photos don't do the justice the how comfortable it is to be there. The apartment instantly felt familiar. The location is perfect for walking downtown and the parking situation at the apartment was easy enough with two cars for 5 days though street parking can take a bit of patience. Riani was superb too. She gave clear instructions and overall was a very pleasant host.
1709737,19433479,2014-09-12,20697527,James,"Staying at Riani's Cosy Vintage Home, was my first Airbnb experience. And it did not disappoint. Usually, when I travel, domestically or internationally, I stay in expensive hotels in the middle of the city. This time I didn't and I am not sure that I will again. Coming back to Riani's apartment from a long day of meetings really felt like coming home. Warm, comfortable, charming and clean all with a super fast internet connection. Thank you Riani. I look forward to staying again. "
1709737,21227702,2014-10-13,16813510,Carey,Enjoyed our stay for 2 weeks at Riani's place and would very much recommend to our friends! X
1709737,23506229,2014-12-02,9285069,Elaine,"Riani made us feel very welcome. The apt was indeed cozy, and the beds very comfortable. All in all, It was as described. Having a parking place was really a great benefit. The location was central enough for our needs. We would return. Thank you."
1709737,28028441,2015-03-16,1472339,Krishna,Good neighborhood. Riani communicated clearly and was quite helpful.
1709737,28674538,2015-03-28,6992464,Alberto,"The description is very accurate: the house is very beautiful and very well situated. I insisted in renting despite the fact that she had little time to clean up after the previous guests, and because of that we found minor cleaning issues. But overall, a great experience, I would repeat."
1709737,29763631,2015-04-12,8947429,Jocelyn,"Me and my three other friends went to Seattle for our first time, and stayed at Riani's place. The location is perfect, everywhere we wanted to go are within 1,2 miles, and the place is just lovely, cozy, warm, and we felt like at home. Riani is always there to help you, giving great suggestions, and we had our own privacy the whole time too. Will definitely stay there again the next time!"
1709737,33687593,2015-05-31,31404179,Cristina,Riani was awesome. It was easy to communicate and get in touch with her. The place was just as described and beautiful. The area was nice and I was surprised I didn't hear more sirens at night since it was right next to the hospital. Would definately stay there again. 
1709737,39939622,2015-07-27,5387378,Jaime,"Riani was  a fantastic hostess.  She was VERY responsive with all my questions, usually responding within 15 minutes, which is amazing.  The place itself matches the pictures.  It's super cute and cozy, but with plenty of space.  I stayed there with my husband and son and we had more than enough room.  The on-site parking is truly a blessing in a neighborhood where street parking can be scarce.  Nice neighbors and lots of restaurants, cafes etc. in the area make this a great choice when visiting Seattle!"
1709737,40260269,2015-07-29,10082632,Jeremiah,"Riani has a wonderful home. Beautifully decorated, comfortable beds, and a great location. We'd definitely recommend to anyone wanting to stay in Seattle."
1709737,40915837,2015-08-03,14040123,Ilaria,"flat at walking distance to mid town, convenient for everything, also for the parking!
the flat is quite big but unfortunately too full of things... impossible to use space for our wardrobe and after a long trip... it is needed
Nevertheless Riani was helpful and nice"
1709737,41642031,2015-08-08,37945826,Jorge,"We stayed at Riani's apartment on the First Hill neighborhood of Seattle and found the location ideal. Her place is a first floor corner apartment. It's very spacious and tastefully and creatively appointed. Even though it is on a first floor and had the windows open there was hardly any noise.  The kitchen is fully equipped and functional though we only cooked breakfast while there.  The dining and living rooms are spacious, nicely decorated and great places to just hang around. There is no doubt that the next time we're in Seattle it will be at Riani's. "
8101251,47419456,2015-09-18,35040122,Brant,Great location with a beautiful view. This is the place to be if you are staying in Seattle! 
8101251,50203496,2015-10-10,11230629,Kenny,"This place was great. The common area on the 40th floor was awesome. Pool table, shuffleboard and the perfect view of the water. We were in town for a project at the convention center and it was more convenient than staying at one of the hotels and definitely a better value. 

The master bedroom was great. Large closet and bathroom. The second room was a bit smaller but overall the space was enough for the 4 of us. The gym was a definite bonus and the location was convenient. It's a short walk down to Pike's place and out the door there are numerous restaurants and bars. 

Would definitely stay there again. "
8101251,53368635,2015-11-08,3512746,Mitul,"We had a great stay at Premiere on Pine. The apartment is very conveniently located to the convention center and is very spacious and comfortable and clean. I interacted over the phone with Stay Alfred, the agency / company that is the host, and they were friendly and professional."
8101251,56683639,2015-12-16,47950195,Rafaela,"This condo is so amazing, not only because of its location, but also because of its wonderful view. By the way, the building offer us many services. We can enjoy our holiday and relax very much! I wish I could live there forever!!! "

8426749,51400137,2015-10-19,8198404,Lynn,"Conan's home was well furnished, clean, and cosy. We had a group of 5 stay for a retreat and everyone was happy with their space. The process of cleaning was straightforward. There was a lot of space for our cars to be parked. Conan was very quick at answering any questions we had and was transparent about the whole checking in/out process. Would stay here again and recommend to anyone!"

We were able to walk to restaurants, down into Pike Place Market, as well as the football stadium.  We were also pleasantly surprised that parking was relatively easy and available.  Jonathan was very responsive and flexible with our timings. We would definitely recommend Jonathan's place!"
6613601,53370446,2015-11-08,5340879,Milosz,"We highly recommend Jonathan's apartment. He welcomed us when we arrived. He also bought us a few bottles of water and juice which was nice.

It was a good surprise to learn the couch was a pull out! The kitchen was just right for us to cook a Thanksgiving dinner and the location was central to easily get around the city. 

Jonathan was fantastic to overnight us the keys so we could get into the apartment when we landed in Seattle late, which was above and beyond what I expected. I would definitely recommend staying here. "

4711069,25048946,2015-01-05,24897193,Christa,"Mayza was helpful and friendly.  Just know that this house is staged.  There aren't many extras.  Bring your own hair dryer, iron, etc.  There were thermostat issues and we froze every night with no extra blankets.  We got one after we asked. The views from the house were really beautiful though. "
4711069,26547130,2015-02-15,26715030,Sandy,It was an amazing experience the house is lovely. Mayza was very attentive.The only thing was the jets in the tub were not working properly. The beds were so comfortable. Make sure you bring your own ingredients in case you are going to cook. The view is breath taking. I hope to stay again when the opportunity comes.
4711069,28518198,2015-03-25,26698801,Raymond,View was fantastic and everything was in wonderful shape.  Entire family thought it was just great and would recommend this condo to everyone.  Listing was easy to accomplish and Mayza was great to work with.

In all, I will highly recommend the host and the house, if I have a chance to visit Seattle again, I will choose it again! "
4711069,32965036,2015-05-24,21536024,Scott,"No surprises here. The house was as advertised. Nobody lives in the house full time, so there weren't any common household items like hangers, but besides that the house was great. For those of you trying to figure out the layout of the house, the jacuzzi tub is located on the main floor. The bedrooms are upstairs and downstairs. "

4711069,38800398,2015-07-18,25308831,Mingting,It is really a fantastic palace to enjoy the sunset and spare time with your family. My mom said she love this palace everyday especially when she cooking and look the views through kitchens' window. And they even support a hub on first floor. It is very sweet for relax.
4711069,40037591,2015-07-27,8538042,Christian,"This is a very nice place. The view outside of the living room is fantastic. House is actually very big, much bigger than we thought since there are 3 floors, which we did not realize by looking at the photos.

The host was outside of town when we arrived, and he sent us all the details we need well beforehand."
4711069,40559342,2015-08-01,13881813,Suzi,"Vue extraordinaire sur Seattle et sur le lac Washington. Maison agréable, donné pour 10 mais 7 vrais couchages et des matelas gonflables pour les 3 autres..."
4711069,40752521,2015-08-02,17678024,Joel,We had an awesome time here! The view was fantastic and its location is pretty ideal. Will look for this listing in the future.
4711069,41315738,2015-08-07,10274772,Scott,"Unfortunately, the surprising Seattle heat really put a damper on our stay at this property. We were unable to sleep in the bedrooms upstairs d/t the temperatures, and with only one very loud industrial-strength fan available, we opted to have all of us sleep in the basement (1 bed and 2 air mattresses). We were aware of no air conditioning, however, what surprised us was that not all the windows had screens. Couple other small issues (no towel racks or hooks, no hand soap, no wash clothes), and with a few easy upgrades, this home would rate better. Located in a not so great area but definitely convenient to the Seattle area."
4711069,41372515,2015-08-07,35793204,Sophia,"Staying at Mayza's craftman house in Seattle was a perfect ending to our vacation!  The home was very clean, well stocked on all the supplies you need to a home away from home (towels, dishes, linens and etc.).  The house is in a quiet residential neighborhood.  The beautiful view from the back patio definitely was the highlight of our staying!  My family and I enjoyed the place. Mayza is a great host!  She's very responsive to my questions and made sure we are all set for our setting before our arrival.  Thank You for the wonderful experience, Mayza!"
4711069,41739096,2015-08-09,31866931,Jonathan,"Fantastic place. Clean, well kept, good location. Eza and Carlos were both super helpful and got back to me with everything quickly. I recommend it."
4711069,42132623,2015-08-11,34963214,Hongxiang,Mayza was such a responsive and responsible host. The house itself was also fantastic. Those spacious & tidy rooms with awesome views really highlighted our trip. The Nest thermostat installed is a plus.
4711069,43535003,2015-08-20,34260184,蓉儿,"House is very good, suitable for many people live"
4711069,43900574,2015-08-23,11559888,Jamaal,"We stayed at this house for a family reunion and it was perfect! Exactly what we needed. The pictures were accurate and the house was accommodating with air mattresses and plenty of towels. Mayza was also a great host, the process was seamless and we didn't have any issues checking in or checking out. Would recommend to a friend."
4711069,44870403,2015-08-29,41781535,William,Everything was perfect! The description was of the property was just perfect. It fit all our needs and was a very spacious property. Mayza replied for quickly and was very helpful! Would recommend 
4711069,45904025,2015-09-06,34693190,Ron,"Aside from a broken handle on the upstairs shower, the house was amazing (it was three floors, pictures make it out to be 2) and the views were well worth the drive down from downtown Seattle."
4711069,47302178,2015-09-17,15378241,Sheila,"Mayza's home was perfect, it was in the perfect location between the airport and downtown Seattle.  Everything in the home was spotless and the decor was beautiful, the view was gorgeous .  We were four people and all had our own bedrooms and could easily have had more people accommodated very comfortably The keypad made it easy to get in and out and communication was fast and easy.  Highly recommend this property!"
4711069,48357394,2015-09-25,19014389,Donald,"The views are every bit as good as described. Seattle is really beautiful when the sun is out and it definitely shined brightly for us. Mayza's house was perfiect for us to have a mini family reunion, assembling people from both coasts to attend a beautiful outdoor wedding.

The house has been recently updated, and it shows. We can recommend this property for any family or larger group."
4711069,48425410,2015-09-26,2102317,Feng,"Very good. The room is as beautiful as it is described. The neighborhood is actually very quite suburban, and feels quite safe."
4711069,49249887,2015-10-02,33081139,John,This listing was exactly as stated.  There was a magnificent view of Seattle and typifies a quintessential Seattle Home Experience.  The house was very spacious and the view from the upper rooms and outdoor patio differentiates this spot from others I've stayed at.  Mayza was very hospitable and made sure that we felt well-taken care of.  Highly recommended. 
4711069,49588994,2015-10-05,28478098,转圈,交通方便，房间都很新，不错，强烈推荐！
4711069,50977606,2015-10-16,28538799,Eleanor,"The house comes with a beautiful mountain view, and Mayza is a nice host, and she is easy to be contact with. Environment is pretty good. Will recommend!"
4711069,54575639,2015-11-22,34782361,Joyce,House was exactly as described. Beautiful view. Had a great time
4711069,56716078,2015-12-17,10653281,Matt,"This home is the perfect vacation rental in Seattle!  The home is very warm, comfortable, and has everything you need.  The views are exceptional.  The street parking is great.  The entrance of the house sits at the street which makes it super easy to bring your luggage in.  It has a great thermostat system.  All the stores are within 5-10 minutes away and easy to get to, and it's only 15 minutes from the airport.  I spoke with the host when I arrived and he was so nice and accommodating over the phone, which is so important.  We were a group of 4 adults and a baby.  I would definitely rent this home again on any future trips to Seattle and highly recommend it to others.  

Thank you to the host!  Staying in your home made our trip so enjoyable."
4711069,57204931,2015-12-23,18975843,Renee,"The home was immaculately clean, the view amazing and the host was very responsive. Great experience. Thank you!"
1118153,4605138,2013-05-14,6226571,Sara,Jasmine and Stephen were fantastic hosts! They went out of their way to make sure that we had everything we needed. Their home is in the perfect location for exploring Seattle- right in the middle of the awesome neighborhoods of Fremont and Wallingford which were my favorite places to be. The bus is also very convenient and is located just down the street to take you downtown. We were able to get everywhere we needed without any problems and really enjoyed staying ion the area. The accommodations were excellent and the room is super cute! I highly recommend staying here with these guys and hope to be back again soon!! 
1118153,4639986,2013-05-17,6202443,Leslie,"Jasmine and her husband were amazing. They were warm and welcoming, willing to talk and give us suggestions but also completely fine with letting us keep to ourselves and come and go as we pleased. My friend and I were traveling for quite a bit and seeing this nice room with all the necessary amenities was just great. Beautiful room with large windows that look out front. Would recommend this room to anyone. "
1118153,4985999,2013-06-05,3482200,Sarah,"It was a joy to stay with this family. the room is clean and there is a lot of consideration for privacy and comfort. its also a really cool house. If you want to be social in your traveling, Jasmine and Steven are definitely people you should get to know. They are incredibly interesting and kind. I would definitely stay with them again and look forward to being friends! "
1118153,5043393,2013-06-09,1666442,Julie,"Had a short trip with some friends up to Seattle and needed a place to stay. Jasmine and Steven were super accommodating and their place was really nice to stay at. They were also very helpful with suggestions on what to do and see in the area. Quiet neighborhood, but close to bus stops to get into downtown in ~15-20 min. Also there are a lot of cute stores and GOOD food super close by... I would definitely stay here again when I come back!"
1118153,5191280,2013-06-17,6661943,Lynne,"It was a very quiet, pleasant and respectful place to stay although we had to share a bathroom and there were facilities set in the hallway for making a simple and fast breakfast, I preferred just going to a great place within walking distance down the hill to the water's edge to the PCC Natural Market.  I happened to be there for their Sunday ""Flea"" market day every week.  Fremont was a most historic and interesting place as was the Sweet Room in Fremont/Wallingford.  It was a sweet ""old"" vintage home as was the whole neighborhood and the hosts were also very friendly and helpful.  Would love to revisit again.  Lynne
"
1118153,5399240,2013-06-28,6629558,Chaitanya,"This was the first time i used airbnb and our hosts Jasmine and Stephen were awesome. The place is super clean and got everything we needed for the stay and more. Jasmine and Stephen are very good warm hearted people and It was almost like staying at a friends place.

"
1118153,6276944,2013-08-06,3842754,Ally,Jasmine was a wonderful hostess and gave us some great advise for things to do in the area. This is a great neighborhood and a warm and welcoming room. I would definitely stay in her home again when in Seattle.
1118153,6546402,2013-08-16,7991423,Gilad,"I stayed for three days with Jasmine and Steven, both very friendly, and I got what I wanted - a comfortable, clean and quiet room. 
When I got into a jam and had to stay for another day, they arranged a special room for me to help me until I find a more permanent place. 
The house is on the border of fremont and wallingford, in the vicinity of buslines and shopping centers. 
In summary, I recommend!    "
1118153,6629974,2013-08-19,780027,Kyle,The room is a bit far from Seattle downtown but 4 blocks is bus 16 that takes you there easily. Room is nice pretty comfy bed quiet street. They rent out 3 rooms upstairs and there is only one bathroom so a little of a wait sometimes but it was still clean...besides that great. 
1118153,6702022,2013-08-21,8168055,Yitamar,"Jasmine and her husband, Stephen, are a really nice couple. They helped us with directions and attractions around the area with great pleasure (like the Fremont troll who's just a short walk away). The house itself is in a good location just a few blocks from a bus station downtown (about 15-20 minutes ride). The room is clean and comfy and the house is quiet with a good atmosphere. "
1118153,6737889,2013-08-23,7707599,Danielle,Jasmine was very welcoming and her place was super clean. I couldn't have asked for a better stay. I would highly recommend her!
1118153,6821645,2013-08-26,7898964,Heather,"This was our first time to Seattle and our first time using Airbnb, and I am confident and happy to say it won't be our last.  Jasmine's home is beautiful, and in a wonderful location.  We enjoyed a delicious breakfast within walking distance, thanks to Jasmine's recommendation.  Staying in this room felt like we had a home away from home, and if we headed back to Seattle I know we would stay here again :) "
1118153,6922679,2013-08-30,965636,William,"Loved staying at Jasmine Bay. Hosts were very mellow, easy going, warm and helpful. Basically very cool people. Simple room with view of street....slept well...nice harder type bed which was good for my back. Great location. Wonderful city. Highly recommend. "
1118153,7012744,2013-09-03,7498431,Nicole,Our first time with AirB&B was a delight. After this pleasant experience we will certainly try it again in the future. The house was nice and clean and our hosts were warm and hospitable. We will stay with them again for sure.
1118153,7208561,2013-09-10,4418827,Arun,"We had a pleasant stay at Jasmine & Steven`s over the weekend ..  Hosts were very mellow, easy going, warm and helpful. Simple room with view of street, centrally located close to the downtown .. Wonderful weather, awesome holiday .. Highly recommend."
1118153,7289444,2013-09-14,8690419,Hanna,I had great two days at Jasmine and Stephen's and they really made me feel welcome. The room is nice and clean and in a really nice neighborhood!
1118153,7422195,2013-09-19,8594687,Sara,"We had a great stay! The house is ""sweet"" (there are honey jars in the window) and the hosts were gracious. We stayed for 6 nights and it was lovely. Jasmine and Stephen recommended a delicious restaurant that is a 5 minute walk from their home, Tutta Bella. Very good! What a great introduction to Seattle! Thank you Jasmine and Stephen. "
1118153,7486586,2013-09-22,712776,Henry,"Equally, Steven and Jasmine very cordial hosts. If in Seattle, check them out! The Fremont are, brew pubs galore, many intriguing views, people, food."
1118153,7934523,2013-10-08,4489076,Paul,"You won't go wrong choosing this spot to stay.  While I didn't spend much time chatting with the hosts, they were both friendly and welcoming.  The room was wonderful, nicely furnished, and with a view of downtown Seattle out the corner window.  Location is nicely situated between, and within walking distance of, both Fremont and Wallingford."
1118153,8942227,2013-11-26,10200515,Sarah,"Hosts could not have been more thoughtful and accommodating. Friendly, warm and welcoming while allowing us privacy. Lots of thoughtful touches in the bedroom and bathroom, beautiful room with loads of natural light and the house is in a great, easy-to-get-to location. Can't go wrong here!"
1118153,9258638,2013-12-16,2767601,Ancilla,A wonderful stay!  The hosts were most accommodating and made sure I was comfortable.  I had a chance to walk around Fremont neighbourhood and had an opportunity to sample some of the restaurants in the area.  
1118153,9513540,2013-12-31,7117532,Pippi,"A beautiful house in a quiet, convenient spot!  Jasmine, Stephen, and their baby are great hosts and we were happy to meet them. "
1118153,9617685,2014-01-03,8438744,Haylee,"The location and view was amazing.  The hosts were so very nice and accommodating.  It was very easy to communicate with them and easy to check in and out.  The room was fine enough and it was so nice to have the little kitchenette outside the room.  The room is very quiet at night and faraway enough from the host that noise levels are low.  It was easy to come and go as we pleased. 

Overall a very great experience!  Thank you Steve and Jasmine! "
1118153,9981219,2014-01-22,7253162,Birsen,"What a nice family! I loved staying with Jasmine, Stephen and Baby Blaze. They are ""down to earth people"" and they made my stay in Seattle very easy.  I very much liked the little ""kitchen set up"" outside my room. Plenty practical foods to choose from and very nutritious, too.  My room was specious with a good desk and two chairs and a great bed to sleep in.  I stayed for three nights and felt very much at home. Thanks! I definitely would stay with them again. Their home is very central in every direction of the city and very easy parking!"
1118153,10065656,2014-01-28,4539897,Timothy,"I have lived in Seattle in the past and currently have family in the area whom I like to visit regularly. Jasmine Bay offered me an excellent location, reasonable rates,  free parking, and a wonderful host family that included the most charming little baby named Blaze. I came and went as I pleased and appreciated the free coffee and oatmeal in the morning,  which I prepared myself in the kitchenette. The neighborhood of north Fremont/Wallingford is totally walkable with many varied restaurants only a short distance away. Also the world class Woodland Park Zoo is only a few blocks. I will definitely stay here again on my next visit to (website hidden). If you are coming in winter,  bring a sweater."
1118153,10230530,2014-02-08,8916732,Benjamin,They were very flexible with the check-in time (we were coming in around midnight).  The location is great if you want to visit some of the artistic pieces around the Fremont area and if you want great food.  We had the most interaction with Stephen throughout the whole stay.  He was very accommodating and he gave advise on what to do and see in the area.  It was overall a great experience.
1118153,10591879,2014-02-26,6990239,Margaret,Jasmine and Stephen were awesome hosts. They gave us great advice about local restaurants and were exceptionally accommodating and welcoming. Their home is lovely and located in a choice neighborhood. I hope to stay with them again soon!
1118153,10852541,2014-03-10,3908127,Stefan,"We had a wonderful time staying at Jasmine and Stephen’s. Their house is in a quiet residential neighborhood just a few blocks from the happening center of Fremont, and with great views of downtown Seattle from the street. Our room was cozy and comfortable, with a convenient breakfast corner and fridge shared with the other room. We very much enjoyed getting to know Stephen and Jasmine and sharing stories about our travels."
1118153,11162346,2014-03-23,7468,Breck,Stephen and Jasmine were terrific hosts! Room was clean and comfortable and location was great. Thanks!
1118153,11333813,2014-03-30,12844523,Jeff,"Jasmine & Stephen made our stay very easy, everything was exactly as advertised. Couldn't have asked for more."
1118153,12464070,2014-05-03,8492819,Melissa,"Jasmine and Stephen were consummate hosts. Jasmine was incredibly sweet and supportive. I felt comfortable both asking for help and sneaking upstairs without stopping by for a chat. The room itself is beautiful. Large windows, tree just outside, great neighborhood...just perfect. "
1118153,12641281,2014-05-06,14809804,Jenny,"Everything was as expected. Jasmine was very responsive to questions about our stay and was flexible with our check-in time. Clean sheets, clean towels, awesome coffee/tea and breakfast bar, and a very spacious shower/tub and bathroom. We really enjoyed our stay here."
1118153,13159615,2014-05-20,13833738,Ilene,"Our stay was enjoyable.  The environment was quiet and peaceful.  The hosts left us with a refrigerator, and breakfast snacks, includung tea and coffee.  We felt that our stay was private, but if we needed anything , our hosts would respond immediately."
1118153,13493564,2014-05-28,9950582,Katherine,Thanks so much for your hospitality!! We loved our time.
1118153,13925673,2014-06-08,15581298,Luiz,"The house is in a good location, not too far from several bus stops. This 
is crucial in Seattle, as the bus system is really useful in getting 
around; it was really easy to go to the University of Washington and to 
downtown by bus from the house. It's located in a residential 
neighborhood, in a very quiet street, so there isn't a lot going on around, 
but at least it's not too far from a few restaurants. The room was huge 
and really well-lit, it was really nice. The 2 guest rooms were on the 
second floor, there was a bathroom set aside for the guests, and also a 
separate fridge and snacks on the hallway. The hosts slept in a room in a 
converted garage outside the house, so the guests have a lot of privacy, 
and we didn't feel like we were imposing on anyone with talking, music or 
tv. The main house area (living room and dining room) were somewhat messy 
(probably because they just had a baby), but since guests weren't meant to 
use the space, it didn't matter. Also, to reiterate, the hosts slept with 
the baby in the back room, so there was no baby crying in the house in the 
morning ;)"
1118153,14792213,2014-06-26,15220210,怡文,"Jasmine and Stephen are very kind couple. The room they provided for us is well-equipped. And they also provided water, biscuit, and oat for the guest. The neighborhood there is very safe and peaceful...only takes 10 minutes to the bus stop toward downtown on foot."
1118153,15590521,2014-07-12,154890,Laura,Jasmine's place is an older historic home that was nice to stay in. We woke up to beautiful sunshine pouring in the windows each morning. The house is a bit creaky (especially when you're trying to be quiet!) and door handles take some getting used to. Lovely place to stay.
1118153,15780382,2014-07-15,272913,Erika  & Dave,"A comfortable room in a pleasant neighborhood.  Plenty of snacks provided, fan worked well on a very hot weekend. Good value, would stay again."
1118153,16994534,2014-08-05,8591317,Juls,"Clean space with comfy bed and great natural light.  Convenient kitchenette right outside the door.  Would stay there again and would also recommend to others.  Nothing fancy, but quite nice and in a good location."
1118153,17125346,2014-08-07,9472477,Alice,"Our hosts were very friendly and welcoming, we had a nice stay. The room was large and the kitchenette facilities outside the room were handy. No noise at all at night or in the early morning, nice quiet neighbourhood, handy location, easy to get downtown."
1118153,17238826,2014-08-09,18595631,Henry,Great place... Hippy family that is very welcoming
1118153,17441174,2014-08-12,13443581,Tessa & David,"We enjoyed our stay at Jasmins were we felt at home. She welcomed us with a hospitality and relaxedness that was perfect after a long trip. It is a nice, clean and basic room in a quiet residential area of Seattle. Perfect retreat after visiting downtown. A 5 minute walk to a busstop makes it easy to get around."
1118153,17622006,2014-08-15,13571232,Susan,"Jasmine made sure that I could get into the place even though I had a change in schedule, and that there was someone to show me where things were at and remind me of some of the essential house rules. 
The place was pretty quiet, clean and comfortable. The only thing that was hard for me as a light sleeper with jetlag was that the windows only had sheers and not dark curtains, but I managed with my sleep mask. And no bug screens on the windows, so my last night the skeeters were a tad bothersome. (This is probably not a normal problem in Seattle as the nights are usually cool enough to shut the windows, I think.)
I was a bit concerned that I might wake others in the night because this older house has very creaky floors in certain areas, but I guess I didn't bother anyone.
The snacks, coffee, tea, coffee maker, mini-fridge provided were helpful. The location was walking distance to numerous eating places and a couple grocery stores. 
"
1118153,18036368,2014-08-20,19752075,Ronald,"I had a great stay. Was as described. Quiet, and there was always street parking. Would stay here again and will recommend to friends. Stephen greeted me with all the info I needed when I arrived. Had zero problems.
"
1118153,18426089,2014-08-26,18603581,Anna Louise,"Jasmine and Stephen were incredibly welcoming and their house is beautiful! We were convenient to everything in Fremont and only a short walk away from most of Seattle. There were snacks available in the morning, fresh towels, and everything was very clean. They were helpful with tips and even lent us some supplies to make our stay easier. Plus, Blaze is a total cutie! I would definitely stay again!"
1118153,18605733,2014-08-28,20443827,Garen,"We had a great 2-night stay at Jasmine's charming home in Fremont. The atmosphere was friendly and cozy and the hosts were there whenever we had questions or wanted suggestions for getting around the city. 

The floors on the upper level were a bit creeky, but that never woke us up. 

All in all, it was a great stay!"
1118153,18801327,2014-09-01,17895103,Andy,"Stephen and Jasmine are very thoughtful and welcoming, the facilities are great, and the room itself is lovely. What a fantastic place to stay! "
1118153,18962623,2014-09-03,20293671,Ross,"Jasmine and Stephen are we super nice, the room was nice and clean, and the neighborhood is awesome. Its a close walk to any bus lines, and right next to the Fremont area which has some great food."
1118153,19211772,2014-09-08,4566686,Colin,"Stayed here for a wedding at the nearby Woodland Park Zoo. Very nice people, always around when we needed them: when we could check in, when we had to check out, when we couldn't quite figure out how to get the door open. Cool old house well-stocked with tea and granola bars, all of it right outside our room, which was one of two people could rent. Everyone who rented the other one during our stay was European, so if you're European, you'll probably enjoy the place too. (The third room is, interestingly, an acupuncture office.)"
1118153,20434684,2014-09-29,2937640,Michelle,This was a great spot to stay. The room we were in was very large and cozy. There was plenty of storage. We were only a few minutes from bus stops and about a 10 min walk from great restaurants and bars in Fremont.  Jasmin and Stephen left treats upstairs in the kitchenette and even provided soap and shampoo/conditioner for guests. 
1118153,20852216,2014-10-06,4858821,Jennifer,"My husband and I were given a warm welcome when arriving at Jasmine and Stephen's house. We were shown our room upstairs, and the landing area where the very much appreciated breakfast supplies are (refrigerator, hot water/coffee maker, filtered water, packets of instant oatmeal, some power bars, fruit, dishes and silverware), along with the bathroom. The room is light and bright, just as shown in the listing, although instead of the red table and chairs there is a desk there now with 2 chairs, and a couch along the wall, which was all fine with us. The bed was comfortable enough. What was a bit disappointing was the fact that the one upstairs bathroom was shared with us, another couple staying in the the adjoining room to ours, and the host family. I didn't know we would all be sharing one bathroom, so that was a bit of a shock. It was only a problem the following morning, when the other couple was still there, but once they'd left, and it was just my husband and I, there was no problem with the shared bathroom. We also had a hard time sleeping our first night due to road noise (the room faces out to the street), but we got ear plugs our next night and slept just fine."
1118153,23053820,2014-11-21,21062474,Tim,"Jasmine and Stephen were great hosts.  Very friendly and gave great advice about places to go and things to see in the local area.  The kitchenette is a great idea for breakfast and being able to keep our own food.  I would definitely recommend staying with Jasmine, Stephen and little baby Blaze!!"
1118153,24125011,2014-12-20,22285021,Andrew,"Jasmine and Stephen's guest room is in a beautiful house in the Fremont/Wallingford area. If you're standing out front you get a great view of the Seattle skyline from across Lake Union, especially at night. The house is only a couple blocks from tons of bars, restaurants, and theaters along 45th, but also close to I-5 and 99 if you need to get downtown. The room itself is spacious, has a huge window that looks out over the neighborhood, and a big, comfy bed. You basically have a private bathroom and access to a mini fridge, utensils, and snacks. Jasmine and Stephen are both very kind and helpful. I highly recommend this bnb to anyone visiting Seattle."
1118153,24621001,2014-12-31,25081367,Eric,"Nice hosts, very welcoming and freindly. Room was clean with nice natural light. Bed was lage enough for two people and was comfortable. All features were as listed in the description.

Location was great, within walking distance of good coffee shops, restaurants, and Fremont attractions (including the Fremont Troll and Gas Works Park).

1118153,25507774,2015-01-18,18994531,Kami,"Our stay with Jasmine and Stephen was great and just what we were looking for while we searched for an apartment for two weeks. We had our privacy but were happy to chat with the hosts if they were around. Sharing the bathroom with the family and other guests was very easy, never a hassle. There were always nice snacks and tea outside the room and we made good use of the mini fridge. "
1118153,25823910,2015-01-26,5187942,Justin,"This was a cozy, comfortable room in a beautiful older house.  Terrific views of the neighborhood and really great morning light.  It is in a very quiet neighborhood, but conveniently located to bus lines, restaurants, etc.  Jasmine and her family were incredibly warm and welcoming.  A great stay, and I would recommend it to anyone."

They were such accepting and warm hearted people and provided a very grounded family environment for me while I was away from home. I loved feeling at home there and being so well centrally located that there were plenty of places for me to walk to and enjoy."

1118153,28401442,2015-03-23,23503334,Marina,"Me and my boyfriend are from Brazil and we went to visit Seattle for Spring Break just for 3 days, so we were busy all the time doing tourist things, and just needed a place to sleep and shower. But Jamine's house was more than that! The room is very comfortable and the family made us feel very welcome. We felt in love with the neighborhood, we are so happy that we decided to stay with them  instead of a hotel at downtown. The room and bathroom were very clean all the time. The house was a little bit cold, but they left a heater just for us in the room (very sweet), and we used it all the time! Was a great experience, thank you so much! I highly recommend staying with them. "
1118153,28585649,2015-03-26,2608696,Paloma,"Jasmine's house is amazing. The room is big and confortable so as the bathroom and the location is great. She, Stephen and Blaze were very sweet and friendly with us. Was a very good experience."

I would highly recommend staying there!

1118153,35605263,2015-06-20,14101759,Jeremy,"The host was warm, helpful, present when needed, and had great info on the neighborhoods of Seattle. She was wonderful, and little Blaze is cute! The house had a great setup for out-of-town guests looking for a safe, easy, and nice place to lay their head. Fun neighborhood, and very easy to get to. I could always find parking within a block of the house, and we'd be happy to recommend it to anyone popping into Seattle for a couple of days!"

It was really easy to get to and from downtown with the buses and the local Fremont area was cool to check out."
1118153,44606718,2015-08-27,6226571,Sara,This was my second time staying at this particular Airbnb and it was great as always. The neighborhood is one of my favorite's in Seattle & it's convenient to everything.

The neighborhood was not one I had visited before and I found it terrific with nearby stores, good restaurants, and even an old fashioned movie theater. "
1118153,52991530,2015-11-03,19141639,Carl,"Jasmine and Stephen were very accommodating and provided everything we needed and some bonuses like tea and snacks. The location is convenient for both Wallingford and Fremont, two of Seattle's most friendly neighborhoods. "

Thanks again to Jasmine for letting me into her home! 5 Stars"

48319,338363,2011-06-27,406703,Rj,"I loved my stay in Seattle and Erik's loft was in a perfect location and walking distance to a variety of hotspots which included shopping, restaurants, bars, etc...  I plan to visit again this year and would definitely stay at the loft if its available since it was a great experience and reminded me of my loft in San Francisco which is a nice open space with great views and lots of natural light!:-)  I highly encourage you to stay here if you are planning a visit to Seattle to make your trip memorable and extremely comfortable!  It's a home away from home environment and I met lots of nice people in the building and overall area as well!!  "
48319,367198,2011-07-11,677107,Matthew,"If heaven were an Urban Loft, this would be it!!  The furnishings, style and view all lead to a memorable and regal experience.  Everything seems to have been well thought out and Erik was such a helpful and easy going host.  The friend I was visiting, was so impressed by the place she had to call her mom immediately to tell her about her HG TV  experience.  Treat yourself with a stay here..."
48319,381629,2011-07-18,798338,Jeff,"Comfortable, private, great location, with an amazing view of the Space Needle. Erik made it soo easy to checkin, checkout.
It was like staying at a nice hotel where they don't bother you, or try to up-sell you; and at the same time, it was like crashing at your best friends pad. 
This neighborhood is nice, there are wonderful restaurants and bars within walking distance. All the people we met in the area were super courteous and chill.
I gave it four stars only because on my scale, 5 is for absolute perfection.. which is to say this place was extremely good."
48319,389892,2011-07-22,838955,Mark,"An absolutely lovely loft in a convenient location!  It's directly across the street from Whole Foods and walking distance to all major downtown attractions, such as, shopping, restaurants, and the convention center.  I will definitely stay here when visiting Seattle again. 

The loft's host (Erik) was friendly, fast-replying, and followed through at every turn of the registration and hosting process.   When I walked into the loft I was immediately taken back by how clean and well-taken-care of the place was.  His pictures are 100% accurate.  This is the real deal.  

If you want luxury accommodations, a place that feels like home, and is convenient to all major downtown attractions then I'd highly recommend staying here.  I've stayed at some of the best hotels and this is one of my favorites.  Superb!

48319,547375,2011-09-19,1111165,Marc,"Erik's place is great.  A very convenient location on the edge of South Lake Union. Easy walks in most directions and the streetcar is just out front.  Having the Whole Foods a block away is great too. Melissa (Erik's Assistant) was very helpful and worked with my ever changing schedule to ensure a smooth ""check in"" process - the fresh flowers were a nice touch too."
48319,614118,2011-10-10,1032326,Jennie,"What an amazing place!!! Pictures don't do it justice.  We had a girls night and it was the perfect spot for it.  Walking distance to fun places to drink and eat!  Thanks Erik!

48319,641479,2011-10-18,899589,Alex,Just came back from Seattle and staying at Erik's loft was great.  It was in a great location and perfect for 2 people. Parking was easy and it was across the street from a whole foods. He was a great host and very easy to get in touch with if we needed anything. 
48319,712600,2011-11-12,672624,Debbie,This apartment (and view) is stunning! Well worth planning a trip to Seattle just to stay here!
48319,1191474,2012-04-28,2014504,Miriam,"The apartment was spacious and very comfortable. It appeared as in the pictures -stylish and well appointed; great location - walking distance to Downtown, Lake Union, Space Needle Park, and a short bus ride/taxi to many other restaurants and locations. The bathroom was large and spacious. Laundry (in unit was excellent) and the apartment had everything we sought for an extended stay, while in the city for part holiday/part work for extended period.

It was GREAT - a true home away from home. I would have given it 5-stars if it would have been cleanly presented.
I guess my general comments are similar to what we are finding with most home stays - that it was not cleaned prior to our arrival. Bedding, sheets and towels were clean - but floors were dirty, surfaces dusty, kitchen appliances eg microwave not clean, kitchen cabinets and surfaces stained with long term spills etc. I spent the first day cleaning and mopping floors to make it comfortable and bring it up to a standard that I would like and expect in my own home, or a hotel room. 

The host was helpful prior to our arrival but slow to respond in general. There was only one key and building pass supplied - and after requesting a second were told that only 1 key and pass available. This was inconvenient for us - making coming and going at different times difficult for us. My husband had work and I was on vacation - it involved a lot of coorindination to simply access the building and apartment with 1 set of keys - needs to be improved. There was no way to overcome this and we just had to work with the situation.

The host did not meet us or have anyone show us around. We did not know where the gym was in the building - if there was one. He did not reply to texts after the first one - ignoring issues with keys and our need to get mail delivered - once we were in. 

All in all, these things would not matter if you were in the city for a weekend getaway. But, we were longer term residents so the lack of "

48319,1342243,2012-05-24,1821245,Lorie,"Fantastic apartment, and very central. It was absolutely spotless when I arrived. The building is secure, the bed was extremely comfortable, and the wireless worked perfectly. I would definitely stay here on my next trip to Seattle. "
48319,1384069,2012-05-30,2180351,Martine,"My fiance and I stayed here a few weeks ago and the place is amazing!  Erik was quick to respond to any questions we  had.  The loft literally had everything you would need, it's clean, comfortable, spacious, and gorgeous to boot!  The building also has a gym which came in handy after  the cheese fries I ate!
The area is fantastic also, you can walk to Whole Foods, Banya Spa (which they give great massages), and since we drove we were only 5-10 minutes away from Pike Place, shopping, restaurants, etc...  I would definitely stay here again!  Thanks Erik!!"
48319,1402708,2012-06-02,2466046,Jason,"Really enjoyed my stay at this apartment. It is in a great location downtown, very clean, spacious and looks even better in person than in the pictures. Would definitely stay here again."
48319,1423773,2012-06-05,2498773,Derek,Erik's flat was very enjoyable. It's a lot of space with a great view. The location is fantastic with lots of restaurants and the downtown core within walking distance. We also enjoyed using the two community decks in the building on the days it was nice enough to do so. 
48319,1509959,2012-06-18,2559856,Chris,"Great place with an amazing view. Wonderful location with an easy walk to downtown and shopping. Erik's condo looked like it came out of an Architectual Digest magazine and we loved it. We'd definitely do it again.

Erik was quick to answer emails and texts and the condo was clean when we arrived. Accomodations were great and comfortable too."
48319,1655164,2012-07-08,2112511,Shari,"Location!  it's the best one could be in the city.  Convenience of choice whether to walk or take the public transportation made it perfect
Checking in was easy.  Unit was very clean and very spacious.
The great weather few days before and after 4th of July made our stay at Erik's loft even more enjoyable.  Fourth of July fireworks on Lake Union was beautiful and fun.
Shari & Tim from Kailua, Hawaii"
48319,1738427,2012-07-18,1626124,Karie,This place is in a great location and is very well equipped. It was great having a Whole Foods across the street with such a well equipped kitchen. We didn't have a car and were able to easily walk everywhere we wanted to go. 
48319,1910358,2012-08-06,981757,Melody,The reservation was canceled 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6854552,35532058,2015-06-19,36071096,Catrina,It was perfect. Everything was clean and new and Katrina was prompt in her response and bringing the key even though I arrived late at like 10:30pm. I really appreciated it! Comfortable bed and nice amenities. I even used the gym! There was a coffee maker which was great as well. 
6854552,35756742,2015-06-21,14758200,Steph,"I am kicking myself. KICKING MYSELF. Why have I not used Airbnb before? Is it always this amazing?! Let me tell you about this particular unit: it's phenomenal. The space was incredibly clean, very comfortable and even had little touches throughout. The view is to die for; the photos don't do it justice. My husband and I stayed there with our 5 year old and Katrina provided an inflatable mattress that was VERY easy to use (in fact, we just ordered one we liked it so much). So not only is the space itself absolutely brilliant but we WALKED to both Pike Street Market *and the monorail to head to the Space Needle. It's in a fantastic location and also right by a Whole Foods. Additionally, since we're new to Airbnb I was pretty high maintenance with my questions and messages and Katrina was very patient, helpful and fast to respond.  The value for your dollar is outstanding. Hotels in the area charge the same amount and you're all crammed into one little room. In this place, we put our daughter to bed in the proper bedroom and opened a lovely bottle of wine and gawked at the night-time Space Needle skyline from the comfort of the living room. I can't say enough about how positive of an experience this was and hope you'll find this review helpful when selecting a place: this is worth every single cent. We'll be back. "
6854552,36470495,2015-06-28,6525545,Peter,"Katrina's apartment was just as described. Extremely walkable in the downtown area of Seattle, close to great restaurants and shops, and extremely clean and modern. We had a great time and would definitely stay again."
6854552,37264079,2015-07-05,2110444,Ck,"Katrina's place is amazing! The view is incredible, and the unit is basically like a luxury hotel suite. Most of the attractions you are probably familiar with in Seattle are within a mile away. My girlfriend and I are very active, so we enjoyed being able to walk everywhere we went (Pike Place Market, the waterfront, Space Needle, Lake Union Park - we accumulated over 25 miles of walking in 3 days!). We also loved being able to rent city bicycles, which we enjoyed riding through the bike-friendly streets to CenturyLink Field  (1.5 miles away) for a Sounders match - there is a bike station right across the street from the apartment building.

If I had to complain, it would be because the bed felt too soft and on the small side for two people, but that just comes down to personal preference (I'm used to a firm, king-sized bed). Katrina met us with a smile promptly as we arrived, and while my girlfriend and I are very low-maintenance travelers, she made herself available to us if we needed anything. I definitely recommend this listing, and hope it's available on my next visit. I already miss the view!"
6854552,37614242,2015-07-08,27450730,Steve,"My most pleasant Airbnb experience to date. Katrina was a fabulous host. She was pleasant, communicative, detailed, and always available. She offered wonderful suggestions on dinning and things to do. It was if I were staying at a friends home.  I will definitely be back."
6854552,37814992,2015-07-10,1149620,Michael,Katrina was a great host! Contacted me early and met me right when I arrived in town. Her apartment is beautiful and clean with a great view of down town and walking distance from all of the hottest spots. Would definitely stay here again if I'm ever back in Seattle!
6854552,38017414,2015-07-12,615004,Luis Angel,"The apartment was perfectly located and has a really amazing view of Seattle from both the living room and bedroom.  Very comfortable, nice Smart TV.  Katrina made sure that our check-in was seamless and communication was always top-notch.  The bed is very comfortable, and the fact that the unit has AC was a life-saver for the summer.  The building has some really great amenities, and paid parking is very easy to find.  I would definitely stay here again in a future trip to Seattle!"
6854552,38532169,2015-07-16,10588803,Robert,This place was great!  I highly recommend this spot.  The view was awesome!  The place was clean!  Everything is in walking distance.
6854552,38883748,2015-07-19,12939009,Pamela,"Katrina met us at the apartment and made sure we had everything we needed.  She even had a bottle of wine for us! The apartment is just as lovely as it looks in the photos, the view is fabulous.  All of the amenities we needed were available. It was a short distance to the Space Needle and the apartment was the perfect home base for our weekend. "
6854552,39459450,2015-07-23,1606832,Juli,"Excellent service from start to finish. This space is so comfy and clean! The pickiest person could not find fault with it. Katrina was a gem, so easy to get ahold of and really wanting to make sure I was comfortable. Check in was easy and came with a bottle of wine which was so sweet! I can't wait to come back:) "
6854552,40114347,2015-07-28,36017131,Sarah,"Very clean and comfortable space.  The hosts were accommodating and helpful.  Walking distance to the Pike Market, shopping, and many restaurants.   "
6854552,40475563,2015-07-31,19395802,Sherry,"Really lovely, apartment.  We had a very enjoyable stay.  Katrina resolved a minor Internet issue we had right away.  There is a lot of construction right in front of the building but we couldn't hear any of it from the apartment.  The view is amazing."
6854552,40767002,2015-08-02,4798005,Chris,"The view from Katrina's condo is amazing!  The location is also fantastic and very central to many of my favorite neighborhoods in Seattle.  Arrival and check-out process were seamless, and I would definitely stay here again.  "
6854552,41374968,2015-08-07,5814388,Rob,"We really enjoyed our stay here. Walking distance to downtown area and a great clear view of the Space Needle. There's a Wholefoods 5 mins walk as well.

The flat itself was very well kept. The living area is really comfortable for a few hours of chilling watching the massive TV, bedroom and bed are a good size though the bed was a little soft for our liking though, but thats just preference.

Katrina got in contact before we arrived and was helpful and responsive to any questions. She left us a bottle of wine which was a lovely welcome."
6854552,42402728,2015-08-13,36044418,Barry,"What a great experience! Katrina made sure that I had everything I needed when I got in and check in was so easy. 

It was a beautiful apartment and you cannot beat the beautiful view after a long day at work. 

I really loved how close it was to everything in the city. 

Stay here for a relaxing, convenient spot in Seattle!"
6854552,42867836,2015-08-16,36655632,Sonja,The property was just as described. My 12 year old daughter and I stayed for a long weekend and we really enjoyed coming back to the apartment after a busy day. The neighborhood was very quiet and close to everything!  Our host was very quick to answer any questions we had about the area. Katrina's instructions were very good! We felt very safe and welcomed! Definitely will stay here again when we get a chance to visit Seattle!
6854552,43810645,2015-08-22,643317,Samantha,"Katrina's apartment was awesome! She really has thought of everything to make you as comfortable as possible. We had let her know that we would be arriving early, and though she wasn't able to meet us, the instructions she gave us were clear and we had no problems. The furniture and the bed were very comfortable, and the smart TV and full size shampoo bottles were a nice plus.  

Now I can tell you about that view, the too good to be true view of the Space Needle in the pictures- it's even better than the pictures. Not only do you have a gorgeous, unobstructed view of Seattle's most iconic landmark, but on clear days you have wonderful sunset views of the Cascades. To the north is Lake Union, and you can watch sailboats on the water and seaplanes take off and pass right by the windows as they land on the lake. Last but not least, on the clearest, sunniest days to your North East, you have a view of Mt Baker.

I loved this listing, and when we come back to Seattle I hope to stay here again."
6854552,45376350,2015-09-02,34370887,Keith,"Absolutely beautiful place with a fantastic host! Very easy process for a first time airbnb user, and she was more than helpful during the whole process! Would easily book with her again!"
6854552,46564863,2015-09-11,42921241,Breanna,The apartment was beautiful with an amazing view! It was very clean and well organized. The host provided clear expectations and guidance on check in and check out which was greatly appreciated. The host and our experience was awesome! Great stay!
6854552,46764183,2015-09-13,1990281,Wendy,"The experience at Aspira hosted by Katrina was excellent.  I have stayed in Seattle several different times and this was definitely one of the top 3 experiences.  The reservation process was extremely efficient.  Katrina was able to accomodate an early check in and the key hand-off was very easy.  Lastly, the apt was very clean, spacious, with a fantastic view of the space needle.  Would not hesitate to recommend both Katrina and the apt to anyone looking for a fantastic lodging in Seattle downtown area."
6854552,47656470,2015-09-21,38045105,Gina,"Apartment was very clean, in a nice building, and perfect for our few days' stay. Katrina answered our questions promptly and made sure we had everything we needed.  The neighborhood was just what we were looking for--very walkable and close to restaurants.  The view from the apartment was fantastic.  It all looks just like the pictures.  Thanks for a great place!"
6854552,48140740,2015-09-23,4274739,Raquel,"The apartment was incredible, it looks exactly like the pictures. The location is fantastic to walk downtown or to work, the view of Seattle from the 26th floor is unbeatable and Katrina is an excellent host. I would highly recommend staying here when visiting the city."
6854552,49521296,2015-10-04,6361982,Jenny,"I rate this apartment and host very highly.  The apartment was exactly as described, with wonderful views of Seattle including the Sky Needle.  The apartment was very clean and had all the required amenities for a one week stay.  The location itself was very good - a 5 minute walk to Whole Foods and a 10 minute walk to downtown.  Katrina was most friendly and accommodating, providing us with an early check-in and late check-out.  All of her communications were professional and friendly.  If visiting Seattle again, I would definitely stay in this apartment.  Thanks again Katrina!  "
6854552,50869824,2015-10-15,6152029,Eoin,"From the start Katya made my visit perfect in every way. Despite a delay in my arrival due to plane issues she was available at short notice to facilitate my access to the apartment. Feeling tired with jetlag this was great.

The apartment is exactly ad advertised and did not disappoint.

All in all my first airbnb stay was perfect.

Thank you Katya!"
6854552,51383416,2015-10-19,36105050,Lindsey,This place was perfect! The view was worth every penny. We walked or used Uber. Katya was excellent and flexible with our request of arriving early. The apartment was perfectly clean thanks to Bonnie and we had a bottle of wine at our arrival! (Big score there).  I can't wait to come back to Seattle and I will stay at the Downtown Hi-Rise!
6854552,51844842,2015-10-24,43963093,Len,Great location. Clean. Well equipped unit. Super view. Accommodating host but not sure she was our greeter. Strange parking arrangements. Heat was not working when we  needed it the last night. We'd stay their again for sure.
6854552,58209038,2016-01-01,51554592,Mary,"Katya was extremely communicative and welcoming - she gave us a quick tour and a bottle of wine before leaving us to explore Seattle! We also really appreciated how accomodating she was letting us check in early. The apartment had a stunning view, as shown in the photos, and proved a perfect spot for viewing the new year fireworks. We walked almost everywhere our entire trip thanks to the excellent location. Thank you, Katya, for the wonderful stay! "
5992645,44475544,2015-08-26,13484167,Daniel,"Brandon was an excellent host and the house was exactly as described—charming and cozy. The location was ideal—close to the University, the expressway and walking distance to nearby shops and restaurants. Thanks Brandon."
3279728,17101318,2014-08-07,329244,Rachel,We loved Seattle and we enjoyed our stay in this home! Richard was an excellent host and very easy to work with. His home guide was very helpful both with the house and with his suggestions about the neighborhood. The house is located in a great location. We had no trouble driving into the city at all times of day and it was very close to Alki Beach and Lincoln Park. We loved the West Seattle area! The house was comfortable for our family of 5 and we appreciated that it had 3 bathrooms!  We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again and would recommend it to family and friends.
3279728,17281383,2014-08-10,16835156,David,The host was prompt on follow up and answered all my questions.  The location was easy to find and convenient for our need.  The accomodations met our needs and we would recommend to others.
3279728,17533056,2014-08-13,19206909,Aaron,"The house was beautiful, clean and stylish.  Very convenient, all the shopping you need is within walking distance.  Extremely comfortable place to stay with a great kitchen and lots of bathrooms.  Richard was easy to deal with, answering questions quickly and checking in occasionally to make sure the stay was going well.  Would highly recommend."
3279728,17945761,2014-08-19,10573286,Felicity,"Richard is the nicest fellow, and very concerned and helpful. He went out of his way to stay in touch and make sure that everything was perfect for our arrival. The beds are super comfortable and the kitchen is a dream. Thanks for everything Richard!"
3279728,18270431,2014-08-24,9150113,Penpak,Richard was very involved and available with our privacy upheld and everything went smoothly.
3279728,24476283,2014-12-29,23473149,Karen,"Richard's house was lovely and exactly as described. It is conveniently located close to the airport and downtown. Coffee shops, a bookstore and other shops are within a five minute walk and the beach is close as well. Richard was very accommodating and attentive and quickly addressed every need that we had. We would come again!"
3279728,44159965,2015-08-24,39148468,Robin,"Richard was a wonderful host and promptly responded to all of our questions despite the fact that he was traveling in and out of remote areas during our stay.

The house was well stocked with all the essentials and Richard's “House Guide” was quite informative and very helpful. There were even travel guides available for guests who aren't familiar with the Seattle area.

I tend to be a little OCD about certain things so the dusty corners bothered me a bit. However, the bathrooms were clean and so were the beds, which were also very comfortable. My husband and I were in W. Seattle for a wedding, along with both of our moms. Having three bathrooms was certainly helpful when it came time to prepare for a shower, rehearsal dinner, wedding, etc.

Also, Richard has a very interesting book, music, and memorabilia collection – we could have spent a week just perusing all they had to offer.

I would certainly recommend Richard's home to other travelers – couldn't ask for a better host and it's conveniently located to all that Seattle has to offer.
"
3279728,44923312,2015-08-30,19804281,Steffanie,The house was perfect for the 5 of us that stayed here. Everything we needed was stocked in the house and it's convenient to groceries (Safeway) and downtown (about 15 min) not to mention Richard was a fantastic host to work with- he checked in with me leading up to our stay and once we got there. Would highly recommend.
3279728,45826906,2015-09-06,40802209,Myndal,"After we arrived, Richard called to make sure we were settled in and asked if we needed his help in any way.  He gave us very specific directions regarding entry to his home."
1775016,20531079,2014-09-30,5167380,Tracy,"Robert was a wonderful host, and we appreciated the communication! This location was perfect for exploring Seattle, and we were able to walk to attractions such as the Space Needle, Pioneer Square, and the downtown Pike Market. The walk to these sites from Capitol Hill is all downhill so remember after a long day of walking and exploring that you will have to walk UP that hill to get back to your charming room. The accommodations are well depicted in the photos, and we were pleased. There is a little coffee shop less than a 2 minute walk away that serves up the most exquisite doughnuts. In addition, there are many quaint restaurants and bars within walking distance in any direction. I will recommend Robert's place to all my friend's visiting Seattle."
1775016,20870551,2014-10-06,10059449,Erica,"My boyfriend and I had a fabulous stay! The house was so charming and full of character. It was situated in a great neighborhood - a short walk to anything you'd need. Robert was very attentive and quick to respond, he was a GREAT host, even from a distance. We had a lovely stay and would definitely go back. I highly recommend !"
1775016,21243349,2014-10-13,20072109,Anna,"Staying at Robert’s place was a nightmare. At 8 am on the first morning, we were woken up by very loud hammering and banging occurring literally right outside our window. The room was shaking that we thought this was an earthquake. We opened the curtain and saw a construction worker on the roof 2 feet from our bedroom window.  We immediately called Robert, who unhelpfully said he had no control over this and that we could cancel our reservation or stay in his basement. The first thing I did when I arrived was to make my boyfriend check out his dark basement, so it obviously didn’t make me feel comfortable to sleep in there. It also wouldn’t have helped because there was a loud construction machine right in front of where the basement would be. The construction occurred again on the next morning. 

Robert knew of this construction from his previous guests and made NO mention of these major disturbances in the listing or communication with us prior to our arrival. He made NO effort to contact the workers and work out a different time for them to do work on his roof. The work is done on HIS house, but he left his guests to suffer through the disturbances for two mornings in a row and deal with the situation without any input. His attitude was simply I have no control over this, deal with it on your own or leave. 

When we filed for a petition for get a partial refund, Robert was very condescending and rude in his responses. He called us “high maintenance prima donnas” and suggested that we were immature for sleeping in past 8 AM on my weekend vacation in Seattle, as his other guests were all “mature” and left early in the morning so they were not disturbed by the construction work. He even flat out lied about other things (that he offered us a refund being one). 

There were other communication issues and things that he tried to blame us for. We arrived late at night in October, when the outside temperature is in the low 60s. There are no temperature controls or air vents in the room. The only heating source in the room is this arcane water heater, so we set the temperature to low 70s. However, after we raised our concerns about construction, Robert blamed us for violating his house rules by changing the temperature and wanted to charge us for it. He then mentioned there were space heaters, but he never mentioned this to us before or during our stay. How can you expect guests to stay in a room in the 60s without providing any source of heating and expect them to be comfortable?

Overall, this was a horrible Airbnb experience for my boyfriend (who has stayed in over 10 Airbnbs) and I. The host was incommunicative, inconsiderate, and insulting. We suggest thinking twice before staying with Robert.
"
1775016,21567543,2014-10-19,2974150,Shannon,"A very clean and organized house that felt like it was straight from a Pottery Barn catalog. The house is a charming old arts and crafts home that has wonderful details including the windows in the bedroom. It has all new upgrades to the house including the bathroom which afforded amenities much like a hotel. The host is kind, a great communicator and very respectful. "
1775016,21725186,2014-10-22,5679067,Sana,"Staying at robs place was better than staying at a hotel!  The house is stunning, in an ideal location and had the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on. Thank you Rob!"
1775016,21925405,2014-10-26,7409760,John & Erik,"This house was wonderfully clean, modernized, and very comfy.  Wish we could have met Robert and learned more about the area.

"
1775016,21952117,2014-10-27,11362530,Shelby,"While our host, Robert, wasn't able to be there during our stay, he left very thorough, clear, and helpful instructions, which made our stay easier. The house was beautiful---very clean and appointed as well as described. We loved our room---gorgeous bathroom!---and appreciated the use of Apple TV. The house is also well located, very accessible to Capitol Hill and downtown. Parking was slightly tricky, but otherwise no complaints! We'd definitely stay here again!"
1775016,22126263,2014-10-30,22659975,Susan,"Robert was wonderful.  He was out of town when I arrived, but left detailed emailed instructions and made sure to check in on me when he returned to town.  The room was as advertised - immaculate, beautiful and had everything I needed.  I would love to stay again."
1775016,22313465,2014-11-03,12148002,Cathryn,"Really great location, as it was very close to the downtown area and a beautiful park. It's also just across the street from several coffee shops and eateries. The house itself was adorable and welcoming. We particularly loved the big window looking out toward the street. Robert was communicative and helpful. Thanks!"
1775016,22463254,2014-11-07,20527619,Keith,"Wonderful accommodations in a lively Seatle neighborhood, close to Seattle center.  Robert was a very accommodating host and shared helpful knowledge of the local area, as well as Seattle proper. The Master Suite was as advertised and very comfortable. The queen bed was heavenly and not to be missed. Don't miss this gem!! Highly recommend! "
1775016,22604971,2014-11-10,22721151,Lauren,Robert was a great host and his place was very neat and comfortable to stay in. His house is in a very central location of Capitol Hill and walking distance of our favorite place for Seattle donuts Top Pot. I would definitely stay at Robert's place again in the future! His place is very clean and bathroom was nice.
1775016,22723870,2014-11-12,23433507,Lianne,"This was our first time doing airbnb and everything went smoothly. Rob was super chill. Room was good, nothing special, but the neighborhood was well worth it. Fantastic bars and restos in 10 mins walking distance. Bring your own pillows!"
1775016,22933338,2014-11-17,8117371,Dick,Excellent place to stay.  Very accessible to downtown area.  Robert was very accommodating and warm to us.  Managed to secure a zone parking pass from him which was a real boon.  Without one could be a challenge especially if you're a late evening arrival.  All in all - very nice.  Would highly recommend staying there.
1775016,23425451,2014-12-01,8834869,Kathy,"This is a great place to stay in Seattle.  Robert is a very accommodating host.  He responded quickly to emails, allowed us to arrive early, and salted the steps after it had snowed.  The location is fantastic...just a few blocks from a movie theater, coffee shops, restaurants, etc.  It's a very charming, clean and comfortable home."
1775016,23517476,2014-12-02,1603334,Michael,My partner enjoyed our brief stay at Roberts.  The lovely character home was warm and inviting and Robert was very accommodating.  I plan to rebook with Rebook when I return to Seattle.
1775016,24901963,2015-01-03,1014574,Billy,"This house is located in a lovely neighbourhood in cap hill and is close to everything you need it to be. Great house with a very nice kitchen. The master suite was very nice and clean. This is probably the best airbnb place I have been to. Easy access even though I never met Robert, I would highly recommend this place. "
1775016,28362595,2015-03-22,7608129,Sarah,"A lovely room in a lovely home. The home is very clean and comfortable.  Parking is a bit challenging, especially if you are coming back in the evening.  Capitol Hill has much to offer and the Main Street is only a few blocks away, easy walk! Thank you Robert. "
1775016,28387147,2015-03-23,26503577,Debra,Robert was there to greet us. We found the house as described except for the construction going on in the front of the house. The room was great with a private bath as shown. The location is perfect. . .walking distance to Capitol and downtown. 
1775016,28605607,2015-03-27,27545689,Herman,"Rob was great, very friendly, made us feel very welcomed and was not intrusive. He showed us around and provided all the information that we needed during our stay."
1775016,28814566,2015-03-30,28729943,Chet,"Robert was very welcoming, and his house was beautiful. The shower and bed were great, and the room was very clean. I had a difficult time finding parking, though I did arrive on a Friday at 7pm. That said, Robert provided a parking pass so once I did find a spot (maybe a five-minute walk away), I just left my car there and walked everywhere, as the location is pretty central. I'll definitely be staying here again when I'm back in Seattle! "
1775016,28892313,2015-03-31,14801775,Katie,Roberts home was beautiful and just what we needed! The room looks just as pictured and the bed was super comfortable! The location was perfect and I loved the neighborhood! Thank you Robert!
1775016,29777857,2015-04-12,13538342,Eric,"Robert was cordial without being overbearing. The room was exactly what we were looking for and this is a perfect location for a quick walk downtown. Plus one of my favorite coffee shops, Analog Coffee, is right up the street! Thanks again Robert."
1775016,31383880,2015-05-04,25252227,Suzy,"What a beautiful home! Robert's house is spotless and impeccably kept. The room was nicer than many hotels I've been to, and with all the comforts and quality. The bed was very comfortable too.

The area was fantastic - close enough to downtown to walk and near to the restaurants on Capitol Hill.

Robert shared a lot of details in advance, which made it an easy and seamless trip. I would highly recommend!"
1775016,31858003,2015-05-10,30478458,Steven,Had a lovely time...
1775016,33390878,2015-05-27,13921609,Ciara,"Robert has a lovely home that is kept neat & tidy. Although he was out of town during our stay he was very accommodating allowing us to drop off our baggage before the official 'check-in' time. The location is very central, allowing us to walk to Pike Market in roughly 30 mins. Lots of great places to brunch in the area too! "
1775016,34033609,2015-06-03,10922836,Morgan,The house was very nice and clean and the directions to get in were easy to follow. My room and that adjacent bathroom was also nice and looked like the photos. I really liked the neighborhood.
1775016,34545299,2015-06-09,10460987,Catherine,"Robert's home is beautiful! I stayed in the Master Suite A and absolutely loved it! The room is gorgeous! The private bathroom was equally as stunning. Everything was neat & tidy. The bed was very comfortable & there were enough pillows to accommodate anyone's preference. It was very easy to communicate with Robert. Check in and check out was a breeze. He provides you with all the information you need to have a very uncomplicated stay. He also provides a parking pass and I found there was always ample parking nearby and a plethora of places within walking distance. There is a fabulous coffee & pastry shop right across the street and a market just a block away. The neighborhood is one of my favorites in Seattle. The streets are lined with lush trees, friendly neighbors and delicious restaurants. You can walk to downtown, pikes place market & the space needle in about 25 mins or grab a nearby car2go or uber. I prefer to walk as you are able to stop at local cafes and shops on your way to your destination. I felt very safe walking in and around Robert's neighborhood and enjoyed meeting some neighbors along the way. I highly recommend staying at Robert's and I would love to stay there again, next time I am in Seattle!"
1775016,34757400,2015-06-11,3292772,Audrey,"Had an overall good experience staying at Rob's house. He is really friendly and easy to communicate with, and his house is decorated well, and is located in an excellent Seattle neighborhood. Parking was convenient. It met all of my needs for an overnight business stay. I would certainly recommend that people stay here. However, I will say that I found the photos to be slightly better than the house was in person. With just a little TLC and simple decorating updates, I think it would match the look in the photos and be an amazing place to stay.
"
1775016,34873577,2015-06-13,32975727,Gary,"Robert was a great host.  His house is all remodeled and our room & bathroom were quite nice and very clean inside.  We had use of the kitchen & dining room.  There are lots of convenience stores in the area and we did also walk down to Pike Market from the house - pretty good distance though, and took the city bus right back to within a block of the house.  Parking on the street can be a hassle to find spaces, but Robert does provide you with a local area parking pass once you find a place.  Seattle traffic is quite congested and you are better off using the city bus if you can.  The house is up from the street, so there are quite a few stairways to deal with.  But even being at 69, it wasn't a big deal once we got settled in."
1775016,35025698,2015-06-14,34546982,Jinyu,"We had great experience at Robert's place. Although he was traveling, he answered every questions promptly. The room was spacious and nicely decorated."
1775016,35411061,2015-06-18,32936490,Janelle,"We had a wonderful experience with rob!  He has obviously done this a million times, and was wonderfully accommodating and knowledgable about the process. Rob was our very first host and was great about giving advice about the city, filling us in all about how airBnB works and making sure we had all the tools to have a successful trip! The house is beautiful, we stayed in the larger suite in front and the view was amazing, and Capitol Hill-I cannot recommend just going and having fun in the Capitol Hill area.  "
1775016,36014748,2015-06-24,31607098,Ilene,"Robert was terrific. The room is as shown - lovely and bright. A fan in the window kept it perfectly cool at night. Capitol Hill is a great neighborhood with fantastic restaurants and bars. We were there for six nights, so it was a true pleasure to take advantage of the laundry room, and travel back with clean clothes. It's a bit of a walk to the touristy spots downtown, but once we got our bearings, it didn't seem so bad, and provided an excuse to start most mornings at Top Pot Doughnuts. "
1775016,36206977,2015-06-26,34793214,Tracey,Nice home and location. Helpful host.
1775016,36286238,2015-06-27,6442335,Tim,"Robert's place is even BETTER than pictured; it is immaculate! It's in a gorgeous neighborhood in Capitol Hill--in impossibly beautiful Seattle. Robert has thought of everything that could possibly make any guest comfortable.

There are also three great transit perks! One is the light rail station opening up soon in Capitol Hill. But there's also a bus that stops literally around the corner. BEST of all, though, there's a bike share station just two blocks south of his house! So, hop on a bike, explore the Emerald City, have fun, and come back to the most comfortable home away from home imaginable. :) "
1775016,36613535,2015-06-29,12140383,Suvi,High recommendation. All the arrangements were well handled and questions promptly answered. Room was as described and very clean.
1775016,36743575,2015-06-30,28470729,Joseph,Excellent spot. I felt quite comfortable and grateful to have found Robert's place. Would absolutely recommend to someone who is coming through Seattle. 
1775016,36980430,2015-07-03,30712736,Brianna,"Really beautiful home in a great neighborhood. Parking, even with a parking pass, was a challenge. House was very hot but I knew there was no AC when I booked the stay so can't complain. "
1775016,37615602,2015-07-08,25720647,Jinny,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it could not have been better! Robert was very clear and communicative about the reservation and details, as well as flexible about our needs. The room was very clean, spacious, and comfortable. The en suite bathroom was equally clean and very convenient. The rest of the house was well decorated and lovely! The location is convenient to many things in the Capitol Hill area, and Robert was nice enough to offer a parking pass that allowed us to park on the street in front of the house and get around without the car! Overall, we had a wonderful experience and would definitely stay at this location again!"
1775016,38432488,2015-07-15,34185604,Larry,"Everything was a described and Rob was fantastic about being in prompt communication. The house was quiet and other guests in the house were very respectful of the house rules. 

It was great staying in a neighborhood home as opposed to a downtown hotel. The house was comfortable and in a great location; Only a block from a Top Pot donut shop. How can you go wrong? The ensuite bathroom was well appointed and the shower was terrific."
1775016,38590552,2015-07-17,3125699,Jenny,Robert's house and the room we stayed in were great! Our room was very nicely decorated and comfortable and the bathroom was gorgeous. We were out of the house for most of our stay and it was the perfect space to come home to crash after a long day of sightseeing. The location was great and easy for us out-of-towners to find bus stops or take a short uber ride to every where we wanted to go.
1775016,39399721,2015-07-23,35567711,Nancy,"Rob greeted us upon our arrival on a very hot Seattle day in the Capital Hill neighborhood. Our room was bright and cheerful and clean. Rob's home is very nicely decorated and I loved the artwork! The location was perfect for us because it was just a few blocks from our family. A coffee shop and a pizza shop are just down the block. It was fun walking to the coffee/donut shop each morning, and even more pleasant sitting on the beautiful deck after dark enjoying the cool breeze and a glass of wine! The flowers surrounding the patio deck are luscious! We hope to stay at Rob's again!"
1775016,39524176,2015-07-24,34050775,Lori,"We truly enjoyed staying at Robert's AirBnb.  The location was perfect (beware the Top Pot Donuts across the street!) for visiting either Capital Hill or downtown Seattle.  The master suite was wonderful, the house beautifully decorated and the neighborhood very quiet.  There was a very comfortable deck out front, hopefully next time we can spend some time out there."
1775016,39684692,2015-07-25,19677908,Tiffany,We loved this charming house.  The suite was very clean and the bed very comfortable!  
1775016,40150327,2015-07-28,557669,Ryan,"Robert, 

Is very polite and welcoming. 

We arrived late and the only thing possibly suggesting someone being in the home were the crackers and cheese left by the tv chair. All I know of Robert is that he likes cheese and is quite as a mouse. And that he has a friendly smile."
1775016,40235023,2015-07-29,36573122,Chad,"Rob was it the residence while we were there and was very considerate of our privacy. We asked for recommendations and directions and was very helpful. The photos were exactly what was expected. The location was great, many places to eat in the area. Great neighborhood, felt very safe. We walked to downtown Seattle and the lovely shopping area in Capital Hill. We plan to stay again on our next visit. "
1775016,40326228,2015-07-30,34220226,Gregg,The suite was just as described and very nice.  It was in a super convenient location  We really enjoyed our stay.  
1775016,41469752,2015-08-07,10922797,Colin,"Having frequently used Airbnb for leisure travel, when I encountered sticker shock for a last-minute business trip to Seattle, I opted to use Airbnb for business travel. Staying at Robert's space far exceeded my expectations! 

Arriving a bit later in the evening than I had expected, I was met by Robert with a welcoming greeting (despite having been given instructions on how to access the property). He was extremely friendly and immediately made me feel at home - a genuinely gracious host.

The space was immaculate and tastefully decorated - exactly as described and as the pictures reflected. It was comfortable, cozy and private. There is a tremendous pride-of-ownership evident in the property (something I greatly appreciate when staying at Airbnb properties). 

Having lived within blocks of the property over 20 years ago, I was familiar with the neighborhood and remember it being clean and safe while having an nice neighborhood energy - it was nice to see that hasn't changed. There are plenty of cafe, restaurant and shopping options within just blocks which makes this a great location to stay, be near the amenities without being in the heart of downtown.

While I only stayed for a matter of hours (had am early work meeting the following morning), I look forward to staying at Robert's property again any time I head up to the Emerald City. A truly top shelf experience!"
1775016,42114682,2015-08-11,1211060,Kyle,We had a great stay at Robert's beautiful home in Capitol Hill. The location is perfect and the room itself is clean and private. Highly recommended!
1775016,42417531,2015-08-13,11970057,Simone,"Rob was traveling while we stayed at his home but communication was easy and he provided all of the information we needed to enjoy our stay. The outdoor patio space was incredible and the suite was beautifully decorated and comfortable. Capitol Hill neighborhood was the absolute best neighborhood to stay in, with tons of great restaurants, bars and coffee shops."
1775016,42725165,2015-08-15,37940104,Lauren,"Robert's house was a great place to stay during our trip to Seattle. We were able to check in with him earlier in the day to go over everything since he wasn't going to be at the house when we arrived. Parking was very easy, the house is absolutely beautiful and our room and bathroom were both incredibly clean and comfortable. The location was great;  less than a 10 minute walk to downtown, and the Capitol Hill area was nice. Robert was very accommodating and friendly and we felt right at home. We would definitely recommend staying here!"
1775016,43229594,2015-08-18,33756007,Vanessa,"I had a wonderful time staying in the Master Suite A in Capitol Hill.
The home was clean, comfortable and tastefully decorated. The neighborhood is also great and I highly recommend it. There are a lot of shops and diverse restaurants just a few blocks away (about 7 min walking distance). I personally recommend Top Pot for a morning coffee and doughnut. You'll feel like a local!"
1775016,43763163,2015-08-22,33756007,Vanessa,"I had a wonderful stay in Master Suite A! Rob was very responsive and the home was comfortable, clean, and beautifully renovated. The neighborhood is quirky with a lot of diverse restaurants just a short walk away. I highly recommend Top Pot for a morning doughnut and coffee. You'll feel right at home and like a local!"
1775016,45810113,2015-09-06,39877837,Elie,Great experience. Everything was very clean and nice. 
1775016,46134767,2015-09-08,2885218,Ainsley,"Rob and his Capitol Hill abode where both gems! Beautiful room, central location to all things Seattle and Rob was responsive and kind to (what turned out to be) many questions :) Thanks Rob!"
1775016,46490198,2015-09-11,6052811,Ivo,"We had a really nice stay at Roberts place, which is located in a great neighborhood at walking distance from the city centre and broadway street. It's a really quiet and clean place. With great soft bed's. The host, Robert, is also nice and provides you with tips. I would definitely recommend it.  "
1775016,47243731,2015-09-17,15100838,Andrew,"Nice house, great location!"
1775016,48484684,2015-09-26,11515003,Becky,"It was a lovely place to stay, with lots of living space. Robert made us feel welcome.
The bed looks bigger in the picture than it is. I believe it is a queen, and a comfortable one at that."
1775016,48710003,2015-09-28,40297838,Marissa,"This home is exactly as described.  The property is beautiful and comfortable.  Robert was a great host--provided a few recommendations, but otherwise respected our privacy.  He also provided detailed instructions for accessing the home and the bedroom which help minimize any stress/confusion.  The location is wonderful--a few blocks (uphill) to the main street in Capitol Hill."
1775016,49033610,2015-09-30,43212280,Dave,"Robert made checking in a breeze and respected our privacy during our stay. The property was well cared for and the house was clean and inviting. There were toiletries (Q-Tips, shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste, etc..) and a hairdryer available along with an empty closet for any storage we may have needed. Robert also offered a parking pass to us, which in the neighbourhood is necessary. Overall, it was a great location and he was a wonderful host. "
1775016,49294719,2015-10-02,103474,Heidi,"Robert's set-up couldn't be better for a business traveler - his home has all the comforts and privacy of a hotel, with the bonus of being in a hip neighborhood where you can walk to great bars and restaurants. Each bedroom having its own bathroom is great and he was very accommodating about letting me use his fridge to store food. The bed was a rad hard for my taste, but for hose hat prefer firm mattresses, it will be perfect. Beautiful home, great experience- would stay again!"
1775016,49700380,2015-10-05,18049364,Keith,"Robert's place was a pleasure to stay at. The neighborhood is phenomenal - his place is within walking distance of plenty of bars and restaurants, and we were able to park within a couple blocks of the house. Felt like we had a true Seattle experience for a couple first-timers. "
1775016,49973425,2015-10-08,36646889,Dan,Listing description was accurate and neighborhood was good. Rob was friendly and greeted me at the door.
1775016,50449766,2015-10-12,6916499,Gina,"Robert wasn't there, so our only housemates were other Airbnbers, but he sent very detailed instructions before we arrived. Our bedroom was large and sunny and the en-suite bathroom was really nice.  Reliable wifi. Beautiful house in a quiet, neighborhoody part of Capitol Hill."
1775016,50928491,2015-10-16,27189136,Dennis,"If you are looking for a nice quiet place to stay, I highly recommend Robert's home. The house is exactly as it appears in the photographs and has a real warm, homely feeling to the place. The suburb of Capitol Hill is a quiet area and I loved the row of businesses just a 1 minute walk from the house. The pizza shop has great tasting pizzas and if your thirsty for a beverage, Summit Public House next door has some great beers to taste. A short walk to Broadway Avenue will find you making a decision on what restaurants to dine at.
Although Robert wasn't there on my arrival and for my stay, he advised me on what was required and this was very helpful and everything ran smoothly. 
Thankyou Robert for presenting a beautiful property!!!"
1775016,51433127,2015-10-20,39873842,Patrick,Robert's gracious home and the well-equipped Master Suite A was the perfect roost for our Seattle trip. We especially appreciated the huge walk-in closet and super-convenient Apple TV. Robert was a great host and provided very thorough communication/details before our stay. The tree-lined Capitol Hill location is beautiful and well-situated if you wish to truly experience Seattle life like a local. Definitely visit nearby Top Pot for sinful doughnuts and a fine latte in the morning. And a trek to Monsoon on 19th Avenue East is well worth it for a memorable dinner when in town.  
1775016,55633078,2015-12-03,49749771,Dennis,We arrived a little late. Robert was there to greet us and give us a quick introduction. The home was clean and comfortable and represented what was advertised.
1775016,56217068,2015-12-10,1603334,Michael,"This was our second stay at Roberts place. We love the central location, ease of access,  and warm environment. Robert is a great communicator and always quick to respond.  Thanks again Robert! "
8611952,51497690,2015-10-20,46247934,Lucy,"The Phinneywood Bungalow was perfect! It is located within walking distance of many shops, restaurants, and cafes on Greenwood Ave, as well as the beautiful Greenlake! There are plenty of cross walks & safe ways to cross 99/Aurora Ave to get Greenlake for walking/running/picnic/etc. The house is very welcoming. The kitchen/dining areas are large yet cozy, as well as the living spaces. It was very clean upon arrival, and had everything we needed for our 5 day stay in Seattle. It was was easy to get around to other neighborhoods in Seattle from Phinneywood, too! Sea To Sky rentals was very easy to work with. They were super accommodating, even when there was a technology glitch within AirBnB with booking. They are very communicative and transparent with the listing as well as the directions for arrival/departure. We plan on returning to Phinneywood Bungalow! "
496074,1960492,2012-08-12,3093052,Friederike,This was our first ever experience with airbnb. We really enjoyed our stay at Liza's apartment. It was clean and had more than enough room to sleep three people. Even though this is Liza's first time being a host she did a great job. Whenever we saw each other she always made sure that everything was alright in the apartment. We will definitely stay at her place again next time we'll be in Seattle. I will also recommend her place to any of my friends and family planning on visiting Seattle.  
496074,2125640,2012-08-28,3075056,Nicolette,Lovely MIL apartment...very clean and well appointed. In a fantastic location and very nice and quiet! I found this place for my father to stay during our wedding weekend and he left feeling very relaxed! 
496074,2407760,2012-09-25,490721,Jennifer,"Liza was a great host!  She has great recommendations.  I particularly loved the salmon at Ballard Locks, the Theo Chocolate Tour and walking around Greenlake.

The MIL is clean, decorated very tastefully and quite spacious for a city apartment.

The neighborhood is great.  I had a car and found it so easy to explore the city.  I was amazed at the relative ease of parking almost everywhere (compared to other cities I have lived).  

I would recommend (email hidden)!

"
496074,2618724,2012-10-15,3655953,Cindy,"We had a great (email hidden) apartment!  Location is fantastic for walking to restaurants, shops and interesting urban neighborhoods. Liza was super helpful by listing local information for food and outings.  Apartment is very spacious with well appointed kitchen.  Everything exceeded our expectations!          
"
496074,2661979,2012-10-20,2273304,Lucie,Great spacious place. We stayed here with or 2.5 year old toddler and our 4 month old for 2 nights. It's in a great location and very close to the zoo and with a great host. We'll be back when we are in the area again.. oh and and the chocolate was yum!
496074,2895683,2012-11-16,3846416,Cristina,"I really enjoyed to stay at Liza's place. She was a great host and make me feel at home. The apartment was clean and comfortable. The neighborhood is very nice and in a short walk to you have bus stops, grocery shop, restaurants and pubs. 
I'll definitively come back to Liza's place next time I come to Seattle!!!"
496074,2991430,2012-11-29,3956964,Roger,"I enjoyed my eight day (email hidden) Garden Apt.    I met Liza and Morgen and they were excellent hosts.  

The location is great.  Plenty of places nearby (easy walking distance) for dining, walking in a park, having a beer, shopping, etc.   Parking was easy in this residential area and everyone I met was friendly and helpful.  

The apartment was huge. This included a fully equipped  kitchen, a roomy bedroom, a large room for hanging out, reading, dining, etc (also includes a futon), a nice living room and a private bath room.  There is a private entrance, as well.  

All in all, everything went very well and and the experience was just what I had hoped for.  I will certainly recommend it to Airbnb (and to any of my friends visiting Seattle).  I definitely plan to stay there in the future."
496074,3112929,2012-12-18,4161850,Jesse,"
What a wonderful space Liza has created. Our hosts were warm and generous. The apartment is very comfortable and inviting. Our three year old daughter has a history of not being able to sleep in hotels which has made travel difficult for us. When we entered the apartment our daughter loved it and kept calling it ""our new house"" and she was so comfortable that she slept with no problem at all. We were a little worried about noise from upstairs but the sounds were very minimal and we hardly noticed. The apartment is very clean and has everything you could need. The neighborhood is charming, safe and an excellent location. We went to some local restaurants recommended by our host and were very happy. We look forward to staying there again in the future and would recommend it to anyone. "
496074,3163644,2012-12-27,1200767,Stanley,"The apartment was well appointed and very clean.  In a neighborhood where parking is hard to come by, we found it available when we needed it.  We met Liza on only one occasion.  She was very pleasant, hospitable and knowledgeable about Seattle in general and Finney/Ballard in particular."
496074,3556324,2013-02-16,3839130,Ted,"Liza's place is really comfortable.  I stayed a week and I'd definitely stay here again when I'm next in Seattle.  Phinney Ridge is a fun neighbourhood, with lots of restaurants and coffee shops.  Liza was really attentive, immediately solving the two small problems I had. The apartment is decorated with a lot of fun art.   And do read the story on page 179 of ""What to Read in the Rain""."
496074,3740575,2013-03-10,5245352,Erin,"I rented this apartment for my mom and her friend for a week while they were visiting their grandchildren. It is a charming apartment and very comfortable. It was perfect for them. LIza is a wonderful host and we worked together to arrange a late check in. In addition, when my mom left something behind Liza notified us right away even before my mom left town. We highly recommend this garden apartment!"
496074,3930374,2013-03-28,4896037,Karolin,"We had a great visit in Phinney Ridge! The apartment was exactly what was advertised, and Liza was very helpful and responsive in every way. We were sorry that we didn't have the opportunity to meet her though.  It was perfect for our little family of four - and would definitely come back for another visit! Thank you so much! "
496074,4149068,2013-04-14,4313222,Eli,"My partner and I spent a week here when I was recording an album at a nearby studio. Here's our pluses and minuses:
+ : Lots of space for two people at an affordable rate, complete kitchen, cozy clawfoot tub, free street parking, books and games, nice neighborhood to walk around, close to Green Lake, decent amount of sun for a basement unit, very friendly to us gay/queer folks, Liza was a good communicator and responded right away when I got locked out
- : The sound isolation between this apartment and the rest of the house upstairs is not very good, and they ask for a 9 pm noise curfew. So we felt we needed to be very quiet and keep our volume low when watching tv on our laptop at night, and we could hear the nine-year-old singing and tromping around in the mornings. (Her noise didn't bother us, but you might want to know.) The bed was a double but felt smaller than my double bed at home, and combined with a rather soft mattress and a creaky bed frame, my light-sleeping partner had a hard time getting a full night's sleep. Only one key was provided for two people. The house has a no guest policy. (We enjoyed our stay, but we figured these are some things others might want to know when considering whether this is a good spot for them.)"
496074,4284141,2013-04-24,3956964,Roger,"This was my  second visit to Liza and Megen's home.  They are excellent hosts!  The apartment is large, comfortable and fully equipped.  Spring had arrived and the tulips were in bloom in the garden.  The area is residential, quiet and friendly.  Close by are good eateries, a beautiful park (Green Lake) and, as an added attraction, I also visited the nearby Seattle Zoo with my daughter and granddaughter.
All in all,  another fine experience.  "
496074,4552894,2013-05-12,5697261,Laureen,"We loved this location and the apartment was awesome.  There were only two of us, but this apartment would be perfect for a family with a couple of kids or teenagers.  ONly one bedroom but there are three futon style couches.  Kitchen was great.  Location was really great for access to Green Lake and Ballard too, with all the great restaurants there.  And still very easy access to downtown Seattle.  We highly recommend Liza's lovely apartment."
496074,4829219,2013-05-28,1016652,Brian,"We visited Liza's apartment with a group of four siblings, and it was not only large enough for all of us but also the location was perfect! Our plan was to explore Ballard and Freemont, and we got a chance to do both over the course of our stay. It was also very easy to get downtown when we wanted to. Great to have a full kitchen for breakfasts and takeout with the family. Loved the vintage style of the furnishings - very cool! I don't think the pictures do this place justice - it's even better than it looks! Plenty of space and a great place to stay when in Seattle. Liza was a very helpful and communicative host. Thank you!"
496074,5127588,2013-06-14,652306,Evan,"Liza was a great host--communicative and very respectful of our privacy.  All our communications were done via text and email until we happened to run into each other a few weeks into my stay.  Her apartment is convenient to two buses (one that goes north and south, the other east and west) and is in a quiet neighborhood.  The apartment itself was bigger than I thought it was going to be from the listing, very comfortable, and clean.  I would stay here again."
496074,5206913,2013-06-18,5570194,Valley,"We absolutely loved staying here!  It is spacious and beautifully appointed.  Lots of wonderful extras including some special touches just for our daughter including books, games and puzzles.  The claw foot tub was deep and wonderful.  The bed felt a tad small but that is probably just because I am used to sleeping in a king, it was very soft and comfortable though.  The kitchen had everything we needed to cook meals and even included some wonderful coffee.  It is obvious that Liza put a lot of thought into this space adding little extras like chocolate from a local company and lots of brochures and flyers from local sights and restaurants.  We will definitely be back! "
496074,5563319,2013-07-06,6816422,Matthew,"We were in Seattle visiting friends and had a wonderful time at Liza's place. We were so close to the zoo, bus lines and great restaurants. Yet the apartment was nice and quiet. Phinney Ridge is such a great neighborhood. My kids loved all the games and books and my wife and I loved having a nice kitchen and comfortable beds for the 4 of us. This was the perfect home base for us. An added bonus was Liza's daughter. The kids and her hit it off right away. It was great for them to have an instant friend while we were so far away. We would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
496074,5753983,2013-07-15,5855667,Carl & Pam,"Liza was unable to be there as she was back east helping her mom. She left us the keys a ""secret"" place. and we let ourselves in. We were in her down stairs apartment. It was clean and surprisingly large. The kitchen had everything we needed. It is also not far from everything we wanted to see. We enjoyed our stay.  We had lunch at the Phinney Market Bar and Grill. Was excellent!"
496074,5909166,2013-07-22,6533985,Joseph,"We really enjoyed our five-day stay at Liza's place.  It was very cozy and more spacious than we thought from looking at the photos. The apartment was clean, new and nicely decorated with some whimsical artwork.  The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful.  We were able to try some of Liza's recommendations, such as Red Mill Burgers and Bluebird Ice Creamery.  Both were excellent and close by.  The apartment is conveniently located to points of interest in downtown Seattle as well as attractions up north.  Our kids felt really at home and didn't want to leave.  If we visit Seattle again, we would definitely choose to stay at Liza's place."
496074,6462791,2013-08-13,7252076,Per,"This dwelling is good sized, cute, and easily accessible. The side entrance was convenient and the parking was a dream. The kitchen was stocked with morning drinks and even some birthday cake ice cream! In the bathroom, there were some toiletries, which was nice because we forgot a couple of things. On the sidewalk on the corner, there is some really fun key art. The neighbors are pleasant and we didn’t hear anything from upstairs at all during our stay. "
496074,6910598,2013-08-30,3381564,Toby,The apartment was exactly what we were looking for. A self-contained apartment with a separate entrance. The apartment is below the main house but there was no noise or disturbance. I would strongly recommend this place to anyone.
496074,7169988,2013-09-09,3269059,Cherylyn,"We had a great stay at Liza's Phinney Ridge apartment. It was quiet and clean, very spacious and perfect for our needs. Liza was a great host. She came down to greet us and she gave us some guides to the area and let us know that there would be some extra noise upstairs while they were vacuuming (which was fine since it was the middle of the day). 

Phinney Ridge is a great area with tons of stuff within walking distance. Liza told us about a Farmer's Market and we were able to walk to it on Friday. She left us notes about some great places to eat (if you stay here, you should really try the crepes at the Ridgeback Cafe) and there was plenty to see and do during our stay.

The bed at Liza's was comfortable, everything in the kitchen was nice, she provided games in the living room and she really thought of everything to make it a great stay. We did hear the dogs upstairs from time to time, but there was no noise at night or in the early mornings which allowed us to get plenty of sleep. I wouldn't hesitate to stay with Liza again. "
496074,7496609,2013-09-22,6519545,Siobhan,"This is a beautiful and comfortable space with a really nice feel to both the house and garden. I enjoyed my time here as it is a peaceful neighborhood and yet still within walking distance from good stores and restaurants. Liza put a lot of thought into the decor/facilities of the apartment and I really appreciated the well-stocked kitchen. 

Although I was here on my own, this is a great space for a family and would recommend it highly to any visitors to Seattle."
496074,7605155,2013-09-26,2701270,Nancy,"I had an awesome stay at Liza's place.  Her place is huge for 2 people.  The kitchen is very well equipped. Liza even dropped off fresh tomatoes and cucumber from her garden.  Her house is located in a very nice and safe neighborhood. It is about 12-14 minutes drive to UW and very close to markets and neighbor shops. Never had a problem finding parking right outside the apartment.  

Higher recommend her place and would definitely be back.  Thanks Liza and Morgan!"
496074,8758795,2013-11-16,373340,Casey,"Liza's Phinney apartment was incredibly cozy, inviting, and private.  The space was well appointed, and it was very clear that Liza had thought about her guests' needs.  Phinney Ridge is a great area, and I look forward to staying again next time i'm back in the area for work.
"
496074,8908639,2013-11-25,9745937,Lisa,"The apartment was a great jumping off spot for our family of 4 for a week of play, vacation and work!  We look forward to a chance to come again soon!"
496074,9069183,2013-12-04,3956964,Roger,"This was my third visit with Liza and her family (usually for a one week stay).  Liza is an ideal hostess, making sure that everything is just right and providing information in such areas as good pizza locations, public transportation and Ballard/Phinney Ridge landmarks such as the famous Ballard Locks and Salmon Ladder.  I visit the Locks and Ladder on every trip.  I like the apartment; it is private, spacious and well equipped.  It is located in a quiet area of Ballard and there are numerous restaurants, coffee shops, brew pubs within easy walking distance.  
All in all, the Spacious Garden Apartment is ideal for my needs in Seattle.  I look forward to visiting again.
"
496074,9497040,2013-12-31,10113969,Laura,"This trip was to surprise my mom for her birthday/Christmas present. Of course, she knew about the trip, but she didn't know about my two brothers visiting, too. Now, I have a very small house here in Seattle, so I was unable to accommodate my family for our first holiday in 20+ years. Liza's place was a great location for them. The place was clean, well taken care of, and quiet. My family loved it as they had a comfortable place to sleep and hang out. 
Thanks, Liza, for making this trip possible!"
496074,11233209,2014-03-25,12561,Diane,"Liz's basement apt is our favorite place to stay in Seattle!  We come up yearly to visit our son, and have used 2 other airbnb apartments.  We won't be staying anywhere else from now on!  It was spacious, warm and inviting!  It had plenty of light, and was just right for our group of 4!  The neighborhood is great, and parking was never a problem...there was always space on the street right by the apt!  There's a little noise from upstairs on weekday mornings, but it didn't bother us, as it was happy, family noise!  Great place!"
496074,11938046,2014-04-19,6475297,Kim,"My husband stayed here while visiting our daughters and was very comfortable! Quiet, accommodating and spacious--he said he will be back. He did say that the main bed was about the size of a double and thought it might be small for the both of us but there is a futon in the other room to spread out. Liza was responsive and very accommodating and we will def use this location again!"
496074,12102574,2014-04-22,14362977,Allison,Very spacious and pleasant apartment in a great neighborhood.  My in-laws had a wonderful stay!

We really enjoyed the location, with many great bars and restaurants within an easy walk. Ballard is fairly accessible, too. We'll definitely look to stay again on our next trip to Seattle. "
496074,13768546,2014-06-03,12485935,Phoebe,"Great place to stay in Seattle. The apartment was spacious and clean. Loved the claw foot bathtub! Really nice neighborhood, with a lot of coffee shops and restaurants to choose from within walking distance. "
496074,14129440,2014-06-12,8375005,Mari,"We enjoyed our stay in Liza's daylight basement. The neighborhood was very quiet and the parking was close and easy. The space was readily accessible and was supplied with everything we needed. Our grandchildren enjoyed the small play area in the yard and Liza was very friendly with them and us. We enjoyed the crepes at Ridgeback Crepe Cafe on Morgen's recommendation. We also bought 2 pr of shoes at Sneakery just a few blocks away. We highly recommend Liza's spot for a comfortable and ease of parking and accessibility.

496074,14737239,2014-06-25,12099448,Mark,"I very much enjoyed my stay at Liza's MIL apartment. It was my first time in Seattle and the location was perfect. Quiet, safe neighborhood with plenty of shops, restaurants and bars within walking distance. Parking was no problem if you have a car. The apartment was spacious and honestly felt like home. I would stay here again for sure!"
496074,15752740,2014-07-15,433886,Nanci,"liza was a great host! she made us feel very welcome, but also gave us privacy. the neighborhood was very nice, safe, and friendly. easy to find from airport with gps, not a problem. the pictures are very accurate. and the space is actually bigger than it looks. it was extremely clean, and tidy. we had everything we needed. the futon was very comfy. and the bed as well. we had a short, but very nice stay. thanks again liza! "
496074,15892501,2014-07-17,2755718,Nick,The garden apartment in Phinney Ridge was perfect. It's in an amazing location just a few blocks from restaurants and bars. We did not get the chance to cook but everything is there for you. When i come back to Seattle this is the place to stay!
496074,16083703,2014-07-22,755518,Spenser,"The garden apt was a great place to stay for us in a nice area with plenty of sleeping room for three. The listing was accurate and Liza was upfront and clear about everything involving the stay.

Highly recommended!"
496074,16603746,2014-07-30,13575849,Fred,"We had a great stay in the garden apartment. The apartment was spacious with a living room, bedroom and bedroom/living room and with a great kitchen for cooking.  We stayed with our whole family (2 adults/2 children) and it was definitely much better than a hotel. The neighborhood is nice and quiet with great restaurants. The kids loved the woodland zoo/phinney ridge playground. "
496074,17161622,2014-08-08,17242997,Liza,"Staying at Liza's wonderful walk-out basement suit was such a treat. Not only was the space comfortable and clean, but it was in the best location. The neighborhood has so much character and is surrounded by the best cafe's and restaurants (follow Liza's recommendations!). I would definitely stay here again. "
496074,17818016,2014-08-18,13761520,Ghislaine,"Very Private, did not meet Liza. The neighborhood is very hilly so a good work out if you are working but lots of fresh air. Nice lake to also visit. Loved the apples rolling down the hills. "
496074,18179914,2014-08-23,9543697,Kari,"I did not get to meet Liza, but all was as described. This is a great location with great food choices. Thanks for having us."
496074,18349902,2014-08-25,19451161,Mark,"My daughter and I enjoyed our stay at Liza's place.  Liza was easy to communicate with and offered helpful suggestions for nearby restaurants and things to do.  The place was clean, spacious and comfortable, and we enjoyed several of the restaurants and cafes that Liza recommended.  We would definitely stay here again."
496074,18566291,2014-08-28,7525438,Dan,"The garden apartment had an excellent location, it was indeed spacious, and it worked out perfectly for us! We didn't get to meet Liza, as she was out of town, but she was communicative via text and helped us have a great time in her place. Recommended!"
496074,18885420,2014-09-02,17132143,Tom,"My wife and I had a wonderful stay at Liza's! The apartment was very clean and wonderfully decorated.  When you first walk in she has several guidebooks, maps, and magazines on Seattle that are very helpful.  The neighborhood is charming to walk around.  Highly recommend staying here."
496074,19521163,2014-09-14,17925133,Sinead,"We just returned from spending 8 nights in Liza's Garden apartment in Phinney.  The location was perfect for us as it was near family, but it's also just a very cool location.  The apartment was also perfect for our needs.  We traveled with our three year old son who loved the children's books that Liza has left on her bookshelves.  There was also plenty of room for an active three year old to fill in his time in the limited time we spent there.  We were pretty much gone from early in the morning to late evening, but what was wonderful and I guess I had not examined the property enough to see this, was that there are actually three rooms, so we had my son sleep on the futon in the room that has the front door.  Then there there is another sitting room that adjoins the kitchen and bathroom and off the sitting room is the bedroom.  We did not cook at all, but we did use the fridge for snacks, fruit, water and growlers of delicious local beer.  I would highly recommend the property.  "
496074,20206853,2014-09-25,21223330,Roxana,Liza's place was absolutely lovely. She made sure that everything was prepared and ready for our arrival. Her neighborhood was quiet and we felt safe. Parking and access to the property was easy with good access to places of interest. I would definitely recommend staying here.
496074,27428628,2015-03-04,26050520,John,"Liza, your room(s) were very clean and neat. I will return to your BnB when I visit my son in the future. John Brennan
    Ps. I did not see ice cube trays."
496074,27901676,2015-03-14,28876076,Dwight,This was our first AirBNB booking .  The description of the apartment was accurate and the apartment is in a very pleasant neighborhood.  Checking in was very easy.  The bed is very good and the neighborhood is overall quiet.

Enjoyed it.
"
496074,29784048,2015-04-12,28657344,Tori,"The apartment was lovely! There was plenty of street parking within close walking distance always. We really enjoyed having a space that felt like a home away from home. The kitchen had all the essentials, and the tub in the bathroom is gorgeous. Very comfy bed, and plenty of room for the three people in our group to each have their own place to sleep with cozy bedding. Would love to stay here again! "
496074,30497756,2015-04-23,27959962,Margaret,"Liza's apartment was exactly what I needed. Above all it was clean.
I was traveling alone and there was never a moment when I did not feel secure and comfortable. 
There were ample blankets, towels, hot water and the bed was extremely comfortable.
The neighborhood was wonderful; whatever you wanted within a mile or less.
I would definitely recommend the Spacious Garden Apartment to fellow travelers."
496074,31549702,2015-05-06,31500450,Greg,"The Spacious Garden Apt is exactly as described by the host listing. Comfortable, clean, spacious, well-stocked with a separate entrance. Ample street parking for the rental car too. What more can you ask for? "

496074,32107925,2015-05-14,2140066,Heather,Liza's place was exactly what we were looking for in Seattle. Lovely comfortable space in a beautiful part of the city. Very quiet. Easy access to transport and places to eat and shop. Fun visit for us
496074,32522474,2015-05-19,14610599,Kathy,Great place to stay! Quiet neighborhood in a home away from home.
496074,33260028,2015-05-26,5501352,Joy,"What a great place to stay! Apartment was clean and walking distance to everything but a grocery store! Great quiet and friendly neighborhood with coffee shops and restaurants. We took walks multiple times a day as the weather was just perfect! The host was very kind and helpful, she even pointed us to a nearby bike shop when our stroller had a flat tire. The apartment was also suitable for a toddler as long as you're watching, with books and toys for kids. The tub was quite slippery and very slow to drain, it could use a removable bath mat for little ones. Everything else was perfect and as described in listing, we will recommend this house and would stay here again in the future! "
496074,34455340,2015-06-08,18119509,Benjamin,"We didn't see Liza, but the instructions for checking in and out were clear and concise.  The apartment was larger than we expected, and it was very clean and comfortable."
496074,35203357,2015-06-16,12561,Diane,"Liza was available for questions, recommendations (great little Phinney Ridge Farmer's Mkt!) and when we needed anything.  It's our 2nd time staying, and we love the light-filled space and the neighborhood! "
496074,36002972,2015-06-24,4038808,Patricia Et Michel,"très agréable maison dans un super quartier ! Liza est sympathique, tout comme la plupart des habitants de Seattle, toujours prêts à blaguer ou à aider les visiteurs un peu perdus. je garde un excellent souvenir de mon séjour..."
496074,36536221,2015-06-29,16594763,Amy,"The place was large, spacious, and very clean.  It received good natural sunlight.  The neighborhood was wonderful and walking distance to lots of good food and breweries.  

It was extremely easy to arrange key pick up and drop off with Liza.  I would definitely stay here again if I make it back to Seattle. "
496074,37045055,2015-07-04,13970025,Elizabeth,"The apartment really felt like our home and I've found myself missing it since we left. Liza was around and about, which felt comforting being in a brand new city, but she did her own thing and never made us feel like WE were in HER space. The space was ours, and it was lovely. One of our favorite activities was recommended to us by Liza: paddle-boating at the nearby lake. Staying here really endeared me to Seattle."
496074,37734675,2015-07-10,3860880,Ray,Welcoming and accurate
496074,38279782,2015-07-14,34053058,Christine,"Great neighborhood and very spacious, clean unit.  I didn't spend much time in the unit as I was in town for a wedding and spent my time with family members that were located throughout the city.  Thanks for a great stay!"
496074,39282230,2015-07-22,31242219,Robert,We enjoyed the garden apartment very much. It is well located and has all the amenities needed to provide a comfortable stay in beautiful Seattle. 
496074,39604619,2015-07-25,550347,Tina Hjulmann,Great stay at Lizas :) Spacious place in a very friendly area. 
496074,40443611,2015-07-31,25658377,Cameron,"Liza was very helpful before I came out. I was visiting Seattle to find a place as I am moving there soon. She gave me the contact information for two real estate agents in the area to help me get started. Her place was perfect, great location, very quiet and well-equipped. There were recommendations for restaurants and things to do in the area, maps, and more!"
496074,40940023,2015-08-03,30513906,Evan,"This charming apartment is part of a charming house, in a charming neighborhood in Seattle.  And though it is a garden apartment, noise was never an issue either on the street level, or from above.  The house is located in a beautiful neighborhood, filled with large arts and crafts houses and towering trees - a quintessential Seattle panorama.  The neighborhood's main drag is only three blocks away and is lined with with cafes, bookstores, restaurants and bars.  And if you're curious about the goings-on, Liza has arranged an extensive packet of information containing lists of places to visit and special events, festivals, and farmer's markets in the area. "
496074,41931595,2015-08-10,31767878,Hans,We had a very nice stay.  The check in process was easy as it could be.  The place was in a great location.  The only negative was the comfort of the bed.
496074,42518710,2015-08-14,27338623,Leonard (Lenny),"The home fit our needs, with plenty of room and a full kitchen in an easy location.  We did not get a chance to meet Liza."
496074,43480061,2015-08-20,14225176,Raymond,"We were in e-mail contact prior to our arrival and the arrangements worked well even if we did not meet up with Liza.The basement apartment was comfortable and very spacious with lots of natural light.Access to restaurants, shops and facilities on Greenwood Ave and Phinney Ave is just 5 minutes walk away, albeit uphill. A pleasant ,well kept, residential neighbourhood. "
496074,44543868,2015-08-27,16340112,Derek,"We really enjoyed staying here and it was much bigger than we expected. The kitchen was convenient ant had everything we needed to prepare meals. The neighborhood is very awesome but quite hilly, so be prepared to hike if you wanna walk around. We will definitely stay here again next time we visit Seattle."
496074,47699211,2015-09-21,2881715,Lydia,Thank you Liza for sharing your home!  The whole experience was so easy and your home is not only spacious but warm and welcoming.
496074,48555622,2015-09-27,31422530,Will,"We had a great experience with Liza. Everything in the apartment was exactly as advertised and we had no hassle whatsoever. The location is great, with Green Lake a short walk away and a bus stop very close by (to get to Downtown Seattle). We would certainly recommend staying with Liza. Thank you."
496074,49036613,2015-09-30,21804491,Mike,"Liza's place is absolutely fantastic. Spacious, beautifully appointed, peaceful-everything you could hope for. I would say it was in fact better than advertised even. Neighborhood is beautiful and quiet and mounted away from all sorts of fun things to do in Ballard and Magnolia. I was here on business-my only regret was not being able to take more time to explore the city. Would definitely stay again when and if work takes me there. "
496074,49992827,2015-10-08,6110478,Ester,"Liza provided a smooth check-in. We texted upon arrival to confirm the exact check-in time. We loved the apartment for it's location (close to the family we were visiting), it's quiet neigbourhood and the facilities provided. It was easy to find a parking spot.

The apartment has it's own entrance, giving complete freedom of when to arrive and when to leave. Two spacious sitting areas, a bedroom, kitchen and a bathroom. In summer you can also enjoy sitting outside.

Two recommandation we would give for this apartment:
We would have loved the bed to be a bit bigger, for two it prove to be quiet small. And second: the lack of curtains in the two sitting areas. It would have given us a bit more privacy. Especially in the evenings we felt people could easily peek inside.

Apart from that, the facilities provided were good and made our stay nice, easy and confortable.
"
496074,51554344,2015-10-21,44901858,Emma,We had a lovely stay in the air b'n'b. The rooms were spacious and was perfect for our needs. There are bars and places to eat up a short hill. Public transport is good to to downtown if you don't have a car. 
496074,54268690,2015-11-17,35773215,Omar,"Cozy place, nice location. Liza was very helpful in providing access after hours. Very clean apartment, beautiful bathroom, quiet. Would stay again!"
714043,2491612,2012-10-02,883300,Sabrina,"We loved staying at Aexis' Greenlake Sky Loft! Even though we booked last minute, the whole process was seamless. The space has a great feel about it -- Spanish tiled floors, high ceilings, and cool artwork on the walls.  For three people, we had more than enough room. So much that on our last night, we decided to ditch our dinner reservation and order take-out instead. Would definitely book again! "
714043,2572539,2012-10-10,3470753,Samantha,"This was a great place to stay! The views were incredible, you could see Mt. Ranier from the bedroom window. The accommodations were very nice - convenient to get to Ballard and downtown on the bus. If you're a runner, Green Lake was a fantastic path and very close to the house. Would stay here again.  "
714043,2999927,2012-12-01,3692763,Andrew,"My family of three stayed in the Greenlake Sky Loft for almost six weeks just after moving to Seattle.  The location is fantastic, the space is very comfortable, and the hosts are amazingly accommodating and very knowledgeable about the area and Seattle generally.  Our transition to Seattle went very smoothly, in large part to our stay in the Greenlake Sky Loft.  "
714043,3138869,2012-12-23,3620162,Danny,We stayed for two weeks in December. Aexis and Alexis were very responsive hosts and the apartment provided a nice and spacious retreat from the winter weather. Thanks guys! 
714043,3173563,2012-12-28,215230,Carol,"My daughter was coming to visit from Florida so we wanted something special for her to enjoy in Seattle and a place to gather in for holiday 
sharing. The Skyloft was very inspiring with art and sky views. The kitchen
was handy for our breakfasts and lunches and we took her to favorite 
cafes around the neighborhoods too. A great location for shopping too,
near Northgate Mall and movie house."
714043,3851474,2013-03-20,942826,Matt,The reservation was canceled 24 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
714043,5071368,2013-06-10,182423,Tom,"A really interesting space- we loved the large, art studio like room with the 12 foot ceilings. I really felt like we were staying in a unique, Seattle loft. Aexis was very helpful and kind, quickly finding us a few items we needed. We'll be back!"
714043,6146929,2013-08-01,6004816,Cynthia,"This is a perfect spot to have a neighborhood experience!  The location is adjacent to a central business area where there are grocery stores, coffee joints, bars, and restaurants -- all within walking distance.  The loft itself could not be nicer:  spacious rooms and all mod cons with a quirkiness and flair that made it a delight.  The stairs take some getting used to but are well worth the effort and the deck is particularly nice in the summertime.  Aexis and Lex could not have been nicer and more gracious to a visitor!  From initial kitchen provisions to the addition of an iron to a last-minute lift into the city to an effort to fix a computer document  to help with my luggage -- their thoughtfulness and desire to make my visit comfortable made my long stay the more enjoyable!  I'll be back!"
714043,6708320,2013-08-22,3178735,Chris,"The sky loft is a comfortable place in a great location. The neighborhood is eminently walkable; we got to choose between the  up-and-coming cooltown feel of Greenwood, the charm (and farmers market!) in Phinney, and the beautiful park around Green Lake. Aexis couldn't have been more helpful, and we had everything we needed to settle in. She even set up a special nook for our 9-year-old, which he absolutely loved. A wonderful way to spend 2 weeks!"
714043,6851681,2013-08-27,5134211,Lisa,"My daughter and I had a wonderful time at ""Skyloft""!  Aexis and her new husband were there to greet us and help with bags, then we did not see them until we left, when our bags were once again carried (that was above and beyond, I thought).  The place was clean, very roomy, comfortable, and felt totally private with many nice touches.  As our first airbnb experience, it was perfect.  I would highly recommend this place for anyone who is coming to Seattle.  "
714043,6991079,2013-09-02,261612,Alisha,"I had such a wonderful experience at Aexis' place. It was quiet and comfortable, and very close to two of my favorite neighborhoods in Seattle: greenlake and phinney ridge. During my stay I enjoyed several great walks, had some good coffee, and just chilled. It was exactly what I was looking for.  "
714043,8218174,2013-10-21,1585497,Teresa,"Convenient location and nice space, with all the amenities of home.  Aexis and her husband were great hosts and quite attentive.  My only concern is that if you are there for work and need to get to sleep early, or even if you want to sleep in and are a lighter sleeper, the place is on a busy street, which happens to be a main thoroughfare to get to the freeway."
714043,8420664,2013-10-29,890406,Johanna,"My sister,  daughter and I had a fun,  quick girl's weekend at the Greenlake Sky Lodge.  The spacious yet cozy space was perfect. We  really appreciated the added touch of fresh bread our host left for us.  I enjoyed all of the windows bringing in copious amount of light on a rainy morning.  I hope to stay here again! "
714043,11290896,2014-03-28,10816527,Lisa,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Greenlake Sky Loft, and we couldn't have asked for a better visit. It was cozy with plenty of space, complete with everything we needed, close enough to experience downtown, and quiet - exactly what we needed. The off-street parking spot was perfect for us, and Aexis and Alexis were great. They left a map and info about the area, so we could head out without trying to figure it all out on our own. 
We had the best time! We will definitely be back. "
714043,12692003,2014-05-08,709597,Melissa,"I had a first rate experience staying at the Sky Loft!  My bf and I spent nearly a month there as we were relocating to Seattle and looking for a house.   Aexis was accommodating and kind from start to finish.  The place was very clean, open and spacious, and had everything we needed.  The location is wonderful -- there are many great bars and restaurants nearby on Phinney Ridge, and Green Lake was a short 5 minute jog away.  I highly recommend staying at the Sky Loft! "
714043,13052868,2014-05-18,277071,Justin,"Stayed here for a week and absolutely loved the experience! 
The place is very cozy, good quality stove and cooking utensils, furnished very nicely and the huge patio is a great perk!  Parking was never an issue and the location is awesome!  The owners are great and even printed stuff for us when we needed (twice!).  
Highly recommend this place!!! "
714043,14752908,2014-06-25,14248230,Mauri,Great space + welcoming and responsive hosts!
714043,14888316,2014-06-28,2479220,Kevin,"The Sky Loft was a great space for my visit.  Aexis was a great hostess, and the space was neat and clean, with lots of light from the windows. There are lots of restaurant and food options nearby, and the proximity to my office worked really well.  Thank you!"
714043,15320204,2014-07-07,6203967,Shannon,"When you walk into the living room of the Skyloft during the day and light is streaming through all the windows, it's just breathtaking. This place is actually better than the pictures. The front space is airy and full of light, comfortable and relaxing. The bedroom is tucked away in the back and plenty cozy. In terms of location, you're walking distance to the E Line bus that'll shoot you right into downtown, then several bus stops for more local routes. You're a few blocks from Greenwood, which has restaurants, Safeway, Walgreen's, etc., and close to pretty much everything you'd need. 

Aexis and her husband are also two of the nicest people I've ever met. I was having problems with my computer connecting to the Wifi and they spent a lovely Saturday morning helping me fix it when it would've been a great morning to do anything BUT mess with computer stuff. They were always friendly and helpful when I needed them while not being hovering. Definitely two of the best people I've ever met. "
714043,17614558,2014-08-15,15342209,Susan,"The Greenlake Sky Loft is in a great location to explore Seattle and especially well placed to enjoy all the activities available at nearby Green Lake park, including kayaking, skating, jogging, and excellent people-watching. The E Line bus is half a block away and conveniently whisks you down to the most popular downtown tourist areas (e.g., Pike Place Market and the Space Needle), plus it is much more convenient than battling traffic and trying to find parking. I-5 is also very easily accessed for trips farther afield. The loft has a well-equipped kitchen with a great gas stove and every pan, dish, and utensil we needed - we made almost all our meals there for the five weeks we stayed. The washer & dryer were also very convenient. Seattle was unusually hot while we were there, with several 90 degree highs, so this third floor unit got pretty warm and stuffy on those days but fans and cross breezes from the windows helped a lot. Aexis and Alexis were both very friendly and Aexis sent email a couple times to make sure we had everything we needed. We never heard any noise from downstairs, except some music drifting up from Alexis's studio some afternoons, which was really a nice bonus and added to the feeling of actually living in a neighborhood. There was noise from the street at night, which we probably noticed more at this time of year because the heat required the windows to be opened, but those bothered by it could sleep in the main loft area instead of the bedroom. The main loft area was spacious and the high ceilings make it feel even larger than it is. There is a large private deck facing the back yard that was very peaceful, occasionally visited by squirrels and hummingbirds. We saw several spectacular sunsets from the deck and it was nicely shaded during the hottest part of the afternoon."
714043,17848400,2014-08-18,16861118,Brett,"This was an excellent place to stay! Very quiet and an awesome neighborhood that's very walkable with coffee shops, grocery stores, and bus stations quite close by. We never encountered any problems, and this made our honeymoon lovely and easy, thanks for everything!!!"
714043,18133616,2014-08-22,179787,Janice,"We had a wonderful stay in the Sky Loft and greatly appreciated all the welcoming touches Aex/Lex left for us. We've stayed in several Airbnbs and this was by far, the best stocked fridge and pantry that we've ever had! Our lovely hosts even found a high chair for our 13 month old to use. It was pretty warm while we were there, but with plenty of open windows and fans that were set up, the cross breezes and circulating air kept the temperature pleasant. 

The Sky Loft is in a great location, walking distance from lots of cool neighborhoods and Greenlake. We used to live in Seattle and were excited to be visiting again and checking out all the different coffee places, parks, and trails that abound in this wonderful city. And, of course, we took advantage of the proximity to PCC! 

If you are also traveling with little kids/babies and curious about how that worked out, read on! Aside from the steep flight of stairs (we had lots of gear to lug up!), it was great. The bedroom is small, but has plenty of room for a pack and play. The best part was that the bedroom is a little separated from the main living space, so when your kiddo goes to sleep early, you don't have to be totally quiet. There was also tons of great white noise for our little one because of the fan and traffic whooshing by. The floors are a bit hard, so we kept constant watch on our toddler, who just started walking a few weeks ago, but we pretty much have to do that all the time, anyway. =) She loved the ample floor space and the elevated kitchen. She kept going around and around in circles. It was also nice to be able to eat outside on the deck -- less clean up for our messy little one. And, of course, being able to do laundry in the unit itself is perfect! There were also plenty of extra linens and towels, which came in handy. No bathtub, but a pretty big kitchen sink where we were able to bathe our baby. Overall, and compared to other places we've stayed, a very family friendly home and location!"

Our host provided a very warm welcome, offered a ton of resources and was incredibly kind.  It was a wonderful stay! "
714043,18735968,2014-08-31,19002785,Sara,This is an amazing space! Aexis was a great host and had everything we needed from the start. She was very accommodating and available to us without being the slightest bit hover-y. I would recommend this home to everyone. It's convenient to everything and super affordable. Gold stars all around 
714043,20490533,2014-09-30,13096262,Naysa,"Aexis and Alexis are terrific hosts.  They were very flexible for us so my whole family felt welcome and were able to use the space as needed.  Greenlake is wonderful and the skyloft is a sanctuary  type space.  Although it's a bit of a trek up to it, once there anything you could need is at your fingertips.  I wish I hadn't been working so much during my stay as I didn't get to enjoy the deck or the artistic vibe as much as one could.  The biggest drawbacks for me were the street noise at night and the temperature fluctuations.  Aexis has fans strategically placed to combat (both?!) and the temp changes were partly due to the time of year I stayed here.  Overall it was a wonderful little apartment!  My dog and I truly didn't want to leave!!"
714043,20799402,2014-10-05,958049,Michelle,"Total eclipse of my heart! I truly loved the feel of the place. It was quiet, homey, and a super convenient walk to greenwood, a street with great coffee shops, breweries and tasty restaurants. I highly recommend The Yard Cafe. Aexis and Alexis where awesome..... If ya don't stay here your missing out!!!"
714043,21096952,2014-10-11,9354840,Jillian,"Cool space with a large deck, right near a bus stop that is about 20-25 minutes from downtown. Very easy to navigate from here."
714043,21624256,2014-10-20,22265736,Jacob,"Great place to stay. Very spacious and nicely furnished. The gas fireplace/heater is great. Totally cat friendly.  Very conveniently located; Greenlake is a lovely quiet neighborhood with an easy drive to everything in Seattle. Aexis is responsive and friendly, but also respected our privacy. We highly recommend this loft."
714043,34764713,2015-06-12,23717383,Jessica,"What an amazing space! We stayed at the Greenlake Sky Loft for 2 months and cant say a single bad thing about the experience!  Aexis and Alexis were very helpful and always available to answer any questions or provide recommendations for bars, restaurants, things to do, etc.  The loft was absolutely beautiful and had so much room, it was everything we expected and more!  The neighborhood was great as well! Just a short walk from the loft to many great restaurants and stores, and our favorite, Green Lake.  My husband, myself, and our two pets would definitely come back to this space and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a nice, relaxing place to visit."
714043,37829030,2015-07-11,3218156,Stephanie,"From the second we arrived Aexis. Made us feel welcome. We stayed for one month in the loft with no issues and enjoyed our time. Aexis provided everything we needed and more, she was there if needed but not intrusive in any way. We would gladly return."
714043,38434480,2015-07-15,10365805,Julia,"Our experience was good, Aexid was a great host."
714043,38733839,2015-07-18,504685,Liz,"These were probably the most thorough check in and how to get the most out of the space and the area instructions I've ever had at an Airbnb, really appreciate all the effort to make our stay easy and enjoyable."
714043,41619324,2015-08-08,33120457,Michelle,"Great, convenient location, walkable neighborhood, very comfortable accommodations. Would definitely stay here again!"
714043,42539792,2015-08-14,35737860,Elena,"Had a great stay and experience at the Greenlake Sky Loft. Lots to do that's a short walking distance away. There were some great recommendations for places to go listed on a sheet of paper near the door. There were bagels as well when we got in, which was bonus!"
714043,44304547,2015-08-25,17816276,Youngmin,"Aexis's house is kind of attic. So I love that place. I enjoyed sitting on a chair in patio. I can feel the cool and fresh air in the morning. At night, I can see the glistening stars. Aexis's house is spacious. I like the high ceiling and tile floor. The bed  is so cozy. I can sleep very well. Thanks to Aexis for yammy bagles and coffee. "
714043,53806688,2015-11-13,38932900,Todd,"I felt very welcome. Loved the neighborhood, and the Loft was perfect"
6838418,41125424,2015-08-04,38369740,Jaime,Awesome place to stay when visiting Seattle! Chris and Angela were great hosts and could not have been nicer! They offered us maps of the area as well as a must see list of Seattle attractions. They're in a great location-a 15 walk/a very cheap Uber  to downtown Seattle. Their apartment is very modern and clean. The room has a very comfortable bed that has a large private bathroom just across the hallway.  Make sure you check out their rooftop which has an amazing view of Mt. Rainer. I highly recommend staying here and would definitely stay here again when visiting Seattle! 
6838418,41259946,2015-08-05,32951502,Geoffrey,Chris and his girlfriend were really good hosts. They are really friendly. They have prepared a little planning with main activities and sightseeing places. The apartment is well located in a new district near from downtown. We spent a good moment in Chris's place. I advise.
6838418,41467136,2015-08-07,335486,Marco,"So, this is my first time Airb&bing.....I was in town for business so more out than in the unit. Chris' place worked out like a 5 stars hotel in downtown Seattle. Walking distance to the football and baseball stadium, yet in a neighborhood with a local flavor. the fire pit on the roof is the cherry on the cake!"
6838418,41650000,2015-08-08,38309765,Angela,"It's our first time to Seattle, Chris and Angela are really nice couple, they plan and advise a lot to us. the flat is very clean, near China town, very convenient to downtown. "
6838418,42450106,2015-08-13,38309765,Angela,"Chris and his girlfriend Angela treat us very well. They prepared a list for travelling in Seattle, and Angela always made nice food and share with us. we love this couple. "
6838418,44266912,2015-08-24,42152808,Tara,"Our stay at Chris's apartment was awesome. The place was so clean and modern, it felt like a hotel! And the city views from the rooftop terrace were a nice bonus.  Location was great for us - less than 10 blocks from all the action. We'll definitely stay again!"
6838418,44679732,2015-08-28,23004622,Madeline,Our stay at Chris's place was a once in a lifetime experience for my boyfriend and I. We were in Seattle to go to a baseball game and explore the city. The apartment was really clean and organized. The views were lovely and a lot of time was spent on the rooftop patio. I loved that we could walk to the stadium and pretty much everywhere else from the apartment. We both thought the bed was very comfortable. We would love to come back someday!!!
6838418,45598484,2015-09-04,23444073,Sally,"Clean, modern apartment with easy access to the sights of Seattle. Chris and Angie were out of town but were easy to contact and check in with their friend. They were excellent with communication before and after our stay. The rooftop was a cool addition too."
6838418,45956985,2015-09-07,2297940,Hannah,"We arrived in Seattle and had pre arranged to be let into the apartment by one of the guests friends as they had gone away last minute which was fine. We we shown around the apartment and given a few tips on places to go and things to see. On the day of our arrival there was another guest checking out and so they had arranged to leave their bags in the apartment to come and collect them later on which is pretty usual practise with most airbnb listings. We went and explored the city that day and on arriving back later on realised that someone had rifled through our possessions. Nothing had been taken but even so we found this completely inappropriate and totally violating. Not only that but later on that evening at approx 11.30pm another guest was checked in by another friend of the host. She decided to show this guest around pretty much shouting around the apartment waking us both up after what had been a 15 hour flight getting there and a long day in the city. I contacted the host the next day to explain what had happened and he seemed very apologetic yet when I messaged him again to give him the full details he didn't reply. This is the first bad experience I've had through airbnb and to be honest I think the host seriously needs to reconsider how he conducts himself, especially when people are putting good money into his pocket. "
6838418,47292475,2015-09-17,11998632,Qian,"Safe,clean and very new apartment .Angie is very nice and friendly.We don't talk more.Because we always don't stay at home.But it's real a good choice in Seattle."
6838418,47706556,2015-09-21,40887771,Michelle,Angie was a very welcoming host. The apartment and room were very clean and quiet. It was easy to walk or uber to the areas we visited in Seattle. Thank you for a relaxing stay.
6838418,48233882,2015-09-24,21899027,Dongsu,"It was really nice staying in Seatle. It is spacious studio and I can use every facility freely. Everything was very clean and well equiped. I can say it is 9.5 at 10. Internet also was very fast. The only lacking point is the location. That is just beside of road and construction site so, a little noisy."
6838418,48402273,2015-09-26,39350129,Simone,"The apartment was very modern and the bathroom was big, but unfortunately, the bathroom wasn't clean (hair in the shower, two filled rubbish bags,...) and there was no promised breakfast. 
The whole apartment complex is between through-roads and at the end of Chinatown. There is no supermarket (but out of Chinese markets) in the near, but there are buses 5min away, where you can go to Downtown in 10min. 
The check-in was flexible. Chris wasn't there, but Vi gave us the key. We didn't see one of them in the next two days, so we had the apartment (kitchen and living room) for us. "
6838418,49008910,2015-09-30,17345842,Woonjung,"Host were great, they were friendly and helpful. And the room was very clean with beautiful sunshine.
The apartment is near the pier(15-20minutes by walk). Good to stay for vacation. Thank you Chris!"
6838418,49288579,2015-10-02,45212591,Murali,"I really enjoyed staying at this place. The hosts, Angie and Chris, made me feel at home in the very first hour. The place is cozy and very comfortable. It is located close to downtown and that helped me explore the city more conveniently. The young host couple are very friendly and helpful. Highly recommend this place."
6838418,49803070,2015-10-06,40518443,Selina,Chris and Angie are great folks! They were good communicators and helped out with food recommendations! 
6838418,50054053,2015-10-08,45395292,Ry,The Host was very friendly and informative about Seattle and what sights to see. The place was clean and I felt comfortable.
6838418,50380307,2015-10-11,14069190,Navid,"Angie&Chris were wonderful hosts.
The area of the apt is super central and has been undergoing a recent upgrade. It has great Vietnamese restaurants to offer and Angie&Chris can help with recommendations. The apartment is very clean. The bathroom (not en-suite) is spacious.
Someone used to very quiet environments (e.g., from the very country side) may find the level of noise from the street a little too much (but normal for any place almost downtown)"
6838418,50963393,2015-10-16,45309725,Fan,"This apartment is very new pretty and comfortable. The location is good, near Chinatown and downtown. We can walk to everywhere or take uber under $10. We have private bedroom and bathroom. The bed is very comfortable. The host is very welcome. They cook delicious Pho. Its a really good experience for me stay in their apartment."
6838418,51540759,2015-10-21,31146236,Melissa,"The apartment was a quick uber ride to all the areas we wanted to see. Convenient for exploring the city and coming back to sleep. The building itself is new (most of my uber drivers had no idea it was completed) but is in a ""transitioning"" area. "
6838418,51772764,2015-10-24,42481327,Sarah,"Chris and Angie were really great hosts!
They are super friendly and communicative. 
It is a really new building and the room was clean and very cozy. 
And they have a great roof terrace with a fire place and the view over Seattle. 
It was great. :) 
"
6838418,52251156,2015-10-27,14244436,Ross,"Great place to stay pretty close to downtown Seattle. Very new apartment building. Not too far either from a bunch of great neighborhoods, and north Seattle is a quick bus ride away. Highly recommended."
6838418,52384585,2015-10-28,170071,Sam,Simple & great.
6838418,52708938,2015-11-01,58154,Susan,"Our hosts Angie and Chris invited us to eat with them, but we had already eaten. They gave us a printed sheet of sited to see in the area.
They gave us specific instructions on how to make us feel comfortable in their apartment"
6838418,53067196,2015-11-04,35926375,Miranda,Angie and Chris were a very welcoming couple! Their apartment is in a fun location and very comfortable. We will definitely try to stay with them again!
6838418,53616588,2015-11-10,46088719,Sarah,This was a great place to stay while exploring Seattle. We had plenty of privacy and it was an easy walk to downtown. Chris and Angie were both very welcoming and helpful! The entire space was exceptionally clean and there were some beautiful views from the roof. I would definitely recommend staying here to anyone!
6838418,54165210,2015-11-16,45891675,Aubrey,"Angie and Chris were great hosts! My friend and I arrived very late at night and left our luggage in the apartment after check out and they were very accommodating. I appreciated that they left notes around the apartment on about using the kitchen, bathroom, trash, etc. since they were not always around to ask them questions. Their apartment was nice, clean, and located in a very convenient part of town. It is very close to public transportation and there are Pronto bike rentals right outside the building. The downtown area isn't too far of a walk either. I very much enjoyed my stay and would stay with them again!"
6838418,54407858,2015-11-19,24676013,Hanna,"This was a great experience. I was only staying for one night but it was a very easy, convenient  place, clean and cozy. The hosts were helpful and I only wished I could stay longer to explore more of Seattle. Great location close to downtown and a lot of vietnamese and chinese restaurants."
6838418,54903416,2015-11-25,15869030,Katelyn,"The hosts, Angie and her boyfriend, were very friendly and welcoming. The apartment was in a pretty good location, although I felt a little uncomfortable arriving after dark by myself. If you're traveling solo, I recommend you plan to arrive during the daytime.
The space was ample and modern - my only complaint was the bed. It was rather uncomfortable because of the stiff mattress. After sleeping here for several nights, I was having some back pain.
Otherwise, a great stay in a convenient location and we had an awesome time in Seattle."

6838418,55631365,2015-12-03,44422442,Florian,"Angie's place is wonderful. A clean appartement with everything you need (and more!), a friendly and helpful host, full use of the kitchen, living room and the gym and your own private bathroom. On top of that the location is decent too. What more can you ask for?

Definitely a good place to stay in Seattle! Would come again ;)"
6838418,55744383,2015-12-05,3268622,Scott,"Staying at Angie's place was a great experience. The location was convenient, with lots of transit options, and it's close to the train station and light-rail station. Angie was a terrific host and we even had access to the gym, the living room and the kitchen. We hope to visit again soon."
6838418,55820430,2015-12-06,30029779,Xin,great experience! we really enjoy the stay
6838418,56066171,2015-12-08,34222115,Dustin,"Angie was a good host in Seattle. My wife and I had a great stay. After traveling for a week, Angie let us use her washer and dryer which was a lot of help for us. "
6838418,56145115,2015-12-09,46591822,Tiffany,"My friend and I had a great experience during our stay. The hosts were very nice and kind, even left us a list of popular things to do in the area! We were only at the location to sleep, but the bed was comfortable and the room is private."
6838418,56320128,2015-12-12,18164969,Valentina,Great location!!!  Angie's place is very modern and has everything you need. Parking was super easy in the neighborhood and lots of food options in the area. Literally a 5 minute drive to Pikes. Angie was very helpful and quick to reply to texts. Would stay there again! 
6838418,56463621,2015-12-13,51035616,Brandon,"Angie's place was excellent! My girlfriend and I stayed there one night and were very comfortable. Downtown Seattle and the international district were right around the corner, with bus stops everywhere. I would definitely recommend this place."
6838418,56853752,2015-12-19,48442159,Bri,"Angie was certainly a welcoming and gracious host.  The apartment was located directly in the city with easy access to downtown, had a great layout, awesome fire pit, nice gym, and comfortable feel.  Although there was difficulty parking and miscommunication at check in, we were comfortable in Angie's space and were thankful for the many notes and index cards that were left throughout the apartment with instructions and tips.  The neighborhood is right on the edge of a less developed part of the city, but walking (during the day...I would recommend not doing so at night) made for easy travel and did not risk further difficulty finding parking later.  The apartment was very organized and clean, although the pillowcases and sheets seemed to be used before we arrived.  This ended up being an easy fix as Angie allowed us access to the washer and dryer located conveniently in the apartment.  I would recommend this space for future travelers. "
6838418,57332467,2015-12-24,11796294,Leah,"My boyfriend and I enjoyed a one night stay at Angie's apartment. We had some difficulty getting into the apartment upon arrival. We were able to get into the apartment after a 30 minute wait. Once we were let in to the apartment, everything went smoothly and all noted amenities were available. Although Angie was away when we were there, she was very communicative and accommodating. The apartment was clean, comfortable and in a convenient location. "
935432,6733243,2013-08-23,4993980,Sean,"Great apartment, great city! Highly recommended."
935432,8347754,2013-10-27,3181600,John,Great locations. Great amenities. Like staying at a hotel but half the cost. Very pleased. Will be staying here next time we visit Seattle. Thanks Jordan!
935432,13996628,2014-06-09,11709320,John,"Absoultly perfect location if you are visiting Seattle! If you have any business in Seattle, I would highly recommend staying here. Jordan made everything easy and manageable from check-in, to parking, to checkout. Was always available when questions arose and responded quickly. Great host!"
935432,19554005,2014-09-14,19162091,Jose,This place was awesome! Great location. Very close to everything. The accommodations were just what we needed. Everything was clean and prepared for our stayed. The view from the balcony was beautiful.  The amenities are great. We all enjoyed our stayed. 
935432,20440122,2014-09-29,20119833,Wayne,"Jordan provided very detailed information on the condo, checking in, parking, checking out, etc. which made our arrival and departure very easy. The condo, building, and amenities were very nice. You can't beat the location! The Condo is a 5 minute walk to Pike's Market and across the street from the Seattle Art Museum. There are many great places close by to eat, get coffee, or hang out. Amazing location! We will definitely stay with Jordan again."
935432,34044749,2015-06-03,4527371,Melanie,"We were looking for a place to stay near Pike Place Market the night before the date of arrival. Even though our initial place didn't work out, Jordan recommended another place for us to stay around the same price range but this has ocean view. Jordan was very quick to respond, which made reservation very quick and easy. The place was clean and had everything we needed. It was less than 5 min walk to Pike Place Market and less than 10min to the freeway (I think it was Hwy 5). It made our time in Seattle very enjoyable. Very close to first Starbucks"
799882,3010118,2012-12-02,4079558,Ursula,"Upon coming back to Seattle, I stayed at Lisa's for a week while I settled into a new job and looked for a permanent place to live.  Lisa is a great hostess! Everything was comfortable and welcoming.  Lisa offered coffee and biscotti and was a friendly face every day.  Plus, her pup Lexy is as sweet as they come.  My dog and I felt very much at home.  I would definitely recommend staying at Lisa's and I would stay there again.  Thanks Lisa and Lexy!!"
799882,3097819,2012-12-16,4270633,Mike,Great space in a really neat neighborhood and Lisa was a very gracious host.  I would hesitate to recommend her/her house to anybody.
799882,3970716,2013-04-01,3840347,Amber,"Review from Ben, who stayed with Lisa for three months: I'm glad that I chose Lisa's place to spend my time at in Seattle.  It was a good value, a pleasant stay, and a great base for exploring the city.  Having lived in Seattle for years myself, I can tell you that it's about my favorite part of town, with its proximity to Green Lake and Woodland Park.  The quiet and lovely surrounding neighborhoods have plenty of places for good food.  Lisa always kept a tidy house, with a kitchen stocked with breakfast items for the taking.  I always felt free to make myself at home.  Always accommodating and friendly, Lisa herself was rarely home, but her sweet dog Lexi was a happy companion and treat to have around.  I would recommend a stay at Lisa's place to anyone."
799882,4320802,2013-04-28,4660590,Cassie,Lisa was a wonderful host! She is very friendly and welcoming and the house was always clean and well kept. I would stay there again if I returned to the area. Lexi (her dog) is a sweetheart!
799882,4644474,2013-05-18,4546462,Rebecca,Lisa is incredibly hospitable host yet gives you your space. I loved getting to know her and explore the area. 
799882,4937494,2013-06-03,5406405,Andrew,"As my first Airbnb experience, I'm so glad that I stayed with Lisa. She is welcoming and happy to share knowledge about the area -- had a fantastic time on the Mt. Si trail that she explained to me and even had a great topo map! Staying here for about two weeks, Lexi (dog) and I became friends. Bathroom and kitchen are always clean, and she always had a great selection of breakfast food.

The basement room itself was really great too. Extremely spacious, (TV available, I didn't use though), and one really solid chair that is great to just sit and surf the web on. I slept fantastic on the sofa bed. I've slept on plenty and def. did not have any issues like you normally have with them. She even has a new heater, which keeps the place as warm as you want for those early cold morning hours. WiFi coverage is great throughout the house.

The neighborhood is so peaceful and very safe. I took walks around Green Lake almost every night, and there's great restaurants/coffee within easy walking distance. Street parking is always avaliable. "
799882,5203444,2013-06-18,4228387,Leona S.,"Lisa was an excellent host! She was very easy going, welcoming, and the lodging accommodated all our needs. We didn't get the chance to hang out too much, as we were attending a program (from early morn to late at night). However, from the times we did check in with Lisa - she was wonderful. I would definitely stay with Lisa again, she's a lovely awesome host! - June 2013"
799882,5483614,2013-07-02,5037501,LaMonica,"There's not enough I can say about Lisa and her home. I stayed at her lovely home for roughly 11 days and it was exactly what I needed/planned. Firstly, her finished basement was so comfortable and quiet! She gives you many options on what to sleep on, but my weird self chose to sleep on the couch (although it folds out to a bed, I didn't use it) since it was very soft but firm!

I also met her son who happened to be home over the summer from college and he was a delight and very gentlemanly! I had some stuff I had to scan and email to my job, and the scanner wasn't working for me. He came home and got me up and running within 10 minutes!

Lisa herself, was such a sweetheart. Very kind, genuine, friendly, but will leave you be if you're feeling rather hermit-like that day. Just the perfect host all around. She made sure she left out plenty of snacks and fruit for you anytime you had a hankering. (BTW, dark chocolate expresso beans are out of this world amazing. Sorry for going through them Lisa!)

If I could recommend her home for someone to stay, I'd do it 10 times over. It really could not be a more perfect situation for any personality type. The neighborhood is stunning and it's right by Green Lake, which is great for people watching.

Also, her dog Lexi is the sweetest, most gorgeous dog I've ever met. I'm not exaggerating!

If I ever need a place to stay again, I'm giving Lisa a ring without a second thought!"
799882,6168342,2013-08-02,4051822,Phil,"Lisa is a congenial and altogether pleasant host. The location of her house is fantastic. As a former 42-year resident of Seattle I am qualified to make this statement. Neighborhood restaurants, coffee shops, taverns, and a small food market are a stroll away as is a major bus line. Greenlake, the jewel of Seattle parks, is one and a half blocks away and offers a nearly 2.4 mile circumference walk, run or roll with restaurants lining the route. There are beaches and boat rentals. That said, I must in candor alert my fellow travelers that if you are a neatnik or tend that way, you may not find the house to your standards in which case you should look at your options."
799882,6442308,2013-08-12,7855529,Doug,Fantastic host and location. Thanks Lisa! 
799882,10243037,2014-02-09,943670,Asha,"Lisa was an excellent host! I originally planned to stay with her for a little over a month, but then extended my stay to 5 months. Lisa was always helpful, sweet, and accommodating. She is usually busy with her many activities and trips, but it's nice to hear about her adventures when she gets back.

The basement room is large. I slept on the aerobed for half my stay, then slept on the pull out couch for the remaining stay. Both were comfortable. I only switched to the couch so I could free up more space in the room. I was busy working while staying with Lisa so I spent most of my time in the room, but the rest of the house is open and comfortable. The bathroom has a great heater you can turn on before you take a shower (during those cold Seattle days). 

Green Lake is a beautiful neighborhood. Lisa's house is very close to the lake which is great if you want to walk, run, walk your dog, kayak, or just have a picnic. I trained for my first half marathon on the Green Lake trail and it was fantastic. There are some nice restaurants on Keystone (less than a 10 min walk), and you can't forget to try the donuts at Mighty-O!  You can also catch bus 16 next to Zoka coffee which will take you to Downtown and 45th street in Wallingford. 45th in Wallingford has nice restaurants and QFC for groceries. 

During my stay, Lisa's dog Lexi and my dog Waldo became best buddies. Lexi is a very sweet and playful dog. Lexi was shy at first, but will quickly warm up to you and be a great companion."
799882,10662668,2014-03-02,11887542,Stephen,"I stayed with Lisa for around 3 weeks. She was a gracious host. The room was extremely comfortable despite having a pullout couch for a bed. Her dog, Lexi, is also an utter sweet heart. I would absolutely stay again in the future."
799882,12879518,2014-05-13,8165047,Jaydee,"Lisa is an incredibly warm and welcoming person with a beautiful and comfortable home. I always felt at ease and safe, and her dog was a lovely companion to have around. The neighbourhood is lovely, and being near Green Lake is a real treat. This was my first AirBnb experience and I admit I had my doubts and fears.. but I feel very lucky to have had such a positive first experience. Lisa is so accommodating that I can't think of a single thing that would have improved my experience here."
799882,15742440,2014-07-15,3517967,Joseph,"I stayed at Lisa’s for two months while I searched for a job and an apartment in Seattle. Now, before I go off on a tangent about how absolutely wonderful this place is: Book. This. Place. The other reviews are all spot on, so instead of reiterating I’ll try to describe my typical day at Lisa’s so that you can get an idea if this place if for you. I’d wake up around 7 and Lisa and the other Airbnb guest (Jaydee) would often be out, so I’d make my way upstairs to be greeted by the all-so wonderful Lexi (Lisa’s dog). Lexi has the perfect temperament of a certain tranquil excitement, where she is clearly glad to see you and receive attention but will just as happily go lay on the couch if you have something else to attend to. After sitting in the office area and doing a few job applications, I’d take a moment to sit on the front porch with Lexi, eat some breakfast, toss a ball around, and relax in the awesome summer weather (weather may vary, but man summer is amazing). Then I’m off to walk around Green Lake, which is about a minute away. If I ever got tired of that awesome park (I haven’t and never will) I could walk south from Lisa’s for roughly 2 miles and be at Gasworks Park and get an absolute 10/10 view of Lake Union. That’s all fun but now it’s time to eat. About .3 miles from Lisa’s are three awesome places all clustered together. Diggity Dog – Delicious Burgers and Bratwursts at awesome prices. Mighty-O doughnuts – Great doughnuts and even better coffee. Zoka Coffeehouse – Perfect atmosphere to sit with a laptop and knock out some work. I had planned not to eat out much, these places quickly changed that. While I’m in that area I catch bus 16 into Downtown and live it up in the city. I loved being able to have the easy access to downtown but still escape back to Lisa’s peaceful retreat in the evening. Upon getting back for the night I’d talk to Lisa for a bit who would always ask about my day, and with being 3000 miles from home and knowing no one up here this was greatly appreciated. Head downstairs, watch T.V, get a great night’s sleep, awake & repeat. I can’t guarantee the other renter will be as awesome as who I stayed with, but Jaydee was a nice added bonus to the whole experience. Please see her review below mine. P.S – I’m now living a couple blocks away cause I love the area so much."
799882,19918813,2014-09-21,10019285,Christina,"Lisa was wonderfully welcoming from the very beginning. Throughout my stay,  she made me feel right at home. Her dog, Lexi, is super sweet and loving.  The neighborhood is amazing with a beautiful mix of older homes with character and newly built modern homes.  I enjoyed walking my dog in the neighborhood and observing the variety of gardens, plant life and landscaping in the area.  There is an awesome coffee shop, donut shop, and brewery only a couple of blocks away.  Green Lake is only a block away with a wide variety of outdoor activities available. Seattle is a large city; however this neighborhood though close to so many things in the city, feels set apart from the hustle and bustle of Seattle.  It was also really nice to meet a variety of other airbnb guests from all different places across the U.S. and the world who stopped for anywhere from 1 day to a few weeks.   Lisa's two children who are around at times are also really good people, kind and welcoming.  I feel truly lucky to have found this listing for my Seattle stay, and would recommend it to anyone.  "
799882,21028306,2014-10-10,17671753,Matthias,I had a awesome time at Lisa's house. She's super friendly and has a very nice dog. The room is really large and the both the kitchen and the bathroom are clean. I truely can recommend a stay at Lisa'a house.
799882,21441256,2014-10-17,22198967,Mary,"Lisa was a great host, her house was located in a great part if town, close to shops and restaraunts. She was very welcoming and made me feel at home. "
799882,21785077,2014-10-24,20536070,Comer,"Lisa is a very gracious host and I want to thank her for making my first Airbnb experience delightful.
The accommodations in the basement bedroom were more than adequate for my needs.
Thanks Lisa! When I come back to Seattle, I'll be checking for a vacancy at your place."
799882,24099301,2014-12-20,15769576,Rebecca,"Lisa was great, very welcoming and easy to get along with.  The space was perfect for my purpose in Seattle and accurate to it's description. The neighborhood was adorable, I loved in my free time to go walk around and explore the area and the Lake is just down the street. Overall I would highly recommend this location/rental I couldn't have asked for a better first experience with airbnb! "
799882,24363193,2014-12-27,22890341,Steve,Lisa graciously welcomed us into her home and the room was exactly as listed. 
799882,25617668,2015-01-20,20626478,Chris,"My experience staying with Lisa was fantastic! She was very communicative before arriving and willing to help in whatever way she could. Her tour of her home and expectations was welcoming and informative. The accommodation itself is as described. The neighborhood is residential but has close access to a variety of amenities, especially for walks/runs/bikes in a urban natural setting. I would definitely stay again looking for a comfortable place in a safe neighborhood with great access to all of Seattle. "
799882,25941706,2015-01-30,6882217,Amar,"I stayed at Lisa's house for a week+ during apartment and car hunting because I just relocated to the Seattle area. 

Host\Reservation\Response\Arrangement:
List was very quick to respond to my couple of inquiries. My arrival in Seattle was around 11 PM, but List was willing to stay up to check me in and I really appreciated that! Upon arriving at her house, she and her dog (Lexi) greeted me at the door and Lisa walked me through the house explaining everything in details. I already felt like I was home after a long trip. 

House\Room\Location\Neighborhood:
The house is located in a very nice, quiet area, 1-2 min of walking distance from the Green Lake area yet it is also close to restaurant and stores (within 3-5 min of driving). I rented the basement room - which, indeed, was spacious. The bed was huge for 1 person and the room had a fridge, hangers, and a TV too. 

Common\shared rooms:
A spacious living room area for hanging out, a nice kitchen with almost everything you need to cook...etc and another room with a piano in it. I had a chance to play the piano and it sounded great! 

Overall:
I truly enjoyed my stay at Lisa's house and she was a great host. Gave me valuable advice on apartments, furniture...etc. Lisa's willingness to help out in any way she can really impressed me! Ah, and Lexi - you gotta love her! She is a nice, fun dog who likes to play. 

Thanks Lisa so much for your hospitality! :) "
799882,27458180,2015-03-05,1177815,Arun,"I really enjoyed my stay at Lisa's place. If you are looking to be close but not in the heart of the hustle and bustle of downtown it's a great location right next to the lake. 

The place has everything to be comfortable and Lisa was very welcoming and helpful."
799882,28132383,2015-03-18,20576297,Robert,Liked staying with Lisa. She is a warm and sharing hostess. Had lots of fun with her black Labrador dog who also acted like a warm host. The neighborhood is great to be in with its decorative and fragrant blooming trees while I was there. The lake and food and the Woodland Park Zoo was all whithin easy walking distance for me. Parked my vehicle in front of her home and did not need it again till the end of my visit when I left. I would gladly stay there again.
799882,28316399,2015-03-22,15237425,Sarah-Ann,"Lisa was great and really friendly, helping me with all my questions. Green Lake is a beautiful neighbourhood and good retreat from the city. So much so that I'm going to be staying there again soon!"
799882,29980546,2015-04-15,29130393,Marcus,"Lisa greeted me at the door and was a gracious host from that moment on. 
She is friendly, helpful and I quickly became comfortable and relaxed in her home. 
I am quite happy I stayed at her house :)"
799882,32356335,2015-05-17,30907380,Steve,"We've been texting nd messaging with Lisa since the previous day of my arrival, so no issues there. Shuttle service from Airport to the City efficient nd convenient"
799882,32515079,2015-05-19,371051,Kimberly Anne,"Lisa is awesome!! And so is Lexi! Jake and I loved staying here. Lexi was Jake's #1 favorite doggie friend on our entire trip. The room was spacious and clean. The bed was comfy, the house itself is great, especially the sunny front porch and yard. The location is fantastic, we walked to the lake and coffee shops from Lisa's house. But the creme de la creme was spending a little time and talking to Lisa herself, what a marvelous woman!"
799882,40419727,2015-07-31,26383002,Annie,I had a great experience staying with Lisa! The house was in a perfect location close to Green Lake and a bike ride away from the clinic I was working at on the other side of the lake. I stayed in the basement room and it was just what I needed. Lots of room and everything you need to feel at home. One of the best things about Lisa's house was that I was able to bring my dog Ellie with me. She and Lisa's dog Lexi were great buds by the end. I stayed with Lisa for 10 weeks and she was nothing but welcoming and always had great tips for places to go in the area. I would highly recommend anyone to stay here!
799882,48979472,2015-09-30,14676907,Thomas,"Staying with Lisa and her family in Seattle was a great way to experience the city. They made me feel very welcome almost a member of the family. Lisa took me on some bike rides around the city that were very enjoyable. Her and Tim always had suggestions for places to go and things to do. The neighborhood had stores, restaurants and coffee shops within easy walking distance. The room was spacious and clean along with being private. I would gladly stay with Lisa, Tim, and Lexi again."
799882,50927348,2015-10-16,35332367,Steven,Private mini-fridge and good wi-fi.
799882,55714427,2015-12-05,33029599,Rie,I had a great stay at Lisa's place. They are very friendly and the hospitality is also great. I can definetely recommend it to others!
9679741,56581016,2015-12-14,40421770,Xueer,"Elizabeth had a quick response to my request, she and her daughter Rachel were really friendly guiding me to their house. Their place is nice and clean in a beautiful neibourhood. "
9679741,56651972,2015-12-15,9339321,Holly,"When I found myself in need of a place at the last minute, Elizabeth was a real lifesaver!  Her charming small home was warm and welcoming.   Her daughter Rachel greeted me with scrumptious homemade chocolate chip cookies.    We had an interesting conversation, and then I had an extremely comfortable sleep on a good bed in a nice dark, quiet room. 

 I especially appreciated having a place to park in the city that is so bustling with so many streets lined with vehicles.  It was a stress-free experience.  "
1323634,9854843,2014-01-14,4144853,John,This place was great! Prez was extremely hospitable and flexible with our travel needs. The location next to light rail and a bus center made getting around a breeze. I'd highly recommend anyone to stay with him! 
4211081,21990140,2014-10-27,8243019,Lynn,"Peter's Cozy Capitol Hill townhouse is a lovely space in a great, walkable, friendly location. The photos don't quite show the charm and accommodating size of the place. It is very inviting, super clean, modern, comfortable and was spacious for 3 adults sleeping separately. Peter was very gracious, always available, and even reached out during a storm to see if we needed candles or lanterns. We would certainly stay here again."
4211081,23324309,2014-11-29,3630078,Kris,"Peter and Margarita's place is the exact piece we are looking for on your visit to Seattle.  Their place is exceptional quality, coziness, cleanness, convenience, transparent exchange of the apartment was super easy, there is not one negative thing to say about their home.  This is by far the best place I have stayed through my airbnb experiences.  P&M's place is in a perfect location for visitors; the place is located in the prime location of Seattle and has excellent view to the city.  It is within steps of reach to some of the best restaurants, large convenient store and public transportation.  Trouble free to enter P&M's place and the decor of the place reminds you’re at home with style.  WE LOVE the place and everyone who visits Seattle should stay at their lovely home~  Awesome unit and host!  Peter is 24x7 attentive makes things ease to attend to and response in matter of min, never leaves you hanging.  Thank you P&M and it is our pleasure to stay at your amazing home!"
4211081,23579994,2014-12-05,24012281,Emily,"Peter was great -- accessible to us when we had questions and respected our privacy as well.  He checked in via email a few times throughout or stay to make sure we had everything we needed.  He was incredibly responsive to questions; I often heard back within the hour.  We were particularly grateful that Peter allowed us to check out late on our last day so that we had a spot to hangout before our redeye back to the east coast.

My colleague and I were in town for work and found this spot to be comfortable (nice common area in the kitchen to hang out) and private when we both went to our separate rooms.  Capitol Hill is a great area and the apartment is in walking distance from some great restaurants and shops."
4211081,23844318,2014-12-12,262047,Kathryn,Staying at Peter's place was perfect. It located in a great area of Seattle with lots of things to walk to nearby. Lots of restaurants to pick from at night. The townhouse was very comfortable and had lots of nice features for guests including phone charging cords and nice shampoo and conditioner. I appreciated Peter's quick responses to questions. I highly recommend others stay here for your visit to Seattle.  
4211081,24266945,2014-12-24,23223676,Lindsay,"House was in great condition and Peter was responsive to all of our needs, checking in before and during our stay to make sure everyone was comfortable. Perfect location for access to great restaurants, parks, downtown, etc. "
4211081,24539200,2014-12-30,11046703,Jill,"This space is great for staying with family or friends due to the 2 separate bedrooms with private attached baths. The home is well maintained, modern and was spotless. It has everything you need in a home away from home, especially since we stayed during the Christmas holiday. Peter was extremely communicative and promptly answered my emails. He and Margarita were so very thoughtful and left me a Christmas card with a gift certificate to their favorite coffee shop, which was outstanding. We also enjoyed the fabulous local kombucha that they left for us. We loved the house so much that we arranged to stay a second time during our same trip after returning to Seattle once we explored more of the Pacific Northwest. Really can't say enough good things. HIGHLY recommend!"
4211081,24989479,2015-01-04,11046703,Jill,Our second time staying at Peter's during our return to Seattle before flying home was perfect! We had no complaints and have already recommended the property to friends and family.
4211081,25687350,2015-01-23,3069537,Rebecca,"This is a beautiful home in a great neighborhood. I loved being able to walk to awesome restaurants, boutiques and cafes. The house is well stocked and very comfortable. Peter was very responsive when we told him that the fire alarm was chirping and was super helpful in advance of our stay.  We stayed there with our family and the well decorated house was a little much for our little kids. I had to move a lot of beautiful pieces of decor to make sure that they were not touched by little hands. But that is hardly a complaint. Stay  here you and you won't be sorry!"
4211081,26165736,2015-02-05,10042488,Wyatt,"We had a great two-night stay in Peter's place. Seamless arrival, responsive host, and comfortable stay as advertised. Would recommend and stay again!"
4211081,26362225,2015-02-10,8541002,Kevin,"Peter did a great job with directions and instructions on how to get into his house.  The house was clean and inviting.  Peter has chargers everywhere for phones and tablets and all the amenities you need in the kitchen for an extended stay. 

We had 5 of us and everyone was comfortable.  

We broke a LARGE glass and instead of questioning it Peter asked if everyone was ok first.  That is a good host.  

The location of the house was perfect for us.  We walked to most of the restaurants and bars we wanted to visit.  We did have a car - there is street parking and a parking pass but we used Uber and Lyft most of the time to get downtown.

Highly recommend this house and Peter was a good host - not intrusive but there to answer any of our questions."
4211081,26466374,2015-02-13,26367904,Bette,"This is a very comfortable, very clean, modern, well appointed home. Communications with Peter were clear and easy. We loved the location - easily walked to Broadway for coffee and supermarket, to 15th Ave for dinner and more, and to the Volunteer Park water tower. I would enjoy staying here again!"
4211081,26688372,2015-02-17,12350750,Karen,The home was beautiful and spacious  for our party of 5. The Capital Hill location was extremely convenient and walking distance to many shops and restaurants. We would definitely stay again when visiting Seattle.
4211081,27659401,2015-03-09,27239816,Kevin,"Our stay got off to a great start because of Peter.  He couldn't have responded faster to all of our questions and even offered help for things we hadn't thought of.  As far as the place itself, it was wonderful.  Our party of 6 fit very comfortably.  Very clean and even nicer/better kept than it's page would lead you to believe.  The neighborhood was full of beautiful trees, and its central location was perfect for all the activities we wanted to do.  We were able to walk to nearly everything, and what we couldn't walk to an Uber ride of  $8 got us there."
4211081,28485266,2015-03-24,28628088,Ben,"Wow, Peter's place was great!! He has literally thought of EVERYTHING, even charging cables and connecters for any device to the TV! Our party of 5 was in town for a wedding and we could not have been happier with the accommodations. Centrally located and easy to get around, this spot was just as Peter described. The home was lovely and modern, clean and well kept. I would recommend this place for anyone traveling to Seattle for any reason. Peter was even gracious enough to get us a early check in when he found out we were in town the day before. A++ all the way. Peter rocks! "
4211081,28799782,2015-03-30,27866950,Amanda,"We loved our stay at the Cozy Capitol Hill! Peter was helpful, responsive, and checked up on us to make sure we had everything we needed. The beds, futon, and couch were comfortable. Peter left us plenty of blankets, sheets, and towels. Plus the condo is in a great location! It helped make a great trip. We would definitely stay here again. "
4211081,29092148,2015-04-04,2205984,Caroline,"We had a wonderful stay at this roomy townhouse. It was clean, and well furnished and our family of five felt we had plenty of room. We loved the baby grand, and the window seat with the fireplace. It's a great place to drink coffee on a rainy Seattle morning. Parking was the only minor hassle, meaning chances of finding a space right outside were slim but spots could always be found within a few blocks. This seemed true of most of Seattle. There are a lot of cars in the city! 

We would definitely stay here again. Peter was an easy-going host who always responded quickly."
4211081,29912629,2015-04-14,2580135,James,"Truly wonderful stay. Loved Peter's house and all the finishing touches of chilled Kombucha in the fridge, aveda hair products, piano, seat in the sun and big space. Great location. Would stay again and recommend to friends everytime. Thank you Peter for such a easy stay, quick and accommodating responses. "
4211081,30318757,2015-04-20,2308467,Maria,The townhouse is much larger than the pictures capture.  It was very pleasant in a great part of town.  Everything was clearly organized making our stay very smooth.
4211081,30531923,2015-04-23,6106348,Elizabeth,"Peter's cozy capital hill home is awesome!!  My coworker and I stayed here as opposed to downtown for a couple days and loved it.  It was a mere 10 minute or less ride to downtown if you're worried about commuting to meetings.  When we needed to work from the house, the wifi was reliable and fast.  There wasn't any street noise despite being so close to the Broadway scene.  There are a number of cute coffee shops, restaurants, and bars within walking distance.  I highly recommend this abode for any form of travel to Seattle, and would definitely stay here again!"
4211081,30869576,2015-04-28,7118465,Alex,"Peter was very attentive and helpful, replied to any questions in a matter of minutes. The house is beautiful and very comfortable, in a perfect location for exploring Seattle. Will definitely recommend and stay again. "
4211081,31337991,2015-05-04,6444590,Dana,"Peter was very attentive to our needs checking in with me before  and during our stay.  The rental was clean, ready for our arrival, and there was adequate space for our party of 5 adults. The neighborhood really can't be beat and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this listing to anyone. "
4211081,31943591,2015-05-12,2687969,Michael,Outstanding well furnished and located comfortable apt!
4211081,32133929,2015-05-14,4670860,Justin,"Peter made the process very easy. The house was in a fantastic location, with many different bars and restaurants in walking distance. 

The house itself was huge and easily accommodated our group of 4. It was very comfortable too.

Parking was a little tough but thankfully Peter provided a parking pass."
4211081,32460582,2015-05-18,2779707,Tim,Peter was really easy to work with - very responsive and clear and helpful to our group. The house itself is a snug row house very nicely appointed and just a few blocks from Broadway with it's huge collection of restaurants and pubs. Nice place for a family or maybe two couples.
4211081,32859645,2015-05-22,28459256,Alexander,"Great location and plenty of amenities. Walkable to plenty of stores, restaraunts and bars."
4211081,33228245,2015-05-26,7980332,Tonny,"Peter was a fantastic host! He even had a brand new highchair delivered the day we arrived for us to use.  The home was gorgeous, very modern with all the amenities you could ask for. Everything was very clean, you could tell it was professionally cleaned prior to arrival. The location is fantastic. I was born and raised in Seattle, so I know this is the area you want to be in for COFFEE, restaurants and nightlife. Parking can be tough certain times of the day, but never had to park more than two blocks away. There was also a guest pass so you can street park beyond the zoned 2hr limit. We will definitely check to see if Peter's house is available next time we visit."
4211081,33673740,2015-05-31,25288910,Matthew,"Spacious, clean, Central and secure. We couldn't have asked for anything better."
4211081,33927527,2015-06-02,32267839,Sandeep,Peter was a nice host.  His communication was open and timely.  He came by to take care of a small need when we were staying there.  The location was very convenient.
4211081,34275579,2015-06-07,27791159,Ronald,"Peter went out of his way to make us feel welcome. The description was definitly accurate. Great neighborhood; many restaurants, coffee houses, shops, etc. "
4211081,35195447,2015-06-16,4113843,Amy,"We had an excellent experience with Peter and staying in his lovely home.  The townhouse is exactly as shown in the photos.  Immaculately clean, warm and welcoming.  Perfect amount of space for our family of five.  It was great to have two separate bathrooms with showers for our family.  We stayed here for our daughter's college Graduation from Seattle U.  The location was perfect.  Within a few blocks of a grocery store, shopping, coffee shops and restaurants on Broadway.  We walked all around this lovely neighborhood of Capitol Hill.    Having a street parking pass was most helpful, though there were a few times that we had to circle around to find a space big enough for our large SUV rental. 
  
The house is within short walking distance of a fabulous coffee shop called Vivace and a wonderful restaurant called Poppy.   Highly recommend staying in this lovely, warm home.  Peter was truly wonderful, accommodating and responsive to all of our needs throughout the entire experience.  Every detail was provided. Loved the beautiful flowers to greet us :-)  Fully stocked kitchen, wash room with ironing board, hair dryers in bathrooms.  Beautifully appointed decor. A home away from home. Would definitely stay here again!   
Many Thanks Peter!"
4211081,35470923,2015-06-19,32722174,Sylvia,"This place is clean and quiet :) We traveled as two families and there was plenty of room for us. The location is convenient! The supermarket and other shops are only a 5-min walk away. The space needle area is a 10-min drive away.
Peter was really kind. Everything was well prepared. We are satisfied with our staying.
If you travel with more than one car, it may take a little time to look for the second parking spot in that district, especially when everyone comes back home at night. The first car can have a visitor parking pass so it will be eaiser. We appreciate that Peter patiently helped us with our parking issue. We would recommend this place!"
4211081,36164634,2015-06-26,25324310,Raka,"Had a wonderful first time AirBnB experience staying at Peter's cozy Capitol Hill home! The location couldn't have been better - close to tons of restaurants, shops and bars, but still in a quiet residential neighborhood. The house looked beautiful when we got there, and was decorated with many nice touches, including Aveda toiletries in the bathroom. It was great to have two bedrooms, each with their own attached bathrooms, for our little group of two couples. We had a wonderful time and would definitely stay again!"
4211081,36506481,2015-06-29,1110514,Jerome,"This this has to be both the best place I have stayed at on airbnb and also the most ""faithful"" to how it was advertised.  It was well-located, clean, safe, modern and very cozy. Peter was super communicative, and though we never met in person, he was the perfect host. Highly recommended place to stay and good value for the $ especially for families or groups."
4211081,37160356,2015-07-05,32631891,Maria,Great space in a fun neighborhood. Lots of stores and restaurants nearby. Very clean and functional for our large group. 
4211081,37596313,2015-07-08,2569314,Raymond,"My family and I really enjoyed our time in Peter's home. 

Off the bat Peter was very responsive to my questions and had some flexibility when we arrived earlier than the check in time! The previous guest lost the parking permit, and for the inconvenience, Peter gave us a gift certificate to a wonderful coffee bar. 

The property was beautiful and as described in the listing! We loved the space and all of its amenities, especially its proximity to restaurants, bars and places to visit. 

I highly recommend booking Peters property!
"
4211081,37948784,2015-07-12,28891848,Hart,"This home was beautiful and the experience was very professional: communication was perfect between Peter and me. The home is in an excellent location, walkable to various sights (or if needed: an Uber/Lyft ride away). The home was clean and modern, and very comfortable. If you stay here you won't be disappointed."
4211081,38374555,2015-07-15,27891604,Liz,My friends and I had a wonderful stay at Peter's Capitol Hill Townhouse. Peter was very attentive and made sure that we had everything that we needed. The house was very clean and spacious for our group of 5. We would definitely come back!
4211081,38658364,2015-07-17,17115197,Summer,"Beautiful neighborhood, amazing location with a lot of restaurants, bars and coffeeshops just two blocks away. The apartment itself was really nice, clean and very spacey. I'd definitely stay here again."
4211081,38986671,2015-07-20,14282274,Todd,This was a great condo in a great location.  There are lots of shops and restaurants well within walking distance including a large grocery store.  It was unseasonably warm in Seattle while we were there and there wasn't air conditioning but it wasn't bad with an open window and the provided fans. 
4211081,39597676,2015-07-25,5982580,James,"Peter's house was excellent. It was very spacious and comfortable: we had everything we needed for a 3 night stay. The location was superb: Capitol Hill has numerous bars, cafes and restaurants, all within walking distance. I can in particular recommend Cafe Solstice and Americana, both located a couple of blocks away. Peter himself was very communicative and particularly accommodating in assisting us with a parking permit. "
4211081,40311537,2015-07-30,30559953,Nathan,"Great location, very comfortable, excellent kitchen and A/V facilities. Really had fun here. 

We actually walked to and from the city center from here. Most would find that too far, but we quite enjoyed the scene. 

Short pleasant walk to restaurants, groceries, etc. "
4211081,40707885,2015-08-02,861797,Noa,"We were a party of 4 staying for 3 nights. First, Peter is a great host. Communication was very easy. He was very attentive and was willing to help with everything we needed. Replies within short time. The apartment was great. Beautiful, specious, spotlessly clean and good location. We had a car and counted on the parking permit that we expected to get. However, the previous guest forgot to return it. Peter offered to reimburse us for parking fees! Eventually, we could find non zone parking for free nearby. I would recommend to anybody who is coming to Seattle to stay at Peter's place! Great choice."
4211081,41365738,2015-08-07,14050870,Amy,"The listing is very accurate and the pictures don't do this location justice. It's very nice, clean, and in a great location.  "
4211081,42680435,2015-08-15,15020895,Desmond,"Peter was an excellent host, very responsive to all of our questions. The property was just as described in the listing but so much nicer than in the pictures. It was a great location (one block off Broadway) and very clean and comfortable. There's a very spacious open floor plan where the kitchen flows into the living/dining and sitting areas with a very tasteful design touch. The bedrooms and bathrooms were meticulous. We took walks everyday through the neighborhood and met and spoke with many locals, we even walked to downtown Seattle with our 2 kids and it only took about 35 minutes to get to the Space Needle. On our way back, it was very easy to catch the bus that drops you right at Broadway, a few blocks from the house. We had a great time at Peter's place, we'll definitely be back if we're in these parts again and would recommend to anyone looking for a clean, comfortable, affordable option with an excellent location."
4211081,43026152,2015-08-17,30444293,Boon,"Peter was responsive to all my questions. His description and photos of his beautiful townhouse were very accurate. The home is 3 levels and is furnished beautifully, including the Bosch washer/dryer which came in handy after my week-long cruise to Alaska. The plug and play adapter cords also came in handy in broadcasting videos and photos from my phone to the big screen TV. Although there is no A/C, there are fans and cross breezes to help cool the entire home down. 

I loved the proximity to the local restaurants, bars and coffee shops. However, it is quite a trek to walk to downtown. With my two young sons, I just used Uber which cost between $7 - $10.

I would stay here again without hesitation. 
"
4211081,43606402,2015-08-21,4772672,Kaylee,"Our group of 6 had an amazing time at Peters home. It's spacious, has all the amenities you need and Peter was so quick to get back to any questions we had.
The location is fantastic, very close to everything you need and only a short ride away from downtown.
Our only gripe is that we didn't have longer here! We will definitely stay again."
4211081,44280247,2015-08-25,30375126,David,"The location is very good, we were able to walk everywhere we wanted. The house itself was excellent, we comfortably slept 4 individuals and enjoyed using the large  kitchen. The information sheet left by the host made the stay very easy as it answered all of our potential questions. I highly recommend using this property."
4211081,44672450,2015-08-28,39633190,Peter,"In the hopping part of Capital Hill, just 2 short blocks off Broadway, a fun location. New town home, nicely appointed, clean, well tended. A fun place to experience that area's city life. Near nice restaurants and bars, near a big grocery store, easy bus access to downtown Seattle. "
4211081,45364427,2015-09-02,19008543,Jeff,"Would absolutely stay here again. Located in a great area with lots of great restaurants and bars, and 24/7 QFC across the street. Quiet, modern home with nice furniture touches, fast and easily accessible wi-fi, and everything is labeled (goes a long way, trust me!). Shower's are piping hot and good water pressure. Peter was very communicative. "
4211081,45660596,2015-09-05,29220440,Alyssa,Loved the townhouse. Peter was a wonderful and accommodating host. Large town house. We fit 5 people comfortably. Everything was clean and very well organized. Beds were comfy. Perfect location for walking into bars/ restaurants.
4211081,46115690,2015-09-08,22444194,Kathy,"We loved our stay at Peter's Cozy Capitol Hill Home!  It is cozy indeed!    The location was perfect; in a neighborhood, close to shops, sights and restaurants.  We used the parking pass provided and never had a problem finding parking.  The home was just as pictured on Peter's posting.  Very clean, comfortable beds, quiet, great detailed instructions were provided and Peter was organized and efficient in his communication.  We'd love to come stay here again! Thanks!"
4211081,47032818,2015-09-15,32785064,Karen,"Peter was very accurate in his description of his great town home.  It was clean and very orderly.  He left a longer term parking pass for the street, and we found that by using Uber, and walking in the neighborhood, we needed to use our car very little.  He even provided the first complimentary Uber ride, which was appreciated, and familiarized us with its service;  w we used it frequently.  When we had questions he was always quick to respond, and certainly made us feel welcome in his home.  Very good host and excellent location for us.  We certainly enjoyed our stay. Thanks, Peter!"
4211081,47409548,2015-09-18,43386442,Sonny,What a great place! The house for very comfortable and homy and Peter took the time to add small touches to make our stay comfortable. Very convenient to many of my favorite restaurants. I shared the house with a friend and we both agreed we would stay there again.
4211081,47622183,2015-09-21,7471606,Brent,"Peter allowed us to check in early, drop off our bags and go about town.  He answered my calls - and there were quite a few as I had a hard time figuring out how to get into the property - very quickly and explained everything fully to me so I could come and go as I pleased."
4211081,48699403,2015-09-28,8878131,Emily,"Peter was super responsive with his communication leading up to our trip. The house was even better than it looks in the pictures! There are a few levels in the house, so everyone had plenty of space for privacy (we used some of the couches as beds). The house was really well stocked and had a thoughtful amount of extra blankets and pillows. All the cool stuff in Capitol Hill was an easy 15 minute walk away. We thought the round bed in the upstairs bedroom was a hoot and loved having our own bathrooms. "
4211081,49076716,2015-09-30,45105176,Hillary,"The host was very welcoming and responsive.  Check-in was easy.  He answered questions in a timely manner.  The home is in an awesome neighborhood that is very walkable, but still tucked away and quiet.  Everything was clean and accessible.  The host provided a welcome letter explaining logistics and even labeled were useful items were around the house.  

I would definitely stay here again or recommend it to friends.  It was a great deal for a party of four (two couples) and provided a more authentic experience than a hotel and came with more amenities.  
"
4211081,49424862,2015-10-04,34021354,Pauline,"Peter was an excellent host and made us all feel very welcome.  The house was as described and was very comfortable with attention to detail which included Aveda toiletries. The location was excellent, as was the information Peter left for us.  Would highly recommend this property"
4211081,49934563,2015-10-07,22373547,Jocelyne,Peter was very welcoming and responsive to our needs. His place is as described and with all the comfort of a home away from home. The bathrooms are topnotch as is the kitchen. A truly luxurious apartment in the best part of town. Very peaceful but only a couple of blocks away from top restaurants.  Definitely recommend his place. 
4211081,50848765,2015-10-15,4984170,Robert,Great location and very comfortable condo.
4211081,51292451,2015-10-19,155365,Tom,"Our stay at Peter's place was perfect. The townhouse is centrally located in the Capitol Hill neighborhood on a quiet side street. We walked to restaurants on Broadway and even walked downtown to the Space Needle one day and to Pike Place market another (downhill all the way!).
The house was spotlessly clean with a large, modern kitchen and comfortable living area.
Peter's place is really the best of Airbnb: easy check in and out, great location, comfortable and clean."
4211081,51783531,2015-10-24,45690822,Clinton,Peter's place was absolutely wonderful!  Had a great stay.  He had everything wonderful organized and prepared for guests.  Place was just as described.  Loved how close it was to the amenities of Capitol Hill.  Would definitely recommend it to others. ;-)
4211081,52097193,2015-10-26,5190129,Marianne,"Loved this perfectly located place! Peter's townhouse was super cozy, immaculately clean, well stocked and organized, HUGE kitchen, comfy and quiet bedrooms...great for our weekend away in Seattle! The convenience of walking to town was so nice (ate at Witness twice for brunch...yum!). We highly recommend this pretty place for anyone wanting to stay in the Capitol Hill area.  "
4211081,52905315,2015-11-02,46791914,Talib,The place is awesome. The location is right in the middle of Capitol Hill with walking access to pretty much everything. The place has everything you need in terms of facilities and accessories. And the host Peter is super flexible and responsive whenever we had a question.
4211081,53334403,2015-11-08,23358073,Ruby,"Very convenient location with everything you need to relax while you explore Capitol Hill.  The townhouse is very comfortable and clean. Parking seems congested in the area but we didn't have any trouble finding a spot on the block, and then we mostly left the car there with the provided parking pass and walked. There are tons of interesting things to do and see in the neighborhood."
4211081,54094765,2015-11-16,38751767,Patrick,"The Cozy Capitol Hill flat was a spectacular find. A colleague of mine were in on business and found this place, which was very accessible for us to reach downtown by car. We both love to cook and this place had a wonderful kitchen. (A few more pots and pans would have been helpful.) If back in Seattle again for either business or vacation, I would first look to see if Peter's place was available. I would return there in an instant."
4211081,54866260,2015-11-25,45855717,Ellen,"This was a great home for our first Airbnb stay.  It was comfortable, clean, and in a great neighborhood.  We enjoyed the big open kitchen and having three levels for when the kids were sleeping.  Street parking was generally easy to find, and we were very grateful for the pass.  Peter very kindly checked in with us when the weather was much cooler than normal to make sure we had everything we needed.  "
4211081,55197613,2015-11-29,5175800,Minh,"The house was so cozy and clean, in the perfect neighborhood walking  distance to some great shops and restaurants/bars. I'm from California but used to live in Vancouver BC so I've been to seattle a lot. Capitol Hill is the place you want to be in if you want to avoid tourist traps but be close to where the fun is. Peter was great in responding to all my little inquires, and the check in check out process was super simple. I would absolutely stay there again."
4211081,56313682,2015-12-12,11820645,Michael,The place was great! We had a nice stay and the location is great!
4211081,57652165,2015-12-28,2765958,Marie,"""Cozy Capitol Hill"" perfectly describes our stay. Awesome open-concept kitchen and living room area with fire-place. We loved the updated fun modern decor and the great location to coffee shops and restaurants. It's a three-story house, so there are stairs to climb to get to the bedrooms on the third level, but this was not a problem for our family. Peter, our host, made us feel very welcome. This is a great Airbnb!"
4211081,58283808,2016-01-02,21034538,Leah,"We had a wonderful stay over the year-end! The house was lovely and very well kept and clean. It was exactly what we were looking for - something in a more residential area, but with lots to enjoy in the immediate neighborhood.

The Capitol Hill neighborhood was great. The house was only 2 blocks from a huge QFC which came in handy when we ate in, but there were also a lot of restaurants and cafes within walking distance as well. Downtown was very close, a short 10 minutes by car.

Peter was a great host - reaching out to make sure we had arrived safely and responding very quickly when we had questions. 

We would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend this property!"
6363779,35183707,2015-06-15,6558284,Edwin,Zach was a friendly host. There were him and his gf living at the apartment. The best part about Zach's place is the location because it is close to downtown and multiple bus routes serve the area. A 2-minute walk gives a view of the lake. The least I liked about the place is that the room was not as neat/clean as I would expect at my own home. There were about 2 dozens of females shoes hanging on the door. The shelves were full with personal belonging so I had nowhere to put my personal items. Lastly the bed sheets did not smell fresh. Perhaps I just have a higher standard of hygiene and neatness compared to most guys. 
6363779,35981842,2015-06-23,15084801,Pete,"Zach was a great host, very accommodating. Zach offerred lots of suggestions for easy ways to get around Seattle, along with things to see, local watering holes, and great places to eat, that won't cost a fortune.  He also has a cool little dog named Bacon that will treat you like a king. "
6872650,40852836,2015-08-02,33578580,Stephen,Absolutely amazing hidden jem. Erik was so cool and was able to give us our space while also being there in case we needed him. 
6872650,41028927,2015-08-03,39845492,James,"Erik was a wonderful host. I was surprised he opened his kitchen and laundry to us, very generous. He was very knowledgeable about the area and fun to talk to.  His place is literally a stone's throw from the light rail which is also a plus. Thank you Erik"
6872650,42464219,2015-08-13,29401904,Haley,"Erik was very welcoming, the neighborhood was conveniently located near a LINK station, and the house was as charming and comfortable as expected. The listing was also a great value."
6872650,42609335,2015-08-14,36639376,Becky,Very comfortable room and very close to the light rail so easy access to the airport/greyhound bus/downtown! Good base for exploring Seattle 
6872650,43124901,2015-08-17,7697045,Danya,"We were very grateful that Erik could accommodate us. He was very welcoming, and it was easy to come in and out of the room. Met some really nice people staying in the other room as well! :)"
6872650,43454295,2015-08-19,20921010,Joana,This was an awesome place to stay. We added another person to our party last minute and he had no problem with it. He gave us a map of where we can go and eat around the neighborhood. It was a quick five min walk to the monorail from his house which left us in downtown Seattle. He offered us his fruit tree as well. 
6872650,43581674,2015-08-20,7061755,Sarah,"Erik's home was lovely and welcoming; we were able to drop off our things before enjoying the city.  He graciously offered us fresh pears that were from the tree in his backyard.

The neighborhood is a little off the beaten path, but there was a fantastic Vietnamese place around the corner and you can take the buses or the light-rail anyplace you want to go."
6872650,43734868,2015-08-21,41092024,Gina,"Erik was an excellent host! We arrived when he wasn't home, but he left the door open for us so we could let ourselves in. 
There was another couple staying with us, but in a separate room in the house. The property was beautiful! There was a garden in the back as well as fruit trees. The home itself had a rustic, comfortable feel to it. There is a shared kitchen and living room area with two separate bedrooms. 
It's in a great location, within walking distance of the train, busses, and plenty of restaurants. The neighborhood itself is very peaceful and quiet. 

We actually hung out with Erik and his dog on the deck in the back of the house and chatted with him for quite a while. He's a very pleasant and interesting guy, and very hospitable! He offered us anything in the kitchen and at the end of the night, he went to his own residence behind the house we were staying in. 

It was a very enjoyable visit and I would definitely recommend his Air B&B."
6872650,44179984,2015-08-24,35333208,Yatish,I had a great time at Erik's place. He was a very welcoming and gracious host and my friend and I enjoyed the stay there. The bedroom and bathroom were very well-organized and the kitchen was open to us to use as well. I highly recommend staying at Erik's and his back porch is awesome to use for hanging out. I also appreciated the safety of the neighborhood. His garden is also a really cool addition! 
6872650,45285573,2015-09-01,9246967,Mike,Erik is a gracious and welcoming host.  His place is a comfortable home away from home.

6872650,45732303,2015-09-05,33170599,Tyler,"Erik was a great host - very friendly and made us feel right at home. The space was as described, with access to shared kitchen and bathroom. Erik's place is really close to the Mt. Adams Light Rail station so it makes maneuvering around Seattle very easy - and with no traffic. We definitely recommend staying with Erik!"
6872650,45825018,2015-09-06,40876602,AmaToya,Erik was an amazing host. His home is very clean and beautiful. He is also very knowledgeable about the area and willing to help. We'd definitely book with him again in the future. Thanks Erik.
6872650,45999308,2015-09-07,8990681,Elle,"La Guarida was a welcome refuge from the rain and quite comfortable. Erik's dog, Gustavo was such a sweet boy, I wanted to take him home. "
6872650,46237217,2015-09-08,9358755,Anna,"Erik has created a beautiful Airbnb setup, and is a warm and welcoming host. Check-in/check-out was a breeze, the proximity to the train can't be beat, and he has easy private parking available. When we return to Seattle in the future this will be my first choice for accommodations. "
6872650,46450889,2015-09-10,27386834,Steve,All was good!
6872650,47232710,2015-09-16,23258825,Maria,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I was very satisfied with our stay. The place was cozy and clean and we got a room with a comfy king bed. Eric is hospitable and friendly, would definitely stay here again! "
6872650,47435328,2015-09-18,24914874,Farsane,"We had a good time in Seattle and staying at Erik's place was really nice. The bed was comfortable, we had full access to kitchen and bathroom, and Erik was very kind and helpful. His dog Gustavo is a sweetheart."
6872650,48409447,2015-09-26,41713402,Carol,Erik was an amazing host. He was there to meet us on arrival.  He gave us a tour of the place and made us feel like his home was our home.  He went out of his way to see that we were comfortable and had what we needed.  It is close to public transportation and the neighborhood was quiet and peaceful.  His dog is very friendly and lovable.  It was a great place to come home to after a day of sightseeing.   We enjoyed staying at Erik's and I would stay there again without hesitation. 
6872650,48740549,2015-09-28,42083860,Aleksandra,"Location is very good, it is easy to get to the downtown. Room is comfortable, clean and cosy. Erik is the best host. He is a very good and helpful man. Erik has a great and friendly dog. Contact with him is very easy."

6872650,49573990,2015-10-04,26112509,Tharian,"Erik was a very welcoming host, made me feel right at home. Bed was comfortable and just what I needed after a long week. The place was very close to the light rail station which worked out well. I will definitely recommend erik's place to anyone visiting Seattle."
6872650,52058119,2015-10-26,41923833,Adrian,"Erik was an awesome host. He was very warm and welcoming and even met up with us at the nearby rail station.

The house was fantastic - Comfortable bed. Nice chill-out area. Good kitchen. Impressive backyard. Bathroom with shower and washing machines. Everything that one could need for a longer stay.

The neighborhood was cozy and quiet, with a lot of nice restaurants and beautiful nature.

As we stayed there for about two weeks, we were lucky to have him show us some really cool places in Seattle.

All in all a magnificent experience at Eriks. 

10/10. Would Do Again!"
6872650,54486683,2015-11-20,22668246,Melissa,"We had a great time in Seattle with Erik. The house is so fun and cosy to stay in. Loved the king bed, super comfortable. Erik was an awesome host, we had a fun time chatting and gave great recommendations. I would definitely recommend this listing to all "
6872650,54829942,2015-11-23,29834847,Stefania,We had an awesome stay at Erik's place! We spent a lovely night eating seafood pasta and chatting and playing with his dog and his gorgeous son!
6872650,54950258,2015-11-25,49435561,James,"We stayed one night and had a great time.  Erik was very welcoming and his home was very clean.  Had a nice time chatting with him,  only wish we would have arrived sooner and not as tired.  Had a very comfortable night sleep in a huge bed.  I would definitely recommend this place."
6872650,55431117,2015-12-01,47794408,Sahil,"This beautiful abode is a gem almost in the heart of Seattle. Can't recommend it highly enough. Eric is a great and remarkable person and I honestly believe one of the most welcoming hosts you will meet. He was very accommodating and we almost had the shared area to ourselves most of the time. He provided us with helpful tips and advice on nearby spots, that was especially worthwhile given we visited during thanksgiving when a lot of places were closed. Also amazing was getting to meet his wonderful dog and his beautiful and friendly family. The place is beautifully maintained and has an amazing cozy european-esque mountain lodge like character that was a treat to discover. Even amazing is the fact that Eric built it himself! The outdoor patio is amazing to just chill out and relax. Plus getting anywhere from here is a breeze. Took the Sea-Tac Link from the airport and got to this place in under 25 minutes.. less than a 5 minute walk from the station to here. Overall, this place made our first Seattle trip a real treat. Would re-book it in a heartbeat for our next vacation there. As an added bonus.. Eric stocks the place with some of the best coffee we had in Seattle and with chemical free and all-natural bath products!"
6872650,55647662,2015-12-03,50008150,Brian,Erik was very accommodating to me needing to drop off my bag early. He was also very prompt on his response and the place was clean. 
6872650,55874416,2015-12-06,46026651,Jane,Erik's home is very comfortable and I'm so glad I stayed there.
6872650,56440245,2015-12-13,22659341,Tara,"We enjoyed very much our stay at Erik's beautiful place. It's very clean and comfortable. The children had a good time too, with all the wooden toys. It's super close to the light rail, so we got to explore the city by public transport. The neightbourhood is safe and close to nature, with fresh air. Too bad our stay here was so short, would definitely stay here again!"
6872650,56810594,2015-12-18,50495377,Kaily,"This accommodation was really nice to stay. When we got into the room, it was warm and cozy. We were happy to stay here! Unfortunately, we couldn't meet host because of his work. But his roommate was also nice and made us feel comfortably. His dog was also cute and greeying us :-) Thank u so much. "
6872650,57269864,2015-12-23,44472036,Xiaoyong,"Great experience. Comfortable and quiet place. Thank you Erik, you're so kindness."
6872650,57684556,2015-12-28,9860163,Fadia,"Erik's posting is exactly what it says. The room was huge, and very clean. The whole house feeling was very nice, and warm. 
Erik is a great host, very helpful, and friendly. If I visit Seattle again, I will definitely stay at his place again.
Thanks Erik.
Ethan"
6872650,57827712,2015-12-29,11218770,Janice,"Erik was friendly and responsive during the booking. When we arrived, he greeted us and showed us around his place. The room we stayed in was clean and cozy and the bed was comfortable. The location was close driving distance to downtown. Thanks for a great stay Erik! "
1002835,13316215,2014-05-25,14522234,Jennifer,"Cristina's condo was perfect for our 3 week stay so we could get acquainted with Seattle while looking for a permanent apartment.  The condo was conveniently located to several bus lines, Washington Park, close to eateries and the supermarket, and was fully equipped with everything we needed for cooking, cleaning, etc.  Cristina was very responsive with communication and I would definitely recommend her as a hostess.  "
1002835,18702192,2014-08-31,5177478,Adam,"Stayed here for three months - it was great. Very good location, accommodating host who wasn't nosy at all but still attentive. I had a great time staying here, would recommend it."
1002835,25267687,2015-01-11,23162937,Fran,"El barrio donde está ubicado es lo mejor de este apartamento. 
El lugar definitivamente no está bien mantenido y presentado y el servicio brindado por Cristina no es bueno ya que ella no está viviendo en Seattle y no está al tanto de cómo se encuentra el apartamento verdaderamente. Cuando llegamos el apartamento estaba cerrado y la primera noche pasamos mucho frio cosa que por suerte con el paso de los dias se fue solucionando. No habia toallas en el lugar y luego nos trajeron un juego solamente con lo cual estaba muy justo. Tampoco habia frazadas inicialmente pero luego fueron provistas. 
Respecto a la descripcion del apartamento yo no habia leido que era acceso solo por escalera descubierta y en las fotos se ve un LED TV que no se encuentra ahi. 
Tuve que comunicarme con Cristina varias veces para ir solucionando las cosas que iban apareciendo, lo que hizo que no pueda disfrutar mi estadia como corresponde y hubo algo que me molesto mucho de su lado cuando en una de las conversaciones me dijo que Airbnb no es un hotel.... Para mí este no es el espíritu de alguien que quiere alojar y hacer sentir cómo a alguien en su casa.
"
1002835,32117564,2015-05-14,13223052,Ian,"We stayed at this condo for a full month when transitioning between houses in the Seattle area. It was a nice clean unit with plenty of space, a good kitchen and a nice bunk bed second bed room for our two kids to share. So the unit is nice, but the location is really the big sell here. It's surrounded by some nice places to eat out (and Essential Bakery right across the street) and the arboretum is in easy walking distance which is a great place for a walk or jog. And from right outside the place there are easy bus lines to Cap hill, downtown, u-district and lots of other fun locations. It was an excellent place to stay for us. The host was very helpful about several aspects of our stay and even helped to take care of a bit of paperwork for us (we had to list our temporary residence when applying for a loan on our new house and she provided a letter for this)."
1002835,44541845,2015-08-27,6687787,Darlene,"The apt is in a good location. There are restaurants and cafes nearby.  A Safeway grocery store is 8 min walk and TJs is 16 min walk. Both have parking. We took a very nice walk north of the apt thru the arboretum and along the waterfront across from the UW stadium.  About 3.5 miles away and a $8 uber ride back to the apt.  Buses stop right at the apt to get downtown. 

The apt served our family well but it is very basic and smaller then I expected. If you are a light sleeper and sensitive to noise and/or light bring earplugs and/or eye mask.  The apt is on a busy street and there was a surprisingly large amount of traffic all night.  The nights were warm so we kept the windows open and thus could hear the traffic. The street lights come thru the translucent plastic louvered blinds so the bedrooms don't get dark at night. 

Having laundry facilities was a plus but remember to get change, you'll need 5 quarters for each wash and each dry. "
1002835,57115887,2015-12-22,1756350,Swaroop,Cristina's place is lovely - it was just as described and had all the required amenities. We had a great time staying there for 3 months and hoping to be back soon.
8194782,46812083,2015-09-13,7634188,Josh,"Holly, Forrest and their kids were incredibly welcoming for our first visit to Alki Beach. The newly renovated above-garage apartment is perfectly nestled across from a park and just a block from the beach.  Adorable decor, clean and fully-equiped and a super comfy bed! The apartment is stocked with essentials for a great two night getaway or a relaxing week trip. My wife and I were expecting a cute little spot but we were definitely blown away by the fantastic Alki Beach Hideaway. We will stay here every time we come back to Seattle. 



"
8194782,47802326,2015-09-21,43230453,Catherine,"The apartment is newly built, airy and very clean.  The neighborhood is very quiet even though it is really close to the beach.  We enjoyed a feeling of spaciousness as we could sit and look out on trees and a ball field.  We cooked breakfast both days we were there and found the kitchen to be fully equipped.  We also enjoyed a short walk to the restaurant area across from Alki Beach where we found several good places to eat.  All in all, we found this property to be a great value."
8194782,48628848,2015-09-27,16831627,Linda,Holly made us feel welcome from her first e-mail confirming our stay. The apartment above the garage was new and very comfortable with a nautical theme which was perfect since we were in walking distance of the shoreline. The kitchen was well equipped. The bed was super comfy and the toiletry items she provided for us to use in the bathroom was very thoughtful. The neighborhood was a nice quiet residential area. Holly has a sweet family and dog. We would definitely stay again.
8194782,50702138,2015-10-13,45548270,Beth,"The Alki Beach Hideaway exceeded our expectations. The Hideaway had everything we needed and more. The space is comfortable, cozy and the location can't be beat. We loved our stay at the Alki Beach Hideaway and we will recommend it to others."
8194782,50995077,2015-10-16,45548270,Beth,Holly was a great host. She made us feel welcome and she checked in to make sure we had everything we needed. The Alki Beach Hideaway is perfect and I will recommend it to others.
8194782,51387246,2015-10-19,17412863,Gretchen,Holly's place was great!  It's exactly as described and super clean.  It's easy to get into downtown via car or water taxi and the neighborhood is nice and quiet.  Holly and her husband were really helpful and their restaurant recommendations were on point.  Our stay was much too short and we'll look for Holly's place to be available when we return.  
8194782,58023737,2015-12-31,48405057,Brian,"This space was perfect; clean,
 plenty of space for the two of us, the kitchen and bathrooom were wonderfully stocked. The bedroom was cozy and the seating space was great when we had a couple of visitors.  We would definitely recommend the space to couples and single travelers.  Great location! Alki Beach, the Cascades and Olympic Mtns. were gorgeous!"
5353512,55092224,2015-11-27,36988884,Tristan,"Anna and her place were great! I booked this for my two good friends who had multiple flight delays, and she was awesome about being flexible to meet up with us. Place was nice and clean and very welcoming. "
5353512,56358455,2015-12-12,51028269,Alan,"Nicest things I can say:

1.Anna is a nice girl and friendly.
2.She was prompt to answer all emails and texts in the booking process.
3.The room and home basically looked like the photos.
4.Anna gave us a key so we could come and go
5.When Anna was unable to fulfill the first night, she responsibly took care of the refund from AirBNB.


Room for improvement: 
1.Anna is still new to the AirBNB hosting process and is in a learning curve as to having a system of how clean a rented room and bathroom should be. She’s not up to hotel standards yet.
2.Although the room “looked” as advertised, it was actually a tiny space carefully photographed to look the size of a normal bedroom.
3.The neighborhood: She’s directly across the street from a fenced elementary school playground which made navigating nearly impossible when school let out. Street parking could be unpredictable but we found a spot. 
4.Most of all, she should put on her description that she is in one small apartment in a four-plex and has no control of talking, banging and music from the upstairs neighbors at any hour of the night, directly above your bed.
"
5353512,56468156,2015-12-13,50016240,Scott,"I was waiting until the last minute to book a room, and Anna accepted my room request at 10:59 PM. Within  30 minutes she had tidy room, clean towels, and options for breakfast. The next day she suggested several places I should go see in the city and even offered to let me leave my bags there and go explore. I would highly recommend staying with Anna!

Her dog and cat were also very friendly!"
5353512,56822225,2015-12-18,31982695,Michelle,"Anna made us feel welcome! Her place is in a perfect spot for the buses that go around Seattle. Her dog and cat are very friendly, and the room is cozy! Her pastries are delicious btw :)"
1484651,8557456,2013-11-04,4550247,Sheri & Eric,"The Little Red Day Spa is a unique and very special place. After having our own wonderful experiences here, we sent our friends on their wedding night. They were so overwhelmingly happy for the experience. This place is amazing!!! It's the best place in Seattle for couples and friends to relax in hot tubs, paint each other with mud body paints, and play in this incredible adult oasis. We feel lucky to have access to this place and will be back for more! Thank you Jeff for being such a great host!! :-)"
1484651,14807942,2014-06-26,17200970,Katie,Great place for a couple's getaway! Bed could be more comfortable though
1484651,15082175,2014-07-01,4139399,Matika,"The Little Red Day Spa was one of the most amazing airbnb places I've ever stayed...  Jeff was super welcoming, and helpful (I arrived late, nearly 11pm at night, and he still let me check in). There were lovely chocolates waiting for us by the bed and the entire place felt like a zen retreat. I would definitely stay again."
1484651,15284811,2014-07-06,17177569,Aaron,"Even though I was unable to stay with Jeff, he and Mary were a pleasure to deal with and very quick to respond to any questions or concerns I had.
I hope to be able to stay at the Little Red Day Spa on my next trip to Seattle."
1484651,15722814,2014-07-14,11880561,Steve,"Comfortable, great location, room has a full-sized hot tub and a great shower, very spacious, totally private. Cool and funky atmosphere. It was very warm in the room at night, which I didn't mind (I liked it) but people who like to sleep in a cold space might have a problem. A little noise off in the distance on Saturday night from a late night party bothered me, but I'm a light sleeper--my son slept with no problems. Over all a great place, and very accommodating people."
1484651,15782269,2014-07-15,1385485,Jessica,"The Grand Suite at the Little Red Day Spa is a sensual, warm, and elegant room for a romantic night. The decorations are in deep colors with heavy curtains on the windows, creating an amorously subdued setting. I love host Jeff's paintings on the walls. There are two hot tubs, a freestanding bed, comfy couch, two shower heads (one into the tub!), a table for eating, and a private bathroom. Amber and Jeff warmly greeted us (check in after the spa closes around 7 pm and check out before it opens at 10 am.) and showed us around, then left us to our privacy.  Once we closed the heavy red curtain over the door we were in our own private sanctuary. The complimentary bottle of wine and mellow music were nice touches. The whole atmosphere is one of fun and sensuality. "
1484651,16153794,2014-07-22,2052114,Julia & Trevor,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay here very much. This is a very unique, very romantic place to stay at. When we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised by how big the space is. Then we were thrown another surprise with complementary wine and some yummy little snacks. The art (all by Jeff) was so fun to look at, and it definitely prompted some interesting discussions. We wanted to try everything the space offered, and you have to! The hot tubs, massage tables, aromatherapy, salt scrub, etc. It was the perfect little getaway for us. In addition, as a nursing mom, they were so accommodating of my needs. They let me store my pumped milk in their freezer, which allowed me and my husband to enjoy Seattle without worry. Thank you for that! My only complaint was the sofa bed. They were trying it out with us, but it was so uncomfortable it was difficult to sleep. Since it is a business during the day, they do need a bed that they can easily stow away after the night. I'm interested in other creative ways they will deal with this. We would definitely recommend the Little Red Day Spa though. It's cheaper than a Seattle hotel but it offers so much more! "
1484651,16501344,2014-07-28,17779658,Peter,It was the first time I ever booked a house via AirBnB. Wow! What an exceptional place. The spacious room has two whirl pools. Jeff is a painter and some of his pictures enrich this wonderful and clean temple of living. I highly recommend to stay at this house that has very friendly hosts. Peter
1484651,16683668,2014-07-31,17923696,Terrill,I definitely recommend this place if your looking for a relaxing atmosphere. We had a late flight and checked in late after 11pm and someone was still there to greet us! She was very informative showed us around everything was great! It was warm because of the hot tubs but it still was a great place to stay! 
1484651,17192453,2014-08-08,19536782,Yvonne,"""Divinely appointed with just a hint of wild decadence."" That is how I would describe the Room at the Little Red Day Spa. I stayed only one night as I was in Seattle for a 1-day meeting and it was the perfect place to relax, unwind and feel pampered. Spa Owner Mary confirmed my stay on short notice and had the room prepped for my arrival. It was gorgeous; like a set of the Paris Opera House from Phantom of the Opera. There are two private hot tubs, a wonderful rain-shower and complimentary robes for your use (everything from kimono style to terry-cloth). It's located in an old brewery building and the lofty ceilings are two stories high so there is a wonderful spaciousness about it the photos don't convey and I didn't expect. Large-scale paintings and smaller sculptures were placed throughout the space and the beautiful fabrics (I mean, you enter the space through heavy, wine-colored, velvet curtains) really gave the suite a luxurious feel.

Mary left me a welcome note in addition to the suite's instructions. She invited me to help myself to a glass of  wine in the lobby refrigerator (delish). There is a water cooler and mini-refrigerator inside the suite (very convenient). The neighborhood was a bit industrial as one would expect, so arriving in the evening felt like the area was a little deserted. My cab driver and I had a little difficulty finding the address/entry. It's located behind and to the right of the Tully's coffee shop, in the large brick building. 

I had a great stay there and if I am in Seattle again, I hope to have the opportunity to say at the suite at the Little Red Day Spa again."
1484651,17599971,2014-08-14,14821034,Amber,"Beautiful spa! Jeff made the place very cosy and he was great at communicating with us about the times we were able to come and go. We really appreciated that. We also loved the fact that the bus stops right down the street and there is plants of free parking so travelers can avoid paying expensive rates to park downtown. It can be very hot there in there, but the fans he provided were great. Great experience!"
1484651,17970479,2014-08-19,6222644,Christina,"Jeff and everyone at the spa were very communicative and friendly! The brief tour of the room was very helpful and we had so much fun trying the hot tubs, clay, massage table, and body paints. One of the most creative options I've ever found on Airbnb! An amazing stay that we won't forget. "
1484651,18612833,2014-08-28,2633386,Erik,"This was one of the most amazing AirBNB experiences I've ever had. The space itself is epic, super high ceilings, beautiful woodwork, design, and warm earth tones - reds, browns, dark greens. Jeff's large scale artwork adorns the walls and create and almost Helenic feeling. It feels as if you are in a healing & inspiring paradise of the senses.

Some people on AirBNB have mentioned that the room was too ""warm"" for them. The day we checked in was one of the hottest on record in Seattle and I'm pretty heat sensitive, so I had my concerns. But I didn't find the temperature to be an issue at all. There's a huge industrial door in the back and industrial fan which you can open up if you need a cool breeze. And the fans by the bed were great.

The bed itself was also super comfortable, and we had the best night's sleep we had during our whole stay in Seattle.

If you are considering this as a romantic evening with someone you love, it's going to be totally worth it. Seriously, it's epic. And the hosts are super awesome, laid back, and just great people."
1484651,18817802,2014-09-01,6025690,Melanie,"My partner and I had a fantastic stay at the Little Red Day Spa this past weekend.  We were only in town for one night but Mary made us feel incredibly welcome as soon as we arrived.  The room is beautiful, the bed is comfortable and the perk of taking a midnight hot tub is awesome.  The spa is close to the I-5 and a quick 15-minute (easy) bus ride from downtown Seattle, too, so it's well-located for anything you're planning to get up to.  Thank you Mary and Jeff for your fantastic hospitality! "
1484651,18919407,2014-09-02,19453649,Brendon,"Definitely a fun an unique place to spend a night. Easy to get to and from by public transport; bus and/or light rail (light rail being a good choice to get to the airport if need be).  Jeff et al. were very friendly and helpful when checking in, then left me to my privacy as I enjoyed the amenities. I spent a little time just ogling the building and the decor before settling in. I found the bed and pillows to be very comfortable, and the wifi password to be hilarious!

It's probably worth noting that being an old warehouse style building (albeit beautiful) with two hot tubs and many fans, that the ambient noise level is fairly high. If you are sensitive to this, bringing your own music to plug into the (rather awesome) sound system might help. Or maybe it's just a good excuse to spend more time in the hot tub."
1484651,19716367,2014-09-16,17597687,Jeanette,"This was a very lovely and unique airbnb experience. We booked super last minute (day-of) and Jeff was able to accommodate us. The space is GORGEOUS with extremely high ceilings and ornate decorations. It reminded me of something out of Phantom of the Opera. One of the coolest features was the shower in the middle of the room. It feels surreal to shower in such a beautiful space. 

Since there were spa appointments during the day, we weren't able to spend a ton of time there, but this was clearly communicated with us before we made the reservation. There was also an event happening in an event space behind the spa - Jeff was kind enough to add us to the guest list so we could check it out. "
1484651,31083869,2015-05-01,17263961,Rebecca,"The place was magical. I checked in late, but Jeff was very accommodating. I would love to come back for a romantic weekend. "
1484651,34389181,2015-06-07,5099989,Peter,"My wife and I had a last minute change of plans and ended up having a staycation in town while grandma had the kiddo and man was that the best change of plans ever. This place is incredible, magical, perfect, from the hot tubs to the giant paintings and the body paint, every moment in here was good for the soul."
1484651,35337461,2015-06-17,35033728,Rosario,"Convenient location to downtown Seattle. Jeff, the owner, was very accommodating and helpful, attending to our needs. He makes you feel welcome and at home. Unique property, not your typical room and board, with lots of artwork and spa atmosphere. "
1484651,35518360,2015-06-19,12396288,Alisha,"My boyfriend and I were in town for a Mariner's game, and were looking for somewhere close to the stadium to stay. Jeff's place was in a convenient location, within walking distance, and not far off I-5. Check-in was easy, the room was clean, and access to the spa was just an added bonus!"
1484651,35892787,2015-06-22,36163160,Arturo,The place exceeded expectations. Jeff and his staff are very friendly and accommodating. We were on a road trip and they were extremely flexible with our arrival times. 
1484651,35914543,2015-06-23,450083,Amy,"This was our 2nd time staying at the Little Red Day Spa and this time it was even better. They have made a larger space available to guests and the bed upstairs was lovely to sleep in. 

We were contacted and giving info on how to check in the day before we arrived and were meet at the spa by Stevie who made sure that we got the tour and had everything that we needed. 

It is a wonderful retreat in Seattle with free parking. So perfect for visiting the stadiums."
1484651,36222521,2015-06-26,27843711,Page,Wonderful place to stay.  Jeff and Mary were available for any questions and went out of their way to make us comfortable.  My daughters were with us and have been asking to go back ever since. 
1484651,36324127,2015-06-27,27667951,Jamie,"The space is spacious and unique.  The host was very welcoming and accommodating.  The location was a quick Uber ride from the International district and short walk to the SoDo Link station, which made getting around town a breeze.  There's a Tully's on the same block for a breakfast.  Next time, I'll make time to book a massage! "
1484651,36599301,2015-06-29,35898999,Carrie,"Jeff and Mary are very kind and thoughtful hosts, and they worked very hard to make sure our stay was comfortable. The hostess who checked us in did everything she could to mitigate the fact that we arrived in the midst of an unprecedented heatwave and brought us every fan in the building! We also really appreciated how helpful and flexible they were when there was an initial mishap with our booking dates. The space was clean and comfortable, despite the heat. I particularly liked that the space could accommodate several adults with multiple beds, and had several bathrooms with luxurious bathing options. "
1484651,37879505,2015-07-11,35667758,Geoff,"Our family of four enjoyed our stay at the Little Red Day Spa very much!  We were able to get out and explore Seattle during the day, using public transportation easily.  At night, we refreshed ourselves with a hot tub or a bath and explored Jeff's beautiful artwork.  We are early risers which was probably just fine since the weekday traffic noise did build up quickly.  Mary was very responsive to our questions, and made sure that we had everything we needed.  "
1484651,38296469,2015-07-14,28292059,Sean,"This place is great for anyone who wants to take advantage of a relaxing nights stay.  The listing had great amenities, the check in was very easy, and Jeff was very communicative to all my concerns.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a tranquil retreat. "
1484651,38597119,2015-07-17,232719,Staci,Super great place! Staff was amazingly sweet and helpful! The space is unique and the artist is very talented. Lots of perks with hot tub and sauna use!
1484651,39089772,2015-07-20,19215995,Stuart,"What an incredible discovery! The accommodation was fantastic, the facilities were sublime, and whole experience was a pleasure. Thank you for making this wonderful place available to guests - what a treat!"
1484651,39229778,2015-07-21,29370673,Tina,"We checked in Sunday and were greeted by one of the workers at the spa.  Never met Mary or Jeff.  Although she was friendly, the young woman was not able to provide info on things such as how to get around or places to eat.  The area is pretty isolated it seems as it is in an industrial area. I suggest that maybe a guest book with bus or metrolink info as well as places to eat nearby be provided for guests.  On to the accommodations.  Being that so many people gave such high ratings, my expectations were high.  I hate to say it but I was disappointed. The place is unbearably HOT!!. Might be a good thing in winter but our stay was in summer.  Had to sleep with the fan blowing in my face all night to be remotely comfortable.  Especially upstairs where the beds are. The room is interesting but is in need of some updating.  One bed is just a mattress on the floor and the other has an extremely soft mattress.  Our heavy material at the windows fell at some point since they were not really drapes but just clipped up at the window.  This place has potential but needs some attention to detail.  Having access to an iron to take the wrinkles out of our clothes once we unpacked would have been nice.  On the good note, bathrooms are very nice and having the body scrubs were a nice touch.  Mary was also very accommodating in allowing up to stay way past check out since we had a late flight and the spa is closed on Monday. And it is nice to have the place to yourself. But overall I found the place to be very dark and in need of more attention.  Wish I could give a better review but have to be honest. "
1484651,39587806,2015-07-24,21321202,Sean,"What an amazing place!  I had a last minute meeting in Seattle and needed a place to crash.  Within minutes of requesting a reservation, i was emailed by the host.  They were able to accommodate me and were extremely friendly on the emails.  The place is honestly AMAZING!  "
1484651,39684536,2015-07-25,38469845,Aaron,"When arriving at the Little Red Day Spa, it takes just a second to adjust to the fact that there is no receptionist desk, or the standard spa feel with product line plastering the walls and sale signs on everything from candles to lotions.  Instead, you walk into the door of a charming historic building with renovation touches that compliment the tradition within.  One can not help but immediate notice the 20 foot tall paintings, the old hardwood floors from yesteryear, and of course this is your impression just in the blink of an eye.

The Moroccan room is the room that is offered for couples (or a party of 4) which is up on the third floor. The iron staircase you climb to the top is adorned with lighting both ambient and whimsical and more paintings and wall murals adorn your trip to the top.  Once into the long rectangular room, one notices that this is going to be unlike any stay one has every had before.  The lighting is most certainly inspired by a Moroccan theme and the wood furniture, all help reinforce the theme. The room has a bohemian sparseness about it that makes one instantly feel comfortable.

While we didn't use the cable tv, or the Amazon Prime movies that were offered, we did enjoy having the run of the place after the staff left. The hot tub in the Art room was wonderful and all the little touches that were left around for our use were kindly used. Scented Sea Salt rubs for the skin helped remove the clay mud applications that we placed on each other and the giant rainfall shower helped cleaned us off.

The best thing about the Little Red Day Spa is its promising potential. While already getting a solid 5 stars from us, this unique venue has so many blank walls for the host to adorn with his paintings or murals that I am eager to return again in a year and see how much greater an already great thing can be!"
1484651,39958903,2015-07-27,30991771,Rachel,"Though somewhat tucked away in an industrial area, based out of a section of the old Ranier Brewery, the Little Red Day Spa offers amazing space, soaring ceilings on the main floor, to the large bedroom loft on the third floor, rich fabrics and soft lighting... Mary, the General Manager of the day spa, Stevie, and staff were friendly and helpful, and ensured we had a comfortable stay. For a unique Airbnb experience, the Little Red Day Spa is a must see."
1484651,40532262,2015-07-31,377488,Marc,"It was great, they actually have a team of people around working on various aspects of customer service. When you show up at the front door though, they are 100% focused on you. I had phenomenal communication from this team of people. 

Pretty much everything people are saying about the unique charming character of the place and the artwork and amenities are spot on. I won't restate them. "
1484651,40696451,2015-08-01,39753210,Annie,"What a great find in the Seattle area - way better than staying at an overpriced hotel! Booking was a breeze, I mainly communicated with Mary the spa/reservation manager who made sure there was someone there to greet us and make sure we had everything we needed to get settled in. The rooms were clean, spacious and beds comfy. We also made full use of the spa facilities (mud, salt scrubs, etc...) and hot tubs, which were a treat after a long day of shopping. One little thing I would caution on is that the rain shower downstairs beside the hot tub can get a bit slippery especially if you've followed instructions and showered with soap before getting into the tub. So to avoid a tumble like I did either bring flip flops (highly recommended) or tread carefully if you decide to take a rinse after soaking in the tub. Otherwise a great stay and would definitely return! "
1484651,41176028,2015-08-04,9132719,Jenalee,"The little red day spa was truly a treat and place I would love to return to. We started our arrival off by first visiting the winery next door and enjoying a lovely tasting. We then checked in and were shown to our room. We chose to stay on the second floor suite with the master bathroom. Both suites were beautiful, but the third floor suite is much much bigger in real life then it shows in the picture. I thought it was only the floor bed when I looked online so we booked the 2nd floor suite. Doing it again, we would probably choose the 3rd floor suite-not to take away from the room we stayed in, which was absolutely beautiful as well. 
My husband and I enjoyed the spa to the fullest. I was expecting a small space with a hot tub and maybe a couple of massage tables but we were blown away. 
Upon our arrival there was music playing, candles lit and the hot tub ready (with the perfect temperature for summer). A beautiful grand space with body scrub and mud mask were out for us to enjoy. We left feeling totally relaxed, reconnected and completely pampered. 
I couldn't recommend this place enough. Jeff's artistry really shows in every corner of the little red day spa. "
1484651,41568402,2015-08-07,1826258,Anutham,"The suite at the Little Red Day spa is excellent and great value for money. The hot tub in the lobby was a great amenity and my wife enjoyed the complementary mud pack. I didn't get to try the sauna on this trip. 

Highly recommend this to anyone looking to unwind after a long day of checking out all that Seattle has to offer. "
1484651,42437807,2015-08-13,8354431,Beth,"Had a good stay. The use of the spa during the evening was a nice perk! The location was convenient for getting to the metro to head downtown or to the stadiums. Please note that when staying in the room on the third floor, if there is someone in the suite on the second floor, you will be required to use the communal bathroom on the first floor. "
1484651,42630478,2015-08-14,41060442,Adam,"Host's were very welcoming and flexible with arrival times. The spa was clean, nice, and has a very relaxing feel to it ( go figure! ). A little warm on the 3rd level when we arrived, but with the fans provided in the room we were able to sleep well. Would definitely stay again."
1484651,42669297,2015-08-15,11002372,Ann,It was a great experience. Such a nice hot tub. Convient to the metro link. Inside the old Ranier brewery!
1484651,42860045,2015-08-16,33430269,Nancy,We had a great time and the whole process of checking in and out was very easy.  Loved the accomidations and the people there were very friendly and quite helpful. 
1484651,43705928,2015-08-21,29644991,Courtney,"The hosts were attentive and welcoming.  They let us drop our bags off early which was much appreciated.  However, when we returned to our room for the evening our experience was not so great.  Someone walked in to our private bathroom while it was in use.  The inner door to the bathroom was closed but we did not see an outer door to the hallway and another guest walked in.  This was partially our mistake but we feel that the owners should make it clear that the bedroom/bathroom on the second floor are private.   There was also loud drumming coming from one of the other buildings in the complex.   The location is not a residential area so the drumming may have come from another business.  We contacted the owner and both issues were addressed but the experience was unsettling. The bathroom was beautiful but the bedroom was dark and did not have windows.  The bedroom was long and had a bed and a massage table so I assume it is used during the day for massage.  The mattress on the bed was nice but we both had trouble sleeping  because the room was quite warm and stuffy.  There was a small fan and we left the bathroom door open to allow for air from the bathroom window but it was still uncomfortable.  This location may be a good option for some because it is reasonably priced and the owners were helpful but we did not have a great experience.   "

1484651,44209658,2015-08-24,13906732,Rupa,"My husband and I were very excited to stay here for our anniversary. A few words of advice for people booking here, however. 

Call ahead and schedule your check-in time. We didn't do this and we weren't able to check-in until about 4.30. We called a number of times earlier in the day but Mary was in session with clients and couldn't pick up the phone. We hung out at Bartholomew wine next door which is awesome. 

Secondly, before you make your reservation, get clear information on the use of the hot tub, sauna and other communal areas. Again, we were excited to arrive in the afternoon and have time to use the sauna and hot tub before heading out for the night. We were able to use the sauna which was great but the staff seemed a bit annoyed about turning it on and giving us access to the room. We were really sad when we found out that clients were using the room with the hot tub and we wouldn't have access until 10pm. 10pm became 11pm and we had an early flight in the morning - just a bit disappointed. 

We stayed in the Sky Suite which is spacious and the bathroom is great and was very clean. The bed is essentially a mattress on the floor and that was fine, but there are no windows in that bedroom. Also, the door to this bedroom does not lock - that always makes me nervous given that other guests are wandering around the spa at all times. 

While the downstairs was a bit dark and dim, this didn't bother us too much because we checked in so late in the day.

We didn't have too much interaction with the staff and while everything was fairly explained to us, we were just disappointed overall, especially at $224 a night. We were excited to celebrate our anniversary and had mentioned this to Jeff ahead of time. We had read other reviews of wine and the like being provided but I think given how busy the spa was that day, we were a bit of an afterthought. 

Overall, very cool venue, I would just be sure you can check in early and if you do, that you can actually use some of the services in the Spa. "
1484651,46142237,2015-09-08,33236710,Evans,"The Little Red Day Spa is an absolute gem in the midst of an industrial part of the city. My brother and I stayed here for labor day weekend and were able to check in a little early and leave whenever it was convenient for us on the day of check out. The whole checking in and out process was thoroughly easy. Jeff and Mary are absolutely accommodating and kept us informed of what is to be expected (with their spa clients, hours of operation, etc). We were able to use the spa facility which was very nice. We felt as if we stayed in our own home. This is most definitely, a recommended spot! "
1484651,46839846,2015-09-13,43809741,Jon,Amazing place and great price for what you get!
1484651,48362962,2015-09-25,7174253,Kolton,Was so great staying here! The room was great and use of the spa was a huge bonus. 
1484651,48916509,2015-09-29,25263939,Elizabeth,"My friends and I had a wonderful experience staying in the Moroccan suite at the spa! The location is convenient to downtown, the room is huge and fit three women and all our stuff easily, and everyone working at the spa is so welcoming. They have bottles of wine for purchase (only $10) and it was delicious. We weren't at the spa much, since we were out exploring both days we were in Seattle, but every time we came back it was so peaceful and relaxing to be there. We especially loved the little fireplace and cashews on the mantle in the lobby!"
1484651,53306950,2015-11-07,18578979,Jonathan,"We were in late at night and out early in the mornings, so unfortunately we didn't get a chance to interact with the hosts in person, but they were very responsive and helpful by text message.  The room was great - two comfortable beds, tastefully decorated, and all the amenities you would hope for.   

The downstairs areas were absolutely incredible and are the main reason I would highly recommend staying here.  The hot tub and shower room is enormous (20ft+ ceilings), beautifully lit, and filled with amazing paintings.   Showering in that room in the morning was the best way to wake up."
