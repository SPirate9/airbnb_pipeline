3637180,39779854,2015-07-26,35332427,Sarah,"Lynda was a terrific host.  She was welcoming and informative about the neighborhood.  Having yogurt and bagels available for us in the morning was a huge plus, it got us off on the right foot each morning before heading out to explore Seattle.  The neighborhood was great with a lot of restaurants within walking distance.  We would definitely recommend staying with Lynda during your trip to Seattle!"
3637180,40642692,2015-08-01,15471370,Yonina,"Though my stay was short, it was very pleasant. Bed is very comfortable and the room was very cool, plus especially during hot summers. "
3637180,40993323,2015-08-03,39046730,Kathleen,"Lynda was an attentive host and provided quick call-backs despite being out of town at times. Clean room and bathroom. Spent one afternoon relaxing on the back deck overlooking the charming garden. Excellent location for walking to coffee shops (hey this is Seattle!), shops and restaurants."
3637180,41403651,2015-08-07,9941634,Saori,"Lynda was really accommodating for our arrival and has welcomed us, she is an opened person. With a lot of hobbies . The house is near from public Transportation and green Lake. You can enjoy birds songs outside on the deck. 
Room is small but enough for two. 
Bathroom is shared with other airbnb guests. All was clean and fresh. 
If your airbnb neighbors are noisy You might hear them in the bathroom. 
This was a Nice stay in Seattle. Thank You for all!"
3637180,41784991,2015-08-09,35965605,Kelci,"It was a great place to stay at while in Seattle, Lynda helped us with getting around via public transportation which was only a street up from her house. She is also super responsive and gets back quickly with messages."
3637180,42374945,2015-08-13,28281623,Christian,"Lynda was a great host. During our stay she was very kind, helpful and cheerful. We enjoyed chatting with her a lot. Lynda's place is an excellent location to stay and to visit Seattle, highly recommend!"
3637180,47841189,2015-09-21,6248026,Li,"Lynda is a great host. Her house is super clean, exactly like in the picture. Her house is 200 meters from bus station route 5 and 82, with 20-30 mins to downtown. "
3637180,48448079,2015-09-26,44105793,Emily,"Lynda was a wonderful host! From the moment she opened the door to saying goodbye, she made me feel very welcome in her home.  She left very clear instructions on how her house worked, which made things easy.  The room was very cosy and bed comfortable.  I very much enjoyed having breakfast and fresh coffee with Lynda in the mornings! Her house is very conveniently located to shops and services on Phinney Ridge and a bus route into town.  I would definitely recommend this Air B&B :)  "
3637180,49121115,2015-10-01,923776,Kathy,Lynda was a great host again. Definitely made me feel welcomed in her home. It's in a great location and coming and going was never an issue. I was the only guest again for the last few days of my stay which is always nice. Thanks again!
3637180,50307570,2015-10-11,5774758,Pam,"Although my host wasn't able to be here during my stay, we messaged before and during the stay. Room and bathroom were very clean and comfortable. Everything was just as described on airbnb. Even at a distance, Lynda is a gracious host.  I'll be back!"
3637180,51240342,2015-10-18,33530750,Sarah,"I had a wonderful time staying at Lynda's adorable home, which was in the perfect location (blocks from the beautiful Green Lake, near lots of restaurants, close to everything!). She was an incredibly thoughtful host in every regard, from providing nice towels and bathroom/shower supplies to offering a wide variety of breakfast foods each morning and snacks/drinks for the daytime. I enjoyed talking with Lynda each morning over coffee, fruit, danishes and bagels, and she made me feel right at home in a city so new to me. I highly recommend staying at Lynda's - she's fabulous! "
3637180,51684151,2015-10-22,33378311,Justin,Awesome space. Super cozy bed. Wish I had time to stay longer.
3637180,52170004,2015-10-26,883581,Joe,"Lynda is truly the best host a traveler could ask for.  Check-in was super simple and she communicated everything to me in advance.  The room was exactly as described and the bed was super comfy...totally slept like a baby!  Lynda is always available and very eager to answer any questions that I had.  

The house is a very welcoming and warm home and I would recommend anyone to spend time here."
3637180,52527614,2015-10-30,46502804,Jiyoung,"I visited US first time in my life and I stayed in Lynda's house for 2 days. It was really nice staying, she was so kind, cared of me much. 
I'm very satisfied with staying her house and I'm sure that I would stay there when I visit Seattle again :) 
Lynda ! Thank you for everything !!
"
3637180,55701900,2015-12-04,39383551,Rachel,"Lynda is the most wonderful and accommodating hostesses you could ever ask for. Lovely and clean rooms, a generous supply of towels, and toiletries, a small fridge and microwave, and she even let us do laundry. Are you from out of town? New to the area? Lynda had plenty of tourist information and sightseeing info, along with menus from the local eatries near by to browse. Also, the location is pretty fantastic. 
We booked extremely last minute, out of emergency, and Lynda was so kind to respond to our request right away. Despite the lateness of our arrival, Lynda greeted us and gave a quick tour of our space. She is such a gem, and a pleasure. I highly recommend her."
3637180,55834241,2015-12-06,17531716,Marc,"We had a great stay at Lynda's. Accommodations were clean, tidy, and quaint, with generous amenities. Sleep was very pleasant, as the room has minimal street noise and was a comfortable temperature. Coming and going as we pleased was also great, and with a bus stop just a block away, it was easy to get around the city."
3637180,56216176,2015-12-10,45834836,Kristen,"I had a great stay at Lynda's house.  She has two units in the basement with a bathroom shared between then.  Carpet throughout the basement is grand but I did wish that I'd packed my slippers.  Lynda has pamphlets of what to do in the area (local neighborhood and Seattle) and has located them outside the bathroom.  As I was in town during a very wet period, Lynda kindly provided a space heater which was great when I came home drenched after exploring the neighborhood.  The surrounding neighborhood is very nice with many coffee shops, restaurants, and bars all within walking distance on Greenwood.  

I was here for work commuting to Bothell and had a pretty easy drive as Lynda's home is located on a prime street for freeway access.  There isn't always enough parking on the street outside the home, but there is plenty on the next street over.  This works out really well as the parallel streets aren't as busy and it's probably safer for opening car doors.  

Overall I would highly recommend staying here if you're looking for a place that allows you to easily explore the Phinney Ridge/Green Lake neighborhoods on foot.  "
3637180,56540215,2015-12-14,48442123,Cheryl,"Lynda is a wonderful and welcoming host. The location is great and her bed was even better. Next time I'm in Seattle, I know I'll be staying here."
3637180,57744106,2015-12-28,52440930,Sean,We stayed at Lynda s place for a night and was very nice and quiet. You feel it like your home and I suggest this place to others. The place is very close to downtown.
7733192,44022524,2015-08-23,36310193,Mario,"From the very beginning David and Jeff were amazing. They were quick to communicate and accommodate. The house is amazing beyond words. The pics don't do it justice. The views from around the home are postcard worthy. The neighborhood is quiet but close. The space needle and surrounding attractions are a short walk away, and since traffic is the only drawback I would recommend walking. Trying to leave the area during peak traffic times is a challenge so have alternate routes planned. But seriously, when you are in this home, you don't want to leave. The clean modern feel and the quality of everything from the furniture to the lighting and appliances makes this home probably the single most incredible place I've ever spent the night. David and Jeff were traveling on the other side of the world but were so great in making sure everything was perfect. Their commitment to the little things was amazing. A relative of mine had asked for hand towels and although they (and I) don't use them, a package arrived with some the very next morning. That was such a small but poignant gesture to me, and it speaks to how much they truly want you to feel at home and have an amazing experience. The master bedroom has the single most amazing shower I've ever seen. It's a steam room, shower, bath, combination that will literally change your day. A long nights cure with a world class view. We truly loved every moment that we had at their home. I hosted family from across the USA in my hometown of Seattle here for my brothers wedding and I can't tell you with words how much being there instead of hotels made the trip unforgettable for all of us. The world class kitchen beckoned us to cook and stay in rather than go out to eat and that truly is a huge factor in how we all felt so at home and enjoyed more time together...and I think it actually saved us money. I would recommend this home and these hosts to anyone coming to Seattle that wants to break away from the usual BS of hotels like $40 parking and $10 water while still basking in luxury. David and Jeff are true gentlemen and I hope to visit their home again. From the moment we walked in and were greeted with champagne to the moment we had to leave... Unbelievable and unforgettable. Flawless and perfect! Thanks you!"
7733192,44823132,2015-08-29,2890964,Ellis,"I stayed here with two of my coworkers for three nights. David and Jeff's house is amazing - the view, the architecture, the decor. Everything was extremely comfortable, the location is great, and they were kind enough to leave Prosecco and sparkling water in the fridge for us. Ideal location -  a lovely walk over to Queen Anne Ave, short ride to downtown, and in a charming neighborhood. We had absolutely no complaints, only good things to say about everything. We truly enjoyed our stay and would love to stay there again!"
7733192,45513858,2015-09-03,41954414,Mia,"Beautiful modern home with great furnishings, artwork, and breathtaking views of the city. An urban oasis. David was a very accommodating host!"
7733192,46427436,2015-09-10,11723942,Erik,"David was an outstanding host, meeting us at the property with mimosas ready. He gave us a quick, but detailed tour of the house which included how to use the high tech electronic equipment and terrific built-in coffee maker. He made it very clear that he would be available to answer any questions or problems we had with the property, but our stay was problem free

The house was spectacular with  2 levels of decks that had views of downtown, the Space Needle, and a view of Lake Union with frequent float planes landing. The house itself appears new and all the appliances are high end. There was interesting artwork scattered throughout the house. The kitchen was amazingly stocked with every kitchen utensil and pot and pan you could possibly need. And the coffee machine which made outstanding coffee was definitely a highlight every morning as we started our day.

The family space was very comfortable with a large sectional sofa in front of the gas fireplace. There was a separate media room with wide screen TV, as well as TVs in the 2 master bedrooms. The top floor bedroom has a panoramic view of downtown and Lake Union, and it was sunny enough to even see Mount Rainer. The shower in the top floor master was spectacular with 2 rainforest-type shower heads. The bathroom was large with plenty of room for 2. The second master on a lower floor had an en suite bath as well; the 3rd bedroom across the hall from the second master had a bath accessible from the hallway. The beds were comfortable and the house is set back far enough from traffic that we heard no street noise at night.

The location in the Queen Anne neighborhood was great, with several restaurants within walking distance; we ate at the casual and funky Citizen as well as the more substantial restaurant, Crow. The Space Needle, EMP Museum, Chihuly Museum, Children's Museum and Children's Theatre are all within a brisk 20 minute walk (the walk back is uphill, however).

Nearby there are multiple shops and restaurants on Queen Anne Avenue which is only ~10 minute drive away. Stores such as Trader Joe's, Safeway and Bartell Drug Store are all close together. We had an excellent breakfast at the Le Reve Bakery and El Diablo Coffee Shop is right next door.

Downtown and major freeways are all easily accessible. The property has a drive under garage with room in the driveway for a second car, as well as street parking.

If you are looking for a luxury rental in Seattle with great views, this property should definitely be on your list. The host was extremely helpful and accommodating, but as well-stocked and new as this house is, you should have no problems!"
7733192,47327631,2015-09-17,19071152,David,We had the most amazing stay in Seattle thanks to David and this gorgeous house. David was absolutely fantastic: helpful and made everything very easy for us to navigate the house. The rooms will offer the most spectacular view you can demand of a private house in Seattle. Everything was clean and spotless. The  prosecco waiting for us in the fridge was also a nice touch. Without hesitation we will stay in this house as long as we have the opportunity to do so. Indulge yourself if you can... in what will be an experience to remember.  Thanks David and look forward to visiting again beautiful Seattle!
7733192,47763172,2015-09-21,35718534,Nicholas,"My wife and her friends had an amazing weekend staying at David and Jeff's house. From what I'm told, the worst part of the weekend was having to leave. The house was immaculate, and the owners communicated very well. Would definitely rent from them again. "
7733192,49066658,2015-09-30,44533051,Emily,"As a local producer in Seattle, I was so excited to find David and Jeff's beautiful home for a marketing photo shoot. We spent two days in this luxurious gem in lower Queen Anne and it was perfect in every way. David went out of his way to accommodate us and any particular needs we had from the beginning. He made himself readily available to us for any questions or concerns, and was a pleasure to work with. His home is something from a modern dream, with views of lake Union and the city that you couldn't imagine. I will definitely be back :)"
7733192,53345125,2015-11-08,14641409,Kelvie,"This home is spectacular in every way!  The view was amazing even in stormy November weather.  The house is beautifully furnished and provides everything you could possibly need.  David was a very attentive host.  Not only did he respond promptly to our questions, he even left champagne and a birthday card for our celebration "
7733192,55109624,2015-11-28,5926391,Will,"David and Jeff are perfect hosts. They remained attentive to all of our needs, and took excellent care of us throughout the entire stay. We enjoyed a perfect Thanksgiving in their beautiful home."
7733192,57454838,2015-12-26,49598681,Gene,The view is fantastic! And the Space Needle is just outside of windows. We also love the whole deco of the house and decks. Very artistic. We absolutely enjoyed our stay here and nice wine. LAnd we appreciate your hospitality! 
7733192,57946332,2015-12-30,10298924,Allan,"This property was amazing and comfortable and worth every cent.  David was friendly, welcomed us with open arms and made himself completely available in case there were any problem... which there were none.  Strongly recommend and will stay at this property again. "
7733192,58227296,2016-01-01,42445644,Jessica,Amazing location and very spacious. David was very helpful and quick to respond! Would definitely stay here again. 
1055661,4957406,2013-06-03,4135597,Rees,"Darik was a great host! he has great communication and we had an excellent time at his place.  His place is even more amazing in person... incredibly clean, spacious, private and spotless! better than high end hotels.  I would highly recommend him again and re-book this spot on my next trip to Seattle!"
1055661,5127862,2013-06-14,956582,Melissa,"Darik's apartment was very clean and nice. He came and showed us around and then gave us our privacy, but if we needed him he was readily available. This apartment is in my favorite spot in Seattle. Close to all the trendy and best restaurants. 10 minute walk to Pike's Place. 15 minute walk to shopping and movies. View of the ocean.  "
1055661,5557946,2013-07-06,817386,Amy,"a wonderful stay in this very comfortable condo.  all the conveniences of home, beautiful views and a convenient location.  we definitely would stay again.  Darik was very helpful."
1055661,5673877,2013-07-11,5783460,Shailaja,We had a wonderful stay at this conveniently located place in downtown! The host was extremely courteous. The apartment was sparkling clean and kept well. Seems like a lot of thought went into making the guests feel comfortable. Five stars for this one!
1055661,7161114,2013-09-09,5625913,Dwight,Very nice place to stay close to Pikes Place Market and the Waterfront. Even though it is a busy part of town it was a very quiet condo. The condo was well equipped and comfortable. Hide-a-beds are not known for being comfortable but this condo had a nice fold out bed. I would highly recommend.
1055661,7427974,2013-09-19,8538969,Fran,We booked this apartment very last minute. Darik could not have made it easier. He was quick to respond and very helpful. The location was perfect for walking to most of the sights we wanted to visit. He has compiled an excellent binder of great places to visit and outstanding restaurants to try all within walking distance. We spent two wonderful (sunny) days getting to know Seattle better. We'll be back and will definitely try to stay here. 
1055661,9126782,2013-12-09,2559074,Reinaldo,Superb experience! The apartment is great and the staff was extremely helpful.
1055661,9270595,2013-12-17,9454241,Lisa,This is a great apartment in Belltown. I rented it out for my family that was coming to town. It has great views of the water and it's on the 5th floor so it's high enough that you can't hear much noise from the street. The apartment was a nice size and bed was comfortable. Check in was super easy too! Location is fantastic there are tons of restaurants less than a block away. I would rent this out again next time I have visitors. 
1055661,10446016,2014-02-19,7616456,Margaret,We had a great time here.  It was like a home away from home. Thank you Darik. Everyone extremely helpful and everything worked like clockwork. We would definitely stay here again and certainly recommend it to others 
1055661,15507960,2014-07-10,17119161,Rosanne,"Location, location location. Clean and better than any hotel room we stayed at on our trip. We would love to stay here again for more than two days!"
1055661,16076958,2014-07-22,13760000,Ben,Everything was very clean and tidy. The views from the building were amazing and the amenities within the building were very accommodating. There was some conflict among my friends over whether to cook and exploit the very well equipped kitchen that Darik has provided or to eat out at one of the many amazing restaurants only steps away from this place. I would quickly stay here again if I were to enjoy another visit to Seattle.
1055661,24177281,2014-12-22,5175016,Justine,"Perfect place to stay in Seattle! The location was excellent! We were able to walk to most things in the city, and we loved having amazing coffee shops and restaurants within blocks of the apartment. 

The apartment itself was very clean, big enough for two couples, and had everything we needed. 

Thanks so much! We had a great time!"
1055661,28416504,2015-03-23,20761552,Eva,Darik met us at arrival and showed us around the apartment.  Then had a walk through all amenities in the building. The apartment was well stocked and  so conveniently located.  It was a very comfortable stay and we had a wonderful weekend.
1055661,28545878,2015-03-25,29091268,Michael,Entire experience was top-notch.  Facility was clean and modern.  Room had clean / modern furnitures.  Host was accommodating and well organized.
1055661,54613466,2015-11-22,3901414,Helene,Great location!  Great communication.  Can't wait to come again!
8017832,50355586,2015-10-11,45111354,Ben,"Rich was great about communication in a timely manner.  The place even better than I expected:  clean, comfortable bed, excellent location.  I was able to take some very nice walks nearby to dinner.  Plenty of privacy and plenty of space.  Thanks Rich. "
8017832,53622485,2015-11-10,38661382,Pamela,Rich is easily the best host you could ever ask for. He really goes above and beyond to create a warm and inviting atmosphere for his guests. His experience and passion for hosting guests is illustrated through every detail and nuance throughout the house. My girlfriend and I stayed with Rich for over a month while we were looking for more permanent housing throughout Seattle. We couldn't have picked a better place to stay. Take our word for it and check out this place. You'll never want to leave! :)
8017832,54323181,2015-11-18,46592426,Peter,"Rich was a fantastic host. He was very reasonable and accommodating when it came to working with our travel plans (including some spontaneous ones). Rich was timely in his communications and was very attentive to any questions I had about his place or the city in general. He would also check in just to make sure everything was to our liking. Rich also came and went a couple times during my stay but he was careful to be as un-intrusive as possible and we never actually saw him until the last day. 

The location was great as well. It was just a short car-ride/uber/bus-ride into downtown and if we didn't feel like going into down town we only had to walk a couple blocks before we were among some great restaurants. We were also within walking distance of a couple grocery stores. 

This was my first time using Airbnb and it definitely lived up to the praise my friends have given it. Rich was a big part of making our trip great."
8017832,54779258,2015-11-23,46348244,Ron,"Rich was a very good Host! Close to Restaurants and shopping. Less than 15 minutes to Downtown. Parking was ok, in a residential community so what would you expect? Friendly neighbors!"
8017832,56187020,2015-12-10,46521224,Simone,"Das Haus von Rich ist wundervoll. Es strahlt so viel Wärme und Geborgenheit aus. Ich habe mich mehr als wie Zuhause (website hidden) ist sehr sehr sauber und geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Rich ist zu jeder Zeit erreichbar und sehr hilfsbereit. Die Lage ist ideal um schnell in der City zu sein. Restaurants,Bars und Supermärkte sind leicht zu Fuss erreichbar. Wenn die höchste Punktzahl eine 10 wäre würde ich Rich 100 geben. Leider passt das Haus nicht in meinem Koffer sonst würde ich heute in seinem Wohnzimmer am Kamin sitzen! Vielen Dank für alles Rich!"
6831239,42792278,2015-08-15,37736784,Congrui,the room is very cozy with a lot of space
6831239,43571388,2015-08-20,21754525,Maggie,Clean and quiet place at a reasonable price. Recommend. 
6831239,44473336,2015-08-26,17327451,George,Great room with a comfy bed.  Easy to check in and check out.
6831239,44857709,2015-08-29,28255144,Emily,"The room was very clean, but a little far to walk anywhere. The bus line ran almost right past the house though. I didn't get to meet Jennifer, but she was very welcoming through text message when I arrived to the house. "
6831239,46239460,2015-09-08,42076215,Alan,Hello Jennifer just wanted to say thank you for you for hosting me on my trip.
6831239,47101428,2015-09-15,40302826,Tatiana,"Останавливалась на неделю.  Дом под сдачу, все комнаты сдаются, живут в основном азиаты. Очень чисто, люди соблюдают правила по уборке за собой общих мест, все вежливы. Можно пользоваться кухней, посудой, холодильником. Дом находится в абсолютно жилом районе, до остановки автобуса идти 3-4 минуты. До центра на автобусе занимает 40-45 минут. Ближайший крупный супермаркет 25 мин.пешком, на автобусе около 3-4 остановок. Вечером абсолютно никого нет на улицах. Хозяйка не живет в доме, приезжает убираться, но связь через сообщения с ней мгновенная. Очень понравилось. Спасибо."
6831239,48127004,2015-09-23,43230099,Evie,"The room is clean, quiet and comfortable. The 36 bus line runs right by the house, so if you don't mind making some transfers you can get around Seattle fairly easily. Public transportation in Seattle is cheap and efficient, so it really is very doable. Beacon Hill is a cute neighborhood, but you'll need to walk about a mile plus to find a place that sells food, and most of that will be without sidewalks. You are not permitted to eat in your room, so keep that in mind as well. 

The listing suggests that towels are provided, but I never saw a towel anywhere. Not a huge deal, but the listing could be more accurate. Bring a towel! Many people will probably prefer using their own anyway. 

Part of the reason that I chose this listing over some others is that I was more comfortable with a female host, however the only adult in the house at any time was a man. The host's very young stepdaughter handled both my check in and check out. Hosts do not allow shoes in the house and ask that you leave your shoes outside."
6831239,48323401,2015-09-25,32419224,Loren,"Home is very nice and clean. The room is comfortable with a desk and lamp where I was able to work at the computer in the evenings, so I appreciate that. This was my third time staying here, and the entire family is very welcoming. Nice neighborhood and it's close to Georgetown and Sodo. I look forward to staying here again in the future. "
6831239,49672414,2015-10-05,21989004,Allen,"I once again had a very nice stay here. The hosts were accommodating of my schedule, the house is very clean and conveniently located, and the hosts are great people."
5062445,32440775,2015-05-17,32844326,Isabella,"Chris is very friendly and helpful! I was looking for a place to stay and needed a response soon. Contacted four hosts, and Chris was the only one responded, and responded in time! He apologized for not being able to show me around because his band had a major show during that weekend. (Guys- they do have a GREAT taste in music- come here if you do, too)

The house is in a great neighborhood. You have Trader Joe's right across the street, literally. AND lots of fantastic restaurants, cafe, gift stores, etc. surrounded. This would be the perfect neighborhood to live in. All the things- within walking distance.

You'll be sharing a bathroom with other roommates (but that wasn't a problem for me at all). If you're looking for a place to crash that's within walking distance to everything, this is perfect for you.

I'm very happy with my stay, and hope other guests enjoy the location as well. :)"
5062445,34162323,2015-06-05,4502256,Elisa,"Chris' place was the perfect homebase in Seattle! Big Friendly house,cosy bedroom in a lively and vibrant neighborhood full of cafes and bars, amazing to chill out in the morning before walking downtown in just over half hour. Chris was also a very sweet host, he came to see me when I arrived to Seattle, gave me the keys and directed me to his house because he was working at that time. 
During my stay I was out all day but we had a few good chat at night. He's really a good fellow! Great music taste and very easy to get along with.
I promised my self to be back in Seattle again and I'll definitely stay at his again!"
5062445,35270046,2015-06-16,35395550,Nathan,Great location.  Good food nearby and easy bus access.  DEFINITELY give this place a chance.  Chris is super accommodating and if your schedules align is great hang as well.
5062445,42254182,2015-08-12,8196654,Mengzhe,Christ is such a nice guy. He gave me a very warm welcome on my first day in Seattle. Introduced the neighborhood and told me a lot of staff about his music. The place is lovely and so quiet at night. I had a memorable stay because of this cute home. And the location is wonderful. Very close to downtown. Just few minutes away. I would definitely recommend Christ's place!
5062445,45416946,2015-09-02,41626176,Jared,"Chris is awesome!  Very friendly and welcoming.  Really dig the house and the neighborhood.  

Great location, loved the vibe of the neighborhood and having Trader Joe's and El Diablo Coffee right there.  "
5062445,46167437,2015-09-08,15153739,Jess,"Chris and his roommates were great hosts! They were very friendly, accommodating, and fun. I traveled to Seattle alone and they made it so I did not feel lonely. The house is located very conveniently to downtown, I did not have a car while I was in Seattle and managed to get around just fine via public transit (and the occasional Uber). I definitely recommend staying at Chris's if you are looking for an affordable and convenient location in Seattle!   "

1442973,7382644,2013-09-17,1001111,Kassi,"Excellent darling house! Plenty of space, natural light, and all the comforts you could need. Plus there was a beautiful garden out front that we were welcomed to eat from! The heirloom tomatoes were to die for!! Everything in the house was clean and organized. Amelia has an assistant who lives on sight that was also very helpful! Picked me up from the bus, and gave good advice on transportation and places to check out in the city. Not very far from downtown, a beautiful 20min walk or a simple bus ride. The jacuzzi was an AWESOME feature to have! Amelia even left robes ,towels, and jacuzzi sandals for us to use :) Such sweethearts! If you are a little squirmish about anything with a sexual reference, just know there are some decorative pieces around the house that depict the nude form. Which I loved personally! But may not be for everyone! The host also left us space in the dresser and in the bathroom to store our things and feel even more like home. Loved this house and would definitely stay here again! Excellent excellent value you are getting here!!! Thank you Amelia and JoJo! You made us feel at home! Thank you!"
1442973,8922540,2013-11-25,3673749,Gina,"A cute house just far enough off main streets for quiet hot rubbing, just close enough for easy access to all of Seattle!  The art inside is amazing and the house is super cozy.  "
1442973,14062456,2014-06-10,16277442,Mary Linda,"We loved it! The fresh flowers were a lovely touch. The beds and bedding were comfy. Your home was exactly what we needed it to be. We did remove the shunga-inspired art from our son's bedroom walls because they were disturbing to him; other than that, we were completely comfortable.

I would definitely recommend your home to anyone visiting Seattle!

Mary & Mark"
1442973,14786067,2014-06-26,15879747,John,It is a wonderful house to stay. We had everything we needed. Easy bus to downtown. Kitchen tools are perfect. The best is the hot tub. We enjoyed a lot. 
1442973,15647920,2014-07-13,14015999,Angie,"We really appreciated staying at Amelia's home during a time when we needed to gather as a family.  Every room was comfortable, vintage, eclectic and colorful!  The kitchen was well equipped.  During our visit to Seattle, we were met with a rare 90 degree heatwave.  Amelia was kind in checking in to see how we were doing, offering to provide tips on how to keep cool.  Her garden was filled with beautiful flowers, hummingbirds, berries and vegetables.  We enjoyed sitting on the patio with a good book while taking in the evening breeze.  Location is perfect, close to Lake Washington, and we always had a parking space.  Safety was never an issue for us.  Thank you for such a restful visit!"
1442973,16619054,2014-07-30,16776490,Lizzy,"My boyfriend and I really enjoyed staying at Amelia's wonderful home. There were many thoughtful, comfortable details in a fun artsy, kitschy space. We loved it and wished we'd stayed longer. It was super easy to get around Seattle by public transportation or by foot. We never felt unsafe and everyone we encountered was helpful and friendly. We highly recommend staying here and exploring Seattle. "
1442973,16913089,2014-08-04,229055,Julia,"Amelia's place is even more fun and beautiful than what the photos communicate! The house is immaculate and filled with fun and thoughtful touches; the hot tub and garden are great, but the toilette is something to be experienced. Amelia was also wonderfully generous with recommendations for hip things to do in Seattle. Thanks, Amelia!"
1442973,17847653,2014-08-18,4630808,Abby,"Amelia's home was the cutest, coolest, funkiest place we've ever stayed. She was easy to get ahold of, answered all of our questions, helped us figure out traffic and public transportation, and even left us fresh flowers. "
1442973,18808579,2014-09-01,18575013,Audrey,"The district was nice and close to downtown. The house was really charming and comfortable (we loved the toilets!). The garden was beautiful.

"
1442973,47991609,2015-09-22,21020371,Rebecca,"Although we did not meet Amelia, she left thorough info in her house manual. Her house is cozy and comfortable and had everything we needed. The neighborhood is within walking proximity to amenities which we appreciated. The adult decorations were tasteful and did not offend us. This house just made us feel at home. "
1442973,48801669,2015-09-28,26531150,Amy,"Nice place. Description is accurate! Just disappointed to hear that you want more $ a week after we left. Other than that, it was great!"
1442973,49164199,2015-10-01,7321935,Heather,Amelia was amazing! The house is just incredible and so comfortable and inviting. I would definitely stay here again. The place has everything you need. An artists dream for sure!

"
8409962,48664997,2015-09-27,3152653,Thomas,Stayed in this room one night and another for two. Great value and amenities!
8409962,49192734,2015-10-01,21024727,Sarah,Great stay at this airbnb!! The space was exactly as states. Very clean and organized. Loved that they actually provided breakfast food/options :) A little far from downtown Seattle but is located in a safe neighborhood.  Would stay here again. 
8409962,51797437,2015-10-24,46014944,Yaacov,Dario and his team went the extra mile to accommodate my needs. The house was comfortable and had a nice breakfast. I will likely be staying here again on future visits.
8409962,52190576,2015-10-26,10338504,Julie,"It was nice and easy for me to come and go. I met Dario's roommate Alessandro, he was very nice"

Even though I was unable to meet Dario Would he certainly has the place set up well to make guest feel welcomed. 

Thanks Dario!       "
8409962,53420661,2015-11-08,47992243,Matt,"I enjoyed my first stay in one of Dario's houses I thought I'd give this one a try too, and this house was on point! With a kitchen, living room and bathroom on each floor it is a really cool experience. Nice family neighborhood too"
8409962,53853760,2015-11-13,37224345,이,"Amazing & fantastic!
If u go to Seattle, certainly you should go to there. I'm really, really recommend to you guys. there is far from downtown about 30min. but You can approach dario's house by No.7 or No.9 bus directly. When I arrived the house, they welcomed us.:D I've been to stay 3nights with my husband. We had very! very! really!!! good time. Dario& his mom is very kind with smile always. And I think, Room is even better than you expect. Kitchen, bathroom, highspeed wifi. everything was fine!! everything is perfect!!!
Go where you may go, but I really recommend Dario's lovely house."
8409962,54549153,2015-11-21,12894190,Ronda,Darios place was exceptional.  Comfortable. Clean. Breakfast options were great to have. Plus a washer and dryer! I can recommend this Airbnb with complete confidence that your stay will be good.
8409962,55435788,2015-12-01,23421256,Shi,Everything in this house is great. The bedroom is very clean and warm. The kitchen is awesome as Dario prepared a lot of food for breakfast. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. The parking is easy. Will definitely pick the place next time.

7968548,44847583,2015-08-29,11105468,Amber,"My boyfriend and I had a great one night stay in the Fraser room at Alan's place. The room and the entire house was neat and had lots of interesting little knick-knacks that served as great conversation starters. The location was perfect-- quiet and close to popular areas in Seattle. Alan was super pleasant, easy to talk to, and eager to make our stay as comfortable as possible. I would absolutely stay at Alan's place again and would recommend it to anyone. "
7968548,45439102,2015-09-02,27580392,Kisset,This was my first time in Seattle and on the West Coast and Alan made the stay a very pleasant one. His place is nice and neat. he went above and beyond in making sure that all his guests were as comfortable as they would be if they were in their own homes. I'd definitely book with him again. 
7968548,48653774,2015-09-27,30549321,Evan,"I stayed at Phinney Ridge for 4 days and 3 nights and had an amazing experience!  This is the first time I have used Airbnb and Alan made my stay very easy.  He was very knowledgeable about the entire Seattle area and provided information about local restaurants,  places to visit and was very helpful with the local transportation/ bus routes!  The house was very clean and tidy.  We were able to have fresh towels everyday and he had a great kitchen to prepare food!  I would recommend Phinney Ridge to anyone looking to have a great time!
Thanks again,
Evan "
7968548,52378091,2015-10-28,34209174,Amanda,Alan was incredibly kind. He allowed me to stay there with only a few hours notice. He has his own life and is very flexible (very happy to let you come and go as you please). His house is VERY clean and the bed is super comfortable. I had a wonderful stay here!
7968548,54222508,2015-11-16,18230162,Gretchen,"Alan's house was attractive, quiet, clean and welcoming. It was easy to enter and leave on our own schedule and everything was clearly labeled and explain to make it easy to be self-sufficient. Alan communicated with us quickly and clearly when needed. We really enjoyed our stay in Seattle and will definitely book with Alan the next time we need a place to stay. "
7968548,55509357,2015-12-01,5306330,Sarah,"Alan met us at the door and then gave us the tour of the space. He stayed with us to answer our questions and make sure that we got settled into our room ok. Alan was very friendly and eager to make sure our stay was an enjoyable one. This house is full of 1920's charm. Hardwood floors so bring some slippers. You can actually see the lake from his back deck in the winter. Street parking was not hard to find. Everything was just as the description and pictures depicted except the floor lamp was missing. 
Pros: 
The house was easy to get to and close to the greenwood strip of shop and restaurants.
The black out curtain were fantastic for sleeping in. The room stay nice and dark. 
It was very nice to have the house all to ourselves all morning, it was so quiet. 
House was very tidy and inviting. 
Everything was very professional with the empty dresser, closet with hangers and even a safe. Fresh hotel quality towels and a bathroom stocked with all the little things one might forget. 
Really nice sleeping pillows.
Everything was clearly labeled with nice signage. There was a lovely welcome letter by the TV remotes with the instructions in case you forgot.
The room was nicely decorated with a fabric cover on the top of the dresser and night table and candles in the room.
My husband loved all the photography and spent quite some time studying the pictures.
Cons: House has 1920's charm so the walls are not well insulated for sound, the doors don't quite shut right, low water pressure, slow tub drain and the plaster could use a few touch up's.
The only lighting in the room was really bright over head track lights and candles. Nice but really could use a bedside lamp.
The bed rocks and squeaks anytime you move."
7968548,56091983,2015-12-08,50393452,Shannon,"Alan was great, met us when we arrived, and totally respected our privacy. His house is comfy and roomy! There were no guests in the second room when we stayed, and though I think this contributed to the positive experience, the setup seemed good even if both rooms are booked."
215882,694346,2011-11-05,1348021,Amy,Julie's place couldn't have been more ideal for me. I felt zen. Totally comfortable. Enjoyed a dip in her hot tub under the moon and had lovely walks around her neighborhood. Julie is an absolutely delightful soul. I think half of the books in her cottage are titles I already own. I loved browsing her collection of spiritual and poetic texts. The fireplace and complimentary tea were the icing on the cake - doesn't get more cozy than that! 
215882,722198,2011-11-15,1342140,James,My wife and I had a fabulous stay at the Garden Cottage.  We really enjoyed walking near Lake Washington and eating in Columbia City.  We can't wait to book another trip and stay with Julie.
215882,736146,2011-11-21,251388,Heather,"Julie's cottage is a beautiful, balanced space of open light and close comfort. Wonderful for a respite yet easy to re-route into downtown mode - a straight shot into the city. Thank you the warm welcome in the cold, late night, Julie! Look forward to a return some day. "
215882,771827,2011-12-08,206203,Amanda,"The private garden cottage is a lovely place in a great Seattle neighborhood, near Seward Park, Lake Washington and the delights of Columbia City.  The cottage is clean, quiet, and the hot tub was a special treat after long work days.  Julie was a wonderful host and check-in and check-out simple.  I would recommend her place and hope to stay there again."
215882,925921,2012-02-16,485037,Deanna,"Julie was fantastic. The cottage was so warm and welcoming. It was super clean, and even cozier than the photos. The fireplace was more than sufficient to heat the place and although the hot tub looked extremely inviting, I didn't get a chance to indulge - maybe next time! I will definitely stay here again."
215882,972375,2012-03-05,781468,Ross,"Julie's Private Garden Cottage is beautifully designed and appointed. Though a small space, it has a cheerful, uncluttered feel. If we had visited during warmer weather, we would have taken advantage of the patio space in Julie's lovely garden, and might even have used the hot tub which she generously offered us the use of. Julie is a thoughtful hostess. She quickly provided us with a few small items that added greatly to our comfort. We enthusiastically recommend her garden cottage to anyone looking for an attractive, tranquil place to stay in south Seattle."
215882,1005392,2012-03-17,1552491,Elizabeth,"Julie's cottage worked out great for me.  It is very light, airy, quiet and peaceful, with beautiful and simple decor.  The outdoor hot tub, set in a zen garden, was very inviting but I didn't have time to use it due to a busy week with family.  Julie provided a floor mat for an extra guest I had two nights and I understand it was comfortable.  The pilot light of the gas heater went out due to a power shortage one night but Julie came promptly to restart it.  I was there during a cold snap but the cottage held heat well and there was a back-up electric heater in addition to the gas heater so no problem.  This location is convenient to public transit.  All in all a fine experience."
215882,1067198,2012-04-01,1670490,Sylvia,"Even though it rained pretty much the entire 4 days, the property is very beautiful & peaceful.  Julie was very kind, thoughtful and helpful.  We had a wonderful stay here.  Considering I had to remain in the room for a last 48 hours of our stay (after my surgery) this was the ideal place to be stuck in!"
215882,1127445,2012-04-14,1183129,Kristen,Lovely airy and bright studio with a very comfortable bed and lovely heater that took the morning chill right out of the air.  the hot tub was very clean and comfortable.  Julie was the perfect host with many recommendations of places to visit and eat. We will definitely be back!
215882,1150055,2012-04-18,2131397,Nathaniel,"Julie was a very gracious host, and her cottage is just as appears in the photos.  I was thoroughly satisfied with the room, the bed, the kitchen area, and the atmosphere.  The only downside was the internet, which although fast in the seating area outside, became significantly slower inside the cottage.  It was certainly sufficient for email and web browsing, but Skype is difficult to use inside.  

Overall, I would recommend Julie's place to anyone looking to experience Seattle and have a nice relaxing time!"
215882,1217190,2012-05-02,1994622,Christian,Great location! Great host! Great Stay! Charming cottage with easy access to both the SEA airport and downtown seattle.
215882,1242415,2012-05-07,2215281,Leah And Brian,"Our stay here was perfect! The cottage is just as lovely as pictured, and has a light & bright feel to it. We loved using the cozy fireplace and relaxing in the hot tub. The icing on the cake was the amazingly beautiful garden...so impressive! Julie was extra sweet as a hostess, and her kitty Ursula was friendly and absolutely adorable. We would love to return if we're ever back in Seattle.

215882,1390892,2012-05-31,2341744,Michael,"Julie was a gracious host, very helpful. The cottage was very beautiful, but the location was less than desirable. I went out for a walk one night to enjoy the nice weather and was warned by the police that it was a very bad neighborhood and I shouldn't be walking around...that I was in the middle of gangland.  "
215882,1454786,2012-06-11,1292284,Stew And Nancy,Great stay with Julie and we will return often.
215882,1481247,2012-06-14,2497559,Brenna,"We stayed for three nights while visiting Seattle. The location was great- easy access to downtown, highways and the airport. The property was thoughtfully designed and landscaped nicely. Free parking was available right in front of the property. The other homes on the street were well maintained.     "

He loved having the hot tub to come back to!  We loved the cat - who seemed to be waiting in front of the door every time we opened it, waiting for a head scratch! Overall, a very good first time experience with airbnb"
215882,1614174,2012-07-02,1209417,Peony,"Julie was very nice and gave us lots suggestions for restaurants and things to do in the area, which was very helpful. The cottage was adorable, but sadly we did not have time to use the hot tub! :( But we still had a great stay! "
215882,1675818,2012-07-10,2466059,Lucas,"This is a very clean and welcoming space in a quieter part of the city. The hostess is very friendly and willing to help as needed.
Rating: Both thumbs up!"
215882,1699847,2012-07-13,2829167,Richard,"We stayed here for 3 nights. It was a very sunny and relaxing place.  The bed was comfortable.  It was very clean and fresh smelling.  The gardens were beautiful, and the hottub was a treat.  The host was friendly and offered directions to local places to dine and things to do.  Overall, it was a great experience, and I would not have traded it for a hotel."
215882,1824105,2012-07-28,3009923,Ewout,"Great and very clean cottage in Columbia City (short walk from Rainier which has lots of nice restaurants/cafes) with a friendly host, which gave us very good tips for activities and restaurants for our short stay."
215882,1889737,2012-08-05,2144507,Jessica,"My husband and I ended our honeymoon trip to the PNW with 2 nights at Julie's Zen Garden Cottage. We were greeted by Julie, who gave us directions for local transportation and restaurant recommendations in the Columbia City neighborhood. We loved the tranquil space of the cottage, which was clean, calm, and comfortable. The hot tub was an excellent way to relax after walking the hills of Seattle. We were so pleased with every aspect of our stay and Julie's affable and helpful communication throughout the process. We would love to visit again!"
215882,2110500,2012-08-27,341816,Jaime,"Julie's cottage is clean, cozy and private with lots of sunlight and a friendly cat for company. We loved waking up early, turning on the radio, grinding our own coffee and taking a dip in the hot tub each morning before exploring the town. I'd love to stay in this place again sometime in the future!"
215882,2193699,2012-09-04,2066175,Mert,"Excellent cottage. Location is great as well; close to nice restaurants, Seward Park and also both the airport and downtown Seattle.

215882,2430710,2012-09-27,396884,Tess,"Julie was very pleasant and her cottage was really cute and comfortable. If I could give her an extra star for the jacuzzi, I would =) It was so nice to relax in the jacuzzi after a long day out in the city."
215882,2497427,2012-10-03,1257671,Rob,"We have only one 'complaint' about our stay and that is having arrived, it was hard to leave! All to say, the place is lovely, the setting restful, the moon cooperating 'fully' with our hot tub experience and Julie was truly a lovely and responsive host. This is the place you want . . . "

The hot tub was the perfect way to warm up after spending the day exploring Seattle in chilly November. A tiny gas stove was enough to keep the cottage warm and cozy. The bed was comfortable, and the light and airy space was a joy to come home to. 

Julie was particularly helpful in giving structure to our spontaneous (aka unorganized) trip. She recommended a great diner a few blocks away, and even wrote up an itinerary for the rest of our trip to Point Roberts and Vancouver. 

The last day, Ursula the cat made a cameo appearance. She and Julie made us feel right at home.

I'd be back to the Garden Cottage to experience Seattle in the Spring or Summer!"
215882,3028200,2012-12-04,3301616,Calvin,"We were very comfortable in Julie's guest cottage. The weather was mostly blustery west coast winter rain but the gas fireplace kept the cottage cozy and the hot tub was great after a run along Lake Washington. Julie was a welcoming host and  gave us a list of local places to eat and activities in Seattle. We enjoyed exploring Columbia City. We would like to return to Julie's cottage in warmer weather so we could enjoy her beautiful garden, morning coffee on the cottage porch looks like it would be heaven. "
215882,3477255,2013-02-04,3731928,Monica,"We had a great time at Julie's. I loved the proximity to Columbia City as it's one of my favorite Seattle spots and close to good friends. Staying with Julie allowed us the autonomy to do our own thing but visit who and what we wanted without all the small talk. I enjoyed the hot tub! 

"
215882,4216973,2013-04-19,4996897,Darcy,My Granddaugher and I loved our stay at Julie's Garden Cottage.  It was homey and bright and provided for our every need.  Having such a quiet retreat after our busy days in bustling Seattle was just what was needed to make the visit perfect.
215882,4341597,2013-04-29,3404314,Cindy,"My husband and I enjoyed our comfortable stay at Julie's garden cottage while visiting our son and daughter-in-law in Columbia City. The cottage is in a great, wonderfully diverse neighborhood, and is lovely, inside and out. Every object in the cottage reflects Julie's discerning aesthetic and desire to create an enjoyable experience—from the twinkle lights to the bamboo flooring to the prints on the wall. And the garden is delightful—I enjoyed sitting on the deck in the mornings, smelling the lilacs. Julie is thoughtful and interesting. I enjoyed talking with her about her work and gardening."
215882,4484296,2013-05-07,6110692,Stephen,"The cottage is great, and Julie is very accommodating. Would recommend over a hotel. The only slightly inconvenient thing is the location, but Seattle's public transportation is reasonable that this isn't really an issue if you have some patience (this place is close to the light rail)."
215882,4604882,2013-05-14,1495055,John,Julie's place is very relaxing and she is a great host. The hot tub is great after a day exploring Seattle - it was the perfect retreat for a quick weekend away.
215882,4692311,2013-05-20,6327080,Wanda,When my husband and I pulled up we were a little concerned we might not get the privacy we are accustomed too.  We were pleasantly surprised that even though the cottage was in Julie's backyard we completely felt we were alone.  The cottage is so charming and the hot tub was an excellent addition.  We would definitely recommend Julie and even stay again if we are in the area. 
215882,4972075,2013-06-04,6470952,Jake,"What a GREAT cottage! The garden was very relaxing and it was just far enough away from Downtown Seattle. It felt like we could really get away from the crowded streets.  The bed was comfy and the ceiling fan really helped, it was pretty warm for early June.

Next time we might even get into the hot tub :( 

The trip was for my wife's birthday and she loved it!"
215882,5025932,2013-06-08,49597,Joel,"We enjoyed staying in Julie's cottage. It was very clean and simple. Easy to feel comfortable and relaxed in. It was very quiet at night. Great area, close to Seward Park. "
215882,5346984,2013-06-25,1098239,Dave,"Julie's cottage is really nice and I had a relaxing time, chilling out in the sun and hot-tub!

She's very attentive to any questions you might have."
215882,5387926,2013-06-27,6906387,Sara,"This place is lovely!! The cozy studio has many windows including skylights, smells great and had great energy. We had just come from staying in a place 4x the size, but loved this one so much more. Not to mention you have access to a hot tub! Julie was great and so helpful. 

It is somewhat of a distance from city center, so you need to be ok with that. The result though, is that you get to escape the city intensity and stay in a space that doubles as a yoga studio."
215882,5509550,2013-07-03,6406882,Nita,"My mother and I stayed in the garden cottage for five days while i was in town looking for apartments. It was so nice to come back every evening to a homey place! The cottage gets a lot of light and the garden area is beautiful. Julie made sure we were comfortable the whole time, giving us tips on places to check-out and even putting in an air conditioner when we got very un-Seattle temperatures of 90 degrees. The cottage is in a great location, as it is an easy walk up to the main restaurants in Columbia City and to the light rail (we returned out rental car early because it was so easy to get around on the light rail) which is 20 minutes to both downtown and the airport. Additionally, if you like to run- or take a nice walk, it is also very close to Lake Washington, which is beautiful. I definitely recommend staying here to have a comfortable visit while you are in Seattle!"
215882,5600688,2013-07-08,6059064,Margaret,We were very happy with our stay at the Garden Cottage.  It's an adorable place with everything you could need!  
215882,5700397,2013-07-12,115019,Nicole,"I cannot recommend Julie's cottage enough. It was the perfect space for the two of us and Julie was an amazing host. She was attentive yet allowed us private use of her beautiful back yard. We considered kidnapping her to come landscape our home! It is a zen retreat in the middle of a bustling city and is perfect for a couple or single person. I don't know how well it would work for families but I did see she had extra bedding gear available.  Tips and tricks: if you're like us and are used to a dark bedroom you might want to consider an eye mask. The window shades here are light and there are also great skylights but it all makes for bright mornings! :) Second tip it took us a minute to figure out: the best way to get some cool air in at night is to crank open the windows and clip the shade up a bit. Works so much better than the fan on the window unit (and you don't need air at night in Seattle with the cool temps).  Again, all the positive reviews are for real; Julie's has created such a unique space and we recommend it completely. "
215882,6152446,2013-08-01,2356053,Linda,"My husband and I very much enjoyed our stay at Julie's Garden Cottage for three days this July. The place is just as described, only better and more beautiful. The hot tub was heaven.  The cottage itself couldn't have been cleaner or more attractive, and the garden -- gardens, really -- were a delight. This ""relaxing garden cottage with hot tub"" has our highest recommendation."
215882,6269860,2013-08-06,5484297,Rachel,"My college roommate got married in a community center just 5 blocks away from this cottage, so the location was perfect.  We never needed a car since the light rail was able to get us from the airport to the cottage and to the International District, Pioneer Square and Pike Place Market in no time.  I recommend getting an Orca card before arriving for easy public transportation.  We soaked in the hot tub, used the mini fridge and coffee maker and lounged in the serene garden space on a daily basis.  Staying in the cottage really made me feel like I had a 'home' during our Seattle visit.  Julie was quick to respond to my questions before our visit and was able to accommodate our request for two keys for the cottage with only a days notice.  Thank you for sharing your space, Julie.  "
215882,6372703,2013-08-10,110355,Michael,"We had a wonderful stay at Julie's place.  Although we didn't get the chance to try out the hot tub, we really enjoyed relaxing in the chairs outside.  Her backyard is very well landscaped, and was wonderful to retreat back to after our days exploring Seattle.  Her place is a short walk to the light rail station, and an even shorter walk to some great restaurants on Rainier Avenue.  Julie was a great host! "
215882,6420963,2013-08-12,1099014,Seamus,"Amazingly calm, relaxing retreat. Julie couldn't have been more accommodating. "
215882,6512703,2013-08-15,206203,Amanda,"Julie's Relaxing  Garden Cottage is indeed very relaxing with a pleasant space and wonderful garden to enjoy. Julie is friendly and easy to deal with and her space is clean and comfortable. The cottage is located within walking distance of Columbia City, a great neighborhood to visit while in Seattle, and also close to Lake Washington and all it has to offer. I highly recommend the Relaxing Garden Cottage."
215882,6598314,2013-08-18,2632347,Ashley,"This cottage is very private, and comes with a bonus kitty cat! The inside is clean, comfortable, and has details that make your stay that much better - dvds, books, tea, etc. I would highly recommend this place, especially if you have a car to get around Seattle (we did not try public transportation, but I hear it works well too). The park nearby was great for a morning jog as well."
215882,6663727,2013-08-20,7536188,Doris,"Wonderful community! Great local places to eat such as Geraldine's and Both Ways. Lot's to do within walking distance. The cottage is light and peaceful, Julie is an excellent hostess."
215882,6807039,2013-08-26,1437482,Michelle,"Julie was such a great hostess! She even offered to pick us up from the light rail since we arrived late at night! The cottage was beautiful, clean, and in a great location for nearby activities as well as access to downtown. We only wish we could've stayed longer!"
215882,6900768,2013-08-29,3978620,Ina,"Derek and I made our way from Portland to backcountry (email hidden) Helens and Mt Rainier to Seattle. Instead of sleeping on an air mattress at a friend's studio apartment in Ballard, we opted to book two nights at Julie's cottage.

The cottage was a lovely space; bright and airy, small but not cramped. Both nights we quickly fell to sleep on the super comfortable mattress. In the mornings, we opened the French doors to the patio and adjoining garden to enjoy the cool summer morning. I would have loved to have seen the garden in full summer bloom!

Central Link, the light rail system, was a great way to get downtown. It was a bit of an uphill hike to get to the station but we didn't find it strenuous, just worth noting.

We spent most of our time exploring and enjoying the city so we didn't see Julie much but she was very friendly and responsive to emails and text messages about our trip plans. Her garden cottage provided us with some inspiration for the small house that we'll be building in the coming year."
215882,6942944,2013-08-31,5468088,Lara,"What a lovely home and great location! Julie was extremely hospitable. The little apartment is separate from the house, and we had the backyard space all to ourselves when we wanted, including the hot tub... but we also really enjoyed bumping into her and having a chat. I can't say enough about what she's done with the garden and how relaxing and homey it was. Also just a few blocks from the thriving Columbia City neighborhood with good food, funky shops, and even a VERY convenient light rail station to downtown. The drive isn't that bad either if you're used to Seattle or city driving. I would definitely stay again and highly recommend Julie's place for its charm, privacy, and warmth. It made me want to move to Columbia City!"
215882,7223273,2013-09-11,8071054,Ryan,Great relaxing space. The hot tub at the end of the day was fantastic. A little bit out of downtown but the little local Main Street had some great restaurants. Would definitely stay here again especially if we just wanted to relax and see the parks and neighborhoods close by. Julie is a great host.
215882,7311540,2013-09-15,3011936,Dave,"Really enjoyed our stay at Julie's cottage. Secluded and super comfortable bed - also Julie was really helpful with nearby food choices and spot-on. We ate well! all in all, thoroughly recommended"
215882,7398394,2013-09-18,376449,Elise,"We stayed here right after our wedding - it was a little piece of heaven. Very quiet, clean, smells great, and great hot tub. We would walk to breakfast just 10 min away. We got some much needed R&R. "
215882,7529702,2013-09-23,8739426,Wade,"Lorrie and I enjoyed our weekend retreat at Julie's cottage. It was everything we hoped for. Julie was a gracious hostess although we spent most of our time in the city so we didn't have much of an opportunity to visit with her and her kitty Ursula.  

The accommodations including the hot tub were great. The bed was very comfortable and although I prefer a darker room to sleep in, I was able to get two great nights of sleep.

The cottage was very clean and peaceful.

I especially appreciated the Keurig coffee maker and complimentary coffee in the morning.

At Julie's suggestion, we had dinner at Tutta Bella's and breakfast at Both Ways Cafe.  Both were small and friendly with lots of character and good food."
215882,7603813,2013-09-26,8292661,Kate,"Julie's space was beautiful! Clean, bright, comfy, and exactly what we were looking for. Julie was welcome and friendly but also gave us space to ourselves. We enjoyed the hot tub, access to the well-stocked kitchen area, and comfy bed. The amount of natural light in the space was delightful and you can see how much she paid attention to each detail in making it a comfortable space to stay. Highly recommend staying here!"
215882,7705983,2013-09-30,3029863,Jocelyn,"We LOVED the garden cottage and had an absolutely fantastic time! Julie welcomed us warmly, offered totally on-point advice when we asked (including directing us to the Columbia City Bakery about a 3 minute drive away which BLEW OUR MINDS with deliciousness), and gave us our own space when we wanted it. The cottage was a perfect, bright, warm, cozy hideaway with easy access to all the awesomeness Seattle has to offer. We'd definitely stay there again! "
215882,7887598,2013-10-07,241820,Tegan,"This was an exquisite experience. Julie's cottage is full of light, very clean and well represented by the photographs. I slept peacefully and naturally enjoyed my stay in Seattle. If you want to treat yourself to a special gift, book in here. "
215882,7986920,2013-10-11,3258434,Robert,"We stayed with Julie for 4 nights.She was easy to communicate with, even leaving a key out for us when she couldn't be there when we came in.She was full of information about Seattle. The location is good with many nearby restaurants. The light rail is a reasonable walk, and that made the city very convenient. 
    The room is comfortable and clean. There were plenty of towels and extra blankets. I was expecting a bit more of a kitchen-there is only a microwave for heating food. The only other thing missing is closet space. We pretty much had to live out of our suitcase because of the small size of the rack for hanging clothes.
   The hot tub was nice to come back to after a day of walking and exploring. It was always ready for us. The room and garden yard are very private, which was nice, although the window and door coverings are really thin."
215882,8030482,2013-10-13,9059218,Elizabeth,"This cottage was a clean and cozy gem.  All of the small touches like tea maker, hair dryer in the bathroom, and clean soft sheets made it feel like home.  We would definitely stay here again.  "
215882,8114498,2013-10-16,8578746,Shay,"This was the first time we have ever used AirBnb and were not sure what to expect.

There are definaltly some pro's and con's to staying here. 
Pro's- It is a beautiful setting! Juie has done up the backyard beautifully! 
- The neighborhood was charming and we felt safe walking around at night.
- The hottub was amazing! So relaxing after a long day of shopping.
- Some really good restaurants within walking distance (10 blocks)
-Julie was nice and made sure you had you privacy.

Con's
-The location is quite a distance from downtown and if you have plans to be doing alot of things downtown or at stadium you are looking at a $25 cab ride or a 5 block walk to the the train.
- The bed was terrible! A futon on a metal frame, the pillows are older than I am and the bedding was terrible! Old and scratchy!
-The bathroom was ok, but so tiny it was hard to get ready . 

We would not stay here agin as it just wasnt convenient for us."
215882,8156221,2013-10-18,3212589,Stephanie,"We had a wonderful, peaceful stay the last 2 days of vacation. The space was relaxing and the hot tub was heaven!  It was the perfect place to finish our vacation time.  Julie was friendly, gracious and provided all we needed to be comfortable.  I loved the choice of lighting-- every ambiance of mood was available.  The space was clean, quite, and felt very private. Thanks Julie!  We hope to share your space again sometime; hopefully more than just two days!"
215882,8234257,2013-10-21,2225592,Jp,"We had a wonderful 2-night stay at Julie's Garden Cottage. Would definitely stay here again!

Super convenient location just a 5 minute walk to the center of Columbia City. The cottage was tastefully decorated and I loved the ambience both inside and out in the garden. "
215882,8372248,2013-10-28,5023593,Ryan,"We enjoyed the heck out of our stay at Julie's wonderful cottage. She was attentive on our arrival, even though we arrived quite late. She showed us the ropes of the place and got us all set up for our stay. We didn't see her the rest of the weekend, as we were mostly gallivanting about Seattle.

The neighborhood is pretty awesome and we ate a coupla' meals in Columbia City and loved it. A great, diverse, comfortable, friendly vibe. We also did a huge walk along Lake Washington on Saturday morning - maybe the highlight of our trip.

For starters the cottage is SO clean. Coming from a bit of a clean freak, this is always such a delight. Wifi worked great. Bathroom was tight but very clean and good water pressure. A very quiet night's sleep.

The train to downtown Seattle is a little bit of a hike, but totally doable, and once you're on it..zip..you're there.

We loved our stay..we'll be back!

-Ryan"
215882,8646237,2013-11-10,9744393,Adam,"Really beautiful quarters, and such a gracious host! She was really great to work with, and helped us out with everything we needed. Highly recommended! :)"
215882,8693218,2013-11-12,8926175,Micki,"We spent two lovely nights in Julie's cottage. It's super charming, a short walk up a paved path lined with twinkling lights and opens into spacious courtyard complete with a hot tub (which we were very grateful for after training 6 hours a day). The cottage itself is clean, bright and we'll appointed and Julie is sweet and responsive.  If I end up returning to Seattle, I'll definitely be staying here again :)"
215882,8821982,2013-11-19,3954875,Rod,Beautiful little cottage meticulously set up-- I was very pleased
215882,8910108,2013-11-25,2397934,Sam,"We had a very enjoyable stay! Comfortable cottage, relaxing hot tub, walking distance to Columbia City. A bit further to the light rail to Downtown, but very manageable. Highly recommended!"
215882,9067285,2013-12-04,6855505,Carlene,"This was our first Seattle vacation, but definetly not our last!  Julie's cottage is precious. It is light, airy, open and peaceful. It is nicely appointed and comfortable.  We really enjoyed our stay there. 

Room darkening option would have been perfect, but that is the only non provided amenity.  There is no television and for most people that would be a non issue. However, it is football season and my husband is addicted. Fortunately there is a friendly, cozy, tasty sports bar just around the corner,,,perfect!"
215882,9425961,2013-12-28,10022710,Jan,"The cottage is very nice and cozy, and the view of the garden is lovely. Liked watching the birds outside while have morning coffee. The only disappointment was not getting to use the hot tub due to maintenance issues."
215882,9505945,2013-12-31,2617826,Andréa,"Julie was an incredibly gracious host.  Her cottage is cozy and comfortable, and the hot tub is an added bonus.  Make sure you check out the Columbia City area, which is just a short walk away.  Julie had fantastic recommendations for food and entertainment, particularly Geraldine's.  She was easy to communicate with, and we enjoyed talking with her.  Her cat is sweet, too.  Highly recommended! "
215882,9738973,2014-01-07,1316401,Tony,"Julie was a fantastic hostess! She met us at our car and was superbly nice and attentive. She made recommendations of what to see and do and her home was very welcoming. Make a point to jump in the outdoor hottub each night and stare at the stars. A major perk of this lovely home
"
215882,10352187,2014-02-15,11588640,Mike,"Julie's relaxing garden cottage is a true hidden gem! Upon arrival Julie was a very accommodating host telling us all about her charming Columbia City, which is the quaint town with some excellent restaurants and shops nearby. The cottage itself is very cozy, clean and nicely decorated and is the perfect size for a traveling couple. The bed was VERY comfortable and the electric fireplace heater kept us warm at night. Julie let us use the jacuzzi every night and was even sweet enough to turn it on upon request when we were out to let it warm up. She was easy to communicate with and I'd give her an A+ for all her help and generosity.  
Great proximity: It was a very convenient 15 minute drive from the airport and only 10 minute walk to the nearest light rail public transit that takes you right into downtown Seattle. Also it was only a short walk to downtown Columbia City. The location was just far enough outside Seattle to not be located in the hussle and bussle of the city, but still only about a 20 minute drive/light rail ride into Seattle. I would highly recommended this location based on our amazing stay! Must Go!"
215882,10394890,2014-02-17,9038056,Kay,"My partner and I had a lovely time staying at the Garden Cottage! The space is calm, clean, and smells nice. We really enjoyed soaking in the hot tub and snoozing in the comfy bed. Two thumbs up!"
215882,10547405,2014-02-24,3571714,Amy,"Super cute place!  We really enjoyed staying here. The hot tub on a chilly rainy night was perfect. Julie was so nice and went over everything we needed when we got there.  The lite rail is just a short walk (10 mins) away, used it to go downtown.  Would definitely stay here again!"
215882,10707152,2014-03-03,7387949,Steve & Melody,"Steve and I had a great time here. The cottage is cute and warm with a comfy bed and an AWESOME HOT TUB! The landscaping in the backyard and the abundant natural light inside the cottage were added bonuses too. Great location because of the cute community, close restaurants, parks and walk on Lake Washington. Thanks you Julie! "
215882,11065451,2014-03-18,220278,Jessica,Julie's cottage was a pleasure to stay at. Everything was very clean and relaxing. There are several windows in the small space so everything feels very fresh and airy. The hot tub was also definately welcomed! 
215882,11360893,2014-03-31,12335436,Jennifer,"Julie's cottage is a very comfortable place to relax, especially during a rainy Seattle weekend. Great light and very quiet. Quant neighborhood with lots of restaurants and places to walk. Julie is a wonderful host.  "
215882,11560193,2014-04-07,9052081,Christian,Julie is a gracious host and the garden cottage is absolutely amazing!  I would highly recommend it to anyone.
215882,11732103,2014-04-13,3016630,Antoinette,"Julie's place was absolutely perfect for what I needed! I messaged Julie last minute and she was immediately responsive to let me know her availability. The hot tub was on when I got in and it was, on the whole, an incredibly relaxing experience. She also gave us tips for our adventure that day and it was spot on advice. Couldn't have asked for more!"
215882,11906035,2014-04-18,876260,Dane,Lovely spot. Welcoming and cozy. Julie is a top notch host. 
215882,12301815,2014-04-28,14056229,Erin,"What a gorgeous place!  Julie was a wonderful host, very responsive and eager to provide recommendations for local restaurants and public transportation.  We really lucked out with the beautiful cottage, backyard garden, and hot tub!"
215882,12666985,2014-05-07,5569097,Ali,"Lovely little cottage!! Had such a relaxing and refreshing stay, with the hot tub, the garden, (the rain!), and the fresh, clean feel of the inside. Julie was a great host -- communicative and nonintrusive -- and I'd recommend the cottage, for sure. The little center up the street had some great restaurant and it was a fun area to explore. It's a private spot, great for one or two people. 

One thing -- It's super bright inside of the cottage in the mornings because of the skylights, windows, etc., so if you're hoping to sleep in late, this isn't the place. Otherwise, it's probably the place :)"
215882,12716646,2014-05-09,13195692,Shawna,"My husband and I visited Seattle for the time, and this was our second experience using Airbnb. We stayed with friends for a few days during the first part of our trip, visited Portland by train for a couple days and then spent our last two nights in Seattle. Julie's garden cottage was the perfect place to unwind and relax before going back home. Julie was very friendly and communicative the whole time and extremely knowledgeable and helpful in offering advice on public transportation and recommendations on dining. The cottage is very airy, cozy and beautiful. It has amazing light and lovely French doors, and I loved waking up to natural light streaming in during the morning hours. The bed is very comfortable, and the hot tub is a nice bonus! Columbia City is a charming little neighborhood with plenty of restaurant options. Access to the light rail is about a 10 minute walk away, and the #7 bus stop to downtown is a quick couple blocks away through a park. Beautiful cottage and a great neighborhood! Thank you, Julie, for your gracious hospitality."
215882,12783751,2014-05-11,13615414,George,This is a fantastic place!  It is beautifully designed and appointed.  It's also a very cozy place to be on a rainy day.  It had everything I wanted and I highly recommend it.
215882,13186436,2014-05-21,14279664,Heather,"My friend and I had a lovely stay in Julie's cottage. It was our first visit to Seattle, and we found Julie to be very welcoming and helpful. The cottage was clean and bright, and the hot tub was a wonderful way to relax after a day out on the town. We enjoyed the Columbia City district, which is within walking distance of Julie's cottage, and has some super cute restaurants, and some great live music. Overall, we had a great time in Seattle, and I would stay with Julie again in a heartbeat.  "
215882,13431227,2014-05-27,11774083,Jeffrey,Julie was wonderful.  Her place is very nice.  Beautiful garden.  The cottage was perfect for our romantic getaway.  Wonderful location.  Just a really good choice all the way around.
215882,13578829,2014-05-31,13791723,Richard,Julie has a great place in an interesting part of Seattle.  Julie knows quite a bit about the history and makeup of the neighborhood.  Her garden cottage is well set up and is a great and convenient place from which you can explore and discover.  I'd like to stay there again.
215882,13734168,2014-06-03,1470170,Gretta And Bill,"Such a lovely sanctuary with a helpful and generous hostess! We watched goldfinches flit in the birdbath and garden with Buddha peering through the leaves. We used the hot tub on sunny days and starry nights. The cute town with good restaurants (Geraldine's - great for breakfast!) was an easy walk and there was lots of convenient public transportation to different points in the city. There was a long city park a block away and Seward Park with its redwoods and water a short bus ride away.
The cottage was small but light-filled and pretty. We were writing in the mornings so spent quite a bit of time there."
215882,14397136,2014-06-18,14950425,Caitlin,"I am so glad I picked Julie's cottage for my trip, my first experience with Airbnb and first visit to Seattle. The space was so lovely--luxurious and yet back-to-basics at the same time. The bed was delicious, and the shower was plenty hot and tall. It was wonderful to come back to the hot tub after long days of gallivanting, and to wake up with light from the skylights and birds chirping in the garden. You can really tell how much care she's taken in creating the space; it's incredibly relaxing. 

I'm not sure it's pictured, but she has a Keurig in the kitchen, which meant I didn't have to hunt down caffeine each morning in a pre-coffee state (which I, and I'm sure the baristas nearby, appreciated). There's a toaster, microwave, electric kettle, and mini-fridge as well. The audio player was awesome--I plugged my iPod in and heard my favorite album in more detail than ever before. 

I rented a car for part of my trip to do a little more widespread-exploring, and I walked and took the Link to and from downtown the rest of the time, which was very easy. Julie is a public transit expert. Ask her about the Gandhi walk! 

Julie was very accommodating when I arrived late at night, and gave me a ride to the Link when I left. As a first-time young solo-traveler, I really appreciated that she checked in on me from time to time, and let me know that if I had an emergency I could call her. After I took a day to drive around Mount Rainier (I hugely recommend this if you have the time), she even called to make sure I hadn't had any trouble and had gotten back okay. 

It was way too easy to fall in love with Seattle and the Northwest from her place, and I'm already planning my next visit.  "
215882,14680003,2014-06-24,12937768,Amy,"The Garden Cottage was great! My sister and I were able to leave our luggage there after an early flight in, and Julie was wonderful. The property is 1/2 block from a park and about 10 blocks from the light rail. There are great little townie restaurants only about 5 blocks away. We were in town for the Seattle Marathon, and it was wonderful to have a place to stretch out after the event. We walked the 1+mile to Seward Park with a picnic and books and it was well worth the walk! Thank you, Julie!"
215882,14834375,2014-06-27,505871,Brandon,The cottage is absolutely perfect! The backyard is perfectly manicured and the hot tub is wonderful after a long day of walking around. We would certainly stay again.
215882,15002550,2014-06-30,17012640,Trey,"Julie was such a warm and gracious host. Everything in the cottage was clean and it was nicely appointed. Julie was able to inform us of places to visit, eating spots, and the best ways to get around the area. Such a knowledgeable and pleasant person.

The single cup Keuring machine and the yogurts and fruits Julie left for us was a pleasant surprise for breakfast!

I cant say more about our experience and visit to Seattle. We will most definitely be staying here again on our next trip to the gloom Northwest. 

Thanks again Julie!"
215882,15380275,2014-07-07,6991125,Jaminah,"My stay couldn't have been more wonderful! Julie was so pleasant & down to earth. She really knew the ins and outs of Colombia city. It was a Staycation for me being a new mom and the hot tub, quiet atmosphere, walking up to the beautiful birds and we'll kept garden was exactly what I needed to work on music, relax, and pamper myself. I will for site be back! Julie was even so nice to invite me to a 4th of July party with her and some friends!  I had other plans arranged but she truly made me feel welcome. She also has a very nice and eclectic book and movie collection. I started reading 3 cups of tea on my down time and truly enjoyed it. Upon my arrival Julie had some breakfast snacks in the refrigerator that I enjoyed and offered me some fresh veggies from her garden. I can't say enough great things about my stay at the cottage! Julie has truly been thoughtful about all of the hard work she has put into the cottage to make it the most relaxing & unassuming getaway! I would go back any day vs. Getting an overrated hotel. Not to mention is located in the PERFECT spot in Seattle. I'll be keeping in touch as I'm local to pierce County, any time I need a little getaway! "
215882,15542951,2014-07-11,4727390,Heather,"This wonderful retreat was just what we needed after the stress of looking for a house.  The place is exactly as advertised.  Julie was super helpful and a wonderful host.  We liked it so much we are moving to the neighborhood!  If you're around on Wednesdays, check out the Farmer's Market.  We also liked the restaurants and the ease of taking the light rail to downtown."
215882,15819610,2014-07-16,414768,Lin,"Julie's place will stay on my list of great experiences for years to come. Every element of her space is considered; you'll feel like you're in a spa or sanctuary. Also, public transportation makes getting to great sites and activities a breeze. However, the neighborhood is cool enough and close enough for great eats, all with a good variety for tastes and budget. Julie made every aspect of getting there, from approval to check-in, easy as well.  Best treat: watching hummingbirds feed when we opened the French doors that open out to the Zen patio and garden. "
215882,15989211,2014-07-19,14945580,Roberto,"This is a very nice little cottage, ideal for one person or a couple. It is well located, close enough to touristy areas by public transport, but far enough to be quiet. Julie was a great host, always ready to give suggestions; interaction with her was moderately high. "
215882,16898966,2014-08-04,16265673,Saldiam,The experience was perfect! We could not have asked for a better location and house. The cottage itself has everything that we needed and more. Its a very efficient use of space and has even inspired me with my future living space plans. The cottage is exactly as described with plenty of privacy! The neighborhood seemed really nice as well! All the houses had their own flavor and style. We were walking distance from the seafair which was the biggest plus! An Uber fare to Seattle was super reasonable and took little to no time at all! It was as if I lived there!
215882,18059082,2014-08-21,3123851,Judith,"Julie was out of town but she had a friend meet me and make me welcome.  I thoroughly enjoyed my week's stay in this relaxing, quiet environment.  I was visiting my granddaughter and we were able to walk to the playground.  I agree with a previous reviewer that you do need a sleep mask because the cottage has skylights and lots of windows."
215882,18397495,2014-08-26,14515453,Julie,"The cottage was just as described, clean, light, airy, very convenient to family and wedding we were attending. Julie was friendly, accessible, a great host, providing us with lots of information."
215882,18789319,2014-09-01,16113346,Marshall,"Hands-down, this beat out any hotel I've stayed in as of late. The cottage Julie has set up is quiet, secluded, and is amazingly well furnished (it also gave me an idea or two to try when I renovate my house).

Julie herself was incredibly friendly, very open to offering information on local places to visit, and was flexible regarding the time-window allotted (I showed up a little early, due to my flight schedule, and she let me drop off my stuff). Adding on to this, she went out of town while I was staying, and she was still reachable via text-messaging throughout this period.

Definitely the best place to stay in the area, I'd say. I'll be putting her cottage at the top of my list for my future visits to Seattle!"
215882,19303587,2014-09-09,5121083,Stefan,Julie was very helpful and the garden cottage is a beautiful and relaxing place to stay. Recommended!
215882,19525519,2014-09-14,17122434,Richard,"A spotlessly clean, sunny, open-plan cottage set in a meditative Japanese style garden. The cottage is lovely and situated in the great neighbourhood of Columbia City, with easy access both to the downtown and the airport on the nearby light rail. Communication with Julie worked like clockwork. Julie was a pleasure to deal with. We would definitely stay here again."
215882,19738964,2014-09-17,1507702,Kyle,"Julie was great! She greeted us with some fresh fruit and coffee, and helped us figure out how to get around town. The room was tiny but charming and fit our needs well. You must eat at Columbia City Bakery or Geraldine's down the street!"
215882,20090655,2014-09-23,19065361,Susan,"Henry and I had an amazing time. We love the cottage, felt right at home. The area was very quiet and peaceful. It was close from the airport as well as down town Seattle. We are looking forward to our next visit and will look to book this location again.  "
215882,20754947,2014-10-05,10489654,Bill,"Julie was a great hostess (although she wasn't there much, which was fine with us).   It is a wonderful place to stay in a great part of Seattle.  My wife and I kept commenting on how glad we were that I discovered this place!"
215882,21048058,2014-10-10,408489,Lance,"What a wonderful bungalow Julie has set up for her guests. 
It was more than perfect for me as I could come and go without having to go through her home. 
So clean and nothing left undone and all the amenities you need and then some. Wonderful neighborhood with park just across the street. Julie was helpful as she gave me all the locations I had asked for and the area space around the bungalow was so private and quiet. I will be staying with Julie next time in Seattle. "
215882,21167925,2014-10-12,21888080,Anayeli,"Julie's garden cottage was exactly as the pictures described! It was clean and cute. The jacuzzi was a big plus! Amazing after a tiring day! Julie was a very gracious host. She gave us recommendations on places and transportation, which was very much appreciated. The location was perfect! Just a short walk from the light rail which was amazing! Would definitely stay again!"
215882,21341545,2014-10-15,9206850,Patti,We LOVED everything about staying in Julie's guest studio. It was just as she said it would be and even more. Julie was always available and her help in navigating the sights of Seattle was spot on!
215882,21545984,2014-10-19,22159902,Garson,Julie was very welcoming and the cottage was beautiful. It was as if the home sprang up organically from her beautiful garden. This was my first time using airbnb and Julie showed us how awesome it can be. Thank you. 
215882,21879581,2014-10-26,20953034,Natalie,"This cottage is every bit as inviting, rejuvenating and peaceful as the pictures make it out to be - not to mention, the garden surrounding the property is beautiful! The neighborhood itself offers plenty of opportunities to experience life as a local and when you're ready to leave the cottage access to Downtown Seattle and the sights is easy and comfortable to navigate. 
Julie was a wealth of suggestions and they all lived up to the reviews.  She was so gracious and welcoming and has thought of every detail to make the cottage an exceptional get-away."
215882,22529070,2014-11-09,16546619,Alexandra,Julie was a wonderful host! We loved being able to come and go with no hassle. The landscaping on the property is so beautiful. She's really created such a comforting environment.The jacuzzi was so great to come home to after a long day of exploring. The covered patio is great for sipping coffee in the mornings. I can't say enough how perfect this location is. 10 minute drive to pikes market/space needle. 15 min drive to the airport. The downtown Columbia city district was so cute. AMAZING sushi restaurant ( wabi sabi ). Columbia city bakery was delicious as well ! Julie was always available if we needed anything at all or had any questions. I'd highly recommend this cottage for your stay in Seattle ! 
215882,23106079,2014-11-23,22763387,Nicole,"This is an adorable serene private cottage and the hot tub was a perfect addition to an amazing weekend! Julie is super sweet and made sure we had everything we needed. I was in Seattle for a concert and this was hands down a better choice than any hotel! Is very homey an extremely clean and well lit and I loved that there are white Christmas lights neatly hung near the ceiling, they were a great addition! Absolutely loved it."
215882,23647167,2014-12-07,18815203,Donald,"Julie, was AWESOME!  She accommodated our very late arrival and was very friendly during our entire stay.  The Cottage is very cute. It sits behind her residence. The Cottage includes a wonderfully comfortable bed, a nicely designed bathroom, skylights throughout, a kitchen sink and counters. There was a microwave and refrigerator in the room, and a Keureg Coffee maker. The room was decorated well. The hot tub was a wonderful addition and was very private! "
215882,23931942,2014-12-14,11421671,Erin,"Very nice stay. Cute cottage with beautiful landscaping and hottub as described. The hot tub alone made it for us. It is about a 15 minute walk to the lightrail and then another 15 minute or so ride into downtown as described... so not bad at all, but not REALLY central, if that's what you're after (it is much more relaxing than downtown though). The area around the house is cute, too - we did end up staying in the neighborhood for one of our nights. Julie was a charming host and she's done a great job with this property."
215882,24490112,2014-12-29,24500053,Maria,"We didn't get a chance to meet Julie since we were staying over Christmas and she was (reasonably) away with family. Despite that, she did a great job of communicating with us and told us that she was available if needed and set us up with the contact information for her house sitter. This space was really, really pleasant. We LOVED the hot tub at night- perfect for relaxing after walking around the city and we did A LOT of walking. We liked that the place was in a quiet neighborhood but that we could easily access the city. The light rail was a short walk away and it was so easy and cheap from there to get to downtown. We didn't rent a car and were fine. There is a Safeway and a liquor store about a 15 minute walk from the cottage if you want to get some groceries. I would say if you don't plan on renting a car then you should plan on walking quite a bit. The bed really is so comfortable. We didn't really explore the neighborhood a lot because we went in the city everyday but it seemed like there were restaurants within walking distance from there. Overall a great stay at the garden cottage."
215882,24682170,2015-01-01,322217,Joe,"Julie was great all along the process - from initial engagement through check-out, she was available and attentive, but also gave us our space to make the place our own. Can't complain about anything except the price, but Seattle is an expensive market overall and this didn't seem to far out of line with the rest of the options on AirBnB."
215882,25164637,2015-01-08,9759440,Kelly,"My boyfriend Calisto and I stayed in the cottage for a couple of days to celebrate both of our birthdays and anniversary in Seattle. Julie was very warm and welcoming. And we were wowed by the cottage that is an oasis amidst the fog. It was nice to stay in a neighborhood that we may not have seen if we stayed in a conventional hotel downtown. Everyone in Columbia City was extremely welcoming. We especially liked the wine tasting and jazz at The Royal Room as well as the all day breakfast spot, Geraldine's Counter (for us late risers). When we wanted to venture to the city, either the number 7 bus or link brought us there in no time. Overall it was a lovely stay. Thanks, Julie!"
215882,25749473,2015-01-25,4351118,Richard,"Lovely cottage beautifully maintained. Compact. Quiet. Peaceful. Near good restaurants, Empire Espresso, Columbia City Bakery and the link rail station. Easy to downtown and the airport. Excellent neighborhood. Julie's the perfect host. What's not to like?

Highly recommended. 
"
215882,25857005,2015-01-27,871682,Marina,It was a clean beautiful bright quiet place to relax and unwind. Julie was very kind and gave me all the privacy I needed. 
215882,26563883,2015-02-15,26646656,Alexandria,"What a great experience. I asked my girlfriend to marry me at the edge of the bed. It was the perfect setting.

The place was so clean and smelled amazing! It was exactly what we were looking for. I can definitely see why she would use this space as a yoga studio. 

In LOVE! I will be coming back for sure!"
215882,26951486,2015-02-22,13615414,George,"I am a return guest at Julie's cottage and plan to return again. It is bright, cozy and extremely clean, with all the amenities one could need. I highly recommend it. "
215882,27567111,2015-03-07,24868049,Jamie,"The amount of care and attention Julie put into building her garden cottage is apparent the minute you walk through the gate. Such a bright, warm, and comforting place to rest. Beyond the general aesthetic of the studio, Julie herself was an incredible host. She took extra care to introduce me to the city and, on my first night there, went out to dinner with me. It was an absolute treat to stay with Julie, couldn't recommend it more, really."
215882,27703793,2015-03-09,5864377,Alesia,"We loved our stay at the cottage. It was clean, private and comfortable. So bright and lovely. Great location. Julie was great at communicating, she made us feel right at home and gave us great recommendations for places to eat. Hot tub was wonderful after a day of exploring the city. We will definitely be back. "
215882,27862559,2015-03-13,1098980,Zachary,"My wife and I were looking to stay in a relaxed spot in an up-and-coming neighborhood and we hit the jackpot with Julie's cottage. Very clean, quiet, with peaceful vibes and a fantastic garden with several visiting bird species and a lovely view up the hill at night whilst sitting in the hot tub. Everything you need in the little kitchen, and a cute little porch overlooking the garden for breakfast! Walking distance to all the local-owned restaurants and pubs. Also walking distance to a lakeside trail and the old-growth forest in Seward Park which is perfect for a nice walk, hike, bird-watching, nature center. It's a quick drive right into downtown Seattle. Columbia City is a diverse and buzzing little community and Julie's cottage couldn't be in a better spot. We will definitely stay here again. "
215882,28228558,2015-03-20,14793612,Katie,"Julie's space was a little oasis! It was just as described and the backyard was so peaceful, the perfect setting for a hot tub. Julie was a pleasure and offered wonderful suggestions for food around the city. It is a magical space I would love to stay in again."
215882,28365952,2015-03-22,21620826,Catherine,Julie's cottage was simply wonderful! Everything was clean and lovely. Thank you for a wonderful stay in Columbia City. 
215882,28807814,2015-03-30,2585892,Alex,"I lived in Columbia City for 15 years until moving to Atlanta 2 years ago. Staying at the cottage felt like the sweetest, most comfortable and perfectly located little nest to welcome me back. Julie is a lovely and accommodating host. I didn't get to spend very much time with her with all of my running around, but she is the kind of person you would want to grab coffee with and hang out with at Columbia City Bakery (don't miss it!) Her kind-heartedness is reflected in the space she provides and I'm pretty sure she knows that she is offering a great deal. She could easily change more for the accommodations she is providing given the location and space. 

If you aren't familiar with the neighborhood, Columbia City is exactly where you want to stay in Seattle. It is one of the jewels of Seattle--a cute neighborhood with a lot of local flavor, great restaurants, great coffee, fun shops, and easy access via the bus and Lightrail that is within walking distance. You can take an easy walk to Lake Washington for views of the water and Mt. Rainier, or you can take a walk in the other direction and be in the midst of a fun urban neighborhood. It is also close in to the downtown area, but feels like a peaceful get-away in a quiet neighborhood. 

I plan to come home to Seattle fairly often and the cottage will be my first choice when I return. Thanks Julie! You made my first trip home so comfortable.
"
215882,29317443,2015-04-06,13587736,Josh,"Julie and her space were both fantastic. She went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. She warmed up the hot tub when she knew we were heading back, offered an extra key, and was very responsive whenever we had a question. Thanks, Julie!"
215882,29760795,2015-04-12,28770571,Alyssa,"Julie's cottage is exactly as advertised--full of warmth and character, comfortable and quiet, and very, very Zen. Julie herself is a fantastic host; she made sure to say hello and chat with us about her favorite things to do in the city. The cottage is well located, and extremely walkable. The exceedingly charming main drag of Columbia City is a short 5 minute walk away, and there you can enjoy great food (Island Soul and Geraldine's Counter are must tries), fantastic art and even live music. Further, the light rail which goes right into Downtown Seattle is a quick 10 minute walk, and even better, it connects to Seattle-Tacoma airport. Our favorite thing was the quiet of the neighborhood. It was great to come home to after long days exploring bustling neighborhoods like Capitol Hill and Fremont. The next time we're in the area, we'll check Julie's house for availability first. We recommend you do the same. 
"
215882,30572938,2015-04-24,30739175,Charles,"We recently spent two nights at Julie's cottage. It was fantastic, and exactly as advertised -- actually, probably even better. It was very clean, had everything we could have needed, and was very close to public transportation stops. Julie greeted us when we arrived, showed us around, and provided some dining recommendations which were also spot-on. It is also very close to many restaurants and little shops in Columbia City, as well. Couldn't have asked for a better stay. Would definitely recommend to others, and hope to utilize this space again on future trips to Seattle! "
215882,31128869,2015-05-02,26588819,Andrea,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Julie's cottage. It was a nice little private place close to many Seattle hot spots. I definitely recommend staying at the cottage. Communicating with Julie was also easy, and she was very responsive."
215882,31488306,2015-05-05,32084228,Kent,"Julie was an incredible host. First time airbnb and I'm hooked! The place was exactly what we wanted... friendly, helpful host, private, and in a great location! If you're looking for a relaxing and comfortable location in seattle, this is it!"
215882,31702128,2015-05-09,27708615,Annie,"I really enjoyed Julie cottage. It was very beautiful, peaceful and she was very warm and welcoming. Julie did everything to make sure we settle into the place. Her garden cottage is perfect for a vacation due to it location and proximity to downtown. Also if you are a early morning jogger, there are great parks around where you can go jog. I will highly recommend Julie place for a stay in Seattle and will definitely be coming back!!! "
215882,31964730,2015-05-12,31427894,Robin,"Julie's place was absolutely perfect. A little adorable place in her beautiful garden with everything we needed to be comfortable during our stay. It was clean, and private. The location was perfect, within walking distance of all kinds of things. Julie was a great host. I highly recommend this for two people exploring Seattle. "
215882,32246044,2015-05-16,1858422,Abby,"Julie's abode is truly lovely. The accommodations are very comfortable and relaxing. Julie keeps the space immaculately clean and the layout is well thought-out. There is even a small porch area where one can sit and enjoy the garden area (read: pretty wonderful). As well, we fell in love with the Columbia City area surrounding the cottage. There is no shortage of fun places to eat, shop, and stroll. Would highly recommend!"
215882,32879933,2015-05-23,14950425,Caitlin,"This was my second time staying at Julie's Cottage.  As before, it was cute and comfortable.  The location is great for enjoying the tranquility of Seward Park or walking to the light rail for a quick trip into the downtown.  Julie is a wonderful host and offered excellent suggestions of areas to visit, places to see, and current performances or events to attend.  The cottage was comfortable and clean, and offered a calm place to relax in her garden and hot tub.  Overall, a very positive experience."
215882,33636801,2015-05-30,33077285,Jared,Excellent host. Beautiful place. Accessible and accommodating. Hope to return soon!
215882,34244087,2015-06-06,12866745,Travis,"Absolutely amazing! We had such a wonderful time in the cottage! It was cute, clean and had the most beautiful garden to enjoy! We will highly recommend to others and hopefully get to stay again ourselves! Julie was such a sweetheart and so helpful! "
215882,34534911,2015-06-09,30992663,Laura,"The Garden Cottage was excellent! Great location (easy walk to shops/restaurants in Columbia City), comfy bed, and Julie was friendly and accommodating. It was a wonderful experience."
215882,34710910,2015-06-11,5522715,Summer,"Julie is very friendly and accommodating! She's always willing to help you with anything and also giving an introduction to the neighborhood. Her cottage is just gorgeous and cosy!! My sister and I enjoyed our stay a lot. The cottage is in Columbia City where you'll be able to try some great tasting local food (Empire Espresso and Salted Sea are highly recommended). Also, you can easily get to Seattle downtown from Columbia City by taking 7 bus. Julie's cottage is highly recommended and for sure that we'll be back! :)"
215882,35074133,2015-06-15,29402781,Jan,"This was only our second Airbnb experience, and we are hooked! Julie was a great host – available if we needed her, but gave us complete privacy, too. She responded very quickly if we needed directions or info. Her place is so peaceful, clean, and airy. We loved having the french doors open to the garden and listening to/watching the birds. It was hot when we visited, and appreciated that we could have used the A/C if we wanted, but it was enough to open up the doors for air flow. We also didn't need to use the hot tub or little fireplace heater, but could see that it would be very cozy in inclement weather. We had a very full, long weekend of family reunions, graduation, and other events to attend, and it was so nice to come back to our little oasis at the end of a busy day. It was pretty easy to zoom into downtown Seattle (and elsewhere) from there, and the Columbia City neighborhood is delightful! We had breakfast one morning at Geraldine's Counter (excellent, crowded, and very popular), but picked up croissants and coffee to go at Columbia City Bakery for the days when we had to be somewhere. Have to say, those were the BEST croissants this side of Paris. We'll be dreaming of those... Had a great dinner at La Medusa (Italian/Sicilian). The arancini starter was fabulous... pastas were really good, and garlicky (!). Also loved dinner at Salted Sea - don't miss that one. They have a great oyster selection and the crab cakes were out of this world. Fast forward to the most amazing banana wet-cake with caramel dessert ever. Ever. My husband wanted chocolate mousse, so we ordered that and the banana dish (normally we'd share one), and ended up practically fighting over the banana. He was ready to do a face plant into the dish... Anyway, great stay, fun neighborhood, lovely accommodations – we can't wait to come back!"
215882,35403083,2015-06-18,29890770,David,"Julie's place is wonderful!  We felt right at home the moment we arrived, and Julie was a kind, understanding and accommodating host.    Having the hot tub available was a huge treat for us, and I wouldn't hesitate recommending Julie's Garden Cottage to anyone!"
215882,36062202,2015-06-24,4048274,Jessica,Cottage was super cute! We enjoyed our brief stay. We did not get to meet Julie while we were there but she was easily reached by airbnb message. Would definitely stay here again!
215882,36655041,2015-06-30,17126350,Carlton,My wife and I were in Seattle for work. We turned it into a vacation and stayed at Julie's garden cottage. The accommodations were excellent and we enjoyed relaxing in the hot tub in the cool evenings. Julie was a wonderful host and has a wealth of knowledge of the area. Definitely would stay there again. 
215882,36970162,2015-07-03,33395113,Anna,"Julie's garden cottage was wonderful for our stay. It's very easy to get to from the airport and we really enjoyed wandering around Columbia City. Julie was friendly and helpful, even installing a larger AC unit in the cottage during the very unusual Seattle heatwave to make our stay more comfortable."
215882,37741047,2015-07-10,31506215,Colleen,Julie's little cottage was perfect for our two nights in Seattle! The hot tub was so relaxing after a day touring the city. Julie was so gracious and had lots of great tips for us!
215882,37986112,2015-07-12,1355156,Lori,A lovely little getaway space.  Came for a Seattle weekend adventure and though this is away from downtown and a bit off the beaten path we had no problem getting where we wanted to go by using public transit or uber.  In fact it was nice at the end of the day to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city and have a quiet space to go to relax.  Will without doubt stay again on future trips to Seattle.
215882,38371154,2015-07-15,28739616,Hyunjun,I had a good experience in this cottage for my honeymoon! It is enoough to feel the common house style in U.S. We hope to visit again someday!
215882,39372794,2015-07-23,30236025,Ali,"Absolutely loved staying here! The cottage was bright and airy. The location was close to several bus stops and the train station, which made getting around via public transportation super easy. It was really nice coming home and relaxing in the hot tub after exploring the city all day."
215882,39734476,2015-07-26,29421251,Mandy,"Great experience! Easy booking, Fabius host and lovely, private stay. Thank you Julie for helping us have a great trip."
215882,40892732,2015-08-03,27222747,Caleb,"The Garden Cottage is comfortable for people who simply desire to relax and spend lots of time exploring Seattle. It is only a few minutes walk away from a street full of restaurants, and a 15 minute drive from the downtown area and several other fun neighborhoods worth visiting. The cottage is clean, with a refrigerator, wifi, and great air conditioning. The bed is comfortable, and the deck is a perfect spot to relax. The week we stayed there was a festival in town, and Julie ensured that we had a saved parking spot and even free passes to the festival. We loved our stay! "
215882,41355743,2015-08-07,24353061,Diego,"The cottage is great, has everything you need and julie was helpful even though she was out of town. We had no problems communicating with her. The hot tub was perfect after a long day in the city center. It was clean and as you would excprect it. Columbia city is a great neighborhood easy to reach from the airport and the city. I defenetly woud go there again!"
215882,42116745,2015-08-11,31611744,Lois,"Such a great place! looks just like the pictures! Julie was such a sweet host, and had such an elegant little place for us to stay. We are grateful for the opportunity to stay in a relaxed neighborhood rather than a hotel!"
215882,42587902,2015-08-14,12296362,Whitni,"Our stay with Julie was wonderful!  We were elated to have air conditioning at this property, due to the unseasonable heat wave.  The Garden Cottage has so much wonderful natural light, with windows and skylights everywhere.  We had the most restful nights and were able to relax for half of a day when we were exhausted after hiking.  The location of the Garden Cottage is perfect for those who want to explore Seattle, without having to stay in the downtown area.  Columbia City was also wonderful to explore, with a lot of great restaurants, parks, and stores nearby.   We felt very welcome here and Julie did a wonderful job providing suggestions of what to see/do and where to dine.    Also, Hot tub!  Who wouldn't be happy to use a hot tub after a long day of hiking... perfect for my aching muscles or just to relax!    Lastly, Julie's yard is amazing!!  You can tell she has put a lot of heart into her landscaping and it was much appreciated.  "
215882,43034192,2015-08-17,6130193,Ryan,"Julie was an excellent host and her garden cottage was in a great location within walking distance to Lake Washington, a grocery store and a street with shops/restaurants.  The Light Rail train stop is nearby and easy to get to downtown Seattle.  The garden was beautiful and the hot tub was great to relax in."
215882,43662959,2015-08-21,28220936,Miriam,"Our stay was an excellent experience, Julie was warm and inviting. The cottage was cozy and well appointed with amazing sun light pouring in. and a few blocks away from the light rail station. Columbia City has a great bakery called Columbia City Bakery off of Rainier Street walking distance from the cottage. We would definitely want to stay at her cottage when we visit Seattle again. Thank you Julie hope to see you again in the near future."
215882,45065376,2015-08-31,16113346,Marshall,"Great host & location! Stayed at the cottage two years in a row now, no regrets!"
215882,45505882,2015-09-03,12926988,Joann,"We really enjoyed our time at the cottage! It was close to downtown, reasonably priced, and very quiet and peaceful. The wind chimes were especially lovely and we enjoyed a quick dip in the hot tub after a long day walking around. The town the cottage is in is also very neat to explore! Thank you for a great stay.  "
215882,45802747,2015-09-06,39291497,Nick,"Julie and her garden cottage were absolutely amazing. The cottage was wonderfully decorated with lots of natural light and extremely clean. Julie was available through phone with anything that you needed and was extremely flexible and accommodating. 

The cottage was within walking distance of the Light Rail station and close to a few parks and was in a nice and quiet neighborhood."
215882,46284525,2015-09-09,21610417,Jennifer,We had a great time staying at Julie's! The cottage was cozy and the hot tub was an added bonus! She gave us some great ideas for things to do in Seattle!
215882,47028891,2015-09-15,29293373,Jo,Julie made me feel very welcome as soon as I arrived.  She was full of info and readily available if I had any questions. 
215882,47692932,2015-09-21,40147040,Amy,"Thank you, Julie for a wonderful stay at your cottage. The cottage is very peaceful, light and relaxing - everything you'd want while on vacation. The hot tub was also great to relax in after a long day of walking around Seattle. I'd definitely stay at this cottage again! "
215882,48291383,2015-09-25,41203720,Allyson,"We had a fantastic time staying at Julie's cottage! She was very helpful and had great recommendations of places to go and eat. Within walking distance of some cute shops, restaurants, parks and the light rail which can take you into downtown Seattle. I would definitely recommend staying here and would love to again in the future!"
215882,48891426,2015-09-29,22578511,Sandra,"Julie was a wonderful hostess! The adorable cottage was cozy and had everything we needed. The hot tub was very relaxing and a wonderful way to end our day.

Julie was so thoughtful and uber helpful. She alerted us of traffic the morning on our departure. :)

The location is also wonderful! So close to Rainier shops and restaurants. We'll definitely be staying at the cottage should we visit Seattle again!

Thank you Julie!"
215882,49219941,2015-10-02,26621132,Jason,We really enjoyed our stay in Seattle and Julie's cottage was perfect — very close to every place we wanted to visit but far enough away that we could get some quiet R&R. Loved coming back to the cottage after hiking or exploring the city. Thanks Julie!
215882,50451078,2015-10-12,23755825,Julianne,"Julie's Garden Cottage was great.  It's located in a nice, quiet neighborhood, and it's a short drive downtown.  We enjoyed our stay.  Julie was pleasant and quick to respond to questions.  "
215882,52780490,2015-11-01,33733750,Fuming,nice host  .had a good time 
215882,53118247,2015-11-05,189030,Adron,"Excellent stay, loved the place. Didn't get to spend anytime in the hot tub, but will definitely see if Julie's place is available again on a future stay. "
215882,53596187,2015-11-10,32719882,Andrew,"Julie was fantastic, easy to get ahold of and very respectful. The cottage was absolutely adorable and was everything I expected and more. I took my partner who I proposed to on this trip and had a blast in the city. This location makes getting anywhere in the Seattle metro area a breeze and the atmosphere Julie set up is perfect for a cute romantic get away. The weather was not the best but we did mange to get a little hot tub time in the rain which was a lot of fun. Also want to note, my partner and I are pretty big guys, both 6'4 and around 280lbs, and this place was super comfortable. Overall I highly recommend this listing and plan on booking again come the time. "
215882,54361237,2015-11-18,17564283,Adam,Julie was a great communicator and friendly host.  The property is exactly as described.  She made sure I found my way and that I had everything I needed for the duration of my stay.  Nothing but positive things to say... 
215882,56369139,2015-12-13,6746316,Kati,"Julie’s cottage is a nice, clean, peaceful, well-appointed place to stay.  At first we thought it would be small, but it is so well thought out that it fit us perfectly.  It was bright and airy, even on a weekend that lived up to Seattle’s reputation for rainy weather.  It’s well built and cozy on chilly nights, and the hot tub is only a few steps outside the door.  The neighborhood has some funky, fun restaurants and a small-town feel, even though it’s only a short drive from downtown.  We really enjoyed our time at Julie’s place, and would not hesitate to recommend it to couples traveling to the area.  "

1750010,14481659,2014-06-20,16108172,Tomas,We have enjoyed our stay at Seattle.  The host was gracious.  The accommodation exceeded expectations.  We have no hesitation to recommend this host and her property.
1750010,15689345,2014-07-14,16220696,Daphne,"Grace, the host was very accommodating and helpful and made sure we were comfortable. The house was very spacious and clean. It was everything that was expected.  Convenient location and nice neighborhood.  Highly recommended!"
1750010,16096353,2014-07-22,7637339,J.J.,"Grace was a great host and very responsive! She made check-in and check-out very easy. 

The house was spacious and a very comfortable place to spend the week. Thanks so much!"
1750010,16613776,2014-07-30,134904,Jan Roelof,"The house is very spacious and new, great for a large group to stay in.  The host has been very helpful and flexible, thanks Grace.  The house is located OK, close to Greenlake and U-district, with public transport options to town.

The house can use additional decoration and household items though, pictures on the wall, utilities like a coffee maker and other kitches utensils, bed side tables/lamps, music equipment, etc."
1750010,24795447,2015-01-02,25239802,Nick,"The host, Grace, is a lovely lady and has taken great care of such a large house! The king bed was amazing and the master bath is really quite a sight. I do have a couple of complaints among the new paint and carpet though:

1. This house appears to be in the middle of a remodel. Many of the drawers in the kitchen are near inoperable as they are built to close together. The main burner on the gas range was also inoperable and we had to cook with the smaller gas burners. Also, all of the smoke detectors were dead and required new 9 Volt batteries, to prevent them from beeping all night long, which we happily replaced.

2. There was a lot of broken furniture in this house. We had a desk lose a leg that was already broken and the kitchen table was only held together by a single bolt that was certainly not the original part. We felt unsafe keeping anything on the tabletop as it was made of glass and extremely unstable.

3. The reservation also indicates that there is ""Ultra-Fast High Speed Wireless Internet,"" which was left in the Comcast Xfinity bag in front of the fire place along with the cable box. We had to drive home in order to bring our cable box to watch NYE at Times Square and were not given any instructions after contacting the host for the WiFi password (which did not exist).

4. This house, at the time of reservation (NYE 2014) and as of (01/05/15), claims to host 4 bedrooms. This is a false statement as there are only 3 bedrooms with a fourth mattress placed in the master bedroom. There is a basement but it is currently being rented which brings me to my last point.

5. There is a man living in the basement! The best part is that this was not listed on the reservation description when I made contact with Grace and is still not on the information panel as of (01/05/15). This news was very upsetting and should be required on the information of this (website hidden);DR This house has a lot of potential but was certainly not worth the money we paid as there were some discrepancies between what is advertised and what the conditions are really like... "
1750010,34878239,2015-06-13,32001982,Anran,Th neighborhood is nice and quiet and the house is clean. Overall it's a enjoyable stay
1750010,39258262,2015-07-21,15809141,Thomas (Andy),The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1750010,39266180,2015-07-22,28724701,Patrick,"The location was great and Grace was very flexible about the key pickup. The house is spacious and airy. The facilities (baths/showers, toilets, dishwasher, washing machine, gas hob, oven and microwave, dryer and fridge) are all new and in good order.

We had a couple of minor issues that Grace resolved quickly.

The garden needed some love - it would have been nice to find a kept-up lawn and BBQ facilities given the hot weather."
1750010,39709747,2015-07-25,27676915,Camille,"Grace was wonderful.  Very hospitable, easy to communicate with and really helped us out in a pinch. I would 100% recommend her! Thank you grace"
1750010,42949811,2015-08-16,15856077,Saimon,"Big spacious house with ample parking.  The place is minimally furnished, but has what matters most...beds.  The neighborhood is great and the host was very responsive to our questions.  If you are looking for a place to sleep, while exploring the north end of Seattle, this has you covered.  If you are looking for a place to really get comfortable in, that feels homey, this may not be right for you."
1750010,43981200,2015-08-23,9844268,Jennifer,"Well, this outside picture of the house is much nicer than it really is. No maintenance is performed on the outside whatsoever. The landscaping is in disarray. The railings to the stairs are falling apart and rotting. This was a big safety issue for one of our party. Also, there are no written instructions about garbage removal, etc. There is a tiny garbage can outside plus other bins that other stuff goes in. It was confusing. We were there for a week(party of 6) and it did become somewhat of an issue. The kitchen looks like a remodel not done very well. Some of the kitchen drawers are very hard to open because cabinets don't fit well in the space. There is a gas pipe that goes to the stove sticking out from under the cabinet of the island. Unattractive and possibly a safety hazard. The kitchen sink leaks and this was extremely inconvenient as we had to put towels underneath the sink to keep water from getting onto the floor. We couldn't find an actual drip. So I don't know what's going on with that. The bedrooms were nice but the toilet seat in the Jack and Jill bathroom slides around and needs replaced. No problems with the upstairs bedroom. Also, there is a living room couch with a pull out bed but there is a heavy marble coffee table that has to be moved in order to use it. Not a great setup or bed actually. We ended up not using the bed after pulling it out and seeing the condition it was in. Finally, written instructions on connecting to the wireless would have been nice. Things like which network it is, the password etc.  We aren't all tech savvy. We did eventually figure it out. So all in all just ok and overpriced for what you get. We were especially disappointed that there is no usable outside space. The summer is so nice and we really missed just being able to sit outside. "
1190224,7213054,2013-09-10,8656736,Domenic,Andy was a really nice host and he introduced me very well to Seattle! All time I felt very comfortebal and it was a great time I spend there!! 
1190224,7591251,2013-09-25,6904235,Jw,"I made this reservation on behalf of my girlfriend, who had business at The Center for Pediatric Dentistry, and she had a very positive experience at Andy's place. He was very easy to work with and very helpful and friendly. I would highly recommend Andy and his house to anyone looking for a place to stay in Northeast Seattle, and especially for anyone who needs to go to the Center for Pediatric Dentistry, since it is only a short bus ride away."
1190224,7686726,2013-09-29,1996611,Bo,"the room is clean and the bed is comfy. Andy is very friendly and helpful. Thanks, Andy."
1190224,14663338,2014-06-23,4024102,Wee Meng,Great host and friendly. Everything is perfect and I have a great and comfortable bed to ensure a good rest.
1190224,16145143,2014-07-22,6439972,Adam,Andy's place was just what I needed. I biked to work on the Burke-Gilman trail that was right next to his house. Andy was easy to get a hold of and was responsive. He even mailed me my key when I forgot it at his place when I left.
1190224,17118013,2014-08-07,12578389,Dominique,Andy is very accomadating. I loved the fresh eggs and access to Mathew's beach on Lake Washington. Good economy and easy to go to and from.  Would stay again.
1190224,17420918,2014-08-11,19658908,Caitlin,I came looking for a quiet place for one night and got exactly that.  Andy is very helpful if you have any questions and accommodating when need be. His reply time is also impressive and I would recommend staying here if you're in the area!
1190224,17783330,2014-08-17,18952829,Connie,Andy is a very helpful host whom anyone would like to meet with.   He kindly offered everything I needed and gave me privacy if I wanted to have.  Bed is comfortable.  I felt very lucky to taste organic eggs that were produced by Andy's own chickens.  Yummy and amazing!  I had a very pleasant stay in Andy's home for nearly a week and would recommend it to my younger friends if they would travel in that area.
1190224,19653933,2014-09-15,3192103,Nik,As advertised.   Thanks for helping out last minute!

1190224,36642047,2015-06-29,36833656,Wayne,Andy is the nicest host you can find in Seattle! He can do almost everything to fit your request! I would love to stay at his place next time when I'm in town!
1190224,42574131,2015-08-14,37503621,Louis,"Great room ! I was there for a week and it all went fine !
The bike trail, the bus stop and the lake are really close, it's really convenient !"
1190224,51283796,2015-10-19,36298614,Kevin,The listing description was accurate. Andy was generous. He fed me dumplings. He let me use the kitchen since I was there longer term. The neighborhood had easy bus access to the hospital and to the Burke Gilman trail. A nice quiet place to live.
1112092,4439629,2013-05-05,4288875,Christine,"Wonderful time staying in the cottage and Anne and Peter were the perfect hosts!  Anne contacted me prior to the trip to ask if we had any special requests, and then checked in while we were there to make sure we had everything we needed (which we did). 

The cottage is lovely and immaculately clean! It is bright and open and very quiet. This was a combo work/play trip for me so it was a great place to get work done-- there is a little office area with wireless that worked perfectly for me. There are 2 options for sleeping: a pull out couch in the living area, and a loft upstairs. We chose to sleep in the loft and were very comfortable. There is a ladder that you climb to get up to it... Anne told us about it in advance and it was actually no problem to navigate and get up & down. We thought it was fun. But if anyone has any problems with weight bearing, or vertigo and doesn't want to climb the ladder to the loft, you can sleep in the living area on the pull-out. (Anne was kind enough to ask us our preference prior to the trip.) 

My two favorite things about the cottage: 1) Stepping on to beautiful WARM tile floors in the bathroom (I didnt see a heater so I still have no idea how they were heated but it was so NICE-- especially in the morning!) and 2) Hand made avocado soap from Florence, Italy... Lovely! (And it smelled good too.) 

We will def come back!

1112092,4947650,2013-06-03,6282533,Ellen,"Stayed in Annie's cottage for three nights on a mother-daughter trip to Seattle.  Annie was very easy to communicate with, and was available for any questions we had.  The cottage is a wonderful space...very relaxing and a lovely spot to return to after a day exploring Seattle.  Quiet, safe neighborhood with a bus stop in front of the house.  We loved our stay here, and would definitely contact Annie again next time we are traveling through Seattle!"
1112092,6147588,2013-08-01,6137930,Susan,"I stayed in Annie and Peter's guest cottage for the month of July, 2013. The location is an upscale, yet down home neighborhood. It is safe, quiet and so many locations are easy to access, downtown, Discovery Park, and just the neighborhood itself has great restaurants, boutique stores. The cottage is newly built, clean, with modern amenities, bright and airy with a comfortable feeling provided by looking out the windows at tree tops, and I was provided everything that I needed, great cookware, dishes, towels, personal choices of art on the walls, etc. A few highlights were the heated bathroom floors and a gas burning stove that would be great in cooler months in the livingroom. It is beautifully decorated, painted calm warm hues, wood and ceramic/stone tile  floors. The loft has wall to wall carpeting. Open the windows and the gentle cool breezes blow through in the summer. Peter and Annie were gracious and knowledgeable hosts. They know both about the arts and great places to hike. I had my privacy, but always felt that they welcomed any question I might have. I knew as soon as I stepped into the cottage that it would feel like home.  I am a working artist and teacher and I was surprised how enjoyable my upcoming school tasks became, wifi helped to get in touch with school and the quiet of the space allowed me to easily get in touch with my creativity. Finally, a month of nights of sound sleep left me refreshed to start new projects. One of my best vacations, ever. Many thanks to you both."
1112092,6655276,2013-08-20,6514968,Silvia,"What a great cottage:))! This has been our first experience with Airbnb and we are truly enthusiastic about it. Everything had been work out perfectly. The house is even  nicer and bigger then it looks like at the pictures.
 The kitchen is great equipped, you definetely will find everything to cook your own dinner. The cottage was equipped with fresh soap, shampoo, conditioner, towels, hairdryer and even all the basic spices and some tea.
Annie always answer the emails right away and she really tries to make your stay as comfortable as possible. She even  asked us ahead of time if she should buy some groceries for our fridge for our arrival. 
The surrounding of upper Queen Anne is absolutely georgous. It is nice to walk around and you will have some great views of the bay up there. The busline for downtown is leaving just in front of Annies house and you may choose between two lines. If you got a car you can park safely direct in front of the cottage. 
In the cottage you will find a lot of information about Seattle (as well as the schedule of the buslines and ferries) and of course of the nice surrounding like Mt. Rainier and so on. If you got further questions about some trips Annie will gladly help you. 
Annie does have one dog and two cats but they are not allowed to come into the cottage, in case you are allergic. 
On the other hand Annie and her family always respect your privacy and do not come into your cottage unless you like it.
We have had a wonderful time in this cottage and like to say thank you again to Annie and Peter for bereinig such great hosts. We hope we can arrange to come back again."
1112092,6720734,2013-08-22,6950601,Stephanie,"Annie and her Queen Anne cottage are great.  She was prompt with her responses and was easy to contact for check-in directions, etc. The cottage is very well equipped (love the French press for morning coffee), clean and comfortable. We hope to come back."
1112092,7006232,2013-09-03,6018030,Brent,"We very much enjoyed our stay in Annie's cottage. It was perfectly situated in Queen Anne, within easy walking distance to the great restaurants, cafes, and bakeries in the neighborhood, yet still quiet and peaceful. For runners, it is just off the Crown Loop run, which takes you past the difference vistas in Queen Anne—including a close approximation of the view from ""Frasier's"" condo! 

Annie made check-in easy, and the cottage was clean and prepared for our arrival. Our stay was more than comfortable, and we always felt like we had the place to relax and unwind at the end of the day. Annie kept herself available in case we ran into any problems, which we didn't. We would love to stay here again. "
1112092,7138229,2013-09-08,7722942,Robbin,"The cottage was just as represented and very comfortable.  The location is very convenient to public transportation and is in one of the nicest neighborhoods in Seattle.  Walk a few steps and you'll see views of the bay and multi million dollar mansions.  There is a Trader Joe's very close as well as an Italian restaurant, coffee shop and ice cream store.  We walked to all of these.  What else does one need??  Nearby there are other nice restaurants and shops to which you can drive in 5 minutes or less.  There is a parking place for your car if you have one but it seemed street parking would have been easily available as well.   If you are fairly active you can walk to the city and waterfront, but would likely want to take the bus or a cab (around 10.00 each way) back up the very steep hill to get home.  The cottage was clean and Annie was responsive and quick to address concerns and questions.  I will definitely book this cottage again if I find myself back in Seattle."
1112092,7217210,2013-09-11,6865443,Kathy,"After traveling for a week in hotels, it was wonderful to have more space and a kitchen!  The accommodations were wonderful.  Communication with Annie superb!  The Queen Ann area is a great location to enjoy all what Seattle has to offer!"
1112092,7240827,2013-09-13,6248598,Barbara,Annie's cottage was a lovely place for us to explore Seattle from. It is very conveniently located providing easy access to the city.  It was very clean and beautifully presented with a fully equipped kitchen.  Annie and her family were very friendly and made sure we were comfortable upon our arrival.
1112092,8539912,2013-11-04,3831451,Rachel,"Annie's little cottage was wonderful- clean and bright, and perfect for a weekend stay. Queen Anne has wonderful shops and restaurants, and the bus stops right in front of her place! I highly recommend staying here."
1112092,9643499,2014-01-04,659897,Marianne,"We had a very enjoyable and relaxing stay in this lovely cottage in one of Seattle's most beautiful and central neighbourhoods.  The cottage is beautifully built and decorated with a well-appointed kitchen.  The neighbourhood is full of charm and character, with great cafes and restaurants within very easy walking distance! Seattle icons Molly Moon (ice-cream) and Top Pot (hand-made doughnuts) are nearby on Galer street, not to be missed. 

Easy access by car to Seattle Centre and downtown.  We also enjoyed the access to Discovery Park (great ocean views).  

Annie was a great host - very thoughtful and made sure that we had everything we needed.  We didn't get a chance to meet her, but communication was very good by email and text. 

We definitely recommend her cottage for a stay in Seattle."
1112092,10192710,2014-02-05,9681939,Mimi,"This was a terrific place to stay. It was clean, warm, bright, and a
great neighborhood. Thanks Annie!"
1112092,10418320,2014-02-18,10419779,Lindsay,"We just returned from our long weekend in Seattle, and we are so pleased. Annie's backyard cottage was the perfect quiet getaway we had been craving. The accommodations were lovely and so much bigger than we had expected. We love'd the heated bathroom floors and the loft bedroom. The location was ideal for us since we prefer to walk if we can. The only thing that was even slightly wrong was that the internet wasn't working, but that didn't make much of a difference to us. We'd come back in a heartbeat. "
1112092,10684064,2014-03-03,107894,Elisabeth,"My best friend and I stayed in the backyard cottage while visiting Seattle for a conference, and it was the perfect choice! We never met Annie and her husband in person, but they were kind and welcoming in correspondence, and very responsive to questions. The cottage's location can't be beat -- a quiet, residential street within easy walking distance of wonderful restaurants, shops, and cafes. The bus that stops just outside the front door will take you downtown in 20 minutes (although we were lucky enough to have a beautiful, sunny day, and gave ourselves an hour to take a leisurely walk down the hill. Recommended!) The cottage itself is perfectly appointed, with everything you need to enjoy your stay. Our only regret was that we hadn't booked an extra day to just lounge around the cottage and enjoy its many amenities! I would stay here again in a heartbeat, and recommend it to anyone looking for a home away from home on their next trip to Seattle."
1112092,14115357,2014-06-12,2592592,Lisa,"Annie's backyard cottage was delightful. We really enjoyed our stay there. The cottage is spacious and has everything you need. You can also relax in the lovely garden if the weather permits. Queen Anne neighbourhood is just a couple of blocks away and Seattle Centre plus Downtown is easily accessible on foot or by bus.
As our train wasn't leaving until the evening, Annie let us stay in the cottage until late afternoon which was appreciated."
1112092,17089088,2014-08-07,250425,Andy,Perfect in every way. 
1112092,22609400,2014-11-10,9271485,Carol,"This was the perfect charming location for our trip.  We enjoyed the space and it became our home away from home.  Having the use of a kitchen is always a plus when traveling, and this one had everything you could ever imagine.  Thank you for opening up the ""Outback"" as it was perfect for us in every way.  Location, space, comfort - all "" on point"".  "
1112092,26548544,2015-02-15,26661604,Celia,"The cottage was lovely.  Clean, tidy and very comfortable.  Queen Anne is very central and everything is in walking distance.  The restaurants, cafes, supermarkets and stores.  Its an easy walk to Kerry Park and The Space Needle.  It's lovely to start the day with a coffee from Cafe Fiore and walk to Kerry Park to take in the view.  Queen Anne is a very special place.  "
1112092,28563858,2015-03-26,16919354,Sarah,"Annie was warm, welcoming and very helpful! The cottage is beautiful- recently built, open, airy and well-appointed.  Annie gave us recommendations for places to shop and eat in the Queen Anne neighborhood, and made sure that the cottage was comfortable."
1112092,34300365,2015-06-07,11878123,Emily,"Annie was really helpful and the cottage was perfect for our needs.  It is situated near the heart of upper Queen Anne with access to coffee shops, bakeries and beautiful walks through the neighborhood.  It was quiet, private and very convenient."
1112092,35773420,2015-06-22,28007597,Patrick,"What an enjoyable first experience with airbnb! Annie's space was comfortable, clean, and cute. The neighborhood - quiet and centrally located. Though we didn't meet Annie she made us feel welcome and was very helpful once we checked in."
1112092,36366579,2015-06-28,6627466,Sara,Beautiful cottage with a loft. The bed was very comfy. Good access to Seattle. Walkable and cute neighborhood.  Great set-up as we had all that we needed.  Very nice couple from which to rent.  Would stay here again in a heartbeat. Also right by a bus stop which made travel easy by public transit. We ubered to the airport. 
1112092,37295026,2015-07-06,2404329,Fiona,Lovely little cottage in a very quiet area. Had everything we needed for our short break. Great breakfast cafes on Queen Anne which was 15 to 20mins stroll away. Loved it.
1112092,43901996,2015-08-23,3263588,Weston,"It was an absolute pleasure staying ""Outback"" of Annie and Peter's home. The spacious loft offers 2 different sleeping areas; a pull-out couch downstairs and loft with ladder entrance with two twin size comfortable mattresses on the floor upstairs.    The bathroom is fantastic offering a large tub with removable shower head and beautiful tiled floors that are HEATED!  Queen Anne is a lovely neighborhood offering a variety of restaurants and shopping within a short walk from the house. In addition there is a bus stop literally in front of Annie's home. The #2 line will quickly get you headed towards downtown destinations.  After having stayed here for 5 weeks, I will say that the wireless internet is a bit inconsistent requiring occasional resets but Annie and Peter were very accommodating allowing me entrance into their home when need be to reset the router. Being here for work as a musician I loved that there was an electronic piano.   
Overall I HIGHLY recommend this property and found Annie and Peter WONDERFUL hosts. I would come back again and again. "
1112092,45979757,2015-09-07,6368912,Neal,"Annie was super nice and accommodating and ""The Outback"" was even better than the pictures. We loved the lofted bedroom and it was all very comfortable. The location was perfect for us and the parking spot was a huge bonus. Oh yeah, the heated tiles in the bathroom are an awesome touch!"
1112092,57831096,2015-12-29,13498389,Christopher,"We had a great stay in Annie's cottage. It is very cozy! Thanks, Annie, for letting us stay. We may call again one day!"
7011200,38674947,2015-07-17,19248926,Caroline,"Chris' place was neat, clean and cozy. It had everything I needed and was a quick cab ride from the downtown area. He reached out to me before my arrival to make sure that his directions for getting into the apartment were clear and easy for me. He seemed very invested in making sure that my stay was of the best quality. Overall, great place, great host. "
7011200,39120452,2015-07-20,19873631,Autumn,Great apartment! I would definitely recommend staying at Chris's place. It was clean and light filled apartment with a big TV and a comfy bed. Chris was very helpful and attentive. Would definitely recommend staying here! 
7011200,40062427,2015-07-27,36666315,Julie,Chris was more then helpful. He gave us information on places to go and sites to see. His apartment was clean and comfortable. We would definitely stay there again!! 
7011200,41155280,2015-08-04,19751105,Cameron,"Chris was great! Very attentive and available. Apartment was clean, although felt a little far from downtown."
7011200,41463163,2015-08-07,39092808,Jimena,"Staying at Chris's apartment was a great experience. 
His apartment is clean, cozy, has a great living space with lots of light. 
The kitchen has anything you might need. 
The mattress is super comfy!
The apartment is in a quiet and very relaxed neighborhood ideally located. It is super close to the very beautiful Discovery Park and to Ballard where we found lots of good restaurantes, the amazing croissants of Cafe Besalu and the always fun to watch Locks of Hiram M. Chittenden. 
Chris was a SUPER host!
He is extremely attentive and easy to communicate with.
We wouldn't hesitate in staying at his place again while in Seattle. "
7011200,41552994,2015-08-07,764722,Erin,"Chris was an awesome host with an equally lovely space. He was incredibly responsive and helped us book on a tight turnaround, which my mom and I really appreciated! The apartment is beautiful, immaculately clean, and in an awesome location. Would totally come back. Thanks again for having us!"
7011200,42178210,2015-08-11,31621623,Ariel,"My friend and I were visiting Seattle last weekend and were so pleased with Chris's place! His apartment is very well put together in terms of decor and is very spacious. Being outside the city center was great, at night it was quiet and very easy/cheap to uber to the spots we wanted. When we got there Chris called to make sure we knew how to work the TV, Bluetooth speakers, etc and gave us some great suggestions on nightlife and restaurants. It was a great experience. If you are looking to spend time in Seattle I would highly recommend Chris's place."
7011200,42607629,2015-08-14,3106238,Saira,"Chris was an amazing host and did a great job making sure I had everything I needed.  His spot allows quick access to Queen Anne, Fremont, Ballard, or downtown restaurants/bars—right in the center of anywhere you’d like to go.  I’d highly recommend Chris, he’s a great guy and puts in a lot of effort to make sure you’re comfortable."
7011200,43292672,2015-08-18,35257442,Ashley,Chris's place was wonderful! It was in a good proximity of everywhere I wanted to go and the apartment was clean and very comfortable. There was a parking spot available as well which was very convenient! Chris is also very helpful recommending places to eat! I would definitely recommend staying at Chris's home!
7011200,44195160,2015-08-24,1343437,Calvin,"I had a good stay at Chris's apartment. The apartment is clean and spacious, and I loved the big windows in the living room, with a view of the hills. Chris gave me great recommendations of restaurants in the area. The apartment is close to the Ballard and Fremont districts which are great areas to explore. A couple things to note -  it is an apartment complex so you may hear the neighbors. The dedicated parking spot was super helpful as street parking was limited, but the entrance is on a side street and not from the front. The bed is a full-size. Overall it's a great apartment and I would recommend it!"
7011200,45183303,2015-08-31,22351502,Kristin,"Chris' place was great! Comfy bed, very clean, and close to everything. Definitely recommend!"
5473498,30992157,2015-04-30,23410463,Andreas,"Really enjoyed my stay at the house! Good location, easy to get around and really close to beautiful Greenlake and within walking distance (15/20 min on foot) of U-District. 
Also close to a lot of good places to get food.
The house itself has clean and wellkept bathrooms, nice common area, and a great backyard. The area around the house is also very quiet and peaceful (family area).
The host ""Daniel"" is also super friendly and will go a long way to make sure you have a good stay! At least he did so for me.
Also went to my first Baseball game (Mariners game in Seattle) with host and roommates, and had a really good time! 
All in all this is a really good place to stay, with a lot of posibilities to have some fun close by!"
5473498,36686622,2015-06-30,33761981,Bayley,Awesome place to stay.. Walking distance to the lake which is rad!
5473498,37800690,2015-07-10,33761981,Bayley,Daniel was an awesome host! Extremely responsive and always giving the best tips on when/where to adventure. 
5473498,39005974,2015-07-20,33159956,Yinan,"I had a very pleasant stay at Dan's house. I went Seattle for a summer training. Though I only had a few days exploring Seattle, Dan was very informative and responsive. Dan offered plenty info about exiting events and interesting places to visit, which made my intensive training so much fun and relaxed. Being Dan's guest, you will never get bored.

The house is just a stone's throw from the nearby bus stops, which can take you to the University district and downtown within 15 min. Wonderful host, nice location, cozy room, sufficient amenities, quiet and safe. What else you can you ask for?

"
5473498,41119755,2015-08-04,38039499,Roie,"Daniel was a super fantastic host. He checked in with me a few times to make sure everything was going smoothly, and also messaged me a few times to let me know about fun events going on in the area. The permanent tenants of the house were also very welcoming and friendly.

The room itself was not luxurious, not a lot of light or airflow, and the mattress was not of great quality. But it was still a bed and a roof, and much better than a hostel. For the price it was still really good value, and for my purposes totally fine. Overall 5 stars, highly recommended especially if you're on a budget."
5473498,42426599,2015-08-13,38262433,Oluyemi,"About Daniel:
Dan was an awesome host! He is very very responsive, very welcoming, helpful and always giving the best tips on when/where to adventure which makes the stay a lot nicer and easier! 

Location:  
The place is a good location. It's one/two(depending on how far you can throw :) ) stone's thrown away from the bus-stop serving the U district, downtown etc . The area is beautiful and easy to commute from. There is also a lot of different places to eat and buy groceries. They are 10 minutes walk away.

Room: 
Semi-private access to the finished basement in the back. Pictures well represented what the room actually looks like. It's a private room and shared bathroom. It has a microwave and a fridge. It also had a table and chair. Also a dresser with a mirror and closet space. Light/Air inflow wasn't that great, but it was enough. 

Others:
Laundry(Washer(W), dryer(D), ironing) in the basement for $1 each(W,D). Also having access to the kitchen upstairs. 

Me:
I stayed for a week and my stay was seamless."
5473498,45130901,2015-08-31,25030582,Becca,"This is a solid crash pad for young travelers. Near Green Lake, UW, and bus stops, it’s a nice neighborhood and a great location for exploring North Seattle. The pictures are accurate, and Daniel gave me lots of suggestions for enjoying the city."
5473498,46513450,2015-09-11,31104956,Dhyey,"Daniel was great! He checked in frequently to make sure everything was okay and also suggested me festivals happening around the city. I loved at the house. Could not meet him as I was there for a very short time, but the housemates are very welcoming and friendly.

I would definitely stay at Daniel's house whenever I am in Seattle."
5473498,50294664,2015-10-11,41952336,Yan,"Daniel was a great host who was very friendly and reachable. Usually He wasn't in the house, but he always sent me a lot of information for interesting events nearby and checked if everything went well with me. Also, the neighborhood atmosphere near Ravenna was great and the location was very convenient to get to almost every part in Seattle. I recommend this place if you plan to stay in Seattle over one week and have a budget. "
6117473,34492701,2015-06-08,34457214,Katie,Great place to stay. The back porch is so peaceful. Relaxed atmosphere. Farm fresh goodies to eat. Very laid back. Will definitely be back. Jessie was a gracious hostess. 
6117473,34822773,2015-06-12,22017482,Ashley,"My host was friendly, accommodating, welcoming and down to earth. The room and bathroom were great. The bed was comfortable and the kitchen was full access. I loved that she offered fresh fruit from her garden. There are a few kitchen rules to work with but all are easy to comply with. She has a small working garden and chicken coop so she is into living as sustainably as possible. It's a great location, feels a bit sketchy outside but that is just because the neighborhood is a bit run down. Otherwise everyone is friendly. You can walk to Safeway and the train. If you say you are going to do something the expectations are that you will. So don't be wishy washy here."
6117473,36154369,2015-06-25,4212497,Abhishek,Was an epic experience
6117473,36478203,2015-06-28,8749784,Peter,Excellent outdoor accommodation  close to Light Railway link. Jessica was a marvellous host and made me feel very welcome. The tree house was very comfortable and I enjoyed sleeping under the stars. I would certainly recommend this to anyone looking for a quiet place to stay.
6117473,37009954,2015-07-03,2377843,Emily,"This urban treehouse was beautiful, unique and totally fun! The treehouse is on a peaceful lot that is essentially an urban farm and I had a great night's sleep under the mosquito netting. We used the kitchen, bathroom, and back porch of the house (which was completely idyllic and comfortable). 

Overall, I loved my stay at the Urban Treehouse! Jessica is great and flexible. Just know that there is a tall ladder one must climb up to the treehouse and it might be difficult/impossible to take heavy luggage up there. "
6117473,38885741,2015-07-19,7690746,Jane,"I really enjoyed staying in Jessica's treehouse. The space is very nicely put together and there was a vase of freshly cut flowers from her garden waiting for me when I got there.  Jessica was an excellent host, very welcoming, and went above and beyond to make my stay as comfortable as possible for the two weeks I stayed there. I loved being able to pick raspberries and figs from her garden and hope to be back soon! "
6117473,39219443,2015-07-21,13376464,Katie,"Jessica is definitely an urban farmer and the tree house is nestled in amongst it. I had my first raw fig, which was amazing. There are even bees and chickens, but you might want to be an early riser in case they have something to say. It's really quite comfortable and easy to fall asleep under the stars. Jessica's roommate was quite nice and even dropped us off in Georgetown for a late bite and drinks."
6117473,40134043,2015-07-28,23267848,Adam,"Staying in Jessica's treehouse was such a nice bonus during our trip to Seattle. The platform is covered in case of rain (which there was) and the bedding is warm. The fresh breakfast in the morning basically all came from the garden, including the eggs. Location is convenient using the the Link light rail line from the airport.  Very pleasant and relaxed environment. Would definitely stay again."
6117473,41474772,2015-08-07,9500608,Thomas,"Jessica est une super hôte et sa tree house est excellente pour se relaxer, le corps et l'esprit au milieu des pins. La maison principale vous est grande ouverte; cuisine, salon, salle de bain, tout est parfait. En plein jet-lag j'ai été reçu à diner, superbe barbecue avec des produits du jardin. Il y a un vrai sens de la communauté ici. Souhaitant rester plus que les 2 nuits réservées, Jessica m'a conseillé de rester chez son voisin Josh, un hôte aussi attentionné et chaleureux. Il y a un système de transport en commun pour se rendre dans le centre de Seattle mais je n'ai pas pu l'essayer, ayant une voiture. Sur ce point, aucun problème pour se garer devant chez Jessica.  "
6117473,41796095,2015-08-09,27473196,Melissa,"This property was an oasis. I had the best 3 nights sleep in the Treehouse, very snug and cosy. I had a great experience cooking with Jessica and two others, I was instantly welcomed into her home. I felt very at ease pottering about and loved the fresh eggs in the morning.  A short walk from light rail. Highly recommend this property."
6117473,42163750,2015-08-11,17020227,Eugenia,"Our stay in the tree house was a unique and tranquil experience. The tree house was extremely comfortable and was the best sleep we got on our trip. Jessica and her roommate were both very kind and accommodating, and the delicious breakfast from Jessica's garden was the cherry on top for our stay! We would definitely stay there again!"
6117473,42585415,2015-08-14,16973591,Jessica,"Jessica's urban farm was an excellent place to stay - Close to downtown and near the train, it was easy to get back to the treehouse after adventuring in the city. It was private and quiet at night. A nice platform with room to sit and relax up there. It rained at night but Jess dried everything out for when we returned. The only downsides were climbing up and down the ladder and using the bathroom inside. A raccoon visited us one morning and watched us from the edge of the platform. You really are immersed in urban nature! A lovely bounty of veggies and eggs from the garden. A very pleasant stay. "
6117473,42940139,2015-08-16,12612455,Rachel,"Jessica was a great host and the treehouse was awesome!! Lovely property with beautiful gardens. I ate my way though her yard and grazed on fresh raspberries, tomatoes, plums, and apples  :)"
6117473,43392029,2015-08-19,2112496,Estefana,We had a lovely stay in Jessica's treehouse. She was a very accommodating host. We enjoyed picking fruit from the trees right outside the treehouse each morning. We definitely plan to stay here again next time we visit Seattle.   
6117473,43809334,2015-08-22,29166057,Joaquin,"Staying in the urban treehouse was the foundation for a fun and unique first-time trip to Seattle.  Communicating with Jessica the host was very easy and, once I arrived, she gave me  an extensive tour of the treehouse, garden, and main house.  She was also an excellent source of information about the area - providing info about local eateries, hiking and trail running and live music options, more tourist-y options, and public transportation.  The treehouse itself was even better than advertised - what they don' t tell you is how delicious short afternoon refreshers between adventures feel up there, what it's like to be lulled to sleep by the gentle sound of the wind through the trees at night, or the peace that can come from just a few minutes of watching the bees leaving the hives (located plenty far away from the treehouse!) for their morning commute.  Or even the simple joy of having a still-warm-from-having-been-under-the-chicken egg for breakfast.  Access to the light rail, which is a short 20-minute ride right to downtown and all the major tourist stuff, was a pleasant half-mile walk from the treehouse and only $5 for an all-day pass.  I also did a fair amount of driving during my visit and I appreciated being close enough - tho not so close that traffic noise was an issue - to the major north-south surface streets and highways to make navigating in this new city very easy.
In short, I loved staying in the treehouse and will try like the devil to stay here again for every future trip to Seattle."
6117473,44326536,2015-08-25,39398662,Leah,"My husband and I loved Jessica and her treehouse. The treehouse was a nice break after wandering around the city of Seattle, and we spent a lot of time watching the chickens. The bed was very comfortable, and the net that goes around it kept away the bugs and helped you feel cozy. 

It's a short walk from the buses and also the LINK, which was great for us as we were car-less for our trip. Jessica has lived in the area for a long time and gave us a lot of great suggestions of where to go along with some little travel maps and brochures to look through. She was also very flexible and accommodating.

One morning Jessica even made us a great breakfast with fresh eggs and tomatoes and squash from her garden! We loved to sit on her porch in the morning. It was a very restful and comfortable place to stay, and we'd definitely stay here again if we come back up to Seattle."
6117473,44660881,2015-08-28,17071767,Kelly,Jessica helped with suggestions. had lots of fresh garden food. A few lovely stories. We had an exciting night in the treehouse. This is also pretty close to the Link.
6117473,46297437,2015-09-09,40551364,Shyanne,"Our time spent at Jessica's home was far from a negative one. We ended up having to stay inside due to the weather but she made plenty of room for us inside. When weather cleared up towards the end of our stay, we were allowed to stay outside and the treehouse was super cute. Jessica was very accommodating with breakfast straight out of the garden. The neighborhood, though a little bit out of the way from downtown, was nice and quiet despite being in Seattle. Though our arrival was a little bumpy, Jessica remained very available to help us be able to have the best stay possible. "
6117473,47391486,2015-09-18,33702561,Cheryl,"Jessica was super flexible and accommodating with my schedule. She made arrangements to meet me earlier than the listed check-in time, handed me the keys, and explained the living space very thoroughly. 

I had a small over-the-shoulder duffle for my solo two-night stay, so it was really easy to go up and down the ladder with my stuff. If you have a large luggage, you're able to leave it inside the house, but keep in mind Jessica may be renting it out to other Bnb-ers. 

The treehouse itself is literally a platform in the trees with a bed, lock box, mosquito net, small coffee table, and two chairs..super cute arrangement, but not a ton of space to move around. I was concerned about the cold because the California sun has spoiled me, but the bed was super comfortable and warm, I think I even got a little sweat going (granted, I wore a beanie that could cover my nose, a scarf, and sweats). It rained my second night there and nothing got wet and I was still warm in bed. There's also an outlet by the bed for you to charge stuff.

If you're on your own, I would recommend getting back before sunset (I looked it up on weatherchannel) because there aren't as many street lights and it gets a little scary with seemingly abandoned houses everywhere. The treehouse is about a 15-20 walk from the Link station. Nothing really to do in the area, there are mainly Vietnamese stores (there's a really good pho place you should check out! Forgot the name, but no msg!).  

SeaTac (airport) > Othello Station (bnb stop) = ~25 min. 
Othello > Westlake (downtown Seattle) = ~30 min. 
Super convenient, especially since a day pass is only $5!

If you have time, sit down and get to know Jessica! She's really chill and down-to-earth, and has a huge heart for her community. I was so thankful I got to chit-chat with her a bit. This was my first time trying out AirBnb and she made it super fun and easy!"
6117473,48738932,2015-09-28,5517658,Fabio,The treehouse was fun and Jessica was a great host. 
4041868,26435469,2015-02-12,14906619,Zac,The place was perfect for our group(5 guys) we go around and work everywhere and it's always nice to come back to comfortable beds. Also nice enough to deal with our ever changing schedules. Thanks again
4041868,28093577,2015-03-17,28199424,天翔,在方子出现问题时，凌晨两点房东还赶来解决问题，态度非常好。房子本身空调比较冷，晚上在客厅睡觉几乎不可能。电视没有特别多的电视台，壁炉也是装饰。房间挺不错的。
4041868,28330813,2015-03-22,23501447,Jas,"I will preface this review by saying the communications I had with Kim and Alan were pleasant.  They were quick in their communications and accomodating.  As hosts, I think they were very good to deal with, however, the condition of the property was not what we expected from the pictures.

The pictures make the property look sparkling, but it definitely requires some TLC, especially the outside, front porch/door, etc.  Indoors the unit appears to be partially renovated, and partially in need of renovation.  

Saying that, I want to be fair in my review.  It was definitely liveable and comfortable inside, however, because it was an older property we did have to deal with a couple of bugs, spiders, etc.  Not a huge deal, but these are things I consider when looking at reviews which is why I include them.

There is a lot of space, the beds were comfortable, and the living room was well put together.  The place is about 20 minutes out of downtown.  We would take an uber car into downtown and without traffic were paying less than $15.  With traffic it would be about $20, not bad at all.

The neighborhood is described as an ""up and coming"" neighborhood which means there is a range of nice and rundown houses.  We felt safe but it still has a ways to go before it becomes as trendy as it's predicted to be."
4041868,29341565,2015-04-06,16569306,Bryan,My crew had a great experience at this property. Great communication from the host and everything was as described. I would stay in the future.
4041868,32962605,2015-05-24,4500867,Denise,"The location was very good for us, within walking distance of family.  The neighborhood is run-down, but we felt safe.  I agree with the other reviewer that the house needs some attention inside and out.   Email communications with the host were prompt.  "
4041868,35947973,2015-06-23,34309289,Raul,"The place was perfect for our group, and it's always nice to come back to comfortable beds. The place was accessible to all of Seattle attractions. The owner is easy to talk to. Thanks Kim."
4041868,45065638,2015-08-31,32608505,Joyce,"Kim was very responsive and answered my messages promptly. The entrance door was a pin lock, and we were given the access code the day before we arrived. We didn't have to arrange a time to meet with the owners, and could check-in anytime during the day, which was very convenient. 

The home was located at a small street in a older neighborhood that has seen better times. We arrived in the evening, and it was a little difficult navigating through dark streets. However, during our stay, we didn't experience any issues with the neighbors.

The entrance to the driveway is pretty narrow and steep, so vehicles with lower ground clearance should proceed with caution. There were 2 parking spaces inside the garage and a large drive way that can fit 2 or 3 more cars, which was great because we had 3 cars.

The house was clean and tidy. Two rooms up stairs with 3 beds, and 1 bedroom downstairs with 2 more beds. It was a tidy but old home, and the home really shows its age. There were many little things here and there that needs to be fixed up. Two out of the three room's window/bug screen were missing, and the screens in the dinning area + washroom had holes in it. The dishwasher was not functioning, and there was yellow water pooling at the bottom. It was fine when we closed it, but it smelled pretty bad when we first opened it.

It was great value for the distance from downtown Seattle considering the general cost of the area. There was nothing that happened during our stay where we needed to contact Kim. Overall, we were satisfied with our stay."
6187340,54738604,2015-11-23,4244686,Emily,"Rebecca was incredibly accommodating and warm! I enjoyed being her first AirBnb visitor. The space had everything I needed for a longer-than-temporary stay - a kitchenette with mini stovetop, sink, coffeemaker, and fridge, and best of all, access to my own washing machines. The place was comfortable, and Rebecca was very attentive to my needs (not that I had too many) without being overbearing at all. 

The location is a 30min walk to the International District, and not too far from Pioneer Square, etc. Though I didn't use it, the bus system also looks quite convenient.

All in all, perfect host! I'd recommend her/this place to anyone for any length of stay."
6187340,56380898,2015-12-13,9172718,Susan,"Super convenient location, 15min by by bus to downtown on line 7 which picks up a 5min walk from the house. Was in town for work and just left my car parked in front of the house for two week stay, no problems. Easily drive to all points in greater Seattle from this central spot. Felt safe at all times. Rebecca has thought of everything in outfitting this unit, from scissors, plenty of hangers, pantry items, storage...she's an attentive host. Space heater and extra blanket if you like it cozier than the house naturally is. Judging by the quick hot water and good insulation, this is a well built house. Interesting little book collection in there but didn't have a chance to ask her about it. Nice separation between bed-studio-kitchen area and the space containing the private bath, and totally private from part of the house where Rebecca and family live. Would stay again. Thanks Rebecca. "
6187340,57216855,2015-12-23,5799815,Peggy,"Had a wonderful and relaxing stay here. The apartment itself is very private and quiet, great location close to the International District. The room looks better in real life than in the photos. Rebecca was an attentive and thoughtful host. Plenty of towels, useful kitchenette, and overall felt very homey and comfortable."
6187340,57952496,2015-12-30,2693300,Holly,Staying at Rebecca's was awesome. Apt is comfortable and thoughtfully stocked. Location great. Rebecca is warm and welcoming. the best kind of Airbnb experience. 
1136984,8100176,2013-10-15,8538497,David,"We enjoyed staying in Sanjaya's apartment, as it was well located between the Capitol Hill alternative scene and the busy shopping streets of downtown. The apartment itself had all we needed, although we wouldn't recommend it for those who like cosy nights in (no tv, very minimal cooking equipment/ingredients). It was ok for us though because we discovered the BEST dining spots in the area! Omnivores and vegans alike, head to the plum bistro ;)
We didn't meet Sanjaya in person, but he was very easy to communicate with and our access to the apartment was made very straightforward!"
1136984,11526137,2014-04-06,7073824,Jess,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Sanjaya's place for two nights. We didn't get a chance to actually meet Sanjaya, but his assistant, Rick, was very friendly and helpful. Here's a list of the pros and cons:

Pros:
-Super convenient. We could walk everywhere we wanted to go.
-Quiet building, probably only saw five other residents during our whole stay.
-Amenities (TV, cable, fast wifi)
-Comfortable bed!

Cons:
-Parking. This was our biggest struggle. I tried to contact Sanjaya about where we could park, but he never got back to me about it. We ended up having to do street parking ($4/hr, pretty steep) until 6PM (when parking is free) and garage ($17 for 8 hours until 6PM when we relocated to street). However, this took a lot of planning around our day on when to move our car for it to be the most cost efficient. I saw on Sanjaya's reviews that he gave out parking passes to another guest, but this was not the case for us.
-Cleanliness of the space. The previous people left behind some food in containers in the fridge that looked like it had been sitting there for a while. That was a little nasty. Also, the area looked like it had not been dusted in months. There was thick dust on some of the furniture.
-Too expensive for the worth... mostly because of the parking costs. We could've stayed at the Best Western for $22 more a night, which would've included parking. We easily paid $40 in parking during our stay at Sanjaya's.

All in all, if you're planning on driving, be ready to spend a good amount of money on parking. If you don't have a car, it's perfect! "
1136984,11603395,2014-04-08,13289289,Kevin,"I stayed here in the beginning of April and let me tell you, this place was wonderful. Very good location to any public transportation you need to take, very quiet building and very secure. The space was a huge apartment with all the amenities that you need. It was very clean and organized, I had fresh towels and a very clean apartment. Sanjaya is very accommodating to all of you're needs, at the time of my stay it was difficult to stay in contact with him because he was out of the country, but his assistant Rick was also very accommodating and very accessible. The location is a 5-10 min walk to Pike Place or a quick stroll to the bus and is only a couple stops away. The area is quiet while still being right next to the city. I loved this place and will stay here again when I come back to this great city."
1136984,12589430,2014-05-05,5161731,Deborah & Ludger,"Nice place next to the convention center in downtown Seattle. We felt save, access to the building was easy and the neighborhood had all we needed."
1136984,14287940,2014-06-16,15311714,Daryl,"Host was excellent at communicating with us; he always answered our emails right away.  The neighborhood was decent; view from the apartment was nice.  Great location for what we wanted to do; we were able to walk everywhere - once we parked the vehicle, it stayed there until we left Seattle.  Nice, comfortable place to stay; the kitchen had everything we needed and then some.  The coffee machine made some good, fresh coffee; I was just getting used to it when we had to leave. Bed was comfortable and so were the couches in the living room.  Quiet, secure facility; we had a good experience trying something new and we would stay there again.  "
1136984,14441044,2014-06-19,10945432,Kayla,We had a wonderful experience at Sanjaya's place. Rick was so helpful! The location is great and we walked everywhere. Thanks for hosting us! 
1136984,14500194,2014-06-21,8537839,Josh & Joanne,The reservation was canceled 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1136984,14690106,2014-06-24,11896881,Joshua,"My girlfriend and I overall had a great time staying in Sanjaya's place in Seattle. The location of the apartment is a quick 5 min walk into downtown and is situated near some nice restaurants and coffee shops as well as an Avis/Budget rental counter which came in really useful for one day. The bed was comfy and the living room was a great place to chill after a hard day travelling around Seattle. Apartment felt secure and quiet. 
The only issue we had was that we were not given check in details (ie. the mobile number for Rich, Sanjaya’s assistant) in advance so had no way of contacting the host to let them know we were there so make sure you have Rich’s number if you do decide to stay here! We were however well looked after by AIRBNB customer support so had nothing to worry about. Otherwise thanks very much for the stay!"
1136984,15318265,2014-07-07,2811795,Joy,"We had a wonderful 2 night stay at Sanjaya's condo. The building was a little dated, but had a very comfy bed, a beautiful view of the lake from the side window, and a really perfect location for the price. It was a short 5 min walk to downtown and we even walked up to Capitol Hill one night for dinner. I would definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Seattle. "
1136984,16495627,2014-07-28,6914361,David,"It was a pleasure staying at Sanjaya's.  He left clear directions upon arrival, and the place is simplistic and very clean, as we had liked.  The amenities were plentiful and the location was very (website hidden), WIFI, laundry machine, and basic comforts such as towels were even provided.  Sanjaya was an awesome host for us and I highly recommend it."
1136984,17351673,2014-08-11,7273007,James,"Overall, it was a great stay, and I would recommend it!

Sanjaya, was very responsive to emails, especially towards the check-in day. This was very helpful as we were not sure when we would arrive due to the border and work. We arrived, buzzed in, and found everything we needed in the apartment (full size fridge, TV, entertainment, kitchen & utensils, etc). A big plus, is that it is walking distance to pike place and many popular places.

The only thing we had trouble with was finding parking, mainly because we arrived late (after 10pm). Also, we were not familiar w/ the signage.

TIP: look at the parking sign right in front of the building. You'll see that it has ""zone 21"" written in the bottom left-hand corner. This was hard to notice at night. Once you understand the signage, you will find that the Zone 21 parking area is quite expansive; prepare to walk a few minutes as required. But really, if you know this, parking is not an issue. :)

Overall, an excellent place to stay! 

Thanks Sanjaya!"
1136984,17570963,2014-08-14,12298702,Cecily,"This condo turned out to be a perfect choice for my trip to see two concerts at the Paramount Theatre. The apartment offered much more space and amenities than a hotel, but was still more affordable than any hotel in the area. Everything was clean and the bed was super comfortable. My friend and I didn't have much time to spend in the condo during our short stay, but for someone staying longer the kitchen and living room would be great. There was even a washer/dryer. Super convenient location and we felt safe walking to and from the building even late at night. Very close walk to the Paramount and all sorts of things to do in the area. Communication with Sanjaya was easy and prompt. I would definitely recommend staying here."
1136984,17686966,2014-08-16,11912278,Henna,"We had an awesome stay at Sanjaya's! :) Such a convenient location, and the bed and couches were super comfy to sleep on. Our group forgot something after we'd already checked out, and Sanjaya very kindly coordinated with the cleaners to let us back in to grab it. Thank you so much!"
1136984,17941359,2014-08-19,16681005,Cayetana,"Everything was as expected. As a matter of fact, all the furniture of the living room was new. It was clean and with all the necessary stuff. The only thing is that we didn't have enough sheets the first day, since we found them all wet inside the washer when we got to the apartment late at night. Probably this was the cleaner's fault. Sanjaya was very responsive and helpful always. Overall is a good place to stay."
1136984,18470553,2014-08-27,4699388,Christine,"I was a bit worried that we were arriving late and Sanjaya would not be there to greet us, but he left clear instructions. We had no problem whatsoever getting into the building and the apartment.  "
1136984,19077879,2014-09-06,1632685,Craig,"Sanjaya's place was great. It was comfortable and clean and was very conveniently located for someone attending a conference at the Convention Center and the Sheraton. I was a little worried that with the location of the apartment being right next to a freeway that noise from the freeway might be an issue, but that was not the case (there's a huge retaining wall/sound barrier separating the apartment building from the freeway). There's also easy walking access to some great restaurants in the Capitol Hill district."
1136984,19285703,2014-09-09,1230397,Tony,"Sanjaya's place is pretty great. Just a short walk from downtown, the LINK train to the airport, and the Capital Hill neighborhood. We also never had to wait more than a few minutes for an Uber, which was nice. Couldn't really ask for a better location.

The living room is super comfortable and the kitchen seems to have everything you'd need to make most meals. 

When we arrived the bed didn't have any bedding on it and the sheets were in the washer/dryer still waiting to be dried. Kind of a bummer having to make your own bed upon checkin, but that was really the only downside of our stay. "
1136984,20386199,2014-09-28,8631668,Jeremy,"Sanjaya's condo was perfect for my short stay in Seattle. Close to downtown and Capitol Hill. It was clean, well-appointed, and comfortable. I had everything I needed. I would definitely recommend the condo to others and would certainly consider another stay on a future visit.

"
1136984,20570178,2014-10-01,20983467,Andy,"Absolutely fantastic place and experience. Great one bedroom apartment, with fast WiFi, an iron which helped my wrinkled clothes, and very comfortable bed. The location was perfect for an event at the convention center, and was a 10-20 minute walk to other key places in the city.

Logistics were easy, would highly recommend."
1136984,21797504,2014-10-24,4632261,Marisa,Nice cozy place. Near to downtown. Can't hear the freeway even though you're located near it. Would stay again here. 
1136984,22145391,2014-10-31,6198742,Laura,"This condo was a PERFECT location for attending a conference at the Conference Center. 4 of us stayed, and the apartment was simple but clean (good for our young kids). I would prefer to stay here over a hotel. Easy to communicate with Sanjaya. We also (after some time) were able to find a free place to park our car for a week with the available voucher provided."
1136984,22364485,2014-11-04,12991558,Kenny,"Sanjaya's apartment was perfect! had a little hard locating area but once I was in, it felt extremely homey. He had everything my friends and I needed, which was very convenient. I would definitely come back to stay in the future. He was very quick at responding and flexible with check-in and check-out times. Parking a little bit of a hassle and I had trouble with my car but nothing related to his apartment. Parking in a busy area is recommended so future damages don't occur. Other than that, I loved staying at his place! I would recommend anyone coming from out of town to stay here! "
1136984,22478707,2014-11-07,17057653,Ashley,Wonderful location. Spacious and clean with great kitchen amenities. Awesome place! 
1136984,22649542,2014-11-11,3568556,Andrea,"Sanjaya place was in a great location. It was also a great space for two people. We were able to walk to all the adventures we took in the city and enjoyed getting to know the neighborhood. It was a great way to start our honeymoon!

Thanks!!! "
1136984,22913006,2014-11-17,8945012,Jason,Sanjaya's condo was perfect for my visit to Seattle. It's close to everything in the downtown area and great restaurants of capitol hill (Victrola Coffee and Sitka & Spruce!). It's also a short walk to Westlake Center where you can catch the monorail to the Space Needle. The apartment is exactly as pictured and was very comfortable and quiet. 
1136984,23466338,2014-12-01,23794284,伊蒙,Good
1136984,23793753,2014-12-10,13997821,Kris,The place was great. Very convenient for anybody wants to go to the convention center or downtown Seattle.
1136984,24285856,2014-12-24,24881543,Vernon,"Sanjaya was a perfect host. He was ready for us when we checked in, everything was tidy, the description of the house was accurate and he responded to our questions in a very timely manner. The location couldn't have been better . We parked our car and walked everywhere (we had three teenagers with us). The view from the living room windows was fantastic. Capitol Hill was a quick walk away--book stores, shops and restaurants. The kitchen had everything we needed. All in all, it was a wonderful, memorable trip to Seattle and we would rent from Sanjaya again in a heartbeat."
1136984,24541902,2014-12-30,24013974,Shi,"The location is great, about ten minutes walk from pike place market. The roomies a bit small for 5 people. "
1136984,24741977,2015-01-02,1751009,Krista,Sanjaya was very responsive to any questions I had! The place is great -- clean and spacious. Conveniently located as well. 
1136984,27725690,2015-03-10,26436374,Cameron,We had a great stay at the condo!  Perfect location to walk anywhere in the city.  Sanjaya was very responsive to our questions prior to check-in and there were no issues at all.  We would definitely stay here again.
1136984,28086182,2015-03-17,13191834,Zak,"Sanjaya had everything neat and tidy for us. There are co-op snacks available that he asks to be refilled before you leave. It has everything you need for a short stay. The Chromecast was a nice touch for simple and familiar media hookups.

Parking in the area can be difficult (what can I say, it's a heavily trafficked metropolitan area) but Sanjaya provides a Zone 21 parking pass, so if you can find a spot, it's free. He provides a zone map on his instruction printout.

I used to live in this building a few years ago so I knew it was a good building in a great location close to everything. Definitely a convenient and affordable gem!"
1136984,28256440,2015-03-21,27264147,Gabriella,"Excellent, the apartment had everything I needed. There were four of us so a bit of a squeeze but the couches were comfortable and we didn't really spend too much time inside. "
1136984,28560360,2015-03-26,3676834,Kirk,"The condo was perfectly located and setup to meet my needs. Bed was super comfortable, internet was very fast. Apartment was clean and uncluttered. If you have business in the area I highly recommend it, though it would work well for sightseeing. Although within walking distance to most of downtown Seattle, including Century Link Stadium, I really enjoyed the neighborhood up Pike Street a couple of blocks (northeast), including the Starbucks Reserve and a number of local restaurants and businesses. Good value."
1136984,31091486,2015-05-02,24051667,Dayna,"Overall, I had a great stay at this apartment. It was very clean and had all the amenities you would need. I was there for a month as medical student rotating at Swedish Hospital with another girl. One of us stayed in the bedroom, while the other slept on the pull out sofa. Both the bed and sofa were very comfortable. Location was ideal and walking distance to downtown, Pike's place market, Capitol Hill, hospitals, etc. I didn't have a car, and it was no problem at all. We never met the host in person, but he was good about communicating through message. Would recommend it, and I would stay there again! "
1136984,31780148,2015-05-10,27859347,Sarah,This place was perfect for attending our conference. It was so close to the convention center! The apartment had a nice cozy feel and was very comfortable. It had everything we needed for our stay and then some. 
1136984,32089656,2015-05-13,17974719,Tyler,"Sanjaya's place was great! Very convenient and in a great neighborhood. 10-15 minute walk from everything we wanted to see and do, from local attractions to restaurants to shopping. Overall we had a great stay and would stay again."
1136984,32601017,2015-05-19,6734007,Brian,Apartment was clean and well furnished. Fantastic location - everything you need is within walking distance.
1136984,32794439,2015-05-21,29328137,Kim,"Sanjayas apartment was in a perfect location! Right across from the convention center and a quick walk to pikes market.  We loved staying here. Quick and easy access, he has the keys and parking pass available for you when you arrive.  Wish we could have stayed longer!"
1136984,33387150,2015-05-27,31554305,Xiaojun(Sean),It was an awesome place to stay in Sanjaya's place. Pretty close to everything if you want to walk. AND there're lotsa bars nearby if you're into that. There's one bed and 3 sofa in the apartment. We moved a little bit to get more space. But should be enough for 4 or less people. Oh btw there's a huge TV :)
1136984,33900046,2015-06-02,28397622,Veronica,"The place was perfectly clean when we arrived and we felt the location was great. It is walking distance to great touristic attractions, as well as important conference hotels. 

The host left keys and instructions regarding the apartment in the kitchen. He was always accessible via text or email for questions (like to let him know time of arrival/departure). He also left some suggestions about what to do around Seattle and a map, which I thought were a nice touch.

This apartment is perfect for those who need to be close to the Convention Center for work. The neighborhood has great restaurants and bars to hang out at night. It is perfect for one or two people, although if you don't mind tight it can definitely fit four.

I would definitely stay there again if I have to be in Seattle again.
"
1136984,34414969,2015-06-08,29946481,Mark,"Situated in a  killer neighborhood, the Capitol District. All available by foot. 
Comfortable and safe, good mattress, lots of light and windows.
Would stay again.

1136984,35112546,2015-06-15,33185495,Raylene,"This was my first stay via Airbnb and it was fantastic! The location is perfect for downtown Seattle and Sanjaya made sure our stay went well! The kitchen, the couches and the bed were just what we were looking for. Also the view was incredible at night!"
1136984,35913864,2015-06-23,29889812,John,"The Condo was great, well equipped, and very comfortable. It was centrally located in a very nice neighborhood. Building was exceptionally clean, with very friendly neighbors. Host handled any issue promptly.   "
1136984,36370567,2015-06-28,28658150,Sophia,"This place is amazing!  We walked in and it was much larger than expected.  Very clean and organized and easy to find. Plenty of sleeping space: a bed, pull out sofa bed, and an L shaped  couch. The TV was able to connect to my iPad so we were able to watch Netflix, YouTube, etc. 

The kitchen was clean and useful.  The fridge was stocked with a filled Brita filter for our use. 

There was a parking permit on the counter but the dates for the permit expired the day we arrived, but that's okay we didn't have a car anyway. 

Only downside was that the refridgerator was unplugged when we got there and we didn't reliaze until 2 days into our 4 day trip. Also, there wasn't any AC that we could find but that is okay since we were out most of the time. 

Overall this place is great and I would highly recommend it! "
1136984,37468515,2015-07-07,33154072,Andres,Perfect location. Right next to downtown. We walked to Pike's Market 4 times during our stay. Spacious unit. The one issue was that there was a record heat wave in Seattle during our stay. Luckily Sanjaya had a portable a/c for the bedroom. But the living room was pretty warm for a few days. I doubt most guests will experience this.
1136984,41059121,2015-08-04,1385329,Ryan,I was in town for a month with the Broadway musical Wicked this July. Let the bragging begin. the building is low key and in the middle of everything Seattle. equipped with anything you'd need for a long term or short term stay. I didn't have the pleasure of Meeting Sanjaya but I have to say he was on top of everything. There was a mistake with the street parking pass and Sanjaya fixed the problem and made it happen quickly. I will definitely be coming back to Seattle and I hope his place is available. You can't beat the accessibility. It was a fantastic month! Thanks Sanjaya:)
1136984,41924287,2015-08-10,30073292,Evan,I'm very glad we decided to get this condo. The living room is perfect for hanging out with friends and family. Sanjaya makes sure there are plenty of supplies for his guests and was very responsive to many of my messages. We kept the windows open to help cool off the condo during the day and closed them at night when it got cooler so the lack of air conditioning wasn't a problem. The location was great and we had no issues getting to or from the condo. I highly recommend this condo for 2-4 persons.
1136984,43639763,2015-08-21,34595812,Yixiao,"Great location, almost 20min by walk to every beautiful neighbourhood. The door was locked when we arrived, but Sanjaya helped contact the cleaner and let us in. Living room was big with a sofa bed for two, but I didn't sleep well. Would be better if the room could be cleaned earlier before our arrival."
1136984,45235346,2015-09-01,28188863,Rob,"Sanjaya was a great host. He stayed in close communication answering every question we had and made the whole process enjoyable.

His condo was very clean and afforded easy access to the Convention Center. On hot days it can get quite warm but, being a corner unit, open the windows allowed plenty of airflow cooling the unit down to comfortable temperatures.

I would definitely book with Sanjaya again."
1136984,45615966,2015-09-04,5086481,Blake,Amazing living experience with this apartment. Walk distance to everything. The entire single bedroom apartment gives you a lot of privacy. My wife and I cooked some seafoods bought from the farmers market. I would absolutely recommend this apartment. 
1136984,45987306,2015-09-07,9265611,Davide,"Nice apt in a very cool position. We were 4 and it was perfect: 2 slept in the bdrm, 2 on the sofa bed. The kitchen was fully equipped and had everything we needed"
1136984,46719397,2015-09-13,8946129,Christopher,This was a great place.  Very convenient location.  Fair price.  Washer dryer which is great if staying for more than a couple days.
1136984,48430350,2015-09-26,42781336,Lola,"The listing  is a very accurate description, loved the location and size of this place, we could walk down to Pike Place market and it is just around the corner from my favorite place in Seattle, The Starbucks Roastery Reserve & Tasting room.  Four  of us stayed here comfortably as the couch folded out into a bed.  Beautiful view from the  roof, that you can go out and sit on to enjoy the night lights.   We will definitely stay here again, as the host  would reply back  to my questions  anytime I emailed or called."
1136984,49104737,2015-10-01,5140299,Tara,Great location! Across from the convention center making it very easy to get back and forth. Lots of food within a block of the apartment. 
1136984,49776242,2015-10-06,2169841,Brett,"Sanjaya's place was nice and in a great location, walking distance to downtown and right in the very cool Capitol Hill neighborhood. Great restaurants within a 10-15 minute walk, and very easy to get to and from the airport. The apartment was well equipped with sheets, towels, and everything we needed in the kitchen. The only downside for us was that we were traveling with four adults and it was a bit cramped. The pull out couch wasn't quite large enough for two, which made sleeping uncomfortable."
1136984,50102607,2015-10-09,44303668,Emily,"Sanjaya was very responsive and helpful.  The apartment was clean, orderly, and well-kept.  Everything I needed was there.  The building was safe and people were friendly.  The location is super convenient."
1136984,50745822,2015-10-14,32347730,Nicolas,I had a very pleasant stay in Sanjaya's apartment. It is located very close to the convention center which was ideal for me. I would highly recommend this large and clean accomodation.
1136984,51176192,2015-10-18,45020074,Serenity,"My mother and I stayed here for a weekend trip.The location is wonderful. It's just minutes from downtown and Pikes Place Market. Sanjaya answered right away with the few questions I had. It was great. The place is basic, and is a good deal for the price. The other people I came across living in the same condo where all very friendly. I would recommend this Condo! We had a great trip, with no problems. Thank you very much for having us! "
1136984,52097649,2015-10-26,5404030,Sean,Sanjaya  was a great host and was able to accommodate  our travel schedule with no problems  at all.  He was very responsive  and the place was perfect  as advertised.  Great host!
1136984,53470127,2015-11-09,9794442,Felsha,"The space was nice and large and as described, extremely close to the convention center (my reason for being in Seattle) as well as other downtown sights and Pike Place Market. For a ""walker"" this place is great and close to everything. Sanjaya was also helpful in accommodating a slightly early check-in so that I could leave my bags and I appreciated that. "
1136984,54120794,2015-11-16,9194736,Anne,"It was simple and straightforward to access the apartment, and the location was good for getting around downtown on foot and for navigating public transport. It was a comfortable and secure place to stay, close to lots of options for shopping and dining. "
1136984,54535028,2015-11-21,47555536,Rannie,"Sanjaya was extremely helpful and he gave us a later check out time. The apartment was centerally located in Seattle downtown, it was with in walking distance to everywhere. He left us a parking pass. The bedroom carpet could use some shampooing. Other than that, great place to stay."
1136984,55619412,2015-12-03,48423237,Charlotte,"Sanjaya's place was really great. Very close to Pike Market, the conference centre, down town shopping, and surrounded by lots of great places to eat or go for a drink, really anything you want to do is in walking distance. His condo was very clean, and had anything you would need. He also left some recommendations and directions which were very helpful. The one time I did message him with a question he was very quick to respond as well. Great price and location, cannot go wrong staying here!  "
6032726,31757630,2015-05-09,32291771,Alexandra,"Susan is fantastic. She opened her home up to me last minute in a pinch when I unexpectedly had to stay another night in Seattle.  Although the listing I was in the previous night was booked, she welcomed me and set up a place for me to stay.  I greatly appreciated her hospitality.  I highly recommend a night in Susan's beautiful home.  (PLUS it's only a block from a happening downtown area in Capitol Hill with shopping, food, coffee shops, and other exciting things only a short walk away!!) "
6032726,35694257,2015-06-21,33933788,Sunny,"
Susan’s home is a fantastic and tranquil stay for young families and couples looking to relax and unwind in Seattle. Nestled in a quiet and peaceful neighbourhood in Capitol Hill, Susan’s home is conveniently located nearby public transportation (bus stop) and urban amenities (coffee shops and grocery shops). It is also minutes away from highway.  The place is very well kept and in pristine condition. The house is fully furnished with personal memorabilia and well stocked with kitchenware/barware (ie: cookware/spices/BBQ/Nespresso) for chefs and wine aficionados. For those that cannot be without technology, there is full Wi-Fi access in the house and access to a printer. The upper deck of the home is cozy with views of the Space Needle. Susan is a very gracious host and she is easily accessible and prompt to respond. I would not hesitate to recommend Susan to others. Thank you for the wonderful stay.
"
6032726,36410098,2015-06-28,31242707,Ning,When we arrived Susan was waiting in the driveway to greet us. She's very nice and helpful. This made our very first airbnb experience an enjoyable one. The house is nice and spacious with a pleasant court yard.   We would have enjoyed the outdoor dinning if the weather wasn't so unusually hot. Looking forward coming back again when the global warming has been abated :-)
6032726,37967203,2015-07-12,776661,Mollie,"We loved this house! Beautiful home as advertised. The best part is the location. Walking to restaurants, nightlife and grocery stores but feels removed from the hustle-bustle. Susan was very accommodating and even left fresh flowers for us. "
6032726,39031744,2015-07-20,27755741,Valerie,"Our family of 5 adults stayed in Susan's home for 4 nights in July 2015 to attend our son's wedding on Mercer Island. Great house, lots of room, great location, easy access to freeways, close to downtown. Beds were very comfortable (many with foam toppers), plenty of hot water for showers. We enjoyed having the gas barbq in the backyard and a washer/dryer in the mudroom! I would stay here again! Susan was available by phone/text during our stay and was a gracious host."
6032726,39140190,2015-07-20,33471538,Frances,The host canceled this reservation 25 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6032726,40737128,2015-08-02,33744118,Diane,"This home was a great find and perfect for our family.  Susan was a great host.  She met us when we arrived,  gave us a tour and answered all our questions. The location was great! Quiet neighborhood with easy walk to nearby restaurants, grocery stores, park with trails,  playground and wading pool. It's a quick ride to downtown Seattle and the waterfront. Everyone in our family group (5-8 at various times) loved this house. "
6032726,41281008,2015-08-05,6386865,Sharon,"Susan's family's home was beautiful and exactly what we needed. I headed to Seattle for a few days with 5 coworkers, as we had meetings in the area. I had questions about the listing last minute and Susan was very responsive. Everything was perfect at the house, what a beautiful place with unique charm!

Very close to cute bars and restaurants, and literally around the corner from Volunteer Park. Great for a morning run.

When we arrived, the cleaners were finishing up which wasn't a problem at all. It was a nice welcome. 

Very much recommended. When visiting Seattle with a group, I highly recommend this listing! 

 "
6032726,41750239,2015-08-09,21284532,Nancy,"Susan was an amazing host!  She even provided Legos and plastic plates for my grandchildren to use during our family reunion get away!  Whenever I had any questions she responded quickly.  The home was perfect for our large family with plenty of room for everyone. The neighborhood was fun to explore, too.  Susan left good notes to give us a feel for the local restaurants and grocery store.  When we return to Seattle with our family we would DEFINITELY see if Susan was still making her gorgeous home available for us to enjoy!  Location was ideal and easy to get to other parts of the city fairly quickly.  Thanks again Susan!  "
6032726,42391911,2015-08-13,4975518,Jennifer,"This is a lovely, spacious, clean, well-located house. Our host left helpful instructions, restaurant tips, etc. I stayed with several colleagues for a conference and we were very comfortable -- much nicer and more than a hotel!

We were unable to get on the wireless network as instructed but one of my nerdy co-guests put a workaround in place. I'm still not sure exactly what the issue was."
6032726,45374978,2015-09-02,22257871,Kathy,Susan is a wonderful host.  Her home is warm and beautiful.  The accommodations for our group of 6 were perfect!
6032726,45929081,2015-09-07,9560926,Craig,"We held a family reunion at this wonderful house that included an age range from newborn to great grandparent.  The house was perfect.  There is a downstairs suite where the baby and parents were ensconced.  On the main floor the house is beautifully appointed and the kitchen is great.  The next floor had three rooms with queen beds, and the top floor master suite has a spectacular view of the Space Needle.Everyone (with the possible exception of the new parents!) slept great!  Great outdoor grill and seating area.   Lovely park nearby for strolling and neighborhood stores/bars/restaurants are also within easy walking distance."
6032726,47757498,2015-09-21,1754710,Courtney,"Susan has a beautiful home in the middle of Seattle. Communication was easy and our group of 8 was very comfortable here for the weekend. We were able to walk to many restaurants, bars and shops in the area and many of the other neighborhoods we visited were just a short drive away. I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
6032726,49515331,2015-10-04,1535162,Eugene,"My friends and I decided to vacation to Seattle to get away, relax, spend some quality time together away from work and the usual weekend activities. I have been friends with my group of guys since freshman year of college. As everyone knows, it is very difficult to stay close to your friends as life begins and people go their separate ways. But we have managed to stay very close through these past 12 years. That is why we strongly value and cherish each other's friendship.  So, it goes without saying, that we all looked forward to this trip for quite some time. 

Even though it would have been more expensive than a hotel, we decided to book an Airbnb because we wanted to stay together in the same house. When I told Susan that I would be traveling with 7 of my guy friends she replied and notified me of the house rules, which we were more than happy to abide by. Susan and I had 21 email exchanges in the span of 2 weeks. She later notified me that the basement unit was booked for the weekend, and we would be sharing the home. A minor inconvenience but She happily refunded the cost of the basement. She later asked to describe the members of my group, which I happily complied with. Although Susan made me feel unwelcome even before arrival, we decided to stick with the reservation. 

The check in process and the first day/night went smoothly. The first night we decided to grab dinner and check out the local bars. We came in around 1am and decided to order pizza from dominos. We were not intentionally loud in any way, we did not play music or even turn on the TV. The second day my group decided to check out Snoqualmi Falls. During our hike, I received a text from Susan, telling me to remind my group to keep the noise at a respectable level coming in at early hours, and also to turn down the thermostat to 67 and to notify her once that was done. At this point, my communications with Susan began to affect my trip and the mood of the rest of the guys. She texted me again later telling me that she refunded the basement unit due to the noise the night before and again reminded me to keep it down in the early hours. 

Susan's home is accurately depicted in her photos. The other reviews about her home are accurate. The only hiccup we encountered was the lack of cable tv and the kitchen faucet leaking from the top as well as the piping below.

I was always respectful towards Susan, however, she did not make my group feel welcome in any way. Her communication was often unnecessary and somewhat condescending. If she did not want a group of 8 guys to stay at her place then she should not have allowed us to book the reservation in the first place.  "
6032726,50740827,2015-10-14,22783639,Matthew,"We rented Susan's house for a week for 8 guests in town for our wedding. The home and location are amazing. All of our guests commented on how comfortable and welcome they felt in the house. There was enough space; towels; kitchen pans/utensils/serving platters to host meals; common area to sit and have meals with each other; and temperature control was great. The parking space was really helpful, along with the street parking. The backyard patio was beautiful and we even took some family photos there. 

Susan was very responsive with questions we had about the house, and respectful of our guests. The house was very clean, and conveniently located to coffee shops, grocery stores, gift shops, and bus lines. This house made our wedding week stress-free to know our guests were comfortable and had access to everything they needed. "
6032726,51154369,2015-10-18,2938987,Sara,"Susan was very accommodating. She met us at the house upon our arrival, allowed us to use kitchen supplies, and even went out of her way to change her cable package so we could watch the Ducks game! The home was perfect for our group of friends. Very well-appointed and in a wonderful walkable neighborhood. "
6032726,53964762,2015-11-15,43776201,Johanna,Susan's house was absolutely lovely (and the beds were super comfortable!).  My friends and I had a really nice time.  And Susan was flexible with our check-out time at the last minute.  Thank you!
6032726,55112449,2015-11-28,41768148,Paul,We had some weather-related delays in making it to Seattle.  Susan was very understanding and made sure we were able to get into the home very late on the day of our arrival.  This spacious home is in a great neighborhood and was just what we hoped it would be.  We would definitely stay here again.
6032726,55883695,2015-12-06,50524375,Renee,"I felt very fortunate to have found such a beautiful but comfortable home for my family to gather. Susan met us at our arrival and made us feel very welcome. She was very responsive to all our questions plus allowed us a late check out. The layout of this house worked perfect, the kitchen was large and well equipped.  The house itself is in a beautiful neighborhood located close to shops and restaurants. My family had a fantastic time and we would definitely rent this house again. "
3908378,18218466,2014-08-23,19240588,Sam,"Drew was very easy going and welcoming. He had an amazing map of the area and fun places to go and check out. Bicycling around town was a great bonus! 
The bathroom and shower were also amazing! Comparable to 4/5 star hotel bathrooms. 
The washer and dryer were also very convenient and came in handy as we were wrapping up a 10 day trip throughout the Pacific Northwest.

"
3908378,18512844,2014-08-27,2414691,Annah,Drew and his place are awesome! It was a last minute booking and we couldn't be happier to come across this gem. Pristine. Spotless. As perfect as the photos (if not better). Nothing out of place. Every nook and cranny thought out with precision. Wished we could have stayed longer to enjoy the suite and its amenities - hope to be back to do so soon!
3908378,18609809,2014-08-28,12065393,Trisha,"Drew was great to deal with, always quick to respond and available had we needed him.  We had a short stay but it was just what we needed.  An adorable suite, exactly as described.  Perfect for a couple.  We had our young daughter with us, she slept on the couch, but it was only one night so not a problem.  Drew had a great selection of food/city guides.  I wish we stayed longer so we could read more of the books on hand!  
Suite was clean, large, and quiet for being on an ""active"" corner.  Neighbourhood was perfect - close to restaurants and shopping.  We had a car, parking was easy and free.   The back deck was perfect for relaxing after a long drive and having a beer.  :)"
3908378,18610573,2014-08-28,2928736,Jeremy,Awesome clean apartment. Centrally located. Easy commute into downtown or to airport. Drew is a super friendly host -- will definitely stay here again.
3908378,18634896,2014-08-29,11168424,Rosalee,"Drew's apartment was spotlessly clean and very comfortable. My husband, my daughter and I all enjoyed your beautifully designed, artistic space and I appreciated you showing me your artwork throughout your lovely home. A bit hard to find in the dark but that was our doing not yours as we were running late. We easily found our way into Seattle following your directions and I would be happy to recommend you to others. Thanks again for your hospitality.
Rosalee & Tony Carruthers"

It was exactly as pictured and described, and even exceeded my expectations. I would definitely stay here again or recommend to any friends or family. "

So clean and inviting and although I was only in town for 24 hours, I felt like I had a safe, cozy home to come back to after my long work day. And an apple and cheese in the fridge! Will definitely want to stay here again when I come back to Seattle. Thanks Drew!"
3908378,19743099,2014-09-17,20554041,Helen,"Very nice apartment, clean and well laid out.  Really great shower.  Drew was an excellent host, providing helpful tips on bars and restaurants as well as leaving out a welcome pack with a few goodies. 
Neighbourhood was great, basic store across the street. About a 20-25 minute walk into Ballard , where there are numerous bars and restaurants. 10 minute walk to the bus stop which takes you directly into Seattle downtown. "

3908378,21976985,2014-10-27,5526130,Dan,"Lovely converted basement space in an excellent location in North Seattle. Close to everything and a very walkable neighborhood. Drew's space is event more beautiful in person. They did everything they could to make my stay easy, peaceful, and comfortable. I was concerned about it getting cold at night being in a basement but the heater was on all night and the rooms stayed the perfect temp the whole night. There's also radiant floor heating in the bathroom, which is ideal for morning showers. Beautiful large bathroom. Bed was comfy and space was immaculately clean. My new go to Airbnb spot in Seattle."

Drew was really helpful and accommodating.  He left helpful tips throughout the apartment of things to do nearby.  He was also very accommodating when we had to change our arrival time at the last minute.
I can't recommend this place highly enough.  Stellar!"
3908378,24252252,2014-12-23,11884652,Nancy,"Great stay. Highly recommended. Thanks, Drew."
3908378,24965754,2015-01-04,8935574,Sarah,Drew's apartment was fantastic - clean and conveniently located. 
3908378,25173261,2015-01-08,24336910,Nancy,"Drew's place is private, comfortable, and spacious. We slept very well and I wish we could have stayed longer. On this trip two of the many fantastic Ballard restaurants we enjoyed are Senor Moose Cafe and Dish, both recommended by Drew in his airbnb guidebook."
3908378,25300234,2015-01-11,25617674,Harleen,"Drew was a nice host. He had towels and coffee and had all the basic toiletries needed. The listing description was accurate, but my friends and I failed to notice that this was his basement rather than a separate unit. All and all, it was still nice. The neighborhood was nice as well."
3908378,25556715,2015-01-19,17730733,Maleno,"This was my first airbnb experience and my first time in Seattle. Drew was the perfect host! He gave us great recommendations and left resources in the room for us to get around Seattle. We hardly saw him but he was always available when we needed him. The room was even better than in the pictures. It was extremely clean, had a large bathroom, and it was nice having our own private entrance. The bus stop is right next to the house, as well as a convenience store, which made the location perfect. Also, there are a lot of great eateries and bars in Ballard if you don't want to head to downtown which was 20 minutes away. I would definitely come back here. "
3908378,25806528,2015-01-26,12702974,Dave,"Drew was very welcoming and easy to get a hold of. The apartment amazing and exactly as described.  The bed is a queen and super comfortable. I would def stay here again. The neighborhood is Ballard, which is arguably the best neighborhood in Seattle! This apartment is just a few blocks  north of the ""downtown"" are of Ballard. Super convenient for going shopping, eating, or nightlife!   "
3908378,25948992,2015-01-30,1192636,Matteo,"Is a new basement with king bed, spacious shower and all the facilities. Drew it was really helpful and for sure I'll be back in this house."
3908378,26209636,2015-02-07,151669,Connie,"Drew was the perfect host- responsive, warm and welcome! :) Highly recommend his well-designed studio in Ballard and all of his personalized artwork. The bed is super comfy and location is close to new favorites-- Cafe Besalu (best croissants ever!!), Delancey and El Camion (the truck!) Can't wait to return to Seattle. "
3908378,26348039,2015-02-09,11278939,Elisabeth,"The private suite was perfect for my partner and I. The bed was comfortable and cozy, the basement suite is large with plenty of room, the amenities listed were all provided, and my favorite part: the shower...it was huge and luxurious! The bathroom had heated floors as well. Drew was available when we needed him and we had complete privacy to ourselves. I would definitely stay here again in the future. "
3908378,26539569,2015-02-15,19474679,Kaitlyn,"Drew's place was great! It was very very clean, comfortable and Drew was quick to respond to all of our questions. I would definitely recommend Drew's place if you're looking for somewhere quiet and centrally located in Seattle! "
3908378,26730361,2015-02-18,4158497,Sam,"The listing was very accurate.  Very very clean.  Very very commodious.  Drew himself was wonderful to talk to. Comfy bed, beautiful bathroom.

Only issue MIGHT have been that the house is at the intersection of two minor Seattle traffic arteries.  However, the room is in the basement of Drew's home, and I think the windows are double paned.  You can hardly hear anything from outside.  So.....not a problem.  I was a little worried when we arrived, but after getting inside, no problemo.

Home decorated with much of Drew's artwork.  Wonderful stuff.  I'd strongly recommend the rental.  Very nice in a great neighborhood.  "
3908378,27370275,2015-03-02,28262076,Derrick,This place was very cool and tough to beat for the price.  You get your own hotel like suite in Drew's basement.  He's very helpful and accommodating!  Ballard is close to a lot of Seattle's cool attractions and this place is within walking distance to a lot of great bars. 
3908378,27593917,2015-03-08,7508783,Bradley,"Clean, quiet space. Excellent location and great communication w/ host. Highly recommend."
3908378,27770248,2015-03-11,27472372,Anne,"We loved staying at Drew's place- clean, quiet, easy to get to and great location. The bed was great! Would highly recommend staying here."
3908378,28024950,2015-03-16,17024018,Elizabeth,"Drew's place was awesome! The unit is modern and well decorated. The bed is comfortable, and the rainfall shower is amazing. We also appreciated the cute handwritten signs throughout the unit. :)

We did not meet Drew in person, but he was extremely responsive to all of our questions via email. I highly recommend this AirBnB!
"
3908378,28515040,2015-03-25,6442653,Jill,"Our son lives in the neighborhood, so this was the perfect location for us. We loved the suite and would definitely book it again. It was one of the most comfortable beds we've ever slept in away from home, which was unexpected and awesome! The bathroom was huge, including a big glass shower with a rain shower head, and a double sink. The sectional sofa and chair with ottoman made it a comfortable place to hang during down times. If the weather had been better, the deck in the back yard is private and cozy. There is a great coffee shop and several bars and restaurants within a couple of blocks. Also within walking distance (healthy walk!) are a number of great micro breweries, a distillery, and a chocolate factory -- all of which we toured on the Saturday of our visit. All in all, a really great find. Thanks, Drew!"
3908378,28655004,2015-03-28,27743154,Michael,My family and I had a wonderful time while staying at Drew's. The bed was simply amazing. I also cannot express how great the shower was. We loved the art and the artistic notes that decorated the place. The drawn map of the local area with recommended places to visit was awesome. We hope that Drew's is available on our next visit to Seattle. Thank you.
3908378,29004555,2015-04-02,16209487,Shelly,"This space was more spacious than I anticipated.  It was spotlessly clean, comfortable, and well situated. I woukdstay here again."
3908378,29290168,2015-04-06,7627692,Alison,Lovely suite in a quiet area. Had a great time. Drew was a welcoming host and provided us with a wealth of information on the area. His hand-drawn map of local places of interest was great and helped us short-list what we wanted to see and do. The suite is close enough to Ballard centre for a good walk or a few dollars for a ride using Uber. If we are back in the area we would certainly stay there again.
3908378,29476830,2015-04-07,4487798,Alex,Drew was an excellent host since I had an early arrival flight into Seattle. Very responsive to my needs and the place is located in a beautiful neighborhood in Seattle. Will be coming back again. 
3908378,29680871,2015-04-11,20937401,Richard,"Great place to stay in a residential neighborhood. Drew  helped me find some great craft breweries. Comfortable bed, great shower, comfortable sitting area. Recommended."
3908378,29868085,2015-04-13,29663444,Christine,"Loved this place! Super clean and comfortable, plenty of room to lounge around. We were only there for one night, however this seems like a great place to stay for a few nights. Some great food, coffee, bar options within easy walking distance and plenty of neighborhood parking to come and go easily for a short drive to the main shops and restaurants in Ballard. If you're a thrifter (like me), you'll be pleasantly surprised to find a great Goodwill almost just across the street from here :) It is at an intersection, however we found it pretty quiet and got a great nights sleep. Brewed some tea with the electric kettle for a lazy morning before hitting the road. Highly recommended spot!"
3908378,29976515,2015-04-15,1128976,Vanessa,"This was a quick one night stay at this Ballard home, but it was perfect. Beautiful. Clean. Convenient. Cozy.  Comfortable.  And worth a revisit.  I didn't get to meet Drew but he was very responsive and easy to work with. Highly recommended.  "
3908378,30143610,2015-04-18,19474679,Kaitlyn,"This was my second time staying in Drew's place and it was just as clean, quiet and convenient as the first time. Highly recommend Drew's place!"
3908378,30727624,2015-04-26,14617467,Blake,"We stayed at Drew's while we went to a couple baseball games at Safeco. We took a taxi from the house, and everything went smoothly, we had such a blast! We fell in love with Drew's space and slept like babies, and we should probably mention that the shower is pure luxury. We will definitely be back! Thanks Drew!"
3908378,30964909,2015-04-29,11277867,Sam,"Excellent. Easy in, easy out, great basement/studio with good shower and washer and dryer if needed. Left tea and coffee for us, guide books and excellent little notes around the place. Close by good places in Ballard - top notch arrangement. "
3908378,31055003,2015-05-01,21132579,Chris,"The place was very easy to find and enter.  Drew was very quick with responding to any issues. The property is exactly as described, the shower is a dream! We were only here very briefly but it was a great start to our trip and its location is perfect."
3908378,31177429,2015-05-03,28243722,Jiaan,"Room was clean, well-furnished, and easy to into. The surrounding neighborhood was charming, and great for a stroll."
3908378,31563137,2015-05-06,20340106,Chris,"I had a wonderful experience at Drew's place!  There is a private entrance to the basement apartment, and although I never met Drew it was clear that he was available for any needs I Might have had.  Highly recommend!  "
3908378,31642887,2015-05-08,9471858,Jared,"We had a great stay. The place was spotless, and the neighborhood was very nice. It was easy to get in. Drew was helpful."
3908378,32029808,2015-05-12,8013961,Chris,"Drew's place was just as advertised, very comfortable and clean. The bed was very comfortable in the apartment feels really spacious. I would happily stay here again and recommend it to a friend."
3908378,32092800,2015-05-13,21196238,Kc,Really comfortable place in a cool part of Seattle. Will definitely return to stay when I'm back.
3908378,32223269,2015-05-15,33249721,Matt,"Drew was an excellent host showing us around his home and sharing his incredible travel experiences. He was very considerate about giving us our space. The listing was exactly what is posted, clean and well kept.  The neighborhood has a lot to offer to locals and travelers alike. I would definitely stay here again."
3908378,32499903,2015-05-19,7475225,Jeroen,"We stayed at Drew's place for five nights and really enjoyed our stay. Drew is really a nice guy, asked us if we wanted some breakfast (we just had some...) and he had some left over beers which we were able to drink. 

The basement was great, we had all the privacy we wanted and the shower is just the best. The appartement is big enough for 2 people. Oh and the washingmachine and dryer were easy to operate. 

When we arrived Drew told us where the we could get the best food. We went to The Fat Hen, great breakfast! Delancey's should have one of the best pizza's of Seattle ;) And downtown Ballard is wonderful with all the local brewers and restaurants. 

If we ever come back to Seattle again, we will definately stay at Drew's place!"
3908378,32841957,2015-05-22,18524382,Justin,"Drew was the perfect host for our two day visit.  Prior to arriving in Seattle, I already had a greeting e-mail and his responses never took more than 5 minutes. Although we were here for business and not leisure and were in and out all day, Drew was quick to offer help when we requested it.  He was also very respectful about our space and I think his reviews are well-deserved.    

Additionally, directions were clear and everything was conveniently set up. The listing description was spot on and Drew's artistic touches really made the place feel special.  "
3908378,33105980,2015-05-25,5960964,Joy,"Drew's place was fantastic. Drew easily accommodated our arrival time. Location was right in the middle of Ballard, easily walkable to all areas. The house was comfortable, clean, up to date and hassle-free. Highly recommend for anyone looking to stay in Seattle!"
3908378,33522044,2015-05-29,32359374,Anika-Rose,"Comfortable bed, clean place, and amazing location. "
3908378,35396959,2015-06-18,20672702,Jaclynn,Cute place. Very clean. My family enjoyed their time at Drew's place. I would recommend this place if you're visiting Seattle. 
3908378,36186507,2015-06-26,32707527,Hillary,The listing was exactly what I expected. Host greeted us but gave us our privacy. 
3908378,36803165,2015-07-01,32370637,M.L.,"Perfect stay here. The place was spotless and in a very cool neighborhood. Drew gave us great recommendations on breweries, hikes, and burritos - and lent us bikes to check it all out. We have no doubt that we would stay here again "
3908378,36950853,2015-07-03,6135458,Jody,"Drew's place was perfect! He was very quick to respond with all my questions, and his place exceeded my expectations! It was clean, spacious, and had a simple, modern style to it. Having the bikes available to explore the neighborhood was a nice touch.  We enjoyed relaxing on the back porch before dinner. We'd definitely recommend this listing!"
3908378,37560439,2015-07-08,15807540,Inka,"Drew was quick to reply any questions, and though we never met, everything happened seamlessly. And to top it off, his place is BEAUTIFUL. It's in a great area, but still quiet enough for a good night's sleep. I hope I'll get to stay again!"
3908378,38105946,2015-07-13,30382779,Alexandra,I recently stayed in Drew's suite with two good friends and we all had a blast! There was a ton of room and the location was a short bus ride/Uber ride from the popular Ballard bar/restaurant scene. The location was very quiet and comfortable. I would totally recommend staying here! 
3908378,38512872,2015-07-16,5347881,Roberta,"The unit is exactly as pictured. It is spacious and although the home is on a busy street, you hear very little road noise. Drew's home is in a great location for experiencing the real Seattle and not just the typical tourists haunts. There are many great restaurants nearby, local parks and shops to pick up any forgotten necessities. Drew was responsive and provided such nice little touches. We really felt welcomed. Would definitely recommend this place."
3908378,40080588,2015-07-28,4927215,Cindy,"We stayed a week and had a wonderful stay. We will definitely book the room again next time we are in Seattle. The space is very large, the shower is big enough for two, and the bed is very comfortable. Drew is a charming host. If you rent a car (which is not necessary because you are right by a bus line) there is plenty of street parking. We walked 2 blocks north each morning to Take 5 Urban Market on 8th Ave for breakfast and coffee. Yum. "
3908378,40382678,2015-07-30,4056594,Samantha,"Drew was welcoming, had the place very well appointed and decorated perfectly, and I loved the Ballard neighborhood with great restaurants and cafes in walking distance. The bed is the most comfortable I have slept on! Thank you!"

3908378,40757323,2015-08-02,27327053,Sean,"Great central location close to Ballard, Phinney Ridge, Fremont and Greenlake. Drew was hospitable and the house fitted our needs perfectly.  "
3908378,41092079,2015-08-04,18167489,Steven,"A nice place in a quiet, safe neighborhood.  The place is a little spartan (e.g. no desk or table to put your laptop on) and doesn't have a full kitchen.  Drew was a responsive host. Overall, a good experience. "
3908378,41426257,2015-08-07,1936462,Jessica,"Drew's place was great. It was centrally located to a variety of delicious restaurants and cute shops. His rental suite was private, comfortable and clean. He was very accommodating and we appreciated all of his recommendations. "
3908378,41927273,2015-08-10,30753276,Jacalyn,"Lower level bedroom, lounging area,and private bathroom is spacious and very comfortable. Loved the decor. The washer/dryer and mini fridge was a bonus. Bed was very comfortable. Easy access to bus. We were in Seattle for a family function and Drew's place was only a few minutes walk to family. Lovely walk thru the neighborhood.  We will definately book with Drew again!!"
3908378,42675917,2015-08-15,5985012,Analiese,"We had a great experience staying with Drew. The house is beautiful and the basement suite is clean, modern, and very comfortable. It's in a great location to explore the Ballard neighborhood and Seattle!"
3908378,42854841,2015-08-16,7698640,Jessica,"My fiancé and I enjoyed our stay in this craftsman basement apartment.  Drew was great at communicating check in time!  We only stayed 1 day, but had a great time visiting Golden Gardens Park, Green Lake and a ton of breweries in the area.  Our favorite was Stoup!  We couldn't get to them all but great beer at all of them!   The location was a quick drive to all the great spots and we loved the hand drawn map of his favorite places, we could definitely tell he was an artist!  Thanks Drew"
3908378,43512408,2015-08-20,14204330,Jay,Great place with a comfy bed that'll make you late to every appointment. Great location. Thanks Drew!

3908378,44172251,2015-08-24,29699798,Janelle,"The host was very accommodating to our needs! We asked to check in earlier than the check in time, and he was able to get it all ready fast (unfortunately we ended up taking longer due to meeting up with friends). The house was beautiful and clean, and the location was perfect!"
3908378,44405543,2015-08-26,7075545,Karen,"I loved staying here!  Wonderful location - close to a lot of things to do in Ballard, and the space is very comfortable.  The next time I'm in Seattle I hope this place is available!  Thanks again."
3908378,44917595,2015-08-30,1757957,Artemis,"Drew's place was great! It was incredibly comfortable.  Ballard is a cool Bohemian neighborhood with tons of good food options. Drew's private sweet is very attractive and spacious.  My boyfriend and I only stayed for 3 nights but I would have loved to stay for more. Comfortable bed, immaculately clean, lot's of light, and short bus or Uber ride to the downtown area.   Drew definitely gave us our privacy, we didn't actually meet him, but he was very quick to answer any questions we had about the area and to give us great recommendations on local cuisine.  I would love to stay at Drew's place again the next time I'm in Seattle."
3908378,45382672,2015-09-02,13620188,Ellen,"Drew's place was great! The apartment was clean, spacious, well decorated, and the bed was very comfortable.

3908378,45919821,2015-09-07,7411688,León Felipe,"Me and my wife had a great time. Drew's place is perfect for any couple. The pictures match the place. Drew was very kind and even  made us a personal favor for which we were very grateful. He is a great host. We had absolute privacy but we never felt alone in Seattle. Drew replied almost instantly to our messages. We loved the drawings with instructions! We f we come back to Seattle, we would definitely like to stay with Drew again. I absolutely recommend staying in Drew's place. "
3908378,46283138,2015-09-09,38710992,Patrick,Drew was great.  The accommodations were very clean and exactly as advertised.  Drew's suite is spacious and private.  
3908378,46894121,2015-09-14,6011102,Nikki,"Cool, cozy space with nice extra touches. Bed was very comfortable! Drew was available when we needed, but gave us our space. Easy access to Ballard and surrounding neighborhoods. "
3908378,48383684,2015-09-26,1028866,Kira,The space was as described. Drew made us feel welcomed. We had a great stay in Seattle and his AirBnB was very central to all the things we wanted to do and see. 
3908378,49829848,2015-10-06,44712571,Amanda,"Drew's place was perfectly suited to our needs. We planned to spend most days out and about in Seattle, but we wanted somewhere clean and comfortable to wind down at night and lazily wake up in the morning. We felt safe and comfortable!

Immediately upon arriving, we were able to settle in and unpack. The living room area was cozy and spacious, the adjacent bedroom inviting. The bathroom was larger than expected and well equipped. Everything was well decorated in a simple, clean, yet artsy manner, which I love. 

Drew knocked on the door and introduced himself shortly after arriving-- he was friendly and gracious. He caught me eating some of the breakfast bars from his complimentary coffee nook- hit the spot after a long day of traveling-- and the coffee was a welcome blessing in the morning. He had a quick chat with us about local food recommendations, which were all spot-on. 

We were located close to bus lines, making it easy to use public transit to get around town, and we stocked the convenient mini-fridge with some bottled water from the store located a stone's throw away. 

 As with all the reviews we read, the bed was extremely comfortable. I think we caught up on some much needed sleep on this trip. I almost hate to leave such a glowing review, because Drew's might be booked up next time we come back- and we'd love to stay here again!  "
3908378,50175347,2015-10-10,15925070,Caleb,"Drew's place was perfect for our needs. Great location in Ballard with easy access to buses to get downtown.

The space itself was clean, spacious and comfortable. 

Drew as a host is exactly what you want -- great communication, lots of suggestions and tips and perfect instructions for gaining access to the space. 

I highly recommend Drew's space for anyone visiting Seattle for any length of time."
3908378,50491239,2015-10-12,13696631,Shanna,"Drew is definitely deserving of the SUPER HOST title. He was very accommodating with my requests as I was on a tight schedule and needed to drop my bags early. He knows and loves his neighborhood which reflects in his great recommendations. The apartment is HUGE and very comfortable. The bathroom was a delight with an awesome rain shower. There is a lovely sitting area to relax in after a day of being a tourist. I was very comfortable (awesome bed) and even though the house is on a busy corner, it was very quiet. Great location for those that like a walkable stay. I didn't have a car nor did I need one. It was perfect PNW weather and I really enjoyed walking in the crisp air for my morning coffee at Slate Coffee (sooo good). My only wish is I had stayed longer. I hope to be back again and would definitely book with Drew again.  "
3908378,50936763,2015-10-16,42535217,Mary Elizabeth,Drew was a great host and his place was very comfortable. We loved being a short bus ride away from downtown and within walking distance to various spots in Fremont and Ballard. We had everything we needed and Drew was accommodating with our arrival times. I would definitely recommend staying here and checking out the recommendations Drew provided.
3908378,51148605,2015-10-18,7849401,Catherine,"Drew's place was really cool-looking and comfortable.  Better than a hotel, for sure! Loved it, loved Ballard. Thanks for a great stay."
3908378,51671412,2015-10-22,607193,Daniel,"Talk about a ""super host""! Drew went above and beyond. His place is even nicer than it looks in the photos. The well appointed basement apartment has everything you could need and more. Really great place to stay."
3908378,51905132,2015-10-25,6442653,Jill,"This was our second stay at Drew's place, and we loved it as much as we did the first time. Great modern bathroom - large all-glass shower, with a double sink - plenty of room for the two of us to get ready at the same time, complete with Mrs. Meyers hand soap. The most comfortable bed! Easy parking, with some great food/drink options two blocks away, like Blue Glass, The Dray and Cafe Bambino. Drew's response time can't be beat, too. We are already looking forward to going back. Thanks, Drew."
3908378,53064505,2015-11-04,3128076,Terrilyn,Thanks Drew for a great stay. No problems at all and you were always available. The place was super clean and exactly as pictured in a great part of town.
3908378,53342766,2015-11-08,44866525,Nick,Drew did a great job of converting this space into a really cozy option for travelers to the area. The bed is comfy and the modern fixtures are really nice. Heated floor in the bathroom really helps. Just up the street are some cool bars and cafes. Really appreciated the instant coffee and tea as well. Would definitely stay again!
3908378,53988644,2015-11-15,113862,Rachel,"This was the second year in a row that my business partner and I stayed in Drew's lovely basement apartment while in Seattle for work. His place is super convenient to a great little coffee shop that opens very early (perfect for caffeinating before our early mornings) and is a super short drive to good Ballard eating. The bed is sooooooo comfy and the shower has one of those amazing rainfall shower heads... I'd move in just for that shower. 

We had a friend decide to teach at the conference we were in town for, and she asked if she could jump in on our reservation. Drew said ""no problem"" and didn't even charge us extra! He's so great. The second night we were there, we got to meet him for a minute. Such a nice guy! We will keep staying here every time we have work in Ballard. It's one of the most comfortable, cleanest, most private airbnb's I've stayed in. Love it!"
3908378,54851375,2015-11-25,43546216,Rebecca,Drew's house was very cozy and welcoming.  The descriptions were accurate  and we identified the house easily because of the photographs we saw.  
3908378,55268668,2015-11-29,17198350,Virginia,"As per all of Drew's stellar reviews, his cozy basement suite was just as described.  He was very quick to respond at all stages - quick to book, check-in, and check-out.  The personal touches like many of his prints, photographs and awesome art books make his place feel very inviting.  And of course, being so close to historic Ballard made it easy to have lots of fun times out eating, drinking, shopping, etc.  Great place!  Thanks Drew!"
3908378,55909882,2015-12-07,8005539,Kiersten,What an awesome space! We stayed at Drew's for four nights and it easily became our favorite space we've stayed at thus far. Drew was very welcoming in person and provided us with great suggestions on where to eat/drink and what to check out in the neighborhood. He was also easy to communicate with both prior to and during our stay. The bed and shower are arguably better than the reviews had already suggested. :) Would not hesitate to stay at Drew's suite again. Thanks Drew!
3908378,56421200,2015-12-13,50070875,Alan,"Full disclosure- I live across the street from Drew and rented his place for my mother as we didn't have space, plus we have a newborn in our house. Drew is a good guy and his place is great. Coordinating access with Drew was also very easy. I definitely plan to work with him again when other relatives visit."
3908378,57029450,2015-12-21,31044739,Tonya,"We really appreciated how quick Drew responded to our email and we both agree the ""cozy Ikea basement"" is the BEST place we've stayed at!  "
3908378,57770862,2015-12-29,42944614,Jim,"Great place - very clean, comfortable and warm. Perfect for what we were looking for."
4708075,33203637,2015-05-25,32197080,Pat,Catherine was the perfect host.  She made us feel welcome the second we stepped into the house.  It was immaculate and very homey.  We had the whole run of the place.  The property was a rental which was occupied by another Catherine who was equally hospitable.  We enjoyed talking with them.  Catherine not only gave us directions we needed for getting to the light rail but also drove us the various routes to get there.  She also offered us breakfast of waffles for the next day and even took us to the air port.  Best host ever.
4708075,34344617,2015-06-07,27809558,Bea,"There are two Catherines you will meet while staying here, and they are both amazing and fantastic women! 

My husband and I had just moved to Seattle and needed a place while we searched for an apartment. I don't think we could have gotten luckier! Their home is right by bus stops in Rainer Beach, the hosts are extremely comforting and sweet, and their house is so nice! The room you get is upstairs and has a comfy queen  bed and two chairs along with a dresser and a closet. They made us feel so at home! We had to cut our stay short because we did end up finding a place but we miss them and their home. This was a WONDERFUL introduction to Seattle!!"
4708075,38829414,2015-07-19,7616174,Naisha,"We stayed at Catherine's place for six weeks while my husband did an internship in the area. It was really a nice place, looks better in person than the pictures, the room had a lot of light. The room itself was nice, plenty of room plus closet and drawers. We had access to the kitchen and were sharing a bathroom with another person. Another Catherine lives in the home and she was wonderful and helpful. The host didn't live there but visits occasionally, has her own key. She was nice and cooked us waffles and gumbo, very hospitable. I would recommend this place as long as you're okay with being social. Best part was the  place was right on a few bus lines that take you straight to downtown Seattle."
4708075,39353448,2015-07-22,36971616,Beau,"The host was very welcoming and offered us lots of tasty food. This was a last minute booking for us, and she was very accommodating. Seattle was oddly hot, but the host went out and bought a box fan just to make us more comfortable. The house looks as advertised and was clean. The neighborhood is about 15ish minutes outside of Seattle by car. The area wasn't the nicest, but that was our only complaint."
4708075,39577052,2015-07-24,37478491,Christian,"Catherine was really welcoming, helpful, and full of energy. A pleasure to stay at her place. "
4708075,39965960,2015-07-27,35522902,Shanene,"Catherine was a lovely host! My friend and I enjoyed our stay in the room provided and would happily return. We were made some delicious waffles the first morning, and Catherine and Catherine were warm and friendly. The bus stop was just down the road which made our trips to downtown easy, and the neighbourhood seemed fine. Didn't spend a lot of time in the Rainier area, but next time we'll have to see the nearby Kubota Gardens which Catherine suggested to us! "
4708075,42491047,2015-08-13,41001320,Kyle,"Both Catherine's were very nice, social, and inviting.  The neighborhood wasn't great but it was near a very nice area with a pretty good pizza place that had a good view of the lake.  There was a small issue when I arrived regarding having someone there to let me in, but it was a happy accident because that allowed me time to explore the area on my motorcycle and what led to me finding a pretty solid pizza at a little joint down the road.  The house (and hosts) were very inviting and warm, and the room was very clean.  my only complaint about the room was the road noise due to being on a busy street and having to keep the window open because of the unusual heat wave.  Overall I very much enjoyed my stay, and my visit with the Catherine's, and will definitely stay here again."
4708075,43167842,2015-08-17,3823297,Ilka,"Catherine was very welcoming. She answered all our questions, had some good tips and was very helpful. The room is nice and the house is just a few minutes from a bus stop and super markets. The bus ride takes a while, but the price is very accommodating for those looking for the ""Seattle experience"" without the ""Seattle money"" like ourselves. "
4708075,44393043,2015-08-25,37617150,Alex,"Catherine is very kind. Wonderfully hospitable, introduced me to her family. She reminded me what real Soul Food tastes like. Thank you!"
4708075,44508782,2015-08-26,25692179,John,"Catherine was really nice! She was quite welcoming when we arrived and made us feel right at home. The home itself is very cozy. A nice dining room, a good kitchen, and two comfortable rooms upstairs. We only stayed for 1 night but would definitely stay here again when we're back in the neighborhood."
4708075,45432425,2015-09-02,42414376,Lauri,Catherine was a lovely hostess. She cooked us a wonderful southern breakfast.
4708075,49102914,2015-10-01,31928133,Lara,"My husband and I stayed at Catherine's for one month during our relocation to WA. It's always stressful to be 'in-between,' but we were lucky to pick the perfect place to spend that time! Our bed was comfortable, our closet had ample space for our extra belongings, the kitchen was well-equipped, and the location was great for travel both into Seattle and all points South/West. Catherine One (owner) was on top of her duties as a host -- we saw her every morning when she came to clean the house and set up for guests in the other room. Catherine Two was fun to hang out with over dinner and she was always bringing home treats for us to try. Both were warm, welcoming, generous, and flexible. This is a great, cheap place if you're just in town for the night, but I'd also recommend it to those who need something longer-term."

7070169,38432381,2015-07-15,36457111,Lucy,"My boyfriend and I stayed in Ann's studio for a few nights during a recent trip to Seattle. Words cannot describe how wonderful our stay was. Ann was so helpful, responsive, welcoming, and truly made our stay feel like home. The studio is absolutely beautiful, with fabulous furnishings, including a very comfortable bed. The kitchenette was well-stocked, and Ann was thoughtful to include travel books and provide excellent recommendations for restaurants and walks. The neighborhood is close to many wonderful parks and is a great place to explore the city. Ann's lovely home made our trip so memorable. We came home feeling restored and wishing we could have stayed far longer! "
7070169,40128485,2015-07-28,34578818,Sharon,"Ann is a delightful and thoughtful host.  She has set up a very comfortable living space in a great location.  The kitchen area is small but adequate for travelers who want to eat out most of the time:  coffee, tea, snacks, mini fridge, washer/dryer.  The neighborhood is quiet but has easy access to both the University district and Capitol Hill.  Ann was there to welcome us and point out features of the apartment and was forthcoming with suggestions on nearby restaurants and coffee shops.  Loved having some neighborhood places to visit. She left several Seattle magazines in the studio for our perusal and she has a great book collection in the apartment. There is a sweet private patio in the front surrounded by a lush landscaping.  Street parking is easy.  We really enjoyed our stay and plan to return.  "
7070169,40518978,2015-07-31,2480269,Joe,"Ann's studio was clean, cozy and private. I had a great time staying there and will definitely recommend it to anyone!"
7070169,41458105,2015-08-07,7624081,Justin,"Ann was an excellent host!  Her place was very nice and conveniently located to Capitol Hill, downtown, and the University of Washington areas.  Ann went out of her way to make our stay and our travels as convenient as possible.  Highly recommend Ann's place and would definitely stay there again."
7070169,42151394,2015-08-11,16969107,Sat Tara,"Ann made us feel very welcomed and took excellent care of us.  In fact, we would have to say we felt pampered!   The studio was just as pictured and very comfortable."
7070169,43252792,2015-08-18,37606249,Andy,"Ann welcomed us warmly when we arrived.  The location was great for us because her home is only 2 blocks from our daughter's home.
The apartment is spacious and very well appointed.  A nice touch for us was the clothes washer and dryer as we had already been traveling for a week.  We will definitely stay with Ann again! 
"
7070169,43588064,2015-08-20,9913334,Dion,"I recently stayed in Ann's apartment at the end of a long and exhausting work trip in the US so that I could relax for a few days before heading home to Australia.

Ann is a fantastic host and has thought of and done everything to make a guest feel pampered yet very much at home. The apartment is large, stylishly furnished and exceedingly comfortable - very comfy bed, large sofa to relax on, great desk to work at that overlooks the garden, well appointed bathroom and speedy wifi that works just as well in the apartment as it does in the very peaceful and private front garden! I found the garden to be an absolutely delightful area for breakfast or just to relax.  The kitchenette was also great - well equipped appliance wise, and Ann’s welcome gifts, including some fruit, yoghurt and her homemade granola couldn’t have been more delicious (and appreciated), as was the full size washer and dryer after being away from home for a few weeks!

Ann’s neighbourhood, and the location of Ann’s apartment is fantastic. I didn’t have a car, but there is ample parking out the front. I caught the bus into town from the stop at the bottom of the street.  The stop is only 2 minutes away, and after a 15 minute ride through the surrounding very picturesque neighbourhoods I was downtown to take in all the sights.  It couldn’t have been easier.  Other areas that I visited on foot that are all a short/very easy walk from Ann’s house were the Arboretum, Interlaken Park, the University of Washington and Husky Stadium and the University Village shopping area.  I had a very nice dinner at the Italian restaurant at the end of Ann’s street, which is only a couple of minutes away.

I would highly recommend Ann’s apartment to anyone, or any couple with plans to visit Seattle.  Of all my airbnb experiences, and there have been a few and in multiple countries, this has absolutely been the best."
7070169,44182901,2015-08-24,40075743,Sajida,"This was my first time using Airbnb and it was fantastic!  My boyfriend and I stayed at Ann's beautiful home and she was so gracious and so hospitable. Not only was she easily accessible she was very flexible especially since our flight in was delayed 4 hours and we didn't arrive until after midnight. She provided us with information about the town, fun activities along with how to get around via bus or taxi /uber. Her space was clean,and had all the things we needed including coffee,  water,  homemade granola and even a bottle of wine. It was an incredibly comfortable experience and we would definitely stay there again."
7070169,44922453,2015-08-30,910842,"John, Lisa And Greta (& Kaylie)","Montlake Studio was very comfortable, clean and inviting. The variety of books and lovely amenities that Ann provides makes it even more comfy. There is information available for exploring the city and the house is near a bus line to downtown. The Arboretum is a stones throw away. Ann herself is gracious ,lovely and very very helpful. I would highly recommend Montlake Studio.
Susan Bennett"
7070169,45788970,2015-09-06,3211605,Linda,"Ann is very gracious and welcoming. My parents stayed at her studio and they felt very cozy, safe and welcomed. I would highly recommend her place - the overall experience was great!"
7070169,46784225,2015-09-13,42391834,William,"the place was as advertised, very clean and neat. Ann went out of her way to make sure we were pleased. Easy 20min bus ride to downtown,  Had fruit and snacks, coffee etc in the unit ready for us.  Would stay there again.  The place is in the basement of the house she lives in but you have total privacy. She makes sure you know she is available for info or questions but is not at all intrusive.  

"
7070169,47479177,2015-09-19,29472427,Ellen,"Ann is a wicked awesome host! Her cozy little studio apartment was stocked with goodies for us and is conveniently located for walking to the UW district and around her charming Montlake neighborhood.  She is very solicitous regarding her tenants' needs: there are   guidebooks, maps, and even a convenient terrace for enjoying Seattle's sunnier days. "
7070169,48011709,2015-09-22,3558521,Lea,"Ann's Seattle location and outstanding accommodations could not have been better.  We were only there for a couple of nights, but it felt like home.  Ann has left no stone unturned in providing everything needed for a comfortable stay.  Whether you're traveling for business or leisure, the apartment is clean, spacious, very well appointed and convenient to many areas of Seattle.  We'll be back again!  Thanks Ann for everything!"
7070169,48732776,2015-09-28,41677601,Irsan,"Ann is a wonderful host. I really enjoy her studio that is neat, clean and cozy. Her studio located within a walking distance to UW campus. The location is in a safe neighborhood . "

7070169,49792340,2015-10-06,41872420,Riko,"First,I really love her.She is very kind,friendly,and filled with warm energy&love for guest. I stayed at her house just for two days but could feel she was not just a host,but my ""real host mother"". We took a tea (website hidden) was really good time.She lent me her great kitchen and dinning.And kindly drove me to my next airbnb house.Second,her listing was so so so amazing place for comfortable staying. It was very clean and perfect.She prepared a lots of organic foods(some fruits,granola,coffee,honey,milk,beer,snacks,and so on) and high-quality products(shampoo,conditioner,soap,body lotion,clean towels,tooth blush sets,and so on). I could feel her polite lifestyle from what she gave me. She is amazing,awesome,and definitely everyone's Super Host:) "
7070169,50094477,2015-10-09,43707794,Valerie,"Ann was incredibly accommodating yet respectful of our privacy.  The studio was immaculate and beautifully appointed.  We had everything we needed and more.   The neighborhood was an established area of lovely homes conveniently located near the the University, downtown Seattle, and Bellevue and amenities.  Public transportation was very accessible.  Walking to the Arboretum and on the trails was a real treat.  We will definitely come back.  "
7070169,50508816,2015-10-12,13044098,Caitlin,"Ann is definitely a super host! She went above and beyond to make our stay in Seattle easy and comfortable! She made us feel so welcome upon checkin! The space is perfectly decorated, with touches throughout to make the guests feel right at home! Her neighborhood is charming and safe, and very central. We were able to enjoy morning and afternoon walks through parks, to cafes, and through the neighborhood! I would recommend Ann's place to anyone who is looking for a very comfortable, safe, and relaxing space! "
7070169,51951195,2015-10-25,45615359,Cinta,"This is a very cozy studio in an amazing area!! Check out the Arboretum park with the trails connecting the islands...so beautiful! And Ann was such a wonderful host!! She checked out on me every single day, helping me out with anything that I needed. The last day we have the chance of chatting more over a glass of wine and we had a great great time. Highly recommended!!"
7070169,53053711,2015-11-04,44362383,Morgan,"Ann was a wonderful host, and her place is just incredible. My husband and I doubt we could ever stay anywhere better! 
Ann is easy to communicate with, left us snacks in the kitchen area, and even a couple beers in the fridge! We used the washer dryer for a few loads of laundry, and felt safe and cozy in what feels like a downstairs luxury apartment. Ann had everything we wanted and more. "
7070169,53629057,2015-11-10,47033453,Katie,"I loved everything about this stay! The unit is better than the pictures; I opened up the door and was immediately excited with how warm, welcoming and cozy it was. I was there for work, so spent most of my time at the University, but had a morning to kill and checked out an hour-isn long walk that Ann recommended... on the walk I not only feel in love with her neighborhood but also Seattle in general. I'm dying to go back, and will definitely be staying in Mountlake again.
"
7070169,53922309,2015-11-14,48184951,Marilyn,"Ann is a patient and helpful host. The studio is immaculate and wonderfully decorated. The neighborhood is full of older, well maintained homes. It is quiet and pleasant. This was a perfect place for us to stay.  
"
7070169,54459263,2015-11-20,48114851,Jill,"Staying at Montlake Studio revolutionized our trip to Seattle and made it a refreshing experience.  Graciously providing a peaceful space with cleverly arranged amenities, Ann Duncan gave us room to relax and enjoy a charming home atmosphere. We loved the convenient neighborhood shops and parks.  "
7070169,55353015,2015-12-01,41868849,Jeff,"We just returned from Seattle where we spent a week at Montlake studio through airbnb.  It  was quite handy to our son's house and well situated near the arboretum.  Ann was a gracious hostess providing us with healthful snacks and a well equipped studio.   Her house is located across the street from an elementary school up a big hill.  You  needed  to walk up 14 steps to reach her house and then down 14 steps to reach the lower level of her house.  The studio is  spacious with a separate kitchenette area.  The bed is against two walls so getting in and out requires a bit of crawling.  Closet space under the stairs is limited. There is a small mini market down the hill as well as a nice local coffee shop. The Montlake area is very close to downtown.  We took a Uber to the space needle and it was around $14.  There is also a bus at the end of the street.  Seattle is lovely and a great city for billy goats as it is very very hilly.  Thanks Ann for your hospitality... We'll be back.   Marlene B.
"
7440415,42047298,2015-08-10,29432613,Missy,Zachariah was a great host. I met him on the first day when he checked up on me to make sure I settled in okay. I didn't see him or contact him again due to my busy schedule. I was able to relax and enjoy my stay without the burden of any weird house rules or strict check out times. He was very chill and told me I could use everything which made me feel more at home.
7440415,43289519,2015-08-18,17577645,Jackie,"The location was was great!  We walked everywhere from here:  the waterfront, pike place, space needle, cool shops and cafes on 1st, pubs on 2nd... Awesome!
Zachariah was really welcoming.  He was very understanding of our lateness  due to unexpected traffic .   He was very gracious, offering to help us and he stuck around to make sure that we felt comfortable in the space.   He encouraged us to use anything that was there, which made us feel even more at ease, and the apartment was very well equipt with amenities beyond just the ""basics.""
 The apartment itself was very nicely laid out ,  A literal hop skip and a jump from the pool  and workout facilities .  Located in the heart of it all you might expect it to be louder than it was, but it was actually quite peaceful in the apartment.  It was also clean and well furnished.  The double leather couches were super comfy!  We had 3 adults and 1 child stay there, and there was ample space.
We were very happy with our stay!"
7161897,42354097,2015-08-12,40800924,Sharlene,"The neighborhood was peaceful and enchanting.   A Very nice and cozy house with all the comforts of your own home.   Very warming and inviting.

7161897,43838602,2015-08-22,14301609,Diana,"This cute cottage is very conveniently located in the beautiful Greenlake neighborhood.  The unit is literally about a block away from the west side of the lake.  The house was very charming and nicely decorated with Leia's beautiful watercolors.  The photos are exactly how you will find the home.  The living-room was quite large, more than enough space for two people to be comfortable lounging around after a walk at the lake.  Also, it would have been just fine to bring the second bed down to the common area and still have space for hanging out.  We used both beds upstairs which worked out nicely.  Both were comfortable, clean and had nice bedding.  Communicating with Leia was easy and we had a very nice stay in her place which felt more like we were visitors in a friends home because of all the personal touches.  It was awesome to have a laundry in the house.  The garden was abundant and we enjoyed the yard.  Parking was awesome, the area surrounding the unit is super safe and there are a ton of eateries within walking distance.  Don't miss out!"
7161897,44020019,2015-08-23,24209606,Jenny,"We stayed at the cottage for a quick overnight in Seattle.  The cottage was cozy, clean and inviting.

7161897,55230931,2015-11-29,47507267,Mickey,"We had a great experience! Everything about Leia's cottage was exactly as advertised. It is quiet, spacious, private and has everything you will need for a satisfying stay. Plus enough ""homey-ness"" that elevates it above your basic vanilla hotel.  And the location can't be beat...1/2 block to Greenlake, 10 minute drive to downtown & the U-District. Leia was even so kind as to leave a detailed list of things to do/places to eat, etc. in the nighborhood. Quite helpful! We'll definitely try to stay here our next trip to Seattle."
7161897,56412814,2015-12-13,10976962,Jen,Leia was wonderfully welcoming and easy to reach throughout our stay. She made us feel right at home with hospitable touches like a post-it map of kitchen contents and a homemade postcard. The cottage was as delightful as advertised - I would definitely stay again!
7161897,57340483,2015-12-24,51135074,Chaya,"Me and my family enjoyed to stay at Leia place. The house very cozy ,very clean, quite and the location is very strategic which is near to the lake. Overall a great place to stay."

Everything on my weekend plan was within walking distance. Pike Place Market is a minute or two away on foot.  Austin is very nice, super accommodating and responsive. He went above and beyond to make sure I checked in early. I can't wait to come back and enjoy Seattle in the Summer! "
6612940,34507904,2015-06-08,34646088,Dawn,"My experience of Linda's Garden Apartment was indeed lovely!  The apartment was immaculate, comfortable and stylish.  From the incredibly comfortable bed to the thoughtful amenities, Linda's apartment exceeded my expectations.  And Linda was a very friendly, helpful and gracious host.  

The neighborhood is beautiful, safe and convenient.  It is easy to get around on foot, by bus, or car.  It is a quick walk to Ravenna Park where I love to stroll through the forest and relax near the creek.

Being a downstairs apartment, the ceilings are lower and I could hear soft footsteps and muffled talking upstairs from time to time.  I enjoyed the peaceful quiet of the space so I never turned on the TV or music, but either of those would probably easily cover any sounds you may hear from upstairs.

I look forward to staying here again."
6612940,40109816,2015-07-28,1591994,Miguel,"My wife and I had an absolutely lovely stay at Linda's apartment. With a separate kitchen, living room, and bedroom, it provided a huge amount of space and was immaculately maintained. It felt like staying at a very high end hotel. 

Linda was present to check us in, provide us with a map of the neighborhood and restaurant suggestions, and even gave us a complimentary ride to the university to sightsee! 

The surrounding neighborhood offers local coffee shops and restaurants, all within a short walk. The apartment is also walking distance to the University of Washington and Husky Stadium. We left our car in Los Angeles and opted to use Uber when we wanted to leave the neighborhood for our many trips around town. The apartment is a quick car ride to downtown Seattle and the Northwest side of the city. 

We would gladly stay at Linda's apartment again and we are happy to give it our highest recommendation. 
"
6612940,55775947,2015-12-06,31746953,Brooke,"My significant other and I stayed in Linda's apartment for almost 4 months and had a wonderful experience!  It was perfect for our long term stay, with all of the amenities listed.  We especially appreciated the dishes and cooking utensils provided in the kitchen, so we were able to cook throughout our stay.  The bed was very comfortable and the space was ample for two people.  We brought two cars and appreciated being able to park on the street in front of the house for free.  The neighborhood is quiet and safe.  It is near many local restaurants and University Village shopping district, which we enjoyed visiting.  There are multiple grocery stores within a short driving distance.  Linda was present when we checked in and was always available when we had questions or needed anything.  She was very kind and helpful to us.  We were very pleased with everything throughout our stay and would recommend this apartment to anyone, whether you are planning a short trip or a long term stay."
2367298,10373777,2014-02-16,10219620,Andrej,My girlfriend and I had a wonderful stay. The whole apartment has a very warm feeling to it and is actually bigger than it looks in the photos. Erin herself is a great host. She made us feel very welcome and was very responsive to anything that came up. I would definitely stay again!
2367298,10459603,2014-02-19,9155055,Alexa,"My stay at the Erin’s vintage apartment was wonderful. The apartment itself is bigger than what it looks like in photos. The apartment is clean, stylish and close to all the cool neighborhoods. Erin, herself, was very welcoming and gave my boyfriend and I great tips on where to eat, shop and even get massages. I would highly recommend booking this little gem if you’re visiting Seattle. "
2367298,10582463,2014-02-25,12404767,Matthew,"My wife and I had a wonderful time staying at this space. It was simply charming; clean and beautiful; easy to find and the neighborhood was lovely. Wifi was good and the cast iron tub and fixtures were awesome. Erin was a pleasure, and when we had a minor issue she responded immediately. 

I gave only four stars because being in a basement apartment you could often hear the people upstairs. Also, if you're over 5'6"" you have to duck to use the shower, and the bed is a full not a queen. But I would certainly stay there again."
2367298,10695084,2014-03-03,12239199,Lisa,"This little apartment is so cute, and had everything we needed for our stay! Erin was lovely and accommodating and just terrific. She even lent us her own coffee grinder while we were there, and when we had trouble with the adorable gas-powered heater she was right down with us to get it working properly. I would definitely stay here again."
2367298,10853025,2014-03-10,11828841,Kendra,"My stay at Erin's apartment was perfect!  My boyfriend and I stayed with another couple, and they all echo my enthusiasm for the space.  The one-bedroom with pull out couch in the living room was plenty roomy enough for the four of us.  It really felt like having a two bedroom as the common area had a sliding door.  Erin provided plenty of blankets, pillows, and towels so that provided extra comfort.  I was also happy with the kitchen items available, including tea (and olive oil!) which we were happy not to have to run out and grab.  The city map was a nice touch.  

Beyond the place itself, we were pleased with the location.  We rented a car for ease of schedule, but imagine we would have been okay without it.  By the way, there was always parking right in front of the entry to the place.  Everywhere we went was a short drive away.  We even found ourselves using cabs for some trips as the fares were so inexpensive.  

At one point during our stay, Erin's handyman needed to stop in (this happened on her own initiative, we hadn't complained about anything), and Erin was super nice about contacting us to make sure it was okay.  

Overall, the place was incredibly cute and cozy and I would absolutely stay there again.  "
2367298,11076996,2014-03-19,12245410,Adam,"Our stay at this apartment was *fine*. Nothing to write home about and nothing really major to really complain about either. The location of the apartment was great and we walked almost everywhere during our stay. 

While the apartment was fine, I don't think that we would choose to stay there again. Maybe we have high expectations, but I expected a little more in the way of hospitality for this price. We weren't expecting a full breakfast setup or anything but something beyond some ground coffee in a ziploc would have gone a long ways.  For $80 a night (after fees) I would expect there to be enough lighting in the bedroom for us to read at night (which there wasn't. there is an empty socket looming over the bed, which wasn't very cosy). 

The apartment is cool, though, and definitely has some unique charms to it. I just don't think that it was worth the price when you can stay at a hostel for the same price and have endless coffee, tea and breakfast provided for you. Oh also, it would have been nice if the listing had noted that it is a basement apartment. 

I don't regret us staying there, I just wouldn't do it again. "
2367298,11135981,2014-03-22,10929429,Travis,"Erin's place is located in a nice, quiet Seattle neighborhood that's just a 5-minute cab or 20 minute walk to plenty of the happening areas with plenty to do. She was incredibly hospitable and the apartment was great, with lots of cool touches. We would definitely recommend staying here any time!"
2367298,11246039,2014-03-26,12436604,Renee,"This is such a quaint (and quite spacious) place for 3 people. My two friends and I remarked how the pictures don't do this apartment justice! Erin was hospitable and knowledgable about the area. The place is clean and Erin provided us with fresh sheets, towels, and cooking/eating utensils. Thank you again and I hope to return in the future! "
2367298,11514775,2014-04-06,6069274,Amelia,Such a beautiful home in a peaceful and safe neighborhood. Really loved our stay here. Nat and Erin were very friendly and accommodating. They provided everything we needed from tea bags for breakfast to an iron and ironing board. It was the perfect place to stay for our first visit to Seattle. I'd definitely stay here again. Thanks so much guys! 
2367298,11590627,2014-04-08,12012037,Britny,"We loved Erin's place! It was cute, cozy and felt like home. My husband and I love older homes and Erin's place was in a neighborhood full of gems to stroll around and enjoy! Our friend who visited while we were staying here was even interested in renting this place on a permanent basis. Great place. Great getaway. Will visit again and even stay a little longer. "
2367298,11757715,2014-04-14,1096865,Marissa,"Had a great weekend at Erin's. The apartment was perfect for our group of 4 and accessible to Capitol Hill and major bus routes. It's hilly in the neighborhood, so bring good walking shoes! Erin was friendly and accommodating. "
2367298,12243340,2014-04-27,4451522,Michael,It was great! Very spacious and the four of us settled in comfortably. The kitchen was good to use as well as the heater. Erin was a great host and let us check in late as well as left instructions on how to work the oven and tips on what to do around the area.
2367298,13107961,2014-05-19,15108004,Jamie,My partner and I stayed in Erin's place on a recent Seattle visit. We were first timers and very pleased with the central location of her suite! Would definitely stay there again :) 
2367298,13197579,2014-05-21,14819767,Louise,"I stayed for 2 nights and it worked out perfectly. There was a bus about 5 mins walk away which I used to go to downtown each day. There were some great cafés just 2 mins away. The apartment space was cosy and had everything I needed. Erin was a great host, quick to respond to communications and flexible around check in/out. "
2367298,13472734,2014-05-28,6039794,Lorenda,We had a great stay at Erin and Nat's vintage apartment in Seattle!  The location was walking distance to the many places we wanted to visit and being able to make breakfast  made us feel at home in a kitchen that had charm as well as everything we needed to get the job done. The beds were comfortable and parking always available right outside the front door! We would recommend this lovely apartment to anyone who likes to have a home away from home feel when visiting a big city. Thanks so much to Erin and Mat!
2367298,13613166,2014-06-01,13599686,Roopa,"We stayed with Erin and nat for 3 days! Their place was so cute- and cozy! 1 bedroom and a pull out sofa! We loved the vintage decor!!
"
2367298,14148157,2014-06-13,13648861,Gianna,"I stayed at Erin and Nat's apartment in Seattle with 3 others for 4 nights. The apartment was lovely. I loved the vintage decor and it was plenty of space for us. Although it was a bit of a hike (and a tiring one at that with all of the hills!) to the downtown area, there are plenty of convenient buses with stops located right by the apartment that get you downtown pretty quickly. The neighborhood was lovely and we had an overall great experience! "
2367298,14226910,2014-06-15,13869389,Scott,"Stayed at Erin and Nat's for two nights while in Seattle. There were 4 of us staying and the first I would say is that for four it was a bit cramped, it would be perfect for a couple. Once the pull down bed is down there is no seating space except in the kitchen. You can of course put the bed away, we didn't. Also the location, the neighbourhood is great, some lovely restaurants a short walk away but be mindful if you don't have a car as you will need to taxi or bus into the centre, again no real hardship but we would have preferred somewhere closer as our time was limited. That is more to do with our research rather than any issue with the host. One final point is that it is a basement apartment and so has low ceilings. As a 6ft3 guy I have the scars on my head to prove it. Also showering was tricky  for 3 out of the 4 of us. Other than that Erin and Nat's place allowed us to explore a little bit of Seattle and we all agreed that we want to come back to Seattle as we loved the city. "
2367298,14380067,2014-06-17,16714273,Noemi,"Really enjoyed our visit in you little charming apt. Really appreciated the flexibility in our late arrival. Our two children used the board games and having their own room (sofa bed).
Thanks! "
2367298,14438894,2014-06-19,13467380,Elizabeth,"Erin's apartment was very cozy! It looked just like the pictures. She had great recommendations of things to do in the packet she left us. The location was ideal -- out of the hustle of the city but still an easy drive or cheap Uber ride to anywhere you want to go. Erin was also very flexible with arrival times, which I really appreciated. My only complaint about our stay was the bed. It was pretty uncomfortable and very small for two people. Other than that, Erin's place was perfect."
2367298,14919961,2014-06-29,2372263,Royce,Great experience. Clean and cozy spot in a wonderful neighborhood. Would stay again. 
2367298,15255910,2014-07-06,13582348,Amy,"Erin was very helpful from the first time we were in touch until the end of my stay. Her apartment is cozy and comfortable, and she was quick to respond when I ran out of basic toiletries. Highly recommended!"
2367298,15406371,2014-07-08,15830500,Eula,The neighborhood was nice and the accommodations were as described.   we loved the Arboretum! Thanks Erin and Nat!
2367298,15868124,2014-07-17,5336963,Rachel,"Erin was very helpful with any questions I had, and we loved staying at her place and hope to come back one day soon! "
2367298,16031559,2014-07-20,17575159,Matt,"We had a great stay here! The location is great. We could get to the downtown, or to many parks, bars, and restaurants within minutes. The neighborhood was quite and inviting. The space was very clean. I would definitely recommend staying here. We will be back next time we visit Seattle. "
2367298,16088954,2014-07-22,5007730,Melanie,"We loved staying at Erin & Nat's place! We did not actually meet them, but the apartment was just as described and they included many welcoming touches. (Including Stumptown coffee - one of our faves!) The only unexpected thing about the apartment was how big it actually was - it feels quite spacious inside, more than we anticipated from the photos. Between the bedroom and the second room with a pullout, there was plenty of sleeping space for our group (one couple plus an additional person). It's also very homey/cozy and well-curated - there are kitchen things to use, books to read, etc., but the overall feel of the apartment is not cluttered. Because I had broken my foot the week before we came, we were also relieved to discover that it was accessible - no stairs to enter, and only one step between the kitchen and the rest of the apartment. (However, it is on a steep hill, so the location could be a challenge if you don't have a car and have a mobility issue.) Overall, we had a wonderful time there and would have loved to stay longer!"
2367298,16349445,2014-07-26,16345417,Pamela,"We loved our stay at Erin and Nat's! Their place was big enough for the four of us. It was easy to walk to many lovely restaurants and the Washington Park Arboretum.  Driving downtown was not difficult.  Erin left many resources to guide us through our first visit to Seattle as well as a typed-up guide to the apartment itself and the neighborhood.  Thank you, Erin and Nat, for a lovely first experience with AirBnB!"
2367298,16714710,2014-08-01,16023736,Danielle,"We really enjoyed our stay at Erin & Nat's adorable basement apartment. They were very accommodating and the check-in/check-out process was painless and easy, and they left loads of great goodies and literature about Seattle that really helped make our day exploring the city more fun. My husband was, however, a bit too tall for the shower situation in the bathroom, but we made it work! My only wish is that the location was a little bit closer to the more bustling Capitol Hill area. If you decide to walk it, beware of that hill! It's a doozy. All in all, though. Great place and people."
2367298,17202874,2014-08-09,15337582,Nina,"Great experience overall. The place is small and the living room / second bedroom has no windrow at all, so you need to be prepared to not have natural light in those areas, but the apartment is very cozy and comfortable. Erin was very warm and welcoming. The neighborhood is awesome! We walked to the mates tic arboretum and Cafe Flora. Easy parking on a quet street. The only thing I would ask of the hosts is to change the cushion on the chair in the bedroom. It just looked like it has seen better days."
2367298,17703128,2014-08-16,7589900,Eoin,We really enjoyed our stay at Erin & Nat's apartment. They were very accommodating and the coffee / breakfast items were welcome additions. The area was really cute with coffee shops and parks close by. It is quite a hilly area if you are planning on walking although there are bust stops at the end of the street. Overall we had a great experience and would recommend the place for people looking to stay outside downtown Seattle.
2367298,18177178,2014-08-23,17568554,Pia,"Pretty apartment with everthing close by (shops, busstation, restaurants, park). Everything was well prepared, espacially informationletter with for example taxinumber, or where to find the next supermarket very helpfull. Thank you ! Dankeschön!"
2367298,18654571,2014-08-30,10624540,Roel,"A great place to stay in Seattle! Convenient, relaxed, and great hosts. "
2367298,18944971,2014-09-03,7138668,Tom,"We loved staying in Erin & Nat's apartment! The accommodations were great as was the location. The apartment was bigger than we expected, the bed was really comfortable & the info sheet they left for us was a great touch. And the Stumptown coffee was a wonderful bonus. My wife and I make an annual trip to Seattle over Labor Day weekend and we would be happy to stay here again. Thank you!"
2367298,19145396,2014-09-07,19576221,Alexandra,"Erin & Nat's apartment was awesome.   It's located in a very convenient spot close to E Madison street which has an abundance of local shops and restaurants  in walking distance as well as the Arboretum. The area is very quaint and quiet and was a nice change from staying Downtown.

There were 4 of us who stayed there and it was a perfect size to house us all. Erin was great in communicating with me from the get go. The place was filled to the brim with creature comforts including coffee, oatmeal, books (big props for having Middlesex and Song of Soloman), games and cookware to use. Also the place was freakin' adorable. It was both modern and chic and overall super unique.  Erin made checking in easy and even lent me a hair dryer to use during my stay.  Overall we had a great stay and I'd highly recommend it. 

A few tips for any future stayers: 
- Uber is the best way to get to and fro. Trips averaged about $9 to most places Downtown. But do make sure they take Madison. GPS will try to throw you on the highway but that'll add extra cost for no reason. 
- Make sure to visit Belle Epicurean. Amazing pastries. 
- May not be the best place to stay if you're above 6 foot. The roof is a little on the shorter size. But my 5' 5"" self found it absolutely perfect. "
2367298,19317746,2014-09-10,6481485,Kandyss,"My friends and I had a great time at Erin & Nat's apartment. Although, unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to say hello or goodbye they were readily available to answer questions that we had. From the moment we arrived we had everything we needed- linens, towels and even some stumptown coffee. The apartment was located in a perfect location, seeing as we were not too familiar with Seattle, it being our first visit, it was easy to get from the apartment to other areas such as downtown, and in Ballard and Capitol Hill. Erin and Nat also included maps and guidebooks to help us plan our itinerary. It was very cosy and welcoming and enough space for the four of us. Very cute apartment."
2367298,19448790,2014-09-12,3764548,Lori,"Although I did not meet the host, the apartment was a great deal. It's large on a quiet, quaint street and even had board games. I would definitely stay again! Thanks!"
2367298,19612931,2014-09-15,512826,Peter,"We had a lovely stay at Erin and Nat's place. The neighborhood is (email hidden)e botanical gardens and park are just a couple of blocks away and are huge and beautiful...wonderful bakery and coffee (actually several places) just down the street...fantastic sushi another block or two from (email hidden)d several other places worth exploring. Parking is easy if you have a car, and bus routes are close at hand. Capital Hill is an uphill walk but very manageable, with the waterfront area down and over the hill from there. 

The apartment is nicely appointed, clean, comfortable, and pleasant. Erin and Nat were friendly and thorough with all communications and had the apartment in great shape for our stay. We would happily stay here again. "
2367298,19739595,2014-09-17,2439262,Jeremy,"We had a great time in Seattle, and your place was perfect for us. It was clean and close to lots of great places to go. Thanks for having us! You made our first experience a great one."
2367298,20090048,2014-09-23,18928220,Erica,"Adorable as advertised! Easy to find, welcoming, located in a nice quiet neighborhood, perfect for a low-key trip to Seattle. The view out the front door of a massive hill and giant tree couldn't be more different from my typical view here at home and it helped add to the magical experience of this stay. Thanks guys!"
2367298,20319013,2014-09-27,1872450,Luren,"We had an awesome stay at this place. Such a cute spot so close to the park and convenient to downtown and everywhere.  Also, very good communication and quick last-minute accommodation.  Loved it!  thanks!"
2367298,20425640,2014-09-29,18319218,Ashley,"Our experience at Erin & Nat's rental was fantastic! An adorable little basement unit that was surprisingly full of light. The kitchen is adorable, and we really liked the personal touches like fresh coffee, oatmeal and creamer left for us. The apartment is walking distance to great food, shopping, and being able to walk to the wedding we were attending for the weekend was exactly what we'd hoped for. I'd definitely rent the unit again the next time I come to Seattle. "
2367298,20762699,2014-10-05,3532626,Linda,"This place was in a great location, close to a lot of shops and restaurants! The parking was easy and neighborhood was very peaceful."
2367298,21229672,2014-10-13,10232141,Dieter,Nice cozy apartment in quiet neighborhood. Great location to explore Seattle if not wanting downtown. Recommended.
2367298,21584739,2014-10-20,20287106,Ally,"We had an absolutely lovely stay at Erin & Nat's awesome little apartment. We quickly familiarized ourself with the area and enjoyed all the offerings close to home. Plus, the location was convenient for both bus travel and using Uber to travel outside of the Capitol Hill/Madison neighborhoods. The house was cozy and suited our needs just perfectly. "
2367298,21740914,2014-10-23,19659175,Kris,"This was the perfect place to stay in Seattle. It was very close to everything that we wanted to see, and it was very clean, inviting, and cozy. We were provided with treats and helpful maps of the city and other things to do. There were four people traveling in our group and it was more than enough room. It was a fun and relaxing place to stay and we would definitely recommend it out of town or out of state visitors! "
2367298,21979751,2014-10-27,5624963,Joah,"Erin & Nat's place was great for a couple. The bed was comfortable, the place was spacious and clean and the shower was hot. Parking was very easy and the location is easy to get to and close to Cortona Cafe a cool local coffee shop. Would definitely stay here again."

2367298,22675816,2014-11-11,23159811,Jana,"Excellent, prompt communication from the host. A very cute apartment, quiet location in a nice neighborhood. We were able to park right outside the door every time -- a big deal in Seattle! We didn't cook, but the kitchen was very well stocked with pans, knives, etc. Instant oatmeal, tea, and coffee, too! I would stay again in a heartbeat, but my 6' husband felt a little claustrophobic beyond the kitchen, where the ceilings were 6.5 to 7'."
2367298,22802977,2014-11-15,7365283,Jay,"As soon as i walked in, I knew I was comfortable staying in here for 2 nights. The AirBNB as the "" Home away from home"" feel. loved it

would stay again!!"
2367298,22965595,2014-11-18,10523711,So-Mai,"The place was great and matched the online description. We loved the neighborhood, lots of walkable places to eat and we found some killer Ethiopian food within a 5 minute drive. Parking was easy. We would stay again next time we visit!"
2367298,23501563,2014-12-02,252766,Allegra,"Erin and Nat's place in Capital Hill was just as the pictures suggested. Very nicely decorated, maps of the city, everything you need to cook meals and a lovely gas fire place that kept us cosy. The location is great with lots of food choices around! Nat and Erin were easy to reach and quick to respond to messages. Our only complaint was that the pull out couch could use an update. If you have a back back, its not for you. Overall we had a great time gathering in their lovely suite. Thank you!"

2367298,25265359,2015-01-11,16603702,Angel,The house is clean and comfortable. It is easy to walk to the bus stations. 
2367298,25448413,2015-01-16,5178907,Claire,"Erin and Nat did a wonderful job to make us feel comfortable in their home. The place was spacious, adorable, and comfortable. Being Portlanders, we were happy to see the Stumptown coffee they had for us on arrival. Their place is just a few blocks from the arboretum as well as lots of cute shops and restaurants. We had so much fun staying here!"
2367298,25616761,2015-01-20,17838468,Heidi,Although we did not see Erin and Nat the apartment was nicely prepared for us.  Adorable Walk was everything it said it was and more.  The location is in a very safe and clean neighborhood which was very quiet and most beautiful.  Our stay was very restful and access to our outings were made easy.  :)
2367298,25867724,2015-01-27,25014971,Masato,"We stayed here three days. Erin & Nat were friendly owners. The suite was lovely. Location-wise, it's great place, quiet environment but easy to access to the Downtown. The neighborhood botanical garden was great for running and the nearby cafe called ""FLORA"" was fantastic! Sushi retaurant Masashi's 10-15 min drive from there was the best in North America so far.  "
2367298,25939277,2015-01-30,1752229,Talaina,Erin and Nat made planning a very easy and seamless process. The place was cozy and clean and had everything we needed. We didn't have a chance to meet them in person but truly enjoyed the beautiful neighborhood and its proximity to the arboretum.  Thanks for sharing your lovely home with us.
2367298,26374424,2015-02-10,15106416,Kevin,"The apartment was very nice, just like the pictures. We had a great time staying there! This is one of the best Airbnb experiences I have had. "
2367298,26704287,2015-02-17,27023353,Jean,"I visited Seattle for the first time during my birthday weekend and fell in love with Erin and Nat's apartment! I was with my boyfriend and two friends and had a great time exploring the cute neighborhood surrounding the apartment. Great restaurants (you must dine at Voila!) and close to bus stops. We rented a car through Relay Rides and had an easy time with street parking. 

The apartment itself was so tidy and just as charming as the pictures make it look. Upon entering the kitchen we saw coffee and snacks awaiting us and nice amount of kitchen supplies to use. There were also some guide books about Seattle and we used one to pick a hiking trail at Wallace Falls. To our surprise there were even some board games so we got to challenge each other to some Boggle and Scrabble. The bathroom had an awesome bathtub shower (love the beard curtain!) and clean towels for us to use. As a group of four the apartment was a really comfortable size for us!

We unfortunately weren't able to meet Erin and Nat but the check in and check out process was smooth. Also, I accidentally left some belongings and Erin was so kind about finding them and mailing them back to me! I definitely lucked out with such gracious hosts! Overall we had a great stay in our cozy home for the weekend. "
2367298,28517244,2015-03-25,16772749,Brenda,"This was a wonderful location for us.  Walk-able to family we were visiting and very close to a charming commercial area.  We highly recommend the location!!!  Apartment is clean, spacious and quiet.  Decorating is eclectic.  We would definitely stay again."
2367298,28724156,2015-03-29,28506068,Zoe,"This apartment is unique and adorable. It's located in a really beautiful neighborhood - a five minute walk gets you to some exceptional dining (Cafe Flora is both amazing and right around the corner), and about 20 minutes gets you to the heart of the Capitol Hill area. Public transit is also really easily accessed. Erin was great and really prompt about making sure that we had everything we needed. Overall we had a lovely stay and it was the perfect home base for seeing the city. "
2367298,29909496,2015-04-14,26530533,Kirsten,"We loved staying here!  The space worked perfectly for our family of four.  It is in a lovely, quiet little neighborhood close to shops and the arboretum.  We did not spend a lot of time indoors, as we were out visiting with friends and exploring the city, but it was a treat to come back here after a busy day!  Erin and Nat were quick to respond when we had questions before our trip.  They were very accommodating!  We hope to visit Seattle again soon, and when we come back, we hope we can stay here!    "
2367298,30308092,2015-04-20,29224580,Anthony,"Adorable little apartment in a very walkable part of Seattle. The unit is much larger than both my girlfriend and I expected. Plenty of little amenities around the apartment. 

The vintage theme is present throughout and plays along well. Erin and Nat were incredibly accommodating and super helpful throughout our stay. 

We loved the area so much we ended up looking at housing prices. Can't go wrong with staying here."
2367298,30573220,2015-04-24,30857465,Brian,Cute place with courteous hosts. The soft bed was pretty welcome after our first night's hotel bed. Go to the essential bakery about 3 blocks away for an amazing breakfast sandwich. A good choice for a Seattle get away.
2367298,30784801,2015-04-27,21642291,Tiffany,"This was an adorable little basement apartment. The first bedroom has a full bed and the second one has a pull out couch. It was clean and comfortable. The decorations were cute as well and we used the chaise for chatting over some coffee that Erin and Nat provided. They had some snacks and tea and coffee, which we found extremely useful for our walks and to get us going. The neighborhood is peaceful, safe and hilly, but the hills provide spectacular views. I would mention that the shower is quite adorable, but a tad short for anyone over 5'8"", but definitely a full size tub for baths. The place is within walking distance of the arboretum and cute restaurants and coffee shops and close to a few bus stops to head downtown."
2367298,31480937,2015-05-05,6949781,Elana,"Erin and Nat's apartment is a fabulous to stay for a visit to Seattle. It is cozy and comfortable and quite a lot of space. Erin and Nat were very quick to respond to any questions and to assist as needed, they have a nice write up of things that are nearby and ideas to make your visit a bit easier. "
2367298,31909625,2015-05-11,30075933,Debbie,"The vintage apartment was just as quaint as the pictures.  The apt. was very comfortable, clean and convenient for our weekend stay.  It's a short walk to the arboretum and to Madison cafes.  Our hosts Erin and Nat provided helpful transportation tips beforehand.  The key exchange was just as planned.  Thumbs up for this apt. if you are visiting the Capital Hill area."
2367298,32208049,2015-05-15,16354575,Chloe,"We had such a great time at Erin & Nat's place. I was in Seattle for work and my boyfriend tagged along. The location was wonderful. A beautiful residential neighborhood just blocks from one of the most beautiful urban parks I've ever seen. Great food within walking distance, and the apartment was very cozy and comfortable. We will definitely stay here again!"
2367298,32907858,2015-05-23,19938599,Esther,"Erin & Nat were wonderful hosts and their apartment was a perfect home away from home! Prior to the trip, I contacted Erin & Nat on many occasions to ask questions and prepare for the trip. They always responded in a timely manner so I could plan my trip accordingly. The apartment itself was in a great location with easy access to public transportation. Inside the apartment was a lovely kitchen with everything you could possible need to enjoy a quick breakfast before you went out to explore the city. At night, my friends and I played some board games from the bookshelf in the middle of the hall and read some books to sleep. I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay in Seattle and I would definitely come back to stay with them!  "
2367298,33206425,2015-05-25,33944918,Stephen,"On late arrival, we have nothing but an amazing time staying here. The perfect retreat in a lovely location that's within walking distance of wonderful food and coffee. Very clean, comfortable and with a friendly host. Highly recommended. We would stay here again and probably will."
2367298,33409487,2015-05-27,30436566,Yuxuan,The house is very clean and adorable. We enjoyed our stay. The neighborhood is quiet. A bunch of free parkings on Roy Street. Easy access to almost everything.
2367298,33630276,2015-05-30,14023461,Vickie,"We had a lovely stay in Erin and Nat's basement suite.  The communication was super quick and prompt!  The place was in a nice and quiet neighbourhood, would definitely recommend this place!"
2367298,33806581,2015-06-01,31538618,Timo,"Sehr gute Gegend, toller Park gleich um die Ecke, der zu Spaziergängen einlädt. Unterkunft war soweit in Ordnung, hatten ein kleines Problem, dass Handtücher fehlten, aber Erin hat umgehend reagiert und auch noch eine Flasche Wein spendiert, toll!"
2367298,34548586,2015-06-09,31186787,Remi,"Erin and Nat's apartment truly lives up to its name - adorable vintage. There is a happy feeling in the kitchen with the vintage cook stove and the magnificent ""wood burning"" electric stove. The big bed was very comfortable. We used the comfy sofas in the back room for reading and study. We especially enjoyed the quiet, garden-filled neighbourhood. Easy walk to excellent restaurants for breakfast or dinner as well as longer but very manageable walks to the beautiful Arboretum and Japanese Garden. Also easy access to buses to reach downtown or the Seattle Center. Erin and Nat were friendly and responsive to our requests but never intrusive."
2367298,34822961,2015-06-12,1758037,Anna & Luke,"Erin and Nat were awesome hosts. Timely communication,  easy checking in/out process. The house was cute, comfortable, and welcoming. The location was great. We had an unfortunate event where our backpack was stolen while out downtown and the house key was stolen with the backpack. We came back to the house late at night, Nat was readily available and  extremely understanding. They really helped ease our stressful night. Overall, we had a fun time in Seattle and our stay here only added to the good times. I would highly recommend this cute place and would definitely stay with Nat and Erin again. "
2367298,35203443,2015-06-16,5035850,Aaron,Eric and Nat were great hosts.  The apartment was perfect and in a better location than we could have imagined.  We went on walks everyday through the beautiful arboretum and parks around the area.
2367298,35394673,2015-06-18,1886519,Jared,"This was my second time staying at Erin & Nat's place, and simply put, it's perfect. It's located in a wonderful neighborhood with lots to do. The spot itself is clean and loaded with all of the essentials. Comfortable bed. Great decor. I would highly recommend this spot to anyone traveling to the area and I will most definitely stay again in the future. "
2367298,35575315,2015-06-20,3941935,Mike,"Staying at Erin & Nat's cute apartment was great. The space is perfect for 1-2 people. Checking in and out was easy. Wifi was fast. Everything was very clean. And the location was a short walk from great restaurants. The only thing to be aware of is that the walls are thin, so you can hear everything in the unit above. Early morning smoothie making woke us, so pack ear plugs if you're a light sleeper. "
2367298,36154719,2015-06-25,18058911,Lindsey,"This apartment was wonderful!  Super cute, clean, and a great location.  I chatted with Erin for a few minutes; she was super friendly and great energy.  Definitely recommend it."
2367298,36385955,2015-06-28,31880561,Precious,"My friends and I were in town for a conference and we really liked how we were very close to the convention center and tourists spots in Seattle!  Erin and Nat definitely responded to all of our questions quickly, and check in/out was easy.  Definitely recommend this great and truly adorable space!"
2367298,36731567,2015-06-30,4441463,Mike,"We had a great time at Erin & Nat's place! It was quite hot when we visited, and we managed to keep the place cool with just a box fan and some open windows. It's in a hilly residential area and was just a short walk to Madison street, which has various places to eat, drink and be merry, but also access to several buses that will whisk you away to higher density areas. The best part for us was that it's about 5 minutes away from the arboretum and Marsh Island, which we thoroughly enjoyed walking through."
2367298,37656046,2015-07-09,33219064,Angelique,"Erin & Nat's place was great! Very walkable, lots of sunlight, and everything we needed for a great trip! Capitol Hill was a great neighborhood to stay in."
2367298,38113831,2015-07-13,11272590,Kiki,"Erin and Nat's (indeed adorable) place was perfect for our stay! They were extremely gracious hosts, gave us some great suggestions for our stay in Seattle, and were very welcoming and accommodating. The apartment has two bedrooms (one is a pull out couch bed) and it was more than enough room for the four of us (my husband, myself and our two friends) to all stay together comfortably. It's is in a beautiful neighborhood walking distance to the beautiful arboretum and many shops/restaurants/cafes (we tried several during our stay!) It's also about a 10-15 min drive from everything you could possibly want to eat/see/do in downtown Seattle. We had a great stay and a wonderful time exploring Seattle with our friends! "
2367298,38544983,2015-07-16,21373332,Melisa,"Stay was fabulous. Front of the apartment is light and airy with kitchen and bedroom. Down the hall, bedroom is quiet and dark (perfect for my teenage girls to sleep). 
Area is also quiet. Minimal traffic, but just two short blocks around the corner are plenty of eating choices, shopping choices, and bus stops that will take you either direction in Seattle. Great place. Would stay again. "
2367298,38945416,2015-07-19,20398203,Jie,Erin & Nat are friendly to us. And they are young and warmly . Thank them.
2367298,39223908,2015-07-21,35419758,Shaye,"We had a great time - cute, well-organized and conveniently located.  It was a great spot for our little family."
2367298,39457259,2015-07-23,38870869,Samuel,"Very pleasant stay in a lovely, leafy part of Seattle."
2367298,39913379,2015-07-27,30770750,Courtney,"Had a fun, relaxing and VERY comfortable 3 night stay! Great beds and functional space. A great space for two couples, bright, airey and with a funky kitchen! We loved the bathroom (especially the shower- vintage style tub). We really appreciated the little touches such as the coffee, tea and granola bars & snacks left for us, thank you very much! 

Neighbourhood is beautiful, safe and quiet. A very nice peaceful stay and area outside of the busy downtown Seattle core. Roughly a $12 cab to central downtown (Pike market) which was just perfect for us. Plus there is a bus stop ( catch the #11) that runs every 30 minutes and leads you right into the downtown core! 

We enjoyed the botique restaurants a couple of blocks away (especially the bakery which has a FABULOUS breakfast!). 

Thank you for the lovely stay Erin & Nat. "
2367298,41940760,2015-08-10,8095302,Jessica,"The hosts were very easy to communicate with and the apartment was just as described.  We enjoyed staying in this neighborhood.  It is very peaceful and only two blocks from the shops and good restaurants on Madison.  It is also very near the Arboretum, which is great for running and walking.  "
2367298,42317930,2015-08-12,26539218,Kyna,"They gave good detailed information about the location.  Great communication. Easy to work with.  Cute place in a nice neighborhood.  Lots of hills.  When something went wrong, they attended to the problem right away and it was sweet of them to give us a bottle of wine due to possible inconvenience.  I would stay there again. "
2367298,42686150,2015-08-15,32632735,Kristen,"We had a wonderful time on our trip! The neighborhood was beautiful, and our host was incredibly helpful and hospitable. There were several restaurants within walking distance and it was only a short cab/uber to downtown. "
2367298,43069288,2015-08-17,12406060,Mackenzie,"Adorable place! The location was pretty central, and the neighborhood was very quaint. Erin & Nat also left out coffee, tea, and a very thorough welcome guide. Definitely would recommend! "
2367298,43399153,2015-08-19,12554748,Emily,"They were great hosts, though we never saw them. It was clean, easy and everything we needed was there. The kids had lots to play with, but nothing too precious they could destroy it. Good day light and a cute dutch door in the kitchen made it a lovely place to hang out. Good location! THANKS!!"
2367298,44805573,2015-08-29,10569329,Laurie,"This flat is amazing, it is quiet and in a wonderful location! We will be returning often! "

2367298,47085401,2015-09-15,6617255,Thomas,"We had a great stay at Erin & Nat's apartment. The apartment was cozy and comfy for the four of us. The neighborhood is quiet, beautiful, and walkable (be ready for hills) and has an awesome arboretum very close by. The vintage stove, while it really ties the room together, was somehow also a lot of fun to use. There is very easy access to downtown via bus 11 on Madison St., and Uber/Lyft drivers were typically available within 5 minutes. This apartment made for a very comfortable and convenient stay in Seattle. Thanks, Erin & Nat!"
2367298,47937104,2015-09-21,6747048,Crystal,This is truly an adorable and extremely clean and comfortable space. The bed is divine & I loved the clawfoot tub. Very convenient for walking to restaurants and in a great location for driving anywhere we needed to go. I would love to stay here again the next time I visit Seattle. Thanks Erin & Nat!
2367298,48443022,2015-09-26,8387187,Brittany,"Erin and Nat's apartment was perfect for our 5-day stay. We couldn't have asked for a better location. We walked to Fuel Coffee every morning through their beautiful neighborhood, canoed on the Arboretum which was close by, and had access to all the best restaurants and parks close to Capitol Hill. Their apartment was cozy, clean, and had everything we needed for our stay. It was fully stocked with toiletries and dishware and aesthetically pleasing - the master bed was super comfortable. A must stay if you're looking to take it easy and really enjoy Seattle. "
2367298,48806239,2015-09-28,44461374,Thomas,"Great location for anyone looking for easy access to UW, Madison Park or Capital Hill.  Warm comfortable bed and a good shower."

2367298,50284653,2015-10-11,13201637,Kathryn,We really enjoyed our stay.  The neighborhood is absolutely beautiful and very close to Capitol Hill.  We walked to dinner our last night which was great.  Would recommend!
2367298,50641883,2015-10-13,39963777,Kayla,Great location. Cute apartment.
2367298,51516211,2015-10-20,46803224,Christopher,We ABSOLUTELY enjoyed our stay! A cute apartment at a great location with friendly and accommodating hosts - what more could you ask for ?! 
2367298,52915479,2015-11-02,20670459,Michaela,"Thank you, Erin and Nat, for sharing your beautiful apartment with us. We loved the neighborhood and appreciated your recommendations for delivery food. The apartment was clean. We enjoyed the beautiful vintage touches. "
2367298,53306512,2015-11-07,4134128,Nicole,"Super cute apartment >> GREAT location, easy & free parking, comfy bed, warm fireplace... it was perfect for our short stay in Seattle! You'll be seeing me again when I'm back in the Spring! xo"
2367298,54217756,2015-11-16,6854214,Nick,"Its in madison valley which is a steep walk to capital hill, has a neighborhood residential feel.  The place looks exactly how it is listed definitely big enough to accommodate people, although there was no TV (they do say NO tv but I just didn't realize this til i got there, but honestly the only thing I would have used it for is watching football while my g/f was getting ready, we never really were at the apt for too long). I never met Erin & Nat that can be a positive or negative for different people - they certainly leave you alone and you never hear them, I on the other hand would like to meet the people that i am staying in their house only because i am a newbie on airbnb and just felt compelled to meet them haha. 

I tended to use Lyft and Uber to head around to the different areas, you can definitely use the bus, but i was only there a short weekend and it rained so didnt feel like dealing with that.  Every main area was a 10-15min drive away that we went to and we also explored Madison Valley.  

Provided shower towels, some great lotion, and an umbrella which was helpful.

One thing to keep in mind is the shower (which has a cute beard shower curtain) is for anyone who is lets say 6'0 and below.  I am about 5'7 and i was almost hitting the ceiling, as its a finished basement so it does  not necessarily have the highest ceiling.  

If you are visiting Seattle and have a car this place is definitely nice and a pleasant stay.  I wanted to walk as much as possible so the combination of the rain plus being in a valley was less than ideal for walking.  

Erin and Nat were VERY easy to get in touch with and communicate so that was certainly a plus on all fronts

"
2367298,55440635,2015-12-01,28525257,Sarah,The apartment is adorable! It has everything I asked for and the neighborhood felt really safe. I enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay here again if I visit Seattle again!
2367298,56575442,2015-12-14,837703,Ken,Erin's place is wonderful and cozy! Love the layout where it's got this living room with a nice sofa for chat and chill! 
7823973,50348036,2015-10-11,37468814,Bas,"Julia's place is located in a beautiful area of Seattle (east side of the vibrant Capitol Hill). The apartment with view on the lovely house garden was very clean and nicely decorated. Everything needed for a great stay was supplied for by Julia including detailed info on the neighbourhoods hot spots and public transport. The walk to downtown is not long and takes you along good shops, restaurants and coffee cafes. I highly recommend it!"
7823973,52227719,2015-10-27,27591605,Kimberly,"The apartment was perfect for us! It is private and the perfect size for a stay of several days.  It is in the wonderful Capitol Hill neighborhood, in easy walking distance of restaurants and coffee shops, bars,  and beautiful parks.  We walked downtown one day-it was only a couple of miles and great if you want to take the scenic route and stop along the way.  It is convenient to several bus stops depending on where you are headed, and the bus system is reliable and easy.  The apartment is well stocked with staples in terms of coffee (a must), shampoo, etc. to make your stay easier. We also appreciated the washer and dryer. "
7823973,52503341,2015-10-30,45070772,Debbie,"What a pleasure. This is a perfect location (there is a great coffee shop down the road, Queen Bee...crumpets and Java) as well as everything else you will need. The home feels like a home, super comfortable bed and cotton linens, it's immaculate, the washer and dryer was so helpful, and the shower was great! What else could you ask for!!! Julia has a water feature outside the entry that transposed us into a state of Zen. I would like to be back there now, but still traveling PCHSouth. Oh...did I mention she left coffee? Yes there was fresh coffee beans, a grinder and coffee to boot! Loved this stay, just loved it. "
7823973,53057079,2015-11-04,21732606,Becca,"We had a great time staying in Julia's apartment on the last leg of our Pacific Northwest holiday. It was easy to find and access, with convenient street parking outside. The kitchen had everything you could need including a decent coffee maker. The bed was comfy and we found the living room to be a perfect place to relax after a hard day sightseeing. There is even a nice bar at the end of the street and lots to do on both 15th and 19th Avenues. All in all a great find in the Capitol Hill area. "
7823973,53576419,2015-11-09,43278883,Hector,"Very clean and extremely comfortable place to stay! It's a ver spacious 1 bedroom apartment with an amazing garden to get lost in as well. Natural light pours in at all times with lots of windows on all sides. Julia was extremely respectful at all times and is extremely nice! Area is close to some great restaurants and coffee houses, downtown is 10 minutes away, ideal location all around! We would definitely stay here again! A+"
7823973,53771031,2015-11-12,47290610,Andrew,"Julia was very nice and made us feel welcome. The apartment was very comfortable and had every amenity we possibly needed. The neighborhood was very quiet and beautiful, great location. I wouldn't mind living in a place like this. "
7823973,54523465,2015-11-21,11525808,Adrianna,Had a great visit to Seattle staying at Julia's cottage. Comfy and had everything we needed. Appreciated the non toxic detergent and dish soap and the emphasis on recycling and compost. Great place for rest and recuperation. Garden and neighborhood was beautiful. 
7533537,50579568,2015-10-12,45018114,Sarah,"Janet was amazing. She was extremely accommodating and had prepared a helpful little guide for us about all the amenities in West Seattle (a very hip little neighborhood close to Downtown Seattle.) Her studio was exactly as described and very cozy (ladies, the fancy shampoo/conditioner and hair dryer/flat iron/curling iron selection was a definite plus.) Janet even took our coffee bean order to make sure she had the type on hand that we liked (we requested a local coffee and she delivered, it was delicious!) The location was great, only a 15 minute-ish car ride from Downtown Seattle and really close to the water if a morning shore-side walk is your thing. Upon Janet's request, before leaving for the airport on our last morning, we had breakfast at a record store that doubles as a diner called Easy Street Records, about a 3 minute drive from her place. Definitely would recommend for any audiophiles visiting the area, we picked up an album from an Oregon band we love that we've never seen anywhere else. It was Sunday morning and there was also an incredible looking farmers market, great people watching and there's lots of other nice restaurants in the area if diner food isn't your thing. 

Next time I visit Seattle, I won't need to look any further for awesome accommodations. Thanks Janet!!"
7533537,51491599,2015-10-20,19873556,Vicki,We felt very welcome.  Janet and her daughter helped us carry our things to the studio.  The accommodations were clean and comfortable.  Fun to have a fireplace in the room.  The location is very quiet.  Only suggestion - coffee mugs and plastic glasses for the bathroom.  
7533537,53769839,2015-11-12,44955007,Susada,"We stayed at Janet's for 5 days, and while we did not get a chance to interact much, the whole family was very warm and inviting. She gave us a great list of places to visit and eat at, each and every one of them were a grand slam, especially Easy Street Records. The guest house was very comfortable and stylish with retro cameras adorning all the shelves. It had every comfort you could ask for and a few luxuries to boot, it was truly perfect. We had no rouble traveling with the 22 bus right at the top of the hill and the C line at the bottom. While admittedly this is only our second stay at an air bnb, Janet and her family have gone above and beyond to make sure it will not be our last."
7533537,54160838,2015-11-16,47498328,Shayna,"Janet was great, the place was perfect. Very nice and clean, and the bed was FABULOUS. Very comfortable. I rented a car and there was ample street parking. Beautiful view of the water from her street. Would love to stay here again when visiting Seattle in the future. "
7533537,54750770,2015-11-23,12128757,Christopher,"Janet was a fantastic host! She was so accommodating and helpful with everything. The space was no different. It was clean, the bed was incredibly comfortable and was well represented by the photos. One of our bestAirbnb experiences and we've had a few."
7533537,55922830,2015-12-07,19873556,Vicki,"The apartment looks just like the photo.  It's nice to have the electric fireplace on a gray, wet Seattle day.  We greeted with a visit by Noche (their very cute dog)."
7533537,56395397,2015-12-13,8957205,Marinca,"This beautiful garden studio was even lovelier to stay in than the pictures suggested. Janet's instructions allowed me to get inside in the warm from the rain in no time. In the evening on my day of arrival, she offered me fresh milk and butter, which I was very happy to avail myself of. The view from the street is absolutely stunning, and I soon found my way to Lincoln Park to stroll along the gorgeous outlook over Puget Sound. The studio itself was spotless, with a lovely decor, very handy full kitchen, and comfortable bed. Even during a thunderstorm it felt homey and safe. It was a delightful base from which to explore West Seattle, can't recommend it enough!"
7533537,56984980,2015-12-20,12128757,Christopher,This was our second time staying with Janet and we'll be back again! She is a fantastic host and the space is awesome!
7533537,57368793,2015-12-25,47053313,Thomas,"
This was our lst Airbnb experience and we enjoyed it very much.
This separate guest apt. worked perfectly for our visit and everything was as advertised.  Janet made us feel very welcome and had helpful
information on nearby restaurants, etc.    
The apt. is bright and light and quiet and well equipped.  
 "
4738971,23980331,2014-12-15,8737098,Mary,"My husband and I would definitely recommend this apartment. Carrie made us feel right at home and was a great host.  We were in Seattle area to visit our daughter & this was a perfect fit for us. We loved the space and it was just as she described with accurate images, a real treat.  The apartment was very cute with lots of artwork, full kitchen, very  comfortable queen sized bed and great bathroom.  Travel books, yoghurt etc. for breakfast, fluffy towels and loved the cat, Sofia (and her beautiful urban chickens!) were included!

Fremont is a really fun and interesting place to hang out with great restaurants right down the hill and at least four coffee places to choose from. There is plenty of street parking and an easy location just a 10 minute walk to downtown Fremont and an quick and easy drive to Ballard, Seattle etc.  We also took the bus to Seattle.  Carrie guided us to the bus stop which was pretty close and no stress.  Wish we could have stayed longer.  We will be back."
4738971,24614397,2014-12-31,15133066,Anastacia,"Great little place in a fantastic location. If you are visiting and want to be away from the crazy of downtown but still have easy access to everything? This place is perfect. Wonderful quiet neighborhood too. 

Looks just like it does it the pictures too. No surprises. Be aware that there are cats around, and really cute chickens too so be mindful if you bring dogs.

Great hassle free stay. Keeping it on the list of places to use again when in town! "
4738971,27695240,2015-03-09,21007690,Justyn & Gabi,"Carrie is a wonderful host. Everything is just as pictured. Great neighborhood; located on a quiet street, with a short walk to trendy Fremont area (great food, bars, and organic market). We had our car and the drive to downtown Seattle took 10 minutes (we can't comment on the public transport). Nothing but a lovely time to be had. We had our dog with us and had no problems with the cats or chickens either. Definitely recommend and would love to stay again. Thanks for everything, Carrie!"
4738971,28823169,2015-03-30,8737098,Mary,This is our second time staying here.   Clean and comfortable and a great location in Fremont and convenient to Seattle.   Great host!
4738971,29986135,2015-04-15,13316614,Dana,"Carrie was great! Super friendly, and punctual. Photos and descriptions are accurate. Great location. Easy parking. So convenient to have access to the washer/dryer. One of my favorite places to stay in Seattle. Thanks!"
4738971,33300390,2015-05-26,18158024,Samantha,"Carrie has an adorable little apartment in the fantastic Fremont neighborhood. It was great to return to Carrie's quiet, private home after spending a busy day exploring the city. Communicating with Carrie was very easy and she was kind enough to accommodate our schedule. "
4738971,35150378,2015-06-15,9160151,Laura,My husband and I stayed at Carries place for a quick weekend getaway. She was punctual with her reply and all of the details went smoothly. We especially loved the special touch of the farm fresh eggs and the travel books in her place. We will definitely be back if we travel to Seattle again!! 
4738971,36011109,2015-06-24,31133233,Paula,Not a good experience.
4738971,38111975,2015-07-13,8657487,Jacqueline & Mike,"Great location on a quiet street in Fremont! Nice kitchen and living space made it easy to spend time in the apartment without feeling cramped. Clean and bright for a garden unit. Really great outside space as well - back garden/porch area were very cute! Sadly, we didn't get to see any of the cats...

Carrie was responsive and easy to arrange arrival/departure with. Would definitely stay here again!"
4738971,38639524,2015-07-17,12220996,Pierre-Francois,"Very quiet and pretty neighbourhood, within reasonable distance to the city (10 minute drive, 20 minute bus ride). The apartment looked exactly like in the pictures - fairly small but still nice. Carrie was very easy to get in touch with.

Overall great place to stay.
"
4738971,41942381,2015-08-10,32259767,Robert,"The stay was great!  Comfy bed and a cozy living room.  The neighborhood is very relaxed, it was an ideal home base for my week."
4738971,42570879,2015-08-14,646729,Andy,"Nice place and fun location. That said, a little disappointed at the lack of fresh eggs, since the title is ""fresh eggs in Fremont"". Also, I know that cats were mentioned as ""being around"" but I would have liked to know that they spend time in the apartment, as the place has a pretty distinct cat smell. Neither of those two things were deal breakers, but would be good to know for fairness in decision to book the place. "
4738971,43395171,2015-08-19,12544512,Elaine,"The space was perfect for my purposes, which was mainly for sleeping and having a bite of breakfast each morning. There was no bureau or chest of drawers, so my suitcase got laid out on the breakfast bar. There was plenty of dishes and utensils, and it was easy to make breakfast each morning, once I finally made it to the nearby Fred Meyer store. The bed was nice and soft, and even the chilly mornings were rescued by the oversized duvet, which kept me nice and warm."
4738971,44320124,2015-08-25,16931790,Ashley,"Overall, this was a great stay. The neighborhood was quaint, gorgeous and walk-able to wonderful dining and shopping — though if you're not used to steep hills, bring your walking stick! The one time that I did meet the owner, she was friendly and helped point me to good Mexican food in the area. The only complaints we had were that we could hear the owners, who live upstairs, walking and talking until late at night because there's really no sound barrier between the two floors. Also, I read in other reviews that the washer and dryer were available for use, but when I asked to use them, Carrie was reluctant, but eventually did grant me access. Again, those are small complaints and really no reason to not book this listing. "
4738971,44994520,2015-08-30,17041615,Lucas,"Carrie's basement apartment was spacious, sunny, and comfortable. Carrie was prompt to communicate with me and access to the apartment was hassle free. We had our own entrance and plenty of privacy. I would highly recommend. Great neighborhood with cool eateries, bars, and coffee shops all around. Don't forget to visit the Fremont troll!"
4738971,47487898,2015-09-19,6913135,Sandy,Moving state to state can be a bit stressful and Carrie was so understanding and helpful. Her unit suited our needs and is in a fantastic area of Fremont. If you need to get to downtown Seattle it's about a 7 min drive and Ballard is a short drive away. Thank you so much for everything.
4738971,48243171,2015-09-24,103474,Heidi,"Carrie's place is cute, clean and cozy- the perfect place to stay if you're traveling for business OR pleasure. It's like having your own mini apartment - I definitely availed myself  of the kitchen which helped me save money on my work trip. Will stay here again!"
4738971,48801803,2015-09-28,26307964,Kim,Adorable basement apartment with an adorable chicken!  No eggs :( but had a great time in Seattle!  Easy to find and close to a lot of fun restaurants.  Loved her bathroom colors and flooring! 
4738971,50962550,2015-10-16,2394272,Michael,"My wife and I needed a pet friendly spot to get settled in before we moved into our new home in Capitol Hill. This spot was very cozy and quiet, and only about 10 minutes from downtown Fremont. The Chicken in the back added some cool characteristic. I read in the back while the chicken kept me company."
4738971,51956095,2015-10-25,14162309,Nicole,"Great stay in Fremont at Carrie's house. I didn't get to see her a lot, but she seemed really available to us if we needed anything. My mother and I stayed here, as she was helping me move back to the city. The apartment was perfect for us. It is in a great location and Carrie did a great job anticipating our needs. The apartment is on the lower level but it still gets a lot of natural light from the couple of windows (this was something I was concerned about prior, but turned out to be a non issue). Super clean and comfortable. I would absolutely recommend this spot to anyone visiting Seattle. It is also a great value for the area! "
4738971,55516184,2015-12-01,10198507,Sean,Great place to stay!  It was clean and Carrie was friendly and easy to communicate with.
4738971,56868732,2015-12-19,50140370,Ginger,"Very private suite, with easy access.  Close to lots of amenities and easy to get to downtown."
6915487,46299691,2015-09-09,16620397,Denise,"Our experience overall was very good, and I would definitely recommend this apartment. My husband, daughter and I stayed here for one week over Labor Day weekend. The friendly neighborhood was perfect for us. It is only a few blocks to Green Lake Park, and 5 or 10 minutes walking in just about any direction will get you to shops (and a grocery), great restaurants and coffee. It is all new inside and very comfortable.

Jim seemed like a caring host. We were on our own for a couple of hours after we arrived because we couldn't get in. He was on his way to L.A. when we tried to call, but as soon as Jim got our message he was very apologetic and helpful getting us in and set up. There had apparently been some confusion between him and his daughter, and she had sent us to the wrong door.

I continued to wonder if we were in the right place, though, because there was no welcome message, set of instructions, recommendations nor information about the area for us. There was, however, the realtor's welcome for new home owners (deed, description of property, etc.)

Jim said it was the first time the apartment had been rented. It is newly renovated with new floors, windows, painting and comfortable furniture. We enjoyed the comfortable living room and dining room, especially. It is sunny and spacious.

There were some other weird furnishings that may have been start-up glitches. For example, there was no microwave, dish soap nor sponge, dishcloth or dish towel. No hangers. It just didn't feel ready for us.

I think these were all start-up glitches, and they weren't major problems. I do recommend this upper Green Lake apartment for a comfortable stay in a great location. 

Oh - a note about parking: as in all of Wallingford, the smaller the car the better, because the streets have cars parked on both sides so they are essentially one-lane wide."
3231850,14794556,2014-06-26,12279099,Thomas,"The listing accurately reflected the space.  It was spacious clean and the accommodations were accurately described.  A well designed and thought out layout of the space creates a visually appealing place to stay.  The decorations were very nice with many little finishing touches to make it feel very warm, welcoming and homey.  The host will go above and beyond to make sure all of your needs are met and are just nice people :)  I would surely stay here again if needed in the area and would highly recommend this space to any young couple or individual looking for a cool space to stay in the seattle area."
3231850,14890974,2014-06-28,2838713,Katherine,"The Carriage house is wonderful! The space is larger in person and so incredibly comfortable. I didn't see either Jon while I visited Seattle, but he was in contact throughout my stay to see if I needed anything. I would happily recommend this place for anyone looking for privacy and a quiet place to relax during a visit to Seattle."
3231850,15506938,2014-07-10,12882826,Amy,"Wonderful, amazing carriage house. Everything was immaculate and just as the pictures showed it. I would highly recommend staying here -- blocks to Greenlake, coffeeshops, restaurants."
3231850,15920860,2014-07-18,4437998,Chris,"The carriage house was a beautiful place to relax and work. Jon and his wife have done a great job designing this cozy, well appointed space. You definitely need to be comfortable with climbing a galley ladder to get upstairs, but if you find that fun like we did, I would highly recommend Jon's place."
3231850,16210732,2014-07-23,1676399,Moira,"Jon & Laurie's carriage is a piece of heaven. Looks exactly like the photos but feels even cozier and more clarifying. It smells delicious, is surrounded by a neighborhood of great eats,coffee,walking in nature,canoeing...we had a truly wonderful time there. We also so enjoyed having a few visits with them - they are wonderful folks!"
3231850,16308730,2014-07-25,17347857,Julius,"We really enjoyed staying at the Green Lake Carriage House. The place was very clean and large enough for the two of us to be  comfortable. The neighborhood was nice, and even though there was no oven or stove to cook with, there were plenty of great restaurants close by. The stairs to the loft could be difficult for some as they were steep but that was no problem for us.  The bedding was really comfortable. Overall, we would recommend the Green Lake Carriage House, and would stay there again if we find ourselves back in Seattle."
3231850,16476148,2014-07-28,16820290,Chi,"My girlfriend and I had a great time staying at this carriage house.  Jon and Laurie made our stay very comfortable.   Laurie greeted when we first arrived to make sure we have everything thing we needed. The room was cleaned prior to our arrival.  All the necessities were available: bath towel, shampoo, soap, plates, coffee, etc.  

This in essence was better than staying at a hotel room.  This was like our home away from home.  This place also has heated floor in the event the evening gets cold.  We stayed at this cottage for three nights and there are plenty of parking.  We parked right in front of the cottage each time; this beats paying $$$ for hotel parking.

I want to reiterate again that Jon and Laurie were great hosts.  This was my first time using Air BnB and I had great experience.
  "
3231850,16718689,2014-08-01,16622470,Ash,The carriage house was absolutely beautiful and looked exactly like the photos. It was in a great location with many food choices within a half mile from the house that you could walk to. The hosts had a great list of recommendations and the house had everything we needed. I stayed here with my friend and the sleeping situation was perfect for us (one bed and the coach converted into a second bed). My friend and I enjoyed our stay and we will definitely be back! 
3231850,16987876,2014-08-05,16828190,Laura,"Jon and Laurie have a beautiful space in the adorable Greenlake neighborhood. The carriage house was clean, incredibly comfortable and well stocked. When we needed an iron last minute, they were more than accommodating. The neighborhood is friendly and easy to walk around in and very centrally located. We will definitely be back next time we are in the area. "
3231850,17105469,2014-08-07,8859499,Mindy,"Everything about my first airbnb experience was fantastic. Jon was very welcoming from the initial contact, to the final goodbyes. 
The Green Lake carriage house is spectacular. The look and feel was comfortable but luxurious and at a very modest price. Incredibly clean, beautifully furnished, and in a prime location. Easy to find and a short drive to downtown, the Green Lake carriage house was perfect.  Jon was very friendly and helpful, and we couldn't have asked for a better house. I can't wait to visit Seattle again, and hopefully this house will be available for us to stay at again! 
"
3231850,17281429,2014-08-10,11638056,Erin,"We really enjoyed our time at the green lake carriage house.  It was exactly as pictured. Everything was very comfortable and we felt like we had a home away from home. Jon was nice enough to allow us to drop off our luggage before checkin, because we arrived well before the checkin time. They were very accommodating. We had a lovely time! "
3231850,17455435,2014-08-12,17274124,Blair,We absolutely loved the picture perfect carriage house at Jon & Lauri's. The location was ideal with just a short jaunt to downtown Seattle. We walked to breakfast which we consider another added plus. We will definitely return! 
3231850,17764506,2014-08-17,7010414,Mary,"The carriage house was a great place to stay in Seattle. We were so at home and happy to return there after our days of exploring Seattle. Jon was good at communicating with us before our trip and during our stay. Both he and Laurie checked in with us to see how we were doing and if we needed anything while there. The neighbourhood is quiet and has some cute shops and restaurants. The park a few blocks away is great too. The space is so modern and clean, and we really loved the little extras they provided. We would definitely stay there again! Thanks Jon and Laurie! "
3231850,18005039,2014-08-20,6913429,Tracy,"My partner and I had such a wonderful time staying at the green lake carriage house! the space was so wonderful. very clean, well thought out, and the location was conveniently located within walking distance to many shops & stores, as well as super close to bus stops to get downtown with ease. Jon and family were wonderful hosts and had everything set up for us before we arrived, and were very helpful with questions and area suggestions. I would definitely stay here again."
3231850,18184619,2014-08-23,18428510,Melanie,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights in August and we absolutely loved it. Upon arriving, Jon and Laurie happened to be home and we were greeted with a warm and friendly welcome. Our flight came in a bit early and they were nice enough to accommodate us earlier than the check-in time. The carriage house is amazing- sleek, modern, clean, with an industrial flair, and it had everything we could ever need during our stay. Although the rental is a few steps away from their house, you still get all the privacy you want- no distractions whatsoever. The location is close to the freeway, very accessible to downtown. We had a rental car so we didn't have a problem getting where we wanted to go. The neighborhood of Green Lake is beautiful; we also made sure to visit the lake (which is only a few streets away). I would highly recommend staying here, and will consider it again when I return to Seattle! Thanks Jon and Laurie! :)"
3231850,18318885,2014-08-25,17573868,Suzan,"We enjoyed our stay.  The Carriage house is really beautifully made and  thoughtfully appointed.  Jon and Laurie were so nice, and Jon was very eager to help with any needs.  We enjoyed exploring the neighborhood (some fun homes and nice cafes, etc.) and loved Green Lake; so beautiful and so many options. It was also a fairly convenient location for Seattle/  One caveat for tall people: the shower stall would be problematic for anyone taller than say 6'1"", and tall folks need to remember to bend when passing the beam in the loft. Also, the spare bed (folding down the couch is on the firm side.)"
3231850,18537054,2014-08-28,17427002,Cameron,The green lake carriage house is a modern loft with all your vacation needs.  The furnishings are comfortable. Jon and his family are wonderful hosts. The neighborhood is close to downtown and has great shops and restaurants of its own.  Many bus routes to downtown are nearby as well.  This rental is perfect for your next trip to Seattle. 
3231850,18881204,2014-09-02,17422811,Zachariah,"The host, Jon Polaha, and his wife were amazingly nice people and definitely made me and my friends feel welcomed and at home. If there was something I had a question about, whether it was about the housing, or something in the area, he would always respond not long after I messaged him. He was also very respectful of our privacy. 

The Carriage House was also very nice, clean, and comfortable. It felt like a little home away from home. They also left a little folder in the room with some very helpful information, like their preferred cafes, restaurants, and grocery stores in the area, most of which were within walking distance, and also some fun activities that we could do in the area. There was even a neighborhood project going on at the time that they had all set up, and my friends and I were openly invited to participate and even come hang out at the block party that followed. It was pretty amazing!

Overall, Jon made our trip to Seattle very pleasant and welcoming. He is a great and friendly guy, and we would all love to come back and visit again. "
3231850,19082489,2014-09-06,19328575,Rob,"The carriage house was clean, comfortable, modern, and very well stocked with all of the ""must haves"" that nobody wants to pack but needs. From kitchen supplies to toiletries (and Apple TV!), it was the attention to detail that quickly made this house feel like home.

The location north of downtown was perfect. Close enough to get to eveything ""Seattle"" yet far enough away to escape the hustle and bustle.

We stayed for four nights and truly enjoyed every minute of our stay. Wish we could've stayed longer!"
3231850,19199405,2014-09-08,18018606,Jerry,"Jon was prompt in responding to our inquiries,  and this listing is just what we hoped for in using airbnb.  The house was clean and bright, the neighborhood walkable with things to do nearby, and only minutes from downtown.  We had a great experience! "
3231850,19411570,2014-09-12,5176388,Taeko,"We had a great time at the carriage house - very clean, fantastic design and surprisingly comfortable! Little details such as USB plugs on the wall, Apple TV and board games in the house made our experience even better. 

Location is great as it's close to I-5 but still in a quiet and lovely neighborhood. We unfortunately couldn't meet Jon in person, but he quickly to reply to all our messages and even let us arrive before our check-in time. 

We truly wish we could have stayed longer. Thanks for everything! "
3231850,19676785,2014-09-16,7057793,Katinna,My husband and I had a great time in Seattle. Jon's place is really nice. We liked the industrial/ eclectic design he did to the space. The bed is comfy.  We really liked the Little detail they left for us a happy aniversary note and chocolates. Yummy! Great people! Absolutely will stay again. Thanks Jon! ;)

Jon did an amazing job designing and building the place, it was extremely comfortable and so well thought out. Jon and Laurie were so friendly and welcoming and had a ton of recommendations for local restaurants and activities! We can't wait to go back!"

3231850,21873103,2014-10-26,10876007,Lu,"I had a great time staying at Jon's Green Lake Carriage house! The space was beautifully furnished and warm to the feel. Even the concrete floor was warm to walk on with bare feet. The space was clean and minimalistic, and the tall ceilings made the carriage house seem so big and open. The carriage house served as a great shelter from the wind storm that blasted us on our trip. It was also a great place to rest while I was weathered by a cold. I had a great time staying at the carriage house and hope to revisit again in the future. Thanks Jon for being so responsive with your suggestions and for being concerned. Hope to meet you in person in the future!"
3231850,22356664,2014-11-04,3929312,Jim,"Very comfortable space, and welcoming host, enjoyed our stay immensely! It was thoughtful of Jon to get a tea maker for the
carriage house."
3231850,22578138,2014-11-10,19477180,Justin,"This was a great experience! The carriage house was comfortable, unique and definitely In a beautiful location. John and family were kind and welcoming. The Seattle experience was exemplary and this only made it better to come back to after a long day if exploring. 

Amenities we're excellent and I couldn't have asked for a more comfortable bed! 
Thank you again!
Hope to be back soon!
"
3231850,22777189,2014-11-14,3394000,Christy,"This is a lovely pocket of residential neighborhood in Green Lake. The Carriage House is exactly as described and photographed. I'm sure that Jon has a lot of love, sweat, and tears in this little place. The craftsmanship and modern furnishings are all really nice, simple, minimal. It's a small place, good for 1 or 2 agile guests. I LOVE the radiant heated concrete floors and the keyless entry. Street parking is easy. Jon is very accessible and responsive via phone or text if you need anything. I'd stay here again with pleasure!"
3231850,22996099,2014-11-19,23593338,Cristen,"My husband and I spent two nights here. It was an AMAZING stay. We stayed in November when Seattle starts to get pretty cold, but the place was very warm. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. Altogether, this place was very warm, cozy and clean. I would stay there again in a heartbeat!"
3231850,23157400,2014-11-24,22407837,Lindsay,Amazing house and great area!  Very clean and open feel. Perfect Seattle getaway. 
3231850,23878840,2014-12-13,24247616,Brian Jennings,"Jon and his family were amazing hosts! The apartment is so well crafted and designed and is exactly what you see in the beautiful pictures...It is so cozy there with 3 walking distance restaurant areas plus a Whole foods...it was an ideal week for me. They looked after me when they thought a winter storm might cause a power outage and were proactive to make sure the floor heating system was at a temperature that suited me...such kind, considerate and caring people.  The care Jon put into creating the apartment is what you get with your stay but with plenty of privacy as well. I will definitely go back. If you're a foodie, check out Mkt. (walking distance), Delancey and the Fat Hen (both a short drive around Green Lake). Parking was easy on the street and neighborhood was super safe and had a great vibe. Thank you both for making my stay a perfect experience!"
3231850,24065533,2014-12-18,12238810,Jeremy,"Our experience at the carriage house was just wonderful! Jon and his wife were extremely accommodating and helpful. We had everything we needed - the space is gorgeous, well stocked and very comfortable. The heated floors were awesome as was the Apple TV. We would definitely stay again! Thanks Jon ! "
3231850,24945535,2015-01-04,1152509,Reuben,"Stayed here for 4 nights with my girlfriend and could not have had a better time!  The space was very clean, well designed, and quiet.  The location provides easy access to all of the neighborhoods in Seattle.  I would love to stay here again, it was a fantastic experience.  Thanks!"
3231850,25097146,2015-01-06,18429076,Lauren,"Though we didn't get to meet, Jon was a great host-- my fiance and I were late in checking in and he texted to check in with us and make sure we were getting in okay. They had a folder full of smartly-written recommendations and information, and Seattle guidebooks-- they're clearly thorough and thoughtful. The space is gorgeous-- love the radiant heating through the floors and the airy view from the loft. The ladder is a little treacherous in the dark, but if you have your wits about you you're all right. Bed is super comfy, shower is delightful. Love this space. We had hoped to do a little cooking until we realized that the place doesn't have a stove or oven (which of course aren't essentials), so be mindful of that, I guess. But we'd love to stay here again. A beautiful spot. "
3231850,25301586,2015-01-11,20402024,Nick,"Jon's well-constructed and modernist abode was the perfect locale for preparing for trial in a great neighborhood.  Close to Greenlake and Ravenna, the space was quiet, with great acoustics for playing guitar or listening to music.  It had a quite comfortable bed and very nice heated floor that kept everything nice and warm.  Jon's place is a great place to stay for a couple or a single traveler and Jon is friendly and communicative.  Highly recommended."
3231850,25627594,2015-01-21,17032384,Jeff,Our second stay at the Carriage House and it was again perfect. The accommodations are sparkling clean and well designed and the location is great. Jon even allowed our friends to put in a welcome basket before our arrival. Very nice!
3231850,26213071,2015-02-07,25547919,Manolito,Awesome modern home. Great location for food and coffee. Jon is cool who recommended plenty of places to visit.
3231850,26522271,2015-02-15,24780093,David,"Jon was very considerate and accommodating. He checked in with us and was easily accessible via phone or Airbnb messages. Check-in was very easy because they have a keypad entry. The house was very well kept and tidy; exactly as the photos portray. He has a folder of different things to do in the area, restaurants, and grocery stores that are within walking distance which was very helpful. They had an Apple TV and a small kitchenette. There is no stove but that wasn't really a problem for us. We would definitely love to stay here again if we get a chance and would recommend it to anyone visiting the area!"
3231850,26967353,2015-02-22,25606599,Nash,"We loved it! The house is beautiful and well designed. The loft was fun and there was a surprising amount of space. Parking was easy and the code to get in the house made arriving very convenient. We went to Cafe Lulu and got tasty egg bagels, walked around Green Lake, and bought a few groceries at Whole Foods. We had a nice and relaxing weekend."
3231850,27114706,2015-02-25,8059005,Nuru,"I loved Jon's Carriage house! The loft is very clean, spacious with really cool modern interior design. Jon is a great host, he was quick to respond to my msgs and questions. I would definitely love to stay here next time I visit Seattle and I would recommend this place to anyone."
3231850,27215175,2015-02-28,18578501,Julia,Thank you Jon! This was the perfect space for a short getaway. Everything was exactly as pictured and super clean. We loved the design and decor. Comfortable and relaxing it was great to come back to each night. Jon was great at communicating with us. He even suggested an amazing spa (banya 5) that we visited twice in 4 days! The Apple TV is an added bonus as well as the heated floors. Again thank you so much and we would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Seattle. 
3231850,27412859,2015-03-03,6426059,Tim,"The carriage house was a perfect place to sleep and rest after hanging out in Seattle all day.  The house was very clean and put together, making us feel comfortable and relaxed.  Thanks for the great experience!"
3231850,27522612,2015-03-06,28635828,Therese,"My host was great. Description is totally accurate. Super nice space. Immaculately kept. Very relaxing. Prime location to everything...food, downtown, surrounding cool neighborhoods, freeway, Green Lake...very central location. Well done!"
3231850,27660407,2015-03-09,2050325,Jesse,"I could not have had a better trip to Seattle, and it was in huge part to my stay at Jon's carriage house. The neighborhood is gorgeous. Tree-lined streets, the lake just blocks away, and plenty of restaurants, coffee, shops, donuts, bars, and everything in less than a 10 minute walk in any direction. It was an absolutely perfect landing spot for my 4-day trip.

The carriage house itself was impeccable. You could tell Jon poured his heart and soul into the renovation and creation of this inspiring space. Perfect decor, beautiful construction, and every amenity you'd need for a small space. The windows throughout let in a great breeze, the bathroom and shower was perfect, and WiFi was easy and fast. Apple TV and the stocked up coffee in the kitchen made for great added bonuses. The bed was super comfortable and waking up in the loft was so sunny and delightful. Even though you're on the same property as their family, it was private, easy access, and could enjoy the yard too on a nice day.

I'd HIGHLY recommend a stay here, my first trip to the PNW couldn't have been better if I tried, and the carriage house made it all the more."
3231850,28219916,2015-03-20,23442921,Liaoliao,Jon is really nice and their house is perfect for 2 person to stay! Easy to park! If i have friend come to seattle i will stay here again!
3231850,28495803,2015-03-24,13360974,Wendy,"The carriage house was awesome and exactly as pictured. New and clean and private. We did not meet Jon but felt welcome all the same. Very easy to check in. The neighborhood was great, an easy walk to restaurants and Greenlake. We would definitely stay there again!"
3231850,28789252,2015-03-30,7246772,Marcela,"Jon and family were wonderfully helpful in all our communications. The carriage house is beautiful and luminous (if you are planning to sleep in, bring your sleep mask!! ). The neighborhood is convenient and comfortable. "
3231850,29837400,2015-04-13,14018905,Justin,"Great host.  Great place.  It will be at the top of my list when I need a place in Seattle.  Everything is exactly as pictured and described, and it is a quick walk to greenlake.  Highly recommended."
3231850,30408634,2015-04-21,15974023,Ian & Elle,"Walking through the door for the first time at the Green Lake Carriage House, we saw that the space was indeed as beautiful as it is in the pictures. It was bright and airy and smelled as fresh and clean as it looked. While it is a small space, we never felt like it was too small. It is well appointed and it's obvious that a great deal of care has gone into the design and decor.  
We were in Seattle for just a few days to celebrate our anniversary. Jon, Laurie, and Calder left us a handmade ""happy anniversary"" card along with some delicious local salted caramel truffles... yum! Speaking of treats, returning from our outings and adventures to relax in such a wonderful space really helped to make our mini-vacation feel like a real treat. We felt like we could make ourselves at home here. As we prefer to be independent and fairly self-sufficient guests, it was wonderful that we didn't have to ask Jon and Laurie for anything that we needed; it was all there. 
A few more points:
-The location was perfect for us. It is within walking distance of Green Lake and several eateries. It's also a nicely walkable neighborhood. We were grateful, however, that we rented a car since there was so much more that we wanted to see and do. The location of the Carriage House was a great launching point.
-The ladder to the loft can seem a bit intimidating, but it seems to be super sturdy and we had no problems navigating it. 
-The brightness that is otherwise such a wonderful aspect can be a bit ferocious when the morning light comes pouring through the unshaded upstairs window. We dashed out to Target to buy some of those luxuriously padded eye masks. Problem solved.
-We happened to be in Seattle during and unseasonably warm week. While there is no cooling system in the space, we found that with opening the windows and using the oscillating fan to move the air around, we were able to stay mostly comfortable. 
-We loved our stay here and highly recommend it!"
3231850,31578618,2015-05-07,19295052,Jay,"John and Laurie were very warm and welcoming.  We got in late, but Jon had already forwarded instructions on the door entry (very easy), so we just settled in.  The Carriage House is just as pictured on AirBnB - deceptively roomy, yet cozy.  The kitchen is pared down but quite sufficient, since there are so many places to eat in Seattle.   The loft was beautifully done with a series of windows at both the head and foot of the bed for excellent circulation.  

It was the little things that really impressed me; I was initially concerned that I may have packed too lightly, and would regret having left a few essentials behind.  But Jon and Laurie had thought of everything - I found a hairdryer, market bag and umbrella at my disposal in the Carriage House.    

This was my first stab at AirBnB, and I would gauge it a success.  We will definitely stay at the Carriage House again when in Seattle, and recommend it to others without reservation.  
"
3231850,31849606,2015-05-10,20972109,Timarie,"We had a wonderful experience at the Green Lake Carriage House! It's notably evident how much time, effort and passion John has put into the design and functionality of the building. We were very impressed and comfortable the entire time. Super welcoming and beautiful neighbourhood. John and Laurie were also a pleasure to talk to and very accommodating with suggesting activities and places to eat/ see. Highly recommended!"
3231850,32335856,2015-05-17,28036169,Daniel,"This listing was exactly what myself and two other friends needed - a great place to crash that was affordable and close to everything we wanted to check out! Oh, and the neighborhood is beautiful which was a huge PLUS!

Jon was very accommodating and let us check in earlier than usual which worked out great!

We weren't in the carriage house much, but we enjoyed the space and it was definitely nice to come back to when we needed a break from the plethora of things to do in the area and all the rest of the city.

Whole Foods was about 10 minutes walking, freeway access less than 5 minutes and just down the street, an awesome sandwich shop right around the corner, and Jon was right about parking on the street being a piece of cake!

Would we stay here again? YES. Highly recommended for sure!
"
3231850,32584511,2015-05-19,4610856,Kimberly,"This is a wonderful, light, open space in a quiet neighborhood that felt very safe and comfortable. The location is perfect for walking and driving access to everything, especially Green Lake! I would definitely make this my go-to for Seattle!!"
3231850,32971801,2015-05-24,104998,Peggy,"My sister and I enjoyed a wonderful Seattle vacation at the Green Lake Carriage House. Jon and his lovely family were very friendly and helpful though not intrusive and promptly provided directions and answered all our questions.  The Carriage House is beautifully designed and spotlessly clean and is located in a trendy residential area within walking distance to appealing neighborhood restaurants; bus stop is less than a block away. The loft space might make this best suited for young hipsters, but this old hipster was glad she got to stay at such a cool place before her knees refused to get her up the steep ladder-like stairs. All in all, a fun and unique experience we very much enjoyed."
3231850,33456606,2015-05-28,25096058,Carolyn,"I had a great experience at the carriage house.  Jon and his wife were friendly and welcoming and the carriage house was exactly as it is pictured.  I loved the location (lots of local bars and restaurants within walking distance) to so many things as well as great access to bus lines.

I travel to Seattle often for work and would happily book the carriage house again."
3231850,33727618,2015-05-31,5168444,Alan,"Can't say enough about how beautiful and well taken care of this house is.  Jon's description, if anything, wasn't enough to accurately describe how lovely of a stay we'd have.  Truly enjoyed not only the loft, the care to detail, and the location, but Jon really went above and beyond to ensure we were comfortable and logistically set."
3231850,34127233,2015-06-05,30447152,Brett,This was a great place to stay. The door lock pin is prearranged check in access is easy. The place is spot on like the photos and is very clean. Jon did a great job with the industrial styling and build quality.
3231850,35285564,2015-06-17,25951084,Sue,"Yes Jon and family were very friendly and helpful . The accommodation was very clean and had several useful extras such as  hairdryer, toiletries . I thought the keylock was extremely safe .
excellent location being close to University and Seattle centre but is also  situated in a very quiet area."
3231850,39421663,2015-07-23,6327068,Kelly,"We loved The Carriage House and will be back if they'll have us!  Jon has thought of all the details that make it a lovely and convenient place to stay...  Jon, I think we stole on of your ""welcome"" pages by accident!  They were so useful that it was on the table and was collected and put away with my work papers.  Sorry!  Hope to see you next we are in town!"
3231850,39756520,2015-07-26,21749182,Cheryl,"The Green Lake Carriage house we perfect for our weekend trip to Seattle. Jon was excellent, replying quickly to our questions and made sure that we were comfortable and had everything we needed. "
3231850,40206600,2015-07-29,1453650,Stephen,"My experience staying in this home/apt was absolutely fantastic!  Jon made me feel very welcome and provided excellent detailed information about the space and its neighborhood.  Off-street parking was nice and just a few steps away from the apartment.  

As a former Seattle resident, the neighborhood was one I was not very familiar with, so I was very appreciative to Jon for providing helpful details of what the neighborhood has to offer: a lot, while being close to downtown and other desirable locations with the city.  

I read several positive reviews about this offering and I would agree with everyone who provided favorable feedback.

I highly recommend this space and hope to stay there on any future visits to the area.

Thank you Jon, 
SD"
3231850,40738543,2015-08-02,23321020,Madelyn,"The Carriage House was perfect for our stay! Walking distance from some great places and easy to the lake. Honestly this is a wonderful use of space and we will definitely be staying here whenever we return to Seattle!
Jon was great at communicating on location and taking our comfort into account.  
One warning: shower is not meant for anyone over 6', but you can make it work if you try! "
3231850,41364542,2015-08-07,12969988,Hamilton,"This was the perfect airbnb experience!  Wow.  The Carriage house is even cooler than the photos.  Jon was an excellent host: responsive, helpful, and generous (local fresh fruit waiting for us!).  Great location in Seattle.  Everything ran super smoothly.  I can't recommend this rental highly enough!"
3231850,43045279,2015-08-17,19788953,Brian,"The carriage house is awesome! Whenever my mom comes to Seattle to visit, this is her go-to spot. It is super clean and very comfortable. LOVE the Apple TV. Green Lake is an awesome neighborhood- a lot of good food. The carriage house is jus a 10 minute walk from the park which is one of the most frequented parks in the country! Close to the U-District, Wallingford, and Fremont. Also one of the most affordable places you can stay in Seattle. "
3231850,43545835,2015-08-20,5985986,Emily,"Jon's guesthouse is the nicest and most unique place to find on Airbnb. It's beautifully built and just as great as it looks in the pictures. He's stocked it with all the amenities you could want, which came handy when we needed bags for sandwiches. We used his guesthouse as our home base for hiking in Mt Rainier and it worked perfectly. It's off the University of Washington exit and has parking available in the driveway. Jon and his family live next door and are super friendly and helpful."
3231850,44470667,2015-08-26,34482758,Aaron,"This is a great place to stay in Seattle! Jon provides a well appointed private carriage house in quiet Green Lake neighborhood. Zoka coffee is a 5 minute walk and great way to start your day with a local Seattle coffee shop experience, and there are several excellent dining options in the vicinity as well. You'll most likely want to rent a car for your stay if you plan to get out and do some sightseeing. "
3231850,45365080,2015-09-02,17422811,Zachariah,"Once again my friends and I chose to stay here at the Green Lake Carriage House while we attend PAX Prime 2015, and again we absolutely loved our stay! Since our last stay, there has been some nice improvements to the house, including a nice closet with coat rack to better store our clothes during our stay. I honestly didn't think our stay could have been better than it was last year, but it was! Unfortunately, because of our schedules, we did not get to spend too much time in the neighborhood as most of our time was spent in Seattle, but we did get a small chance to chat with our hosts on the way back to the house one afternoon. We really enjoy the lovely neighborhood, amazing hosts, and awesome housing. Already we are looking forward to coming back to stay here again next year!"
3231850,45958399,2015-09-07,2843297,Camille,"This was one of my favorite experiences while traveling.  The neighborhood is beautiful!  Very suburban but only about 10-15 minutes from downtown.  They have the coolest dragonfly mural on the street which made me smile every time I saw it.  Walking to breakfast (The Butcher and the Baker and Cafe LuLu) and to Green Lake was very easy.  
The place itself is exactly how it looks.  Clean, modern, and incredible.   Sitting on the couch and looking around at the craftsmanship was breath taking.  The place also had everything I needed (umbrella, iron, scissors).  Clean and quaint!  Also the lock pad was very efficient.  The house is easy to find from the street.
Overall staying here felt like living in Seattle.  Jon and his family are nice, helpful, and welcoming.  Very gracious hosts.  Next time I go back to Seattle I'll be looking this place up again! "
3231850,46740668,2015-09-13,24717199,Penny,"Had a fantastic stay here with my fiancé on our weeklong trip to Seattle.  We chose this place because of the location, reviews, and the pictures. The images were spot on.  It's a very cozy and charming place to spend a few nights while exploring Seattle and surrounding areas.  Really impressive that Jon built everything himself!  Felt very reminiscent of our stays in Sweden with the clean and modern architectural designs.  Loved all the natural light coming in through the skylights and all the windows throughout the carriage house.  We stayed here during the summer but imagine it would be great during the rainy season to see the rain pitter patter from all the different window locations.  Also, would be an excellent time to read through the classic book selection in the loft and play a couple board games in the TV media console.  (The place is well equipped for any season!)

Jon is super nice and informative.  We corresponded with him via email during our stay and met him in person on our last day.  He is as cordial and personable in person as he is via email.  Overall, we had a great stay and would definitely return when we have the chance!"
3231850,47489793,2015-09-19,10426078,Sangeun,"Great to stay! Room was very clean and well prepared the item i need 
The house make me good memory about Seattle! Thank you alot :) "
3231850,48076334,2015-09-23,2050325,Jesse,"This was my second stay at Jon's carriage house, and it was just as magical as the first. The location, and the surrounding neighborhood can't be beat. An easy walk to a few different areas of bars/restaurants, as well as beautiful Green Lake. It's so peaceful inside the carriage house, and the bed/linens throughout are awesome. It was a great advantage to have a driveway spot to park our car as well. Next time we're in Seattle, we will absolutely be staying at Jon's place again, no question about it!"
3231850,48753859,2015-09-28,16038844,Heather,"We felt very welcome, we were greeted when we arrived. Everything we could have needed was provided, including some great recommendations for the neighborhood. Speaking of the neighborhood, it was such a great quintessential Seattle location! It was also convenient to anything we wanted to do. "
3231850,49432877,2015-10-04,16091885,Suejon,"LOFT:
I feel like I lucked out finding this charming little loft!   It was the perfect space for me & my husband.  (Cozy and still Roomy)  It really was one of the most charming spots we have ever stayed.    I loved how the upstairs bedrooms windows where in the perfect spot to let in natural light and listen to the raindrops.  (Relaxing).  
The location was super convenient.  

LOCATION:
We felt like we were close to enough to the city, to pop in and out of main Seattle.  But far enough to have some peace & quite.   The neighborhood felt very safe and walkable.   The loft itself is located near some great bars and dining spots (Lantana, Tornado, Pies & pints!)
Jon was easy to reach & very helpful!!!!  We enjoyed having the brief chat with him about how he built the loft (you can tell it’s a labor of love)

IN CLOSING:
Loved everything about this cute Airbnb!  We definitely want t stay here again on our next Seattle (website hidden):
Thank you Jon for being such  great Host!
"
3231850,51318017,2015-10-19,13574918,Lauren,"My husband and I stayed here and it was perfect for our adventurous stay in Seattle. The place is cozy, clean and has everything you need. The windows and natural light make the place even more comfortable. The location is great as well. There's a bus stop for downtown literally right around the corner as well as restaurants, cafes and a pub down the street from the Carriage House. I recommend Cafe Lulu for a quick breakfast and coffee! The neighborhood and house is so charming. Would definitely recommend! "
3231850,51676328,2015-10-22,4905127,Toetsie,"The carriage house is such a great place to stay in! Comfy bed, great area to sit and work in, and lovely hosts! I totally needed this place and got what i needed! Great for one or two people, and is exactly as it is described. 

And i loved meeting the kid for a little chat, what a great guy!

Good Luck J&L!

Toetsie"
3231850,52081341,2015-10-26,6263914,Lauren,The place was so clean and quiet. It has everything you need. The keyless entry is convenient too. It's a great neighborhood. 
3231850,52983812,2015-11-03,339157,Lesley,"This is by far the best Airbnb I have stayed in since using the site for about 4yrs!  It was nice, cozy and pretty amazing at how Jon utilized the space with modern decorating.  No complaints at all, the location to food was great and within walking distance.  15min Uber ride to downtown but the close eateries provided enough for my entertainment.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in Seattle, in fact this is where I'm staying next time I return."
3231850,53336415,2015-11-08,31470595,Mike,We had a great time staying at the Carriage house. It is the coolest modern design you will see anywhere and a fantastic break from the regular hotel room or renovated basement. Everything about it is well designed and thought out. It is also on a great location that is close to lots of things. Good local coffee and eating places 5 minute walk away. UW is only 10 min away.  The neighborhood is nice and quiet with the coolest dragonfly mural painted on a T intersection down the street. But I have to focus on the great loft apartment design. If you stay here you will never forget it. It's one of a kind. 
3231850,53776880,2015-11-12,2007580,Elizabeth,This place is great! Good location - the neighborhood is cute and it's a quick and convenient drive to downtown. Jon and his family were super friendly. Perfect spot! 
3231850,53977330,2015-11-15,12144940,Ken And Laurie,"Great communication with Jon. Perfectly described accomodations. Beautiful touches and a fun vibe.
Nicely done!"
3231850,55654808,2015-12-04,28460788,Kimberly,"The Carriage House was an awesome place to stay for our anniversary! The location is really great, it's close enough to Seattle to get in and out of downtown relatively quickly (even in rush hour). In the neighborhood, there are a lot of good eats walking distance or just a few minutes drive. The house provided a great, quiet getaway from hustle and bustle. The house itself is the perfect size for 1-2 people, anymore than that would have been too crowded. We really enjoyed where the bed is, it feels like you're in a tree house! Overall, it was a great spot and I would recommend it. "
3231850,55788256,2015-12-06,17171909,Maya,"We had another wonderful stay at The Carriage House. The place is modern & perfect, and Jon is a wonderful, responsive host. The city is easily accessible and there are many great restaurants nearby. Looking forward to our next stay! "
3231850,56349551,2015-12-12,50767612,Erin,Jon and his wife were very gracious hosts.  Jon was able to accommodate my husband and I in his carriage house on very short notice.  The carriage house in itself is amazing!  It's just so cool with a sort of modern industrial vibe and it was very fun to stay there.  The neighborhood has a few excellent restaurants as well.  We had a great stay.  
3231850,57571492,2015-12-27,40743082,Cora,Wonderful house and wonderful host! Jon is a kind and friendly host.I love this house so much that I will live again next time!
3585592,16505520,2014-07-28,18105046,Chris,Great apartment in a great location. 
3585592,17076814,2014-08-06,19141845,Jay,"I arrived in Seattle to look for a place to live and start a job at the very same time.  Arrived at Matt's and he made me feel right at home.  Besides giving a parking pass for my rentacar (always got parking across the intersection from the apartment), the apartment was gorgeous, spacious, modern, but still cozy.  Was able to go for a nice jog in Capitol Hill one morning.  Walking distance to fun without being right in the thick of it.  Trader Joe's and other grocery store just a block away.  Really got me off to a great start here in Seattle!"
3585592,19989688,2014-09-21,1728510,Diane,"The place was amazing!! Loved the design and the amenities. The view from the rooftop was so beautiful. In addition, the location was great. We did über a couple times between the restaurants and here, but only because we had massive food coma and could not even walk 2 feet!  Matt was very responsive and we had no trouble reaching him.

We were greeted by a note, and were even left a guest pass for parking if we needed it. This loft was GORGEOUS with amazing views of the city on the rooftop deck area. It was also in a very happening area, making it easy to find something to do."
3585592,34469056,2015-06-08,22898234,Meron,Enjoyed our stay at Matts place.  Very clean and great location!  The rooftop deck was nice as well.
3585592,39108580,2015-07-20,28712397,Garrett And Emily,We had a wonderful stay in the loft. Excellent location in Capitol Hill about 2 miles from downtown ($10 Uber ride). Very clean and spacious. 
3585592,41001639,2015-08-03,2999267,Andre,"Great apartment, easy stay, excellent location."
3585592,45179262,2015-08-31,7251896,Vivian,"Matt's place is quite spacious and neat. It's clean and homey. I really enjoy staying at Matt's place. And I'd recommend it to anyone who travels to Seattle for fun and vacation. 

I had a pleasant experience staying with Matt's place! 

PS: the thai restaurant right besides the Loft is pretty good:) "
3585592,46223152,2015-09-08,42931402,Megan,Had an amazing weekend in Seattle. The place was super easy to get into and was in an excellent location for checking out Capitol Hill and downtown. The apartment was spacious and clean with great views!
2274086,13165808,2014-05-20,10131540,Anna,"Great neighborhood to stay in- the house is on a quiet side street, with easy walking to restaurants and bars and bus routes. The room has a lot of character, and lots of space to hang out. With the curtains closed, it's conducive to sleeping in forever, so you might need an alarm! We never got to meet Jack and Kate, but they were very helpful over text. Very happy with our stay!"
2274086,13376369,2014-05-26,10282187,Laura,Friendly hosts and great location in a fun neighborhood! We really enjoyed the decoration of the red room and the comfortable beds but the bathroom was tiny. I would recommend staying with Jack and Kate.
2274086,13528105,2014-05-29,9013718,Paul,"Jack and Kate, (and Rupert), are gracious and helpful hosts.  Location is ideal.  Would be happy to stay at their place again. "
2274086,13590396,2014-05-31,6200421,Hardy,"Jack, and Kates place is located in the awesome Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle. They both are kind and open minded people and we loved staying in their place. The Red room is really comfy with lots of space and it is clean and quiet. Rupert the cat was nice to hang out with, too :-)"
2274086,13722353,2014-06-02,4980617,Claudia,"Awesome location. Close to nightlife in Seattle. Also walking distance to many restaurants/coffee shops. The place is fine for the price. In my opinion the room is too dark, stayed there with other girls and getting ready in a dark room was a little difficult. Also all of us wished the washroom was cleaner. If you are no picky about washroom then this is a great place to stay because of the location."
2274086,13930505,2014-06-08,15968844,Jordan,"The room is a very fun and funky space, just mind your head if you're tall. It's located on a quiet street with a decent amount of free on-street parking close by, and there are plenty of bars and cafes that are just an easy walk away! Kate was a fabulous host and even took us to a few local hot spots for drinks. The bathroom is small but there was always plenty of hot water in the shower. We would definitely stay again!"
2274086,14135574,2014-06-12,16343726,Gilbert,A really funky place close to everything with 2 pretty cool hosts that are very knowledgeable about Seattle culture. Rupert the cat will show you the love! 
2274086,14176209,2014-06-13,2881993,Mads,"Great hosts, great room, great location"
2274086,14481933,2014-06-20,16114069,Cynthia,"     Our stay was excellent. When you enter the room, really you're entering the personalities of your hosts; Victorian musician hipsters who have a fantastic, defined sense of style. It's decor is a concert of collectible, old-fashioned typewriters, tasteful red accents, and musical instruments all conducted by the various pictures of Nick Cave. 
     The location is central to plenty of local bars, restaurants, and coffee shops as well as having easy access to the uptown, downtown, and all of Seattle's attractions. 
     The hosts have placed an emphasis on their tenants' privacy and respect the boundaries of the living arrangements, but when you do catch them, their obvious knowledge of the area becomes apparent in the first sentence. We found them full of character and they truly understood the local scene. 
     The nuts and bolts of the place in its entirety is as advertised; the room is red, the bathroom is tiny, the wireless internet works, there is access to a kitchen, a washer and dryer, and a fridge in the room. The bed was comfortable and the ample sofas and living space in the room was lush. For the money, the place is a real value. If the cost was a bit more, the place would still be a real value. I would easily stay there again and recommend this to my friends and family. 
     This description is fair and accurate and if it sounds good to you you will not be disappointed with your stay. If you want a bland, ""The room was fine."", Motel 6 experience with free HBO then this might not be the place for you. If you want a stay that is worthy of a good conversation when you go back home, then you'll want to call Jack and Kate right away. "
2274086,14564298,2014-06-22,8097561,Adrian,"My flight got cancelled and I was unable to make the trip, but Kate & Jack were very attentive and understanding via text, and always got back to me in a timely manner. I hope to stay with them next time I'm in Seattle. "
2274086,14644770,2014-06-23,1021841,Nicole,"Great neighborhood, easy to find, fun space with plenty of room, and Jack & Kate are excellent hosts.
We came in late, slept well, skipped showering in the worlds smallest (but cute) bathroom, gave Rupert the friendly cat a little love, and ate a great breakfast about 2 blocks down at the Skillet Diner. Would do it again :)"
2274086,14798854,2014-06-26,13831918,Robert,"The Red Room's location is close to many bars and shops. Very interesting part of Seattle. Jack and Kate were very welcoming and friendly.  Jack recommended checking out EMP museum, and he was spot on (seriously if you do anything in Seattle, go to the EMP). If I visit Seattle again in the near future, I'll be sure to see if this place is available. "
2274086,14837756,2014-06-27,16798708,Eli,"Jack and Kate were great hosts.  Very friendly and they gave my girlfriend and I some great insight into the best local spots to see the real Seattle.  The location was awesome.  The room had a really cool projector set-up which we were bummed wasn't up and running, but it gives us something to look forward to on our next visit! Definitely recommend the red room."
2274086,14937203,2014-06-29,9129220,Debra And Geoff,"Jack and Kate's room is funky and for the young at heart. We enjoyed the ambience of the room and the small apartment. As other reviewers have said, if you like the straight lines and modern sameness of a hotel this place is not for you. It is a young people's home with hidden corners and old fittings. Yes the bathroom is tiny but that adds to the fun of the place. The bed is extremely comfortable. The area is ideally situated, not close to freeways, and within walking distance to a restaurant and bar strip. We walked all the way into downtown and it was easy. We hardly saw Kate and Jack because of their work schedule but they were very helpful and friendly. We are 62 year olds and we really liked the feel of the place, like going back to younger days. "
2274086,15058456,2014-07-01,16030429,Josh,"The location is central to plenty of local bars, restaurants.

Jack and Kate were great hosts. Very friendly and open minded. They gave my friends and I some great insight into the best local spots, restaurant and gave us a lot of useful travel advices.

Rupert was cute n nice to hang out with ^^. 

We’ll definitely recommend the cool red room. 
"
2274086,37920705,2015-07-11,26133237,Britny,We had an amazing time at jack and Kate's red room! Their place is so charming and they made us feel at home! They were extremely accommodating and very friendly. We will definitely be back to stay again when we are back in Seattle!

194313,619611,2011-10-11,10904,Sarah,"Leah has set up a lovely and modern basement suite with every convenience possible, incluing a fully stocked kitchen. She was a welcoming host, was very flexible with our changing arrival time, and went out of her way to ensure we knew the local attractions. I would definitely recommend her place, which is central and safe.  "
194313,696135,2011-11-06,1280740,Yoko,"Leah was very kind and cheerful.
She flexibly responded to changes in schedule at short notice.
I asked her about bus route, and she did some checking up.
Her room was a quiet and comfortable. I fell safe and could relax.
"
194313,789866,2011-12-17,1448620,Thomas,Leah is a wonderful host and the space is a perfect home away from home.  Location is near everything worth checking-out in Capitol Hill.  Very clean and modern. I can't wait to return.
194313,973323,2012-03-05,1619995,Adam,"Fantastic place to stay, perfect location, and Leah was kind enough to share some of the best tea I've ever had!"
194313,1103170,2012-04-09,419166,Ian & Allison,Leah's place is great!  It had all the amenities we needed and we were very comfortable.  Loved the location!  We were able to walk everywhere.  Leah was very helpful and even let us use her parking pass to park on the street.
194313,1217084,2012-05-02,652569,Elizabeth,"Great location, adorable space. Everything you could need for a perfect stay in Seattle. Leah is a gracious, accessible hostess and her Slanted Ivy retreat is comfortable and cute."
194313,1241782,2012-05-07,1133926,Kirby,The Slanted Ivy rental was perfect for our weekend in Seattle.   Leah was very quick to reply to my questions and very easy to work with.  We can't wait to return
194313,1262007,2012-05-11,2033370,Rachel,"Great little place to stay in Seattle.  Nice remodeled clean room.  Close to bus lines that take you to downtown in just a few minutes.  Leah is very nice and accommodating, great host.  Home is in an area with a lot of character, we also felt very safe there. If you are coming to Seattle, I highly recommend staying here."
194313,1394627,2012-06-01,2231169,Brian,"Leah is a welcoming host with a lovely house. The place is quiet, cozy, very clean, and right in the middle of Capitol Hill, the best neighbourhood in the city. (It's also one of the most transit accessible; you really don't need a car when you're staying there.) And Leah was a very friendly host, offering to share market-fresh coffee cream as well as her back patio, and providing great advice on wandering the town. I would absolutely stay there again the next time I'm in Seattle!"
194313,1448035,2012-06-10,334966,Laura,"Our stay with Leah was fantastic. The private suite is clean and airy and had everything we needed. We didn't make use of the beautiful backyard, if only because there were too many other great things in the neighbourhood we wanted to check out. It's close to lots of great restos and shops in Capitol Hill, and it was also very easy to get everywhere else by bus. Leah was a very friendly host and a great source of information on the city. Highly recommended!"
194313,1849474,2012-07-31,460963,Adam,"We had a fantastic experience at this location! The host was super friendly, helpful, and yet very attentive to our needs while being sensitive to our own privacy. The separate entrance to the unit is a big plus so as not to disturb the owner, for example,when coming back late at night. The wifi connection was very strong and the location superb. We walked to downtown Seattle and back numerous times and it only took about 30 minutes each way on foot (a very leisurely stroll in the glorious July-August weather in Seattle). This location is ideally located in the wonderful Capitol Hill district and within a few minutes walk from two excellent grocery stores, Trader Joe's and Madison Market Central Co-Op. There is also a convenient bus stop just a few minutes walk from the unit. And the fabulous restaurants that Leah suggested couldn't have been better and they were all within walking distance! Oh, and the delectable local coffee beans (complete with our own coffee grinder!) and tea options Leah provided were an added bonus. The access to Leah's laundry and drying machines was another great perk! 

All in all, we were extremely satisfied with our Seattle vacation due in large part to the hospitality, convenience and comfort of this brilliant place and its lovely host! I will highly recommend it to friends coming to Seattle. "
194313,1947857,2012-08-11,2622066,Andrea,"We spent a week at Leah's and it was great.  Leah is a great host, available if needed but not intrusive. The. apartment is compact but she has everything you need in the kitchen. The Murphy bed is quite easy to use, the drop down desk is great and the bathroom spacious. There is even a washer and dryer for use. An  added bonus is the private garden, which is beautiful, filled with birds, and has chairs  for  enjoying it. The location in Capital Hill places you within walking distance great restaurants, shops and the bus. it is a perfect setting to enjoy Seattle."
194313,1986671,2012-08-14,2140920,Zom,"Leah has a host's perfect balance of warm and friendly, while sensitive to giving guests' their privacy. Even the space reflects this with a strategically placed plant in her beautiful garden that gives her guests privacy as they come and go. The basement space is fitted out beautifully with an especially nice bathroom and a useful kitchenette. I loved having the ability to compost and recycle our garbage.
This is a basement space with a single window in the main area and a low ceiling, but Leah has done everything possible to make it pleasant and welcoming."
194313,2092320,2012-08-25,2910233,Palak,"Everything at Slanted Ivy was great. Everything is nice, clean, and new. It is a little too far from downtown to walk but the bus is just around the corner. The sheets were a little itchy but thats a pretty small complaint. I would recommend the rental. "
194313,2128230,2012-08-28,839310,Miles,I had a great stay at the Slanted Ivy Vacation Rental. It was very clean and the location was perfect. I would definitely stay there again.
194313,4412618,2013-05-03,1374914,Merrick,"Leah really helped us out. We live in Seattle and weren't planning a vacation, but a malfunctioning sewer at our house forced one on us for a couple evenings. We were able to book Slanted Ivy and move in within an hour. Leah was very friendly and helpful and the accommodations very tidy and comfortable. She even provided coffee beans and a grinder! We didn't have much time to relax in the beautifully landscaped backyard and patio, but very much enjoyed coming and going through it.  It is in a great neighborhood, quiet and residential yet walking distance to great restaurants and night life. We will definitely be recommending it to out of town family and friends when they come to visit. Thanks again Leah!"
194313,5588563,2013-07-07,7070354,Dan,Frictionless stay. All amenities were clean and well kept. Leah made herself available to us and was very helpful and welcoming. A wonderful experience!

194313,6542435,2013-08-16,6962711,Jeremy,"Had a blast! Leah is really cool and gave us some direction on what to check out in the area. The place was great, super convenient. "
194313,10817001,2014-03-09,2299694,Tricia,"Leah's place is in a great neighborhood and the apartment was perfect. We stayed for 5 days and it felt like home. What a great deal for a kitchenette, private bathroom and private entrance. Also, the backyard was a huge perk! We feel like we got really lucky to find Leah. She was accommodating and super friendly. I highly recommend staying here, you'll feel like a local!"
194313,11179337,2014-03-24,2146621,William,"We had another great Airbnb stay. Leah's place is clean, quiet, and within walking distance to all of Capitol Hill. We would definitely stay here again. "
194313,11272739,2014-03-27,10720553,Jialei,The place was so clean and nice. It's very private and comfortable. The public transportation is also very convenient.
194313,12917955,2014-05-14,12621696,Christine,"We had a great stay...the room is exactly as pictured, very clean, and has everything you need. For us, the location was great...a very quiet pretty street with easy access to public transportation, grocery store, and restaurants.  A quick 10 minute bus ride and you are downtown.  
Leah herself was very warm and welcoming, and then left us on our own. A minor annoyance was the noisy fridge in an otherwise very quiet location. Would definitely return and do recommend."
194313,14206807,2014-06-14,794059,Garann,"Leah's place was lovely, and she was incredibly accommodating. We got in very late and had trouble getting the door unlocked, and she got up to let us in. The guest house was very clean and comfortable, with a full kitchen we would have used if we'd stayed longer than two nights. It's an easy walk to most parts of Capitol Hill, but there's also a pretty little garden right outside with chairs and wifi for working from. Would definitely recommend this spot to anyone."
194313,15497452,2014-07-10,1658173,Ruth,"We came in on a Sunday afternoon and enjoyed the gorgeous patio garden. We had a busy couple of days in Seattle but enjoyed the awesome location and easy access of this rental. The movie selection made a great late night wind down, the kitchenette was very practical, and the bed was really really comfortable!"
194313,15597553,2014-07-12,17372938,Bev,"Our 2 nights at Slanted Ivy Vacation Rental were very pleasant and comfortable. The accommodation is clean, contains everything one needs for a short stay, the back yard is a delightful oasis and the area very convenient to central Seattle. Leah is a friendly and accommodating host, we'll be back."
194313,15757441,2014-07-15,13236039,Gary,My wife and I selected the Slanted Ivy Vacation Rental because it was located in Capitol Hill and is close to good food and public transportation.  I had no problem finding the place and received a very warm welcome from Leah.  She provided us with great recommendations for restaurants within walking distance and provided me with information about public transportation (website and app).   We also enjoyed her garden in the back yard -- what a delightful retreat.    I would stay here again and recommend it highly.  
194313,16009100,2014-07-20,13236039,Gary,"The Slanted Ivy Vacation Rental was the perfect place to stay during our visit to Seattle.  The place was just like the listing.  It is conveniently located in Capitol Hill and is within walking distance of great restaurants and public transportation.  As a runner, I enjoyed running to several nearby parks.  My wife and I also enjoyed relaxing in the back yard garden.   We highly recommend that you stay here -- Leah provided great recommendations.  "
194313,18210291,2014-08-23,11547997,Raymond,"Staying with Leah was like having a nice little hotel room in the middle of a great part of town. Leah was very responsive and was available for suggestions on places to eat and things to do. She even let me store my bikes in a storage area to keep them out of the weather. Since you have your own entrance and your own space, you don't necessarily have a lot of contact with her but she is always a quick door knock or phone call away. Would stay there again. Great little spot. "
194313,18319595,2014-08-25,17721054,Sharon,"The neighbourhood where l
Leah's house is located is a wonderful area area with a great mix of homes and retail streets with restaurants and coffee shops. We enjoyed walking around so much that we walked 
to the downtown area which is very doable. The accommodations were great, with a private entrance, pretty backyard to sit in as well as a delightful bathroom and kitchen with lots of thoughtful amenities. We would definitely come back again and stay longer"
194313,18553175,2014-08-28,2748434,Jo Ann,"We felt very welcomed by our hostess Leah. The accommodations were even better than described. Ms. Leah provided wonderful organic bath soap, coffee beans with grinder as well as delicious loose tea. She had several recommendations to share as well as countless brochures to peruse. Since we were weary from traveling by motorcycle it was a pleasure to discover the Murphy bed was as comfortable as the reviews promised and luxurious hair products and blow dryer provided. I would definitely recommend this listing for Seattle visitors.  Public transportation is convenient with a bus stop 1/2 a block away, as well as several restaurant choices within walking distance.  Thank you Leah!!"
194313,18656859,2014-08-30,17469392,Alex,"My wife and I had a great experience at the Slanted Ivy Vacation Rental. Everything was clean, well-maintained, and was just as it was in the pictures. Leah was a great host and carefully explained everything we needed to know. "
194313,20903037,2014-10-07,20015919,Margaret,"We had a great experience at Leah's. Her place is super cute, very clean, and so quaint! It's small, but was perfect for us as we spent most of our time exploring! Leah was very accommodating and met us at the beginning to show us around. Plus her place is walkable to pike place (assuming you like walking like we do, it's about 1.5 miles I think). Plus it's super close to the wandering goose, which has the best breakfast ever, and close to a grocery store too, and close enough to Capitol Hill bars! We would definite recommend staying here!"
194313,21628105,2014-10-20,5818526,Daniel,"Private, cozey and well apointed as described. Great little place!"
194313,24974232,2015-01-04,24874699,Sherry,"Leah is a very nice host. Even though I was doing a late check in,She was still waiting for my friend and me. and carefully introduce every facility to us. We had a good time there. "
194313,25252936,2015-01-10,14984026,Paula,"Cozy, private, great garden area, well maintained.  Leah easy to communicate with, accommodations as advertised.  Perfect area for walking to and from downtown, Pioneer Square and all over Capital Hill.  Could only wish for a reading lamp by the bed and maybe a little more cushy bedding.  Had a great stay!   "
194313,25567054,2015-01-19,965210,Kristina,"Leah's rental was just as described, and was very cozy and private. She provided everything needed to be more than comfortable, including quality coffee and tea, and cooking essentials. Leah was very friendly and responsive.

The rental is in a quiet, residential neighborhood close to many parks, cafes, restaurants, and grocery stores. It is also just a few blocks from Madison Ave, which will get you downtown very quickly by bus.  

This is a great rental for the location and price, and I'll most certainly look to stay here again if I need a place to stay in Seattle!
"
194313,25825151,2015-01-26,25867636,Yuexiang,We had a good great time in Leah's unit. Everything was good except it was a little bit too small. 
194313,27313925,2015-03-02,19090432,Lucretia,"We were newbies to Airbnb but, following our two week stay with Leah at her charming Slanted Ivy apartment, we are full-fledged converts!  From the outset, Leah was most gracious in accommodating our needs.  When booking we told her that we were not social people and thus would not want extensive personal contact; Leah assured us that she would respect our wishes which she did perfectly by allowing us to initiate interaction. She also thoughtfully considered our 70+ years by furnishing extra blankets plus an electric space heater.  Socially comfy and physically toasty: what’s not to love? 

Centrally located in Seattle, the Slanted Ivy apartment is only one block away from the Seattle/King County Metro bus system; using the online Metro trip planner  — or asking Leah! — makes moving around the city a stress-free delight.  No white knuckles from in-city driving!  Also close at hand on Broadway are a number of restaurants offering a range of dining options and fascinating people watching.  In short, Slanted Ivy is an ideal location with a charming host.  Brava!  "
194313,28031228,2015-03-16,2777216,Patrick,Very convenient location and beautiful back yard.

194313,28896403,2015-03-31,29072136,Michael,"Leah was incredibly welcoming, very accommodating, and great overall. She met us in front of her house when we first arrived, and she showed us around her backyard and gave us a lay of the land (with respect to both the mother-in-law and Seattle). She not only gave us advice about things to do in Seattle and about the best way to get around (via public transit), but she also had a very handy typed out guide that had this advice along with instructions about staying in the mother-in-law (which was very useful considering the intricacies of Seattle's garbage, recycling, and composting policy). 

The pictures of the mother-in-law on airbnb were very accurate. The place was lovely as was Leah's backyard. It was the perfect size for a vacation rental. We had plenty of space in the kitchen and dining area ( as well as part of the living area) even with all of our bags and the Murphy Bed down. 

The Capitol Hill neighborhood was great. It was close to a lot of fun thing, and the transit around there made it easy to go to other parts of the city. The house itself is in a nice quieter residential area so it is a great place to relax after a long day of running around. 
"
194313,29341451,2015-04-06,25379153,Jack,"This was just about the perfect AirBNB experience for my girlfriend and I, both in interaction with the owner and in the unit itself.

Leah let it be known that she was available and enthusiastic to give us advice about the neighborhood, but totally left us to our own devices. We met her early in our stay, and she gave us great advice for getting around the neighborhood (which is just as good as advertised, by the way), and was very warm and friendly.

The unit is fairly advertised. It's updated, clean, and cozy, but it isn't the type of place you would want to hang out in all day. Then again, hopefully you're not planning on visiting Capitol Hill and staying in your room all day anyway! On top of the basics, Leah gave us some nice perks- local coffee and tea, fresh and fluffy linens, and a fridge to put our leftovers in.

Thanks Leah!"
194313,29957696,2015-04-14,657626,Nikolay,"Lovely, efficient studio in great location! Very well maintained. Everything was great"
194313,30292024,2015-04-20,2122191,Jeff,"The experience was good. Was not at the location too often but all the amenities worked and there was no hassle. Leah was very nice and answered all my questions and requests in a timely fashion. She also let me leave my bags on the last day while I explored.

Overall good experience and I could have used the patio if I wanted to as well!"
194313,30633972,2015-04-25,4328335,Nichole,The studio apartment is perfect!!! The kitchen had everything I needed. The bed is very comfortable. Leah was a great host. Walking to the bus was close and Trader Joes is just a few blocks away 
194313,30816050,2015-04-27,31041350,Susan,"Leah was very welcoming in her emails and quick to respond.   The studio was clean, modern, comfortable, attractively decorated.  The kitchen was nicely stocked.  Coffee and tea made us feel welcome.  We didn't use the backyard, but it's beautiful.  The neighborhood is convenient to reach from the highway, has access to public transportation, has several supermarkets within a couple of blocks, and is also very pretty."
194313,30930850,2015-04-29,13325677,Elaine,"Great location, clean and quiet. We'll be back in the future!"
194313,31881035,2015-05-11,5119912,Kathy,"We had a fantastic stay at Slanted Ivy. This small studio is in the basement but there is natural light on two sides. Everything seemed very new, up to date and clean. The bathroom has a big shower with nice quality towels and plenty of hot water. The small kitchen is well stocked, even with high end coffee beans and a grinder (this is Seattle after all). The room has its own entrance and access to a small patio garden area. The location is great - near bus lines to downtown, a grocery store and lots of restaurants within walking distance. We only had a few conversations with Leah who is very friendly and was available if we needed her. We brought a car and found parking on the street to be pretty simple. All in all, it was the perfect choice for our trip."
194313,33293425,2015-05-26,32710230,Graham,"Leah was an absolute pleasure to work with. She was very responsive kind and helpful. The place was cute, clean, and cozy. The murphy bed was fun and the bathroom was nice. Great location to explore Seattle and the Capitol Hill neighborhood as you could get to almost any part of the city within 20 mins and there are some great restaurants and venues just a short walk away. Onsite coffee was an added bonus. This was our first Airbnb experience and Leah made it so comfortable and easy."
194313,35493062,2015-06-19,34501239,Jasenka,Overall positive experience. Very clean apartment with everything you need. Close walk to everything. 
194313,37575466,2015-07-08,3879920,Jana,It was easy to check in with Leah when I arrived - responsive to communication and accommodating. The space is cute (I admittedly have a weakness for efficiency studios) and as a bonus was quite cool and comfortable even during a heat wave since it's ground floor/basement located. The location is awesome - easy walking access to anywhere in Capitol Hill or to downtown. The herbal tea (from a local shop) was also really tasty!
194313,37840857,2015-07-11,5371419,Mary,"As much as I would like to keep Slanted Ivy to myself, I must share that it is everything defined in the listing plus more.  This has a private entrance and what I liked best is that being in the basement, it was nice and cool (there is a heater for cooler months).  Very quiet, private and clean.  I stayed there with my daughter.  It had everything we needed, and the neighborhood is wonderful. Wish we had had more time to wander about but we were in town for an event.  Leah is incredibly accommodating finding the right balance between tending to your needs and letting you go about your business.  As always, parking is an issue, but Leah provided a card for ""legal' parking in the neighborhood.  We felt safe there.  The backyard is very peaceful and pretty - the Pacific Northwest at your doorstep.  We will be back, and my message to the rest of you is - please don't book when we need to stay!  Thanks Leah!"
194313,46401604,2015-09-10,6353991,Amy & Michael,Leah's basement apt was very nice. Instruction page and Post-It notes were helpful and informative. We would recommend staying there.
194313,46877866,2015-09-14,7150948,Kara,"Great host! Very understanding of our unpredictable flights!  The unit was clean, quiet, and there were fun ""extras"" (local teas and coffee).  Great location, easily walkable to cafes/restaurants. "
194313,48278754,2015-09-25,37695904,Whitney,"The basement was thoughtfully designed to make the most of a tight space and was perfect for two. Very accurately described and located in the great Capitol Hill neighborhood, the accommodations were perfect for walking to amazing restaurants just 1/2 a mile away. Definitely hit Wandering Goose for delicious biscuits and gravy! And ask Leah for her wealth of food knowledge in the city.  Even the walk to downtown was not bad, since the weather was beautiful during our September stay.  I wish we would have taken advantage of her immaculate backyard oasis.  I would definitely recommend staying here! "
194313,48908266,2015-09-29,21807139,Kathleen,"We loved staying at Leah's place. Very clean, great location, beautiful yard. The sheets and bed were so comfortable!"
194313,49111575,2015-10-01,13325677,Elaine,"This was our second stay at Slanted Ivy. Leah is a great host, space is cozy and quiet and it's located in a great neighborhood. We'll be back!"
194313,52051111,2015-10-26,5371419,Mary,We had another wonderful stay at Slanted Ivy.  Warm and cozy this time (we were there this past Summer).  Great location with a daughter in college nearby.  Lots of coffee shops and diners that are worth a try.  Leah is beyond gracious and will handle whatever comes up - or leave you alone as needed.  Only regret?  We didn't stay long enough!  Hopefully next time. 
194313,52631318,2015-10-31,29691048,Lynn,"Greeted by Leah on arrival, we were promptly introduced to a great studio space with private entrance.  Accommodations weret cozy and located in a quite and beautiful neighborhood.  Space was comfortable and perfect for my visit to Seattle. Bed was comfortable. 
Thank you. Will be back again"
194313,52980479,2015-11-03,45077265,Kendra,"Leah was a fantastic hostess and the room is beautiful, comfortable, and well appointed for a single traveler or couple. Leah was available to check me in as soon as I arrived, and gave me a quick tour and some brief info about the neighborhood. She was available for questions, but gave me privacy the entire time. She recommended some great restaurants within walking distance, and they were well worth the short walk. The neighborhood was lovely and conveniently located. The best part was being very close to Seattle's vibrant restaurant scene, nightlife, and downtown, but still having a quiet, cozy place to unwind after a long day.  I would highly recommend Leah's home to anyone wanting to enjoy the city from a more local perspective, while still being walking distance to the major tourist spots. Thanks for a great experience!"
194313,53955543,2015-11-15,17189202,Christine,"I loved my week in Leah's cozy apartment. It was clean, comfortable, and had everything I needed. I had to work remotely every morning and the wi-fi never gave me issues. It was also very private so we never disturbed each other.  Leah was very welcoming and made sure there was nothing I needed. Don't be worried about the Murphy bed- it was very comfortable! I will definitely stay here on my next trip to Seattle."
194313,54860696,2015-11-25,14868299,Brian,Leah's flat was perfect for our four night Seattle stay. Bus stops are a block or two away. We were able to take a 10 min walk and access many Capital Hill restaurants/bars. Clean and comfortable place for two. Wonderful bathroom and kitchenette made our stay pleasant. Everything was user friendly and host is flexible/helpful. 
194313,55414496,2015-12-01,47288360,Angela,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Slanted Ivy.  Leah was away while we were there, but she left us detailed instructions and made sure we had everything we needed.  The space was cozy, tidy, and clean, and the location was central to everything we wanted to do in Seattle. "
194313,56470748,2015-12-14,35763918,Norman,"What a delight! We were met by Leah upon arrival and given a tour of the studio and brief introduction to the area. The pictures and descriptions of the space are spot on and the information on what to do and where to go helpful. 
We found the studio charming, comfortable, clean and perfect for our too short stay in Seattle. We will be back and look forward to another stay at Slanted Ivy!"
194313,57762413,2015-12-29,44288457,Teresa,Our stay at Slanted Ivy was super comfortable and cozy. Leah had the central heater on during the day and we were never cold at night. The place was super clean and close by to coffee shops and restaurants. We would definitely stay here again next time we're in Seattle. Leah was also very responsive and got back to me within a day or two tops. The bed was comfortable and perfect for two people.
194313,58453967,2016-01-02,11929266,Lynn,"Great location and cute cozy updated studio!  Leah gave great recommendations on restaurants and coffee, and Uber is super cheap to/from the link west lake station that takes you straight to the airport if you have a lot of luggage.  Love the option to do laundry too!"
1914051,10440266,2014-02-18,11266362,Jennifer,Anna was a great hostess.We had the opportunity to spend some time with her before our adventures in Seattle.  Her place is beautifully decorated and immaculate.  The location is in a nice and safe neighborhood and close enough to downtown.  She gave us some ideas on activities that we could do within walking distance of the house and was easily available for communication. We were impressed with our stay and feel you would be too. We hope to return for another stay in the near future.
1914051,10764658,2014-03-06,11920960,Laurie,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and we were thrilled when we arrived to find Anna's cozy cottage to be everything that we hoped for and more.  The location is great, right in the middle of the beautiful Queen Anne neighborhood.  Everything you could need in within a short walk:  one of the best bakery/cafes in Seattle, a convenient and surprisingly well stocked small market, a cleaner, coffee shop all within 5 minutes or less.  A bit further to the East Queen Anne Avenue North has wonderful restaurants, a book store, game store, various bakeries and other fun shops as well as banks and a Safeway.  We walked everyday, no matter what the weather was like and loved seeing all the beautifully restored old homes as well as some lovely modern ones.  But on the Anna's, first off she is a great hostess.  She immediately made us feel at home and was always quick to respond to any questions that we had.  The small kitchen is well designed and adequate to make most everything.  In spite of the many good restaurants we liked the flexibility and convenience of cooking many of our meals.  The bed was very comfortable (I've been meaning to ask what the brand is, it was way better than our sleep number.  The interior is fresh and clean and decorated very tastefully.  If I weren't such an avid walker I think that I would have been more than content to curl up on the sofa and spend my days reading in the comfort of the Italian Cottage.

1914051,11011152,2014-03-17,8898428,Tyler,"My first trip to Seattle was nothing but amazing! Anna's place is in the most beautiful part of the city. What made this experience even better was  Anna. She was very welcoming and we felt right at home. She left us a bottle of Prosecco as a welcoming gift and provided us with a list of all the hot spots to hit in town. Just a few blocks away is a park with the most stunning view of downtown Seattle. Downtown is a very short drive, although we found ourself not wanting to leave Queen Anne simply for it's beauty. Anna made this trip very easy and with her welcoming heart and spirit, I'd stay at her place again! Her place was perfect! Very clean and very comfortable. I wish I didn't have to leave. I rate this place 10/10. Seattle will always have a place in my heart"
1914051,11857410,2014-04-17,1893319,Ireta,"Anna is a wonderful hostess. This apartment is clean and beautifully furnished. I enjoyed my stay very much.

1914051,14051771,2014-06-10,2813133,Hari,"The apartment was very clean, newly renovated with beautiful new furniture. My wife and I, loved the place. The location is close to downtown and walking distance to a spectacular view of the downtown and the bay, truly beautiful view. Queen Anne neighborhood speaks for itself, a very nice neighborhood with friendly people. We ate at a local Mexican restaurant cross the street from the house, great food and very cheap. Anna is a great host. She even had a bottle of wine on the table for us. Thanks Anna for the great hospitality. 
 "
1914051,14160029,2014-06-13,15738264,Elizabeth,"We had a wonderful experience staying at this cottage! The space is comfortable, clean, and nicely decorated.  It is close to neighborhood amenities and the most amazing views of Seattle.  Anna is an incredible host.  She was attentive, positive, and accessible to answer any questions at any time.  A billion thanks for a wonderful experience in Seattle, Anna! "
1914051,14478409,2014-06-20,15653329,Amaya,"Loved Anna's place! Anna answered all our questions quickly, she's a great host.  Her place was clean and easy to find. The bus line #2 is a block down the street which takes you to downtown...we used public transport the whole time. The Queen Anne neighborhood has everything you might need...we liked the feel of it and felt safe. 
"
1914051,14903372,2014-06-29,4381103,Rick,"Anna's place is one of the best we've stayed at.  She has great artistic flair and the apartment shows it.  She is an outgoing, fun loving host, who will go the extra mile to assure you are comfortable in her apartment.  Everything in it is practically brand new.  It's fully equipped right down to extra-fluffy towels and a super comfortable mattress.  The apartment is true to the photos on the Airbnb site.   There is a beautiful backyard patio you can use.   It's a basement apartment, yet there is plenty of light and all the windows open, allowing plenty of fresh air and ventilation.  (The only caution:  if you're over 6 feet tall, you'll be uncomfortable with the low ceilings.  Thankfully this wasn't a problem for us.). Queen Anne is the nicest district in Seattle.  There are restaurants, shops, a Safeway, all within walking distance.  The #2 bus to downtown is right around the corner.  We wouldn't be happy staying anywhere else, if we're ever back in Seattle."
1914051,16450538,2014-07-28,12365823,Bangalore,"Neat house, great neighbourhood, excellent host. My wife and I stayed for five weeks and we had a very good time. Anna was ready to help no matter what the problem was. Would love to go back.

Very clean and charming accommodations, beautiful neighborhood with great views, and Anna left a very helpful and comprehensive neighborhood guide. The unit does have low ceilings so if somebody is taller than 6'4 (my boyfriend juuuust made the cutoff) they might be uncomfortable but everyone else will be just fine. Definitely recommend it!"

My parents definitely enjoyed their stay! "

It has many shops restaurants within walking distance which made it super easy to get around on foot as well as bicycle (also on a bus route).  Anna and her family were super accommodating to us and I would highly recommend her place."

Anna was very friendly and helpful. Pointing us to great spots in the neighborhood. 

Queen Anne is a great place to stay in Seattle. Convenient to everything but far enough away from the hustle and bustle. There are coffee shops and groceries within a few blocks.

1914051,18877841,2014-09-02,7310681,Tammy,"The listing description was accurate. Anna and her family lived upstairs and it was nice knowing she was there when we had questions. The place is located in the perfect area. Across from a beautiful school, a block away from a mini mart, bakery and some restaurants. I can't emphasis how awesome this location was! The place is also full furnished with a full kitchen, washer and dryer.

I would recommend Anna's place to anyone. =)"

For my first airbnb experience, it exceeded  my expectations!   It was located in a fabulous and safe neighbourhood with groceries, Mexican food and a wonderful bakery just around the corner right beside the bus stop.    

The apartment was clean and well stocked with pretty furnishings.   Washer and Dryer right outside our door.    The back yard is stunning and it was perfect weather to visit with Anna on her deck. 

She knows all of the hot spots and had some recommendations for us. 

We travelled by bus and by cab, the cab rides were approx. $10 from the space needle and $14 from Pikes Market.

It was a great vacation made just that more special by Anna's apartment. "
1914051,19785997,2014-09-18,15462722,Helen,"We did not meet Anna in person or her daughter, however Anna was always available by phone for any questions we had.  The location is great , just outside of town and with several buses available. Driving and parking in town can be a hassle, so we took bus #13 which was quite direct.  Never had to wait more than 10 mins. for a bus. Stops are either 2 blocks away or about 6-7 blocks, depending on route.
Nearby is a nice park for night time views of the city.
The room is as described and clean with several useful informative flyers of resteraunts etc.
The neighborhood is perfect for walking and viewing beautiful gardens."

It is in the charming Queen Anne neighborhood which i fell in love with.  I brought my 85yr. old mother up to see her ailing sister.  And it was accessible for an ambulatory senior (and house on flat site).  Perfect for us.

1914051,22480765,2014-11-07,23273400,Ben,"I was excited first off that Anna had space available because all over town was filled up with no vacancies.  The neighborhood is really awesome!  Very quaint and the Macrina bakery is right down the street.  Very cool.  Anna has a couple of units at her place downstairs that has an entrance on the side that is easily accessible and apparent.  The apartment is immaculate. There is a convenient lock on the outside door that is pushbutton so I didn't have to fumble for keys.  Very nicely furnished and inviting.  Very cozy.  The low ceilings weren't an issue.  I'm 6' and was never feeling squished or cramped.   Overall I'm very happy that Anna opened her space to me!  She is a very friendly girl and pretty funny, I got a chance to have a quick meet up and chatted for a bit.  Nothing about my stay felt awkward or uncomfortable.  Anna makes Airbnb comfortable and easy!  I'm going to keep Anna's spot on my favorite spots to visit when I come back to Seattle.  I can't say enough how awesome Anna's place is!  "

Anna was a wonderful hostess-- she chatted with my aunt and uncle and gave them fun tips about the city.  The cottage is a lower-level apartment and is absolutely adorable.  Beautiful furnishings, immaculate, great little kitchen, attached laundry....3 blocks from Macrina Bakery, etc., and about 10 blocks from the high street.  We will be using this for guest overflow again, absolutely!  What a wonderful find!"

The cottage is so charming, clean and convenient to walking to restaurants and shops - we had no problem walking down to the Space Needle - it's a healthy walk, but safe and really beautiful.  Our host supplied many extras we didn't expect - sugar/simple spices, coffee filters, shampoo/conditioner, lotion, etc.  This was a great value in an adorable neighborhood - can't wait to return!!"

As other reviews have said, the bed is super comfortable and made waking each day quite difficult :p We went in the winter time, but the heater and the coziness of the space kept us warm. The place is also in a very convenient location!

Would definitely stay again when in Seattle!"

My boyfriend and I drove in all the way from Sacramento for the New Year, it was so wonderful to arrive to such a cute and cozy place. It almost felt like home. I was happy to be staying there at the end of a long day of exploring the city. We didn't get to meet Anna, but she communicated with us and made check in easy, even though I was a little anxious since this was my first AirBnB experience. 

The bed, at first, felt firmer than what I am used to to, but it later conforms to your body...I had the best sleep it was SOOO comfortable. There are plenty of blankets too, so I did not freeze my butt off considering how cold it was outside. 

The neighborhood is very nice and there's plenty of parking. There are nearby cafés (Macrina, Bustle) and places to eat. Queen Anne Ave is also not too far of a walk, there are plenty of great restaurants and a Safeway. It really is a nice neighborhood to have a stroll in. 

Apart from being comfortable and clean, the apartment had many amenities that I did not expect. There was GOOD shampoo, conditioner and body wash (plenty of it too, I didn't even use what I packed), plenty of towels, linens, and in the kitchen small snacks, basic seasonings, plenty of utensils, plates, bowls, etc. I wanted to actually use it, but I didn't get to (apart from using the microwave). The living room and dining room was spacious and stylish.

All in all, I HIGHLY recommend it and we would stay again. The only things are the ceilings are a bit low and you can hear people talking and walking around upstairs. I'm 5'2"" and a heavy my sleeper, so they were not issues for me, but anyone over 6' might be uncomfortable or if you're a light / early sleeper, it might be something to consider."

Everything was very accurate with her descriptions as well as photos provided! Anna was very easy-going and accommodating! This cottage is ONE of the reasons why I loved my stay in Seattle! :)
1914051,25143494,2015-01-07,24750581,Leigh,"Anna's place is very nice. It IS very stylish and very comfortable. It is right in the bus route so we were able to catch a bus into Seattle Center and downtown easily. It was easy to find, there's a great bakery practically next door, and Anna was a great host. "
1914051,25628625,2015-01-21,14887928,Vera,"Anna's place was everything we needed! The location was perfect for commuting to downtown within a short one block walk to the 2 and 13 bus stops. The apartment is very clean and cozy and Anna was available to answer questions. Quenn Anne is a lovely area to explore full of shops and restaurants. Safeway and Trader Joes are within walking distance and Ken's market is one block away.
The quenn size bed is very comfortable and appreciated after a long day exploring!
I would recommend Anna's to anyone wanting to stay in a quiet residential neighborhood yet close to everything via bus.

The neighborhood was safe, quiet and had plenty of street parking in front. There is a grade school across the street as well as cafes and a market just around the corner.

Overall the place was incredible. It was cozy, charming and much roomier than I expected! It was the perfect place to stay!"
