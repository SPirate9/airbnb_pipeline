3487824,49091019,2015-10-01,13698923,Rahel,"We had an awesome time at Gene and Jamie's Apartment. First of all the Check-In went very easy due to exact description in the house manual. The Room was incredible! Very clean and lovely furnished. The bed was extremely comfy and they generously offered some complimentary food and drinks in a little fridge. The Bath is well equipped with towles and shampoo etc. The Building is in walking Distance to Chinatown and Downtown (Pike/Pine Shoppingstreet). The Metro and Bus Station are located just a few blocks away. We luckily got to meet the hosts and they were super friendly. For us it was the best place to stay, thanks for having us. "
3487824,49630633,2015-10-05,41714876,Emily,"We had great time staying in the International District - Gene and Jamie were so very accommodating! Gene was very helpful taking us around the day we landed and giving us all the information regarding places to visit, history of the city, etc... we will definitely visit again. They made us feel at home in their very hip apartment. Seattle is so vibrant and everyone was extremely welcoming to us Detroiters during our time there. Be sure to look up Gene's listings when visiting Seattle! "
3487824,50058496,2015-10-08,33514145,Sonia,"We had a good stay in this room. It was simple and a nice view of downtown. It was our first time in Seattle. It was nice to watch Netflix from the TV. We watched a movie and it was good. The host also has some drinks and a few snacks in a mini fridge, which was very nice. It is helpful to read manual; it is included in one of the emails airbnb sends you. We rested well before our trip to Canada."
3487824,50155176,2015-10-09,44712166,Joseph,"Excellent central location. Very comfortable accommodation. Great hospitality 
Strongly recommend this great spot. "
3487824,50304390,2015-10-11,42914318,Emily,"Gene is an excellent host and his apartment is situated in an awesome location, within walking distance to Pike Place Market. I highly recommend staying with Gene if you are traveling through Seattle. "
3487824,51119084,2015-10-18,16186238,Leah,"I had a great time in Seattle and Gene and Jamie were wonderful hosts. I honestly cannot think of any suggestions for improvement. They shared their home, wine, coffee, conversation, and kindness. Thank you!"
3487824,51876035,2015-10-24,14653144,Kate,Thank you for your hospitality. Great bed in a cool and aesthetically pleasing space. Enjoyed sitting with you both. Will return when next back in Seattle or elsewhere as you build your Dexter!
3487824,52300889,2015-10-27,21150870,Jennifer,"Great location, great communication, lovely hosts, and a really nice space.  Thank you!"
3487824,52633072,2015-10-31,2325787,Varsha,"The hosts were very welcoming. The location of the apartment was great, in downtown Seattle, close to everything. The views from the apartment were breathtaking!

"
3487824,53641839,2015-11-10,26319859,Nina,"I had a very pleasant stay with Gene. The space was clean, as described, and in a  great location-- a short walk or commute to essentially anywhere in the city. The host himself was very hospitable, welcoming, and had plenty of great suggestions for places to eat and things to do. I would highly recommend staying here. "
3487824,54410928,2015-11-19,48768138,Derek,Great experience overall
3487824,54539339,2015-11-21,6932952,Saad,"Awesome location, incredibly clean and very accommodating hosts!"
3487824,54719811,2015-11-23,38765533,Marilou,"Gene and Jamie's place is a great place to stay when you are visiting downtown Seattle. Everything is walking distance but if you are driving, parking spaces are bit challenging. Bed was very comfortable and everything is clean. "
3487824,54957634,2015-11-25,49576810,Haley,This host provided everything I needed for a comfortable stay!
3487824,55442233,2015-12-01,24746739,Lili,"Lovely place with high connivence in Seattle downtown. The apt is very clean and spacious. One thing to point out is that, you really need to look at the picture of the room before you decide to book. I didn't see the large portrait on the wall until I arrive there. It didn't affect anything to me. But it did feel weird as if someone is starring you...Overall the experience is good. I would recommend it. However, the onsite manager didn't find that all the supplies in the bathroom were actually running out. She sent me body wash after I told her. If she can check everything before I check-in that would be nice. And also the stuff in minibar ( there is no water)."
3487824,55600129,2015-12-02,20311573,Bart,"Super clean, welcoming, quiet.  Couldn't ask for more.  Thanks"
3487824,55687437,2015-12-04,12849308,Jennifer,"I'm so happy I chose Gene's place for my trip to Seattle. The location was great, in walking distance to many cafes and restaurants. The apartment is beautifully decorated and the bed super comfy. Everything was very clean, and there was excellent communication. Highly recommended! I'd be glad to stay at Gene's place on my next trip to Seattle. Thank you!"
3487824,55952697,2015-12-07,6781397,Jason,"Seamless and enjoyable experience all around. The location was superbly convenient, and the accommodations were perfect for our needs. Highly recommended."
3487824,56084412,2015-12-08,16836487,Yuan,"It is wonderful staying here at this gorgerous apartment. Gene is very thoughtful, leaving the TV on, heater's temperature about right. The location is amazing, and I love these art pieces. I have my car just street parking overnight for free. I definitely recommend this airbnb. "
3487824,56397285,2015-12-13,22838965,怡雯,Good location&Very comfortable apartment!Chose it make our trip perfect!
3487824,56562449,2015-12-14,48958649,Maria,"Clean, quiet, and conveniently located ! "
3487824,56736237,2015-12-17,49671775,Andrea,"Apartment was very centrally located and looked exactly like it does in the picture. They had left the heater on for us, so it was comfortable from the moment we stepped in. Although we had rented a private room, we had the whole apartment to ourselves which was a definite plus. Linens and towels were clean and soft and the added netflix service was much appreciated, as was the stocked mini-fridge!"
3487824,56807649,2015-12-18,837294,Nikolai,"The listing was in an extremely convenient part of downtown, just off of i5 and very close to everything one could want. The apartment was clean and comfortable, and just like the host had described. I will happily look it up again next time I visit Seattle. "
3487824,56887637,2015-12-19,24705091,Dimitri,A wonderful place at a great location. Very comfortable and cozy. Thanks to the host for providing everything I needed.
3487824,56981578,2015-12-20,51278225,Moye,Nicer room than we thought. The room is pretty warm and the bed is soft. The only thing is the bathroom is slippery. If the non-slip mat is provided it will be better.
7902569,43720323,2015-08-21,40509410,Lakshmi,"I had an amazing experience staying with Brendon and his wife Priya. They're both extremely welcoming and helpful. Brendon made sure I knew exactly how to get everywhere and provided many suggestions of things I should check out. They're also wonderful to chat with. Their home is perfectly clean and comfortable just as it is described. I had a wonderful 4 night stay. The location is also very convenient to see many different parts of town. If I ever come back to Seattle, I'd definitely stay here again! "
7902569,44057432,2015-08-23,41627247,Stacy,Brendon was a great host. He was very welcoming and made us feel at home. The day we got there we received a tour of the house and he gave us great advice on places to visit in Seattle. We pretty much did all of them and was glad we took his advise. Last but not least I really liked how neat their home was and especially their decorations. Thank you Brandon. Overall it was a great first Airbnb experience. 
7902569,44237949,2015-08-24,3140037,Alex,I had a very nice welcome and good tips for the neighbourhood. The room was very good and I can highly recommend the stay.
7902569,44592835,2015-08-27,10356769,Tom,"Brendon's house is on a nice quiet street in a pleasant residential neighbourhood a really short drive south of The Junction.  The room and bathroom are both perfectly appointed with a really comfortable bed and an excellent shower, it's as close to staying in a really nice hotel as you could ask for!  Both Brendon and his wife were really nice, although due to busy schedules I didn't get to chat to them that much."
7902569,44736438,2015-08-28,28481999,Amanda,"Brendon and his wife's place was ideal for my trip to Seattle. I was able to easily get in and out, the location was perfect (easy to find, short commute to freeways) and the room was super cute. "
7902569,45544069,2015-09-03,6985734,Larissa,"Brendon was so welcoming and accomodating: he accepted our very last minute booking request, went out of his way to accomodate our schedule, and even drove us to our bus stop when it started to rain. He was always quick to respond to messages and figure things out. 

The room is gorgeous and comfortable, and guests have their own bathroom and amenities, so it really feels like home. The house itself is new and is in a beautiful, safe, and quiet residential area. With plenty of buses around, it's about 20 minutes to the downtown core of Seattle. 

Thanks for everything, Brendon!"
7902569,45739899,2015-09-05,33682080,Sam,"I had a nice, short stay with Brendon. His house is great, as well as in a great location outside the city. Hope to stay with him again my next time in town"
7902569,46017481,2015-09-07,40735504,Esmeralda,"This was my first airbnb experience with my friend who is also new to airbnb. 
Brendon and his wife were great hosts. Brendon was very flexible with the time of our arrival and welcomed us. He gave us a tour of the house and then showed us our room (looks exactly the same as the picture). Brendon then gave us awesome recommendations on what to do in Seattle (Capitol Hill, Alki Beach, etc.) 
My friend and I just needed a place to sleep as we were going to be out most of the day. Staying at their house was a perfect location. I would definitely recommend Brendon and his wife as hosts! "
7902569,46531683,2015-09-11,27014620,Younghee,Brenadon was waiting for me and explained everything and carried my bags.
7902569,46650631,2015-09-12,24981341,Erin,I enjoyed a wonderful stay in Seattle.  Thanks Brendon!  Everything was as described plus friendly and responsive hosts.  
7902569,47083846,2015-09-15,41961990,Bode,"Brendon is a great host. Let me step back...the picture on here is exactly how the room looks: a beautiful nice room with a private bathroom for guest. My wife and I enjoyed our stay at Brendon's place...it's close to downtown, just 20 minutes on the bus. The neighborhood is also great! Brendon recommended some great places to see in Seattle, good places to eat. 
I can't speak highly enough of how kind and friendly he and his wife are. My wife and I bonded with them, and we can say we made new friends. Thank you for being a great host. We are definitely looking to stay here again when we come back to visit the Emerald city.

p.s...sorry for the late review.  :)"
7902569,47232379,2015-09-16,18653767,Rongxiao,Very nice room with a great private guest bath! Good location too - 15min drive from downtown. Brandon's super helpful and made me feel right at home. Would definitely stay at Brandon's place again if I visit Seattle in the future.
7902569,47406890,2015-09-18,39280461,Regina,"We stayed one night at Brendon's and it was very comfortable with good queen size bed and airmatress. 
The room was clean and Brendon was very responsive.

One thing to note - you have to take a bus to downtown which takes 30mts roughly."
7902569,47746906,2015-09-21,41818415,Marco,I stayed 3nights. Very nice home. Comfortable bed and extra bathroom. All was clean and good smelling. To the centre/downtown by car/watertaxi it takes 15min. Brendon and his wife were very friendly and good hosts. Thanks!
7902569,48146009,2015-09-23,44539351,Eléonore,Brendon was super nice. I lost myself and arrived really late and he still welcomed me  kindly with a little dinner and conversation. The room was impeccably clean with an amazingly comfy bed. The bathroom was private as said in the add with products for the guests which I found enjoyable. I enjoyed my stay at this house and actually regret not having been able to say goodbye to Brendon in person.
7902569,48322025,2015-09-25,42548698,Lilli Und Jonas,"It was really great to stay at Brandon's and Jia's home. Sleeping room and bathroom were clean and very comfortable. Brandon and Jia are very friendly and we got helpful advices for our stay in Seattle. If we come back to Seattle, we would book this again :-)"
7902569,48466739,2015-09-26,2225240,Hannah,"Stayed one night and the room/bath were exactly as described. Room was clean and comfy, location was convenient to Alki Beach and downtown, and plenty of street parking. Sweet and friendly hosts; would stay here again!"
7902569,48646567,2015-09-27,4291506,Dayoung,"I took a quick trip to Seattle with my best friend and Brandon's place got everything we wanted. Clean, a private room and bathroom, free parking. 
The place is exact how it's looking on the photos and descriptions. They put effort to decorate the room really cozy and cute. 
Since we checked in and out when he wasn't at home however the process was very seamless and his response was very quick. 
At least we got a chance to introduce ourselves to his wife when she was just stepping out. She was very welcoming and sweet person. 
If you are looking for a place that's clean, safe and quiet in Seattle, I recommend Brandon's place. "
7902569,50859309,2015-10-15,40594268,Ki Ki,"Brendon has a very cozy and beautiful house. Just like the pictures he shows. We haven't met each other, but his sweet wife showed us the room. Very nice experience,but the bed maybe a bit little for two person."
7902569,51232154,2015-10-18,6378032,Lai,"My sister and I really appreciate how nice and accommodating Brendon and Jia were.  They were wonderful hosts.  Communication was great. 

We arrived in the middle of the night...much later than we had thought  we would after squeezing in a day trip to Vancouver --3 hours drive each way.  We went to see some family we hadn't seen in years.  I want to apologize to Brendon for keeping him up, waiting for our much delayed arrival.  This is a testament to what a nice and kind person he is.  He was concerned for our safety, driving back at such a late hour.  Had I known of his concern, I would have texted him and kept him posted.  So again, I am sorry for the lack of sleep that night.

The room and private bath were really  clean, tidy, and nice...just as pictured.  I was happy there was a large air bed in addition to the queen size real bed. The room has its own independent thermostat, which will be good in the winter.  I kindly suggested that they might consider putting a lock on the bedroom door, which long term guests might appreciate.

The house is the second one from the corner.  There is free street parking, and the bus to downtown Seattle is less than a ten minute walk.  The Google directions are okay, but one street name is missing where we had to make a turn so we got a little lost finding the place that first night.  If you need more specific directions like I do, Brendon will be more than happy to oblige. 

I highly recommend staying with Brendon and Jia.  They were lovely hosts with great accommodations. "
7902569,52725391,2015-11-01,18040158,Alexander,"Really fortunate to have picked Brendon's place for my 2 week visit to Seattle; staying with Brendon and his wife was more like staying with friends than just hosts. The house and room were beautiful and clean and fitted with everything I needed. I didn't have a car, but the other parts of the city were easily accessible by bus (the bus stop is short walk from the house). I definitely recommend staying with Brendon! "
7902569,53233659,2015-11-06,17728995,Frank,"Eine Nacht bei Brendon verbracht. Kurzfristige Buchung extrem schnell beantwortet. Check-in problemlos. Tolles Haus. Alles SEHR sauber. Tolles Bett - für amerik. Verhältnisse angenehm feste Matratze. Brendon und Pryia sind sehr nett und hilfsbereit. Prima Platz für Besuch von ""The Junction"" und Downton Seattle per Bus. Wirklich Klasse!"
7902569,53656066,2015-11-10,29441943,Paul,"Brendon and his wife greated me when I arrived.  They are very friendly people.  Being a ""digital nomad"" I had brought my 30 inch monitor and laptop with me.  Although it wasn't included in the setup, brenden offered me his office to work at during the day.  That was quite kind of him, and very useful, as I had an important deadline to hit.  The room and bed were immaculate - very clean and comforatable, as well as the bathroom.  The only caveat of this great place, is that I missed the fine print where the house rules stated that there is no use of the kitchen.  For the traveller that just needs a bed to sleep in, and a shower, (and possibly a free desk) this won't be a problem, but if you are trying to save costs with local groceries, or want to eat breakfast in the morning, you will need to find a restaurant. Unfortunately I didnt read this house rule before I arrived so  was unable to use the groceries I had brought with me from the previous Airbnb place. Brenden however  made a place for me to store them in his fridge.   Despite not being able to eat breakfast or dinners there, the place itself is quite comfy, and quiet close to downtown, and Brenden and Pria are very nice people, so u will get a good rest.  Thanks for letting me stay at your place Brendan."
7902569,54290386,2015-11-17,44508357,Daniela,"Thanks Priya and Brendon for being such lovely hosts. The accomodation was very comfortable and clean.
Hosts live in south West Seattle in a lovely and safe neighbourhood. Great if you have a car to explore lovely neighbourhood and California street. It was rain season whilst I was there so caught Uber/Taxi to down town Seattle a 15-20 min ride. Seattle was fantastic enjoyed brunch at the Space Needle and tour of Boeing Factory in Everett a must."
7902569,55959042,2015-12-07,40909379,Tiffany,"Brendon was a great host. I was in town for work and arrived late. He waited up for me and showed me around. He was very accommodating for items I needed to keep in their freezer. 
I had a very busy next couple of days. He left a smoothie and some walnuts on the kitchen counter for me in the morning. I so appreciated this because I was so busy I did not eat for the rest of the day! 
Their home was new, super clean and quiet. Which was perfect after traveling and a couple of exhausting work days! You have your own bathroom with nice shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. (This is important to women) 
Thank you so much for letting me stay with you guys. "
7902569,56074417,2015-12-08,44791556,Tony,Brendan's home was perfect for me and my one night stay. Not only that but he and his wife are genuinely nice folks are very caring. The room was very clean with not a speck of dust and the bathroom was clean and private. Brendon provided clear instructions and was there if I needed anything. I would not hesitate to stay here again. Thank you Brendon and Priya!
7902569,56212341,2015-12-10,5169497,Alexis,what u saw is what u got exactly. awesome stay with nice hosts. Its worth to try if u like quiet neiboughood. nice cozy room with your owe bath room. Lovely color decor. Brendon is warm and good host with his wife. Thanks for the sweet hosting. Will definitely see u soon!
7902569,56705589,2015-12-16,4953057,Marcela,Their home was very nice and the room was great. Definitely would stay here again.
7902569,56746755,2015-12-17,1661268,Héctor,The listing was described accurately. It is perfectly clean and comfortable. The place is located close to downtown West Seattle. It is easy to get to. Brendon was very responsive and made me feel welcome and comfortable. He accommodated my late arrival caused by a delayed flight by leaving the key to the house outside in a lock box. The neighborhood is very nice and safe. 
7902569,56879281,2015-12-19,19384546,Shreena,"I had visited Seattle for an interview and stayed with Brandon and Priya for 2 nights. Their house was beautiful and kept very clean. They were accommodating and ensured that I was comfortable in my room. I decided to take public transport from the airport to their house and it is possible, however it takes a long time. I had a pleasant experience staying here and would stay again if I find myself visiting Seattle."
6935953,42100716,2015-08-10,23109684,Tom,We had a wonderful time staying at Martins. How often do you get a private performance from a professional pianist at airbnb. The accommodations were great and Martin was a fantastic host. Highly recommend staying there while in Seattle. 
3728802,17646706,2014-08-15,19265360,Deborah,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this amazing home.  The welcome basket with maps, kid activities, Seattle's Best magazines, travel umbrellas for change in weather, was just the tip of the iceberg.  The home was very comfortable, had any amenity you could wish for, and a welcoming, comfortable, family centered feel.  It was spotlessly clean.  The guest information book was very thorough.  We spent much of our days out and about, to return to a chef's kitchen with amazing view!  We saw eagles soaring by the porch several evenings.  The neighborhood was quiet, lovely, and very safe.  Beds were perfectly suited to our group, the playroom was a special treat for our 6 & 8 year old boys, and the media room next to our niece's room was her hangout haven in the evenings.   This home was situated in a convenient proximity to reach anywhere you may wish to go while staying in Seattle.  Pam was full of wonderful suggestions that we took advantage of - parks, restaurants, activities - all of which panned out as 5 star for us.   We wholeheartedly recommend this listing and hope to stay again when the opportunity arises!"
3728802,18817292,2014-09-01,6123094,Nick,Great Location short drive to Seattle sites with nice view. Lots of space and very nice kitchen.  Very nice bathrooms that have been well updated. Overall a pleasant stay. 
3728802,45123103,2015-08-31,16908181,Eric,"Pam went over and above to provide information about visiting both the local area and Seattle more generally. Communicating with her was quick and easy. The home is a delight. Beautiful and comfortable home. Beautiful view. Very interesting neighborhood of eclectic and very nice homes in a hilly section overlooking a large lake. There are very good restaurants that are walking distance. Downtown is a very short drive. We could not have asked for more. Without any reservation, we would highly recommend staying at this home."
4539948,24007797,2014-12-16,22857371,Brittni,"Parking was a little challenging, location was great. The place was pretty small as advertised, but it is really small for a tall person. Overall, it was a fun place to stay but I would only recommend it to a single person, or a short couple."
4539948,24382402,2014-12-27,23098497,David,"Rachel's apartment was just what we were looking for during the holidays, an apartment tastefully unique and cozy for two!  Rachel was also great host and very easy to  communicate with, she was able to drop off the keys easily and was there if we had any questions.  Thank you Rachel for sharing your beautiful home with us and also thanks for the  Brioche! "
4539948,25139589,2015-01-07,3114316,Anya,"Thanks for a great stay. My parents enjoyed it. Place was clean and just like in the pictures. It's tiny but cozy and worked for what they needed it. It would probably not work for people who are over age of 60 or have a hard time climbing a ladder, but it's great for anybody between 15 and 60 :) Neighborhood is rather quiet and easy to get around, super close to Pike/Pine corridor and the great things it offers. "
4539948,25274454,2015-01-11,24427568,Chie,"It was me and my partner's first time in Seattle, and staying in Rachel's cozy apartment really made our stay more special!! Rachel had food, coffee, tea, and even a parking pass if you brought a car. The location was within walking distance of many resteraunts and shops, and close to bus stops. We never met in person, but Rachel was very communicative through texts and made sure we were having a nice stay. "
4539948,25833424,2015-01-26,1390227,Sean,"My wife and I loved our stay at Rachel's apartment.  It has a great view and a very eclectic style. The bed is lofted over the kitchen and has a great porthole window with a view of the city it was super fun.  In the kitchen was small but functional the bathroom was surprisingly large. It's in a great neighborhood with plenty of shops and restaurants within walking distance.  If you don't need much space if you actually enjoy well laid out small homes this apartment is a real treat.
Communication with Rachel was excellent she took good care of us.
"
4539948,26031242,2015-02-01,26087088,Ashley,"A perfect location! Nice neighborhood and just a short walk to some pretty great nightlife, drinks and food. Rachel was super nice and Accommodating. So cute and relaxing! "
4539948,26267252,2015-02-08,26626125,Frances,"What a beautiful, wonderful apartment. My boyfriend and I stayed here and it was perfect. It was within walking distance of the city and the perfect dinner, bar, lunch, or breakfast spots. The area is charming if you are looking to stay close or you can easily head downtown or to close neighborhoods. Rachel was extremely pleasant and accommodating and we loved how cozy the apartment was. It felt like home. "
4539948,26930393,2015-02-22,4984527,James,"Rachel was very warm and welcoming when my friend and I arrived to her lovely apartment! It was a bit late in the evening, just shy of 9 o'clock, but she didn't mind and even stayed and chatted for a bit before giving us some recommendations for a place to get a beer after our drive up from Portland.

The apartment was perfect for us, and just as described. It was so comfy we almost didn't want to explore Seattle! But we managed to drag ourselves out of the lofted bed with its amazing views of the skyline (you really can see the Space Needle from the little port-hole window up there!) and take in as much as we could in our time there.

We'll definitely be coming back, thanks Rachel!"
4539948,27705215,2015-03-09,28845486,Howie,"Rachel was a great host. Open to suggestions and always quick to reply to any questions or concerns in an instance. She'll greet you with a smile and is cool as a cucumber. The loft can be only described with one word, cozy. Quiet little neighborhood in which is not too far from other locations be it through walking,  transit, or by car. Had a great stay and would definitely come back. "
4539948,28246575,2015-03-21,24340509,Kristina,"This little loft was exactly what we were hoping for. It was in the perfect location - we were able to comfortable walk everywhere, and it was very cozy indeed. We never got to meet Rachel, but she made herself very available over her many friendly messages if we had any questions. Overall everything was exactly as I had expected. "
4539948,28344222,2015-03-22,28825990,Tom,"This apartment was exactly as described, and was just right for my short stay. Very cozy and comfortable. I would stay there again. Great books. Quiet residential neighborhood yet close to the Capital Hill action."
4539948,28670522,2015-03-28,24992052,Kat,"Rachel was a great host. She answered messages very promptly and was very flexible about changing the check-in time after I had to take a later flight (and waiting when it took me quite a bit longer than anticipated due to the bus not running frequently in the evening). 
The apartment was lovely--small but not at all cramped, with a full-size bathroom and a comfy bed (I loved how it was in its own little loft up a ladder, but this might be problematic for those with mobility issues). I did not cook but the kitchen seemed well-equipped. It had a very calm and restful atmosphere, a great view of Seattle, and was true to pictures. I wish I had more time to enjoy the balcony and the library--we happened to have a lot of the same books :)
Finally, I absolutely loved the neighborhood. I was attending a conference that took place at the Sheraton downtown, and the apartment was a 25 minute walk away (exactly as Rachel had told me). Anywhere downtown was easy to get to on foot, but I actually found the Capitol Hill neighborhood to be much more pleasant--plenty of great restaurants, cafés, bars, a Coop with a good food and wine/beer selection, etc., all within a few blocks from the apartment. The apartment itself, however, was in a peaceful and quiet street full of blooming trees and flowers. I felt safe walking around, even at night. 
I already want to come back--thanks, Rachel!"
4539948,29071346,2015-04-03,5273147,Nathanael,"I found the loft to be beyond my expectations, and Rachel was a great host. She accommodated my later check-in time with no hassles whatsoever, and I appreciated her communicativeness. 

The loft was clean and homey, and I loved the ambiance and view. I found the location to be very convenient, with everything that I needed within walking distance, and I felt completely safe. 

It was only as I was checking-out that I realized that she had provided fresh baked muffins — a very thoughtful gift!  "
4539948,29650040,2015-04-10,6472022,Chris,"We had a good time staying in the loft apt. It is indeed a cozy little apartment. I liked especially the fact that it is within easy walking distance of a lot of fun breweries, bars, and restaurants, and yet located in a quiet residential neighborhood.
Rachel was very prompt to answer any questions, and met us early so we could drop off our bags.
We didn't use the kitchen (see aforementioned easy walking distance to restaurants) but it was there if necessary.
All in all a fun stay."
4539948,29841347,2015-04-13,28834308,Lindsey,"Wonderful place to stay!  Pictures were very accurate to the space provided.  It was in a fantastic area steps away from all types of restaurants, bars , stores you name it.  Location felt very secure and safe.  Balcony was had great view of downtown.  Rachel had thought of every thing one might need it was great!  Apartment was very clean and everything was easy to find."
4539948,30168654,2015-04-18,3604222,Paul,"Rachel was an exceptional host and very patient and thoughtful in answering all questions. The loft itself is wonderful - great space, cozy, and relaxing. I would gladly return to this place again."
4539948,30266097,2015-04-19,28138961,Christine,Rachel was so accommodating when I came to arrival times and being available for us if we needed anything. The stay was quick and easy!
4539948,30707373,2015-04-26,7788449,Mia,Rachel's place was very sweet! My boyfriend and I stayed only for one night and it was perfect for our short visit. Rachel was very kind and accommodating. We would book Rachel's place again! 
4539948,30790633,2015-04-27,9374856,Patrick,"We had a great stay at Rachel's apartment. The space is small but thoughtfully furnished, comfortable and very clean. The neighbourhood has lots of character and is only a short walk to downtown. Rachel was very accommodating and easy to get in touch with. Definitely a great place to stay, highly recommended!"
4539948,33120697,2015-05-25,31550168,Stacey,"Rachel was accessible by email and answered all questions I had promptly. The apartment was clean and neat. Rachel made me feel at home by leaving breakfast items in the fridge and leaving a clear list of house instructions, and info on Seattle, maps, transportation options, etc. the neighborhood is charming and close to downtown."
4539948,33831483,2015-06-01,26052666,Heather,Rachel has a charming little apartment in a very walkable neighborhood! She was flexible with our check-in and out times and made us feel welcome and trusted in her home. My husband and I enjoyed our stay!   
4539948,34369039,2015-06-07,34695511,Sahil,Everything was great and as Rachel described. Loft was in a fantastic neighborhood and in the heart of everything. 
4539948,35387852,2015-06-18,19824483,Martha,"I had a wonderful in Seattle, and Rachel's place was a nice 'home' away from home. Perfect for one person. Rachel was great with communications and answering questions. I would definitely stay here again. "
4539948,36229147,2015-06-26,9869043,Macarena,"My husband and I stayed for 5 nights and had a great experience. The apartment is located in a great neighborhood, very quiet but walking distance to great cafes and restaurants. Very clean and great communication with Rachel."
4539948,38417658,2015-07-15,23589733,Dj,"Rachel did a fantastic job of keeping in touch prior to my arrival and coordinating with me for key exchange - true to her word in every respect, and easy to work with.

Pictures and description of Cozy are accurate.

Especially enjoyed the numerous restaurants and bars within easy walking distance. Make sure you try Skillet for breakfast!"
4539948,39273599,2015-07-22,26842599,Julie,"Rachel had arranged for a friend to meet me at her flat and he was a charm even though my flight had been seriously delayed. The place has a great vibe (great book collection!), the location was perfect (quiet but close to everything you can think of) and Rachel had left a comprehensive note about what I needed to know to have a great stay. We also kept in touch by email during my whole stay, which is reassuring. I would totally recommend this place and stay there again!"
4539948,41347362,2015-08-07,33585608,Ben,"My wife and I had a lovely stay at Rachel's place. The apartment looks even better in person and makes very clever use of the limited space. There was a bit of a heat wave (by PNW standards) during our stay, which made the ability to dine al fresco on the balcony very refreshing. 

Rachel was very kind to stock the fridge with breakfast essentials and accomodate our late arrival and departure times. She provided great instructions and tips to navigate the city that proved extremely useful for rookies like us. Don't under estimate the importance of having a parking pass in Seattle!"
4539948,42673544,2015-08-15,13504007,Trent,"The listing almost doesn't say enough about this place.  It's in a neighborhood near Seattle University, Capitol Hill area, about two blocks from a bike rental station, and is about a 20-minute walk to downtown.  It's not a big place, but I wasn't there to spend time in the apartment.  Great location, nice porch facing west, and the Rachel was extremely accommodating (she waited quite late for my flight to arrive on the way in).  I'd recommend this place.  "
4539948,45307538,2015-09-01,4373951,Ryan,"Rachel was very accommodating when checking in and out, and her apartment was wonderfully decorated. It was a great spot for us, even with no wifi, since we were primarily sleeping there and out and about for the majority of the trip."
4539948,47835994,2015-09-21,38562822,Parker,This was a great place to stay in the perfect neighborhood. The porch area and the porthole lookout window by the bed were nice touches. I highly recommend this listing. Great and walkable neighborhood.
4539948,49560352,2015-10-04,23052990,Alex,Rachel worked well with our schedule to check in and was there at the apartment to give us a breakdown of the home/neighborhood and to answer any questions that we had. The place was exactly what we were looking for. The view of the Seattle Skyline was beautiful from the porthole in the loft and while on the balcony. We would definitely stay again if Rachel would have us!
4539948,51351165,2015-10-19,24424408,Cate,"Staying in the cozy loft was great as it was convenient enough to downtown and close to interesting places to browse and eat, not to mention the fabulous view from the balcony which is a great private space to unwind! Staying at the loft studio really was about staying in a little home which for me was a nice change from a hotel. I will just note that the climb to the loft bed was novel and quite fun but might not work for anyone with mobility issues or vertigo!"
4539948,54145737,2015-11-16,2553571,Alex,"This was a very nice apartment in which to spend a few days in Seattle- the neighborhood is great (quiet, yet close to everything in Capitol Hill), and Rachel provided tons of information on the city and region at large. Highly recommended."
4539948,55476460,2015-12-01,48977997,Cici,"Very lovely cozy loft!! If you're looking for a cozy place to relax yourself during vacation, here is the best choice. It's only couple minutes drive to downtown. And there is nice view from the balcony. Everything in this room is so cute. Rachel would be so nice to answer your question."
4518037,22940345,2014-11-17,3040743,Vadim,Very beautiful house with nice and cosy bedroom. 
4518037,23001996,2014-11-19,3040743,Vadim,Nice place.
4518037,23620326,2014-12-06,24407883,Daisy,"Celine's home was so warm and welcoming. It is a beautiful home and Celine has added a lot of lovely details to make it really comforting. The room itself was really cosy and comfortable, and absolutely perfect, especially at the price. The decor and the little touches also makes it feel like home. She was also incredibly accommodating, even when I was late checking in, and gave me good directions and advice on exploring Seattle. "
4518037,23739509,2014-12-08,5553545,Yvonne,"The room itself was clean, comfortable, beautiful and neat. The couple are friendly,  quiet and easy going. Would absolutely recommend them as hosts."
4518037,24194490,2014-12-22,6929374,Caila,"I spent 9 nights at Celine and Kurt's place, and it was the best Airbnb experience I have had to date! Celine and Kurt were super friendly and welcoming and treated me like a roommate. They even included me in a game night they had! They have a lovely, playful cat, but she won't bother you if you don't like cats. Their house is absolutely beautiful and just fun to be in. They've provided a radiator in your room, so you can keep it as cool or toasty as you'd like.  The house is right next to the bus stop and about a 30min bus ride (or 45min bike ride) to downtown. There are plenty of excellent and diverse dining options within walking or biking distance (1.5-4 miles) including some excellent vegetarian and vegan choices (I highly recommend Georgetown Liquor Company). Overall I had a wonderful experience and would recommend their place to any visitors. "
4518037,24690438,2015-01-01,21817992,Jinle,It is so excited to live in a house which is a hundred years old! Cozy room and nice host impressed me! Celine and her husband made my trip in Seattle special. Thanks for buy me a cola haha. I will be back again.
4518037,24789508,2015-01-02,19205932,Dolly,"This is my 1st experience of using Airbnb to book a room and I had a very pleasant stay at Celine and Kurt's home. Their home is very clean and neat, and the couple is very friendly and the cute cat is friendly as well! I would love to recommend their home to my friends, if they come to Seattle and want to find a nice and comfort place convenient to  downtown. "
4518037,25118037,2015-01-06,60623,Robin,"Céline and Kurt's home is every bit as beautiful, clean, and tidy as it appears in their listing's photos, and I found my room upstairs to be very cozy and comfortable. 

Because my hours were completely out of alignment with her weekday ones, I never got to meet Céline but her gracious presence was still felt through her generous correspondence with me. My arrival at their house was more complicated to arrange than many others she must deal with, and she was very kind and patient with me throughout. Kurt is the one who greeted me, showed me around, made sure I had what I needed, and was very polite and nice with me. (Mademoiselle) Domino, the cat, is very affectionate and playful so if you like cats, you're in for a treat :-)

It's about a half hour bus ride on the 36 from Céline's into the downtown. This bus runs right past the Amtrak station on South Jackson and the International District-Chinatown light rail station (a terminus of the light rail line is the SeaTac airport) before running well into the city's central commercial district, along 3rd Ave to about Stewart before turning south again. I found the convenience of this public transport option to be terrific: very simple.

I would definitely stay here again and recommend their place to others!"
4518037,25451620,2015-01-16,20625967,Yumiko,"Celine and her husband Kart were at home and welcomed me when I arrived there. They were very friendly and nice to me. And there was also their cute, friendly and very quiet cat, Domino.
 The house was decorated with cute pink furnitures and it was really clean and comfortable as it was shown on their page. I loved it! My room was also a cute room with comfortable bed. And she brought me a heater which made my room very warm.  I was out most time of my staying, but I had a nice conversation time with them couple times. They told me their recommendations of Seattle and gave me some advice. It helped me a lot since I didn't know about Seattle and was traveling alone. They love Seattle and know many things about Seattle. They are great hosts and I really enjoyed staying there with them! "
4518037,25868604,2015-01-27,10032119,Edward,"Really nice place, only stayed for a night but Celine and Kurt were very welcoming. Good location near Georgetown. Thanks guys!"
4518037,25978651,2015-01-31,26113707,Shaoshan,"I very like the pink bedroom, which has pink table lamp, pink carpet, and pink wall.  Also, Celine and her husband are very friendly. "
4518037,26170303,2015-02-05,27003957,Anna,Great stay. Very convenient and easy. Thank you! 
4518037,26433245,2015-02-12,799090,Kristen,I only stayed a day with Celine before my flight out the next afternoon.  Check-in was extremely easy.  Her place was just as listed and very welcoming!  Great stay especially for the price!
4518037,26811680,2015-02-19,27871141,Brittney,"I had a lovely first airbnb experience staying in this charming home. The reservation was made last minute, but I was graciously welcomed by Celine and her husband, Kurt. If I'm ever in need of a place to stay in Seattle, I will definitely be booking this place again. Perfect little room, well maintained home in a central location, amazing shower, and a playful cat are some of the extra perks of this place, next to Celine and Kurt being really sweet hosts. "
4518037,29535026,2015-04-08,30562505,Andrea,"I was here for a job interview at the Seattle VA and the location was perfect!! (FYI- if you need to head to the VA, it's definitely walkable, but I also took the 36 bus to the hospital- costs $1.25 and only takes ~10 min. Bus stop is only 2 or 3 blocks from their house!) 

My flight came in the morning but check-in wasn't until late afternoon so they let me drop my stuff off early in their garage then I spent the day checking out local coffee shops and restaurants. 

And Celine and Kurt were the best hosts possible! Spent one of the nights eating dinner together and just chatting- they are the nicest Seattle natives I've ever met ;) We also bonded over our favorite blogs and thrifting!! (Of which Celine is the best.)"
4518037,32792667,2015-05-21,32010690,Chris,"Céline was an exceptional host. Even after a slight misunderstanding on my part she was super helpful and welcoming. Her home was beautiful and catered to my needs as far as my stay was concerned perfectly. 
She was very helpful and good fun to talk with. 
A+ host. "
4518037,33403248,2015-05-27,1915311,Lauren,"Celine and Kurt's house is exactly as pictured--very cute and well-kept.  Celine took time out to chat with me when I got there and before I left, which I thought was cool.  And their cat is super sweet!  It's easy to take the bus into town (about a half-hour ride, give or take).  The room I stayed in was cute--it does exactly what you need it to, gives you a place to put your stuff and sleep.  The house is up the hill from Georgetown, where there are a lot of great bars and restaurants--that's about 15-20 minutes' walk.  My only problem with this rental is that there is another guest bedroom for two people and another roommate in the house, so when I stayed there, there were anywhere from 4-6 people sharing one downstairs bathroom (the guest bedrooms are upstairs).  I wasn't aware of this going into the reservation.  Other than that, I had a good experience.  Thanks to Celine and Kurt!"
4518037,34174906,2015-06-05,595039,Susan,"The Perfect Airbnb: Céline and her husband were so wonderful! They were very welcoming and warm, and their beautiful home is absolutely charming, and just as pictured. I wish my house looked this pretty! The house is immaculate, with an impressive pink fridge (centerpiece of the house). The single room I stayed in was so cozy. I had two very good sleeps here. The bathroom was also very clean, and the water pressure was perfect. Thank you for the clean towel! 

Upon arrival, I was offered a tour of the house, and Céline very thoughtfully lent me a few tour books and walking maps of Seattle, which was so helpful for me! I used the books the very next day, walking for hours through hilly Seattle. 

The little backyard and front porch are so picturesque, and I enjoyed reading as the sun went down in the back. The public transit is an easy, hassle-free ride into downtown. 

Céline was very fast at getting back to me, and was helpful at offering transit advise and suggestions. Thank you Céline for your  generous hospitality! Hope you enjoyed the wine! :) 

I heartily recommend you stay with Céline and her husband! It's really the perfect Airbnb."
4518037,34746113,2015-06-11,35021608,Keith,"Céline was very friendly and welcoming into her home.  She was willing to be very accomidating and helpful.  Unfortantly my schedule kept me busy and I didn't see Céline very much.  The time that I did she was very friendly.

The house was beautiful and well kept. "
4518037,38183776,2015-07-13,21935070,Roni,My stay at Celine home was very nice! Their home was very clean and tidy always. Exactly as they describe it it in the listing.
4518037,39224006,2015-07-21,30366795,Mark,"Charming home and very comfortable room, everything as described in rooms profile. Celine and her husband are friendly and accommodating hosts. I recommend this home!"
4518037,43542673,2015-08-20,40055246,Christian,"I arrived pretty late, so I didn't get to talk to Céline and Kurt much. But they were very friendly and flexible, showed me their beautiful place, and my room under the ceiling and let me go asleep. So: Friendly, flexible, uncomplicated, nice → perfect!"
4518037,44742880,2015-08-28,406904,Sweta,"Celine's home was the perfect crash pad for me. I was in town for just one night and was set up in the smaller of the two rooms in the attic. Small details like the Wifi network and password near the bed and granola bars in the kitchen were a nice touch. Both her and her husband are very sweet, the home is cozy and in a quiet neighborhood, and I had a great experience.

 "
4518037,46834837,2015-09-13,14253214,Minh,"Céline's place was absolutely lovely! The pictures really don't do it justice because you can't see all the neat little details that are beautifully put together by the host. Céline and her husband also made me feel right at home and gave me great advices for touring around Seattle. The bus was close by and very straightforward to take to downtown. Even if you Uber from the downtown area, it would only cost ~$15. I would definitely recommend Céline's place!"
4518037,47232678,2015-09-16,38039590,Elizabeth,Celine was there to greet me when I arrived and gave a tour to ensure I knew where everything was that I might need. She also had suggestions on places to go.
4518037,48156625,2015-09-23,1268518,Xia,"Céline and kurt are wonderful host! And the home is definitely one of a kind experience ;) Wish I could stay longer but they were fully booked until my departure date :'( 
So, If you are the lucky one, don't let it go! 
"
4518037,48354049,2015-09-25,16976615,Lori,"Super lovely, designer caliber decorated house. Everything was really pretty and the home was immaculate. Since I was in Seattle for work, I came in the middle of the week, and therefore spent no time with Celine and had a brief conversation with Kurt. Everyone seems very nice. 
The room was perfect for one single short statured person, who can climb a small flight of stairs. It was decorated nicely and certainly was cozy. 
There were some limitations to using the shared bathroom and what to eat/prepare in the kitchen (no soda or sticky stuff). And no shoes in the house (I was told this immediately). Like I said, the house is immaculate. Bring a flashlight to find the house numbers if you arrive after 9:30pm (I passed by it twice since the house was dark and since I told them my delayed arrival time, didn't think they'd shut off the outside lights). Kurt kindly oriented me to the space.
In spite of all these parameters, this situation seemed to fit well for what I needed during my brief trip to Seattle and with a work reason to be in town. 
For anyone who wants a little more social interaction or a feeling of connection with people who live in Seattle, this may not be match for you. For the fully independent person who eats out the entire time, and only needs a (very pretty) crash pad - this place is highly recommended."
4518037,48961141,2015-09-29,3537013,Jesse,Great location good communication. 
4518037,49577700,2015-10-04,41140233,Paul,"I had a great 2 night stay with Celine and Kurt! The house is very clean, furnished with a great love for detail and just 15 minutes away from downtown Seattle (by bus). You can either keep to yourself but also have funny, interesting conversations with both them. I'd stay there again!"
4518037,50734224,2015-10-13,38550477,Lydia,Very comfortable and cute attic room  congenial host pleasant environment. Easy parking close to eating and shopping. Easy drive into downtown. 
4518037,52164541,2015-10-26,43832582,Xin,"Yes they are very nice. Highly recommend to those who do not have a car, because the bus is very convenient and only takes no more than 20 minutes getting to downtown!"
4518037,53547721,2015-11-09,47290638,Priscilla,Céline and her husband were very welcoming and shared some wonderful suggestions for dinner. The room was neat and looked exactly like the photos included in the profile. Bathroom was also clean. It was a convenient drive to downtown and some delicious restaurants.  I was in town for training that took up most of my day so I did not get to interact with Céline and her husband too much but they were very friendly when we did. They were very quiet. The room was perfect for a solo getaway. Thank you again for the hospitality! 
4518037,54404868,2015-11-19,36047320,Jiwon,"혼자 지내기에 아주 편하고 좋았어요! 별다른 터치도 없고 버스 정류장도 가까워서 시내 다니기도 괜찮아요! 근데 시애틀 자체가 딱히 할일이 없고 계속 비가 와서 겨울보다 여름 방문을 추천 합니당! ㅎㅎ
I stayed so well. They are very kind and easy-going. I was very comfortable. And close to bus stop. Also room was really cute and lovely. Thanks!! :)"
4518037,57073205,2015-12-21,50837086,Jien,"Great experience with Celine and Kurt. They are warm and nice. They provided me tourism and transportation information, which was very helpful. The house is very clean. Felt like staying in my own apartment. "
180939,409823,2011-07-31,873834,Rachel,I stayed in this apartment while I was in Seattle house-hunting. Molly and her husband Stacey were incredibly gracious and kind hosts. The studio (built by Molly!) is absolutely beautiful and peaceful. They also live in a great part of town that was really convenient for travelling around Seattle. I would stay there again and I wish I could rent this space out to live in!! It really is wonderful. 
180939,424363,2011-08-06,818076,Jalo,"Mollys studio flat was an amazing place to have a holiday. We really enjoyed all the beautiful details during those ten days we stayed there. Molly is also a great host and such a nice person. The local bus (#4) stops right in front of the house which was very convienient. And only a short distant from the house in Madrona area there are lovely restaurants and cosy cafées: we loved ""June"" or the Cupcake coffee place. We would definately recommend this place for everyone!"
180939,444484,2011-08-14,903550,Robyn,"Molly's studio is peaceful, clean and full of character.   More importantly, Molly is a terrific host, a genuinely nice person, easy to communicate with, and very generous with the ""extras.""  I rented this studio for my parents and upon their arrival, Molly had left a bottle of wine, cheese, crackers, fruit, and homemade chutney.  She was always available to answer their questions, make suggestions, and just be nice and friendly.  This place is very reasonably priced, great location for public transportation and within walking distance of a cafe, a farmers market, a grocery store, lots of parks, etc.  Thanks Molly!  "
180939,463178,2011-08-21,211825,Cherie,"Molly and Stacy were excellent hosts; they even had a yummy snack for me when I arrived. The studio is bright, clean, and in a good location. Everything is new. The kitchen has most of the basics (no microwave or coffee maker, which was not a problem for me). I would contact them again when is Seattle."
180939,472429,2011-08-24,575547,Karen,"Molly and her family were awesome hosts. They greeted us with a fresh-from-the-farmer's-market snack. We enjoyed getting to know them during our chat in their garden. Molly created quite a cute, well-situated guest space. The washer/dryer and well-equipped kitchen were a big plus. Their house is within walking distance to several markets, restaurants and parks. "
180939,479203,2011-08-27,79971,ChingChi,"This location is on Union and 26th.  It has convenient bus No2 to take you to down town and back forth.

I took bus from this place to Aqaurium, Tacoma City (2 days in a row), Pike Market, Bainbridge Island.  

You will have no problem to take just public transportation to go back and forth.

If you don't care street noise (occasional cars and passengers) and loud laundry machines (only when you use it) , this is a super convenient base camp for you to go exploring the city while you can be self sufficient with your cleaning need and grocery shopping (just 2 blocks away, there is a super market and a farmer's market on Friday).

The street parking is easy as well.

The hosts were outgoing (they surely talk and look sweet, since we didn't get a chance to hang out, I can't say more than that) for the first 2 hours we met.  Their 5 years old daughter was surely a sweet doll (personality wise).  

I'll definitely try to stay here again when I come up here again.  It's so nice that I will take my mom to come here to stay, too. "
180939,520513,2011-09-11,898129,Floyd J,"We really enjoyed our stay with Molly and Stacy. The studio apartment was a convenient location for us and our family.We were able to come and go at our leisure  with a private entrance. The apartment was well furnished with everything to meet our needs. Molly and Stacy were great hosts and we would definitely stay there again, and highly recommend it to others. Floyd"
180939,575664,2011-09-27,697500,Jackie,"Super charming and very clean studio with all the necessities including full kitchen, hot shower, and washer/dryer.  Molly and Stacy are gracious hosts (had wine and fruit upon our arrival!), and their kids are adorable :)  The location is convenient, and there is a cafe around the corner.  We had a rental car, and parking on the street was easy.  All in all, the studio definitely exceeded our expectations for our first AirBnB experience."
180939,1059171,2012-03-29,1929013,Kathleen,"Beautiful clean apartment! Nice neighborhood within walking distance to the city bus line.  Very home like setting.  
No TV/Radio
Noisy in the AM from tenents above.
Owners are very friendly."
180939,1104908,2012-04-10,1382492,Jenny,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Molly's studio. It was clean and light, and a pleasant place to hang out and relax for a long weekend. When we weren't out making the most of the good weather, we spent our time curled up on the couch with books. I should also add that the location was a perfect base for exploring the city on foot.

Molly and Stacy and their daughters were super friendly and welcoming, and hope we can catch up with them again."
180939,1130048,2012-04-14,1639347,Amy,Molly was absolutely wonderful!  She responded to our immediate need of lodging and made the stay very enjoyable.  The Garden Studio was located exactly where we needed to be in Seattle to make possible a suprise visit with our son!  Thanks Molly!
180939,1184585,2012-04-26,1971222,Cassie,"It was very nice staying at Molly's.  I enjoyed getting to know Molly, Stacey and Ursula a little bit.  What a nice family!  The studio is quite spacious and light with a lovely kitchen.  And I really enjoyed exploring on foot this part of Seattle.  Twice I walked up the hill to Madrona and then wound my way down through a very interesting neighborhood until I ended up in Madison Park.  Great walks!"
180939,1257602,2012-05-10,2026226,Natalie,"What a warm, comfortable (and beautifully designed by Molly) space. Very private and quiet with a feeling of spaciousness although being compact-- and well equipped for cooking, washing and drying clothes, relaxing in the garden. Wonderful bathroom. We had a great time visiting with the family when we met them in the garden. Bus line very convenient, great restaurant up the street. Highly recommended! Nan and Joe from Virginia"
180939,1286628,2012-05-15,2080252,Rohan,"We had a fantastic time in Seattle with not a rainy day over the entire stay. Molly's studio was excellent, spotless, with a lot of care and pride taken in its creation and maintenance. Water was hot, everything worked and Molly managed to provide a portacot for our infant son which was greatly appreciated. The location was great for us with the no.2 bus going from Union Street to the city center only a block away from the Pikes Place market and the no.8 bus going from MLK direct to the Sky Needle. Good coffee only a block away and a grocery outlet within sight down the alley."
180939,1441987,2012-06-09,1966097,Andie,"My husband and I loved our stay at Molly’s ‘Central District Green GardenStudio’. The apartment is terrific, incredibly cozy with a very clean and modern decor. Molly and her family were wonderful hosts and accommodating with our travel times. When we arrived we were greeted with a bottle of wine and some flowers from their garden. When staying here you are close to a great spots and Capital Hill is a nice walk away. You can catch the bus right on the corner of the street and be anywhere in Seattle in about 5-20 minutes. Staying here really made our stay and visit to Seattle a wonderful experience, we highly recommend this spot to anyone looking to visit the area! Thanks again Molly and family!!"
180939,1586418,2012-06-29,2167544,Joy,"Molly and her family did everything possible to make my week in Seattle a pleasant, uncomplicated one. The apartment was delightful and had everything I could ask for. The location was great. I was able to walk to a coffee shop on the next block or make my own in the apartment. I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone. I will certainly stay with Molly and her family again when in Seattle.
Thanks Molly!"
180939,1620913,2012-07-03,2382552,Ariel,"This was a very beautiful place. She provided a pack and play for our baby and a bottle of wine for us. She was very friendly and it was easy to find the place and the key. Highly recommend. The neighborhood is nice, but not the type of place you would like to walk around alone late around at night."
180939,1685232,2012-07-11,2692570,Jennifer,"nice host family, room and red wine.  if you are looking for a comfortable home in seattle, you can check this bnb.  we enjoy it.  "
180939,1728959,2012-07-17,1925730,David,We had a wonderful stay! Molly and her family were awesome! The day we arrived there was a wonderful farmer's market setup at the grocery store at the end of the block where we picked up some amazing treats. We loved being close enough to walk the area yet far enough to be a bit outside the city!
180939,1835881,2012-07-30,2437203,Blythe,"My fiance and I were in Seattle looking for apartments to relocate and absolutely loved staying with Molly and Stacey--they're a super sweet family, adorable kids and a great studio.  It's bright and clean, close to everything but far enough away to be quite and serene.  Highly recommend staying here in Seattle--can walk to downtown and great restaurants (Bottlehouse, Caffe Presse, etc) "
180939,1945891,2012-08-11,1318728,Emily,"My husband, two year old daughter, and I had a great time in Seattle visiting family for a wedding. We loved staying in the cozy studio in the central district. Molly and Stacey graciously provided a pack and play bed for my daughter and their children were wonderful playmates to my daughter on the first days of our stay. The studio is surprisingly quiet and peaceful given its close proximity to modern urban conveniences. There is off-street parking or bus stops close by. The studio is small but well designed, beautifully lit and efficient. The ceilings of the studio are low but were high enough to reasonably accommodate my husband who is 6'3"". The back garden is cute and cozy and a nice place to relax in the evenings. I highly recommend this studio for any couple or small family hoping to stay in Seattle."
180939,1958867,2012-08-12,222387,Jenny,"Molly was a wonderful host. She gave us beers and delicious Cherry Cider to welcome us and even gave us some to go. 

The place was very clean and well designed. It's much more spacious than if you were to stay at a hotel. It was a quick 5 minute drive to get to the Seattle waterfront and Pike's Place. 

"
180939,2054200,2012-08-21,2844144,Jess & Steve,"It was an absolute pleasure staying at the Garden Studio.  Molly and her family made sure we had everything we needed and were very helpful with any questions we had.  They were extremely nice and very easy to get along with.  We wish we had gotten more time to talk with them, but we were constantly on the go!  The studio was very clean and comfortable. Plenty of space, lots of natural light, and a comfy bed!  I would definitely suggest their studio to anyone visiting the Seattle area.  Thanks for making our stay a great one!"
180939,2072558,2012-08-23,2812603,Justin,"My girlfriend and I had an excellent stay at Molly's Green Garden Studio. Molly and her family were very friendly and inviting. The studio was clean, modern and had a number of architectural details that I found quite interesting. Also, the location was perfect for our visit to Seattle. It was a short drive (or bus ride) to downtown plus there were plenty of close by amenities such as restaurants, bars, markets even a coffee shop within walking distance from the studio. After a day full of playing tourist in/around the city center it was really nice to be able to retreat to one of the nearby neighborhood bars or restaurants to unwind at the end of the day."
180939,2095948,2012-08-25,1852186,Jessica,"My husband and I had a lovely time in this studio basement apartment. Our hosts provided us with beer and peanuts upon arrival and even gave us homemade scones fresh out of the oven when we left! A very convenient and nice location not too far from downtown- super convenient. 
One thing to be aware of (and this is not to be picky or anything, just what I would have liked to have known before our stay)- bare in mind that this is in the basement of the owners' home and with two young children you should know to expect a good amount of foot traffic happening directly above, so if you wish to sleep in past 7:00 a.m., don't count on it... Again, not a complaint, just a head's up. Otherwise, a lovely home with excellent accommodations and attractions nearby!  "
180939,2228134,2012-09-08,2559351,Adam,Molly and her family were excellent hosts.  They were very friendly and made me feel at home.  The unit has all the comforts of home and is close to several bus lines.  I stayed two weeks and am hoping to stay longer during my next visit.
180939,2310609,2012-09-17,693042,Adrienne,"We stayed for a short but sweet 2 nights in Seattle to visit friends. Molly's studio was perfect for the two of us. You could tell they remodeled the space with a great attention to detail. I love the bathroom! We were able to briefly meet Molly's husband and kids, however our visit was packed with activity and we missed meeting Molly. The house is a short cab ride or scenic walk from all the bars and restaurants in Capitol Hill. We would definitely stay here again."
180939,2314515,2012-09-17,2798388,Dan,"My girlfriend and I really enjoyed the space. It's so clean and new, bright and very welcoming - exactly like the photos! And Molly is a lovely and kind host - who gave us a bottle of wine and some plums from her garden. 

As far as the space is concerned, it's easy to spread out and find room for your stuff. The ceilings are a bit low for me in the laundry/bathroom area, as I'm 6'3, but I clocked my head only once! I learned quickly to duck! For most people though it'll be just fine. 

The bed is firm and futon like. The kitchen is well appointed and it's nice to cook in. You'll hear the pitter-patter of children's feet in the morning, but once they're off to school, it's quiet, quiet, quiet! The neighborhood itself is quiet and is at most a 7-minute drive to downtown or the I-5 freeway. You could easily walk to the Capitol Hill area of the city. There are nearby markets and cafe's as well. 

Next time I visit Seattle... I'm staying with Molly!"
180939,2358972,2012-09-21,2580674,Rob,"We loved staying at this studio in Seattle! Our 2 year old son had a great time - Molly and her family lent him some toys, which was really nice, and he got to spend some time with the kids in their beautiful garden. The location was great - it was close to everything by car. There was a great co-op supermarket nearby, which was awesome. They were really flexible about check-in and check-out time & communication was great.The whole family was super friendly. We wished we could've stayed there much longer! Thanks so much Molly & family!"
180939,2939687,2012-11-22,1445934,Katie,"Molly's beautiful studio apartment is so cosy with every amenity you could need, and possibly the world's best shower! It is in a really nice neighbourhood as well. Buses run into the city from right around the corner every 15 minutes, so the location is quite convenient for getting around as well. 
Molly herself is kind, attentive and very generous. We had a really lovely stay in Seattle thanks to her.

We would very happily recommend this apartment for the perfect time away in Seattle."
180939,4429660,2013-05-05,1845911,Shannon,"Molly and family are excellent hosts. My partner and I just finished a month-long stay with them and could not be happier with our choice of apartments. We absolutely agree with all of the other reviews: super clean, great shower, well-equipped, fantastic location (walking distance to cafes, restaurants, bars, grocery stores as well as several bus lines) and above all great hosts. You might even get some fresh baked goods if you are lucky! :) We definitely recommend Molly's studio for your time in Seattle whether on business or holiday."
180939,4482609,2013-05-07,3380745,Alexis,Beautiful family & beautiful home!  Very convenient to bus system.  Molly was very accommodating with our difficult schedule.  She & her family made us feel right at home.
180939,4552334,2013-05-12,5985779,Sara,"I had a great time in Seattle and this was the perfect place to stay!  I stayed here with my boyfriend after four days of driving around Olympic National Park.  We got our bearings quickly.  The studio is located near the Capitol Hill neighborhood and the buses provide for easy access to downtown and other neighborhoods. This is probably a neighborhood we wouldn't have explored if we hadn't stayed here because it doesn't seem to be a super popular neighborhood like Ballard or Fremont, but I enjoyed that experience of staying somewhere that I might not otherwise have gone.  I loved being near the food coop.  The studio itself is bright and clean and feels private even though it's below the owners' home and looks into their garden.  Molly is really friendly and helpful.  Parking on the street is easy.  I would stay here again and recommend this place to any friends.  "
180939,4652753,2013-05-18,1745230,Leila,"From the umbrella hung thoughtfully by the door to the cozy kitchen, Molly's apartment has everything you need and nothing you don't.  I worked during the day, and enjoyed the sunlight and the back garden.  Molly was open to me checking in a bit early so I could take a conference call, and was a helpful and gracious hostess.  Many thanks, I'll look forward to my next trip!"
180939,4831645,2013-05-28,1670127,Jessica,"Molly and her family were kind and gracious hosts. The apartment was clean and well-stocked, including all sorts of amenities from a washer/dryer to a compost bin. The shower was especially nice! We would highly recommend staying here if you're visiting Seattle."
180939,5903273,2013-07-22,5230451,Chris,"This was the perfect place to stay.  Molly and Stacy were great hosts - they even gave me fresh strawberries from their extensive garden.  It's really convenient to take bus #2 downtown, which is frequent and fast.  Everything was in great condition, from the full kitchen to the washer and dryer and the bathroom.  And it was great being down the street from Madrona and Mollie Moon's.

Highly recommended!"
180939,6006257,2013-07-26,446009,Caitlin,"Molly and her family were the most wonderful hosts we could have asked for during our days in Seattle.  The studio doesn't feel like it's a basement: it's clean, spacious, and full of natural light.  Our every need was met, from vegan soaps in the bathroom to refreshments in the fridge, and she and her husband were easy to talk to when we ran into them while leaving or returning.  One mile from Lake Washington, two miles from the Sound, one mile from Capitol Hill, it's not too far from any one thing, but quiet at night.  By the end of our stay, we were ready to move in!  Thanks, Molly, we'll be sure to look you up the next time we're in town!"
180939,6072368,2013-07-29,2744367,Kyle,"Molly's place is a great nook away from the action of Cap Hill yet only a quick bus ride/walk to get yourself in the thick of things.
Molly was really solid at communicating with us and we found our stay to be enjoyable and relaxing.
This place has a great kitchen setup, a darkened bedroom and a wondrous shower!
As you will be staying in their family's home, do expect the pitter-patter of lil feet early in the morning, but it's nothing we weren't able to sleep through.
If you're missing/needing anything you just need to ask. Molly was greatly accommodating
Thanks for the stay"
180939,6154343,2013-08-01,7071059,Megan,"Our stay in Molly's studio was nothing short of fantastic.  Molly and her family are so friendly (her children had even picked out toys to leave in the studio for our baby!), and she was accommodating of our arrival time.  The studio itself is thoughtfully equipped and so tastefully decorated.  There are children in the upstairs living space, and you definitely hear all the morning footsteps, but Molly told us this would be the case, and it wasn't bothersome in the least.  Given the opportunity, we would definitely stay here again.  Just lovely! "
180939,6393455,2013-08-11,6242018,Emma,Lovely apartment! Would love to live there forever. Was sad to not meet Chelley ourselves but we had a lovely time.
180939,6472333,2013-08-13,7800942,Kris,Great studio!  Excellent kitchen set up and great shower. Close to all of the cool stuff in Seattle and quiet neighborhood. 
180939,6533897,2013-08-16,6357391,Elizabeth,Molly is wonderful and the  place is adorable! My friend and I had a great stay. The location is perfect and the apartment was very clean. Highly recommend staying here. 
180939,6779910,2013-08-25,6741944,Penny,Staying here was a wise choice.  My husband and I were pleased in every way.  The space was so well-designed and considered; we had everything we needed and more.  It was quiet; it was clean; it was bright and it was comfortable/well-located.  Molly and her family were great hosts and the fresh tomatoes from the garden were a thoughtful treat.  We'd rent again from them.
180939,6959528,2013-09-01,7149008,Alexandra&Colin,"We had a great stay here and it was an awesome first Airbnb experience.  The apartment was beautiful, and Molly was friendly and generous.  It was just a 5-10 minute bus ride to downtown which was great.  We would definitely stay there again and would recommend it to others."
180939,7201473,2013-09-10,1588278,Kristi,I loved staying in this super clean and conscious basement apartment. Molly was a wonderful host and her family was delightful. The pitter patter of active little feet above created a natural alarm clock. I'd for sure stay here again when I visit Seattle. 
180939,8609135,2013-11-08,8155373,Joseph,"Gayle and I had a nice stay in Molly's little basement studio flat. Molly has a great eye for design and has made the most of a smaller space with many stylish features. A generous host, we left with jars of jam and chutney. The flat is well located for walking or bus to dining and entertainment districts.

A great experience for our first airbnb."
180939,8837650,2013-11-20,9604617,Amy,"I had a great stay at Molly's studio apt; it was the perfect first Airbnb experience! The apt is in a great location out of the hustle and bustle but close enough that you an get most places in a few minutes. The apt has everything you'll need and a well equipped kitchen if you like to cook. Molly also makes delicious baked goods, the cherry on top of a fantastic stay! "
180939,13469705,2014-05-28,3422369,Jakob,"It was just great to stay at Mollys apartment. We were there for more than a week and enjoyed living there a lot. We got everything we need, it is only a 10 minutes bus ride to the city center and the neighbourhood is quiet and safe. 
Mollys was such a friendly host, even welcoming us with a beer in her lovely garden after we arrived at a very long flight. She gave us good information how to get around in the area and town and answered all of our question. We had a perfect time, thanks a lot!"
180939,13658317,2014-06-02,4090548,Frederic,"My stay at Green Garden Studio was great.  It was super convenient to be so close to all of the Capital Hill events I attended to over the weekend.  Molly lent me a cast iron skillet and casserole dish to cook with.  Her husband also let me pick some herbs from their garden.  The place was clean and as advertised.  Check in and check out was super easy and she responded quickly to my questions during my visit.  All in all, my vacation in Seattle was a success and I'm appreciative of having a place to stay that met all my specific needs."
180939,13829573,2014-06-05,259915,Jess,"Great place. Nice family, very welcoming. 
Clean little studio, cute, and private. They had everything we needed and we were in a fantastic location for beer travel and great dinning. Beware, the hills walking either direction to beer and or food down Union are killer :)

Saved this place to our favs list for our next visit. 

"
180939,15035285,2014-07-01,13792965,Jay,"Molly and her family were very accommodating and welcoming to myself, my father, and then my wife and daughter.  We stayed in their home for just under one month and enjoyed the time.  I would stay again and enjoyed my stay."
180939,15755169,2014-07-15,14938591,Marian,"Outstanding stay at Central District Green Garden Studio!  The studio was very clean, welcoming, well stocked and super comfy in a great location with easy on street parking.  We visited Seattle during a warm week and the apartment stayed cool without air conditioning.  Highly recommend!
"
180939,16249132,2014-07-24,15488480,Sylvia,"Our experience staying at Molly's studio was excellent!! My boyfriend and I stayed in Molly's place for our 5 days visit in Seattle. We love the place! 

The check-in and check-out processes were both very convenient. The studio is neat, clean, well maintained and beautifully designed! It is close enough to the bus stops to get us to Pike Place Market and Space Needle -- do get some quarters ready if you are going to take bus. It is also a quiet community that we got nice sleep after a long day. We were greeted with a card, a beer and some snacks on the table when we got into the studio after a long flight. It feels very warm and welcomed:) What was even better was the communication with Molly. She was very responsive and helpful even tho she wasn't in town during our visit. 

Great experience! I will stay there again if I revisit Seattle and I definitely recommend Molly's studio to other people!"
180939,16546760,2014-07-29,14794872,Alyssa,Molly's place is so great!! It was my first time visiting Seattle; I was there for 4 nights and the studio apartment was perfect for my needs. It was extremely neat and clean when I arrived and I was welcomed with a beer and some treats on the table! This location is just a block away from the bus to get downtown in about 10 minutes! The garden in the back was a beautiful thing to wake up to. Not having A/C was never an issue because all of the windows open. Plenty of natural light and very cozy. Highly recommended and I would stay here again as it helped make my trip very memorable!
180939,16838304,2014-08-03,12510550,Margaret,"My boyfriend and I loved our stay at Molly's studio. It was clean, charming, and comfortable. Checking in was very smooth. Molly was very flexible with our check in time. The studio was right on the bus line to downtown which was essential for us, as we didn't rent a car. There was also a grocery store right down the alley that we walked to, so we could save some money on our vacation by not eating out so much. Overall, we would both highly recommend Molly's studio to other air BNBers!"
180939,17439155,2014-08-12,6979834,Danielle,"Molly's Studio was everything we needed it to be for our 9 days in Seattle.  It was clean, comfortable and conveniently located.  All of our needs we're met in this space and we would stay again! Thanks Molly for your warm welcome and kindness!!"
180939,17624600,2014-08-15,17370236,Leah,"Our stay at Molly's basement apartment was very cozy and welcoming. The studio apartment was very clean and neat. It was great to meet Molly and her husband, they are very kind people. The bus stops are right around the corner that take you into downtown or towards the airport. "
180939,18058664,2014-08-21,16818826,Juliet,"My wife and I enjoyed a week long stay while we were in town for a wedding and vacation. The room worked very well for us and was in the perfect location for everything we wanted to accomplish in town. The room was clean and ready for us upon arrival. Our hosts were easy to communicate with and even left us some local beer in the fridge to welcome us to town! We especially enjoyed the washer and dryer (laundry detergent was included) so we could keep our clothes fresh for the whole stay. We were happy with our stay overall, but it should be mentioned that the young children upstairs start to run around quite early, so sleeping in is not an option. Other than that, we loved this room and would gladly stay there again.  "
180939,18476150,2014-08-27,12397798,John,"Molly's Central District Green Studio was a delight to stay at.  The place was clean and interesting to stay at.  Molly was an excellent host, she even provided some refreshments in the Fridge!  The surrounding neighborhood was awesome, a little coffee shop is just a block away as well as a bar.  Need some supplies, there is a grocery outlet right up the alley.  If you need to go further just hope on a bus and you will be there in no time.  There is a little noise that goes though the floor from upstairs in the morning time, but it isn't excessive.  Overall, I would recommend Molly place to anyone visiting Seattle."
180939,18667092,2014-08-30,4080295,Maura,"We were warmly greeted by Molly and her daughter.  Fresh vegies from the garden were a delicious perk.

The apartment was clean, comfortable, and conveniently located for our stay."
180939,20234080,2014-09-26,12476176,Arran,"A really convenient location, simple yet practical space.  Attentive and helpful hosts.  A great base for our few days in Seattle."
180939,20342424,2014-09-28,7400339,Benji,"The studio apartment was great. Modern and classic styles, and nice hosts.
Molly and her husband gave us a bottle of wine upon arrival and welcomed us. 
The only thing I would like to mention is that you can hear the children running around in the mornings around 7 am which woke us up,  but we just got an early start on those days. Thanks again Molly, we had fun!"
180939,20501031,2014-09-30,7196137,Jon,"I recently stayed at Molly's apartment for two nights during a trip to Seattle with my girlfriend. This place was exactly what we needed!

The room is very spacious, bed is quite comfortable and shower has awesome pressure. It was very easy to find free street parking for our rental car as well.

On top of the great accommodations and tremendous value we got staying here, Molly and her family are simply wonderful people. I'm very glad I went upstairs to say 'hello' and ended up chatting with them for a good 20-30 minutes about our trip.

10/10 would absolutely stay again and recommend friends & family to do the same!"
180939,21285989,2014-10-14,16757090,Katy,"Molly's studio was perfect! It was right nextdoor to a Grocery Outlet and within walking distance to a fabulous co-op market. Just outside the front door is Molly's adorable garden, which we picked herbs from."
180939,21628943,2014-10-20,22261890,Bill,"Molly greeted us at the door when we arrived. Her husband showed us the apartment and brought us a bottle of wine. Molly and her husband offered several suggestions, at our request, for local restaurants we might enjoy. 

The room was bright and comfortable. The bed was comfortable and we slept well. It is in a quiet neighborhood that was fun to walk around. "
180939,22358827,2014-11-04,13937628,Kimberley,Molly and her husband were both incredibly helpful. The apartment was neat and tidy with a separate and secure entrance. The location was perfect for us as we only had a short walk to and from the bus stop. The bus was also a direct line to almost all the tourist sights that one might like to see in the Emerald City. There are also 2 grocery stores close by for anything that you might need. 
180939,22546967,2014-11-09,13654418,Juan,Staying in Molly's studio was great the place was big enough for my girlfriend and I what we saw in the pics is what we got the studio is located in a beautiful neighborhood with plenty of parking
180939,25099626,2015-01-06,8728659,A.L.,"I had a very pleasant stay at Molly's studio! The layout of the space is thoughtfully designed. My boyfriend and I started our days at one of the nearby bus stops, and ended our days in the peaceful and relaxing space of the studio. I was impressed by Molly's warm welcome on the day we arrived. Staying at Molly's studio was a treat in itself! "
180939,29937563,2015-04-14,4723462,Aaron,"We had a blast at Molly's place. It is very conveniently located near downtown Seattle and it had everything we needed for our long weekend getaway. Molly met us when we arrived and was very kind and helpful. We didn't have an issue finding parking near the house, which was great since finding parking anywhere else in the city can be tricky (and expensive). We will definitely be back to Seattle in the future, and hopefully Molly's place will be available when we do return. Do yourself a favor if you stay here. Eat at the local spots nearby and not chains. You won't regret it."
180939,31355808,2015-05-04,69452,Paula,Everything was great.  All was as stated and the place was great.
180939,33215451,2015-05-25,206203,Amanda,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
180939,33253273,2015-05-26,30499989,Olivia,"Molly's place was great and even more charming than what the pictures suggest.  I am just echoing the positive sentiments expressed in prior reviews, but I have to reiterate that the location was truly fantastic for the price (i.e., close to downtown, even closer to several grocery stores for last-minute provisions, great local venues, ample parking, quiet and beautiful neighborhood).  I would definitely recommend staying at this studio."
180939,33814085,2015-06-01,9283164,Angela,"Staying here was one of my best decisions for my weekend trip to Seattle! I loved the contemporary yet cozy feel of the studio. The kitchen was stocked with the necessities and she even left us fresh coffee grinds and milk + musely to eat. The location was ideal, being just around the corner from the bus stop and the neighborhood was fun to explore! 

Molly was a very sweet host and responsive to any questions/concerns we had. She recommended great local spots and even helped us store our luggage until our flight! We will definitely be back :) "
180939,34547679,2015-06-09,32366466,Jasmine,Such a lovely and tastefully designed studio! Molly and her husband were hospitable and helpful! I had a wonderful experience at Molly's place during my stay in Seattle! It was conveniently located near the 2 bus line that took us straight to downtown and every other site we wanted to visit. I would definitely recommend staying at this beautiful studio!
180939,34785544,2015-06-12,16977278,Monette,"The studio was just as pictured- clean, neat, and with everything you need for a comfortable stay.  Molly was a great host! She welcomed us to her home with a sweet hand written note and bottle of wine. Communication with her was easy and she even recommended a breakfast place near by we can check out. The neighboorhood was clean and quiet, reminding my boyfriend and I of the little neighborhoods in Berkeley, CA.  The studio also had easy access for Lyft/Uber pick-up and drop-off.  Coming home to Molly's studio after a long day of exploring was perfect for our quick trip to Seattle.  Hope Molly will have us again in the future for a longer visit."
180939,35658274,2015-06-21,31688792,Lauren,"We had a wonderful stay at Molly's studio. The location was was central to everything. We rented a car and had no trouble parking, but also made use of the bus that picked up right around the corner - so convenient! The studio met all our needs, and we had a great time. Thank you!"
180939,35936812,2015-06-23,33329229,Scott,"Great location for our Capital Hill visit. Excellent restaurants within walking distance. Great theater close by. We made it to Lake WA, the arboretum and Elliott Bay on foot. 
Quiet neighborhood. Wonderful hosts. "
180939,36775537,2015-07-01,3751406,Ashley,"Great location! Really cute neighborhood close to a lot of main routes around town. Cute coffee shop is just a block away, with breakfast joints, restaurants and bars about 8 blocks. 

Reviews don't lie about the sound from the main house above, but luckily for us the family (very nice and friendly) left for a trip the next day, so it was super quiet after that. The shower was amazing! 

Overall a clean spot to rest your head at night in a nice neighborhood, but not a place I'd want to spend a whole lot of day time down time. We didn't cook at all, but the kitchen was really clean and nice, too. "
180939,37857574,2015-07-11,33536387,Samantha,Our hosts were very welcoming and friendly. We were greeted with a bottle of wine and a comfortable suite. The suite provided all the necessities for an economical stay.  The hosts provided tips on transportation and grocery stores as we needed it.  They responded to all communication (before and during the stay) in a timely manner.  It appeared to be a bit of a rougher neighbourhood but the unit was well-secured and we never encountered any trouble.  Parking was easy to find in front of the unit.  Short car ride (approx 10 mins by direct bus route) to downtown.
180939,39267003,2015-07-22,26997730,Patty,Molly was waiting for us when we arrived late and graciously shared with us everything we needed to know.  She even left us a welcoming bottle of wine.  Her studio met our needs and was close to our daughter's apartment.  Perfect!
180939,39613939,2015-07-25,30071677,Lynne,"Molly is a great host with excellent communication.  She is helpful and quick to answer questions. The
studio apartment has everything you need. Great shower and comfortable bed. The concrete floor in the bathroom was reminiscent of dorm style living and not my favorite , but certainly functional. We just stayed a few days to explore Seattle before leaving for our next destination.  It is located conveniently to public transportation. The neighborhood was a little rough in appearance. It seems that it is being revitalized. Some homes are vacant and others are beautifully remodeled. It is a very quiet neighborhood, though. We enjoyed our stay and only wished there was a more comfortable patio area for enjoying a glass of wine in the evening. "
180939,40723484,2015-08-02,19383815,Nicole,"Had a lovely stay in the cosy space. It was very conveniently located very close to the bus stop and a supermarket. 

The space was clean, well equipped and had everything I needed during my stay. 

Molly was quick to respond and very accommodating. Although she was away on holiday, she made sure everything was in order. "
180939,41078692,2015-08-04,876260,Dane,"Loved staying at the Garden Studio. Very clean, comfortable, and a lovely well-cared for space. The hosts are organized, attentive, and thoughtful to making your stay nice. "
180939,41929032,2015-08-10,30114471,Colin,"I never saw Molly because she was away on vacation, but everywhere ng was there for us when we arrived.  Had a good time there, I would stay there again in the future."
180939,42556178,2015-08-14,32755440,Wayne,Lovely clean studio apartment within 30 minutes walking distance of downtown Seattle.   Cafes and grocery store nearby.   Neighborhood recently gentrified. Host was out of town but reachable.   Very helpful and all went smoothly.
180939,43358117,2015-08-19,9430080,Mike,"Though Molly wasn't in town when we stayed, she was incredibly accommodating and made things work perfectly for us!  The studio was clean, roomy, and a nice place to stay for our trip to Seattle.  The location is awesome, and removed enough from the city but still close enough to be easily accessible by foot, bike, or car.  There was plenty of room for me, my wife, and my daughter in the studio, and the amenities/appliances were new and worked very well! "
180939,45775049,2015-09-06,2559351,Adam,"The space is just as advertised.  It is in an attractive, quiet neighborhood, but close to everything. There are nearby bus stops that can easily get you all over town, including Downtown, Capitol Hill, and the University District. The apartment has everything you need and is very comfortable.  I would probably move in permanently if they would let me."
180939,47044345,2015-09-15,15935035,Walter,"Friendly, helpfull, thoughtfull. Molly, Stacy and their kids make you feel at home in Seattle. It was absolutely great staying with them. Busses are close to bring you downtown or anywhere else. Or you can walk of course through the neighbourhoods. I highly recommend the place. It's a part of their home with separate entry and has everything you need."
180939,47485718,2015-09-19,26011984,Rashree,"Molly and her hubby made sure I was right at home from the very beginning!  After getting clear instructions for check-in/keys, I was welcomed with a nice bottle of wine, a clean and spacious studio, and basic amenities (towels, soap, shampoo, etc).  This studio is the best deal if you are looking to stay in a safe and cozy place close to Seattle (downtown), want parking, wifi, and welcoming hosts that are available if/when you have questions.  I really liked that the studio provided me with many different options:  I could cook my own meals or go to a trendy eatery 2-3 blocks away, I could work  there or go to a coffee shop or library close by, and if I wanted to be entertained there was so many places to go with or without a car.  I highly recommend this place!!"
180939,48873832,2015-09-29,35341713,Crystal,"My boyfriend and I have never been to Seattle  and wanted to stay someplace central to the city. Molly's place was exactly what we were looking for! The neighborhood was a short drive or Lyft ride away from everywhere we wanted to go. It was close to the local grocery store so we could stalk up on snacks and food throughout the trip.

Molly was wonderful and welcomed us with a bottle of wine. The space was perfect for what we needed and was very clean. She was also very accommodating and was reachable via text. I would highly recommend staying there when visiting Seattle."
180939,49473619,2015-10-04,11316273,Benjamin,"I didn't spend much time in the studio as I was visiting Seattle for vacation, but the studio served its purpose of providing a nice bed and a place to shower. Molly was very helpful and welcoming to her studio and Seattle. She gave some nice tips for the area and Seattle in general. Wouldn't mind coming back here!"
180939,49913455,2015-10-07,35919582,Susan,"We had a great stay at Molly's apartment. We were visiting Seattle to check out the city for few days before heading out to Vancouver. The apartment is a good amount of walking distance to the city or less than $10 uber ride away. You could take the bus but we liked walking. The apartment has everything you need - clean bathroom, kitchen, and ample space to spread your things out. We would love to stay here again when we visit Seattle again."

As a professional in hospitality he has everything I needed for my trip from ironing board to toiletries and a comfy bed. I definitely recommend John's place for your visit to Seattle and look forward to my next trip there."""
1328159,6137087,2013-07-31,7472647,Claudia,"Lovely home, great host."
1328159,6287831,2013-08-06,7651160,Drew,"John is a very easy going guy with an immaculately kept duplex. He's nestled into a nice neighborhood in West Seattle, within walking distance of good food and adjoining neighborhoods (if you're say, there to visit family in the area) making his locale perfect considering there's really only one hotel on that side of town. 

The room is clean, roomy, has a TV, is right next to your own bathroom, and has Wi-Fi. John supplied coffee (and accoutrements), offered-up a very clean kitchen, and invited me to be very much at home during my visit. 

I would definitely stay there again and highly recommend John's accommodations.  "
1328159,6472319,2013-08-13,7151481,烁,"Really quiet tidy and beautiful house, full of art article. I enjoyed the stay there. Thank you."

Highly recommend John's accommodations!
"
1328159,6883230,2013-08-28,2159476,David,"I spent 3 nights here in August. John has a lovely home, the bedroom I stayed in was very comfortable, spotlessly clean and with plenty of hanging space, a tv and dvd player. Next door was my own bathroom with tub and shower, again spotlessly clean with toiletries provided. Tea, coffee and soft drinks were also provided,. John is very hospitable but respectful of your privacy, he kindly drove me round the area on my arrival to help me get my bearings and give me a feel for the place, and he made some very good recommendations of places to see and things to do. My only complaint is that I only got to stay at his place for 3 days before I had to move on somewhere else.  I relied on buses to get me around, the 120 and 125 go downtown from a stop that's just a 5 minute walk to John's. Alaska Junction is about a mile away, that has a nice pub, nice diner, a shop that sells great ice cream  and a very interesting antiques shop. I highly recommend John as a host and his home as a place to stay when visiting Seattle.  "
1328159,7377366,2013-09-17,8557079,David,This was my first AirB&B experience and it went perfect! John has a very well kept home and his hospitality was exceptional. Great neighborhood and close to all my destinations. The rate for the room was very reasonable and I will definitely rent from John when I am back in the area.  
1328159,7944977,2013-10-09,932772,Tom,"John's place is top notch, highest quality in every respect! John was a super host - thought of everything, was helpful with answers, and left plenty of space when desired. I hope to have the occasion to return."
1328159,8056920,2013-10-14,9020681,Kaitlyn,"The comforts of a home away from home, great location (especially for a trip to west Seattle) and easy parking.  I would definitely stay with John again! "
1328159,8234787,2013-10-21,3443150,Nathan,"I was in Seattle for a conference and needed an inexpensive place to stay since I'm a student. John's place was nearby and reasonably priced, but far better than I expected. Not only was he accomodating of my busy schedule, but his home is fabulously decorated with all the comforts and amenities you could desire.
I'm glad I didn't settle for the hostel!"
1328159,9110503,2013-12-07,1154803,Kelly,"John was very delightful.  His house is super nice and very clean.  The bedroom and bathroom were spacious and he had everything very well prepared for AirBnB guests. The wifi was very fast too. Great host, absolutely great place.  Thank you!"
1328159,9175537,2013-12-10,2409849,Mike,"5 star listing across the board.  John was a great host.  The room is clean and comfortable with a full bathroom right next to it.  I thought it was a great deal for the price.  The location is ideal as well - 15 minutes from SeaTac, close to the West Seattle bridge, and just a few minute drive from Alaska junction."

Quiet location, close to the freeway to access Seattle.
John was an excellent host and very generous with sharing his space in a respectful way.
The house was well equipped, clean,beautiful interior and always great music.. John has wonderful musical ken.
Would love to come back.
"
1328159,12314210,2014-04-28,14501652,Elizabeth,"A very pleasant stay in a lovely home. John understands hospitality. Although our paths did not cross except at my arrival due to his work schedule and my work schedule, I felt John's welcome to make myself at home. Very convenient location to all of West Seattle and easy access to downtown; near public transit. Wish I had had my bike; West Seattle has great bike lanes and it would've been a nice way to explore the beach areas. I will definitely stay here again if my travels bring me back to West Seattle. Thanks, John!"
1328159,13379011,2014-05-26,15442131,Julia,"Well-prepared and organized house, even Cable TV in the guest room. I felt like a hotel. You probably don’t need to bring anything. It seems to me that John likes reading his book in the living room while I am eating, which this situation was a little bit uncomfortable to me to swallow food in a very quiet situation. He is a nice host. The house is clean.    "
1328159,13487361,2014-05-28,3516543,Matthew,"A+. John is very gracious.  Clean & neat bedroom and bathroom. Comfortable bed, Cable TV, WiFi, quiet, easy street parking, & great location. John's place is always my first choice when I'm in Seattle."

1328159,14005635,2014-06-09,16464808,Erin,What a way to see Seattle! This well decorated home sits right in the heart of all Alki has to offer. I recommend airbnb over any hotel now. Nothing like the experience of home in a different city. John was well prepared and a gracious host. Like ships passing in the night I mostly saw him if he was reading. I felt compelled to speak whenever I saw him but he was very good at making it known to treat the house as my own. Would visit this place again! 
1328159,14748374,2014-06-25,15181648,Adeline,"Great place to stay in Seattle. The house is great, the room has everything you need and a private bathroom next to it, and John is a great host. It is also easily communicated with downtown Seattle since there is a bus stop nearby. I would definitively recommend John's house to spend a few days in Seattle! "
1328159,15111773,2014-07-02,945982,Giselle,"My first airbnb experience, can't be better! The house is well located, convenient to airport and downtown. The room is very clean and tidy, with everything in need. And John was a gracious and generous host, though we didn't have time to talk much, because of different daily schedule, you can tell from the books, collections, decorations that he is a man of many interests and artistic tastes. Given a second chance to visit Seattle, I would choose to stay here again."
1328159,15326467,2014-07-07,857000,Michael,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay with John, he really goes out of his way to make it feel like you never left HOME! John has supplied absolutely EVERYTHING,  no need to unpack you toiletry bag, from shampoos to lotions, nail clippers to beard trimmers, floss and bandaids,   obviously from his profession as a hotel manager he is used to providing FIRST CLASS service. John was also a very generous host offering anything in his well stocked fridge and his home was charming and comfortable. A most amiable man it was a pleasure to talk with John, just wish I had more time there and I cannot speak highly enough of my experience. THANK YOU John.
"
1328159,15697755,2014-07-14,16747188,Norma,I enjoyed my stay immensely.  John is a gracious host and most helpful.  I would definitely want to stay at John's on my next trip to Seattle.  
1328159,16156997,2014-07-22,3324166,Patrick,"John's house is really lovely. You feel like home as soon as you enter it. I had my own bathroom and I could use the complete kitchen which was nice. John himself is also very hospitable. 

The house is located in a quiet neighborhood. Not much going on there but there are several busses taking you to downtown in just 15 minutes. That's very convenient."

His location was perfect for my stay since I was attending an event in West Seattle. And the 120 bus was a great way to get from John's to the downtown area quickly."

I didn't see much of John due to being out on the town when I was in Seattle but he made me feel extremely welcome. His house is impeccably clean, full use of the kitchen and my own bathroom was lovely.  If you're planning on visiting Seattle stay with John. "

1328159,22607692,2014-11-10,21534602,Kristopher,"John is a true pro. This was the 3rd airbnb I stayed at when I relocated to Seattle. It was like the 4 seasons. The place is clean and in a quiet neighborhood. The private bath is right next to the room, and John makes you feel at home with snacks and beverages. I will recommend to anyone coming to Seattle. "

1328159,34955979,2015-06-14,31104093,Laine,John was a wonderful host and I felt very welcome in his home.  I was on a day schedule and John  was on nights so we didn't run into each other much.  The house was neat and clean and I always had fresh flowers in my bedroom.  The neighborhood is peaceful with a park in walking distance and lots of coffee shops and delicious places to eat nearby.   The bed in the room is so darn comfortable you'll never want to get out!!

The room has a lot of space, the closet is big and the bed is so comfortable.

He has complementary beverage and food for you....you will need it when you came back from a long day out, this is a great idea from John.

You are just 10 min driving from John´s house to downtown, so it makes the best location in town."

Their modern apartment on 8th Ave was in walking distance of many great restaurants and all of Seattle's top tourist attractions. The apartment was clean and beautifully furnished and had everything we could possibly need. It was great chatting with Miranda and Mike while they rebooted the wifi the afternoon we checked in. They were easy going and friendly, and gave us great hiking (Poo Poo Point) and food tips (Zig Zag). All in all, it was a great experience and we would stay there again in a heartbeat! Thanks so much, guys! "

When we first arrived we were welcomed by Mike who was on time and very helpful in helping us find restaurants close by. Miranda and Mike both  messaged us throughout the  weekend to ensure we had everything we needed!  
There was a box of chocolates and champagne also waiting for us when we arrived.  This place had everything we needed! Perfect 5 star.  Mike and Miranda thank you for being such amazing hosts :)"

3803947,25183797,2015-01-08,17760346,Nanci,"The preparation of the whole stay went smoothly and Miranda was quick to answer and very welcoming. I spent 4 excellent nights in Seattle. The flat was very clean, well equipped and at walking distance from the convention center (5min) and from the Pike's district (10min). Convenience stores are just around the corner and the Japanese restaurant just across the street is a good place to eat or take-out. There is also a nice coffee shop at street level of the building. I highly recommend! 
"
3803947,25453721,2015-01-16,24036889,Helmut,"Great experience! Miranda was a great host, made it super easy to check-in and even had a bottle of wine waiting for us to enjoy. The location was perfect too, with only a 15 minute walk to Pike Place Market and a $5-10 Uber gets you pretty much anywhere else you would want to be. Everything we needed was inside the apartment, nice appliances and included enough pots, pans and utensils for us to cook an awesome dinner (all that was required was fresh ingredients from the market). There's a cool rooftop area with a grill, some lounge chairs, and a great view. Nice coffee shop on the ground level and some great sushi across the street. We will certainly be back to Seattle and when we do, we know where we'll be staying!"

This was located in a great area, we were only like 15mins from Pike's place and downtown. Everything was clean and they had things for us to use (pots, pans, cups, towels, etc). There is a little terrace on the top floor with spectacular views of Seattle. Definitely worth it! I HIGHLY recommend this place as well as anyother of theirs!"

They were completely responsive to questions about booking and very detailed with check-in, check-out and unit information once we were booked. I never had to contact them with any questions as everything was already provided to us.

When we arrived they had a bottle of Prosecco waiting for us, great start to our trip. The transfer of keys was quick and fluid, better than having to check into any hotel. Apartment was perfect for my wife and I and we love the Vizio smart TV. We were bummed that we forgot our Chromecast, but found out that the TV was Netflix ready along with tons of other programs like Hulu and Pandora. Just don't forget to log off when you check out!

We will definitely be booking with them the next time we visit Seattle and will recommend them to friends and family."

3803947,34167927,2015-06-05,34442489,Julie,"•Convenient location – walking distance from downtown, but it is east of 5 highway, so feels more like you are in a neighborhood, rather than a touristy area. It is also walking distance from Capital Hill.
•Everything is very new and feels like it is your space while you are there, not like you are invading someone’s personal space
•Very private
•Apartment itself is very quiet, and you don’t hear much from neighboring apartments
•Space is much larger than a normal hotel room – it is basically like having a large suite at a hotel without the price of staying in a hotel suite
•I really liked having the washer / dryer and dishwasher
"
3803947,34423379,2015-06-08,30914248,Vish,Had such a great time at this wonderful place. Location was great and the place had everything we needed. Very clean and cozy. Would 100% come back!

Walking distance to Convention Center, Pike Place Market and Macy's. The place was spacious for two people, as the picture shows. The room was clean and fully-equipmented. Eve was kind to us, providing extra fans, answering questions, etc. "
3803947,35549574,2015-06-20,5007687,Bradley,"Eve was very pleasant and was on time for a requested early check-in.   The Condo was clean, comfortable and furnished just as in the pictures.  I really liked the experience of living in a smaller home for a few days and might consider something like this for a retirement home.   

Eve was very attentive to my requests and was always quick to respond

Very close to the downtown area and found a great deli 3 blocks up Madison.  Great sandwiches!  Most everything is within walking distance or use Uber to get take you where you need to go.  "
3803947,36006651,2015-06-24,28504735,Becca,"Eve was a wonderful host, and the apartment was exactly what we needed.

The apartment is exactly as it looks in the listing and is located within walking distance of the convention center (which we were there for).  Eve was really responsive in her replies back to us and gave us lots of advice on what to eat and what to do.  If we ever need accommodation again in Seattle, we will be back!"
3803947,37199465,2015-07-05,35099840,Sri,"Excellent service. For instance, it was relatively hot during our stay. Upon request, Eve was prompt and kind to get us an extra fan. Prompt and friendly support. Great hospitality. I would definitely stay in one of Eve's apartments next time around! Minor one: The bed and the pillows were too soft for our liking. And again, it is only a personal preference. All in all, a wonderful experience and a very convenient location!"
3803947,38007798,2015-07-12,35794594,David,"Recently returned from visiting Seattle for the 1st time. We had a wonderful adventure that all started with the professionalism and ease of booking our accommodation with Eve and Michael. 

Eve was in constant contact with me throughout the trip and even offered us a list of the best neighborhoods and dining establishments to visit. She met us at the apartment and oriented us to the unit and building which really set the tone for our visit.

The apartment is perfectly located in First Hill and made walking to downtown and Capitol Hill easy and fast. The apartment is modern and stylish with all the amenities. The building has a rooftop deck which was perfect for seeing the Seattle skyline at night.

As an added bonus, the coffee shop at the entrance to the building makes the best coffee I've had (maybe since I'm not a Seattle native, I wouldn't know any better). This was my first stop each morning.

I would highly recommend this apartment or any other property that Eve and Michael manage."
3803947,39524150,2015-07-24,14515922,Kelly,Eve was very accommodating and checked with us several times before our arrival.  
3803947,40099580,2015-07-28,20645114,Danny,"We have 2 hours before we are leaving this beautiful little apartment in what turned out to be a great location in Seattle. Eve and Morgan made it easy to check in and have been incredibly professional, helpful and accessible. I loved how we were in the middle between Capitol Hill (which I loved) and the waterfront (which I loved). The apartment was great. Coffee shop downstairs! The roof top deck fun, especially beautiful at night! 
I'll be back.   "
3803947,41207622,2015-08-05,27484219,John,"We had a really great time in Seattle, despite the unexpected hot weather, which made this room a bit uncomfortable in the afternoon and evenings. The owners tried to supply fans for the room, but without full-fledged air-conditioning this space is muggy during hot weather. We didn't think to check if the room had A/C, as we're from Florida and didn't think of such things visiting Seattle, but they did provide everything they could to help."
3803947,42926880,2015-08-16,18115828,Jason,The unit was just as described and was a great place to spend a long weekend in Seattle. The location was very convenient with all of the main areas in walking distance. Morgan was great to deal with and made getting checked in a breeze.
3803947,43496570,2015-08-20,35497962,Nathan,Great! Very nice apartment and easy experience! Very happy :)
3803947,43963726,2015-08-23,38396032,Kelsey,"This place was great for our first trip to Seattle. Check in was easy, even when we arrived before the check in time. The location is convenient and walking distance to all the main attractions. Also, the coffee shop downstairs was awesome! "
3803947,46414984,2015-09-10,22458501,Adrian,"The apartment was super clean and the attention from the hosts was marvelous! I did the self check in, given that I didn't know at what was I going to get to the apartment. Everything was great and I really enjoy my stay there! I even booked again the apartment! Thank you!"
3803947,46804326,2015-09-13,39141875,Nancy,"Clean, comfortable, spacious, private, modern, uncluttered. Perfect walking location. All you need in a kitchen and bath. Comfy bed. Nice rooftop deck. Parking in lot a block away, pricey but cheaper than what local hotels charge to park. No AC, so a bit hot, but tolerable. There was a small goof in the logistics at check in, but it was corrected in mere minutes, and they credited my account immediately. Great place, great hosts. Highly recommend."
3803947,47302536,2015-09-17,22458501,Adrian,Perfect condo and perfect location. The condo was clean and everything was great. Daniela was always helpful and very fast to respond. I'll definitely rent again.
3803947,48360078,2015-09-25,36617034,Giselle,"Stayed for 3 days on business, would stay again. No complaints, beautiful unit, easy check in process, convenient/great location."
3803947,50256332,2015-10-10,31968966,Jim & Ronnie Lee,Amazing location and beautiful place would def stay again!
7397476,41824323,2015-08-09,37956908,Nick,"Andy was a fantastic host. When my S.O. and I arrived at the apartment, we were greeted with a thoughtful greeting card, a bottle of wine, and the air-conditioning already running. The apartment was nicely furnished and clean. There was also plenty of toiletries and towels. Andy checked in with us usually every other day to see how we were enjoying our stay and if there was anything else he could do for us. This was our first Airbnb experience; Andy truly exceeded our expectations. We would recommend Andy as a host to any traveler to Seattle."
7397476,42570044,2015-08-14,38927354,Michael,"Great location!! Being that it's high season it was a great value for the money. Our host, Andy was very helpful and accommodating. We arrived to a welcoming bottle of wine. Nice touch!!"
7397476,44203278,2015-08-24,40890815,Steven,"We really enjoyed our stay at this condo in Seattle. This was our first experience with Airbnb and everything went so smoothly that I can't wait to do it again. 

Andy and Lynne were super nice and very responsive to all our needs. They even sent us an electronic copy of a 67 page guide book they created, with local recommendations of sites and restaurants in the area, which we found very helpful during our stay. 

The condo was clean and in good condition, just as promised in the advertising. The neighborhood was nice and within walking distance of the friends that we were visiting. The only issue that we had during our stay, was that the keys were not present in the outside lock box when we arrived. However, Lynne showed up within 5 minutes after a call, to resolve the situation and provide keys. 

I hope that this unit is available when we want to visit Seattle again, because it had everything we needed, was conveniently located near our friends and stores (Safeway), and we literally saved thousands of dollars as compared to staying in a hotel. Definitely worth it!"
7397476,45413823,2015-09-02,3254361,Bilal,Description was accurate. Condo was great! Quiet neighborhood. 10min by car and 15-20min by public transport (bus stop very near) to Downtown. Andy is a great host and takes care if there are any issues (we ran out of toilet paper and he immediately responded). Even ordered and pre-paid for an Uber!
7397476,46816453,2015-09-13,5440976,Carlos Javier,"Really great place. We found it at the last minute we were very lucky to find it. truly is a hidden gem in the Seattle Capitol Hill/Madison ValleyArea. Great attentive  hosts. Amazing communication. Very helpful. Super chill. Made us feel home away from home. Truly the best location in the Seattle area in between everything you want to do within walking distance or Uber or the bus. Amazing restaurants, café and bakery's coffee you name it is just all around just walking distance. Would absolutely positively stay there again. Great bottle of wine and lots of goodies! "
7397476,47108580,2015-09-15,8999218,Christine,"Andy is quite possibly the best Airbnb host out there.  He was so warm and welcoming, stopping by to drop off items that we needed and doing everything in his power to make our stay as close to home as he could.  The neighborhood is close to shops and restaurants, making it a breeze to get around without a car.  We stopped by a local restaurant and Andy gave us his top recommendations for what to order!  Talk about hospitality :)  

The purpose of my trip was to attend an inspection of a house I placed an offer on, and Andy jumped at the opportunity to send me other possible listings and offering a helping hand.  

I highly recommend staying here for the Andy Morris experience."
7397476,48789997,2015-09-28,7986698,Deborah,"My group if three friends had a lovely stay at Thomas Lodge 2, while we attended a nerdy convention at the Bell Harbor Centre. The place was clean and very comfortable, we felt right at home.

Though we didn't meet Andy until our last day, he was always immediately available by text message and checked in to make sure we had everything we needed. 

I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Seattle."
4773614,24506534,2014-12-29,17482399,Zoey,Great location and the perfect size for two people. Very clean and tidy! 
4773614,28374619,2015-03-22,3625064,Charles,The reservation was canceled 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
825574,16210824,2014-07-23,11515178,Noah,"Anne was wonderful to work with.  She was very responsive both prior to and during the visit.  Anne introduced herself, but left us to ourselves while we were there, and was very respectful of our space and privacy. The apartment was beautiful, just as pictured, and very comfortable.  The neighborhood was ideal for us - a little bit removed from downtown, so quiet, yet still accessible through public transportation, with several nice restaurants within walking distance.   And only a 15-20 minute bus ride to city center.  I would definitely stay at the Urban Oasis again when I come back to Seattle."
825574,17374753,2014-08-11,937131,Christian,"Anne's urban oasis in Seattle is great! The apartment is the downstairs of her house and is obviously recently remodeled with great care. Despite being downstairs (partial basement) the space is very light and very spacious. The apartment seems like a high-end hotel suite - the linen on the bed is very high quality, the bathroom is great, the living room/dining room is comfortable with very nice furniture. The kitchen is basic but functional. In short, the space is incredibly nice and we were very happy staying there.
Anne was also a very nice host. She accommodated a change for us in the stay and was easy to communicate with before the stay. She has made a little folder for the neighborhood and we walked to several of the recommended places. The apartment is within easy walking distance to very nice restaurants and cafes. We really enjoyed the neighborhood. 
I would very much recommend staying at Anne's apartment. "
825574,17838834,2014-08-18,15370954,Cindy,Anne was an excellent host and her place was fantastic!!! We felt right at home and loved the neighborhood. We tasted wonderful food from restaurants Anne recommended and breakfast at Coastal Kitchen was yummy! We couldn't have been happier!!! Thanks Anne! 
825574,18098974,2014-08-21,2482510,Shelly,"""Urban Oasis"" is a lovely apartment space with a wonderful host!  The private apartment is located in a beautiful part of Seattle's Capitol Hill District, and is walking distance to numerous shops and restaurants.  It is also only a few blocks from the transportation line that will take you into the Downtown area.  My boyfriend and I were only in Seattle for 2 nights, and wanted to explore all areas of the city. We were able to park our car for the entire time in Seattle, and travel by foot or bus (which is exactly what we wanted).  
Anne (who is incredibly knowledgeable about the city), was able to give us a great list of ""where to go"" and ""what to see"".  The apartment also has a binder filled with various restaurant menus and additional information about the city (bus schedules, etc).  Upon our check it, we were also greeted with a plate of freshly baked cookies :-)
If you're looking to stay in a charming, zen part of the city, I would recommend staying here."
825574,18320069,2014-08-25,17764990,Mary,"Anne made me feel very welcome.  Not only does she provide a lovely apartment to stay in, I found cookies waiting for me.  The apartment was very well appointed and I could have cooked for an army with all the dishes provided, but I didn't.  The only thing I didn't find until the last day was a box of tissues which were in plain sight (almost) in the bedroom. "
825574,19330570,2014-09-10,8490833,Ralph,"Anne's apartment is fantastic! The space, which appears newly remodeled, is clean, quiet and elegant and is lacking nothing.  We could have happily stayed for weeks. Although there is a well equipped kitchen, there are so many great dining options within a 5 minute walk, we rarely used it. Anne was great about steering us toward the best eateries and other nearby attractions.  The location is really amazing--quiet, safe neighborhood streets accessible to good food, coffee and great ice cream--all life's essentials. 

Anne was great about keeping in touch, laying out expectations and her whole listing is spot on. We will return for certain"
825574,19697020,2014-09-16,19198179,David,It is a great place. Very tastefully redone. It was great for me to relax and get ready for a long work day! No negative feedback at all. My only issue is the price. I come to Seattle about 5 times a year and my org won't pay for this more than once.
825574,20516674,2014-09-30,6292932,Virginia,"Anne's apartment met all of our expectations.  We had a car so it was easy to find.  We didn't have any trouble finding parking on the street in front of the house.  

The apartment is very quiet and had everything that we needed for a comfortable three day visit.  It was spotless which is obviously a high priority for Anne.  We would definately return and highly recommend it to others.  "
825574,20757510,2014-10-05,2413342,Carine,"Anne's urban oasis was just wonderful. Super clean and aesthetically pleasing it was a perfect place to explore Seattle. Great neighborhood , tree lined streets, cafes, restaurants...and had all the amenities one could hope for. It was very easy to check in and out and Anne was a superb host who gave us tips about her city when we needed as well as plenty of space and privacy . Excellent experience...We 'D definitely stay here again! Thanks !"
825574,21245061,2014-10-13,2708559,Nancy,"Anne's place was great! The apartment was clean and well-stocked, and she gave us great information on places to go in the city. I look forward to staying there again the next time I'm in Seattle.  "
825574,21885592,2014-10-26,21418401,Mark,"Thank you, Anne. The Urban Oasis worked great. It is a very clean, well stocked and spacious one bedroom in a great location. I would definitely come again. "
825574,23166715,2014-11-24,247164,Manuel,We couldn't have asked for a better location! Super close to everything we wanted to do. Very cute neighborhood that is extremely quiet and full of charm. We met Anne on our second day in town and she was able to provide some really great recommendations. Comfy bed too! Thanks for having us! 
825574,25877067,2015-01-28,4763914,Robert,"Great neighborhood, lovely apartment, warm, helpful, responsive and welcoming host. Comfortable bed, newly renovated apartment. We have no hesitation at all about staying again and again. It is by far the best we have found on Airbnb on Capitol Hill."
825574,28032186,2015-03-16,28362517,Patricia,Lovely apartment in a charming neighborhood. I really enjoyed the stay and having the ability to walk to the local restaurants. Anne was very informative and professional. I'd definitely stay at Urban Oasis again.
825574,29751090,2015-04-12,8490833,Ralph,"Once again we had a wonderful stay at Anne's apartment. It is quiet, spacious, calming and, best of all, in one of the best neighborhoods in Seattle. Several great restaurants are less than a block away and many others a short walk. Great coffee and even groceries are within a short walk and  downtown is a 10 minute car ride. Anne is accommodating and unintrusive and has done a beautiful job of decorating and maintaining the apartment. We will continue to make this our home base when visiting Seattle."
825574,32123460,2015-05-14,17739850,Linzi,I love Anne's apartment which is large and super clean! She almost provided everything we needed. The decor of living room is cool and light is bright. The restaurants in neighbourhood are quite good. It was a nice experience staying there.
825574,33151616,2015-05-25,32793547,Paul,"What a wonderful place to stay in Seattle! Beautiful home in a neighborhood well-situated for getting around the city. The Urban Oasis has all of the amenities you'd need and a nice level of privacy. I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family! Thank you, Anne, for sharing your place with the AirBnb community! "
825574,33521407,2015-05-29,10547000,Christine,"The place was perfect for our little family.  It was clean and up to date.  We met Anne briefly as we entered the place.  She left us alone, unless we had a question or needed something.  The neighborhood was cute with several restaurants around the corner.  I would definitely come back if we return to Seattle.  Thanks Anne!"
825574,34330762,2015-06-07,27981557,James,"The apartment is huge and very clean.  Everything looks like it's new and it's all well maintained.  Overall the apartment is amazing and it's a great place to come back to after a long day out in the city.

The neighborhood is amazing, it really is an oasis.  Every day I woke up and walked to a different coffee shop to try something new and you can always find something good to eat in the neighborhood.

Anne was a great host, she even came down to greet me despite me arriving close to midnight.  She has great recommendations for restaurants and things to see in the are and made the experience great."
825574,34961119,2015-06-14,31740626,Ash & Anna,"This place is amazing! Clean and very spacious, the pictures do not do it justice. It is in a great area of Seattle with many restaurants, bars, coffee shops, bakeries, etc within walking distance. We had a rental car during our stay and parking was quite easy on the street. Anne was a gracious host, she was easy and fun to chat with if we needed but let us do our own thing which was nice. I would not hesitate to stay here again!"
825574,35229377,2015-06-16,2201355,Lisa-Maree,We were so happy with our experience staying at the Urban Oasis. Just as described and even better than the pics. Very open plan and very clean inside. We loved it! It was so nice having our own apartment for the time we were there. Anne was so helpful with directions and tips. It is in a fantastic location and only a $6 uber right into downtown area. Couldn't be happier :) thanks so much Anne :) 
825574,36124335,2015-06-25,6340539,Leila,"Fantastic place to stay! I loved the space. Everything was so clean, which I appreciate, as well as being comfortable and homey. Anne had many nice amenities and details throughout the apartment. Fully stocked kitchen, wonderful bathroom, beautiful large sofa, and comfortable bed.  It is nicer than the photos. It is a really great space. I thought it was sweet she even had an urgent care number listed if needed. The apartment was very quiet, but you could hear people walking above in the house easily. "
825574,37160414,2015-07-05,520899,Ambler,The place was perfect: clean and comfortable. Such a great location. We had everything we needed. Anne was responsive and her instructions were easy and straightforward. Thanks for providing a lovely launching pad for an awesome weekend in Seattle! 
825574,37661107,2015-07-09,32517710,Maria,"The Urban Oasis was even better than we had expected! The neighborhood was quiet, yet just couple blocks away you had all the services needed like nice park, grocery store, restaurants etc. And the place itself was a true oasis, and decorated with such a good style! During our stay it was a heat wave in Seattle so the apartment was for us a cool oasis after a long day of sightseeing and exploring the city. Many thanks to Anne, absolutely the best place on our three week road trip in States & CAN.

"
825574,38553232,2015-07-16,2792119,Isabelle,"Anne's flat was very welcoming and cosy. Everything was spotless, the furnishings elegant and functional and the kitchen well stocked. The neighbourhood is very quiet but has plenty of restaurant options nearby; it's a short 15 minute drive to downtown Seattle. Parking on the street is free and was never a problem. It wasn't entirely clear to us from the description of the flat that it is in a basement, but a reasonable amount of natural light gets in and as noted the flat is very nicely arranged, so that surprise ended up being a minor disappointment. Anne was a welcoming host who gave us useful tips about the neighbourhood and nearby activities."
825574,38994046,2015-07-20,20383677,Stephen,Urban Oasis was the perfect place to stay in Seattle. The apartment was spotlessly clean and very well organized. Ann was the perfect host and responded very quickly to our queries. I would have no hesitation in recommending Urban Oasis. 
825574,41072247,2015-08-04,1866672,Jj,"Anne was an amazing host and we had the best time in Seattle. Her home was clean and comfortable in an amazing location! She also helped out with great neighborhood advice when we needed it.

I will definitely stay there again the next time I am in Seattle."
825574,41366431,2015-08-07,6928763,Anna,Our stay at Urban Oasis was great! The place and the location was perfect to discover Seattle. Within a block from the apartment there are great restaurants and coffee places as well as some cool shops and Anne had created a really good list with the best places. The apartment had everything you need and was very clean and tidy. We would definitely stay here again! 
825574,44644703,2015-08-28,16473606,Camilla,"John and I had a wonderful and very relaxing stay in this gem of an Airbnb accommodation. The apartment was really comfortable and very stylishly decorated with plenty of space inside and with a small front yard where we enjoyed our morning coffee while watching people and dogs walking by. The location was perfect too, in walking distance to several really good restaurants, bars, coffee shops and ice cream places.  Access to public transport was excellent - and it took only 10-15 minutes to get to downtown. The host, Anne had provided us with plenty of information on how to get around and with lots of good restaurant recommendations. We would definitely recommend the Urban Oasis for anyone visiting Seattle for a getaway or a longer stay as it immediately feels like your own home in a very pleasant neighbourhood."
825574,46273956,2015-09-09,8017055,Zach,"This location is excellent! We walked and took public transit everywhere and were out and about each day of our stay. It was great to be able to walk around the corner to a solid dinner spot upon arriving late our first night in town. After dinner each night we enjoyed walking around the Capitol Hill neighborhood, there's lots of beautiful houses to check out and it felt like a very safe and welcoming neighborhood. The apartment itself is very nice, well designed, and completely updated. It's easy to get in and out, private, and very quiet (although you will hear the host family walking around in the house above). The kitchen is nice and full of whatever utensils you need. The place even had a nice TV (with cable), and a sound system (which we didn't get to test out).
"
825574,47359874,2015-09-18,13936490,Heather,"Urban Oasis was just as the name suggests, a home away from home, clean with attractive interior design on a quiet street accessible to various shops, markets, restaurants, and parks. Anne was away during our stay and returned the day of our departure. She was responsive via email and text to a question we had about how to use the remote controls. The kitchen was conveniently stocked with all the necessities for us to cook on occasion. We mistakenly thought we had another night reserved and therefore were not prepared to check out on time. After Anne alerted us of this, we rushed to gather our belongings and set off to find a Plan B! Overall, we enjoyed our stay and highly recommend the place to others looking for a true Urban Oasis. "
825574,47690890,2015-09-21,7175335,Cindy,"This was a great place in a lovely neighborhood with great restaurants/coffee shops within easy walking distance.  Restaurant suggestions were great by the host.  Space was fully furnished with kitchen/laundry and everything you might need.
Really highly recommend this place.
15 minutes from the downtown area/Space Needle/Pike's Market and not hard to find at all.  Parking on street was always easy to find."
825574,49777743,2015-10-06,12502963,Andi,"Just a beautiful little stay in Capitol Hill! Anne was fabulous, exceptionally informative, and an impeccable host - straight down to the fresh cookies that awaited my arrival. Having a washer and dryer available to use at one's leisure while traveling is a PHENOMENAL perk to this Air BnB. The location is also unbeatable. I fell in love with the neighborhood, as I was warned I would!"
825574,50320140,2015-10-11,4498467,Natalie,"My husband and I had the most wonderful stay at the Urban Oasis! We felt right at home and absolutely loved the location. Great restaurants, coffee shops, and a delicious ice cream parlor right around the corner! Anne was a fantastic host. She gave us wonderful tips on the area and the city which we followed and made our weekend that much more enjoyable. We even arrived to home made cookies! There is no where else we would have rather stayed! "
825574,51148915,2015-10-18,20330998,Natisha,"Anne's home was comfortable and as welcoming as herself! Anne said hello after we settled in and offered up some local recommendations to help us get our bearings in the neighborhood.  The apartment has a built-in, automatic fireplace which was perfect during a light Seattle rainstorm.  It's quite large with all the accommodations one would need- kitchen, stocked bathroom, even a laundry room.  At night, we slept well in a cozy, plush bed.  In all,  a fantastic location, a great place, and a lovely host!"
825574,53353629,2015-11-08,1286461,Nico,Anne was an absolutely wonderful host with and amazing home! This was my first time in Seattle and I absolutely fell in love. Thank you so much for such an outstanding trip!

825574,55386761,2015-12-01,43942201,Derek,"Anne was a great host! The listing was even more beautiful than the photos portray. It was walking distance to everything in Cap Hill, which was perfect. Anne left easy to follow directions too. I would stay here again!"
825574,55864613,2015-12-06,23674786,Matt,"The Urban Oasis was fantastic. Well situated in Capitol Hill near several boutique shops and restaurants. All the amenities one looks for in traveling: personal space, a full kitchen, a well appointed bedroom and bathroom and even laundry if you need to get it done on the go. I highly recommend this spot for Seattle visitors and know where to stay when I'm back in town!

Thank you : )"
825574,56207715,2015-12-10,43644644,Nathaniel,"Anne was great. The suite is exactly as listed - brand new, clean and cozy. And the neighbourhood is perfect - centrally located for getting around Seattle, and convenient for just going out for a walk and having a dinner, a drink or a coffee at one of several great restaurants and cafes on 19th Ave."
2723368,12324599,2014-04-28,13388602,Benoit,"We had a great stay at Connie's! We were really last minute and she could arrange us something, every thing was nice and clean and we would certainly recommend anyone traveling to Seattle to stay at Connie's place!

Thanks again!"
2723368,12574723,2014-05-05,99110,Don,"Connie lives in a quiet residential neighborhood in north Seattle, just east of Ballard. It's out of the way -- in a good way -- yet convenient to all parts of the city. She offers what amounts to a main-floor guest suite, with a bedroom and attached private bath. The rooms are clean, well-lit and comfortable and Connie provides a selection of breakfast foods. She's an engaging hostess and if you're lucky, you may get to meet her identical twin sister! "
2723368,13057176,2014-05-18,7417694,Luca,"Connie is a wonderful host with a beautiful, very spacious house. We enjoyed our three nights a lot and would highly recommend to stay there, especially if you like an included breakfast, two bikes to explore the city and a garden you can bbq in. Thanks!"
2723368,13478066,2014-05-28,14452859,Randall,"Our host Connie was very nice and polite. We only saw her a few times during our stay and it was always pleasant.

The room was small but clean and having our own bathroom with separate shower and sink areas was very nice. The house was well kept and quiet. The neighborhood likewise was very quiet and nice. It's a good place to get away, not too far from anywhere including downtown.

I would definitely recommend this as a place to stay in the future."
2723368,14247947,2014-06-15,1278380,Shana,Connie's place was lovely and fit our needs perfectly.  We were only able to meet her briefly before she went out of town but she was very kind and hospitable.  We even enjoyed some fresh raspberries from her backyard! 
2723368,14332000,2014-06-16,8179871,Sara,Connie was so accommodating to help me out with a last minute reservation.  Her friend was able to let us in since Connie was away.  The home was spacious and lovely.  The room was cozy and clean.  We were only a short drive from the Fremont area where we grabbed a yummy dinner out.  I'd stay again and would love to meet Connie.
2723368,15497782,2014-07-10,16395883,Bob,Connie was the best! Everything was as described and more so. We felt like friends after 10 minutes or so (my wife and Connie grew up in the same hometown). Highly recommended!
2723368,15833405,2014-07-16,8216846,Raina,"Connie was an excellent host! My boyfriend and I could not have felt more welcome and at home than we did at her Phinney Getaway. The house itself was spacious and beautiful, with a great view of the mountains both from her back porch and front lawn. She also served us a delicious breakfast every morning, and often went out of her way to make special accommodations. We also appreciated her overall very welcoming but laid back and unobtrusive demeanor. The house is in walking distance to bars, restaurants, and coffee shops just a few blocks away, as well as about a 20 minute walk to both downtown Ballard and Green Lake. We will definitely be back! "
2723368,16014049,2014-07-20,4274489,Landon,"Connie's place was excellent. The location is superb, just near Green lake and a quick bus ride from downtown Seattle. The home is well taken care of and Connie has done a fabulous job gardening  in the back, with delicious raspberries during summertime. The view of the Olympic mountains and Puget sound from the breakfast table is amazing. I also had an enjoyable time getting to know Connie and learning about her work as a yoga instructor. She was quite accomodating of me when I had to arrive late a couple of nights. I am quite grateful. I would gladly stay at her place again. "
2723368,16131447,2014-07-22,6340407,Mary Jo,"I enjoyed a most comfortable overnight. The bed is extremely comfortable, the shower is great, and breakfast is delicious. I would definitely stay again."
2723368,18789789,2014-09-01,16189958,Cathy,"I had a wonderful vacation with my son in Connie's place. It is really quiet, clean and comfortable. The location is excellent as well, just across the Wood Land Park Zoo and there are various nice restaurants, cafe and a pie store near by there. We enjoyed the park in fornt of zoo, the cozy room and the kitchen with fabulous view. I am grateful for Connie's host, she is really hospitable and willing to take time for guests. I think there are no more words to prove how excellent Connie's place is besides we had flighted for 13 hours away from our country and stayed there for one month with immense gratification . 
"
2723368,19284102,2014-09-09,1185686,Dennis,"What a wonderful setting!  And we came at the perfect time of the year.  Connie was a great host and very gracious in giving us access to the entire first floor - great kitchen with eat-in table, dining room, living room, and most importantly - a GREAT deck under the trees and next to her garden.  Fresh raspberries were plentiful and delicious!  Our room was comfortable and the bedroom and bathroom spotless.  Thank you, Connie!  We'll be back!"
2723368,19534521,2014-09-14,5245309,Laura,"We loved staying at Connie's.  She was welcoming and gracious.  The room is small, but the main floor --including living room, dining room, kitchen with dining area and beautiful deck and yard is spacious, very clean and aesthetic.  We actually ended up having guests visit us there, which we had not expected, and everyone felt comfortable and at home.  It is a lovely home, fabulous deck with view.  We highly recommend it!."
2723368,23429025,2014-12-01,21177788,Alexandro,"I had a wonderful time during the 2 months I spent at Connie's place. She is always available and very helpful, an excellent host!

The location is just great, with plenty of places to eat and lots of mexican restaurants nearby (walking distance). The neighbourhood is friendly and makes you feel at home: I even participated in Halloween and Thanksgiving activities (love it!). The place is also very quiet, and I tremendously enjoyed it.

Overall I highly recommend it and will certainly stay at Connie's place again if I come back to Seattle in the future!"
2723368,23985827,2014-12-15,24769828,Seth,"My brief stay was great in every way. Connie is a wonderful host, and the guest room & bath is fine. Bed is good too! I chose it for location close to an event in Ballard; I think that's important in Seattle, or you spend a lot of time driving. This location is very convenient to several of the central areas.  "
2723368,24301090,2014-12-25,17840945,Margot,"Connie's place was very homey and welcoming. While the bedroom was small, the bed was very comfortable and the connecting bath areas were clean and well appointed. I appreciated her homemade chai tea and hospitality. "
2723368,25050701,2015-01-05,12103069,Nik & Nadia,"Connie is great. She is very friendly. The house is also really nice. It has the best view in Seattle that I have seen also the neighborhood is very quiet. there are some nice bards around the neighborhood. 

The house seems very new. The bedroom might seem a little small but overall you won't feel it since the other parts of the house the living room and kitchen is very big and overall a great experience.  

Nadia and I certainly had a great time. Connie is truly a superhost."
2723368,25603362,2015-01-20,8920667,Michael,Very nice host and accommodations.  Location was ideal for my needs.
2723368,27050645,2015-02-24,25648824,Leo,"Maravillosa la estadía en la casa de Connie. Muy cómoda y amplia la casa, con todas las facilidades. La mejor vista de todo Seattle desde la cocina.
El barrio es muy tranquilo. Se llega rapidamente caminando a Ballard o a Fremont. Hay muchos buses cerca. El lago Greenwood está solo a 10 minutos caminando.
Connie es una persona muy cálida y atenta. Ella es lo mejor de Seattle!. Gracias Connie
 "
2723368,28638612,2015-03-27,29791487,Dionne,"We really enjoyed our stay. Very clean home and comfortable bed. Very good shower too. Connie was gone, so our host Susie was very gracious, accommodating our arrival time. I will definitely look them up again if in the area.
Close to the Woodland Park Zoo, which we visited the next day."
2723368,32847821,2015-05-22,8800276,Steve,"Everything as listed.  Good coffee, great view and a pleasant, friendly host."
2723368,33940229,2015-06-02,17148364,Marianne,"Nous avons utilisé le compte airbnb de notre fille pour réserver notre chambre chez Connie et nous en sommes très contents. 
Nous avons été très bien reçus : Connie est à la fois très prévenante et très discrète. La maison et le jardin sont très agréables, avec une vue sur les montagnes de la péninsule olympique. La chambre est petite mais jolie et le lit est particulièrement confortable. La salle de bain est spacieuse et très confortable. 
Pas complètement central si vous n'avez pas de voiture, mais calme et très fleuri et facilement accessible en bus."
2723368,35225026,2015-06-16,32622986,Julie,"Thank you for your hospitality Connie. I had a pleasant stay with you. I appreciated your suggestions of things to do and the offer of your bicycle. I especially enjoyed your yard - great view, beautiful flowers and lovely neighborhood."
2723368,36120562,2015-06-25,31345545,EHawk,"Connie was a great host. We ran into each other a few times during our stay. The listing is very accurate, the house is beautiful and warm. There's a lot to offer in Phinney, and it's fun to walk the neighborhood with great views, coffee shops, and tasty things to eat."
2723368,39143397,2015-07-21,25363171,David,A lovely (email hidden)anquil setting and close to restaurants/services and public transport.Connie is attentive but unobtrusive.I spent almost a month there and had a great time.If you enjoy gardens and gardening this will be an added bonus.Highly recommended.
2723368,39325357,2015-07-22,522363,Eric,"Connie's home on Phinney Ridge was a very quiet and comfortable place for my parents to stay, about a 15 minutes walk from my place.  Beautiful home and nice yard."
2723368,39465773,2015-07-23,39065029,Jim,"Great place to stay in a beautiful neighborhood. Connie was an accommodating host, and even gave us apples on our way out! This was our first airbnb experience, and we would definitely would stay here again."
2723368,39629298,2015-07-25,33598584,Lisa,"We had a wonderful time at Connie's place. Great location, beautiful view, and quiet. Bedroom and adjacent bathroom are very comfortable. We would definitely stay again."
2723368,40231988,2015-07-29,8376566,Trisha,"Connie was easy to communicate with prior to arrival an during our stay. She is a lovely friendly lady and made us feel welcome in her gorgeous home. The area of Phinney Ridge is wonderful - lots of gorgeous tree-lined street, fabulous homes and gardens and a lovely cafe scene. We fell in love with its laid-back, BoBo charm. It's easy to walk (downhill) to Fremont (and to get a bus back from there or the city).
Connie's home is spacious, comfortable, charming and has lovely views. The guest bedroom and bathroom is a good space, quiet and cosy. 
We loved staying at Connie's, feeling part of a neighbourhood and meeting Connie's sister and brother-on-law who live next door!"
2723368,40385449,2015-07-30,32619584,Ashley,"My parents stayed with Connie for the last two days and had very positive things to stay about the experience.  When I came to pick them up Connie was very welcoming and friendly.  In addition to being a lovely host, the residence boasts a beautiful garden and an amazing view of the Olympic Mountains."
2723368,40638891,2015-08-01,19580157,Nanwei,Connie was helpful. We had to leave very early in the morning and she helped us figuring out the right amount of time to get to Anacortes Ferry terminal. 
2723368,41091757,2015-08-04,2674582,Tim,"Can't really add anything that anyone else hasn't stated here - Connie's is a phenomenal place to stay at in Seattle and pretty much unbeatable value. I lived in Seattle 5 years and know the cleanest, safest, best locale neighborhoods to live, and Connie's house is right in the middle of all of those decriptors in phinney ridge. The room is cute and not very big, but the bed is comfortable and the bathroom is all yours! Just as nice as any upper echelon hotel room, but the rest of the floor is also yours to explore if need be, and the yard is fantastic. Connie herself is super sweet and convivial without invading on your personal space and time - a perfect host. A wonderful airbnb experience - once again, super highly recommended. "
2723368,43023130,2015-08-17,29888771,Keith,"We really enjoyed chatting with Connie, and the breakfasts she made for us.  Connie had information about events going on and shopping nearby (though our focus was on looking after our grandchildren who live a few blocks away).  Connie's house is attractive and comfortable. The neighbourhood of Phinney Ridge is quite beautiful with older houses and great views of the Olympic mountains across Puget Sound.  Walking north on Phinney or adjacent streets is very pleasant, but guests should perhaps be cautioned that the east-west roads on each side of the ridge are quite steep."
2723368,43324755,2015-08-18,41271191,Ziv,"I had a short but very pleasant stay at Connie's house. The neighborhood is very quiet and family oriented, and is within a short walking distance from a few small inviting restaurants.

Upon arrival Connie greeted me with a delicious pear cake made with pears from a tree in her backyard."
2723368,49405481,2015-10-03,26769159,Trudi,"Connie's place is in a quiet residential neighborhood, the bed is very comfortable, and we slept great after a night out in nearby Ballard. Fresh ground coffee in the morning, and fruit from the garden for breakfast! The area is full of wonderful old homes, and very close to the Woodland Park Zoo. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks for a great stay, Connie."
2723368,49802505,2015-10-06,43225071,Sigh,"A friend and I stayed with Connie for a dance weekend and found the experience very pleasant. The house had enough space that we were able to come in late without disturbing Connie and location is great. The house is kept a little cooler than I like, but Connie offered to adjust the thermostat, which was perfect."
2723368,51406961,2015-10-19,46604622,Brad,"Connie was a wonderful and sweet host. It was very nice to wake up and have a delicious coffee cake and some wonderful conversations. The rooms were kept so neat and clean. 

Thanks for a wonderful stay Connie!"
2723368,52539950,2015-10-30,1147826,Victoria,"I stayed for a week with Connie, and she was a wonderful host providing for all of my needs. I appreciated her attentiveness and also the fact that she gave me plenty of privacy. The room was comfortable and it was wonderful having accessing to the kitchen. In addition, the location is convenient to downtown as well as many great neighborhoods."
2723368,53435132,2015-11-08,9108649,W,"Host Connie quickly and kindly came to the rescue when I was able to travel last minute to Seattle for family business. Although out-of-town, she arranged for her sister to welcome me to her lovely home. First floor room with a big cozy bed and a separate bathroom a few steps away. Conveniently located in a quiet, safe area with plenty of free street parking. 
I fell in love with the quiet Phinney Ridge area, the fall foliage, and the view of Puget Sound from the kitchen window and garden plantings. 
Connie's sister graciously offered me her ferry schedules and info regarding nearby eateries, gas stations, etc. I would be happy to return."
2723368,54223849,2015-11-16,35006145,Courtney,"Connie was a warm and wonderful host that provided everything I needed.  Her home was in a great location for me to explore and take in the zoo, along with walks and the meetings I needed to get to.  She was a warm and very helpful person whose space was exactly as described, warm and comfy....and green.  Yeah.   Thanks so much.  Love to return.   "
2723368,54858110,2015-11-25,44870510,Frances,"Connie was a perfect hostess. She made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed.  She even checked on us when we had a 24 hr. virus.  Our room, bath and bed were so comfortable and we had open use of the kitchen and living room. Her home was quite conveniently located and there was a spectacular view of the Olympic mountains.  We hope to stay with her again. "
2723368,55266718,2015-11-29,32710190,Theresa,"Connie is a lovely host!  Her home was inviting, clean and conveniently located.  It was more like a B&B, the pear coffee cake was a hit.

Would definitely would rebook and refer this Abnb!"
2723368,56269327,2015-12-11,9468653,Tony,Connie was very welcoming and the room was as advertised. We would for sure stay here again. 
3441402,15200751,2014-07-04,15584667,Justin,Jessica was a wonderful host! She was very accommodating and it felt like we had a little home-away-from-home. The bed was comfy and we had plenty of room. It was a great experience for us and we would definitely stay here again if in Seattle. 
3441402,15844786,2014-07-16,15696314,Marisa,"Jessica's private cabin was perfect for what we needed for our trip to Seattle. The cabin was stocked with toiletries and breakfast snacks and was easy to get to downtown Seattle. It was perfect! Thank you Jessica, we will definitely be back the next time we are visiting the area. "
3441402,16308494,2014-07-25,5597835,Nancy,"The neighborhood was  nice & quiet. Jessica and her husband were very welcoming. We only had a face to face with them once, but she showed us where everything was located and how to use the air conditioner if we needed it. Nice large room to sleep in and great kitchen set up. There was everything you would possibly need. When we go back to the Seattle area, we will definitely check to see if the Cozy Cabin is available."
3441402,16444084,2014-07-27,18777742,Joe,Jessica was very accommodating and the say was great. 
3441402,16489632,2014-07-28,8941604,Natalia,"Jessica is awesome! She is very accommodating and will help you with anything. I loved the place, hope I can come back! It was the perfect trip. "
3441402,16570516,2014-07-29,10251102,Ellene,"Jessica was very communicative prior to our stay and was graciously flexible with our arrival, as well. The cabin was cute, cozy, and very clean. It was just what we were looking for and was within biking distance of great food and bar options. We would gladly return for a longer stay!"
3441402,17374477,2014-08-11,2740364,Bryan,The cabin felt secluded and private and was also conveniently located for our Seattle visit.  Jessica was responsive and flexible about arranging to check in and had great tips for restaurants and cafes in the neighborhood.  She made us feel at home and then left us alone to enjoy our quiet weekend.
3441402,17484236,2014-08-12,6222644,Christina,"Our stay at Jessica's was amazing. The cabin was nice and cool on a very hot Seattle day. We took advantage of their great location and walked to Elliot Bay Brewing Co. for dinner. The bed was amazingly comfortable and we enjoyed using the kitchen in the morning to make coffee and have a little breakfast before hitting the road again. A lovely clean and quiet stay!
"
3441402,17638843,2014-08-15,18776351,Jim,The cabin was beautiful and comfortable.  Jessica made staying very easy and hassle free.  She was communicative and helpful through the whole process.  I couldn't have possibly asked for a better experience and would absolutely stay again given the opportunity!
3441402,17731700,2014-08-16,9840356,Diana,"The cabin is absolutely adorable. Everything we needed was in the cabin including plates, cups, silverware, and a fridge. The bed was very comfortable and cozy. Jessica was very prompt in responding to the booking request and all other messages. She is very kind!! We're looking forward to stopping here again in the future."
3441402,17957018,2014-08-19,18744153,Shyla,"Staying in Jessica's cute cabin was my first experience using Airbnb, and let me tell you, she set the bar high for all my future travels. Jessica was very accommodating, we ended up getting rained out of our camping spot and she was kind enough to let us check in hours before our set check in time. The cabin was absolutely great, it was clean as could be and was equipped with everything we needed. One of the most convenient things about the cabin was how close you are to bus stops that take you right downtown! My stay in the cabin was awsome, and I definitely recomend this place to anyone looking to stay in the Seattle area! Thank you for being such a great host Jessica. I hope to stay with you again on our next trip to Seattle! 

 Shyla"
3441402,18197670,2014-08-23,19534488,Nari,"We couldn't have asked for better a better place to stay during our two-day trip to Seattle. Jessica was a very welcoming host, and she provided everything we could have possibly needed, including a parking spot for our rental car! "
3441402,18548464,2014-08-28,7654960,Tarita,"Jessica cabin was fantastic, really surprised us! Jessica is very helpful and provided us with everything we need. the neighborhood has all the facilities to make our stay perfect! we highly recommend this cabin!"
3441402,18944547,2014-09-03,17923448,Matt,It was just what you advertised. It was great to put a face with your name the first day. Check out was a breeze.
3441402,19439117,2014-09-12,10933156,Peyton,"Jessica made me feel very welcome with her warm emails. She is an excellent communicator. The house is located in a quiet, peaceful neighborhood, tucked away from the noise of city life. The bed is comfortable, and it has a full kitchen. There is even a creek at the end of the yard. I found a Safeway store and Starbuck's in a shopping center en route between the freeway and the house, so picking up supplies was easy. If you want to stay in the city but feel like you're in the country, then this could be the place for you. "
3441402,19613416,2014-09-15,11570697,Mawuli,Well I can't say much about Jessica because I never met her but the room was super clean the place was very private her emails to me were very helpful.
3441402,19694479,2014-09-16,20535668,Jennifer,"This was a nice place to stay. Quiet neighborhood, very residential. The cabin feels private tucked in the back of two other houses. Jessica did a good job of making it easy to find the cabin and explaining the expectations for guests. I felt like we got exactly what we were expecting."
3441402,19900580,2014-09-20,209449,Jerry,My wife and I had a very pleasant stay in Jessica's cabin. Very private and fully equipped. Absolutely nothing missing. Very easy to make yourself feel right at home. Communication with Jessica was easy and quick and she truly made us feel welcome. The bed was comfortable and the cabin clean and tidy. Lots of towels in the bathroom and even adequate supplies of sundries. The kitchen was fully equipped and would definitely lend itself to a long term stay. We never got to meet Jessica but her frequent messages and emails to us made her feel right there if we needed her. The cabin is behind 2 other homes and far enough from the street so that street noise in this quiet area is not an issue. Overall a perfect Airbnb experience at an very reasonable rate for a unit only 20 minutes from downtown Seattle by car. 
3441402,19981794,2014-09-21,13758140,Paul,"A cozy little cottage, just as advertised."
3441402,20048184,2014-09-22,9909246,Sangeeta,"I never got a chance to meet Jessica face-to- face but she did an excellent job with being professional and very quick to respond to me via airbnb messaging system. The cabin was clean and cosy. Checking in and out was simple. The rules of the cabin were printed with the information any guest would have, such and the wifi login, the shower knobs and how to checkout.  "
3441402,20143428,2014-09-24,19253280,Gail,The cabin was wonderful. Listening to the stream was soothing. Jessica was very helpful and research some information for us even with her busy schedule. Enjoyed fresh air with the back door open all night. Close to restaurants and stores. Jessica was very friendly! Will  stay there again for sure!
3441402,20294726,2014-09-27,20581535,Stephanie & Victoria,"Jessica is so warm and friendly! We really enjoyed our time in the cabin and would recommend it to anyone. The location is a little hidden which could be positive or negative for someone because we had a little bit of a hard time finding it but Jessica gave really clear instructions so once we had the exact directions in front of us, we got there fine. 

The bed is very firm. Many people love a firm bed and it took a little adjustment due to owning a memory foam but ended up great.

The rule sheet was nice because there was no gray rules so we knew exactly what was expected out of us. If anything, the recycling and trash rules could have been explained a little more since we are not from a composting and recycling city.

Overall, it was a wonderful stay; not noisy, she stayed out of our hair and respected our privacy, there was  nothing lacking in the kitchen, bathroom or bedroom; we had shampoo, conditioner, lotions, extra bed linens, all kitchen appliances and all for such a wonderful low cost!"
3441402,20434412,2014-09-29,4158789,Ken,"Jessica met us on arrival and took us through the cabin and reviewed the rules. The directions to the address were clear and easy to follow. 
The cabin was clean, comfortable and quiet. Our stay was short but with the fully appointed kitchen and full size fridge would recommend it for a longer visit also.
It's well located and close to I-5, and amenities."
3441402,20932486,2014-10-07,20163438,Annabel,"Jessica is communicative, organized and helpful at the same time she gives space and privacy.  The price of the cabin is excellent for the value.  It's a straight forward, clean, comfortable and spacious.  It's also very quiet~"
3441402,21253817,2014-10-13,10214928,Judy & Frank,"Jessica was very quick to respond.  The cabin is what I would call a very basic accommodation.  Good kitchen with all the necessary items.  It was very quiet & private.  We never even saw the owners.  There is a TV but you cannot even get local channels, which would have been nice.  The only place to sit is either at the kitchen table or on the bed.  It would be nice to have a comfortable chair or couch to sit and read in the open area by the fireplace.  We would have turned the fireplace on in the bedroom area but there were no instructions so I don't know if it even works.  The biggest downer was the bed.  One of the worst we have slept on.  It is hard as a rock & terribly uncomfortable.  There is not even a mattress pad on the bed, which I find unusual and the sheets & covers were not what I call high quality.   I have a rental so I know what makes a good comfortable one and I feel like I know what I am talking about. I would not return based strictly on the bed.  I feel that is the one item that should be very comfortable & high quality.  Sorry."
3441402,21367954,2014-10-15,9209977,Terri,"Jessica sent very helpful e-mails concerning the cabin prior to arrival.  The cabin was very well furnished, as advertised, and off a wooded side street, away from the hustle and bustle of Seattle.  A few more detailed directions to the cabin would have been helpful--it's easy to miss.  We had a very nice stay."
3441402,21538345,2014-10-19,8894629,Luna,"It was a long drive in the gray rain, and I was glad to have such an easy check-in. The cabin is welcoming, and the host accommodating and friendly. While I never met her, she made my stay exactly what I needed. I was able to walk to my conference, and still have a private, quiet retreat to rest and sleep. "
3441402,22312063,2014-11-03,22061922,Adrienne,"This was my first time using Airbnb, which it was a positive experience.  Jessica was very accommodating.  The cabin was very cozy, clean and comfortable.  It was a great short stay (1 night).  I would definitely recommend it!"
3441402,22812718,2014-11-15,23398813,Daniel,The cabin is well suited to city living while maintaining a cabin in the woods feel. Great location for going out and staying in. Private and quiet. Not the place to throw parties! But a place to live peacefully.   
3441402,22936795,2014-11-17,12237905,Carol,"This is a real bargain, especially for your own place with a full kitchen! Cabin backs up on a ravine and it's quiet and relaxing. You'd hardly believe you're in town, near Northgate Mall and all amenities. Unit was super-clean, and comes with bedding, plateware, and everything you'd want to be self-sufficient.

Jessica left some candies, granola bars and other 'welcome' goodies, too.  I may be back!

There's no TV -- but for me, that was just fine."
3441402,23017881,2014-11-20,23389156,Pooja,"I loved staying at Jessica's cabin! It was my first experience with airbnb and I couldn't have asked for anything more. The place was exactly as described and very clean. The check-in process couldn't have been easier. I didn't meet Jessica personally, but she was always available via text/airbnb message in case I had any questions. I was visiting Seattle with a friend and we stayed at the cabin 2 nights before heading out to Olympic National Park. We loved staying at Jessica's cabin so much we tried to book it again when we returned from the park, but it was not available those dates. Great first airbnb experience! Thanks Jessica! "
3441402,23225996,2014-11-25,13111820,Ron,"Met us with key, friendly no issues"
3441402,23260783,2014-11-26,23398813,Daniel,Private and cozy. Great location to explore the city from and close to all the major convinces. 
3441402,23310367,2014-11-28,4983186,Jeannette,"A wonderfully quiet place to rest, cozy and spacious, comfortable and well set up. Jessica's communications were clear and consistent and my late arrival was easy."
3441402,25048034,2015-01-05,3287150,Saeed,"The cottage is amazing! Beautifully surrounded by trees and included everything you need for a pleasant stay: kitchenware, towels, even some snacks.
The location is convenient since it has easy access to I-5 highway and very close to north gate and shopping centers.
At my arrival, Jessica introduced herself and gave me a warm welcome. I'd definitely like to stay here again in the future!"
3441402,25646666,2015-01-21,22869685,Crystal,"We booked with Jessica last minute and she was immediately able to accommodate us. She also maintained great communication the entire time we were there, giving us a heads up on things happening around the area that may affect our stay. 
The cabin itself is extremely cozy, comfortable, and welcoming. It was wonderful coming back to such a nice place to rest after spending all day exploring Seattle."
3441402,25935354,2015-01-30,25964786,Kevin,Jessica was easy to work and communicated well.  The cabin was neat and private and perfect for our needs.
3441402,26014324,2015-02-01,23398813,Daniel,"My third stay in the cabin and this experience, like the rest has been great! Wonderful location, close to everything and spacious and warm. The shower is hot and the kitchen is fully equipped. "
3441402,26079256,2015-02-02,23398813,Daniel,"Because I booked two nights in a row a couple of days apart, I'll leave a second review. Still awesome! :-)"
3441402,26325250,2015-02-09,2866841,Dan,"Exactly as advertised. Clean, quiet and enjoyable. And when I needed to check out an hour late due to a mistake on my part, Jessica was very understanding. A great option and one I would recommend if you are looking to stay in the North Seattle area. "
3441402,26403260,2015-02-11,8219665,Andy,Everything was great! Jessica is an especially responsive hostess.
3441402,26698960,2015-02-17,2180945,Rosalba,"Jessica's cozy cabin was a perfect home away from home for myself, my husband and 2 year old daughter. It was very clean and tidy and located in a quiet residential neighborhood surrounded by beautiful trees. There is a also a creek that runs along the back of the cabin which adds to the northwestern ambience. Jessica provided all the amenities necessary for a comfortable stay including plenty of clean bath towels, complimentary toiletries and fruit, items necessary to prepare and serve meals, and very clear notes about the cabin. We rented a car so didn't use public transportation during our stay. We were able to get to Pike's Place, the aquarium and other spots within 30 min. We were only 1 minute away from relatives and this made the location ideal for us. There are also a couple of grocery stores close by which was very helpful. Overall, we were very happy with our stay at Jessica's and would definitely return."
3441402,27040221,2015-02-23,7253162,Birsen,"Great private and cozy cabin ...very spacious, orderly and clean. Good towels in the bathroom, a suffienct TV, Internet, cozy heating system, and even a couple of snacks on the counter.
It was in a safe neighborhood, but very close to many restaurants and the dance studio I had my ballroom dance at. 
The host was friendly and efficient and easy to deal with. I would definitely recommend this place."
3441402,27855308,2015-03-13,17942399,Sam,Jessica's place was fantastic! Exactly as advertised: clean with plenty of space. Jessica is also a fantastic host. She is easy to communicate with and the entire stay is very straightforward. I would definitely stay here again!
3441402,28299855,2015-03-22,25243330,Lesley,"Jessica made me feel very welcome.
She has a lovely warm smile.
Her written communication was very detailed. She responded very promptly to all my questions."
3441402,28722966,2015-03-29,22864993,David,"This was my wife and I's first AirBnb stay.  Jessica was quick to respond to all of our questions.  She was flexible with our very late check-in time and allowed us an extended check-out as well. The cozy cabin was just as described, very quaint and cozy.  We've decided there's no point to stay at another hotel ever again!!"
3441402,28954260,2015-04-01,21684289,Margaret,"We arrived at the Private Cozy Cabin and and were very happy with the privacy, quiet, and large amount of space. Getting in was a breeze with their instructions. We just wished we had been able to stay longer and cook ourselves a few meals. Great place! "
3441402,29610915,2015-04-10,28303488,Maria,"I was in need of a quiet ""retreat"" while undergoing some medical testing in the area.  It was nice to have Jessica greet me on arrival.  The cabin is a cozy space in a backyard of a neighborhood in North Seattle. Lots of nearby amenities, and minutes from all Seattle attractions.  The cabin is fully stocked and I was able to be secluded for 4 nights.  Great for contemplation, arting and writing!  "
3441402,30525733,2015-04-23,24116286,Eneri,"Jessica was great!  She was communicative leading up to my booking,  left instructions for me that were thorough and the place was beautiful.  It was true to the listing, was quiet and cozy.  I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend this to anyone traveling to Seattle.  "
3441402,30824309,2015-04-27,12553729,Bonnie,"Very nice stay in a very quiet place.  It was so lovely.  I really enjoyed this home-away-from-home.  Jessica was wonderful.  The photos don't do this place justice, as it is much larger than it appears in the photos.  I would love to come back!"
3441402,31056818,2015-05-01,2866841,Dan,"Another great visit, my second time here. Clean, affordable, good location- exactly what I needed."
3441402,31664403,2015-05-08,22031688,Stephen,"Beautiful and spacious private cabin that will make you forget there are other houses around. It's very comfortable and clean. Jessica was great and goes the extra mile to provide amenities for her guests. We even locked ourselves out as we were loading the car to leave and I messages Jessica in a panic, and within 10 minutes she was home from work or whatever she was doing to help us out. Really great stay, great night of sleep, and always nice to have a parking spot too. "
3441402,32012118,2015-05-12,32800485,David,"We had a very pleasant stay at Jessica's private and cosy cabin, it had everything we needed for our stay and the rooms were very neat and clean upon checkin. I would stay here again for sure! "
3441402,32294751,2015-05-16,17942399,Sam,This is the second time I've stayed at Jessica's place. Wonderful host and great space! I'd highly recommend staying here.
3441402,32548450,2015-05-19,4075970,Alicia,"Jessica met us upon our arrival to explain the particular features of the cabin. It's roomy, comfortable,and private and  well located for quick cross town travel. We are a retired professional couple from Eugene, and were in Seattle for Tango classes located across town. We never had any lengthy traffic delays as her location is easily accessible, in a comfortable 1950's ish neighborhood. . The cabin itself is cute, with a lots of kitchen counter space and all the appliances you'd need. The refrigerator is full sized, and there's a four burner gas stove. No dishwasher, but plenty of plates , bowls and cups. Everything looked clean. The bathroom has ample room, good lighting and an exhaust fan. Lots of towels and extra toiletries in the drawers. There's two good sized closets,  and lots of extra space for your suitcases, ice chests, etc. There is a long computer desk with a few desk supplies, exec style chair, and ample lighting.  Good wifi connection. I was most impressed with the bed, as I'm a light sleeper and don't like worn mattresses. This bed is great!! I found the extra blankets and pillows and slept extremely well, thank you Jessica! The cabin has many windows, all with working blinds and safety track bars. The locks on the windows are newish and operable. There was no mold or mildew or musty smell anywhere.  The heater is adequate for the cabin's size.  The bedroom has wall to wall carpet and there's ample floor space for yoga or floor exercises. I'd definitely recommend Jessica's,  and we hope to use it again ourselves. 
"
3441402,33250408,2015-05-26,13548310,Mariko,"Jessica's place was beautiful, serene, and private! We could hear the creek at night (so soothing), and the neighborhood was a wonderful blend of Seattle green with easy access to major roads and freeways."
3441402,33547490,2015-05-29,31972525,Katja,Jessica was extremely welcoming and her cabin was awesome! It is very private and cozy and I would definitely love to stay here again whenever I visit Seattle. It was very clean and had all the basic amenities you can ask for. Also has some cool board games!
3441402,33866503,2015-06-01,29055256,Lauren,Jessica's little cabin was perfect for our weekend away. It was quaint a great place to return to after a day in the city. I would definitely stay there again if we're ever in the city. It was a nice private place to come back to. We arrived late and it wasn't an issue. Jessica left a key for us and we were able to come and go as we pleased. 
3441402,35212667,2015-06-16,30131760,Megan,My parents had a fantastic experience staying here. Everything was clean and nicely prepared for their arrival. It's a very spacious place and the host is incredibly friendly and accommodating. 
3441402,36283987,2015-06-27,3287150,Saeed,"This was my second stay at Jessica's cottage, and it was wonderful! :)
The cottage is extremely clean, beautiful, large and fully equipped. You have all amenities you might need, even iron and fan. It is surrounded by lots and lots of trees and blossoms, and you have also access to a tiny patio. Jessica was very kind and communicative and checked in with me several times to make sure I am comfortable.
I'd love staying at her cottage again :)"
3441402,36492439,2015-06-28,34394926,Jane,"Great little cabin just outside of downtown Seattle. Jessica was super friendly even though she was sick, and the place was great - clean, comfortable, private, and a great deal! Can even hear the creek in back a bit; would expect nothing less of Lothlorien! Would definitely stay again!! "
3441402,36903033,2015-07-02,16779710,Christina,"My dad was in town and needed a private, quiet place to stay. We found the right place with this private cabin. It has nearly everything you need regarding kitchen and bath items, and having grocery stores right down the street is really convenient. The cabin is restful and soothing. The only drawback is that it was challenging to cool the space down during our unseasonably hot weather. 

Jessica is incredibly responsive and very helpful. A perfect host. I would recommend her spot to anyone! "
3441402,37550128,2015-07-08,859379,Becky,"    From the start, Jessica made it very easy to communicate with her. She answered my messages within a day. She also was very helpful when I asked her specific things about Seattle...where to eat, how to get around, best place to watch fireworks, etc. Jessica respected our privacy, but checked in via email to see if there was anything we needed. 
    My husband and I stayed in the cabin for about a week and loved it. It was very clean, and had all the essentials you need. A great kitchen with most of the things you need to cook with, a nice bathroom with towels soap, shampoo, hair dryer, etc., wifi, a comfy bed, and fans to keep the cabin cool.  The cabin is located in a quiet neighborhood, and in what seemed to be a safe area. It only took us about 15 minutes (without traffic) to head into downtown Seattle. We loved our experience with the cabin and would definitely stay here again then next time we come to Seattle. "
3441402,37895149,2015-07-11,20824539,Brian,"Jessica showed my wife and I the cabin upon arrival and shared its history with us.  We found the listing to be as described and the cabin is located in a very quiet neighborhood.  

Jessica has information available on the Seattle area in the cabin and its location is within walking distance of the bus route for easy transportation to downtown Seattle if you don't want to drive.  Also in walking distance are grocery stores, restaurants and other amenities just remember that there are hills in the Seattle area.  Lake Washington has a very nice walking/jogging/biking trail about a mile from the cabin if you're looking for some exercise.

The cabin worked very well for us because we were visiting family who live in the general area.  All in all I would say that the cabin is well worth the price, more comfortable than a hotel room and it is located in a great area.  We would definitely stay here again if Jessica would be willing to have us. 

I have to give a special shout-out for the sheets Jessica has on the bed.  OMG they were awesome!   :)  

Thanks for sharing your place with us Jessica!!"
3441402,38005073,2015-07-12,13896171,David,"She was able to meet us when we got there and provide a tour of the house and where to park, there area is nice, and the property was set back so it was nice and quiet."
3441402,39085900,2015-07-20,1030348,Emily,"We had a wonderful stay! It was exactly what we were looking for. Larger than you'd expect, clean, comfortable, and convenient. "
3441402,39692847,2015-07-25,17971383,Chelda,Staying at Jessica's cabin was a relaxing experience. The place was clean and felt homey. she was very accommodating and made sure we had everything we needed. She also let us know what to do if we had questions or needs. 
3441402,39969563,2015-07-27,16582098,Patrick,The cozy cabin was exactly as described.The neighborhood was quiet and we had a nice sound sleep! The cabin was easy to find and communicating with Jessica was simple. 
3441402,40380424,2015-07-30,38876252,Brenda,"Perfect for me.  The listing was very accurate and the cabin is private and comfortable.  I was traveling on my own for business and felt very safe and secure. I really appreciated the privacy and the work space.

The cabin is perfectly appointed and truly a great value for the location. Most importantly, I slept!  It was quiet and the bed- super comfy. 

Jessica was patient with me as I hadn't seen the instructions on how to access the cabin until I had already bothered her to duplicate what she'd so perfectly put into writing.  Thank you! 

I travel to Seattle frequently and will check Jessica's listing for availability before anything else!  

Loved it."
3441402,40640096,2015-08-01,19642876,Lisa,Great space! Very comfortable and convenient. Highly recommended!
3441402,41350415,2015-08-07,34038830,David,"Our first experience with Airbnb and we were very happy with it. Jessica was prompt in her reply and helpful. Cabin looks exactly like in the pictures. Space was great, kitchen was full-size with all the necessary utensils and gadgets. Location was great but quiet. Would definitely recommend the place!"
3441402,42253507,2015-08-12,31105365,Andrea,"Jessica was very prompt with communication which was nice since this was my first time utilizing Airbnb and I wasn't sure what to expect. The cabin was actually larger than we had anticipated and the full-sized kitchen was great! We were able to purchase food from a local grocery store (there are several close by) and save money by making meals onsite. The neighborhood was very quiet for being in a large city - we didn't hear any neighbors or traffic noise. The location was nice because it was close to restaurants/grocery stores and not a bad trip into Seattle, even during rush hour. Jessica was very accommodating and understanding when we had to check out a day early due to an unforeseen medical issue. We would definitely recommend the cabin for visitors to the Seattle area."
3441402,42582100,2015-08-14,17032594,Grace,"Staying at the cabin was really convenient. There was lots of room, and easy to find. We found Jessica very warm and friendly.

3441402,43283299,2015-08-18,26934958,Eileen,"We stayed in Jessica's cabin for one night on a recent visit to Seattle to visit our daughter. The location was perfect, both convenient and quiet. The cabin was actually bigger than we had envisioned and comfortably furnished with a comfortable bed. Jessica was a friendly and attentive host and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend her property.
The only (slight) drawback is that the wifi connection was very slow, so if that's very important to you, you should be aware of it."
3441402,43531285,2015-08-20,8759753,Grace,"We greatly enjoyed our stay here. There was so much peace and quiet within a very large city but very accessible to stores,  restaurants,  freeways,  etc.  From this location,  I recommend using Hwy 99 (Aurora St) to get to downtown Seattle."
3441402,43864860,2015-08-22,41489596,Amrit,"The place was great. It was cozy and clean. Jessica made sure everything was organized. Convenient location. Jessica was easy to get ahold of for any questions we had, but gave us plenty of privacy as well. "
3441402,44171413,2015-08-24,1785973,Baya,"The cabin is just like on the pictures. The place easy to find, 20 minutes driving from the center, located in a very nice quiet neighborhood. Jessica is very nice and friendly. Would love to stay at her place again:)"

3441402,46044820,2015-09-07,28186099,Brianna,"This cabin was as described- cozy, clean, and as others have said, felt more spacious than the square feet - plenty of room for a single person or couple traveling. Appreciated the inclusion of coffee/tea and oatmeal. The neighborhood was quiet and residential. Jessica was flexible with our arriving later in the evening after a wedding rehearsal dinner. We would definitely stay here again!"
3441402,46247099,2015-09-08,18094234,Abby,"Jessica's place is cute, cozy and exactly as depicted in the description. We didn't arrive until later and the cabin was unlocked and ready for us upon our arrival.  Jessica was easy to communicate with and made the check in and out process flawless.  I would definitely stay here again."
3441402,46359223,2015-09-09,1181586,Eli,"Jessica's cabin is an unbelievable deal and gem--it's hidden away and really feels like being in the woods when you open the sliding door to the porch.  It was clean and had everything we needed, an absolute steal.  And Jessica was immediately responsive to the rental request and to my questions and greeted us when we arrived.  The best Air BNB deal I've ever found.  Don't miss it. "
3441402,47155680,2015-09-16,26320113,Andrea,"Jessica's cabin was wonderful! The location was convenient even with public transportation, though it was still quiet and private. And as someone who loves nature, I thought the neighborhood was beautiful with all the evergreen trees and the little creek. The cabin itself was very comfortable and well prepared with all the conveniences of home! I never got to meet Jessica in person, but she was very friendly in all of our email communications :) Though I was only there for a week, I could have happily stayed longer and hope to stay there again the next time I'm in Seattle!"
3441402,47577339,2015-09-20,14895756,Laura,"Jessica was very flexible and easy to communicate with -- she was willing to work with my late arrival. Cabin was as described, just perfect for what I needed, a quiet spot to get some studying done and restful sleep. Would definitely return. "

The cabin was clean and spacious and very quiet: the perfect weekend getaway spot. Great water pressure in the shower and plenty of lamps. The cabin is within walking distance of Lake City main street, easy to get around without a car."
3441402,50098823,2015-10-09,42943643,Jeanine,"I loved staying at Jessica's! Her cabin was clean, well-appointed and was the perfect home base for our Seattle adventures. A little out of the way but once we figured out the bus system it was absolutely no problem. Jessica was a great hostess, she was very nice even when we accidentally locked ourselves out! 10/10 would stay again"
3441402,50592224,2015-10-12,21179469,Kendra,"I enjoyed Jessica's cabin for a lot of reasons: it was in a nice residential area so my stay was peaceful and quiet; it was close to Lake City Parkway, which has a great variety of shops and restaurants only a few minutes away; the cabin as spacious and felt like home. Jessica was easy to work with and very communicative. Thank you, Jessica!"
3441402,51529001,2015-10-21,25243330,Lesley,"This was the second time I stayed. The neighborhood is very pretty and is close to shops, buses, etc"
3441402,51857453,2015-10-24,46953005,Heather,"Jessica's cottage was the perfect place to stay on our overnight in Seattle!
Everything was clean and comfortable with nice shampoo and soaps in the bathroom. 
The neighborhood was quiet, so it was easy to relax. 
The cottage is a little confusing to find, but Jessica gave great directions and was helpful in every way from our first email exchange. 
I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, and will happily recommend it to friends. "
3441402,52782421,2015-11-01,9839419,Isaac,"We were very comfortable at Jessica's cabin with our young child.  There was plenty of space and privacy, and we got to know the outskirts of Seattle a bit more. The location is a far out,  but it doesn't take long at all to get downtown.  Maybe 10 minutes.  The cabin has a kitchen with most things you would need, so if you want to save money on eating out this is a good place. "
3441402,53713062,2015-11-11,16819329,Joanna,"Amy was there to meet us right when we arrived to show us around the property.  The cabin had everything we needed.  We were able to cook a few meals in the kitchen.  We loved the location.  You can hear the stream behind the cabin and even though we were still in the city it felt like we were in the middle of a forest!  We also loved how close it is to downtown.  It was about a 10-15 min drive to Pike Place Market.  Thanks Amy, we really enjoyed our stay!"
3441402,53860036,2015-11-13,3105814,Doug,It was great of Jessica to knock on the door after we arrived to say hi. It made us feel so comfortable and welcome. Her cabin is so cute and feels incredibly spacious the way it is laid out. It had everything we needed - and more. Thanks Jessica! I will certainly be happy to stay again in the future.
3441402,54212252,2015-11-16,32977676,Jessica,"My two study abroad friends and I reunited in Seattle, and this place was perfect for us! It was clean and had everything we needed. We cooked dinner in and enjoyed quality time together. Jessica was very accommodating. She provided prompt responses to my inquiries and was flexible with our changing schedule. Highly recommend! "
3441402,54902550,2015-11-25,47895214,Debra,"Jessica is a wonderful host, as soon as we arrived she showed us around and explained how everything works, and let us know that if we needed anything to let her know. The cabin was larger than we expected and clean. It was perfect for us where we like to prepare our own meals, the kitchen was fabulous, she provided coffee and tea and a few things for breakfast as well. It was so quiet! which is such a treat in Seattle. I would definitely come back again if we have the opportunity. Thanks Jessica for you hospitality, we appreciate it. "
3441402,55074795,2015-11-27,25654300,Hamdi,It was excellent and I enjoyed every minute of it 
3441402,55260058,2015-11-29,48724938,Aminah,"City –Country Living  At Its Best !  

My stay at Jessica’s cabin was wonderful.  This spacious cabin was very cozy with a homey feel--very clean and neat. The space is ideal for one to two adults, okay maybe with a toddler. I loved the décor which is a mix of modern and vintage. I especially loved the kitchen and dining area, which had ample space for cooking, dining, and just sitting. The bed was comfortable too!  

Surprisingly, there is a nice closed-in deck off the bedroom surrounded by trees.  I would have never dreamed of finding a guest cabin within the heart of northeast Seattle. I enjoyed my stay immensely as I was able to write and enjoy the serene setting.  

Despite being in the middle of her Thanksgiving dinner, Jessica was incredibly patient as she helped me to navigate to her property.

After  staying here I don’t want to stay in a hotel again!  "
3441402,55309118,2015-11-29,2559473,Alex,The place is in a residential area where is quiet and safe.  Jessica was very accommodating to let us check in earlier which went smoothly.  The heater kept the place cozy and the  kitchen had everything we needed.  Jessica was very communicative.  I highly recommend her place. 
3441402,55933109,2015-12-07,28500504,Lauren,"This was such a terrific find! Jessica gave excellent directions, and she even had the space ready for us early to accommodate our travel schedule. There were lots of clean towels, a cozy fire in the heater/stove, and even snacks there to greet us!"
3441402,56525106,2015-12-14,23398813,Daniel,A wonderful place to stay. Outside the city enough to be cozy and private yet close enough to the city for seeing the sights. 
3441402,57102398,2015-12-21,45378537,Misha,"Jessica made me feel at home.  The description of the cabin matched the actually cabin.  The neighborhood was beautiful, right next to a tiny stream, and coffee and restaurants were close by."

4521755,30557840,2015-04-24,29381844,Teri,Wonderful first experience with this service. The apartment was perfect for my family for our week in Seattle for spring vacation. Comfortable bed and easy to use pull out couch fit the four of us well. The porch view of the city made the setting. Even the neighbors introduced themselves and made us feel welcome. Convenient to all locations and easy on and off the highway. Would stay again and will recommend to friends.
4521755,30714016,2015-04-26,26268878,Jenna,"Samantha was a great host- very communicative and helpful!  The place is great- we had four adults and a baby and we were very comfortable.  There were ample blankets, towels, and all the amenities you could need- plus games and toys for our little one! The neighborhood is very terrific- there are great restaurants (and a nice beer garden) within walking distance.  Would definitely recommend staying here if you are in the area! "
4521755,32342310,2015-05-17,29993101,Ella,"Really fantastic apartment. Every amenity that we needed, a beautiful neighborhood, and communicative (but not overly so) hosts. Sitting on the porch in the morning was lovely. 

A few small drawbacks: the hosts asks that guests be quiet between certain hours because they live below, which is very understandable, but it did make us feel like we had to walk on eggshells a little (we wake up very early). Also, the cleaning fee was substantial, but the hosts asked that we load and run the dishwasher, strip the beds and start the washer, and take out the trash and recycling before we leave. Not huge tasks, but when we're trying to pack up and get out the door before the 10am check-out, it made things a little hectic. Overall we'd definitely recommend the apartment, but with those little caveats."
4521755,34536823,2015-06-09,31402200,Jennifer,"My kids and I stayed at Samantha's B&B for 9 days while we were selling our house in the same neighborhood.  She was an excellent hostess.  She was available if needed, but stayed out of our way.  The suite is as described and has a lot of amenities including an air conditioner for hot days and a Roku box.  We very much enjoyed the balcony and the view of Seattle skyline and the close proximity to good restaurants and SLU. I would definitely stay here again on return trips to Seattle."
4521755,35906331,2015-06-23,22872094,Kk,"The Wallingford Terrace Sky is a great place for a family vacation. The house is extremely clean, fully equipped, and in a very great neighborhood. My family was in town for my graduation and we stayed there for 2 whole weeks. There wasn't a single thing that we could point out to be a negative. We enjoyed every minute and would definitely go back."
4521755,41323152,2015-08-07,2780777,Naama,"Lovely apartment, great location, friendly accessible hosts. I hope we'll be able to stay here again!"
4521755,43311592,2015-08-18,9243047,Hannes,"Samantha's apartment is beautiful, clean, and in a great location. I hope to stay here again when I visit Seattle. Especially we enjoyed the balcony with its breathtaking view. I can highly recommend this place."
4521755,46597129,2015-09-12,2483856,Scott,Lovely apartment in a delightful neighborhood. Perfect for the two of us plus toddler. We were warmly welcomed and hosted. Thank you Samantha!
4521755,47285987,2015-09-17,42411487,Heather,"Really enjoyed my stay at this apartment. It's close to Wallingford, Fremont, Greenlake, and the U District, so I was able to get everywhere I needed to be quickly and efficiently. I was only there 2 nights and didn't use the kitchen or living room, but appreciated that they were well appointed. Thanks Samantha! "
4521755,49481108,2015-10-04,43296084,Cate,We had a great time at Wallingford Terrace. The apartment was stocked well and comfortable for 4 guests. Great location--within walking distance to many fun places to visit and a short drive to others. Lovely view to gaze at while having coffee and tea on the balcony.
4521755,52934358,2015-11-02,21913371,Chris,"Great place and very lovely friendly hosts! All the little extras were provided including basics in the fridge, towels, spare blankets & sheets, bathroom products etc etc. This was a perfect place for my needs super close to shops, yoga, bars, restaurants etc etc. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. "
4521755,53352114,2015-11-08,16749991,Stephen,Comfortable and clean apartment in a great location.  Samantha welcomed us at checkin and was gone for the weekend but easily reached (we had a question and she got back to us in minutes.)  Great view of downtown Seattle.
3242247,14376181,2014-06-17,7884110,Jonathan,"Tania was able to accommodate our late arrival and was a great host. What sold the place for me was the hardwood floors, as I can't really stand carpet. The bed was very comfortable and the whole place was stocked with quality Trader Joe's products. I would definitely come back here during my next visit and would recommend Tania's guest suite to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Seattle."
3242247,15061188,2014-07-01,10701540,Ann Bruce,"WOOO HOOOO!!!!  This one is a good one!  Tania's space is excellent for being in Seattle without being in a city environment. Perfect for my comfort. 
She provides some groceries in the fridge and anything you request she looks into providing it. 
Very helpful in all regards. I loved the place and the setting it was in. And there's parking!!!!!!  Something Seattle is very short of!!!"
3242247,15417798,2014-07-08,10838771,Tim,"Tania was an excellent host.  The apartment was exactly as described. She was great at communicating with us before and during our stay.  The apartment was very clean, in a quiet neighborhood, with its own parking spot, which was exactly what we were looking for.  It was a lovely little apartment, and we would happily stay here again."
3242247,15703929,2014-07-14,17032621,Becky,"Our visit at Tania's suite was a pleasant one.  She was flexible with our check in time as our travel plans were delayed due to a cancelled flight.  Upon arrival the suite was clean, prepped for us, and had a stocked fridge.    You enter the suite via a shared entryway, but the suite is still very private.  Tania was easy to get in touch with before and during our stay.  We would stay here again. "
3242247,15934152,2014-07-18,12267664,Lauren,"Tania was a great host, and her parents are lovely people. The location was ideal for Chris's Seattle stay, and he enjoyed swimming at Mathew's beach after a long run."
3242247,16261004,2014-07-24,17120578,Lou,"I can't say enough good things about Tania and the apartment she offers. It was super clean, stocked with useful food for weary travelers, quiet, located right near a bus stop, and near a cool bike trail and fabulous beach. In addition, Tania was always, as she said ""a text away."" She took care of everything for us. She was kind and a great resource. The yard was neat too, full of sweet flowers and organic raised bed gardens. And her little boy is a gentle soul whom we fell in love with. I would recommend this apartment to anyone and stay there again in a heartbeat."
3242247,16505614,2014-07-28,18097088,Alaine,"Our stay with Tania was even better than expected. The pictures posted don't do the suite justice: the house and yard were very nice, the suite was clean and well stocked with plenty of soft towels and blankets, there were lots of different snacks available, and the bathroom was beautiful. Tania was very nice--she had a great natural balance between being friendly and respecting our privacy--and was quite accommodating. "
3242247,17063950,2014-08-06,18195031,Rhonda,"LOVED our stay here! The guest suite was wonderful: neat, clean, well-stocked, spacious enough for the 3 of us. Tania was a wonderful, responsive hostess: graciously helped us with what we needed and gave us plenty of privacy. Perfect location for us: close to the city without being in the city. Would most definitely come back!"
3242247,17493536,2014-08-12,19145471,Matthew,Tania was a great host. Had everything we needed and then some. We even had toast and milk!! She went above and beyond for us. Location was great and quiet. We would return with out question!!
3242247,17529438,2014-08-13,18776111,Jeffrey,"The discription was pretty accurate. The bathroom was new and large. There was no TV, and it seems like the daily cleaning fee was $50 which was twice of any other airbnb we stayed. Our real problem was the weather. It was in the mid 90's outside and inside with only window fans to blow hot air around. We could not stay in a room which had a thermometer at 96*. Tania was gracious and we received a full refund. Apparently that kind of hot weather in Seattle is very rare."
3242247,17799246,2014-08-17,4657354,Frederike,"Tania war sehr nett und hat sogar den Kühlschrank befüllt, der Ablauf war problemlos, die Wohnung superschön und sehr sauber. Wir habenuns sehr wohl gefühlt!"
3242247,18115285,2014-08-22,12761532,Jean Michel,"Très bonne prestation, très propre, très agréable.
La chambre, la pièce à vivre et la salle de bains spacieuse sont très bien. 
L'accueil est très sympathique avec dans l'appartement plein de petites attentions. 
Il manquait un sèche-cheveu par exemple que Tania a tout de suite acheté. 
A recommander. 
Un grand merci à Tania pour sa gentillesse."
3242247,18341094,2014-08-25,19210292,Kyounglee,"We did not get to meet Tania in person but she was very helpful and responsive. The suite had a spacious bathroom, clean sheets, and a well-stocked fridge.  It felt good to relax in the tub after a long day. The dog barked at me a bit but she was harmless and I only saw her once in the yard. Overall, the lovely suite and its tons of amenities made us feel like we were in our own private resort. "
3242247,18887347,2014-09-02,18285835,Justin,"Tania was very accommodating throughout our stay. The pictures and descriptions she provides accurately depict the guest suite. The house is located in a beautiful, safe neighborhood, and just a quick ten minute drive away from downtown. Tania provides an assortment of breakfast/snack foods which helped to save us money and get our day started on the right foot. I would stay at Tania's guest suit again and would certainly recommend it to a friend!"
3242247,19241542,2014-09-08,9524197,Kevin,"What a charming place! The upstairs apartment is quite spacious yet cozy, and exceeded our expectations. Tania provided not only the basics (e.g. toiletries and eating utensils), but also offered extras (like milk and fruit). She was very flexible with our arrival and departure, and welcomed us warmly. After that, we hardly saw her, but she was available as needed, and responded quickly to texts. 

The location worked very well for us, being near the trail and parks, in a residential neighborhood with lots of mature trees. With a car, it's pretty quick to get to shopping, restaurants, or the freeway. It's out of the bustle, but not too far.
"
3242247,19749280,2014-09-17,20626140,Chris,"Tania was an exceptional host! Her check-in e-mail was incredibly detailed and informative, which helped answer all of our questions about the property before we even arrived. Upon arrival Tania gave us a quick tour of the space and showed us all of the complimentary amenities - soaps and shampoos, a pantry and fridge full of groceries (coffee, tea, bagels, yogurt, etc), maps and print-outs for activities, and even mints on the pillow! There is a private entrance and a very secure entry-system that was impressively futuristic yet completely user friendly. There's even a designated parking spot! Then, of course, the space itself. It was charming and exactly as much space as you need to feel completely comfortable. There are fans in case it gets hot, a large closet, plenty of accessories in the kitchen, and a very large bathroom. The only detail that could be troublesome is that the shower has a low ceiling due to the shape of the roof overhead. I'm 5'9"" and it wasn't a problem for me, but I imagine if you're over 6'0"" you might feel a little claustrophobic. Bed was large and comfortable and everything was perfect! My girlfriend and I kinda wish we could just move in!"
3242247,19967148,2014-09-21,12957534,Justin,"This is a beautiful and peaceful place to stay. Tania is such a kind host and had great recommendations for those new to the area. We were impressed with how Tania has utilized the available space and is thoughtful by providing extra touches.  The home is located very conveniently for quick transport to UW, Matthews Beach is right down the street, and the i5 is not far.  We enjoyed our stay and if you like appreciate clean, quiet and a good location you will as well."
3242247,20070305,2014-09-22,21374179,Alex,"Tania is a warm and accommodating hostess and the suite is a nice, quiet retreat. I stayed during one of the last warm nights of the season and expected it to be warm as this is the top floor of the house, but the window fans did their job well and kept the place cool. I used the lavender salts to have relaxing soak in the new tub, and slept very well on the comfy bed. The wifi is fast and was able to livestream a movie with no issues. When I woke up I helped myself to breakfast from the mini fridge (fruit, yogurt and cereal) and left feeling rested and refreshed. Will definitely keep her in mind in the future and recommend her to friends."
3242247,20664117,2014-10-03,1182326,Anna,"Tania has done a wonderful job. Her accommodation is clean, spacious and light and airy. She was easy to contact, clear on important details like access and timing and very welcoming. We did not actually meet Tania, but can fully recommend her place to anyone who wants to visit that part of Seattle."
3242247,22639142,2014-11-10,22726946,Sophie,"Beautiful, private and clean space! Tania was very helpful on arrival and provided us with lots of useful information. Really enjoyed our stay and would recommend highly. "
3242247,25397399,2015-01-14,10329995,Justin,The suite was even better than described. Tania was the perfect hostess and even welcomed us into the place with a bag of food! She also set up a crib for our baby so that we didn't have to bring one. We loved our stay and would certainly love to come back the next time we are in Seattle!
3242247,32232877,2015-05-16,25548344,Jill,"Tania made me feel very welcome here. I actually stayed for a full two months! Was looking for a quiet, restful place to relax while in-between places and that's exactly what I found. While I was completely sold on choosing the place for the beautiful bath tub and bathroom alone, the bed was extremely comfortable and the whole suite very cozy. I have a bad back so a comfortable bed is really important to me. The neighborhood was also very sweet, beautiful and close enough to downtown Ballard where I worked and played,...but far enough from the hustle and bustle to feel like I was escaping (I had a car rental but the bus stop is just around the corner). I found all the kitchen appliances more than adequate for my boyfriend and I to make the meals we wanted to with both a QFC and Safeway grocery store very close by. Again, I found Tania very accommodating and helpful. Always quick to respond and available for any questions I had. And though I was there for two months and often not working, we actually didn't see each other as much as I would have liked too. I was actually a little sad to leave here. I felt very at home :) thanks for everything Tania!"
3242247,35421816,2015-06-18,28422610,Morgan,"Had a wonderful stay. Tania was a great host and her home is beautiful. She was very easy to reach for anything you may need. She makes you feel right at home. Charming neighborhood, not too far from downtown Seattle sights. The apartment is exactly as described and pictured. "
3242247,38565461,2015-07-16,34425096,Alexandre,"We had a wonderful time in Seattle. Tanja was a brilliant host, the room was very clean and beautiful. Thank you very much!"
3242247,40730193,2015-08-02,14014621,Kate,"My solo 3-night stay at Tania's suite was lovely. The apartment was very clean and efficient for a smaller space. The bathroom is large and luxurious, and the bedroom was cozy for great sleep (and air conditioning was much appreciated during the 90F+ heat wave). Though there isn't a stove/oven, Tania provides all the appliances you need to whip up meals, make tea/coffee, etc. The information sheet she provides is very clear and helpful, as are the shortcut walking directions to quaint Matthew's Beach. The surrounding neighborhood is great for walking, and the suite is a short drive/bike to busier neighborhoods. While I didn't meet Tania in person, I did briefly chat with her mom, brother (and dog), who all seemed very nice and welcoming. Would recommend staying here!"
3242247,46901539,2015-09-14,40078512,Priya,Tania's guest suite was the perfect place for me and my husband to stay on our recent visit to Seattle!  Charming and close to beautiful Matthew's Beach. 
4257097,43922897,2015-08-23,5796642,Dana,Beautiful luxury apartment. Very comfortable and parking in the building is excellent.
4257097,50519183,2015-10-12,43802152,Chloe,"The apartment was amazing! The pictures do not do it justice. It is very rustic in decor and very clean. It is pretty much located where you want to be if you are visiting Seattle for the first time, like my friends and I were. It is a short walk to Pike Place Market and a short walk to the Space Needle. A whole foods is super close if you need some groceries. The pull out couch is very comfortable once I figured out it was a blow up lol. I would defiantly stay here again next time i decided to come back! Thank you for a great stay :) "
7604621,49554852,2015-10-04,34449930,Kate,"I loved staying at Will's place. Im having our house renovated so taking a break from the mess to stay at an airbnb meant I nearly cried at how clean and comfortable this place is. While the unit is small, everything about the set up was very thoughtful and had everything we needed. This place is also super convenient being a few blocks from all the shops and great Ballard restaurants. "
7604621,51057472,2015-10-17,25648763,Brent,"Fantastic quiet bedroom! Akin to a hotel, except on a residential side street. Quick and easy walk to neighborhood amenities like the grocery store and bus. The room is really well kept and comfortable."
7604621,51833010,2015-10-24,878914,Kendall,"Will's studio was perfect!  The location is great, near restaurants and bakeries in Ballard and certainly within walking distance to just about anything in the neighborhood.  The bed in the unit is comfortable, the space is immaculately maintained, it is really a perfect and very private hideaway in this very desirable neighborhood."
7604621,51979240,2015-10-25,4680890,Eli,"Nice, clean space in a great Ballard location."
7604621,52746503,2015-11-01,369939,Jonah,"Nice place in a convenient location -- short walk to the various shops and restaurants of Ballard. Clean. Comfortable bed, tasteful decor. Nice shower, good closet space. As pictures indicate, room is very small and doesn't get very good light; the block isn't particularly charming. Street parking was very easy. Our hosts kindly left water, yogurts, and a nice selection of teas, and they were easy to communicate with."
7604621,53533603,2015-11-09,18930214,Taylor,Staying at Will's place was wonderful. The location can't be beat and the studio was perfect for two people. We spent most of our time wandering around the city and saved the studio for primarily sleeping. We'd definitely stay again!
7604621,53988352,2015-11-15,17131995,Cathy,"Perfect little space, exactly where I needed to be. Comfortable, warm, clean, and the complimentary beverages and popcorn got me through a tough evening, when I was too busy to acquire dinner! Thank you, Will, and congratulations on an excellent accommodation. "
7604621,54734007,2015-11-23,17337406,Andrew,"The place looks brand-new.  Nicely located near the heart of Ballard, with lots of restaurants to choose from.  Nice host, too.
Thank you for the nice weekend.  Highly recommended."
7604621,54988514,2015-11-27,7407325,Erik,Great location!
7604621,56371035,2015-12-13,5067772,Amanda,"My boyfriend and I LOVED Will's place. It's a small space but in a good way... very cozy. We were left cold drinks, coffee, tea and a couple snacks. It was perfectly decorated and so so clean. There is a large walk-in closet to store your things. We would absolutely stay here again. Thank you!"
7604621,57228888,2015-12-23,31846624,Keith,"I recently relocated to Seattle. Will's listing was the perfect location for me. I originally booked a longer stay, and during the whole process, Will was nothing but understanding and helpful during the brief times I heard from him. The listing was clean and spotless. Smelled almost like a hotel room...the good kind "
6168769,47599020,2015-09-20,10968987,Roman,"Annette's place is amazing and so is Annette. It is clean, cozy, spacious and conveniently located close to downtown and light rail that will get you there in few minutes. Annette picked us up at the rail station and even dropped us off downtown. Her place was stocked with all kinds of goodies and she even made us breakfast in the morning. I could go on and on about how great our stay was :) Annette and her place simply exceeded all our expectations and we highly recommend it!
"
6168769,48953203,2015-09-29,35585192,Candace,"This was my first time using airbnb. It was so perfect!!!! It was like being in my very own apartment. Annette is a perfect hostess.  She has so many beautiful and thoughtful little touches, gorgeous linens & towels, soaps & lotions, and a perfect assortment of snacking goodies. I have 3 more trips to Seattle over the next 7 months & hope I am able to stay with them each time❤️ Location was perfect for downtown as well .... 4 star rating in my book "
6168769,53085283,2015-11-04,2420044,Dianne,"The hosts made me feel so welcomed. Five-star comfort? I say six.  The teas and treats, milk and granola were especially appreciated. The quiet location is convenient, just three blocks from the light rail. Nothing better than seeing a city as its residents do: from the perch of their homes and the streets they stroll. "
6168769,53904379,2015-11-14,10557936,Elizabeth,"I really enjoyed my stay at Annette's home, however, I was greeted by her husband since she was slightly ill the day I arrived.  This home is in a great location on Beacon Hill very central to getting around the area. The room was very clean, well decorated, and large.  I loved having the extra sitting room to relax in after work.  The bed was very comfortable and I slept well.  The best part was my usual 1.5-2 hr commute was only 20 min!  I'll be back!"
5444457,28347443,2015-03-22,3454421,Sophie,"Celia could not have done more to make our stay easier. She met us in the middle of the day (came back from work especially) and showed us round her beautiful home. 
Easy parking, beautiful, spotlessly clean home. Extremely comfortable bed. Would definitely recommend."
5444457,28908211,2015-03-31,29743185,Amanda,"This was our first Airbnb experience and we really enjoyed staying with Celia & Steve! Their house is super cute and the bedroom and bathroom were spacious, clean, and comfortable! The neighborhood was quiet and there was plenty of street parking, but there were also several bars and restaurants within walking distance (or a short drive). We were able to grab lunch with the hosts upon arriving and got to know them a little bit. They were nice and friendly people, interested in getting to know us and giving us suggestions about places to eat/drink, but also happy to let us do our own thing. We'd definitely stay with them again!"
5444457,29358688,2015-04-06,15689597,Kris,Celia was a great host and was very flexible with our check in time when our plans changed a little from what we originally discussed. We would definitely stay here again. Great location as well. 
5444457,30432524,2015-04-21,20582081,Daniel,"Celia was a pleasant host and a great resource for restaurants and bars to visit during our stay. Her home is charming  and super clean with a spacious bedroom, bath and entertainment area downstairs for guests. We had a packed schedule for our trip so we did not get to chat with Celia and her husband very much, but we loved the quaint neighborhood and flexibility to come and go as needed. "
5444457,30996193,2015-04-30,9519362,Rob,"Celia and Steve are accommodating and friendly hosts who keep a welcoming, clean, and comfortable house. They made their home feel like our own during the week we stayed with them in Phinney Ridge -- a wonderful and safe location for those who enjoy a balance of city and quiet neighborhood. 

We took advantage of their proximity to Woodland Park and the zoo, both within easy walking distance. Freemont, Ballard, Greenlake, Wallingford, and U District are all within a 5 minute drive, and most other Seattle locations are easily accessible within 10-15 minutes. There was ample parking in the quiet street in front of their house. 

The bedroom was quiet and comfortable, and the tempurpedic bed provided us with excellent sleep. Although Celia and Steve wake up very early, they were very quiet and did not wake us. The private bathroom was also very clean."
5444457,31351577,2015-05-04,13478398,Cher,"We stayed in this wonderful home for three nights while visiting family nearby.  We enjoyed the very private and roomy downstairs accommodations, including the wonderfully comfortable bed.  The sparkling bath even had heated floors!  Highly recommended!"
5444457,35082782,2015-06-15,27841484,Haven,"This was our first experience with airbnb and it was wonderful!
Our hosts made us feel welcome, and were super understanding when our flight was delayed and we arrived much later than planned.
The location was super convenient, and the private bedroom and bathroom were comfortable, as described."
5444457,37863561,2015-07-11,34146251,Andy,"Our stay was perfect! We really felt at home here. It was comfortable, cool, and very clean. Celia and Steve were really friendly and went out of their way to improve our stay. This was our first time staying in a shared residence, but we felt like we had as much privacy as we wanted here. The house is located on top of a hill with a great view. We found it easy to get pretty much everywhere by bus and personally had no problem walking over to Ballard, Fremont, and beyond. We would definitely stay here again!"
5444457,39017320,2015-07-20,34362533,Kimberly,"The Dobbs were the perfects hosts!  Upon arrival, I was greeted with a warm welcome.  The space was just as described, and wonderfully cozy.  I had all the amenities necessary; and the home was located in a great neighborhood which provided easy access to all manner of restaurants, shops, wellness spas, and fun sites to explore!  I strongly recommend for anyone who wants to enjoy areas of Seattle by walking and seeing what the local vibe is like from the inside.   "
5444457,40109724,2015-07-28,30125576,Kimberly,"This was our first Airbnb experience and it was wonderful.  Even though we arrived late in the evening, our host was very welcoming and warm.  The home is lovely and the neighborhood is terrific!  Our room was in a basement but it did not feel like a basement room because the windows are just at ground level and quite large for basement windows, filled with light.  The shower is larger than normal-very nice!  The bed was divine.  It was also very quite down stairs.  We would absolutely stay here again!"
5444457,45387147,2015-09-02,8154770,Reinhart,"We had such a great stay with Celia, Steve and Phinney! Our arrival plans were pretty loose and Celia was really flexible and easy to get in touch with prior to our stay. We didn't spend much time at their home, but it was perfect and exactly what we were hoping for. There was plenty of parking, the neighborhood was accessible, walkable and safe. The house was really clean and exactly as pictured and both Celia and Steve were great to talk to and had excellent activity and restaurant suggestions. Phinney, their new puppy, is exceptionally cute and so well behaved!

We would happily stay here again and wholeheartedly suggest it! Thank you Celia and Steve!"
5444457,46167555,2015-09-08,24869696,Rosemary,"Great experience and very nice hosts. The accommodations were top notch, and a lot of care and attention was put into making the room comfortable and convenient. 
Thank you for having us! "

Great coffee and restaurants are a short walk. We slept well, had plenty of privacy, and would have taken the shower with us if we could. We would stay with Celia again in a heartbeat!"
5444457,49855318,2015-10-06,45449131,Deborah,"Celia and her hubby made us feel most welcome, and so did their adorable pup Phinney! The home was exactly as it was pictured and more comfortable than we'd imagine. Both were so hospitable and friendly, and we enjoyed their company very much. The location was perfect for us, and easy to get to. This was out first experience with AirBnB, and will not be the last thanks to Celia! We looked at other places in the vicinity, but so glad we choose this one - thank you, Celia!!!"
5444457,51292187,2015-10-19,28286057,Julia,"What a beautiful family and absolutely gorgeous house to stay at! It was already late in the evening when we came and Celia and her husband warmly welcomed us, showed around the house and gave us some ideas about the area. The house is very clean & comfortable. The guest bedroom is specious with a nice oversize walk-in shower. We were able to use the kitchen and I must say that their coffee is the best! Thank you Celia and Steve for letting us stay in your beautiful house and for the opportunity to meet you. "
3570691,18829923,2014-09-01,2074296,Simon,"Beautiful home, ideally located in Seattle on a quiet street but within walking distance of coffee shops, bars and a straight shot to downtown. Ekko is a thoughtful host - the place is spotless and there were muffins and fruit and cereals provided for breakfast- and fresh coffee beans with a grinder and brewer. Oh- and a Nintendo Wii U with Mario! "
3570691,19469361,2014-09-13,19351392,Silvia,Perfect Location and perfect stay in Seattle!!!!
3570691,19684848,2014-09-16,19434065,Jakob,"Everything was great, especially the welcome basket and the generosity of the host. It really felt like staying at a home away from home. "
3570691,19939371,2014-09-21,12514014,Lisa,"Ekko's home was perfectly spacious for our group of 8. It is exactly how it looks in pictures - very clean and comfortable. We didn't meet Ekko but he was quick in responding to all his emails and went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed. His front door is coded so there is no need to worry about carrying a key - very convenient! He warned us the garage space is small so a small sedan would've been perfect. Street parking is a bit tough to find in this area. Very very close to downtown area - we walked it - about 1.5 miles. As a plus, his fridge is stocked w/ drinks and snacks that you're welcome to. Loved our experience would definitely recommend it. "
3570691,20459807,2014-09-29,1723439,Alfonso,"Ekko was an amazing host. A couple a friends and I were trying to plan an affordable weekend getaway last minute to no avail. After so much looking around, I finally found Ekko's amazing townhouse. He was very accommodating to my last minute request and he readily communicated back and forth with me to give us a spectacular deal.

In terms of his amazing townhouse, we couldn't have asked for anything more. It had more than enough space for us to lounge around in and a kitchen big enough to actually do some real cooking in! There also is so much sleeping room including the living room couches, that a total of 7-8 people could comfortably enjoy their stay at this spot, especially with three bathrooms, two showers, and a jacuzzi bathtub. The location was also a big plus. It's only two blocks away from a park, three blocks away from a grocery store, and a 5-10 minute walk to the crazy night life of Capitol Hill. Last but not the least, the house door is opened with a code, which makes it easy for everyone to do their own thing, because no one has to worry about having to need a copy of the key.

Other than all this, I don't know what else to say. If you have 3 or more people, you should definitely stay here!
"
3570691,21513787,2014-10-19,1619312,Isabelle,"I stayed here over a weekend in October with 5 other people (3 couples total) and we all had an amazing time. We never got to meet Ekko but he was so responsive with all my emails and calls, and even came by a few days before to set up an airbed for the extra couple. His townhome is so gorgeous and immaculate, and reasonably priced too! Very comfortable with everything you need and more.

The location is fabulous, walkable to really great restaurants (which Ekko leaves recommendations for) and bars etc. We were all so pleased that we picked the best place in Seattle to stay. Thank you for your kind hospitality Ekko!"
3570691,21909361,2014-10-26,19412468,Danny,Ekko was a very gracious host! Left a lot of drinks and snacks for is which is great! We had plenty of room and the location was perfect for Capitol Hill use and a quick cab ride downtown.

3570691,25192260,2015-01-08,6352505,Darrin,"What a professional host! Ekko has really thought of every little thing to make his guests comfortable (batteries and scissors available in labeled drawers, drinks stocked for arrival, etc.), and we loved staying at his place so much that we extended our time there. The townhouse is in a fantastic central Cap Hill location, in the middle of everything but tucked away on a residential block and very quiet. Ekko is also a great communicator and responds to messages instantly. Just awesome!"
3570691,25519414,2015-01-18,25806869,Ben,"The house was located right near all of the fun neighborhood stuff in Capitol Hill, and is exactly as listed in the directory. It was clean, safe, and well-appointed. It was also really nice to have a parking spot and a guest parking pass in this neighborhood.

Ekko communicated really well the whole time, responding quickly to a few quick questions we had.  "

3570691,38428285,2015-07-15,4336748,Danny,"Ekko was a phenomenal host with A+ accommodations to back it up. What a fantastic townhouse. It was big and and bright and comfortable. I brought my parents on the trip and they absolutely loved their first Airbnb experience. The place is located at the pinnacle of Capitol Hill, right in the middle of a great bar scene, but nestled away on a quiet street. Also, Ekko was super easy to communicate with via e-mail. Responded promptly to all to my questions. I will definitely stay here again."
3570691,39032504,2015-07-20,35569562,Jacob,"The place in Capitol Hill was fantastic. The townhouse itself was very clean and well kept and the proximity to restaurants and bars was perfect.

3570691,41228447,2015-08-05,36971199,Steve,"I'm really glad we chose this place to stay.  It's in a very quiet area of the city of Seattle.  This 3-story house is very spacious, and wonderfully decorated.  Also, very clean.  We loved the huge kitchen, and really nice appliances as we cooked in a few times.  Very positive experience, and would suggest a stay here if you are visiting Seattle.
Steve"

3570691,45984573,2015-09-07,27673845,Mai-King,"Ekko was great from the beginning - very flexible and smart with the plan.  We had a different amount of people staying at the place each night for 3 nights and he handled it perfectly and even left us an air mattress for the night with the most people!  His place was wonderful - within walking distance of everything.  We were able to explore Seattle thoroughly and walk 5 minutes to the wedding we attended.  Beautiful condo, well kept.  He is also very quick to answer questions and reached out to see if we got in okay on our arrival date."
3570691,46745959,2015-09-13,22241332,Debbie,"I reserved this home for my daughter's wedding party for the weekend of 9/11/15.  The home was perfect, just as described!

I would highly recommend this property.  Debbie P.   "
3570691,48529680,2015-09-27,28821844,Tom,"Host was very easy to work with. Followed up after check-in to make sure we had everything we needed. Accommodations were new and clean. Location was fantastic. 

Not complaining -- but the living room photo isn't completely accurate. There's the futon and the windowsill bed (both of which are comfortable). But the extra couch you see in the photo is no longer there. In total: there are two double beds, a twin bed, a twin windowsill bed, and a double futon. 
"
3570691,49468709,2015-10-04,9816866,Heather,Ekko was a perfect host! So responsive and accommodating. Let us check in early and leave late. Check in was a breeze and the appt is in a perfect location. 5 stars all the way around!

8049470,45623022,2015-09-04,6189382,Nadia,"Kelly was a real godsend. My husband and flew in with a ton of luggage and two very stressed out cats. Kelly was so genuinely warm and helpful our entire stay, going out of her way to make sure we were comfortable. She gave us everything we needed (and probably many things we didn't even know we needed), just the right amount of privacy, and even helped check on the cats while we were out home-hunting. Heck, she even cleaned up when one of them got sick. I don't know what we would have done if we hadn't found her - my husband and I even thought of extending our stay just because we loved her hospitality and her beautiful home but we really did not want to cause her any more trouble since we had the cats with us. Kelly is an exceptional host and her future guests are very lucky indeed. "
8049470,46215387,2015-09-08,27966578,Harry,"Kelly was super nice and easy to get a long with. She had extra necessities like tooth brush and paste and razor and shaving cream if we needed but we had brought our own, but she had it there in case. Room that we were in was not huge but had the space we needed for what we needed it for. Bus is just right out the door and can get to downtown in 20 minutes but is easy to walk as well if you like walking. Overall had a great time and would stay there again if we go back to Seattle. Thanks Kelly."
8049470,46335971,2015-09-09,34125358,Anya,Kelly is an amazing host. She provided everything that one would ever need and more. Her place is super clean and very nicely decorated. Communication was super easy. Definitely recommended.

8049470,46962757,2015-09-14,42135802,Prashant Rao,Kelly is the best host in town. Everything was set and ready when we arrived. She also also helped us with list of places that we should visit while we were in Seattle. 
8049470,47532691,2015-09-20,32714377,Richard,"This was our first experience using Airbnb and Kelly was the perfect host. She had everything arranged; the room was very clean and comfortable; and all that we could ask for was provided. Kelly was also very helpful in not only giving us great recommendations for places to see, eat, get transport, etc. but also in very kindly giving us a ride to the Light Rail to head back to the airport. We would give Kelly the highest recommendation."
8049470,48104672,2015-09-23,41370933,James,A very comfortable stay at a great apartment. Kelly was a great host and provided everything we needed and the apartment was as described. If you are up to it you can walk to downtown in just under an hour. I would recommend anyone to stay here.
8049470,48255671,2015-09-24,44796296,Michael,Great stay! Room and apartment clean and orderly. Huge stress relief staying here as I had an important early AM appointment that I couldn't miss. Kelly was very gracious and considerate of my schedule. The neighborhood was quiet. Would stay again.

8049470,49703125,2015-10-05,44754609,Courtney,"Kelly was the sweetest and had everything we needed. She even had extra toothbrushes, baby powder, etc for us to use if need be. She has a cat and a dog who are both so cute and friendly :)  She even offered us coffee, but we were only there for a very brief two days so we  were already heading out bright and early. I would totally recommend staying here to anyone that asks!"
8049470,51255543,2015-10-18,45946430,Rae,"Stay here!! Best first Airbnb experience ever! Kelly was an absolute gem. The place was clean, cozy and exactly as described. Very safe and cute location, easy to find. Kelly was polite, cooperative, and just down to earth/easy to chat with. Even let me use her hairdryer after mine went on the fritz... A truly great person and great experience. And there was coffee! Would stay here again and recommend to all! "
8049470,52330252,2015-10-28,14951085,Robert,"How do I begin to describe the amazing experience I had at Kelly's home? Kelly is truly a wonderful person. After a few conversations I felt like we were kindred spirits. She has a great energy about her, and she bent over backwards to make sure I had an enjoyable stay in Seattle. Kelly told me about the area, provided me with directions and things to do, and she makes a darn good cup of coffee! The room is just lovely. Great artwork and the space is perfectly cozy. I honestly can say I have zero complaints about this stay. Kelly is easily the best Airbnb host I've ever had. "
7917700,43726104,2015-08-21,24124504,Tim,"We thoroughly enjoyed out night at Shannon's cute house. It was very clean, neat and comfortably decorated. The main bed was comfy, and the second bed was fine for an air mattress.

The location is wonderful, just across the street from Green Lake, but elevated enough so the noise from the street was minimal. We did have a concern arise during our stay, and Shannon responded quickly and the matter was resolved quite well."
1762354,8069982,2013-10-14,7696674,Benjamin,"Katrina was excellent in communicating with me during the stay via text. She was flexible with my hectic travel plans surrounding a wedding and accommodated a late check out. I wish I had more time to get to know Katrina during my stay.  Her and her family seemed lovely.

The unit itself was very nice and spacious.  The location is fantastic.  You are walking distance to fun spots on Capitol Hill."
1762354,8159233,2013-10-18,4043612,Caitlin,I had a very pleasant stay here.  Katrina and Rania were very flexible (I had to reschedule key pickup twice as the 2nd time I locked my keys in my car).  The apt was clean and cared for.  Very homey.  They even provided a few food items in the fridge.  Overall I would definitely stay here again. 
1762354,8238011,2013-10-21,5777777,Lou,Katrina was a great host with a great space. She was easy to reach if I had any questions and there were no issues at all.

We were provided with breakfast muffins, jelly and cream cheese, coffee and tea. We really enjoyed using the beautiful gas stove for the fresh sea scallops we purchased at Pike's Public Market. The bed was very comfy. We asked Katrina for restaurant suggestions within walking distance. We chose Smith's. Wow! great choice. We would stay here again!"
1762354,8697618,2013-11-12,9556229,Tanya,Katrina and Rania have an amazing place in a great location. They were very hospitable and easy to contact. I would definitely stay again.

1762354,11325719,2014-03-30,9926363,Thomas,"We stayed at Katrina's and Rania's place for one week and we loved it.
The apartment is not only bright and spacious, it has its very own and personal spirit that you discover while living there. Katrina and Rania welcomed us with some small attentions that make a difference and that make the start into the first day easy.
And the location is just perfect since you can walk to a lot(!) of places or catch different bus lines close by.
We highly recommend you to have Katrina's and Rania's place on the very top of your list if you look for a place to explore the city and it's wonderful parks or to just stay home and rest your tired legs."
1762354,11437537,2014-04-02,2062463,Shane,"We had the absolute best time at this apt! We didn't want to leave. The apartment is gorgeous, really comfortable and bright. Katrina was a fantastic host, providing brilliant restaurant recommendations for the local area and replying straight away to any queries we had. The bagels and cream cheese she left for us were so welcome when we arrived!

We were able to walk into the Pike Place Market and the Space Needle and all the other tourist traps but were also able to relax in a great neighborhood in the evenings."
1762354,11582206,2014-04-08,197372,Sarah,We loved it here! The location is ideal. We walked almost everywhere and I could go running at the park nearby. The girls were awesome...
1762354,12007009,2014-04-21,12501211,Caroline,"We loved this apt in Seattle. Amazing location, spacious & clean. Was thankful for the kettle & french press for my morning tea & coffee habit! It's easy to feel at home here."
1762354,12406690,2014-05-01,9479658,Em,"A great neighborhood, convenient to so many things like transportation and Bakery Nouveau! Walk down the hill to downtown, then take the bus back. Rania and Katrina are lovely hosts, and the ""Bright + Spacious""  description is absolutely spot on. Highly recommened."
1762354,14935340,2014-06-29,1839903,Janet,"The home is BEAUTIFUL and at a perfect location. When you first walk up to the home- you’re greeted by stone steps, that take you up to a lovely garden fenced off from street view. In this garden there is a huge hammock to lay away in the sun and enjoy the sounds of the city, on the opposite side there is an outdoor dining area, and a gas grill. We took advantage of the sunny days during our trip and BBQ. Inside the home is super spacious! The kitchen has everything you might need for a night in. We cooked the whole time and never felt like something was missing – Blender, toaster oven, cutting board, tons of knifes, pots, pans, silverware, cups, plates, bowls, and even cast iron pans!! Along with all the spices you can imagine to create a savory meal!! The home has the perfect flow and the layout couldn’t be better! The living room space is so big, the windows really do brighten up the area. We felt so comfortable that on one of our travel days…We spent the whole day relaxing with our nose in some really good books (And they have so many great reads). The energy in the home is spot-on filled with rocks, crystals, little knickknacks, fun card games (lol), and an epic disco ball! "
1762354,17344745,2014-08-11,12933746,Ty,"Kartrina's brother Dean was very clear and concise with his instructions regarding the parking pass and details regarding available parking the in the neighboring area (and potential traps!).  We appreciated the privacy the host gave us and took advantage of the recommendations left for us by visiting the local bakeries, restaurants and bars which make Capitol Hill must see area in Seattle.  Beautiful space and beautiful people make for a unique and memorable weekend get away. 

Thanks kindly,

Laurie and Andrea"
1762354,22712311,2014-11-12,2402509,Matthew,Fantastic apartment. The house is in a great location and is bright and well decorated. Perfect Seattle immersion experience. And definitely listen to the hosts restaurant recommendations -- they know their food!
1762354,24149894,2014-12-21,21899880,Kristin,"A fabulous way to experience Seattle.  Lovely home, fabulous location and perfect hosts. If you want to spend a few days living like a local - with all attractions a short walk or bus trip away - this is the place. Thanks, we had a great time. "
1762354,24421659,2014-12-28,3470710,Michael,"Amazing and fun!  The house was perfect, warm and cozy.  All the amenities you would need and a great location.  Their guitar was tuned."
1762354,24665650,2015-01-01,23241661,Scott,A beautiful apartment in a great location. Close to shops and transport. The house had everything we needed. We were very welcomed and took advantage of some great coffee and food recommendations in the area. Thank you! 
1762354,24899773,2015-01-03,3915170,Brendan,"We had a great time in Katrina's beautiful corner house in Seattle. It was a short walk away from Broadway, beautifully decorated, with a lot of personality. Felt right at home. Katrina was great with communication as well. Would recommend to anyone."
1762354,26683142,2015-02-17,170350,Stefan,"We had a great Valentine's day weekend in this beautiful place! Great atmosphere, and fantastic location with a bunch of stuff within walking distance (we especially loved getting breakfast at Bakery Nouveau). Would definitely recommend!"
1762354,40032683,2015-07-27,12647263,Day,It was such a beautiful home! It was beautifully decorated and light with a warm feeling. My partner and I loved it! They accommodated our hectic schedule and made our time in Seattle a breeze. My favorite part was the bathroom and how the house is pink ^_^. They left us a list of places to eat and that was a huge help!! Thank you so much for allowing us to enjoy your home 
1762354,56197470,2015-12-10,40994585,Sabrina,"Katrina was wonderful! The space was so open and bright, with a very cool disco ball :) And she provided amazing recommendations for things to see in the area, everything was so walkable. "
1622794,8061648,2013-10-14,7406448,Bill,"Nadine was very helpful, from start to finish.
The location was great, with easy access to the 
(amazingly beautiful) Queen Anne neighborhood 
and the shore of the Sound.
The Airstream trailer, brand new and very comfortable.
An excellent experience, very unique."
1622794,8202351,2013-10-20,5636210,Tom,"Really Cool!
Nadine was very helpful and responsive.  The trailer was very clean, and she even had pumpkin bread waiting for us.  
"
1622794,8266976,2013-10-22,6657285,Priscilla,"We came to Seattle to celebrate our first anniversary, since we had honeymooned in this city as well. I have to say, this trip was wonderful! Nadine is a great host, with lots of information on where to eat and shop. The Airstream is located so close to everything, you really could walk anywhere you need to go. We went to a concert at Key Arena, which really is a 10min walk with lots of restaurants and cool bars along the way. The Airstream itself is the epitome of Glamping! I mean, hot shower?! A SUUUPER comfy bed?!  And a microwave and fridge for all your yummy pike place market leftovers and goodies (the market is about a half hour walk, lovely views along the way). And the house and property where the airstream is located is so quaint and pretty! Lot of garden areas to sit and have your morning coffee before you set off on your city adventures. This was a fabulous trip with a very cool and comfortable place to stay. Thanks again, Nadine and Mark!"
1622794,8431329,2013-10-30,9147065,Jane,Nadine and Mark are ideal hosts. Anything and everything they could do to make my stay more comfortable... they did. The airstream is comfortable and cozy and the location is in a great neighborhood. Highly recommend!
1622794,8540330,2013-11-04,8660047,Anneliese,"Loved it! Nadine was very communicative and welcoming. The Airstream itself was very cute and cozy- an adorable place to spend nights in Seattle, even if it's storming like crazy outside! The shower was small but had plentiful hot water. My 6'5"" husband fit relatively comfortably in the space (though the bed was slightly short for him). Nice location in Queen Anne- just a couple blocks from groceries, coffee, restaurants etc. The only issue we had was managing parking as it is a tandem situation and must be coordinated with other guests. We opted to avoid having to rearrange cars by finding street parking, but much of the neighborhood requires a permit. Otherwise we had a fabulous stay!"
1622794,10471179,2014-02-20,7536583,Sarah,"Nadine was incredibly welcoming and the Airstream was a comfortable/unique/beautiful (you're in the garden behind her house!) accommodation, centrally located with easy access to all of the wonderful things Seattle has to offer.  We arrived late due to airline delays, and Nadine was still extremely hospitable.  There were croissants, coffee and cream, plenty of linens, and the Airstream itself is gorgeous.  I feel that for the price this was the best deal with came across on airbnb.  Thank you, Nadine, for a lovely stay!"
1622794,10666190,2014-03-02,1454106,Courtney,"This is an utterly charming place to stay, the size of a thimble but with everything you could need right at hand, and an extremely comfortable bed. I felt very cosy and tucked away.  Nadine is a very thoughtful host:  there were fresh tulips, home-baked scones for my first morning, excellent coffee and half-and-half in the fridge -- and she dealt instantly with the few minor issues like a sticking door. Most importantly, when I woke up the first morning with a painful inner-ear inflammation, within minutes she found me an urgent-care clinic within three blocks of the house and offered to drive me there herself.  The location is great: a serene neighborhood but  near lots of buses that can take you any direction you want to go. There are two dogs that come out to frolic in the yard where the Airstream is parked, but they keep to themselves.  I was in town for a convention and felt so pleased to be staying in a place with such character and not a generic hotel. "
1622794,10899978,2014-03-12,5481602,Sherlyn,"Nadine is a brilliant host who was very friendly and welcoming. She was very thorough in her explanation of the Airstream, and very responsive to any questions we had. The Airstream is very cool and packs a lot more than one would expect into a compact space. The location is a great base for exploring Seattle, because it is in a residential area but with bus stops for easy access to downtown Seattle. It is close to some of the key attractions in Seattle, the Space Needle and the Chihuly Glass exhibition. Nadine's food recommendations were great - in fact, we had breakfast at Toulouse Petit two days in a row because we liked it so much!"
1622794,10959810,2014-03-15,12107467,Donella,"We had a delightful stay in Nadine's fantastic Airstream. Our trip to Seattle was for business, as we were attending a conference at the convention center downtown. It was more challenging than we'd hoped to get there and back quickly, but the short walk to the monorail stop at Seattle was pleasant in the beautiful early spring weather. Everything in the Airstream was as listed, and the technology was really great -- from easy and fast wifi to a Roku-driven flatscreen TV in the ""bedroom."" Nadine herself was wonderful and met us at the appointed time. We forgot a couple of items that got tangled in the bedclothes, and she emailed to let me know and offered to drop them off downtown if needed. Don't hesitate to stay with Nadine -- fantastic, clean, easy, and fun!"
1622794,11036339,2014-03-17,3332523,Ericka,"We had such a wonderful stay this, the world cutest airstream. The property is exactly as described and the airstream immaculately kept. Nadine was a wonderful and welcoming host, greeting us when we arrived and giving us quick run through of the space. 

Location is great. Lots of restaurants/bars within walking distance. Overall, highly recommended! You'll love it! "
1622794,11225156,2014-03-25,1403934,James,Great stay and experience. Nadine and mark were great hosts and the airstream was one of the cooler places I've had the opportunity to stay in. It's a yacht on land!
1622794,11268061,2014-03-27,12717964,Veronica,The Airstream was comfy and it hat everyrhing you needed. The i.terior is loveley designed abd decoratet. Would love to stay there one more time.. nadine abd mark are very friendly host and if you need some information or helo one of them is always there to help you.
1622794,11330743,2014-03-30,12968340,Harriet,"Staying in Nadine's Airstream was one of the highlights of our weekend in Seattle.  It is spotless, showers in the morning were hot and the bed was really comfortable.  The place is very well equipped with lots of extra towels and all the necessary kitchen items.  We would love to stay again when we next visit.  Nadine was extremely responsive before we arrived and really welcoming once we got there.  We were sad to leave!"
1622794,11539810,2014-04-07,2434143,Lena,"My 8 college friends & I had our annual reunion in Seattle this year and rented the airstream for a few of the gals to sleep in. It was brand new with a comfortable double-bed, and then there's a bed that folds out of the dining table, AND a kind of shelf that folds out of the sofa-part, so the L-sofa formed two beds, which was really nice. The heater kept the airstream nice & warm, but it was kinda loud when it kicked on. Nadine provided ear plugs though, and it turned out no one really needed them. But it was a great little motor home--we just used it to sleep in and the shower/toilet as we rented out the basement apartment as well. "
1622794,11692278,2014-04-12,6486821,Angella,"The Airstream was as charming, clean and comfortable as I could have hoped.  Nadine and Mark were friendly and welcoming hosts.  The neighborhood is lovely and well situated.  All in all, a top-rate stay!  My only regret is that I did not have more time to enjoy the darling little space.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat. :)"
1622794,11842130,2014-04-16,8490897,Karen,"A great experience! The airstream was exactly as pictured: clean, bright and fully equipped. Too lazy to cook but the kitchen is ready: stove, frig/freezer and microwave. Restaurants nearby.  Having the garden/backyard outside made it even more homey.The location is ideal for exploring Seattle: quiet neighborhood with public transportation within a few blocks (u can look up schedules of buses online) and Seattle Center (Space Needle) is walking distance.  Highly recommended."
1622794,11933877,2014-04-19,2536604,Emily,"Nadine, Mark, and the Airstream were wonderful!  We had such a wonderful stay there last week.  The photos are very accurate to the state of the place - it's basically a brand new Airstream with very tastefully and thoughtfully chosen details (right down to the color coordinated dishes & dish soap!).  It's close quarters for sure if you're more than one person, but an awful lot of fun and novelty.  We were nervous about showers beforehand (how could that possibly work?), but kept them brief and never ran out of hot water.  Nadine and Mark have two sweet dogs, but when we told them that my partner was allergic, they very considerately stayed out of our way completely.  Walkable access to the sights in Seattle we wanted to see the most - and if a 20-40 minute walk is not for you, there are bus options too.  Would recommend to anyone who is a good and considerate guest!  The airstream deserves only the best!  "
1622794,12002826,2014-04-21,13031170,Mandy,Loved staying in Nadine's airstream! She thought of everything you could need for your stay. And you can look out the window to see her dogs playing! Her neighborhood is lovely as well. So close to walk to Seattle Center and near lots of  buses. Highly recommend staying there if you are in Seattle. 
1622794,12138793,2014-04-23,9207909,Henry,"My friend and I had a great time staying in Nadine's airstream. Location was good, with the city a cheap taxi ride away or a nice leisurely walk. The airstream itself was very nice and comfortable, though don't expect much head room in the shower if you are over 6ft, which we are. All in all, highly recommended!"
1622794,12341269,2014-04-29,5866234,Karva,"This is a long overdue review for such an amazing stay and wonderful host in Seattle. The Airstream is exactly what you would hope for and more. It is absolutely immaculate. The furnishings and interiors are what you would get at a 5-star boutique hotel - I was giddy when I first walked in. The only funny bit is the shower is really short. My 6'-0"" companion had a bit of a rough time (but not a deal breaker) with the shower but for 5'-5' me, it was perfect :)

Nadine is amazing. My friend and I were arriving at different times and she was there to welcome both of us separately! She was always available by text (or she said you could just knock on the back door but we felt bad about this). Her house is accessible to grocery stores, restaurants, the water, the space needle, and transportation. I would HIGHLY recommend Nadine's place to anyone staying in Seattle. "
1622794,13273098,2014-05-24,7574605,Courtney,"This entire experience was perfect. Nadine was so accommodating! We arrived to Seattle late and didn't get to her place until nearly midnight. She was waiting for us and showed us around the airstream and how to use the features. Nadine and Mark were great and made us feel at home.

The airstream is such a unique experience that I would recommend to anyone. Its small, but just enough room for 2 people. The bed was super comfortable. 

The neighborhood was perfect and very safe and we were able to walk to stores and even to the venue of the show we came in town for. "
1622794,13374634,2014-05-26,10974550,Liz,"The airstream looked just like the photos! Clean and well taken care of. The location was great - lots of places to walk to (food, seattle center, etc.). Nadine was helpful and friendly (both before and during our stay). I would stay here again.
"
1622794,13676159,2014-06-02,9225776,Jennifer,"Great place to stay! Everything is close by, fantastic location and a very comfortable alternative to a hotel. The bed is quite comfortable, Wi-Fi is reliable and the neighborhood is very cool.

Mark and Nadine are great hosts - there was fresh cream for coffee and croissants when I arrived. Everything was immaculate, clean and comfortable!! I highly recommend staying here if you want a neighborhood experience in the middle of the city—I would stay here again!
"
1622794,13880251,2014-06-07,14568317,Daniel,Nadine and Mark are wonderful hosts with an amazing property. The Airstream was everything I hoped for and much more and the hosts were very gracious. They were both super helpful and made several wonderful suggestions of things to see. If I am ever back in Seattle I can only hope they have an opening. 
1622794,14160499,2014-06-13,13751721,Tamara,"The airstream on Queen Anne is just as pretty and immaculate as advertised. We wanted to know how two of us would handle an RV close quarters for future  travel and we were pleasantly surprised that trailers have become so modernized. Bathroom and shower since not mentioned anywheres, are quite ample. Great shower,with separate and comfortable toilet-sink room. We also enjoyed getting to know the neighborhood of Queen Anne and mostly walked everywhere including to Mariners game which took about a half hour. Our only wish was that the patio had been more relaxing for our stay. Nadine apologized sincerely as did Mark when we arrived to construction work and workers right outside our space and very audible for the three days we were there. 
When staying in a small space, the outside area is VERY important for sanity, and this was our only unhappiness. However, I'm certain this was a one time remodel that will not be a problem most times. We would rent this space again."
1622794,14260491,2014-06-16,10956565,Sheri,Nadine and Mark were fabulous hosts and the airstream was just as cute as the pictures!! Everything was clean and fresh. 
1622794,14396704,2014-06-18,14430576,Claire,"Nadine could not have been a more attentive, welcoming and fun host. The airstream is amazing; all the mod cons we needed and it's beautifully maintained. The location's great - very peaceful, with good local amenities, but we were also able to walk everywhere to see the sites.  We cannot recommend this airstream Seattle adventure highly enough."
1622794,14554882,2014-06-22,5323869,Amy & Michael,"My husband and I had a wonderful 3-night stay in Nadine and Mark's Airstream on our first visit to Seattle.
 
The neighbourhood:
The trailer is situated in their beautiful back yard (complete with patio area at your disposal) in the lovely Queen Anne neighbourhood.  Their place is very well located: yes it's on a huge hill (this is Seattle, after all!), but it's just a short walk to some fantastic cafés, bars, and restaurants, and is well served by transit to take you downtown or further afield.  Highly recommend dinner and drinks at Black Bottle in Belltown.  Also, pop by the local grocery store and buy as many Rainier cherries as you can handle -- they're delicious.  Consider skipping the Experience Music Project (it was over-priced and poorly curated)  and go to the (free) Olympic Sculpture Park instead.
 
The Airstream:
The Airstream exceeded all our expectations: a great bed, fantastic shower (better than some hotels we've been to), ample dining area, fridge/freezer, beautiful décor, you name it. We had everything we needed for a comfortable stay and were even treated to 2 local beers in the fridge.  When an issue arose that was completely out of their control, Nadine and Mark worked diligently to resolve it and made sure we were looked after throughout.  They were attentive, warm, and gracious hosts, and we'd go back in a heartbeat."
1622794,14786570,2014-06-26,15996681,Megan,"I reserved the space for a trip with my mother and sister. Nadine was fantastic with getting us settled in and making recommendations for getting to know the neighborhood. Her response time was very quick for anything we needed. The Airstream is very cozy and a fun space to spend a few nights. The back yard and patio are beautiful. Great view a couple blocks up the hill, too!"
1622794,14862912,2014-06-28,9511603,Nate,"A great Airbnb experience! The Airstream was in great condition, and the hosts were friendly, helpful, and super organized about the rental process."
1622794,15094215,2014-07-02,9287004,Otto,The Airstream in the Heart of the City was as advertised.  We had a great stay and were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go.  We could not have asked for a better location for everything we wanted to do in Seattle.  The airstream was as described and the bed was very comfortable.  The hosts were very gracious and responsive.  Thanks so much for a great stay in Seattle.
1622794,15171469,2014-07-04,13240205,Beth And Brent,"We had the most amazing stay in the Airstream!  Do not be deterred by the small space- it is immaculate and brimming with fancy amenities to make the space seem larger.  Although is is comfy and there is space to relax outside the trailer, you probably won't spend much time there because the location is AWESOME!  We loved exploring the Queen Anne neighborhood, which we hadn't originally planned to do.  Nadine and Mark were fantastic hosts, and even left us some banana bread and a bottle of wine to toast the start of our honeymoon.  They were friendly and gave great suggestions about how to get around town and the best places to visit.  I highly recommend this offbeat stay!"
1622794,15393918,2014-07-08,14167468,Julie,Nadine and Mark were the perfect balance of there-for-you hosts and privacy. I never heard a peep from their dogs and it is in a quiet neighborhood. Always felt safe in the area and everything you might need is within walking distance. Was able to walk to Seattle center too. Appreciated having a hair dryer and some bath products provided. My first air bnb experience was awesome!
1622794,15543043,2014-07-11,7272522,Angela,"This airstream is even better than the photos! The photos don’t give justice to the high quality of the interior or the wonderful coordinating color details….. from the bedspread to the kitchen towels, this is a charming and beautiful decorated camper. It was much bigger than I had anticipated, with a queen size bed, large refrigerator and a shower you can stand up in.  With banana bread waiting for me in the kitchen and a microbrew beer in the fridge, I felt I had escaped everyday life without the work of hitching or towing the trailer. Thank you both for a memorable two days"
1622794,15686724,2014-07-14,10351910,Jennifer,Beautiful neighborhood - walked up the hills to a stunning overlook and enjoyed walking around and looking at the charming homes.
1622794,16199234,2014-07-23,13929568,Nick,the listing was exactly what was stated! Was very quaint and the host was incredibly accommodating! I highly recommend this!
1622794,16464895,2014-07-28,13643741,Alexis,"We had a great time staying with Mark and Nadine.  The Airstream is in perfect condition, very nicely furnished throughout and really comfortable. Towels, soap, kitchen ware, coffee, hot water and more were all provided, as well as a friendly greeting and help with our bags from Nadine. It was a perfect fit for two adults and a toddler (yes, your pack-n-play will fit if you remove the dining room table. Very easy to do). The location is exceptional, within walking distance of the Space Needle, Seattle Children’s Museum and lots of great restaurants. A couple blocks up the street is one of the most beautiful views of Seattle that we saw during our trip.  Downtown is just a few minutes away by bus, and easy to walk to if you have a few extra minutes. Staying with Nadine and Mark made a really special vacation even more fun, we look forward to seeing them again soon.

1622794,17209315,2014-08-09,16512729,Martin,Very nice accommodations. The airstream is clean new with everything you need. Nadine and Mark were very helpful and knowledgable of the Seattle area. It a great spot with lots food choices and things to do. I would recommend it to anyone interested in a change from the ordinary. Thanks Martin.
1622794,17336471,2014-08-11,2205463,Bonney,"The Airstream in Nadine's backyard thrilled our kids and was perfect for our trip.   Such a unique way to visit a city!  The trailer was outfitted just a like a hotel room with good linens, toiletries and an equipped kitchen.  The boys loved exploring her lovely garden in the morning and Nadine is a very kind and generous host.  The location was great for anyone wanting to explore Seattle.  Lots of great breakfast places within walking distance, our favorite was Macrina Bakery :)"
1622794,17565995,2014-08-14,17241862,Courtney,"We fell in love with Nadine and Mark's Airstream! It was beautiful, super comfortable, and made for an experience we will never forget! Everything you could possibly need is there. Highly recommend! Nadine also gave us great suggestions for things to do in and around Seattle. Next time we visit the area, we hope the Airstream is available."
1622794,17751611,2014-08-17,3715439,Claudia,"Great location, our hosts were super friendly and helpful. Airstream was clean and beautifully decorated. "

Bill"
1622794,18164020,2014-08-23,6179007,Christine,Charming hosts and an immaculate airstream. Upscale camping equivalent in the heart of Seattle!
1622794,18303892,2014-08-25,6694771,Ana,"My husband and I spent two nights in the airstream as part of our honeymoon - Nadine and Mark promptly picked up on that and welcomed us not only by being super friendly and helpful, but also by placing a bottle of prosecco freshly cooled in the fridge (thank you!!) as well as having a plate of snacks ready for us. We immediately felt completely at ease and at home, the place is charming and perfectly clean and simply SO MUCH FUN! No complaints whatsoever. 

So if you get a chance to experience Seattle, definitely experience it through the coziness of this perfectly located airstream; it is, on top of it all, just a  walk from cool sights that seemed to us to be located centrally. "
1622794,18623472,2014-08-29,12291345,Benoit,"We really enjoyed our time in Nadine's airstream. 
First it is really cute, very well decorated and equipped. 
It was also very pleasant to be able to get breakfast and dinner in the garden.
Nadine is a perfect hostess, always available and ready to help. 
Very good location (walking distance from the needle)."
1622794,18782670,2014-09-01,13396153,Rob,My wife and I had a great time staying in the Airstream!  We had plenty of space and it was much more convenient then staying in a hotel.  We were also within walking distance of Seattle Center and plenty of great restaurants.  We hope to return the next time we stay in Seattle!
1622794,18964302,2014-09-03,14061168,Scott,"What a cool experience compared to a standard, boring hotel room!  Nadine was prompt with her response and was a very accommodating host.  She provided recommendations on breakfast, lunch and dinner, and even stocked the fridge with a couple of treats.  The neighborhood was great and is roughly a mile walk to major attractions in downtown Seattle.  If I travel there again Nadine will be the first to know.  Thanks again!"
1622794,19459597,2014-09-13,17030595,Carole,"Nadine was an amazing host!  She was very accessible and answered any questions that we had, she also made great suggestions for food, drink and fun!  The Airstream was awesome!  It was so funky and different, it was probably one of the highlights from our trip.  The location was perfect and it was easy to get to all of the interesting sights around Seattle."
1622794,19781851,2014-09-18,4112632,Jessica,"Nadine was super accommodating and offer some wonder dinner and brunch suggestions.  Plus you're super close to Kerry park with wonderful views of downtown Seattle.  The airstream was clean, quiet and just a treat to stay in.  We are so glad we found this gem."
1622794,20124869,2014-09-23,17813720,Jonathan,"Nadine's Airstream was a highlight of our West Coast trip. We actually had plans to stay on an Airbnb houseboat in Seattle but he cancelled on us 6 days before (long story). The Airstream was thankfully open and in the end we were thankful the houseboat had cancelled. 

Nadine and Mark were incredible hosts. She had freshly baked pumpkin bread awaiting our arrival and even put some local beers in the fridge for us. The Airstream was bigger than I had anticipated and was perfect for our two day stay in Seattle. The house it's located at is gorgeous and there was a small patio outside our door where we could relax outdoors in the stunning Seattle weather. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was nicely sized. 

We would recommend this space to anyone. "
1622794,20487555,2014-09-30,13752746,Karen,Nadine feels like an old friend. The trailer was well furnished and comfortable
1622794,20749188,2014-10-05,171805,Anna,"Nadine was very helpful, quick and easy to work with from start to finish. The airstream was impeccable, comfortable and just plain fun! The location couldn't be better, with easy access to the Seattle Center and downtown as well as a great selection of local restaurants and grocery stores. Nadine made some great recommendations and I would highly recommend the whole experience! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
1622794,21030260,2014-10-10,19118707,Judi,"Greeted by Mark and shown around the Airstream and backyard. Very pleasant, quiet area and close to downtown Seattle. Grocery store and many restaurants are walkable nearby. The Airstream had all of the comforts of home and very clean. Operating instructions for stove, furnace and TV, DVD, etc clearly written. At 6.4"" my husband had amble head room albeit the shower was a tad bit short but not a problem. Both Nadine and Mark very helpful and accommodating. "
1622794,21239927,2014-10-13,16341782,Kimberly,Had a wonderful time in the Airstream!  Very clean and so cozy.  It is a very safe neighborhood and there was a lot to do within walking distance.
1622794,21748564,2014-10-23,21465116,Crawford,"everything about the experience was awesome...highly recommend. great location, great hosts."
1622794,26322870,2015-02-09,26600074,Alexandra,"Nadine was a wonderful host. We had a late arrival and she was nice enough to let my brother, who lives in town, to check in for us. The Airstream is so fun to stay in and very well turned out. My husband and I had such a wonderful experience. Great location, wonderful place to stay. "
1622794,26726152,2015-02-17,8803600,Lisa,I highly recommend Nadine's Airstream. It was cozy and super cute! The only thing that could've been better was if I was actually able to travel in it. The location was convenient to a lot of things to do. 
1622794,27623671,2015-03-08,28645900,Anneliese,"We loved staying in Nadine's airstream!  Nadine was incredibly helpful and welcoming. The airstream is clean, bright, modern and the perfect home base for a weekend in Seattle.  The location is excellent. Hope to visit again. Thank you, Nadine!"
1622794,27782424,2015-03-11,16921191,Lisa,"We had a great experience in the Airstream apartment.  Nadine greeted us with a warm welcome and showed us everything we needed to know about the Airstream, which was absolutely gorgeous inside.  We really appreciated the croissants and bottle of wine she provided for us.   The location is great.   Easy walk to great restaurants and grocery store.  The neighborhood is beautiful and felt safe even at night.  We usually stay in a hotel room downtown when we visit Seattle.  It was a nice change staying here and we would highly recommend it."
1622794,28187435,2015-03-19,937951,Ana,"Nadine greeted us upon our arrival and explained the ins and outs of her wonderful Airstream accommodations.

Eric and I had a great stay!  The bed is comfortable, the bathroom (toilet & sink) surprisingly room... lots of storage, and the sofa and table definitely large enough for two.  

The location couldn't be better, with its walking distance to many Seattle landmarks, as well as the waterfront.  The nearby public transportation  (buses to downtown and Capitol Hill) is excellent, too!

Thank you to our friendly and helpful hosts Nadine & Mark!"
1622794,28728184,2015-03-29,28728809,Melissa,"I could not have asked for a better Airbnb experience! The Airstream is exactly as it appears in photos, super clean and comfy. We arrived pretty late, but Mark was awake and kind enough to show us all the details of the Airstream. Towels and toiletries were provided, as was a bottle of wine and croissants, and the space heater in the kitchen really does warm up the entire place! Airstream should hire Nadine and Mark to their marketing team because after our trip I'm seriously considering buying one now!!"
1622794,29240970,2015-04-05,6079533,Casey,"Nadine and her husband Mark were great hosts and the Airstream is awesome! I had a noon checkout time at my hotel which was several hours earlier than the specified check-in time for the Airstream, but Nadine was very gracious and responded quickly to my request for an earlier check-in. She met me at the home and showed me the ins and outs of how the Airstream works, then gave me some great tips on areas of interest to explore locally. 

The Airstream is just a couple blocks down from Kerry Park, where you'll find the best views of the Seattle skyline, the waterfront, the Space Needle, and so on. Walk a little further across and you can admire the beautiful architecture of the homes on Highland. Walk back down the hill and you'll be at the Seattle Center in 10 or 15 minutes at most!

I thoroughly enjoyed my time in the Airstream and was able to make the best of a short 2-day trip because of its proximity to everything.

Thanks again, Nadine!"
1622794,30081836,2015-04-17,29184362,James,"Arriving at the home, Nadine came out to welcome me and was very friendly assisting with my luggage.  She guided me into the beautifully landscaped back yard, and gave me a thorough rundown of how to use everything in the Air Stream trailer.

The accommodations were sparkling clean and exactly as listed in all the online pics. Very cozy and homey, this trailer truly has all the comforts of home.  There is a nice list of restaurant recommendations and local Seattle tour guides if you are new to the city.  The location was fantastic, walking distance to many wonderful eateries and the Seattle Center / Space Needle / EMP.  The evenings were quiet and peaceful. If coming home after nightfall one finds the back yard very well lit and welcoming with lights strung overhead casting a warm soft glow.

The parking is very tight, this is Seattle after all... and to that point Nadine was very accommodating allowing use of the driveway and shuffling cars around when necessary.  

I highly recommend booking this property, will definitely be back during my next stay in Seattle!"
1622794,30616621,2015-04-25,29416854,Robin,I booked Nadine's airstream for my parents. They had a great stay and found the nieghborhood to be really convenient and walkable. Nadine even got my mother some decaf coffee and helped them to get on their way back to the airport. Thanks for being a great hostess and helping me with the sunrise trip! Highly recommend :)
1622794,30895083,2015-04-28,21693021,Josh,"A nice, private space in the heart of the city! The trailer was as-advertised and provided a nice base-of-operations for exploring Seattle. My only concern would be the temperature of the trailer when it gets cold (it was a little chilly in the morning despite a small space heater), but that was not a problem for my trip in April! "
1622794,31182615,2015-05-03,28774433,Kyle,Nadine's Airstream was great! We stayed two nights and are great people to stay with....including their dogs. The trailer is in their backyard and is stocked with everything you'd need. The location is close enough to downtown but it's still very quiet for being in the city. 
1622794,32199761,2015-05-15,5555014,Chuck,"First off, if you are curious about Airstreaming, this is an excellent way to experience it. Nadine and Mark are excellent hosts. Check in was simple and easy. The Airstream was appointed with all the usual details and the blueberry muffins were a welcome treat after a long cross-country trip.

The Airstream is situated in the backyard so it feels like you have your own private oasis.  And your hosts have taken care of the operational details (water, electric connections) you would normally have with a trailer.

One note: if you rent a car, go as small as possible. Parking is limited on the cozy street and it makes it easier to share space on the property.

All this plus a convenient location made for a very nice stay."
1622794,32466820,2015-05-18,26105597,Sommer,We had such a lovely stay!!! The neighborhood was central to everything yet we were amazed at how quiet it was.  We were welcomed with a bottle of wine and fresh baked muffins and the airstream was immaculate. Couldn't have been happier with our overall experience. 
1622794,32974354,2015-05-24,728532,Marsha,"Loved staying in the Airstream! Beautifully decorated, plenty of storage area, large refrigerator, hot shower, and most comfortable beds. Nadine and Mark's place is an oasis in the city, peaceful and verdant.  The Hucks are helpful and easygoing, and most gracious hosts. We so appreciated the croissants, coffee and tea that awaited us - would definitely go back."
1622794,33473599,2015-05-28,33794309,Christine,"Nadine made us feel very welcome. She responded to our email and texts immediately. Everything was exactly as described. The airstream was delightful, very spacious, with every amenity and clear instructions. Lower Queen Anne is a great location, within walking distance of good restaurants, fun bars, and entertainment. Nadine's backyard is a lovely oasis.  "
1622794,33938810,2015-06-02,3243887,Natalie,"Nadine could not have been more welcoming. Though parking space is tight, when I told her about my disability, she made sure I had a spot in the driveway, and was very solicitous about my getting around. The airstream was amazing-- top of the line, plus it's been our dream to stay in one for a very long time. We were there for 4 days, but we'd come from LA so we had way too much stuff to comfortably store, but that was our fault, not theirs. Everything about the airstream was awesome, the yard was beautiful, and it felt very private."
1622794,34184143,2015-06-05,713209,Jason,"Nadine was very friendly and accommodating. Airstream was immaculate and neighborhood great - restaurants, stores very close."
1622794,34303162,2015-06-07,12196190,Lawrence,"Had a great time in the Airstream.  Very cool, different experience.  Very clean, great recommendations, great location, etc. -  all in all really enjoyed our time and would absolutely recommend it to anyone traveling to Seattle."
1622794,34725509,2015-06-11,33858576,Denise,"We absolutely loved our stay in Nadine and Mark's airstream. It's located in the Lower Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle so it was in walking distance of Pike Place Market, the Chihuly Garden and Glass and other Seattle attractions. Nadine gave us very good recommendations on local restaurants we really enjoyed. The airstream is fully furnished with everything we needed and then some. We liked the setting in the backyard which is landscaped nicely and has plenty of furniture if you want to sit outside. If we ever go back to the Seattle area we would definitely stay in the airstream again. This was our first time to book thru Airbnb and loved everything about it and will try to book with them again in the future. "
1622794,35367279,2015-06-18,28134018,Felicity,We had so much fun staying in the airstream.  Our stay will be a story we talk about for a long time.  Nadine was great and she made our stay super comfortable (we love the way she has the camper decorated).  We were easy walking distance to get our tourist on at all of the attractions near Pike Place Market. We would stay here again in a heartbeat!
1622794,35568318,2015-06-20,4605544,Bethann,Nadine made me feel so welcome while I was traveling to Seattle for work. I felt like I was staying with friends (who gave me a lot of privacy)! :) I loved the Airstream -- it was immaculately clean and was decorated so cute!
1622794,35793403,2015-06-22,26481960,Inga,Thank you for a great stay! The airstream was amazing. Just like the pictures. The best location we could find. We had a gray time in Seattle! 
1622794,36186227,2015-06-26,5715309,Matt,"Nadine and her husband were exceptionally accommodating and great hosts to have in Seattle! The Airstream was clean, well stocked, and as described. Nadine gave great advice about the Seattle area and was a friendly face to know in town. We'd highly recommend a stay to anyone coming to Seattle...or anyone who just wants to stay in an Airstream!"
1622794,36421268,2015-06-28,29646811,Crystal,"Nadine and Mark were very friendly and nice when we checked in. Their airstream is exactly as pictured. The decor of the bed covers and mugs are all very cute. It's quite cozy, so be prepared for that. Seattle was in a heat wave when we visited, and the fast working AC was much appreciated. It's was a little bit of a walk to get to downtown and Pike Market (especially in the heat) so we utilized the buses, which stop just one or two blocks away. The area is safe and I never felt weird coming back to the airstream at night. 

If you need complete quiet when you sleep, just a note that there is some ambient noise at night if the vent/fans or the AC is on. But there are ear plugs provided too! Also, someone taller than 6'1"" might have some difficulty taking a shower since there is a low ceiling. We had a pleasant stay overall."
1622794,37691734,2015-07-09,14335341,Joel,"The airstream was well situated in the city very close to the Seattle Center and Downtown area. The space was just as described, very clean and cozy."
1622794,37952701,2015-07-12,6281985,Sarah,"What a jewel of a spot!  This was perfect for us.  Loved the cleverness and cleanliness of the Airstream.  Sweet yard, felt surprisingly private. Nadine was friendly and  accommodating, and even brought us extra cooking utensils and art supplies we asked for.  "
1622794,38420388,2015-07-15,36071248,Abbie-Stuart,"Nadine made us feel welcome long before we ever got there.  She was so helpful answering all of our questions.  While staying with her she was always available to help us out , answer questions, and give excellent advice.  

We loved staying at the airstream. The location in Seattle is terrific. Even better is being able to have a space of our own and being able to share her beautiful yard was very peaceful in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a big city.  The airsteam had so much room, we couldn't believe it. There was a place for everything.  It might be my favorite travel experience and I am not a lady who would appreciate camping. I will admit that I hated to leave.  We would certainly stay here again.

Thank you, Nadine, for everything. You made our trip spectacular."
1622794,39176900,2015-07-21,17155683,Andy,"I'll keep the review brief as we are still on the road. We had a perfect time in the Airstream. Everything about it (the Airstream itself, the garden and the location was just perfect. It made our stay in Seattle just perfect, much more interesting and fun than being in a hotel. Thank you Mark for the lovely Washington red wine (something you cannot get in the UK) and the recommendation of Toulouse Petit to dine at was a great one. Finally, thanks to Daeten who recommended Bite of Seattle which we would have missed, a great afternoon of music, food, beer and wine!"
1622794,39511257,2015-07-24,8383491,Chelsie,Had a wonderful time staying at Nadines place. Our flight got us to Nadines at 1am and she was very clear about how to get into the place so late in the night. Definitely spacious and clean- would highly recommend! 
1622794,39746336,2015-07-26,12774405,Suzanne,"Nadine was very welcoming and waved us into the driveway as we were looking for street parking.  The Airstream is just as cute it is pictured and was a fun alternative to the usual lodging we have stayed in on Airbnb.  Perfect for a couple nights, but very cozy to shuffle the suitcases for much longer.  In the Airstream's defense, there was plenty of storage, if you wanted to unpack the suitcase.  A great location for sightseeing.  We walked to Seattle Center/Space Needle and Monorail, etc and looked around before walking to dinner on Mercer St.  We highly recommend it for a fun experience."
1622794,40075047,2015-07-28,27941528,Monica,"With a warm welcome, Nadine greeted us as soon as we were out of the cab. An airstream in the middle of Seattle, what could bee more fun?  
So clean and comfortable, with outside seating, we really loved this. 
Great location in a great city...lots of nearby restaurants, we really enjoyed our stay."
1622794,41764749,2015-08-09,35334278,Jack,"Great place! Close to KeyArena/Space Needle. Small but cozy, and has everything you would need, including AC, two (!) TVs, and a Roku. Nadine was very accommodating and friendly. A+++++++ would stay at again."
1622794,42309467,2015-08-12,38999180,Becca,Nadine was a wonderful hostess! She was waiting for us when we arrived and showed us around. The airstream was wonderful and is just as pictured. The back yard was welcoming and a nice place to relax at the end of the day. The neighborhood is very cute and an easy walk to the sights of Seattle. It was a perfect home base for our visit!
1622794,43029480,2015-08-17,6255703,Kirsten,Great stay at the airstream! Everything was very clean and surprisingly spacious for two people. Nadine and Mark were very communicative prior to arrival and welcoming when we began our stay. Great location with a beautiful look out just two blocks up the street. Very cool experience! 
1622794,43681264,2015-08-21,1678230,Jenny & Norbert,"My wife and I stayed in the luxury Airstream for the week while visiting the gorgeous city we once called home. It's amazing to find even a ""trailer"" has more to offer than our normal daily needs. Nadine is flexible, responsive and super friendly. She and her husband keeps this space fully stocked and extremely clean. The location is only a few blocks from Lower Queen Anne, yet tucked away from all the busy street traffic and noise. We highly recommend experiencing this once-in-a-lifetime living quarters!"
1622794,44166349,2015-08-24,29307341,亲爱的安,very nice experience in Seattle. Nadine and Mark are kind and friendly. My daughter likes the caravan very much.
1622794,45157495,2015-08-31,1827610,Pete,"What a great place and super unique to the AirBnB experience! Nadine greeted us upon arrival with a warm smile and everything we could want in the Airstream at the ready - blueberry scones, fresh and juicy peaches, fresh cream in a cow decanter ;) and plenty of linens for what turned out to be a rainy August weekend in Seattle. Go figure, right!? Not to mention that the camper itself is top of the line and decked out with everything you could need for a few days of city camping.

The location here is outstanding...walkable to the entire Queen Anne area uphill and down. The RV itself is tucked behind the main house and felt entirely secure and then some. We found ourselves cozying up to a few Netflix adventures one night while listening to the soft pitter-pat of the rain on the camper roof. I swear I would have never known we were in the city had it not been for an occasional horn honking or dog barking in the distance. Bottom line is that this place is ideal for a couple looking for a unique getaway in a prime location.

Thanks Nadine!"
1622794,45822453,2015-09-06,34216336,Margaret,"We could not have been made to feel more welcome by Nadine. She delivered a plate of delicious fresh homemade banana bread. What a wonderful greeting. 

Staying in an Airstream trailer was a delight. We were totally enchanted by the experience. The location was ideal for our needs, easy access to public transportation. There was always sufficient parking for our family when they visited us. 

The towels and bedding was plentiful. There was a fully equipped kitchen with cooking gear and utensils. We had a coffee pot and Nadine provided a sufficient amount of coffee that took us through our entire stay.

There was a full backyard for our use with a hammock, lounge chairs and an outdoor dinning table if we wanted to eat outside. Nadine put  a great deal of though and effort into making her guests comfortable. She responded quickly to our emails and was always able to answer any questions we had either about transportation, where to eat, and how to work various aspects of the trailer.

On our last day in Seattle Nadine and her husband went an extra mile to make our leaving the city as easy as possible. I cannot thank them enough.  "
1622794,46998099,2015-09-14,3052849,Noemie,"Nadine was a very good and considerate communicator, and everything about our stay was made easy and enjoyable. We loved to spend a couple of nights in this airstream, which is more comfortable than many hotel rooms. Bed is super comfy and Nadine thoughtfully made a pull out bed for our toddler daughter who had a blast in the airstream. Such a special stay, highly recommend to anyone looking for a fun yet comfortable option to stay in Seattle!"
1622794,47839922,2015-09-21,6925160,Asa,"Wow! We had such a great time at Nadine's Airstream. We usually stay with friends when we visit Seattle, so we thought we'd try something new.

It's beautifully appointed - very modern interior. It is a small space (it is an Airstream!), but Nadine has done a wonderful job opening it up. 

Its super close and convenient to most of the places we wanted to go. Belltown and Downtown was only a 25 minute walk or so, and it's a quick (and $10 Uber) to Capitol Hill, Ballard, and Fremont. 

We had no issues with parking (Nadine and Mark were traveling, so the driveway was free), but parking is definitely in short supply in the immediate area. Use public transportation if you can!

Nadine was fantastic - quick and open communication, and she left us scones (and a couple of beers...) when we arrived! After a long day of traveling, it was a lovely touch. 

Great spot, highly recommended. Would gladly stay here again. "
1622794,48102580,2015-09-23,41064568,Katherine,"Nadine was absolutely wonderful! She made us feel welcome even before we met her at the beautiful Airstream. We stayed on her property and yet felt like we had our very own space. I would highly  recommend staying here, especially if you like a little bit of adventure and a different experience!   And the location could not be beat. Thank you Nadine! "
1622794,49512895,2015-10-04,4365795,Tanner,"The airstream was everything we expected and more. The pictures are very accurate and the setting was amazing. We arrived after dark and everything was lit up with nice patio lights that made us feel very welcome. The location was perfect for us, and the neighborhood was incredible. Lots of restaurants and bars within walking distance. The airstream has plenty of room and any amenity that a hotel would have. 

Nadine was out of town when we visited but was very quick to respond by email when we contacted her with a few questions. We will be going back very soon. "
1622794,50125218,2015-10-09,6925509,Georgina,"Nadine was such a lovely hostess!  The airstream was so cute and had everything needed.  She gave me a quick tour and totally made herself available to me for any questions.  She even left some pumpkin bread for me!  The power went out on the second day of my stay, but Nadine went out of her way to help me move to her guest bedroom, and was very thoughtful about the whole situation.  Thank you!!! 
The neighbourhood is so charming, and if you go further up the hill, there is a lovely view.
The pictures of the airstream are absolutely accurate.  I had a lovely time and will be back!"
1622794,54518407,2015-11-21,6724870,Chris And Audrey,We had a. very delightful stay in a fabulous new Airstream trailer. We were smack in the middle of beautiful Queen Anne district with plenty of great restaurants nearby. Nadine is a great communicator and host. 
2818420,17014759,2014-08-05,16720001,Katherine,"Saleem and his wife were very welcoming!  Their house was a perfect location and size for what we needed that week in Seattle!  The place was perfectly clean, comfortable, and was fully stocked with necessities.  Thank you again for the awesome bottle of red wine upon our arrival!  I would recommend everyone to stay here!"
2818420,17173213,2014-08-08,18741982,Robert,"The apartment was clean, bright, and comfy.  We met the host briefly and he was friendly and helpful.  We felt very much at home.  The neighborhood is great.  Plenty of shops and restaurants within 2 blocks.  There is a good grocery 2 blocks away, and the apartment's kitchen had everything we needed to prepare our own meals.  Even though shopping and nightlife is very close by, the apartment is quiet and peaceful."
2818420,20752439,2014-10-05,13418646,Maureen,"The little apartment was wonderful, clean, spacious, natural light was lovely.  Kitchen was open and had everything you would need.  Perfect location for walking and public transport.  Highly recommend!"
2818420,22883359,2014-11-17,17654024,Elaine,"Clean, quiet, comfortable well-sized apartment.  This is  our second airbnb experience and again,  all expectations were met.  All essential amenities were provided.  With Julia's and Fuel so close by, morning dining was easy. We were visiting family and did not stay in the unit much, only after dinner.  Unit very quiet.  Be warned, however, of the two watchful golden lab/retrievers who patrol the side-street where the entrance into 1715 exists.  Thank you, Saleem!"
8251213,47871672,2015-09-21,44087012,Peter,"This place was awesome.  Very bright, spotlessly clean, and well appointed.  Was in a great area, and you can get to almost anywhere in Seattle by cab or uber for next to nothing.  Chris was fantastic to deal with.  This was my first AirBnB stay and will definitely not be my last.  I plan on returning for all future trips to Seattle."
8251213,48477348,2015-09-26,37162883,Cynthia,Love how accommodating Chris was and how good he was at communicating details to us. the place was very clean and very reasonably priced. 
8251213,48830288,2015-09-28,37162883,Cynthia,"Hey. Love how accommodating Chris was and how clean the room was. 
"
8251213,49730869,2015-10-05,22196454,Mary,"Chris was great. Easy, clear and concise communication. Place very comfortable.  Great location. Toiletries appreciated. Would stay there again in a heartbeat. Might just mention that apartment is 'down' ramp, not up. Thanks again."
8251213,51383775,2015-10-19,9461064,Lisa,"We had a great stay at Chris' place! Everything was as described, clean and spacious. Chris was very flexible, accommodating and responsive. The location was perfect as well- only a short drive (or 20 minute walk) to downtown and many great restaurants and shops within walking distance. Highly recommended!"
8251213,52754139,2015-11-01,21123665,Marcin,"Great location (Capitol Hill) and very nice and spacey apartment, 15min walking distance to downtown. Lot's of pubs, restaurants and shops within 5min walking. Thank you Chris!"
8251213,53309439,2015-11-07,48158451,Brandon,The apartment was perfect. Very comfortable bed. All toiletries were included. The champagne and rose were an awesome touch. Chris was great to deal with. He went out of his way to make sure our stay was perfect. I would highly recommend this place to anyone.  
8251213,53437205,2015-11-08,2530503,Jonathan,"Wonderful experience.  Great location.  The amenities were much needed and welcome, as we left our toothbrushes at home.  

The cleanest Airbnb I have ever rented.

I will be back. Really enjoyed how quiet it was."
8251213,53800310,2015-11-12,11176607,Sandy,"Chris was a wonderful host.  He was easy to reach by phone or email for any questions, and didn't seem to mind my inquiries at all!  "
8251213,55529491,2015-12-01,12836652,Lauren,"Chris' place was amazing! Very clean, great location, and simply pleasant to hang out in. He also left us toiletries and offered us wine which were nice added bonuses. Only wish we had stayed here longer. Cannot recommend this place enough!"
8251213,55554884,2015-12-01,7919833,Michelle,"I requested a reservation extremely last minute, and Chris was very flexible and worked with me. I spent the entire day moving, and the space was very come after such a long, hard day."
8251213,56439248,2015-12-13,299764,James,Awesome space! Very clean and nicely decorated. WiFi works well and it is nice to have a kitchen. The neighborhood is really cool with (phone number hidden) restaurants and bars within 10 minutes walk. Parking is super difficult to find on Friday and Saturday nights but not impossible during the day. Chris leaves a street parking pass so you can leave your car on the street. Super fun place to stay and I definitely recommend.
5395530,28418115,2015-03-23,11097917,Torrence,"This was probably one of the best airbnb's I've been in to date. Robert was very welcoming and gave us a great opportunity to stay in a HUGE 1 bedroom apartment. Wifi was great, there were speakers in every room for musical entertainment, there was a big screen tv, a ps3, and the list goes on. I felt like I could live at this place myself. It felt completely home-y and was in a great neighborhood. Robert provided us with a parking space out back, was a little difficult to get to, but still completely doable. Places with parking get a huge plus in my book. The courtyard...my the courtyard...I can't say much more, except that I loved staying here. The tagline says most of it all, ""old world charm--"" but leaves out the modern beauty of technology and convenience of Robert's listing. "
5395530,28835021,2015-03-30,29511902,Carlos M.,"This is a fantastic place with a beautiful view in a delightful neighborhood with AMAZING food and amenities around. If you can walk a good distance, absolutely everything is around. I made it to 6th and Pike in 22 minutes everyday from here. Robert is a fantastic host and I highly recommend it. "
5395530,30744345,2015-04-26,31758010,Dan,"Wow, just wow. What a perfect place and host for my first Airbnb experience! Robert couldn't have made things easier. The place itself is fantastic: a huge one bedroom beautifully built and adorned apartment, with an amazing courtyard (basically and mini-park!) to hangout in and a view of downtown (including the Space Needle!) that is literally picturesque. And the neighborhood itself is lovely, quiet but lively enough so that you don't have to walk far for good eats and drinks. I will be back there next time I'm in Seattle!"
5395530,31956843,2015-05-12,15740697,Carlos,Robert was a great host and helpful. The apartment was great in a great location!
5395530,33260334,2015-05-26,2672374,Pei Pei,"We were in Seattle for a wedding and Rob's hospitality really helped us have a great time. He graciously picked us up at the train station, gave us a quick but helpful overview, was extremely responsive to texts and emails before and during our stay, and was very flexible about check-out. Apartment was spacious and clean and in a prime location - we would definitely stay again! Thanks!"
5395530,34702194,2015-06-11,27169854,Nate,"This was a perfect location! Walking distance to all of Capitol Hill and Downtown. There's a bus stop nearby, too. It was a perfect home base for exploring the city.

The view was wonderful, the decor is super cool, Alice the cat was wonderful company, and I'd definitely look to see if this place is available if I visit Seattle again. Robert was always just a phone call or text away. Wonderful experience!"
5395530,35068269,2015-06-15,6803143,Ivy,This place was beautiful and we were very  comfortable. We could see ourselves living there. It was very clean and we were very happy. 
5395530,35551235,2015-06-20,8674714,Denise,"We truly enjoyed our stay at Rob's place and loved the neighborhood within closing walking distance to fun restaurants and shops.  His home definitely has the ""old world charm"" has all the amenities and he could not have been a more gracious host!  Thanks again for a wonderful 1st airbnb experience. "
5395530,43902318,2015-08-23,28423311,Katrina,Great experience in the perfect location! The apartment was very comfortable and Rob thought of everything to make my stay enjoyable. Had some issues with the wifi but I believe he has gotten that sorted out now. The courtyard was my favorite part - a beautiful garden oasis in the middle of the city!
5395530,47155842,2015-09-16,1827089,Sherman,"The stay at Rob's apartment was great! Easy to get around everywhere in Seattle. Clean and lots of amenities like washer/dryer, parking, etc. Fun backyard area with an amazing view of the Space Needle."
5395530,47663471,2015-09-21,19991371,Lasten,"The apartment is pretty and very clean. Robert was very nice and responded immediately to questions. He even drove me to T-Mobile to buy sim card, it's a big help. His cat Alice was very cute and quiet.  I'd definitely stay here again!"
5395530,50041889,2015-10-08,36339291,Alfred,"Robert was awesome -- super nice and very professional. I wasn't due to arrive until late night on a Sunday, yet Robert was willing to meet me close to 11 pm to hand me the keys. He had a welcome message and WiFi passwords written on a whiteboard, showed me all the features of his place, and introduced me to Alice, his beautiful cat.

Alice is warm and purrs a lot. She made me fall asleep on the couch a couple of times.

The place looks like a model home. It's spacious, has nice furniture, is perfectly decorated, and the kitchen was stocked with fruit and bottled water.

The location was great - 1.0 miles by foot to the Amazon campus in downtown Seattle.

I hope to be able to book Robert's home again when I visit Seattle next time. It's one of the best places where I've stayed."
5395530,51557519,2015-10-21,249723,Marianne,"Great location, welcoming and flexible host, comfortable apartment - good combination!"
5395530,52615847,2015-10-31,31701263,Chris,"Rob was great!  So incredibly flexible and easy to work with on my reservation; he even offered to pick me up from the airport!   Rob's place is very clean and tidy, and a nice size (esp by Seattle standards!)   He showed me around, offered me whatever he had (including purified water) and then left me to my privacy - knowing that, as the complex property manager, he was always around if needed.  I would definitely stay again ~ thanks, Rob :)"
5395530,53527052,2015-11-09,16140532,Selina,"Robert made Mark and I feel VERY welcome. We got in very late due to a travel delay, and he met us at the apartment with keys in hand. Robert showed us his beautiful place and made every effort to make us feel comfortable and taken care of (even grabbing us an iron from his storage!) He was also very responsive over text and email both before our visit and during our stay.

The apartment itself is lovely, in a fantastic location, and the bed is so comfortable. This has been a fantastic airbnb experience for us  -- especially for first time Seattle visitors. I can't recommend Robert's place enough!"
5395530,54137683,2015-11-16,7275465,Melissa,"Robert was very welcoming and happily accommodated the check-in and check-out times to coincide with our flights. He was easy to reach and was a great resource for the city. The space was great! Very clean and airy, and we enjoyed coming home to Alice :) . The location of the apartment is great - a quick walk to all that Capitol Hill has to offer, and on a quiet, residential street. Plus, a prime view of the space needle! A great place to base your Seattle trip."
5395530,54750964,2015-11-23,47421956,Joanne,"It was a pleasure staying at Robert's apartment.  Very roomy, comfortable and great location to enjoy the city.  Robert was very welcoming and accommodating to our needs.  Also, Alice the cat is a nice addition- sweet, quiet, and easy to care for. "
8053921,45207722,2015-08-31,42298640,Meagan,"Sandy was an amazing host! She was very accommodating to all our needs, right down to sharing her coffee in the morning. The neighborhood she is located in is great but what put it over the top was her knowledge of the goings on in the area. The apartment is exactly as billed, very spacious, especially the bathroom. Sandy also responded to our requests, even when we required an extra bed. Would highly recommend!"
8053921,45870639,2015-09-06,26026175,Cris,"Sandy is such a down-to-earth, honest, thoughtful host. My boyfriend and I loved hanging out with her and are so grateful for her hospitality and accommodations! She's got a great space, and sectioned off part of the main living room space of her apartment just for us as her visitors. Her apartment is pretty centrally located too - an easy walk to fun coffee shops, ice cream/restaurants, nightlife, etc; and then there's a bus stop a short walk around the block where one can hop on for an easy ride into downtown. We definitely look forward to staying in touch and visiting with her again soon!"
8053921,46953601,2015-09-14,20029863,Haley,"We were originally a bit hesitant that this Airbnb would be kind of awkward because it's in her living room, our views quickly changed once we saw the place and met our hostess! An impeccable designer and truly welcoming host, Sandy managed to transform the living room into a private, fun, boho style room that felt like we had walked into an Anthropologie store. Stylistic bonuses aside, Sandy is a very fun and helpful host, with pamphlets for local area attractions, maps, bus routes and personal recommendations for great grub and fun pubs. This Airbnb was in a great location, for a great price and had an even greater host. Thank you so much for letting us stay, Sandy! "
8053921,48056179,2015-09-22,44798952,Kevin,"I had a great experience staying with Sandy. She was friendly, very accommodating and super clean! Also, I felt safe and secure throughout my entire stay. Her location is ideal with amenities (supermarket, bus stop and a coffee shop) all within a couple blocks. I would definitely like to stay with Sandy again the next time I'm in Seattle. She is an awesome girl who is extraordinarily artistic and creative. See you next time Sandy!"
8053921,48564213,2015-09-27,42794145,James,"Three of us came to Seattle to attend a 5 day music festival. Sandy was very accommodating and understanding of our irregular schedule. The apartment is in a nice neighborhood within blocks of great restaurants and a bus line. All in all a great experience, thanks!"
8053921,49073646,2015-09-30,44880251,Lydia,"Sandy is such a lovely host! Not only is her place is quiet, clean and in a central location but she had great recommendations for places to eat and took some time to hang out with me in the evening. Overall a great place to stay!! "
8053921,49492030,2015-10-04,42390544,Dawniris,"Great space, great host, great location! Sandy was super-flexible and accommodating when I wanted to add a day and a guest to my reservation. Her canine roommate was very respectful and polite, didn't make a fuss or a mess, and slept in his room most of the day - this may be valuable information to those who don't love dogs as much as I do. Overall, Sandy was great company, with great information on local attractions and transit (she can get you hooked up with the app for Seattle's bus system). "
8053921,50087282,2015-10-09,30967678,Daniel,"Sandy and Dexter were awesome hosts. Easy instructions, good communication, and a mellow place (in a great location!) combined for an excellent stay."
8053921,50333782,2015-10-11,24090997,Jennifer,"Staying at Sandy's apartment in Capital Hill was incredible. Her apartment is extremely spacious and in an awesome location. Despite the fact it was a ""shared room,"" I never felt as though we were in each other's way, and really appreciated the privacy curtain Sandy built in the living room.  This was my first Airbnb , and I really couldn't have asked for a better host or place to stay. Sandy was welcoming and friendly, and gave me some awesome places to check out while in Seattle. Her dog is really sweet and quiet too! 
Thanks for everything, Sandy! "
8053921,51748131,2015-10-24,44440422,Donald,Sandy was a wonderful host! The air mattress was quite comfy and the space was perfect for me to crash after a long day. Shout out to co-host Dexter for being a cool dog!
8053921,52772825,2015-11-01,46866951,Thomas,Sandy was amazing and the rooms were as described. First Airbnb experience and it's been a great moment.
8053921,53148253,2015-11-05,47637716,Anna,"Sandy and Dexter were awesome hosts! Even though you're sleeping In the living room, she has done a great job of making it feel like your own space. She offered refreshments and snacks during my stay and did a great job of making sure I found the place ok. Parking is a bit of a hassle of you get back later in the day, but there is overnight street parking. Sandy herself is awesome and did a wonderful job of making me feel welcome. Highly recommend! "
8053921,53263388,2015-11-07,34934539,Diana,"While I didn't get to meet Sandy (or Dexter! Sad face!) because we left so early in the morning, she made sure that we had clear instructions on getting into the apartment and everything was set up and ready for us. She was just a text away when I had  question and answered promptly. Parking can be a bit tricky but if you have patience or don't mind paying, it's not a big deal. We were able to find a spot only a short walk away. The location is great, easy walk to shops and restaurants. The only downside to the stay was the common areas in the building (NOT Sandy's place itself) had a pretty cloying smell of air freshener/scented candles to it so if you're sensitive to smell, walking in and out of the building can be a bit rough. "
8053921,53897657,2015-11-14,31226405,Yimin,I had a great stay at Sandy's place. It really is quite spacious and located near lots of interesting restaurants and bars. Would definitely recommend for people looking to explore Seattle.
8053921,56238314,2015-12-11,30756216,Alex,"Sandy's place was a great Basecamp for exploring Capitol Hill and Seattle downtown. We were able to easily walk/uber where ever we needed to go and sandy was a great host. She even provided us with some vouchers for the activities we wanted to do. We highly recommend everyone check out the EMP music museum, we had the best time there. "
413733,37395311,2015-07-06,1675636,Carlos,"Ryan and Michele's house was exactly what we were looking for - comfortable, centrally located, and beautifully maintained.  The house is filled with plants and one-of-a kind furniture pieces.  Ryan was extremely helpful and accommodating - even bringing us extra fans to bear an unusual Seattle heatwave in the evenings. I would highly recommend staying here if you want to get a feel for Seattle's true character.  Short walk to Capitol Hill and the water."
413733,38336568,2015-07-14,10922533,Matthew,ryan was a great host - and they have a GREAT space in Seattle. we would definitely stay here again. 
413733,38900762,2015-07-19,36166308,Katie,My husband and I spent the end of our honeymoon in Michele and Ryan's beautiful place.  It was immaculately decorated and very clean.  The location was convenient and amenities were perfect.
413733,39976978,2015-07-27,36650748,Michael,"Michele & Ryan have a great place and are great hosts. The place is lovely, and is super clean and looks exactly like the listing suggests. The neighbourhood seemed pretty quiet and it was only a $10-15 cab ride to/from downtown restaurants and shopping etc.

Ryan was super nice and quick to respond to all my messages before, during, and after my stay. We were much later than we anticipated to check in because of long delays at the boarder and heavy traffic; but Ryan was still super nice about it when we got there. Ryan also bagged a couple of jackets we left behind so we could go pick after we checked out. 

Great place and I would go back there before I check other listings in Seattle for my next trip"
413733,41428398,2015-08-07,32019018,Margaret,"Michele and Ryan's place is awesome! While the pictures clearly represent the space, it's even better in person!

The neighborhood is great and the home feels very safe. Madrona is a wonderful area and you can easily walk to the center of town for coffee, ice cream or Glassybabies. :)  It's a central location, so it's pretty easy to get anywhere in Seattle relatively quickly. 

The decor in the home is both stylish and comfortable. Loved the front yard and stoop. Great for a dog and wonderful place to sit and watch the neighborhood pass by. 

Michele and Ryan were fantastic hosts. They equipped the house with a number of very thoughtful things to help it feel like a home. Ryan was available when I arrived to provide a tour and give me some tips and tricks for the house.  In addition, they were very understanding, patient and kind about my dog, who, unfortunately, experienced some issues during out 10-night stay. It was very warm during my stay and Ryan provided a number of fans. Ryan was very responsive and clear in her communications.

Would love to stay here again and recommend it without reservation. "
413733,41822441,2015-08-09,22898240,Gregory,Ryan made us feel very welcome and was very attentive both prior and during the visit.  The home is very nice and in a quiet neighborhood.  
413733,42752475,2015-08-15,16250122,Bonnie,"Ryan was fast with communication, patient, and extremely considerate as a host. I couldn't believe how clean and beautifully decorated the place was until I arrived; these pictures do not do it justice. My stay was a wonderful experience: from the stocked fridge of wine, beers, and coconut water to the provided Stumptown coffee and parabens-free shampoo and conditioner. Such a comfortable stay - wish I could go back! Madrona is such a hidden gem of a neighborhood!"
413733,43279909,2015-08-18,13360655,Michael,A beautifully decorated home in a quiet neighborhood that is an Uber ride away from major attractions.  No complaints.  
413733,43430621,2015-08-19,37847329,Jason,"This is a fantastic place to stay in Seattle. It's not too far from the central core of the city; maybe a 10-15 minute trek. The place is beautifully decorated and is super clean!

Ryan is a terrific host, very quick to respond. He greeted us as we checked in and gave us a nice little tour of the place."
413733,43999013,2015-08-23,4344045,Anna,"Ryan was very friendly and accommodating. He met my boyfriend and I at check in time, showed us around the house and let us know we were welcome to contact him with any questions or problems. We had a great time and our stay went very smoothly!"
413733,44596546,2015-08-27,21233723,Kristy,What a perfect house and perfect neighborhood! Everything was comfortable and Ryan was great and accommodating. Definitely will stay here again!
413733,45149498,2015-08-31,7284950,Jason,"Lovely, stylish house in east Seattle. Great break from sterile hotel rooms. Took a short while to get the key and get into the place (no secure key storage or anything, so had to wait for hosts) so thankfully it wasn't raining too much! Nearby bars and amenities were perfect. Would definitely recommend!"
413733,45406005,2015-09-02,17784900,Aaron,This was the best Airbnb experience yet in a really well decorated place. It is pretty much a dream home for us in both the style of the place and the size. Was great to be able to experience it. Really was a chill place to stay.
413733,46824142,2015-09-13,3883449,Armin & Regina,"Michele & Ryan's duplex was clean, comfy, and super cute. Ryan met us upon check in and gave helpful recommendations for Madrona and the surrounding areas. We especially enjoyed his recommendation for the shoreline area of Madrona and the Hi Spot Cafe. Parking was easy and right in front of the house - although we ended up walking or taking Uber most of the time. 
The home is full of carefully restored vintage furniture and art and comes with thoughtful amenities - good shampoo, Sumptown coffee, soap, sodas in the mini fridge, and even q-tips :) It was very pleasant and we would stay here again!"
413733,47322966,2015-09-17,7325709,Emily,"My boyfriend and I only got to stay one night at Michele and Ryan's listing, but it was wonderful! The house is absolutely beautiful and in such a great location. We didn't arrive for check-in until late in the evening, but Ryan was great about communicating and was there to great us when we drove in. Would definitely recommend this house and hope to come back again! "
413733,48204713,2015-09-24,24933106,Susan,"Ryan and Michele have a lovely place and we enjoyed staying there. Ryan met us giving us all the details we needed and a warm welcome. Bright, airy, clean and just as advertised we would go back in a heartbeat (and problem will)"
413733,49147682,2015-10-01,22312659,Derek,"The house is quiet, clean, well-appointed and comfortable, with many thoughtfully considered details. Ryan is helpful, accommodating, and responsive. I had a great stay and it's clear the hosts take their guests' happiness seriously. "
413733,49917518,2015-10-07,5463939,Katey,"We visited Seattle for a long weekend and staying at this house was quite a treat, a home away from home. All the details were as pictured and the space was clean and full of interesting trinkets. Ryan was quick to reply to all our inquiries/questions and overall was a great host. The neighborhood was quiet and in walking/Uber distance of many restaurants/coffee houses/bars (if you like hills!). We would absolutely come back to this space. "
413733,50607578,2015-10-12,37497107,Elena,"I loved the attention to detail, from the cozy down comforter and down pillows, to the stylish towels, to the delicious teas, and baby-bel cheeses! The furniture and all the accessories are beautiful. I can't begin to describe how cool each piece was individually, and how good it all looks together. The house is beautifully remodeled. It was clearly a passion project for Ryan and Michele because everything is very tastefully done. I was inspired on so many levels :)))
Ryan was an awesome host. I requested to stay at his Airbnb the day before, and he went out of his way to make it happen. 
I loved the area too. Staying here made me want to look for a house to buy in this area. I highly recommend!!!"
413733,51034417,2015-10-17,4845875,Evan Robert,A very lovely home stocked with everything you could need and more. Ryan met us when we arrived and was very kind and helpful. Highly recommended.

413733,51810448,2015-10-24,4327542,Jennifer & Brad,"Michele & Ryan's home was absolutely lovely! It was like staying at a well-curated home from a magazine. I was traveling for work and brought my partner and dog with me. Ryan & Michele provided delicious Stumptown coffee, breakfast bars and fruit. All of the amenities were high end (hand soap and lotion were designer). 

There's a great fenced front yard for my dog to lay out and the neighborhood was quiet. It's best to have a car if staying here and there's plenty if street parking. Probably one of my favorite Airbnb stays yet! "
413733,52157679,2015-10-26,892066,John,"A perfect stay. 

A lovely house and great neighborhood. Amenities much appreciated. "
413733,53264590,2015-11-07,46238114,Karen,This was my first Airbnb and I couldn't have asked for a better one. Michele & Ryan were great and the house is lovely. A+
413733,53479684,2015-11-09,5308094,Emily,"This reservation started off on a great foot and stayed there.  Ryan met us at their store to hand us the keys (the shop is worth a visit!) and was nice from the start.  The listing is perfect!  The hosts have really beautiful taste; I loved all the decorative touches and truly think it was the best-looking Airbnb listing I've stayed in.  Ryan and Michelle have thought of everything - little touches like an iPhone charger already set up in the bedroom, a fridge full of grown up and N/A beverages, a few breakfast bars, and a well stocked (and gorgeous!) bathroom helped us feel right at home.  Our stay was short, but super comfortable; we slept like babies, enjoyed a lazy night in, and had all the comforts of home.  Great hosts, will definitely keep this place in mind for my next trip up to Seattle."
413733,54207215,2015-11-16,34868269,Erin,"Ryan and Michele were very attentive, and the place was cute, cozy, and in a great location. We will definitely keep this place in mind for future visits."
413733,54635688,2015-11-22,48340075,Kristina,"This was my first time using Airbnb. I was a little nervous because I didn't know what to expect, however I am super happy to report I would do this again in a heartbeat. Ryan was extremely welcoming upon arrival and gave us a tour of the house. We were delighted to find the house was bigger than it appears online. 
The natural light, high ceilings and wonderful decor made us feel like were staying at a blog worthy friend's home. What a treat! Parking was easy and always available which was a plus. Thank you Michele & Ryan for creating such a beautiful and affordable space to stay! We hope to see you again!"
413733,54905553,2015-11-25,94206,Alexa,"We loved staying at Michele & Ryan's house. It's beautiful, warm, and comfortable. The bed was super comfortable! We would definitely stay here again."
413733,55541914,2015-12-01,23267536,Sara,Michele and Ryans place was immaculate and beautifully curated. They were so responsive and the house was centrally located. We loved staying there - would 100% stay again! Can't recommend this place enough. 
413733,56519527,2015-12-14,19248033,Gian And Bek,"Wow, where to begin?! We can't agree enough with all the reviews below us. Ryan and Michele were so kind, helpful, and attentive. They graced us with some cold brews and stumptown coffee during our stay. Everything about their home made our stay feel like our home. Each room had its own character. We highly recommend you to stay here. "
413733,57093574,2015-12-21,21580308,Justin,Michele and Ryan were great hosts. They stayed in contact with me and made sure that my experience went well. As soon as I walked in I was blown away with how nice their location was. It had beautiful natural lighting and felt a lot bigger than it really was.  The entire stay was awesome and I highly recommend staying here!
7748866,42806393,2015-08-15,41152143,Sabine,"Our host met us at the front steps to the house.  She brought the entire family out to introduce us, and explain the room layout.   The location is beautiful, overlooking western Seattle and beyond.  Both Trilby and Willy had many helpful recommendations for how we could spend the next couple of days in the area.  We made the most of their information."
7748866,43004096,2015-08-16,21009240,Lambert (Bert),"It was truly a pleasure to stay in the Cohen home. A very comfortable bed in a private setting. Before getting there I had the misfortune of being in a accident. They were very nice and helped me out quite a bit going above and beyond. I would love to stay there again when traveling in the Seattle area.
"
7748866,44701085,2015-08-28,3608135,Mark,"great room in a quiet neighborhood. lots of privacy, you have the whole downstairs floor to yourself, with your own bathroom. private entrance on back of house directly into the room, really nice for when you arrive home late. Trilby is an excellent host and has put some thought into preparing the place for Airbnb guests. motion sensor lights illuminate the path around the side of the house to your room. the room itself is very spacious and comfortable, you can relax in the bedroom and not feel boxed in. lots of windows and lots of sunlight coming in. i enjoyed staying in the home and felt like a friend of the family."
7748866,45597780,2015-09-04,32442148,John,"We loved staying here. They were the most friendly hosts we've stayed with. We had a long conversation with them and everything we could've possibly needed they were ready to provide. The room was very nice and comfortable, in a great neighborhood, with great views, with plenty of street parking available. In addition, the wifi was excellent, even though there wasn't a TV. "
7748866,46180820,2015-09-08,20734082,Lukia,"Wonderful two day stay at Trilby's beautiful house! Room is exactly the same as the pictures, very comfy bed and reading chair. It was a bit cold because of the rain but thanks to Trilby's extra blankets I had two nights of warm great sleep. Room has private entrance and is separated from other rooms in the house, so you have enough privacy. The house is pretty close to downtown, bus to downtown is just two blocks away, very easy to call Uber. Trilby and her family was very friendly, she greeted me upon arrival and showed me around the room, let me play with her super cute cat, Charlotte, and treated me to muffin and tea in the morning, when her husband kindly introduced me to the fun things in Seattle. Definitely would recommend Trilby's place! "
7748866,47014580,2015-09-14,17987157,Kathy,"We were welcome by the door right after we park our car.  The house looks just like the photos, yet, better.  It's at the lower level but the room is warm and wonderful."
7748866,47230890,2015-09-16,44098724,Richard,"We enjoyed our short stay in Trilby's guest room. It is very clean and as warm as the accompanying photo. There is an adjoining private bathroom and shower, and the neighborhood is pleasant and away from the typical city noises. Trilby and her husband were very cordial and helpful, and I recommend them and their room to anyone who needs a clean and comfortable place to stay in the Seattle area, about 15-20 minutes from downtown."
7748866,47863508,2015-09-21,27449210,Alger,The host is very friendly and willing to share their life experiences. They introduces us the surrounding environment with patience. Their family are also very nice. The room is as described. I recommend to stay at her house! 
7748866,48789585,2015-09-28,11548880,Graham,"All was as Trilby had described it and we were more than happy with our stay
You normally find that hosts go above and beyond of whats expected with Airbnb and Trilby and Willie were no exception.
Thanks very much"
7748866,49357951,2015-10-03,43437373,Ashleigh,Trilby was a wonderful very hospitable host!  The space she offers up is just as pictured and described.  The room was very clean and spacious with plenty of storage for whatever you bring with you.  The bathroom was clean and even though it was small it served our needs just fine.  The shower had plenty of hot water!!  Trilby allows access to her well equipped kitchen (and the rest of the main floor) that is highlighted with a gorgeous view!  We really enjoyed making our morning coffee with such a wonderful view.  We had a wonderful stay at her and her families home and will consider staying again next time we find ourselves in the Seattle area! 
7748866,49700441,2015-10-05,44886115,Elise,"Very nice place, well set up, clean and organized. Friendly hosts and a good location too. Would definitely stay here again."
7748866,51354291,2015-10-19,1592785,Onyia,"Trilby and Willie were fabulous communicators, incredibly kind, and very welcoming.  The space was perfect, cozy, airy, and impeccably clean.  I look forward to returning!"
7748866,52114435,2015-10-26,4567532,Jenn,Beautiful property and fantastic location! We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely be back again if we find ourselves in the area. 
7748866,54185354,2015-11-16,48325658,Caylin,"Willie and Trilby were warm, friendly, and welcoming, and their lovely guest room is truly a retreat, quiet and relaxing, a little oasis to escape to after a busy city adventure. And their garden is spectacular. Their home is also immaculate and had all the right touches, making you feel right at home. I highly recommend this as your next Airbnb when you visit Seattle next, you will be VERY happy."
7748866,54903004,2015-11-25,1592785,Onyia,"This room is perfect!  Its sunny, cozy, clean, and the host family are all kind and welcoming.  This is the first time I've repeated staying at a place because it is just that amazing.  It's quiet yet walking distance from great restaurants, and the reading chair and bed are extremely comfortable.  Thank you!"
7748866,55957226,2015-12-07,34152931,Jennifer,"Trilby and Willie were incredibly welcoming and friendly. The bottom floor of the home was perfect for the weekend. We had plenty of space, our own bathroom, and everything was clean. The bed was super comfortable too!"
6362362,39027061,2015-07-20,34955478,Jj,"Beautifully finished house. Located in a fantastic neighborhood. Super convenient to downtown via the bus stop a few houses down the street. We walked to a delicious bakery in downtown Queen Anne several mornings during our stay. Tracy, the owner, was helpful with local restaurant suggestions and stayed reachable through text and email during our stay. "
7421950,39573394,2015-07-24,17208913,Olli,"Mahtava sijainti! Kaupunki sekä Cap Hill itsessään tekivät todella hyvä vaikutuksen.

Asunto oli siisti ja naapurusto rauhallinen.
"
7421950,39698686,2015-07-25,2555819,New,Adriaan was great! She was patient with our traffic tardiness. Showed us the room and the stuff around.
7421950,39877113,2015-07-26,39199427,Alissa,"this place perfectly suited our needs - great location, easy to get to from the highway, easy to get to downtown, free street parking (which was unlimited because we were visiting on sunday). easy to get ahold of host and everything was all set up, worked out great! might be a tight fit for six people, we were four and it worked out well. "
7421950,40275272,2015-07-29,31500291,현덕(Hyunduk),"Hi~! Adriaan.
I have stayed your house very comfortable with my family.
As you recommanded the museum of flight, my family had a lovely time in the place, especially my son loved many flights.
I can't say any my words how I had feelings in your house.
In USA, your house is the another my house.
If I will travel Seattle one more time, I want to stay your house one more. Especially, Thanks your the parking card for visiting.
Did you find the thanks card of my family?
See you again~!"
7421950,40989012,2015-08-03,26315259,Anita,The place was exactly what we expected and then some! It's located perfectly near all the trendy bars and restaurants. The place was perfect for the two of us with plenty of privacy. I would def recommend for others to stay!!!
7421950,41157487,2015-08-04,39492908,Jimmy,"Adriaan was quite accommodating in letting us drop off our bags early so we could explore the city luggage free and the apartment was ready for us when we arrived back after our long day.  The space was very efficiently arranged, it felt very cozy and relaxing.  We only had a short conversation with Adriaan in person but she was very friendly and overall we had an enjoyable stay.    "
7421950,41514678,2015-08-07,22445941,Eliot,Although Adriaan couldn't be there to meet us she left all the relevant information and items we'd need out where we could find them. We had a relaxed and pleasant stay in a clean and tidy apartment. The proximity to a brew-pub was handy.
7421950,42307841,2015-08-12,7500978,Shankar,"The apartment was just lovely and the location was wonderful. Close to almost everything one could think of including some of the finest cafes and restaurants in Seattle. I think I basically overdosed on coffee and Molly Moon ice cream in the 4 days I spent there! Adriaan was super helpful and nice and gave great suggestions regarding cafes as well as bookstores. The apartment was exactly as described in the pictures, clean, modern with everything one needs for a short stay. Perfect for a couple getaway in Seattle.  I can't come back to visit!"
7421950,42641888,2015-08-14,16099820,Ethan,"Adriaan was extremely responsive and helpful. Her place is in a great location, with tons of fun places within a short walk. I stayed one night, and it met my needs perfectly. "
7421950,42907068,2015-08-16,27747090,Art,Adriaan was very nice and had everything ready for our arrival.  Location was perfect for where we wanted to be at a great price!  Thank you Adriann!
7421950,43195782,2015-08-17,12406060,Mackenzie,"The listing was in a perfect location -- very central to lots of great things in Seattle. It was very comfortable and cozy also. 

Adriaan wasn't great about communicating with us. When I asked how to get into the apartment the morning of the day that we were supposed to arrive, she took 4 hours to respond. When she did respond, she tried to delay our check in time by 3 hours even though it was only an hour before our original, agreed upon checkin time. 

I would still recommend this place, just be sure to confirm all of the details! "
7421950,43318658,2015-08-18,38307408,David,A good location and many places to eat/things to do nearby! Adriaan   and was quick with her response time and made it super easy with the key drop. 
7421950,43330736,2015-08-18,38620120,Chih-Wei,The host canceled this reservation 38 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7421950,43331571,2015-08-18,3414488,Suraya,The host canceled this reservation 18 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7421950,43466309,2015-08-19,917504,Reda,"The room was exactly what I needed, and in a great location. Moving in & checking out was a breeze -- Adriaan was very flexible with my schedule."
7421950,44572105,2015-08-27,453367,Howie,Apartment was in a good location.  Small but functional for a short stay.
7421950,45109246,2015-08-31,24084926,Jordan,"Points taken due to first experience of the host not answering the phone for hours when we were searching for the apartment and its key. The apartment was fine, accurate to the description and clean. I'd prefer a hotel room, as the price is close and the hotel comes with amenities and less hassle. Parking is a pain. The wifi didn't work. The location is solid though. Loved the area, great places for a drink or coffee. If you don't mind walking a little, you can get to downtown easily too."
5040885,44030556,2015-08-23,548179,Duncan,This house is both charming and practical as well as in a great neighborhood. We were lucky with the weather and so we made good use of the deck on a couple of occasions. It is a real oasis and it was great to escape the hurly burly of a downtown conference and chill out. Checking in and checking out was very straightforward and Jessica was very responsive and helpful throughout.
5040885,48404863,2015-09-26,7130361,Amy,"Jessica's home is the epitome of charm in Capitol Hill, a quick trip to Pike's Place Market and downtown.  It is ideally situated on a beautiful, quiet street a few blocks from trendy restaurants, cafes, and unique shops.  It is also simple to take a number of buses into downtown, or you can walk should the mood strike.

The home itself is well-appointed with a touch of whimsy.  From the welcoming garden and cafe-lit deck, to the inviting dining room table with a bottle of wine, to the spacious, comfortable bedrooms- everything in this house makes you want to return time and time again.

Jessica's instructions were fantastic and made our trip stress free.  We would stay here again (and are planning to do so) without a second thought."
5040885,49156055,2015-10-01,4376949,Liz,"Everything was perfect! Clean and comfortable, we felt completely at home in Jessica's place. She made sure to always be available if we had any questions and left us a sweet note and bottle of wine to welcome us. She had the perfect recommendations on restaurants and sites to visit. She helped make our visit to Seattle much more than it would have been if we'd chosen some stuffy hotel. "
8799588,54553722,2015-11-21,7485789,Julian,"This is a nice place! The neighborhood is really unique, with lots of trees and neat alleyways. The house it very quiet at night, the room is relaxing, nicely decorated, extremely clean, and it is super convenient having the second full bathroom, considering only two people live in the house permanently (I think). Your hosts are very nice also. There are bus routes in every direction. I will definitely be staying here again. "
1200083,9568673,2014-01-02,9647924,Gloria,"Checking in and out could not have been smoother or faster. I wanted to extend my stay an extra night the morning I was supposed to check out, and even got another of his properties booked *and* checked into before checkout time!

The place was clean, staff was friendly, and the amenities were phenomenal. I'll be back in Seattle on business in the very near future, and I can tell you already that I'll be staying with Stay Alfred rentals (aka, Jordan's company.)"
1200083,10338943,2014-02-14,11585593,Margaux,Excellent flat. We have spent a great travel !!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks Jordan 
1200083,25990857,2015-02-01,18061679,Raymond,"Harbor Steps was perfect for my visit to Seattle. The location is perfect--close to: Benaroya Hall, my main point of interest, the waterfront, shopping and dining, Pike Place Market, LINK light rail University Station, countless bus lines, and within walking distance of Westlake Center, Pacific Place and many places nearby. The apartment itself was roomy and comfy with all the amenities and comforts I needed--fully equipped kitchen, huge bathroom, king-size bed (half of which I used for laying out my suitcase), and free wi-fi. A bonus was the complex of fitness centers and pools in three towers (SE, SW, and NE Towers). The only thing that concerned me was the initial reservation process in which the apartment I paid for when I booked was pulled off airbnb because the posted price was not correct; I ended up paying almost $460 extra over 10 nights at a higher room rate. Airbnb should have honored the originally advertised price which I prepaid. Although probably not intentional, it was like a ""switch and bait."" Next time, I will be extra careful when booking with airbnb--but unfortunately, airbnb booking requires prepayment before confirmation of a reservation request. I will also be more careful when shopping for rooms. 

It would be great--although unlikely--if airbnb or the host refunded me for the additional room rate paid, or even split the difference. The additional amount I paid added up to a lot over 10 nights--about one-third more!"
1200083,28322421,2015-03-22,20899885,Max,"Great overall stay. The apartment is as advertised, and the location is very central."
1200083,29563605,2015-04-09,19785015,Luke,"Was a very seamless experience, place was great and located in walking distance Seattle's downtown amenities.  Jordan was responsive at all hours and did a great job helping us transition between rooms over the course of our stay.  Would stay again.
  "
1200083,30515308,2015-04-23,30320958,Baker,Everything ran smoothly.  I had a hiccup renting the room through AirBnb and Jordan was very accommodating to find me another unit in the same building complex that met my needs.  Check-in/Check-out very smooth.  Building is great.  Wish I could have spent more time there.  
1200083,33305320,2015-05-26,31375204,Mike,"The Harbor Steps location is great and is within walking distance of so many Seattle attractions. There were four of us staying in the apartment and it was a little tight but definitely more spacious then if we had stayed in a hotel. Our overall experience was kind of hotel-like as there was not any interaction with our host and the apartment was ""commercially"" furnished. Definitely not a negative, just something to note for those looking to book. "
1200083,35319429,2015-06-17,3168705,Brittany,"This stay was a bit more corporate than most of my AirBnb stays. I felt much more like a number, but sometimes without the conveniences that usually provides (can't utilize hotel front desk, etc.) Nevertheless, the place was perfectly sized (spacious & open, yet cozy), clean, relaxing, incredibly centrally located, and fairly quiet. There is a low constant hum from the traffic, but I found the garden/courtyard outside the windows very peaceful. 
Overall, I was very happy with this stay once I got the hang of the app and phone number that is used for all communication (check-in, questions, etc.) Read: No face-to-face interaction period. In hindsight, the app and phone number to call at any time are very useful. Now that I've got the hang of the concept, I wouldn't mind using this format again on subsequent visits. It just took some getting used to, and a reorientation of expectations. The company, StayAlfred, does do a great job of alerting you to the fact that this stay will be different than normal, and they even give you a call a few days before your visit to see if you have any questions they can help answer."
1200083,35912744,2015-06-23,29657173,Vicki,"It seems as if once I understood the system, if all went smoothly. The concierge had our packet with the keys all ready ( I had some anxiety about all the instructions and process). I called the host number several times and each time, the person on the other end of phone was very friendly and helpful.
The layout of the building seemed confusing at first but we come from a very small rural town  , but we found pro old in the building were very friendly.
I was pleased with the location. I felt like we were right in center of great stores, close to the pier, aquarium, Pikes Market,  although it was very crowded.   
Tha apartment itself was pretty much what I expected from the ad. It was well equipped and had all the supplies we could need. "
1200083,49907331,2015-10-07,43300669,Kane,"Was a very seamless experience, place was great and located in walking distance Seattle's downtown amenities. Jordan was contactable at any time and very responsive.  Would stay again."
8829474,51234448,2015-10-18,43428237,Terry,"Daniela went above and beyond to make me feel welcome and comfortable. She recommended more than enough restaurants nearby to try out the local food and craft beer.

The photos of the apartment are very accurate and I was very pleased with the amenities. The washer and dryer as well as the dishwasher were a surprise for me. I selected Daniela's listing for her reputation and the photo of the Space Needle. That view did not disappoint. Unwinding in the evening I looked out over the harbor and city lights and felt right at home.

One of the things I liked most about this apartment was the neighborhood. I was only a 10 minute walk from Pike Place Market and less than that from the Space Needle. There were plenty of opportunities to enjoy Seattle with depending on a car or even public transportation.

I would recommend Daniela and this apartment to anyone considering Seattle as a vacation destination; you will not be disappointed."
8829474,51980984,2015-10-25,29840320,Tina,"It was pleasant, refreshing. The space was clean and true to its pictures posted. Location was perfect. View was amazing. Host was great. Daniela is a definitely is an amazing host and earned her title as a super host! Love it and will definitely recommend her and this space to anyone visiting Seattle!"
251922,701356,2011-11-07,663829,B&E,"We stayed for a couple days with Edwin and it was a great stay. Two thumbs up for Edwin, he was very well prepared for our arrival and we got more than we bargained for. His cozy and welcoming place is located in a great area of West Seattle, walking distance to shops, nice restaurants and a mind blowing Bakery (Bakery Nouveau).  Edwin was extremely polite and really cool too. Hands down, I will highly recommend you to stay in his place if you are heading to Seattle. "
251922,928898,2012-02-18,98532,Laura And Peter,"My sister, husband and I, our two neices and two children (ranging in age from 7 months to 5 years old) stayed at Edwin's.  Our stay was perfect.  The home is so comfortable and we had everything we needed.   You would never know someone lived downstairs.  Complete privacy and easy access to W. Seattle Bridge/downtown...and close to lovely Alki Beach.   We were in town for our father's funeral and our small children had a wonderful space to play and relax...Edwin is extremely nice and accomodating.  hope we have the chance to stay with him again."
251922,960118,2012-02-29,350748,An,"We had a wonderful stay at Edwin's. It was a home away from home, complete with a separate entrance. The location was very convenient being close to Alki Beach and California Ave. With our week-long stay, Edwin made sure to check in on us to make sure we had everything we needed. This is a great place to stay whether you are visiting downtown Seattle or West Seattle!"
251922,1189976,2012-04-28,1568731,Annette,"We travelled to Seattle - our very first trip to US - and I liked the look of Ed's photos on Airbnb,and in my emails with Ed he was prompt and very helpful. And I can say that the accommodations,though a little smaller than I initially expected,werejust right!  And as Ed promised the buses were nor more than 2 mins up the road and they ran to the city and in the other direction to Alaskan Junction - shops and restaurants,and and only 2 blocks away was California and admiral. Vey handy and convenient. Ed was away when we were there last week but his sister Therese was there and she was a lovely. The house was Compact and tidy with a well equipped kitchen. Everything you needed. We felt very much at home when we were a long way from home. 
"
251922,1245829,2012-05-08,931924,Diane,We had a wonderful stay in this cozy home.  Ediwn was a great host and we hope to stay again sometime.
251922,1453783,2012-06-11,1730433,Paul,"Very pleasant, quiet but close to grocery stores.  Well equiped kitchen that allowed food preperation and thereby avoided the need to eat in restaurants.  
Host was very helpful and well informed about Seattle."
251922,1516972,2012-06-19,133432,Lisa,"The West Seattle neighborhood is great. It is friendly and quiet but you are very close to shopping and dining. The house is cozy, comfortable and very clean. The kitchen is very well equipped if unlike to cook. Ed was always available to answer questions.  I would definitely stay here again."
251922,1624353,2012-07-03,2301366,Todd,Edwin was a superb host!! Thanks for everything! You made our moving transition to Seattle that much sweeter! North Admiral is amongst our top fav spots of West Seattle!
251922,1846911,2012-07-31,1298612,Alexandra,"Spent a month at Edwin's house, it was a great location, Edwin & his dogs are very friendly, he is always available to answer questions,  well equiped kitchen, large deck out back, hope to be back next year. Alexandra"
251922,1966201,2012-08-13,760840,Bruno,"Ed's house is located in a very nice and quiet neighborhood!  My girlfriend and I really enjoyed our stay and had excellent nights of sleep in the comfortable beds.

The place is easy to find and located within a short drive of plenty of places to eat and shop and a short drive to downtown and all the must-see Seattle spots."
251922,2037813,2012-08-20,2520978,Laura,"My husband and three friends were in Seattle for 5 days for a wedding, and this rental was absolutely perfect for us. The beds were very comfortable, there were ample towels, and the kitchen had everything we needed. Also, access to central Seattle was really easy - it took about 15 minutes to get into town, and 15-20 minutes to get to the airport. I definitely recommend it!"
251922,2087566,2012-08-25,1790941,Katie,"Ed's house was clean and cozy.  We loved the quiet neighborhood and the fact that it was only about a fifteen minute drive to downtown.   After being out all day at the Seattle market and other places, it was really nice to return to a place that felt like home.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat.  Thank you, Ed, for a wonderful stay!"
251922,2125026,2012-08-28,2930625,Joy,"The house in North Admiral was the perfect stay while in Seattle. The location was close enough to the city and far enough for peace and quiet. The house was very clean and beds comfortable. I really liked the coffee and creamer that was ready to use in the morning. Thanks Edwin! It was fun to walk down to the beach and check out the beach scene. There are lots of restaurants, cafes and bars. Portus and Tubby (Edwin's dogs) were the cutest. We will most definitely return next summer."
251922,2177790,2012-09-03,2819655,Alan,We had a great stay. Edwin was there when we arrived to show us around. The place was comfortable and it was easy to access downtown via transit or water taxi. 
251922,2278734,2012-09-14,1941254,Anne,"Very clean, very quiet place.  The stain glass lamps were outstanding.  Host was very kind."
251922,2418412,2012-09-26,1710642,Venny,"Edwin, was a very good host!  The place was very clean, the neighborhood was quiet and within a relatively short distance from most main attractions in the city (10-15 minutes driving).  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle!"
251922,2886079,2012-11-15,3725614,Kathy,"My companion and I spent an extremely cozy and stress-free time at Edwin's accommodations.  Both queen beds are extremely comfortable.  The living room is well appointed with entertainment and the provided wi-fi is very responsive.

During our four day stay we opted to dine out rather than cook and eat in.  The modern and well appointed kitchen would have made shopping at the nearby market and eating in a breeze, had we chose to do so.  We did enjoy the tea & coffee Ed provided to get our day started.  

There are very good restaurants just blocks from Edwin's home, on California Ave.  If you like German fare & brews, Prost is an excellent venue.  Circa has a more home-style menu, with choices to entice your entire group, from seafood and steak to sandwiches and appetizers.  We were too busy to make it down to Duke's on Alki.  Maybe next trip.

Ed's home is very private.  A little slice of heaven, yet so close to the core of Seattle that getting to events via car or mass transit is a breeze.  Edwin is an excellent, thoughtful host.  You can't go wrong booking here for your Seattle entertainment stay.

Kathy & Colin"
251922,2951275,2012-11-24,3362339,Ted,"Clean house, very comfortable.  We were very happy with the place."
251922,3458559,2013-02-02,228688,Kate,Moving back to Seattle and didn't want to stay in a hotel while we looked for an apartment. This was a perfect solution. All the amenities and home comforts you could hope for. Great location for a West Seattle base. Edwin is a super nice guy too. Highly recommended!
251922,4467748,2013-05-06,6211532,Gareth,"We really enjoyed our stay at Edwin's place, nice big place with a great patio. Good part of west seattle."
251922,6041414,2013-07-28,1425543,Lisa,"Edwin was a very thoughtful and accommodating host and was always available in case we needed anything! I would definitely recommend this location to anyone- it is a very fast walk to the beach, grocery store and nice restaurants. There is a free shuttle that will take you to a boat to downtown Seattle- you'll be there in about 20 minutes! During the summer, there is always something happening in West Seattle: street fairs, artwalks, farmer's market. This area is very safe and we did not have any concerns. Thanks Edwin, for a great stay!"
251922,6217038,2013-08-04,6745742,Cecelia,Ed is a great host.  The house is very nice inside and fully equipped with everything required for a stay.  The area is quiet and West Seattle is a great neighborhood.  The house is easy to find and has good access to the main streets.  I'd definately stay there again!
251922,6289898,2013-08-06,7120039,Derek,"Edwin's place was great! It is in a quiet neighbourhood in West Seattle close to restaurants and bars and an easy walk/bus ride down to Alki Beach where you can take a water taxi down to Pikes. 

Edwin was very nice and the house is very private. "
251922,6320702,2013-08-08,6449870,Christine,"We loved our short time at Edwin's place. We were very pleased with the cleanliness and spaciousness of the home and the comfort it provided.  Ed was a gracious host, explaining everything to us and then allowing us our own privacy.

The location was excellent for exploring downtown.  We simply drove a short distance to the water taxi that conveyed us across to beautiful Seattle and within minutes we were enjoying the waterfront and Pike Place Market.  If you prefer, there is a free shuttle from near Ed's home which will take you to the water taxi.  Just make sure you have the correct amount of cash for the water taxi as no change is given and the self-serve ticket machine near the cafe is not the easiest to use. 

If we ever have the opportunity to go to Seattle again, Ed's place would be our first choice of places to stay.  "
251922,6690387,2013-08-21,7555233,Eric,"Me and my family had a fantastic time visiting Seattle. Edwin's place was clean, comfortable, and located minutes away from Downtown Seattle. There was a Safeway conveniently located a couple of minutes down the road and we made use of his kitchen to cook breakfast every morning allowing us to save some money. 

If you decide to stay there, definitely do not miss the opportunity to meet his pet Bulldog!"
251922,6784582,2013-08-25,6792543,Nina,"Ed's home is spacious, clean, and stocked with everything you need for an extended stay.  The two large bedrooms make it a particularly great value for large groups. Ed is always available to answer questions, and was very accommodating about allowing me to receive a package mailed to the house before we even arrived. A great stay!"
251922,6954712,2013-09-01,6106065,Donna,"Very comfortable house, great location in West Seattle (car would be best unless you're very fit), host Edwin very friendly and hospitable. We would like to return some day."
251922,7068509,2013-09-05,3550356,Jeanette,"We have used Airbnb before in West Seattle and had a great stay.
This time the stay was even better.  The location suited our needs to a ""T"".  It is less than a mile to our son's home.

It was very clean and comfortable.  There were very soft towels in the bathroom.  It had a full kitchen

We would like to stay here again.
Jeanette and Tony"
251922,7240991,2013-09-13,1390425,Willow,"Love Edwin's Sleepy North Admiral home. Lived in North Admiral when we lived in Seattle. Moved away, but came back for a wedding. Stayed in Edwin's place for a week and were able to pretend we still lived there. A great house in a wonderful location."
251922,7559181,2013-09-24,3351402,Mandy,"Was perfect for my father/daughter weekend in Seattle! West Seattle was charming and quiet, and downtown Seattle was a quick trip over the bridge. We went back and forth between downtown and West Seattle quite a bit and its really easy. The living room is also great - comfy plushy couches that are inviting. Beds were comfy - slept great, there was coffee, place was clean. Edwin also came up on our first day and introduced himself and asked if we needed anything - great stay. (-= "
251922,7811618,2013-10-04,1823088,Gregory,"Private Roomy full 2 bedroom accommodation - Big +++

Good value , very clean , quiet and safe area 
with plenty of parking.

Kitchen with all utensils allows you to prepare meals - great supermarkets nearby are another huge plus with this location.

Ed runs this operation smooth and professionally , very responsive to emails and a gentlemen to speak with in person. 

Basically you can stop your search here and just book it."
251922,8140219,2013-10-17,7230912,Armen,"We had a fantastic stay at Edwin's.  Really enjoyed staying in West Seattle, parts of it felt as if we were in complete wilderness (Lincoln Park) and other parts were fun and delicious (Junction (Nouveau, Shoofly, Ma'Ono, Beer Junction, Swinery are all fantastic).  Stunning views from the coast wrapped around almost 270 degrees.  Yet, the city was only a quick drive away and the water taxi is a great option.  

Edwin's place was comfortable and he thoughtfully considered everything people need to have while traveling.  The paintings Edwin decided to share with guests are fantastic.  I especially enjoyed the moods of his portraits.

This place would be a wise choice for anyone looking to avoid hustle and bustle while being close by. "
251922,9005952,2013-12-01,8695867,Jeff,"Great stay, very cozy and well appointed. Love West Seattle. The views a previous reviewer spoke of we're not from the home though, so don't expect a view from here, but a perfectly nice place none the less. "
251922,9169974,2013-12-10,1175789,Alvin,"Lovely home and neighborhood. The space is warm and comfortable. I made use of the kitchen and it was well stocked for cooking. The location is great, you can make it to downtown Seattle in 15 mins easily. I did not get to meet Edwin in person, but he was personable over e-mail and I appreciated the privacy. I would recommend this for other users. "
251922,9384574,2013-12-25,9464402,Vinnie,"Very nice place, cozy and clean. It has all the stuff for living there, whole kitchen, bathroom, Television and DvDs. and the owner Edwin is well arranged all the things for more convenient to use. I didnt get a chance to meet him, but i saw lots of his paintings decorated on the wall. "
251922,9546001,2014-01-02,7991578,Ralph,"We had a delightful time staying with Ed Lebel and his bulldog Portis.  The house was neat, clean, and comfy.  We were centrally located and were pleasantly surprised by how close everything was from the waterfront to the Space Needle to the Museum of Flight.  Ed had put out some treats and coffee for us which came in handy when we left on our morning treks around the city."
251922,10005850,2014-01-25,10241958,John,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Sleepy North Admiral, comfortable and quiet surroundings.  An excellent location for quick access to Seattle.  Ed was a very accommodating host, couldn't have felt more welcomed.  We look forward to staying again at Sleepy North Admiral on our next trip to Seattle.  Thank you,  "
251922,10087605,2014-01-29,11158979,Saad,"Recently stayed there. Very unpleasant experience. Edwin lives downstairs, and the very first day we got here, I was at work and Edwin, without talking to me or asking to meet just knocked at the door when my wife was all alone. She just got out of the bed and wasn't dressed up properly, yet at the door Edwin just asked to come in and once he was in, he just wanted to go all around the house to check on things for no apparent reason. My wife got so uncomfortable that we initially made the booking for 5 nights, but the moment I got back from work, I booked a hotel and left the same night. If you are planning to stay here, expect to have no privacy. He can barge in at any time, unannounced! I have a small baby less than 2, and before booking I told Edwin about her. Also his listing states its a kid friendly house, yet he has expensive and fragile glass and crystal lamps and decoration all around the house. I tried to move everything away from my kids reach but she tripped over a lamp wire and the lampshade got a small crack. I talked to Edwin on the phone and told him right away, and I agreed to pay for the fix. Yet his attitude was so rude. It seemed he is just concerned about the house. Not even once did he ask me if the kid was hurt or anything. He has charged me the whole $250 security deposit for the repair and according to him, its going to cost airbnb even more just to fix the lampshade...
I googled the type and size of lamps he has, and I couldn't find any  more than $180."
251922,10280736,2014-02-10,4000182,Julie Ann,"Excellent location!  Close to downtown! Easy couple of blocks to walk to grocery stores and shops. Very clean house, quiet, cozy, and comfortable! Edwin is very helpful. Fantastic stay and I will for sure stay again the next time I am in Seattle!!"
251922,10573169,2014-02-25,11838409,Travis,A very comfortable home with every thing we needed. Great location for our needs.  Easy parking and very cozy inside. Neighborhood felt safe and quiet and our host was very generous providing us with coffee and tea. 
251922,10713666,2014-03-04,2223220,Kathleen,"We were very impressed with Edwin's home.  It was comfortable and nicely appointed.  Edwin was the perfect host, introducing himself and asking if we needed anything.  He was kind enough to leave us some ""goodies"" that we definitely enjoyed.  We also enjoyed Edwin's artwork.  The house is close enough to stores and restaurants, nicely located."
251922,10893453,2014-03-11,3782739,Raymond,Ed is a really good guy which is very patient.
251922,11052264,2014-03-18,12123868,Judi,"The house was very comfortable, with a nice kitchen and amenities.  The two bedrooms were  lovely with plenty of blankets.  The bathroom had an abundance of towels.   All this made our stay most enjoyable.   I would definetly return.  "
251922,11935328,2014-04-19,380292,Jeannie,"My friend and I enjoyed a two-night stay at Edwin's house.  We like the West Seattle location.  The home is settled into a nice residential neighborhood, not far from Alki Beach.  This part of Seattle is so much better than Seattle itself.  It doesn't have the parking and traffic headaches, and there are plenty of good restaurants and coffee shops around.  We did, however, drive into Seattle and was surprised the drive only took around 15 minutes.  Edwin's home was cozy and warm.  The living room was a nice place to unwind after a long day.  I appreciated Edwin had coffee available to help us get going in the morning.  We didn't actually meet Edwin, which wasn't a problem because we didn't need anything since he had already communicated the instructions we'd need for our stay.  "
251922,12556261,2014-05-05,8850033,Linda,"The house is in a very quiet residential neighborhood. We had everything we needed, and Ed was very responsive when I asked about the code for the front door, which I had forgotten to bring with me. The wireless worked well, and I was glad the heat worked because the weather turned cold before we left. We had a car and visited family in the neighborhood, so didn't check out public transportation. It is an easy drive to Admiral Junction and Alki Beach. Parking was always available."
251922,12948483,2014-05-15,13576707,Craig,Great location close to beach and local shops. Quiet and comfortable.  Edwin was very helpful.
251922,13287721,2014-05-24,15276444,Chenqu,"That was a nice trip in Seattle. We lived in this comfortable place with all nececities of live in the house. We made a substantial breakfast everyday visited downtown Seattle in the daytime and went back at night, staying in this warm house. We love there so much. "
251922,13359265,2014-05-26,3710173,Deborah,"We shared the house with another couple and there was plenty of space for the 4 of us. Nice and quiet at night.  A little hard to find a night, as we came in very late and the street was very dark.  We were there very little during the day, as we spent most of our time at Folk Life. 
"
251922,13626713,2014-06-01,15498346,Roman,"Edwin's place is a gem! We spent 4 wonderful nights there. The house is very clean and cozy. Location is great - quiet neighborhood with several restaurants nearby, and the downtown is only 15 minutes drive away! Edwin is a great host, he even brought us some coffee, which was really nice. I would definitely recommend Edwin's house to everyone looking for a quiet, yet conveniently located place to stay in Seattle area."

Quiet neighborhood.  Ed was an excellant host.  Everything you could want is provided with some special touches thrown in.  The house was immaculate and comfortable.  Easy access to Alki, downtown and the airport without having to live in the middle of the hustle and bustle.  Highly recommended."
251922,14391756,2014-06-18,3550356,Jeanette,We have stayed here before and it is like coming home to a home away from home.
251922,14606690,2014-06-23,2259011,Lenora,"Had a great stay at Edwin's place.  We used to live in this neighborhood, and were so happy to be back and feel like we lived there again!  Easy walk down to the beach, or up to Admiral for shopping and restaurants.  The house was just perfect for the two of us.  Beds were comfy and the place was spotless.  Highly recommend for a stay in Seattle."
251922,14795686,2014-06-26,16676389,Karen,"Edwin was a pleasure to work with; he was prompt and thorough in his communications.  We were pleasantly surprised to find everything as it appeared in the listing and Edwin even left coffee and nice snacks.  We met Edwin and his adorable bulldog on the day of our arrival but saw very little of him for the remainder of our stay. 
The location of his listing in West Seattle was convenient to lots of shopping and good local restaurants as well as a very nice beach.  Getting into downtown Seattle was easy and direct, the drive took only about 15 minutes.  "
251922,14851413,2014-06-28,2667290,Kye-Seong,"Had a great stay. Comfort and wonderful home.

251922,15627289,2014-07-13,15398495,Amber,"My friends and I had a wonderful stay at Edwin's home last week (July 8-12). We received exactly what was said would be provided, everything was clean and the neighborhood was nice and quiet. We had an easy time getting to downtown Seattle and enjoyed the tranquility and charm that West Seattle had to offer. It was great to be able to walk to the grocery store to buy our breakfast items, Safeway was only a 10 minute walk away! We especially enjoyed the spacious patio as Seattle was quite warm when we visited. We were able to meet Edwin when we first arrived and we was welcoming and friendly. As stated in other reviews, Edwin's art is displayed around the house. He is a very talented artist and we enjoyed seeing his work!"
251922,15833847,2014-07-16,17083542,Benjamin,"Sleepy North Admiral proved to be a welcome respite from the bustle of Seattle with a cozy and functional home in a great area! We were impressed by the quiet neighborhood, wonderful art, and extensive library of fascinating books. Edwin was very helpful when we had questions and thought of all the details to make our stay comfortable. Good coffee and tea in the kitchen and cream in the 'fridge when we arrived really made our day. This was a really great first experience with airbnb."
251922,18935543,2014-09-03,12916667,Fahad,"I stayed in this house with my family for about 2 months. It was nice and clean. Mr Edwin provided everything we needed during our stay. The location was great in a quiet neighborhood near shops and supermarket. We were happy to stay there and we will definitely consider it in our next visit to Seattle.

"
251922,19080574,2014-09-06,14421587,Dave,Had a Great Stay thanks Edwin. Was just what we needed after long flight and a few days in Seattle. Was great for 2 couples with the 2 bedrooms and plenty of room to catch up and chat . Our friends who were US locals thought it was a great concept. Nice Quiet neighbourhood and close to supermarket. Very clean and tidy. WiFi was great.
251922,19267598,2014-09-09,868275,James,"Edwin is a successful artist and excellent host. The residence is very comfortable and has all the comforts of home. We really enjoyed staying in West Seattle because of its peaceful neighborhood and easy access to shopping,  excellent restaurants, hiking opportunities, and a great beach which affords a great view of Seattle. 
We have stayed in Seattle before but prefer West Seattle as a base of operation. We would definitely stay at Edwin's again "
251922,19928114,2014-09-21,6453381,Patricia,"Edwin's house was very cozy for a few days. It is in a quiet area, but close to shops and restaurants as well as the beach. Getting to downtown was easy on either the bus or water taxi."
251922,20242171,2014-09-26,20582416,Wendy,"The house was very clean and comfortable, and had everything we needed. Edwin was a great host, though we rarely saw him.  We felt like we were coming home every day. The neighborhood is charming and easy to find your way around. Restaurants and shopping are right up the street, and the bus route is easy to figure out. The people of Seattle made everything all come together. We will definitely be back. Thanks again.... "
251922,20471816,2014-09-29,2722652,David,"Edwin did a great job of providing check-in information and made us feel comfortable. The street is very quiet and gets cool ocean air in the morning. The place is comfortable and clean with well-preserved furnishings. The kitchen is stocked and convenient. The single bath is small but functional and the beds are very soft and comfy. We slept great! Put this on your list if you'd like to check out West Seattle with a minimum of hassle.

251922,20652697,2014-10-03,20497337,Angela,"It was our really first stay at airbnb and we were greatly impressed. It was absolutely a good stay. We have everything available, from kitchen ware to seasonings. The neighborhood is quite and safe, not a long drive from the downtown where beautiful scenery amazed us at dusk. Edwin is really nice. We were not able to meet him in the first two days, but in the morning of our departure, he met us with his cute dog Angel."

251922,21598641,2014-10-20,5611376,Vivian,The house was comfortable and quiet and had all possible amenities.  After our disaster in NYC this was an incredibly welcome experience.  Towels and sheets were numerous and comfortable.  Power bars and coffee and tea available. Close proximity to airport and everywhere else we were going. Everything was clean. Couldn't ask for anything better. 
251922,22014973,2014-10-28,1357436,Pauline,"Great communication, making sure I had all I needed.  Instructions for everything were clear and simple.  Very quiet and homey, with a ton of privacy, and parking was always available right by the door.  Close to everything including transportation, groceries, etc.  Bed was very comfortable.  Unfortunately Edwin was unable to change the rainy weather so I could not enjoy the enormous back deck."
251922,22354797,2014-11-04,3550356,Jeanette,"As always this house is our home away from home.

251922,22481827,2014-11-07,22491290,Karla,Edwin was quick to respond and made our stay comfortable and easy. The house was cozy with little extras all over! I was pleased with how homey and adorable the decor was. Edwin even came to say goodbye to us. I highly recommend staying here!

251922,22855775,2014-11-16,8413572,Janice,We were pleasantly surprised at the size of the house. It was a lot larger than we thought it would be. The house was clean and worked well for our business trip in Seattle. The neighborhood was quiet and a nice area for a walk. A nice touch was that there were fresh flowers in the living room. Also the kitchen was great with nice touches like a water filter and a new refrigerator. The coffee and snack bars were very much appreciated. Thank you Edwin for a nice stay.
251922,23357992,2014-11-30,20180754,Lawrence,"We had a most enjoyable stay at Sleepy North Admiral in West Seattle.  The neighborhood is terrific, with shops and wonderful Metropolitan Market a short walk away.  Although the weather got quite cold (below freezing and snow) the rooms stayed warm.  Loved our stay and wouldn't hesitate to return"

251922,24012228,2014-12-16,24594833,Scott,Ed's place is an ideal retreat. It is comfortable and inviting. In the week I spent at the house I was able to accomplish the things that I needed to do while at the same time being close enough to downtown Seattle to do a bit of sight seeing and engage in other tourist activities. I will definitely consider staying here next time I'm in the vicinity. 
251922,24465697,2014-12-29,1168658,Jillian,"This stay was so cozy and delightful.  Great location, centrally located and would stay here again for sure.  Very clean and relaxing."
251922,24762867,2015-01-02,24549470,Melissa,"Our stay here was great! The host was very responsive prior to our arrival and helped make the process very easy, since it was my first time using AirBnB. Location was perfect! The neighborhood was quiet, a few minutes drive from the grocery store and many more! It was also a very short drive to the city & everywhere else we needed to go during our trip. The house had everything you needed! Towels, kitchen supplies, cleaning supplies and even toiletries in the bathroom! The beds were very comfy & the central heater was a big help to us since We are from Cali & it was really cold for us in Seattle! Overall, it was like a home away from a home. Would definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone because of the convenience, good price and comfortability. "
251922,25405068,2015-01-15,463880,Loren,This is the second time we have stayed at Edwin's place in West Seattle.  Great house.  Very clean.  Quiet.  Very comfortable beds.  Good towels.  Fast wi-fi.  West Seattle neighborhood is fun.  Good restaurants and stores.  Near Alki beach.  Easy to get anywhere in Seattle area.  Very highly recommend.  Will stay again.  
251922,25831562,2015-01-26,25282641,Sharon,"This was our first time using AirBnb and we weren't really sure what to expect. 

Edwin was very friendly and welcoming! The house was spotless and lovely. We saw him on our arrival but after that we did our own thing and didn't hear from him again until we left. 

It was just like living in a regular house and we would certainly consider staying with him again!"

251922,26457101,2015-02-13,20401909,Richard,Just a great place to stay period.  Edwin was gracious and helpful.  Beds were very comfy and the linen crisp and fresh.  Enough towels and even supplied soaps etc.  Ed even stocked the fridge with a few essentials to get us going.  My friend and I were attending a weeks course at South Seattle Collage and the location was just right.  Wi-fi was awesome as well.  Nights were uber quiet too.  Great for sleeping.  Ed's dog Angel was gorgeous too.....So cute.  Will for sure 100% use again.
251922,26545597,2015-02-15,26639344,Mary,Excellent!   Worked well for us. Would highly recommend. 
251922,26794554,2015-02-19,19008455,Genevieve,"Edwin's place is great!  Nicely kept, and a perfect location for exploring all the great offerings in West Seattle.  We had a wonderful time and would definitely rent here again.  Thank you!  "
251922,26932755,2015-02-22,26378576,Lucrecia,"Edwin's home is just as described. It is quiet, comfortable, clean and cozy. Keyless entry was very convenient. Edwin is quite accommodating and provides all essentials, even coffee, tea, and snacks. I traveled to Seattle for hip surgery. His home was a great place to come back to with my sister for healing/ recovery. The bed I was in was SO comfortable. Because of our schedules, unfortunately didn't get to meet in person. He is an awesome artist and has beautiful artwork about the home. He always was quickly responsive to emails and ready to help.  We forgot one of my pieces of medical equipment and he graciously put it in the mail for me.  Thank you so much, Edwin! Hope to meet you in person one day! "
251922,27229970,2015-02-28,2850902,Brett,"Edwin was very easy to work with, contacted us quickly, and was both generous and flexible when we decided to extend our stay.  The place was clean and well appointed, with a great location close to Alki beach.  Very quiet and comfortable!"
251922,27587471,2015-03-08,27045741,Robert,"This is a very comfortable location - I felt at home and Ed had snacks, coffee, cream, bagels, butter, jam all waiting.  Address, security codes, WiFi access, everything was sent several days before my scheduled arrival.  Ed sent reminders.  Helpful hints were posted.  I will stay again when next I need to be in the area.  Amenities and thoughtful provisions were made throughout."

251922,28515907,2015-03-25,24636422,Ziying,This is a very pretty house  in a very beautiful neighborhood. The beds and sofa are very comfortable and the host is very warm-hearted. We had a great time staying in Edwin's house and we would like to stay here again if we come to Seattle next time.
251922,28732509,2015-03-29,8220801,Kelli,"The space was clean and cozy, the description was accurate.  The location was fantastic, a short walk down to the water and a quiet neighborhood.  Everything in the home was comfortable, and the little extras like plenty of tea, tourist coupons, etc., helped make us feel welcome.  Checking in and our was very straightforward.  I'd stay there again!"
251922,29962073,2015-04-15,19762677,Janice,"Edwin made us feel very welcome, with fresh flowers and the staples available in the kitchen, tea coffee, sugar, salt and so on.... The house was clean and friendly and as described. The neighbourhood is very interesting and we enjoyed a few evening strolls, to catch a glimpse of the nearby ocean view. We loved attending an Art Evening, where Edwin, who is highly talented was exhibiting some of his amazing work. Thankyou for sharing your home with us,, we will be back !"
251922,30401764,2015-04-21,29604253,Gregory,"Sleepy North Admiral was a vary wonderful stay, from check-in to our departure. Our visit to Seattle and with our son was so much more enjoyable because of Edwin's hospitality. Quit neighborhood, clean and comfortable home. Home is the key word here, after sightseeing and visiting, the relaxing feeling of returning home just made our experience such a pleasant one. How anyone would want to stay in a hotel/motel when the hospitality of Sleepy North Admiral is available, is beyond us.
Thank you, Edwin

251922,30747590,2015-04-26,7041789,Pallavi,Your home was perfect for the three of us. The password punch key entry to your house made it easy for us to checj in (email hidden)e beds were very comfortable and it was very thoughtful of you to leave bagels and coffee for us. We also enjoyed going to alki beach from here which was just a 10 min walk!:) 
251922,31878166,2015-05-11,5611376,Vivian,Our second time here and equally as comfortable warm and wonderful. We love this house and hope to come back again in July.   It's easy commute to everywhere and west Seattle is so much less frenetic than Seattle itself. 
251922,32892646,2015-05-23,28831398,Yuan,Had a great time at Edwin's house. Thanks for everything Edwin had done for us. Really a nice guy.
251922,33574641,2015-05-30,18734147,April,"Edwin very kindly prepared fresh flowers in the house before we checked in, as well as some grocery in the fridge. The coffee he provided was amazing! The neighbourhood is quiet, yet not far from downtown and only 20mins from SEA airport. Gas, grocery and restaurants are all close to his housel. We enjoyed our stay at Edwin's place. "
251922,33919315,2015-06-02,23822406,Jie,"The house is very clean, neat，and well decorated. The host prepared flowers, magazines, and some foods. Really impressive. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. Thank you! APPLAUSE!"
251922,34413507,2015-06-08,13243019,David,"Edwin's place was just as described -- cozy and ideally situated outside of the hustle and bustle of downtown Seattle without being too far away from it all. It took no more than 10 minutes to get to downtown, and West Seattle had plenty of places to explore -- Alki Beach, Hamilton Park Lookout, Bakery Nouveau, etc. Edwin let us know he was available if we needed anything, and kitchens and bathrooms were well-stocked. I would gladly stay here again next time I visit Seattle and I highly recommend this AirBnb to others."
251922,34855121,2015-06-13,30350485,Barbara,"Great house in a great location. The house had everything we needed. The neighborhood was quite but close to the beach and good restaurants.  Not a bad ride to downtown Seattle and other places to see.  Would definately  stay again.
"
251922,36260528,2015-06-27,20899259,Steve,"Edwin has been a terrific host.  We have felt that he has our interests at heart from the beginning, including installation of a new air conditioner in the face of the impeding heat wave that is facing us for the next two weeks!  Will definitely hope to return for a future stay."
