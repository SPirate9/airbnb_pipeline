3689119,24567164,2014-12-30,1431054,Bob,"Charlotte and larry's place is great, great ballard location, sweet and cozy. It was perfect for my wife and I to visit our son nearby."
3689119,24730080,2015-01-02,1431054,Bob,"Great space in a great ballard/fremont location. Charlotte and larry were great host and made us feel welcome, even the nyr bubbly."
3689119,25135158,2015-01-07,3211932,Carole,"The Garden Guest House is on a quiet residential street within walking distance of restaurants, shops, and, in fact all of downtown Ballard.  When I arrived at Charlotte and Larry's Garden Guest House, I was greeted warmly by Larry and was shown around.   The Guest House is in the midst of the backyard of the main house, and is done up with lights and seeing areas so that it looked like a fairyland even in the midst of a Seattle winter.  Inside the Guest House the decor is artsy with plenty of space for 1 or 2 people.  The hosts have provided so many amenities:  hair dryer, a tiny kitchen area, even a flashlight.  It was very quiet there and I felt comfortable from the moment I walked in.  "
3689119,25763095,2015-01-25,13389228,Jeremy,"To other potential guests: I stayed here for a week and it was a perfect  little hideaway for my trip to Ballard. It's just as charming as it looks in the photos. Clean towels, a comfy bed, a well stocked bathroom, kitchenette with breakfast snacks and cookware. Even in late January, the heaters are enough to stay comfortable. Some other highlights:

- Welcome note and a Theo chocolate bar. Which I later learned is local to Ballard on the same block as my company's Seattle office.
- Very little street noise at night. It's a few blocks from a main street and places to eat. But it's far enough away from the bustle that you can get a great night sleep, no problem.
- Parking was easy. All 7 days there was a spot right in front of the house.
- Guide book. So, they have put together this extensive binder that's full of maps, schedules, and personal recommendations for where to go and what to do in Seattle. It was really thoughtfully done.
- Lockable safe. I didn't have need for it, but it's another extra step they have taken for their guests.
- Fresh banana muffins! Charlotte left them hanging on the front door for me on my second morning there along with a note. So sweet!

I met Charlotte & Larry the evening I checked in, but after that, they were out of sight. They seem super cool. Thank you Charlotte & Larry! "
3689119,26371087,2015-02-10,26228252,Jose,"Charlotte and Larry were great hosts. The little cottage was just how it is described. I stayed there for nine days and it was perfect. I was able to relax, explore and do some work. They left a book with all the bus routes and maps of all the neighborhoods for me which was unbelievably helpful since it was my first time in Seattle. They checked on me every once in a while but let me have my privacy as well. 

I will definitely stay here again when I'm back in Seattle. "
3689119,26604544,2015-02-16,5041916,Gwyn & Libby,We loved the Garden Guest House! It was in a perfect location - we literally didn't need our car at all for one entire day over our weekend stay. The place was very nicely decorated and very comfortable. We'd definitely stay there again! 
3689119,40976609,2015-08-03,903502,John,"Newly rehabbed guest cottage that is outfitted nicely, and very clean.  The kitchen is stocked with the finest goodies. There is a collection of interesting books. Eye-level screens divide the main space of the cottage into living, kitchen and bed areas.  The path from the street leads you past the hosts' house, through a lovely garden, a sitting area, then to the cottage's door. Larry and Charlotte are truly thoughtful people and perfect airbnb hosts."
3689119,42131304,2015-08-11,1665090,Carla,"Charlotte and Larry were very welcoming. The studio was filled with art and everything you could possibly need. Charlotte gave us a list of recommendations after we expressed our interest in museums and art galleries. She also saved us time and frustration in regards to taking our car on the Bainbridge ferry on a weekend. We saw Seattle from an insider's view. She was also helpful with bus routes, restaurants and unusual shops. Charlotte also recommended a sidetrip when we mentioned our drive up to Bellingham.  Ballard is a very happening place, and the backyard was a lovely place to retreat to after seeing the sights.  One of our best AirBnB experiences!"
3689119,42410253,2015-08-13,36963179,Elizabeth,"Larry & Charlotte made us feel very welcome from the moment we arrived. Their backyard studio was extremely comfortable and had everything we needed. They made sure we knew they were available if we needed anything and they provided plenty of great information about the area as well as the Seattle area as a whole. The location of Larry & Charlotte's place was great, too. The shops and restaurants of Ballard are in easy walking distance and downtown Seattle is only a few minutes drive over the Ballard Bridge. We loved our stay and would recommend this property to anyone looking for a fun, cozy place to stay in the Seattle area. 

We loved Kaylee, too!"
3689119,42878815,2015-08-16,480179,Hubert,"Very comfortable studio fully equipped in Ballard. A bit far from Downtown but easy to park if you have a car. Charlotte and Larry are really nice hosts, welcoming us with orange juice, water and milk in the fridge and everything to make coffee or tea. Nice experience. "
3689119,43221519,2015-08-18,18427767,Abby,"Absolutely loved staying here! Charlotte and Larry had tons of information and ideas laid out in the space to help us decide the best things to do when in Seattle. Larry was home when we got there so he helped us feel very comfortable and welcome when arriving. Great location, in a quiet neighborhood so easy sleeping but walkable to lots of fun restaurants and cafes. Awesome and beautiful space. Would definitely recommend it!!"
3689119,43684047,2015-08-21,1777273,Quinn,This was a great stay and the little space was just what I was looking for.  The outdoor area is quiet and and the studio is cozy.  Charlotte and Larry are quite helpful indeed.  You can walk to great coffee food and bars from here as well. Good spot.
3689119,44440762,2015-08-26,27911904,Annette,"This listing is spot on.  The studio in the hosts lovely oasis/garden backyard is very comfortable, and has everything needed for a great, relaxing trip.  Kitchen essentials were provided, and important day-starter items like delicious coffee, cereal, yogurt, milk, juice.  The bathroom was modern and clean, stocked with neat local products.  The towels were huge and fluffy.  We enjoyed having morning coffee right outside the door in the garden.  We loved exploring the Ballard neighborhoods and attractions, like the Nordic Heritage museum, the locks, and many of the Ballard breweries. The location is convenient with quick and easy access to downtown Seattle via the Ballard bridge with our rental car. Public transit was available.  There is a grocery nearby, and it was a good neighborhood for jogging. The hosts were friendly and helpful, with a large book in the studio of local attractions and other helpful information.  "
3689119,46165838,2015-09-08,250709,Dana & Fanny,"Charlotte, Larry & Kaylee made us feel very welcome in their cozy cottage, which was a perfect launch point for our daily excursions into the city,  Mt. Rainer and the north for some Whale watching. The cottage is conveniently located in the Ballard neighborhood, surrounded by great eateries, breweries, and nightlife! We would recommend their place to anyone planning a trip to the Seattle area.  The comfortable cottage has a very thoughtful layout, and is equipped with an efficient kitchen - perfect for that morning cup of coffee and tea. Thank you for making us feel at home during our stay in Seattle!"
3689119,46622439,2015-09-12,41668152,Christiane,Roomy and beautiful space in a private area. The garden was very peaceful and beautiful. Artistically decorated and arranged! Charlotte & Larry were wonderful hosts and left us some breakfast food in the kitchen.  
3689119,46897794,2015-09-14,347840,Vicki,"Charlotte and Larry made us feel very welcome.  Charlotte contacted me several times prior to our stay with full details.  We had our dog Abbey with us, and even though pets are not normally accepted, an exception was made.  I appreciated this very much.  Charlotte provided a cover for the couch so Abbey would be able to sit on it.  We were only asked that she not be on the bed which was not a problem as we had her bed with us.  The cottage was just as described...cute, cozy, clean and welcoming.  Breakfast items such as yogurt, cereal, milk, OJ, coffee (Starbucks of course) and a delicious chocolate bar were provided.  Toiletry items, extra towels, sheets, etc. were also provided.  There was no television, but there was a combo CD player/Radio with decent speakers and a nice selection of CD's to choose from.  There was a binder of information on the Seattle area and information on many of the attractions in the area.  Our time was limited and unfortunately we did not have much time to spend at the cottage.  I would have loved to have enjoyed a glass of wine in the garden and linger among the beautiful flowers.  The lights were a nice touch too.  The inside of the cottage was decorated beautifully.  I noticed something new at every turn.  Even though it was small, it was fine for the 3 of us (my husband, my daughter & myself). My daughter slept on the single pull out couch and felt it was fine.  The bed was extremely comfy.  The first night we were able to park in the driveway as Charlotte & Larry were out of town.  However on the 2nd night we had to find street parking.  With a full sized pick-up truck, it was a bit of a challenge.  We did not have time to walk around Ballard, however we drove to and had a great time at The Leary traveler, an extremely dog-friendly pub and grill.  My husband left his hat behind and Charlotte graciously offered to mail it back to us.  I would happily stay at Charlotte and Larry's Garden Guest House again.  "
3689119,47844985,2015-09-21,39046730,Kathleen,"Larry accommodate my arrival time and he and Charlotte made sure I felt comfortable and safe during my 2-day stay. Gone most of the day, I enjoyed their nice selection of CDs and books for relaxing evenings. Excellent neighborhood for walking with Ballard Market close by."
3689119,48146255,2015-09-23,27155300,James,we stayed at charlotte and larrys' place last Monday and Tuesday. their place was exactly as described and they were warm and welcoming. communication was excellent and vibe was laid back. we would stay with them again if we come back to seattle
3689119,48563643,2015-09-27,42766186,Kristen,Larry and Charlotte were very nice and welcoming.  The cottage was cozy and had everything you need. The yard was beautiful.    Would definitely recommend staying here!
3689119,49030912,2015-09-30,41587987,Deborah,"Charlotte and Larry's hafh (home away from home) was truly lovely. A comfortable, spacious, anchor for my visit to Seattle. Everything I could have wished for was there, from breakfast choices to music and wheat bags to bathroom necessities. Thanks for the knowledgeable personal touch. "
3689119,50971982,2015-10-16,21468748,Greg,"What can I say to describe how perfect our stay was. We were greeting by Larry who showed us everything and then met Charlotte who went over all the information we needed to tour the city of Seattle. We loved the Guest House, the neighborhood, Ballard and Seattle too!!! Thank you "
3689119,51362797,2015-10-19,15140691,Charity,"What a lovely welcome we had to the garden guest house!  Charlotte and Larry left easy instructions on how to access the house if they weren't available, and as soon as they arrived home they came to greet us with friendly smiles and local advice.  The best part, for me, there was a welcome chocolate bar.. the perfect thing to take the edge off my hunger when we arrived!  There was also a fridge stocked with juice, creamer, etc for breakfast.. cereals.. coffee and tea.. etc.  The bathroom had a great selection of lotions and sweet smelling toiletries.  The garden is more lovely than the pictures can show!  All in all, a delightful experience!"
3689119,54016803,2015-11-15,25285360,Amy,"Great little house and location.  Charlotte and Larry are very kind.  They provided lots of treats as well as toiletries, and information about Seattle.  There is a good working internet connection.  The place is cozy and decorated beautifully. And there is a good library with a lot of my personal favorites. "
3689119,55875535,2015-12-06,14518171,Jennifer,Charlotte and Larry were both really easy and warm to communicate with. I was up visiting a friend who had a child in the hospital so having a quiet and cozy place to land was important to me. The space had everything I needed. There were thoughtful touches throughout and the location was great too. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle.
3689119,58432099,2016-01-02,260134,Lane,They were phenomenal! Beautiful private space with yard and an above and beyond amount of amenities / provided extras!
5021081,41454615,2015-08-07,11525944,Yifan,"The house is nice, and has a good view. The driveway slope is a big challenge for drivers :P"
5021081,46212201,2015-09-08,42647084,Oriana,"Host was not involved really, only arranged the rental and verification/money.  The house seems like it has not been occupied. There was hardly anything in the kitchen for food prep. Plastic disposable spoons, a spice rack and plates make it hard to create a meal with.   Linens and extra towels were in the garage in plastic bins...the last place you would look when coming in late and tired.
The listing says it has 3 queen beds. It has 3 full beds. The house is cramped, the driveway is up a steep incline, then you have to go up at least 2 flights of crazy steep stairs, which is hard with older people, dangerous with little kids and hard with heavy luggage. One of the rooms smells like a dog bathroom. 
The view is of a freeway and the back of a Public Stoprage facility and train tracks. "
5021081,52944844,2015-11-02,47728985,Kai,This house is great. Our stay was clearly laid out with simple directions. The house is in a great location as well. Would highly recommend.
5021081,53557978,2015-11-09,38369338,Daniel,"Ashwin did a beautiful job at making us feel welcome. The place is absolutely amazing and comfortably housed our group of 7. 
Very easy access to downtown from the D-Line as well. We loved it!"
5021081,53803997,2015-11-12,13967254,Emmanuel,The host canceled this reservation 41 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1872885,23424201,2014-12-01,16149760,Carli,"Would recommend staying here to anyone (long or short term)!  I was in Seattle for a 3 month internship and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The townhouse is conveniently a 10 min bus ride from downtown and walking distance to the stadiums.  On top of the great location, Mandy was such a welcoming host and gave great advice for places to visit :)"
1872885,31158966,2015-05-03,22956218,Taylor,"Mandy was very welcoming. House was very nice, room was cozy and had plenty of room for one person. Great dogs!"
1872885,43898375,2015-08-23,11918467,Pawel,"I stayed at Amanda's place during a three month internship and it was great! The neighborhood is safe and peaceful with downtown just a quick bus ride away. The own bedroom + bathroom setup works perfectly. I was able to use anything that I needed in the kitchen without a problem. Amanda is a great person to live with, always willing to provide assistance or helpful advice about the area. She does have two dogs, but they are never in the way. Sometimes you don't even realize that they are there. I would definitely stay there again for both short and longer term."
1872885,48988298,2015-09-30,10876727,Kevin,"I stayed in Mandy's home for 1 month and had an excellent experience. The home layout for the guest is perfect with the spare bedroom and bathroom together on one floor. The shared living spaces are great also and Mandy makes abundant cabinet and refrigerator space available. The dogs are adorable and were not disruptive at all. The location also worked very well. The 36 and 60 bus route stops are steps away from the home; I enjoy walking so by foot the International District is 10 minutes away, Beacon Hill Link Light Rail station 15 minutes away, Harborview Hospital 20 minutes, and Pioneer Square approximately 35 minutes. Mandy is exceptionally friendly and was always happy to answer any questions or offer advice on things to see/do in the city. If I was returning Seattle for an extended visit I would inquire about staying here again."
1872885,56364194,2015-12-13,12677300,Jessica,Mandy is very welcoming and accepting in her home. The room is fully furnished with all bedroom necessities. You have a private bathroom to yourself. Her dogs are very sweet. 
8385444,50409212,2015-10-11,46023020,Tristian,"Staying at Margarets location in Maple Leaf was magnificent! We were only in Seattle for the weekend but we said the entire time we were there that we felt cozy, at home, and that everything was very well kept. Margaret was a fantastic host, leaving snacks for us and stayed in great contact to answer any questions we had. The neighborhood is nice and the haven is off the side street so it is very quiet and private. Just down the road there were tasty restaurants to have breakfast and lunch, and getting around was easily navigable.

I would highly recommend Private Haven in Maple Leaf for anyone making the journey to the Seattle area, and I would definitely consider staying here again! "
8385444,51253748,2015-10-18,40707493,Emily,"Had a great time! My favorite thing about this place was all the yummy breakfast food and other treats Margaret had for us. The house is located in a nice neighborhood behind a bigger house, so you get a sense of privacy. It's just a short walk to tons of restaurants and bars on Lake City Way. The house is adorable and the perfect size for two. Margaret was a great host and always available!"
8385444,55041093,2015-11-27,13073255,Lexy,"The house is so adorable, it was the perfect place for my boyfriend and I to spend Thanksgiving. Margaret provided everything we would need and more to have a lovely stay. I highly recommend this place, location is great as well, although we didn't really leave the house much!
Thanks Margaret!!! =.]"
8385444,55148598,2015-11-28,428327,Jennifer,"Great stay! The space is really lovely, with a really comfortable bed and a well-equipped kitchen.  Communication was straightforward and easy. We will book again without hesitation.  Thanks Margaret!"
8385444,55693323,2015-12-04,28596307,Ron,"Margaret made us feel at home! After a long and tiresome journey to Seattle, Margaret's attention to the details- Organic apples, food in the fridge, clean towels and bedsheets, made our life easy and comfortable. She was always available when we needed something. The apartment was very private and the environment is quiet."
8385444,55737665,2015-12-05,428327,Jennifer,Our second stay with Margaret was great! Thank you!
7784802,45040884,2015-08-30,42697090,Johnny,Charlie was a great host.  Her place was clean and convenient and her cat was super cool.  Great first experience with Airbnb!
7784802,45751265,2015-09-05,28590727,Austin,"Nice apartment, and a great location with a very sweet cat. Thanks a lot!"
7784802,46232766,2015-09-08,37725865,Kellen,"The apartment was exactly what we were promised and were looking for. The location was amazing and the host was responsive, helpful and easy to deal with. Kingsley was an adorable little monster and brightened up our stay. Perfect stay! Thanks Ruth!"
7784802,48333811,2015-09-25,8013961,Chris,"The apartment was just what i needed, simple, a comfortable bed and located right in the heart of capitol hill. The kitty was nice and was friendly but then also let me sleep. And the communication and logistics were super easy."
7784802,49193802,2015-10-01,461891,Richard,"Fantastic location for shops, bars and food.  This cozy studio is not a full time AirBnB like some are, but is still clean and very neat.  As Seattle residents ourselves we knew the area well and licked it because it was close to where we wanted to be.  We only needed to spend one night while our house was being worked on, but it was so much fun it had us considering doing it more!"
7784802,49276080,2015-10-02,11519296,Leslie,"I have to admit: I fell in love with this place when I saw Kingsley the cat. And Kingsley was fabulous. He is a furry purr-ball and super affectionate. The location was also fantastic, especially at this price -- walking distance from everywhere in Capitol Hill, plus Amazon just down the hill. The only slight drawback is that the room is on ground level, so if you are an extremely light sleeper like I am, you might find it a bit on the noisy side. That said, most normal sleepers would probably not even notice it. Overall, highly recommend!"
7784802,49954077,2015-10-07,2530696,Mike,"Ruth was great with communications and very friendly and helpful. The studio was very comfortable and stylish. It is on the ground floor so there is a bit of noise from people walking by, but it was fine. The cat was very friendly and cuddly for the first 15 minutes, but then mostly let me be. Conveniently located in Capital hill neighborhood.

Some mini shampoos and soaps among other toiletries were helpfully available."
7784802,51394155,2015-10-19,27006797,Katerina,Staying at Ruth's apartment ( with her amazing cat Kingsley) made my first trip to Seattle a great one! It was perfectly located to enjoy all that Seattle had to offer! Exactly as listed on Airbnb & check in/out was super smooth! Highly recommend this place!
7784802,52174229,2015-10-26,46975912,Nathan,"Ruth was quick to respond to all my inquiries and though I didn't meet her personally, she still made everything very convenient and simple for my first AirBnB stay. The location couldn't have been better for me and her cat was so loving that I didn't want to leave him. If you're in Seattle and want to walk around and enjoy the busy part of the city, this is a great place to stay. Though the parking should have been a pain, I showed up at 4pm on Saturday and zoned parking is between 7am-6pm, Monday through Saturday, so I never even had to move my car."
7784802,52559825,2015-10-30,40942530,Jeffrey,"The place was just what I had in mind from the post -- perhaps even better than the post. It was within walking distance to a lot of cool places to eat, drink, entertainment, and etc.  Her cat made us feel at home and me and my gf slept like babies in her cozy place.  "
7784802,53026880,2015-11-03,21336914,Alyssa,"We came into town a little later in the day than normal, and Ruth was very responsive in giving us simple instructions for a later checkin. The area was perfect for what we were looking for- something conveniently located in the hub of Capitol Hill. 

For a quick stay at a reasonable price, I'd absolutely recommend Ruth's place. Just make sure you're cool with cats! :) "
7784802,53638368,2015-11-10,2871003,Daphne,"Ruth was very proactive and responsive. I felt welcomed and very clear on what expectations were for my stay. The location was great - near the park, and the shops and cafes on Broadway in Capitol Hill. "
7784802,54396070,2015-11-19,48085751,Jessica,"This listing was perfect! I needed something comfy and chill, and Ruth's met that need perfectly. I got into Seattle very late but Ruth was incredibly accommodating via messaging to ensure I had everything I needed to get into the space. Kingsley the kitty was a gracious host and fantastic snuggle buddy! The location was perfectly walkable to Pike Place market and the Space Needle if you're into walking (which I am!). Perfect location. I'm looking forward to coming back!"
7784802,55056357,2015-11-27,46363613,Zachary,It was a lovely time all though a bit frantic had pretty full days during my stay and was nice to have a bed to crash in myself
7784802,56993416,2015-12-20,48895136,Heather,Ruth's place was tidy and right in the middle of Seattle. Love Kingsley the cat!
7784802,58616161,2016-01-03,6721188,Anthony,"Our stay at Ruth's apartment was great. She was easy to communicate with and quick to respond to any questions we had. The apartment was very clean, and the location couldn't have been better. Kingsley the cat was super friendly and lovable, and a great host, too!"
3720429,18921358,2014-09-02,20496266,Katie,John's condo was perfect for our weekend getaway.  He's in a great location on lower Queen Anne.   It was easy to get in and out. The condo has lots of natural light.  Nice kitchen with all the utensils you might need. Jon is super nice and a very gracious host.
3720429,20123293,2014-09-23,8135013,Danny,"I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking in the area. Jon was extremely pleasant to work with. He was flexible in dealing with the key and parking arrangements. The place was immaculate. I felt like I was at home in a completely foreign city. Great location, conveniently located, multiple restaurants within walking distance, short cab/uber to most Seattle attractions. My experience was without a doubt 10/10."
3720429,20923489,2014-10-07,13323497,Andrew,"Jon's place was very comfortable and in a great neighborhood.  Conveniently, there was a bus stop at the corner, and a grocery store basically under the building.  It was a great home base for our time in Seattle.
Jon did a great job communicating before, during, and after the trip.  He also left explicit instructions for the place--if you're looking for a place where you can just plop down, this may not be the right spot, as Jon takes good care of his place and was careful to note what he did or didn't want being used.  But in general it was an easy stay."
3720429,21240302,2014-10-13,21695112,Corinne,"My husband and I loved our stay in Seattle at Jon's place. It was our first time using airbnb and he made the experience super easy and stress-free. The apartment is in a great location- we were able to walk to all the tourist spots we wanted to check out, as well as enjoy more local areas. The apartment is incredibly clean, organized and Jon provided clear directions for any unique issues - which were very few. Jon is a great host - he was available throughout the trip via text, but did not nag. He provided lots of great restaurant, bar suggestions and even let us borrow his guest parking pass for our rental car. I would highly recommend booking his place if you're visiting Seattle! "
3720429,25621942,2015-01-20,26185198,Bob,Jon is a very considerate host.  His condo is spotless and very inviting.  It's located in a great neighborhood with nice walk ability.  I would not hesitate to stay here again.  
3720429,26327673,2015-02-09,4242473,Frederick,One of the best airbnb places I have stayed in. I have stayed in at least maybe 20 places.
3720429,47213036,2015-09-16,1962695,Emily,Jon's place was exactly as pictured. The neighborhood was also great with many places to grab food only a couple minutes walk away. I would definitely consider staying here again the next time I am in Seattle. 
4264043,21254673,2014-10-13,20697084,David,"Lori was a great host. Amazing location! 5-10 minute walks to everything; Pikes Place, Downtown, the Waterfront, Space Needle, Occidental Park. Yeah the place needs a bit of updating. But, can't complain for the price. Would recommend for anyone looking to get the most out of Seattle."
4264043,21400654,2014-10-16,16884195,Jonah,"The location of the place was truly outstanding! 
Everything was within walking distance from this location!  Shopping starts two blocks in one direction and the bars, pubs, lounges, cafes, restaurants are all over the neighborhoods.     Not to mention that all the bakeries and coffee houses are sprinkled everywhere you walk.

The apartment is what I would call, one of the great old vintage apartment buildings built in the late 1920's.  There was lots of creaking sounds one makes while walking around on the hardwood floors, but that's to be expected from a 20th century style apartment building like this one.  

The room was like the photos on AirBnB;  it's a clean, no frills style, vintage feeling room.  There's also a bathroom and a deep old style tube with a shower, and a small kitchen (but with all the great eating places around, I don't see that you need to eat in).  The décor was also a cool mix of a basic midcentury modern style of furnishings as well.  

Overall for the great price she offers and what your getting I think she's pretty fair.  I think that it's a nice clean room with a soft comfortable bed and I enjoyed my stay a lot.  

She lives in the building too, so you can call or text here for anything, as she is a very friendly and helpful soul."
4264043,21486178,2014-10-18,16652666,Kevin,"Lori's place was great! The apartment is in an incredible location. It's just a couple of blocks off the Westlake light rail stop, so it's super easy to get to after flying into Seattle. The Space Needle and Pike Place Market are both 5 minute walks away. I would definitely recommend staying here!"
4264043,21679422,2014-10-21,8523293,Vanessa,"We never got to meet Lori but she was great! She had the keys ready and waiting for us, checked on us to make sure everything was okay, and quick to respond if we had a question. The neighborhood is central to so many things and not a far walk from different modes of public transit. The description was accurate, it's small and simple, and the building is charming."
4264043,22153706,2014-10-31,20485198,Vincent,"This was a great little flat, right in the middle of Seattle's downtown area. The location was terrific, just a short walk from the seafront, the market and Seattle Centre. It would be a great place from which to explore the city and surrounding area.
The flat is a decent size, clean, comfy, private and well stocked. Excellent value too."
4264043,22371980,2014-11-04,22408300,Catherine,Can't beat the price and location! Lori is awesome and the other residents in the building are really laid back and great. It has all the essentials. Had a great stay in Seattle!
4264043,22496858,2014-11-08,22587293,Dharshini,Lori was great! She attended to all our requests promptly and the apartment was clean and comfortable. It is the perfect size for 2 people and the location is amazing. 
4264043,22655335,2014-11-11,22153226,Jarrod,I never got to meet her but she made things very easy.
4264043,22983229,2014-11-19,22351644,Jessica,"My boyfriend and I had the honor of staying here for a week and we absolutely loved this place! Lori was an exceptional host and whenever we had a question or needed assistance, she was quick to help us out. She also provided us with brochures with all the big Seattle attractions. 

The apartment itself is located right in the center of downtown so we were able to walk everywhere, including Pike Place Market and the Space Needle, within 10-15 minutes. The apartment has a full bathroom and a full kitchen, which includes all the basic amenities such as towels, pots and pans, plates/bowls, and utensils. It has a nice and cozy feel to the place, which is perfect after a day on the town!

All in all, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for an affordable and convenient place to stay in the heart of Seattle! "
4264043,23077223,2014-11-22,6987375,Emily,"Super easy, great location and Lori was very accommodating! Wish it had been just a little more cozy during our cold Seattle visit-- the radiator wasn't working while we were there, but the building heat kept us warm enough!"
4264043,23165466,2014-11-24,16433092,Caroline,Great great location! Lori made everything extremely easy for us upon arriving and departing! 
4264043,23840766,2014-12-12,23580781,Sander,"Topplek in Seattle, dichtbij alles, heel basic maar voldoende voor een perfect verblijf. Lori was bijzonder behulpzaam"
4264043,23997794,2014-12-16,8244355,Roy,"Love the small studio!  The host met us and showed us the room.  The communication was great.  The location is central and short walking distance to Pikes Marketplace / Ferris Wheel and the Monorail that goes to Space Needle and Museums.  Had to circle the block a few times to find parking and got lucky with a spot right in front.  Parking is free from 8pm to 8am and all day Sunday, otherwise it is street metered.  Will definitely come back again, especially liked the warm radiator that keep the room toasty.  There is no WiFi or Cable, but they do have a TV with DVD.
"
4264043,24140554,2014-12-21,8894629,Luna,"This is a charming old building tucked into the heart of Seattle, surrounded by hotels, restaurants and bars with shopping nearby. We walked to evening entertainment at the Triple Door and daytime exploring through Pike Place market and the waterfront. 
This is a studio apartment with a large closet area and small kitchen. The bed was comfortable. 
Lori was helpful and hospitable. I liked the feeling of stepping off the noisy street and into the past, climbing up one flight of stairs that looked and felt much as they did 100 years ago. The building is quiet inside. The décor in our room was mid-20th century. 
We will keep The Virginian on our list!
"
4264043,24272996,2014-12-24,6134672,Hugo,"Perfect stay in Seattle! The appartment is really awesome with the charm of the old style furnitures. Location is just perfect, between two luxury hotels, steps away from a great grocery store, great restaurants and dowtown shops. The only negative comment is that it could have been cleaner. 
I would definitely go there again! "
4264043,24418706,2014-12-28,12285385,Andrea,"What a great location and super airbnb experience! Just a short walk to pike place market and plenty of public transportation options. 
Lori was a great host ; keys were available when we got there and she was very responsive when we inquired about a hair dryer. 
The bed was incredibly comfortable. The apartment was just fine for two people who are in seattle to see the sights, there's not really much room to relax in the room other than on the bed. We never quite figured out the heater and it made some noise, but we still slept great and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Would definitely recommend it! "
4264043,24483224,2014-12-29,3127344,Emily,"Great location, Lori is super nice and we had everything we needed. She even let us in before the normal check in time. The only thing is that the heater was really noisy but we had earplugs so it wasn't a huge deal. It's a great place to stay for a night if you want to be near the action in Seattle!"
4264043,25591550,2015-01-20,19972728,Kelsey,"Lori's place is perfect for anyone who wants to be in the heart of Seattle. My boyfriend and I were able to walk to all the sites that we wanted to see, and the few times we didn't walk, the public transit stops were all right close by. Ralphs Market, right across the street, was a great place to pick up breakfast supplies, and most of the time our data was enough for internet access, but if not, we just hit the Starbucks down the street. The apartment has historic charm and is a comfortable size for two. The bed was nice as well. Lori provided us with the necessary information for our later check-in and then let us on our own. It couldn't have been a better landing pad for our eventful exploration of Seattle. "
4264043,25917342,2015-01-29,20989909,Cassandra,"This location could NOT have been better! We were within walking distance of everything we wanted to do in Seattle. The place was warm, clean, and had everything we needed, including kitchenware. I would absolutely stay here again or recommend it to anyone planning on visiting the area. "
4264043,26310182,2015-02-09,6237261,Venice,"This place is a good spot if you want to be walking distance to all the Seattle tourist attractions, and to the train/monorail/streetcar stop. Nick is also a good host, easy to communicate with and flexible. The place is very simple, and just like what you see in the pictures. It's a good place to stay for two people, and if you're there for only a few days."
4264043,26748108,2015-02-18,26589887,Seth,"Everything was exactly what it claimed to be. Perfect location for the perfect price, and no unnecessary bells and whistles. The whole process was streamlined. We got our keys easily and were able to stay later in the day before our flight because it wasn't rented that night (thanks!)

This is the perfect launching pad to explore downtown, and there is a huge range of fun stuff within walking distance. It's RIGHT where you want to be. The room itself is small and modest, but well worth it if you are an urban explorer who just needs the basics."
4264043,27090812,2015-02-25,24951499,Yvonna,"The place is very convenient to walk to sightseeing spots, and the kitchen is equipped and useful. Though we've met power went out and noises of the heater, Nick had replied and help solve the issues promptly. If the door lock can be securer will make travelers feel at ease."
4264043,27253393,2015-03-01,24460060,Javier,"Nick was extremely helpful in helping to find the place and staying a phone call away. The place is just as described. Location is everything for this place. It was walking distance to EVERYTHING! The bed does make quite a bit of noise, but by the end of the day, we were so tired, that it didn't matter."
4264043,27534247,2015-03-07,5716780,Celina,"Location was perfect! Walking distance to Capitol Hill, Pike Place Market, Space Needle, and everything else we wanted to see. The room was comfortable, but the walls were really thin, and the floor was very creaky. Great place for what we paid!"
4264043,27800144,2015-03-12,15025441,Nicolas,"The location is amazing! Basically half way between the pike place market and the space needle (each a 5-10 minute walk). The neighborhood is very walkable and safe with plenty of nice restaurants nearby. The room itself is very clean, the bed was VERY comfortable; a little small though. I enjoyed my stay very much, and was very happy with Nick as he host. I arrived rather late (almost midnight) but Nick remained very courteous and professional! I will definitely recommend simply because of the price versus location!"
4264043,28013200,2015-03-16,18111920,Amy,"This place was exactly what we needed -- great location, simple amenities, reasonable price.  Nick was also very responsive and helpful."
4264043,28132871,2015-03-18,9965956,Jacki,"Great location, and Nick was super helpful in getting keys to me and everything. It's super close to Pike Place Market and is really easy to get to from the airport by light rail. The building is older and a bit creaky, and the room could have been a bit cleaner, but overall it's a good place to stay. As noted, there isn't wifi in the room, but there is a little deli a couple buildings down that has free wifi if you need it, which Nick pointed out to me."
4264043,28391382,2015-03-23,24386379,Katie,"Great central location and decent amenities for the price of the apartment. Really, all the essentials you need. **but NO WiFi
HOWEVER, we did encounter a few problems:
1. No answer when we arrived (notified owner that we were coming in late) and eventually when we got into the building the AirBnB door was unlocked...
2. Had not been cleaned. Fridge still had half-eaten food in it, and dirty tissues under bed

Besides that, no problem with the room as we were not in it much and its all a traveler really needs. "
4264043,28606287,2015-03-27,7535667,Cassandra,Great location! Nick was very quick with communicating and the apartment was a very fun little place to spend a few days!
4264043,28784242,2015-03-30,6626317,Matt,"Nick and Amy were both incredibly flexible. The check-in process was seamless and the place was exactly as advertised. Loved the location, all of the amenities were perfect, and it was just an overall positive experience. Hope to stay there again."
4264043,30025324,2015-04-16,7896484,Erin,"Amy was very responsive the week leading up to our trip and helped with tips on how to get around Seattle as well as to the airport for our departure. She also accommodated our request for early check-in and was extremely easy to get in contact with. 

The apartment was clean and true to the photos shown on the listing. We did cook in the kitchen for a few meals and two people can easily sleep in the bed provided. The only complaint would be the lack of items such as additional toilet paper/paper/trash bags towels and some kitchen supplies, such as coffee mugs. 

The location was superb, we had a short walk to Pikes Place market and were able to pick up random items at the grocer across the street. I would definitely recommend this apartment for a short stay in Seattle. "
4264043,30933825,2015-04-29,27509690,Yu-Sheng,The house is absolutely at a great location. We have all the essentials we need and we felt cozy lay in bed after having a trip. Amy was kind and all the process was simple. We will definitely stay here again.
4264043,31101220,2015-05-02,13167410,Taylor,"Great communication, location, and stay! I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Seattle."
4264043,31421706,2015-05-05,21675513,Laurie,"We really enjoyed our stay at Amy's appartment. It´s spacious, well located and had everything we needed. We would definitely stay here again."
4264043,31760030,2015-05-10,10889084,Anna,Check in was really easy and flat was easy to find. It was perfectly located for us to do lots of tourist things! Flat was nice and airy and well laid out - had everything we needed. Thank you!
4264043,32054317,2015-05-13,536867,Ha,"Amy was so helpful. We needed to print out a city pass and she not only did that but also delivered it to our front door (Thank you!). The apartment itself was cozy, enough space for the 2 of us. The bed was squeaky and old, should get replaced soon as it started to get uncomfortable on our last night there. The location was perfect. We were only 5 min walk to Pike's and 10 min to Space needle."
4264043,33173839,2015-05-25,20512259,Julianne,"This place was a perfect little apartment to stay in. The location was amazing! The kitchen is supplied well, and I was able to cook some meals. "
4264043,33369275,2015-05-27,14374632,Rebecca,"Never met Amy and she was hard to get in contact with in the days before our arrival; however, she emailed me the day before with informative instructions on how to get our keys and a festival happening in the city. 

Our room was clean and comfortable. It's a perfect room for a young couple traveling on a budget and it's in a great location - a short walk to Pike Place and the Space Needle. "
4264043,33498223,2015-05-29,4695270,Jemma,Amazing studio!! walking distance from everyone. Definitely has the old vintage feel! Very quiet. Would love to come back. 
4264043,33979105,2015-06-03,26217507,Drew,"This location is seconds from fine dining and several small eateries, mass transit, and high end shopping.  The room is simple and quaint. small bed and small refrigerator.  Very clean presentation.  

The thin walls made it apparent when people were coming and going.  Being close the the stair well did not help with the noise level either.  The water pressure is low, so don't expect breathtaking showers.

Overall, this is a great downtown location if you don't need a lot of amenities.  
"
4264043,34279960,2015-06-07,844398,Kristina,"The Virginian is really an ideal location for a Seattle trip.  It is a 5-10 minute walk to almost everything (Pike's Place Market, Space Needle, waterfront, etc).  For the price, it's impossible to beat!  The apartment is small but has everything you need - fridge, microwave, small kitchen, bed, and bath.  The apartment could use a deep cleaning, but it's definitely not ""dirty"".  Check in was easy enough.  One thing I will mention is that the walls are very thin and the floors/stairs are very creeky.  Another thing is that one of the residents must smoke because I could smell it when they were smoking.  It would even wake me up at night but I'm very sensitive to cigarette smoke.  The unit itself does not really smell of cigarettes.  I could just smell it when someone was smoking nearby. "
4264043,34528470,2015-06-09,30176316,Joanne,"Location: Located right in the smack middle of downtown Seattle. My friend and I walked to everywhere- Space Needle, Chihuly Museum, Kerry Park, Pike Place Market, Starbucks Reserves Tasting Room, and so many good famous restaurants. And we don't really work out often so that says something! Also there is Ralph's right across the street which is convenient.

The host: The owner, Amy, was super helpful and friendly. We landed in Seattle at 9:30 AM. Even though the check-in is at 2:00 PM, she let us drop off our luggage and store them in her office so we can go sight-see in the morning until the check-in time!! Huge thanks to Amy for that!!

Room: The room is perfect for two people- one comfy bed, good hot shower, fridge, clean dishware... We visited Seattle when it was pretty hot and sunny-- higher than 80 degree, but the room itself was pretty cool and unaffected by the temperature.

I'd say my friend and I made a smart choice of choosing this place for an affordable and efficient travel in Seattle."
4264043,34698025,2015-06-11,22786044,Rachelle,"211 was a great little apartment and the location was perfect. It's a short walk to shopping, pike place, and a Starbucks down the street for wifi ;) the building is very authentic but it did smell somewhat of stale cigarette smoke. Easy access though and a smooth check in with Amy who was very helpful! We found that there was no TV which was a bit of a downer but we had an iPad to use. Definitely would recommend especially price-wise compared to hotels in Seattle! "
4264043,35196031,2015-06-16,345389,Leeann,"This place was perfect. amazing location, perfect size for 2, felt very safe! i would stay here again and i would recommend to my friends for sure. thanks!!!"
4264043,35451064,2015-06-19,4056575,Kelly And Chris,"The check in and out was very smooth, only met Amy for a second on our way in but we enjoyed our stay for sure. We didn't rent a car but instead used public transportation or walked everywhere since the location was so central. Really liked Seattle :)"
4264043,35769070,2015-06-22,1224602,Tracy,"Fantastic location, easy to find and Amy was more than accommodating.  Would stay here again."
4264043,36018881,2015-06-24,11458081,Harry,"The best thing about the space is the location. It is really convenient to get around. The space is vintage, so expect creaky floors and thin walls. My only complaint is that the floors were really oily. Other than that, everything was fine. I didn't get to meet the host, Amy, but she was relatively responsive once I arrived. Would stay again just for convenience"
4264043,36167482,2015-06-26,27101087,Tabitha,"The apartment was cozy and I loved all the features that were original to the apartment like the bed and the cabinets.  I found the bed really comfy, perfect for just me but can't imagine two people trying to sleep on it. You cannot beat the location, it is a quick walk to almost everywhere you might want to go and the neighborhood around seems nice and safe. This is a perfect home base for exploring Seattle and I would not hesitate to stay here again if I find myself back in the Seattle area."
4264043,36505077,2015-06-29,27758323,Blake,"Amy was very easy to work with. She met us when she said she would, which we greatly appreciated. Also, the place was clean and met all of our expectations. Thanks Amy!"
4264043,37052379,2015-07-04,8241198,Ruth,Accommodation was as described Great location and bed was very comfortable but found it a little small for two. Check in was very smooth and Amy was easy to contact. 
4264043,38817815,2015-07-19,13542668,Ken,"Wonderful place, it's the perfect location, very cool apartment,  excellent hosts, everything is very easy and well prepared, the place is old but that's what gives it the Victorian Charm but if your unable to carry suitcases up two flights of stairs look elsewhere, otherwise this is the place! Highly recommended!"
4264043,39295078,2015-07-22,9685685,Mary,"PROS: Location, location, location! Just like everyone else stated, the best perks about this place is the location. If you are coming from Sea-Tac airport, just take the LINK lightrail train (about 40-45 minutes) and it's 5 minutes walk from there.  Amy met up with us on time and gave some suggestions for us to visit.  It's about 5-10 minutes walking distance from all the touristy spots we wanted to go to (Space needle, Chihuly Glass Museum, Starbucks Reserve Roastery, Ride the Ducks, Pike Place). The apartment looks exactly like it does in the photos. It has a refrigerator there, fan which was great for the hot summer time, bathroom stocked shampoos, toothpaste, toilet paper, 2 towels, we didn't need to bring much extra bathroom toiletries.  The bed fits 2 people and the kitchen has plates, cups, stove to cook if needed. There is a tiny sofa there but not meant for anyone to sleep on.

CONS: The apartment itself is a bit old and dated but I felt very safe staying here. 

Overall I would definitely come back the next time I visit Seattle! Thanks Amy!"
4264043,39606084,2015-07-25,30887095,Benoît,Appartement meublé vintage. On se croirait presque dans le Seattle des années 1930. Logement idéalement situé en hyper centre. Pas mieux !
4264043,39903482,2015-07-27,15831201,Joline,The location was perfect and the apartment was clean and cozy. The outside noise could get a little loud. The bed is comfortable but tight for 2 and squeaky. We learned that the parking in and around the downtown is expensive. We found the Westin parking garage behind the building to be the best option.
4264043,40716066,2015-08-02,14741382,Alex,The apartment was clean comfortable and an amazing location! It's an old building so the floors do creek and the walls are thin - it didn't bother us I just noticed a few people had mentioned this ! Check in was very smooth and Amy clearly explained how everything worked and we didn't have any issues whilst we were there . Would definitely stay again ! 
4264043,41190703,2015-08-05,28897151,Alex,"Good experience here – the best feature was the location, hands down. It was an easy walk to Pike's Place Market and Lake Union. Plenty of space in the apartment – full-size fridge, full (if small) kitchen, full bathroom, etc.

The place wouldn't win any awards for ambiance/decor, but it's not like the post was misleading. Good value – would stay here again. Things to improve: wifi would be nice, and there was a slight odor (though we only noticed it for a few minutes each time we came back to the apartment). The building obviously had some great history to it as well."
4264043,41924415,2015-08-10,136555,Caroline,It was a pleasure to be back at The Virginian.  The rooms are basic and funky but perfectly comfortable.  Amy provided info prior to  my arrival and was helpful when I had issues getting the keys to work.  I look forward to returning.  
4264043,42670175,2015-08-15,16550941,George,"Location, location, location, that pretty much summarizes this apartment. If you looking for a luxurious apartment this is not it, but the location is great, and in the end Location in a city like Seattle, is what you are looking for. "
4264043,43351891,2015-08-19,26285730,Mary,"This is a simple apartment, 10 minutes from Pike Place Market and 15 from Seattle Center. There is no wifi and no step free access. The room could be quite dark as the window view is obscured by a wall. "
4264043,44759492,2015-08-29,27741717,Nicole,Amy  was super accommodating to getting us into the apartment to leave our bags before check-in so we can go explore Seattle. Exactly as described. Nothing fancy but perfect location to just let everything. The place is very clean! Had a great time in Seattle 
4264043,46698855,2015-09-13,33368913,Jason,"First time using airbnb and it was a perfect experience.  Amy seemed very sweet, but we didn't have much communication because none was needed.  First time to Seattle for both my wife and I and if we went back this is the exact location we would want.  No bells and whistles in the apartment but had everything we needed.  Best value I could find.  Very very safe.  "
4264043,47150651,2015-09-16,21665400,Octavio,"Excellent location, easy check-in, place as described and great communication. Thanks again. I would definitely recommend this place! "
4264043,48165394,2015-09-24,24241192,Amber,"The place is exactly as described. Clean, neat, small and tidy. Really great value for money. We found the bed a little small for the two of us, but managed ok. 
The location is EXCELLENT! Close to the city, Pike Place, and the Space Needle. We also loved how it was a 5 minute walk to Belltown - it's a cool area with lots of bars and restaurants. 
Amy was a bit difficult to contact in the days leading up to our booking and as a new Airbnb'er I did get a little bit concerned that there was a problem. Luckily, Amy got back to me the day before we were due to hit Seattle and everything went to plan. "
4264043,48396922,2015-09-26,17105722,Danielle,Amy's place was great! It was exactly what I was looking for in regards to convenience and location. Space is bigger than depicted in the pictures as well. She communicated effectively as to how to check in etc. Make sure to go to the Dahlia Lounge across the street for the coconut cream pie! Was also a set for Sleepless in Seattle :)
4264043,49202855,2015-10-02,31174520,Carrie,Amy was very helpful! I arrived early and she allowed me to drop off my bags prior to the check-in time. She was very responsive to anything I needed. The location was perfect! It was a short walk to the convention center for work and very close to Pike Place Market. I was able to walk to anything I needed. 
4264043,50078499,2015-10-09,5897518,Marc,"It took a few tries before Amy sent us the information about how to get in, but once she did it was super clear and easy! The apartment is exactly as pictured: small, clean, quite. The apartment building is definitely dated which was a bit of a drawback. For the price and location it's unbeatable! "
4264043,50616119,2015-10-13,34989483,Samantha,"Was a great place to stay with charm. Was in an excellent location, in walking distance to most things. "
4264043,51110747,2015-10-18,179630,Joe,"We walked to everything, the Space Needle, Underground Tour, Pikes Market.  The apt. has no windows facing the street so it was fairly quiet.  The place could use a makeover though. The ceiling needs repainting and there was plaster falling off the bathroom wall.  

The Apt was clean and Amy was responsive.  "
4264043,51606875,2015-10-22,37228500,Timothy,"Wonderful experience! 
The apartment was very nice, clean, spacious. 
The location was great for walking around the city.
The host was very accommodating.
It was my first stay with AirBnB and not my last."
4264043,52036753,2015-10-26,13779026,Kate,Amy was very accommodating and let us drop our bags off early. The room was in a great location. Thanks! 
4264043,52588814,2015-10-31,1121558,Alison,"Everyone booking this Airbnb is doing it for the same reason - this is the cheapest entire apartment you can get at such a prime location in Downtown Seattle. It is therefore to be expected that it won't be perfect. Previous reviewers (myself included) were happy with their choice, but I think they glossed over some of the drawbacks. I'll focus on those to provide some insight that I feel is lacking.

Let's start with the good. This is a fantastic downtown location with easy access to SeaTac Airport via the LINK light rail. Amy was nice and on time to give me the keys. There is a coin-operated laundry room in the basement. Little amenities (e.g. shaving cream, umbrella) were a nice surprise. 

Now for the drawbacks. It's an old, worn apartment in a dire need of a renovation. I wouldn't call the decor cheerful . There is no thermostat in the unit, the temperature is set for the whole building and can be too low for some. The only window view you have is that of a concrete wall of the neighboring building. The neighbors can be loud at night. The lack of internet access wasn't a deal-breaker for me, but it's uncommon to see these days. 

For the price though, you can't beat it. If I'm in town for a conference again, this place will be on my list. If you are looking for a cheap, completely private place to stay at a great location in Seattle, and don't mind the trade-offs, it's a good choice. 

Ralph's Deli across the street is open late and it's convenient for picking up some basic necessities. Dan's Belltown Grocery on 3rd ave. is a slightly cheaper alternative. 

"
4264043,53953176,2015-11-15,37693488,Maria,"The best thing about this apartment is the location! It is in walking distance of almost all the touristy things in Seattle! 

The apartment itself is a little dated but overall it was great! Amy had it stocked with pretty much all the basic necessities. The bed was surprisingly comfortable as well. I would definitely stay here again! "
4264043,54576256,2015-11-22,34889701,Chris,A really great little place that is central to everything in seattle. Would definately recommend and stay again! Thanks Amy
4264043,54865686,2015-11-25,10061712,Luke,Great place to stay in Seattle!!!
4264043,55449001,2015-12-01,742512,Fiona,"Outstanding location, close to all the best sights Seattle has to offer...within a few short blocks of the monorail to the space needle, to Pike Place Market, Belltown and some of the best restaurants and bars in the city. Terrific value, considering cost of other places to stay in the immediate area. Very petite, best for one person."
4264043,56479569,2015-12-14,12857868,Carolyn,"I was very happy with this apartment--the location is excellent, particularly if you like really good restaurants. The room was clean and well furnished. Lots of space for storage, so I could really make myself at home. I hadn't noticed in the description that there wasn't an elevator. That was only an issue when I arrived and departed with my big suitcase! I'd definitely stay here again. "
6186081,35471848,2015-06-19,19235033,Billy,"This loft has a great location- right near Pikes Place and walkable distance to the space needle, very spacious for 1-2 people, also near great restaurants. Also has a great little balcony. Would stay here again- thanks!"
6186081,35664954,2015-06-21,32148390,Deirdre,"This loft was beyond our expectations.  Well laid out, clean and loved the view. The surrounding area is great, lots of restaurants and nightlife. This is my first experience using airbnb and won't be the last."
6186081,36534416,2015-06-29,32379077,Andrea,"We had a good experience at this location. I stayed here with 2 girlfriends. We had a small issue with the unit and Lee was incredibly quick to respond and resolve all issues. She was also fully available and answered any messages we sent her quickly.

Finally, you cannot beat the location. Minutes walk to both the Space Needle and Pike Place. We had no need of any taxis, except to go to the airport."
6186081,37698699,2015-07-09,34566818,Carl,"Lee did a nice job of prepping the unit. When I arrived on a hot day, at least for Seattle, there were fans and an A/C unit cooling the place down. A nice change from other condos I have stayed at in Seattle this summer, which had no such amenities. 

The guidebook to local eateries and activities was helpful, too. The view from the balcony was great, although I felt a little uneasy on such as narrow space. The shared balcony in the lobby on that floor was much grander, a great place for reading, lounging or having a BBQ (which was available for use). 

I used the gym on the 3rd floor once, and thought about using the pool later then forgot to do so. 

The neighborhood is great for lots of close by options, and the street life is lively after dark.  All in all this was a great experience for me. "
6186081,38120083,2015-07-13,32664258,Jose,"Lee did an amazing job with the place. It was very clean when we got there. She had some good suggestions in a little book. Great neighborhood, can walk everywhere and close to pike market. Try the bakery right by the place. Would definitely stay again. "
6186081,38596703,2015-07-17,11324554,Jeremy,"The loft was beautiful, quiet and ideally located. I regret not being able to stay longer."
6186081,39381934,2015-07-23,2806721,Elki,"Great location! Nice walkable neighborhood, the place was spacious and clean. Beautiful deck with amazing views. And a parking spot!"
6186081,39922368,2015-07-27,31689714,Grant,"Lee provided an excellent welcome book with helpful information about the condo and Seattle. Listing was very accurate. Very clean. Neighbourhood was perfect location to the market restaurants and stadiums.

Check-in was convenient and easy to come and go. "

6186081,44303169,2015-08-25,36913258,Marissa,the house is great. the location is near the pike place and room is clean and comfortable.
6186081,44571779,2015-08-27,6333068,Columba,Access was smooth & the property was clean & as described with a good location near the famers market.  It was useful to have the secure garage parking.  The cafe in the same building was great serving a fantastic breakfast.  Only downside was although being located on the 7th floor the noise at night from the street was quite loud due to the arrangement of the air conditioning.      
6186081,49834036,2015-10-06,501113,Malory,Great condo in a great location! Sarah was nice to let us into the unit early. The parking pass was an extra bonus and the bakery downstairs was awesome. Would stay again!
6186081,50352699,2015-10-11,45030906,Cintia,"First Seattle and Airbnb experience and loved it! The location was probably the best part. We were just walking distance to the market and Seattle center. The place was cozy and had enough space and kitchen for a 5 night stay. The only issue we had was at check in time. The cleaning lady arrived right at check in time so we ended up having to wait another hour to get settled in. Might have just been a small miscommunication. Other than that Sarah was a great host, she left easy instructions and was very responsive to texts. I recommend this Airbnb! "
6186081,51332730,2015-10-19,142230,Marisol,Sarah's apartment is a great place to stay in a great neighborhood. Everything I wanted to see and do was within walking distance. 
6186081,51633480,2015-10-22,17512728,Keith,"Sarah's apartment is in a fantastic location, particularly if you want to enjoy what Belltown has to offer (lots of bars and restaurants) and proximity to the nearby Bell Harbor conference center.  Bonus points for easy access to the running path along the harbor! Sarah was very accommodating with key pick up and drop off as well--she's a great host."
6186081,52096139,2015-10-26,34415338,Luca,"All perfect!
Small but very nice apartment in the center and very close to everything you need.
Mine was a business trip and this apartment works well also for that.
Super comfortable bed!! Very beautiful restaurant and pub in walking distance.
highly recommended!!!"
6186081,52903558,2015-11-02,20337427,Shanmuga,"Nice Compact APT,Great location and close to all main attractions.Sarah was helpful and interactions with her was pleasant."
6186081,54247408,2015-11-17,45859986,Andrew,"The unit was clean when we arrived. The neighborhood was great. Central to most tourist attractions in Seattle. Within walking distance of the Space Needle and surrounding sites as well as Pike Place, Seattle Aquarium, and even Century Link Field (about 30 minutes).
The parking was also a huge plus and a big draw for staying here. Parking can be a nightmare in Seattle (not to mention expensive).
This was my first experience with airbnb and if all visits turn out like this one, I'll definitely be using this service again."
6186081,54985028,2015-11-27,2538836,Jay,"sarah was a fantastic host.  the condo was as advertised, and included everything necessary for our 5-night stay.  great location as well.  would definitely consider staying again.  "
6186081,56188049,2015-12-10,22445411,Devon,"This place is awesome!! Great location in downtown, walking distance for a lot of attraction's. Nice, clean and very comfortable."
6186081,56870366,2015-12-19,47165551,Rochelle,"Sarah's apartment was exactly like how she has put up on the description and as seen on photos. I was pleasantly surprised by the detailed description and guide she has left me on the table upon entering the apartment.
APARTMENT: 
- clean and organised living space
- kitchen is fully functional and I was able to cook meals
- bathroom equipped with necessary essentials (shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, hair dryer, etc), water temperature and pressure are both great
NEIGHBOURHOOD: 
- safe and in walking distance to attractions such as the Space Needle and Pike Place market
- as mentioned in other comments, the street can get a little noisy at night but honestly that did not bother me at all
HOST: 
- I was able to check into the apartment smoothly following Sarah's detailed instructions sent to me via airbnb
- Sarah is always contactable whenever I needed her (there weren't things regarding the apartment that I needed her help with, it was more on administrative issues)

On a side note, I would suggest doing groceries at big markets. The grocery store on the same block, Belltown Market, is pretty pricy (though convenient) compared to even Pike Place Market.

All in all, her apartment would be my top choice for future visits to Seattle!"
6186081,58516299,2016-01-03,30095711,Yanzun,"This apartment is in a very great address, Facilities are very complete，the scenery is very beautiful."
51826,121909,2010-10-18,243023,Allie,"My stay at Graham's was simply wonderful. From the moment I arrived I felt completely at home, largely due to Graham's warm and welcoming personality.  The apartment is perfection - spacious, super clean, cozy fireplace, fully equipped kitchen, big private rooms, comfortable bed, etc. I could not have had a better experience. I only wish I stayed longer.
Fremont is a fabulous gem of a neighborhood.  Young, not-so-young, families, singles - there's tons to do for everyone (restaurants, bars, cafes, bookstores, parks, boutiques, chocolate, art, markets) with easy access to downtown.

Next time I'm in Seattle (soon, I hope!), I'm definitely staying here.  "
51826,131691,2010-11-01,271861,Wills,"Graham is an excellent host, a true local and world traveler.  My brother and I stayed at his place in Fremont and couldn't have been happier.  It is a 5 minute walk to a main bus line, only 15 minutes from downtown Seattle in a great neighborhood with tons to see in it's own right.  I highly recommend this location, house, and especially Graham."
51826,138495,2010-11-14,258912,Janet,A very gracious host; concerned with our comfort and satisfaction.
51826,139860,2010-11-15,16925,Sanya And,"THE place to stay in Fremont: Graham is welcoming and his attention to detail is impeccable. We've frequented Seattle quite a few times and this was by far one of the better stays. Book ahead of time though, we managed to squeeze ourselves in last minute, but that was happenchance. If you stay, please eat a Cubano sandwich for us as the place is closed on Sundays and we missed our chance... Thanks Graham!"
51826,147066,2010-11-30,81788,Jonathan,This is in fact an Awesome Fremont location. Really nice place. Really great price. Highly recommended. 
51826,179785,2011-02-08,338803,Ian,"Graham's place was great. He was an excellent host, even bringing me an extra iPhone charger when I realized I forgot to pack mine. Knew some great places for food too (that cuban was to die for). I can't imagine wanting to stay in an overpriced hotel in Seattle after staying with Graham. Hopefully I can do it again in the future so I can actually spend some time with my best friend and his new bride (they were pretty busy, what with the wedding and all, heh)."
51826,257052,2011-05-09,522212,James,"If you're lucky enough to find availability, book it now! Awesome condo and great location close to everything. I hope to stay again. Thank you so much for everything."

51826,268665,2011-05-17,571961,Jane,"We only stayed for one quick night but the whole place was absolutely lovely! Such a great area with so many cool things quite close. Graham created a fun paper with a list of closest coffee shop, sandwich shop, book store, Space Needle, etc. The room was just as nice as it is in the photos and the large closet was perfect for shoving our bags into. The kitchen had plenty of great tea and coffee and the living room was very inviting. Graham is an excellent host, welcoming, nice, and friendly. It was very easy and quick to get downtown or back to the location. I highly recommend staying here if you can! "
51826,269726,2011-05-18,548670,Michelle,Graham was a wonderful host.  His place is really nice and spotless.  We had everything we needed.  I only wish we could have stayed longer.
51826,272165,2011-05-20,534634,James,Great place to stay.  Very clean and comfortable and located in a great part of Seattle.  Will certainly stay there again.  Thanks!
51826,298080,2011-06-05,491944,Dave,"I could not have asked for a better place to stay. Graham's apartment incorporates the best parts of a hostel (stocked communal kitchen, friendly and interesting guests passing through, book exchange, impromptu conversations with strangers) into a private home. Graham himself is an friendly and generous host and a great guy to have a beer after a long day of work or exploring. He's got great stories and beautiful photos from his travels, he checks in regularly to make sure you're not wanting for anything in the apartment, and he's got great taste in places to check out around town. I stayed here for two weeks at the beginning of an internship for grad school, and I can honestly say that I felt as comfortable living here as I did back in my own apartment. I had friends over for dinner, commuting downtown by bike is real hoot in the mornings (and a solid workout in the evenings...hill...), and Fremont really is one of the best neighborhoods to stay in while you're in town. Cheers."
51826,306539,2011-06-10,395336,Linda,"Graham's ""Awesome Fremont Location"" was a great place to stay!  The rooms were neat, clean and QUIET!  Would definately return again in the future!!

51826,310580,2011-06-12,43316,Rachel ☺,"Graham's place is really really nice.
Very clean and neat.
10 minutes drive to downtown!
Would really recommend his place.
Graham himself was really nice and caring.
And he's a really talented photographer!
Just to see his photo's on the wall was worth it (;"
51826,319019,2011-06-17,526041,Delphine,"I stayed in this room for a week, commuting nicely to the University of Washington with bus 44 (30'). Graham gives you all the information you need beforehand and is totally available to answer questions. The bed is really comfortable, the room cozy and the floor has fluffy carpet. The kitchen is really fantastic (the floor there is wood). If you want to watch a movie, you can watch one of the ones in graham's vast collection. Seattle tends to be cloudy, but this whole apartment is full of light, I definitely recommend it!"
51826,342204,2011-06-29,588163,Lissi,"My husband and I were very impressed with the accommodations. Graham was an excellent host; the rooms are clean and well-appointed, and he makes a delicious cup of coffee too! The unique Fremont neighborhood  has some of the best bars and restaurants in town, and downtown Seattle is just a short bus ride away. You'll love it."
51826,356019,2011-07-06,489667,Samantha,"This was the best choice I could have made in a city I was barely familiar with. This location is all about location! Easy access to public transit or if you have a car it's in a great spot for sightseeing and playing! Also about a $5-&10 cab ride from local bars.

I would totally stay here again. The room was clean, quiet, private. And Graham is nice and very informative! This is a great choice of place to stay."
51826,358141,2011-07-07,429467,Joyce,"Graham was very inviting and friendly and showed us around the rooms and kitchen, then left us to enjoy with invite to call him with anything.  The rooms were pleasant and comfy and Uist.  The beds were lovely.  The killer toast and coffee and tea got us a good start and was delicious.  Thanks for a nice stay Graham . . .we enjoyed your photos!
"
51826,360937,2011-07-08,745976,Lindsay,"Graham was an excellent host! He gave me all the information I needed to arrive late in the day, with key code access. He was very welcoming and chatted with me for a few minutes after I arrived, telling me what restaurants were nearby and what he recommended. The entire place was very neat and well organized - no fumbling while looking for light switches or water glasses as he had everything labeled. The room was clean and very comfortable. I would have liked to stay longer and chat with Graham more (I really wish I hadn't bothered staying in a hotel my first night in Seattle!), but I had to leave very early the next morning. I would definitely recommend staying here and will certainly do so next time I am in Seattle."
51826,367933,2011-07-12,330472,Amber,"I stayed in Room 1 for three nights and it was a wonderful sanctuary. While I only met Graham briefly he was very welcoming and friendly and anxious to ensure that I was happy and comfortable. The bedroom and ensuite were lovely and clean and homey with loads of room. Fremont was a lovely area to explore, especially the Sunday markets. Thanks so much Graham, I'll be back!"
51826,373390,2011-07-14,200929,Janice,Graham is an awesome  host!  The rooms are perfect; location great.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a short or long term stay.  Fantastic!

It was nice to have privacy in such a great apartment.  Also, there was easy parking out front.  This is definitely a great value."
51826,379306,2011-07-17,819378,Keith,Graham has a beautiful home that was very modern and clean and probably the nicest bnb I've seen! Great easy access and parking out front I will definitely try to stay here again.
51826,379694,2011-07-18,568117,Jennifer,"Had a wonderful time. Graham was very helpful and friendly. As  other reviewers said, get the Cubano sandwich down the street. Only a short time there but will absolutely be coming back and staying at Graham's place."

51826,393038,2011-07-24,743630,Hisun,"Graham's place was squeaky clean, deco'ed with good taste, spacious with lots of natural light. It's so close to all the Fremont, Greenlake and Wallingford restaurants. Having an entry code assigned was really convenient to get in and out. My husband and I really enjoyed staying here. Will definitely come back. "
51826,401770,2011-07-28,290500,Liz,"Graham was a wonderful host. He gave us a lot of information about places to see and things to do and how to get around the Seattle area.
The accommodations are very comfortable and roomy and the neighborhood is quiet and cozy. There are stores and places to eat within a short walk. Easy to get around Seattle and the area from here by car as well. Would love to come back sometime!"
51826,404910,2011-07-29,720431,Tobi,"Excellent place to stay and AMAZING bang for your buck.  You get your own private room with en suite bathroom - the kitchen and living room area is spacious and perfectly furnished for guests to make themselves at home.  Graham is a great guy, extremely welcoming and friendly - he even helped us out with some camping gear for the rest of the trip.  Definite recommend"
51826,414318,2011-08-02,636295,Jessica,"A fantastic stay; just what I needed.  Graham was perfectly present without being intrusive.  The bed was super comfy and I felt safe enough to sleep well from the first night.  Great food, coffee, bus stops and a grocer all within easy walking distance.  I would stay again and refer any friend or family member without hesitation."
51826,418071,2011-08-03,848363,Suzanne,"Our stay at Graham's house was the best rest we got in Seattle. The neighborhood was sooo quiet and convienent to the grocery store restaurants and even a 21/2 mile walk (dwn hill) to enterprise to get our car. It was nice to have a private bath and fabulosooo linens.The host was very helpful in directions and sugestions. Would have stayed another night but he was (to no surprise) BOOKED. Darn.

51826,445391,2011-08-15,101445,Sharon/Richard,"Great location in the fabulous Fremont neighborhood. Lovely, newer fresh feeling townhouse, quiet, private, very comfortable. Graham's beautiful photos grace the walls and he is a warm and generous host. His kitchen is clean and spacious and he is kind enough to share it with guests. He provided bicycle parking in the garage, was friendly, helpful and informative. I also liked his sweet clean calm dog named Sophie though only saw her on the main floor a few times. Hot here the first week (yes, even in Seattle) and the flow of air through screened windows and the quiet fan in this third floor bedroom/bath handled it very well. Would stay here again without hesitation."
51826,454481,2011-08-17,949143,Sherah,Graham is a great host with a great place in a great location! Highly recommended and would return.
51826,463334,2011-08-21,907330,Sharon,"This was a perfect place for us to escape the insanity of a family wedding, close enough to walk to the locations we needed, and super easy. I particularly liked the use of door codes rather than keys, since then we had one less thing to worry about carrying. Thanks for everything, Graham - the coffee was great... I only wish I'd had more time to drink it!"
51826,473160,2011-08-24,971161,Predrag,"We had a great stay at Graham's place! The room was clean and comfortable (as was the whole apartment!). Graham was a great host, very welcoming and accessible and open for questions. The location is minutes drive from best of Seattle. I wouldn't hesitate coming here again when I'm in Seattle next time. "
51826,474727,2011-08-25,341248,Laura,"Wish I could have stayed longer. Graham is a superb host, and his place is fabulous:  comfortable bed, great location, easy and gracious check-in..... will definitely stay here again if I can! Thank you, Graham!"
51826,480389,2011-08-27,164735,Ryanne,"Graham was a lifesaver and accepted my very last minute request!  His place was clean, comfortable, and in a great location and he made me feel very welcome!"
51826,482949,2011-08-29,451852,Candice,"Graham was the perfect host, providing clear information we would need regarding our stay, checking up on the status of our arrival and being available to assist us if needed but at the same time feel like we were in our own space during the time we were there. The setup provided everything we needed, including the opportunity to cook and meeting others staying in the second unit and comparing notes on our stay was a pleasant experience as well. Thanks Graham for the opportunity to stay in such a wonderful, convenient location! "
51826,496137,2011-09-02,947805,Daniel,"Incredible city, room and host. Graham was not only very helpful but overall a very nice person. Great coffee was a plus!

Amazing experience which I'd definately do again."
51826,503096,2011-09-05,194346,Mike,"We were impressed with our stay at Graham's Fremont apartment - the price per room is great value considering the location, cleanliness, private bathroom, and great hospitality that Graham offered. We would definitely recommend his place to friends and will look up this listing next time we're in Seattle. 

Thanks Graham!"
51826,519584,2011-09-10,1120395,Marci,"Great place to stay!!! Graham is a great host, would definitely recommend  his place if your coming to Seattle!  "
51826,528360,2011-09-13,407256,A.T.,"Graham is a professional host, so expect nothing but the best. If he doesn't offer you one of his waffles for breakfast, ask him; they're really good. "
51826,547799,2011-09-19,461911,Marty,"Graham's place was just what I needed for my weekend in Seattle.  Very comfortable, quiet, and a great location."
51826,566916,2011-09-25,1169505,Ehud,"Graham hosts a really great place in the Fremont area of Seattle. Conveniently located a block away from great eateries and coffee, and a solid market if you want to buy groceries for the house. Two bus-lines come within 2 blocks of the house to pretty much get you anywhere in Seattle. Prices reasonable for a really nice place. Finally, Graham was extremely willing to answer questions and was easy to get in touch with. Definitely look him up for your stay."
51826,589773,2011-10-02,1136073,Joel,Great Location.  Very comfortable.  Definitely will try to stay here when  we are back in Seattle.
51826,12797988,2014-05-11,156792,Sandra,"Nice location, good space & host - Graham was there to welcome me (even though I think that I was late); he is, smart, engaging & friendly - he is also responsive to renter's needs/desires. Staying at his place was mostly like having my own townhouse in Seattle (with nearby cafes, grocery & cool neighborhood haunts). The place is airy, the room is a decent size with all the amenities that you could want; bed is comfy and the neighborhood is quiet so you feel at home when you're done running around. Loved the location; you can explore Fremont and other nearby neighborhoods or head down town in a jiffy. I'd recommend it to a friend."
51826,13011604,2014-05-17,13044952,Lydia,"The location was awesome and we really enjoyed the Fremont neighborhood. We went to the Chocolate Factory, and did a wine tasting at a tasting room for WA wines, plus went to a couple nearby restaurants. We wished we had more time to try more of the restaurants and coffeeshops.  Its walking distance to lots of great places and a grocery. 
The house was very pleasant and the private room with attached bathroom was very comfortable. The kitchen had everything we needed and we cooked breakfast in the mornings.
Graham gave us some great recommendations, especially for a hike to Serene Lake outside of Seattle that was one of the highlights of our trip. "
51826,19256708,2014-09-08,20778722,Susan,The reservation was canceled 16 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
51826,19287705,2014-09-09,20279973,Russell,"Graham was an excellent host. He maintained consistent communication. He provided great hospitality which included a bagel breakfast with coffee, and restaurant recommendations within the area. The house is spectacular with a private bathroom in the bedroom, large living room, and beautiful kitchen. The place was furnished with the essential items. I was impressed by the cleanliness of the entire house. Overall, I enjoyed my stay with Graham at this location. Thanks Graham!"
51826,19744949,2014-09-17,7966986,Timothy,"Great location, great host. Graham is super friendly, and has plenty of suggestions to get you started if you're there to explore the area. Location is very conveniently located-- Quick/easy walk to great places to eat or grab coffee & work, and I'd often walk just a bit further to ""downtown"" Fremont for microbreweries/even more places to work. Also very easy (literally, down the street) access to SR-99 if you want to drive to downtown Seattle etc. 

Clean room, comfortable bed, bathroom/closet in-room, and door code to get in.  It's like having your own townhouse. Would definitely stay here again."
51826,20047869,2014-09-22,20913896,Brian,"While my wife and I did not actually meet Graham or Maria due to opposite schedules, Graham was easy to contact via text message and responded to texts promptly.  The room is definitely as advertised with its own private bathroom, everything was clean, and access to the home via the electronic keypad was very easy.  Our only complaint, and it may have been due to long days and getting back to the room late, was that parking was somewhat difficult to find.  We lucked out the first night of our stay and found a spot right in front of the house, but the next night we had to drive around the neighborhood for about 20 minutes before finding a spot, and if cars are parked on both sides of the street, it effectively becomes a one lane road.  That is no fault of Graham or Maria, but might be something to consider if you have a larger car.  Aside from the parking we had no complaints and wouldn't have a problem staying with Graham and Maria again."
51826,20515491,2014-09-30,521814,Zoe,"Great overall experience.  Beautiful, big place.  Quiet, comfortable room.  Nice bed.  Never met the host.  Private bathroom was wonderful to have.  Shower could have been cleaner, but besides that awesome!"
51826,20927952,2014-10-07,14929922,Andrea,"Wonderful space, clean, private, quiet, easy to contact, friendly and comfortable. I had to extend my reservation by a day and they were very accommodating."
51826,21732166,2014-10-22,12516338,Mark,"Really fun neighborhood, near the exciting Fremont area! The room was great, there was a desk, a private bathroom, clean sheets, towels, shampoo -- it was just like staying in a hotel!

I didn't get to meet Graham & Maria when I was there unfortunately, but on the positive side things were very quiet around the house!"
51826,40522992,2015-07-31,12322470,Jiaojiao,"I had a great stay at Graham's house. It's beautiful and clean and quiet. I was able to get a lot of work done. My private room and bath are very nice. The place is also very conveniently located, a couple of blocks walk to public transportation and lots of great restaurants and shops. About 10-15 minutes walk to lake Union and green lake for great views and jogging. Graham was very nice and hospitable. He helped with my luggage and provided fresh fruits daily. Highly recommended."
51826,43554576,2015-08-20,40688813,Marcin,"TL;DR Everything was great! Fully recommend!
The home was very nice and clean. Rooms have private bathrooms which makes is feel almost like a little hotel. Graham was very helpful and friendly. The funny thing is that we have never met personally, since we were both very busy at this period. Nevertheless he contacted me couple of time to check if everything is fine and even provided some food and beverages. The front door have key code lock which eliminates the need for a physical key which is very convenient."
51826,43886804,2015-08-22,2699087,Patrick,The property was very nice and in a fun location. Cool cafe and bar food around the corner. Graham even picked me up from the airport. It was a last minute book and he accommodated me fine. Other guest in the property was pleasant and rarely saw her. It was nice that Graham made terrific coffee for me. The place came stocked with bagels and cream cheese. Yum! 
51826,45035826,2015-08-30,8539588,Jeff,"
Graham and Maria's place was perfect!  I contacted them last minute which is always a risk. They responded promptly and had all the particulars well spelled out and easy to follow. In the funky Freemont district.   Room was perfect and the bed so comfortable that I didn't want to leave in the morning!  Highly recommend this unit. "
51826,45339988,2015-09-01,2961871,Sarah,"Maria and Graham's place is so beautiful! It's a modern, light filled townhouse right in the middle of the Fremont with easy access to cafes, restaurants, public parks, breweries, and everything else that residential Seattle has to offer. The room itself is sunny, comfortable, and has all the amenities you could possibly want. Fresh towels, lots of storage, even an iphone charger by the bed and a tube of toothpaste in the bathroom. Kitchen is well stocked with snacks and breakfast things, and there's even soymilk and beer in the fridge. I loved reading on the little patio and smelling the tall pines outside. So lovely!"
7403174,39695731,2015-07-25,38800867,Dave,Colette and Bruce are such wonderful hosts! They helped us get settled in quickly and everything was great! Their house is wonderful and a very relaxing place! Would definitely stay again! 
7403174,40269616,2015-07-29,32883361,Ching,"First of all, the is truly a ""whole house"" unlike most others who only provide part of the house with separate entrance where you still know/hear hosts living next to you. We share similar philosophy of life with the hosts which makes Colette's house home away from home for us. The first thing we did was to go out to the backyard and hug those lively cedar trees. Drinking hot tea at covered patio while enjoying a serene morning starts each happy day. The hosts practice recycling too, and provide varieties of organic tea and coffee that we also enjoy at home. My wife really loved the yoga stretch chair in the living room where she practiced yoga at night. The two large skylights in kitchen and dining areas brighten our days and make breakfast so much more enjoyable. Overall, we fully relaxed and rested well every night as if we were at home."
7403174,40654399,2015-08-01,17765386,Barry,"Colette and Bruce are very friendly host, they have a wonderful house with big & beautiful trees, fully equipped kitchen, fridge, coffee maker, washing machine and even Netflix, our family of 4 enjoyed staying at their house."
7403174,43657269,2015-08-21,38688114,Sabine,"We really enjoyed our stay at Colettes home. We were warmly welcomed, it felt cosy, there was lots of space, perfect location for all kind of trips. Thank you so much."

7403174,44578253,2015-08-27,27898206,Winnie,"Colette's home was beautiful and my parents greatly enjoyed their stay. She was communicative and responsive, and very welcoming. My mom was a big fan of the meditation room!"
7403174,45116123,2015-08-31,39402093,Grant,"Colette and Bruce have such a beautiful house. It was beyond amazing. The bed was so nice and comfortable, they have such a nice big yard, everything about the house was just so warm and welcoming. The neighborhood was very peaceful and nice and getting to and from downtown was very quick and easy. This was our first time renting a house from the site and I was a bit worried, But the experience we had from this was just SO fantastic. We will be back in Seattle next year for the convention and we would LOVE to and hopefully will be renting this place again. We couldn't be happier with this whole experience, Thank you so much Colette and Bruce.  "
7403174,45597365,2015-09-04,1539012,Jennifer,"My family stayed in Colette & Bruce's house on their recent trip to Seattle for a campus tour. The house was lovely, just as described and in a fantastic location. Colette & Bruce were freindly hosts and the trip went very smoothly.

Thanks to both Colette & Bruce for the hospitality while my family was visiting the area!"
7403174,46148344,2015-09-08,63418,Ian,"The home actually was even bigger than expected, quiet street with easy parking, and a very comfortable stay. Colette was good about checking in to arrange key exchange and was accommodating for our weird, wedding-related timetable. Great overall experience."
7403174,46542530,2015-09-11,25154096,HanByul,"The place was much more than I expected. Behind the front door, I found a genuine home as if I had visited my mother's home. I loved the tall tree in the spacious garden. On the second day morning, I went out for a walk around the neighbourhood which was very calm and green. On the way back, I met people in the neighbourhood greeted me with a kind smile. The location is best. It is not far from downtown nor too close that fifteen minutes' drive took me to hot places. Above all, Colette and Bruce were so kind and considerate that I had no inconvenience at all. Thank you so much, Colette and Bruce. "
7403174,46906933,2015-09-14,40449808,Xiaojing,We just love love love Colette's house. It is so big and full of her family's memories but very neat and well organized. Our little girl liked the Piano very much. And the big ceder trees in the garden and the community impressed us! We also like the  outdoor fireplace a lot and spent a lot of things me around there. The location of the house is very convenient for driving to attractions or shopping malls. Definitely will recommend friends stay here when they visit Seattle!
7403174,48016886,2015-09-22,831219,Laura,Loved the house. The whole experience was very easy and organized. The house was convenient to everything in Seattle. Highly recommended. 
7403174,51286409,2015-10-19,1173500,Jen,"This was an oasis in a busy week.  Colette and Bruce's home is tranquil, comfortable and perfectly located.  We loved the neighborhood and really appreciated the clear instructions on everything in the house.  We really enjoyed meeting both Colette and Bruce, we had so much in common and that made us feel even more at home.  This was a stay full of comfy amenities (coffee, tea, laundry etc.) and immense beauty.  We absolutely recommend staying here, it will refresh your soul during travel!  We hope to be back again someday soon."
7403174,54930244,2015-11-25,13649276,Judy,We had a great stay - the location was great...a quiet street but close to main roads. The amenities were so (email hidden)ke a home away from home!!! Couldn't have asked for more!
7403174,56022004,2015-12-08,91995,Lucy,"Colette's home was very peaceful and comfortable. We appreciated the thoughtful instructions, cozy fireplace, and all her beautiful plants. Wish we could have used the fun backyard but it was pouring all weekend so we never had a chance. On the flip side, the rain sounded lovely on the skylights in the kitchen. 
We loved how the location was easy access to the rest of Seattle but felt very quiet and un-citylike. 
Thanks so much for a great stay!"
7403174,58551544,2016-01-03,47734559,Diane,"The neighborhood was very quiet.  The yard looked lovely; however, it was cold and we did not use the yard."
7153101,38220827,2015-07-13,37695098,Sarah,"Rory was extremely welcoming and accommodating during my stay. He was thoughtful and generous with offering to show me around and made sure I felt comfortable in the room. I was out of the house for most of the stay, but we got along so well that I ended up tagging along with him and his friends one night and they were great people! The townhouse and the room were clean and his dog was very friendly. If you're not a dog person, you will be after meeting her! I am a first time airbnb user but this experience has made me a customer for life. I would definitely recommend renting with Rory! "
7153101,39103839,2015-07-20,31368022,Mehdi,"Rory is a very hospitable, helpful and nice person. We went for dinner together and I got good suggestions from him how to spend time in Seattle and he told me about tourist attractions of Seattle. 

The location of the apartment is awesome and the neighborhood is very good. It is a few minutes of walking from the University of Washington campus and also very close to great restaurants and grocery stores. 

Generally I had a great experience in his apartment and I totally recommend others to choose Rory's place in Seattle. "
7153101,39846610,2015-07-26,6982885,Katherine,Rory was very friendly and welcoming.  I appreciate his flexibility on check-in time as I arrived later than planned.  The air mattress was comfy and stayed firmly inflated all night.  Thanks for the hospitality!
7153101,41147110,2015-08-04,35343591,Sang,"This was my first time visiting Seattle and I really enjoyed my stay! Rory was very friendly and welcoming. He made sure I was comfortable and the room wasn't too hot, etc. The room & his townhouse overall was very clean. The townhouse is located in a very nice neighborhood next to UW. I felt pretty comfortable walking around at night. Out of many positive things, having a private bath attached to the bedroom was a big plus for me. His golden retriever is also adorable & super sweet! I would definitely recommend renting with Rory:)

7153101,42020944,2015-08-10,37731376,Gavin,"Really convenient location, there are buses everywhere close by to go to downtown and coming back to house. Rory gave me some very good advices on where to go and he was very helpful when there are some troubles. The ensuite is modern and clean, with everything you need in the kitchen. Absolutely recommend to stay here if you are travelling to Seattle."
7153101,42496622,2015-08-13,41079685,Ryan,"Rory was a great host!  He was out of town for my stay, but he made sure I had everything I needed, and that I was able to check in with no issues.  His place is nicely located with easy access to everywhere I planned on going.  Good spot if you want to check out both the North and South parts of Seattle.  Rory keeps his place very clean, but not so pristine that you feel like you have to watch everything you touch.  Was a very comfortable place, and way nicer that where I live.  Although I didn't cook, Rory gave me free range to use any food & utensils in the house which was more than generous.  I hope to visit again and actually get to meet Rory next time.  Overall I had a great experience!"

Comfortable room with private bath was perfect for what I was looking for, a temporary place to call home while I looked for something more permanent. Any concerns about the dog were quickly alleviated when I met Bear. The most mellow, sweet dog I think I ever met! Thanxs Rory and Bear!"
7153101,47093014,2015-09-15,14190252,Terry,A nice townhouse close to UW. Our host was very accommodating to our needs. Quiet respite among the hubbub of UW. Walk to Ivars on the water for a seattle experience.
7153101,50227542,2015-10-10,42041700,Guanlun,"Rory is very helpful and polite. The location of the house is 5 minutes drive from the university and about 10 minutes drive from downtown without traffic. The kitchen has everything you need and the house is clean and quite. If only anything is not to your satisfaction, just ask Rory and he will help you out. A good experience!"
7153101,50723519,2015-10-13,36240965,Anna,"This was my first time visiting Seattle and using Air bnb. I was traveling alone as well so I was really nervous at first. The moment I met Rory all worry went away. My flight got delayed so I was there alot later then I anticipated and a bit stressed because of it, but Rory was accommodating and was there waiting for me to check in. He also helped me with my luggage and gave me a tour of the place. The place was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. He even had a blow dryer, shampoo, conditioner, body wash...ect. All the things a girl would need. He went above and beyond. His house is located in a great neighborhood. I didnt have trouble getting around at all. He is centrally located and close to so many cool things, as well as downtown where all the tourist attractions were. I didnt get the chance to go hiking but he also went out of his way to print different hike options for me just incase I decided to. All and all Rory was a great host, very welcoming and kind. I felt safe, and he was easy to talk to, it was like staying with one of my buddys. I would definitely recommend renting with Rory. He made me feel like I was at home. Also Bear his dog was so cute and sweet and would greet me at the door. Him having a dog was a bonus! :)"
7153101,51242316,2015-10-18,37934920,Paul,"Great memory foam mattress made for a great night's sleep, and the en suite bathroom is very nice to have and modern. Ability to do laundry easily was a great plus also. Perfect stop on my way, and I could imagine being quite comfortable if I had needed to book multiple nights. Thanks!"
7153101,51388293,2015-10-19,45289915,Shanna,"Our experience with Rory was great! His communication leading up to our trip was outstanding and he was very helpful! We walked from his place to husky stadium (only 15 minute). The location was perfect! Also, the bed was extremely comfortable! Thank you Rory!"
7153101,51559375,2015-10-21,26881449,Tim,"Rory was a great communicator and ensured we both had all the necessary details.  His home is beautiful, well cared for, and very convenient.  I took a quick cab ride to U of Washington each day I was there and walked home.  Rory's set up is perfect - really nice bed and a private bathroom -- all really clean and attractive.  This is a great spot if you're in the Seattle area!"
7153101,51784077,2015-10-24,19253309,Jim,"Rory's place is excellent if you're visiting Seattle! His apartment is located right next to UW's campus in a great neighborhood, and the bed in the guest room is so comfortable that I asked him about the brand and where he purchased it from. Easy to check in/out, and overall a superb value."
7153101,52429311,2015-10-29,6653747,Ricardo,"Everything was great, as advertised. Rory made sure to make me feel welcome and like at home away from home. Bear, the dog, is amazing and well  behaved.

The room was clean and Rory supplied everything that i needed for my stay (towels, shampoo, toilette paper, etc). I love that the room has its private bathroom, a definite plus against other listings.

 i didnt spend much time at Rory´s but when i was there i sure felt at home. The TV and cable system is a great plus for watching a movie or a game (during my stay i got to watch game 1 of world series and MNF).

the neighborhood is amazing, just a 10 minute drive from downtown and 15 minute walk from University of Washington. Rory provided me with a list of atractions to see in the city and nice recommendations for restaurants and places to get a drink.

Conclusion: great location, great host and great house! I will definitely stay here during my next visit to Seattle.

Thanks, Rory!"
7153101,52523957,2015-10-30,44962104,Falon,"Rory made my stay so carefree and easy by anticipating my needs and having everything set up for me when I arrived. There was already an ironing board and iron in the room along with an entire packet he had personally assembled for places to go: restaurants, sightseeing, etc. I arrived in the evening, after a long day, and caught up with Rory in his kitchen while having the best takeout thai from his neighborhood. The location is great. It's right down the street from UW and everything is within walking distance. Oh, and did I mention he has great smelling candles! :) Staying here is an easy choice and definitely a great deal for what it offers! "
7153101,53296069,2015-11-07,23314196,Raul,"Rory was a great host: polite, accommodating and overall a chill and pleasant person to talk to.

7153101,53763621,2015-11-12,41156351,Minh-Duc,Rory's is located in the most convenient place possible for an interview visit at UW. About 10 min walk into campus and restaurants around the area. He also put together a list of place to visit and eateries around Seattle. He is easy to talk to and a funny host. Make me feel very comfortable away from home. The bed is the most comfortable compared to my own bed at home and other Airbnb places that I have been to. I would high recommend staying at Rory's place 
7153101,53927824,2015-11-14,37897626,Reese,"Rory was very nice, room very clean and comfortable.  Neighborhood was very comfortable.  Difficult to find entrance to house -- worth getting a map from Rory in advance.  Strongly recommended.  "
7153101,54141901,2015-11-16,26223101,Anthony,Rory was great.  Made me feel welcomed. His room was on the top floor and was clean and quiet.   I would stay here again.
7153101,54301902,2015-11-17,14842770,Pupon,Rory was such a great host. Very laid back and very easy to talk to. He provided us with a list of all the spots to check out for the night we stayed at his place. 
7153101,54460064,2015-11-20,35477931,Aki,"Rory and Bear, his sweet dog, were great hosts. Nice clean place in a great location. Walking distant to many neat places around the city or short Uber ride. Super comfy bed. Highly suggest checking out the bfast/brunch place he recommends. That was yummy!! "
7153101,54812021,2015-11-23,47481085,Serene,"Rory was a great host!  Tried very hard to accommodate us and make sure our experience was good.  I would say it was a little pricey, but overall a good short stay. "
7153101,55067536,2015-11-27,29637694,Qiyue,"Rory's house is really nice, three floor compact but delicate apartment with everything equipwd. Rory was there check in for me when I arrived, he show me around the house, also give me a lot of good recommendations for my Seattle trip. I enjoy this wonderful experience so much. If you plan to visit Seattle, definitely check out Rory's house."

7153101,55615429,2015-12-03,47781894,Patrick,"I had a fantastic stay with Rory. He greeted me when I arrived and gave me a tour of his beautiful home. The private bedroom/bathroom I stayed in were clean, private, modern, and spacious.  

When I was around the house, I was able to catch a football game in the living room (the couch is comfortable and the 55"" television picture quality was awesome), and get work done in the bedroom. It was really nice to be able to do laundry during my stay, since I was traveling to another destination after leaving Seattle. Having Bear around was a nice bonus—she's cute and friendly, and I was extra-sad when I left. 

The location is outstanding. I walked to my meetings on the UW campus, since it is so close. The other places I visited around Seattle were accessible by walking, bus, or a short taxi/Uber ride. Rory gave me some great suggestions for dining options, which were all within walking distance of his home. "
7153101,55748364,2015-12-05,6697169,Ashley,Rory is a perfect host! His house is great and he makes himself readily available for any questions you could have as a visitor but also respects your privacy and space. I would definitely recommend him and would stay at his place again. Bear is also a cute plus! :) 
7153101,56133872,2015-12-09,46425348,Alex,Rory was a very thoughtful and accommodating host. He provided a list of nearby restaurants and activities that turned out to be fun. He's a nice guy and I enjoyed talking with him and his visiting friends during my stay. The bedroom and bathroom were clean and neat.

The accommodations were clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay with them again if I'm in Seattle.

7748905,46428128,2015-09-10,42808423,Brandon,"Joshua and David were very welcoming and accommodating when my friends and I arrived. They invited us in and gave us a run down of the apartment of what we could/could not use and where everything was located (pretty much everything was available for use). Everything listed in the description was provided and the bed was very comfortable. Conor, the boxer, was probably the best host of the three. Conor was very friendly and calm throughout our stay. Both Joshua and David were knowledgeable about Seattle and gave my friends and I some places to visit during our stay. 

The decor of the apartment was very modern with cool neutral colors all throughout. There was plenty of natural light that came through from the windows which made the entire apartment very inviting. The location of the apartment wasn't too far from Pike Place Market where the Original Starbucks is located if you don't mind a nice 20 minute walk around Seattle (I walk pretty fast). 

I would definitely stay with them again if I get to chance to.  "
7748905,46816327,2015-09-13,2638706,Steffen,"Joshua and David are great hosts. We stayed with them for two nights in their lovely and well decorated apartment. The apartment is very clean and in walking distance to downtown.
We enjoyed our stay a lot and would definitely recommend to anybody to stay with Joshua , David and Connor."

There is also a lot of things to do in Capitol Hill as well. My husband and I had a great time visiting Seattle. Thank you, Joshua."
7748905,47848924,2015-09-21,38293722,Leigh,"Joshua was a wonderfully warm host. He's an excellent communicator - explained the home layout when we first came in and allowed us full access including laundry. He even had mini shampoos and waters out for us in the guest room. 
The bed was so comfortable!
Joshua's home is a gem in a quiet Seattle neighborhood that is in a very convenient location to city hot spots and tourist destinations. 
And his pup Conor is a sweetheart!
We were very happy with our stay and our friendly host. "

Joshua was a great host and his ""Recommended Spots"" map was incredibly helpful! I believe everywhere we ate/got cocktails was on the list and not one of them disappointed. Also, Conor is a lovable and very well-behaved dog, he was a lot of fun to have around!"
7748905,49459023,2015-10-04,41972551,Martin,"Everything was wonderful. The Apartment is in a good location to exolore Seattle, was clean and stylish.

7748905,49790197,2015-10-06,42027901,Zach,"Joshua and David's apartment was the best place we could have found in Seattle. They know what it means to host, and are as welcoming as you could ask for. If you don't like super nice people and extremely friendly dogs, then this may not be a good fit for you. If you do like those things, you've done enough searching."
7748905,50008011,2015-10-08,43963462,Vivienne Jia,"I enjoyed the stay at Joshua and David's apt pretty much. Their home was clean and comfortable, a bus stop situated nearby. Joshua and David are really nice and welcoming. The most l loved is their dog, Conner, which is super friendly and made my heart melting. Their new family member, a tiny kitten, is super cute as well! This was my first airbnb experience and I am pleased that Joshua and David were the host."
7748905,51352281,2015-10-19,35498073,Rachel,"Joshua and David made us feel so welcomed! The guest room was beautiful and so clean. They left us some water, glasses, shampoo and other toiletries, towels, and a map of Seattle. Conor is the sweetest dog! We loved the hospitality, the apartment, and the super comfortable guest bed. It was about 12 minutes away from Pike's Place and 25 minutes away from the airport so it was a perfect location. We loved our stay in Seattle!"
7748905,51775135,2015-10-24,4680790,Janice,"It was an absolute delight staying at Joshua and David's. The whole apartment was very tasteful and the room and washroom were very clean and cozy. Joshua and David were great hosts and the pets were amazing. Location was great as well, as it was 15 min or so away from downtown. "

7748905,53488041,2015-11-09,14442556,Ricardo,"My boyfriend and I had a great time at Joshua and David's! Joshua was a great host (David was away on a trip) and even when we were not at home he would send us texts with tips and excellent restaurant recommendations! 
Their place is located close to the Capitol District, which is a really cool area of town (bars, pubs, restaurants, coffee shops). We would definitely want to stay with the boys again in the (website hidden): Their dog is really friendly!"

7748905,55107198,2015-11-28,44995995,Hilary,"Joshua and David were pleasant hosts.  Joshua was very patient and accommodating; both were very sympathetic to our needs (bathroom use, tv use, laundry, heat), especially with it being around the holiday.  The room, and house at large, was very stylish and clean.  The neighborhood was fine- we ubered to most places between $8-$16.  They gave us lots of on-the-spot recommendations for things to do and I enjoyed stimulating conversation with them when time permitted.  Finally, their dog was so calm and sweet. The kitten was fiery but cute."
7748905,55791740,2015-12-06,2892748,Dan,"Joshua wasn't around much and neither were we so, we didn't get to meet. The room was clean and the neighborhood is quiet. We found a couple good little coffee shops within walking distance and took uber downtown so, it's a good spot to stay and is pretty close to everything. I'd stay here again for sure. 
Thanks dudes!"

It was an extremely welcoming home with cozy feels starting right at the door, which we decorated with a Christmas wreath. Their pets Conor and figoro were so cute and friendly. Joshua was extremely nice and accommodating and provided great restaurant suggestions. The location is great, so we were able to über everywhere for cheap.  The bed is really comfortable and the room was provided with water and mints. I totally recommend their place if you're in the Seattle area!"
7748905,57138715,2015-12-22,45950154,Natasha,Josh and David made my first Airbnb experience as well as my first trip to Seattle so wonderful. The location was in the perfect stop and central to all major locations. They are such a sweet couple and their pets made the trip so much more enjoyable! I recommend this place to anyone looking for an easy-going stress free trip!
2943860,13448263,2014-05-27,15610619,Claudia,The apartment is great and in a great location. Rebecca's attention was excellent! I would definitely go back!
2943860,14623251,2014-06-23,5612574,Stephanie,"Rebecca was very helpful, courteous, and responsive. My friends and I spent a weekend in Seattle, and the flat was in a great location. Upon entering the main building, we were a bit worried about the condo itself; however, the place was spacious, very clean, comfortable, and it had everything we needed. "
2943860,16474984,2014-07-28,16720183,Wes,"Our stay was great. The home was clean and comfortable. It was convieniently located to shopping and public transportation, giving us a true Seattle experience. We would definitely stay here again. "
2943860,20032570,2014-09-22,20532229,Julian,Thank you for the stay. The apartment was fantastic and the location was central to all the places we wanted to go to. Seattle was a wonderful city and would recommend to visit and stay here again. Thanks!
2943860,20526614,2014-09-30,14750336,Lucy,"We had a great stay in Seattle.  We were traveling with a 9-week old infant and it was really nice to be able to come back to an apartment rather than a hotel room, so this place met our needs, which was wonderful.

Doug, our host at the building, was very helpful and kind.  Our flight was cancelled and then there was traffic around the airport and he was very flexible regarding our arrival/ check-in, which was a relief.  During check in he showed us around the apartment and told us how to get downtown, etc.  He was very friendly.

The apartment had been accurately represented in the photos.  There was a big bedroom with a king sized bed as well as two twin beds in the common area of the apartment for additional guests.  The beds were comfortable and we all slept well.  There was also a fold-out sofa bed, but we didn't use that, so can't comment on its comfort.  The beds had a sheet and a top hotel cover (you know, the polyester blankets that you take off the bed as soon as you arrive because you know they never get washed).  While we were warm enough (it was in the 70s during the day) we were sort of disappointed there weren't proper blankets with covers on them that were probably not washed regularly.  There were plenty of pillows.

The apartment is on the 14th floor above the I-5 freeway, so it has a great view of downtown, but even with the windows closed its pretty loud because of the traffic.  That said, its a freeway, so it is the ultimate white noise machine.  In other words, its background noise and not like other loud city noises like sirens or garbage trucks.

The apartment met our needs.  It had a full kitchen as promised (plates, bowls, flatware, glasses, mugs, stove, fridge, microwave, etc.).  Although there were recycling and compost dumpsters in the basement, the apartment only had one trash can for landfill trash, so we separated our own garbage and took it down to make sure things got in the right place.  There were plenty of towels and it was great to have two bathrooms. 

The whole place was carpeted (except for bathrooms and kitchen, of course).   While the building hallways smelled of smoke, the apartment didn't smell of smoke or anything else.  It was clean.
The apartment itself was functional and in good condition, but if you're looking for something modern then this might not be the place for you.  The faucet in the kitchen was leaking a little, some of the cabinet doors in the kitchen were in disrepair, the swamp cooler connection to the window was not done by a professional.  It seemed expensive ($367/ night) to me given the parts of the apartment that had seen better days.

I would recommend this place if you need something near downtown and aren't looking for anything fancy."
2943860,29770937,2015-04-12,29689453,Aaron,"Doug made everything easy! He provided all the information we needed for the place including places to go to, stores restaurants and how to get there.  The apartment was just as listed. And the neighborhood was great! It was right in the middle of everything and easy walking distance.  
The view from the condo was amazing and I enjoyed working from the desk/work station while in town. The condo provided everything we needed and some. It felt like I was at home."
2943860,31906872,2015-05-11,17426814,Arpan,"A good place which is close to lot of tourist attractions in downtown Seattle, like Pike Pl, Starbucks reserve, bars, food places etc.
The host was very helpful and suggested good place during check in. He was also available when we had issues with Internet over the weekend.
A good place and would visit again."
2943860,32216701,2015-05-15,32941808,Dustin,Beautiful apartment with great views. Clean and spacious. 3 min door-to-door to the convention center which made all the difference in location for me. Highly recommended. 
2943860,38483017,2015-07-16,3395375,Larry,"Our host was Doug & he was very accommodating.  He was prompt, efficient, & friendly.  The location was perfect for the 4 of us.  We walked or took public transportation to all the places we wanted to visit near downtown.  More than 4 occupants would have made us cramped.  We all agreed that we got a very good place to stay at a good price."
2943860,39148788,2015-07-21,27915887,Esteban,"The property fits accuartely the listings description, it was perfect for us.  The location is great, just a short walk to major and grocery stores, transportation, the public market and piers.  The attention we received was outstanding, before we arrived Becki was prompt to answer all our messages and getting everything ready for our arrival.  Doug who welcomed us, is great friendly person; he helped us with our bags, which were plenty, took his time showing us everything about the appartment, drove with me to the parking spot, explained how to get around the city and was always available if we needed something.
Thank you Becki and Doug, we had a great time!"
2943860,49010862,2015-09-30,41298128,Abby,"- Doug was super kind and arrived to meet us made it easy to relax after our long trip
- Beautiful views
- Perfect for someone attending a conference at WCC
-excellent access to downtown
-ample keys
-VERY comfortable beds and bedding
-clean

amazing stay!"
2943860,49761045,2015-10-06,32787624,John,"We had a great time. The condo was perfect for what we needed. We didn't use the kitchen but the 2 bathrooms worked out great. Location was great for doing anything downtown. It was close walking distance to everything or a quick light rail trip to the baseball and football stadiums. We even walked down to the stadiums twice, was a bit far but not a bad walk. "
2943860,53356698,2015-11-08,7204775,Annah,"Great location for attending events at the convention center, short walk to other local attractions as well. Close mini-mart and restaurants. 

Only downsides were some noise from the freeway and the sleeper sofa was not very comfortable, the twin beds and king beds were very comfortable though. "
2943860,54099026,2015-11-16,7548209,Dustin,"This place has a perfect location. It's relatively big and has plenty of beds for a larger group. The single beds and the pull-out aren't the most comfortable, but they're alright. I would stay here again if travelling with a group of 4-5 people."
8759443,50808786,2015-10-14,44378201,Aruni,Emmett is very nice host . I felt I am staying in my own home . He took utmost  care to get me comfortable . We cooked the dinner together and it was really a fun time . I enjoyed a lot . Thanks Emmett for hosting me 
8759443,54210802,2015-11-16,39429218,Josh,"Emmett and Barbara are awesome! I can't say enough good things. They were both really, really welcoming and helpful. And fun! I had a dope time chilling with them. Bonus: their apartment is mad easy to get to, located super close to downtown and a few different transit options. Truly chill people. A+ hosts."
5639238,30364450,2015-04-20,15207038,Mel,"Tim was very responsive and clear in his instructions.

The apartment has a great location and in a really nice area with lotsa food and supermarkets nearby.

Very comfortable apartment for 2. Large-screen TV with many channels available. Wifi was not made available tho.

Apartment was set-up like a bachelor's apartment, rather than a place expecting guests. So it's kinda messy & the smells of men's cologne & old sheets remain. Bathroom and Carpet need some cleaning too."
5639238,30534500,2015-04-23,11921744,Jennifer & Chris,Tim was a good host and was very responsive to our needs.  His apartment is very new and in a cool part of Seattle surrounded by lots of trendy bars and restaurants.  One of the best oyster bars in the city is on the ground floor of his building! 
6937492,38787774,2015-07-18,6717012,Suzanne,"The house is very sweet and it is in a beautiful location overlooking the sea with mountains in the background. It is very quiet but also easy to get downtown. Greg and his wife, Barb, were very friendly and interesting people. Great hosts! "
6937492,40142297,2015-07-28,27774933,Sandra,"Cette maison est un véritable havre de paix.
La vue est époustouflante. Prendre son café, face aux ferries, les îles et les montagnes, est un délice.
La maison a tout le confort, les ustensiles, et les produits de première nécessité.
A notre arrivée, des pâtisseries et une bouteille de vin, nous attendait.
La maison est proche de tous commerces, et le centre ville est a, à peine 20 minutes.
Bref, notre séjour à été parfait.
Un grand merci à Greg, et son épouse."
6937492,40803398,2015-08-02,22869056,Victor,Great location on top of the hill. Fantastic view on the ocean.  House is clean and very beautiful inside!
6937492,41416177,2015-08-07,35496677,Elaine,"We arrived to our cabin after a long road trip and felt very welcome when we arrived. The cabin was clean, tidy and plenty of detailed instructions, this was very helpful because we had four adults staying in the cabin. The view was breath taking and we were greeted with a complimentary bottle of wine, which was enjoyed looking at the stunning view. We had a minor issue with the drain in the bathroom and Greg had it attended to within moments of me requesting his help. We all felt relaxed and welcome. I would recommend this cabin to anyone who is looking for a quiet, cosy and scenic view of the Puget sound. "
6937492,41802507,2015-08-09,37813626,An,"Due to a medical emergency back home, we had to cancel our stay at the last minute. Greg was extremely understanding and communicated with such kindness about it all. We plan on returning to the area in the future and will most definitely look up their place for our stay!"
6937492,43088180,2015-08-17,7508678,Michael,"We loved this spot! The view of puget sound was great, nearby restaurants served a good mix of foods, and Greg was a very welcoming host. He was waiting on his next door porch when we arrived, he arranged for other family members to be available when he wasn't, and  a delicious box  of pastries from the nearby bakery was part of our welcome. We'd happily stay here again."
6937492,44033513,2015-08-23,41170959,Scott,"Greg is a warm and friendly host.  The house and views were just as pictured.  It's a small, charming old house and we were very comfortable during our stay."
6937492,44932184,2015-08-30,38482466,Allison,"We had a fantastic stay in a nice neighborhood.  The view of the Sound couldn't be better.  The home was quaint and clean, and Greg did everything he could to make us feel welcome-  even leaving us some goodies upon our arrival!  I'd definitely look to Greg in the future for our stay in the Seattle area."
6937492,47167970,2015-09-16,40305845,Katherine,"This was the first time my family has rented via Airbnb and it was definitely a positive experience! The cottage was clean and charming, with an outstanding view of Pugeot Sound! The kitchen widow overlooked a beautiful, dense forest with lots of birds. The city of Seattle is not far, maybe twenty minutes away, yet we felt as if we were in the country. We will be back!"
6937492,47809827,2015-09-21,4579247,Jan,"Greg & Barb's house was great! Cozy and equipped with everything you need. We loved the quiet neighbourhood and the view over Puget Sound. A great Bakery and places to eat are nearby. Highly recommended, would love to come back."
6937492,48911716,2015-09-29,42071786,Madeline,"Greg is a wonderful host.  He surprised us with a delicious bottle of wine, great pastries from a local bakery you can walk to if you wish.   Coffee beans to grind for fresh coffee, etc.  Furnished beautifully.  Superb walking area to shops, restaurants, the  ferry landing and nearby large park.  The water view (picture) doesn't do the actual view justice in that it is more like a 180-degree water view with ferries crossing and large ships passing by.  Beautiful, secluded, quiet private and relaxing.  We would highly recommend this home.    "
6937492,55148243,2015-11-28,49117347,Eric,房子很小没有想象那么好
6937492,57474957,2015-12-26,38400432,Susan,"This home was exactly as pictured - very cozy; beautiful setting.  The walk to the beach and ferry is short, and there is a really lovely, long, beach walk that is just beautiful.  There is also a great restaurant and bakery tucked in a corner halfway to the beach, which I didn't find till the next day.  Excellent breakfast - check it out.  It was cold and rainy over Christmas so I feel I didn't do the location justice with outdoor exploration because there are many beautiful park areas nearby to walk through.

The house was spotless inside, and nicely furnished.  Greg's communication was excellent and everything we needed was at the house.  Loved the bakery goods waiting for us.  Heat from the gas fireplace was super cozy, and easy to turn up and off as needed as we came and went.  A very nice stay.
"
6937492,57960733,2015-12-30,5440601,Bryan,"Greg's house was exactly as advertised and pictured - except that the view of Puget Sound is even more spectacular in person than in the pictures :)

Part way into our stay, there was a significant event involving the house's plumbing.  Tree roots, as it turns out, caused major sewer backup into the house.  It was not at all Greg's fault, and he responded amazingly fast and with grace, in locating services that could find and fix the problem.  Having recently been through a similar plumbing issue of my own at home, I know it could have been long and hard.  Greg's calm but urgent responsiveness helped us get through it quickly and with as little disruption as was possible!  He did a great job of taking care of us.

The house was exceptionally clean and in great shape upon our arrival and everything worked exactly as expected.  The location is convenient - just a few minutes drive or walk to a nice restaurant / commercial streets, and easy access to some of the major roadways connecting to / from the city.  Easy 20 drive to downtown.

I was not very comfortable when booking because we could not see actual photos of the apartment, since they own many apartments in the same building. However, the apartment was beautiful, clean and had everything described.
It was even larger than we imagined, and 7 people could have slept there with no airbeds needed.
We did not see Jordan or anyone from StayAlfred since we did all checkin and checkout directly with the building concierge, and that made us feel as if we were in a hotel."
922986,9839991,2014-01-13,9244714,Karlijn,"Great location, spacious and clean enough. No personal service or homely feel but well arranged hotel type facility.  Gym and swimming pool were a plus. Would stay here again, especially with a group. "
922986,10469510,2014-02-20,362813,Helena,We had a wonderful time with our two young children while staying at this apartment.  The location was perfect and the pool a huge bonus.  We would love to stay here again and this time we will bring some extras for the kitchen like spices and a griddle.  We can't wait to visit again!
922986,11554832,2014-04-07,11376831,Levi,"Our stay was great! The room was clean with all the necessary amenities, and the location was perfect. StayAlfred could not have been better to work with. I would definitely stay here again. "
922986,12462969,2014-05-03,1816520,Lou,"Great location, fantastic unit, check in and checkout was smooth and easy."
922986,15303320,2014-07-07,12518227,Marshall,"Accommodations were very nice, convenient to everything in downtown Seattle.  No air conditioning made the first night uncomfortable because it was unseasonably warm but it was tolerable.  A new Target store 2 blocks away made it very easy to items for meals and there are several restaurants and a deli right in the apartment complex.

I do have to complain about the poor communication between Air BNB and the host.  We received multiple emails prior to our visit with the incorrect address and contact information.  This made our arrival absolutely terrible.  We showed up to an empty parking lot and then when we called the phone listed in the email we got someone's private cell phone who no longer worked for Alfred's.  That person was kind enough to get us the correct contact information and eventually we found our correct destination.  Once we settled in, it was a very pleasant stay.  Then when I emailed to complain about this problem, I got a phone call then next day with no real explanation for the problems and no apology.  

Though the location couldn't be beat, but would hesitate to recommend this to others based on my experience."
922986,16236530,2014-07-23,18391623,Erick,Good spot!!
922986,20273985,2014-09-27,13869980,Diane,We had a great time in Seattle!  Everything was very easy - from check-in to check-out. Fantastic location. Exactly where we wanted to be. A short walk to Pikes Market and Victoria Clipper.  Had a great dinner on the waterfront. Would stay here again. Loved having the laundry facilities
922986,25286713,2015-01-11,7697283,Joseph,Great apartment in an amazing location. Must stay if you looking for an authentic seattle experience!!
922986,26265670,2015-02-08,23819468,Cynthia,"Great location! Great apartment! The apartment is very spacious and comfortable. It has a lot of great amenities such as a gym, pool, and parking. Also the company managing this rental is very friendly and helpful. "
922986,30289268,2015-04-20,16157719,Jessica,Jordan was well organized and attended to my questions fast. The place is exactly what we have expected. I would definitely recommend this place to all my friends who are going to visit Seattle.
922986,32137828,2015-05-14,16824410,Eapen,There was a bit of trouble finding the exact parking spot. The underground parking is a bit of a maze.
922986,42664185,2015-08-15,27363880,David,"Very convenient location but the quality of the units varies quite a bit. We have rented three units this August and one back in April. The good units come with a nice view, balcony, and enough lighting to make a comfortable unit but the not-so-good ones are dark with small windows (minimal natural light) and not enough lighting to have enjoyable family time in the evening. Our unit's dishwasher and dryer also didn't work very well. We were there with two teenage boys and our 2-year-old daughter and I must admit our experience with the unit we get this time is not very good compared to the last unit we had in the same complex. I'd recommend checking with the host to see what kind of units you are getting! "
922986,46599197,2015-09-12,39131058,Natsumi,Nice and cozy place. the only thing I have to complain about is the entrance of the building was not clear and the concierge did not gave us the exact location at first.
922986,53906335,2015-11-14,23272194,Federico,"El departamento es grande y cómodo, la zona es muy buena, el internet funciono muy bien. A Jordan no lo conocí pero dejo todo preparado para nosotros."
6629278,34587647,2015-06-09,3017938,Petra,"Kathleen is a very good host, very helpfully. I really liked to stay there. "
6629278,35151489,2015-06-15,21077355,Kao,"Thank you for Kathy's warm treat and careness. Living here is just like home and you can feel safe even I am single woman travel by myself. She gave very clear guidance of transportation and sometimes she was going out, she would take you a ride to downtown. Lovely morning coffee is served, you also do laundry. We do share good times together.

Regarding the transportation, you could take only obe bus #72 eady to go the Washington university around 15mins or downtown, Pike matket place by 30~40mins, Fremont by 25~30 mins as well. If you like walking, you can also walk to Green Lake, my favorite sightsering. 
You could get a bus transit reciept to transfer any metro bus you need. 
It's also convenient of airport transportation by bus #72 to International district and Link light reil to SEA.

The room is with a small bed indeed. That would more suitable for a single woman. I also spent one night to be used to the air bed which is the first time expetience for me. Everything is settled by Kathy, you have private bathroom with towel, hair dryer, washing gel, etc. and WiFi, Cable TV. It's just like you live at hotel comfortablely.

Note on the dogs live in this house. Kathy keeps them from my room and she keeps house cleaness without the dog hair.

Welcome to come Kathy's house"
6629278,36308449,2015-06-27,20495501,Alex,"Kathy is very attentive and nice. Always willing to help and share, from car trips to local tips, and clear about requests/rules. Two smaller dogs with the larger one very well behaved and trained. The location is quiet, and complete TV, entertainment center in your room. "
6629278,38045959,2015-07-12,37256657,Grace,"Kathleen was an absolute dream of a host! We felt completely welcomed from the moment that we arrived and were so glad to have had such a wonderful experience in Seattle. Kathleen was incredibly accommodating and helpful; she even offered to help with anything since we were so busy during our visit. She is also very well-read and knowledgable and I wish we had had more time to get to know her and hear more about her travels!

The room we stayed in was small, but the perfect size for two people. The air mattresses were incredibly comfortable and we slept remarkably well each night. The bathroom we were provided was clean and the shower did not take too long to warm up! Kathleen has two adorable dogs who were very friendly, but did not enter our space without invitation. She kindly provided breakfast options that were both delicious and organic, which was much appreciated!

This location was absolutely ideal for the two of us and we were glad it was in such an excellent location to access the many neighborhoods of Seattle. We plan to stay here again on future trips to the area and cannot recommend it enough to anyone looking for a place to stay. "
6629278,38906532,2015-07-19,37339777,Sasha,"Kathleen was a very gracious host.  The space was very nice and clean.  Kathleen welcomed my friend and I and made us feel at home as neither of us were familiar with the Seattle area.  She was very kind and even offered to drive us to various places.  She knows so much about the area and had good recommendations for things we could do.  Her dogs were wonderful, they love to hang out but are very well trained and will give you space if you need it.  The neighborhood was also great and it was easy to get to the UW area or downtown via bus.  A very positive experience!! Thanks again Kathleen!"
6629278,39665819,2015-07-25,37374601,Harold,"Great host! The room and the entire home was clean and
very comfortable ( even aTV in your own room ). Had a very pleasant stay. Kathleen was also very knowledgeable in providing information of getting around the Seattle area( bus routes...etc). Thanks Kathleen!


"
6629278,41236814,2015-08-05,7662846,Akshat,"Kathy is one of those super hosts you hope you meet in your journeys on AirBnB. She is a phenomenally intelligent and well read lady who has great experiences to share about he life. It truly is great spending time with her.

The room is private and clean. Has its own bathroom and is in a nice quiet part of town. Very accessible to the entire city.

I have nothing but gloqiny commendations. Stay here for a Greta hospitality experience"
6629278,45286138,2015-09-01,39800516,Fahad,"Miss Kathy is a wonderfull host ... she makes you feel home .. listing description accurate.
she has two lovely dogs that makes you feel safe."
5537833,30904698,2015-04-28,2237135,Aliyah,Ali's place was great. It was incredibly well stocked from the kitchen to the bathroom. The place was gorgeous (fresh flowers!) and we couldn't have asked for a better location. Communication and logistics were super easy as well. 
5537833,31912717,2015-05-11,30897336,Hugh,"Ali's place was fantastic. Beautifully decorated, convenient and well located. Check in and check out were super organised and we weren't wanting for anything. Would definitely stay again next time we're in Seattle."
5537833,33238838,2015-05-26,5973736,Adam,Ali was very responsive and communicative during the book process. Her home was great and perfectly located! I absolutely recommend her place to anyone visiting Seattle.
5537833,33800959,2015-06-01,10051985,Roberto,"If you want to visit Seattle, please, stay at Ali's lovely house. It has everything that you need, tidy, clean and a nice fender guitar! Good tips and recommendations that made our stay easier and better. Absolutely amazing!"
5537833,46573868,2015-09-12,27908585,Xenia,"Thank you Ali, you are the best!
We were welcomed with wine and had a wonderful stay at the house. It was just like the pictures, beatiful, comfortable and with love in every detail. When we had questions or needed some recommends Ali was there and gave us perfect advice. This house and the lovely women are a perfect combination to enjoy the stay at Seattle! And when she came by to say goodbye she brought chocolate as a gift. Thank you again. We had an amazing time!! "
5537833,51326327,2015-10-19,4753980,Dima,"Ali was an awesome host, she provided clear instructions and directions to the house, had a binder prepared with many ideas of where to go to eat/hangout, and was easy to get in touch with. I would definitely recommend staying at Ali's. "
9411935,54418964,2015-11-19,46785674,Eric,"Staying at Sebastian's was great.  The place was nice and clean and the location was excellent.  I would recommend to anyone, especially if you like night life and proximity to downtown."
9411935,56699332,2015-12-16,11968855,Dennis,"I was very comfortable with memory foam (perhaps?) Mattress. Sebastion was helpful, even with my luggage. The environment is clean. It is a very small studio. "
6750264,36444588,2015-06-28,8510892,Sean,As advertised - cozy house with view. Mandy was good communicator and answered questions promptly. Location is super convenient - downtown 15 min. Very clean and tidy house that is easy to relax in. 
6750264,45197731,2015-08-31,42132299,Kate,Great house for traveling with a family! 
6750264,47114812,2015-09-15,3904755,"Heather, Mike & Eleni","This place would be perfect for all walks of life, it was especially nice traveling with our toddler as there were some toys and children's books for our daughter to enjoy during the stay.  A nice location, pleasant walks to the Zoo, and close to great neighborhoods like Fremont, Phinney Ridge and Ballard.  The space is clean, accurately described, and well equipped for a long or short stay.  Lovely views of the Olympic mountains to enjoy from kitchen and living area, and the master bed was quite comfortable.  We felt comfortable and at home."
6750264,48845408,2015-09-28,30695459,Nicholas,Great place to stay with an amazing view!! We had 4 guest and the 2 bedrooms worked out perfectly! Perfect place to go out on Ballard or Fremont... Or to stay in and make dinner! 
8859380,51864140,2015-10-24,47038974,Rachel," 

WOW! This apartment does not disappoint. Stayed with my family of 5 and we were so happy to have enough space for all of us. We had three full bedrooms and a gorgeous living space and deck to enjoy the water views. The sunsets in October were spectacular, and the location to downtown was so close. The neighborhood had everything we needed when we wanted to go grocery shopping (Trader Joes and Whole Foods very nearby) and many coffee shops and bakeries that we went to and brought back breakfast to enjoy the views in the mornings.

Kim was a great host and had a lot of suggestions for where to go in Seattle and was easy getting in touch with her.

Will definitely stay again.
"
8859380,55226239,2015-11-29,46241244,Scott,We felt very welcome and Kimberly was very proactive abt reaching us and asking what we needed.  Favorite things include the view (the photos don't do it justice) and the beds/bedding...way beyond what you'd get at a hotel.  Very comfortable and close to downtown.
8859380,56131643,2015-12-09,18141146,Jon,"Everything was perfect! Location, beds, host..."
8859380,56391209,2015-12-13,4263157,Navin,Amazing place. Amazing host. She was delightful! The views are excellent. 
8859380,57647306,2015-12-28,47288413,Helen,"The condo turned out to be the perfect ""home away from home"" for spending our Christmas holiday with our family of 6 adults.  The well-designed home was tastefully furnished with many added holiday touches (white lights, poinsettia, chocolate truffles, etc.)  The fire was warm and cozy and the view just as described:  ""stunning"".  The kitchen was well-equipped for preparing many gourmet holiday meals.  We loved taking walks around the charming neighborhood and along the shoreline, where we viewed the Sculpture Park.  We also walked to dinner at Betty's (one of our favorite restaurants) and Five Spot for a fun lunch."
8859380,58304165,2016-01-02,11790316,Veronica,"I had a great time at Kimberley's place! The view was amazing, the beds were comfortable, and it was warm. Perfect place to spend time in Seattle. "

4526943,47924884,2015-09-21,21137056,Warren,Great location.  Daniella was very responsive.
4526943,48789635,2015-09-28,1168782,Phillip,"Overall I would say the place was average. Older unit. The neighborhood is excellent with close proximity to the city.

The booking process was fairly annoying (signing documents as if its a rental and took some time to get directions on how to get keys etc). Also the unit didn't have toilet paper and no clear directions on how to use the heat etc. We didnt figure that out until day 2.

I cant recommend this unit although the location was ideal. "
4526943,58266844,2016-01-02,15930110,Alex,"My girlfriend and I are currently traveling the states while she does travel nursing contracts. We stayed in Daniella's Capitol Hill unit for 13 weeks (Oct-December) while my girlfriend worked a contract at Swedish Hospital in First Hill. The location is perfect. It's a close distance to many great neighborhoods but also in a nice quiet residential part of the city so you get the best of both world's. We walked everywhere (even Fremont sometimes). There is a garage if you need to use a car though. It's on a hill and can be a pain to back out of. I scraped the lower front portion of my car quite a bit (unavoidable) but it was very minor damage and may be minimized with a rubber strip or frame that isn't low to the ground.

Upon arriving Daniella greeted us and gave us a quick walk-through and addressed any questions we had. She was quick to respond to any issues that came up through the months we were living there. The unit is split into four apartments and all the other neighbors were friendly and quiet. The shared washer and dryer is located in the basement and works well. 

The apartment is fully furnished. Everything seemed recently renovated and really well kept. Internet was fast and all appliances worked well. It was the nicest short term unit we've stayed in so far. It's a professionally managed unit. We highly recommend a visit and will try to book again when we come back to Seattle. "
977722,3882348,2013-03-24,5381721,Supachai,"The room is clean and tidy. Moreover, this place is easy to find, you can walk just 10-15 minutes to UW. Above all, Elizabeth is a very good host and so nice. You will get the warm welcome when you stay here ^_^"
977722,3933522,2013-03-28,3667165,Roseann,"I stayed a few nights at Elizabeth's studio and found it very pleasant
indeed.   Perfectly appointed with everything I needed, very comfortable and quiet.  I had reminiscent feelings of being in France......something about it.  For a basement apartment it was very light and private.  The location was great.....Elizabeth had warned me about difficult parking, but in fact, I found on street parking in front of the house each night.
I will stay there again.  "

977722,4170209,2013-04-15,5741514,Mariam,"Elizabeth was a very kind host, but I am a bit disappointed that she faulted me for not recycling my papers -- I didn't see the recycling bin and had already packed up my computer, so did not remember that there was a recycling bin.

The studio is in a basement in Seattle, so it has a bit of a musty feel and smell. There was a space heater, but the room was very cold in the evenings. The apartment was pretty clean though, which was a definite plus. Bring slippers or something for the studio, as there is only one bathroom rug and the tiles are very cold! "
977722,4312067,2013-04-27,5502103,Natasha,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and I feel like I started at the top! Elizabeth's apt. was adorable, peaceful, beautifully decorated, well-equipped and in a great location. Elizabeth herself was such a kind, thoughtful host. All aspects of my stay made it a wonderful experience which I would love to repeat. I highly recommend Elizabeth's nest!"
977722,5036499,2013-06-09,1644020,Angelo,"Elizabeth's studio apartment was a great place to stay as I prepared for a big move from Seattle to the East Coast.  I stayed there for a week and loved its convenient location to UW, as well as all of the furnishings and kitchen equipment you need for a short stay. I highly recommend her place because of the privacy and comfort she provides at a reasonable price. Thank You!"
977722,5127410,2013-06-14,5742930,Judy,"Perfect.  Great little space, well appointed, neat, clean, quiet.  Close to bus, coffee, food.  Vegan?  Try nearby Chaco Canyon. Also the Burke Museum at the University of Washington is just a stroll away.  Thanks for your hospitality, Elizabeth.  This was our first airbnb experience, and we couldn't have been happier."
977722,5177646,2013-06-17,1775906,Bunny,The apartment was lovely and cozy. Elizabeth was flexible with our arrival time and we were grateful for that. She left us cookies and watermelon! The location was wonderful for visiting the University district. 
977722,5394184,2013-06-28,2168926,Linda,"We had a wonderful stay of 10 days in Elizabeth's nice daylight basement apartment.  It was spacious and very clean, with everything a guest would need.  The location in the University District allowed us to be close to family and have something to do with our ""down time."" Parking could have been a problem; however, Elizabeth was very accommodating.  "

There are also a lot of buses to downtown so that's also very accessible. Bed is comfortable, good amount of kitchen equipment, grocery store about 9 blocks away (not long blocks).  Elizabeth is a fine host and I'll stay here again."
977722,6425252,2013-08-12,6961014,Leacey,"This was my first visit through Airbnb and it has me sold. This was a perfect little apartment - clean, quiet, cosy, and perfectly stocked (including fresh cookies and blueberries!) Thank you, Elizabeth! I would be thrilled to come visit again."
977722,6809062,2013-08-26,2466479,Ben,Booked it for my son to stay for 4 nights before he moved into UW's dorm.  The location was perfect and the apartment was really comfortable.  Elizabeth was a really great host.

977722,9230650,2013-12-15,4069514,Yan,"I stayed at Elizabeth's place because I needed a place within walking distance of the UW Law School for my final year of exams.  It was absolutely PERFECT.  Quiet, big desk, and everything included.  "
977722,9578895,2014-01-02,10903373,Daniel,"We stayed here last minute after other plans fell through. Elizabeth was fast to respond, had a lovely studio, and even left cookies waiting for us. Elizabeth even provided a street parking permit, which was perfect for our rental car. Would recommend and stay here again. "
977722,10849970,2014-03-10,12267664,Lauren,"Elizabeth’s place was just right for our short stay and visit to UW. It was clean, comfortable, and tastefully decorated. It is obvious that Elizabeth takes great care in keeping the space, and in ensuring a positive experience for her guests. We appreciate it, and we would certainly stay in the future if we don’t end up living in Seattle! "
977722,11175568,2014-03-24,11707082,Cristina,"We visited Elisabeth's apartment over a long weekend in March and were overwhelmingly pleased with all of her accomodations! She was prompt and cordial in all communications, from booking to checkin-in; I think she lives above but we never ran into her (spent long hours at a conference and adventuring in the PNW).

The studio is located in the university area just north of campus and East of University St. For a garden-level apartment, it was spacious and cozy with abundant natural light during the day and a well-stocked kitchen if you care to eat some meals in. There were instructions and cookies when we arrived and, due to the weather, a space radiator already heating. Also, a luxurious bonus: the bathroom floors are heated too.

There are many shops and restaurants in the immediate vicinity, with buses on University that get you downtown quickly. The rates were reasonable and we would definitely stay again!

977722,14926146,2014-06-29,4391568,Susan,Elizabeths place was very comfortable and inviting. Great location and fully stocked. We had no trouble communicating with our hostess :-) we would return to and recommend this place.Thanks for the cookies and bowl of cherries!
977722,16112243,2014-07-22,9500281,Leslie,"Elizabeth's studio apartment was ideal for us! Quiet location, and very accessible by car to all we wanted to do in Seattle. The apartment has a lovely feel to it, with Asian-style tones that add to the peace and serenity. The kitchen had everything we needed, and we loved having the breakfast nook to enjoy our meals. And very important to me is quality sleep, and the bed is soooo comfortable! 
P.S. Loved the cookies and blueberries awaiting us upon arrival! Thanks."
977722,16402236,2014-07-27,605276,Geri,"I never got to meet Elizabeth in person but she created a lovely environment  for hospitality and warmth in the apt. She had cookies and fruit waiting for my arrival. I loved the coziness of the apt. and convenience to the campus. Her description was right on and she was very prompt and pleasant through our emails. Thank you, Elizabeth. So much better to have a place like yours rather than a hotel room.

Although we didn't meet Elizabeth, she sent us all the necessary information before hand which was helpful in finding things and getting them to work. The apartment is well equipped except that it lacks a microwave which is so integral to cooking these days. The apartment is clean, very close to UW and University Avenue which has loads of cafes and other amenities. The University Village is 15 minutes by walk and hosts great many restaurants, cafes, bars and shops and a great place to hangout. In all very satisfied. "
977722,18988863,2014-09-04,17864160,Chieh-Yu,"Elizabeth is so nice! 

Although the timing was inconsistent, but she pleased to provide flexibility and allowed us to deposited luggage when we arrived and left. 

Elizabeth's studio is cozy and clean, you can feel her careful arrangements for the stay people."
977722,19361838,2014-09-11,9842860,Kim,"Elizabeth was a perfect host.... Super prompt with all communication, super organized and even had homemade bread and pickled cucumbers out for us when we arrived! The studio is in the middle of the university district which is right next to udub and walking distance to great shopping... Anthropologie, restaurants, etc.... It is in the neighborhood of all the sororities and frat houses, but That wasn't a problem... Not too loud, the studio is still serene as she describes. The studio has the charm of an old craftsman house, with great artistic touches:) The studio was super clean and had everything you might need. I am looking forward to returning to stay at the studio when up visiting our daughter at udub... It was perfect!"
977722,19620484,2014-09-15,3142798,Jennifer,"Our stay was great.  Took us a while to  find the actual house because we arrived after dark and no one was there to greet us since Elizabeth was out of town (which was fine). The neighborhood seemed safe so we walked the sidewalk until we located the studio apt.  Once inside, we felt it was perfect for our stay.  We didn't need a lot since we were out and about most of the time.  Bed was cozy and we loved using the kitchen for breakfast each morning (grocery store is a couple blocks over).  I must add that we also enjoyed the floor warmer in the bathroom since it was a bit chilly overnight (which was great coming from the Houston humidity).  :) Overall, great stay.  I'd recommend it to my friends.  Loved the neighborhood with the university life going on around us!  Thanks!"
977722,19778846,2014-09-18,11166641,Cathy,"from the welcoming chocolate chip cookies at check-in to all the thoughtful details throughout, Elizabeth has the best interests of her guests in mind. The space is well laid out, helpful touches (Ice in freezer for my travel cooler was wonderful), and everything you could need in the kitchen.
The location is perfect when needing to be close to the UW, and for work trips (like this time for me) the desk space is a bonus.  The space is so quiet, it's hard to believe you're so close to the campus.
I definitely recommend Elizabeth and her serene studio apartment. Hope to be back again. "
977722,20009487,2014-09-22,4491242,Meghan,"We arrived in the evening on a Friday and found fresh apples and cookies awaiting us. The apartment is lovely and spacious with a big bathroom, nice kitchen, and delightful sitting area next to the breakfast nook. The bed was so comfortable and was the ideal spot to crash after my half-marathon was completed! 
We had a chance to talk with Elizabeth the night before we left and she was just as gracious and kind as the apartment suggests. I would stay here again in a heartbeat- the surrounding area is the University District and there were great restaurants (vegan gluten free pizza for the win!) just a few blocks away. This is one of those places that totally adds to your stay and makes your housing part of the experience. We had an awesome time!"
977722,20607480,2014-10-02,1884658,Joanne,"I had a relaxing and peaceful stay at Elizabeth's place for 3 nights from Sept 29-Oct 2. The studio is located in a quiet neighbourhood within the University District and accessible to public transport. I did not have any difficulty at all getting to/from the place. When I arrived after a tiring and super delayed bus trip, there was a tasty zucchini bread waiting for me! There is a Safeway a few blocks on one side and the University Village Shopping Centre on the other side. If you are a looking for a peaceful neighbourhood with great accessibility to downtown Seattle, ""Serene Studio"" is the place to be!"
977722,21747869,2014-10-23,14024579,Masumi,"That's house was really great to stay
at Seattle.
I can walk around safely and close to Down Town.

Elizabeth is very kind.
She just made some cookies when I arrived at house.
That's was delicious.
I felt so relax and enjoyed staying.
I hope next time visiting at Seattle.
I will stay at Elizabeth's house!
Thank you!

977722,22170499,2014-10-31,22970209,Joan,"The serene studio is located within walking distance of the University and shopping districts. Given the location, the neighborhood is very quiet. The studio is private, clean, well-appointed, and well-decorated.  Because of my schedule, I never met Elizabeth in-person. We only communicated via email and text. When I told her I wouldn't be arriving until late in the evening, she left the outside light on for me and even turned on supplementary heating to make sure the studio was warm enough when I arrived. City maps, free bus passes, and city info were available as well. Highly recommended!"
977722,22532536,2014-11-09,22128484,David,"I greatly enjoyed my stay at Elizabeth's apartment. The place was exactly as described, quiet, clean, and located within walking distance of UW campus. Lots of restaurants and stores in the university village area nearby and easy access to downtown via the bus system. Given that I was in town for an interview at UW it was a prefect place to stay. I would recommend this place to anyone who is interested."
977722,23036747,2014-11-21,12021111,Kiki,"I love Elizabeth's house very much! It located in university area , and very quite and peaceful place, make me sleep very well in the night. During my stay she is out of town , but she make clear instruction of how to get to her house , makes me easy to found the house! Also Elizabeth is very nice,she arranged her friend Louie to welcome me at the house on the day I arrived. And prepare everything for me. such as bus maps , tour maps and cookie for me ! Thanks so much! If i will come Seattle again i surely will stay her house ^^.
"
977722,23893284,2014-12-14,5315570,Sarah,"Had a lovely stay at Elizabeth's, complete with homemade cookies on arrival! Super convenient location (to UW) and close to great restaurants and coffee! Clean apartment and had everything you need for a comfy stay, and Elizabeth left maps, bus passes and lots of books if you are looking for something to read! Thank you!!"
977722,24713384,2015-01-02,22260861,Patricio,"La habitación es muy cálida y confortable, Elizabeth se preocupa hasta de los mas mínimos detalles, calefacción, te, café, toallas inmaculadas, baño con rica ducha, agua caliente. etc. posibilidad de sentirse como en casa.
Buena señal de WiFi
El barrio muy tranquilo y muy cercano al centro, supermercados. Movilización cercana."
977722,24981081,2015-01-04,19749349,Ken,"Elizabeth greeted us and showed us the accommodations.  We had changed our reservation at the last minute and we all sat down together and worked our way through the airbnb website until we had it worked out.  Elizabeth was very helpful.

The accommodations were just as described, very warm, spacious, quiet, and comfortable.  We especially loved the heated tile floor in the bathroom."
977722,25111411,2015-01-06,9471858,Jared,"Elizabeth's garden level apt was lovely and clean - plenty of space, a comfy bed, and a nice bathroom. It was a short walk to UW campus, which was very convenient. The wifi worked well. I also appreciated the coffee, tea, cookies, and grapefruit!"
977722,25221467,2015-01-09,18675873,Francisco,"Thank you Elizabeth for the hospitality and coziness of the apartment.
The stay was great."
977722,25520313,2015-01-18,19196472,Sarah,"The apartment is beautiful and completely matches the pictures. My daughter and I arrived on a cold, rainy night. We entered into a brightly lit, warm, and pretty apartment. Elizabeth left cookies, oranges, coffee, creamer, and filtered water. She has clearly put a great deal of thought and effort into making her guests feel comfortable. There are maps, books, comfortable bed, and a heated bathroom floor! The space is wonderful - very bright and cheerful. And it is in a really pretty location that was close to everything we wanted to see. We hope to stay there again!"
977722,26054955,2015-02-02,25323280,Erica,I loved this apartment. Elizabeth leaves little thoughtful touches for her guests. The location was great and I would seek out this apartment again if and when I come back. 
977722,26490169,2015-02-14,11624366,Shalia,"Elizabeth was such an amazing host. Not only was her place super cozy and comfortable, she is such a nice friend. She made me feel at home and made me first experience in Seattle a blast. 
She was helpful with telling me how to classify rubbish and where to take the bus. She gave us free bus tickets. She is always there for us when we are in need and she is always ready to help with any type of problem.
The house is conveniently located in the U District. It is definitely accessible to the downtown area by public transportation and walkable to the University of Washington.
We rented this room for two weeks. We wish we could stay here longer. We enjoy our staying very much. If we ever go to Seattle again, this will be our first choice.
Thank you, Elizabeth.

977722,27127539,2015-02-26,24908640,Yifu,"Cozy home near the university, excellent for visiting parents. My mom enjoyed the entire stay, and she loves the kitchen a lot. Thank you! "
977722,28203337,2015-03-20,25948997,Suri,"Elisabeth was a warm, welcoming host who saw to it that we settled in properly android ex us with more than our basic needs the apartment was well situated for our purpose. Because it had a full kitchen, we were able to prepare many of our meals ourselves, and avoided the weight issues we often encounter when traveling. Elizabeth provided us with a parking pass so that was not an issue. We look forward to returning to this place on another visit to Seattle."
977722,28417169,2015-03-23,28277267,Tim,"Elizabeth's airbnb private apartment is wonderful. A cozy place to stay that was private and quiet  as well as convenient for me. It's an easy walk to campus with nearby transit options. The hill down to University Village is not for those out of shape, however! 

The home is at the far edge of Greek Row for UW. I visited during spring break and it was very quiet, but I figure the neighborhood could be louder if a lot of parties were going on. The apartment is sort of buried in the hillside (and has more natural light than some basement/garden units), so it's probably still quiet at those times. The kitchen is well furnished, the bathroom spacious (with a heated floor!), and the extra living room space could be convenient if a couple stays and someone needs to work late or needs some privacy.

Unfortunately, I never met Elizabeth, but we had good communication and directions were clear both to get to and access the apartment and how to sort trash, access the internet, etc.

I hope to return here for a future visit to Seattle!"
977722,28697223,2015-03-29,25245269,Zachary,"I very much loved Elizabeth's little apartment.  Actually, it wasn't so little... there was an entire room available for use that I never entered, two potential work spaces, a kitchen table, full kitchen, comfortable bed.... everything one could need and more than I could use.  All for less than any hotel.  When I say little, then, I mean intimate or personable, and that is the strongest impression the apartment gives.  I will absolutely be staying here again whenever I happen to be back in Seattle.  Also, the cookies, apple, etc. were so appreciated after a difficult day of travel.  It's the little touches that make the experience.  Very highly recommended!"
977722,28996055,2015-04-02,26749652,Robert (Nicky),Our experience was amazing. The place is so cute and is perfect for a get away. Being so close to the University we got to visit all out friends with a short walk home. We recommended this place to all out friends.  
977722,30240188,2015-04-19,30608404,Juanita,We had a great time at Elizabeth's place. The description its totally accurate and the apartment is even bigger than what we expected it to be. It was very clean and organized. Great location close to the University of Washington. I would recommend it to anyone! 
977722,34405938,2015-06-08,26384221,Christine,"The studio is very quiet, private, and quaint. The bed is a double or full, it does a much bigger bed in the photographs. It had many amenities for the kitchen. The shower was nice, but very small. The warm floor in the bathroom was super nice. The place is best for one or two small people. Elizabeth was not there, but there was no problem with entry. Very nice area, close to the UW."
977722,34768098,2015-06-12,28775417,Leticia,"This was my parents' first time staying in a non-hotel accommodation, and my first time using Airbnb. They appreciated the cleanliness of the unit and the ability to heat up leftovers with the toaster oven and make tea or coffee. The full size refrigerator was nice for storing perishables and drinks. It was a very warm week and the unit was thankfully much cooler than my own apartment! My parents enjoyed reading and writing on the patio in front of the house in the mornings and evenings as well.  Since their knees are giving them a hard time these days, they couldn't take the staircase shortcut nearby to UVillage, but I rented a car for the week to drive them around. They said it was a nice quiet neighborhood.  Thank you."
977722,39732617,2015-07-26,22901179,Nikki,Thank you Elizabeth for providing us with such wonderful accommodations! The apartment is simply lovely -- very clean with all of the amenities we needed (including extra goodies -- cookies and free bus fare). Definitely loved how central this location is to numerous bus lines. Hope to take advantage of this Air BnB location again in the near future :)
977722,41578505,2015-08-08,29285768,Inga,"Elizabeth was a great host, contacting me ahead of time in case I needed a early check-in, and making sure everything was sorted out. The apartment was exactly as advertised, and was a perfect peaceful place for me to base myself while collaborating with a colleague at UW. UW is walking distance from the apartment."
977722,42265166,2015-08-12,8571476,Gerry,Elizabeth's place was top notch! Exceeded my expectations in every way. Just a delightful place to come home to after a busy day of networking in the city. I would highly recommend this space to anyone.
977722,42720546,2015-08-15,38513937,Susanne,"Great, quiet place to stay.  If you're taking a bus, be prepared, as it is a bit of a hike/hill climb to get to the apartment.  Once you're there, you'll find it was so worth it - a cozy retreat, away from all of the hustle and bustle of the city.   Although we didn't meet Elizabeth in person, we did receive quick emails back and forth giving us directions. We also appreciated the FREE bus tickets and maps of the city.  "
977722,43398986,2015-08-19,25656115,Lewis,Elizabeth is an amazing host she was so welcoming and she did all she could to make me enjoy the place. The house is so neat and lovely. I did enjoy the place. It was truly home away from home.
977722,44097005,2015-08-24,30354421,Susie,"The accommodations were exactly as you see in the photos and descriptions. It was clean and well kept and, indeed, serene and peaceful. It was also very quiet, which we hadn't anticipated given that it is located in the U district. It was homey, cozy, very comfortable and minimal--exactly what we need and like. We also appreciated the privacy of her accommodations-great built-in shoji screens to cover the windows for extra privacy. 

We also appreciated the hair dryer and iron/ironing board that Elizabeth made available to us.

Parking was a bit tight, but Elizabeth is great about letting you use her driveway to park, and she does offer a parking permit for street parking. 

We'd definitely stay here again."
977722,45409590,2015-09-02,39398337,Laura,"Elizabeth's place was perfect.  It was cozy, clean, & had everything we needed.  The big plus was the street parking permit! Great communication the whole time. We would recommend staying here!  "
977722,54348511,2015-11-18,2874391,Vinci,"Elizabeth's home is cozy and comfortable. It has plenty of work space, a small kitchen, and a clean washroom. It's conveniently located; just a quick walk to the University of Washington and a short drive to the University Village Market. 

I didn't get to meet Elizabeth in person but she always responded quickly to messages. She left clear instructions on the fridge and gave lots of personal space. "
977722,54841831,2015-11-25,33820021,Barbara,"Elizabeth was easy to reach and clear with her instructions about key location, parking, household info etc. the place was as it is in the pictures. There were no surprises. The neighborhood seemed safe although I did not spend much time outside in the neighborhood. "
977722,55801928,2015-12-06,46543656,Sarah,"A most excellent BNB! Elizabeth's cozy basement apartment is the perfect place to call home base when traveling to Seattle. Convenient to public transportation, delicious restaurants, fun bars (near U of W), farmers market, running/biking trails... the list goes on. The bed was super soft, the kitchen full service, plenty of space to spread out and relax. Truly a home-away-from-home experience.

Elizabeth is a wonderful host - courteous, thoughtful (she left homemade cookies on the stove!), helpful without overbearing or intruding. 

I cannot wait to stay here again!"
977722,56915441,2015-12-20,45545457,Melanie,"My daughter and I had a wonderful time staying in Elizabeth's quaint apartment! We felt right at home there and loved the cozy eating area. The heated bathroom floor was a wonderful surprise! 

The location is perfect and was central to pretty much every place we visited during our stay. The neighborhood is very quiet and while parking is limited, we never had a problem finding a spot on the street.

We would highly recommend staying here!"
7543458,43200990,2015-08-17,33523260,Mark,Louis and Kevin were great. Good spot in central district. Small but has everything you need. Great place!
7543458,45598206,2015-09-04,28834885,Rob,"The apartment was absolutely charming and plenty spacious.  We spent a little over a week in the apartment and were able to really settle in, which was aided by the fully stocked (full) kitchen.  Louis and Kevin were extremely responsive and thoughtful - before, during and after our visit.  Would definitely stay again, should the need arise."
7543458,46057943,2015-09-07,8693422,Steven,"We stayed in Louis and Kevin's apartment for 3 nights recently and loved it. A great location in Seattle, easy parking, and a big comfy bed. The hosts were there to greet us upon arrival and showed us around, we didn't see them again but were always available via text. It was an easy walk or drive to downtown and grocery stores. Absolutely recommend this to anyone else."
7543458,46643466,2015-09-12,7140935,Jonathan,"It was great. Super easy to communicate with them about checking in and out, apartment was perfect for what we needed (dog friendly and easy to get downtown) and had Internet! Also, the kitchen had everything you needed to make a meal. Also when I got there both hosts were very inviting and friendly in telling us (my girlfriend and me) about the neighborhood and the house rules. "
7543458,46955562,2015-09-14,33287550,Jackie,"WELCOME:  Louis and Kevin treated us as friends from the moment we booked with them.  While they were professional, they were very warm and helpful.  They had thought everything out ahead of time and were attentive to details I had no idea mattered--this was our first time using airbnb, so I was very thankful it was with two people that were exceptionally responsible and trustworthy.  They responded quickly to any messages, and were readily available if we needed them.  
LISTING DESCRIPTION:  The description of the ""charming 1 bedroom in Cap Hill"" listing is accurate, thought the photos do NOT do it justice.  The apartment is lovely.  Really beautiful.  From the photos, I imagined the bathroom was a few feet big, but, while it is small, it is larger and longer than I anticipated--complete with a cabinet.  The apartment was stocked with anything you could need--hair dryer, shower toiletries, soap, everything for cooking, coffee maker, bags and ziplocs, ice, and even a stool just for your suitcase to rest on.  It felt so cozy.  It is a light, airy space that was simply dreamy to stay in.  
NEIGHBORHOOD:  The neighborhood was great.  There was plenty of parking and the neighbors were very friendly.  We really enjoyed that while the apartment was tucked away in a quiet neighborhood, we only had to walk a few minutes to a nearby coffee shop (cortona cafe) and a few blocks to a place to have a bear and a meal (chuck's)--with even more restaurants and cafes.  Trader Joe's is nearby, and we like to walk, so it didn't feel like far to even wander down to pike, pine, and broadway and visit all our old favorites over there.  As soon as we arrived, Louis and Kevin gave us a map and wrote down some of their favorite places in the area.  That was really helpful, and I suggest that future rentors take them up on their recommendations!  They were awesome.   

Overall, there's really no better way to describe our stay in this listing than dreamy.  We absolutely hope to return.    "
7543458,47325372,2015-09-17,44060701,Savanna,Hosts were very nice. The apartment was beautiful and clean. They even went the extra mile to let me know what was around and what would be fun to do. Hosts made sure to be available and accommodating. Thanks!
7543458,47430844,2015-09-18,36243757,Alexis,"Great location, exactly what I was expecting! The apartment was very clean and extremely nicely furnished. The wifi didn't work but we didn't stay very long so it wasn't an issue. Check in and check out was very easy. Parking wasn't an issue, the neighborhood felt relatively safe. The bedroom was nice and quiet at night and the shower is nice and big! I wish I could live in this apartment. If you plan on cooking - this is the perfect kitchen for it!!"
7543458,47573498,2015-09-20,13696851,Danielle,Kevin was very communicative and accommodated our late arrival. The place was very clean and well decorated. I'd recommend this spot to anyone. 
7543458,48444984,2015-09-26,2316057,Jen,We were in communication a few times prior to my arrival. I came with everything set up and my questions answered. Fantastic neighborhood.
7543458,48782765,2015-09-28,5348842,Joe,"Thank you Louis and Kevin - your kindness and support in ensuring our stay was exceptional and will always be remembered.  Your apartment was beyond comfy, cozy and clean.   We wish we could have stayed longer.    We will come back."
7543458,49503829,2015-10-04,6475922,Vanessa,"The listing for this AirBnb was great and very accurate. The multiple pictures gave us a really good idea of what the unit was like and the descriptions were perfect. I was a first time AirBnB user booking a place for my parents to stay when they came to visit my new baby. Louis and Kevin were very accommodating and great communicators. I actually live in the area so it was fun to talk about what we like about this great neighborhood. They were really good about getting in touch with me to confirm a meetup time with my parents and were flexible about it since it's tough to know how long it takes to cross the US-Canada border. I appreciated that since I'm new to this whole process and very busy and sleep deprived with a 3 week old. They were really helpful and patient. My parents told me that Louis and Kevin were EXTREMELY friendly and they absolutely loved the 1 bedroom. They said it was tastefully decorated, had everything they needed, and was just spotless. They spent four nights there and it was very quiet at night and parking in the area was easy. The little kitchen was just what they needed to make breakfast every day as well. Oh and the location is a few blocks from one of my favorite businesses, Chuck's Hop Shop which has 50 rotating taps of local beer, local ice cream from Full Tilt, a huge bottled beer selection and is dog- and kid-friendly. They also have rotating food trucks for dinner on weekdays and lunch and dinner on weekends. I highly recommend staying at Louis's and Kevin's little place and I can't wait to invite friends to stay there. "
7543458,49820952,2015-10-06,44214769,Kyle,"The perfect place to stay for a Seattle visit. Clean, cozy apartment in a quiet, walkable residential part of town, and just minutes away from many of Seattle's attractions. Louis met us at the door and had maps printed to show us what was in the area and stayed to chat and pointed out several other sites we might be interested in. All in all a wonderful experience, and we'd highly recommend to anyone. "
7543458,49922190,2015-10-07,44378613,Allie,Kevin was very accommodating and the place was very clean and comfortable! It was perfect for our quick trip to Seattle. 
7543458,51553353,2015-10-21,44801898,Rachel,"Louis and Kevin were very accommodating, especially with our late arrival - which was greatly appreciated. They respond very quickly, so if you have any questions/concerns you won't be left in the dark. The house is in a great neighborhood, it's quiet and beautiful! The location was closer than expected to many great spots in Seattle, we were able to walk to the majority of places, 20-30minutes, and the longest walk we took was 40 minutes. We didn't spend much time in the house, but they have everything you need if you wish to have a day in. The house was awesome and when we return to Seattle we'd hope to stay there again."
7543458,52105500,2015-10-26,45316375,Veronica,"We loved staying here.  Not only was it absolutely spotless and well-equipped, but it was cozy and had real style.  The neighborhood near Capitol Hill was great and Kevin gave us some great recommendations for recreation, restaurants and bars, which turned out to be just what we were looking for.  We couldn't have asked for a better experience or better value.  We would definitely stay here again."
7543458,52438293,2015-10-29,46557617,Emily,My boyfriend and I stayed in this cute apartment for one night in Seattle. It was the perfect space for us to cook a delicious dinner and enjoy a cozy night in together. We arrived later in the evening and Kevin kindly met us there and showed us around. We highly recommend and would love to stay there again! 
7543458,52720244,2015-11-01,2059054,Vena,"Great space, well equipped and super convenient location. Responsive hosts, we'd love to stay here again!"
7543458,53483183,2015-11-09,45439289,Hailey,"What a charming little place! Very clean and cozy. Mine was actually a group of three and we made it work with one of us on the sofa. The kitchen was well-equipped for cooking on our night in which made the whole experience quite homey. Not a bad walk to downtown, but we also relied heavily on the bus stop just around the corner. Definitely a thumbs-up! "
7543458,53827244,2015-11-13,30003897,Kate,"My husband and I loved staying at Louis and Kevin's apartment!  I was ready to just move in at the end of our stay.  The apartment was very clean and beautifully decorated.  It is even nicer than in the pictures.  And the bed is super comfortable.  Louis met us at check in and gave us some maps of the area with great recommendations of some of the neighborhood restaurants and bars.  This was really helpful because it was our first time in Seattle.  The apartment is in a great location. There was a lot to do within walking distance.  And when we did have to drive, it was always really easy to find parking when we got back.  I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone coming to Seattle!"
7543458,54317053,2015-11-18,12014244,John,"I really loved this place!!  Louis and Kevin were very accommodating with my arrival time due to traffic on my drive, and then Louis met me to let me into the apartment and show me around.

I had never been to the Central District in Seattle and this apartment was great as a landing base to get out and explore around Seattle.  The neighborhood was very nice, it had a relaxed feeling even though it's right over the hill from downtown.  Everything was very close and very easy to get to, whether that be Capitol Hill, the U District or Downtown and the Belltown area.

The apartment was spotless, and very cozy.  The bed was super comfortable and everything we needed was in the apartment.  I would definitely stay here again, and highly recommend this as a spot to consider if you're travelling to Seattle and want a good central location to get out an explore."
7543458,54795240,2015-11-23,49106267,John,"Louise and Kevin were amazing hosts. They waited around while we were in traffic, had the place warmed up, and took the time to tell us about the neighborhood and answer all of our inquires. 

The place was feng shui, clean, cozy, and beautiful. We needed a place to relax, and they delivered. 

Thank You So Much!

5 stars all around."
7543458,55226367,2015-11-29,28198547,Kim,"Louis & Kevin met with us to check us in and were making the final touches when we arrived. They went over everything in the home with us, told us of some great local places to try. Had a nice array of current magazines that had information of all the good bars and restaurants in Seattle. It was a great location that wasn't in the busy part of the city, but close enough to be there in no time. It was perfect for us and we would definitely stay again. "
7543458,56744279,2015-12-17,49190569,Jesse,"My first airbnb experience and the bar has been set incredibly high! This place was perfect, exactly as described and in a great little neighborhood a super short walk from Capitol Hill. Louis and Kevin made me feel right at home, and I'd definitely stay here again--thanks guys!"
7543458,57397025,2015-12-25,28632245,Elaine,"Louis and Kevin were wonderful hosts. Their apartment is spotless, very cozy (two heaters for the winter!) and I especially loved baking cookies in their spacious kitchen. 

Big, soft bed with memory foam and an adorable living room made for an incredibly comfy stay. 

Both hosts are responsive and so kind. I highly recommend their spot-- plus, it's easily walkable and accessible to bus lines. I loved their cafe and food spots nearby. Thank you both!"
7543458,58252680,2016-01-01,1776113,Mary,"We had a wonderful stay at Kevin's 1-bedroom apartment. Kevin was easy to communicate with and get a hold of when we had questions. He greeted us upon arrival, gave us a tour and provided suggestions of places to see and eat. The neighborhood is low key with plenty of free parking on the street. We enjoyed our stay so much we asked Kevin on the day of check-out if we could extend our stay. Lucky for us, Kevin said, ""no problem!"" Would recommend to family and friends. "
1562643,23693080,2014-12-08,20658977,Matthew,"The house listed in the ad was quite comfortable, and particularly beautifully furnished. It's also within a block of a convenience store and a few restaurants, which we took advantage of when we stayed here and made for a great visit.

Robert was also particularly organized and responsive when we rented. We had no trouble figuring out how to use the Apple TV or wifi that was available. All told, a great rental."
1562643,23819492,2014-12-11,440077,Meghan,"House was lovely and check-in and check-out were a breeze! Thanks for having us, Robert."
1562643,23942029,2014-12-15,22246838,Jared,This was a very cozy house in a great location!  Neighborhood was quiet and felt safe while being close to the city and many of the locations we wanted to see.  Robert was very responsive and accommodating and made the whole experience worry free.  My friends and I had a blast and would definitely stay here again.  I  recommend it to anyone visiting the Emerald City.
1562643,24583353,2014-12-31,835404,Anna,"Great experience! The house was lovely, as described, in a terrific hip location. Robert was not there but very helpful and responsive. I would stay there again. "
1562643,24714448,2015-01-02,798728,Nina,"Robert's Capitol Hill house was perfect for our brief visit to Seattle with the family. It was super clean and conveniently located, close to yummy restaurants and good bars. We would defintly come back and rent this spacious house. thank you again for hosting us! "
1562643,25234728,2015-01-10,8162024,Adrian,"Robert sent clear and simple-to-follow information for how to get to the house, get in, and get set up. The house itself is amazing - very spacious, plenty of bathrooms, and matches the description perfectly. It is situated in a great neighborhood, a short walk away from great coffee shops, restaurants, and bars. The house has a keypad entry in the back, which made it very easy to coordinate our large group getting in and out of the house without trading keys. I would definitely recommend staying at this place!"
1562643,25539070,2015-01-19,3218868,Sandy,"The neighborhood and home were exactly what we were looking for. Rob's house was warm and the beds were very comfortable. I appreciated the quality of the bedding and slept very soundly I must say. Before we arrived Rob sent a detailed list explaining the nuances and rules of the home. At first read it was a bit overwhelming and we had to reference the e-mail multiple times while in the home to make sure we were in compliance. Rob had e-mailed saying that he had guests the month prior who had caused some damage so I do understand his concerns. The e-mail left me a little paranoid about doing something ""wrong"" so I made sure that myself and my fellow travelers all read the e-mail several times. That aside the home was clean and in a good location. It was pouring rain and cold while we were in Seattle but Rob's house was warm and it was nice sitting in the living room or the upstairs bedroom and seeing the stormy weather pass by. I would definitely stay here again."
1562643,25809173,2015-01-26,10433157,Glen,Robert was great!  The house had all the amenities and was in perfect location.  Basically 15 mins from anywhere you would like to go around Seattle (downtown area).    
1562643,27389545,2015-03-03,9797537,Kelly,"We had planned a 3-night trip to the Seattle area, selecting this property based on its convenient location. Arriving in Seattle at 8:30pm on a Friday evening, we were stunned to find that we could not gain access to the home based on the owner’s instruction; a key was missing from its assigned lock box. Unable to enter the home, our 9 person group (one an 18-month child) was forced to wait outside for 2 hours as Air B & B was contacted, and tried to reach the owner. 

Air B & B was sincere and apologetic, but unfortunately could not reach the owner and we were instructed to find lodging elsewhere. We were able to put the 9 of us up in a local motel, hoping that the property owner would respond overnight. 

The property owner did reach out on Saturday morning, stating that he was “sorry we arrived so late and he was asleep.” The owner gave us the combination to another lockbox at the home, containing a key to a different door. We packed up our motel room, returned to the property, and were again shocked to find that the additional key would not unlock the second door. 

Frustration at its peak, we reached out to Air B & B once again. They gave us the owner’s phone number and we were able to reach him via text. He responded, but was more concerned with who didn’t replace the keys than being apologetic; must have been the previous guests. Meanwhile we were questioning… why would the house be considered for rent without first ensuring that guests can gain access? The owner arranged for his house-keeper to walk over and give us access to the home. The house-keeper arrived 35 minutes later, and we finally entered the home. In all, we spent four hours trying to enter the home, on top of being displaced overnight. 

Upon entering the home, we did find a few additional points of frustration. One of the futons was broken and unable to open fully, which left one of our friends without a bed. We also found a fridge containing a substantial amount of spoiled food. Lastly, the floors and furnishings seemed dusty, and un-kempt. Normally we wouldn’t be concerned with these minor problems, but we were asked to adhere to strict cleanliness guidelines upon agreeing to rent the home. We did absolutely leave the place cleaner than when we arrived!

Given all of the above, once we gained access to the home we were pleased to find spacious rooms, a large and functional kitchen, and a great common area. The house is well-maintained, updated, and tastefully decorated. Best of all was the location; a charming neighborhood walking distance to great bars and City Center. Take away the frustrations of not being able to enter the home initially, and some otherwise admissible cleanliness issues, this was a satisfactory trip. 
"
1562643,32955233,2015-05-24,5305969,Richard,"I loved the visit at 710 Summit Av E. Could have used a little more communication from the host prior to visit, but it was sufficient. The house is spotless clean and contains everything necessary for home living, coffee grinder, microwave, etc.  Neighborhood is beautiful. There were good stores nearby, especially enjoyed a prepared meals store which allowed us to buy different items for the family to eat. It was an easy walk down Summit Av to catch a bus downtown. Since I was gathering my family for a cruise to Alaska, we were a slowly growing group over five days."
1562643,33789281,2015-06-01,12008298,Holly,Beautiful home that is in a great location. It was very easy to communicate with rob and I always had a quick reply from him. Great price for how lovely the home was!
1562643,35288329,2015-06-17,21725449,Ginger,"Robert's house was very beautiful and in a freak location.  It was within walking distance to the grocery store, bars, and restaurants.  We highly recommend Robert's house to everyone.  Robert always responded quickly to my emails.  The house was beautiful and was enough room for the seven of us who were celebrating our friends 40th wedding anniversary.  the house is spacious enough so that you don't feel like you are on top of one another.  Thank you Robert for allowing us to stay in your beautiful home and making our trip very relaxing and enjoyable.  We would recommend this house.  "
1562643,37039550,2015-07-04,28928033,Jari,"Great location in the Capital Hill area. The place was clean and comfortable. Small corner store to buy groceries, bar, pizza restaurant and Top Pot doughnuts all just a block away. We stayed during a heatwave 93*. No A/C but plenty of fans in the windows helped cool down the evening. We realized that no one in the area has A/C. It's just not needed. "
1562643,37446952,2015-07-07,28692837,Kyla,"This house is in a great neighborhood, in walking distance to grocery stores, bars and restaurants. 

Prospective renters should know the following when considering if this house is right for you:

The capacity is not 10 adults and there are not 5 proper beds.  Maybe you could make it work with 10 if there are small children.  There are 3 queen beds (2 in bedrooms upstairs, 1 in basement).  There are 2 couches (no pull out mattresses) and a futon (that was stuck in the couch position).

Additionally, you are allowed ONE small bag of trash for the duration of your stay.  Be prepared to make your own arrangements to dispose of any additional bags, or you will pay extra fees to the owner.  We were not made aware of the trash bag limitation until we had already returned home - and then the owner submitted a claim for additional money for the disposal.  The rules will probably now be updated to communicate this to future guests.

After reading other comments about all the house rules, we were careful to abide.  This is a lovely house and the owner has rules in place to keep it that way.  That said, we have rented other vacation properties and have never experienced the anxiety that we had when staying in this house.  Make sure you and your travel companions read all the rules - maybe even twice.

When we arrived, we were able to gain entry to the house through the lock box without any problems.  Guests can park one car on the street with the parking permit - but this is a popular neighborhood so you may circle around the block a few times to find a spot.  The fridge was not cleaned out when we arrived; we did not mind the prior tenants' food in there, but some renters might.  There were old top pot donut boxes left over from the previous guests which they were using to prop up the windows for ventilation.  Fans are provided, but there is no A/C (common for Seattle), so take that into consideration if you are coming during a warm period.

The bathrooms are updated and clean, the beds are comfortable, and the kitchen is stocked with dishware and utensils.  There is a tiny room squished between the two bedrooms upstairs where there is enough space for a futon.  You'll find a powder room on the main floor, along with the family room, formal dining area, kitchen, and kitchen nook.  The nook was unusable during our stay due to large cardboard boxes being stored on the bench seats.  The finished basement has a full bathroom, queen bed, and couch.  We appreciated that we had sufficient linens during our stay.  There is also a washer and dryer downstairs if needed."
1562643,38098299,2015-07-13,1146148,Missy,"My experience as the coordinator of a large group staying here was stressful.  The house itself is beautiful and we enjoyed the stay, but if you are in the place I was, heed the warning - you will be responsible for anything that anyone does (or doesn't).  The house rules are extensive and not unreasonable, however be prepared to be in contact with the host before, during, and after the stay.  It is expected that every person staying there read and obey all rules, and any step outside those lines will be questioned.  

With the host's expectations so high, I expected the place to be spotless, did not find it as such, yet felt the need to leave the place cleaner than I found it for fear of breaking the rules.  I arrived with a two year old and found three different pills on the floor of the bathroom downstairs - luckily before my child did.  There were other things that we had to fix upon arriving, but nothing as dangerous, luckily.  

The only other hiccup to our stay was the housekeeper finding a broken vase that no one in my group knew about.  I was bombarded with messages and eventually was asked to pay for the vase which I did just to be done with the barrage of messages during the last day of my vacation.  Glad to be done with the whole situation, the only thing I can do is to let it be known that others should be prepared for the same.  "
1562643,40891118,2015-08-03,27152795,Daniel,"Robert was a great host. He provided a lot of information and made everything very clear. The house was wonderful and in a great neighborhood. Very easy walking distance to bars, restaurants and parks. "
1562643,41116545,2015-08-04,37844785,Rafael,"Overall the experience at Robert's home was very solid. The house was very clean and neat so it felt welcoming upon arrival. It had more than enough room to accommodate 6 of us and was a perfect venue to stay at for our vacation. Although the home is over 100 years old, it has been renovated nicely and never once outdated at all. The area itself is very convenient, as it's close to downtown and other amenities. 

The list of rules is fairly extensive, but not unreasonable. Just read through everything a couple times and it should be easy enough to follow. There was a small hiccup as the previous visitors forgot to leave the parking pass back at the house, not due to the fault of Robert, but regardless he did his best to suggest areas/streets where we could park and things turned out just fine. 

Overall we really enjoyed the experience at Robert's home and we would stay there again given the opportunity."
1562643,44416092,2015-08-26,13669090,Jim,Great location. Nice clean house. Follow the rules and you should be fine:) I'd definitely stay in Roberts house again!
1562643,45367885,2015-09-02,5556759,Brandon,House is beautiful and the location is amazing. Had no trouble getting in and Robert was very communicative. A+++ would air B 'n B again.
1562643,47953775,2015-09-22,25863773,Heather,"The house is immaculate! gorgeous and tasteful art on the walls, comfy beds, lots of windows and light, beautiful furniture. In a fantastic location - walking distance to downtown Capitol Hill and also to Lake Union. Really easy to contact the host, access the key and parking pass, etc. Exceptional experience! Thank you, Robert!"
1562643,55898607,2015-12-07,3380972,Marian,"Robert's home is absolutely stunning--the pictures do not even do it justice. It is light, comfortable, and inviting, with all the amenities you could want. The bathrooms are beautifully remodeled and spotlessly clean.  The neighborhood is quiet but centrally located, with a Top Pot Donut shop right across the street.

There are a lot of rules, but they are evidence that this host really cares about his home, and it shows in the way he takes care of it.

The parking was frustrating (not the host's fault of course, but just be aware)--one night I drove around for 1/2 hour before I could find parking (even with the zone parking pass). We didn't have a choice about bringing a car because we were driving from out of town. If you can get away without it you should! Once we found a spot we left our car and took Uber to get where we wanted to go. There are also lots of restaurants within walking distance.

Overall, a great experience, and Robert was an attentive and helpful host."
1562643,56770486,2015-12-17,9681169,Heidi,The host canceled this reservation 56 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1562643,58292451,2016-01-02,27128371,Catherine,"I reserved Robert's place for three nights and arrived and accessed it with ease. House rules were quite meticulous which I understand as I'd be the same for my own house; however as an Airbnb, it may be a little bit overkill. Despite so, his house is very clean and nicely renovated; this location is quite close to and from downtown via car but not as convenience without a car. 

We arrived with cleaners that were still there till about 6PM which was a tad inconvenient as we didn't want to interfere by any means as a courtesy. We appreciate that Robert went out of his way to secure a cleaner so we can get the reservation but there were dirty/used dishes already in the dishwasher and there were food left in the refrigerator beforehand so with the rules. We felt that we had to document our stay to make it clear to Robert that this was not part of our stay to avoid any charges or misunderstandings. 

It was a wonderful stay nonetheless.m and definitely recommend it. Thanks again Robert. "
30712,56218,2010-06-22,143602,Hilda,"Lovely flat.  Neat, tidy, authentic. Public transportation nearby, but not close (7-8 blocks). Good, quiet neighborhood, great farmer's market. Sadly, the independent bookstore Epilogue is no more. If you are a independent traveler and can share a kitchen, you will enjoy your stay here. Thanks Al for sharing that yummy Pinot Gris and for the special deal."
30712,64680,2010-07-14,69503,Neal,"Al is a very trusting and down to earth individual - proved when he handed the keys over to me and my colleague to essentially ""house sit"" while he and his daughter headed out of town to the Oregon Country Fair.  This generosity seems hard to come by this day and age, so it came as a breath of fresh air.  

However, if you are an individual who is used to a very clean living space - like myself - Al's home may not be the one for you. 

The hardwood floors appeared to have gone unswept for quite sometime
The bathroom sink did not drain (or drained extremely slow) - which he warned me of
The sofa had an unpleasant smell - which made sleeping difficult

My opinion of the stay, however, may be different than others.  I am constantly traveling for work and look forward to a clean, comfortable night away from hotels when I utilize airbnb, which has happened in past stays.  

Overall, the neighborhood is nice, Al, and his daughter, are very welcoming and Seattle is always great.  It comes down to what you are looking for individually.  "
30712,74465,2010-08-06,162207,Holden,"Al’s place will definitely feel like home.  A comfortable bed, full access to the kitchen and living room,  he even cleaned out a space for me in his garage for my motorcycle .  Al is often away on business and when he is in town he stays in the downstairs apartment so often a guest feels as if he has rented an entire apartment and not simply a room. Al is also happy to help a guest out with advice on Seattle as well as just sit around and talk if you are in the mood (when you can catch him between running around on business).

For those of you who dont know Seattle, Balard is one of the best locations in Seattle. Outside of the few tourist attractions, downtown  Seattle is not a very attractive  or interesting place to be, especially on weekends when alot of it closes up. Ballard has easy parking near Al’s, you can walk to the Ballard farmer’s market on Sunday. Movie theatre and great restaurants all withing walking distance from the place. Access to downtown  is just a short drive or bus ride away.
"
30712,124469,2010-10-22,251204,Marjorie,Al made me feel welcome and comfortable in his home.  He recommended great restaurants within walking distance.  The house has an artsy warm atmosphere with good books and tasteful art.  
30712,289054,2011-05-30,613283,Stephen,"My girlfriend and I had a nice stay at Al's apartment.  I was a little concerned since the night before we arrived, he told me that a longer-term tenant had just moved out, and he wasn't sure if he could dig the bedding out of storage in time for us.  But we were just driving up from Portland, so he agreed to give us a partial refund if we brought our own bedding.  I appreciated his flexibility, and it all worked out just fine.  We were pleasantly surprised that he gave us a nice organic fruit assortment when we arrived; he was very welcoming.  If you are looking for a sparkling-clean place with a newer kitchen and bath, you may be disappointed.  I know many would be turned off by things like the missing bathroom door knob, grease-stained kitchen ceiling,   and a cobweb or two.  But the bed was decent, and overall, we found it to be quiet, tidy, and cozy."
30712,301342,2011-06-06,617299,Erma,"I'm glad I was able to find a place.  Thank you Al, for calling me once I got to Seattle and being the ""extra"" mapquest.

The property is actually a house.  I couldn't figure out how to make the TV or radio work, but it didn't matter.  I only used the place to sleep.

It was nice to find the Ballard market nearby."
30712,347647,2011-07-02,57322,Renee,"We stayed in Al's little house for 3 weeks and greatly enjoyed exploring the Ballard neighborhood. The house is in a wonderful location to explore the attractions of the area (Ballard farmers market, locks, Golden Gardens Park, and local restaurants.) The house is older, and comes with its quirks, but overall a great value and experience. "
30712,486494,2011-08-29,1027846,Gentry,The host canceled my reservation 4 days before arrival.
30712,1218798,2012-05-02,1640513,Rodney,"We contacted Al in an emergency, with a death in the family meaning that we could not stay with family as planned, needing accommodation that same night. Al is the kind of host that likes to talk to you for a while, to get to know you a little & find out what you need. He said that he was preparing the house for a monthly rental & that he was not really prepared for a short term stay, to which I replied that we were flexible. As it happened, the dates fitted perfectly into the end of the month.

By the time we arrived, the place was ready, spotlessly clean and bare. After a chat with us, Al went out and bought everything that we would need for at least our first night, such as coffee, sugar, creamer, bowls, plates and toilet paper. We considered this to be ""above and beyond"". Al kept in touch during our stay, making sure that we were OK, not just with the accommodation, but for ourselves as well.

The accommodation is, as it says, the top part of a small house, situated in a quiet family-oriented neighbourhood.  It has a quite large living room, bathroom with bath, an eat-in kitchen and a reasonable sized bedroom. The polished wood floors mean that the place needs a good sweep out every few days, which only takes a minute or two. The heating system works VERY well, heating the house to a comfortable level within minutes."
30712,1453257,2012-06-10,2576084,Doug,"The owner is super nice and accommodating. Because he was staying elsewhere, we basically had the house to ourselves - a nice deal when you're traveling with children. Plenty of space.  Outstanding location.  And incredible price.  Cleanliness was an issue for me, however.  It just wasn't a real comfortable place to be in.  A bit dirty.  Some ants in the kitchen. The toilet seat was broken. And the place held an unpleasant odor.  It's an older home, yes.  I'm cool with things not being ""hotel-ish,"" but I would have appreciated a more comfortable environment.  We just slept there, and wouldn't have wanted to spend any extra time in the home.   Still, for the price and location, it's tough to beat. And who really wants to hang out inside when Seattle is beckoning?   I'll probably spend a bit more money next time to hopefully get a cleaner place.  I'll say again: the owner is really friendly and helpful.   "
30712,1477513,2012-06-13,2473076,Suzanne,"Al was very accommodating and responsive when I got in touch
with him. I needed a place to stay for a couple nights with my
dog and he made it easy to make arrangements for the same
day.
I had the whole place to myself so that was really nice.
The place itself was comfortable and was best for a short
stay as it was pretty barren- nothing in the room except the 
bed, no t.v., etc. I mainly used the place to sleep. "
30712,1633061,2012-07-04,2086430,Mark,"We were on our second week of apartment hunting and in dire need of an interim place at the last minute.  Al was very accommodating, not only to us, but to the tenants after us in clearing with them that it would be OK if we had our cat with us.

Al's house is very comfortable, with a great living room (with a piano!) and adorable kitchen.  The bedroom is a great size, and the bed was a bit small for the two of us (I'm very tall), but comfortable.   He also has great photos of New Orleans all around the house which made me miss Nola a bit.

Al actually took the bus to the house to meet us with the keys on the same day we contacted him and spent time to show us around and made sure we were comfortable.  He also recommended a fantastic greek restaurant about a 20 minute walk away.

I definitely recommend Al and his great Ballard home as a place to stay."
30712,1661236,2012-07-08,2802249,Michael,We had an excellent stay at Al's cozy Ballad apartment.  Al made sure we had everything we needed for the evening and even recommended an excellent Greek restaurant for us that we enjoyed for dinner.
30712,1760229,2012-07-21,611532,Cheryle,"Quiet and comfortable neighborhood.  Would have been nice to have access to cable. Limited use of cooking due to small amount of dishes and cookware available for vacationing couples.  Al was very friendly and a great host that left fruit, juice, candy and sparkling water for our enjoyment."
30712,1880802,2012-08-03,3108602,Ralene,"Al was great and we had the nice old house to ourselves.  At first glance, the yard needs some TLC but we had a great experience in the house and the area is quiet and well located.  Would go back for sure."
30712,1891282,2012-08-05,2520798,Jay,"Location, location, location. Ballard is great community about 15 min outside of Seattle. The downtown is filled with bars, shops and eateries and makes for a wonderful evening walk."
30712,2315681,2012-09-17,3402115,Taylor,"First of all, the positives:
  1. The neighborhood is great.
  2. The apartment is spacious.
  3. I didn't see Al until the last day. He gave me my space and it was appreciated.
 4. He left several beers and beverages in the fridge for me.

Now the negatives:
  1. There was a broken window pane in one of the bedroom windows and the place was in a state of disrepair. The bathroom door was missing a knob. The screen door was broken.
  2. The place was unclean. The bathtub was dirty, had signs of mold, and had half-used bars of soap lying in it. The same with the sink. There was an ancient bar of lava soap on the sink counter. The bedsheets were stained. On the stove top there were 2 unclean looking pots and there were tiny ants scurrying throughout the kitchen. 
  3. The full-sized bed was uncomfortable. It lacks a headboard and is on rollers. It would push away from the wall constantly. 
  4. There was only one roll of toilet paper in the place. I ended up buying my own so I could, um, survive the week.

On the whole I would not recommend staying here. Al seems like a nice enough guy but the place is not well kept up and definitely not worth the money. There are much better options strewn throughout the city. "
30712,2376828,2012-09-22,3275720,Caroline,"Al was flexible, warm, and friendly, and the neighborhood is quiet and only a ten-minute walk from the commercial streets in Ballard.  But the apartment is very bare bones: it might work best for someone planning a longer stay and really wanting to make it their own, or for folks who only need a place to crash and don't care about frills."
30712,3745398,2013-03-11,846228,Aaron,"We stayed at Al’s place for 2+ months, so I suppose I am the AirBnB expert on this property, so here is the scoop. 

The Short Story: Your very-own complete apartment. Spacious. Convenient to the safe and great neighborhood of Ballard. Al is very easy-going and personable. He makes himself scarce, but he is there when you need him.  As long as you are not expecting a pristine hotel-type experience, you will be satisfied. 

The Long Version :
Al lives in the basement, and you get the ENTIRE top of the house with your own entrance, living room, bathroom, bedroom, and plenty of space and closets. The kitchen is shared with a door on either side; to your place and his, but Al will give you so much space you may wonder if he even lives there, so really the kitchen is yours.  In the 2+ months we lived there, I only encountered him about 5 times, so it’s basically like having your own complete apartment! 

It is pretty well furnished and the kitchen has all the basics you will need.  I have given Al some advice to make it more traveler and AirBnB friendly, so it should be a bit more equipped and fixed up than some of the prior reviews reflect. All of the minor negative items mentioned in previous reviews should be taken care of before you book the place, but they likely won’t even bother a reasonable person.

For those out-of-towners, Ballard is a great neighborhood in Seattle [good bars, shops, food] and Al’s place is quite conveniently located to the main-drag of Ballard (its walkable). If you plan to be darting all over Seattle, Ballard may not be your prime location, as it doesn’t facilitate easily driving to many other neighborhoods of Seattle, but buses will get you around fairly easily.

Al was very easy-going and helpful. He was always easily reachable, and whenever I had a concern, he took care of it almost immediately. He makes himself scarce, but he is there when something comes up, which is exactly what one wants in a landlord!  
"
30712,3991654,2013-04-01,1806034,Michael And Elisa,"I didn't stay there, but Al graciously offered a refund when it turned out that we could not make the trip.  I will look him up next time I am in Seattle…."
30712,5992555,2013-07-25,6922074,Nanna,"If you're looking for cheap accommodation in the cosy Ballard area, Al's place might be an option. However, the apartment was not very clean, and I don't think it had been hoovered before our arrival. The kitchen is shared with Al, who lives in the apartment. We chose not to use it, but we could hear when he was in the kitchen. That meant that the place didn't feel very private to us, especially since there was only a close (but unlocked) door between our part of the apartment and the kitchen. The apartment is situated on a quiet street close to Market street and Ballard Ave, where plenty of restaurants and coffee shops can be found.
Al was very helpful with recommendation to the area."
30712,6310503,2013-08-07,7467484,Van & Anne,We had a great time staying in Ballard and it was a good choice for two teachers on a budget. Al is very nice and personable. He offered us a glass of wine on arrival and suggested some music venues and restaurants in the area to check out. Ballard is a great part of the city to stay with lots of good coffee shops and restaurants close by. The house is well described in many of the other reviews. It is a good value for the price. It is not like staying in a hotel. But if you are looking for a cute neighborhood experience this is a good choice. Thanks Al!
30712,7349280,2013-09-16,7990323,Solange,"Everything about my stay was very nice. I had to arrive late due to my flight being delayed, Al left the door open and left me the key. We didn't run into each other because of our schedules. We did play phone tag for a bit about an electrical issue but he always got right back to me when I contacted him. It's very quiet in the neighboorhood so if you are looking for a city feel this isn't it. I never heard a sound after 9 pm which is nice but for a young lady in a new city, I was a little far from the nightlife. Taxis were very helpful and only about 15$ from the house to the city center. The house was cute and clean with new linens. My only complaint was I was traveling alone as a young lady and the bathroom didn't have a door knob or lock which Al warned me about in advance saying it was being repaired but he wasn't sure if he would be free to fix it before I arrived. This was a little unsettling when showering and using the bathroom but Al never came over to that side of the house so there was nothing to worry about. There was also a door seperating the kitchen from Al's part of the house. I never used the kitchen and the door couldn't be locked which again made me feel a little uncomfortable being a woman alone in a strange place but Al never came over unannounced. In all, I would recommend this place to a friend especially a small family or couple. For a lady traveling alone, it's not ideal but it worked. "
30712,7860756,2013-10-06,2606157,Kathleen,"This is a great place to crash when you're exploring Ballard and Seattle. It's a quick bus to the downtown core. You get what you pay for so if you're looking for a five star place, this may not be it. The bed is very comfortable and a nice place to lay your head. There wasn't enough toilet paper. Al was very attentive when we couldn't find the house. It was a bit confusing for us as we arrived at night and there was no address on the house. If you'll be out exploring most of the day - this is a great and cheap alternative to a hotel. Thanks Al! "
30712,9157086,2013-12-09,10471369,Leigh,"Last weekend, my friend and I took a pretty impromptu trip up to Seattle from Portland. I sent the request on Friday and Al thankfully responded and accepted our last minute request for the next day! Our friends were playing a show at a venue in Ballard that was within walking distance from Al's so it was perfect! When we arrived that afternoon, Al had just finished cleaning up the place and the sheets had been freshly laundered. He gave us some suggestions about where to eat and we ended up taking his advice and walking to an awesome Greek restaurant right off Market, about 10 minutes away. The house itself wasn't luxurious or anything but it was warm, pretty clean and he provided us with some sparkling water and snacks. However, there wasn't a hand towel in the bathroom and the doorknob still hasn't been replaced in there. Overall, it was great for the price, just what we needed."
30712,9314038,2013-12-20,4213561,Carol,"Our stay in Al's house fit our needs very well.  Right location, comfortable space, and accepted our little dog.  Al bustled around to get the space ready within 24 hours.  He clearly communicated about possible concerns that have already been discussed on his airbnb page so that there would be no unpleasant surprises.
I was impressed with his friendly welcome and concise explanation of use of the house."
30712,10414018,2014-02-17,2240535,Michelle,"We had a great stay at Al's. It was super brief but it was the perfect crash pad in Ballard for our 1 night in town. If you want a comfortable, basic accommodation with privacy and peace, this is a good deal. Al is super nice and left goodies like chocolates, coffee and San Pellegrino too!"
30712,10707908,2014-03-03,12570166,Damien,Staying with Al was wonderful!  A fantastic host.  He offered us a bottle of wine upon arrival; took us on a tour of Ballard; and recommended lots of restaurants and night spots.  His flat is cozy and very conveniently located.  A fantastic trip - thanks Al!
30712,10965933,2014-03-15,12633305,Sarah,"Myself and a friend stayed with Al for 3 nights in March. The apartment was cosy and comfy, and was in a good location for accessing the shops in Ballard and for getting the bus downtown. We got to meet Al, who was friendly and helpful, and gave us plenty of tips for where to go."
30712,11575957,2014-04-07,13836223,Brent,"Al was very accommodating and friendly, and his Ballard house was exactly what we were looking for.  A very short walk from great restaurants, record shops and coffee, but very quiet at night.  We would definitely stay there again."
30712,12026919,2014-04-21,13874028,Linda,"Lovely, bright and cozy. We had a great weekend; the piano was a big bonus for us. Beautiful original tiles in the bath and kitchen; large sunny bedroom and very comfy bed. It's a very very quiet neighbourhood, we were awakened by the birds, which was really nice. Close to some really super restaurants.       "
30712,12517781,2014-05-04,12219592,Brian,"Al seemed like a nice guy.  And very accommodating of having a dog.  Kitchen is shared with downstairs tenant.  Location is great too.  However overall clutter/cleanliness could be improved.  Some things like missing door handles on closets and bathroom, etc.  "
30712,12976531,2014-05-16,9470170,Charles,"I contacted Al Parisi twice during my stay in Ballard, and both times he responded quickly and positively. First we had missed communications about getting the key, and Al showed up promptly to let us in. Then, when the shared kitchen tenants had left the kitchen a mess, he got on it and the kitchen was cleaned.

You approach his funky Ballard apartment through an overgrown front yard, and go into a living room with piano, musical instruments, festival posters and 1950s era drapes. And there was fruit and water to welcome us. 

A center hall has a bath on the left. The knob is still missing from the bathroom door, but we appreciated the selection of soaps and lotions that were there for us if we wanted them. The shared kitchen on the right is well-equiped, but it is not clear what pots, pans and tools are for common use and which are the downstairs tenant's private things. An info sheet with hints about kitchen use, wi-fi, and checkout, f.i., would be helpful.

The hall also has a well-stocked supply closet. We found light bulbs there and replaced some burned out bulbs in the overhead fixtures.

At the back of the hall is the bedroom, with a comfortable bed and warm quilt, and good closet and dresser space.

Nothing polished and fancy here, but it was easy to settle into. The price was in our budget, and the location was right. "
30712,14755696,2014-06-25,11024136,Chyna,"Al was a great host. The accommodations however were a bit different than expected. We were not informed that there were two young children in the apartment below us until after we arrived for our 6 day trip. 
Previous reviews stated that the apartment was a bit messy but comfortable. When we arrived we noticed the room we were staying in was very dirty. The bathroom shower curtain had black mold growing on it and the entire bathroom smelled like urine. The bathroom door knob is still missing (that wouldnt be a problem except the downstairs neighbors can walk in at any point. The shared kitchen was always very messy and dirty with food being left out for days. 

These things being said, Al is a very kind person and was gracious enough to let us use his home."
30712,15792233,2014-07-15,17676720,Jeffrey,"This apartment worked out very well for my family and I on a recent week-long trip to Seattle. Al met us upon our arrival and made us feel very welcome, even providing a local beer and some k-cup coffee for our stay. The apartment is a good size living room, plus a very small private bathroom and a good size bedroom (we fit a portable crib/pack-n-play in there). There is a also a kitchen space that is shared with the tenants who live downstairs (a very nice couple with a small child). The location is great, in a quiet neighborhood that is only a short walk into downtown Ballard and also 3-4 blocks to the bus line to get into downtown Seattle and elsewhere. For parents, there is a park 1-2 blocks away with a good playground area, including a sandbox (with trucks) and a zip line. 

The place itself is somewhat rough around the edges, so don't stay here expecting 4-star accommodations. We didn't mind so much, but in the interest of openness and because I know some people care about this stuff, there are some things to note. The kitchen and bathroom both need a serious deep cleaning! I'm sure Al surface-cleaned these before we arrived but they both need serious professional attention. :) The doorknob is missing from the bathroom door  - didn't matter to us but something to note if you are staying with people you aren't intimate with. There were a lot of ants (we were there in the summer during a very hot week...). The bed, while pretty comfortable, doesn't have a headboard or footboard so it is just the metal frame and mattress. Wasn't an issue for us, but there isn't a TV, stereo, or even speakers to plug into. Overall, these things didn't get in the way of enjoying the place, and we still felt it was a good value for the money.

On the fun side, there is a upright piano in the living room that we were told we could use, as well as a drum kit (!) which belonged to the tenant downstairs. The place is decorated with various posters and prints from various music festivals (mainly NOLA).

Overall, while some improvements could be made, I would definitely recommend this place for people seeking budget accommodations in Seattle. Al, the host, is super cool, the location is great, and it would be very hard to beat the price in the Seattle area."
30712,16220744,2014-07-23,17043882,Aaron,"We did not have much communication with Al while in Seattle, but there really was not a need.  He made sure to let us know how to find entry and what to expect upon arrival.  Everything was as advertised.  For $75 a night I think this is a cozy little place that made us feel comfortable for our stay in this area.  The neighborhood is beautiful and public transportation is an easy walk about 5 blocks away.  The house is a little bit untidy, but that's the only complaint, can't expect too much.  We ran out of toilet paper on the last night, which made for an interesting last morning.  All in all, we were comfortable and had a good trip."
30712,16874367,2014-08-03,5080184,Jackie,"Al came through for me in a pinch which I'm really grateful for. He's a very kind man who has the best of intentions and even drove my friend and I around upon our arrival to see the local neighborhood. That being said, the accommodations are honestly less than stellar. All of the reviews are pretty accurate about this place but we had no other options during our time period. The house is generally untidy- the front yard looks overgrown and the screen door is missing a screen. There is even a boat dock out front with no boat! Inside there is a lot of clutter. We did have clean sheets and towels which was nice but the bathroom was not clean unfortunately. Maybe surface cleaned but the grout between tiles is black, there are wet (possibly moldy) spots on the ceilings. Ants crawling around everywhere. We woke up one morning to three dead moths in the shower. Short cab ride to Ballard and Markets streets but a long bus ride to downtown. Not ideal for two young girls on a road trip but we made the best of it. To be fair, the unit is priced on the cheap end for good reason. It's clear you're not getting top notch amenities but the space is big and Al is flexible."
30712,17655545,2014-08-15,19650582,Dillon,"This was my second stay at Al's place in Ballard and both times were great, easy access to Ballard and Freemont entertainment districts, a large comfy bed, and pet friendly... Al will be whatever you need out of a host, whether that be a local guide with plenty of knowledge to share or an unobtrusive presence while you do your own thing. Thanks Al!"
30712,18889078,2014-09-02,5003760,Coco Loco Jewelry,"Als place worked great for our needs. It is definitely the most affordable place in the area that we could find and Al is a great host. Super kind and accommodating. We came to work a festival in Seattle and just needed a place to sleep at night, so Als home was perfect. Its a good budget place in Ballard, but if it was a hotel it would definitely be a 2 1/2 star. It definitely could have been cleaner and the door was a little tricky to open. "
30712,19235168,2014-09-08,19315435,Nicole,"Al was a great host who went out of his way to make us feel welcome always, which was most appreciated when we first arrived. Al was kind enough to have beer and pizza waiting for us when we got to his place the first night, and after a canceled flight and an arrival time close to midnight, was the most appreciated.  He was always thoughtful and accommodating of our needs and respectful of our privacy throughout our stay. He also gave great suggestions on places to visit and resources for anything we needed.  

The listing description is very accurate but reading the reviews was very helpful as well. I will say in agreeance of previous reviews that the place was very clean and tidy but if you need things deep cleaned and have an issue with things like dirty grout than this may not be the place for you -not judging, just saying. 

Then there's the location. Located in Ballard, it was only a short walk to many great Ballard sites, fantastic restaurants, and scenic beaches, plus easy access to a cheap bus ride to downtown. Al even directed us to a place that was close by where we could rent bikes which made our experience even better. 

More than anything what we loved about staying at Al's house is that he made it feel like a home away from home and that you could tell that he genuinely wanted us to have a great stay in his home and in Seattle. We would definitely stay with Al in Ballard again next time we are in the area!"
30712,19683601,2014-09-16,19068958,Ann,"What a wonderful quite place to stay.  So easy to get to anything in Ballard.  Al supplied anything we needed.  Would stay again if in the area.
"
30712,22877021,2014-11-16,1975247,René,We had a great time in our stay at Al's place- loved the piano!
30712,24394346,2014-12-27,3674169,Samuel,"My brother and I were in Seattle for Christmas, and Al was a great host. We had two dogs with us and very much appreciate that he let us stay in his home.  The space is great, and while there's only one bed, the sofa is plenty large enough and quite comfortable to sleep on. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Al's place to others who are looking to stay in Ballard."
30712,25448694,2015-01-16,9433349,Kaley,"Al, was able to accommodate my husband and I perfectly to our needs. The apartment was clean and private. Al was nice enough to leave some snacks for us. Throughout our stay, He talked to me frequently making sure we had everything we needed. "
30712,25587927,2015-01-19,10722774,Brannon Patricia,It was great that Al got us in on such short notice.  There wasn't a TV but the internet was sufficient.  I love Ballard and it was nice to find a place that takes dogs.
30712,25866107,2015-01-27,2640365,Kate,"I rented this for my rep who was doing work with me while in Seattle.
She said that Al was very nice and communicative, however the place was filthy, with a dirty kitchen, overflowing garbage and dust everywhere. I felt terrible that she has this experience while working with me."
30712,26276041,2015-02-08,20611167,Carolyn,"Al was very welcoming, phoning me a couple of times to see if everything was okay.  Everything was okay!  His rental is as described, cozy, though rooms are larger than cozy, clean, and warm with a comfortable double bed, and great towels.  The neighborhood is very quiet and convenient to places in Ballard  that we wanted to visit. Prior to our arrival I mentioned to him that I like having my coffee first thing in the morning so  he conveniently left out a coffee maker and  coffee in the kitchen for my use.   The place is simple and comfortable,  not new and  glamorous.  It suited us just fine and we would definitely stay at Al's place again."
30712,27212087,2015-02-28,4370657,Linda,"Al's place is definitely cozy, and it's located in a great neighborhood. You are walking distance to grocery stores, restaurants, bars, cafes, and parks. There is plenty of street parking, and the neighborhood is very quiet.

You will have the top floor of the house, with Al and his daughter share the bottom level; the only shared space is the kitchen. We had a very comfortable stay in the place. We easily modified some things, such as stuffing a paper towel in the missing knob to the bathroom, bringing extra toilet paper, etc.

We stayed for an extended period of time (3 weeks) because we were moving from Texas, so we needed a place to stay while we located a permanent home. Major points are awarded to Al because he allows pets. We have a small dog and we were very happy to find a place that allowed him.

Overall, we had a very comfortable stay. Since we stayed a long time, we made use of the kitchen a LOT and I would only mention that it is not fully stocked (something Al is working on), so there isn't cutlery, there are limited pots & pans, and there is no microwave. I just mention that so you could get a better idea of what you are working with in case of a long term stay. In case of a short term stay, you are in a city with so many great restaurants that I doubt it would matter!

Now as far as cleanliness, everybody has different standards. Like another reviewer mentioned, it's not like this place has been deep cleaned, but as somebody who stayed a few weeks, I could definitely tell that Al definitely does general cleaning and upkeep of the space. But if you have any issues, Al is super accessible by email, phone and text. He really works hard to make sure you feel comfortable in his home, and he is open and willing to address any issues you may have. He is a really great host that respects your privacy while doing his best to address your needs."
30712,29788937,2015-04-12,7891674,Dara,"A cozy, comfortable, well-equipped and pleasant place to stay, in the heart of Ballard! Al and Angela were incredibly helpful. Would definitely stay here again. Felt at home. Thank you! "
30712,32043412,2015-05-12,3956428,Stephanie,We LOVED our stay at Al's home!! It was perfect for our family.
30712,32225239,2015-05-15,33200818,Derek,Al's place was really nice and quiet. His place is in Ballard which is close proximity to the city as well as the main roads if you need anything like groceries or gas. Nice and quiet neighborhood too. I have short notice but he had this place set up right away for me!
30712,32851129,2015-05-22,2177444,Scott,Really nice guy. Great neighborhood. I'll definitely book again. Thanks Al!
30712,35560587,2015-06-20,28918077,Tracy,"The apartment is located in a great part of town and is very quiet. Despite the unusually warm temperatures we were very comfortable and slept really well (thank you, Al for the fan!). Al was great in returning my call regarding our arrival even though he had a really busy week and weekend. Our paths never crossed actually, but I had no doubt if we had needed anything, Al would aim to please! We weren't in the apt very much during our stay and it worked out great for our purposes. Thank you Al! - Tracy"
30712,40108911,2015-07-28,35407417,Kendra,"Al and his place were great! Quiet neighborhood, close to downtown Ballard and easy to get to downtown Seattle from there. We had our 6 month old baby with us and Al was so kind to even let us use a pack n play that he had at the house so we didn't have to take up extra room in the car to bring ours. Even the neighbors stopped to say hello to us as we were packing up the car to head home. It's not fancy, but it's quiet and comfortable and served all of our needs. I would highly recommend staying at Al's place!"
30712,40532406,2015-07-31,19038680,Timothy,"Al was friendly on the phone.  Once we got there we did not hear from him but we were ok with that. The location is great.  Near a lot of restaurants and markets.  Quiet and safe neighborhood.  The house is small but just fine for a couple of people. The house has potential and with work could be a very nice place.  The bed was comfortable.  It could use some TLC with paint, maintenance and deep cleaning."
30712,42030277,2015-08-10,747927,Kari,"Al's place is great! I noticed that some has commented about place not being clean. My comment for that is that is ""Yeah sure it's missing a female touch. But it's a guy that is renting it."" So if you are really fancy then it's maybe not for you, but I felt at home. And will stay there for my next visit if it's available. Thanks Al."
30712,46168533,2015-09-08,3839744,Zach,Very relaxed. Easy going. 
30712,47381368,2015-09-18,9467509,Emily,"This apartment is located close to all things Ballard, which was why we decided to stay here.  We stayed only two nights of the total we booked due to a change in travel plans.  Al was good on communication, but the place could use some maintenance.  The front door was sticky, the screen door was broken, and the dryer wasn't working.  The yard could also use some maintenance and clean up.  If you are looking for a place close to Ballard, and are on a budget, this will work just fine.  Just don't expect anything fancy."
30712,47732842,2015-09-21,41671476,Alison,"Al was the nicest! Cute rustic quarters in a darling neighborhood (with some fantastic restaurants within walking or bike distance!). Al was incredibly accommodating, and was very flexible to work with us regarding our visit. The bed was comfy and clean, and we will definitely be looking up Al again next time we come to town."
30712,48399816,2015-09-26,11227479,Lia,"Al was a great host - very friendly and welcoming - and the place was comfortable and in an amazing location!  We were so glad we were staying in Ballard, and thought the place was a great deal for the price!"
30712,50485674,2015-10-12,315019,Katie,"I had a great stay at Al's apartment. It's located on the main floor of a little bungalow and Al lives in the basement. The space isn't flashy, but it's warm, cozy, and feels like a cottage right in the middle of Seattle. The bed was really comfortable and so was the giant couch in the living room. Al left us some snacks and wine which we appreciated. We never met, but he seems very easy going about everything. For the price, this is an excellent accommodation in Seattle and I would absolutely stay here again. "
30712,51943184,2015-10-25,1815150,Lynn,"Al was a very welcoming and laid back host which helped to make our week long stay very pleasant.  Although Al's place is in the middle of a family-friendly neighborhood, the nearest coffee shops, grocery stores, restaurants, and bars are just blocks away.  We had both dogs stay with us and felt very safe walking them in the neighborhood after dark.  This was a great value for the amount of space provided, which was helpful for two people and two dogs."
30712,52744191,2015-11-01,42612631,Ellen,We stayed with Al for a long weekend and had a wonderful stay! The apartment was cozy and well located. 
30712,53572142,2015-11-09,23794244,Kristin,"We loved this quiet little spot in Ballard. Al was welcoming and understanding and provided us with everything we needed for a comfortable stay.  When we return to Seattle, we would definitely stay here again.  "
8939736,53528800,2015-11-09,20518255,Brian,"Nice place in a quiet, good neighborhood. Close enough to walk to most places in the U District. Hosts are quick to implement suggestions and keep everything in working order.

The amenities described are very much legit, probably the best included breakfast I've experienced through various Airbnb places.

Two noteworthy details:
1. Wall between the next room is very thin. You can easily hear the next room, including their snoring, and pretty safe to assume they can hear you in your room.
2. Kitchen is on the same floor, not ventilated exactly well. When people cook bacon in the middle of the night (which happened far too often during my stay) the smell will get into your room and linger for a while."
8939736,55570836,2015-12-02,16147254,Lester,"I really enjoyed this room, has lots of space!  Would love to come here agina!"
8939736,55615393,2015-12-03,34226179,Nicholas,"Clean room in a fully Airbnb home, as described. Bathroom is downstairs and semi-private with another room on the floor. Only stayed to sleep for the night, but enjoyed the area and was easy enough to find. "
8939736,55731072,2015-12-05,8711472,Patrick,"Great experience with no problems. Room looks exactly like pictures, everything provided as advertised. Didn't meet the manager as I came in late, but they had a very efficient keypad system to get in and out. Very close to the U district and just 3 blocks from the campus which is what I wanted. Great kitchen access and breakfast options, wifi fast. Bathroom is downstairs in basement shared with 1 other person. It is near college houses so got loud on some nights, and walls are thin - I personally didn't mind but good to know. Overall would recommend to others! "
8939736,56039479,2015-12-08,16972264,Roxanne,"The room was beautiful. It was spacious, clean, and cozy. The breakfast supplies were abundant and a very nice touch. It was easy getting in and out of the house and there was ample parking space behind the house. I didn't get to meet Dario but he was always responsive to my queries. "
8939736,56278816,2015-12-11,50555589,Tyler,Great experience. Very comfortable and enjoyed my stay. 
8939736,56726543,2015-12-17,17685807,Marco,"It was an amazing experience, I love the house. It's close to everything, which makes it convenient. I would definitely stay again next time if I travel."
8939736,56900555,2015-12-19,46862852,Carly,"Really cute place! Plus just a short bus ride from downtown. The area it's in is really super cool, great restaurants. The walls are very thin as other people noted. We never met the host but he was super accommodating via text. All in all a great stay. "
8939736,57222333,2015-12-23,44972547,Neng,"a really cosy place with comfy bed and hearty breakfast. the host wasn't there and i called him so that i could locate the building. everything's awesome except the bathroom at the basement... it's just a little bit small. Otherwise, perfect."
6994406,41627257,2015-08-08,34177967,Mary Beth,"Cute house - would be great for families with small children. Quiet neighborhood. Loved all the little notes with helpful tips. Vase of fresh flowers on the table, nice touch. Didn't realize from the pictures how low the beds were, not easy for an arthritic 60 year old to get up in the morning, haha. "
6994406,42414616,2015-08-13,35978307,Elizabeth,"This was my first experience with airbnb and I couldn't be more pleased. The home is beautiful, the neighborhood is lovely, and instructions from the host were made perfectly clear! Communication was excellent and the listing was accurately described. "
941467,4329360,2013-04-28,1758166,Cherie,"Both the home and Garden Room were incredibly clean, well lit and could not have been better.  The excellent location on Capitol Hill means you can walk anywhere, from Volunteer Park to the restaurants on Broadway, 12th and 15th.  Rochell was a great host, making sure we had everything we needed.  She told us to treat the house as if it were our own.  I would recommend this Capitol Hill Garden Room to anyone.  Every time I go back to Seattle, I will not be looking anywhere else - I will be hoping stay here.  Ryan"
941467,4497218,2013-05-08,4617246,Carolina,"My boyfriend and I got great time at Rochelle's house! 
She was really friendly and helpful. Her house is really beautiful and is close to a bus stop which take you to downtown in less than 20 minutes. I recommend it!"
941467,4616598,2013-05-15,3562665,Armin,"What a great time in Seattle and in no small part due to Rochelle's hospitality and the stay at her place!  The bedroom was very clean with private patio and bathroom (incl. towels and bath essentials).  Common spaces, living/kitchen/dining/balconies where also clean and nicely furnished.  Rochelle was very friendly and available to answer any questions.  Highly recommend to stay here!"
941467,4680227,2013-05-20,5814571,Matthew,"We were visiting our son, who is a grad student living on Capitol Hill - this spot on 10th Ave E was closer to his place than any hotel or regular B&B, and was perfect for our visit.  All we really needed was a bedroom & bath, and that's all we had to pay for.  Rochelle's place is an easy walk to eateries and shopping along Broadway and 15th Ave., and is right on a main bus route, if you don't have your own transportation.  We appreciated the freedom and flexibility of having a room right near the front door, so we could come and go without feeling like we were disrupting anyone.  We'll definitely consider staying here again on future trips!"
941467,4889059,2013-05-31,4104228,Carole,"The house is very well-located, near every thing in Seattle by bus or walking.
The district of Capitol Hill is very lively, with bars, restaurants, shops...
The room and the house were very clean, well-equipped and beautiful. 
Rochelle is a great host, giving us good advice to visit the city and around.
She didn't hesitate to take time to share her hobbies and make us discover authentic american places, even bringing us with her in some outings.
We recommend to stay at Rochelle's house without any hesitation."
941467,5040602,2013-06-09,6437556,Andrea,"Fantastic Place to stay! Capitol Hill is a nice neighborhood. Rochelle was a great host and our room was very clean. We didn`t miss anything!
"
941467,5137547,2013-06-14,4156189,Hendrik,Thank you Rochelle for great time! The room and the bath  are both fantastic. Rochelle is a great host and lots of fun. She knows Seattle inside out and can provide guests with lots of ideas. The location is perfect: the immediate surroundings are very quiet but downtown is only a short busride away. Highly recommended!
941467,5230017,2013-06-19,6149290,Ruby,"The room was clean and amenities were as described. Street parking could be found easily on 10th Ave around the house. We were out most of the time so didn't get a chance to meet Rochelle but she's always responsive via phone. Overall, great airbnb experience. Definitely will return if we visit Seattle.  "
941467,5292945,2013-06-23,4656115,Judith,"My sister and I really couldn't have been more pleased with everything--the location (great), the room (small, but very comfortable), the common areas (very comfortable)--everything was very clean-- and especially Rochelle. We had a medical emergency with my mom--and she was  lots of help exactly when we needed it!
Thanks Rochelle!"
941467,5352953,2013-06-25,2818222,Jocelyn,"We didn't get a chance to meet Rochelle, but our stay was still great. Everything was clean and neat upon arrival. Rochelle was very quick in responding our emails, it was an easy process. If I'm ever in Seattle again I would definitely stay at Rochelle's!"
941467,6611632,2013-08-19,5257856,Natalia,"Rochelle is a great host! She made me feel as I was home. She was very helpful. The location is great: very near to downtown, and Capitol Hill is a very fun place to hang out.  "
941467,6815623,2013-08-26,903887,Emily,"My stay at Rochell's was GREAT! She was a really generous host, easy to communicate with, and her place is really clean and convenient. She provided great details that helped us orient ourselves and enjoy our stay, and during our brief chats, she was delightful to talk to. The room is very private and impeccably kept. The house is close to Capitol Hill shops and restaurants. There is a bus line that makes it easy to access downtown as well. I would definitely recommend her place to others."
941467,7144315,2013-09-08,1991797,Cristal,"Rochelle was very quick to respond and reliable in the booking process. The accommodations that she provided us were very comfortable, clean and in a great location. we would definitely recommend Rochelle's house to anyone. Thanks Rochelle :)"
941467,7212071,2013-09-10,8634786,Christina,Rochelle is a great host. This visit was our first time using airbnb and  we were not disappointed. Our room and washroom were very clean. The garden suite is on the entry level of the townhouse so you don't feel you are bothering anyone and can come and go as you please.  The common area kitchen and living room area are very inviting. The location was great and very close to great restaurants and shops and downtown bus.
941467,7351869,2013-09-16,8679165,Julie,"Perfect place for us for our stay in Seattle. We used to live in Capital Hill so it was exactly the location we wanted to be in giving central access to the city and great jogging nearby that overlooks Lake Union or Interlaken park which is amazing trail running in the middle of the city but you feel like your far away in the woods and our favorite restaurants, including our go to breakfast place Homegrown. The apartment is very nice and upscale, extremely well decorated with gourmet stove top coffee, organic foods, recycling, and very well organized. You get your own room on the first floor with keycode access, private bathroom and patio, and we never saw anyone the whole weekend so it seemed like we had our own fancy house to ourselves, but Rochelle was quick to reply to a text message to attend to any questions or needs. This was ideal for our stay in Seattle, cheaper and nicer than any hotel I could get for the same price but with triple the value. This couldn't have been more perfect for our stay in Seattle and I would recommend it to anyone of all ages. We had a rental car and never had a problem with parking on 10th street outside but your also down the street from public transportation. I would definitely plan on staying here next trip to Seattle and honestly may never plan on staying in a hotel again when visiting other cities in the future as this was my first airbnb experience and I can't believe I don't do this all the time. 10/10! No complaints whatsoever. She even had a spare hairdryer under the sink when mine wouldn't work and we were in a time crunch to make it to the Sounders game after a long day hike, but Rochelle to the rescue without even having to ask! "
941467,7707123,2013-09-30,2539143,Clint,"Great location!  The room is very clean and cozy.  The bed is also incredibly comfortable.  It is a pretty small room, but it was perfect for us.  Being on the bottom floor made us feel like we had our own place.  Rochelle is also extremely friendly.  We would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to stay near capitol hill. "
941467,8089394,2013-10-15,8774716,Lauren,"This was my first airbnb experience, and I have to say, Rochelle has really set the bar high! Her place is super stylish and really clean.  She is everything you could want in a host-- friendly, accommodating, and offers wonderful suggestions for pretty much anything and everything you'd want to experience during your stay.  I couldn't have been happier with my entire Seattle experience.  "
941467,8296230,2013-10-24,8958978,Stephen,"Rochelle is a terrific host, and the place is immaculate, comfortable and homey. She is full of advice on Seattle things, too, but also gives you whatever space you need. We just had a great time staying there: two minutes walk to the 149 bus to southern Capitol Hill and downtown, great places to walk in  the neighborhood. We hope to stay there the next time we visit our daughter in Seattle, and only hesitate to say nice things because it might make it harder to book one of her rooms."
941467,8569792,2013-11-05,9355582,Sherry,"This was our first airbnb experience and we loved it! Rochelle was friendly, easy to communicate with and gave great recommendations. The garden room was very clean, comfortable and has its private bathroom which was a plus for us. The town home is located near everything by bus or walking. Capitol Hill has lots of restaurants, bars, and shops; we highly recommend to stay here!"
941467,8943429,2013-11-27,5814571,Matthew,"We really enjoyed (again) staying at Rochelle's place. It is clean and quiet and the Garden Room (ground floor) has easy access to the street without having to troop through the whole house. Rochelle is welcoming but gives guests their space, which works for us.  Except for one lunch and some coffeemaking in the shared kitchen/dining area, we basically just used the room for sleeping, as we were out most of the time enjoying visiting with our son and sampling dining spots on Capitol Hill. This is a most convenient spot for us, and we will likely visit again on a future visit to Seattle."
941467,9510297,2013-12-31,60227,Jessica,"Rochelle is a great host! We messed up our travel plans but Rochelle has made every effort to accommodate us! Her place is absolutely beautiful and spotless - definitely one of the nicest place I have lived in with AirBnb in the past few years. As a host, Rochelle is also very organized and well-informed on Seattle. The check-in process was seamless. The bed was like sleeping on clouds - best few nights of sleep we got while traveling. We almost didn't want to leave! Meet Rochelle in Seattle! You'll be glad you did. "
941467,9920773,2014-01-19,4508165,Colin,"Although we very much kept to ourselves and never met Rochelle, she was a great host and her place is immaculate. Her instructions were all very clear; we had no trouble finding the place and everything was ready for us. Also, the location is great - there is a great park just two blocks away and some amazing restaurants close-by (check out Witness while you're in the area). Thanks, Rochelle!"
941467,10047618,2014-01-27,123505,Matt,"My first airbnb experience and it was excellent!  Clean A+, Convenient A+, Comfort A+, Hospitality A+, Parking- Easy, even in a crowded area, Access and Arrangements A+.  ""Concierge"" A+ (Rochelle gave me superb ideas and guidance, for the free time I had....she knows Seattle).  I stayed in the small room downstairs and I was gone much of the time, but it was VERY cozy, cute, quiet and allowed me a nice getaway.  The common area (kitchen, living) was very nice, spacious, WELL equipped.....even had food!  Rochelle has a knack for being there when you want to ask questions or need something, and being invisible when you don't.  Perfect. I HIGHLY recommend this place, Rochelle and the Capitol Hill area.  I will be back!"
941467,10373665,2014-02-16,9044696,Maurice,"Wow!! Since this was my first experience using Airbnb, I was a little cautious, but Rochelle made me feel very welcome in her home. The accommodation is second to none, clean, smart, comfortable with great decor. I Absolutely recommend Rochelle's place to any Airbnb enthusiasts. A great place with a great host."
941467,10623272,2014-02-28,11398619,Rachel,"We had a conference at St. Mark's Cathedral (only a couple blocks from Rochelle's lovely home).  Her downstairs room and the common space was perfect for us.  A peaceful refuge in the city.  The downstairs room is very private and comfortable, and we enjoyed sitting in the common space to visit with Rochelle and her other guest and to get work done.  Such a great part of the city, too.  We took lots of walks and enjoyed lunch a couple blocks away at a great sushi place.  Rochelle is the perfect host -- non intrusive but available if you need her.  I'm not sure we will ever choose a hotel again after such a great Airbnb experience. "
941467,11585537,2014-04-08,6397855,Bravita,"Rochelle has created the most comfortable, safe, friendly and satisfying home away from home.  From the moment I arrived (even though it was very late) she helped me settle in her home, get around town and learn Seattle!  During the stay she continued to be a help and made sure I was comfortable and didn't miss a beat in her town.  Rochelle was very respectful of my time and space.  The location is so convenient to bars, yoga, gyms, convenience stores and even FedEx, but still in a quite neighborhood.  I didn't rent a car and was able to navigate with public transportation.  If your visiting Seattle, this is your place to stay! Enjoy! Thanks again Rochelle!"
941467,11718100,2014-04-13,123505,Matt,My second time to stay with Rochelle on Cap. Hill in the Garden Room.  Once again an EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE.  Super clean.  Quiet. Very comfortable.  I had some crazy travel arrangements but Rochelle was totally helpful and accommodating.  I will definitely stay at this great place again!
941467,12127909,2014-04-23,13445949,Bonnie,"We had a wonderful first trip to Seattle and loved staying in Rochelle's first-floor garden room! It's centrally-located, super clean, and totally private and adorable. She is a perfect host and gave us tips on how to navigate the neighborhoods and find hidden gems that only the locals know about. We'll definitely be back to Seattle and would absolutely stay at Rochelle's again!"
941467,12991551,2014-05-16,11636281,Moore,"I was pleasantly surprized when I arrived. I stayed in the garden room. In the pictures it looks a little small, but it was perfect. The bed is larger than it looks and the room has a closet with hangers, it's own private bath and private access to a fenced back yard/ garden area. It was cozy, private, and nicer than the 4 star hotel my friends were paying 200 a night to stay in. The place is located to everything and the host is very courteous, considerate and friendly. I would definitely stay there again. Great first experience with airbnb. "
941467,13185182,2014-05-21,8263697,Katie,"This was my second stay with Rochelle, but my expectations were exceeded once again. I stayed in the garden room, this time, which I have to say suited my needs better than her upstairs room. I took advantage of the back patio for morning brews and evening cool downs. I loved being right outside the front door, so I never felt like I was disrupting anyone on my coming and goings. Unfortunately I came down with a head cold before traveling. I have to say, Rochelle's place was a great respite. She remains the best hostess I've encountered on Airbnb. The cleanliness is top notch, and her friendliness is unsurpassed. Thank you, again, Rochelle!"
941467,13435423,2014-05-27,2258863,Matthias,"I highly recommend staying at Rochelle's. I stayed there for 5 nights because I was in Seattle for a conference. IT is a beautiful home, very clean. The public area, though I didn't use it, us very homey. My room had its own backyard and small bathroom. It's a good neighborhood. Broadway is close by. Couldn't have asked for more. Rochelle is very nice and patient with me, i.e. answered my stupid questions (all of which were addressed in the detailed itinerary)."
941467,13796303,2014-06-04,14486869,Huanzhen,"it was a great time to stay in Seattle at Capitol Hill, the location was good for both to Downtown and the U, if you like to walk, it is a pretty good for 50 mins walking. The host is very hospital, and she would like to give you any advised if you wan to know more about the cities. The Kitchen was good and big, you can enjoy the time over there.  "
941467,14303568,2014-06-16,15838231,Annette,My boyfriend and I decided to go to Seattle for the weekend.  It was the first time that my boyfriend and I were using Airbnb by ourselves and Rochelle was really patient with all my questions.  I was arriving really late at night and I emailed Rochelle when  I got off the plane to see if there were any places to eat around her home.  She emailed me back immediately and gave me a list of good recommendations.  The house is really convenient with a bus stop right in front that drops you into downtown.  If you walk 10 mins there is a strip of restaurant and shops.  Overall it was a really cool place to stay.  It's a little cozy but you get your own private bathroom.  If we go to Seattle again we would definitely stay here again.
941467,14435184,2014-06-19,7189071,Kelly,"Rochelle's house is immaculate. This room is perfect for two people - it's not huge but definitely doesn't feel cramped. (Plus there's a door that opens right up to the back yard!) The bed is very comfortable and the bathroom/shower/linens, etc. are all like new. Everything was clean and perfect - staying here is super simple, and although we never met Rochelle, she was a fantastic host and quick to respond to any questions we had before and during our stay.

The location is ideal, especially if you want to stay in a hip area of Seattle that's not populated with tourists. Street parking was easy without any sort of permit, but even if you don't have a car, you're within walking distance to great neighborhoods and around the corner from beautiful Volunteer Park.

We would most definitely stay here again. Highly recommend!!"
941467,18165178,2014-08-23,387181,Jackie,"I had a fantastic stay. Rochelle was beyond accommodating and made me feel extremely comfortable, welcome, and at home. The townhouse is beautiful and spotless and Rochelle always keeps fresh eggs, juice and fruit if you need a snack! The location is perfect - close walking distance to bustling Broadway yet tucked away in a quiet and safe complex. You will be quite happy here!"
941467,18327251,2014-08-25,13123072,Amanda,"The room is really nice and very clean.  It opens on to a private patio which is very lovely.  It's located less than a block from a good bus stop and only a few blocks to all the shops and restaurants on Broadway, and a short distance from Volunteer Park as well.  Despite being on a busier road, it's very quiet.  Rochelle is also very friendly and made some great suggestions for places to check out in the area.  I would definitely stay here again."
941467,18881124,2014-09-02,17380803,Meg,"We enjoyed the  comfort and accommodations that were provided to us by Rochelle.  The bed was very comfortable, the back patio was relaxing and the common space was everything it should be. Rochelle was very responsive to our questions. We would definitely stay with her again. "
941467,19133594,2014-09-07,3141047,Mette Hamborg,I really recommend staying in this lovely room. Rochelle is a very nice host and I found my 10 days in her clean and tidy room very pleasent. The neighborhood is nice and it is easy to catch a bus to downtown.
941467,19327486,2014-09-10,19795995,Amita,We had a very nice stay in the Garden Room. It was a perfect central location for our first visit to Seattle.  Rochelle sent us everything we needed to know before we arrived including detailed information about how to get to her place from the airport. She was warm and welcoming when we met her and gave us great suggestions about restaurants within walking distance.  She very kindly mailed a forgotten item to us. The room is small but worked fine for the 2 of us and the whole place was very well kept. We will definitely recommend the Garden room to others looking for a central location in Seattle. Thanks Rochelle for making our first Airbnb experience so positive!
941467,19440776,2014-09-12,905128,Greg,"Rochelle was a friendly and helpful host and the ""garden"" room was perfect.  Everything was clean and comfortable. I couldn't have asked for more. Even better the house is in a great part of capital hill and it was easy to get around the city. I will likely be back and highly recommend to others looking for something in that area."
941467,19923481,2014-09-21,14752789,Erika,"The Garden Room was perfect! The room was spotless and very quiet, perfect to relax after a day walking around Seattle. 
Rochelle is a great host, very friendly and ready to help with tips and suggestions on what to do. She also keeps fresh fruit, yogurts and bagels for your breakfast.
The information provided to reach the house were clear and made it very easy to get there from the airport. Capitol Hill is a perfect location to explore the city, and the bus stop to downtown is very close but it's also possible to walk (for me it was a 40 min walk at a leisurely pace).
This was my first time with airbnb so thank you Rochelle for making it such a positive experience. 
I highly recommend it and will definitely be back in the future! "
941467,20121020,2014-09-23,17256405,Mia,"This was such a wonderful experience! Rochelle's house is lovely. Checking in and out was easy with the coded entry - the room is private, the back patio is so peaceful and the bathroom has a great shower. It's nice and quiet, beautiful neighborhood, and Rochelle went out of her way to provide amenities, including a parking pass, when available. Parking was a little difficult, but with the pass, no problem. Excellent location, comfortable bed - I would definitely book here again!"
941467,20301562,2014-09-27,21066202,Doreen,"Rochelle was great. She is very friendly, helpful and prepared all what you Need in this room. I found the House very easy, because the description from Rochelle was very good. The neighbourhood was calm and i liked the area. The Bus stop was very close and I were very fast in the Main City. I Loved the House and my Room with the own bathroom. All was loving, clean and very cool. The bed was very comfortable and it's very quiet in the Night. The Livingroom is Great and trendy. Everytime I would come back again. Thanks for the very good First experience with you and Air Bnb. I like it. "
941467,20725875,2014-10-04,21031044,Jenny,"Rochelle was a fabulous host and her lovely place did feel like a ""true B&B"". Arriving late at night after a long flight, I was particularly grateful for the little touches that made me feel welcome and comfortable - the snacks in the fridge, the clear instructions, lamps on and bed waiting. I never had it so good at home! The house is in a lovely part of Seattle, with a park nearby, great cafes for coffee and food and the bus to town is 2 minutes walk. Rochelle was helpful but not intrusive. We enjoyed a pleasant chat over a glass of wine but I had compete privacy if I preferred to keep to myself. This was my first Airbnb experience and I am a convert! Thanks Rochelle"
941467,20865415,2014-10-06,21740397,Vicki,"This was a wonderful experience for us. Rochelle has done a great job fixing up a small room and bath on first floor just off the main entrance so it feels like home. The bathroom, with its slate floor, looked recently redone, and the carpet in the bedroom and closet looked new. It was cleaner than almost any hotel room we've ever stayed in (or our house, for that matter) and appointed with anything we might have needed. Although on a fairly busy street, the townhouse is in the back row and quiet.  The townhouse complex is small and very nice. There is parking on the main street often and there is one parking permit for easy parking on a back street, which we found very handy. The location is excellent, being few blocks from interesting shops and less than five minutes from downtown. Rochelle has maps and information in the room and was very helpful with directing us to places of interest. Breakfast was fine and her living area on the second level was lovely. Our room was individually keyed and we felt very safe. There is a door to the outside garden that would be very nice in warm weather. She was a gracious and interesting hostess and we will use her facility again."
941467,21301384,2014-10-14,16399114,Chris,"Rochelle was a very welcoming host with a beautiful home. The home is on a main road, near a bus stop, and offers easy access to downtown and other parts of the city. Everything was clean and hospitable and we felt very comfortable staying here. The room was prepared nicely for our arrival. Would be happy to stay here again!"
941467,21400624,2014-10-16,1237800,Gwendal,"Hi all,
You look for a hidden gem - you found it! Not only do you get to Rochelle's place Very easily by taxi or bus (49 right into downtown) but also it is located in walking distance to the great Capitol Hill area. And most importantly Rochelle is an amazing host! Thanks again for having me over and making my stay in Seattle so enjoyable! Great info pack too..."
941467,21629617,2014-10-20,22380715,Tin,"My girlfriend and I just got back from our trip to Seattle and we already miss it. This was our first time staying at a bnb and Rochelle really set the bar high.  From the moment we arrived we felt at home. Rochelle was very hospitable, kind and helpful during our stay. On the last night of our stay we ended up spending more time indoors than outdoors, we played games, had food delivered to us and at one point had forgotten we weren't at our own home. Yeah, her place was that welcoming! Next time we're in the area, we will definitely be staying here. I highly recommend Rochelle's place to anyone visiting Seattle. "
941467,21855583,2014-10-25,905128,Greg,Another delightful stay in the Garden Room. The room is just as clean comfortable and convenient as I remembered. Rochelle was a great host again. Responding quickly and making the entire process incredibly easy.
941467,22025588,2014-10-28,713594,John,"My stay with Rochelle was exactly what I was looking for - the room was clean and quiet in a beautiful and safe building in a fantastic part of town. It was the perfect perch from which to explore the city. Rochelle was communicative, welcoming, and helpful - while also being very respectful of my space. I will absolutely be visiting Seattle again, and when I do, I very much hope to stay here again. "
941467,22357303,2014-11-04,8322514,Robert,"Perfect in every respect!! The downstairs bedroom was cozy and very clean!  The bed and bedding was outstanding. Even though the townhouse is on a busy street it was unbelievably quiet.  Rochelle was delightful and we were sorry our schedules didn't mesh, as more chat time would have been enjoyable!  For certain we will stay again when visiting my son."
941467,22549957,2014-11-09,6064391,Jenna,"I am so happy that I stayed here! I went to Seattle for an art library annual chapter meeting and I had to book sort of last minute. Rochelle was super friendly and warm from the start and really helpful in my trip planning.

 Each time I had a query, she answered it clearly and very quickly. The house rules and instructions are very clear and late arrivals are not an issue. The room was cozy, clean and just what I needed! No noise. Good sleep. The neighbourhood was also really lovely and quite pretty - in walking distance is a gorgeous park and the Seattle Asian Art Museum.  Incredibly delicious Roy St. Coffee + Tea is also only a few blocks away! The bus that takes you right downtown is literally at her doorstep. I didn't get to meet Rochelle  [seems our schedules must have been opposite and I was out from early morning until nigh] but I would definitely stay there again:) Thanks Rochelle for your lovely clean home and great stay!

941467,23323149,2014-11-29,21445628,Guillaume,the place was perfect
941467,23608983,2014-12-06,3680472,Ethan,The place is comfortable and very clean. During my stay Rochelle was great to give me space but also took the time to show me around the town. 
941467,25099893,2015-01-06,21481693,Lark,"Rochelle's Home is unexpected luxury and comfort that I will never stay anywhere else when visiting Seattle. She is the perfect balance between offering assistance and privacy. The neighborhood is wonderful too complete with landmark cinema, a range of restaurants, coffee shops, and walking distance to just about anywhere. I hoofed it everyday but also had the option to take public transport that was also very convenient. Can't wait to have another weekend at my home away from home. Thanks Rochelle!
P.S. - The photos do not do the room justice. It is the perfect size with an ensuite bath - spacious enough for two.
"
941467,25398677,2015-01-14,17607331,Thomas,"I was in Seattle for a few days for an interview.  Rochelle was an excellent host. She offered great info on places to go in the city, and left me a chocolate bar the day of my interview wishing me luck. The room was cozy and clean. Very quiet and peaceful. 2 blocks away from a group of coffee shops and restaurants. Had a great time and would recommend Rochelle to anyone"
941467,25620536,2015-01-20,1133882,Lily,"A superb, low friction experience in every way. Rochelle had thoughtfully anticipated every need and laid on everything we could have possibly hoped for. The large lounge/dining/kitchen was super comfy, our room cosy and it all suited us perfectly. We only had a few days to see Seattle and you helped us make the most of it. Thank you, Rochelle- you can come stay with us anytime!"
941467,26367408,2015-02-10,16393763,Jonathan,"Staying with Rochelle for 9 nights was a perfect Airbnb experience. The ""Garden"" room was meticulously clean & totally comfortable. The communal area of the house was the same. Rochelle was a gracious & accommodating host. The pre-arrival communication was easy & thorough. I'm just concerned she's raised the Airbnb bar too high!"
941467,26713620,2015-02-17,27356363,Danielle,"Rochelle was a great host. I only got to speak with her via email, but I wish I had the chance to meet her in person! She was very attentive even via email and very helpful with suggestions about places to hike and eat in Seattle. The neighborhood was great. We rented a car and didn't have a problem finding a parking spot. The room was very accurately depicted, very clean and welcoming. Over all, my husband and I had a very good experience and we would stay there again."
941467,26969310,2015-02-22,22885694,Tracey,Rochelle's place is super clean and comfortable! It looks exactly what shown on the picture. And she is a very friendly host! Staying in her room feels a lot like at home. 
941467,27409754,2015-03-03,28011284,Pedro,"This is the prefect location if you want to explore Seattle! There are a lot of restaurants, bars and coffee shops near by, and the rest of the city is a short bus ride away. The room is clean and spacious and you have a private restroom. Rochelle is very knowledgeable about the city and was friendly and helpful. Everything about my stay here was positive, and I highly recommend staying here ! "
941467,27678427,2015-03-09,19739745,Thom,"This was as good an Airbnb experience as it could be!!
Rochelle's directions were easy and accurate, and the keyless access to the place made it extremely convenient. The room was exactly as described, with a comfortable bed and private bathroom and patio.
Rochelle made her kitchen available to us, and even left us breakfast stuff.
We met the following day, and she was very helpful and knew the city very well, and gave us great ideas to spend the time and eat and drink well. I would definitely recommend staying with Rochelle; I know I will again."
941467,27823258,2015-03-12,29042689,Marla,"Rochelle is a fabulous host, and we felt at home and welcomed from the moment we stepped into the house. The location was perfect for us. We bought groceries at the close-by Trader Joes and were told to make ourselves at home in the kitchen, which is fully stocked and beautiful. We were able to park our car on the street, and then it was only a 2 mile walk to the Space Needle. The weather was perfect, and the room was comfortable, and Rochelle was inviting and fun! Thank you!!"
941467,28033939,2015-03-16,104660,Ling,"Rochelle is an amazing host! She is thoughtful, friendly and made us feel completely at home. Not only were we greeted with a welcome tray of goodies in our room, but also some complimentary breakfast food items in the fridge. 

Rochelle is easy to talk to and was always on hand to offer advice on what to see, where to eat and even gave us an Uber discount promo code to get around town. 

The room was private, as well as, clean and comfortable - just like the rest of the home. 

We had come down to Seattle to celebrate our anniversary and we couldn't have asked for a better experience! Thank you for everything, Rochelle!

941467,28526530,2015-03-25,28217438,Amelia,"Rochelle was a wonderful host - very warm and welcoming. The Garden Room was perfect for me - very private and quiet with its own bathroom and patio. I very much enjoyed staying in her lovely, comfortable home.
"
941467,28802291,2015-03-30,27920140,M,"Rochelle is a wonderful host, and the place is really great and convenient. The room with its attached bathroom is private from the rest of the house, so if you want a quiet place to stay, this is it. The entire place is immaculate. Breakfast included is also really good--wholewheat muffins, cheese, and eggs.

The place is also centrally located. It's a 20-minute bus ride to downtown and to the light-rail station. About two blocks from the place are wonderful restaurants as well. 

Overall, Rochelle made my stay really nice. I was there for work, but it also felt like a home away from home. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
941467,29505890,2015-04-08,28480267,Gabriela,"My host, Rochelle, was very welcoming.    She is prepared to receive her guests with Seattle information, via text, email and pamphlets.  Her home is lovely.  I enjoyed my stay because her place is clean, comfortable and well situated.  I was able to walk everywhere.  She had a great selection of teas, fruits and yogurts.  I really loved the chocolate, thanks so much!"
941467,30229211,2015-04-19,16303329,Grecia,"I met Rochelle briefly as she was heading out in the evening. She was very welcoming and seemed to genuinely care about my time in Seattle. I had mentioned to her that I wanted to visit Fremont and she invited me to go with her the next day which very thoughtful. Though I didn't see her again, we kept in touch via test message throughout my stay. She suggested additional places worth visiting and reassured me of the safety of the neighborhoods.

The entire home was identical to the photographs. The bedroom was steps away from the front door so you could easily reach it without disrupting anyone and the living room and kitchen were just up the stairs. I found it to be very spacious and comfortable. 

I was very pleased with the location as well. If you continued down the street, you’d encounter lots of shops and eateries. You could walk to most sites if you wanted to but I was lazy and decided to rely on Uber. The drivers arrived promptly and the fares never reached the double digits.

If I ever have the opportunity to return to Seattle, I wouldn’t hesitate to stay with Rochelle again."
941467,30810887,2015-04-27,532577,Linda,"Rochelle is the perfect host. She offers guests fresh fruit, coffee and other breakfast foods in her lovely kitchen just up the stairs. The room was immaculately clean, nicely decorated, and very quiet and private. The location is ideal for exploring Capitol Hill. It's just a few short blocks from Gage Academy of Art ( I came to visit the school) and across the street from the trail into Volunteer Park plus an easy walk to the Broadway shops and restaurants. I would definitely rent this room again."
941467,31386783,2015-05-04,31883677,Miguel,"Rochelle provided an exceptionally comfortable and convenient Airbnb experience. As a first time user, I booked my room with some trepidation. My fears were groundless; the room was beautiful and immaculate. Located by itself on the first floor of a three story townhouse, the room affords excellent privacy. You step through the front door, slip your shoes off and less than five feet ahead of you is the door to your room. The room is quiet, has its own full bath, and gives access to a pretty backyard. On the second floor, there's a roomy and beautifully decorated living room well outfitted with board games and comfy chairs; in the kitchen you'll find a generous supply of breakfast snacks and coffee to brew. The location is great for those that would prefer to explore the Capitol Hill neighborhood on foot. Every evening, we walked down 10th Ave to the shops, bars, and clubs of Capital Hill. Downtown is only a 6-dollar Uber ride away. On the whole, I cannot recommend this Airbnb experience enough. We were extremely happy with our room, and Rochelle is an excellent hostess, full of helpful advice and respectful of her guests' privacy. Be sure to check out her blog for tips on the best spots in Seattle before flying in. "
941467,32268082,2015-05-16,31891492,Anshu,Rochelle is a great host and will explain things if you missed any information. The place is exactly as given in the description. I will come back if I get a chance again :)
941467,32542307,2015-05-19,2033416,Dave,"Rochelle and her home lived up to all the hype! The house is beautiful, in a great location, and has a fantastic walkout garden perfect for an afternoon hangout. 

Rochelle herself was INCREDIBLY accommodating and friendly. She's so legit, she even has her own Uber discount code! Do yourself a favor and stay here...it will only add to the magic Seattle has to offer!"
941467,32732121,2015-05-20,33510757,Sarah,"My stay at Rochelle's home was absolutely perfect! Her home is beautifully decorated, in an incredible neighborhood, and very comfortable and welcoming. Rochelle was so gracious and even took a load of our (camping) laundry to the laundromat! She definitely goes out her way to ensure you have a comfortable stay! I would certainly stay here again!"
941467,33383903,2015-05-27,32074170,Marilee,"Lovely home, room, and amazing back yard. Rochelle is a welcoming host who tries to ensure your needs are met both in the travel and her accommodations."
941467,33649403,2015-05-31,26647166,Megan,"Rochelle's place was absolutely PERFECT! It was prettier and more spacious than the pictures. Her place is a two minute walk from the bus, which will take you everywhere and anywhere you need to go. The Capitol Hill district was our favorite with its charm, shopping, and eateries. We felt incredibly safe and welcome at Rochelle's. We contacted Rochelle a few days prior to arrival to see if we could drop our bags off before check in so we didn't have to drag them around all day. She was more than accommodating and met us in her living room to explain things/see if we needed anything. She provided us with a quick review of the communal spaces, told us to contact her with any directional difficulties, and said she would be available. When we fully checked in on our first night, Rochelle had the room and bathroom we were renting spotless, had maps for us to explore, provided a welcome beer from a local brewery, and some chocolate :) She made our stay in Seattle a happy and pleasant one. We were so sad to leave her home! Thank you Rochelle, we want to come back ASAP! "
941467,34551687,2015-06-09,3287150,Saeed,"Rochelle is an amazing host. She is very kind, thoughtful, communicative and responsive. The place is pretty convenient. Located in a beautiful neighborhood in Cap Hill, next to Volunteer Park, which is one of the most amazing parks in the area.
The room is small, but really clean. Completely private, easy access, and a beautiful private yard :)
Amazing stay!"
941467,35106910,2015-06-15,32274371,Rosie,"Perfect location, as Rochelle (host) states in her description, the Garden Room is very close to a bus stop which is just a short ride into downtown.  The Garden Room is located in walking distance to so many restaurants as well, great when the weather's nice.  Rochelle's description of the Garden Room couldn't be more precise; it's clean, cozy, and her place is adorable - quaint feeling the minute you walk in.   I'm happy with my stay in the Garden Room, it's obvious Rochelle takes her hosting seriously. "
941467,36395874,2015-06-28,31487368,Laura,"I spent a fantastic week at Rochelle's (Garden Room). Clean, quiet, spacious, and excellent location with access to transportation and neighborhood shops, the experience not only met but actually exceeded my expectations. Rochelle has taken many thoughtful details into consideration for her guests and she has helpful information at her fingertips to offer. Thank you, Rochelle, for being such a kind, welcoming host.
Laura"
941467,36818195,2015-07-01,5112465,Ravi,"The description is accurate and Rochelle is a wonderful host! The room is neat, cozy and well-maintained albeit a little on the smaller side. The backyard is a nice place to relax in. The description was accurate and getting in and out of the room with the keyless entry was convenient. The best thing about the location is access to Downtown, which - after comparing to the second part of our trip in Vancouver -  is the biggest plus! Parking was a little difficult because it was the pride weekend, but everything else was just smooth.

We never got to meet Rochelle during our stay (because of the crazy vacation schedule) but she helped us constantly over text messages. Also, access to snacks and breakfast in the kitchen is a real nice feature about this listing. Thank you so much Rochelle."
941467,37087179,2015-07-04,33577222,Long,"Because we had a very early flight in the morning, so we asked Rochelle whether we can leave our luggage early, she said that was fine and set the door for us so that we can arrive as early as possible. In addition, Rochelle welcomed us when arrived even that was so early. The room is tight and nice, and the location is great right on the Capitol Hill, and close to downtown and Market."
941467,37468396,2015-07-07,19923683,Jennifer,Rochelle's place is lovely. We stayed in the Garden room. It was clean and quiet and wonderful cool although it was really hot in Seattle. Downtown is easy to reach. Rochelle was very helpful and answered all out questions. It is the perfect location for staying in Seattle.
941467,37864382,2015-07-11,7527428,Khanh-Anh,"Rochelle is the perfect host and truly embodies the ideals of airbnb. She’s outgoing, very responsive to questions, and we felt immediately comfortable in our accommodations.  Our private bedroom, full bathroom, and backyard patio were very clean and comfortable. Her home is spacious, and we enjoyed having breakfast there in the morning (she provided a generous breakfast selection of yogurt, fruit, English muffins, eggs, etc.) and relaxing in the living room in the evening. Location’s excellent—we were able to walk to Downtown easily, or catch a bus when needed. Capitol Hill is a fun and funky neighborhood with a great restaurant scene. We would most certainly stay again!
"
941467,38133370,2015-07-13,10486770,Joe,"Rochelle's place was well-appointed and a comfortable and convenient base for our weekend in Seattle. Just a 5-minute walk to buzzing Capitol Hill cafes, bars and restaurants and a short stroll to beautiful Volunteer Park and the amazing Seattle Asian Art Museum. No surprise she gets amazing reviews - well deserved!"
941467,38854138,2015-07-19,7368057,Ken,Rochelle was a very nice host and I felt welcome in her comfy space. I especially appreciated the nice and quiet private garden that was just outside the room. I would definitely like to come back again in the future.
941467,39390441,2015-07-23,28305413,Melissa,I highly recommend staying at Rochelle's when in Seattle. I was traveling alone and my first time staying at an Airbnb. Rochelle made me feel like we were old friends. I felt very safe and comfortable in her home. She has some great tips for getting around town along with all the best places to have a beverage and a meal. 
941467,39684943,2015-07-25,38411329,Kimberlee,"Location, location—a quick walk to great restaurants and shops in Capital Hill.  My daughter and I had a great time walking the local neighborhood.  We drove into downtown without a glitch. Rochelle’s home is neat, clean, and nicely appointed.  We stayed in the Garden Room and as the photo shows, the room is quite “cozy”.  We slept well.   One of the things I appreciated most about Rochelle was desire to keep us posted, for example: 1) texting to let us know the room was ready if we wanted to arrive earlier than the scheduled check-in and 2) texting to let us know she would not be staying in her home that night—she included in her text an introduction to the guests that would be staying.  The other guests and I had a wonderful thought provoking conversation that evening.  We met Rochelle the next day.  She was charming, welcoming, and informative.  "
941467,41598308,2015-08-08,2583084,Anna (& Luis B.),Se very much enjoyed our stay with Rochelle. Our room on the first floor with access to the back patio provided us with a degree of convenience and privacy that was unique. Access to the kitchen and laundry was truly apreciated. The house was impeccable and the neighborhood a gem. 
941467,42130060,2015-08-11,31623273,Kristen,"This garden-level suite was absolutely perfect for our stay in Seattle! The location in Cap Hill is very convenient. It was easy to catch a bus to pretty much anywhere and you can easily walk just a few blocks from Rochelle's to dozens of coffee shops, restaurants and bars. Highly recommend brunch at Witness, a church-themed joint which promises ""salvation"" as the main ingredient in the Bloody Marys (on Rochelle's list too!) : ) 

We loved the patio space and the coded entry. The room is very private since it's on the ground level of the townhouse, though the rest of Rochelle's place is gorgeous and she was very warm and welcoming about giving us free reign of the kitchen. Parking was also a breeze. 

We would definitely stay there again! "
941467,42427257,2015-08-13,37298806,Roberta,"La stanza al piano terra di una villetta a 3 piani è molto piccola ma completa di tutto ciò che occorre ed ha un bel giardino sul retro ad uso esclusivo degli ospiti. 
Il grande salone con cucina al primo piano è a disposizione degli ospiti ed è davvero confortevole. Come posizione si trova in un bel quartiere residenziale a 2 miglia da tutte le principali attrazioni cittadine e non ci sono problemi di parcheggio per chi va in auto come noi. 
Rochelle è una perfetta padrona di casa, discreta e fissata con la pulizia...
Noi viaggiavamo con nostra figlia di 20 mesi."
941467,43038960,2015-08-17,20737269,David,"We had a great time all over Seattle, and being able to come back to the Garden Room made it really special. We were close enough to everything to feel local, but far enough away to have our privacy."
941467,43824522,2015-08-22,39887835,Alicia,"Nice stay with Rochelle in cute and cozy room. Private entry nice to come and go as you want. Rochelle very nice offering her advice whenever needed. Location is great in trendy Capitol  Hill neighborhood. Lots of great bars nearby. About $7 uber ride to downtown, or if you enjoy walking about a 25 min easy walk. "
941467,44291598,2015-08-25,24115614,Anna,"To stay in Rochelle`s place, was a great idea! She gave us a lot of tips of Seattle in particular her web site was really useful.
Her place is really clean and full of useful stuff, such us a lot of maps of the city and also she left some breakfast items for us. 
The house is in Capital Hill that is a nice area full of restaurants. Maybe it is not very close to downtown, it takes 45 min walking, but we walked at home several times and it was not so bad at all. 
Unfortunately we didn`t have the chance to meet Rochelle in person, because she was not in town, but she was so careful of us that I feel like I have met her.
Overall great experience!

941467,44573861,2015-08-27,1369635,Nilofer,"Rochelle hosted my parents for 2 days on their first visit to the United States. She is kind, generous and thoughtful. My family had a wonderful stay and we would love to stay with Rochelle in her beautiful home in the future. She is also welcome to visit and stay with my family in Cochin, Kerala, India! "
941467,45244695,2015-09-01,33232540,Kristin,"Rochelle was great!  We were in town for a convention and her place was exactly what we were looking for: a comfy cozy place to rest our heads at the end of each long day.  Rochelle was helpful every step of the way, with directions, food recommendations, and free on-the-go breakfast options like fruit and muffins.  She lent us an umbrella when the weather got bad and let us stow our bags after checkout time so we didn't have to take them with us to lunch.  Will definitely stay here again when we are in her neck of the woods!"
941467,45691415,2015-09-05,21815242,Leslie,"Staying at Rochelle's home was delightful. The room was lovely, clean and cozy. There was even a little sitting area outside the room which was nice if you wanted to read, drink a cup of tea, or just stare off into space!
  There was access to the kitchen upstairs and I was able to put my personal items in the refrigerator,which I greatly appreciated.
  After my stay in Seattle, I was off to Portland, Oregon. Rochelle was kind enough to loan me some travel books for the area, which were helpful."
941467,46489772,2015-09-11,4132328,Sue & Eddie,"Rochelle lives in a lovely area of  Seattle within easy commute to Downtown.
Good shops and Restaurants within a few minutes and a lovely park with an Art gallery close by.
The garden room is very small, but Rochelle's home is lovely, well equipped , a good living space and a friendly welcome from Rochelle and guests.

My husband and I traveled to Seattle explore the city and its many diverse neighborhoods and the Garden Room served as the perfect home base.  Although Seattle provides amazing public transportation, we hardly used it because of the amazing location in Capitol Hill.  Rochelle made us feel right at home - welcoming us to use all of the common areas as she was rarely in them since she works from home.  She also provided us a great list of recommended restaurants and breweries to visit - several of which we tried and were AWESOME!
If you're looking for a comfortable and safe place, centrally located, Rochelle's place is it!"

I had a wonderful experience with AIRBNB. Rochelle made this a wonderful vacation. With her detailed directions it was an easy trip from the airport to Capitol Hill area. After arriving she shared a list of things to do and how to get there. It was nice to know she was just a phone call away if I needed anything. This was truly a stress free vacation."
941467,50273546,2015-10-11,7052046,Laura,"I had a great stay in this flat. It was spotlessly clean, had everything I needed, and the entire home was beautiful. Communication with Rochelle was very easy, as was the keyless entry. I loved the neighborhood -- it was absolutely perfect and convenient to transportation. I'd absolutely stay here again."
941467,50764538,2015-10-14,43306650,Richard,"Super clean, quiet room in a wonderful location. Walking distance to many restaurants and cafes. Many extra amenities, including breakfast and snacks, travel brochures, and use of beautiful common areas.
Rochelle is a gracious host; we're so glad to have had a chance to visit during breakfast."
941467,51457624,2015-10-20,44124804,Kortnee,"Perfect home away from home! The Garden Room was clean, comfortable and in a great location. Instructions for checking in were clear and easy to follow. Communication with Rochelle was easy and prompt. If we are ever in Seattle, we would definitely consider staying here again! "

941467,53006856,2015-11-03,40389870,Ben,"Rochelle was a wonderful host. She was generous, friendly and hospitable. The room was great with a feeling of privacy whilst still being able to use the communal area. And the house is really close to an excellent strip of restaurants, cafes and bars. I had a great stay at Rochelle's"
941467,54188833,2015-11-16,7142558,Beidi,"We had a great time at Rochelle's place/Seattle! Walking distance to many shops, easy to navigate, a lot of privacy in the building. And the  best thing was the bed, it was super soft and comfy! And there were a couple of pillow options! Will definitely stay here again when in Seattle. Highly recommend! "

941467,55146178,2015-11-28,28511492,Stephen,"Rochelle,

Thanks again!  Everything about the experience in your home was fabulous.  The space was clean, well decorated, private and charming.  The private bath worked well. What a nice shower.

Access to your living room/dining/kitchen made me feel right at home and a welcome guest.  Tea and breakfast food led to delightful mornings.

And talking to you revealed the charming woman you are.

I would stay again and recommend this to anyone.  I have tried other AirBNBs and this was the best for me!

Stephen"
941467,57772134,2015-12-29,11948036,Mark,The location was great for us because it was a half block away from our daughter's house who we were visiting for Xmas.  The room was very nice and private and had a nice bathroom just for our use.  Rochelle was a great host!  She was very friendly and spent lots of time with us telling us places to visit and how best to get to them.  She provided everything we needed to make a nice breakfast each morning which was great!  The place was well kept and neat
1782140,8438880,2013-10-30,6218164,Andrew Paul,Carmen's apartment is so lovely! She provided so many great things for us. It's a great location that is easy to get anywhere from. I would recommend her place in a heartbeat!
1782140,8693597,2013-11-12,9019484,Diana,"Carmen's place was cozy and private and in a great location.  It was easy to find and walk able to downtown and many great places in Capitol Hill. Carmen was great herself, gave us awesome recommendations before we arrived and answered any questions we had. She had great communication before and during our trip. She left us a chocolate welcoming us and asked us to chose a fortune from the the little bowl she has on the table, which was a really nice gesture.  I would definitely stay here if I were to visit Seattle again. "
1782140,8826030,2013-11-19,6562017,Hillary,"Lovely apartment in a very fun part of the city! Within short walking distance of many great resturaunts and nightlife. My husband and I arrived at Carmen's studio to find a warm and inviting room with treats and helpful notes from Carmen. Very clean and smells amazing. 

A little difficult to find parking in the area, throughout our weekend stay, the nearest street parking we found was 10 blocks away. 

Overall good experience, would recommend Carmen and her home. :)"
1782140,8891916,2013-11-24,8240738,Mark,"Carmen's place was perfect. It is simple, with the futon in the main room, but everything I needed was there.  The bathroom was fine, with deep cast iron tub, and a cozy shower.  The hot water took a while to come, but then was more than adequate.  The kitchen was great too, and Carmen left me fruit, coffee, and tea, which made me feel right at home.  When I arrived, the table was set with wine glasses, welcoming notes, and a lovely chocolate bar.  That was a very nice touch!  Thank you, Carmen!  

I found the bed very comfortable, and loved the warmth of the radiator by my head.  There were plenty of comforters to stay warm and cozy.

I was a little concerned that I would have trouble finding a parking place near by, but although I had to drive around a bit the first night, I ended up finding parking places on the street in front of the apartment both nights.  When I first arrived I spoke with another tenant (very friendly) and she told me about using the back alley to load/unload luggage, and I found this very convenient.

I didn't meet Carmen, but found her to be very responsive and communicative.  Getting the keys and connecting to the wireless were both accomplished with no trouble.  Carmen's communications are very friendly and warm.  She is an excellent host. I will definitely stay in her place again when I am in Seattle."
1782140,9082132,2013-12-05,9638649,Theresa & Carlyle,"Really cute apartment, very clean, and located in a great neighborhood.  Carmen graciously helped us navigate to her place from the airport.  She was a great communicator and made everything super easy.  Thank you Carmen!  "
1782140,9241072,2013-12-16,6787675,Hilary,"Carmen's place was wonderful.  Very clean and comfortable and perfect for my visit to Seattle.  Bed was very comfy and she left coffee and tea for my use, which was lovely.   Location is great, she is close to everything and you can walk to Pike Place from here as well as enjoy the great Capital Hill area.  Carmen was really easy to communicate with and gave me all the information I needed.  I would definitely recommend her lovely home and will stay again when in Seattle."
1782140,9475843,2013-12-30,3108431,Vanessa,Carmen's place is adorable! She left us delicious chocolate and made sure we felt at home. We would definitely like to stay here again when we are in Seattle. 
1782140,9625299,2014-01-03,9160796,Kiri,"Great place that I'd stay at again. 

Fantastic location, good value for money and very comfortable. 

The shower pressure wasn't great, and there was construction noise in the morning, but the positives out weigh the negatives. "
1782140,9821038,2014-01-12,2608801,Jay,"Great studio and host, with a super convenient location. I only wish I had earplugs the first night because of early construction starting next door, and an unexpected windchime symphony from a neighbor's building. I'd stay again with earplugs!"
1782140,9957759,2014-01-21,10858099,Peter,"Overall a great experience: Clean place, interesting art on the walls, comfortable bed, and great location right in Capital Hill.  Carmen was responsive and nice.  The main drawback as others have mentioned was the construction going on next door, but it wasn't too much of a problem."
1782140,10029184,2014-01-26,9953563,Jean-Pierre,"Great place! Very well situated in a cool neighbourhood. The apt is tidy, clean and charming. Carmen was accommodating and the welcome treats were much appreciated. "
1782140,10143185,2014-02-02,6145871,Tina,"I think this is a great apartment and an awesome location. However, it was tough to find parking. The bed is a futon but surprisingly comfortable. Carmen left us vegan cupcakes which were so delicious. Also, if you want a hot shower in the morning it will take awhile to heat up. Overall great place and good amenities. "
1782140,10453141,2014-02-19,5560754,Meghan,"We can't say enough great things about our stay at Carmen's. Her home is lovely, and she really took the time with extra little touches like chocolate on our day of arrival, kitchen stocked with coffee and teas, bath items, and even flowers to mark our stay over a long Valentines weekend. The location is perfect, her house is cozy with such ambience, and she was super-efficient with arranging keys, etc. She even offered to let us leave our bags at the house while we tooled around the city the last day before a late evening flight. Everything was excellent and we would highly recommend."
1782140,10682686,2014-03-03,11304409,Melanie,"Cute little place, very cozy. Carmen is a great communicator and is personable and reliable. (I chose her place initially over another place because of her friendliness and I'm glad I did.) I had to fly out very early and she was at the place right on time to collect the key. The chocolate was a lovely touch. Clean bathroom, tidy place, comfortable bed. I would stay here again! Great location--near terrific cafes, restaurants, and bars. I was at a conference downtown and was able to walk there every day in under 15 minutes. Lovely!
"
1782140,10996768,2014-03-16,3782739,Raymond,"I agree with what Carmen said about the smell of smoke,but didn't you ask why?how about the broken light,no heating at (website hidden) part is that there is a dirty dish still in the sink.come on,give me a break."
1782140,11043045,2014-03-18,8780463,Mely,The reservation was canceled 78 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1782140,11223282,2014-03-25,12500712,Anna,"The place was beautiful and comfortable. Carmen was accommodating and helpful in suggesting things to do in seattle. The apartment is decorated really nicely, the bed was really comfortable, the kitchen was cute and the bathroom was large. Most importantly, the location of the place in Capitol Hill was central and close to all neighborhoods. "
1782140,11370380,2014-03-31,4538870,Ellen,"Soo much fun in Seattle this past weekend! The studio location was conducive with walking downtown and all over the Capital HIll area. I now have a favorite coffee shop in the neighborhood- and they have great granola. Studio was spotless and very comfortable. Carmen was kind and easy to communicate with.

1782140,11969384,2014-04-20,13872237,Bianca,Carmen was absolutely lovely.  She was super laid back and responsive.  She was very flexible with our crazy travel schedule and very accommodating. She left us organic apples and clean towels. The apartment was very tidy and in a great location. Two items that I would disclose are the bed is a futon and the hot water takes a few minutes to warm up. Not a big deal but may be for some.  I would definitely stay here again and recommend it! 
1782140,12214959,2014-04-26,3646493,Aryn,"Carmen was great.  She left us flowers, chocolate, and tiny fortunes.  We left her two shirts, accidentally, which she mailed back home to us.  The apartment is in an excellent location, blocks away from cafes, and grocery stores on Broadway, and a pleasant walk downtown.  We miss Seattle already!"
1782140,12300475,2014-04-28,5419530,Shawn,Carmen was an awesome host!  Her place is gorgeous and in a great part of town.  We could walk to tons of great restaurants and shops as well as parks!

1782140,12588232,2014-05-05,9624961,Brett,"Carmen's studio was great - very clean, well-decorated, and excellent location.  Carmen herself was very accommodating as well, as she met with my wife's family to check us in since we were flying in late.  Overall great experience, would definitely stay here again!"
1782140,12906204,2014-05-13,489267,Rachel,"Carmen was a great host, she was very accommodating and the studio was very welcoming and clean.  The location is fantastic, 15-20 mins walk to downtown and loads of great cafes and restaurants on the hill.  

The building is great and the neighbours are very quiet."
1782140,13354230,2014-05-26,13714867,Justine,"We had a great stay in Carmen's apartment! Carmen was so nice and helpful. She even left us a gift when we arrived - a bar of chocolate, made in Seattle (yum!). The apartment is in a good location. I love the historic charm of the building! I would definitely recommend this apartment! "
1782140,14778326,2014-06-26,3879854,Bernhard,"Carmens apartment is in the middle of capitol hill. There's no need for a car - the major attractions are in walking distance. The apartment itself is ok. You'll find all the essentials you need. A fully equipped kitchen, a nice living-room and a small bathroom. We felt comfortable, nevertheless there are some points we didn't like. The bed was not very comfortable. As the apartment is in an old building it was quite loud. There was also less space for our luggage.
Carmen herself was very charming - left us some chocolate and fresh fruits. She answered every question almost immediately and it was very easy to keep in touch.
If you are looking for a space in the middle of the action: take it."
1782140,15446441,2014-07-09,337356,Mark,"Carmen is a solid AirBNB communicator who checked in a few days before our trip and made sure to accommodate our check-in time. Her studio is walking distance from bars and restaurants, and only a short (20-ish) minute walk down to the waterfront. The studio is small but cozy, and worth the price."
1782140,16018608,2014-07-20,3521466,Brad,"Carmen's place was great! She made the who check in/out process very easy and gave us some great recommendations to check out in the area. The apartment is in a great location in Capitol Hill. We found that we liked this area the best, as it is central to most of Seattle. I would recommend staying at Carmen's 100%. "
1782140,16552661,2014-07-29,15837095,Braden,"Carmen's studio is indeed beautiful and is exactly as described. The location is amazing, and the studio made a wonderful home base for us to explore Seattle by foot. The apartment did get quite warm during the sunny weather, but thankfully would cool off at night. Carmen was very thoughtful and accommodating, and the apartment had everything we needed. Overall, we had a wonderful stay!"

The neighborhood of Capitol Hill is perfect for restaurants, bars, and cute little shops. If you like the vibe of the neighborhood, this apartment fits right in with it. Everything is clean and cozy. The apartment is very quiet.

As a host, Carmen was friendly and very accommodating of our schedule, which changed at the last minute."
1782140,18983779,2014-09-04,16501267,Jens,"Carmen's place was great for my first visit to Seattle! The apartment is a small studio with all the necessities for a quick stay. In addition to the main bed, she provided a cot for the second guest (although it wasn't too sturdy or comfortable).

Carmen was a great host - she met us to give us the keys and a quick rundown of the apartment/neighborhood, and was always available to answer questions via text.

As others have said, the location can't be beat - walking distance to all the attractions downtown. The Capitol Hill neighborhood itself was awesome too, lots of shops and bars close by. Parking can be a bit of a hassle, so coming without a car is definitely recommended.

Overall, I'd recommend Carmen and her place to a friend any day!"
1782140,19174692,2014-09-07,7934519,Anjana,"Carmen had a beautiful home in a great location in Capitol Hill. The bed was so comfortable -- I slept like a rock! The home was decorated so beautifully, and the sunlight made it even more cozy. She was a great host -- was easily accessible when I arrived, and she left towels, toiletries and got me a delicious local chocolate bar. Highly recommend this place; thanks Carmen!"

1782140,21440963,2014-10-17,16912599,Robert,"Well, Carmen was a delightful young woman and very accommodating.  The place was as advertised a small studio flat with a well equipped kitchen.  For those that would like a central location, this is it.  Broadway is two small blocks away with lots of choices.  This neighborhood, though up and coming in Seattle, has, shall we say a lot of character.  Funky shops, cool bars and coffee shops, budget and expensive trendy eateries and lots of ""interesting"" folks to say the least...love it."

The apartment is in an old but renovated building and has a certain charme to it. ;) it's in a nice neighborhood, walking to downtown takes ~20minutes. 
Besides that the bed was a little bit too soft for us (but that's just personal  preference), we had a great stay and would recommend her place to our friends. "

While my wife and I did not get to meet her in person, she was very responsive and everything was exactly as she said it would be. Her apartment is well located, clean, quiet and close to everything in Capitol Hill. The only downside: we stayed during a major heat wave and there's no a/c, so the place was quite toasty. That aside, our stay was extremely enjoyable."

8153673,46663691,2015-09-12,16516213,Timmy,"Fabios place was so nice and homie, extremely clean and had all the facilities needed and more. He showed me how to use everything and made sure we were all comfortable. The bathroom is beautiful and large, a lot of storage too if you wish to unpack. The town is so quiet and very family orientated but still so close to downtown, about 10-15 minute drive depending on traffic, so many restaurants and shops only about 5 minutes drive away. Fabio was the perfect host, checking on us to make sure we had everything and whether we needed anything more, he also gave us some great places to go visit and was very helpful in his knowledge of Seattle. I hope to be back soon and if I am I will definitely be staying here. Do yourself a favour and book it. Thanks Fabio "

The unit is is even better than it appears in the photographs.  The gas fireplace turned on with a switch and was wonderful after a day is the Seattle drizzle.  We did not cook, but there is a full kitchen available.    There is a bus line half a block away and UW is about 2 miles.  I decided to walk instead of take the bus and it took me about 45 minutes, much of it on the Burke-Gilman. I recommend this apartment very highly."
4863533,39248134,2015-07-21,7704843,Henryk,Tucker was very accommodating and flexible to our needs. The house is in a great neighborhood of Seattle with lots of great food and cafes nearby.

He left clear Instruction for everything. The space was great for what I needed. There is an odor not bad but strong. Maybe due to old carpet? Pet hair was everywhere.

He gave clear directions on the house, with a great summary of the home's history, and instructions on various aspects:  garbage management, how to get transport to downtown, local sites, etc.  The home is very well appointed with all the things you could need for a stay, and is beautiful with wonderful views of Lake Washington from both floors, and even Mt. Ranier from the master bedroom upstairs.  We fully enjoyed our stay and would readily stay there again.  It is so much more relaxing than a hotel, and in a quiet part of town with easy transport and routes to the sites of Seattle.  "

Das Haus befindet sich in einer ruhigen Wohnsiedlung auf einem sehr gepflegten Grundstueck in traumhafter Lage mit einem fantastischen Blick auf Lake Washington, es ist sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet, sehr sauber und die Kueche ist sehr gut ausgestattet. Es hat uns an nichts gefehlt! Die Bushaltestelle nach Downtown Seattle ist fusslaeufig ca. 2 Minuten vom Haus entfernt, die Fahrt nach Downtown dauert ca. 20 min. Sarah und John sind sehr zuvorkommende und nette Gastgeber. Es war bisher sicherlich eines der besten Unterkuenfte, in denen wir unseren Urlaub verbracht haben. Wir wuerden diese Unterkunft jederzeit wieder buchen."
1377812,15823500,2014-07-16,11584534,Brewer,"John & Sarah were terrific hosts.  Their house was outstanding. Woke up to wonderful views every morning.

The house was gorgeous- even lovelier than the pictures -  beautifully decorated with amazing views of Lake Washington.  It was a short walk to a little commercial area with a Starbucks, a grocery store, and a couple of restaurants, along with a trail around the lake and a tiny little beach.  The house was also an easy, quick drive to Pike's Place Market and other spots around town - very conveniently situated to visiting sites around the city.

John and Sarah were lovely - kind, quiet, and welcoming.  They live right next door so it was easy to ask questions if we needed anything.  John was also very response prior to our visit and managed to borrow a portable crib for our baby to sleep in.  So nice of him!

Parking no problem, and just a quick drive to downtown or to jump on the highway to get to points east like Bellevue. "
1377812,18402218,2014-08-26,16093753,Mishna,"John and Sarah provided great details about getting there and settling in.  The place exceeded my expectations looks and size wise.  This was a family trip, so I needed real bedrooms to nap kids in.  And this totally fit that bill.  The location was phenomenal for our purposes.  I grew up not far away and there's nothing really comparable lakeside.    "

Host gave instructions how to get in and even allowed us to check in a bit earlier than planned.  Nice kitchen, cable tv, wi fi, etc. Breathtaking views of lake.

1377812,23371745,2014-11-30,22444194,Kathy,We loved our stay over Thanksgiving at John and Sarah's home.  The 100 year old home was restored beautifully.  There were sitting areas outside overlooking the lake as well as under a covered patio and up in the park like yard.  It was so warm and inviting as were our hosts! Sarah shared some Swedish wine with us and John fixed a drain clog on Thanksgiving morning!! Parking was always available and they left great detailed information about restaurants and sights in the area.

We would stay there again!"
1377812,27931913,2015-03-15,4811797,Leslie,"John was really responsive but they left us plenty of privacy.  We didn't reach out much and it seemed like they were totally fine with that.
We are a family of four including a toddler and a baby and we were happy we chose this place because we could enjoy the beautiful view when we were around the house for things like naps.  It was really nice to walk down to the waterfront and to the little neighborhood market.  We cooked most of our meals at the house.
We also (without kids) rode bikes into town using the multi-use off-road path network (we took the Mountains to Sound path).
"

The home is very accommodating and very comfortable.  We would go back in a heart beat. Thanks for everything!"

John and Sarah's house is great, the location is wonderful (right on the lake, with food and coffee just around the corner), and the bus service to downtown or Capitol Hill worked a treat. We really landed on our feet."
1377812,39733128,2015-07-26,28935496,Stephanie,"John  and Sarah have a beautiful home on Lake Washington with the view as advertised!  They emailed ahead to confirm our arrival and confirm entry details if our plane was late.  
The home was ready for our entry and had all the necessities for us--coffee, toiletries, iron, and blow dryer.  They even brought over a fan for an unexpected heat wave in the area.  
The market close by had essentials.  Starbucks and the restaurants in that area provided dining when we wanted to stick close to home.  
The walking/running path along the river was great for keeping up our workout routine.  
We chose to use the bus system to navigate around the city.  The stops are close and Google maps gives great estimates of the bus arrival times and the route to take. "
1377812,40607225,2015-08-01,35912337,Cindy,"We had a great time- wonderful hosts and view was gorgeous!  John and Sarah, congrats on the upcoming new arrival!! "
1377812,41590889,2015-08-08,6176755,Adam,"What a beautiful house, in a great location, with a truly breathtaking view! John was welcoming and easy to deal with. Only small hitch was that the wifi was not very strong, an issue if you're trying to work there. "
1377812,42735024,2015-08-15,37175437,Kate,"John and Sarah were fantastic hosts, and their home is beautiful. The views are exactly as shown in the picture, and the neighborhood is both charming and delightful! We like to be out and about, and (even though it was a duplex) it didn't seem to be an issue for us to come in late. We had a wonderful trip, and are very happy that we chose to stay at this property. "
1377812,43527412,2015-08-20,943212,Grace,Wonderful stay in an incredible house. John and Sarah were exceptional hosts and very welcoming of our big family. We loved waking up with views of the water and making our way down to walk along the lake first thing. Thanks for a great stay!
1377812,45347833,2015-09-01,41321216,Jim,"John and Sarah are gracious and responsive hosts, and their home is absolutely beautiful.  Everything was as-described, except for the lovely view from the back deck, which is indescribable.  As for location, this home is, at once, near to everything we wanted to visit, and apart enough that we really felt we had cornered a little part of the city all to ourselves.  The Leschi neighborhood itself is peaceful and lovely, and the Martins were thoughtful in providing a written description and guide to some of the area's points of interest.  On the two occasions I had to reach out to the Martins with a question, their responses were very quick and helpful.

In short, this was a perfect experience for our family, and we will definitely recommend this location to friends visiting Seattle."
1377812,46007674,2015-09-07,8972888,Rohan,John and Sarah have a beautiful house and in a superb location.  We had a wonderful time

1377812,47970387,2015-09-22,38293394,Lisa,This house was absolutely perfect for our Seattle trip.  The views of the lake are stunning and makes one feel you have discovered a bit of paradise.  There are restaurants and a market within walking distance.  The house itself is beautifully decorated and the kitchen is well equipped.  We would definitely consider staying here again.  Communication with John and Sarah was fantastic.  
1377812,55093972,2015-11-28,27808867,Lena,"The house and the view was fantastic! Everything was nice and clean. The house is very central to almost everywhere in Seattle. We had a great time and would recommend this house strongly to anyone who wants to visit Seattle. We would go there again. Feels very cozy and not like a hotel at all.

Thank you John and Sarah for your hospitality...and the gluhwein! We enjoyed staying at your place very much!"
53803,124627,2010-10-22,114068,Steve,"I completely enjoyed my stay. Graham is a great guy to hang out with and my stay was completely painless. No ""checking in and checking out"" time wasters and everything was ready to go when I arrived. 

All in all, a painless experience. Highly recommended. "
53803,130159,2010-10-30,273759,Cory,"Graham's Place is the place! If you are looking for a great clean place in the perfect location to explore, eat and drink.....pick Graham's place. If you are having a mid life crisis and want a instant best friend with a cold beer....pick Graham. I did and I couldn't have been happier. Thanks Graham"
53803,131565,2010-11-01,267561,Matthew,"Graham was an excellent host and we'd be glad to stay with him again. The bed was ridiculously comfy, the house warm and inviting and I could see spending another weekend or a whole week in Fremont.

Again, a perfect place from which to experience Seattle and a knowledgeable and friendly host to guide you. That's the best I could ask for.

Thanks Graham!"
53803,143393,2010-11-23,262611,Jane,"Graham is just super. His place is just like home, that is if you lived in one of the best neighborhoods in Seattle! We had a quick overnight stay, but Graham was super helpful with info anout stuff to do and restaurants. Thanks,we will be back for sure."
53803,178070,2011-02-04,123890,Mia,"Graeme is super friendly and the place is really well set up!  Fremont is a great neighborhood and it's really easy to get into Downtown (bus is close by). Good kitchen if you want to do some cooking but also allot of great cheap restaurants around the place. 

We really enjoyed the stay and would happily stay again next time we're in Seattle. "
53803,203899,2011-03-20,415737,Leah,"The house is very very nice, we had everything we needed and more. I would reccommend this location to ANYONE visiting the Seattle area. Graham was super friendly and accommodating! "
53803,207291,2011-03-23,268379,Danielle,"My girlfriends and I stayed for two nights at Graham's place. We easily walked, bussed, and cabbed all over the city from his Fremont location. It was really nice to have a mellow place to crash where we felt welcome. The bed was amazing,our room felt very private, and overall his entire space was very clean and inviting. As others have posted, he definitely made us feel at home. 
Thanks again Graham!"
53803,217201,2011-04-04,204871,Greg,"Graham was quite flexible in meeting us at his place on a Friday evening.  The rooms are comfortable and clean.  My wife and I enjoyed walking in the neighborhood, and the bus stop is only a block away.  We found Graham's tales of traveling in South America captivating.  He also has a very large collection of Lonely Planet books (not to mention Seattle guidebooks) if you ever get bored."
53803,219452,2011-04-06,119700,Heather,"sorry..had a great stay with Graham.  Place was as advertised,host there to provide info and directions.  I highly recommend this stay place.  Felt like a friend of a friend.  Nice accommodations too.  I never checked this part of (email hidden) late but still all good I am sure."

53803,261229,2011-05-12,562554,Rebekah,"Would absolutely recommend Graham's B&B! Fantastic house, fantastic location, fantastic host!"
53803,270623,2011-05-19,440375,Ben,"Graham's place is awesome, I was actually shocked that the room was so good, nice ensuite and walk-in wardrobe. The area is amazing as well, you almost dont need to venture in to the main part of the city (of course you should though!)."
53803,281116,2011-05-25,232908,Mike,"Graham was a fantastic host. His place is in one of the best parts of Seattle, and is quite easy to get to either by car or public transport. The place is a great setup and is quite a social place. We tagged along with Graham to the Sunday markets in Fremont and Ballard, and ended up heading for a drink one of the nights we were there.

An absoulte pleasure.

"
53803,295691,2011-06-03,527994,Stacie,"Graham has his finger on the pulse of the traveler’s needs.  One of the unique things about staying at his zen-like home (besides his neighborhood which is awesome) is the fact that he is a traveler, making him extremely conscientious of the traveler’s needs and wants; he’s efficient and unobtrusive, incredibly helpful and just a really cool guy.  I give this Airbnb home and host “two big thumbs up”!"
53803,302179,2011-06-07,526560,Elias,"My girlfriend and I had a great visit to Seattle and Graham's Fremont apartment was the perfect jumping off point for exploring the city.  Easy walk around the corner to the cafe, a cool grocery store, tasty burger and sandwich joints, and the bus link, which took us quickly downtown or over to Ballard for a jog across the locks into Discovery Park.  Wouldn't have wanted to stay anywhere else in the city.  Apartment was spacious and clean, with a healthy collection of guide books and maps - we really dug the giant photos on the walls from Bolivia.  Graham was professional and accessible.  We both certainly recommend his apartment highly."
53803,315841,2011-06-15,537842,Janet,"I was visiting a new grandchild, so I didn't plan to stay much in my room.  However, whenever I was at Fremont, I felt so at-home, as though it was my home.  I shopped for my breakfasts, and cooked in the communal kitchen, met other guests, and spoke several time to Graham, himself...a really charming young man!!  I'll stay there every chance I get to follow-up on that grandson!"
53803,319497,2011-06-17,544617,Chris,Graham was very accomodating and made my experience in Seattle the best I've ever had. His house may seem far from downtown but the city transportation was easy to navigate if one chooses to tour the city. I had everything I needed while I stayed and enjoyed the room. If I'm ever in the area again I will be sure to call Graham first no doubt about it.
53803,331709,2011-06-24,613450,Carina,"Graham's house is a great place to stay, for holiday or business. The spacious bedroom has a comfortable bed and its own bath, and we could use the kitchen. The house is clean and well-organized.  
Graham is a great host, he recommended a great restaurant very nearby.    When we came home from dinner, we spent some time chatting with the guest from room 1 in the living room. It's really like staying with friends!"
53803,345888,2011-07-01,630099,Diana,"Stayed in Awesome Fremont Location! Room 2, which was just as advertised. Awesome. Location was great, close to great cafes and restaurants and a short bus ride to downtown. Graham stocks the room with helpful books and maps of Seattle, which came in quite handy! We met him in passing when we arrived and he was very friendly. Communications were also great before arriving to the destination, complete with full directions from the airport to his place. I would definitely stay again!"
53803,356153,2011-07-06,262611,Jane,"Room 2 is a little smaller than Room1 at this Awesome Fremont location but still has a great bathroom, nice light and a huge walk in closet if you are there for and extended stay. We did not see our host once, which is just fine with us since we were there to get away. Don't get me wrong, Graham was in great communication and has an amazing place to stay. It is located in a great neighborhood and relaxing around the house feels just like beng at home. There is a great selection of travel books to get you ready for your next adventure!"
53803,358145,2011-07-07,429467,Joyce,"G was a cheerful and enthusiastic host.  I stayed with my mom, booking both rooms upstairs, which was great as we both had our own bed and bath for a great price.  The neighborhood was quiet, the beds very comfy, internet great.  We had a beautiful tour of the neighborhood in the morning on our way into the heart of the city.

Recommend!"
53803,407710,2011-07-30,873437,Alyssa,"As a first AirBnB stay, Graham's place and hospitality were a dream. His place is lovely: modern, clean, homey and just around the corner from some spectacular cuban sandwiches.

Graham has thought of everything, and provides just the right vibe for a traveller: I especially liked the little touches of leaving leaflets and maps of the city in the room.

We will certainly see if he has space next time we're in the area."
53803,415875,2011-08-02,854479,Tonia,"The house is excellent, confortable and so beautiful and Graham Clark is very friendly and polite.
I recomend his house."
53803,423020,2011-08-06,471652,Julien_et_Mélanie,"Graham nous a envoyé toutes les indications pour vivre 3 jours dans cette belle maison. 
Tout était propre et pratique. 
Le quartier Fremont et le Green nous ont beaucoup plu et sont très facilement accessibles à pieds. 

La salle de bain dans la chambre est très appréciée. Les guides touristiques de la ville sont très pratiques à utiliser pour un séjour. 
-----------
Graham sent us all the information to live three days in this beautiful house.
Everything was clean and convenient.
The Fremont neighborhood and Green Lake have are nice and easily accessible by foot.

The bathroom in the room is much appreciated. Graham's City guides of Seattle are great to use for a stay.
"
53803,430301,2011-08-08,912461,Rion,Great location with easy access to many of Seattle's attractions. Graham was also a great host and easy to communicate with. I would recommend this room to anyone.
53803,451335,2011-08-16,30744,Andre,"Had a great time at Graham's! He has a great space and is in Fremont, a wonderful Seattle neighborhood with easy access to restaurants, bars and downtown.

I would definitely stay there again."
53803,472845,2011-08-24,963293,Gonzalo,Very clean and spacious accomodation. Close to restaurants and bars.    He had guides to the city and surrounding ares and fresh towels at our door.  It was a great experience...thanks Graham!
53803,480592,2011-08-28,590232,Adrian,"We got to Graham's place without any problem. Take note that his place is kind of behind another house. When we got there we were greeted by Graham and his dog Sophie. Graham was caring and made sure that we got there safely and even attempted to reach me by phone, unfortunately my cellphone was turned off. Graham's place is huge and welcoming. The room, bathroom and walking closet were more than we expected for the price (we got upgraded due to the other room being vacant!). Fremont is not far from Ballard, the part of town where ate and hung out the most. Just a few minutes by bus and you're there! Many thanks to Graham and we'd love to stay at his place again! Adrian and Connie"
53803,491253,2011-08-31,998504,Jeannie,"We really enjoyed our visit to Seattle and our first experience with Airbnb.  Graham made a great host.  He offered to meet us at our bus stop when we (he) discovered we were pretty inept at working thru the transit system for our first time.  As a non-city girl, I will think long and hard before I try Seattle's Metro Line again.  The room was everything I expected and we settled in right away.  "
53803,513735,2011-09-08,956903,John,"We had fun during our one week stay with Graham. Both Graham and his dog Sophie were very friendly and Graham made sure he was available if we had any questions about the place or needed suggestions for places to go and eat in Seattle. After hearing I was a cyclist, he even offered to lend me his bike to use!

The Fremont location, while a few miles from downtown, is very close to a bus stop that gets you to downtown in about 10 minutes. It is also close to Ballard, Fremont, and Wallingford downtowns--walkable even. The place is cozy and convenient and Graham makes you feel at home."
53803,525333,2011-09-12,94206,Alexa,"Graham's townhouse was extremely comfortable! The location is fantastic and Graham was very welcoming. We enjoyed the sunlight in the common kitchen/living room and the comfy bed. 
"
53803,581224,2011-09-29,99852,Dawn,"Absolutely beautiful place in a perfect, central location.  Shops, restaurants (try Paseo's sandwiches!) , and transportation nearby.  Graham was a kind host and knew the local scene well.  Highly recommended! "
53803,21400797,2014-10-16,19229585,Aaron,"This apartment was lovely and spacious, and decorated with many beautiful photos. We were supplied with everything we needed to make our stay comfortable. The teas and ice-making fridge were a bonus! The apartment is in a great location, and is only a short walk to a supermarket, restaurants and busses to the city."
53803,24497745,2014-12-29,24801983,Mary,"We enjoyed this well-located, roomy 3-story condo with free on-street-only parking for a week over the holidays.  Graham kindly checked in to see that we had everything we needed. The unit could use a little TLC, and the mattresses--at least in room 1--replaced, but all the necessities were available, including the use of a clothes washer and drier.  Thank you, Graham and Maria, for accommodating us at the last minute!"
53803,24959079,2015-01-04,2599610,Jacqui,"Maria provided timely and friendly communication and the place was perfect -clean, quiet & homely."
53803,26695032,2015-02-17,26370933,Lee,It was a great place to stay and Maria was most accommodating. I highly recommend this Townhouse to potential guests.
53803,42331390,2015-08-12,12532062,Rutger,"The perfect experience! Very spacious townhouse, perfect beds, nice bars/restaurants just a couple of blocks away. I would definitely recommend this place. Thanks guys!"
53803,46675493,2015-09-12,4407432,Antoinette,"Loved this modern townhouse in fabulous location. Fremont is a great neighborhood in Seattle that I was glad I got the chance to explore. Only wish I had more free time to enjoy it! 

I would definitely rent this townhouse again. Thank you for sharing it with us on our trip."
53803,47219892,2015-09-16,15792437,Loree,"Great place to stay for a few days while visiting our daughter. Location is excellent, apartment was lovely, hosts were responsive to questions, and there was food and beverages for us in the cupboards and refrigerator! Nice!"
1672979,9170762,2013-12-10,4441944,Bill,"Wonderful south Seattle hideaway. Heather and Jorge were warm, friendly, welcoming hosts. Our room was clean and the bed super comfy and the soft fuzzy robes were a really nice touch. Nice selection of breakfast foods. If you are lucky you might just get some of Heather's home-made brownies or zucchini bread. Highly recommended. "
1672979,14057654,2014-06-10,12455079,Robert,"Charming and comfortable home on a quiet street.  We had a great experience.

1672979,18953795,2014-09-03,18408657,Brandon,"Wow, what a great stay! Heather and Jorge were perfect hosts (along with Sammy & Ani). We had an early flight in and had no problem droppiny our bags off before the check in time. Jorge was also nice enough to let me borrow a rain jacket and use his Orca card for the duration of our stay! My friend and I got wonderful sleep (the bed was really comfy) and the bathroom had a relaxing shower. Coffee and light breakfast in the morning made it the PERFECT stay! Location wasn't too bad either! Thanks again Heather and Jorge!"
1672979,20123616,2014-09-23,20676480,Nick,Jorge and Heather were really helpful with any issues I had. The bus was a few minute walk away—it was really easy to get to Chinatown and downtown.
1672979,33166909,2015-05-25,33218785,Jordan,"Heather and Jorge were wonderful! The house was very cute, and it was in a great location. Although our stay was fairly short, we had a relaxing stay and enjoyed exploring Seattle. The bed was comfortable and the cats (which they kept out of the guest bedroom) were sweet and playful. Heather and Jorge were even kind enough to leave breakfast, coffee, and tea out in the morning for us. They're very active and have great knowledge of all-things-outdoors in the Seattle area. I highly recommend staying with them, and will definitely try to stay here again on trips back to Seattle."
1672979,34816913,2015-06-12,34332659,Eric,"Très accueillants ! Jorge et Heather m'ont fait sentir comme à la maison.

La maison est très sympathique et la chambre très confortable"
1672979,36563438,2015-06-29,13544992,Christina,"Wow! Jorge and Heather were the best hosts i've stayed with so far and I use airbnb frequently. The kitchen was available and had a good variety of healty foods to pick from like fruits, yogurt, bagels coffee etc. One morning we all sat at the table, chatting as we ate breakfast which was awesome. The room I slept in was neat and there was a clean and dedicated bathroom just for me. They also parked on the street allowing me to use their driveway with meant a dedicated and ever available parking spot. Some people do this just for the money, but Heather and Jorge in addition actually enjoy hosting andbgetting to know people. This will be my first choice stay whenever i'm inbthe area. Heather and Jorge, thanks for a wonderful stay. "
1672979,37359696,2015-07-06,16705899,Ji Hyun (Jennifer),"Heather& Jorge r such nice people. I felt like as if they my old friends. They r always ready for help and trying to understand guest's life style. The room size was enough for 3 of us ( me & 2 kids) and clean just like the same as the photos in Airbnb. The only issue was the hot weather. When I visited, the weather in Seattle was extremely hot, therefore my room which located upstairs were hot as well. Thankfully, they already set up a nice A/C in my room that I can control in my taste, but it still took couple of ours to cool down my room temperature. Sometimes I should turn on the AC whole night, witch was noisy and made my throat dry. But, the hot weather is not their fault. Who can even control the weather? The important thing was Heather & Jorge was always concerned of my hotness and trying to do their best to satisfy my stay!! I was so impressive of there hospitality! I can strongly recommend this house to anyone who wants to visit Seattle.  "
1672979,40341052,2015-07-30,36144260,Mark,My wife and I stayed at Heather and Jorge's home. The home was comfortable and our stay very enjoyable. Both Heather and Jorge were outstanding hosts and made us feel very at home and part of the family. The bedroom was comfy as well as the sleeping arrangements. They even gave us use of the driveway for our rental car. We were even given access totheir wifi. I would recommend their home to any couple or single who happens to be in the Seattle area.
1672979,41125446,2015-08-04,25760098,Eveliendorien,"Heather and Jorge are amazing hosts that make you feel instantly welcome in their home! Very close to a bus that drives you straight downtown (take the 7 to Westlake, final stop)
The room is great, awesome bed and plenty of space. Exactly what we needed! They were extremely helpful and caring and we loved the cats (who were very affectionate, one of them almost hid in our luggage on the way home)
we'd come back if they'd have us! :) 
"
1672979,41449712,2015-08-07,27812401,Katharin,"Heather was a wonderful host.  Our arrival was delayed, but she accommodated us well. Our room was great, bed comfortable. We were out visiting and sight seeing most of the time.  
Neighborhood was a good walk to the park for us - an insignificant jog for Heather!!!
Thanks for your great hospitality."
1672979,43108021,2015-08-17,21639690,Olivia,"My mom and I had a great stay with Heather and Jorge. They have a very clean and quiet home, and coffee and breakfast was ready even though we are early risers. Heather made communication very easy and provided us with great recommendations. Bed was super comfy, and their cats are the cutest!
"
244499,2076630,2012-08-23,736165,Heather,This was a really charming place! My husband and I stayed here in August. Amanda was a pleasure to deal with -- returned messages quickly and checked in to see how things were after we arrived. We found the location just off the highway convenient (we had rented a car) and really enjoyed the beautiful view of the lake in the morning. I would recommend this place to anyone! 
244499,2128242,2012-08-28,3208494,Steven,"Great view, convenient location, stylish decor and very pleasant stay for one or two folks. Amanda was very responsive and helpful. Look forward to a return visit. "
244499,2203551,2012-09-04,3181275,Matt,Amanda was a great host and very accommodating. Her condo has a great view of Lake Union. It's perfect for anyone visiting downtown Seattle.
244499,2965138,2012-11-26,3655486,Courtney,"We hosted our parents at Amanda's condo, and they loved it! Her home was very comfortable with amazing views. It was very easy working with Amanda and I highly recommend her."
244499,3267188,2013-01-04,4313679,Kaili,"We stayed in Amanda's condo over New Years and it was a great choice.  The condo is beautiful and comfortable, the view is unbeatable, and location is convenient for getting anywhere within Seattle.  Amanda was so easy to coordinate with- this was our first time using Airbnb and we couldn't have asked for a better host/condo/experience!"
244499,4852664,2013-05-28,6530067,Kimberly,"We loved the view and Amanda was very easy to work with and friendly. Nice location, loved breakfast down the hill at the Louisa Cafe, and again the view! Thanks Amanda!"
244499,5327070,2013-06-24,725343,Lisa,"Amanda's condo is a great spot to jump into Seattle. We have family who live north of Seattle and the easy on/off I-5 access made this stay even more simple. Amanda made it very easy to access the building and obtain the keys. AND... this condo is great. The view of Lake Union would be hard to beat, Amanda keeps the condo very clean, the bed is amazingly comfortable (very atypical) and the condo is a very comfortable place to hang out. It was also our first time in this area/neighborhood. Pomodoro's has an exceptional menu and wine list and we had a blast playing pinball at The Zoo. There is also a park nearby for sunning, tennis, and just relaxing. Thumbs up!
"
244499,5600483,2013-07-08,5992696,Abi,"Amanda's place was left perfectly clean, and was the ideal spot for my 50something parents to stay while in Seattle. She was communicative, helpful, and the whole process was a breeze. And the view is not a joke- wow!!!"
244499,5775743,2013-07-15,7402289,Leia,"I booked one of my colleagues in Amanda's rental this last weekend.  After her stay, she sent me this note ""The accommodation is AMAZING!!! Thank you!!!  Thank you for finding it!!!""  Amanda was easy to communicate with and gave excellent and easy instructions.  Thank you Amanda for sharing your home with us!  "
244499,5923480,2013-07-22,7351887,Miguel Angel,We had a great stay! The appartment was lovely and everything was very clean and tidy. There was a very warm and welcoming feeling and it was clear that Amanda is an artist. We would certainly recommend this to a friend! Thanks a lot!
244499,6078328,2013-07-29,7138986,Barbara,"What  a lovely place to stay. The view is fabulous making it hard to leave. We just wanted to watch all the action- boats, seaplanes and people. Beautiful day and night. It was easy to catch a bus to Pike's Market. We took Amanda's suggestion and walked to ""Little Water Cantina"" (very good), and ""Pete's"" market (amazing wine selection. Amanda and Adam were gracious hosts and were readily available to answer our questions."
244499,6288842,2013-08-06,343983,Holly,The reservation was canceled 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
244499,6731608,2013-08-23,6853693,Jessica,"This place is awesome!  Amanda was very easy to get a hold of before and during our stay.  The apartment was amazingly decorated (modern but comfortable) and the view was spectacular!  We have been in Seattle for about a month and have stayed at 4 other Airbnb's - this was our favorite!  Not only was the freeway very accessible, but walking to the various Eastlake hot spots was easy and enjoyable.  The bed was comfortable and the shower pressure was great!  We are going to keep this place in mind for future visits."
244499,6983825,2013-09-02,7078355,Stephen,Great place.  Incredible view.  Ideal location.  Exactly as advertised.  Amanda was flexible and accomodating. I'll be back.
244499,7725529,2013-09-30,1918455,Justin,"Amanda and the condo were both fantastic. Amanda was really easy to work with and provided great information.  She left a binder with info about using the place and the surrounding area. 

The condo is gorgeous. The interior is stylish and eclectic, and makes you know that these are some pretty interesting and cool people that live here.The view of the lake is amazing, and the condo itself is really comfortable and modern.   It is also worth mentioning that the water pressure and the big shower head made for a great start to the day!

As mentioned in the description, you park on the street, and the street parking really is very easy.  We were pretty much right in front of the building the whole trip.
"
244499,14659449,2014-06-23,9524197,Kevin,"We greatly enjoyed our time at Amanda's place. She was very flexible with our checkin and checkout, which really helped. She also left a lot of helpful notes to orient us regarding both the apartment and the neighborhood. And...the VIEW...amazing! We loved just sitting and watching the boats and other activity, morning and evening. We also slept well, as the place was nice and quiet. "
244499,14892908,2014-06-28,1166413,Kurtis,Amanda was a fantastic host. All interaction with her was quick and delightful. I will stay here again!
244499,15310916,2014-07-07,273827,Beth,"Amanda was great! Easy to work with before, very communicative, and her place was PERFECT for the July 4th view of Lake Union. Even if fireworks aren't in the cards, the view is incredible and the pictures barely do it justice. :)

The bed is so comfortable, their kitchen is easy to use, and the location is a great part of town. Be prepared to hike up a hill, but if you want that view, work it out!"
244499,16502759,2014-07-28,2467983,Neil,"Fantastic apartment, surely the most stunning view in Seattle! and a great, comfortable place to be. Amanda great to communicate with before and at our arrival and I'd recommend the apartment to anyone. the neighbourhood is fantastic too, easy walk down to some great places to eat etc. top choice in seattle, thanks - Neil "
244499,17754955,2014-08-17,174048,Burt,Amanda was very responsive from my first inquiry and super helpful. Check in was very easy and the view of Lake Union is even better than the photos even on a couple of overcast days. Parking access is good and very quiet. Would recommend to all.
244499,18730708,2014-08-31,8832846,Lisa,"My husband and I traveled to Seattle (from San Diego) for a wedding, but I wanted to do some sightseeing since I had never been before.  Amanda's apartment was perfect!  The view of Lake Union was amazing. The apartment was clean and bright in a picturesque and friendly neighborhood. The location was central to everywhere we wanted to go in Seattle.  Parking was easy. Amanda was a great host -- we got in too late to meet in person, but everything was set up perfectly for us. We also really appreciated Amanda's tips on great restaurants nearby and her suggestion of where to rent kayaks  -- that was awesome, don't miss it!!!"
244499,20033585,2014-09-22,3291139,Donna,"The views are spectacular.   The apartment is great, very comfortable.   We travel a few times to Seattle so I will definitely stay at this place again.  Very convenient to the University.  "
244499,21166793,2014-10-12,8259042,Alexis,Amanda was a great host and very responsive. She has an amazing condo with an incredible view. The place is perfect for two. 
244499,21882787,2014-10-26,7657699,Anne,"Amanda is a good hostess and very quick with communication responses.  The condominium had a most amazing view, 180 degrees of Lake Union from the Seattle Center to Gasworks Park. The location is central for activities in Seattle, many different transportation options available if you don't have a car.  We spent our days away from the place and late evenings were spent soaking in the spectacular view.  If you are considering Seattle, you should definitely stay here.

The place is comfortable, clean and very well organized. There is plenty of room for you to put your stuff.  We did not use the computer, having brought our own tech stuff.  We ate out every meal, although the kitchen appeared to be well stocked."
244499,24677811,2015-01-01,52803,Ursula,"Amanda's place was absolutely fantastic. The view was stunning, and the condo itself was just as lovely as you'd expect from the pictures. The location itself was also very convenient, and finding parking was consistently easy. Amanda made check-in and check-out a breeze. I would highly recommend staying here to anyone!"
244499,29792305,2015-04-12,25244365,Thomas,"My girlfriend and I had a wonderfully relaxing weekend at Amanda's lovely home. The view is not exaggerated in the photos - it's actually that good! Not only does the apartment have a fantastic view, but a great location - less than 15 minutes from downtown, the U district, and Fremont district. Amanda was a great host and made our first Airbnb experience an easy and pleasant one. Definitely recommended. "
244499,33180846,2015-05-25,463256,Elizabeth,"Thank you so much! We had a fantastic stay in Amanda's  apartment- the view is amazing! The apartment is very nice, clean, comfortable, and centrally located.  Highly recommended."
244499,34353402,2015-06-07,33855908,Maureen,"This was our first Air B&B experience and it was wonderful! We stayed for the weekend. Amanda and Adam have a wonderful home, and were easy to contact. Parking on the curb was painless and we didn't have to park far. The lack of air conditioning was a bit uncomfortable--the days we were there the weather was beautiful, hot, and humid. But the fan in the bedroom and the instructions provided on how to keep the condo cool were helpful. The view is gorgeous and with only a quick 7 minute drive to downtown, such an excellent location. 

Not sure about walk-ability of the neighborhood as we had a car and didn't get a chance to walk around. 

All in all, we would stay there again...maybe at a cooler time of year, though. "
244499,35691189,2015-06-21,22419478,John,Great weekend staying in Eastlake neighborhood in cozy apartment with beautiful Lake Union view.  Love the neighborhood and amenities nearby.  Walked/ran/cycled everywhere.  Never used the car all weekend.  Great restaurants and coffee shops very close and even more offerings if you are willing to walk a couple of miles.  (South Lake Union and Queen Anne neighborhoods) Fun for these two native Seattle suburb kids to explore this area. Hassle free in and out!
244499,37205784,2015-07-05,954170,Vip,"Amanda's place was incredible! Cozy, had all the amenities we needed, and the view is even better than the pictures. Great location as well - there's a lot of good food within walking distance, and it's a pretty central location to explore Seattle from. 
Amanda did warn us that Seattle had been experience an unusual bout of hot weather, but she left a fan and instruction on how to cool the place down. 
The whole process was seamless. Thanks Amanda! "
244499,37856406,2015-07-11,4042131,Polina,Great views and very comfortable place. 
244499,38152151,2015-07-13,19071108,Larry,Wow! And wow again. We felt so very much at home at Amanda's.  What a spectacular experience!  Gorgeous view and very wonderful living space.  We felt honored to be invited to be guests there. 
244499,39789274,2015-07-26,36179570,Hanah,My parents had a fabulous time at Amanda's condo. The view is fantastic and we love her projector to watch movies!  Thank you for hosting!
244499,42149416,2015-08-11,36998866,Carrie,This was such a perfect spot.  We loved looking at Lake Union and all the activity going on.  I found this view much more interesting than looking at Lake Washington.  The condo is so perfectly located in walking distance to fun restaurants and bus access to downtown.  I was worried about freeway noise but the condo is amazingly quiet with the white noise of the location canceling out any freeway issues.  The condo is also very nicely decorated and has a zen like calming setting.
6821407,35056139,2015-06-14,20258009,Nayoung Jamie,"Beautiful spankin new home in a hip, safe part of town. I don't think the pictures do it (website hidden) was a very accommodating host and great to communicate with for last minute needs. Definitely hope to stay here again next time I come to Seattle!"
6821407,35518713,2015-06-19,35697127,Sushee,"Steve's place was perfect for me.  I was in Ballard for work and it was walking distance for me.  I was able to enjoy lots of great restaurants, and desserts...top of my list were the Molten Cake place, Red Mill Burgers, Morsel and Bean as well as the Locks where there were huge birds dive fishing for salmon swimming up stream.

Steve is easy going and easy to communicate with.  His place is close to lots of indie shops and public transportation.  I had the bottom floor for myself and a private restroom.  The house was clean.  I would definitely stay here when back in town."
6821407,35615074,2015-06-20,35865739,Jason,"Steve was a great host that helped me figure out how to navigate Airbnb for my first stay, and based on this experience, I would definitely love to stay at his place again! Steve's house is brand new and situated in a great location that allowed us to walk to everything in Ballard, and it was a quick drive to downtown Seattle.  My fiance loved the neighborhood so much, we were thinking about possibly moving there!  Steve was friendly and accommodating, and he effortlessly balanced being a good host while helping us with any questions, as well as giving us great recommendations of places to visit.  "
6821407,36719972,2015-06-30,19860658,Alec,"Steve's home is a brand new and modern construction, so the room and bathroom fittings are contemporary and very nice. The location in Ballard, north of Market and just off 24th, is residential and quiet, with ample street parking right near the house. The bus stop to Downtown and the main road in Ballard is a couple minutes walk, so overall it's very conveniently located. At the time I stayed, Steve hadn't yet had wifi installed, and FYI, the 2 coffee shops that are closest by also both don't have wifi, which is strange for Seattle. The bed is comfortable and Steve kindly also left some bottles of water on my arrival. Water pressure in the shower is good and it's also nice to have the option of taking a bath. Steve has a few rules for keeping his house clean and safe (no shoes inside, lock the dual locks, don't open the window too wide, etc), so I'd recommend talking through those so you have the same expectations."
6821407,38036479,2015-07-12,9377708,Joe,"Steve is a great guy & his place is in a great location! Only a short stroll from all the good restaurants, bars & shops in Ballard. We had a whole floor to ourselves...the place is brand new & very clean! Perfect"
6821407,38212255,2015-07-13,23585379,Nikki,It was fine. Clean and simple. sung Joon was accommodating and helpful. 
6821407,38363530,2015-07-14,5938223,Han,"Host:
He helped me to figure out how to get to his place and welcomed me wholeheartedly. He is really easy to communicate and easy going. 

House:
The house looked like brand new with modern construction, I asked to host when this house has been built. He said it was built in June 2015. So, it is clean and nice hose to stay. It is same as on the description, but much better than photo you see on this post. I think Steve should do another photo works to show this place in more attractive way. :)
I could use whole first floor with private bathroom, so level of private was pretty good. 

Town:
This house is located in downtown Ballard. That's one of the main reason why I choose this place. It's only 15 minutes walk distance to there, and there were many soulful cafe, restaurant, theater, bar and shops. I could definitely enjoy the town."
6821407,38629756,2015-07-17,18350392,Roman,"Steve is accommodating and polite host. The room is in the very nice, clean brand new building and comes with private bathroom. It is in the Ballard neighborhood, which is quite, safe and cozy location with ample nice coffee shops and restaurants. We would definitely stay at this place in the future."
6821407,38893168,2015-07-19,11661637,Sam,"Sung made us feel  very welcome. The apartment is ideally situated in Ballard, as advertised. The actual room is a little bit small, but it's ideal for a person or two staying for a short stay. The building itself is very modern and clean. "
6821407,40523484,2015-07-31,11347446,Lucy,"I had a wonderful stay at Steve’s place. Steve is a very nice guy and a wonderful host. His house is clean, quiet and is conveniently located in Ballard. The rooms that are available to me are exactly as described/pictured. In addition, he left lovely welcome gifts (bottles of water and a couple of bags of Kukuruza popcorn) on the bed :). I had the bottom floor to myself with private bathroom, and during my stay I hardly heard any foot/floor noises from the floors above. If you are a light sleeper, this is the place for you! I highly recommend Steve’s place and will definitely book here again."
6821407,40960530,2015-08-03,37800233,Leigh,"Steve was such a great host. Our flight arrived late and he stayed up and got us settled right in despite the hour! The room was extremely clean and we felt very comfortable staying with him. The shared space was lovely and Steve gave us some great suggestions for visiting Seattle. I actually loved being in the Ballard neighborhood and found it to be a lot of fun and easy to get in and out of Downtown, I would stay there again in a minute. This was our first experience with Air BnB and I'm now a huge fan."
6821407,41141365,2015-08-04,37864131,Josh,"Steve was a very gracious, accommodating host. From booking to arriving, he stayed in touch, providing sightseeing and restaurant suggestions. When we arrived to his clean, well-appointed space, he had left us a half-sheet with house rules, two waters, and his favorite local artisanal popcorn. The common space separated the guest suite from his, so we felt we had enough privacy. The quiet neighborhood was only a 10-minute Über or 30-minute bus ride from downtown--though there are plenty of things to do in Ballard.  Our only regret is that we only had one night to spend here!"
6821407,41653174,2015-08-08,31712165,Egin,He was very accommodating and very available. The room and bathroom was very clean and easy to access. Great experience. Steve had a couple of water bottles and sone local speciality popcorn redy for us when we arrived.

Thanks Sung!

Mike"
6821407,42325328,2015-08-12,2312875,Martyn,"Room was clean if a little minimal. Bed was very small for a couple, but overall a pleasant experience. "
6821407,43537169,2015-08-20,2347534,Sim,"Steve is very welcoming, polite and friendly host. He organized and prepared everything I needed for the room. He knew that I was on a working trip and he got me a small desk for the room. I really appreciated it. The apartment is conveniently located in Ballard. I can walk to the happening spots in less than 15 mins. To get to downtown, there is a bus stop, just a block away. It takes less than 30 mins to get to downtown. As for the apartment, its a brand new building (modern style). The room and the bathroom are very clean. I have enough privacy on the first floor and the private bathroom is definitely a huge plus! The wifi connection is strong and you can find nice graphic arts hanging around his place. The neighborhood is very quite so it's work out great for a light sleeper like me.  I had a wonderful stay and will definitely book here again :) Thanks Steve for being a great host!"
6821407,44327610,2015-08-25,7550980,Gail,"Steve was very responsive - his house was super clean and the stay was great. Nice neighborhood - close to everything - parking easy and accessible.

He is such a friendly and helpful host.
The room and private bath were really great and 100 percent clean.
The second floor with kitchen and living room were spacious and we had a lot of fun cooking there. 
We enjoyed the time and definitely recommended it."
6821407,44808354,2015-08-29,23577171,Simon,"Sung Yoon made us feel welcome, and everything was nice and clean. Bed was small for two people but other than that it was great. Common area was very nice but we never used it. Bathroom was spotless too which is a big plus in my book"
6821407,44959817,2015-08-30,19801330,Abhishekharee,"Awesome host, nice clean and tidy apartment. Would definitely want to stay here next time. "
6821407,45333277,2015-09-01,23162483,Andrei,"Steve was a wonderfull host. From the moment I arrived he guided me to a private parking lot, I was excited about that. The living room looks way better in real life than in pictures, it`s simple, elegant and usefull. The room where I was hosted was on the first floor, so I had privacy, plus the bathroom was next door, so handy. 
 The neighborhood was quiet, close to downtown, the perfect place for what I needed. 
 I would defenetaly book a room at Steve`s if I`m going to be in Seattle !

Not only was Steve very welcoming and readily available to answer questions, but his clean and tidy apartment was the perfect accommodation for two folks needing a place to spend the night on a budget.

Pros: Very friendly host, clean room, zero hassle, Ballard, excellent price for what is offered.
Cons: the 2 person bed is only suitable for slender folks (this wasn't an issue for us)
Overall: 5/5"

6821407,47111479,2015-09-15,18000295,Lena,"Our room in Sung Joon's apartment was nice but pretty small (would recommend it for one or two nights, though). It is situated in a very nice area where bars, cafés and restaurants are in walking-distance. Sung Joon was very friendly and made great suggestions of which cafés we should check out. Thanks for that!"
6821407,47407691,2015-09-18,3746452,Blane,"Steve was a most excellent host during our stay with him.  We felt at home and comfortable in his lovely, clean, well decorated home.

6821407,48357983,2015-09-25,10885747,Virginie,"We stayed two nights at Steve's house, what I can tell is that his place is really convenient, clean and you have the first floor just for you so you can have your intimacy. I highly recommend this bnb and this host (too bad we didn t see him much as he was busy working)."
6821407,49382122,2015-10-03,35439355,Khanh,Host was very helpful through out my entire stay. Quick to respond to my questions and texts. I couldn't find the place but he came out to find me and direct me to the place. Good location. Convenient parking. House is clean.

6821407,53165680,2015-11-05,48114648,Shun,"The listing description was pretty accurate and the neighborhood around it is pretty nice and has many families around so safety concerns seem to not be an issue. Parking on the street is much easier than on the private premise offered by the host as the space and driveway is pretty narrow for normally-skilled drivers. 

The house itself is newly constructed so everything inside seemed brand new. The host also cleans pretty well and offers very clear instructions about the stay and all other aspects of the Seattle experience. 

If you are a couple, or a single person, and has a car, I would definitely recommend to stay here, particularly for its affordability, location, simple amenities, and host helpfulness. 

However, if you don't have a car, it seems like the public transportation will take about 45 min to get to downtown. "
6821407,55284831,2015-11-29,44297400,Paul,"Steve was super welcoming and friendly! My week staying there was very enjoyable and he was really helpful with suggestions about Seattle and its different neighborhoods. He met me right when I arrived and was always very responsive by text. I needed to extend my stay for a couple days and was able to do this no problem. His house is super clean and comfortable, the room was warm and the bed cozy. Use of the large kitchen was appreciated and I was able to store some items in the refrigerator. Even though we didn't see too much of each other because we were both quite busy, it was always a pleasure to chat for a few minutes. His place is just a 15 minute walk to many great restaurants and coffee shops, yet is in a very peaceful and quiet area. All in all this was a really great stay, and I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for a clean and chill place in the Ballard neighborhood!"
8053049,47328787,2015-09-17,18681581,Stephanie,"Kym was very welcoming and her home is beautiful. It was comfortable and relaxing, which is just what we needed after a cross country trip!  She greeted us when we arrived, gave us a tour, and made sure that we had everything we needed to make our stay amazing. The house is quiet, clean, spacious, and has tons of character. The pictures are good, but they don't do it justice! The neighborhood has lots of restaurants to explore, as well as close to Green Lake for running and the zoo. It is easily accessible to downtown Seattle while also having a safe neighborhood feel. Kym and her home are what AirBnB should strive to set their standards to. We would definitely stay again and highly recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle.  "
8053049,49820734,2015-10-06,43812399,Christina,"Beautiful home! Pictures didn't do it justice. The location was great, loved walking to the park and the zoo! Also, a Starbucks in walking distance down the street and cute little shops everywhere. Everything was clean and well kept. Spent a lot time with a cup of coffee in front of the fire place! Was a very welcoming home and had so much fun during our stay. I would defiantly stay here again! "
8053049,50973933,2015-10-16,5326306,Benjamin,"Kym was an excellent host, and the accommodations are as advertised. A lovely well kept (and clean) craftsmen. Kym went above and beyond to accommodate our ever-changing schedule. "
8053049,54249783,2015-11-17,46030664,Meg,"We were really impressed with this home. the house is clean, comfortable, very spacious, and in a great neighborhood (Grocery store, restaurants, coffee shops, bars, parks and even the zoo are all nearby).  we had a group of 5, and this house served as the perfect 'home base' for an extended weekend. Kym was also responsive to questions I had during the booking process, and checked in after we arrived to ensure things were ok (which they were!).
I would definitely stay here again, and recommend it to others."
3498114,15607160,2014-07-12,2424049,Judd,"Leas' little gem was the perfect spot to host my father when he came to town.  It is a simple and small apartment but it has everything you need if you are looking for a place to stay on Capitol Hill.  It was clean, the bed comfortable.  The only thing my father mentioned was, ""if there's not a tv in the place, there should at least be a radio.""  Most people have cell phones these days that play music, but it was an issue for him. Otherwise, no complaints.  Location was great and Lea left us her parking permit for the neighborhood so parking was not a problem either.  I would definitely use her place again."
3498114,15658170,2014-07-13,13500386,Parth,Lea was wonderful and we really enjoyed our stay. The apartment was very clean and the location was good - We walked to many sites and restaurants.  I would recommend this pad!
3498114,16221586,2014-07-23,11300417,Patrick,"We stayed at Lea's for five days in July and would do it again in a heartbeat. Lea was well organized and easy to work with. Her apartment was clean and well prepared for us with all the amenities (good wifi, laundry in the basement, and in a great location.) The surrounding neighborhood had tons of great restaurants and cafes and seemed close to everything (we walked everywhere). If we ever find ourselves back in Seattle, we'll be trying to book here!"
3498114,16428100,2014-07-27,16858989,Abby,Lea's place was exactly as described. She was super easy to communicate with and even came to the rescue when we got locked out! 
3498114,16570566,2014-07-29,12303711,Erica,"Exactly as shown, great neighborhood (go to Victory around the corner for sushi and whiskey!). Super understand of traffic delays when we were coming in to town for check in and had lots of helpful info ready for us when we arrived. Thanks Lea!"
3498114,16624712,2014-07-30,17600441,Ryan,"The place was clean and comfortable and struck a good balance of being slightly away from the typical tourist check points, but still very convenient to everything. It's great if you want to stay in a quiet local neighborhood."
3498114,16733555,2014-08-01,4349653,Jon,"Lea was a wonderful host, even able to accommodate my late train arrival into the city. The place was great and very convenient to places around Capitol Hill. The bed, sheets, and sofa were also really comfortable and allowed my friend and I to feel at home, even for a short night."
3498114,16997248,2014-08-05,14798390,Ernirose,Lea's place was clean and took care of all our basic needs. Our flight was delayed several ours and Lea was very accommodating in getting us the key. It's in manageable walking distance from the bars on Capitol Hill and there's also a great coffee shop and Walgreens right around the corner. Would come back and stay again!
3498114,17161371,2014-08-08,17715112,Robert,Apartment was comfy for the 2 of us traveling (a pretty sizeable studio).  Located in a cool part of town- restaurants and bars a couple of blocks away (north of the Capitol Hill area). Lea was very friendly and easy to communicate with. All in all a good experience.
3498114,17362856,2014-08-11,13485282,Sev,"We had a great time at this Capitol Hill Little Gem! The studio is cute, well-organized and cosy. We really enjoyed the neighborhood, which is lively (with its little cafés, restaurants...) yet quiet and safe. There is a supermarket, a pharmacy, and a bus stop to go downtown right around the corner, which is very convenient. Lea is very nice and easy to get in touch with. I definitely recommend her place for an authentic Seattle experience!"
3498114,17843629,2014-08-18,17413451,Tiffany,"The studio looks exactly like the pictures shown on the listing! Loved the quiet neighborhood and felt safe. Very accomodating when my boyfriend and I were stuck in downtown traffic for more than an hour and a half. Parking can be tough but not as bad as downtown. Can easily walk to a lot of restaurants, bars, etc. We would definitely stay here again! :)"
3498114,18182772,2014-08-23,7782534,Eli,The place was great. It was in a great location and exactly as advertised.  Lea was responsive and left good instructions. Would highlight recommend for anyone staying in Seattle.
3498114,18326367,2014-08-25,5871061,Emily,"Room was clean, but nothing special. Host did leave a small booklet of rules and information about the area, which was nice. If you are simply looking for a place to crash, this place works just fine. Lea was not around to let us in, but her friend was able to meet us easily and made checking in no problem. The Capital Hill area is a very happenin' place, so it was great to be able to just walk from this apartment. "
3498114,18986392,2014-09-04,17571387,Helen,"Great location! Comfortable spot and just the right amount of privacy. 

Capitol Hill is the place to stay and Lea's home is perfect. "
3498114,19367050,2014-09-11,18764848,Sarah,"Great location! Close to many restaurants, bars and coffee shops. Short walk to Volunteer Park. Lea was very responsive and easy to communicate with. For the location and price I would recommend this staying here. "
3498114,19952547,2014-09-21,17948635,Christina,This studio is really well located for bars and good restaurants. Parking is a little tricky but available a couple of streets away. Lea was  easy to communicate with and very helpful. We had a great stay! 
3498114,21345434,2014-10-15,2250055,Eliza,"I had arranged with the host that I would meet her at the apartment at a specific time but that I would also call her ahead. I called; no answer. I called twice more; no answer. I waited for quite a while at the building but did not hear from her. So I left. I had to stay with a friend far from the apartment, outside of Seattle. How lucky that I had somewhere to go. But since my trip was to see my daughter, and I did not get to see her that evening as a result of this mix-up, I was very disappointed. I did eventually hear from the host, who said she had not heard my phone calls. She offered to check me in then, but it was very late and I was by then far away. I did check in the next day, although was met by the host's boyfriend, not her. He said that she had been asleep the night before. Not a good excuse, in my opinion. The apartment was fine; it was very conveniently located near 15th Avenue. The Wifi was not working, which was quite inconvenient, but to be fair, I did not contact the host to let her know that, so she did not have the opportunity to fix it. I did feel that the apartment was a little overpriced for what it was. "
3498114,21855213,2014-10-25,22587674,Andi,Lea's place was great! The location in Capitol Hill is amazing. Bars and restaurants are about a block away. And it is an easy walk to Pine and Pike. Lea was helpful and we appreciated her list of recommendations. 
3498114,21970175,2014-10-27,14769723,Rachael,"Lea was super nice and the listing was totally accurate. A little hard to park in the area, next time we will do some more research to use public transportation. Close walking distance to a ton of stuff and centrally located to drive to lots of places."
3498114,22329875,2014-11-03,8020695,Nick,"Lea was a great host! Real efficient and hands off but we knew she'd be very helpful if we had any issues. The place was exactly as described, clean and perfectly located in a nice neighborhood."
3498114,22616936,2014-11-10,23088122,Tess,"Lea was very nice and accommodating of our earlier checkin! She was easily reached via phone. Lea left us a helpful packet of information on the city and the specific neighborhood we were in. The apartment was small and in an old building, but clean and functional. Only thing myself and my friend missed was having a TV! Overall, I had a great stay and loved the neighborhood and the ease of access to the heart of downtown. Would stay here again!"
3498114,23177979,2014-11-24,2374341,Eric,Lea's place was clean and as described.  She was communicative and check-in and check-out were super easy.  The location was great.  The kitchen was nice and the heat worked well.  We enjoyed our time there
3498114,23731110,2014-12-08,12741557,Tyler,Lea's apartment is great and exactly as advertised. It was easy to set up time to get the kes and she was responsive when I needed to reach her. The neighborhood is great and I would highly recommend staying here!
3498114,23952670,2014-12-15,7467111,Wayne,The apartment is great way to experience Seattle how it should be. Very close to the section of bars and restaurants on 15th as well as only 5 blocks from the same on Broadway. A little but of a hike the the Pike/Pine area but totally walkable or a $5 Uber ride if its raining. I would definitely stay here again.
3498114,25023744,2015-01-05,5881766,Regina,"Lea was so kind and accommodating! My flight got in late and she waited until I got there to show me everything. The apartment was incredibly cozy and we never had a cold night. Stayed for about 2 weeks and she checked up on us to make sure we were ok. 
The neighborhood is awesome! Steps away from groceries, coffee shops, restaurants, etc. 
Overall a really great stay :) "
3498114,25820321,2015-01-26,20809836,Clay,"Lea was very accommodating, even of our very late arrival.  The apt was warm and cozy with just enough space  The building is in the best part of Capitol Hill; close to amenities but quiet and safe.  We would love to stay here again!  Thanks Lea!"
3498114,25918878,2015-01-29,26367904,Bette,"Lea was great – prompt communications, good tips about the apartment, accessible for questions. I appreciated the write-up she provides with practical notes and local suggestions.
The apartment had some charm (awesome decorative lights!), it was clean and cozy and the location was amazing for nearby coffee/restaurants/supermarket and beautiful walks to Volunteer Park.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it’s in an older building with low-pressure hot water and few electrical outlets. Kitchen is minimally equipped so I decided not to actually prepare food there. Overall, a good place for my needs. "
3498114,26616922,2015-02-16,23815723,Alyssa,"Lea's place was adorable-- and just like the listing promises, it felt like a hidden gem! The bed was comfortable, the neighborhood convenient and cute... and close to all the best parts of Seattle. The apartment was spotless! Which was much appreciated :) 

Thanks for a great place to stay in a new city Lea! "
3498114,27561287,2015-03-07,27827450,Malorie,"Great location but the building is far from a gem. Room was more or less as advertised and nothing more. Building was old and dank and smelly. W/D was nice to have even if in the basement and coin operated. Pretty much par for the course for Capitol Hill it seems. Lea was a great, accommodating host and willing to meet us early for check-in which was much appreciated. "
3498114,28103276,2015-03-17,20402024,Nick,Convenient location and easy accessibility.  Only issue was poor hot water pressure but that wasn't a big deal...
3498114,28276376,2015-03-21,28997956,Regine,"very accommodating with our check in/out times, and very cozy apartment! "
3498114,30902751,2015-04-28,31309571,Emily,"This was my first time booking an AirBnB and it was really a great experience. Lea was incredibly accommodating with checking in and out and provided a way for me to pick up keys after hours since I had a late flight. The apartment itself was very clean and contained all of the necessities. The bed was super comfy. And she even puts together an info booklet about the apartment and the neighborhood. The location is great! ~6 min walk to Broadway, which has tons of restaurant options. I was staying here while looking for an apartment in Capitol Hill (relocating from the East Coast) and it was a short walk to pretty much everywhere I needed to tour. "
3498114,31602749,2015-05-07,3666053,Federico,"Lea's place is in a very good area, close to all the fun in Capitol Hill. Plus she was really nice and gave us great tips!"
3498114,32699332,2015-05-20,31476697,Michael,"Lea was an awesome host who left great directions for us during our stay and was accommodating to our atypical arrival time.  Every time I messaged her she was prompt in responding which was really appreciated.  

The unit itself wasn't fancy, but if you are looking for a clean place to stay in the Capital Hill area it definitely serves that purpose.  As described it is a studio apartment  so there isn't a great amount of space, but the kitchen it pretty well stocked if you want to cook any quick meals or reheat leftovers.  The bathroom, specifically the shower, is the weakest point of the unit; prepare to spend some time working to get decent hot water!  

It was my first visit to Seattle and the welcome book Lea provides was a good start for things to see around the city.  Close to the apartment, Wandering Goose has some good breakfast biscuits, Coastal Kitchens has good happy hour deals, and POCO Wine+Spirits was a great place for some regional wines if that's your cup of tea... or wine as the case may be.  There is a Safeway pretty close on 15th if you want to pick up any groceries.  If you're looking for more food/bar options and not against a walk (or a quick Uber) head down to Pike and Pine.  

All in all it was a great visit and we really enjoyed Seattle.  If you need a good place to stay with a good host Lea will get you set up!  "
3498114,33265203,2015-05-26,31177341,Boyd,"The location was absolutely perfect!! Having a grocery store and Walgreens within a block or two came in very handy.  All within a short walk are more bars and restaurants than we could possibly sample in the 4 days we stayed.  We were worried about parking in the area, but it turned out fairly easy to find a spot within a few blocks each day.  The bed was very comfortable as well.  Lea made check-in and check-out a snap and her suggestions were spot-on.  We wish we could have stayed longer and would definitely rent here again!"
3498114,33918741,2015-06-02,26866393,Max,"Lea's apartment was pretty straightforward and as listed. We had a great time while we were in Seattle staying at her place. It's super convenient to great places in Capitol Hill on 15th and a short walk to Pike/Pine - and not too bad of a walk to downtown if you're up for it. If not the bus stop is literally a block away. Lea also provides an extensive guide on things to do in town which was super helpful! We never really interacted with Lea or her boyfriend, but check-in/out was super simple and she offered help if we needed it.

If you're looking for a great place to crash while staying in town, I recommend Lea's place 100% There are probably ""nicer"" places out there but this definitely does the job well!

Pros: Quiet, cozy, comfy bed, safe neighborhood and building
Cons: Shower water pressure"
3498114,34647734,2015-06-10,32874493,Pam,"The apartment is in a very lovely neighborhood on Capitol Hill, and was just as described. It was quite comfortable, and a nice to have little kitchen.   The host was very helpful and responsive to my questions.    


"
3498114,35403309,2015-06-18,6211635,David,"Lea was very gracious about our difficult travel schedule.   Her apartment is small but comfortable and quiet, and it is in a great location.   We would definitely stay here again."
3498114,35944358,2015-06-23,31043233,Madison,Perfect place to stay. Close walking distance to everything you could ever want. Leas recommendations were great as well. Would recommend to anyone!
3498114,37464710,2015-07-07,18603292,Adam,"Lea was helpful and check in/out was easy.  The apartment is your basic studio but in a great location.  Great bus connections to downtown(and from there anywhere).  If you don't want to take the bus, there is everything a few blocks away on 15th or Broadway.

Hot water and its pressure could be improved."
3498114,38123425,2015-07-13,1213493,Nelson,Pretty solid. Just what it says. Fair price. No problems.
3498114,39160096,2015-07-21,32445341,Regina,"I had an excellent stay here! I chose this location because I was in town for a wedding and this put me easy walking distance from my friend and a couple other people involved. The location on Capital Hill is great, and there's lots of food places around - I highly recommend the Bakery Nouveau.  

This is a nice studio, in an older building with a great location. The bed was comfy and the shower was totally fine. It was pretty quiet while I was there, and Leah made checking in and out easy and seamless (and left a thorough guidebook to the area). 

I'm No a/c, but I'm used to heat so I was okay. The place does get some breeze, but you should definitely open the blinds and turn on the fan to get the cooler bought air. 

All in all, I would definitely book here again, and recommend it to others! "
3498114,40719089,2015-08-02,4223590,Stephanie,"Studio was exactly as described. It's in a fantastic location in Capitol Hill. As other reviewers have stated, if you're looking for luxury, this isn't it. But it has everything you need plus a little more (like toiletries and Netflix) and is great if you just need a home base to explore the city or visit friends and family. "
3498114,41611521,2015-08-08,10943308,Isabel,The flat was in a really good location. We didn't realise how close things were at first. Everything went super easy and Lea responded really quickly to anything we needed. Would definitely stay here again. 
3498114,42525339,2015-08-14,33753682,Hali,"Lea was great! Check in was a breeze. The studio was charming, very spacious, and in a fantastic location. It was a short walk to all the bars and restaurants and a nice walk or quick cab ride downtown. The Brita pitcher and twinkle lights were a nice bonus. "
