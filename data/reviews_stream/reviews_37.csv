202260,19116627,2014-09-07,1417464,Cathy,"Our stay at Kerry's apartment was delightful. It had everything we needed for our weekend. It was also well equipped for a longer stay with a lovely kitchenette. The bedroom was very comfortable and even had a gas fireplace.  It was an unusual 80 plus degrees for our stay so we didn't use it but on a typical Seattle day...cozy comes to mind. The quiet residential neighborhood was nice. The location close to the U and Lake washington parks was terrific.
Kerry,herself,was a great host. Greeting us,showing us how everything worked and making sure we were comfortable.
As fellow Airbnb hosts we enjoyed ""talking story"" with her. Any guest will feel right at home with her hospitality."
202260,19462308,2014-09-13,2785093,Stacy,"Kerry was great, welcoming us to her place and giving us an introduction tour.  The basement apartment is quiet and was a great way to finish a long trip.  The king bed was comfy and the down pillows a treat.  Thanks Kerry!"
202260,19937203,2014-09-21,19354019,Andrea,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Kerry's apartment. It was a perfect home base for my stay in Seattle. The apartment is very quiet, cozy & stocked with everything needed for a comfortable stay. Kerry was very nice & helpful. I enjoyed meeting her & her cute dog, Daisy. I felt like I was staying with a friend & highly recommend Kerry's apartment to anyone planning a trip to Seattle. "
202260,20247059,2014-09-26,9246313,Christine,"It's a great place to stay (super clean) and Kerry is a lovely host. She was very helpful (looking for the next gluten free grocery, ask her! What to do in Seattle (arts, museum etc. ask her) and sweet. The bedroom has a fireplace which we absolutely adore. There are lots of books which make the place super cozy. The bed was so comfy ( I have always trouble to sleep in another bed but this one - heaven!!!). "
202260,20494270,2014-09-30,554935,Liz,"I set up this visit as a place for my in-laws to stay while visiting us, so I didn't actually stay here myself. Kerry was fine with that slightly odd arrangement. She was also quite understanding when we got stuck in traffic. The place was welcoming and spacious. There was a binder full of information available. My in-laws loved walking up the street to PCC for a hot brunch buffet on Sunday morning and picking up food for other snacks. "
202260,21901074,2014-10-26,1337315,Jim,"We had a lovely time.  Kerry is a great hostess, very experienced. I feel like she thought of everything. The basement apartment is clean, spacious, and comfortable.  We loved the gas fireplace in the bedroom - it's on a thermostat so we didn't get too hot or cold.  The place was quiet and our bed was comfy and warm - we slept great."
202260,22645164,2014-11-11,6842497,Alisa,"Kerry was a very welcoming and accommodating host; the informational notebook was fantastic. The apartment was spacious and is in a very quiet, walkable neighborhood where we always felt safe. We arrived very late at night and found that automatic lights illuminated our way to the apartment. The entire apartment was spotless. The bed was very comfortable. We especially enjoyed the fireplace in the bedroom. We made use of the full, well-stocked kitchen. Great shower. We regularly visit relatives in Seattle and would love to stay with Kerry again if the apartment is available. After about a day we were referring to it as ""home."""
202260,22786759,2014-11-14,10170644,Michael,Wow! What a great place.  Very clean. Nicely decorated. Fireplace.  Couldn't ask for more.  This is a bargain.  
202260,23180818,2014-11-24,23624634,Sophia,"Kerry's place was absolutely amazing to stay at. With this being my first time using airbnb, Kerry went above and beyond to make my boyfriend and I feel comfortable. She even let us stay a little longer after checkout, with no complaints. We would definitely love to stay here again! Thank You for hosting us!"
202260,24147016,2014-12-21,23310599,Eric,Kerry was an extremely warm and flexible host. She accommodated for a late arrival on the first night and the apartment was in perfect condition with all the necessary amenities and more. 
202260,24810300,2015-01-03,16879517,Paul,"Stop for a second before moving onto looking at another place to stay. I wholeheartedly hope that you consider staying at this wonderful apartment!

The apartment was exactly as described as in the listing. The neighborhood itself was a calm and soothingly quiet. Motion-detecting lights are placed outside to light the pathway to the apartment during the dark of night. 

I've given myself some time to think about my recent visit and would have to say that this place was absolutely phenomenal. Kerry was very welcoming, making sure to go over every single detail possible. Might I add that Kerry has impeccable attention to detail? It allowed my stay to be worry free and very comfortable. Everything was mapped out in a handy guide, with Kerry walking us through the entire place the moment we arrived. This became a ""home away from home."""
202260,29232465,2015-04-05,6403775,Aurelie,"We had a great 2-night stay at Kerry's! Kerry welcomed us and gave us lots of good tips about thinks to do, where to go for dinner etc. The place itself is very spacious and has everything you'd need for an extended stay. The bed was very comfy. We had a car and found the location very convenient. I wouldn't hesitate going back! "
202260,30663526,2015-04-26,26073285,Melvin,"We have just returned home after three weeks in Seattle at the Cozy seattle apt .  Everything was as desribed and more. This was a perfect location which provided everything we needed to have a great stay.  The neiborhood is great and it is near the Trail for walking.  The  metroploitan market is near by for gourmet food and more and you could have bus service and as said walking is grand in Seattle.
Our host was most gracious and let us bring our luggage in through the garage which saved using the 5 stairs to the apt. 
Again all the listed amenities are good and it was quiet and comfortable .  We would love to stay again soon.
"
202260,31890180,2015-05-11,11607200,Lily,I had a wonderful time staying in Kerry's Seattle apartment. The apartment is adorable and comfy! Love love love the bedroom fireplace. I would stay here again any day
202260,32083807,2015-05-13,32444733,Rob,"Kerry was wonderful. She made us feel very welcome. She had a genuine sweetness to her and a real spirit of hospitality. She is not only knowledgeable about where she lives but you could easily tell she really loved living there, and and enjoyed sharing that with you as guests. She had a well laid out guest book with local information, including places to eat, and visit as well as a bus schedule. The accommodations were excellent, they were clean and fresh, stocked modestly with necessities for a short visit, local coffee and tea, organic cleaners and soaps. There were simple instructions for setting comfort levels, and Kerry even showed us hands on how to operate the heaters for the most efficient use. The fireplace in the bedroom was tremendous. The motion sensor lights along the walkway were an extra comfort coming back from our late night ventures in downtown Seattle. I highly recommend Kerry and this easily accessible downstairs apartment for anyone looking to just get away for a bit. There were plenty of cooking utensils, though based on the shortness of our visit we primarily used the teapot. It is likely on our next visit we will take more advantage of the kitchen. Thanks Kerry for a wonderful visit.  "
202260,32553324,2015-05-19,6431306,Thien-Kieu,"Kerry's place looked exactly as it does in the photos. The apartment is in a very quiet and beautiful residential neighborhood, and it was charming, clean, and comfortable. Kerry was there to greet us and give us a tour. She also had notes posted throughout the apartment, explaining how to use appliances, what to do for check out, etc. This is all in the house manual as well, but it was helpful to have reminders! Parking was always available, which was great since we had a rental car. I also appreciated all the magazines and guides about Seattle. My friend and I enjoyed flipping through them for ideas during our trip. We didn't interact with Kerry much after the first day, but she made sure we knew we could contact her with any questions. All in all, a great stay."
202260,33220156,2015-05-26,423381,Lynne,Comfortable apt in a quiet location.
202260,33800553,2015-06-01,16246932,Laura,"Kerry was an absolutely terrific host. Our flight was delayed and we arrived late at night, but Kerry made sure we had no issues with our arrival. Kerry's information package was very helpful in planning our stay before we arrived. The neighborhood is safe, quiet and a beautiful residential area. Easy to access downtown. The apartment felt like home away from home. It was apparent Kerry put thought and care into preparing the space for her guests. Very clean, tastefully decorated. Full kitchen. Very comfortable bed and linens. Beautiful large back garden. Kerry was so nice and made us feel very welcome. We were sad our vacation had to end!"
202260,34417708,2015-06-08,30149127,Jocie,"Kerry greeted us as we drove up.  She was very nice and explained the features of the apartment thoroughly.  We had a separate entrance, so did not have to disturb our host when we came and went.  The apartment was nicely appointed and comfortable for both reading and sleeping.  It was quite warm and sunny during our stay (surprise!), and the coolness of the partially below-ground apartment was welcome.  The location worked well for us, with a beautiful 24-hour market within 1/2 mile.  We will happily stay there again."
202260,44644737,2015-08-28,35756786,Richard,Kerry was extremely welcoming and immediately made us felt at ease and gave some helpful tips for getting around Seattle. We are doing a trip down the Oregon Coast and got some tips for further south. The place was spacious and clean and we'd happily recommend it to a friend.
202260,45067469,2015-08-31,32967477,Colton,"Kerry was very friendly and responsive, when a tree went down due to winds she notified me right away and we were able to get back with no fuss. The apt was wonderful and very spacious with a fantastic price. We went for PAX and her location was perfect for taking the bus to and from. Highly recommended!"
202260,46363045,2015-09-10,14087925,Marcus,"We really enjoyed our 9 day stay in Kerry's apartment. Kerry was a wonderful host, super friendly, and had great recommendations on what to visit in Seattle and Washington state. Her apartment is great. It is very spacious, clean, comfortable and has everything you need even for a longer stay.
We would love to come back some day in the future!"
202260,46493437,2015-09-11,38775437,Georgina,"Staying at Kerry's was an absolute delight; she is an excellent host with a beautiful space. Kerry is very personable, kind and communicative. The apartment was a wonderful size with comfortable furniture and gorgeous decor! 
I have already recommended Kerry's space as a haven for those wishing to stay somewhere a little quieter and away from Seattle city centre. I'd love to stay again. "
202260,46689558,2015-09-13,19346093,Karen-Marie,"Kerry was such a great host, she was avaliable and showed us around in the apartment. She told us all what we needed for shopping, hiking in the neighborhood, bus inf. etc.    
It was really easy to take the bus to downtown Seattle."
202260,48076713,2015-09-23,12990124,Serge,"Kerry's place was supremely clean, quiet, very modern, and very well-equipped. It felt spacious and open - very positive vibe. The bed was very comfortable and everything we needed to have a comfortable stay was provided. Kerry checked in with us regularly and made sure we had everything we needed - a very nice touch. Also really appreciated the parking spot - no need to drive around trying to find one after exploring Seattle all day!

The place is within minutes driving from great breakfast/lunch spots and there is a 71/76 bus stop two blocks away that takes you into all the different Seattle neighborhoods. Make sure to try out Bryant Corner on 65th for some excellent breakfast/brunch!"
202260,48208774,2015-09-24,14214440,Kevin,Great host and nice environment. Thank you for the hospitality.
202260,48999884,2015-09-30,30985852,Katie,"This was our first Airbnb experience and Kerry made us feel very welcome! She greeted me upon my arrival and showed me all around the apartment to make sure we knew how everything worked. Kerry also provided us with numerous suggestions about things to do in the area, which was very helpful. Kerry made herself available if needed, and was very quick to respond to any questions we had. My fiance and I stayed at the apartment for 5 nights and it worked perfectly for our vacation. It is located within a few blocks from major bus lines, making it easy to travel downtown. The bed is very comfortable and we enjoyed using the fireplace when it got a little chilly at night and in the mornings. We are very pleased with our stay at Kerry's apartment! "
202260,49240818,2015-10-02,24441303,Michaela,"I had a wonderful stay at Kerry's place! She was very accommodating to my late arrival and still took time to show me around the apartment. The place was clean and comfortable and located in a lovely neighborhood. 
I only needed a one night stay but the apartment would be perfect for a longer trip to Seattle for a couple or friends who don't mind sharing a bed! Thank you Kerry!"
202260,51154457,2015-10-18,6275564,Mark,Kerry has everything dialled in. There is a reason she is a super host. Had a great stay. 
202260,52062592,2015-10-26,4349427,Ashley,"Kerry is the most amazing host!  She's just such a lovely person!  From our initial interaction online to saying our goodbyes, she was incredibly kind and helpful making our entire experience all the more enjoyable.  

When we arrived, she helped us bring in our bags and walked us through everything involving the apartment and neighborhood.  She knows the area well and is more than happy to share her knowledge as well as answer questions.  This really made all the difference to us, as we were entirely new to the city.    

We absolutely loved the apartment!  It's so nice and so cozy - exactly as listed! The neighborhood was just as lovely - very quiet and friendly, close to everything you could want.   It all made for the most relaxing travel experience we've ever had!

We truly could not be happier with our experience and can't wait to visit again!   "

202260,56191456,2015-12-10,24427741,Kanokwan,My girlfriend and I enjoyed our stayed. When we first arrived she showed us around the apartment. Although it's in the basement it doesn't even feel like you're in the basement. The fire place is the bedroom was a great touch for the rainy weather. Also Kerry book selections are outstanding. I will definitely stay here again. 
202260,56309871,2015-12-12,10109474,Linda,Kerry is a Super Host personified.  Her space is just perfect and the location is great! She is a very gracious host whom we hope to visit in all future travels to Seattle.

It was a perfect place for us to spend a couple of nights in Seattle visiting friends in our old neighborhood.     Even though it is off a busy street, it was quiet at night.  The bed was very comfortable.   "
5991139,38721691,2015-07-18,19431870,Laura,"Annie's place was fantastic. Great location, right near the hustle and bustle of Ballard which has great restaurants and bars, plus access to buses (an express bus to downtown!). 

It is a light and airy little cottage, yet also has heaps of space for anything you might need. While we did not meet Annie as she was away, Annie was really lovely and accommodating, and even sourced us a blow up mattress before she left! 

I would highly reccommend this little cottage to anyone hoping to check out Ballard/Seattle. "

7988436,52811759,2015-11-01,21859193,Siobhan,"Neighborhood was fine for city living. You can expect some street noise. It was really pretty quiet. 
It was a very nice place. Clean and cozy. Our own bathroom and great shower. 
Nice dinning and living area. There were others staying in the downstairs but we never heard them. 
Shoes off policy which was nice. There are stairs to the top floor rooms. 
Rich was an excellent and super helpful host. He went out of his way to take my last minute booking and time constraints. 
I will stay here again.

Rich's place is awesome! I wish it was my house. I recon he is a thoughtfull guy (left a bottle of water on the bed, really nice). The bed is super nice, and shower was also good.

7988436,58382100,2016-01-02,50690609,Sean,Rich is awesome! The house is perfect for Airbnb and rich makes sure you have everything you need! The location is right next to a bunch of great restaurants and coffee shops! Would definitely come back again!
7095802,37716607,2015-07-09,1269051,Carlos,Everything was as described. Kevin was very good at communicating with us and very nice. Everything was clean and organized. Thanks!
7095802,38566581,2015-07-16,37716820,Michael,Really cool and clean place! perfect to stay when u are in Seattle! Thank you for hosting
7095802,39685593,2015-07-25,38193325,Tabitha,Room is as described. Complete kitchen for cooking. Bathroom is shared but we did not have any issues with it. Kevin has excellent response time to questions or concerns. In a nice quiet neighborhood not too far from downtown and nightlife areas.
7095802,39996589,2015-07-27,32721570,Rachel,"Kevin was a welcoming and understanding host as we were ten minutes late for checkout. This happened because there currently is construction around the area which meant cabs as well as buses had to be rerouted. Our bus broke down on the Sunday morning thus having to switch buses and change route. 
The place was clean (minus the tub in the bathroom) and nice. This place was a good place to stay. However, if you are a light sleeper the doors are stiff and are very loud when opening and shutting. 
If you are just looking for a clean room and a bed to sleep I would recommend this place.

7095802,40173927,2015-07-28,39272285,Kelleen,We had a perfectly pleasant time at this place.  It was quaint and just how it was described. The yard was nice.
7095802,40809070,2015-08-02,38620904,Matt,The room was exactly as indicated in photos and description. Sharing the bathroom with other guests never posed any problem. The location was perfect for visiting Seattle and close to bus routes and near downtown. Kevin was helpful and friendly and available to answer any questions we had. Thanks for a pleasant stay! :) 
7095802,41668844,2015-08-08,39286813,Gabrielle,"Nice, clean, quiet space. Easy to find and gain access to. Did not meet host but he made sure we had all info regarding check in/out/ wifi and city suggestions for us before we arrived. "
7095802,41985615,2015-08-10,432804,Julia,"Good place to stay, perfect for what we needed. Quiet and conveniently located. We never met the host but he was very responsive :)"
7095802,43726548,2015-08-21,33470896,Angela,"Kevin was a great host. It was very warm in Seattle while we were there and we checked in it was warm in the room. Kevin hooked us up with a new fan to make sure we were comfy. Bed was very comfy. You are sharing a bathroom with others (like a dorm) and the room is very small. However, we were only there one night and it was super close to downtown and from a bus stop so it was totally worth it.  "
7095802,44150314,2015-08-24,38439773,Coraline,"La chambre était propre, lumineuse et très agréable tout comme les parties communes. 
L accès au centre ville est facile également via des bus et rapide. 
Enfin, l'hôte, Kevin, est très gentil, disponible et accueillant. Très bon Airbnb ! "
7095802,44471243,2015-08-26,34638395,Susanna,Great first stay in Seattle -- Kevin was accomodating and attentive. Thanks for everything!
7095802,44730152,2015-08-28,42083901,Natalie,Great stay! Thank u Kevin!
7095802,45381589,2015-09-02,35734640,Cody,"Kevin was a good host, left clear and easy to follow instructions on how to check in and out, even asked if I wanted a fan for my room since it was a warm night the day of my arrival. The bathroom is shared with other people, but was never a problem. Downtown Seattle was only a quick 8 minute drive away, maybe less. If you're like me and just want a place to sleep/shower and keep your belongings, look no further."
7095802,45598494,2015-09-04,10140149,Simmi,"I stayed at Kevin's place for one night before work meetings in downtown Seattle the next day. Kevin was a very responsive and communicative host. I was concerned about being a bit cold, and when I let Kevin know he brought me an extra blanket. Kevin also provided water bottles and towels. I found street parking easily near the house. The room was a little smaller than I had expected, but it was clean and functional. The bathroom is shared, but I didn't have any issues getting in when I needed to. I would recommend this place for a busy person who has a lot on their plate and needs a simple place to sleep at night. "
7095802,46158265,2015-09-08,1407931,Kate,Fantastic stay at Kevin's. Excellent and informative communication from time of booking. Everything as described. We ran into him a couple of times and he was so lovely giving us tips on the best places to check out! Thanks again!
7095802,46454411,2015-09-10,43213031,Harry,"I loved the fact that we needed a room immediately with an early check in and we were easily accommodated within just a couple of hours.  This was our very first bnb experience and we were soo happy with our decision to do this we will be visiting more bnbs as we travel quite a bit. Thank you for being so helpful. The room was just as described.Although there wasn't a TV the internet was very strong and very fast, so my wife and I were a ble to watch Netflix from my phone. A bit small but accommodating. Oh and the bed.....aaahhh so comfortable 
:)"
7095802,48894721,2015-09-29,34790453,Tuyen,"Host - Kevin had everything prepared and his messages were concise with lots of good info. He was very responsive.
Room - The room is basic, but comfortable. Shared bathroom was fine. Good for solo travelers.
Location - Great location, close to lots of good stuff. This is my main reason for staying here. I didn't take advantage of the public transit since I had a car but it seems really convenient to use from the house. I had no trouble with street parking during my stay."
7095802,49559217,2015-10-04,1957700,Nancy,"It was nice to have detailed description about directions and restaurants around (please add the ligh trail station name to help others in the future). The room itself was ok. There was water, cup, lotion, towels and even a roll of toilette paper (since the bath was shared).  I am personally allergic to fabric softners of the bedding, so i had to sleep with my own towel covering the pillow so i wouldn't smell it.   The sheets had pilling on it as if it were very old. Then i saw a HUGE crack in the window (behind the pillows) as i left in the morning...that is a safety compromise and i wish that was disclosed in the profile (i wouldnt' have stayed in a room with that).  Kevin himself was friendly and helpful when i accidentally ran into him.  The doors weren't well aligned (both to the room and to the bathroom), so when i had to get ready and leave in the morning, i felt i was waking everyone up with the door making big noises from the jamming.  Last thing- someone was talking loud either outside or upstairs and maybe because of the crack in the window, i could hear almost every word of their conversation. it finally stopped after 11pm. "
7095802,49895562,2015-10-07,38378604,Lucas,Room was as shown and everything was set up well to accommodate accordingly.
7095802,51325188,2015-10-19,14188249,Anna,"The location and price are very convenient.
It was easy to find place using host's guidelines.  
Room is really small. Bath and kitchen are shared with more tenants. Unfortunately,kitchen and bath are not very clean. No desire to cook there. Need to wait if toiled is occupied. "
7095802,51517179,2015-10-20,20838140,Alex,"The queen size mattress is the most comfortable one I ever experienced on AirBnB. But to be honest, I didn't recommend so much if you seek for a clean living environment. The kitchen is shared with 3 other room guests so it is just a big mess when you entered the kitchen. Lots of dishes are just thrown into the sink. And also the floor is not clean very much.  On that night, i guess there are 3 guests in another room and one more guest in second room. So you can imagine  how long the queue is for the showering.  But the good thing is Kevin is nice, his response is fast as well if you message him.  So if you don't care much about the cleanness and long time waiting for the bathroom, it is not a bad choice."
7095802,57364577,2015-12-25,25978036,Christian,"Very nice room, a little smaller than I thought but It was perfect for to be honest. Private entrance, so I was able to come home any time and not worry if I was going to be disturbing anyone and Kevin is upstairs in case you need anything. I had a great time!"
7095802,57735747,2015-12-28,27543216,Abood,Kevin let us in and everything was fine! Bed was comfy and clean. Great location!
3898692,18214678,2014-08-23,13147569,Cédric,"Alex and Tony were perfect hosts : always available but never overbearing. Alex gave us a lot of good advices (Uber, Alki Beach...).
The apartment is very nice, full-equipped. Very cosy and comfortable. The surroundings are very quiet. A bit far from downtown but you can't have everything. We used public transportation most of the time and we made it. But be prepared to walk if you travel this way. I would definitely recommend Alex apartment."
3898692,18285143,2014-08-24,19867931,Eryn,"Alex lives in a beautiful neighbourhood in Seattle. Both the interior and exterior of the house is gorgeous. The place looks exactly (if not better) then the pictures she provided. The apartment was perfectly clean, spacious and provided all the necessities we would need for our stay. I never actually had the opportunity to meet Alex but she quickly communicated via email to all of my questions. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!

3898692,19043535,2014-09-05,19183469,Ken,Alex and Tony were great hosts! Apartment was spacious and clean. Definitely an awesome place to stay!
3898692,19428851,2014-09-12,1581651,Karen,"I really enjoyed staying in this lovely, clean apartment.  It was so comfortable, I was sad to leave.  The neighborhood was quiet and located very near to Alki Beach and stores and restaurants.  The hosts were very welcoming and helpful.  I highly recommend this apartment."
3898692,19991095,2014-09-21,7599763,Steven,"Nice, clean apartment. Convenient and close to Alki Beach."
3898692,20073540,2014-09-22,21504682,Alisa,"Listing description was accurate and the place was even larger than we expected; the hosts were warm, welcoming, and helpful! Magnificent views of the sound as you drive around the neighborhood; within walking distance of Alki which was super convenient! We would highly recommend this listing."
3898692,20370852,2014-09-28,21107164,Luisa,"This was a great place for me to stay. Alex was a great hostess, I did not get to see her but she stayed on top of things, when the rain came she was caring enough to text me and offer an umbrella, I had a sweet welcoming card and I was welcomed to eat her fresh strawberries planted at the front. The apartment is quite complete for short or long stays with a very complete kitchen. The apartment has great natural light and a huge walk in closet to organize everything in the main room, everything was tastefully and simply decorated. Driving distance I was 5-10 minutes from most things in West Seattle, not exactly walking distance but not impossible either!
I look forward to another opportunity to stay there. "
3898692,21260340,2014-10-13,22221768,Jeremy,"Alex was very helpful, accommodating, and flexible from reservation through checkout. This tidy, well furnished apartment comfortably accommodated 3 and is located in a quite neighborhood minutes from Alki beach. Pending availability, I hope to stay here again during my next visit to Seattle. 

Thanks Alex!

3898692,21491937,2014-10-18,6568701,Sébastien,"Nice apartment with a very comfy bed! The location is great: 25' from SeaTac airport, not far from downtown. Alki Beach is a pleasant place with restaurant, bars and only 20-30' by foot. My only regret is that we couldn't stay longer to enjoy the place!"
3898692,21635868,2014-10-20,22458581,Wade,"Alex is an excellent host! Everything was as described we got in late but that was no problem everything seemed to fall into place nicely. We did use her recommendation for the water taxi, as well as her recommendation for Uber, both worked out great were an easy way to get around town. We even got help with our car the day we checked out, it turns out our battery had died in the evening so that was very helpful! All in all a great trip. Thanks Alex!"
3898692,21808836,2014-10-24,22633680,Susan,"The house was exactly what we were looking for: a very nice, comfortable, clean and quiet apartment.  While the apartment is in the basement, we hardly ever heard the host/s upstairs.  We never met Alex in person but she was a great host - she checked in to make sure that we weren't too cold and everything was going well.  I would highly recommend this location for anyone looking to stay in West Seattle!  "
3898692,21929535,2014-10-26,3494049,Elinor,Our stay at Alex's was short but sweet. Alex was easy to contact and followed up immediately. We arrived later than planned and everything was ready for us. She even let us stay later in the morning when we were slow getting going. We would be happy to stay here again and bring the kids next time. Lots of room for all.
3898692,22262081,2014-11-02,22669446,Nate,"This was a great stay in West Seattle. Alex was an excellent, considerate host and very communicative. There is much to do in the area and she provided quite a bit of info on getting around.  I appreciated all of the great recommendations!

The cozy, spacious apartment is in a great location and in a quiet neighborhood. The description and pictures accurately convey the apartment.  I also liked that it was clean and complete with a traveler's necessities."
3898692,24869449,2015-01-03,19360231,Juan Manuel,"Very nice place. Very clean and tidy. Properly equipped .  Located in a quiet neighbourhood  close to a beautiful beach and 10 min from  downtown (by car) 

We will definitely stay there again in our next adventure to Seattle! 

"
3898692,25633307,2015-01-21,24861357,Amy,The area is wondergup for walking and close to restaurants  and the beach.  In our case we went to Seatitle for a funeral as and  our Host was very nice to us. The apartment was clean and well equipped. We would certainly  come back.
3898692,26108739,2015-02-03,16712067,Jamie,"I stayed in three different airbnbs in the span of a week and this place was by far my favorite. Alex thought of everything a guest might want. The place is comfortable, spacious, and in a great neighborhood. A full kitchen, large bathroom, separate bedrooms and living area leave you wanting for absolutely nothing. If you stay here, be sure to take a walk through Schmitz park and down to Alki beach. It's gorgeous."
3898692,26146044,2015-02-04,1286876,Randi,"easy to find, quite, very spacious, great for people with a couple kids. Very nice! "

3898692,27366825,2015-03-02,19747509,Katie,"Alex has a beautiful home in a very lovely neighborhood right down the street from not only Alki Beach, but a very cute little town with all kinds of easily accessible shops and restaurants. The place is a basement apartment, with easy access and parking. The rooms are right next to one another and the bathroom is located in the main bedroom. It is a pretty good sized place! Plenty of outlets, and comfortable lighting. The bathroom, kitchen and closets had everything that one would need to stay (dishware, shampoo, hangers). The beds and bedding were very comfortable and provided were plenty of extra blankets if needed, but the place was quite cozy and warm. There is a TV in the living room with ample seating. Great for anyone looking for a quiet place to stay! We enjoyed our stay and will definitely return on our next visit to Seattle! "
3898692,27473369,2015-03-05,25822181,Allison,Alex was a gracious host. The space was comfortable and quiet.
3898692,28866567,2015-03-31,25906149,Lee,"Alex was a fantastic host! The place was exceptionally clean, very comfortable, and the location can't be beat. Getting in and out of downtown was a breeze, and there's plenty of great stuff to see and do (and eat!) within walking distance. House is on a very quiet street, so no worries about outside noise keeping you awake.

The kitchen had absolutely everything we could have possibly wanted... even take-out cups for coffee and tea! Comfy couch, chairs, and beds, nice, hot shower. Can't imagine staying in a hotel in Seattle after staying here."
3898692,29307197,2015-04-06,11770231,Amy,"My husband, 2-yr old and I had a great time. The place was clean, spacious, well stocked, and had convenient parking. The queen bed was super comfortable too! Alex was super helpful with ideas of things to do in the area. We would happily go back!"
3898692,29870762,2015-04-13,14285274,Christy,"We had a great stay at Alex's apartment. It was close enough to downtown and a great distance to the junction and Alki. We needed to cut our trip short by a day which was unfortunate, wish we could have spent the last night there! Thanks so much! "
3898692,30872451,2015-04-28,14678013,David,Enjoyed our stay! The accommodations and location were prefect for us.
3898692,31578941,2015-05-07,18838758,Deanna,"The apartment was much bigger than I expected.  It had everything that we needed and was a perfect location as our daughter lived less than a mile away.  The pictures are exactly what you will find.  Very clean.

Alex's yard is beautiful with many fruit trees and raised vegetable beds in the back.  The surrounding area are yards full of flowers, we stayed the beginning of May."
3898692,32036525,2015-05-12,21649278,Claudia,"Alex is a very helpfull and friendly host. She showed us all we needed, the possibilites to get arround, she let us do some laundry and irnoning, she gave us eggs from their chicken as a gift. We spent a great time at this place."
3898692,32267312,2015-05-16,12486540,Monika,"Alex is a wonderful host and the apartment is fabulous!! It is spacious, very clean, nice bathroom area, kitchen with everything you need to cook a meal, and a cozy living room. The bed was comfortable with plenty of extra blankets. There were several big windows to let the light in. The location is in a very quite residential area that is walkable or short drive to different parks, beach, restaurants, etc. I loved that I could park the car right by the private apartment entrance. Alex is available for communication anytime. She is very accommodating, kind, and caring. I felt like I was right at home and would love to stay again. I highly recommend!"
3898692,33662389,2015-05-31,29601829,Ivy,"It was our first time using AirBnb and it was a great experience. Alex (the host) was responsive with questions before I signed up. She also checked in on us during our stay to make sure that we were okay, that the temp in the apt was pleasant and to ask if we needed access to the laundry. 

The apartment felt like home. It was clean and very cozy. It had a lot of day-to-day basic essentials. It was in a nice and quiet neighborhood. The second bedroom with a daybed and a trundle bed was perfect for our two small children. The kitchen was perfectly equipped for cooking meals which saved us a lot of money since we generally had breakfast in the apartment and cooked a few meals there when we didn't feel like eating out. 

The location was conveniently close to the airport, to downtown Seattle and walking distance to the beach and nice restaurants. It felt like we didn't have to waste time travelling to and from where we needed to go because everything was close. 

I would highly recommend this apartment for anyone looking to stay in the Seattle area. "
3898692,34805197,2015-06-12,34124241,Kevin,"Alex's place was perfect for our 3 night stay! I never got to meet Alex but she made sure to check up on us and see if everything was perfect. I really appreciate that. Really clean and cozy home, felt just like home. Short walking distance to the beautiful Alki Beach, and close driving distance to downtown. Love the bulletin board with attraction suggestions! Thanks so much for the accommodation Alex, I'll be sure to check in again when I'm in Seattle without hesitation!"
3898692,34982228,2015-06-14,9931603,Marcia,Alex remembered our reason for renting her place and was thoughtful to let me know as soon as the unit was available allowing me to check in a bit early and reduce a bit of stress for the day.  Her place is quite charming and provides quick access to all areas of West Seattle.  This was a great space for a family to stay.  We would definitely return!
3898692,35453019,2015-06-19,15097173,Harold,"We had a wonderful time staying at Alex's home.  It was clean, comfortable, and had nice amenities.  We appreciated her providing basics such as shampoo, coffee, and had laundry facilities available for our use.
She also brought us eggs from her chickens, and a bowl of fresh strawberries from her yard!!
She provided pamphlets on Seattle, and a board that had walking/driving destinations just blocks/minutes from her home.  The neighborhood was clean and quiet, with very nice surrounding homes, making for an enjoyable walk to the market and Alki Beach for breakfast.
We will definitely be back when in Seattle.
"
3898692,38089278,2015-07-12,26374379,Deb,The host canceled this reservation 34 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3898692,57844623,2015-12-29,52115527,Tim,There was no contact from the host. The accommodations were exactly as portrayed. Neighborhood was clean and safe. It isn't as close to nor as convenient to public bus line as expected. 
4025593,20798282,2014-10-05,21791178,Andre,"Tiffany and Derek are friendly, helpful and great hosts. They´ve provided the basics and some beer, that we´ve drunken during several hang outs. We´ve had lots of fun with them and could use equipment that usually don´t belong to a BnB. I absolutely recommend them."
4025593,21181226,2014-10-12,22219605,Adam,Tiffany and Derek were wonderful and inviting. The space was cozy even though I wasn't able to be around much.  I was even able to knock out some laundry and finish the night with a Rainier ( compliments of the hosts of course ) 
4025593,21256777,2014-10-13,10708840,Eugenie,"Tiffany and Derek are friendly hosts and we had a good time chatting with them at our arrival.
The apartment is conveniently situated very close to freeway (but not noisy), and we found a place to park right in front of the building.
The neighborhood is nice as well and you can walk to bar, restaurant and lake. "
4025593,21690467,2014-10-21,1261520,Liza,"This place is truly awesome!!
Green Lake is a wonderful neighborhood, very safe and nice, with lot of friendly people and tons of things to do and see. 
The flat is well connected by bus (no. 16 and 26, even in the night). Nice stores and groceries (try the pcc!) at just few steps. The apartment is very cozy, familiar, and clean. The room has a good mattress, space for your stuff, is very clean and welcoming. I could sleep perfectly. Tiffany and Derek are the perfect hosts! I had really a great time with them so that I decided to stay longer. They have been soooo kind to borrow me their gorgeous race bike, which made a real difference in my Seattle experience. If you feel like, you can bike to downtown, it's about 20' and it is a very nice trail. On the return trip, if you are tired and do not want to bike up to the hill, you can catch the bus and put the bike on it for free (just saying to Europeans who are not used to this special transport facility). I could also use the kitchen and their space. I really felt like at home. I guarantee, this was much more than just a b'n'b stay!  
A 5++++ stars place and 5++++ hosts! Thanks for everything! "
4025593,22210775,2014-11-01,6689488,Eddie,"Tiffany and Derek were the most gracious hosts! Since I was traveling alone and on a budget, their place was perfect for my needs. I felt completely comfortable during my entire stay. The room was clean and exactly as it was described and the apartment was conveniently located just a few blocks from Green Lake. Parking may be a little hard to come by but this was clearly explained and communicated when making the reservation. Thank you Tiffany and Derek for opening up your home to me and helping make my first trip to Seattle a memorable one!"
4025593,22380457,2014-11-04,18409608,Stephen,"My host was very understanding and very hospitable. The room was comfortable, I used the fridge and dryer, and I had both privacy and was given the use of a bicycle. I appreciated talking with Tiffany and her husband Derek and they had great suggestions. 

Being close to Green Lake was a plus for exercising and walking. Frankly, it couldn't have been better."
4025593,22507531,2014-11-08,22714746,Anna,"Tiffany and Derek are fantastic, this adventurous couple we help you out as much as they can to make you feel at home, giving advices about the city, the surroundings, the outback and also other cities. Very clean and convenient. They are airbnb people ! Thanks to them"
4025593,22569526,2014-11-09,23392878,Pierre,"Tiffany and Derek were really friendly hosts. They definitely made us feel at home. Also, the apartment is clean, quiet, but has a very interesting personality. It is also not very far from downtown and next to the highway, which makes it extremely convenient to get around. We only stayed there for one night, but will definitely be on our mind the next time we want to spend some days in Seattle.

4025593,23010959,2014-11-20,9213743,Thomas,"Tiffany and Derek made me feel very welcome in their home -- I was out and about most of the day but they were around in the evening to chat and provide some recommendations of things to do. The apartment is as described -- very comfortable and close to the beautiful Green Lake, various bus stops, and a number of good cages and bars. 
I'd definitely recommend staying there, and hope to return myself one day!"

4025593,23339136,2014-11-29,2916925,Margaret,"Tiffany and Derek were awesome! They coordinated well with each other to make sure we had what we needed for our holiday visit to my sister's. It was a nice, clean, comfortable space and though they mention in the description that it's small, it felt like plenty of room! The location was also easy, right off of I-5 near great shops and resources at Green Lake. "
4025593,23484711,2014-12-01,24243301,Ben,"I am an experienced traveler who can confidently say that Derek and Tiffany have a wonderful home and made me feel instantly part of it. The room was comfortably warm (it was snowing outside, so this was greatly welcomed). They had travelers maps and guides posted to help their guests generate ideas of things to do. Even more importantly, they took the time to show me around to give a local perspective of the city and I felt that I was truly among friends. Not even mentioning that their price is the most affordable, the location, accommodations and hosts made my Seattle experience one to remember! Definitely deserve a 10/10 rating and I hope them all the best in the future."
4025593,23557499,2014-12-04,18563006,Steve,"We had an enjoyable stay. House is in a good location with easy access to downtown via several bus lines. All amenities close by. Would recommend having a beer at Teddy's on 65th!

4025593,23872435,2014-12-13,16659737,Lucy,"Tiffany and Derek were great hosts! Their place is really clean, warm, and they were completely chill about using the communal space. It's pretty easy to get downtown as the bus stop is a couple of blocks away and there are shops to get groceries and coffee etc locally. Very close to the park/lake so if you like jogging it's really easy to get your fix. Although I would recommend wearing more than a t-shirt if it threatens rain - we got soaked! Definitely recommend - also great value for money compared to other local accommodation. "
4025593,24106264,2014-12-20,23039663,Edwin,"Tiffany was an amazing host! She provided us with all the essentials and much more, we had an amazing and comfortable stay with her!

4025593,25782062,2015-01-25,8555718,Roland Stewart,Tiffany and Derek were Great.  I was Really late and they still met me with a smile.  I went straight to the shower - terrific water pressure which is important to me - and then to bed.  I do not remember my head hitting the pillow.  I had a wonderful night's sleep.  The bed may be a futon but the mattress is superb.  Tiffany and Derek are a nice couple and I would enjoy staying at their place again.

4025593,26107153,2015-02-03,25963530,Natasha,"Awesome location really close to a beautiful lake. The apartment itself was so homie and well-decorated, but most importantly, the hosts are warm and present but never pushy. You really get the feel that they'd be there for you if you wanted them to, but they'd never smother you with ""hostliness"". Highly recommend!"

They are awesome and the room was exactly as described. The location was perfect for our needs and, overall, we had a blast visiting Seattle!"
4025593,27104064,2015-02-25,14798039,Erni,The room was exactly as it was described - cozy room by the Green Lake (Make sure to walk or jogg around it at least once.). Tiffany and Derek leave you a lot of privacy but then again it feels like you live in a modern Seattle home. Strongly reccomended. 
4025593,27192224,2015-02-27,25455546,Gaston,"Tiffany y Derek son muy buenos y amables. El cuarto y el apartamento son realmente acojedores y el barrio posiblemente uno de los mas bellos de Seattle, ideal para descansar y estar a minutos del centro. Muchas gracias por recibirnos Tiffany & Derek!!"

4025593,27993557,2015-03-16,3433423,Colleen,"Tiffany and Derek were easy to communicate with before I arrived and greeted me at our agreed upon time. They were both super friendly and their apartment is spacious, clean, and just like the pictures. There were plenty of options for food and recreation within walking distance and Tiffany and Derek gave me ideas and directions. The room is completely set up with maps, bus guides, and tourist guides to Seattle. They even have a guide to each room letting you know about basic things like heating, how to turn the shower on and use the tv, which is really nice so I didn't have to bug them for help when I woke up early for my workshop. I think the best part of my stay was getting to chat with Tiffany and Derek. I could tell they really like getting to meet so many different people and help them have a nice experience in Seattle. "
4025593,28319850,2015-03-22,27620570,Shannon,Tiffani's and Derrick were great hosts! The room was the perfect space. The location was excellent with restaurants and stores very close by as well as bus stops to get into the city.

It's a good place that you can stay in Seattle.   "

The room was on the third floor, clean, comfortable and quiet most of the time. The apartment is in walking distance to shops, bus stops and park, which is convenient for visitors. The neighborhood is quite nice and I felt safe walking late at night. Thank you for sharing time with me, Tiffany and Derek! Hope to see you two again soon."

I was in and out quite a bit so I didn't have too much interaction with Tiffany and Derek, but  when we did run into each other they were incredibly friendly, welcoming and happy to chat! The room was perfect and the many maps and bus guides really helped out as I was traveling without a car. Loved the location as well: super convenient to good coffee, food and, of course, the gorgeous Green Lake park! The perfect home base for exploring Seattle from a less-touristy perspective:)"
4025593,30100039,2015-04-17,30650146,Justin,Thanks for a great place to crash for night. Nice cozy room and an awesome host!

The room was a great size for one to two people and was extremely cozy. The neighborhood was nice with the lake close by and different places to eat. Also the bus stop that heads downtown is right around the corner. I returned my rental car because I just ended up using public transportation the whole time. 

I would definitely stay here again whenever I make another trip to Seattle. "
4025593,31122877,2015-05-02,18597469,Jazziel,I wanted to experience the local culture of Seattle. Tiffany was helpful with providing recommendations which neighborhoods to explore. Tiffany and Derek were pretty chill. The apartment is located in a quiet and safe neighborhood. There are stores and coffee shops that's walking distance or a short drive away. I enjoyed my stay in Seattle. 
4025593,32324104,2015-05-17,7499989,Lasse Patrick,"Tiffany and Derek are really great hosts! Really helpful and considerate. They have alot of great suggestions about what to see and do in Seattle that are really worth your time.
The room was perfect for me and had a really comfy bed! I was out alot but when I was in the apt I was mainly hanging out with Tiffany and Derek in their living room. They are really good fun and laid back people. I really enjoyed hanging out with them.
I highly recommend this place! It's in a very cool area. Very close to busses and Green Lake."
4025593,32772588,2015-05-21,10703453,Mike,"Tiffany made me feel very welcome, she graciously waited for me until 11:00 PM when I arrived after my plane had been delayed a few hours. 

I also loved staying at her place, it is in a perfect part of town right next to the beautiful Green Lake. It is also right next to a bus which goes directly to UW (I was involved with a project there).

I recommend staying Tiffany's place, it was great!"

There was a little problem with hot water (fixed promptly) & she treated us to vegan cookies for the trouble - the apartment was clean & convenient to a lot of Seattle :) I would recommend her place to anyone looking for an affordable, clean, & quiet place to stay in Seattle. "
4025593,34939282,2015-06-14,28808333,Ami,"Tiffany is very kind , and the room is so comfortable. I stayed at her house for a week. It was easy to go to downtown from there. All coffee shop and donuts shop that she gave me recommended was so nice! So I enjoyed my trip in Seattle.
1週間滞在しました。ティファニーはとても親切でフレンドリーで、部屋もとても快適で、過ごしやすかったです。バスストップが家から近く、ダウンタウンなどへのアクセスもよかったです。彼女がおすすめしてくれたコーヒーショップなどのスポットも全て素晴らしく、シアトルへ来たのは初めてでしたがとても楽しい旅行になりました。"

Tiffany is very down to earth and easy to talk to. The room was very cozy and had a nice view. The neighborhood was really nice and everything was close to each other.

4025593,37292950,2015-07-06,17438670,Julia,"Tiffany's apartment is ideally located: it only takes you a 30min bus ride to downtown Seattle and close to her home you'll find Green Lake which is great for a run or sunbathing on a summer's day. 
Although we did not get to meet Tiffany in person, she took care of everything we needed and made us a warm welcome. Surprisingly we didn't need to care about breakfast but where offered it with strawberries, orange juice and all you need :-). Tiffany provided maps, bus timetables, other brochures and not to forget her great detailed personnel guide to Seattle and her neighbourhood to keep us informed. Thank you again a lot for everything Tiffany! "

Tiffany was extremely communicative, thorough, and welcoming even though she couldn't be there to greet us until the morning. I thought the complimentary Rainiers was a very sweet touch. Even though I didn't drink them, they are a good symbol of what it felt like to stay with Tiffany - she just took that extra step as a host. I just felt so welcome and comfortable. The apartment was noticeably clean and tidy."
4025593,39488642,2015-07-24,15911131,Vanessa,"Tiffany provided a cozy room accurate to what was shown in her listing. I had a very comfortable stay the few days I had put up there.

Tiffany also provides a variety of maps to the different towns in Seattle and a guide to the surrounding Green Lake area. It is very convenient taking the bus downtown or to most of the other neighbouring towns. Bus stops are just several blocks away, within walking distance from the apartment. 

Surrounding the lake, which is also a short walk from the apartment, are a selection of food and beverage conveniently located. If, like myself, it is your first time travelling to Seattle I would definitely recommend this listing!"

4025593,39794923,2015-07-26,35659008,Andrea,"Tiffany was wonderful! The space was centrally located, comfortable and cozy. I definitely recommend the donut shop (Mighty-O Donuts) that Tiffany told me about. I also really liked the Wallingford area nearby.

4025593,41085451,2015-08-04,3977938,Eric,"Tiffany was quite welcoming. She had clear instructions printed out. There was a bit of breakfast to be had. It was a hot day and the apartment did not have air conditioning, but she already had a fan going and it was quite comfortable. The street corner had signage that did not match her address, but she spotted me (on foot) taking a wrong turn and called to help me get back. (With a GPS, you should have no trouble.) I really liked the neighbor hood. A bunch of pretty good eateries around and Green Lake Park, a few blocks away, is great. (Just don't get knocked over by some cross fit fanatic.) Tiffany also supplied tour guide books which I found interesting. I enjoyed my short stay and recommend this place. It's a bargain to boot."
4025593,41228453,2015-08-05,2423248,Tilco,"Tiffany warmly welcomed us, even though we arrived very late at night because of unfortunate travel delays. We appreciated that very much, just like te nice and cozy appartment. "

It was a bonus to have a breakfast included and the bed was very comfy! Really good location as well, and lots of good places around to grab a bite to eat. I recommend any Airbnb users to stay at Tiffany and Derek's place!"
4025593,42383354,2015-08-13,32094602,Timothy,Tiffany was an awesome host! She was more than willing to wait for our late arrival because our train was delayed. Tiffany provided a badic breakfast every morning and had some great suggestions about the surrounding area(Teddy's if your 21+). We didnt run into each other to often but it was always fun getting a chance to talk to her! She was super nice and friendly. It was also awesome that she was nice enough to let us keep our bags at her house past checkout. THANKS AGAIN TIFFANY!! Would definitely stay here again next time were in Seattle.  
4025593,42551249,2015-08-14,18297413,Chris,"Tiffany was a great host. Although she was out for most of my stay, she was super helpful with communication before and making my arrival smooth with a secret key. complimentary beers were awesome after a long trip up to her beautiful place by green lake. The area is a nice respite from the bustle of the city, but not so far where you feel like you're away from all the happenings.  "

Tiffany made sure we felt at home and had breakfast items for us to eat every morning (along with complimentary cans of Rainier beer, coffee, and tea). She was kind enough to have a Seattle guide with recommendations for restaurants, coffee shops, and activities. The apartment's location is a few miles away from Downtown so it was perfect to see the outskirts of the city but still be close enough to be there in 10 minutes if need be. Greenlake is beautiful & really gave us a taste of Washington's natural beauty. Tiffany's apartment was the perfect stay for us and we would definitely come back!"
4025593,48506285,2015-09-27,35819787,Karen,"Tiffany was very nice and welcoming. I appreciate her for offering many travel directions and recommendations in Green Lake and Seattle.
It's my pleasure to stay at Green Lake. The neighbourhood was relaxing with a small town feel, and bus accessibility to downtown and U-District is very good."
4025593,49005764,2015-09-30,39247916,Zachery,"Tiffany was not with us during out stay but she made sure that everything was in place for us to enjoy our stay at her apartment. She made sure we had clean sheets and towels. She even left us food for breakfast! She also left us detailed instructions as well as a list of fun things to do during out stay.

We were also very impressed with how well she communicated with us. Her instructions for finding the home were clear and when we had questions she was very quick to respond. This all made for a very good experience. Thanks Tiffany!"
4025593,49433536,2015-10-04,25579264,Rachel,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for two nights and had a great stay. The apartment is clean and cosy and is in a great location - Greenlake is beautiful! Everything you need is in walking distance and it's easy to get into the city on the bus. Tiffany was a fab host, really helpful and very friendly. She also provided us with breakfast supplies and a couple of beers which was an added bonus! "
4025593,49628317,2015-10-05,42141207,Ryan,Tiffany made us feel very welcome and cozy (she even had some cold beer waiting for us in the fridge!). Her recommendations for what to do around Seattle were excellent! Even after we checked out she made sure that we new about a huge garage sale that REI was throwing and we went and saved a bunch of money on outdoor gear. Definitely would stay here again!
4025593,49927035,2015-10-07,44466165,Taeho,"Her first impression was very nice. And her preparation was perfect. Only the weather is good, but also gave prepared extra umbrellas, also gave a simple breakfast prepared with beer.
House location is in a quiet neighborhood, go to the downtown by bus takes about 30 minutes. The room was clean, and comfortable. Green Lake is also good to walk around the house in.
Uh, thanks for beer, Tiffany! See you next time. ^^"
4025593,50443140,2015-10-12,31517366,Marco,Our stay at Tiffanys was great. She made sure we had anything we needed and even helped us getting through the most rainy day ever with an extra umbrella. It was very uncomplicated and also very nice to stay near beautiful green lake. 
4025593,50735669,2015-10-13,40127899,Blair,"What a fantastic first experience on Airbnb.  Tiffany was an amazing host.  Firstly she accommodated on us such short notice, and secondly she was great help once we arrived with things to see and do during our short stay in Seattle.  Her notes, comments, and all information needed and relevant to the room, apartment, and area are so impressively detailed, greatly useful, and on point.  What's described is what you get, plus more.  Thank you for breakfast and the Reniers ;)  Even though we didn't spend much time with Tiffany due to our short stay, we are hoping to catch up with her and Derek during our next trip to Seattle.  Couldn't more highly recommend this host and her cozy, perfectly located room ;)"
4025593,50844072,2015-10-15,9752637,Noemi,Tiffany was a nice host. She was always there for us when we needed assistance.  We had our space and the bed was super comfortable. Thanks a lot Tiffany for hosting us.
4025593,51278418,2015-10-19,29187929,Ami,"This was a nice quiet place to stay. The Green Lake area is awesome and the apartment is a block away from the lake (a huge area to walk around, bike, etc.). It was one of my favorite areas of the city. The apartment was clean, Tiffany was very friendly and helpful beforehand and while I stayed there. If you want to use public transit, there is a bus stop about a block away - super convenient. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place for a budget trip!"
4025593,51466103,2015-10-20,35343907,Liza,We stayed a quick night at Tiffany's. She was nice and had lots of information about the city.

The description of the listing was accurate and the neighborhood was in a great location to enjoy local food, coffee, etc. I would definitely recommend them!"
4025593,53778201,2015-11-12,22853811,Stephanie,"We felt really welcomed when we arrived at Tiffany's place. Our room was really cozy. Everything we needed was right there in our room. Instructions were very clear of Tiffany's expectations; maps of Seattle, the metro schedule, and tour information of popular areas; fresh towels and a very comfortable bed. The location was superb. Right near Green Lake where we walked around the lake; it is right near the bus stop that took us into town in about 20 minutes, so we didn't have to drive (thank goodness!!); and there were great restaurants in the neighborhood. We really enjoyed our stay at Tiffany's place."
4025593,53830361,2015-11-13,25477273,Nisma,Loved our stay at Tiffany's. We had fun sharing our travel stories :-) And they were great at giving us tips on stuff to do and see in Seattle. The neighborhood was beautiful. Green lake is literally few blocks away. 
4025593,54246887,2015-11-17,45703586,Karen,"Tiffany and Derek are hospitality. When we arrived to Tiffany's apartment, Derek was downstairs to pick up us. 
The room is same as the description. Greenlake is quiet for people living and the scene is awesome. Tiffany's apartment is near to the bus stop. The direction put on the table of the room was really useful for visit good place in Seattle.
I recommend people stay at Tiffany's room who want to visit Seattle. "
4025593,54343617,2015-11-18,45108315,灵莉,"Tiffany and Derek are very kind and the room is very warm and comfortable. Thanks for the advice about the bus and food there, really helpful. We like the pictures on the wall of our room. Hope we have chance to come back!"

4025593,54558349,2015-11-21,48800666,George,"Tiffany and Derek were amazing hosts. Not only was the room comfortable and clean, but they went above and beyond in helping me figure out exactly what I wanted to do in Seattle. They suggested awesome restaurants, coffee shops, and breweries, as well as which touristy places are worth it and which aren't. They also provided good company and were great to talk to."
4025593,54865946,2015-11-25,45259876,Millie,"Tiffany and Derek are really good host.
make us comfortable to stay there.
Tiffany is really good communicator when i send message.
i really want to stay again. "

4025593,55568480,2015-12-02,7572136,Matthew,"My stay here was great! Tiffany and Derek were very helpful and made sure I had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. I wish I was around a little more to get to know them more but I enjoyed being in their company even for a short time, but I highly recommend staying with them if you're checking out Seattle."
4025593,56123327,2015-12-09,14266372,Kate,"Tiffany and Derek are awesome hosts and made us feel so at home - they even took us up into the mountains one of the days we were there. I cannot recommend them enough, and would definitely stay again (:
Thank you guys!"
4025593,56342067,2015-12-12,15501665,Jianhua,Tiffany的公寓不大， 但是布置很可爱，地方不是很繁华但也不难找，客厅厨房洗手间都很干净，这个房间比较迷你， 一个人却也足够，Tifanny为guest准备了不少东西，最好的就是她那份guide， 周边的吃住玩一应俱全，她的推荐都不错。 Tiffany人也很好，还会中文，真真能感受到她热爱生活喜欢旅行的性格来。希望下次来西雅图还能再住。
4660460,26631838,2015-02-16,23536484,Cynthia,"We enjoyed the flexible check-in and check-out time. Our hosts were able to meet with us and give us tips for dining nearby. On street parking was a bit crowded but we were lucky to find a spot every time. We were also given a parking pass, which was nice. We loved the small and cozy feel of the studio apartment!"
4660460,26937189,2015-02-22,20449585,Michel,Very nice stay. Mona was really welcoming and made sure that we had a good stay. The place provided almost everything u need for our stay. Will definitely come back in the future.
4660460,28166284,2015-03-19,26984690,Susan,"This place is in a great location, easy to get around by public transportation and the apartment was very comfortable."
4660460,28416338,2015-03-23,2186252,Ellen,"The listing description is very accurate.  This is a great little space!  The bed is very comfortable and the space is very cozy.  There's a full oven and some pots and pans and dishes, and even some cooking oil which came in handy.  

I only met Mona for a few minutes when I was leaving, but she was very friendly and easy to reach through messages and her partner was also easy to reach through text when I had a couple questions after check in.  She was extremely flexible with check in and check out times.   

The space was also very clean, which was a welcome change from a couple other recent airbnb experiences! 

There are several bus routes a couple blocks away, and some restaurants and pubs nearby.  The only thing that wasn't convenient in terms of location was that there's no grocery store close by, but there are some convenience stores and delis.   "
4660460,28543611,2015-03-25,509986,Tamara,"Excellent location in an amazing private residence. The pictures are very accurate. It's a super cute basement residence very close to some awesome, local coffee and restaurants. 

Mona is an excellent host. She even drew us a map of the area. Trust me, you will be glad you stayed at such an awesome location. 

Thanks, Mona!
"
4660460,28710413,2015-03-29,27393880,Tracy,The studio was very comfortable and much closer to downtown than it looked on the map. It was so nice to be able to have our dogs with us on vacation too.
4660460,29291867,2015-04-06,23072441,Sean,"Mona made the apartment a brilliant place to have to come back after a day out exploring. It's bright and very tidy, nicely decorated. The description is very accurate, it's a cozy little suite! The neighbourhood was lovely, made incredible by this time of spring, it's a very friendly spot. The surrounding area up just one block is full of restaurants and cafes that were top-notch. We knew about these things thanks to a helpful map that Mona left us. In addition to her attention to tidiness and decoration, this map, combined with a bunch of cute little surprises like books on Seattle, playing cards, and lovely beverages made this experience over the top for us. Basically, you're completely setup to have everything you could want. Mona is there if you need her upstairs, but she gives you complete privacy as if it's your own place. Oh, and the bed is delightfully comfortable!

Simply put, I highly recommend this spot, made our stay awesome and easy."
4660460,29746883,2015-04-12,17313239,Phil,Mona and Weston were great hosts. The studio has ample space for two people and is appointed nicely with everything needed for a short stay in Seattle. Located in a quiet part of town with easy access to most of the city. Highly recommended.
4660460,29957915,2015-04-14,8348601,Claire,Great quiet place to stay. Close to the city and nice neighbourhood. 
4660460,30382988,2015-04-21,27440379,Melissa,"The apartment was a great size for 2 people. It was close to restaurants and the water which made for scenic walks. Also, only a few minute drive to downtown/market area. Parking was difficult at times but we always found a spot relatively close. We had a great time."
4660460,31106424,2015-05-02,28928800,Rafal,"We had a great time at Mona's place. Both she and her fiancé are very friendly and helpful and I will highly recommend their apartment for anyone visiting Seattle and looking for a nice, not over-priced accommodation. 

Eeastlake is a very peaceful district, easily accessible from any direction and very well connected with the city center or northern parts of Seattle (public transport in Seattle works really well).

Do not hesitate and book Cozy Eastlake Studio Apartment!"
4660460,31531194,2015-05-06,11123388,Dana,"Mona's basement flat was perfect for my two day stay with my boyfriend. We were on a bike tour and she was super accommodating, she actually let us change the dates we were staying and put our bikes inside. The flat was a very cool yet simple space and the neighborhood where she lives feels very safe and has several good restaurants, etc. What a great intro to Seattle!"
4660460,31940671,2015-05-12,27675412,Lindsay,"We absolutely LOVED staying at this studio. Eastlake is a great area with lots of restaurants within walking distance. Mona was very kind and a great host who was always accessable. The apartment was clean, spacious, and had an amazing bed. There was even a cute little sitting area set up outside just for renters with a great view of the bridge, very pretty at night! We would stay here again without a doubt!"
4660460,32404313,2015-05-17,1568371,Sarah,"Cute apartment in great neighborhood. It was my first time to Seattle and Mona made the stay very easy. The apartment is a good sized studio - very comfortable for two, with a full kitchen to boot! Mona even left cute soaps and coffee for guests.

The apartment is 1.5 blocks to the 71 and 66 (and other) buses, which made getting to many places very easy. It's also only two blocks from Lake Union (which you can see from the apartment!) which is a nice walk. There are some good restaurants and bars in Eastlake. I definitely recommend as a good place to stay."
4660460,32747705,2015-05-21,27582324,Allie,"This is a super cute little apartment in a great neighborhood. Even though we had a rental car, we walked/biked everywhere. We had an easy time parking on the street with the parking permit. The place is small, but more than enough space for two people. Very quiet and clean with nice views from the private patio. We didn't have much interaction with Mona, but she was very kind and accommodating. She also left us chocolate and drinks, which was so nice! We had a great two nights and I would highly recommend this place. "
4660460,33088702,2015-05-25,3807472,Emmy,"Mona's place was absolutely perfect for our long weekend in Seattle! My husband and I were visiting the city for the first time, and we very much appreciated the apartment's central location and proximity to downtown. If you're just interested in hanging around the neighborhood, Mona's place is just around the corner from several bars and restaurants. 

The apartment itself was exactly as pictured, and very cozy, clean, and stylish. It's outfitted with kitchen essentials and some extra toiletries, and we were provided with a guest parking pass for the rental car, which made parking very easy. There was also a lovely private patio for us to watch the sunset from. 

Overall, Mona's was such a great, cozy, and efficient place to stay, and I highly recommend it! "
4660460,33428526,2015-05-28,575727,Claire,Wonderfully adorable neighborhood. Simple and stylish furnishings. Very clean and comfortable. Loved the private alley entrance and the sunny patio. 
4660460,34073690,2015-06-04,17796322,Feibi,"Mona's place was quaint and accommodating, and just right for me and my boyfriend's three night stay in Seattle. The neighborhood is ideal for getting to hot spot places in the city -- nothing more than a 10-15 min drive. Mona gave us our space and the Apple TV in the apartment was on par. "
4660460,34312738,2015-06-07,11105127,Keizha,"Me and my boyfriend enjoyed our 3-night stay in Mona's apartment! It's definitely a cozy and clean place for 2 people with an Apple TV for us to use. Mona provided a parking pass, so parking was a breeze. Staying in Eastlake is a convenient 10-15 minute to every else that we visited. She was very helpful and responded quick to any questions I had. I recommend this place to any one who's visiting Seattle. Thanks again Mona!"
4660460,34964169,2015-06-14,316952,Emy,"We loved the location of Mona's place. We walked everywhere from there: Fremont, South Lake, North Lake, DT, Capitol Hill... etc. The place is perfect for two people, nice, clean, and colorful. Mona's book selection is great too... you get to learn about Seattle's history and see how the City looked before and the way it looks now. Mona provided us with a parking pass so we had no issues with parking. Eastlake is a nice area with plenty of choices to eat and drink. We went to Pazzo's, the Zoo Tavern, and Eastlake Bar & Grill - all very close. Before I forget, there is a nice outdoor seating area with nice Lake Union views... we enjoyed breakfast a couple of times taking in the breeze and gorgeous views... Thanks Mona for the hospitality. I would certainly reach out to you next time I visit Seattle."
4660460,35322072,2015-06-17,2686926,Rachael,We loved this space! Very private efficiency style room with everything we needed. Great location and a great host. Would definitely stay here again. 
4660460,35662130,2015-06-21,10651438,Alicia,"Very nice location, accurate description of apartment. Mona was very accommodating when we had to change the dates of our stay, and made the place available when we arrived quite late the first night. Cute apartment, tasteful decoration - perfect for our needs. We never actually met Mona in person but she was always available via sms. Parking was fine and it's great that she makes the parking pass available."
4660460,36192949,2015-06-26,32270486,Chanse,"Mona was the perfect host for our visit to Seattle. Located just about two blocks from Lake Union and the famous houseboats of Seattle, the space was also in the ideal location. One exit from all the Downtown touristy stuff but still get the authentic Seattle experience. The patio overlooking the lake was amazing and the room was perfect for our family. Mona left us some really nice homemade soap and some local craft beers. The Apple TV and the internet were super fast. Couldn't have asked for a better host while in Seattle! "
4660460,36361363,2015-06-28,27111827,Mary,The apartment was perfect! Great location and easy to find. It was stocked with everything you would need to cook (which we did to save money) and make your coffee with a French press. Total bonus points for that! Mona was very gracious and provided us with everything we needed. She is very sweet and spunky. I will definitely rent from her again! Wonderful place and experience. Thank you. 
4660460,37291926,2015-07-06,7984927,Julie,"We had the best time! The apartment was very clean and comfortable, and it had everything we needed (plus more). The neighborhood was lovely - very close to the lake (absolutely beautiful views), a small market, and yummy restaurants. It's a great location wherever you're headed in Seattle. We used Uber to get around mostly - $8-10 one way to downtown, picked up within a few minutes. We also used the shared public bikes one day. There's a pick-up/drop-off site for the bikes just a few blocks away from this apartment, and it was only $10 (bike+helmet) for 24 hours of use. 

We arrived early and left late - everyone's favorite type of guests. : / BUT Mona was very accessible and accomodating before and during our stay. We highly recommend staying here!"
4660460,37694759,2015-07-09,18166966,Colin,"Mona was great, the setup was fantastic, and the location was perfect for exploring the rest of the beautiful city. The porch was a nice place for us to sit and hang out as well. Would recommend. "
4660460,37832694,2015-07-11,1939563,Anna,Mona was a great host. Very communicative and flexible about our check-in time. The apartment had just what we needed and wanted for our short stay.
4660460,39485585,2015-07-24,26976636,Kirk,"The perfect space for our seattle getaway. Extremely clean and provided the necessities to feel welcome and at home. Easily accessible to everywhere we wanted to go, great for tourists. Hosts were open to anything we had questions about. I would stay again in a heartbeat. Thank you Mona!"
4660460,40733097,2015-08-02,15587619,Mona,"Mona was super chill and her place had everything you needed, plus it was in a great location! "
4660460,42820421,2015-08-16,6217857,Cassandra,This cozy Eastlake studio was great!  Super cozy and close in to everything.  Loved having a kitchen and bathroom to ourselves.  It was a great place for a weekend away.
4660460,43218626,2015-08-18,675365,Shannan,Our cozy stay in Eastlake was perfect. We easily got around the city visiting all the fun neighborhoods. Our host was sweet and informative recommending the perfect day trip on our last day. The apartment was clean and comfy and exactly what we expected. A bonus was the little deck outside with the lake view! Thank you Mona and Luis 
4660460,49633476,2015-10-05,24047905,Sarah,"Great location. Easy to communicate with Mona. Simple, clean space that is perfect for two people. The location is close to downtown, and very walkable to dinner, coffee shops, markets, and the water. It was a great spot!"
4660460,50291152,2015-10-11,3532286,Rene,"We spent a long weekend visiting Seattle. Overall, we had a pleasant time staying here. 

Space: Bed is soft and comfy, room has a large TV. We didn’t have any issues with getting hot/cold, but the hosts left us a space heater just in case. There is also a small desk area if you needed to sit and work on anything. Small kitchen with a stove, small fridge and a few pots and pans. Good water pressure in the shower. 

Hosts: We actually never saw our hosts while we were there- the entrance is separate from the main residence so there isn’t much overlap. Overall, the room felt very private and we didn’t hear too much noise from upstairs.  
 
Location: Eastlake seems really nice. Quiet, centrally located, near public transit, close to Lake Union. There are a couple of cute restaurants and coffee shops within a 2 block radius, and the area seems pretty safe without being overly snooty. We mostly rode the bus (which picks up about a block away) or took Uber while we were there, but we also walked to the Seattle Center from the house and it only took about 40 minutes on foot. 

Overall impressions: Good value, nice location. We would stay there again. 
"
4660460,51288614,2015-10-19,29449570,Sandra,"Mona accommodated an early check in and when asked about public transportation recommended Uber which worked very well
This property is not for older people. Pavers to entrance are dangerous, bed can only be accessed from one side, cooking is problamatic due to smoke detector going off with minimal use. 
Street parking at a premium. Once parked we took Uber rides.

"
4660460,51931815,2015-10-25,44809885,Michael,My girlfriend and I stayed here for three nights. We never got a chance to meet Mona but she made checking in very simple. We loved the coziness of the studio and the location is great! Being able to walk to the local restaurants was a huge plus since we didn't have a car. And the food was great! Would definitely stay here again if we ever found ourselves back in Seattle! 
4660460,53267336,2015-11-07,32935302,Michael,"I really enjoyed my stay.  Although I didn't get a chance to meet Mona, she made it very easy to get into the unit.  It had all the amenities I needed for the week; comfy bed, hot water, kitchen, TV, and a parking pass.  The neighborhood is quiet with many nice restaurants within a short walk from the apartment."
4660460,53994690,2015-11-15,46116056,Kirin,"We loved staying at Mona's place because it was private, quiet, attractive, and super easy to check in/out and to get around Seattle (Eastlake is very centrally located and the bus stop is a couple blocks away). We never met Mona because she and her husband were in Germany, but they were easy to get in touch with via text message when we couldn't figure out how to operate the Apple TV at first, and they made it very clear that they didn't mind being contacted. Very nice, easy going, and responsive people. The bed was super comfortable, the space heater kept us warm, and overall, the apartment is cozy and perfect for a Seattle home base for a long weekend. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Mona! "
4660460,54985579,2015-11-27,6672575,Chelsea,"Mona made it very easy for us to check in and check out. She was very responsive throughout our stay. The apartment was exactly as I imagined from the listing. The location is great, very central making it easy to travel around the city. Parking is on the street and we never had a problem finding a spot. Shower water pressure was great and there was always enough hot water for the two of us. We did not end up using the kitchen, but it seemed to have the basics. 
It was a very cold week in November which caused the apartment to be unbearably cold. My guess is the space is lacking adequate insulation. Mona did everything she could to make us more comfortable by buying a new space heater and providing extra blankets. It still did not make it comfortable enough to hang out in without being in bed under two down comforters. I would definitely recommend Mona's apartment for any other time of the year. I will consider it myself!"
4660460,55432087,2015-12-01,477450,Clara,"Great location and Mona was really cool about letting us have our dog there! Mona was also understanding about our late check-in and check-out - thanks, Mona! The one caveat is, as someone else said, it's not a good place for anyone who is elderly or injured in any way; the walkway down to the apartment can be tricky especially in the dark. "
4660460,56051778,2015-12-08,8957205,Marinca,"Despite the December rain, I had a wonderful time in this lovely apartment. Mona gave me a warm welcome, complete with very handy map of the immediate area, and I was able to settle in very quickly. The place is cosy and absolutely spotless, with everything I needed to hand. I cooked some nice meals in the kitchen and made many, many cups of tea. Capitol Hill is within easy walking distance, and on the one sunny day I was able to take beautiful pictures there and in Eastlake itself. I heartily recommend the apartment!"
4660460,56499954,2015-12-14,12269563,Erik,"Mona was such a generous host, and thank you for being so responsive and accommodating with our car troubles!

Very comfortable and inviting to stay in this room, even on the greyest and wettest days of Seattle winters. Morning tea while overlooking Lake Union from the comfort of the room was such a treat! An excellent home base for further adventure in the city, with some great options for breakfast and evening drinks just around the corner. "
6925807,41677817,2015-08-08,39473129,Tom,"My partner and I were in Seattle for a week on business (and squeezing in a little pleasure!), the home was as advertised; cozy, light filled and large.  Our Host - Adrienne - was a delight and made sure all of our needs were taken care of - she even offered to shop for us!  My teenage son and his friend stay with us and they had plenty of room to make themselves at home and relax.  The neighborhood was very quiet and quaint.  Nearby restaurants and shopping, the heart of Seattle just a short drive away, and beautiful Lake Washington beaches just blocks away!  The king bed in the master room was very comfortable and everything was clean and well appointed.  Adrienne checked in with us every day to see if we needed anything.  We felt very cared for look forward to staying again on future trips!  "
3494608,15659422,2014-07-13,10133372,Nathanael,"Very positive stay here. Everything in the apartment was new from the floors to kitchen utensils. Very spacious and well stocked. 

Check-in/check-out were easy and convenient. 

Easy access with private parking and private entrance. 

Overall, a great experience that I'd highly recommend. "
3494608,16038783,2014-07-20,17917802,Nicole,"I stayed for a week at Anne's for a local workshop and it was truly fantastic. This is a full apartment that was cleaner than many hotels where I have stayed. There's a full kitchen (with dishes,pots,pan, etc) which was nice, as I didn't have to eat out for every meal. I would gladly stay again if I needed to be in the neighborhood. "
3494608,16496716,2014-07-28,3853737,Fidel,"Benjamin and Anne were really attentive to detail to make our stay as comfortable as possible. They were very communicative both before and during the stay, replying in minutes to my messages. The apartment was really clean, with plenty of towels, body wash, shampoo and conditioner for the three of us. The second bed is a sofa bed, but it was better than many real beds I had the displeasure to sleep in.

Location for the apartment is good, in a quiet neighborhood just a few minutes away from a university campus and a street full of cheap and nice restaurants and bars. There are several buses that go to downtown in 25 minutes. They are very punctual and dependable in our experience.

I would definitely stay again if I were back in Seattle."
3494608,18142995,2014-08-22,97353,Amanda And Brian,"Anne's space was great.  First, Anne and her partner were very flexible with our travel plans, meeting us at 1130 to show us the space (which is in the basement of their home).  And the apartment itself was extremely clean, orderly and  we'll furnished. And Seattle has a great transit system (primarily buses) and you can get most places from withing 5 blocks of the apartment."
3494608,18350179,2014-08-25,19471936,Calvin,"Great place!  There are some restaurants nearby that are walking distance and it’s a short drive to downtown Seattle.  The place was very clean and private, even though it’s a basement apartment it has a separate entrance and there was off street parking.  There were clean towels, extra blankets, coffee K cups and guides to Seattle waiting for us.  Anne was easy to coordinate with for check in, she met us to give us the keys.  I highly recommend staying here if you are visiting Seattle."
3494608,18633117,2014-08-29,5742418,Darrell,"communication with the host was very good.  The accommodations were very clean, very spacious and appeared new.  The location was convenient."
3494608,18808317,2014-09-01,1870669,Paulette,"The apartment was as described - super clean and in order, perfect for us and our baby (our travel crib fit nicely into the walk-in closet for nap times). Kitchen was handily stocked. Wi-fi signal was spotty at times, and since it's in the basement we also didn't get good phone signals. But, Anne was responsive and I think we eventually got onto a stronger signal so all was OK. Recommend!"
3494608,19706972,2014-09-16,21054590,Tianna,"Anne's basement apartment is clean, comfortable and a place I would come back to again. It was accurately described and made our stay in Seattle enjoyable."
3494608,21383802,2014-10-16,20916635,Cindy,"Anne and Ben were good hosts. They responded promptly to concerns. Their apartment was exactly as listed with some additional amenities. There was an ample supply of coffee/tea, towels, and cleaning supplies. There was a full sized refrigerator & full kitchen which made it very nice for my stay which was almost 3 weeks. I could hear some noise from the house but not more than if it were a hotel or a normal apartment. I appreciated that I could use the recycling/compost bins, a feature that is not available if I stayed in a hotel. 

The parking space was well lighted & felt safe. Their location had both good access to the freeway and was easily walk-able to the U-District."
3494608,27216381,2015-02-28,27163019,Robin,"Anne was a fantastic host!  I stayed in the apartment for a little over a month while my premature twins were in the NICU, and she was very attentive to my needs as a guest.  If she didn't hear from me for a while, she would check in to see if I or the apartment needed anything.  My plans changed a few times, and Anne was very patient and kind about it.  I even locked my key in the apartment one day, and Anne's husband Ben let me back in without any fuss (they really are the sweetest people!).  The house is 100 years old, so it sort of amplified the sound of footsteps from upstairs, but it wasn't any louder than what you'd hear in an apartment building.  You can't control the heat in the apartment, but the temperature was always comfortable anyway.  The location is great, just a block from freeway access and a short walk from the stores and shops in the University District.  Highly recommended!  If I ever need to stay in Seattle again, Anne's apartment will be the first place I check for availability."
3494608,28906974,2015-03-31,8852424,Ben,"Anne's basement apartment was great and fit our needs perfectly. The apartment is very clean and quiet and it was great to have a full kitchen and fridge available for use. The location was perfect - close to buses so you can get around the city easily. There's also plenty to do within walking distance in the U District and Wallingford just across I-5. If you are there with a car, there's a parking spot behind the house and plentiful street parking very close. While we appreciated the snacks and coffee that were available, we came with plenty of our own. I am hopefully relocating to Seattle soon and if I need an apartment again in the meantime, Anne's will be my first first choice. It will also be my recommendation for friends or family visiting the area!"
3494608,29700744,2015-04-11,29539373,Jeroen,"My wife and I stayed here with our 22-month old toddler for 10 days while transitioning to our new home in Seattle. This apartment was exactly what we needed. The place was very clean, quiet and private. It was more spacious than we expected and everything was very comfortable with a fully equipped kitchen and everything we possibly needed. Anne and Ben were great hosts and we appreciated the snacks and coffee. It was convenient to be able to park off-street and right next to the entrance and access to both downtown busses (bus 66) and the freeway (I-5) couldn't be better. Highly recommended if you need to stay for a longer period and if you want easy access to downtown or the freeway. Thanks Anne and Ben for letting us stay at your home!"
3494608,30894123,2015-04-28,30876412,Jana,Anne and Ben were very helpful and accommodating. Thank you!
3494608,35470945,2015-06-19,18634846,Torkel Gissel,"We really enjoyede the stay, the flat was very large, well equipped and super close ( 15 mins walk) to the University of Washington  where I was participating in a symposium. Anne and Ben were very helpfull so it was so nice to stay in their nice home."
3494608,40457019,2015-07-31,14413245,Patricia,"The apartment was very clean and being a basement apartment was very cool for the hot weather we had.  The location was perfect for my husband to walk to UW and the parking for our car was very convenient.  Anne was very quick to respond to our few questions. 
I did find the kitchen to have the basic utensils for cooking but very minimalistic.  The sofa/futon I found to be  uncomfortable to sit on for very long.  Overall  I felt is was very accurate to the airbnb's description but a bit overpriced.  "
3494608,41791879,2015-08-09,19267795,Amit,"Anne provided us with an excellent stay. The house was very clean, great location, and she was easy to get a hold of. I would come back here in a heart beat!"
3494608,54868131,2015-11-25,13955972,Barbara,"The apartment was really nice, clean, spacious and well equipped. It took me only 10 minutes by bike to get to the University of Washington and Anne and Ben were great hosts, they respected my privacy and were very kind and helpful throughout my whole stay. Overall, I truly enjoyed the time spent here!"
9118240,57477433,2015-12-26,15642583,Ronny,"My wife and I spent 3 days at the “Sweeping Views, Fabulous Apartment”.
The apartment is indeed great – it is comfortable and clean and by and large has everything one needs for staying few days in a place.
The view is breathtaking – you see the whole Seattle skyline and the space needle through the large window in the living room/dining area.
The location in Queen Anne is very convenient – minutes of driving/bus from city center/downtown, and it has some nice restaurants and shopping places in the neighborhood itself.

For us the location was indeed great since we visited family who lives in that area. 
We did not meet James as he was travelling while we were there, but everything was perfectly prepared for us and accurately written to us ahead of time, and he was available by email and responded very promptly to questions before and during our stay.
All in all – we greatly enjoyed our stay.
"
8340841,49256818,2015-10-02,699829,Sylvia,"This is a lovely apartment in a very nice building. The host is wonderful, really nice and easy to interact with. The location is short walk from Broadway or 15th on Capitol Hill, also very close to Volunteer Park. The pictures describe the place very well, in addition to that, there is a private balcony. This is a great place and we have extended our stay quite a bit because we like it so much here. "

8340841,54446998,2015-11-20,699829,Sylvia,"This is my final review. My husband and I have stayed at Dick's apartment for a total of two months and in the process have extended our booking several times. That alone should give you an idea of how much we liked it. 

Host: Dick is a great host. Very nice person. Takes care of things immediately when there is an issue. Quick to respond to questions and booking requests. 

Apartment: Very lovely 1-bedroom apartment. Apartment is beautifully decorated and well-equipped with all you might expect. It has a private balcony and an awesome view. 

Location: In one of the nicest Seattle neighborhoods. Quiet street. Short walk from Broadway or 15th Ave on Capitol Hill with all the stores, coffee shops etc. Only a few blocks from Volunteer Park. Easy access to I5. 

Excellent place to stay. We plan to be back.

6514446,41080869,2015-08-04,8633009,Emily,"Had a great 28 night stay in Seattle with Andre and Joel.  The unit was as described, lovely renovation, great neighborhood, convenient to everything.  They were quick to respond to any and all questions and requests and did everything they could to make my stay as pleasant and comfortable as possible.  Would definitely rent from them again next time I'm in Seattle."
6514446,41761959,2015-08-09,10173263,Stanislav,"The listing was very cozy and central, just 5 minutes away from the monorail. The apartment is very classy and we had a blast staying here. Everything seemed just a short walk away, like pike place market, which was only 15 min away. There was a slight hiccup on arrival but one quick call cleared it right up and there were no issues for the rest of our stay. "
6514446,42266301,2015-08-12,18877937,Tom,Apt was just as promised -- well maintained and centrally located. Tons of gear restaurants in the area. Very organized and responsive hosts. 
6514446,43053052,2015-08-17,5120637,Patrick,Very helpful and easy to get in touch with if I needed anything. Space was great - idea location and exactly as the photos show.

Joel was very responsive to our questions before getting there and made it very easy for us to store our luggage before checkin as we were in town quite early. great experience... thanks Joel."
6514446,47430866,2015-09-18,878370,Anders,Good spot. Nice bed. Good location. 
6514446,47699795,2015-09-21,25440247,Ken,"The condo was charming, modern, and welcoming.  It's located in a great neighborhood and is close to a small grocery (just around the corner) and the massive Starbucks Rostery - which is a must see.  Additionally, the area has great places to eat and has parks as well.  I've love to spend more time there!  Communication was responsive, accurate, and detailed.  Everything was smooth sailing."
6514446,48272882,2015-09-25,36863084,Camille,"This was our first non-hotel travel experience. Joel and Andre's place was great! Everything was immaculate and comfortable. They even had a few nice extras like coffee and half-and-half in the fridge! We were within walking distance of most of the downtown destinations we'd planned, so it all worked out really well. The only issue of any kind that we had was getting settled in our parking spot that we'd reserved (not the fault of Andre or Joel) and adjusting to minor things missing here but found in a hotel like Kleenex in the bathroom or a TV by the bed (it's in the living area). Clearly those were easy adjustments to make on our part. Great place to stay!"
6514446,48577773,2015-09-27,43256542,Deirdre,"We had a nice stay at the ""Zen Retreat"" in Seattle! We had a car and found that there was a good amount of parking available on the street near the apartment (free after 8pm) and were able to get around very easily to everywhere we wanted to go. "

6514446,50002052,2015-10-08,43621059,Abraham,"My wife and I searched for hotel rooms to stay at while visiting Seattle. To our dismay, everything that was reputable costs an arm and a leg. I finally decided to search on air bnb and found this amazing place for a fraction of the price. Located on Capitol Hill, it's centrally located and easy to get around the city. The residence is in a secure building and extremely pleasant to stay in. Everything about the place was well beyond our expectations and I couldn't have asked for a better place to reside for a few days! Highly recommend and I know exactly where I'll be staying again when I come back!"
6514446,50235057,2015-10-10,4863242,Rodney,"The host was excellent with all communication and information regarding the apartment.  The booking process was smooth and pain free and the host was very helpful with all questions and concerns.  The apartment was easy to find and everything on the website is accurate.  The apartment was lovely and decorated nicely.  The wifi worked well and the bed was comfortable.   

The only only thing that I feel I have to comment on was the fact we could smell cigarette smoke in the entrance to the apartment and the bedroom.   I contacted the host and they were very helpful once again and offered suggestions, which did help a little.  Apparently the smoke was coming through the vents.

Everything else about the apartment was nice though."
6514446,51911278,2015-10-25,43418873,Mary,The apartment was nice and in a good location.  Joel and Andre were both super helpful when we had questions or concerns during our stay. Highly recommended!

7701014,47485246,2015-09-19,30304081,Lawrence,"Our stay in Seattle with Ben and Kaitlyn was terrific. The bedroom and bath were spotless, comfortable and quiet. The living space which they shared was cheerful and spacious with a view also. We even shared dinner one night, an added bonus.  

P.O.T.U.S the cat is awesome.

The location is good. The Wallingford neighborhood, our favorite, is a ten minute walk. Green Park maybe fifteen. Fremont the same. Buses to the city are five minutes away. Take the E Rapid Ride to 46th Street and Aurora (Route 99). Driving? There is on street parking.

All in all we highly recommend this place and these people. Many thanks to them."
7701014,50962155,2015-10-16,45462105,Naoki,"1. ホストに歓迎されていると感じたところ
Kaitlynさん夫婦はとてもナイスでフレンドリーでした。英語の苦手な私にも親切に笑顔で対応していただきました。初日に一緒に夕飯を食べてカクテルを作っていただいたり、ピザを一緒に作らせていただいたり、良い経験をできました。朝食はシリアルとコーヒーを毎日ご馳走していただき、とてもありがたく思っています。風邪を途中で引いてしまったときは、風邪薬を分けていただきました。これだけでも十分過ぎますが、とにかく猫が可愛い。座っていると近くに寄ってきます。また会いに行きたいです。

2. リスティングの説明について
リスティングを読み直しましたが、なるほど書いてある通りです。家も部屋もとても綺麗で、バス停が近いので、ダウンタウンや他の地区への移動も便利です。洗濯機、乾燥機もあるので、長期滞在にも便利です。

3. エリアの雰囲気について
近隣は静かな住宅街で、ダウンタウンや大学周辺などと比べて安全な地域です。犬の散歩をしている人をよく見かけます。夜に何度か歩きましたが、危険を感じることはありませんでした。

4. 感想
滞在時の経験と比較して、値段はとても割安に感じました。シアトル旅行でホームステイをしてみたい、ホテル以外で良いところに泊まりたい、猫が好き、という人にはとても良いホストです。ただし、猫が嫌いな人には辛いかもしれません。

706385,2764666,2012-10-30,1109929,Jen,"Gillian was a responsive and welcoming hostess from the very first email! The Sky Cabin is absolutely amazing -- impeccably clean, beautifully designed and maintained, and close to coffee shops, restaurants and public transportation. Gillian takes great care to make sure that you have plenty of resources regarding the neighborhood. I can't imagine having a better experience - we will definitely return on our next trip to Seattle. Thank you Gillian!"
706385,2940538,2012-11-22,3652052,Peter,"My parents stayed at Gillian's place and completely loved it. The location is in the Eastlake neighborhood, so coffee and great food options were within walking distance. The bus system intersects the neighborhood and the light rail is close by, so getting to the rest of the city was a breeze. The place itself was fully equipped, was super clean, and setup really nicely. I would definitely recommend to anyone visiting the Seattle area."
706385,3120461,2012-12-19,1371572,Gina,"Had such an AMAZING experience! Gillian's sky cabin had all the amenities from the bathroom to kitchen to living area. Felt like we were  just at home. Quiet neighborhood, great location, great view, very cozy.  Gillian was easy to contact, always responded promptly and  gave wonderful directions. Will definitely stay here when we visit Seattle again. Highly recommend others to stay here. Thanks again Gillian! :)"
706385,3395877,2013-01-22,4634361,Lesley,"My boyfriend and I came up for a long weekend and stayed in the Sky Cabin. The apartment was cozy, quiet and relaxing.  There was so much natural light and the view was quite beautiful of Lake Union and Gasworks Park. In addition, the bed was super comfy and I loved the heated floor in the bathroom. The kitchen was also a great addition and the location made it easy to get everywhere we wanted to go. I would come back here in a snap. Thanks Gillian and Barbara!"
706385,3430502,2013-01-28,2444481,Dylan,"We had a wonderful 3-day stay in the Sky Cabin. It was a warm refuge for a chilly Seattle weekend, helped by a heated tile bathroom floor and cozy spaces. Waking up to the beautiful lake view (which you can see right from bed!) was great. The hosts Gillian and Barbara were gracious and we honestly barely saw them as the unit is very private. Would definitely stay again on my next time in Seattle."
706385,3515909,2013-02-11,147135,Leora & Ron,"As fellow airbnb person that rents, I must say say everything was perfect.
Seattle is my husband and mine old stomping grounds, he be a native and me living there for a long time. We wanted to stay in the city for a change vs staying with friends or in laws.
The flat was clean, the view, great. It was a perfect get away from our kids. It was all what the doctor ordered! Sooo Fun!"
706385,3671290,2013-03-02,775418,Becky,"Loved this place! We stayed for a couple of nights in the Sky Cabin and everything was perfect. We never got to meet Gillian (she was in Hawaii), but she was easy to reach and made sure everything was all set. The apartment itself is awesome, I'd love to live there! It has nice view of Gas Works Park (you can walk there in about 40 minutes). The bed is super comfy and the shower is better than any hotel. Gillian has maps and magazines of Seattle and it's easy to get downtown either by bus or car. Definitely would recommend it to anyone and if I ever need a place to stay in Seattle again, the Sky Cabin is where I'll be!"
706385,3690689,2013-03-04,2623223,Adam,"Although I never got to meet Gillian in person, her mother was available to let us in.  The Sky Cabin was well laid out with all the basic amenities and instructions were posted for anything that might be complicated to operate. The locations was convenient for going around Seattle. Parking was a little challenging, so connect with Gillian on where to park. Overall one of our favorite AirBnB spaces."
706385,3801626,2013-03-16,2633212,Jonah,"Highly recommended! It looks nice in the pictures, but I think it's even better in real life - watching the boats and seaplanes on Lake Union is a lot of fun. The spaces are really thoughtfully laid out and it's a great neighborhood too - lots of places within walking distance and a quick bus ride to downtown."
706385,4225541,2013-04-20,5604530,Katie,"A wonderful stay at the Sky Cabin. Beautiful space, perfect location, and stunning view. Gillian was a great host. Can't wait to return! "
706385,4257784,2013-04-22,5839470,Andrea,"The skycabin was a fantastic place to stay in Seattle - the photos and description on airbnb describe it perfectly. Bright, lots of light, comfortable, spacious, homey, a fully equipped and lovely house suite with fantastic views of Lake Union and Gasworks Park, in a central, hip and quiet neigbourhood. I would recommend the skycabin to anyone venturing to Seattle looking for the above. It exceeded our expectations, it was a very lovely space to stay at.
Gillian was very prompt in responding and helpful and flexible with check-in/check-out during our stay. Highly recommended, five stars!"
706385,4448996,2013-05-06,2781107,Marlon,"Had an amazing time at Gillian's Sky Cabin. Beautiful, comfortable and quiet, with great amenities and sense of details. Great wireless internet, excellent bed and shower, and plenty of space to store our clothing and luggage. The view from the deck is incredible! And Gillian was a great host, easy to work with, even checking up on us when she grew concerned some construction noise had disturbed us (which it hadn't). My girlfriend and I can honestly say that it was a flawless experience. I would love to stay at the Sky Cabin again on my next visit to Seattle. "
706385,4510070,2013-05-09,744535,Erin,"The sky cabin is lovely- beautiful, and it's really easy to deal with Gillian about logistics. I look forward to staying here again. "
706385,4648559,2013-05-18,79696,Leah,"Gillian and her Mother Barbara offer an incredibly well-appointed space in Seattle. The neighborhood is lovely, with some excellent dining options and a serious selection of wines at the local market, all within walking distance. Lake Union is less than 10 minutes to Downtown, Capitol Hill, Fremont, but still removes you from the hustle and provides a calm quiet environment with insane views of the lake all day as the sun and clouds change the colors of the landscape. Gillian and her Mom are available should you need them, but we only crossed paths once after check in. This will be our go-to rental in Seattle and I am already dreaming of a time sometime soon when I can stay for a week in the Sky Cabin, be with my thoughts or work on a project and focus. The calming energy in this space is welcoming and lovely. Thanks again!"
706385,4719160,2013-05-21,1582599,Ana,"Loved this place! Gillian has created a piece of paradise with the Sky Cabin! Everything has been designed to pamper your senses and make you feel at home. I was constantly surprised with the attention to details... and the shower is one of a kind!
Beyond a perfect getaway, this is also a perfect refuge for someone looking to do creative work... quiet, close to nature, lots of natural light, and an uplifting vibe. I can't wait to return!"
706385,4765025,2013-05-24,2895283,Patrick,"I stayed at the Sky Cabin in mid May 2013 and it was fantastic. It has an amazing view of Lake Union and it's location makes it extremely easy to get around town. I also had the pleasure of meeting Gillian's mother who is a wonderful woman. 

The Sky Cabin is clean and superbly decorated. The furniture is comfortable and the deck is great for catching up on reading. I didn't cook anything but there is a kitchen if you wanted to prepare something for yourself. Finally, the three headed shower is something you shouldn't miss. 

I would whole heartedly recommend Gillian to all of my friends and family. "
706385,4833651,2013-05-28,5770399,Lauren,"What an amazing weekend in Seattle! The Sky Cabin was everything we were hoping for and more. It is in a great neighborhood with an amazing view that kept us in the apartment more than we thought we would be! The bed was super cozy and the three headed shower (not to mention heated floors) was a great touch! The place had everything we needed including (but not limited to) cozy blankets, stringed instruments, binoculars and the best feel. This was my partners first apt. rental experience and she doesn't ever want to go to a hotel again! 

Seriously, I want to live here. "
706385,4899500,2013-06-01,181457,Margot,"What a great place to stay in Seattle!! I spent a lot of time just looking out of the window at the activities on Lake Union. We were very comfortable and enjoyed the location of the Sky Cabin. Near to an efficient bus service downtown,  not far from main highways that took us to Boeing and Microsoft visitor centres by car, close to a good choice of restaurants... we particularly enjoyed the lemony prawn linguine at Louisa's on Eastlake. Gillian was attentive and helpful with lots of detailed info about parking (which was easy on a nearby street) and  other local amenities,  and her mum passed on the key and helped us settle in. The apartment was very clean and well equipped for our every need.  A return visit here would be wonderful if only we didn't live so far away! "
706385,5024580,2013-06-08,5524214,Nathan,"This apartment is really a gem. It has a commanding view of Lake Union, and a great central location with easy access to public transportation to downtown Seattle, or the U-district, or just about anywhere else in the area. The apartment is very clean and private, and is really quite breathtaking. The large amount of natural light really provides a warm and uplifting feel, the views are spectacular, the kitchen is good, and the rest of the apartment is well decorated and furnished. Gillian and her mother were both very accommodating hosts as well. The apartment is very charming and I will definitely stay here again the next time I am in Seattle!"
706385,5224761,2013-06-19,3226791,Steve,"The Sky Cabin is a bit of paradise.  It's fully equipped, meticulously kept, and the views are astounding.  Gillian and her Mom are a delight."
706385,5275763,2013-06-22,2026819,Susan,"Gillian Heather is an outstanding host.  Everything I could have possibly wanted had already been thought of by her. Her attention to detail was precise and well thought out.If I needed something which was seldom she was available t immediately to meet my needs. 
The space is self was cleverly laid out with so many neat features.  Crazy cool shower, heated floor awaiting you in the bathroom. Creative touches like the bathroom sink perched on a slab of wood. A subtle spot light spotting the sink also serving as a night light and looking like a piece of sculpture. Super cozy bedding, and comforters everywhere to curl up with and be warm on the cool Seattle evenings.  The kitchen had all the gadgets, staples and tools to make an excellent meal and was efficient and easy. The deck was great to sit on a watch the evening activity on Lake Union right in front of us. Such an excellent stay. For the price point Gillians home far exceeded ALL my expectations. I certainly recommend it to anyone who wants to get a real feel for the very cool neighborhood of Eastlake in Seattle. I was there for a seminar during the day, and my nights were spend exactly as I had intended, feeling at home and enjoying life. Thank you for sharing your amazing space.  I hope to come back for another visit. Best,
Susan
"
706385,5340119,2013-06-25,5706249,Bryan,"This was our first Airbnb experience and it surpassed even our lofty expectations. Gillian was super responsive and patient with us from the first time we contacted her through our arrival and time in Seattle. The place was gorgeous with a great shower, spacious rooms, beautiful balcony view and lots of reading that made us not want to leave the home. Gillian also put together a little list of recommended local places and her comments that helped us get oriented and Tony provided fresh coffee beans roasted at his coffee shop. Would love to stay again!"
706385,5430543,2013-06-30,5943881,Stan,Great host with a beautiful home.  
706385,5529162,2013-07-04,206203,Amanda,"The sky cabin is my new favorite Seattle place. As a frequent guest in Seattle I can say unequivocally you will love the view, central location, good communication from Gillian, and ease of check in and out. The sky cabin has everything you need plus. The shower ...well, loved it. Hope to be back again."
706385,5660011,2013-07-10,6090311,Damon,"Our stay at the Sky Cabin was wonderful!  The location is right on many bus lines, has a beautiful view, and is well stocked with all the little things one may need.  (Even the little things like coasters, umbrellas, a flashlight, and some dvd's for lazy days.)

The shower in the bathroom is amazing!  Two heads, plus a rain fixture, and plenty of water pressure and heat to share a great experience on your own or with another.

This apartment is very airy and filled with light.  This was amazing most of the time.  Every window was operable, so getting the beautiful breeze was not a problem.  It can however get very warm in the summer on sunny days.  This place like most of Seattle has no AC, so coming back from a long day of walking you may find the place at 85 degrees if you left the windows closed as requested.  (It does cool down quick, since all of the windows open.)

Another small note, the bedroom has no darkening shades, so in the summer when the sun goes down at 10 and up at 5, sleeping early or late is difficult."
706385,5752863,2013-07-15,6414014,Katherine,"Our stay at the Sky Cabin was absolutely wonderful. The place is beautiful and cozy, full of light and amazing views - just a lovely place to base a stay in Seattle. Before we arrived Gillian was quick to answer any questions I had, even leaving a small item that I had asked about via email front and center on the dining room table. The local coffee beans were a great touch as well! The parking map was quite helpful, though we never had trouble finding a spot. The location in Eastlake is highly convenient - we were apartment-hunting and our central location made traveling around the city very easy. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Highly recommended!"
706385,5903770,2013-07-22,5522149,Justin,"The Sky Cabin was a great central location for my wife and I to experience Seattle on our honeymoon. The views of Lake Union were wonderful to wake up to each morning and watch the sun set against in the evenings. Gillian was great and very accommodating and her mother Barbara was very nice. If you're looking for a home away from home in Seattle, this is it."
706385,6073290,2013-07-29,6263731,Janet,"Gillian's Sky Cabin is a delight and it's different! Extremely comfortable and a wonderful view of Lake Union and all the activities, seaplanes etc. We used public transport and had no trouble getting downtown. It is also a lovely neighbourhood to have a wander around, and lots of good eateries close by. Gillian has lots of information in the apt. for visitors. We highly recommend it."
706385,6243437,2013-08-05,6483842,Matt,"Great spot, beautiful space and view, nice coffee, restaurants nearby, handy to downtown- as advertised and more. I was a little underwhelmed upon my return to my own humble abode..."
706385,6391318,2013-08-11,6492968,Ellen,"We had a fabulous week in Seattle, thanks in great part to Gillian and her mom, who even smiled when we knocked on her door at midnight after forgetting our key. The place is perfect, very quiet and close to downtown and Seattle Center. We lucked out on the weather, so the deck looking out toward the water was a real plus. We hope to return."
706385,6612809,2013-08-19,6404034,Sally,"We loved staying in the light-filled Sky Cabin.  Gillian and her mother were warm and welcoming, the accommodations were superb.  We enjoyed the airiness of the vaulted ceiling, the comfort of the kitchen, and the fun of the lovely deck.

Everything lived up to our expectations, and exceeded them.  Highly recommended!"
706385,6705199,2013-08-22,5655648,Tina,"Dear Gillian
Thank you so much for sharing your loveley ( and very clean)  place with us. We enjoyed it very much. The  perfect place to stay and a very charming nabour hood. We would love to stay again and Gillian and her mother are so sweet and helpful. Thank you for making our first days in Seattle so great.
Best regards Rene and Tina"
706385,6760217,2013-08-24,7099930,Jessica,"This is a truly amazing space; one of the most beautiful we have ever stayed in. It was an absolute joy to be surrounded by such comfort, art and design. Simply, perfect. We would love to return!"
706385,6933001,2013-08-31,2292866,Kelli,"We stayed at the sky cabin for three nights during our honeymoon. It is awesome and I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to have Seattle at their fingertips while staying in a peaceful, unique, well equipped, and spacious place with a view to die for. The bed was comfortable, the amenities were above and beyond, and the price is a steal. We didn't get to meet Gillian, but her mother greeted us and there are detailed instructions and suggestions that answered every question we thought of. "
706385,7091513,2013-09-06,3794985,Valerie,"The Sky cabin of Gillian is a wonderfull place in Seattle : you have all you need in the cabin,it is very comfortable and very nice, the view of the lake is wonderfull, there is a charming terrasse.  it is near from the city center and foods market. We recommand highly the charming Sky cabin of Gillian."
706385,7248692,2013-09-13,5704596,Simone,"I think someone is on her way of becoming a superhost! Gillian apartment is just wonderful! Full of sunlight, spacious, very well equipped, super clean, the shower is totally amazing, a lot of reading material & infos about Seattle, a good selection of dvds for a night in, the view from the balcony is a dream and the communication was excellent!  
Gillian also put together a little list of recommended places nearby with restaurants (try Louisas for breakfast!!) or where to shop for groceries. The 70 Bus takes you directly downtown so even location- wise Gillians place is just perfect!"
706385,7336446,2013-09-16,8167657,Rebecca,"Gillian's Sky Cabin is a dream. We loved everything from the location to the amenities. If it were possible to marry an inanimate object I'd marry that amazing shower. 
It's close to the lake and wonderful breakfast locations. I also recommend the Zoo Tavern for a late night beer and some shuffleboard. 
Thank you Gillian. We will be back!"
706385,7477480,2013-09-22,1774157,Christy,"We absolutely loved the Sky Cabin - the view, the neighborhood/location...everything!  We were met by the host to be given the keys and the rest of our stay we were left to enjoy this incredible space.  Walking distance to restaurants and grocery stores, the water front and floating houses.  A quick drive to get downtown.  Perfect!"
706385,7653111,2013-09-28,452921,Rebecca,"I loved Gillian's place.  It is the right combination of eclectic and super comfortable.  The view is fantastic and most importantly the bed is really lush.  The apartment is really well appointed with all sorts of amenities you will want: hair dryer, flattening iron, teas, maps of Seattle and tons of books on the same to name a few.  I highly recommend staying.  "
706385,7770509,2013-10-02,3745714,Lisa,"This is a fabulous place to stay in Seattle.  We loved the location, the amenities, and the beauty of this apartment.  Everything has been done to make it comfortable and easy to stay here.  The views of Lake Union are gorgeous, as is the whole neighborhood.  Two bedrooms meant that when my amiable spouse snored,  I could slip into the other room.   Appreciated the beautiful art, interesting books, and many resources relating to Seattle.  Immaculate and inviting, this place could not be better!"
706385,7891177,2013-10-07,390714,Tiffany,"We had a fantastic stay at Gillian's place! The view was amazing, our weather was perfect, and we enjoyed the sunsets from the deck.
The place is very clean, and has all the amenities of home and lots of pictures and art on the walls. A very nice touch.
Our favorite was the heated tile floor in the bathroom, so nice to walk onto on a Fall morning :)
Gillian's mother greeted us with the keys, and was very helpful and sweet. We didn't hear from her the rest of our trip. It's very quiet and secure in the cabin apt.
We will definately stay again, fab location and a million $ view! And free parking...hard to come by in Seattle!
Cheers, Tiffany and Andrew"
706385,7987816,2013-10-11,206203,Amanda,"Was pleased to find the Sky Cabin available again for my Seattle visit. It is clean, comfortable, has a fantastic view and is a great home away from home. Gillian has made all arrangements very easy and provides a plethora of information on places to go and ways to get there. The Sky Cabin has my highest recommendation!"
706385,8089714,2013-10-15,415643,T & E,"Staying in the Sky Cabin was a truly awesome experience. The apartment is very comfortable, spotlessly clean, the view is amazing and the wifi works very well. It is even better in person than it appears in the pictures. Gillian was friendly and prompt in all communication. We hope to be back!"
706385,8337071,2013-10-26,1746686,Dino,"THE MOST AMAZING PLACE ON EASTLAKE! I absolutely loved the place, it was exceptionally clean and well taken care off. Gillian and her parents are so nice i wanted to invite them up for dinner. I couldn't believe the view of Lake Union and Gas works park, the deck is really the perfect place to be. Not to mention waking up to that view and the peaceful surrounding, couldn't have asked for a better situation while i was back visiting Seattle.  The bathroom alone is worth the stay i could have spent my entire trip in that shower. Centrally located and great parking options. I can think of staying anywhere else in Seattle ever again. Thanks sooo much! Go DAWGS! Woof."
706385,8434378,2013-10-30,2316057,Jen,"The Sky Cabin, with its vantage over Lake Washington, and its comfortable chairs by the window, is a cozy and lovely perch. It invites exploration from the chair to the street. What a special place. I will be back!"
706385,8550896,2013-11-04,9564452,David,"My wife and I made one of our better decisions in booking this unique weekend getaway!  The views themselves would have been enough to earn a 5-star rating but there was a lot more to this stay than just a great view.  The location was close enough that we were able to spend an entire day on foot that brought us to REI, Westlake, Pike Place, Seattle Center and the new neighborhood developing in the south lake union area.  Lots of miles walking but it was great.   We picked up fresh items at Pike Place and made it back to the apartment's kitchen to make up a great stir fry.  The 'sky cabin' is really cool...intimate and eclectic.  Great shower, great bath.  Easy, helpful interactions with Gillian and the parking was very convenient.  We hope to be back sooner than later."
706385,8671191,2013-11-11,179314,Sudhir,Quite possibly the best place to stay in Seattle. Love is just radiating through it so bring someone special and release the reigns on your heart. 
706385,8793698,2013-11-18,17740,Rob,"We had a great time in this airy, calm and super-clean place. Bed is fantastically comfortable, bathroom shower and heated floor are luxurious. Everything you need. Gillian is very helpful and informative."
706385,8916922,2013-11-25,7395678,Scott,"Absolutely wonderful. Don't stay anywhere else in Seattle! The space is warm and welcoming, the view is stunning, and as others have noted the bathroom is like a spa. Everything was smooth and easy. We were sad to leave and hope to return soon! "
706385,9021874,2013-12-02,7154177,Gayle,"If you like it, BOOK IT. Great place to stay in Seattle. I have been back and forth for 35 years and LOVED this place. Clean, details all attended to - great space and views. Location is terrific. Gillian is wonderful to do business with and very professional. We will gladly come back and stay again and our friends are interested in it for guests it was so nice! The heated bathroom floor is the PLUS that made us feel like a slice of heaven. Wonderful place to stay."
706385,9074743,2013-12-04,1383208,Dan,"This place has all the elements why I use AirBnB. A unique place with character and charm that you could never get with a hotel. My wife and I were looking for a weekend away from the kids and this was perfect. 

We enjoyed the wonderful view, a quiet space, and a bed you can sink into. The morning light coming into the bedroom was gorgeous. Comfy furniture that was great for reading. The location made it easy to get to all the things we wanted to see like the Arboretum at the UW, Downtown, and the flagship REI store (walking up from the parking garage makes you feel like you are appearing from the forest). And with a quick stop at Whole Foods down the road you don't have to go out in the cold for dinner. I'd highly recommend this place :)"
706385,9169944,2013-12-10,9923508,Karla,"The SKY CABIN was better than we had expected, and we had very high expectations. Gillian didn't miss a beat - she had thought of everything to make our stay more convenient, fun, cozy, special, etc. She is the most thoughtful host I could imagine. The place was magical - perfect amount of space for the two of us. It felt like home. If we return to Seattle, you can bet we'll be staying at SKY CABIN again."
706385,9261982,2013-12-16,10579587,Ben,My wife and I decided to skip the hotel for the last two days of our honeymoon and stay here. It was a great choice. The neighborhood has some interesting restaurants and a great wine store. It's close to everything you would want to see in Seattle. And the apartment and view are both beautiful. You should stay here!
706385,9309423,2013-12-20,206203,Amanda,"The sky cabin is a real treat; great view, comfortable bed, fantastic shower, centrally located. Love staying here. You will too."
706385,9348598,2013-12-23,1475546,Beth,"My husband and I wanted to go on a quick getaway for our 3rd anniversary. The Sky Cabin was perfect! The weather made us even more inclined to stay put for our entire visit, but we wouldn't have needed much convincing otherwise! When my feet hit my cold bathroom floor, I immediately long for the toasty warm floor in the Sky Cabin bathroom. Not to mention, the shower with three heads! The view of Lake Union was just stunning, and perfect right before Christmas with all of the boats lit up at night. I wish I were back there right now, curled up on a comfy chair with a fuzzy blanket and a mug of tea. Thanks, Gillian, for creating such a wonderful, homey, experience. We'll be back, for sure! "
706385,9467565,2013-12-30,10032384,Jason,"Our stay at the Sky Cabin was great! It was very clean and the furnishings made us feel very much at home, much more than any hotel room we have stayed in. It was the type of place we could have just sat around in all day if the weather decided to turn bad. It looked exactly like the pictures!

There are several restaurants within easy walking distance, giving lots of options for nearby food. It was also easy to get downtown to see the sights.

Parking is the only week point, since you have to rely on public parking nearby. We were always able to find a spot near the end of the block, but sometimes we had to circle around a bit to figure out where we could park. All in all that was a small price to pay for a great place to stay!

For anyone who may be concerned about privacy in the bedroom area, there are double doors on the bedroom that can be pulled closed, and there are wood blinds on the bedroom windows which are not there in the photos."
706385,9570059,2014-01-02,6397458,Chan,"This place was just awesome. Location wise, it's just nearby the bus stop where you can go UW or downtown within 20 mins. Also, you can see Union Lake and Gas Works Park right through all windows. 

In terms of a host, even though I checked in late night, her mother kindly stayed awake and help my parties welcome. I really appreciate it! Plus, it seems to me that Gillian knows what makes customers touched. She left every detail on notes you want to know about like parking spots, internet codes, restaurant recommendations, etc.

I am pleased to review the stays. Never forget this first experience of Airbnb. Thanks, Gillian."
706385,9678509,2014-01-05,1113465,Wade,"This place was incredible! The views were amazing and we really enjoyed Eastlake area. Location was ideal for walking to bars, coffee shops and resturants as well as the floating homes on lake union. Gillian had everything ready so the checkout and check-in were seamless. The place was just so unique, definitely made it hard to leave!"
706385,9789919,2014-01-10,206203,Amanda,I am always happy to see Sky Cabin available for my trips to Seattle. Gillian is a great host and the place is a treat. You will certainly enjoy your stay here.
706385,9881831,2014-01-16,11135326,Megan,"Had a wonderful stay here - Eastlake is a great area - we were able to walk to coffee shops and restaurants, and on an off I-5 was super easy.  The place itself is great - wonderful views, very comfortable bed, loved the heated tile floors in the bathroom!  Parking was not at all difficult - always found a spot within a block.  Would absolutely book again."
706385,9913784,2014-01-19,4968288,Bianca,Gillian was an absolutely amazing host! My boyfriend and I stayed 3 nights at her Sky Cabin and it wasn't enough! Her space was better than imagined and had everything you wanted and more! Communication was superb and we cannot wait for our next trip to (email hidden)d our stay at Gillian's Sky Cabin! Thank you Gillian! 
706385,9958141,2014-01-21,4183362,Charles,"The Sky Cabin was simply amazing. Great views and very cozy.

Gillian was also a pleasure as a host. Communication was always quick, and she was very flexible when I asked to store my bags before check-in."
706385,9997119,2014-01-24,206203,Amanda,"When I make my frequent trips to Seattle I look for central location, nice neighborhood, kitchen I can cook in, comfortable bed and a sense of being home. Sky Cabin has all that plus a great view, disco ball, out of this world shower and wonderful, easy going host. You will certainly enjoy your stay here."
706385,10033032,2014-01-27,1299098,Melissa,"I couldn't recommend this gem more highly- the ""sky cabin"" is a little slice of heaven. The view from every corner of the apartment is spectacular and we were totally spoiled by the heated floors in the bathroom and that phenomenal shower. The neighborhood is also fantastic. Gillian provides a comprehensive list of great places to go / things to do nearby- we loved grabbing breakfast around the corner at Louisa's, and the food/atmosphere at Little Water Cantina down to street was wonderful.  Will be dreaming of the sky cabin for days and months to come!!
"
706385,10092114,2014-01-30,8269448,Fiona,"Gillian's Sky Cabin is wonderful.  My husband and I stayed for 3 nights and loved it - fantastic view and beautifully decorated place, and on top of that Gillian's notes and provisions are very thoughtful.  Could not recommend this place more highly, especially if you are looking for a place within walking distance of UW (like we were)."
706385,10175259,2014-02-04,4878590,Andrew,"I've used Airbnb quite a few times over the past two years and Gillian provided the best experience yet. Right from the start she was incredibly responsive and provided all the details we needed. The Sky Cabin itself is a wonderful upstairs apartment with a view of Lake Union, Industrial Park, and the Space Needle. The neighborhood is lovely and makes getting to and from all areas of Seattle simple. "
706385,10219162,2014-02-07,206203,Amanda,"Sky Cabin is a welcome retreat for this weary traveler. Gillian, her parents and the wonderfully unique and comfortable Sky Cabin are my favorite Seattle home away from home. you will enjoy privacy, a great view, central location, and a fully outfitted place to stay. Treat yourself!"

706385,10529417,2014-02-24,10622038,Cecilia,"My husband and I spent a lovely week end at the Sky Cabin.
The place was even better than what we expected. The view is stunning! The area is amazing and very very quiet.
Gillian has equipped the place so well that whatever you think you might need you will find in the house ! 
The furnishing of the place is beautiful, modern and cozy at the same time. We will be back for sure !! And I highly recommend it to anybody who wants to visit Seattle."
706385,10656379,2014-03-02,10334770,Damien,"The sky cabin has all attributes to make a wonderful stay: well placed, great views, large rooms, fully equipped, good restaurants within walking distance, easy access by road to any place in and near seattle. We very much enjoyed our stay, Gillian was very helpful and plenty of guides were available, and we had 5 consecutive days without rain! It's definitely a gem to rent."

706385,10833840,2014-03-10,10534044,Heather,One of the best places I have stayed.  Not only is the place beautiful the host was so considerate.   All the amenities you would receive at the finest hotels she supplied and more.  And the shower is AWESOME! Can't wait to visit Seattle again and her place. 
706385,11012561,2014-03-17,12191041,Chelsea,Gillian's Sky Cabin was perfect! So cozy with perfect views of Lake Union. A girlfriend and I came to Seattle for a weekend getaway and the Sky Cabin was perfectly located for us to hit all the local spots with a short drive. Her space is so comforting - we found it difficult to leave!
706385,11168724,2014-03-24,7008542,Paulina,"My husband and I stayed at the Sky Cabin for a week in March and it was everything we hoped it would be. The apartment was gorgeous, beautifully decorated, well equipped and so comfortable.  I especially appreciated the heated bathroom floor. The view of Lake Union, and on a clear day, the mountains, was simply breathtaking. By far our favourite part of the apartment. It was so nice to watch the kayaks in the mornings and the sea planes in the afternoons, not to mention the gorgeous sunsets. The balcony was also a plus that got full lovely sunshine all afternoon. We also loved the neighbourhood. We could get fresh pastries from Louisa's bakery in the morning, take runs around Lake Union, and enjoy a delicious lunch or dinner out at one of the many delicious restaurants to choose from in the neighbourhood. The apartment was also perfectly situated in relation to downtown Seattle, not too close, but not too far, with buses running regularly that can get you to the centre within 20 minutes. Gillian and her mother were lovely hosts. Gillian was super easy to communicate with and check-in and check-out was smooth and hassle free. We can't wait to find a reason to go back. We would definitely stay here again. I highly recommend the Sky Cabin."
706385,11319660,2014-03-30,11249158,Otávio,"Gillian's Sky Cabin was wonderful. The view was amazing - both awe-inspiring and soothing at all times of the day. The place was incredibly well-kept and very comfortable. Gillian also keeps great coffee! There is something therapeutic about the Sky Cabin. We got to Seattle feeling tired from a long trip and left refreshed and reinvigorated. There are many small touches that add up to form a great experience, such as the heated bathroom floors. Parking was a breeze and always available. The location was also great. Really can't come up with a complaint if I tried. Would look forward to staying there again when in Seattle!"
706385,11422454,2014-04-01,13604511,Shannon (Shep),"Awesome pad, amazing view, quiet neighborhood, everything in the unit was perfect."
706385,11470216,2014-04-04,206203,Amanda,I stay here frequently for my Seattle visits and really enjoy the place and the neighborhood. Gillian is a wonderful host. You can't go wrong with the Sky Cabin!
706385,11569508,2014-04-07,5567392,Colin,"I honestly cannot say enough good things about this rental. Quite, beautiful location. Helpful notes around the unit to eliminate literally any questions we might have had about how things work. Clear, quick communication. Sometimes, pictures make a place seem better then it is. For this rental, the pictures don't do it justice! In fact, we are going to recommend a family friend visiting Seattle in two weeks to stay here if it's available.

In fact the best thing I can say about this rental is that we are already looking forward to staying here again the next time we are in Seattle. Simply terrific!"
706385,11682400,2014-04-12,11875875,Melissa,My boyfriend and I recently stayed in the Sky Cabin and we absolutely loved it!!  Gillian has a hidden gem within the Lake Union area.  The apartment was very clean and spacious.  The views are absolutely breathtaking.  We can't wait to go back!!
706385,11736107,2014-04-14,11172519,Melissa,"What an incredible space.  We had an amazing weekend in April at the Sky Cabin.  The views were fabulous and the picutres are very accurate.  Gillian was wonderful about responding quickly.  In the Sky Cabin, you will find everything you need and then some...from travel coffee mugs to ear plugs to head lamps for reading to Seattle travel guides!  Such a nice change from the standard hotel room! I would stay here again in a heartbeat.  -Melissa"
706385,11963724,2014-04-20,2001455,Diane,"Our experience at the Sky Cabin was wonderful! The views and light were fantastic, space was beautiful and comfortable. Loved the neighborhood! Coffee and fruit was waiting for us after a long day of travel, and the heated bathroom floor was very welcome on tired feet! We did not meet Gillian, but she was available for any questions, and  supplied us with a list of places to go in the area. They were all excellent picks! We hope to return!"
706385,12110484,2014-04-23,9092920,Mary,"There is nothing---nothing---not to like about this very special place!  Gillian was so easy to work with, and responded quickly to everything.  The Sky Cabin is perfectly suited for 2 people; from the beautiful view, the fun, tasteful and eclectic furnishings, to all the little extra and never-overlooked details, this place had it all in spades.  My husband and I are chomping at the bit to get back there and be able to hang out more in that cozy spot,  as we were pretty busy on this last trip, and spent a lot of time out and about in fun Seattle.  We just want to sit out on that incredible balcony and drink in the view.  Sky Cabin is oh-so-lovely!"
706385,13041692,2014-05-18,14382067,Alexandra,"This was the BEST Airbnb experience I've had to date!  I will definitely return, and wish I could have stayed longer.  Not only was the decor incredible, the view AMAZING, and the location perfect, but the amenities and comfort she provided--heated bathroom floor, what??!--dry shampoo (I'd forgotten mine - this saved my coif!), yoga mat, binoculars…obviously these are specific items I gravitated toward, but the list goes on and on.  She was among the most gracious hosts--as was her lovely mother, Barbara!--I've ever encountered.  Kudos to Gillian for facilitating a memorable weekend with my best friend; I couldn't have asked for a better venue."
706385,13151091,2014-05-20,8953810,Eric,"We stayed at Gillian's loft for 2 days. It was a fantastic experience and I highly recommend both the apartment and Gillian to anyone interested in visiting Seattle. We are locals to the Seattle area, and Eastlake is a great neighborhood to spend time in - there's a nice cafe a block away from Gillians, and we absolutely love eating at Pomodoro's (an Italian place right across from the cafe). It's just a charming, quiet neighborhood, and getting into town via bus was easy. In fact, we appreciated being halfway between Fremont/University District and Downtown, so we could head to either equally easily.
From the moment we contacted Gillian about her rental, she was responsive and very friendly. She went above and beyond to get a bottle of champagne and flowers for our arrival, so I could surprise my girlfriend. I would only expect that kind of service from a 5-star place. 
As for the apartment itself - it's very tastefully decorated, has cork laminate floors with some really comfortable rugs, and (on the rare day when it's sunny and beautiful), an absolutely awesome little deck overlooking Lake Union and Gasworks Park. We enjoyed watching the float planes coming and going on the lake, and the kayakers.
The apartment is not overly large, but was more than adequate for us, and has just about everything you would need to stay in for an evening and cook a great meal. 
Gillian has even put a disco ball in there!
My girlfriend loved the little sun/lounge room, that she used for morning yoga, and I loved the two flat screen tv's, which I used to drive her nuts watching bicycle racing.

Much thanks to Gillian and her mother (who lives in the attached house). Yet another fantastic stay with AirBnB, but this one is clearly a standout. As I mentioned, we are Seattle locals, and you aren't going to find a place as nice and full of Northwest Charm in Seattle without donating a limb to funding it."
706385,13402885,2014-05-27,2781107,Marlon,"This was our second visit to the beautiful Sky Cabin. We felt so lucky to be able to come home to such a special place. I encourage anyone visiting Seattle to contact Gillian, she is a gracious and accommodating host. The Sky Cabin has all you could want for a home base while in Seattle. The space is immaculate, and includes: 
1. More than enough space for you to unpack and stow your luggage. 
2. Really nice bathroom w/great shower, plenty of towels and extra toiletries provided.
3. Fast wifi.
4. Fully kitted out kitchen should you want to cook.
5. Special “yoga “ room w/ ballet barre, for stretching or quite zoning out.
6. Lovely deck area.
7. Dining and drinking guides to the city plus transit maps for many of the nearby buses.
8. Comfy bead w/ extra linens.
9. Lots of books and DVD’s, should you stay in. 
10. And a spectacular view of Lake Union!

Gillian leaves a great set of instructions for how to get around the immediate area and should you need help, is easy to communicate with. The Sky Cabin is a true gem, as beautiful as Gillian’s photos show and possibly more. I can’t really imagine staying anywhere else while in Seattle."
706385,13561933,2014-05-31,2242105,Audra,We had a lovely stay. Gillian was super helpful and the view from the cabin is stunning. I highly recommend staying here and enjoyed very much the restaurants and cafés just a few steps away.  
706385,13812434,2014-06-05,12680596,Ainan,Gillian's place was amazing. It was exactly as portrayed in the photos with a breathtaking view of Lake Union. I would recommend this to everyone that is wanting to have an enjoyable vacation with relatively calmer environment. The transportation to reach this place and enjoy Downtown Seattle is also very easy. 
706385,14078072,2014-06-11,4690389,Christine,"Staying here was perfect! Checking in was a breeze, and getting to spend a sunny weekend on the porch looking at Lake Union was quite relaxing. Gillian checked in halfway through my stay to make sure that everything was going well. The apartment was also conveniently located - I could easily walk to restaurants and getting to other central neighborhoods in Seattle only took 10 minutes. I hope to stay here again! "
706385,14597052,2014-06-23,12476639,Aaron,"The photos of the ""Sky Cabin"" and the views from the deck don't do it justice. Extremely comfortable with all the necessary mod-cons (especially the shower!) this apartment was a great place to relax at the end of our long trip and as a base for exploring Seattle. Great communication with Gillian about checking in, and all the extra information needed for a visit as well.

Would very strongly recommend the apartment to anyone thinking of visiting Seattle, and would love to come back."
706385,14784274,2014-06-26,1756628,Rachael,"This is the most incredible location and apartment. The views, the decorations, the warmth. Everything was more than wonderful and Gillian is a responsive and communicative host. "
706385,15027768,2014-07-01,12505821,Jordan,"Couldn't possibly have enjoyed our stay in Seattle any more and the Sky Cabin was everything (and more) my wife and I had hoped it would be. The views were even better than the pictures represented. My wife was worried b/c we didn't rent a car, but the apt. is located within easy walking distance to a number of really good restaurants and no more than a 10-15 minute ride (we used Uber and never paid more than $10 a trip) to downtown. 

I would echo all of the other reviews I read before booking and since having now returned, would revisit the Sky Cabin in a second. Everything about it was fantastic. And as many others have also said, Gillian was more than happy to help and is/was a gracious host. "
706385,15175269,2014-07-04,11042127,Samuel,"Gillian was an attentive, professional host and the sky cabin is absolutely perfect.  If you're visiting Seattle, I can't recommend a better place to stay.    "
706385,15455348,2014-07-09,16109567,Linee,"The sky cabin was spacious yet cozy. The views were exquisite and the atmosphere was beyond comfortable. I appreciated the special touches of extra towels, yoga mat access, ipod dock, and delicious coffee. I would have loved to have enjoyed it for longer. Sincere thanks to Gillian!"
706385,15998632,2014-07-20,7309747,Jessica,"The Sky Cabin is amazing. Staying there made our vacation. The location is great for access into the city or just roaming the East side of lake union. The view is breath taking...nothing better then waking up or falling asleep to that view. 

Gillian has thought of every little detail to make you feel as if you are at home. 

We will be booking the sky cabin again!"
706385,16540037,2014-07-29,4698157,Sylvianne,"The appartment was just amazing! It was really clean and everything was as described in the description. Gillian and her mom were really nice people. 
You have a great view from the app on the lake and downtown is close thanks to the bus just around the corner. 
There are some good breakfast and dining options in the neighbourhood. 

We loved the place! 
"
706385,16651220,2014-07-31,10113170,Teigen,"My wife and I stayed at the Sky Cabin for our honeymoon and absolutely loved our time there. The cabin was immaculate and just as beautiful as the pictures show. Gillian was beyond helpful with great dining and activity recommendations. She provided us with coffee for the weekend and a kitchen fully prepared to cook up a delicious meal. Gillian had outlets, instructions, and directions labeled across the cabin for easy access. My wife and I loved the location of the Sky Cabin as it offered us a 10 minute drive to Downtown Seattle, 5 minutes drive to U District, and an ideal 2 minute walk to beautiful waterfront. We absolutely loved our peaceful stay at Sky Cabin and we will definitely be back!"
706385,16970165,2014-08-05,12592317,Mila,"Appartement très chaleureux et décoré avec beaucoup de goût. Petit mot de bienvenue posé sur la table, avec toutes les indications pratiques nécessaires pour le quartier."
706385,17089877,2014-08-07,13031126,David,"The ""Sky Cabin"" is a wonderful jewel set in a great neighborhood on the East side of Lake Union. Gillian has literally thought everything through to make your stay immensely enjoyable. When we checked in and walked up the stairs the view that met us was tremendous. I didn't think my wife was going to leave the place to go explore Seattle.  She loved this place so much. Gillian left detailed instructions on everything the apartment had to offer down to how to run the hanging mirror ball! The entrance to this place is off of a small alley/road and you have to park a half a block away or so but that never was an issue during our stay. The Lake Union view at night from the bed makes you feel transported to someplace almost tropical. There are cool restaurants and coffee shops you can walk to from this location. You are also a very short drive from Gasworks Park, Fremont Brewing and U-Dub. Gasworks Park has the BEST sunset view of downtown Seattle. If we go back to Seattle we will be disappointed if we can't stay here again."
706385,17203168,2014-08-09,940809,Janet,"My boyfriend and I really enjoyed Gillian's apartment - Sky Cabin.  The apartment is designed with form and function in mind.  The furniture is both comfortable and modern and the space is full of thoughtful details.  There is a reading light, a warm blanket, or a coaster wherever you think one would be.  The lighting is soothing and the view of Lake Union creates an incredibly relaxing experience.  We really enjoyed watching the water recreation in the distance and enjoyed the cool breeze.  Additionally, the shower in this apartment is amazing - three shower heads that all work perfectly.  We made breakfast each morning, sat on the deck and enjoyed the view, and stayed in and watched a movie one of our nights in Seattle.  The neighborhood is very walkable with many fun stops.  We played pool and ski ball at a local bar and had a great time.  A really wonderful experience - the perfect apartment for a fun and peaceful stay in Seattle."
706385,17497693,2014-08-13,13772358,Kyler,"My wife and I spent a few days of our Pacific Northwest honeymoon in the Sky Cabin. It was very easy to get downtown, but the quiet neighborhood was great for relaxing and soaking in the amazing view from the balcony. Gillian has done a great job at thinking about every detail of the apartment. There was nothing we couldn't find or figure out how to use. My wife loved the decorative atmosphere of the Sky Cabin, in particular the yoga room. Gillian communicated with me throughout the process and was a gracious host. If we are ever in Seattle again, we'll be sure to stay here again. "
706385,17674556,2014-08-16,11163919,Jennifer,"The Sky Cabin was perfect for a romantic vacation. The view across Lake Union is beautiful, and the apartment is very well appointed. Gillian was very responsive, and welcomed us with a lovely note and plums from her garden. There is a wonderful breakfast/lunch spot, The 14 Carrot Cafe, within a short walk, as well as other restaurants. I would recommend the Sky Cabin to anyone visiting Seattle. "
706385,17992862,2014-08-20,1207808,Geoff,"The Skycabin is wonderful! Superb views over Lake Union and this lovely city. It has such a homely feel with lovely touches everywhere.
Gillian was great at storing our bags when we arrived early. Easy, cheap, regular bus to downtown so a great position.
Would highly recommend."
706385,18131371,2014-08-22,11475346,Scott,Gillian and her mother were great hosts!  They were very accommodating and it is a truly beautiful place.  I would highly recommend anyone looking for a relaxing and comfortable placein Seattle to stay here.
706385,18400206,2014-08-26,10259095,Si,"Gillian was very communicative prior to arrival so we felt very looked after . te accommodation is amazing with fabulous views and excellent amenities . The location is great for walking to places such as Space Needle , Capitol Hill , and very close to public transport links . Great memories of sitting on the balcony watching the sun set over the distant mountains ,  and the busy water life on Union Lake"
706385,18702482,2014-08-31,11259368,Grant,"Where to start... From the minute we booked Gillian was on top of our reservation and gave us wonderfully detailed advice on Seattle eateries that time and again impressed. Upon arrival the ""Sky Cabin"" more than impressed.  The space is welcoming and very clean. It feels homie and the views of Lake Union area incredible. The living space is Ikea/retro mod and warm wood grain. The bed is firm and warm and the bathroom is more spacious than the pictures give it credit. The 3 head shower has great pressure and is luxurious. I came to Seattle with a wonderful girl and we left with her as my wonderful fiance.  Great place we plan on returning to sometime soon!"
706385,18952501,2014-09-03,17895096,Beth,"Gillian's place is amazing! My husband and I spent two nights there and the place is just as it looks in the pictures. The views are wonderful and the place itself was super cute and clean! The wall of windows and skylights let in a lot of light which was really nice. Gillian had everything you need for your stay (i.e. towels, soap, shampoo, kitchen utensils, blankets, etc.). We felt right at home here. She also left some great recommendations for places to eat. You MUST go to the 14 Carrot Cafe for breakfast! This is an amazing little cafe only a very short walk from Gillian's place. 

My husband and I would definitely recommend this place to others! Thanks again for a wonderful stay!"
706385,19077185,2014-09-06,18332971,Al,"The only thing we're sorry about was being behind schedule the day we left, and not getting to thank Gillian in person. Fantastic apartment, awesome view and easy, clear communication with the host in all the days leading up to our stay. A great overall experience and would definitely stay again."
706385,19205901,2014-09-08,8678805,Mickey,"We had a great weekend in Seattle while staying at Gillian's Sky Cabin. Gillian was away so we didn't get to meet her, but her mom was readily available.  The apartment is just as described and pictured, and has everything one might need or want, including lots of information about the area.  The weather was glorious for our weekend so we headed to the mountains to take advantage of it, and didn't spend much time inside.  We liked being able to walk to restaurants, and on the morning before we left, walked around Lake Union on the Burke-Gilman Trail. I would definitely recommend the Sky Cabin if you're staying in Seattle."
706385,19375983,2014-09-11,206203,Amanda,I am always pleased to find Gillian's Sky Cabin available for my frequent trips to Seattle. It is a comfy home away from home and Gillian is a wonderful host. Great neighborhood and a much better value than a hotel. Treat yourself to the Sky Cabin!
706385,19678126,2014-09-16,18637649,Mary,"We had a wonderful time at the Sky Cabin. The views were beautiful and entertaining with all of the water activity. The apartment was even better than the photo, it feels spacious and cozy. We met with Gillian's mother who was very accommodating. The added bonus of beautiful art and tile work in the apartment made it even more special. We walked to several restaurants near by and also enjoyed some great jazz music. Parking was easy to find near the apartment. We are returning in a few months and highly recommend staying there."
706385,20104206,2014-09-23,20329688,Ashley,"What an amazing place to stay while in Seattle. I spent 7 years living in Seattle and couldn't have asked for a better place to stay while back in town. So easy to get to the University District, Capitol Hill and so easy to take eastlake to get downtown while avoiding all the traffic. Amazing views of the sea planes, rowers and boats with beautiful natural light coming through the sky lights, a little patio to have a glass of wine to end the day and a great fully equipped kitchen so you can stay in if you're not going to the great restaurants nearby and great running routes ending with cappuccinos at the coffee cart up the street. I would definitely go back and have already recommended the place to others and the pictures are exactly what the sky cabin looks like. "
706385,20512252,2014-09-30,9242731,Kyle,This is a beautiful space with a great view and it's got everything you need to feel at home! 
706385,20860524,2014-10-06,2670279,Kelly,"We loved our stay at Gillian's Sky Cabin! Everything was absolutely perfect. We woke up to the gorgeous view of boats and sea planes gliding across Lake Union. Stretched in the heated yoga room while brewing the fresh coffee Gillian left for us. We prepared breakfast in the kitchen and dined out on the balcony patio while watching a crew regatta across the lake. We almost didn't want to explore Seattle at all — just wanted to laze around this beautiful space, reading and watching the water all day. Gillian was the perfect host - texting us upon arrival to ensure we got in okay, and leaving us with plenty of instructions (Wi-Fi, parking, etc.), and a list of great local recommendations. Everything was truly perfect! This was my favorite Airbnb experience this far, which says a lot because we've stayed in some great places. Thank you, Gillian!"
706385,21000895,2014-10-09,206203,Amanda,The Sky Cabin is great. I stay there whenever I can. Great view. Comfortable accommodations.  I highly recommend it.
706385,21297828,2014-10-14,17242889,James,Gillian was wonderful and accommodating. The Sky Cabin was gorgeous and has an incredible view. The neighborhood is quiet with great restaurants within walking distance. It was the perfect first time AirBNB experience. My wife and I were talking about coming back next year before we even left! Excellent experience. Five stars.
706385,21746439,2014-10-23,206203,Amanda,Sky Cabin is a fun and comfortable place to stay. Everything is easy and welcoming. I highly recommend it!
706385,21913614,2014-10-26,22550037,Max,"Gillian was out front when we arrived to check in. She was very helpful and let us know to contact her for anything. The place is better than the pictures and the view is incredible. If you plan to cook, the kitchen is fully stocked and you would have everything you need. Would definitely stay here again."
706385,22325197,2014-11-03,18380020,Adam,"Great Host, great location and great apartment. We stayed there for 3 nights and it was lovely. The place is so comfortable you almost don't want to go outside and explore the city. Everything was as advertised and Gillian made the process very smooth, even for our very late arrival. "
706385,22536712,2014-11-09,18826711,Beverly,"I lived in Seattle a while back and was visiting family on this four day trip.   The apartment is as fine as the photos.  Of course the view is everything spectacular but the amenities are clearly serviced by someone who knows what guests need...movies, brochures, coffee and ear plugs (just in case)!  Everything was lovely.  And the location a dream.  "
706385,22850557,2014-11-16,16543514,Jamie,"I reserved the Sky Cabin for my parents who were visiting from out o town. The unit was wonderful, spacious and had an incredible view. The host had reading materials and brochures/travel books for my parents to review and find activities to do while I was at work. We ended up spending more time just chatting at the Sky Cabin than exploring the city because of the view and the atmosphere. They will definitely stay here again and recommend it to their friends."
706385,23692174,2014-12-08,23156099,Christopher,"Gillian communicated very well with us long before we arrived at her wonderful place. We had detailed directions to the location, where to park etc. Her little cabin is so charming and the view can't be beat. Her kitchen was well stocked with all the pots,pans, forks, knives, etc. for my wife to make a few great meals while we were there. The pricing was very fair and I would recommend anyone looking for a quiet getaway with a great view in Seattle to consider Gillian's place. "
706385,23913272,2014-12-14,12161980,Jayanne,"The listing was accurate. The ""sky cabin"" has an outstanding view of Lake Union. We enjoyed walking along Fairview Avenue, seeing the houseboat communities and then catching the South Lake Union Streetcar to town. There are two small markets close-by and many great restaurants. We liked Serafina and Louisa. The neighborhood felt safe. The sky cabin had a very comfortable bed, wonderful hot water shower and a every convenience you could imagine. We would definitely recommend this Seattle jewel."
706385,24945054,2015-01-04,14212487,Caleb,"Gillian was extremely good at communicating and we had a wonderful time at the Sky Cabin.  It was peaceful, comfortable and had an incredible view of the lake.  One of our favorite things to do was sit in the cozy chairs by the window and watch the sea planes land and take off.

I highly recommend staying at this wonderful listing."
706385,25178395,2015-01-08,5429318,David,This place is beautiful and comfortable and perfectly maintained. 
706385,25419348,2015-01-15,3160016,Eduardo,"Just a word: Awesome! This space cabin have the best lake Union view. Lovely neighborhood and location. The apartment is cozy, warm, instructions of how to use it everywhere, and the welcome letter have a lot of recommendation about the city and the neighborhood. Gillian is a lovely person, very kind and helpful. "
706385,25526170,2015-01-18,4088488,Mari,"Gillian and Barbara were both a pleasure, organized and friendly. Finding the cabin was very easy (based off Gillian's instructions), and the check-in/check-out instructions were very clear. The cabin was beautifully kept and located in such a convenient area - only a couple minutes drive from Capitol Hill. We didn't find an issue with parking at all, either which was great! Even though it was raining all weekend, we still enjoyed the cabin to it's fullest potential - lots of natural light still poured into the cabin making it feel like a true ""cabin in the sky!"", the living area was super cosy with a space heater/faux fireplace, and the bathroom's spacious shower (3 shower heads) and heated floors were a plus! The bed was very comfortable with high-quality linens, and because the area is very quiet - we were able to get an awesome night's rest each night. I would highly recommend this cabin for those that enjoy a relaxing, spacious and getaway feel. 10 out of 10 - a true hit. We will be back! Thanks again."
706385,26045201,2015-02-02,23950618,Joe,"Lovely, lovely, lovely.  Will come back if they will have me.  Convenient to UW and downtown, cozy, comfy, very clean and a lovely view.  Parking is down the street but no big deal.  "
706385,26242344,2015-02-08,33674,Jed,"This must've been the most organized and accommodating Airbnb we've ever stayed in. Gillian was sympathetic to a rescheduling due to a blizzard flight cancellation, and the apartment itself is a great combination of comfort and personality, with lots of light and a great view of the water. I'd highly recommend booking it if it's available!"
706385,26594815,2015-02-16,18985698,Steven Henry,"This is an absolutely fabulous choice for visitors to Seattle.  The view from every room of Lake Union: the houseboats surrounding the lake, Queen Anne Hill, downtown, and the Olympic mountains makes leaving a heartache.  Gillian was great about getting us good directions, making picking up the key simple, and providing coffee and many other amenities in the kitchen and elsewhere.  The extra ""yoga room"" was a nice getaway for my wife when I watched a little TV.  The location is ideal (close to downtown, a great walk around the lake (10KM), and great restaurants).  The balcony was a wonderful, quiet way to relax and take in the views (WOW!).  We would stay again in a heartbeat and recommend it to any couple who isn't planning to stay there when we do.  And thank you, Gillian, for ordering up stunning weather for our mid-February retreat. Comfortable, quiet, and did-I-mention-the View!"
706385,27785703,2015-03-11,7758368,Jake,The Sky Cabin was a fantastic stay.  Beautiful view and great accomodations.  Lots of little items in the apartment that came in handy.  Great location and host was very informative and responsive.   Only very positive things to say about the space and experience - great option for someone wanting to experience Seattle. 
706385,28016735,2015-03-16,8525996,Tulica,"The photos of Sky Cabin are beautiful but don't come close to how great an airbnb place this is! Attention to so many little details made my stay, easy relaxing and so enjoyable. With windows lining the wall facing the water and the space designed so well it was hard for me to leave! Loved my stay, Gillian and Barbara are great, communicative and very respective of privacy. Highly recommend, and will be stealing interior design ideas! "
706385,28233430,2015-03-20,22268362,Allan,"The house was awesome. I liked it a lot. Next time, when I go back to Seattle, it would be only choice. "
706385,28477768,2015-03-24,14641875,Christina,"This may be the most perfect Airbnb I've ever stayed at. Gillian has put a lot of care into making the Sky Cabin cozy and comfortable. I appreciated all of the little touches, like the heated tile in the bathroom, instructions all over the apartment, recyclable bags and an umbrella hanging by the door, etc. The view of Lake Union and Gas Works Park is stunning. The yoga room is really something special. I would absolutely stay here again next time I visit Seattle."
706385,28779488,2015-03-30,5429318,David,The place was terrific again. Loved staying here. 
706385,28975286,2015-04-01,524198,Dan,"Lovely spot! Gillian was friendly and helpful. 
"
706385,29067226,2015-04-03,2033268,Graham,"The place is just like the pictures: very open and airy, with a great view. It's all very cute and homey and a lot of amenities are provided: soap, shampoo, towels, etc (even several musical instruments!). The bed is firm and comfortable. Everything was clean and arranged nicely. It is a quiet neighborhood but there are actually quite a few food/coffee options within a couple blocks. The host asks that you don't make a lot of noise as there are elder residents in the house as well. "
706385,29572975,2015-04-09,6212982,Sam,Fantastic professional and organized host made check in and check out a complete breeze. Beautiful place to stay with great location. Would not hesitate to stay there again. Highly recommended.
706385,29744495,2015-04-12,6314550,Meg,"Absolutely the most perfect Airbnb!!!!!! Gillian was very informative and accommodating. The place is gorgeous, as is the view of Lake Union. There was so much space and the best bathroom ever...the shower was so cool and the floors are heated! It was beautifully decorated and felt like everything you could possibly need was there; including a nice tv, cozy bed, quality blowdryer, straighter, and all Meyers products. "
706385,30380596,2015-04-21,219767,Radcliffe,"Gillian is great! She's a very welcoming host. 
Easy check-in. Her mom downstairs gave us the key. Easy-peasy.
Later, Gillian contacted us to make sure we were comfortable. 
Indeed we were. ""Sky Cabin"" a perfect place to stay in Seattle. The Eastlake neighborhood is close to everything you need. Several bus lines into downtown or to the U-District. And a lot of restaurants and coffee shops in the neighborhood. Would definitely stay here again!"
706385,30606997,2015-04-25,21940105,Louise,We loved this home! The place was beautiful and well equipped. Evenwhen we were spending hours indoors it was such a pleasure to look at the changing sky and water at different times of day and evening. It was easy to cook a special birthdate meal with all the help of supplies.The bed was comfortable and shower luxurious. And the neighborhood was quite convenient with easy walking to cafés and restaurants.
706385,31098966,2015-05-02,27756314,Laurel,This is a beautiful place with amazing views and all the amenities we could ever have needed. It is a must stay if you're coming to the Seattle area. 
706385,31584926,2015-05-07,30152116,Wei,"I absolutely love this house. When I first step upstairs, I was deeply attracted by the beautiful lake view and the decorated house. The interior gives me the warmest welcome of Seattle. So thank you so much for providing such a cozy place, it is awesome!

The suggesting letter is really useful. I tried the first restaurant you recommend on the letter yesterday evening. It's a beautiful restaurant and the food is very tasty, definitely made my day. The tips on the wall are helpful. There are so many details that I didn't noticed can be a mistake, but the sweet tips give me straight direction of how to live comfortably in this house.  

Your house is very very nice. It is actually much better than I expected from the pictures, not to mention living in a hotel like Silver Cloud. Maybe the reason is that you make the house more like a home for me, rather than a inn that I only temporary stay. I have to say I hardly want to leave, and my family members also like the place so much!

Overall, thanks for all your kindness, and I hope that I could have one more chance to view this fantastic scenery once again! To the best memory for living in Seattle!

Sincerely,
Wei Fenh"
706385,32049102,2015-05-13,1157954,Mary,"The Sky Cabin is fantastic and exactly as described - if not better. My husband and I had a wonderful time here enjoying the view and exploring the neighborhood and the rest of Seattle. Gillian was wonderful and very responsive to any questions. Gillian's mom Barbara who met us to give us the key was also lovely. The neighborhood is quiet, but still with plenty to walk to - a couple of bars, a great restaurant, independent coffee shop, and a lovely bakery. We hope to come back again soon!"
706385,32847671,2015-05-22,19193362,Jeremy,"My stay at Gillian's was amazing.  A peaceful escape located in the heart of a major city.  Gillian's communication was excellent.  The home was beautiful, clean, and comfortable.  If I'm back in Seattle, I won't hesitate to book here again."
706385,33069988,2015-05-25,21740626,Elaine,"Gillian was a fantastic host and this listing was simply amazing. Everything was described as is and the details of the space made us feel like home. From the Yoga room, heated bathroom floors, to the little flashlights on the keys, these were just a few of the thoughtful touches that we appreciated. The view of Lake Union was breathtaking and the neighborhood was quiet but with great restaurant selections around. We would love to come and vacay here again soon! Thanks so much Gillian and Barbara!"
706385,34625108,2015-06-10,19241206,Mike,"The Skycabin is lovely and exactly as described! We loved waking up to the beautiful view and the apartment is very clean well decorated and stocked with everything you need. Gillian is very responsive and pleasant to communicate with. We plan to stay here each time we visit.
"
706385,35069427,2015-06-15,26503471,Max,"This place was amazing!

We first arrived and Gillian had left very detailed information in regards to what was in the area and where to go. 

And the apartment was perfect. Tons of natural light and windows. Open spacing. The kitchen was set up perfectly. And the balcony and the view was incredible!! 

5 stars! Gillian was really helpful. I would definitely stay here again if we ever go back to Seattle! Thank you so much!"
706385,35375713,2015-06-18,2813688,Erin,"Loved the sky cabin!  Great little spot to stay.  Loved the house, neighborhood, views, etc."
706385,35634196,2015-06-21,27380067,Andrew,"Gillian was kind and thoughtful throughout our entire experience.  The apartment is perfect, exactly as advertised (even better in person).  It was a large, comfortable space with beautiful attention to detail (and stunning lake views).  Gillian has made the apartment so ""user-friendly,"" with helpful information all over.  I can't recommend this cozy ""sky cabin"" highly enough."
706385,37656607,2015-07-09,33310896,Annette,"Wow! What a great experience! Absolutely everything was amazing and perfect! I can't say enough good things about our stay. Gillian went out of her way and clearly spent a great deal of time making her place comfortable, clean, and feeling like home. Every detail was perfectly thought out and executed. I will definitely stay at her place again!"
706385,38374050,2015-07-15,29722722,Teresa,"This was our first airbnb  excursion. We have to admit that we loved it. We would totally rent Gillian's place again. It was spectacular. She has a lot of incredible touches to make you feel like you are at home yet also on vacation. The view of the lake is amazing  and sunsets are spectacular. Place is clean,  stocked  with all the amenities you would  need and so centrally located. We can't wait to come back again!"
706385,38707929,2015-07-18,29047736,Jillian,The Sky Cabin is AMAZING! Beautiful and comfortable space. So thoughtfully designed and decorated. We can't wait to go back! 
706385,38986516,2015-07-20,29795581,Bobbi,Great accommodations!  Thanks for all the extras!  Appreciate the new air conditioner!
706385,39275449,2015-07-22,12326937,Erin,"Gillian's sky cabin was unbelievably beautiful. We were FLOORED when we first walked in. We couldn't believe a place like this existed! Barbara was also very sweet and helpful getting us inside. 

We would definitely stay here again if the opportunity arose and would encourage any and everyone to experience this little gem! The view is UNMATCHED!"
706385,39538916,2015-07-24,9664447,Chris,"Lovely homing has everything you need.  Clean and inviting.  View to live for. Just absolutely lovely.  Fantastic bathroom and bedroom with a view (and those sheets!  Took a picture of the label so I can get a set).

Thank you for your hospitality and hope to  stay with you again : )"
706385,39980908,2015-07-27,2518902,Sarah,"This place was sweet! Great eye candy inside and out, with mid-century modern furniture and the lake view right there. Gillian and Barbara were super accommodating and responsive with arrival/departure. They've thought of everything, from city guides to q-tips. It made for a very comfortable stay in Seattle and I can't wait to go back."
706385,40315725,2015-07-30,19528446,Chelsie,"The best place to stay in Seattle! Gillian's place was so perfect my husband and I hardly wanted to leave. In fact, two nights we cooked dinner in because the home was so perfect and the views so spectacular we didn't want to be anywhere else. The Sky Cabin has everything you could want/need, is set up so that it's very easy to navigate, the bed is wonderfully comfortable and the entire home is located in the perfect spot. Thank you Gillian & Barbra for a wonderful stay in Seattle!!"
706385,40714578,2015-08-02,29475871,Anna,"Our stay at Gillian and Barbara's was amazing!! I ended up booking the Garden Apartment for me and my now ""Husband!!!"" and booked the sky view apartment for my mother and family for my August 1,st Wedding.  Our stay was perfect!!  It was so nice to wake up and walk to our wedding venue and walk right back up after the wedding.  So relaxing and stress free.  The view was amazing and inside the home was so comfy.  We are looking forward to our next stay there!  "
706385,41727280,2015-08-09,9286836,Samantha,"The Sky Cabin was one of the most welcoming airbnb locations we have ever stayed in.  Gillian did an excellent job of providing us with everything we needed.  From bags of coffee beans from a local coffee shop (Java Bean) to eye makeup remover pads in the bathroom ( I ran out, so I was very pleased by this).  We wanted to live here.  The view of Lake Union was spectacular.  The pictures do not do the Sky Cabin justice.  This place was supremely cozy.  We loved the location, and had dinner at two places just around the corner from our location.  We highly recommend Serafina for a nice Italian dinner and Louisa's for a tasty breakfast (both places were on a list Gillian laid out for us).  Gillian also provided a lovely parking map.  This was very helpful since there is a lot of zoned parking in the neighborhood, but we never had a problem.  Everything we needed was provided for us and communication with Gillian was very easy.  We definitely want to come back to the Sky Cabin next time we visit Seattle.   Even my friends who live in Seattle were totally ""wowed"" by it.  This place is a total gem in the Emerald City.   "
706385,42199656,2015-08-11,27104003,Shauna,"Gillian was a wonderful hostess. She was very accommodating  and helpful. The ""Sky Cabin"" was everything and more than described on the listing. Very Clean, Spectacular view and all the amenities  of home. Nice, quit neighborhood within walking distance of many restaurants. We would definitely stay with her again. Thanks so much. "
706385,42454084,2015-08-13,17013608,Wanda,"This was the last air b and b of our northwest trip. We saved the best for last. Gillian's attention to detail in her picturesque property is delightful! The kitchen is ready for action, decked out tastefully with whatever you might need with an inviting table overlooking the lake. The bed is comfy and did I mention the bathroom? It IS luxurious. We enjoyed the outside deck for morning coffee and if I had stayed longer would have curled up with a book in the yoga room. Gillian has every type of map of the area along with suggestions where to dine.  By the way....I would most highly suggest Spinnasse.... the best restaurant of our entire trip.  Gillian also has a knack for what travelers might need or forget, not only in the bathroom, but throughout the home.We would most definitely return...next time longer!"
706385,43125081,2015-08-17,11188512,Kevin,"From the moment we walked into the Sky Cabin, we were so happy with our decision to stay there. The cabin exceeded expectations and was absolutely perfect for our long weekend stay. The cabin itself is decorated in such a way that is inviting and super cozy. The kind of place that when we weren't out sight seeing, we were more than happy to spend it at the cabin looking out onto the water. Gillian couldn't have been a better host, providing plenty of detailed information before our arrival. There were also helpful notes throughout the house that proactively answered our questions. The neighborhood restaurant recommendations came in very handy as well with us checking out several of the recommendations with positive results. We also found it very easy to hop on a city bus from the Sky Cabin (a bus stop was only about a block or so away) and head straight downtown to see the sights. All we keep saying throughout the weekend was that we wanted to come back to the Sky Cabin for another visit! Highly recommend to anyone looking for a quiet, weekend getaway just outside of the city of Seattle. Thanks again Gillian for everything! "
706385,43475656,2015-08-20,28903867,Petonelle,This is a truly outstanding place to stay. Gillian has furnished it with everything you could possibly want or need. The location is beautiful and the views over Lake Union are spectacular. It's convenient for the bus to Downtown and Pete's supermarket is a useful local store.
706385,44311664,2015-08-25,13571197,Bria,"The apartment went far above and beyond expectations. Gillian was fantastic at communicating clear instructions, and her mother welcomed us warmly. Everything about the space and aesthetic is inviting and warm without being overbearing or cluttered. The attached patio provides an incredible view of lake Union, especially in the morning with coffee or over dinner in the evening. The Sky Cabin was a bright, relaxing, and refreshing place to stay in Seattle -- my parents enjoyed it so much they returned home and promptly signed up for an Airbnb account themselves in hopes of having such a great experience every time they travel. Highly recommended "
706385,45058301,2015-08-31,2871011,Susan,"This is the kind of place that you could just hide away in and enjoy without ever stepping foot outside the door.  It's that special.  The views are extraordinary and rival those we had a few years back from a floating home we rented on Lake Union.   The space is well designed and very attractive.   Gillian was responsive and easy to communicate with and check-in was a breeze.  Parking worried me until I got there--no problem at all, day or night.  And the location is awesome, with some great places nearby to walk to for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Don't miss 14 carrots for breakfast.  Worth any wait there might be. :)
Thank you Gillian and Barbara, and we hope to be back again!
"
706385,45768276,2015-09-06,30982507,Charles,"Our first ever Airbnb booking and we could not have had a better experience. My wife and I came from Dallas to celebrate our 10 year anniversary. It could not have been more perfect. Gillian and Barbara made this a trip we will never forget. We were able to experience the many wonderful sites and tastes of Seattle and the surrounding area, but really, the best part of the trip was experiencing an amazing Seattle neighborhood, in a great home and living like a local for a few days. 

Prior to our arrival, Gillian was responsive and informative, giving us the information we needed to be prepared when we arrived. Everything went according to plan, Barbara was sweet and welcoming, and stepping into the Sky Cabin for the first time was jaw-dropping. We instantly fell in love with the place, the warmth of the interior, the amazing views and we never lacked for anything during our 4 night stay. Gillian is a great host and we will look for her properties first when planning future trips to the area. 

The bathroom and shower deserve a honorable mention. 3 shower heads and awesome water pressure in a spa quality shower. Fully equipped bathroom with luxurious towels. The ""piece-de-resistance"" however is the heated floor! OMG Why stay at a hotel ever again when in the Seattle area when you have access to this level of luxury?!

Parking is Seattle is always a concern, especially for those of us who never have to worry about parking in our home towns, but we never had an issue here. Gillian allowed us to use a parking permit but it really wasn't necessary as parking was not an issue, and we never had to park more than 50 yards from the front door.

Thanks for the coffee! What a nice touch. Having fresh ground coffee at the house and enjoying the sights and sounds of Lake Union in the mornings was great. 

To say that the Sky Cabin was awesome would not even justify how truly amazing our experience was. Thank you, Gillian and Barbara! Next time, we would love to meet Gillian in person to personally thank her for making our Seattle visit a very special time in our lives.

Oh, was it a coincidence that there was a Sleepless in Seattle DVD? I think not!  Perfect.

If you are ever in Seattle, I highly recommend that you stay with Gillian at the Sky Cabin. We sure will!!!

"
706385,46431379,2015-09-10,38788076,Majid,"Gillian's place absolutely exceeded my expectations. It's roomy and homey and filled with natural light and character. The views are gorgeous and the furniture is comfy. It's just relaxing to be there. I felt right at home from check in to check out.

Beyond the place itself being amazing, it's obvious that tons of care and attention have been put into making your stay enjoyable. From the earplugs on the nightstands (which I didn't need) to the coffee beans on the counter (which my mornings are generally too rushed to use), there are many touches that make you feel cared for. Immeasurably better than any hotel I've ever booked.

I arrived late on my check in day, so Gillian arranged a secure and easy way to allow me access to the key. She was very responsive and attentive. I would pounce on the opportunity to stay here again. I almost don't want to leave such a glowing review, because it only increases the odds of the place being booked next time I'm looking — but it's absolutely deserved."
706385,46596214,2015-09-12,2480190,Manfred,"Gillian's house is a wonderful place with a very special atmosphere. Makes you feel home (or better) from the moment you arrive. Great views of Lake Union and beyond from room and deck. Loved to sit there and watch the sun go down. 
Tasteful, very personal interior. Fully equipped (kitchen, bath) with a lot of attention to detail. Spotlessly clean. Helpful, friendly  little instructions everywhere. Comfortable, cozy bed in a side room with cabin feeling. Excellent directions and communication up front. Very nice greeting by her mother who lives in the same building. 
Did not want to leave and would go again any minute. Go if you can!"
706385,47051999,2015-09-15,38502064,Palen,"My husband and I travelled to Seattle to elope and wanted a cozy getaway for our trip. Sky Cabin caught my attention right away when we started looking at options, and I'm so happy we ended up choosing to stay here! We also stayed in a studio apartment for a few days of our trip, and I'm so happy we stayed at Sky Cabin for the days before and after the wedding. It was very quiet and peaceful, with great natural light. The windows are incredible and it was so peaceful to look out at the view, whether sitting in the living room or preparing food in the kitchen. 
Gillian was a wonderful host and was quick to respond to any questions we had, whether before or during our stay. She even left us a bottle of champagne and a sweet note congratulating us on our marriage - definitely going above and beyond her responsibilities as a host!
I would highly recommended Sky Cabin to anyone traveling to Seattle. It is the perfect getaway spot and only a short ride into town if you want to spend a night out!"
706385,47497693,2015-09-19,41640788,Adam,The Sky Cabin is a great place to relax in a neighborhood near downtown Seattle. With great views of Eastlake it's a nice escape from the hustle of the city. 
706385,47712421,2015-09-21,5507302,Cary,"Very lovely apartment with incredible view of Lake Union.  I booked this place for my mother, and when she left, she said, ""This is the place I want to stay every time I visit Seattle!"""
706385,48539379,2015-09-27,10662945,Amanda,"This place is wonderful, we felt very lucky to have had the chance to stay with its deserving rave reviews! The hosts went out of their way for us, providing special requests since it was a special weekend for us. This was so appreciated, and our stay in the sky cabin made our time in Seattle better than ever. It will be a weekend we won't forget! Thank you! "
706385,49010978,2015-09-30,1343437,Calvin,"As everyone else has described, this home is a wonderful getaway with an amazing view and comfy decor. This was one of the most unique Airbnb's I've had the privilege of staying in and I will definitely be coming back! The whole space is so warm and inviting, it was a wonderful place to come back to and rest. The kitchen and bathroom were fully stocked. The signs all over the place were super helpful, and the tips of what's in the area were great as well. Thank you for opening up your home!"
706385,49360850,2015-10-03,1333949,Gina,"Our stay at Gillian's home was exceptional (and so are the views). The place was charming, sunlit, and homey. Gillian and Barbara were welcoming and friendly. It was easy to make our way downtown via Lyft and we enjoyed a restaurant nearby called Sushi Kappo Tamura immensely. Highly recommend their omakase dinner. Thank you, Gillian!"
706385,49908186,2015-10-07,20748193,Ashley,"AMAZING! Gillian has a system and a place for everything. She is an extremely thoughtful host. I love to cook and her kitchen was definitely adequately stocked. It's often difficult to make some of my favorite things when traveling due to lack of spices ... but she had a full spice rack. The view of the water was spectacular - sunset from the deck is lovely and the location was ideal for everything we had to do in Seattle.

More than any of that, though, the entire place felt good. After a long day of work in Seattle my boyfriend and I really felt like we could just relax here. It was clean, organized, and homey. (The yoga room is a plus!) 

... Definitely one of my favorite places I have stayed so far on AirBNB."
706385,50760411,2015-10-14,42786290,Kristin,"This place far exceeded our expectations! I would stay there again in a heartbeat. The apartment is appointed with everything you need, including a lovely offering of fresh coffee beans both regular and decaf.  The view is spectacular. Loved watching the boat traffic and the rowing teams. The bathroom heated floor was a special treat.  We even had Netflix and Wi fi. Lots of restaurant options in walking distance.  Easy access to downtown and other neighborhoods. Pete's Market just a short stroll along the historic houseboat waterfront had an incredible selection of wines and cheeses. She even has a classical guitar in the yoga room.  Many book collections : cooking, art, travel. A host of maps and local information books and pamphlets. All kinds of spices for cooking. Spectacular. My husband kept commenting that I hit the lottery with this one!"
706385,51124419,2015-10-18,38457830,Katherine,"This was my first Airbnb, and it was absolutely spectacular! From the view of the Lake, to the heated bathroom floors, to everything being labeled, it was perfect. "
706385,51964785,2015-10-25,14298164,Nicole,"We can not say enough good things about both Gillian and the ""Sky Cabin"". Gillian was unbelievably accommodating, and left us the sweetest note congratulating us on our honeymoon upon arrival. Her mother gave us the keys and let us in, and after meeting her it's easy to see where Gillian got her sweetness from. The ""Sky Cabin"" has the most amazing view! The space inside is used as well as I've ever seen, and every knob and switch has a framed, hand drawn picture of what it is/how to use it. We will definitely be coming back to the ""Sky Cabin"" on our next trip to Seattle."
706385,52490118,2015-10-30,26179039,Maggie,"We loved staying in the sky cabin.  It is beautifully furnished with great thoughtful attention to detail in every room.  The view and light is fabulous.  The color scheme is calm and warm, which is important when seattle is grey.  The kitchen is well outfitted with anything you might need for cooking. We appreciated the food she left us so when we arrived we could eat something.    the apartment is so well laid out, each room feels good to be in.  I was doing a work retreat there, so i spent a lot of time happily in the space. 
Gillian was very helpful with queries, and provided tons of information - maps and books, as well as handmade map of the area with restaurants described, supermarkets, shops.  You could not feel lost staying in the Sky Cabin. 
the neighborhood is right near the lake, so you can see the houseboats. It's an easy bus ride to downtown. There are some great restaurants right nearby. 
Highly recommended!

706385,55161406,2015-11-28,47227658,Christie,AMAZING!!!  Thank you Gillian!  not only was your place amazing it was centrally located making it easy to get everywhere...  So cozy...just way to short.  Would like to make this my home away from home at least until I can get moved back to the city...  Thank you again!  
706385,55855283,2015-12-06,29220736,Katelin,"Walking into Gillian's place was like walking into a dream. From the second we walked up the stairs we were knew it was going to be a unique and unforgettable experience. Gillian was a kind and approachable host -- she gave us clear instructions on checking in, and periodically checked on us throughout our stay. She also took the time to make detailed instructions on heating, how the showers worked, and such. Airbnb is lucky to have her as a host :). 

Location was great, just a quick Lyft ride to downtown. But if you want to stay close to home there are lots of fun restaurants and cafes within walking distance. The place was impeccable and the view was a treat to wake up to each morning.

Thanks Gillian for the great experience! "
706385,56432267,2015-12-13,10548764,Mariya,Amazing views and easy going host!
706385,56805762,2015-12-18,43929919,Sandra,Gillian was a wonderfully warm and welcoming host!
706385,56976258,2015-12-20,39154385,Jake,"Unbelievable! My wife and I couldn’t have been happier walking into the Sky Cabin. We spent two awesome nights in Seattle to visit family and the central location of this apartment was absolutely perfect. Parking was much easier than I expected and the home itself was furnished well beyond our expectations. My wife won’t stop talking about the heated bathroom floor and stunning Lake Union views. We didn't expect to see the Space Needle -- but low and behold, there it was! We will definitely look forward to returning this Spring or Summer."
706385,57967055,2015-12-30,2688292,Gleb And Sherry,"We felt welcome upon arrival and the apartment was warm and ready for us.  The amenities of this apartment were so incredibly well thought out that we felt like we were in a hotel.  The kitchen well equipped and even butter and cream in the refrigerator.  The view was very inviting and made you want to sit back, relax and just enjoy it. "
1499596,23368699,2014-11-30,17315128,Rhett,"This place was fantastic.  It was perfect for us.  From the radiant heated floors to the giant bathtub on the third floor.  Love, love Gerry's style.  His furniture is gorgeous--mid-century modern mostly in wood.  Eames kitchen table chairs.  Every looks so good that you're surprised it is all extremely comfortable.  His photos on the walls are uplifting and compelling and visually well-framed.  The kitchen has everything you could want.  The beds were super comfortable.  The building seems eco-friendly and built very solidly.  Windows and window treatments are high quality.  No drafts (even on a snowy day).  The neighborhood was close to everything.  Other folks in the building were kind and casual.  You can walk downtown or to Capitol Hill or take a $5 Uber ride.  We would move into that place in a minute.  Even better than the photos.  And Gerry was a very good host.  Beautifully done, Gerry.  "
1499596,24420498,2014-12-28,7525208,Warren,the host was great communicating with us and the home was as described.  great place with all the amenities we needed.

1499596,35098405,2015-06-15,3191544,Lynn,"Great place, we had 5 people and we all fit comfortably. Everyone loved it! Very spacious and description on posting was accurate."
1499596,37326492,2015-07-06,13899530,Age,"the host left a welcome packet that had the wifi information, things to do in the area, what amenities to use and how to keep it clean. that was very useful to have.

the pictures of the listing were very accurate. the house was very modern and had a lot of windows which was nice to let the natural light come in. clean and organized and left some clean towels for us to use. very nice living room on the second floor with the apple tv. the neighborhood was chill and had a nearby park and coffee shop that was very walkable. it's about a 15 minute drive to pike place which was nice since it's not too far or too close. "
6360895,34377383,2015-06-07,23041416,Jasleen,My stay at BeckyJo's was fantastic. They were super helpful and accommodating with our stay in Seattle. The place was cozy and clean. The bathroom had extra tooth brushes which was perfect because I had forgotten mine! Prior to arrival BeckyJo had asked my preference of snacks that we would enjoy during our stay and we came to the place with muffins and orange juice ready to go! This place is great and I would definitely come back and stay. 
6360895,34585748,2015-06-09,34475253,Danielle,"This was our first time using airbnb and we were very impressed. The place looked exactly like the photos, even better. It was clean and very welcoming. It really felt like she wanted us to have the best experience. We definitely would stay again if we were to be back in the city."
6360895,35147859,2015-06-15,34409977,Steven,Our son's college graduation brought us to Seattle for our first Airbnb experience.  BeckyJo's hospitality and spacious bottom floor apartment far exceeded our expectations! She was attentive to details like dietary needs and late night check-in...very helpful without being intrusive. The accommodations were quite clean and comfortable.  We were surprised and pleased by the thoughtful touches like homemade muffins and special T-shirts from our son's university.  We highly recommend this cozy Georgetown spot!   
6360895,35726473,2015-06-21,20766104,Audrey,"We had a terrific experience for our first stay with airbnb. This basement apartment is very cozy, spacious, and peaceful. It is conveniently located close to downtown. There is also ample parking in the driveway if you have a car. BeckyJo was very accommodating with our late night schedule. She was also kind enough to provide muffins and fruit for our stay. If you have a chance to visit one of their CrossFit gyms that they own, you should do so. They are a very welcoming community and I am thankful I was able to visit. We will definitely stay here again when we come to Seattle. "
6360895,36426804,2015-06-28,34950843,Misael,"Everything about the home was perfect! I went up for a bachelor weekend and my friends and I couldn't have enjoyed ourselves more!

Becky had made us muffins and the extra treats were wonderful to arrive and have throughout the weekend. We'll definitely stay again if we visit Seattle again."
6360895,37481889,2015-07-07,23121624,Steffen,Really nice place in a upcoming area in Georgetown. Very close to Seattle and the airport. Super fast transportation with the bus to Seattle. Super clean and beautiful rooms. 
6360895,38286634,2015-07-14,33685101,Rafael,"This was my first time using airbnb, so I was a little nervous bout using it. My expectations were beyond I could of imagined, from the apartment size was huge enough for six people, BeckJo went above beyond, by stocking the fridge to even making us muffins, I felt right at home. The rooms were very large, and the neighborhood was really nice, it's only a 5 min walked to Georgetown, and there's a lot of restaurants, and bars there.. Downtown Seattle is about 5-10 mins away and your driving through the backroads, so I never delt with traffic, and it was an easy drive back and forth to the city. I would highly recommend this place when visiting Seattle."
6360895,39176320,2015-07-21,230976,Kirk,"Quiet, clean and very comfortable.  BeckyJo paid attention to every detail, right down to the keurig and fresh home made muffins
."
6360895,39630493,2015-07-25,17266610,Donna,"BeckyJos place was just what is shown. Fridge stocked with water, juice and cokes. Homemade blueberry muffins were waiting upon our arrival. My only compliant is that you have to walk down hill to get to restaurants. This probably wouldn't be a complaint but I have HORRIBLE knees so if you have issues walking this is not the place for you. Otherwise it was clean, comfortable and could handle my whole family of six. It is well appointed with washer/dryer even!  I would highly recommend for anyone without knee issues unless you don't need to go out for meals by foot. "
6360895,40746035,2015-08-02,4392486,Simone,"This was exactly what we needed the week leading up to my sister's wedding in the area.  Spacious, well appointed, comfortable and a great location from which to explore Seattle.  BeckyJo was incredibly sweet and made us great blueberry muffins, and checked in to make sure we were surviving the unexpected heat okay (we did just great, thanks for the fan).

When my husband and I decided to stay an extra night, BeckyJo was so easy going and made the process simple.  We'll definitely stay here again next time we're in Seattle."
6360895,41769225,2015-08-09,35115130,Jason,"We arrived earlier than expected on the date of our check-in, do to a cancellation in plans that we had previously made. I had forgotten to aware BeckyJo we were going to be early. Upon arrival BeckyJo was running errands, although her husband was there and made us feel right at home. When BeckyJo arrived home she came and introduced herself and explained she had some finishing touches she wanted to do. While out for dinner she completed them. She left us with a map of parks in the area, a seperate map of the specific locations her local recommendations as well as a guest information sheet. She also stocked the fridge with drinks and snacks for our stay! There is also coffee and other hot beverages provided. The basement apartment is beautiful, very well decorated and spacious! BeckyJo was more than accomodating to us and went above and beyond any preconceptions we had, being this was our first time using ab&b. She has truly made her place feel like a home away from home. My friend and I are planning future trips to the Seattle area and have decided that there is no other option than BeckyJo's for lodging. I would rate my stay at BeckyJo's at FIVE SHOOTING STARS overall!
Thank you again BeckyJo ever so much!!!"
6360895,43276821,2015-08-18,27573919,Caitlin,"BeckyJo's place was fantastic! The apartment had everything we needed: a parking spot, comfy beds, coffee. Checking in and out was a breeze. We took the bus to and from downtown both days and explored some of the places BeckyJo recommended to eat, all very good! I would stay here again in a heartbeat. "
6360895,43931721,2015-08-23,35730923,Kelly,The place is cute and simple.  We felt comfortable stayed 2 night. We appwricated homemade muffins and drinks! Thank you so much. 
6360895,44310855,2015-08-25,5259653,Patrick,My friends and I spent 2 nights at BeckJo's place and it was wonderful. We each had our own rooms and were even welcomed with delicious blueberry muffins. The room was clean and nicely decorated. We would love to stay here again if we visit Seattle in the future. It was definitely my best Airbnb experience. Thanks BeckyJo! 
6360895,45081754,2015-08-31,3671515,Matthew,"BeckyJo was completely and utterly AWESOME. She gave us some great info on local breweries/eats/etc, the house was completely wonderful and perfect little place to crash. Would highly recommend to anyone ... literal ""heads-up"" though to anyone over 6'1"". The ceilings are low so watch your noggin if you've been drinking. :) 

SHE ALSO MADE US MUFFINS. AWESOME. "
6360895,45525252,2015-09-03,42541785,Abel,"Four of us stayed there for two nights from Sept. 1 thru Sept. 3. The place was clean and comfortable, with good beds, clean and fresh bed/pillow sheets and enough toiletries. I do not remember if the room had a tv or not. I parked in their one car driveway. The street was narrow; only one car can get thru, but that did not bother me because the road was not busy. BeckyJo was nice. I would recommend her place. "
6360895,46540191,2015-09-11,43211606,Ran,"The place was great!
Three comfortable bedrooms and a nice living room to drink some coffee at (there's a coffee machine!)
The location is perfect, quite and beautiful and just a few minutes drive from everything.
We enjoyed the drinks and the muffins were awesome!"
6360895,47408870,2015-09-18,6514265,Yury,"It's a nice place to stay when you visit Seattle. Just about 20 minutes to downtown. Quiet neighborhood.  It was extremely clean in there. It was a bit cold, but there was a heater, so it was not a problem. BeckyJo filled fridge with water and soda and juice. Also there was a kerug with a lot of coffee and tea and BeckyJo made muffins wich was really good."
6360895,47658288,2015-09-21,38133049,Jingqiu,"We don't see Beckyjo when we stay there,but can feel  they are so kindly. They prepared everything well so careful ,that make us so comfortable. Thanks a lot!"
6360895,48236565,2015-09-24,43739934,George,"It is a nice and clean 3-bedroom house. Quiet neighborhood. With WiFi, clean towels, desks, coffee cooker, and all needed as or more than a Hotel. 
My wife and friends like it."
6360895,48877715,2015-09-29,28656852,Hanna,"Most of the time we were out and about and so we didn't interact too much with BeckyJo, but she was a great host! Upon arrival, she had muffins and a bunch of other drinks and snacks waiting for us. She even left a list of different food recommendations and tips. The place itself was incredibly clean and well-prepared. It was comfortable and had a lot of stocked conveniences that our group really appreciated. The location was great, pretty close to downtown Seattle and the airport. All in all I would highly recommend this place!"
6360895,49318738,2015-10-03,14106852,Patrice,"BeckyJo was an excellent host. The apartment is quiet, spotless and relatively roomy. To get to the centre of town is not difficult by bus or taxi. "
6360895,49775281,2015-10-06,39650864,Christopher,"This cozy Georgetown spot was absolutely perfect. Very clean, with great amenities such as a Kuerig coffee maker (clutch), and a mini-fridge. Not to mention, plenty of ""forgettables"" (razors, shampoo, soap), which can be great for short travels. The neighborhood area was nice and quiet, and very accessible to all places in the metro area (we used uber/lyft)."
6360895,50645192,2015-10-13,31375093,Devin,"BeckyJo, her husband, and daughter were great hosts! We loved the space - perfect for families with kids! BeckyJo had some toys waiting for the kids when we arrived, which was much appreciated! The space was very clean and our group of 6 (including two toddlers) loved the muffins made by BeckyJo! The location was great - close enough to downtown Seattle and the restaurants in Georgetown were a short walk. All in all, we loved our stay here and would definitely come back! "
6360895,51289182,2015-10-19,29345702,Candace,"Becky Jo was so kind, welcoming us when we first got there, making sure we had all of our information including maps for the local transportation and good local restaurants. She even baked us fresh blueberry muffins and had them in our room. "
6360895,53333724,2015-11-08,18612994,Jason,"BeckyJo was an amazing host. I had a few hiccups with my out of town friends and she was super easy to accommodate the changes. The home was beautiful, clean, and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again!"
6360895,53878666,2015-11-14,42314153,Josh,"Our stay was excellent! BeckyJo kindly made us delicious muffins and everything was as described. Also, great neighborhood for brunch (thanks for the suggestions BeckyJo!). I would definitely recommend this spot!"
6360895,55382291,2015-12-01,45671548,Leslie,"This was the perfect place for us.  Not too far from the city, roomy and comfortable.  BeckyJo's oft-mentioned muffins were delicious and the coffee/tea were much appreciated.  The only thing that seemed a bit odd was there was no tv, but that wasn't a big deal.  "
6360895,55680246,2015-12-04,39269970,David,Becky jo was a very kind and sweet. She was very welcoming. The place was nice and clean. Me and my crew felt right at home. We appreciate her letting us film project in her own home. Whenever we needed her she was always available. It was an overall a great experience. Highly recommended.
856550,3257154,2013-01-03,4448750,Svenja,The little hut is really cozy and cute: it gives a good amount of privacy and is really well built! The bed is super comfortable and the hosts were very nice and had no problems with me arriving late in the night! So I can really recommend this cute hut for everybody who does not mind to walk through the garden for the (website hidden): the bus station (Route D) is just 2 minutes away!
856550,3483272,2013-02-05,4377596,Josh Alex,"The place is a real gem. Cozy, comfortable and quirky! Jean-Marc and his family are very hospitable hosts and make the effort to make you feel at home. The D Bus is located just outside with very frequent trips to Downtown, Ballard and easy access to Fremont. Whole Foods and other quick eateries are just a 7 minute walk away. Had a great time in Seattle and I look to forward to visiting again soon."
856550,3638768,2013-02-26,5123951,Scott,"This is likely the coolest place to stay in Seattle. Jean-marc is carpenter by trade — if I remember correctly — and the cabin he built in his backyard is cozy and lovely. The backyard has chickens, that remain very quiet, a cool rocking bench that's awesome to read on and you'll probably run into Jean-marc's sweet dogs.  "
856550,3799712,2013-03-16,2822449,Krista,"Jean-Marc was a wonderful host throughout our five-night stay. He was very friendly and approachable, making our first time using airbnb a great experience! The tiny cabin was perfect for us, providing a clean and comfortable bed, and plenty of warmth, despite the cold Seattle weather! And we loved the backyard setting with the garden and the chickens! We would highly recommend staying in the tiny cabin!! :D"
856550,3906175,2013-03-26,4913921,Laura,"I had a great stay in the Tiny Garden Cabin! Jean-Marc and his wife were wonderful hosts -- very open and welcoming. The cabin was very clean and cozy, and snugly built. Even without the fan, I slept like a baby (and I'm a light sleeper!). And the setting was perfect -- great view, lovely backyard, and easy walking distance to coffee, grocery store, and the bus. I would definitely stay here again!"
856550,3932618,2013-03-28,4724052,Mairi,Jean-Marc & Maggie were great hosts - the location is convenient and the cabin is very comfortable!  Perfect mix of friendly and helpful hosts and it was easy to get settled.  Would stay here again.
856550,4056169,2013-04-06,5580190,Joshua,"I greatly enjoyed staying with Jean-marc and Maggie. The cabin is exactly that: tiny, and in the garden! It was a great starting point, centrally located to all kinds of fascinating parts of Seattle. The hosts were thoughtful and courteous, and I would recommend it to anybody looking for a basic, convenient accommodation."
856550,4234204,2013-04-21,3793200,Jenn,"Jean-Marc and his family made my first stay in Seattle very comfortable (I can't wait to go back!). The tiny cabin is extremely clean as is the bathroom. Their home is perfectly situated for using public transportation (D bus is across the street!) and takes you straight to downtown, both convenient and safe. Jean-Marc and his wife Maggie are great people-hard-working, industrious, and kind-thank you for your hospitality! "
856550,4297418,2013-04-25,1601052,Stu & Deb,"Had a great stay at the Tiny Garden Cabin. The amount of space available inside was perfect for my brief 2 night stay. I was impressed by the cleanliness, warmth and sound proofing. The sounds of the city were kept at a level that never affected my sleep, and the heater and fan provided are guaranteed to keep the occupant comfortable. Access to the bus is a very short walk away, and I found navigating the transit system quite straight forward (they even have WIFI on the D Route bus). Jean-marc and his wife were gracious hosts and made me feel very welcome."
856550,4324710,2013-04-28,1569660,Ian,"Jean, his wife and the two dogs ensure you feel like its a home away from home.  The little home is extremely peaceful and perfect for relaxing after a long day in the city.  It is only a short bus or drive from downtown and we recommend Jean's little self-made house for anyone visiting Seattle."
856550,4434163,2013-05-05,5806993,Matthew,"A little piece of heaven in downtown Seattle!
Really nice family, great little 'urban farm' very close to shops etc and only a twenty minute walk from the centre of all things Seattle.
Thoroughly recommended."
856550,4575264,2013-05-13,5953772,Burl,"Jean-marc is a very laid back and friendly guy.  The cabin itself is great little place to stay.  You should be prepared for lots of chickens and (very friendly) dogs though.  There are buses right by the house to both downtown and to Fremont/the Udistrict.  Overall, I had a really good experience and can definitely recommend the place."
856550,4680015,2013-05-20,5666722,Rachael,"Greetings airbnb community,
If you're looking for simplicity, affordability, comfort, & a laid back atmosphere, I would highly recommend both rentals offered by Jean-marc and his sweet wife, Maggie! I rented both garden cabin & gypsy wagon! I was able to arrive 2 days before the rest of my family, and was immediately charmed by my upper bunk in the gypsy wagon :)   I had a blast The Triple Door's show: ""Through the Looking Glass: The Burlesque Alice In Wonderland"", and stumbled upon the huge Norwegian constitutional parade in ballard. Had a delicious afghan meal with my family, with complimentary fernee that melted in your mouth! Our hosts were warm and welcoming, located close to metro stop, close to whole foods, loved their two pug dogs, chickens, and muppet-like angora rabbit!! Unfortunately, we all left in the morning for some last minute sightseeing before our cruise to alaska, and did not want to wake our hosts, so did not get to say a proper good bye! and Thank You!!"
856550,4765528,2013-05-24,6280866,Hannah,J and Maggie are super friendly and welcoming! The cottage is very comfortable and the bed is amazing! I would highly recommend staying here! The location is perfect just a short bus ride away from downtown and there is washing facilities not far. We had a great time and would definitely return! Thanks again for having us!
856550,4849001,2013-05-28,6453588,Jeremy,"Great time.  Perfect room for the minimalist traveler.  Comfy, cozy, clean, easy to access, convenient to both Seattle downtown and the Ballard neighborhood.  Loved the chickens (they were quiet).  Already contemplating when I can return."
856550,5109922,2013-06-12,6351704,Galiya,"Jean and Maggie were wonderful hosts to us during our stay at their cabin. They are a very friendly, charming, helpful couple who created a unique little world of their own in the heart of Seattle that they are kindly sharing with other people . The cabin and bathroom were immaculate, the bed was comfortable and the place was quite and felt safe. I enjoyed their green lawn and friendly pets especially angora bunny. We would recommend this to anyone planning a visit to Seattle! Thank you again for having us as your guests!
"
856550,5232253,2013-06-19,2151517,Amy,Very friendly hosts! Even the chickens and bunny were sweet and charming. Initially I was a little concerned about the adjacency to a busy road but it proved to be a very quiet setting and the bed was extremely comfortable.
856550,5269765,2013-06-21,858695,Luke,Responsive communication. Well run and personable. The rooms make for a very unique experience. Recommended hosts!
856550,5318081,2013-06-24,6472398,Geneva,"Why would you stay anywhere else in Seattle?  The handcrafted spaces that Jay has built made our stay a very unique experience. Clean, cozy, private, easy access to the bus, although we pretty much walked everywhere. Both Maggie and Jay were very welcoming and friendly.  We enjoyed talking to them and hearing their interesting stories.  Great hosts, I would definitely recommend staying in the Tiny Cabin or the Gypsy Wagon and plan to do so myself if I get the chance to visit Seattle again.  "
856550,5466381,2013-07-01,4301378,Susan,"The cottage was perfectly comfortable, the bathroom was large and clean, the bus ride to Seattle's highlights was easy and frequent, the chickens and bunnies and dogs were friendly and fun, the yard was relaxing, and Jean-marc, Maggie and their daughter were  lovely, creative, fascinating and warm hosts. It makes me so sad that they are thousands of miles away -- any closer and we would visit them till they grew tired of us : )"
856550,5545089,2013-07-05,6769979,Julia,Jean-marc and his family were wonderful hosts.  We enjoyed our time in the cabin as well as our time exploring the city.  The cabin was the perfect location and we will definitely stay here again!
856550,5602270,2013-07-08,1544172,Lisa,"We couldn't have enjoyed our stay at the Tiny Garden Cabin more. It was so cozy, we actually stayed IN one night on our recent trip to Seattle, while two chickens snuggled on a tree stump outside our door. Jean-marc and Maggie are awesome hosts; true citizens of the world who care about the planet, the relationship they build with it and the people they meet on it. We learned a lot from being guests in their home; by the end of our long weekend, we didn't want to leave. And in fact, after a plane crashed at our home base of San Francisco, we almost got our chance... Jean-marc and Maggie were extremely accommodating of us on our extra unplanned day in Seattle and even offered to find a way to put us up again if need be, even though all their accommodations were booked. They're true hosts in every sense of the word -- so don't waste your money on a hotel! This little corner of the world has everything you need for a most pleasant stay. We will definitely be back. "
856550,5762702,2013-07-15,7066103,Michelle,"We stayed in the cabin in the back.  Jean-Marc's son was there to host us when we got in, and he did a great job.  We loved the chickens and the bunny and the Keurig coffee in the morning.  They provided plenty of towels and toiletries to make us feel at home.  The wifi and wall outlets in the cabin were a great bonus!"
856550,5852344,2013-07-19,7254349,Jennifer,"This is quite simply the best place to stay in Seattle, especially if you've left your furry friends at home :)  Lots of doggie kisses on arrival, and Jean-Mark very kindly stayed up late to let me in and even showed me around.  The Tiny Cabin is adorable, and has everything you might want for a great stay in Seattle, including a fan or heater depending on the weather, wifi, a welcome book with insider tips, AND there's parking.  Plus, both Maggie and Jean-Marc made me feel so welcome, I cannot recommend these folks highly enough.  "
856550,5946774,2013-07-23,7021649,Carrie,"Jean-Marc's cabin was fantastic! I rented the space out for my Mom, who absolutely loved it! The backyard garden is beautiful! Nice, clean and cozy!"
856550,6003032,2013-07-26,6550623,Ryan,"Great place to stay. Jean-Marc was a wonderful host, the cabin was cute and the bed comfy. Excellent location for exploring Seattle."
856550,6067140,2013-07-29,5337814,Maree,Great place to stay. The little cabin is very comfortable and quiet. It is very close to the bus which goes into the city frequently. Jean Marc and family are good hosts. A little bit of farm life in the city!
856550,6325138,2013-08-08,6808231,Georgia,Jay was a great host and was very accommodating even when we came in later then expected. The Tiny Cabin was adorable and the perfect size for us. We loved all the animal friends especially Jay's friendly pugs. We hope to come back soon!
856550,6395252,2013-08-11,4964580,Anja,Staying at Jean-Marc's place was fun! The cabin is small but with very comfortable bed and it was very nice to have a (website hidden)'s family and pets make it a cosy place. Neighbourhood is very safe and with good connections to downtown and Ballard. We enjoyed our stay here very much.
856550,6464266,2013-08-13,7358939,Nadine,"We liked our stay in Seattle ! The bed in the tiny cabin was sooooo cozy. :) A quiet place to sleep. And in the morning you can even make yourself a tasty coffee or tea. The dogs and chickens were nice.
There is a lot privacy, because the cabin is located in the garden.
"
856550,6536994,2013-08-16,7429804,Jenni,"We had such a great time staying at the Tiny Garden Cabin. It was exactly what we were looking for! Very cozy, comfortable, and quiet. And CLEAN! Jean-Marc was a terrific host. We also enjoyed meeting the other guests that were staying in the Gypsy Wagon next door. You can't beat this location for the price. We did not have a car and it was very easy to get around using the bus stop which was right around the corner. We would definitely stay again."
856550,6587422,2013-08-18,6708033,Emily,"The tiny green cabin is everything you need, and Jean-Marc has done a great job making it feel homey. It is a unique experience... Much more fun than staying in a hotel room.  Be prepared to interact with all sorts of adorable animals! "
856550,6661807,2013-08-20,7421729,Maria,"We stayed at the tiny cabin for a couple of nights. Great price for a nice and clean place, pretty convenient to get to downtown Seattle as there is a bus just right at the house's door. You also have some shared space if you want to have dinner, read or just relax. "
856550,6720942,2013-08-22,3131361,Mary,"great stay in the cabin, great garden area, nice living space and clean bathroom. hosts welcoming and full of info of locate spots.
cheers
mary and danny"
856550,6760357,2013-08-24,7709243,Shalyn,"We greatly enjoyed staying in the Tiny Garden Cabin while we were in Seattle. The area was great, close to a bus stop, and the tiny house was adorable. Our plans were packed full, but we wish we could have spent more time enjoying the yard, chickens, and garden!"
856550,6870519,2013-08-28,803359,Esteban,"This was the best AirBnB experience I've had to date. The house is so convenient and, in my opinion, a pretty central location to explore Seattle. The D rapid line is literally just outside the door, which takes you to downtown, Belltown, Ballard, and connects you to Capitol Hill. We took a bus to Fremont as well from the same bus stop. A car was definitely not necessary during our week-long trip, in case you're (website hidden) and his family were the best hosts: warm, friendly and accommodating. Oh, and the best part was that Whole Foods was just two blocks down the street. Perfect! On second thought, the hammock/swing in the backyard was the best part, and the gorgeous views of the Queen Anne hills. I'd love to stay in the cabin during my next trip up!"
856550,6955860,2013-09-01,6119460,Anna,Jean- Marc has built a very neat cabin in a pretty garden. The cabin and the bathroom were very clean. 
856550,7007897,2013-09-03,4185737,Jamie,"The tiny cabin was so nice. Plenty if room for luggage, good for two people, just really comfortable. The common area of the house was also great. Jean-Marc and Maggie provide water and a nice keurig selection. The dogs are lovey, and the rabbit is amazing. "
856550,7208569,2013-09-10,3956428,Stephanie,"I had the best time in this little cabin!! These guys are great hosts, and the cabin is perfect for a comfortable stay. I've stayed in quite a few places in Seattle, and this is by far my favorite."
856550,7397178,2013-09-18,8180916,Daniel,"Our hosts were polite and professional, kind and pleasant.  The Tiny cabin feels a lot bigger than it looks, and it was perfect for coming to Seattle to visit and explore the area.

If you are the kind of person who wants to experience where they visit and just needs a home base to return, this is the perfect spot!"
856550,7481379,2013-09-22,377161,Tammy,It is an Adorable cottage. Everything was extremely clean. The hosts were very welcoming and accommodating. I highly recommend it.
856550,7610259,2013-09-26,8620148,Christopher,"This is a fantastic little place, very cozy, well insulated. The bed is really comfortable, and the place is very private. It's great having chickens and a rabbit to share the yard with. The common areas were clean and kept well appointed."
856550,7699484,2013-09-30,8168959,Joseph,"This was my first experience with airbnb and it was definitely a positive one! Jean-Marc and his wife Maggie were very friendly and hospitable for my stay in the cabin. When I arrived they were there and greeted me and explained the lay of the land. I never really saw them after that, but I appreciated the level of preparation and organization that they had to ensure a smooth operation for them as well as other guests on their property.

I had a minor issue with one of the fixtures, however Jean-Marc fixed it lightning fast! Thank you for your contributions to my wonderful experience in Seattle!"
856550,7834165,2013-10-05,8805435,Dolan,"My Girlfriend and I used the tiny cabin as our starting point in Seattle. We packed up all of our stuff and drove to seattle. When we arrived Jean-Marc showed us the beautiful common area and our own private cabin out back. He gave us a quick tour and then left us to our rest.(The bed in the tiny cabin is AMAZING) He was a wonderful host with a beautiful space. He has two wonderful dogs who will love you as their own for a few pets. Just down the hill from the tiny cabin is a bus stop where you can catch the ""D"" line which runs almost every 15 minutes and takes you straight into the heart of the city. 10/10 would rent again. 

If you want to explore the city but go home to a nice soft bed, pick the tiny cabin."
856550,8003129,2013-10-12,8785396,Ricialg,This was my first AirBnb experience and it was perfect! I was visiting Seattle for an adventure by myself. It was so easy to get to from the airport because the D line is right down the block from the cabin. Jean-Marc and Maggie were out of town but their son was there if I ever needed anything. The common area and bathroom was awesome. you really don't feel like you're intruding in their house because it is separate from the rest of the house. It was a great space to even talk to the people who were staying in the gypsy wagon. The space is perfect for 1-2 people and the bed is really really comfy! Thank you for the hospitality! If I'm ever in Seattle again I will definitely stay here.
856550,8346002,2013-10-27,8052724,Carli,"This was my first experience with air nab and it was a wonderful one. Jean Marc and his wife are wonderful hosts. The tiny cabin was immaculate and comfortable. The bus to downtown Seattle is literally across the street.
The section of the main house used for guests is kept separate from the hosts' living area, so you can come and go as you please. There's free Keurig beverages along with a microwave and fridge. There is a Whole Foods two blocks away.
The chickens, puggles, and human toddler were all entertaining hosts as well. I enthusiastically recommend this property."
856550,8520631,2013-11-04,8640108,Megan,"The tiny cabin was just what we wanted for a long weekend in Seattle.  It's in a great location (within 10 minutes of downtown and a short drive from the funkier parts of Seattle with good food), has a nice view from the backyard, is super cozy, and Jean-Marc was very helpful.  I would definitely stay here again, especially because the price is so fair. 
If you don't like sharing a bathroom, this place isn't for you, but you only share with one other tiny cabin, and Jean-Marc provides you with many clean towels and keeps the bathroom well-stocked.
Totally worth it."
856550,8779757,2013-11-18,8292365,Justin,"We had a great time at the Garden Cabin, it was small and cozy and suited our needs well. Coffee, tea and hot chocolate in the part of the house we had access to was very welcome! Everything was clean and Jean-Marc was very friendly and laid back. Would gladly stay again, definitely recommend for anyone looking for a nice small place to use as base camp and to spend a couple nights."
856550,8921289,2013-11-25,10138660,Katie,"We had such a great stay with Jean-Marc! The little cabin was super comfortable, close to downtown and Ballard, and easy to grab buses in either direction. We loved waking up to the sound of chickens and saying hello to their awesome pet rabbit (though Ian and I were unsure of whether its name was ""Treble"" or ""Trouble"").

I hope to stay at the little cabin the next time we come down to Seattle! Thanks for having us!"
856550,9052047,2013-12-03,4914600,Ritesh,Our stay in Garden Cabin was very comfy and Jean was very friendly . Jean's place is not far off from Seattle downtown and this made commute very easy for us. Thanks Jean for having us.. 
856550,9079773,2013-12-05,9338248,Pascal,"I stayed at the tiny garden cabin for 2nights while i was in town for a concert & some shopping. This was a warm cozy place to stay & a 10$ cab ride to downtown which was perfect. The washroom is in a shared common room in the main house, so this required getting dressed  to go outside in order to use it, but I didn't find this to be an inconvenience. J-M was a friendly & awesome host :)"
856550,9122908,2013-12-08,10416985,Rushi,"The stay here was amazing!  I booked it very last minute and had a few changes in how long I could stay. But J was very accommodating and welcoming.  They are very open and I felt right at home.  Definitely would stay there again and recommend it to any friends coming to the Seattle area!

Thanks!!! "
856550,9184701,2013-12-11,4290359,Helene,"Fun little space, everything was comfortable and clean. My favorite were the chicken clucking in the back yard. Jean-Marc is a welcoming host and everything was just perfect. Thank you!"
856550,9692640,2014-01-05,10797917,Alice,Amazing experience! I loved the chickens and the big ol' bunny in their yard! Jean and his family were wonderful to me!
856550,9962130,2014-01-21,3609447,Rekha,Jean-Marc's city oasis was lovely. Jean-Marc was very communicative and easy going. The tiny cabin was our perfect little home away from home as we visited the lovely city of Seattle.  It will  be my first choice anytime I come to Seattle.   It is in the perfect spot nestled between downtown and Ballard.  The property is steps to a bus that can have you anywhere within minutes.  There are also chickens and the coolest rabbit in the world to greet you every morning.  :) 
856550,10153908,2014-02-03,11136972,Morgan,"I loved staying in the sweet, little garden cabin. It was homey and private and I enjoyed saying hello to the angora bunny, Treble, on my way in and out. Jean-Marc was warm and laid-back and while making himself available for any requests, he was great about leaving us to our own devices. A great spot with a lot of charm! "
856550,10236729,2014-02-08,11699641,Ashley,"A Cozy Gem in the city, super cool spot, quite neighborhood, close to Whole foods, and warm lovely bed to sink into. Jean-Marc has a Jim Hansen Space muppet in backyard (Furry adorable Bunny) Which was the highlight along with a warm greeting upon coming to to property from Jean-Marc. We discovered a place we would come to again and again!"
856550,10313474,2014-02-12,5555971,Kindy,"Fun stay at the Garden Cottage, thanks for the comfortable accommodations. "
856550,10451164,2014-02-19,338058,Jerusha,"Jean-Marc met us upon arrival and gave a tour of the community location with coffee, water, fridge, microwave, clean bathroom with plenty of towels (set aside by which cute space you are staying in) a wonderful living and dining space with a large collection of dvd's for those rainy Seattle evenings.
The cabin was perfect for two and toasty warm for a chilly February day. Jean-Marc also provides internet access. I loved my stay. Very quiet, very clean, great landlords :)
Just remember to bring your own toiletries (it is a b&b) and a pair of rubber slippers to run back and forth from the cabin to the community space. Perfect location and plenty of street parking. Highly recommend! "
856550,10514164,2014-02-23,261078,Victor,"We had an awesome time staying in Jay's cabin. The property is practically on top of a bus line that gives you easy access to the downtown and there's plenty of street parking within a block as well. Everything was clean and provided freshly laundered towels, wash cloths, sheets, blankets, and pillow cases. Met plenty of chickens, two pugs with the softest fur you've ever pet, and a rabbit whose fur is to die for. Jay and his wife had helpful suggestions of things to do in the area and restaurants to visit. It was a great and inexpensive experience and I look forward to going back sometime again."
856550,10737605,2014-03-05,6453588,Jeremy,"I love staying in this place. This was my second stay and I hope to stay here the next time I'm in Seattle. It's tiny but comfortable, and convenient to plenty of action."
856550,10885896,2014-03-11,4016392,Chris,"This space is amazing, we just loved it!! Such a great chill out space. "
856550,11317766,2014-03-30,10092223,Frank,"We enjoyed staying here. Quiet, clean, well insulated (when the window is closed you don't hear traffic nor any other loud noise). The living room and bath room are comfy. It also seams a very safe neighborhood. Many people leave doors unlocked. We walked a lot, people you meet on the way are always friendly.

Jean Marc, family and dogs are friendly and welcoming and helpful. The Netgear Wifi works great, much better than the standard wifi they offer, but I found out after checking with JM. You also need to be in the house (which is good place to sit and lounge), the wifi doesn't work from the cabin.

The page at Airbnb lists exactly what they provide.

It's worth mentioning there is a Wholefoods Market just a few blocks south on 15th that is not cheap, but has all the right stuff if you want to eat healthy, without added sugars, gluten free, etc.

If I have a chance I will be delighted to come back to this place."
856550,11442886,2014-04-02,332132,Lisa,"What can I say that others haven't already said? A unique experience staying in the yard. I liked the privacy, the views of the sound, and the yard. Remember slip on shoes to walk across the yard into the house to access the bathroom!"
856550,11514807,2014-04-06,12974013,Andy,"First time in Seattle, first time using airbnb and our experience could not have been better! Lovely hosts, wonderful space, and the perfect location. Grocery stores, good food/beer within walking distance, and a 30 second walk to a major bus line which we rode all over the city. Driving to/finding the place from Portland was a total breeze considering neither of us had been to Seattle before. Can't wait until the next time!"
856550,11605072,2014-04-08,1287692,Lee,"I had a great time staying in the Tiny Garden (website hidden) and Maggie were great hosts, very accomodating and nice to talk to. The cabin was warm and surprisingly spacious. Not a bad location either! Near public transport. Great value. I would definitely stay here again or recommend to a friend."
856550,11862065,2014-04-17,1403789,Dylan,"Jean-Marc's place is fantastic! The cabin is cozy and comfortable, the common room in the house is lovely. The whole place is really delightful. Jean-Marc was a great host. "
856550,12306116,2014-04-28,14224139,Alec,Jean-Marc and Maggie were excellent hosts. The tiny cabin is very comfortable. They have a wonderful garden and a few friendly animals that make it that much more enjoyable. It was actually extremely convenient to get to downtown using the D line.
856550,12696077,2014-05-08,14316518,Melody,"We had a fabulous time and really enjoyed the Little Green Cabin!  The ease of being off from the D line was great, we could go anywhere in Seattle and getting back was never a problem!  Jean was extremely helpful and responded quickly if we had any questions.  Whole Foods is just a couple minute walk, so it was easy to get anything we needed in a pinch, we hope to stay here again!!!"
856550,13039424,2014-05-18,9603611,David,One if my top airbnb experiences. The little green house was perfect and Jean-Marc knows what he is doing. It was delightful. 
856550,13249095,2014-05-23,11344605,Nefer,"A unique experience you won't find any where else in Seattle. As a person interested in tiny house and sustainable living, this was a such a DELIGHT.  And it was a true pleasure talking to J about how he got started building his very own Gypsy Wagon.

J and his family are genuinely kind people and the accommodations are excellent. The location is superb for getting around on public transit or grabbing food nearby just a few blocks away. 

I highly recommend."
856550,13488078,2014-05-28,6674121,Jessika,"Loved this cabin! Great place to stay! Wholefoods. Is just down the street, and the bus stop is a much walk away. A little far from seattle a center- but this cabin gives you a fresh breath of clean air and allows you to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city! I recommend staying here, you won't regret it! "
856550,13762329,2014-06-03,15680532,Ozgul & Mert,"We loved our stay at tiny cabin, it was amazing to wake up in a peaceful garden in  the middle of a city! Everything was very tidy and clean in living room, bathroom and cabin.Tiny cabin is well arranged, it is bright and feels spacious. Location is also good, just a few minutes from downtown by bus, and the bus stop is a minute away. We absolutely recommend everyone to stay at Jay's place and if I go to Seattle again, I will definitely stay there. "
856550,14027225,2014-06-10,2253492,Linda,A perfect garden retreat to come home to after busy days and nights doing performances in Queen Anne. Love the chickens and the bunny! Ditto what all the others said. Highly recommended.
856550,14203697,2014-06-14,16174664,Marc,Had a great time at Jean-Marc's place.  The cabin was wonderfully spaced and was in a great location.  Parking wasn't a problem at all either.  Would highly recommend this cabin as well to any interested! 
856550,14445866,2014-06-19,5642623,Lynn,We really enjoyed staying in the tiny garden cabin! There's easy access to downtown on the bus and if you head up the hill behind the house there's a really cute neighborhood with great views of the city to explore. While the tiny cabin is tiny (only slightly larger than the queen bed inside it) there's plenty of room in the main house to eat breakfast and relax before checking out the city. 
856550,14542631,2014-06-21,11385736,Rene,"This was a very enjoyable stay. Jean-Marc and family were very welcoming. Very cool to have chickens, a big bunny, garden, and music room, privacy and comfort so close to Seattle downtown. Whole Foods was a quick walk and a great place to get a meal. I will stay here again. "
856550,14687828,2014-06-24,5997096,Christopher,"Jean-Marc was a great host! He was really helpful and gave me some great pointers for my visit. The place was clean, cozy, and comfy. Great location if you want to spend some time downtown or in Queen Anne. Cute dogs!"
856550,14769926,2014-06-26,12097796,Rachel,The tiny cabin was very cozy and comfortable! Staying in the cabins offers guests privacy which is really nice. The common area in the main house is very well thought out and guests have their bathroom and area separate from the hosts.The location is awesome and access to public transportation is great. Jean is welcoming and very accommodating. 
856550,15396695,2014-07-08,14026250,Meg,"JM and Maggie are great hosts! We stayed in the tiny cabin over the 4th of July and had a great time! The cabin itself is neat as a pin and really comfortable. There's a big shared space inside to spread out and some cool swings to soak up the views in the backyard. The bus to downtown is right at the end of the street and there's plenty of free parking nearby. We loved Tribble, Betty and Mary Jane (so cute!) JM is a talented guy! Thank you so much for having us, I wish we could have stayed longer!"
856550,15593700,2014-07-12,416907,Rafael,"Great place, great host. The place is very clean, organized and quiet. The tiny cabin is very comfortable and the outside is great to relax with a really cool view. I definitely recommend it!"
856550,15759581,2014-07-15,14657667,Susanna,"I doubt that Jean-Marc is mortal; this airbnb is clearly run by an angel.  Our spot was immaculate and cool as hell.  Laid back but well-run.  An excellent location, especially if you like to EAT.  Our gypsy caravan neighbors were far enough away that we never heard them.  It was private and lovely.  I can't recommend this place highly enough.  "
856550,15893430,2014-07-17,17778029,Rich,"I had the best time staying in the ""Little Cabin"".  The bed was super comfy and private even though it is not far from a busy street.  The hosts were great to work with and very warm and friendly, and the guests were a lot of fun too.  There is a Whole Foods just a couple of blocks away which made it easy to grab a meal.  I had a wonderful time!"
856550,16246463,2014-07-24,14800862,HyaeJin,"Conveniently located in a nice, quiet neighborhood. The Tiny Cabin was, well, tiny :-) but super cute and clean. Loved our stay there!"
856550,16458516,2014-07-28,14738805,Sara,"Jean-Marc was very laid back and welcoming. He and his family provided a home like environment.He made himself available if we needed him without being intrusive. 
The space was wonderful, clean, and quiet. The house is very close to downtown and is right next to a bus route that we utilized durning our stay. The yard is well kept and nice to sit and read in or enjoy coffee while you watch the chickens in their coop or the sun rise. It was also nice to have internet to use to find places to eat and things to do.
We would definitely stay again and recommend it to others! Thank you Jean-Marc and family!"
856550,16718787,2014-08-01,14833465,Hector,"Everything was perfect for us: clean, confortable and well ubicated. It was really nice to enjoy the garden, the swing, the chickens..."
856550,16984849,2014-08-05,6819816,Nancy,"Had a wonderful three nights at the Tiny cabin. Jean-Marc was very amenable to our arrival time in Seattle and welcomed us to his home and cabin. Very comfortable stay with everything you would need, including comfortable bed, outdoor area and common spaces with coffee/tea. The bus right at the end of the street was very convenient even at night and on weekends. Would recommend a stay here!"
856550,17352650,2014-08-11,16886565,Daniel,"Jean welcomed us to a lovely space. Because of its orientation it would be really hard to get a photo of the interior without a special tilt-shift wide angle lens. We found it to be magically comfortable.

The chickens were too quiet for our taste but I'm sure most people would be pleased. We arrived to a full moon and unseasonably warm weather so conditions couldn't have been more pleasant.

There is a whole foods within walking distance and convenient bus service with the D line. Even the people at Staples were super friendly. We took a cruise and walked to the cruise terminal to board the ship on a trip to Alaska."
856550,17558819,2014-08-14,15966132,Alynia,"Staying in the Tiny Garden Cabin was an absolute delight. From the beginning to the end, Jean-Marc was so helpful and accommodating to our needs. He was quick to offer suggestions on transportation options and directions. He was also a joy to talk to in general. The room was perfectly clean and comfortable.  Guests were also provided with access to free coffee and tea in the main room, which made us feel even more at home. The location of the Tiny Garden Cabin was great as well; it was a very doable distance from downtown as well as other fun neighborhoods like Fremont. We got everywhere on public transportation just fine.  We are so glad we chose the Tiny Garden Cabin for our trip to Seattle -- wouldn't have had it any other way!"
856550,17714710,2014-08-16,3154611,Johaan,"Jean-Marc and Maggie were wonderful hosts. It's obvious that they really ""get"" what means most to somebody on the road. Their place is very clean, charming, has coffee/hot chocolate 24/7, and it's close to public transport. 
Our cabin felt very private, but if you wanted to hang on the living room/lobby or yard both were welcoming."
856550,18173919,2014-08-23,11588890,Tina,Jean-Marc was friendly and available to answer questions. The place was exaclty as described. 
856550,18332792,2014-08-25,18776703,Daniel,"Dope. Is the word that comes to mind when it comes to our stay here. It was truly an amazingly dope experience and stay. What more can I say about the man and his home. ""Labor of love"", accurately describes this cabin and land it sits on. The room was spacious for two, the living space was clean (bathroom, public safe, and yard), Jean and his family were very kind and welcoming, the cabin was far enough from the others that we didn't even hear the others. His place is near the D-line bus which was extremely convenient since it takes you to/near the Seattle Center, Pike Market, Undergound Seattle, and more. My only regret about the place was not being able to hang out with the Jay. He's truly an awesome man. 

Happy Jay, I didn't mention the bunny :D"
856550,18481571,2014-08-27,18331414,Henry,"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful time at Jean-Marc's tiny garden cabin. For our introduction to the city, it was in a good location and everything about the cabin and the shared space inside was comfortable and accommodating. Especially the pillows on the bed. 

All of JM's Airbnb listings (3 of them) are in the backyard, and there was a nice feeling of community back there, even though we didn't meet anyone else. We would definitely return to JM's on our next trip to Seattle!"
856550,18939194,2014-09-03,4611751,Sylvia,The location was very easy to find and extremely convenient to take public transit to downtown.  The room was nicely decorated and very clean.  
856550,19213569,2014-09-08,19070680,Allie,The tiny cabin was the best! It was plenty enough room for my very tall husband and myself. Far enough out of the hustle and bustle that we didn't feel overwhelmed but close enough that we didn't spend all of our time driving. I just can't do it justice the space is so wonderful.  
856550,20083274,2014-09-23,16748155,Andrea,"The cabin was exactly as described, very comfortable for my husband, small daughter and myself. Jay and his family were very welcoming - his little girl came in to say hi to our daughter a couple times which was adorable. Property is well located to get to lots of different neighborhoods in Seattle. We rode the bus most days of our 5 day stay and it was very easy and accessible. I would definitely recommend staying at Jay's and would stay again if the opportunity presents itself! Great property, great hosts, great experience. "
856550,20490073,2014-09-30,1458876,Michael,"I was greeted and helped with my luggage, oriented to the common area (bathroom, living area, refrigerator/microwave/coffee maker).  Because no one else was using it, I could leave my luggage there and just use the cabin for sleeping.  

Big positives:  Bus line both north and south is just a few steps away, a mile and a bit from Seattle Center.  Whole Foods is a block away.  The best sleeping of anyplace I've stayed in Seattle.  (If you use UBER the driver must know that the property can be accessed only from 15th Avenue.)  Good wireless, important to me.

Great spot, a bargain and quiet.  "
856550,22265531,2014-11-02,22767531,Jens,I really enjoyed my stay there. J was super nice and the room is really clean. I can definitely recommend this place.  
856550,22438003,2014-11-06,1527554,Jonathan,"A gem in the mist of Seattle!  Host was friendly, helpful and easy to reach when needed.  Highly recommended for anyone looking to experience the intimacy and charm of tiny-house living!  The Whole Foods down the block was super convenient.  Best airbnb ever!  "
856550,23015099,2014-11-20,20220657,Bryce,"Jean-Marc was wonderfully accommodating and willing to share his story of creating tiny spaces to rent out in his backyard in Queen Anne! The listing was very accurate, and Queen Anne is a cute walkable little area very close to Downtown."
856550,23243612,2014-11-26,22485529,Danielle,"I loved my stay in the cabin and would absolutely recommend it. I arrived incredibly late, and Jean was kind enough to still greet me. He had even turned on the heater in advanced for me which was a thoughtful touch. The room and bathroom were clean, and overall, the location was convenient. "
856550,23335851,2014-11-29,7129143,Marie,"We enjoyed our stay at the Tiny Garden Cabin. Arrival was smooth and easy. We had to arrive late at night and really appreciated that our host made it easy for us to do so by giving good instructions and preparing the cabin for a welcoming arrival: It was cheerfully lit, warm and clean. A cozy retreat on a winter night! We were visiting family for the holidays and really just required a place to sleep so didn't spend a lot of time at the cabin, but our experience was very positive and we are likely to stay there again. A unique and fun place to stay!"
856550,23842913,2014-12-12,16945579,Adam,"Amazing experience, highly recommended!"
856550,23960167,2014-12-15,13428836,Jaclyn,"Hands down my all time favorite AirBnB. You get total privacy in a beautiful space all your own, you're close to a bus stop, you're 15-20 min to downtown, 5 min from a grocery store, etc. I would definitely recommend bringing flip flops to walk to the bathroom though! "
856550,24333130,2014-12-26,23918006,Markos Flavio,Everything was awesome. Nice and warm place to stay in Seattle. Bus stop just one block away.
856550,24644997,2015-01-01,4050965,Sarah,"Jean Marc and Maggie's Garden Shed is awesome. It is private and warm in such a wonderful urban oasis. We had a wonderful time and the access to come and go without worry of disturbing Jean Marc and Maggie's family was perfect. Jean Marc and Maggie are incredible people and we are so glad we stayed here!

Even on the coldest night during our stay the room stayed nice and warm and although there is currently a new condo building going up down the block, the room was incredibly sound proof.

We are Seattlites that needed more beds when the family was in town for the holidays and it was exactly what we needed and more. We will definitely book again when we have out of town guests."
856550,24862752,2015-01-03,1770709,Nen Lin,"We had an extremely pleasant stay in the tiny garden cabin! It was quaint and just the right size for two people. The host was there to greet us when we arrived, and the cabin was all warm and cosy for us. We were very impressed with the cabin. It was well-insulated, so there were no cold drafts coming in from the outside, and we slept well for the two nights that we were there. Both the cabin and the bathroom were clean and well-maintained. Location is pretty convenient to a lot of the places we went to, whether it was downtown Seattle or the Fremont or Ballard neighborhoods."
856550,25265681,2015-01-11,20414619,Jeremy,I had an amazing time. Our host was very informative and friendly. Their family is extremely handy! The location is also prime. $10 Uber ride downtown. the tiny cabin was very cozy. Came with a very efficient heater.
856550,25417404,2015-01-15,8281408,Lauren,"Cute and cozy little room, lots of privacy. A 10-15 minute drive to the downtown, just across the street from Whole Foods. A fun experience!"
856550,26051283,2015-02-02,24769259,Kate,Stayed here with a friend for 3 nights and we loved it! We hope to be back to stay in a gypsy wagon soon. Thanks Jean-Marc!
856550,26152873,2015-02-05,13489378,Williamed,"Jean-Marc's place is really great. We stayed in the tiny cabin, but also in his garden are the two Gypsy wagons which he built (there absolutely amazing). The tiny cabin was perfect for us, its actually way bigger than it looks and the bed is great. Super cosy and really warm, its an ideal private little den to come and crash out in. The location is cool too, 20 minute bus ride to downtown, the stop is so close to this place. Also a wholefoods just within a 10 minute walk which was handy. Jean-Marc is a really pleasant guy too and will be really accomdating and helpful if you need any info or advice on Seattle. 

I would really recommend this place, its great value for money and so cosy and cool. "
856550,27058033,2015-02-24,7028239,Cindy,"Check in was easy and the host left the lights on and heater on for me. The bathroom is a few steps outside of the room and kept very tidy. I would definitely want to stay here again. The host provides towels,wash cloths and shampoo. The bed and bedding were very nice."
856550,27290621,2015-03-01,27925214,Jacade,"This tiny cabin was a perfect place to stay for us. Affordable and a great location. And even though it is kind of a communal area, we never once felt like we lacked privacy. Bathroom was very clean and room was very comfy. Those little heaters pack a punch, I think we even had to turn it off a few times. I think our favorite thing about staying here was the chickens and bunnies. Everytime you walk to the bathroom the bunnies are so social and poke their heads out to see you. If you are an individual who has a hard time being away from your fur family this is definitely a bonus.  Would not hesitate to stay here again. Great space, thank you!"
856550,27469739,2015-03-05,11536605,Adrienne,"My husband and I were so happy with our stay at the Tiny Garden cabin.  We were greeted upon walking up and welcomed into the backyard with smiles.  The yard is fantastic.  The chickens were out on the hill, and the two gypsy wagons are there lined up in all their glory.   The walk to the bathroom is a quick one with a couple of bunnies on the way to say hello to.  The shared bathroom is nice and very clean making it seem as though it's not shared at all.  The photos and description of the place are spot on and as expected.  There were no surprises.  The room was simple and clean.  The bed is very comfy and the room kept it's heat really well.  We had the heater on just until the room heated up and then didn't need to turn it on until morning to get us out of bed.  We were in and out as we pleased and didn't hear a peep from the other renters.  They seemed just as cozy to stay in as we were.  As stated by most, this place is close to everything.  We had a rental car and were able to get to downtown, Capitol Hill, Magnolia, Freemont and Ballard with ease.   Such a unique place and experience.  Needless to say we will definitely be staying here next time we visit.  "
856550,27805429,2015-03-12,27952979,Daniel,"Everything about the Garden Cabin was as advertised and wonderful! Jean-Marc was helpful and friendly, and the cabin/bathroom were tremendously cozy and clean! Only suggestion would be to bring slippers for the trip between cabin and bathroom. Well insulated, heated, and quiet. (Plus chickens and rabbits!)"
856550,27909697,2015-03-14,20519650,Mariah And Ian,"Our stay in the garden cottage was superb!! Jean Marc went above and beyond to make sure our stay was comfortable for us and our newborn baby. Great location and view in the heart of Seattle, clean and well maintained, friendly hosts! Can't wait to come back for another stay!"
856550,28083947,2015-03-17,11262648,Kim,"My stay at the Tiny Garden Cabin in Seattle was wonderful! The bed was comfy and the place was extremely cute. I enjoyed saying hi to the rabbit on my way to the restroom and seeing the chickens near the side gate. The location is wonderful, right in between downtown and other districts, like Fremont and Ballard. It was about a $9 lyft/uber ride from downtown and the same for Fremont (where the troll, breweries, and gas works park is located). There's a Whole Foods that is walking distance and it was overall a cool place to stay. Thank you!"
856550,28259511,2015-03-21,27554782,Savannah,The description is very accurate. This little cabin is adorable and very conveniently located! We walked to Whole Foods twice and took the bus line to downtown so that we didn't have to drive and find parking. I would definitely stay here again! 
856550,28478006,2015-03-24,8129634,Tracey,"My stay at this Tiny Garden cabin was SO easy. I appreciated the removed location from the rest of the household, so that I could come in very late after a night of dancing and sleep til noon if I needed to. The shower had nice water pressure and the herbs and chickens made it all very quaint."
856550,28879213,2015-03-31,5407327,Tara,"Adorable and cozy location with all the basics you need.  A little tricky for cabs to find, but once you get the hang of how to tell them where you are it works.  Just enough storage space in the cabin itself, and super warm and cozy within minutes with a space heater (provided).  If I were re-booking I might stay somewhere with an attached bathroom, but that's just because I'm very pregnant at the moment and prefer easy access to the facilities.

"
856550,29050191,2015-04-03,28417082,Josef,Very nice and cozy cabin. Uncomplicated check in and check out. We were very satisfied.
856550,29836595,2015-04-13,28526478,Katie,"The quaintest of places on Queen Anne hill. Walking to Whole Foods across the way was perfect for breakfast and hopping on the bus to downtown was easy. Such a cute little garden home, very clean and quiet. Very friendly and welcoming family - overall a fantastic weekend getaway. "
856550,30049799,2015-04-16,30848344,Anne,"The tiny garden cabin is perfect in every way.  Jean-Marc is gracious and unobtrusive; I had very little interaction with him by choice.  The cabin is clean and cozy and was just right for my stay.  

The trip to the bathroom at night was fine, even in the rain, just about 15 steps from the door of the cabin.  The bathroom was clean and well kept.  I didn't have to share as none of the other rentals were booked while I was there.  I don't think it would have been a big deal if anyone had been there, though.

The location is extremely convenient in Seattle, you can get downtown or to Ballard in minutes by car.  A quick walk up the hill onto Queen Anne and you are treated to world class views of Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains.  

What can I say about the bunnies? They are extremely adorable and friendly and pretty much put your visit over the top."
856550,30316603,2015-04-20,21563844,Kara,This was airbnb was in the perfect location. There was no trouble with parking and the directions were very clear. It had everything we needed for our weekend stay.
856550,30620681,2015-04-25,12880554,Elsie,I had a very pleasant stay at the Tiny Garden cabin. It was perfect with the bus line to get into the city and Whole foods supplied me with meals. The bed was comfortable. I had only a few interactions with Jean but all were very nice. 
856550,30886899,2015-04-28,23534148,Rebeckah,"Wonderful. JM is welcoming, flexible, resourceful and kind. We had a great stay, and are continuing to have a great stay, as we've moved into the Garage Suite!"
856550,31455779,2015-05-05,30496594,Jillian,Staying in the Tiny garden cabin was perfect. The location is definitely ideal. Easy to get downtown and the whole foods a block away fed us on a couple of occasions. The hosts are very friendly and let us keep to ourselves. Their daughter is incredibly adorable as well as Betty their pug. The bathroom is shared but very clean. Overall our experience was wonderful and I would highly suggest staying here. 
856550,31620576,2015-05-07,16753389,Alicia,"Jean-Marc was extremely welcoming. The tiny garden cabin is adorable, in an area that super accessible to Ballard, Belltown, downtown, Queen Anne. Tucked into the back of the yard, it is a quiet, peaceful place to stay! The room and bathroom were modern, clean and comfortable. There was a mix-up in my reservation on my part but Jean-Marc was extremely kind and accommodating. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anybody!"
856550,31918293,2015-05-11,4849536,Garrett,Marc was amazing! Very humble! Loved all the hand crafted wood work he did. He is very easy to approach with questions and loves his work. Would definitely stay again
856550,32551026,2015-05-19,24172606,Adam,Jean was very attentive but not intrusive. Cabin was neat and comfortable. Location was easy to access downtown Seattle. Would absolutely stay again or recommend to a friend 
856550,32959152,2015-05-24,13942005,Rachel,Great room and facilities. Nice to stay out of the city centre but have such easy access to it. Love the access to whole foods too
856550,33665919,2015-05-31,2058498,Krista,"My experience at Jean Marc's Tiny cabin in Queen Anne was nothing short of fantastic.  This was my only my second air bnb experience, and I couldn't be happier. Such a great deal for the price ~ excellent location with convenient access to public transportation; yet close enough to the city.  Such a unique experience.  Cute property and Jean Marc is an amazing host ~ I thoroughly enjoyed my stay, cabin was clean, comfortable, exactly as described.  Exceptional value! Will definitely recommend to friends in the future."
856550,33937360,2015-06-02,381347,Sara,Jean Marc was friendly and very kind. We enjoyed our location and visiting Seattle very much! thank you
856550,34093097,2015-06-04,1924433,Mark,"We loved our stay in the tiny garden cabin! It was very comfortable and private, and overall neat place to stay. The location was good and it was convenient to a nice bus line. Id absolutely stay again."
856550,34472599,2015-06-08,940446,Hunter,"My wife and I had a fantastic stay at the Tiny Garden cabin.  Jean-Marc, and his family, were kind and gracious hosts and took the time to give us great recommendations on what to do in Seattle and the surrounding area.  The Tiny Garden cabin was exactly as described in the listing - it was comfortable, clean and full of character.  The location is great - an easy jumping off point to get downtown or explore awesome neighborhoods like Ballard and Whole Foods is just down the street for groceries, breakfast etc...   It was a great way to experience Seattle."
856550,34802062,2015-06-12,13795606,Vincent,Jean was a wonderful host. His down to earth attitude and innovation in the tiny house market within Airbnb is on the up. Looking forward to seeing him and his family expand their business ideas because of Airbnb.
856550,35086380,2015-06-15,706713,Nancy,"Wonderful, quaint and inviting.  Jean-Marc was the perfect host.  He welcomed us upon arrival and was available if we had questions during our stay.  The Tiny Garden cottage was very clean and comfortable.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay again!"
856550,35355011,2015-06-17,482151,Nic,Accurate description
856550,35509943,2015-06-19,35488168,Michael,"This place feels like a happy little hobbit town in the confines of a backyard. Jay was super-friendly. I love the little signs everywhere, the rabbits, chickens, and dog. It's a pretty perfect little spot. The only thing is there aren't any places to eat or drink in the immediate area. Not a big deal. I would love to stay here again. "
856550,35940783,2015-06-23,9523191,Jennifer,"This tiny green cabin is a perfect nest for a deep rest.  I will not forget the special qualities of this stay and hate to spoil the lovely surprises for future guests.  The bed is extremely comfortable, it was easy to find and very easy to be very comfortable for the 5 days I was there."
856550,36437912,2015-06-28,35412714,Quest,"An excellent minimal place to stay with a friendly host. I was staying in Seattle and touring during the day and this suited my needs well.

The ability to come in late without disturbing the host or other guests was one of my favorite parts about this location. The beautiful, quiet little garden area that this cabin is situated in is another excellent pro to this listing."
856550,36671695,2015-06-30,31992940,Aggie,Jean-Marc was very friendly and answered the questions that we had. The listing itself was just as described and we most certainly enjoyed our stay here. 
856550,37000362,2015-07-03,7485789,Julian,"Pros: The location is pretty good, close to Queen Anne and Ballard, and the yard and space in which you stay is very nice and clean.

Cons: For the price that you pay to stay here, the level of hospitality feels pretty... begrudging. For instance: When I arrived, it was probably 90 degrees and I asked for a glass for water, and the response that I got was, ""sorry, we don't share our kitchen."" As if lending me a cup for a weeklong stay is somehow equivalent to full access to the kitchen. Eventually, I found plastic cups in a drawer, but there was no mention of it by the host. Also, the shower is times for about 7 or 8 minutes, which again seems really stingy for $75/night. Overall, I would not stay here again."
856550,37180322,2015-07-05,17687711,Christina,"Jean-Marc met us when we arrived and showed us to his beautiful backyard space. Our tiny garden cabin was clean and inviting. The location is very good and we were able to take very reasonably-priced, short Uber rides around Seattle to visit numerous different neighborhoods."
856550,37582744,2015-07-08,7878856,Maggie,It was the perfect place to stay in Seattle. We enjoyed the space as well as the chickens and bunnies! Jean-Marc was very welcoming and made sure to be accessible but scarce. We would definitely stay there again.
856550,37850857,2015-07-11,15344528,Jennifer,Jean-Marc was welcoming and friendly. The tiny Garden cabin was just right.  The house is located off a main road which made it easy to get to downtown Seattle as well as Ballard.  
856550,38262134,2015-07-14,31180363,Alex,"Met the hosts after we got settled in, they were very nice. The neighborhood was quiet."
856550,38621061,2015-07-17,32385538,Travis,Jean-Marc was an excellent host and we felt very comfortable during our visit. He was very kind and we enjoyed every interaction we had with him. The listing is in a perfect location and the animals on the property are absolutely adorable. We will definitely be back to enjoy ourselves again!
856550,39030362,2015-07-20,5336983,Kyle,"Nice host, space was as described. When we lacked a hairdryer they ran out and got one right away. Definitely recommend."
856550,39929071,2015-07-27,29573165,Kristen,"I had a great experience in the Tiny Cabin, and I am glad my first experience with Airbnb was so nice. The check in process was exactly as laid out in the house manual, super easy. The cabin was clean and had everything I needed for my stay: a comfy bed, clean sheets and towels, a fan, and a lamp. At first I was worried that I would be too hot, but the fan was enough, even on the lowest setting. I loved the property, and the location was convenient for the bus. The chickens and bunnies in the back yard were so fun! I never had any issues with the shared bathroom, it was always open when I needed it. I saw the hosts once, right when I arrived, but not again during my stay. The physical manual in the cabin was helpful. I had a great time, and no complaints at all. I would absolutely stay there again!"
856550,40339524,2015-07-30,35987128,Jake,Jean's place was great! We stayed in the small cabin and it was so nice. Jean and his wife were awesome as well. We chatted with them a bit when we arrived and he showed us around. The bathroom was super clean as well. Our first morning there a different guest clogged the toilet and just wrote out of order. We told Jean and his wife and they cleaned it up right away. They were very appreciative of us letting them know the toilet was clogged. I would stay there again in a heart beat
856550,40670192,2015-08-01,20488068,Austin,Great place. Room was not big but more than adequate for two people. Everything was clean and (website hidden) was a great host. Chickens and bunnies were great!
856550,40950406,2015-08-03,1528774,Scott,"This listing was exactly as described.  The bed was comfortable and the shared bathroom was clean and well thought out.  If you want to use public transportation, this is a very easy place.  This was an interesting place to stay and suited my needs well."
856550,41925486,2015-08-10,30232385,Jay,"This little hobbit house was perfect!  Jean-Marc is a very creative and accommodating host.  The atmosphere is relaxed and fun - a few rabbits (called Tribbles!) and a few chickens in a fenced in area near the cabin add an even more comforting experience.  The area is easy to use, private enough, and beautiful.  The view and location is perfect and I cannot wait to reserve a spot next year for Ti6.  Jean-Marc and his family are wonderful hosts and I would recommend any of his rentals to my closest family. "
856550,42348694,2015-08-12,40688846,Julie,"A great place--Jean-Marc is the perfect host, and it's a wonderful location. We enjoyed staying in the Tiny Garden Cottage, everything was clean and comfortable, and the gypsy wagons made the experience unique. Very convenient to downtown and the waterfront--just a quick bus ride. If we ever visit Seattle again, we would absolutely like to stay at Jean-Marc's AirBnB again. A perfect place to stay in the city."
856550,43271474,2015-08-18,39038517,Scott,"Jean-Marc was waiting for us when we arrived.  He took us back to the cabin and showed us around.  The neighborhood was perfect for everything that we wanted to, site seeing at the city center, geocaching in Ballard and close to the reason we came to Seattle.  For the hours that we kept it was nice that we did not have to go through the house.  We had an issue with the bathroom light fuse but a quick text took care of that.  We should have asked for another set of towels as there isn't a place to really let them dry out during the day, but that is our own fault because Jean-Marc did say to just ask if we need anything.  The one complaint we do have is that there is no place to put luggage out of the way.  It was either on the bed or on the floor.  The fan cooled the room down quickly at night.  There is tons of parking and it was very well lit at night.  We felt comfortable leaving our vehicle parked all day while we geocached with friends.  Just a few blocks away there is dining area with some awesome restaurants.    We would highly recommend "" How to Cook a Wolf"".  We could not have asked for a better set up for our needs/"
856550,43865403,2015-08-22,36719469,Peter,Great space! The tiny cabin was as big as two people would need and the environment was super fun (make sure to pet the rabbits). The host was there when you needed but made sure not to be overly intrusive. Definitely would recommend.
856550,44800863,2015-08-29,39643647,Amanda,We had a great experience at the tiny cabin. Very welcoming host and willing to answer any questions we may have had. Good location easy to get to and close to city transport if needed.
856550,45099747,2015-08-31,16853688,Kristen,"Great experience here, close to the city without really being *in* the city. Our tiny cabin was cozy, clean, and comfortable. Loved the fan in the room - great white noise and air circulation. Easy communication with Jean Marc although we did not meet. Would stay again!"
856550,45503576,2015-09-03,18839157,Cassie,"The tiny house was an adorable and unique experience! We never met the hosts, but had everything we needed and easy access to our room. Thanks again!"
856550,45820022,2015-09-06,40606865,Cole,"The cabin was just as described in the posting, if not better. The shower/bathroom were clean and well maintained."
856550,46125734,2015-09-08,8386513,Patrick,"Host did a great job working around our arrival timing. Great little space. Exactly what we were looking for. Warm and cozy little cabin in a great neighborhood. Near everything, but quiet. "
856550,49103737,2015-10-01,37995109,Lynn,"The perfect little cottage! Fresh towels and greeting us at the door was amazing! Truly cannot reccommend this place enough, it was the perfect cabin to stay in. Close to great places to eat, plenty of parking, and the animals were such a cute touch! "
856550,49327736,2015-10-03,5553099,Kate,"This was such a beautiful place to stay! The tiny cabin was adorable in every way and equally as cozy. The bed was surprisingly VERY comfortable and we slept (website hidden) was very quick to help when I let him know that there was an issue with the the lamp. Great space and great use of land. Plus, there are chickens and bunnies on not that far from where you sleep :)"
856550,49611859,2015-10-05,3693692,Lisa,"The Tiny Garden Cabin provided an ideal resting spot. When I first arrived, the lights were on and it was warm inside. Everything was very clean and comfortable. Check-in was easy and flexible. The bed was perfect and I had a restful sleep. I spent most of my time at the Seattle Center for a tea festival, and the Rapid D line bus nearby was  helpful and quick. This place suited my needs perfectly - thank you Jean-Marc! I will recommend this place to friends. "
856550,51203921,2015-10-18,27556592,Ryan,This is a nice cozy space and exactly as described on Jean Marc's page. 
856550,51442803,2015-10-20,41861523,Tyler,"Even without the host being there, I felt welcome because of the well-lit signs and the arrows telling where to go. When we arrived, our cabin was well lit and open. While the cabin was small, it was exactly what we wanted. The bed was extremely comfortable and the sheets were sooo soft. The chickens and bunnies were a really nice touch and we enjoyed visiting with them on our way in and out of the cabin. The shared bathroom was clean and bright. 

If you are looking for somewhere to stay in Seattle, I would definitely recommend the Tiny Garden Cabin. It definitely is tiny, but if you want to experience the city and have somewhere cozy and relaxing to stay at night, this is the place to be. We loved it, and if we are ever back in Seattle, we will stay here again in a heartbeat!"
856550,52120854,2015-10-26,44671022,Catherine,"This is such a great spot. The cabin was immaculately clean and the bed was super comfortable. Bathroom is a short walk, but well lit path at night. I never met the host but he was very gracious and quick to respond via text or message. I was in and out of the Seattle area with hiking and trail running for about 5 days and Jean Marc was very flexible when I asked if I could stay a few extra days after I changed plans last minute. It is also very close to the market, downtown and great restaurants. I come back to Seattle again for sure and I will definitely stay here again!!!"
856550,52771812,2015-11-01,15637552,India,"We loved this very private, conveniently located, quiet, adorable cabin. Comfy bed, clean bathroom, fun place to stay. Thank you!"
856550,54764402,2015-11-23,48263921,Heather,"The cabin was so cute. It was clean and inviting, romantic and charming and very convenient for buses downtown etc. I didn't personally get to meet the host but my boyfriend met Maggie and her daughter and said they seemed like great people. We will definitely be back. Thanks yall! "
856550,55491371,2015-12-01,20585082,Susan,This was a great clean and cozy place to stay. It was easy to find. There is bus stop at the bottom of the hill with an express bus that will take you back and forth to the downtown area. Breakfast and coffee were easy to find two blocks away at the Whole Foods. If you get a chance explore the neighborhood above the host's property. The spectacular views of the bay and houses are something to see.   It was rather cool when we got to the Airbnb the host had a little heater on before we got there  so the room was cozy when we got there.
856550,56097833,2015-12-08,1639224,Jason,"Awesome cabin and backyard! Really cool vibe, I can't wait to visit again. I felt like I was glamping ;)"
856550,58189986,2016-01-01,39168808,Mari,"I had a great experience with JM. He greeted my boyfriend and I at the door when we arrived and provided everything we need for our stay in the room. The place was very adorable with the bunnies and chickens around. I highly recommend  checking the cabin out. The only downside is the separate restroom because we went during the winter. It was cold! Besides that, everything was great! The view from Queen Anne is amazing at night!"
7243974,42005888,2015-08-10,23127884,Matt,"This house, location, and the host communication were all perfect. A very nice walk down to green lake. I highly recommend this location to anyone who likes to walk around the neighborhood they are staying in. "
7243974,45476816,2015-09-03,38187190,Dawn,"Our host, Nick, was  very hospitable and welcoming and easy to work with.  The house is clean and neat,  cozy and comfortable.  The neighborhood is mostly residential with some neat restaurants within walking distance - The Dish, Café Lulu to name two.  All in all, a very enjoyable experience."
7243974,45954210,2015-09-07,37190840,Natasha,Nick provided everything we needed for a lovely stay in Seattle. A plethora of information was left on what to see/where to eat. The house was clean and comfortable. Nice neighborhood within walking distance of the park and Rain City Burgers for an awesome meal! 
7243974,46401717,2015-09-10,41114513,Molly,"Great location, lovely little house, everything clean, user friendly and inviting. Great communication with the host. Great experience!"
7243974,57931729,2015-12-30,22043506,Claire,"Nick's house was perfect for what we were looking for. It is eclectically decorated and sweet. We loved the kitchen and ate breakfast there every morning. The area is so easy - close to i5 and just a short drive to downtown Seattle. Nick was amazing to coordinate with throughout the whole trip, he even left a little care package for us. Would highly recommend this house for anything looking to stay in Seattle. "
74328,292087,2011-05-31,586266,Magda,"Angela was wonderful, and her place is lovely!  It was the perfect size and felt just like home during our weekend in Seattle.  Great neighbors, too!  :)  We will definitely be in touch with her again next time we need a place!"
74328,300899,2011-06-06,248821,Candice,"Angela's home was amazing!  Very clean and quiet and centrally located.  There was a nice pizza shop down stairs and several stores in the neighborhood to grab food.  The neighborhood was safe and easy to move about.  

The condo was really lovely and cozy!  I would def stay here next time in Seattle .. if Angela would have me

Candice"
74328,351715,2011-07-04,671407,Oletta,"Angela's place is amazing! The pictures don't do it justice. I love that it was close to a park and to everything in the downtown area without having to use the highway.

Angela was also great providing a list of recommended places for breakfast  and dinner. This was perfect for me since I'd never been to Seattle.

I hope to stay here again the next time I visit Seattle if her space is available."
74328,361201,2011-07-08,240951,Maud,"We spent a wonderful time in Seattle! The studio was nice and clean, very personnalised. We could communicate easily with Angela who answered to all our mails. The view from the deck is absolutly great!"
74328,375840,2011-07-16,626528,Melissa,Angela's place is perfect. It is located in a great neighborhood. It is a very secure building and the underground parking was a real bonus. We loved the roof top patio and the view! 
74328,392680,2011-07-24,647903,Matt,"Angela's place was exactly what we were looking for.  It was in a great location for us to explore surrounding areas, came with parking, and was really clean, tidy and comfortable.  The studio was tastefully decorated, and really made us feel at home.  Oh, and the deck on the roof isn't half bad either! ;-)

It's walking distance to many amenities, such as a supermarket and drug store, and only a short drive to the freeway to explore further afield.  It's also close by to many bus routes that will have you downtown in around 10 minutes.

Angela made contact multiple times to see how things were going, and if we needed any help, and kindly left us a list of useful information for things going on nearby.

Thanks for a great week!"
74328,411356,2011-08-01,759055,Joseph,Wonderful place in perfect spot. Great view of downtown and very comfortable condo. Thanks for the memories. 
74328,420986,2011-08-05,609221,Bronwyn,"This place was a lovely, quiet haven at the end of each busy day of sightseeing around Seattle.  It suited our needs and met all our expectations - both in terms or its amenities and its location. 

It was a very convenient distance from the Amtrak (train) station and International district / Chinatown.  

We are happy to recommend this to anyone who is looking for a comfortable, stylish place to stay in easy reach of Seattle downtown.  "
74328,432304,2011-08-09,824278,Daniel,Angela made staying in her condo very easy and comfortable.  My party had a wonderful time in Seattle.  
74328,457187,2011-08-19,531390,Chris,"Clean, nicely decorated studio.  Building sits within walking distance to Lake Washington- if you can handle walking the hills.  Comfortable for two."
74328,468810,2011-08-23,710318,Karen,"My family and I really enjoyed our 2 night stay here. Comfortable and inviting accommodations, a convenient location, and Angela was the sweetest most helpful host. She recommended local places to eat (Portage Bay was our favorite!) and things to do with the kids. She had a parking spot for us, but we found that it was easier to just park on the street in front of the building entrance. Lots of street parking available. I took off a star because that weekend the elevator went out and the service company wasn't available until Monday, so we had to carry our kids up and down 5 flights of stairs. Angela was great about it and there was nothing more she could have done for us, but it was inconvenient."
74328,486906,2011-08-30,705249,George,"Angela's condo was convient and cozy.  While we did not meet Angela, she provided a helpful information sheet with neighborhood restaurant and bar suggestions.  One surprise, completely beyond Angela's control, is that we arrived in Seattle during a late August ""heat wave"" and her condo, like so many others in Seattle, is not air conditioned.  The fan helped, but it was toasty at night.

Should also mention that the condo was decorated with real flair.  Thank's Angela!"
74328,524067,2011-09-12,970348,Justin,Angela is an excellent host and made sure that we were completely satisfied when staying in her condo.  Her apartment is very clean and neat which is also very nice when traveling away from home.  I also thought the check-in/out process was very smooth and easy and the location was great.  I would highly recommend her space for anyone traveling to Seattle. 
74328,571622,2011-09-26,340337,Christina,"Angela's place was delightful -- exactly what was needed for a comfortable 2 night stay at the end of summer.The condo was clean and well appointed with great kitchen supplies, nice big towels, and great bedding. The A/V setup is also very simple and good for connecting a laptop and watching streaming video. The rooftop deck offered a stellar view with comfortable seating options. We didn't see Angela, but the key pick-up and drop-off were really easy. Overall, it was a great stay and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it and to stay here again."
74328,589829,2011-10-02,460258,Mario,"A estadia foi muito boa.
O apartamento e amplo, muito bem situado,com garagem,Wifi e todo equipado
Absolutamente 100%
Nao tive o prazer de conhecer Angela que estava viajando, porem ela deixou tudo organizado
O apartamento e proximo de tudo, e em linha reta com o Centro de Seattle
"
74328,766744,2011-12-05,1103588,Jenny,The host canceled my reservation 8 days before arrival.
74328,1648249,2012-07-07,2322533,Gaylene,It was a great experience.  a few glitches which were taken care of quickly.  Check in and out was simple.  My experience was great!  thanks Angela
74328,2168090,2012-09-02,2112023,Cammy,"Angela was a great host!  My daughter loved the condo, location, and availablitiy of Angela.  The condo was clean, well furnished, and safe.  My daughter loved the convenience of the parking garage.  Thanks!"
74328,2190897,2012-09-04,1280695,Novella,"Angela's place was very comfortable, clean and well furnished. Bedding was great and everything we could have possibly needed was provided, there was even a parking spot available to us in the garage. 
The studio is located in a very quiet and safe neighborhood. There is a bus stop right across the street (you can reach downtown in just 10 minutes!), while Lake Washington and the International District are at walking distance. Angela is a great host, she gave us recommendations on restaurants and bars and although she was not there, she managed to make check-in very easy. Don't miss the view from the rooftop!"
74328,2334568,2012-09-18,1163421,Gilda,"We had a great stay at Angela's designer condo.   It was located near the downtown area and easily accessible from the airport.  It was just the right size for a pleasant stay in Seattle.  Angela's instructions were clear and concise and her recommendations for local events, restaurants and bars were great.    The neighborhood was lovely and you get a very nice view of the Seattle skyline from the window.  Thank you!!!  Gilda and Ken"
74328,2395534,2012-09-24,1342274,Imran,"Angela had a beautiful property in an extremely convenient location.
The place was beautiful, the wifi was fast and accessible, and the location could not be beat. 

You should definitely stay with Angela when you're around Seattle. "
74328,2426771,2012-09-27,130032,Dave,"Two of us stayed here 3 nights.  It was perfect for our needs.  It was our ""headquarters"" while visiting Seatte.  Everything was very neat,  clean and complete.  Not wanting to drive, our car was secure in the garage and we caught the bus 1 block away and in no time were downtown.  The unit had everything (and more) we needed and the bed was very comfortable.  We did not meet Angela, but she was the perfect host: complete instructions, common sense rules and emergency contact (which we did not need).  We would definitly stay here again. "
74328,2705679,2012-10-24,3614330,Michael,"When we moved to Seattle we needed a place to stay until the movers arrived. This place was perfectly located. 5 minutes to our new house, walking distance to everything or just take the bus. Angela provided good instructions, tips for local spots to eat and the place was neat and clean. Did I mention the roof top terrace with view of the Seattle skyline? Parking? Don't worry, there's a garage for that. The most important thing though was quick and clear communication."
74328,2753266,2012-10-29,1653066,Herra,"Check-in was easy, communication with host was good, very clean unit (shoes off!), would highly recommend! Ample room for 2-3, probably even 4 if one slept on the (website hidden) gets about 3 channels (mainly FOX)."
74328,2826742,2012-11-07,2121374,Sabrina,"Cute condo/apartment. Perfect space for 2. Has a great view from the room as well as from the roof. Pubic transportation is literally steps from the door. Downtown can easily be reached with a 20 min bus ride. Clean space with all the amenities you may need (towels, pots, pans, dishware, stove, fridge).Clean space. Comfy bed. Angela was great in communicating with us and answering any questions we had. Only downside to the stay was the lack of television/cable. Angela does not have cable nor tv channels but does provide an HDMI cord for your use. Wish we had known that prior to renting the space but other then that the space was great!"
74328,2941348,2012-11-22,3946669,Sara,"Angela's condo was just what I was looking for - good value, great quality, comfortable, good location - and more! I'd come back for sure. "
74328,2968108,2012-11-26,3977163,Mary,Angela was wonderful to work with. The condo is very nice and worked out very well for us. Would highly recommend. 
74328,3075704,2012-12-11,1539078,Alex,"Nice and clean apartment ! The host was very helpful, thank you Angela !"
74328,3692541,2013-03-04,445633,Gary,What a great use of space!  Beautiful  appointments.  Bus across the street.  Hostess was not in town so didn't get to meet with her. 
74328,4179824,2013-04-16,1513758,Justin,"I stayed at Angela's place for an entire month. It's a really nice and cozy place! The kitchen has everything you need and has full sized appliances that work perfectly. The bathroom is great with washer and dryer built right into the unit. The bed is super comfortable! Most importantly, the place was spotless clean and organized for my arrival. I cannot tell you how nice it was to have such a considerate and professional host like Angela. I would definitely stay there again. Thank you!"
74328,4551802,2013-05-12,5958806,Roland,"Stayed in Seattle for 1 week, the condo was everything we could have asked for (and more!). With the bus stop a stones throw away, beautiful view from the rooftop, and many other amenities as part of our reservation, it made our trip an experience to remember. The bed was very comfortable, the place had cozy furnishings & decor, and the bathroom was clean with the shower having a great shower head (yes i critique these at hotels!). We eventually rented a car, and the parking garage was accessible w/ direct access to the elevator. The host made regular follow ups, which made everything flow very smoothly. 10/10 would reserve again!"
74328,4658834,2013-05-19,737615,Beth,"We stayed in this facility for a week. It was an ideal location for us: close to family, downtown and the bus. We noticed there were lots of personal traveler extras available and the kitchen was stocked with spices and condiments. A washer/dryer is a great plus. The bed was very comfortable and there is plenty of space for two in this nicely furnished studio. All areas were clean. The building is quiet. Angela's instructions were very detailed and she responded to communications in a reasonable timeframe. There is no cable TV, but that did not matter. The garage is secure and there is a great view from the roof deck. Who could ask for anything more? We will definitely use this property when we return to Seattle. Thank you, Angela. You are a wonderful Host."
74328,7688032,2013-09-30,4690389,Christine,"Staying here was so great! It's in a wonderful location - so close to all the areas I wanted to check out in Seattle, and walking down to the waterfront (and back up) was such great exercise. The studio itself was spacious and wonderfully furnished and decorated. The neighbors were friendly and helpful as well, and are very quite. Renting it out during the summer is a great idea - the roof is wonderful for tanning and relaxing, and barely anyone is up there. Little perks like having an underground parking garage was nice as well. All in all, super great place to stay, there really aren't any downfalls whatsoever!! "
74328,8477685,2013-11-02,6513458,Chris,I stayed in Angela's place for a month during my rotation at Swedish. Her place is very spacious and having a washer and dryer was a huge plus! Pizza place 4 stories down with great food and beer. Very clean and Angela was quick to respond with any questions I had. I would recommend her place to any of my friends!
74328,8612938,2013-11-08,3746169,Irene,"Had a very good stay in this Condo! The place was very neat and clean. Everything we needed was there. (washing machine, dryer, iron machine, good kitchen etc.) Downtown was very good reachable with the bus. But also by feet. I enjoyed the environment with all the parks that were nearby. 
Also try the good pizza tent below! Only thing was that we didn't had any wifi. The signal was not strong enough to use it with our ipad/notebook. But who needs internet when your in the Seattle! ;-)"
74328,11399905,2014-04-01,7116902,Vincent,Great place and great location!  Angela is also very prompt to reply.  I've stayed in a few places in Seattle and this one is the beat.
74328,12398704,2014-05-01,6867781,Justin,The condo was great. Very easy to get downtown. Probably wouldn't walk around the neighbourhood too much at night. The condo was clean and exactly what we were looking for. Only problem was the wifi. We were expected to use the pizza restaurants wifi but it was very slow and hard to get a strong signal. Other than that we had a very good stay and loved what Seattle had to offer.
74328,18781135,2014-09-01,12156392,Kaela,"My husband and I stayed here for 4 months and had a positive experience. Angela was a great host who was flexible and scheduled another cleaning appointment after an initial mix up. The condo is a little small for 2 people, but wouldn't be bad for a short term visit. We both enjoyed how close the condo was to downtown Seattle and it allowed us to explore the surrounding areas as well. "
74328,18927262,2014-09-02,20569070,Alfred,"I needed a last minute room in Seattle. On such short notice, I really did not expect to find anything very good. I found this place, and was very happily surprised. The host accommodated me in my giant hurry, and I had an amazing time int he city, and saved a lot of money by staying here. "
74328,18954997,2014-09-03,381087,David,"We enjoyed our stay at Angela's condo. The pictures perfectly describe her place. Very clean, easy and flexible check-in, and just a short drive from downtown."
74328,20599275,2014-10-02,9451108,Tori,"My husband and I stayed at Angela's condo for about a month, and found it very nice and comfortable. (The pictures she has posted here are very accurate.) We did not get to meet Angela in person, as she was out of town; however, we had no problems at all checking in and getting keys, etc.

The space was neat and clean, with plenty of room for luggage, etc. It is a studio condo, so it was snug, but really very cozy for just the two of us. The bathroom is very spacious, which was a nice surprise, and having a washer and dryer in the unit was really fantastic, given the length of our stay. The kitchen was equipped with basically everything you'd need for cooking, give or take a few items. We really appreciated that the fridge was pretty much empty, so we could do plenty of grocery shopping and cook meals, etc. the whole month. Garage parking was very nice to have, as was the rooftop deck--great view. The pizza place downstairs was also awesome--very friendly staff and delicious food. Across the board, Angela's condo was really very comfortable and we had no problems at all during our stay! 

The neighborhood right around the condo is not really what I would describe as a walking area; however, a very short drive or a bit of a walk toward the east, there is a very nice waterfront area with a Starbucks, some restaurants, and a nice little local grocery. There's also a park and nice walkway along the water. We also liked the Madrona neighborhood, which is just a bit north. Nice restaurants, cute little shops, etc. Great small neighborhood feel in the big city. The condo is also just a quick drive or ride into downtown, if that's what you're looking for.

Angela was great to ""work"" with, and completely on top of things. She provided a nice itinerary for us well ahead of time, with check-in instructions and recommendations for places to eat, visit, etc. There was a tiny hiccup with the cleaners cancelling just before we checked in, but Angela had this taken care of in a jiffy to accommodate our anticipated check-in time, and was in constant communication so we were well informed. She was really a great host, even (or rather especially) from a distance.

The only inconvenience we had was internet. I think you're meant to be able to connect to the pizza place's wi-fi below, but this was functioning less than half of our time there, and was sluggish even when we could connect. If were staying for a shorter time or vacation-type scenario, I don't really think this would've been a problem. However, being there for a month and with my husband in medical school needing to do research online, this got to be somewhat of a sore point.

Overall, though, our experience was a very positive one, and we would absolutely recommend both Angela and her condo!"
74328,22365540,2014-11-04,2202337,Peter,"Angela's little apartment was just as described. It was very clean and comfortable, and the location was convenient. We walked to restaurants and shops, and rode the buses everywhere. It was a very enjoyable 5-day stay."
74328,22628136,2014-11-10,8728218,Karl,No actual in person contact with owner but that doesn't bother me. Place was clean but not sure why it is called a condo. It's really a studio with a murphy bed. Cleaning fee seemed a bit steep to me for a 2 night stay.  Bed was comfortable and firm. Not having wifi was unfortunate. 
74328,28539642,2015-03-25,8441973,Robert,Everything was pretty much as described. An updated photo of the roof top deck is needed as the furniture  it is not in that condition. Also a heads up on the map in the ad. If you click it for navigation it will take you to a different apartment on Yesler. Had a very enjoyable time. I also appreciated the timely responses from the hosts. 
74328,29990155,2015-04-15,2009868,Stijn,"Appartment was according to description: clean, quiet and fully equipped!"
74328,30514715,2015-04-23,28482860,Carla,"Before arriving to the studio, Angela made sure we had everything we needed to check-in. Check was easy, and the place was exactly what was pictured. The place was clean, close to everything, and nice and quiet. The rooftop had an awesome veiw of downtown. The building was peaceful, and the few residents I ran into were extremely friendly. The condo was stocked with everything needed to feel at home: cooking oil, coffee, extra linens, washer and dryer with detergent, dvds, a/c, and a wine opener.   I would have to say my over all experience was excellent. I would definitely recommend Angela's studio.  im not sure I could suggest anything to have made it better."
74328,31896811,2015-05-11,11378982,Janet,"Angela has a lovely studio suite, located on a main street with transit nearby and fairly close to downtown.  Both the Murphy style queen bed  and couch were very comfortable. The couch is single bed style and fits a moderate size adult (5 ft 5 inches) or a child. There is a view of the mountains and downtown Seattle from both the building's deck and her suite. It was a perfect location for us. We didn't explore the area as we were attending a conference and our days were long. Quiet building. Nice kitchen and spacious bathroom. Everything was great."
74328,32548958,2015-05-19,31204882,Kat,"We had a great time in Seattle, and a large part of that was because of the great accommodations! Angela's apartment was very neat, comfortable, and had lots of natural light. All the comforts of home, no more than ten minutes to everything- the Needle, the Troll, etc. And Angela's instructions were thorough and easy to follow!"
74328,33276200,2015-05-26,31883753,Bronie,"Angela has a nice studio. It was according to description: clean, quiet and fully equipped(except for WiFi). Its a 10 mins drive from downtown. Enjoyed staying here.
 "
74328,34415528,2015-06-08,18817933,Shanti,"Angela was a great host! Checking in was easy, everything was as described, and it was a very comfortable place to stay. Angela responded quickly to any questions before our trip and even left us with a list of restaurants and bars near by. I would reccomend staying here!"
74328,46690465,2015-09-13,14378571,Steven,"Location is convenient. 5 minutes from the 5 and 90 freeways, 5 minutes from International District and Downtown. Good kitchen amenities make cooking at home easy. The only problem is the lack of WiFi but it's not a huge problem. The pizza place downstairs has it and they're super accommodating."
74328,48076533,2015-09-23,39080053,Mariana,"La descripción del anuncio si es tal cual, el condo es cómodo, no es demasiado céntrico pero si es cómodo. Limpio y en perfecto estado, bonito lugar."
74328,49004325,2015-09-30,40048494,Miloš,"Great condo, very clean and a great location too. Angela gave us great tips on the neighborhood and was very helpful for our entire stay. I can highly recommend, loved it !"
3951768,18852404,2014-09-01,19110326,Kristin,The Apartment was like in the description. It was clean and everything you need was there. Even the landlords weren't there it was easy to get the keys. The neighborrhood is not far from downtown and anyway quiet. I would go there again.
3951768,19008306,2014-09-04,19234461,Ralf,"We had really good days in Seattle. The room we had was very nice and big. Unfortunately we did not see Kelly once, but there were notes all over which explained everything we needed to know. ;-) and her roommate Sabrina :-) which helped us with every question there was. Thanks for the stay!"
3951768,19451303,2014-09-12,13531847,Michelle,"Kelly's place was spacious and comfortable.  They were very accommodating, even though we made reservations at the last minute.  We didn't see them much as we were off and going our whole stay."
3951768,19862761,2014-09-19,14811454,Nika,"Kelly was great about accepting our last minute request, getting to her place off the I-5 was effortless & it is priced decent for the proximity to downtown. There was on street parking which was a little scarce later into the night. We did not meet Kelly but Sabrina was helpful upon arrival, a few other things worth mentioning would be the noise transfer from upstairs which IMO was quite a bit I actually had a hard time sleeping & the stairs down to the basement apartment are steep & narrow which would be tough for anyone older or with disabilities.  Overall it was a good space for a quick overnight."
3951768,19917740,2014-09-20,6440991,Erik,The hosts were very welcoming and wanted to make sure we had everything we needed. They explained everything very well and provided more then we could have asked for. The stairs are on the steep side and parts of the ceiling in the basement are low. We did not spend much time there but the neighborhood felt safe so we did not worry about our car. 
3951768,20473650,2014-09-29,6999326,Ari,"Great place to stay! Very private and, even though it was a shared bath, we never ran into the hosts. Only going to get better once the shower in the unit is done. 

Place was very clean and comfortable. Just a short drive to downtown and close to a few nice restaurants/bars in the Georgetown neighborhood. We spent most of our days exploring Seattle and this suited well as a place to just lay our heads comfortably. 

Although we didn't have to interact with them much, the hosts were very welcoming and kind to us. 

Highly recommend! "
3951768,22512464,2014-11-08,23271313,Tyler,"Kelly seemed very nice and the accommodations met my expectations, though I ended up spending much less time there than I had planned, which was totally unrelated to the room or Kelly. I would certainly recommend Kelly and her house, though."
3951768,22638858,2014-11-10,127659,Suzanne,"We had a nice stay in Kelly's suite.  It was warm, clean and comfortable for a good night's sleep with our car parked right outside the window (this is a safe area).  The neighborhood is very close to downtown and easy to get to and from all areas by using 15th Ave or freeway.  What a great little spot! 
"
3951768,22780583,2014-11-14,787701,Danny,"I did not meet Kelly but our communication was perfect email, text, cellphone.

Unit as listed the space is nice, bed was comfortable, tv service and desk with plenty of local information there, local bus to downtown seattle was easy, 30 mins, washer and dryer, no kitchen in the space but access was upstairs to the house kitchen, bathroom was private and a nice tiled shower, great hot water, towels, soap, & heat.

Nice suburban area, the house is a small older built home with low clearance in the area 6' clearance, doorway and steps leading down was narrow, i highly recommed staying if you plan to be in seattle area."
3951768,23565193,2014-12-04,24406607,Kat,"Kelly was super-responsive and easy to communicate with. The basement room with separate entrance felt very private and cozy, as promised."
3951768,23673551,2014-12-07,7647211,Larry,"Listing was just as advertised! I didn't actually meet Kelly, but on short notice I had, for me, the perfect landing spot. One night just to crash, out early. Entire lower level for space an privacy. My own bath (important to me) and nice little touches (coffee, TV, internet).
Would recommend without hesitation."
3951768,24164688,2014-12-21,24644385,AleXx,"Great place to stay. As described. We had privacy and lots of space, our own bathroom. Will definitely book again if I need to. This was my first time staying in a place like this. Great experience, better than a hotel. Will recommend to everybody."
3951768,24630236,2014-12-31,25322399,Josee,I enjoyed my stay at Kelly's. The room was exactly as described. I was even able to leave my luggages there when I landed in Seattle. The room has the privacy one can possibly ask for and it is separate from the rest of the house. I liked the neighborhood as well.
3951768,25091250,2015-01-06,23868994,Jessica,"Very private experience, which was just what we wanted. Side entrance, private bathroom, and spacious room. Bed was cozy, the temperature in the room was never too cold or too got, and there was coffee and such to help ourselves to in the morning. We realized that in general, everything is fairly close and easy to get to in Seattle - but Kelly's house was 15 min. tops from anything we wanted to do. A great first AirBnb experience. :)"
3951768,34739453,2015-06-11,34764960,Brent,Very clean and comfortable room. We enjoyed our stay here in Seattle.
3951768,34872330,2015-06-13,4389896,Andrew,We enjoyed our stay in this basement. The proximity to I5 and Seward Park were especially useful to us. Stay at this listing if you do not plan to cook or eat at the house and have a full slate of activities to keep you occupied. We were only here to sleep and it worked out great! Thanks to our hostess for providing a clean and comfortable place to crash. 
3951768,39927426,2015-07-27,33240337,Haley,"Let me start by saying I don't want to knock Kelly or her home and I respect anyone who is willing to open their home to complete strangers. I do, however, want to ensure that I am accurate in describing our personal experience.  

The area itself was big enough but it was not completely private. Once down the narrow dark stairway, you enter a utility area which includes the furnace, hot water tank, and laundry area. None of this is shown in the pictures. We had to use the flashlight on our phone to navigate our way through the pitch black until we could find a light around the corner. There was a note that indicated the owners wouldn't come down except to do laundry. Again, this wasn't mentioned in the ad. They never actually came down but we spent the 4 nights on edge that they might appear without warning. This was especially uncomfortable as the laundry is directly next to the bathroom. 
 
 The parking situation was probably the most frustrating. There was room in front of the house for 2 cars as well as a large enough driveway. Unfortunately someone purposely parked their vehicle across both spots on the road. We also weren't permitted to park in the driveway (which remained empty for almost the entire 4 days). Because of this we were forced to park down the street in a questionable neighborhood. 

  The neighborhood itself wasn't the worst place ever but it was definitely sketchy. The first sign of this was when I almost stepped on a used condom directly in front of the house. The funny thing about a used condom is nobody is going to clean it up so it remained there for the entire 4 days. This is obviously out of Kelly's control but again I'm just being honest. Very close to the I-5 and you could get almost anywhere in Seattle within 10-20 minutes. Also, an Uber cab was only $10 to downtown. We did avoid public transit because we felt it could be a little sketchy at night. 

Kelly and her roommate were quick to respond to our texts. Other than that there was no direct interaction with either of them which was fine by us. 

On a positive note, the bed was decently comfortable, the shower was great and as mentioned, the proximity to downtown was great. Also, when you consider most hotels downtown are around $300 a night in summer, you're getting a great deal at $80.

3951768,40234909,2015-07-29,36561560,Jean-Luc,Cet appartement est très bien situé. Il est à 10 minutes du centre ville en voiture.
3951768,40444902,2015-07-31,33512639,Stephen,"This was a nice, little, newly renovated basement room, a good base for coming back to at night. It isn't completely private as the basement isn't completely closed off, but we had no problem with anyone coming in. Be careful of the relatively steep descent into the space; it doesn't have the best lighting placement. The windows, though, are well blocked for a dark, uninterrupted sleep. It doesn't look like the greatest neighborhood at night, but is a good location to Uber in and out of the city. "
3951768,40746963,2015-08-02,34875871,Roger,"Kelly was responsive over text and put us in touch with Sabrina, who helped answer questions and coordinate check-in/check-out. The room is a redone basement with full bath, a mini-fridge, desk space, internet, and a dresser (no closet). The hosts provided toilet paper, soap, and shampoo/conditioner, and the room is situated such that we never saw them at all. "
3951768,41115419,2015-08-04,20181785,Julie,"We had a great experience in Seattle at Kelly's. She is a quick communicator and answered all of our questions right away. The place was just like the listing, only bigger than expected - which was great. The location is perfect. We could easily drive downtown in about 10 minutes. Would stay here again!"
3951768,41750752,2015-08-09,1661955,Emily,"Cozy little basement apartment! We loved having a private entry since we were in town for a wedding and came back late most nights. It was nice to know we weren't disturbing the hosts. The bathroom is fantastic and looks newly renovated. Tip: Look in the dresser for extra towels – we didn't even notice them until the last day! 

Comfy bed and friendly, available hosts - they answered all our texts right away. Great wifi too. You may hear a little bit of the upstairs folks walking around but they were very mindful about the time and it never bothered us a bit. Great place, great price!"
3951768,43290005,2015-08-18,3009369,Olivier,"Very nice studio with all the amenities and services that we needed. Contrary to what is said below, it is specified on the ""rules"" that they dont come down to the basement unless they notify it which guaranteed us a total privacy. Merci!"
3951768,44661409,2015-08-28,38303917,Benjamin,We had a brief but pleasant stay at Kelly's airbnb. It was clean and spacious and looked just like the pictures. We never saw Kelly as her policy is to stay out of your way but she will gladly assist you if needed (although we didn't). 
3951768,45079415,2015-08-31,9874105,Nelson,Our stay in Seattle was excellent. Sabrina and Kelly's studio was perfect for us. Sabrina one of the host was extremely nice to supply us with some toiletries that we ran out of. It was much appreciated. I would definitely recommend staying here next time your in Seattle.
3951768,45639672,2015-09-04,786142,Carter,"I found myself in a situation where I arrived in a city and had not made arrangements, it was the sixth week in a row, and this has never happened.  On that day I searched and found Kelly's place, and within an hour she had me booked. I was so relieved, and once I arrived found her place very comfortable for me.  Its in the basement of their home, and between the sleeping area and the bathroom there is a laundry space, but the photos show accurately, that it is furnished perfectly for a traveler and there is a very nice kitchen area.  I was very comfortable, parking was directly in front of the house, and with a little mapping, is a nice back way to get in and out of the city. They have done a lot with lighting, to counter to other reviews.  Thanks again Kelly."
3951768,45980648,2015-09-07,40219892,Heekwon,"Great parking space, comfortable bed.
Books and Coupons for Seattle travel on the table.

Clean and nice bathroom and Shower booth.
"
3951768,46744923,2015-09-13,39182487,Anthony,"Description Accuracy:
The description is mostly accurate, but it's important to note that its not 100% private. The room itself is the basement of their house that was remodeled to be a living area, but it is very nice inside as you can tell from the pictures. 

The pictures are a little misleading, making it appear as if you have your own area that is completely closed off, but there is actually some amount of 'shared space'. 

In front of the restroom door is a laundry room and a staircase that leads up to basement to the door you will be using to get in and out, but up the stairs is also a door leading to where they live upstairs. 

The bed area itself has a door to block the bed area and the staircase, but next to the restroom/kitchen there is an opening that leads to bedroom that has no doors. You imagine the entire area as a big U shape, with the staircase on one end, the kitchen restroom at the bottom of the U, and the bed area on the other end of the U.

Neighborhood: It's a quiet neighborhood that's very close to the 5 freeway, and getting to downtown was easy. 10 minutes with no traffic, 20 with. 

Parking: The front of the house has free street parking, but you might find yourself parking in front of someone else's house (I luckily didn't encounter this problem). The parking is just a little strip of dirt/grass in front of the sidewalk, and seemingly, everyone parks in either direction regardless of which side of the street they are on. Don't know if this is legal/illegal.

Kitchen: Kitchen has a mini-fridge, toaster oven, coffee maker, and a sink. She provides some cups and things. Sometimes, the previous guests will have food left for you in the fridge, which is nice.

Restroom: The shower is very nice and big. She provides towels and even shampoo and soap, etc. 

Bedroom: There are a couple of nightstands, nothing to fancy. One thing that was interesting was that the windows are covered with cardboard, because the curtains aren't wide enough to cover the window. This was not very appealing, but got the job done.

The bed itself is very loud. Nearly every movement will cause the bed to squeak, it can get annoying. This is really the biggest downside I had. 

Hosts:
Although the layout is not 100% private, they were very good about not using the downstairs area completely. I only saw her once the entire stay which is when I checked in. She was very responsive to my text messages and was even nice enough to allow me to leave my car parked out front past my checkout time. 

Overall, for the price you pay, the ease of parking, and proximity to downtown and West Seattle, I would stay here again and recommend it. "
3951768,47492056,2015-09-19,17605516,Sevinna,I never got to meet Kelly but Sabrina was very kind. She provided all the essentials including umbrella. The studio is not completely private but we never encountered any awkward situation. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend this place!
3951768,48107021,2015-09-23,20337406,Sabrina,"I was looking for a place that allowed me my own privacy because we would come back at late hours, and we didn't want to disturb the residents living there; Kelly's place was perfect!
We 'checked in' on our own wacky schedule.
The whole time I stayed there, I only received one request (via text) ahead of time, asking if it was okay for them to come down to the area I was staying in. She was also very quick to respond to any questions I had via text messages. Other than that, I was left to my own devices.
Towels, shampoo, body wash, and WiFi were provided, so I was very grateful for that.
There is even a mini kitchentte area connected, with a provided mini toaster oven and mini fridge, perfect for heating up a late dinner!
There was ample street parking when we stayed. (We were baffled that everyone parks anyone which way they wanted?)
All in all, I was very pleased with my stay at Kelly's place and would stay here again!"
3951768,48551815,2015-09-27,41933060,Naja,"Kelly was a great host and the place was exactly as listed. She didn't bug us at all (although we wouldn't have minded if she did), but let us know she was there if we needed anything. The bathroom was fully stocked with anything we might need and the tons of tourist brochures helped us out a lot. The house is in a perfect location and only takes about 10-15 minutes to get downtown. "
3951768,49647261,2015-10-05,43212710,Kent,"This was a great place to stay while in Seattle.  It is quite close to downtown and SeaTac Airport (not walking distance) but close. I was there to charter fish and see some friends (not really to see the sights) so I did not need to walk out my front door and be ""downtown"".  I thought the place was perfect for what I needed.  It is a basement apartment with a side entrance with basic appointments for people who need a nice place to stay that is safe and has great freeway access.  The host Kelly was super nice and even left some basics there for our use like shower supplies and coffee and creamer.  I would recommend it as a nice, quiet, and safe place to stay."
3951768,52414872,2015-10-29,44885043,Kap,The place was easy to find and in a great location. Cozy and comfortable. Easy access to the freeway and surrounding area. It was my first trip to Seattle but won't be my last and would definitely stay here and recommend it to friends. Thank you for making it a great experience. 
3951768,52768203,2015-11-01,47070031,Ryan,"Kelly was a great host. The location was exactly as described. It was safe, quiet, and located near a lot of points of interest in the Seattle area.

The place was spacious and comfortable. "
3951768,53306292,2015-11-07,47905406,Carlos,"Kelly’s place is just minutes from Seattle downtown and really close to interstate I5; it is a very good location to go practically anywhere in Seattle. 

Her place is spacious and private with its own entrance. Parking is available in front of the house.

I did not meet Kelly personally however she was very prompt to any questions I had. 

Kelly was very nice to accommodate last minute request to book when I was in Seattle."
3951768,54073903,2015-11-15,48795364,Trista,"This space is exactly as described- private and spacious!  The basement studio is quiet, bigger than you'd expect (plenty of room for yoga!), and has all the basics you might need.  The shower is nice and hot with good water pressure and the nice hairdryer in the space was a good surprise.  The host accommodated a late arrival.  The neighborhood was neat and seemed like a great location for exploring Seattle and surrounding areas. "
3951768,55004129,2015-11-27,19931978,Fernando,"The entrance to the basement looked unfinished. That was the only thing I can say was maybe something to work on since it's the first thing you see. The remainder of the basement was very well done. It had I nice, comfortable room with a little dining area and kitchenette. The bathroom was nice and especially the showet. They had nice clean towels as well as shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and just about anything you could need. The kitchenette also had a little minifridge, toaster over, coffee maker and a sink. They also offered complimentary coffee, sugar, tea, coffee creamer, water, and glasses and mugs which also added to the experience. We never even met Kelly, which was nice since I've always found it a bit awkward to stay at a stranger's house. We had our own entrance and any time we had a question or request Kelly was available via text to answer our questions and concerns. Overall it was a great experience and we would stay here again. Thank you, Kelly for sharing your space."
7826541,44997988,2015-08-30,13599013,Mary Kate,"Dan was super friendly and a great host. We took the light rail from the airport to downtown, and Dan was nice enough to pick us up and take us back to his place which made things really easy. He was very easy to get in touch with the whole time we were there. His place was well kept, and a good location. Walkable to UW, Fremont brewery, bars/restaurants, Gas Works park. Would recommend! "

It is great place to stay in down town Seattle: great location, two large bedrooms, open kitchen and living  area with great ocean and down-town view.  A lot of dinning and sightseeing spots in walking distance.  Host even providing private parking space.  Highly recommended and will come back again."

I stayed in the unit for a weekend trip with a few friends. The location was ideal for exploring the local sights. Pike Place Market is only a block or two away, the ferry station is a block or two away. The monorail to seattle center is a few blocks away. Capitol Hill is a 20-30min walk or a short Uber ride. 

Terry made check-in and check-out extremely convenient and was prompt with replying to any questions. I would definitely recommend staying here if you want to be in downtown."

Apartment was easy to find, located in a great part of town, and had walking access to anything and everything you could possibly want.

7451624,50257607,2015-10-10,45775482,Kristofer,"Fabulous modern apartment, very clean and well appointed. The view was amazing, we loved sitting on the balcony and listening to the rain and the city and looking at the ocean. We will be booking this place again the next time we are in Seattle. "
7451624,51328450,2015-10-19,44787110,Helen,"The views are spectacular, and the condo pristine, but the location was simply beyond expectation.   Every major Seattle attraction, for us, was within walking distance.  Terry also recommended excellent restaurants that added local ambience to our stay.  His care and attention to the needs of four weary travelers was appreciated. We will always remember Seattle fondly from his 16th floor.  Also, there are plenty of secure, public parking garages nearby, so no need to worry about car park spaces.  This is an outstanding airbnb."
7451624,51644286,2015-10-22,44531168,Jaimie,Beautiful view and location. Easy to get to waterfront and Pike Place Market.  Awesome place for a stay in Seattle!!

Great location, easy to get in and out, street parking available, and host easy to (website hidden) the balcony door is European style, you'll figure it out "
7451624,52948596,2015-11-02,18173574,Hersh,"I stayed at Terry's place while in town for work. The company put me up at the Fairmont, but I flew in early to see the city so I had to make my own arrangements for the weekend.

Well, I just checked into the Fairmont, and Terry's place is much nicer. Better view, more space, plus there's a market downstairs with great breakfast (instead of $26 omlettes) and other amenities). 5 minute walk down Post Alley leads you to the world famous Pike Market, 5 minutes in another direction takes you to the waterfront. What more could you ask for?

Terry was a great host as well. 5 stars!"
7451624,53028694,2015-11-03,4547156,Regina,"This is an incredibly gorgeous spot. The kind of place where you drop your bags in awe upon entering. Everything was spot on luxurious and thought out. And that view!!! What a treat. I wish I could live here. Terry was super helpful and communicative, great host!"
7451624,53409325,2015-11-08,13498022,Peach,"Logan is one of the best hosts I have ever encountered. Although I didn't get a chance to meet him in person, he's very nice and responsive. The location of his apt is superb. The decoration inside is tasteful. My friend and I had a great time at his place. "
7451624,53937319,2015-11-14,38254544,Rachel,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was fabulous. Check-in was hassle free, the apartment was exactly as I imagined, and the location is unbeatable. I will definitely stay here again when traveling to Seattle."

A great time was had by all, and Terry was a great host, very accommodating and flexible as we prepared for our Seattle getaway!  Thanks, Terry!"
7451624,54443274,2015-11-20,45564623,Ethan,This was a fantastic place to stay! It was exactly like the pictures showed and couldn't have been in a better location. Just a few minutes walking distance to the water and to Pike Market. It was very clean and since it was on the top floor had a gorgeous view of downtown. 
7451624,55383415,2015-12-01,784549,Jennifer,"Great experience at this lovely Seattle apartment.  Excellent location right next to Pike Place Market and a handful of other attractions.  Communication with Logan leading up to the trip was great.  The listing provides a ton of information as well.  Apartment was spotless when we arrived and stocked with basic amenities.  The only thing to take note of, which may not be an issue for most or may be a temporary situation, is there is only one bedroom with a television, i.e. one TV in the apartment.  All in all, would definitely recommend this lovely apartment to anyone travelling to the Seattle area.   "
7451624,55822245,2015-12-06,21459416,Aileen,Everything was as described and the process for check in and out was simple and easy. We had a very comfortable stay. Good location and very near the Pike's Market.

2197982,10455713,2014-02-19,11912014,Marina,"My husband and I stayed at Laura and Hasan's studio apartment while we were visiting for 7 days. We had the pleasure of meeting Laura the first day who is a wonderful host and made sure we had everything we needed. The place is bright, open, and clean. They had a full range of cable tv, washer/dryer, full kitchen, bathroom, and food assortments, and our own entrance. It was everything we needed and it felt like home. We would stay there again and would recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle. Thank you Laura and Hasan!
"
2197982,10662544,2014-03-02,11902112,Cameron,"We travel to Seattle two or three times a year, and from now on, we'll always check availability here before booking anywhere else. Easy to find, off street parking, very private. And it must be well insulated, as it's completely quiet inside. The room is perfectly clean, with some key tidbits left for guests - snacks, chocolates, breakfast bars, granola, coffee additives, refreshments, a fully functional kitchen at the ready, and a basket of ""stuff you might forget"" in the bathroom - floss, toothbrushes, that kind of thing. We've never stayed anywhere that provided contact solution. The hosts were gracious and met us at the door with fresh baked goodies, then did a perfect job of remaining available and attentive without ever invading our privacy. It felt more like our own vacation home that someone else maintains than like a place we'd rented. If you have kids, there's a great playground thing in the private and fenced yard - one of those wooden fort things with a climbing wall, a slide and some swings. Laundry machines and soap on site. Everything is new and in perfect condition - none of that ""only use this burner"" or ""the shower is funky"" here. There are a couple great coffeehouses in the neighborhood, which is key for people like us. We were happy to find that we had easy access to the different areas in Seattle that we typically visit - Capitol Hill, Ballard and the U District were all just minutes away.
We'll definately stay here again and we'll definately recommend this studio to friends who like the idea of staying in a fully appointed accommodation for about a third less than a simple hotel room.
Oh! There's also a big flat screen TV and more cable channels than we've ever heard of. If you like TV, you'll be totally set."
2197982,10703061,2014-03-03,12486526,Teri,"A great stay! Laura and Hasan were both sweet and attentive via email and text. I was in town with my mom for a night's stay while I took care of some business nearby. They were flexible and accommodating with both our arrival and departure time; much appreciated during a stressful weekend. The studio is private, was super clean, the bed comfortable, and the personal touches like extra toiletries, coffee, and breakfast items really left a great impression on us both. Even a stack of magazines and a large TV with lots of channels if you have the time to hangout at the studio. A much better experience than any of the nearby hotels would have been for the same, or slightly better pricing. I'd absolutely stay again, and recommend them and their studio without hesitation. "
2197982,10895882,2014-03-11,4659514,Lindsey,"Laura and Hasan's place was perfect for our visit to Seattle! The studio was quiet and cozy, with everything we could possibly need for our stay. I wish we could have stayed longer! It is a quick drive to Fremont, Ballard, and downtown."
2197982,10964161,2014-03-15,9820163,Icy,"I would like to say it is a super great and sweet studio in a great location which is close to the freeway and any other places within 20 mins drive. The host Laura and Hasan are very nice and get everything we need ready in the room. 
I really like the studio that with enough space for two people travel. It is a very clean and warm studio, the washing and dryer machine works well, the shower is hot and also the beers are good :) 
Thank you very much "
2197982,11036445,2014-03-17,3966937,Scott,"Laura and Hasan have a great studio! Easy to get to anywhere in the Seattle area. They have prepared the space very well for short-term visitors, even stocking the bathroom with travel toiletries, which was very handy! They made the check-in process very seamless and comfortable. I would definitely stay with them again!"
2197982,11322657,2014-03-30,11931607,Davianna,"My boyfriend and I had such a wonderful stay here! Very bright, open, and clean! It was overall just a perfect environment. We loved that we got to have our own parking spot too. Laura and Hasan were both so helpful for our entire trip. I don't think we would have been able to get very far in Seattle without them! We absolutely loved everything about our stay. The location was perfect. The studio is in such a nice neighborhood with some delicious restaurants all around and grocery stores very close by, if you don't feel like eating out. We loved that it was so close to the bus station. I would highly recommend this studio to anyone! This will definitely always be our go to place every time we visit Seattle! Thank you guys so much! :) "
2197982,11512549,2014-04-06,8236092,Ellie,"Laura and Hasan's studio was lovely, bright, and clean! It somehow managed to have that sanitized, untouched feeling of a nice hotel room while remaining homey and welcoming.  Everything was provided for your comfort and convenience from the treats in the fridge, to the toiletries on the bathroom sink to the bowl of chocolates by the bed! Would certainly stay here again and would HIGHLY recommend! For what it's worth, EVERYTHING in their post was true and accurate. Thanks, you two!
"
2197982,14262922,2014-06-16,10208911,New,I stayed at Laura's and Hasan's place for seven weeks and it was a perfect experience. The studio is big enough and has all the amenities you need to be very comfortable. You also have as much privacy as you want since it is detached from the main house. Laura and Hasan were also very responsive to any requests. I will stay at there place again every time I will visit seattle.

It quiet and peaceful, and it was a nice place to come back and relax in after a day of adventure. Laura was extremely kind and checked to make sure that we were comfortable during our stay."
2197982,16227706,2014-07-23,4792200,Casey,"What a great find! Our hosts were very welcoming and provided bus information to help us get from their lovely, residential neighborhood to downtown. The studio itself was pristine yet comfortable; little treats like coffee and candy made the stay feel even cozier."
2197982,16651473,2014-07-31,13377580,Claire,"An excellent studio in a great location.  We were in Seattle visiting family who lived in the same neighbourhood.  Laura met us on the first day, and was extremely welcoming.  She had also left out some chocolate and savoury treats, which were much appreciated.  The studio  is particularly well equipped, and was perfect for our stay as it also had laundry facilities, which was a big big plus for us.  The bathroom and kitchen facilities were excellent, and the studio itself was spotless.  It was very quiet also, and the private entrance made you feel like you weren't disturbing anyone else.  I would not hesitate to recommend the studio to anyone visiting the area.  It is priced well, and is very convenient to the Greenlake neighbourhood also."
2197982,16731944,2014-08-01,4411590,Leigh,"Laura and Hasan have a wonderful private-entrance studio in Seattle which was perfect for our one-night stay, but would have been just as great for a longer visit. I really appreciated the home-from-home small touches such as toiletries in the bathroom and chocolates next to the bed ;) 
It has everything you need to self cater and is conveniently located near the freeway. We paid just $14 to Uber into Seattle. 
Laura was very friendly and accommodating when we needed to arrive a bit earlier and checking in and out was hassle free. 
I highly recommend this studio and I'm grateful that our first Airbnb experience was so much fun!"
2197982,16775629,2014-08-02,16504537,Graig,"This was a great place to stay. The listing was as advertised, clean, cozy, and had great access to the city. Will definitely rent from again!"
2197982,17067612,2014-08-06,9243047,Hannes,"Ich habe für zwei Nächte in der Unterkunft von Laura und Hasan gewohnt und mich sehr wohlgefühlt. Das Apartment war sehr sauber, gemütlich und obwohl es nah an dem Highway 5 liegt, sehr ruhig. Erfreulich ist, dass es eine Kaffeemaschine mit genügend Kaffee und Milch gratis gibt.

Ich kann dieses Apartment nur weiterempfehlen!"

2197982,18648875,2014-08-30,14949072,Paul,"Laura and Hasan were excellent hosts, with extensive knowledge of the area, and helpful in ways that weren't even expected. The place was exactly as described; clean, neat, full of home conveniences that not only took away hassle, but added to our enjoyment of the trip to Seattle. We could tell they put a lot of thought and concern into making the accommodations comfortable and enjoyable. They were both full of knowledge of the local area and wonderfully capable of giving personalized recommendations. Cannot over emphasize how much we enjoyed our experience, hope to cross paths with them again."

2197982,19459515,2014-09-13,16843095,Peter,"Great spacious apartment for a studio. We stayed here for over a week and had no problems. Plenty of good coffee, very comfortable bed and the studio is behind the main house off the street so nice and quiet. Location is  mostly residential, a good 10 - 15 min walk to the bus but good direct connection to downtown on the 41 so wasn't an issue. The studio was also very clean and well kept. Would stay here again for sure especially for long visits thanks guys :) "
2197982,20087192,2014-09-23,18066381,Rich,"   It was a wonderful experience.  I felt welcomed from the moment I arrived.  Everyone was kind and welcoming. The studio was very pleasant, bright, clean, new, quiet, private,  with all that I needed.   Very nice neighborhood with lovely homes, gardens and trees.  When I met people on my walks they were very friendly.  Easy travel by bus or just walking. {I was not driving a car} Great television with music channels.  Good mattress.  The kitchen was so good to have. And the coffee maker, oh yeah!
    I do not think I could have had a better situation.  Also got clear and accurate directions from Hasan when I needed them.  
   I (email hidden) was a wonderful experience in All ways.  Thank you!!!

2197982,20831892,2014-10-06,1846376,Chieko,The suite was large and private and well suited for 2 of us plus our 2 year old. Laura and Hasan made sure we had everything that we needed and kindly allowed our son to use the play set in the yard. We would recommend this suite.
2197982,21011293,2014-10-09,7274055,Shing,"All the previous reviews have perfectly described this studio.  The communication was great.  There is parking available in the back and down a short flight of stairs.  The neighborhood is great.  It felt like I lived in Seattle as a local.
The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean and new.  The kitchen was awesome with a full sized stove and refrigerator.  It was a nice touch to have access to laundry, although I didn't need it.  Everything felt new and well-kept.
Thank you Laura and Hasan.  I will be back."

The location is great and literally a 10 minute walk from the main bus terminal that will take you anywhere. It only cost $2.25 per person each way. The bus itself only takes around 15 minutes to get into the city center. I never got the chance to personally meet Laura or Hasan but they were always very quick and responsive with communication. The studio has everything you need and more. The little added touches such as the coffee, oatmeal, snacks and toiletries shows just how much care Laura and Hasan put into their hospitality. We would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in Seattle."

We went to the mall near by and did some Christmas shopping.  It was easy to get on the 5 fwy and there was lots of places to choose from to eat for my girlfriend who has to eat gluten and dairy free. The place is just so amazing.  We plan to stay there again in the future.   Laura and Hasan are super nice and welcoming :)

2197982,24803818,2015-01-03,4006645,Christopher,"Great place - very quiet as it's well off the street, perfect location for the north end of Seattle (though also pretty easy to get downtown).  The bed is very comfortable and it all has all the amenities you could wish.  Laura and Hasan communicated very promptly and I had a variety of travel nightmares that kept changing my arrival time that they worked around and gave me everything I needed to check in at 2am without disturbing their household.  This studio is very private and you feel like you are coming and going very much to your own apartment.  I recommend it highly."

And now about the house itself.. this place is just a very cozy place.. it has everything.. from various TV channel, washing machine, microwave, to some late night snacks (bowl of chocolates on the bed side desk) i would love to stay there again when i visit seattle ☺"
2197982,26165600,2015-02-05,13852088,Katie,"I would recommend this place to ANYONE.  It is very spacious and comfortable.  It is appointed with just about anything you could need on a quick visit or extended stay.

The bed is comfortable, the bathroom is impeccably clean, and the kitchen has EVERYTHING you could possible need.

The Hosts stocked the studio with coffee, tea, hot cocoa, and light snacks.

My favorite thing about this place other than the great location was how quite it was.  Seriously, so quite and peaceful! I never heard outside noises."
2197982,26490348,2015-02-14,4858674,Patty,They make everything easy.  The room meets all of ore needs.  We love staying here.

The room was spotless when I arrived and I left it tidy when I left. It was the perfect Airbnb experience. They even texted me during my stay to make sure all was okay. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat, and  probably will.

We definitely recomend this place and would love to come back again."
2197982,28102567,2015-03-17,3361566,Shanna,"Laura and Hasan's studio was the perfect size for the two of us, and very conveniently located.  There is a Whole Foods a short drive away, so we were able to pick up a few things to cook breakfast or to have a glass of wine and a cheese plate in the evening.  There are plenty of great restaurants, shopping and nightlife nearby as well.  

Everything was spotless, the bed was super comfortable (I think I slept better than I do at home), and the clothes dryer came in very handy after we had been out in the rain one day.   

Although the location is right off the freeway you really don't hear noise at all, so don't let that deter you.   

Communication with our hosts was always prompt and friendly and we would happily stay again.   Highly recommend!"

We had everything we needed it. Thanks so much for the lovely treats. We liked the fact that the mall and Safeway is close by.
2197982,30373705,2015-04-21,21702941,Mikael,"What a wonderful stay we had in Seattle hosted by Laura and Hasan.  We have traveled in many places in the country and this felt the most like home.  The neighborhood felt safe and was in easy walking distance to the bus line which gave us access to the city.  The private studio was clean and they added many little touches to make us feel welcome.  It is a ""home"" we will definitely return to in the future.  The wall hanging they have displayed says it all for any visitors.....""Friendship isn't a big thing it is a million little things.""  
 "
2197982,31778864,2015-05-10,9907171,Helene,"The other reviewers are it right -- Laura and Hasan's studio is an exceptional place to stay.  Little details like lots of snacks, bandaids and a diffuser for the hair dryer helped make us very comfortable.  We really enjoyed having a washer and dryer in the unit and felt like it was plenty of space for two people.  There's great natural light during the day time and it's very peaceful at night.  Laura, Laura's brother and Hasan were all very friendly and answered our questions quickly."
2197982,32505196,2015-05-19,29034805,Debra,Nice neighborhood.Location was perfect for us. We felt welcomed. The studio was a nice size and well equipped with coffee and snacks. The shower was (website hidden) was a large flatscreen with pleny of channels to choose from.
2197982,33618586,2015-05-30,25435228,Chris,"Really tidy, comfortable bed, easy access to 5. Would be good for long and short stays."
2197982,34284455,2015-06-07,16457874,Nicholas,"Laura and Hasan were great, we had a late night arrival and Hasan was up and waiting for us. The location was perfect for us; we loved that there was a washer and dryer, and we really appreciated the little things as well: salad dressings, peanut butter and jelly in the fridge, snack packs of nuts and oatmeal, tea and coffee were all there for us. The unit is separate from the house, so it's really quiet and private. We would definitely stay there again!"
2197982,34777705,2015-06-12,31133572,Kate,"Extremely quiet, very easy to get to, and clean as a whistle! VERY comfortable bed."
2197982,35570121,2015-06-20,31877358,Tatyana,Laura and Hasan were excellent hosts! They were very attentive to detail and organized in making our stay as comfortable as possible. They were very inviting and offered their knowledge on the area and recommendations on places to go see/eat. The studio was very cozy and exactly as described in the listing. Overall very nice experience!! Thank you!!
2197982,35764819,2015-06-22,25533647,Hueiju,"We love this well equipped spacious studio!! We got way much more than everything we needed and enjoyed our private space. From the settings and equipment of this studio we could feel the thoughtfulness of the owners. The location is also very good no matter you want to head to downtown/capital hill/university of washington or leave for the north of Seattle. The full kitchen allowed us to cook and the coffee maker is so convenient that we could easily enjoy coffee of different flavors. Briefly speaking, we'll definitely stay here next time we visit Seattle!"
2197982,36426800,2015-06-28,34949800,Michael,They were very welcoming and provided detailed instructions on their place when we arrived! Their place was located conveniently about 15-20 minutes from downtown Seattle and they had a ton of suggestions for us! Thanks Laura and Hasan!
2197982,36961766,2015-07-03,16463529,Andreas,"We had a great stay, the studio was very clean and comfortable, and had everything we needed for our stay. The park and ride was fab, just 11 minutes to downtown. Wifi was excellent. Laura and Hasan were very friendly and accommodating. Would thoroughly recommend this."
2197982,37785085,2015-07-10,36578110,Patrick,"Laura and Hasan were wonderful hosts. The apartment was clean, spacious, and well outfitted with a large TV, quick wifi, full kitchen, washer & dryer, closet space, and an extremely comfortable bed. They also went above and beyond in providing every conceivable extra--snacks, coupons, recommendations, etc. It's easy to get into Seattle either by bus or Uber/lyft. Overall their hospitality was excellent and I'd recommend them to anyone. "
2197982,38255457,2015-07-14,13560895,Thomas,"Laura and Hasan's place fit us perfectly.  It was clean, well-equipped, filled with extras (chocolate treats, toiletries) and our own private off-street parking.  We will stay there again in the future, if it is available!"
2197982,38618985,2015-07-17,19252262,Xylina,"Great stay at this little place! Great hosts, great location. We'll probably stay again next time we're in Seattle."
2197982,39281304,2015-07-22,21327997,Jenny,Super homey private studio! The room is clean and tidy and well equipped with everything you need to make your stay at Seattle wonderful. I would highly recommend this place!
2197982,39909822,2015-07-27,2199645,Kawthar,"Laura and Hasan were wonderful hosts! Laura communicated with me prior to our arrival and gave me suggestions on what to do in Seattle. We particularly loved their suggestions on ""guidebook"" via Airbnb. The studio was private and as described. "
2197982,40462450,2015-07-31,35905256,Carly,"Laura and Hasan's studio apartment was an absolute dream!  From the moment we made our reservation online to when we left they made sure to have every accomodation you could possibly think of!  Incredibly clean, spacious and comfortable temporary home for traveling.  They are located in a fabulous area of the city and only about 15 minutes away from the downtown core.  We will definitely stay here again should we vacation in the beautiful city of Seattle again soon!"
2197982,40888707,2015-08-03,25274343,Max,"The Apartment was Great. It was very clean, cosy, spacious and inviting. Communication with Laura and Hasan was great aswell."
2197982,41923561,2015-08-10,24794730,Madison,We loved how easy it was getting to the studio and how perfect the parking situation was. You get your own private parking space behind the home that is very convenient. Laura and Hassan were also extremely quick to respond to questions I asked over text etc.and helped us with directions to wherever we needed to go.  I would definitely stay again and recommend to anyone wanting a private convenient place to stay in Seattle. 
2197982,43367475,2015-08-19,23859201,Karin,"My husband and I  had a wonderful time on our trip.  The studio was perfect. It has everything we needed. The place was bright, open and clean, the bed was very comfortable and a very goog coffee maker. The unit was seperat from the house, so it's really quiet and private.  The busstations are nearby.We never got the chance to personally meet Laura and Hasan,  but they are always very quick and responsive with communication.
Thank you Jodie"
2197982,44116062,2015-08-24,34105815,Heather,"We were greeted by Jodi, sister-in-law of Laura's. She was a delight. She showed us into the lovely space, which the pictures represents perfectly. It smelled so clean. There was a basket of snacks which was a bonus and Starbucks coffee for the Keurig. We slept so well on the queen size bed. 

The bathroom accommodations is worth mentioning as well. It was new and shiny, impeccably clean, and soap, shampoo, and conditioner provided.

We also used the washer and dryer, which made things so easy. We did not use the kitchen except for the microwave and coffee maker, but we could have cooked a complete meal if we wanted. It had everything we needed.

We never saw the hosts except for a couple of drive by waves and smiles. I appreciated the privacy, but I sometimes felt we were impeding on their freedom. The location is also perfect; close to the highway, mall, Greenlake, and Sunlight Cafe. We felt very much at home and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this space to anyone looking for a beautiful and affordable experience!

"
2197982,45465368,2015-09-03,34477860,Marie,"What a wonderful stay we had at this well-appointed, immaculately clean, and thoughtfully set-up studio in Seattle! From the minute we stepped off the plane and texted Laura, we were made to feel welcome and at home. I made a joke about needing to stop on the way to get a bottle of wine after our LONG trip, and Laura responded with names and descriptions of no less that 5 different stores to obtain a bottle of wine, complete with their locations relative to our drive from the airport to the studio! 
The location was perfect for us, as our son and daughter-in-law live in the U District, which was a short drive away. Off-street, private parking made it easy for us to come and go at our convenience. Proximity to the highway was great and we were able to get to downtown attractions, wineries, and the airport quickly. 
Because of the full kitchen and dining area, we were able to eat breakfast daily in our room, which saved us money and was convenient after long days of sightseeing. The studio was lovely and bright, and between the windows and ceiling fans we were very comfortable, even when the weather was warm. 
This was our first Air B&B experience, and I cannot imagine anything better! We hope to make this studio our go-to home away from home in Seattle for future visits, and want to thank Laura and Hasan for their warm hospitality! "
2197982,46708792,2015-09-13,36065676,Vanessa,"The host was very friendly. The studio was very clean and neat just as what the pictures show. We had complete privacy which was what we wanted. The location is good. It takes less than 15 minutes to get into Seattle downtown and is one highway exit from Washington University. It is easy to access to highway if you want to go to national parks and islands. However, the parking spot is behind the studio among bushes. It can be a little scary when we came back in dark. The neighborhood was quiet and seemed okay.  All in all, we had a wonderful experience in the studio and with the price, we were happy.   "
2197982,47187926,2015-09-16,42075394,Laura,"The listing description was perfect. Very clean, quiet and very private. This was our first time trying Airbnb and we were very pleased. "
2197982,48897784,2015-09-29,41669148,Cathy,"Accommodations are outstanding!! Very clean, we highly recommend!! This was our first airbnb experience and Laura & Hasan's home made it a truly positive one!!"
2197982,49981159,2015-10-08,40169374,Shane,"  This was our first Airbnb experience and and we're so glad it was at Laura and Hasan's Private Studio.  Our flight was delayed and we didn't arrive until past midnight.  Hasan kindly waited for us and gave us the tour with easy to follow instructions. The place is exactly as you see in the pictures. Clean, cozy and comfortable.  Coming from Hawaii, it was nice to have the gas heater in the studio. The place was quiet, especially since the studio is located on the backside of the house.  Parking is located on the backside of the home, which sure beats street parking.   
   The location was perfect.  It never took us more than 15-20 minutes to get around.  We were surprised at the close proximity to downtown, U District, Ballard, Alki Beach, etc.  The Northgate park and ride was great, too.  We utilized it twice to get to the downtown area and felt safe each time.  
  Anytime we had questions, Laura and Hasan would respond within a few minutes.  They were very helpful and accommodating.
  Since we stayed for a week, we made good use of the fridge and were able to do some laundry towards the end of our trip.  
  I can't tell you how happy we are with our stay.  We hope to book this studio next time we're in Seattle.  
"
2197982,52400524,2015-10-29,37719961,Michael,"Wife & I stayed for 3 weeks in this lovely studio.  It had more than enough space for us. A clean bathroom, a kitchen with full-sized stove & refrigerator, an expandable table for dining, washer & dryer, & a rocking arm chair.

At first, I worried about noise since it is so close to freeway. Fortunately, it was surprisingly calm & quiet. 

Its location was very convenient. It was easy to catch a bus to Downtown from the Northgate Transit Center. Safeway & Whole Foods were within 5 min driving. UW and Green Lake were close enough.

I highly recommend Laura & Hasan's Private Studio if you plan your visit to Seattle."
2197982,55845595,2015-12-06,8858811,William,Laura and Hasan's studio was great!  The place is conveniently located in a safe neighborhood and the hosts were very accommodating.

1790020,8515222,2013-11-03,9689786,Elisa,"My daughter stayed just 1 night with Cc, but said the room & apartment were scrupulously clean, very nicely appointed and comfortable. Also he was so accommodating about the arrangements so everything was settled without a single problem & my daughter was ready to relax & watch a movie instead of worrying about where she would lay her head that evening. Thank you for being a great host & sharing your home.  "
1790020,8616642,2013-11-08,5383485,Giorgenes,"The stay was very comfortable. The house is very cozy and well located with shops around and easy access to downtown.
Calen was a good host and provided with everything I needed."
1790020,8707265,2013-11-12,9820127,Matthew,"Apartment is comfortable and well-(website hidden) Powell was very responsive.  Views from the apartment are indeed stunning.

Our one qualm was that host could have been a little more up-front about the fact that he would be renting multiple rooms to multiple air bnb'ers at the same time.  We did not realize this until after we had confirmed the rental.  It did not end up being a problem, but it would have been nice to have full information."
1790020,8749207,2013-11-15,1389818,Zak,"Very nice and comfortable, and certainly a stunning view off the balcony of Seattle.  Though he stayed elsewhere, Calen was super nice and responsive.  Recommended. "
1790020,8796580,2013-11-18,9771140,Jenna,"We spent two nights at Calen's place while visiting Seattle. He made sure that we were comfortable and had everything we needed, which was much appreciated. The apartment has great views and is extremely clean. It is also conveniently located and there are a ton of things to do in the neighbourhood. We had a wonderful time!"
1790020,8918639,2013-11-25,5556227,Osiris,Very clean house. Great view. Close to everything. Would stay here again 
1790020,9137961,2013-12-09,9815054,Erin,"Cc Powell is a charming host. His apartment is tidy, well organized, and very attractive. The location near Gage Art academy was a huge plus. N

1790020,9428307,2013-12-28,10131528,Silvia,"I definitely recommend this place, clean and comfortable.
Especially if you don't want to drive, everything is at a walking distance, shops, cafés, bus stops and restaurants. The view from the dining room and the balcony is amazing.
Calen is a good host, very responsive and helpful."
1790020,9752892,2014-01-07,6690464,Matthew,I enjoyed my stay at Cc's (website hidden) got back to me quickly to setup all the details. The apartment was generally clean and tidy. Overall it was a good experience.
1790020,9853687,2014-01-14,8371439,April,"Calen was a fantastic host. He took the time to give me some information about the area in addition to making sure I had everything I needed at the apartment. 

The location is spectacular. This will be my first choice every time I come back to Seattle!"
1790020,9884395,2014-01-16,10801260,Madison,"Amazing view, nice place. Would absolutely stay again!"
1790020,9933624,2014-01-20,6122079,Alyssa,"Calen's place was amazing and in a very convenient location. It was pleasure staying at his place and hope to stay again in the future whenever I visit Seattle. He was very responsive and available so my friend and I never felt lost in the city. Also, his dog Lucky was an absolute sweetheart. "
1790020,10118600,2014-02-01,7512941,Chufan,"It was really great staying in Powell's place. Good location! It's quite convenient for grocery shopping and local restaurants. And there are bunch of bus lines for downtown. about 20 mins to get there.
The place itself is cozy and comfortable. I lived there for 12 nights. I did enjoy sitting on the high chair to see the beautiful sunset and space needle. And the room is comfortable. 
Calan is friendly and really responsive. He also gave me advice when I was finding a place to live in Seattle. BTW, I do like Lucky. She is so cute."
1790020,10142659,2014-02-02,1607377,Rachelle,My boyfriend and I stayed in the flat in Seattle and had a great time! The location is very convenient and the flat is super nice. We had everything we needed and were quite comfortable with our stay. I would highly recommend this place for any guests wanting to visit Seattle!
1790020,10311875,2014-02-12,2248554,Liset,"Our time at the apartment of Calen was great! The communication with Calen was very smooth and the room was all set up when we arrived. Especially the breakfast place is great, with a nice view. We also enjoyed the location a lot, a great neighborhood where you wouldn't end up if you'd book a hostel/hotel. The only thing that didn't worked out for us was that the hot water wasn't working. However, Calen was on top of it to fix and it was probably an incidental thing."
1790020,10423589,2014-02-18,5259412,Josephine,"Great location and accommodation. Accommodation was comfortable. Apt is centrally located near great restaurants, bars, and coffee shops. Highly recommend!"
1790020,10539567,2014-02-24,5015274,Sachi,"Cc's  house was clean, comfortable, and very well located.  The view IS great, I wish the weather had been nicer so we could have used to patio more!  My only (small) complaint is that we did not realize that there would be other guests staying in the apartment, and in the morning they got up early and were a little noisy while we were trying to sleep (I don't think they knew we were there either).  Overall it was a great way to experience Seattle on a budget!  "
1790020,10613681,2014-02-27,2715718,Brandon,"Calen was a lifesaver during a recent business trip to Seattle. When my travel arrangements were abruptly changed I was left without a room for the evening. Calen responded to my lodging request with lighting speed and within a matter of minutes I was on my way over to his Capitol Hill apartment. location location location. This apartment was mere blocks from so many of the shops, bars and restaurants that make Capitol Hill. The room was warm, comfortable and smelled of fresh laundry.  Having the bathroom next to the bedroom was very convenient as well. I slept soundly and awoke the next morning re-energized. The view from the balcony was to die for. The ease of booking last minute, the comfortable and well appointed room and excellent location turned my stay in Seattle from a business trip to one of pleasure. I will be giving Calen a heads up next time I am in Seattle and I recommend you do too."
1790020,10675813,2014-03-03,10159932,Violet,Great view! Great host! Very helpful and nice guy.

1790020,10911079,2014-03-12,9617898,Candice,Thank you so much for allowing us to stay! We had a great time in Seattle and the location of your place was just perfect. Hope to stay with you again :)
1790020,10938702,2014-03-14,1249643,Amber,Calen was responsive when I had questions and he allowed me to stay till whenever my ride could get me during the day of check out which was like 5pm and I was so grateful as I had so many bags and not much of anywhere else to go. I'm really grateful for that. The location was PERFECT. I would maybe suggest putting individual locks on the outside of the bedroom doors considering there's usually two separate bookings in the apartment. My bed and sleep were quite cozy.
1790020,11101271,2014-03-20,4275471,Ben,"As like the last time, CC's place was warm and inviting. With a Perfect location and beautiful balcony view on a nice day, his place is a jewel of the emerald city! I will definitely stay there again! "
1790020,11170893,2014-03-24,3331850,Peter,"Calen's spot was ideally situated.  Once we figured out the Seattle public transit system, it was a snap getting to different neighborhoods in the city.  Capitol Hill itself has some great restaurants.  And Calen's tourist guide resources (maps and guidebooks) made discovering Seattle lots of fun."
1790020,11238006,2014-03-25,8616871,Sovannaroth,His place is very clean and has a very stunning view !!! I love that it is very quiet and very close to Volunteer park and broadway! Will definately come back here !!

His balcony is awesome! It's covered and has a cozy sofa with an amazing view!"
1790020,11287859,2014-03-28,4499310,Sarah Dee,"Apartment was in a great location, very close to Capitol Hill! Host was very quick to respond to questions, very helpful! There were a lot of stairs, heads up to folks with mobility issues (my partner has nerve damage in her legs, so it was a little rough for her, but then again, all of Seattle is a little rough for people with mobility issues). Parking in this location was difficult (all restricted with 2-4 hr limits 7am-6pm m-f), but cabs/lyft/uber are great in this area so if you're not driving it's a fantastic spot. "
1790020,11503265,2014-04-05,11524611,Kristin,"Calen was an amazing host!! Even before I arrived, he contacted me to confirm the arrangements and give sine good suggestions and advice. He also checked in during my stay to make sure everything was going well.  He was very available and knew the city well.
The apartment was a cozy place with all the amenities of home.  You cannot beat the location; there was a ton to do and see in the immediate area.  Getting downtown or to other neighborhoods did not take long at all.  
If you are going to Seattle, stay here."
1790020,11583910,2014-04-08,5339230,Tai,"My host was gracious and kind in the face of my inability to travel. Caught the flu, and he was sincerely disappointed we wouldn't meet. I will visit him on my next trip. His location is great, the heart of Seattle and near by daughter. I recommend him highly. "
1790020,11678193,2014-04-11,14100034,Bryan,Cc is a great host. The location is the best! Lots of places to go for food and entertainment. A bus ride or a cheap cab away from downtown Seattle. The other house guests were very friendly.
1790020,11834831,2014-04-16,5540458,Dennis,"i really had a pleasant stay at cc's place.  the view of the seattle skyline from the balcony is fantastic!  the condo is located in the capitol hill neighbourhood and was (for me) a good walking distance to all of the tourist spots and things i wanted to see: the monorail and space needle campus, pike place market, and the ferry terminal to bainbridge (website hidden) was very easy to communicate with and very likeable and accommodating; when i arrived at the condo, he was there to meet me and chat for a while, even though he had someplace to be at that time.  his place is tidy and comfortable.  i only wished i had more time to spend in the city... one day isn't nearly enough... thanks, calin!"
1790020,11904318,2014-04-18,14105586,Justin,Calen was a great host and his place was perfect.  He went out of his way to make it ideal for AirBnBers.  You won't regret staying there!
1790020,11941008,2014-04-19,64516,Ryan,"Calen is a lovely guy. We left our wallet in the room accidentally and travelled back to Los Angeles which could have been a disaster but Calen was so helpful and fedexed it for us. He is really cool and welcoming. Great flat in the best part of town surrounded by bars, shops, great coffee shops..There are 2 rooms. One looked really inviting and well furnished. Our room was still being decorated and basically just a bed and a lamp so we felt the price was perhaps a little high considering but Im sure itll be worth it when its turned into a nice room."
1790020,12096091,2014-04-22,14212127,Aubrey,Calen was a very pleasant host. He was very respectful and made the experience that much better. He answered all of our texts and gave advice to the best of his ability. I would definitely recommend staying with him.

1790020,14712324,2014-06-24,16580138,Cassie,"A friend and I stayed in both private rooms which were both comfy and clean. The location was perfect for walking to downtown and to areas with great night life and restaurants. I would highly recommend Calen's apartment for anyone looking to stay in Capitol Hill or the surrounding area. Unfortunately, we didn't get the chance to meet Calen during our short stay, but he was very nice and always sent quick correspondence. "
1790020,14804118,2014-06-26,16976410,Nancy,"Calen' s has a very nice apartment, we love to stay there, the view from the balcony is quite beautiful. Calen is a nice person, he help us to carry the heavy luggage to the cab.thank you Calen and we will come back to your place next time when we come to Seattle."
1790020,14847146,2014-06-27,17173403,Robert,"Nice place on short notice for first timers using air bnb 

Calen was very patient with us and we appreciated the lock on the bedroom door. 

Calen got back to is quickly and explained how everything worked. 

Great views and very close to downtown.  

It was our first time using this service due to the convention on town but it will not be the last. "
1790020,14979658,2014-06-30,7761070,Lindsay,"Calen wasn't there when we visited, but his house was great for our weekend in Seattle. Such a convenient location, walking distance to so many bars and restaurants. We especially loved sitting on the balcony in the morning, relaxing on the comfortable couch, taking in the amazing view. "
1790020,15242017,2014-07-05,17306186,Zaida,"Calen's place was amazing, especially for my first airbnb experience :) location was great, the house was comfortable and has a beautiful view, and all the little things Calen did to make me feel comfortable really made my stay amazing. Thanks so much Calen!"
1790020,15271670,2014-07-06,3870101,Meredith,"I never got to meet Calen in person, but he was very responsive to any questions we had and super flexible with our schedule (thank you again!).  The place was perfect for us - it was just like we expected, and the location was great for walking to Pine Pike and downtown.  We were really happy and would absolutely stay with Calen again!"
1790020,15414278,2014-07-08,2776188,Megan,"This is a great location to check out the city from -- right in the heart of Capitol Hill with lots of good coffee, shops, etc, nearby.
Easy to book, easy to find, everything went smoothly. Thank you!"
1790020,15543887,2014-07-11,16834998,James,"The place was (website hidden) is very accomadating, shampoo dispensers, water in the rooms, really above and beyond. Great location, walking distance to bars and resturants. Great view of the city. Would most def come back. "

1790020,15818275,2014-07-16,2731906,Sebastian,"I was only in Seattle for a few days, but Calen made sure I had everything I needed, the apartment was clean, centrally located, and had amazing views of the city, I would recommend staying here for anyone"
1790020,15898400,2014-07-17,18123884,Paul,"The host was very on the ball. Made sure we had clear communication and regular updates to meet, even after I moved up my arrival time.  The place is very clean and has everything you need + more. Love the projection screen & comfy couch and room.  Was great to have a bit of time to chat and hang out with him.  The area is great if you love the Capital Hill area.  Will surely look to see if this is available again next time!"
1790020,15962620,2014-07-19,3444425,Michael,Great spot in Capital Hill. Easy communication with host and simple check in process. I would definitely stay here again. 
1790020,16108152,2014-07-22,2995392,Christa,"The apartment was in a great location, and on a quiet street. The bed was comfy and the balcony was an awesome place to watch the sunset over the city! We had a short stay and didn't have a chance to meet Calen, but he had a convenient key-system that made the check-in and check-out completely simple. thanks for sharing your space!"
1790020,16248088,2014-07-24,15199880,Karen,"Calen was an amiable host and gave me the lay of the land and points of interest in the neighborhood.  The bedroom I had was adequate but a little worn.  The space was definitely no frills but in general served my needs.  The condo is three flights up with no elevator.  The view from the condo is a nice lookout over most of the city.  It is conveniently located to all parts of Capitol Hill.  The bathroom and shower housekeeping could have been better in my opinion.  Communication between the hosts and the others sharing the condo with me was severely lacking.  They had no idea I was there and stumbled upon me in the bathroom and were rather vociferous in their disappointed surprise.  I feel better care could have been taken with this.  Also worth mentioning - my bedroom had a leak in the ceiling over the bed.  Luckily this presented itself on my last morning there.  All in all, an okay experience but I wouldn't book here again.  I would prefer a place with no others sharing.  Live and learn on my part.  I feel the pricing could have been better for what it was.  It is my hope that Calen will improve his offering based upon this listing.  Live and Learn on both our parts.          "
1790020,16570338,2014-07-29,12936567,Zilin,Close to downtown 
1790020,16675834,2014-07-31,17133765,Tigh,Amazing set up by Calen. The place was very well cleaned and stocked. Great views and the balcony set up was perfect for watching the sunset with a beer.
1790020,17166839,2014-08-08,3333722,Pandu,"I have a lot of fun during my visit in Seattle, the place is strategically located only several blocks from Broadway St, 12th and Pike St, and 15th Ave where great restos and cafes, bookshops, records stores are. So in terms of location this place is ideal. Calen as the host is very easy to communicate with and very responsive. He provides clear direction and description of the building (sends pictures, nice!) and also makes sure that guests needs are accommodated. A very nice host. The place is as described by the owner, the view is nice especially to watch the sunset. The projector and Roku was a lot of fun, I watched a bit of movie while waiting for my taxi. The place has the feel of a bachelor pad, and it reminds me a lot of a graduate student apartment, which is not bad as it gives the instant welcome feeling but it yes I agree with some comments that say it could use some vacuuming.   "
1790020,17441566,2014-08-12,16628430,Tim,I had a delightful time at Calen's. The room was clean and comfortable. The apartment is very nicely situated in Seattle and is a great launching pad to explore Capitol Hill. Calen was friendly and always promptly answered any questions. I would be very happy to stay with Calen again.
1790020,17547152,2014-08-13,19738447,Peter,"Calen was very helpful in our last minute booking, made it really simple to check in and always remained in contact with us. We only stayed for a short night but the apartment/mini two-room hotel is well run, very clean with everything you would need for a longer stay.  The balcony is quite a nice spot.

Residential neighborhood, parking wasn't easy to find later in the evening but it was just a short walk to the Broadway or the other busier streets of Capitol Hill.
I would recommend this place to others
"
1790020,17590408,2014-08-14,1169191,Cynthia,"Calen was the best host we have ever had.  He knew when to email and when to let us be, the place was spotless, had ALL the amenities (blow dryer, water, shampoo, conditioner, maps of Seattle, brochures) - everything was thoughtful. The room stayed cool the way he had the windows and fan set up. The balcony was my favorite part. I fell asleep watching the downtown view of Seattle and listening to the sound of light traffic in the cool breeze. It was wonderful!"
1790020,17661165,2014-08-15,19809658,Kimberly,I had a wonderful stay and really enjoyed the experience. The location was perfect in Capital Hill and the accommodations were as described. The view from the balcony was beautiful. I would definitely make a return visit!
1790020,17775981,2014-08-17,18593552,Nathalie,"Calen was a very hospitable host- friendly and informative! The apartment was quite nice and in a pretty convenient location. We walked downtown from the apartment on both days, taking in lots of sights and coffee, and it only took about 30 minutes or so... The private room we stayed in was nice and clean... Yes, there is a lovely view from the terrace, and it was nice to sit out there, particularly at night with the city lit up... This was my first Airbnb experience, and I must say it was a positive one! I definitely would recommend Calen and his digs any time."
1790020,18196140,2014-08-23,15441823,Will,"Calen was a wonderful and engaging host. The space was awesome and it was great meeting so many interesting guests. The space was very clean and welcoming and OH MAN that view! I would definitely stay here again if I came back to Seattle. The neighborhood is fantastic as well, theres a ton to do and its all in easy walking distance. "
1790020,18342624,2014-08-25,8316429,Nghi,"This was truly a great place to stay, a beautiful and safe neighborhood. Totally walkable and close to many gems in the city. 

Calen is a seasoned and respectable host. The room was a nice size and well ventilated. Great balcony view too; would come back! Thanks so much. "
1790020,18410252,2014-08-26,15709893,Tricia,"Calen was a good communicator and very nice. The place was Clean, comfortable and convenient.  Plenty of towels. The bed and sheets were comfortable. The fans were nice to have in the bedroom. I would describe it as a bachelor pad experience. Shared hallway bathroom with another guest.  He provided toiletries and blow dryer. 2 waters, but no coffee or tea. The apt was walking distance to a hip area. We easily found free parking. You have to walk up a lot of steps to get to the apt. He had a key box outside which made checking in easy. Calen provided a key to the bedroom which was good because another stranger is sharing the space.  The kitchen is good if you want to cook and there is a nice view. There is a great grocery store in walking distance.  No tv but he had a projector for netflix. Internet worked well.  Thanks for having us! "
1790020,18631283,2014-08-29,1378512,Robyn,This is my second time staying with Calen and everything went well just like the first time. 
1790020,18666530,2014-08-30,1489819,Ryan,"The neighborhood had a lot of great places within walking distance.  We spent a lot of time down by the water which was a short, easy cab ride from his place."
1790020,18992256,2014-09-04,18483204,Erika,"Although we never met Calen in person, he was a wonderful host and easy to get in touch with! The space is exactly how it is shown here. There was another guest in the other room who we saw once or twice, but to be honest we were out of the apartment and exploring the city for the majority of our stay. 

The apartment was clean and cozy, hot water, room to unpack, a cute balcony and kitchen area. The area was great. Only a block or two from a grocery store. Less than a 10 minute walk to a ton of coffee shops, restaurants, bars, and only a $6 Uber/Lyft ride downtown to the heart of the city.  

We had a rental car for one night and had no trouble with street parking right out front, although it may be a bit more difficult during a weekend. All and all, the bus system was easy, Captiol Hill area was safe, and Calen did a great job hosting my boyfriend and I in his apartment. Thanks!"
1790020,19101412,2014-09-06,824557,Jaeeun,"Calen was great with checking in on us when we flew in, and making sure we were comfortable and well taken care of. Our stay was wonderful, and we had a great time there. The location was wonderful, and we just had an overall excellent time. "
1790020,19565959,2014-09-14,2089429,Serena,Our experience in Seattle at Calen 's place was really nice. Communication was clear and the apartment is located in a very nice area! We could walk to bars and restaurants easily.
1790020,19662413,2014-09-15,3683450,Nancy,"Although I did not get to meet Calen, he was very communicative regarding keys & check-in. The location of the place is great- it was walking distance to Pike St and Capitol Hill attractions. "
1790020,19849254,2014-09-19,21172712,Marc,"Calen was professional and responsive throughout my entire stay.  As other reviewers stated, he is also a nice guy and possesses lots of interesting information about Seattle.  

I definitely recommend him to other travelers.   "
1790020,20297198,2014-09-27,20532661,Kate,"Calen was a fantastic host! He was very friendly, helpful, and easy to contact even when he wasn't at the apartment. The place was comfortable, clean, and in a really great location. I would definitely stay here again!"
1790020,20521795,2014-09-30,19537533,Matt,"Calen's place was great to stay at while in Seattle.  The place was tidy and the room was comfortable.  I walked to downtown twice, but there's also a bus only a few blocks away.  Plenty of food and bars also within walking distance."
1790020,20638097,2014-10-02,20182177,Anne,"The apartment was clean. Calen was reachable via email, and quick to respond. The attached balcony had a great view of downtown. Capitol hill is by far my favorite neighborhood in Seattle, and his apt. Is within walking distance to it all. Was thoroughly impressed and would stay again."
1790020,21108403,2014-10-11,7165527,Abdul,"Good location in Capitol Hill, quiet and comfy bed ! "
1790020,21360939,2014-10-15,4317965,Zach,"Everything went smoothly with my stay at Calen's place. Apartment was as advertised, and while I did not get a chance to catch up with Calen in person, he responded well to my emails and texts in the lead-up to my stay.

Instructions on picking up the key from the key box and a map of street parking proved helpful as well. The room is fairly non-descript, nothing fancy, but it gets the job done if you are just in need of a bed for the evenings. Bathroom and rest of the apartment were clean, and the balcony has a nice chair to enjoy a sweet view of the city.

The location of the apartment is its most stellar plus. Calen's place is a good deal to be able to park yourself in a great spot in the city. Bars, coffee shops, etc. all within a short walk within Capitol Hill, and getting to other neighborhoods for further exploration is totally doable by foot or bus. 

Overall, a solid, successful stay. "
