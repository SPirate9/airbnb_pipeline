208356,45064302,2015-08-31,826189,Nick,Excellent location for exploring central Seattle and very good communication from Dirk and Jaq who are dedicated to ensuring you have everything you need. Recommended.
208356,45275593,2015-09-01,37137087,Kumiko,"The place was comfortable to stay. And easy access to downtown.  Jaq was very friendly and helpful. She showed me some of her art works when she was there. And when it's rain, she offered me an umbrella. 
 I could stay very comfortably."
208356,45449782,2015-09-02,9496807,Daniel,"I only stayed 1 night in this spot, but it was perfect for my needs. It is a small space, but if you simply need a bed and a place to do a little work, this spot is ideal. Clean, orderly, and well maintained. Jaq was lovely, and made me feel right at home. "
208356,45514301,2015-09-03,6923605,Katrina,"Really lovely, tidy place and so easy to deal with in the days leading up to my stay, thank you. "
208356,45560694,2015-09-04,11941480,Sebastien,"The room is perfect of you have one night to spend between two trains. I would not spend more than one night as I didn't really feel like home. Everything is really clean and tidy, but so much that we are not sure we can move things, especially with all the instructions to follow, at the end it was not clear for me what was allowed or not, so I prefer didn't touch anything. The bed was really comfortable, and spacious. And the shower really nice!"
208356,45768519,2015-09-06,5581907,Tallulah,Jaq and Dirk were great at communicating exactly what you need to know. The space was clean and modern. It was super convenient. I would definitely stay here again!
208356,46575374,2015-09-12,26265583,Jen,"I absolutely loved staying here and let me tell you why. 
1. It is really close to the Link train so the transition from airport, to the city, to their location was so easy. 
2. It's secure. The entryway is secure, my room was secure
3. Clean, comfy, accommodating environment 
4. This neighborhood is off the beaten path, at least from what I gathered based off what some locals said. This is awesome because it made my experience more authentic versus a straight touristy. A great example is I made friends with the guys who work in the sushi bar next to the restaurant. Even after closing I would drop by and hang with them before I turned in for the night. Very cool! And great sushi, so go there!
5. I was told twice that I was staying in the ""sketchiest"" neighborhood in town. Honestly, like anywhere else, if you are a smart person with common sense, you'll be fine. I was probably more cautious at times when it was dark, example on my way to the train station this morning, but that's mostly because I'm a single female traveling alone. Had there been anyone else with me, I would have thought twice about it. "
208356,46743501,2015-09-13,2645820,Kate,"We had a great time staying at Dirk and Jaq's loft. They were always very prompt in responding to our questions and offered some good tips with regard to parking and neighbourhood highlights. The place was clean, quiet and checking in/dropping off luggage/checking out was incredibly straight forward. My friend and I were just in town for fun, but I would definitely recommend the loft if you were in town for a football or baseball game as it is super close to the stadiums. "
208356,47083569,2015-09-15,958306,Courtney,Very clean and quiet building. Perfect for a Seattle get away.  
208356,48190488,2015-09-24,31358828,Kelli,I had such a pleasant stay at the loft! It really was above and beyond what I was expecting. They gave great detailed instructions so there were no questions. The space was tidy and I was so impressed with all of the amenities. I will be staying at the loft from now on when I make my way up to Seattle. 
208356,48499775,2015-09-27,33602220,Sukmi,The place was very clean and the bed was very comfortable.  It is very close to a Light Rail station.  The neighborhood was relatively calm and found parking easily.
208356,48911736,2015-09-29,16510790,Mark,"Easy instructions. Checked in with us as soon as we arrived. Everything as described and pictured. Always had access to kitchen and bathrooms, no disturbances or noise issues. 

Note this is in Chinatown near Pioneer Square, but we like to be in the middle of it so it was great and easy access to all the attractions we wanted."
208356,49135943,2015-10-01,13095914,Stephen,"Our stay here was perfect. Great location and a comfortable, CLEAN, room. Check in and checkout were painless, highly recommend. "
208356,49623395,2015-10-05,36046446,Dalton,"This is an amazing space for any type of visitor - extremely clean and cozy. Jaq and Dirk are very gracious and welcoming and allowed me to check in early, which gave me the rest of the day to explore the city. The building is only about a mile from the prime downtown locations - Pike Place Market, SAM, etc..., which made everything perfectly accessible, and just a few blocks from the stadiums and the light rail/public transportation. The building is safe and secure and sits in a charming neighborhood. Overall, great space, great hosts, great location!"
208356,50071532,2015-10-09,36192931,Lorenzo,"The location of the place was very convenient. It was a block away from the International District bus and link station and near several restaurants, Bank of America, the post office and an Asian supermarket (Uwajimaya). It was also very near the football and baseball stadiums. Jaq, who I met upon my arrival, was gracious enough to allow me to use their phone to get a cab going to the Seahawks game since my bus from Portland arrived late so I was rushing (although the stadium was a 15 minute walk). The place itself was very clean and well-maintained. The bed and the sofa were cozy and comfortable. Since I was not used to cold weather, the heater was perfect.  The bathroom was spacious and squeaky clean. Jaq was nice enough also to check on me and my stay. If you have a lot of luggage or have a hard time taking the stairs, I wouldn't recommend this place though for you, but other than that, the place is highly recommended.  "
208356,50307986,2015-10-11,28274378,David,"Had a really great stay here. Unfortunately due to my late arrival and early departure, I didn't get to meet Dirk or Jaq, but they kept in touch and made everything extremely easy for me to check in and out. The room itself was clean and surprisingly roomy. If I'm ever back in Seattle, I'd definitely look to stay here again."
208356,50679743,2015-10-13,37897612,Bryce,The listing and description was exactly how it is advertised. Everything was clean and tidy. The bed was very comfortable. Definitely a great place for 1 or 2 people if they are exploring the city and just need a place to crash.
208356,50770802,2015-10-14,24896781,Zhongning,The room is nice and neat with the public kitchen and restroom. The heater is lifesaving considering the cold night in Oct.
208356,50944425,2015-10-16,9324788,Alice,"Jaq and Dirk's place was exactly as described in the listing and even though it was shared bathrooms the facilities were very clean and very well maintained. It was the perfect place for my husband and I during our 1 day stopover in Seattle. Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to meet Jaq and Dirk in person, but Jaq has been very responsive via online communications. Their guest book also had a lot of helpful hints and tips for first timers in Seattle and also information about the neighbourhood. Would not hesitate to recommend their place at all! Thanks again for hosting our stay. :) "
208356,51058159,2015-10-17,27491840,Emily,Great place close to downtown. Really clean and well priced. Thanks! 
208356,51279858,2015-10-19,18113832,Paige,"We felt very welcomed when we arrived. Dirk and Jaq let us know to contact them if we had any questions at all, which made us feel at ease and comfortable.Everything was explained very well to us and the apartment was exactly as the listing had outlined. We really enjoyed the neighbourhood, as there was many close by restaurants and coffee shops. We also loved that we could walk downtown easily. "
208356,51597599,2015-10-21,6464999,Graham,"This is a great space, I felt safe and comfortable and it was well labeled! I'll be staying here again when I'm in Seattle again. "
208356,51734595,2015-10-24,12957423,Allison,This place was great and I loved my stay!
208356,51855986,2015-10-24,8389747,Åsa,"Me and a friend had a wonderful stay at this loft apartment. The information provided about the place was thorough and accurate. The room itself was comfortable, clean and neat and we appreciated that there was a guide book provided and the access to WIFI. We only spent one night in the building, but the amenities where top-notch. Lovely shower with a large array of free to use soaps, shampoos and conditioners. The location of this place is also very convenient. I would definitely stay again!"
208356,52363663,2015-10-28,9621067,David,"Wonderful artist loft. Offers all of the comforts of a guest accommodations. Internet, comfortable loft bed, great shower and small kitchen. 

Very private room. Great artwork in room. Tasteful, modern furnishings. Very clean.

Especially enjoyed the one of a kind Panama Hotel nearby: great coffee, tea and environ for quiet workspace. "
208356,52704764,2015-11-01,10590463,Cameron,"I was very happy staying in the room. Everything was available and as described. As the photo shows, it's a climb to reach the bed, but it's not a problem. You just need to be careful as you're going up and down the ladder. I'm more than happy to recommend you come and stay with Dirk and Jaq."
208356,53177567,2015-11-06,21791805,Christophe,C'est la seconde fois que je loue un appartement là. Il n'y a aucune mauvaise surprise. J'apprécie la propreté du logement. Je le loue lorsque je vais à Seattle car il est proche du Link et Train vers l'aéroport.
208356,53296265,2015-11-07,3310811,Peter,"Lovely accommodations, central to Downtown Seattle. 
Wonderful unit, everything was well organized, clean and the unit was especially quiet. 
I'd stay again anytime. Thanks Dirk and Jaq!"
208356,53333734,2015-11-08,40341056,Precious,"The room was nice felt like home. Specially, it was nice how they keep a room warm!(it was super cold cause of raining all day long when i stayed in seattle) I am sure that i will stay here again whenever i come seattle again! Thank you for such a good hospitality. God Bless you :-) "
208356,53652099,2015-11-10,16011396,Amanda,"The artist loft was exactly as depicted, and very clean. The hosts made everything very simple with convenient post-it notes, and everything that you could possibly need was provided, from hangers to the password to the fast wifi to shampoo to tips about taking your key with you. I enjoyed the privacy and the tv, a relaxing two nights after an intense work conference in Seattle. I easily walked to Pioneer Square for the underground tour (10 minutes I think?), and down to Pike Market (about 20 minutes). Neighborhood may not be the best for a single woman at night, but I did not feel unsafe at all, and took an Uber when coming in later than 11pm. Loved this place and would definitely recommend! Thank you to Dirk and Jaq for being such great, thoughtful hosts!"
208356,53888114,2015-11-14,3030539,Cassie,"My husband and I stayed at Dirk and Jaq's artist loft and had a wonderful time! The room and space was very clean and surprisingly private. Before we arrived we weren't sure if it would be awkward walking down the hall, through the kitchen with our shower stuff, but we hardly ran into anyone the four nights we stayed! The loft is in a fabulous location too! Walking distance to some of the ""must sees"" of Seattle and only a few blocks to the metro station. Jaq also leaves a lot of notes around so there's no confusion on what you can use or how things work. Thanks for a great stay!"
208356,53978158,2015-11-15,45547157,Phuong Linh,The hosts were very accommodating and answered my questions promptly through the app. I did not have any problems. Everything in the suite was detailed with instructions and the additional toiletries/products available was nice. We only stayed one night in Seattle and wished we could have stayed longer.
208356,54176138,2015-11-16,12415112,Rachel,Great loft in excellent location close to stadium.  The place was very clean and the bed was cozy and comfortable.  
208356,54352403,2015-11-18,30856664,Steph,Lovely and quiet space. Very easy to get to from the airport. Easy directions and I enjoyed the cozy bed and linens. Thank you!
208356,54611629,2015-11-22,56192,Phoebe,"Perfect central landing spot for an early morning Amtrak ride! Jaq was organized and so easy to communicate with. The loft is quiet, pleasant, and had everything we needed. The memory foam loft bed is super comfy. We really enjoyed having cute gift shops, many Asian restaurants, and a huge Japanese grocery store just outside the building. It was a very short walk to Amtrak even with luggage. We would definitely stay again the next time we are passing through Seattle."
208356,54781277,2015-11-23,5200650,Ru,Everything worked out perfectly:)
208356,55194643,2015-11-29,3635470,Pavani,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at our loft in Seattle, thanks to Jaq and Dirk. They were super helpful and have set up the place beautifully. The room is minimalistically designed and is clutter free with one of the most comfy beds ever! Jaq was always available to help out if need be and we had zero hitches during our stay here. The loft is perfect for two people, and is a short walk away from most places. It's close to public transport and super easy to Uber to and from. I look forward to staying here the next time I'm in Seattle. "
208356,55428870,2015-12-01,21916941,Dominique,"This is a very cool and fun place in an interesting neighborhood. It's very central, conveniently located near the International district and steps away from the airlink to downtown & the airport. The room is really a small studio, with the bed on mezzanine level. A large, comfortable (shared) shower & toilet area is located at the other end of the loft, and a kitchen where one can make coffee/tea. All very clean and modern, in an artist's loft. Dirk and Jaq also were flexible about leaving the bags in the common area while we were running around Seattle. A very nice experience."
208356,55794959,2015-12-06,11477732,Keon,A great comfortable space to stay for a couple days. I had a great birthday weekend in Seattle great sushi downstairs!  Did not see my hosts or virtually anyone else during my stay. Very quiet and perfect for my needs.  The only criticism would be they are a little note happy. They leave little notes everywhere in tiny print which is fine if you can squint bleary eyed at two am when you want a glass of water or try to turn off the fan you'll be ok. Otherwise Airbnb Perfection!
208356,56062248,2015-12-08,4546371,Gus,"The artist loft is exactly as advertised!  A working studio building, its not quite as cozy as homes or other apartments, but it is in a great location, clean and perfectly suitable for a great time in Seattle.  Owners were great at communication and directions were clear and simple.  "
208356,56299273,2015-12-12,3239842,Melissa,"My friend and I had a great stay at Dirk and Jaq's place! The other residents and guests are quiet, clean, and considerate. The bathroom and kitchen are so sparkling you wouldn't think they're shared. The room and bed were so comfortable we had trouble leaving in the morning. The neighborhood has lots of great international places to eat within walking distance, art galleries, and the train stop was right around the corner for easy airport access. Downtown is just a 5 minute ride away, or 20 minute walk. Dirk and Jaq themselves weren't present for our stay, but kindly checked in with us over messages to make sure everything was going smoothly. We braved a very stormy Seattle for this trip but Dirk and Jaq's place made it worth it!"
208356,56714347,2015-12-17,40232828,Hanna,"Dirk & Jaq's place was lovely and clean! There were many convenient asian restaurants and coffee shops in the neighborhood and it was only a short walk to pioneer square, and only another 10 minutes to pike market. Overall, the space worked really well for us and looked very much like the pictures. "
208356,56885458,2015-12-19,4246521,Katharina,The room was exactly as shown in the pictures and is located very conveniently in the pioneer square area. Jaq was very helpful in giving us some tips on how to spend the evening. The place is clean and the bed very comfortable. I recommend a stay here!

4569115,23883490,2014-12-13,18024878,Cheryl And James,"Miranda is an amazing host. Great communication and attentive to all of our needs. Wonderful location, close to everything."
4569115,23971544,2014-12-15,24425622,Justine,"Miranda and Mike were very welcoming, helpful and friendly! The apartment was perfect, right in the heart of bell town with everything we needed close by! View of the water, with a comfortable and cozy feel! 
With some helpful suggestions from Miranda on restuarants and bars, they were great hosts and we would love to stay with them again! "
4569115,24318378,2014-12-25,24244325,Anthony,Nice place!
4569115,24351363,2014-12-26,10722904,Arnaud,Miranda was very welcoming and the check-in process went very well. The place was accurately described and one thing I loved was the great location and the cleanliness of the place. I would definitely recommend this place!! Thanks Miranda!
4569115,24426592,2014-12-28,24159670,Stella,The location was perfect and Michael made us feel welcome with excellent advice on where to eat and drink in the neighbourhood. The champagne and chocolates were a very nice 'Christmas' touch! We were very comfortable and had everything we needed. All in all a lovely stay for our first visit to Seattle. Thank you very much Miranda and Mike.
4569115,26039123,2015-02-01,7119177,Thomas,"What a beautiful spot! Great views, relaxing, quite, and near tons of cool places. The place is super clean and comfortable, and our host Mike was great. Lots of restaurants/bars near by. I was very happy with my stay. If you're looking for a place in Seattle to have a vacation, this is an awesome location. Highly recommended. "
4569115,26268955,2015-02-08,20746869,Daisuke,"It has been a wonderful stay at Miranda's apartment. She made our check in smoothly.
The unit is large enough, clean and comfortable. It has also a nice view. We didn't have a chance to use the terrace but it would be nice to have a relax drink when the weather is fine.

She sent some chocolates and a bottle of sparkling wine as the welcome gift which made our stay even pleasant. 

She is very thoughtful host. We would highly recommend!
Thanks a lot Miranda! 
"
4569115,26495585,2015-02-14,25830870,睿,"Such a nice apartment. Comfortable, clean and spacious. And also, passionate household made us felt at home absolutely. Really like here, hope go there again when I visit Seattle next time."
4569115,26685592,2015-02-17,1172017,Samantha,"Very clean, bright and well-located apartment in quiet building. Great beds, linens, shower, TV access. Miranda was a fantastic host (thanks for the flexible check-in!)."
4569115,28254241,2015-03-21,26927561,Jeffrey,"The apartment is beautiful, clean, and has an amazing view.  I loved my stay here!  Miranda and Michael were exceedingly professional and helpful with anything I needed.  Would recommend to any friend or family member.  "
4569115,28453331,2015-03-23,523311,Mark,"the host was amazing. She was very responsive! the apartment was a great deal, especially for being in belltown. What a great location!"
4569115,28715864,2015-03-29,6375680,Amanda,"Our host is super friendly and considerate. She contacted me before the trip to make sure we would have a smooth checkin and everything that we need,  and also during the trip if there was still something that she could help with. What's more, she left a bottle of wine and some candies to welcome us. We thought that was very nice of her. 

The apartment was very clean and neat. A lot of space even for 4 people to stay. And we had everything we need: extra sheets and blankets, detergent, body wash, soap, tissues, toilet paper, etc. The location of the apartment is perfect. 10 mins walk to Space Needle, Shiro's Sushi, and the Restaurant Lola; 15 mins walk to Pike Place Market; and there are many cafes and diners if you would like grab quick breakfast, and bars if you feel like having a few drinks after a long day. 

Anyway, I would highly recommend this airbnb to people who will visit Seattle for the first time and want to have great experience. "
4569115,29917784,2015-04-14,3127511,Gwilym,"Eve was a wonderful host, she was there to greet us, gave us a advice on how to best enjoy Seattle and answered all my queries quickly and effectively, I really could not have asked for more.

The apartment was quiet and well located, we had a lovely time. Thank you Eve."
4569115,30334944,2015-04-20,26708785,Melissa,"This is my first time using airbnb and it has been amazing. The place we stayed was beautiful and central. I could see the water and Mt. Rainier from the balcony, HUGE PLUS!!! Only negative is the obstruction of view by the building a few blocks in front but it wasnt a big deal. Thats the built environment, afterall. This place is super close to the best bakeries and eateries ive had in Seattle. I loved being so close to the hot spots of seattle either by walking or uber or bus. The host, Eve, is amazing. She was willing to make herself available if we needed assistance and was willing to be a bit flexible. She's very good with responding to any questions in a timely manner. She was also able to host us in a quick manner. I had a previously booked place but that fell through and I found out by the following day she was able to host us with only a week til my trip. It really was the right choice for what we needed."
4569115,30671905,2015-04-26,25767651,Christina,We loved staying in Eve and Michaels apartment!  The apartment  is very walkable and conveniently located between space needle and pike place market. The master bed was comfy and the views were enjoyable. Eve was very reponsive and helpful to all our concerns and questions. I would recommend eve apartment to anyone
4569115,31606699,2015-05-07,31657628,Ellie,Eve is an amazing host. We arrived a couple hours later from our scheduled arrival time but Eve was kind enough to wait for us and show us the room and the garage. The apartment is sweet and clean. We were able to find everything we needed. Thanks to Eve we had a pleasant trip to Seattle! 
4569115,32344815,2015-05-17,30005185,Veronica,"Our first Airbnb experience was wonderful thanks to Eve and Michael’s amazing apartment and hospitality.  From the booking experience to reservation reminders, check-in and check-out, Eve was attentive and available.  She was willing to be flexible with our arrival time and met us right as scheduled.  In addition, she checked in with us during our stay to make sure that we were comfortable and that all was to our liking.  It was certainly nice to know that she was there for us for any questions we had and even with restaurant recommendations.  The apartment was spotless, beautifully decorated and very comfortable.  It was also in a perfect location—an easy walking distance to many of the downtown attractions we visited.  And, it was such a treat to receive a delicious bottle of wine and some granola bars after our long trip—a very thoughtful gesture.  We hope to stay at this apartment again during out next trip to Seattle and we will certainly recommend it to our friends.  The whole process couldn’t have been better.  Thank you!!!"
4569115,32814801,2015-05-22,26807933,Julien,"We had a great time in Eve and Michael's apartment.  The place is spacious, very well appointed and very clean.  It's right in the heart of downtown and you can essentially walk everywhere (market, pier, needle, etc...).  Eve greeted us and showed us around even though we got in late in the evening, which was nice.

Overall a great stay and a great place!"
4569115,33089341,2015-05-25,29595092,Nathan,"Eve was a great host and the apartment was awesome.  Eve was very responsive and provided us with recommendations and answered questions very quickly. The apartment itself was very clean and homely. Comfortably fit my wife and I and my friend and his girlfriend. The location is also great. There are a ton of bars, restaurants, Pike's Market, and more within minutes walking distance. Thanks, Eve!"
4569115,34168283,2015-06-05,34455015,Gail,"This was a great airbnb experience!  Eve has it all down. She is professional, prompt, accommodating, and provides very clear instructions.  This apartment is so nice.  Spotless, super comfy beds, and just everything about the apartment is top notch.  The location is great, too.  I highly recommend Eve and Michael's place.  The only downside I could identify: there is no cable/satellite TV for sports."
4569115,34625736,2015-06-10,1764549,Lillya,"The location was (email hidden)ry central for my needs and plenty of great restaurants in the area. The apartment was spacious, well furnished and had a good ay out. I asked for an early check in and a late check out and both were allowed to me. Eve was very responsive at all times and a great host. "
4569115,34839669,2015-06-12,2956623,Sahab,"Very professional.  Will definitely use again if we stay in Seattle.  Great location, 10 mins walk to Pike Market."
4569115,35546344,2015-06-20,30017976,Sue,"Fantastic location! We were not able to meet Eve, but our hosts had left a warm welcome message and a bottle of wine. A great welcome after many airline issues! This was within walking distance of the space needle and Pike Place Market. The kitchen could use a few more utensils and dishes, but we made it work! Would highly recommend this property!"
4569115,36269733,2015-06-27,30077024,Steven,"Eve's unit was very nice and clean. I LOVE the location. A few blocks from Pikes (walking distance), but not close enough that you are mobbed by crowds. She is very hospitable and always available when I had questions. I would definitely stay there again when I go back to Seattle :).

Steve"
4569115,36586450,2015-06-29,279154,Yasmin,"This modern apartment had an amazing location in downtown Seattle. We could walk to Pike Place Market, the sculpture gardens and tons of local and amazing restaurants. Plus, there's a view of the water right from the living room! Eve was incredibly helpful before our stay, making sure I had all the information necessary and allowing an early check-in to ensure we had a comfortable stay. I definitely recommend this place for anyone looking to explore Seattle. "
4569115,37085543,2015-07-04,7366550,Erica,"After looking at many airbnb options, I chose this place because it was only a few blocks from the waterfront and it was in a cool hip neighborhood. Eve was perfectly accommodating especially since our visit was during a rare hot weather spell in Seattle and she provided us with several fans  to cool us down. Beds were very comfortable and the place was clean and homey. "
4569115,38113837,2015-07-13,31735099,Craig,"Everything was just as described! Eve was very accommodating with all the arrangements and we really enjoyed out quick stay in Seattle! Highly recommend. Thanks, Eve!"
4569115,39075766,2015-07-20,17068346,Konstantin,"The apartment was beautiful. Perfect in terms of location because it was close to everything we needed(space needle, restaurants, pike market). Apartment also has a beautiful, spacious roof deck with spectacular view of the space needle at night.
We were greeted by Eve's associate who was friendly and answered all of our questions and gave good recommendations about the area.
Would definitely stay there again if ever in the area and would recommend it to anyone else who's planning a trip to Seattle.
Thank you!"
4569115,39563645,2015-07-24,33974422,Eric,"Exactly as it appears - a no frills, clean 2 bedroom conveniently located in Belltown. The place lacks a bit in amenities and polish, but the price keeps the fifth star.

Easy street parking in off hours. Wifi, kitchen and washer/dryer all worked great.

Eve was proactive to make sure things were smooth and responsive, made sure I at least had a bottle of wine on arrival . . just what I want in a host."
4569115,39743189,2015-07-26,11167847,Gagan,We had a great experience booking with Eve. She arranged an earlier check in time for and gave us very detailed instructions for everything we needed. The apartment was exactly what we were looking for. I would highly recommend booking with Eve.

4569115,41736502,2015-08-09,31372042,Kevin,"Our stay was from Sunday August 2-9.  Morgan and Eve were very accomodating as hosts.  Easy to reach and quick to help with any of our needs.

The apartment was clean and furnished with all the necessary amenities to make our stay an enjoyable experience.  

Locationwise, her place is hard to beat.  We were there to attend the Dota 2 International tournament held at Key Arena - which is within 10 minutes walking distance to the arena.  Other places such as Pike Place Market were nearby as well.

All in all, we couldn't have had a more enjoyable stay! =]"
4569115,42514242,2015-08-14,989272,Elizabeth,Super clean. Excellent city location to all attractions. Fast communication and flexible! Would definitely stay here on our next trip to Seattle.

Je conseil grandement cet appartement pour quelques jours sur Seattle. Merci"

4569115,44708568,2015-08-28,11159775,Alexander,"The location was great for our business trip: easy walk to downtown and good restaurants nearby. The apartment was very clean, roomy and has comfortable beds.
Morgan was very accomodating with our earlier check-in (and subsequently delayed flight).

Would defenitly recommend and book again."
4569115,45097392,2015-08-31,14504757,Erica,Really great location with a lot of restaurants to walk to nearby. There's readily available street parking that you need to pay for. The apartment is spacious with nice furnishing. The bed was a bit hard for me though but seemed fine for my husband and mom. Would recommend staying here again. 
4569115,47593332,2015-09-20,14825873,Larry,Our stay in Seattle was definitely enhanced by staying at Danielas apartment it was located perfectly for the sites around the waterfront. There's lots of interesting places nearby. Daniela supplied heaps of support as well Would stay here again next time 
4569115,48344591,2015-09-25,33507357,Haining,"Nice warm apartment. Close to downtown, and there are restaurants open whole night around. Everyone is good, but the washing machine is too high class to use... Can't figure out anyway. Daniela tried hard to help."
4569115,48735054,2015-09-28,4397812,Liz (& Kelvin),The apartment was very comfortable and in an ideal location. We enjoyed our stay very much. 
4569115,50569858,2015-10-12,6942062,Melissa,"Myself and 3 girlfriends stayed at Daniela's place for 4 nights and couldn't have asked for a better apt/location. The location is great- walking distance to tons of restaurants, bars, and attractions such as Pike's Place and the Space Needle. We did rent a car and though Daniela's place does not offer parking, we had no trouble finding street parking both during the day and at night. Although we never met Daniela in person, she was very response to all my texts/ calls/ questions and even provided us with a long list of recommendations and suggestions to see and do around the city. She even left us a bottle of wine and a $40 gift certificate to a near by restaurant. We absolutely enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend this apartment to others. "
4569115,50985269,2015-10-16,346087,Retesh,"Perfect apartment in a perfect location! The apartment is very clean and it's also well equipped. Daniela was very happy to accommodate our requests for check-in and out. Furthermore, you have a breathtaking view of downtown from the apartment. We were very impressed. It's even better than in pictures ! Very hard to do better !!! If you come in Seattle this is the place to stay!!!"
4569115,51223540,2015-10-18,2090631,Kathy,"My friends and I had a great experience staying at this apartment.  Within minutes, we could walk to the Space Needle and Chihuly Museum; cafe, bars, and restaurants; and the waterfront.

The apartment was clean and spacious, with comfy beds, pillows, and pretty linens. There were plenty of clean towels in the bathroom.  The kitchen had basic dish- and cookware, though unfortunately the plentiful coffee in the cupboard were whole bean and we could not find a coffee grinder.

The balcony was nice to have, and we had a great view from there.

In addition, Daniela was a great host. She was responsive, detailed, and welcoming. She even gave us a bottle of wine!
"
4569115,54034310,2015-11-15,3230508,Kerry,Overall the place was awesome.  Very spacious for downtown apartment.  I liked that the 2 bedrooms were far apart.  We were greeted with a nice bottle of wine so that was a nice surprise. I would stay again and surely recommend this space to others.
6073437,33522342,2015-05-29,1765670,Melody,"Chris was a great host; communicated well leading up to our visit; was there to meet us and answer any questions when we arrived and very helpful.  He was even kind enough to let us use some of his detergent when we needed to wash a load of clothes.
The space was good- very comfortable and everything we needed was provided.  We didn't ever cook a meal, but the kitchen had all the basics one would need. There were even the makings for coffee and packets for making a pitcher of lemonade. The bed was comfortable.
We loved being right on Green Lake and walked all the way around it each day we were in Seattle.  Glorious location!!!"
6073437,34038386,2015-06-03,32859703,Maureen,Thanks Chris for a wonderful stay. We really enjoyed the view/access to Greenlake. You place is great and you were very accommodating.
6073437,34444597,2015-06-08,24973121,Jodi,"The apartment was spacious, comfortable, private, fully stocked and clean.  Chris made check in simple, as we arrived late at night.  I loved that Chris provides a dedicated parking space. Chris was a gracious host, checking in with us just to be sure we had all we needed. Thank you Chris, we had a wonderful stay! "
6073437,34715992,2015-06-11,32702710,Brenda,"Chris was a lovely host, the house was comfortable, clean, and in a very nice location.  we had a wonderful time walking around the lake which is just across the street from the house.  There are many restaurants within walking distance.  Overall a very nice place."
6073437,35385933,2015-06-18,32522941,Gayle,Great location with a view of the lake! Restaurants and other amenities are within walking distance. Comfortable bed and clean place. Host is available if you need anything. 
6073437,35799949,2015-06-22,16498395,Jane,"Chris sent excellent driving instructions to his apartment, and left a key accessible for our late arrival.  The apartment was lovely, as described, and well stocked for cooking and making a home for the days we were using it.  We never met Chris, but he was in touch by email, and when I made a request to him, he responded quickly, and the reading light I was requested was on the doorstep by evening.  This is a lovely apartment in a lovely neighborhood."
6073437,36679209,2015-06-30,32933022,Alana,"I felt very welcome at Chris' beautiful home. The neighborhood is the primary reason I initially opted to stay here, but the home and host are reason enough to want to make this my permanent home-away-from-home in Seattle. The description of the rental was spot on. Everything that was promised was provided - plus even more nice surprises and amenities. The neighborhood is fabulous, and I can't imagine anyplace nicer in the entire city for this price. I ran the lake every morning and would relax on the deck later to watch other people running, walking, strolling, fishing, boating, etc. Wonderful!
"
6073437,37342959,2015-07-06,34925571,Nancy,"Although technically a studio, very spacious with different living areas including an eat in kitchen.  Fabulous location.  Close to restaurants and shops and beautiful view of the lake.  Nice little porch to sit and view the lake with a breeze which we needed because we were there during a heat wave and no one in Seattle has air conditioning.  Didn't get a chance to meet Chris but I'm sure he would of been helpful if we needed anything."
6073437,38996537,2015-07-20,29027274,Tracey,Very comfortable. Great location. Walk to shops and swimming lake. 
6073437,39301171,2015-07-22,36116696,Victoria,"The place is nicely decorated, clean and super convenient with its own entrance and kitchen.  There is even couple outdoor spaces overlooking the lake. The location could not be more perfect - central enough that you are close to things to do, yet wit a real feel for what it is like to live in Seattle.  You can ride the bus downtown and be there in 20 minutes.  We did not get the chance to meet Chris but he was super responsive and a great host.  "
6073437,39756933,2015-07-26,10530367,Jonathan,Unit has the wonderful home feeling. Very comfortable and quite. I wish I would have found this place sooner cause its a gem!
6073437,40118714,2015-07-28,34210229,Karin,"Beautiful view of green lake. Nice location.
The house was spacious, well decorated and very clean.
We had a great experience and will definitely come back some day.
Thank you Chris!
"
6073437,40495057,2015-07-31,11312666,Quinn,"Chris's place was amazing! The best air bnb we have done yet. Everything was immaculate, clean, and comfortable. We spent 3 nights there and were sad to leave. The location right on the lake is great. We tooks walks around the lake every night. Chris even let us use his kayak on the lake. Our communication with Chris was easy and timely. We will definitely stay here again. Thank you very much. "
6073437,40754256,2015-08-02,27812689,Terra,"This studio is lovely and we really enjoyed our stay. The location is great (very close to the lake with walking trails, coffee shops/restaurants) and it's incredibly spacious. Chris made us feel so welcome and the apartment had everything we needed! The lavender scented sheets were a particularly nice touch :). We would definitely stay here again!"
6073437,41379903,2015-08-07,5009048,Tracey,"We stayed at Chris ' s studio while on a summer trip to Seattle and LOVED IT! What a gorgeous location on Greenlake. The apartment is very roomy, sunny, comfortable and has a wonderful deck to relax on with a great view of the lake/sunset. This neighborhood is sweet, quiet and away from the city. However,  it has super easy access to downtown Seattle. We hopped on the 16 bus just outside our door and it dropped us a short walking distance to Pikes Market.  If you love  quirky go to the next town over (Willingford)and have dinner at Bizzaro Italian! So good and they have home made gluten free pasta. We hope to be back in Seattle one day and when we are we would love to stay at Chris ' s place again."
6073437,42426960,2015-08-13,7730194,Neil,"This unit is a real gem. So many things to like about it - beautiful view of the lake, exceptional job the owner has done restoring this Craftsman-era building, the owner's sensitivity in furnishing and maintaining the living space, spaciousness and light of the space, and just a very peaceful feeling both inside the unit and outside on the balcony. Green Lake is just a few steps away. Great experience with the owner - more than ready to be helpful. Would not hesitate to stay here again if available."
6073437,43052471,2015-08-17,35462707,Sara,All the necessities we need were available. Very homey.

6073437,45116083,2015-08-31,7632381,Jacqueline,"Chris was very helpful and communicative during the entire booking process. The place was beautiful and as described- perhaps even more spacious than the pictures make it appear!
"
6073437,45618425,2015-09-04,42599981,Ginette,"It was our first time using Airbnb and what a great experience we had. Chris place was exactly as described and even more than expected. Great location, the neighborhood is full of restaurants, coffee shops, and the overall area is beautiful with the lake, trails, etc. We would definitely choose this place again next time we visit Seattle."
6073437,47214092,2015-09-16,43694822,Tom,"Great neighborhood, and a delightful place to stay, we hated to see it end, and would definitely chose to stay here again!"

다운타운에 가는 버스정류장까지의 거리도 가깝고 커피숖과 레스토랑이 있는 타운도 걸어서 5분정도였어요. 다음에 그린레이크를 방문하더라도 재방문하고 싶은 편한 숙소였습니다. ^^"

6073437,48249148,2015-09-24,8145697,Hattie,"Very nice place!  Well kept, and it even included my favorite tea.  It was also nice that it had cable, and some great dvds to choose from.  We had a good time there, although it was almost too spacious for me!  I like cozy places."
6073437,49157502,2015-10-01,20626918,Maple,"we stayed in Chris's house for three nights. The house located just next to Green lake, great view and quite convenient to everywhere. The house is exactly like the description and equited with all things you will need even for a longer stay. Chris is quite a nice landload and i would like to recommend his property to everybody who is going to visit seattle. "
7322718,40374362,2015-07-30,27384303,Chris,"Our hosts were incredibly helpful and attentive.  House could have been cleaner when we arrived, but it was their first time and they were extremely helpful.  It's definitely an older home, but certainly charming."

5671843,29805704,2015-04-12,102703,Paolo,"Emiliya's room is very pleasant, very comfortable, and is in a great location. Ballard is one of Seattle's up-and-coming districts and Emiliya's house is a 10/15-minute walk away from dozens of excellent restaurants and interesting stores. Overall, this is very good value accommodation for the price. 

We only stayed one night at Emiliya's place, but she did everything she could to make us feel welcome and help us get around. We particularly appreciated the fact that she let us use her parking spot for several hours after we had checked out, so that we could hang around Ballard for brunch before leaving town."

Thanks Emiliya! Was just what I needed."
5671843,30815972,2015-04-27,30426290,Stacey,Emiliya was a gracious host to my two out of town guests. They felt at home and loved her morning coffee service. The room was quaint and the location perfect for ease of getting around Ballard.
5671843,31241355,2015-05-03,31609323,Jessica,"A sweet little spot within easy walking distance from downtown Ballard.  Emiliya was welcoming and kind, and the accommodations were homey and comfortable.  "
5671843,32589016,2015-05-19,21708688,Celine,"Really nice place to stay especially if you appreciate tasteful paintings. Great location if you like Ballard, have a car (easy and free street parking) or don't mind taking the bus to go downtown - which runs all the time. Great experience overall"
5671843,32867476,2015-05-22,20650899,Dianna,Emiliya was so very accommodating to my sister and I. We just needed a quick place to stay for the night on our way out to the Cascades and Emiliya could not have been sweeter about our very* late arrival and super early start. Day break french press coffee and fruit!! 
5671843,33381570,2015-05-27,31724247,Frank,It was fantastic and you were a great host. I appreciate you being communicative and all the goodies you left out were very considerate. I can't recommend you more highly. 5 stars. 
5671843,36273924,2015-06-27,27752298,Danchen,"I was in this cute city for the summer internship at Amazon. With completely zero knowledge of this city, I came in around 10 P.M at night. You got your own room with private bathroom. Everything is just there and I actually like how she put the bed in the corner with windows right next to it. Just image woke up in the charming-May-morning-of-Seattle, the first thing you would ever feel is the gentle breeze! Emiliya is a super friendly and easy-going lady. She helped me with everything I need and explain to me with great patience. I loved this place, right off the intersection of 15th and NW 60th street. I kinda enjoy walk for eight minutes to Leary and hop on a bus #40. I moved out to U district after my lease ends. Will absolutely miss this place! So if you are a future Amazonian or your company is located in the south lake union area, I would definitely recommend this place!"
5671843,36777296,2015-07-01,30127068,Stefanie,Emiliya was a thoughtful host.  It was hot during our trip and she left us water bottles to use while we were out.  The space was as listed and perfect for two.  An added bonus is that her artwork is truly beautiful!  I would recommend this listing for sure.  
5671843,37302214,2015-07-06,664901,Charlene,"Emiliya was a wonderful host! She was extremely flexible, allowing me to pick up the key and drop off my luggage for an early check in when I arrived in the city in the morning. Her place is on a quiet street, which I prefer, and bus stops and Market Street were still very accessible. Emiliya also offered to make coffee and breakfast in the morning. My sister and I had a lovely stay in Emiliya's home and would definitely stay with her again in the future."
5671843,39379719,2015-07-23,196121,Ken,"Emiliya's place was very convenient for me to visit family and to visit the Ballard and Freemont areas and to take the bus to downtown Seattle. Very close to bus stops, the Ballard Market and coffee shop, downtown Ballard, and the Sunday Ballard vegetable market. The perfect place to stay while visiting Seattle! "
5671843,39851724,2015-07-26,38700206,Diany,"This was our first airbnb experience and it was great! The room was very comfortable and the location was amazing. Our host was great at checking with us through text messages and make us feel welcome. We barely saw her because we came in late at night and left early in the morning, but she was very sweet and we will definitely recommend her :) "

The location is wonderful. It's a short walk to many of Ballard's fun shops & restaurants, and public transportation is nearby. 

I had a great stay, and hope to return again!

5671843,41769957,2015-08-09,35098609,Norman,"This was my first experience with AirBNB and I was not disappointed at all. Room was nice and cozy. Had a lot of well done paintings which created a nice atmosphere. Emiliya was a very nice host who was always making sure I was comfortable. Overall a great experience.

5671843,43243854,2015-08-18,35176606,David,"Hey Emiliya,  Thank you for being my first Airbnb host.  Your place was perfect for my needs.  I was able to be located near the venue where my niece was getting married, and also near enough to where the rest of my siblings were staying.  I loved the room, the art on the walls, the fan in the window cooling the room, the private bathroom.
You were a friendly and welcoming host, and making your home available to me was considerate and special, though I didn't really take advantage of the kitchen area.  I hope you liked the tomatoes from my garden.  If I was to come back again, I would definitely call you up and be your guest again.          Dave Berens"
5671843,43414288,2015-08-19,39974198,Phil,"Beautiful art, a nice clean bedroom with a well stocked bathroom met all our needs for the stay.  In the morning a great cup of coffee was a good way to start our last day in Seattle.  We came in late and left early since we were cramming our time with activities, so not much time to interact with Emiliya.  Her place is waling distance to many good places to eat.  Try Morsel for breakfast on 15th and 60th."
5671843,43651611,2015-08-21,38752030,Marilyn,Emiliya was a very welcoming hostess & very responsive to any questions that I had. I stayed with her for a few days on a solo trip to the PNW & felt very safe. This was also my first time using airbnb. It was super easy to take the bus downtown & to walk to all of the restaurants/shops in Ballard. I would highly recommended staying here.
5671843,44325079,2015-08-25,5058046,Alayna,"We had a wonderful stay with Emiliya. We arrived after spending six hot days in Portland (which we loved). We were happy to see that we had our own private room and bathroom attached. The bathroom is fully stocked and the room includes a big closet to hang clothes as well as hide away your luggage. There is also a fan in the window, which made for relaxing, cool nights and evenings. This is a shared space so the rest of the home includes Emiliya's things including tons of beautiful paintings so please be respectful. 

Emiliya is a fantastic host. She was quite busy painting, but still made time to chat with us and make us feel at home. She made coffee for me that was super yummy. We were allowed to use her kitchen and things to make breakfast and even decided to cook dinner one night after many days and nights eating out. Because of our lengthy travel she was even kind enough to let us do a load of laundry. 

In terms of the location, Ballard is a bit of a haul from the downtown area. HOWEVER, exploring Ballard and the marina was one of my favorite parts of our stay. There are so many great restaurants, cafes, and shops in Ballard. You have to check out Golden Gardens!!!!! We ended up using car2go to get around the city a lot. Fremont, Green Lake, Capitol Hill, etc. It was all very beautiful. I really fell in love with Seattle and have Emiliya to thank for a relaxing home base for all of our explorations. "
5671843,44804833,2015-08-29,12780762,Natasha,"The Ballard Artcove was a recommended listing at the bottom of the screen.  I usually choose ""entire place"" listings however this seemed truly private (located on the top floor of a condo).  Pictures were okay and previous reviews were complimentary.

A week or so before arrival I messaged Emiliya to inquire about public transportation from the airport to her home since we were not planning to rent a car.  She did not know the immediate answer and I was able to figure it.  She did eventually message me with a helpful website.  A day or so beforehand I messaged her to clarify check in time.  Contradictory information was listed and I wanted to make sure it would be okay to check in at 1 pm after our long travel time.  Emiliya messaged that it would be fine, the room would be ready and told me how to get the key.

Room was located easily, smaller than I expected, but seemed satisfactory at first glance.  We were exhausted. Unfortunately when I pulled back the bedspread, I noticed a large reddish brown stain.  This led me to take a closer look at the sheets.  Upon doing so I discovered multiple places where a dried mucus like substance was visible and some had crusted onto the sheet.  I stripped the bed down to the white mattress cover and decided to wash the linens.  This seemed like a quick and easy solution.  There happened to be a 2nd set of sheets in the wash that fit the bed we had reserved.  I texted Emiliya to let her know that we had found the room easily and that I had switched the sheets due to the condition of the set on the bed.  This led to a number or texts from Emiliya filled with exclamation marks and language that began to attack my character.  

Keep in mind, I have never met this woman in person & now found myself in what seemed to quickly be becoming a confrontational situation.  This put me under a tremendous amount of stress and we began to notice other things in the room and bath that didn't seem to have been cleaned.  Discomfort doesn't begin to cover the emotions I was feeling.  

This trip had been in the works for over 2 years.  Very limited funds meant our budget was well thought out.  We planned all of our exploration and sightseeing around the areas we chose for housing, intending to walk or take inexpensive public transportation. As a result, our housing and transportation expenses more than quadrupled.  What was supposed to be a relaxing start to our vacation was unsettling, unnerving, and filled with anxiety because of a set of unclean sheets that I was happy to wash.  

I am very uncomfortable recommending this listing.  After my initial request to Emiliya for a full refund, she issued a partial amount.  I declined and made a 2nd request through Airbnb resolution portal and was issued a full refund."
5671843,45267102,2015-09-01,2677102,Abraham,We have nothing but kind words for Emiliya. She is beyond hospitable as a host and we loved interacting with her. My daughter can't stop talking about Emiliya and how great she was. The room and arrangements were perfect and the area was close enough to downtown Ballard and away enough from the busy Seattle city life. I can't recommend this enough.
5671843,46146990,2015-09-08,21603997,John,"Excellent! A lovely room in a lovely house well located in a great neighbourhood, it was exactly what we need. "
5671843,50171086,2015-10-10,11879117,Ben,Emiliya was an excellent host! MY girlfriend and I stayed with her for a month while we searched for a permanent place and jobs in Seattle. She was very accommodating and made us feel very welcome and at home. Her home is lovely and filled with her beautiful paintings. She gave us free use of the kitchen and offered us storage space for our things beyond the room we rented. The apartment is in a very good location with many great local restaurants within walking distance. The bus stop is a 2 minute walk away and its about 30 minutes to downtown by bus. All in all Staying with Emiliya was an excellent experience. We couldnt have asked for a kinder person to stay with while establishing ourselves in a new city.
5671843,50861969,2015-10-15,24177658,Michael,"Excellent room, lovely host, great location. Quiet, clean, comfortable."
5671843,52075548,2015-10-26,2682714,Jack,"I needed a room near my daughter's house in Ballard and Emiliya's home fit the bill. I had a little bit of trouble with the lock box, but that was my fault and not hers. The room on the third floor was perfect in all ways, very clean and comfortable. Everything was as it was described on the listing. One small issue was that the water in the bathtub drained quite slowly; but that will be easily fixed. The neighborhood was ideal for me. I look forward to my next stay with Emiliya. She is a wonderful host."
5671843,55347927,2015-12-01,39856841,Faizan,"Emiliya was a wonderful host. She checked in a couple of times to ensure that everything was in order before we moved in. She was very prompt in responding to questions as well. The neighborhood was very enjoyable as well!!

It was a very comfortable experience!!"
6228959,32872325,2015-05-22,13506892,Chad,"PJ was extremely gracious host. He was waiting for us until we reached. A little nervous, since he was renting first time, however, made sure we have everything available. The apartment was small and parking could be found around the corner. Recommended!"
6228959,32946225,2015-05-23,8821411,Danny,Very accommodating host! Comfortable space close to pioneer square and the waterfront. Would definitely stay there again. 
6228959,33045696,2015-05-24,27050071,Emmanuelle,"At first time, Pj was nice and answer quickly to our messages - The appartement was clean and in keeping with the description on Airbnb. 
But, sadly, two days before we come to Seattle, he stopped to answer to mails (As we come from France, we didn't have phone but precised it in mails) after giving imprecise instructions to get the keys ... So we were three students lost in Seattle at 10:30 PM ... Finally after 2 hours we obtaint it by one of his friends but it was stressful ... And our host didn't contact us after our departure knowing the difficulties we meet ...
Consequently, even if think it was sadly a combinaison of factors, I hesitate to recommend it for foreign people ... 

Ps : Sorry for spelling mistakes ..."
6228959,33730068,2015-05-31,33755859,Sarah,"Great little place in a secure apartment complex downtown. Walking distance to the stadiums and plenty of food/drink. Place was clean, easy to find, and exactly as described. Thanks for a great weekend in Seattle!"
6228959,34156969,2015-06-05,5268929,Angelina,"Pj was very friendly and helpful. Everything was very uncomplicated and the flat was exactly as described. We had a nice stay for 2 nights, whereas we were especially happy with the location."
6228959,34338579,2015-06-07,12988581,Anita,This space was in a great location. Walkable to all of downtown Seattle.  Pj was helpful and made the key process very simple.
6228959,34601847,2015-06-09,35033456,Bruce,"While PJ was not able to make it back in town due to travel issues, we were able to coordinate via text and e-mail to get me into the room.  The room had the amenities that were described, but I think it was not fully prepared due to PJ's issues getting back into town.  Specifically, there were wet towels scrunched up in the bathroom and while I found eggs in the frig, that was the only breakfast option available (no breakfast beverages).  The bedding and extra sleeping arrangements were in the room, and there were clean towels provided to us with the bedding.  I did not get a good idea of the neighborhood; I got in late and left early.  "
6228959,34988855,2015-06-14,33785495,Richard,"Pj's place was the perfect location for me to explore Seattle for a few days. The apartment is .3 miles from a Seattle Light Rail Station which allowed me to easily get back to the airport for $3 instead of a $50 cab ride. I walked to everything I wanted to see and didn't have any need for a car. Super convenient. 

Key exchange was easy and Pj was easy to contact and replied in a friendly and timely manner. 

The apartment isn't fancy but that isn't what I was looking for. I'd stay there again. Thanks, Pj!
"
6228959,35056396,2015-06-14,32283115,Becky,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6228959,35400186,2015-06-18,4271862,Eugene,"The location worked great for us- only 5-6 blocks from Pioneer Sq. light rail station; 5 blocks from King Street Train Station; 1 block from Japan Town and easy ride to Pike Place Market. Nice apartment. There was renovation going on in the building, meaning construction noise after 8am on weekdays. PJ was a very nice host and let us extend our checkout time until 5pm. "
6228959,35579863,2015-06-20,33938985,Jordan,"PJ was a good and responsive host. My friends and I loved this spot. With the blow-up mattress it was just big enough for the three of us and had good amenities. Great location close to most everything (especially with some help from Uber). Thanks, Jacek!"
6228959,36555204,2015-06-29,24223646,Barbara,Pj was most welcoming.  He is an enthusiastic young man.  Pj offered to meet me at AMTRAK and walk me to the apartment.  I should have taken him up on this offer since there is a hill.
6228959,37060489,2015-07-04,33575323,Jaime,"Our experience was good.  The apartment was central to everything we wanted to do.   PJ was a good host and the apartment was everything you see in the pictures.

Thank you PJ"
6228959,39498241,2015-07-24,17032768,Jayant,"Location is very good at the edge of international district - host was very responsive and good to work with

Apartment is small and functional - met our needs well"
6228959,39761092,2015-07-26,17032768,Jayant,"Great location - very accommodating host -
 Average apartment"
6228959,42911558,2015-08-16,34235643,Sean,"Great apartment, in a really good location. Definitely a good experience."
6228959,45933261,2015-09-07,30872950,Michael,I had a wonderful time in Seattle.  PJ was a great host! The apartment is a little smaller than I thought but it is plenty of space for one person. It is in an area close to all the sights in Seattle. The laundry is on the same floor and cost $1.50 per wash/dry.  
6228959,48806163,2015-09-28,44313498,Ryan,"Very nice apartment in a nice, central location.  The apartment was is good shape and appeared just like the photos.  Fast/reliable Internet as well.  CenturyLink Field, downtown Seattle and Belltown were all just a short walk away.  Enjoyed the stay and would recommend.

I didn't get a chance to meet PJ but we easily arranged a nearby cafe for me to pick up the key a few hours before the stated check-in time, which was greatly appreciated as my flight got in early and I was stuck with my luggage until I was able to drop it off at the apartment."
6228959,49840797,2015-10-06,14251899,Justin,"Great location, easy to walk everywhere! PJ was quick to respond and very helpful. Pics are accurate "
6228959,50413425,2015-10-11,13545812,Anthony,"Pretty easy to pick up keys at a cafe near the train station. The price and location were decent, short walk to the train station and the waterfront. However, there weren't really any bars or restaurants nearby. You either have to walk a good distance or take an uber. Great location if you have a car with paid parking across the street.When windows are open easy to hear the neighbors."
6228959,51982559,2015-10-25,30867522,Ara,"Apartment was not clean when we arrived, smelled like old clothes. Very difficult to find the air mattress. Towels and sheets smelled unclean and overall did NOT look like the pictures on the site. The only upside was the close proximity to the shops/stores in downtown Seattle. Would not recommend this place to friends."
6228959,58243150,2016-01-01,35910550,Suzanne,"Great place in a great location. Exactly as pictured, and very comfortable. "
5328449,28739482,2015-03-29,12005389,Theresa,"Amy and Sean are amazing hosts and the space is wonderful:  we were working on writing projects and found the space to be a great work space as well as a home-away-from-home base for excursions throughout the city.  We were in for several days, and constantly discovering creative touches around the apartment (when you find a Lynda Barry book on the shelf, you know you are in a good place).

We came in on late flights, and were warmly greeted by Amy who had saved a parking space for us, cheerfully showed us around the space and made sure that we were settled in -- fresh flowers throughout the rooms and fresh fruit in the well-appointed kitchen, along with coffee and tea to get us going for an early meeting the following day.

The dining room table invites you to have long conversations over a glass of wine or a meal, and the view is indeed amazing from either of the two balconies.  The neighborhood has a lot going on for those looking for good food and/or nightlife, but the apartment itself is very peaceful.

Now looking actively for reasons to return to Seattle!
"
5328449,29218883,2015-04-05,14119608,Edward,"One of the best air bnbs I have stayed in. Great apartment, great location and Amy was a great host. They even moved their car so we'd have free parking. Highly recommended. "
5328449,29768489,2015-04-12,8035891,Mick,"Amy was very communicative about how to get to the place. Place was clean and tidy and I liked the separation of the sleeping spaces, upstairs and down. Felt like a 2 bedroom. Nice kitchen with everything you could need, including a  coffee grinder! Plenty of maps and local guides which were very helpful. I would stay there again"
5328449,32132490,2015-05-14,27079331,Ian,"The apartment is very well located, right near the heart of Capitol Hill. It is a really nice place to have if you plan to gather many people for an afternoon or an evening. 

The hosts are very nice, friendly and accommodating. They were super helpful about providing me with a space to park while I stayed there. 

The bedroom could use thicker curtains, and the bathroom is in the tiny side. But other than these details the place is warm, inviting and charming. Well worth staying at. "
5328449,32365941,2015-05-17,31361216,Andy,"Beautiful flat, uniquely decorated and fantastic views. Perfect place for someone wanting to stay a week or more. Wish we could have stayed longer! Really useful info pack and given privacy during our short stay."
5328449,32719755,2015-05-20,7633963,Hannah,"The apartment was fantastic and Amy and Sean left us with a great list of suggestions. The apartment is in a great location, has stunning views and left like a second home. We definitely recommend"
5328449,32923464,2015-05-23,14457175,Manh,"Awesome accomodation! Everything were so perfect, especially the view towards downtown from the dining table and the spacious spacial configuration of the apartment."
5328449,33121879,2015-05-25,26331223,Lacey,"Amy and Sean are exceptional hosts. We were greeted upon arrival and received a welcome packet which made us immediately feel at home. The space is clean, quiet, has breathtaking views overlooking Seattle and was all in all perfect for our needs. Close proximity to public transportation made getting around town without a car easy, too! Close to local restaurants, bars and many top attractions in the city also makes this space desirable when visiting Seattle.

I'll definitely look Amy & Sean up again for future airbnb needs in the Seattle area!"
5328449,33394967,2015-05-27,30242575,Mathieu,"A very nice stay with Amy and Sean.
Fantastic location with very helpful advice from my hosts (places to eat, grocery stores nearby, ...) and what a view.

Thank you for helping me with parking options, made the stay even more pleasant."
5328449,33703542,2015-05-31,1382544,Stepan,"This unique and lovely apartment more than lived up to its photos and rave reviews. The two balconies with great views really make this place extraordinary. Quirky artistic decor including a blue typewriter (love it!) and lots of artistic personal touches. The apartment is thoughtfully stocked with basic necessities and sightseeing resources. Perfect location on the edge of Capitol Hill, with excellent eateries and night spots all around (including Skillet Diner, Marjorie bistro and Restaurant Zoe across the street and Bar Sue around the corner) but not much noise from the street.  15 minute walk to Downtown and another 10 to Pike Place Market. 15 minute walk to Volunteer Park. Highly recommended. "
5328449,34150047,2015-06-05,33432902,Shen,Very nice place to stay. It's location is very close to downtown but still very quite.
5328449,34327333,2015-06-07,4919961,Amanda,"Apt was perfect! great location, clean and spectacular view. Amy & Sean were very helpful and great hosts :) "
5328449,34968088,2015-06-14,12457387,Paulina,My parents stayed in Amy and Spanish apartment for 6 days while visiting us. The place is mostly as advertised. The view from the top floor is spectacular. Amy and Sean are responsive and friendly. The bed is comfortable. Unfortunately the apartment is a bit rundown. And if you're a clean freak it's probably not for you. But so close to the Capitol Hill action and with a great view at this price...
5328449,35264880,2015-06-16,12950375,Sinead,"Great communication with Amy from the start. The apartment has lots of character & is in a good location in a fun neighbourhood with plenty of restaurants etc nearby. We walked everywhere, no need for a car. We were made to feel very welcome & comfortable for the duration of our stay. Would definitely recommend. "
5328449,36016090,2015-06-24,78286,Gina,"Amy and Sean's apartment was a great home away from home.  The location was perfect for exploring Seattle without a car, in a great neighborhood and very close to bus lines.  The kitchen had all the necessities -- coffee, tea, olive oil -- and laundry soap by the washing machine was much (website hidden) books, games and whimsical art all contributed to a welcoming atmosphere.  Amy was very responsive to questions and Sean was over-the-top helpful when I had a work emergency and asked to use his personal computer, scanner and fax machine."
5328449,36983570,2015-07-03,35523983,Kristen,"Beautiful apartment in cool neighborhood with outstanding views. The place worked well for our family of four with all the necessities present. Amy and Sean were accommodating, particularly with parking, and quick to respond. I appreciated the guidebooks and detailed feedback for accessing the Roku, laundry, places to eat and transportation. I felt like staying in the neighborhood gave our family a bit more of an authentic Seattle experience as opposed to a hotel room. We enjoyed our stay and fell in love with Seattle!"
5328449,37174036,2015-07-05,33488006,Koharu,"My family, friends and I really enjoyed our stay here. It was very quiet, cozy and clean with a great view from the balcony. They provided coffee and tea as well as an AC unit, which is very nice to have if you're traveling to Seattle in the summer. Even though we didn't get to meet Amy and Sean in person, they were still very accommodating and easy to communicate with via email. It was also helpful that everything we needed to know about the apartment was included in a folder upon our arrival. This is really a great spot and I would love to stay here again! "
5328449,41339470,2015-08-07,1583297,Jenny,Completely enjoyed my stay!! The apartment was perfect and I loved having a glass of wine on the deck watching the sunset. Location was great and accessible to so much. Thank you for a wonderful time!
5328449,41959050,2015-08-10,4456293,Joseph,"Our experience with the hosts was fantastic. Communication from the hosts was quick and clear. The place was clean and well-organized, with a terrific view of the Seattle skyline from the balcony. It was close to some of the great restaurants. Bus no 2 going downtown was conveniently located outside. I would highly recommend this place without reservation. "
5328449,42211501,2015-08-11,7170205,Nubia,"Amy and Sean were great hosts, although I did not meet with them in person, they provided clear instructions. The place was exactly as the photographs, located across the street from great food and in the heart of lively Capitol Hill. Thank you Amy and Sean! "
5328449,42529631,2015-08-14,2007060,Jesse,"Cute and cozy place, and Amy and Sean keep the place very neat and clean. Extremely well furnished. The place is centrally located and Amy and Sean provide great information and recommendations about the surrounding area and Seattle in general. Just note that the bathroom is kind of cramped, but doable. "
5328449,42757536,2015-08-15,27413999,Jonah,Fantastic place in an even better location! Our first time in Seattle and there's just no better neighborhood to explore. Communication with Amy and Sean was great and they're super accommodating. 5+!
5328449,43763363,2015-08-22,16772459,Sarah,"The view from Amy and Sean's light-filled top floor and two balconies is amazing.  The apartment is comfortable, airy, private, and thoughtfully decorated.  The location is great: convenient to public transportation and in a dynamic and interesting neighborhood.  We did not meet Amy and Sean, but they were very responsive by email."
5328449,44207065,2015-08-24,10554540,Scott,"Amy was a great host!  She was a great communicator throughout the entire process and really made us feel at home.  She was beyond accommodating as we had a bit of a surprise early arrival.  Also, although the house doesn't actually have a parking space advertised, they were able to arrange a space to help parking our car.  This was extremely helpful given that parking in Seattle is challenging.

The neighborhood is also great with a lot of restaurants and bars around.  

Overall, we loved the apartment.  The space is huge and clean. The view from the balcony is amazing and the bed is extremely comfortable.  The apartment was great for what we needed.

A few things to consider when booking.  The bathroom is pretty small and if you are taller than 6'2"", the shower would be a bit challenging to navigate.  It's not a huge issue, but just something to be aware of.  

Overall, we had a great stay.  Thanks!!"
5328449,44398676,2015-08-25,1692445,Edward,"The host provides a simple and concise welcome manual. When it comes to these, I prefer short and sweet. The manual even includes a mnemonic which is helpful for navigating the streets of Seattle. 

The description of the place is spot on. Spectacular is definitely a good word to describe the view. My girlfriend spent most of our time imagining how it would be to reside in this apartment. We almost didn't want to leave but the surrounding neighborhood begs you to venture out. "
5328449,44593224,2015-08-27,4693973,Ann,"Amy and Sean's place was the perfect spot for exploring the area. We stayed two nights and each night enjoyed the spectacular view of the space needle! The apartment had everything we needed and Amy and Sean were super nice. We would definitely stay here again. 

"
5328449,44894922,2015-08-30,11563926,Rachel,"The apartment was very clean and homey, with just as great views as described! The location is also conveniently located close enough to the action so you can get out and do things if you desire, but far enough to enjoy a quiet night in if that's what you prefer. Amy was also a very helpful and accommodating host who was flexible with our flight schedules. For these things, I am very grateful and had a great time!  

The only downside to our stay here would be the bathroom conditions. It was difficult to get the temperature of the shower to remain consistent, especially when you are in an extreme rush in the morning. I imagine if we stayed there for longer we would've gotten the hang of it, but for our short stay, our showers were pretty bipolar :(. And as others (and the description itself) have mentioned, it is a rather small space. That would be my only hesitation in returning again. Otherwise, I appreciated the hospitality and the coziness of the place!"
5328449,45358138,2015-09-01,14505858,Ryan,"Extremely nice and professional hosts. Everything was clean and cozy. Check-in was beyond easy and the location was perfect for walking to restaurants, bars, and coffee. They have every question you might have about the home and the location answered in their guide book. Great experience."
5328449,45593223,2015-09-04,143459,Emily,"Amy and Sean were great hosts - very communicative and helpful in arranging our one night stay. Their space is well located, lots of great shops and restaurants within walking distance. It was perfect for me and my husband. Amy and Sean also were kind enough to mail us something we accidentally left behind. Thanks!!"
5328449,45980754,2015-09-07,1363429,Nathan,"What a lovely apartment.  The apartment is centrally located to lots of wonderful bars and restaurants.  Amy and Sean provide all of the essentials.  The only downside of the place is the bathroom.  It is exceptionally small; large individuals will not be able to rent this place due to the shower.

We never met Amy and Sean.  There is lots of privacy.  I would definitely stay in this home again."
5328449,47759801,2015-09-21,4518144,Paul,"We loved our stay in this amazing apartment in Capitol Hill. The balcony and view of downtown was great! And the location doesn't get any better. The apartment has lots of space and all necessities. Amy was very accommodating, letting us check in early and check out late. A great experience all around!"
5328449,48502095,2015-09-27,34699382,Gary,"We had a great week at Amy and Sean's place.  I can tell you that there was not a problem all week.  We did have a couple requests and Amy was very quick to take care of what we needed.  

As for the space itself, it was comfortable and just as pictured.  Great view of the city skyline, especially at night."
5328449,50053733,2015-10-08,15446336,Justin,"Amy was great to deal with - kind, prompt to respond, and very welcoming.  The apartment is in a great location, near many great restaurants and bars.  And, as mentioned, the views really are great from the living / dining area.  The only word of caution would be for someone who struggles with stairs -- the bedroom is separated from the living / dining / bathroom by a fairly steep flight of stairs.  All in all, though, a fantastic space and really top-notch hosts."
5328449,50331699,2015-10-11,3046976,Greg,"Perfect location! Sean and Amy are wonderful hosts. Great communication, very kind and generous! Loved the views and all the natural light in the apartment. It had a very European feel to it. "
5328449,51206958,2015-10-18,45919024,Bart,"A few years ago I lived directly across the street from this, and I enjoyed the view and the neighborhood immensely. I wondered about this place, and this trip I was thrilled to stay there a few nights.

If you want to experience the bustle of Pike/Pine and Capitol Hill while retreating to enjoy great views of the city and the mountains, this is the place."
5328449,52138535,2015-10-26,17718859,Anna,Amy and Sean were fantastic hosts and the house was really beautiful and homely. Capitol Hill is a great area to visit - definitely recommend!! :)

The neighborhood seemed very safe and walkable. I would definitely stay here again. Rah-Miel is very responsive and attentive,a great host!"
7075913,43107826,2015-08-17,16439759,Katrina,The place was in a perfect location. Lots to do and see. Traffic was nuts though on game night for the Seahawks. It was a tidy place with everything you need for two. 
7075913,43858192,2015-08-22,24935652,Robert,Communication with Rah-Miel was excellent. Every question I had was answered in a timely fashion. The location was excellent s well. I was able to walk/jog to Pikes Market and downtown easily. Plenty of restaurants and a vibrant night life within a couple of blocks. Toulouse Petit is a must visit. The food was incredible. The condo was clean and new. Wi-Fi was also available. I would definitely stay here again.  
7075913,44166090,2015-08-24,10587579,Shane,Rah-Miel made check-in a breeze and the apartment is centrally located around various tourists destinations as well as great restaurants.  I would highly recommend this apartment to friends traveling to Seattle.
7075913,46901564,2015-09-14,6564094,Haluna,"Beautiful and new unit in a prime location within walking distance of the Space Needle and Chihuly garden.  Rah-Miel was very attentive and the check-in/out process was super easy.  
Parking tip: street parking is typically available.  Just look up the Key Arena schedule and try to park before or after major events because it will get more crowded around the apartment."

The apartment was very clean and in a great location. Close enough to all the fun sights but not right in the middle so it was quiet when needed.

The property was clean and was actually nicer than the pictures showed.  All of the amenities listed were there and the wifi was excellent.

Everything was clean and ready when we got there and Rah-Miel was extremely helpful in making sure we were all settled and taken care of. First time visiting Seattle and having an awesome spot to crash it made it even better!
7075913,55384442,2015-12-01,45011649,Dan,"Rah-Miel's home was fantastic and its location couldn't have been better. A stones throw from the Space Needle and a short walk to Pike Place Market, you really are in the center of everything. 

Check-in was a breeze and the apartment was very neat and clean. It was exactly what I expected from the description provided. Communication leading up to the visit was also very good and I didn't have any questions when I arrived.

I really appreciated the hospitality and my stay in Seattle was great as a direct result of Rah-Miel's home.

7075913,55789484,2015-12-06,34226938,Jenny,We were in Seattle for a short getaway. We aren't tourists as we live only 30 miles south but it's nice to spend time in the big city. Rah-Miel from the start was awesome- made sure I had all the info I needed and he was super friendly. His apartment is in the BEST location. We walked everywhere. Parking was a breeze. There were no events at Key Arena so that made it nice. There's a little oyster bar on Republic a block away called Taylor Shellfish that was amazing... There's also a great craft beer place called The Masonry nearby. The apartment itself was spotless and perfect. Had everything we needed. Thanks so much! 
7075913,56483517,2015-12-14,36162114,Joseph,Check in was easy and the location is great. Near some great restaurants. Thanks for a great stay!

Very close to the downtown, the buses, cheap ubers from here to all the touristy areas. Rahmiel was very communicative with everything. Would definitely recommend this place to a friend!"
5304739,27451016,2015-03-04,8775960,Steven,This was my first experience with AirBnB and Joe and Shannon made it very easy! I requested the property after midnight the day before I needed it and by 6:30am Joe had confirmed and sent me the details. It is a great basement suite with keyless entry which makes it really convenient. It was spotlessly clean and towels and toiletries were provided along with fast wifi. There was also free street parking right outside which really helped. Joe and Shannon were very helpful hosts and very quick to respond to messages through AirBnB site. Highly recommended and I would stay again if in the area!
5304739,27627700,2015-03-08,28260174,Lisa,"This was our first experience, and a very great one. Joe and Shannon were sweet. They made sure we had everything that we needed. we enjoyed our stay here.

5304739,28179441,2015-03-19,13256067,Nuria,Joe's Apartment ist sehr wohnlich und sauber. Zudem hatte ich noch nie so viel Platz und Privatsphäre. Joe und seine Familie ist wirklich sehr nett und hilfsbereit - ich würde die Wohnung jeder Zeit wieder buchen. 
5304739,28530675,2015-03-25,28662796,Katherine,"Joe and Shannon were the best host in making sure we had everything we need. They have a lovely house and there space for rent is a wonderful space. It's private and has it's own experience. They provided us with some snacks, restaurant suggestions, and provided us with extra towels and linen. Would definitely stay with Joe and Shannon again!"
5304739,28628206,2015-03-27,29007913,Wendy,"Our stay with Joe and Shannon was perfect - we needed a clean, secure, quiet place to sleep for the night, and that's just what we got.  Communication response was immediate, and Joe and Shannon were very welcoming.  The only regret I have was not being able to stay longer!  Thanks so much!"
5304739,28952116,2015-04-01,29006766,Yutthana,"The room is very nice, large area for all relaxing, sitting/clothing like as shown on photos. Host provided us convenience and privacy. Nice neighborhood, which you can see a good view of mountian and lake when driving down the road. Not far from I5, easy to reach city. No issue parking on the street."
5304739,29313795,2015-04-06,28593362,Irel,"Joe and Shannon's house is very lovely, it's located in great, safe and quiet neighborhood. It's only a short drive away from downtown. The basement apartment in very spacious and comfortable. It has everything you may need...including an umbrella! The only issues we had were the bathroom wasn't very clean and on one of the night it was a bit noisy upstairs. When we checked in we noticed the bathroom floor and toilet had hairs from the previous guest. "
5304739,29580933,2015-04-09,25438347,Angela,Joe and Shannon were lovely hosts. Warm and friendly but respectful of space. The space itself was large and comfortable; breathtaking views and only minutes from beautiful Carkeek park. I would definitely recommend.

Joe and Shannon were quick to notify us of any changes like parking, etc. during our stay.
It was nice to wake up, open the windows and see all of the lovely landscaping.  
Thank you!  "
5304739,30997411,2015-04-30,20326481,John,"I cannot say enough good things about Joe and Shannon and their amazing home. From requesting a reservation to check in/checkout and in between they were quick to respond to my questions via the Airbnb app.

Upon arrival at the home we were amazed at the well manicured landscape. The pictures are only a small representation of how nice the home is. Joe answered the front door and directed me to the private side entrance. We had a brief conversation with Joe and he was very welcoming and warm.  He also told us about all of the goodies near and inside the mini fridge.  There is also a hot/cold water cooler located in the room.

The space is open and expansive and equipped with everything that you could ever need or want to use. The bed is comfy as is the air mattress.  With the sliding room dividers you can easily divide the space into two rooms at night for added privacy.  The decor is nice and I especially appreciated the open light due to multiple windows throughout.  The amenities were above and beyond our expectations. This space is truly a bargain for what you get.  There are several bus stops within a 5-10 minute walk for easy access to downtown and other areas in Seattle.

The following day we had the privilege of chatting with both Joe and Shannon and they were warm, cordial, and welcoming. They repeatedly told us that if we needed anything at all to contact them.  

Overall this was an amazing experience and they have set the bar high.  By far one of my favorite Airbnb experiences.  I highly recommend staying here and will seek them out when I am in Seattle on future trips. Thanks Joe and Shannon for a memorable experience. 5/5 Stars all around."
5304739,34282448,2015-06-07,29247889,Beata,"Joe and Shannon were wonderful hosts. They were so friendly, making sure that I had everything I needed.

5304739,34642612,2015-06-10,20274837,Raif,"This was a really good first AirBnB experience! The space was huge and well decorated. The hosts made us feel at home, and everything we could have needed was provided. The description is completely accurate and it wasn't as far from the touristy parts of Seattle as I originally thought."

The location is super perfect to go to downtown an University of Washington. It's just 4-5 exits on the freeway.

I would recommend Joe's home for anyone who would like to have a stay in Seattle."
5304739,35586532,2015-06-20,28376736,Austin,"Extremely nice and gracious hosts. Went above and beyond with the set up (drinks in fridge, extra towels, etc.) The space was clean and we couldn't have asked for more! Thanks! "

5304739,37140517,2015-07-05,29565271,Jiyoung,"It was such a good place to visit and stay, the location was a little far from the Seattle downtown , which takes about 40 minutes by bus, but it made better in order to have some quite and private time with friends! It was such a lovely place to feel like home, I would highly recommend the place to stay if you visit Seattle! And the hosts are super friendly and nice!:) "
5304739,37559685,2015-07-08,31821361,Kevin,"Joe n Shannon have a beautiful home. This private apt with full bath was the perfect and I mean perfect place to stay for us.  It is pristine, spacious and comfy. They kindly had the fridge stocked with beverages, plenty of maps and literature on best places to eat and explore. We couldn't have been happier for our first experience with AirBNB. Thanks Joe n Shannon. Go Sox!!"
5304739,37653636,2015-07-09,19708769,Jason,The house was easy to find and in a great neighborhood. Joe and Shannon were both very nice and accommodating. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again the next time we are in Seattle. 
5304739,38254456,2015-07-14,28233221,Amy,"This was our first AirBnb experience and it went perfectly! Well, except for my son getting food poisoning (before we arrived) and spending our first day in the Seattle Children's Hospital ER, which is fantastic btw!

Joe and Shannon were wonderful hosts and the downstairs apartment that we stayed in was amazing! Just what we needed while my son was recovering. Fortunately he wasn't down for too long and he was still able to attend the Russell Wilson Passing Academy and spend the next day sightseeing. The Uber service that Shannon recommended was great! It's definitely the way to get around up there!

They provide everything that you need, extra blankets, towels, etc. They also generously provided snacks and drinks which we very much appreciated when we arrived at Joe and Shannon's starving (our train was late getting into the station and we didn't have a chance to eat). Bed was very comfortable and the rooms were spacious. The neighborhood was really nice and we felt very safe. I don't think I will ever be able to stay in a hotel room again! My son's first words out of his mouth when we walked in was ""Wow, good call mom. This place is awesome!""

The next time that we come up to Seattle we know where we will be staying! Thank you for everything Joe and Shannon!!"
5304739,38518511,2015-07-16,35302744,Chelsea,Everything was great & we had everything we need. Wish we had longer in Seattle. 
5304739,38709299,2015-07-18,4411752,Mary,"I was pleased that you were out in front when I arrived.  That was comforting as I had had a hard week.  Your place was so spacious,pristine clean and wonderfully decorated.  I appreciated the water and the coffee and snacks that you left out.  It was everything you said and more!  Thank You."
5304739,39605795,2015-07-25,30676942,Stephanie,"My sons and I had an awesome time in Seattle and staying at our first airbnb was perfect!! Joe & Shannon had everything ready and was just as described.  The home is beautiful and stocked with special treats.  Although we didn't get to meet Joe and Shannon, due to them being out of town, the communication was great!! We had the opportunity to meet their son, Wailea, who was our host for the week.  He was super friendly and helped out with finding our way around the area.  Thanks for making our first airbnb such a great experience!! When we're in the area again, we will definitely be booking Joe & Shannon's place!!"
5304739,39920447,2015-07-27,59866,Roxanne,"This was a bumpy stay, but mostly that was our fault. I had the wrong key code to get in. Ouch. On the positive side, Joe and Shannon had allowed us to check in early (to dress for an afternoon wedding). We were so grateful to them for accommodating our needs!
Their place is definitely quite large and clean - in a pretty neighborhood too, with views to the west. This would be a great place for any couple or family to stay. But do realize it is a small distance to downtown Seattle or even to a ""local"" coffeehouse. In exchange, however, you get abundant space, big bathtub, privacy - with snacks thrown in too."
5304739,40102250,2015-07-28,2190482,William,"Joe and Shannon were wonderful hosts. The neighborhood is a very nice safe quiet area in Broadview in Seattle. The space was very clean, nicely appointed, and private. I was very pleased with this mother in law apartment in their home."
5304739,40381945,2015-07-30,32931663,Angela,"Great, easy to access location! Joe and Shannon put all those look-forward-to touches in their listing right down to the after dinner mints and to go coffee in the morning! The space was large, pristine, and relaxing. They had very comfy linens, bedding and everything was crisp and very clean! Though we were on a business trip, we would have read through the 100 Things to do in Seattle Before You Die book and gone on some adventures. There always is next time!"
5304739,40575474,2015-08-01,32066024,Jess,"Shannon and Joe have a great hideaway in North Seattle.  On this trip it was for one night on our way to Vancouver BC.  Our next extended stay in Seattle we will stay with Shannon and Joe.  The room was well stocked with snacks and beverages.  Clean Room,  Great hosts and a comfortable bed made it like being at home.  We will definitely be back.  Jess and Bob"
5304739,41067873,2015-08-04,862177,Fran And Ken,"We had a very comfortable and relaxing stay at Joe and Shannon's airbnb apartment. Very clean, very quiet and very convenient, we had all that we needed for our short stay in Seattle."
5304739,41728896,2015-08-09,16991936,Edla,"The apartment was spacious and clean and well equipped, including drinks in the fridge and snacks. The shower was the best we had during our trip.
We had an entrance code so that arriving late was no problem.
It is outside Seattle in a quiet residential area. We felt very safe there. Getting to the city center took 20 minutes by bus for 2,50$ one way. There were two bus stops within walking distance ( 1/2 mile) and the buses left every half (website hidden)'s a great place to stay for any group or family with four persons."
5304739,41954105,2015-08-10,13825384,Spencer,"Joe and Shannon really made our stay in Seattle fantastic. They are very responsive to messages, the house is beautiful, everything you could possibly need is provided, and the space has easy access to downtown Seattle via car or Uber. Thanks for everything, and we will gladly book your space again when in the area!"
5304739,42136575,2015-08-11,7408702,Henry,The location is near Seattle. The apt condition is great. A bravo apt to stay.
5304739,42426466,2015-08-13,38374216,Steven,We loved everything about our stay !  Wonderful accommodations in a beautiful home & neighborhood.  Everything was as described (even better) and the hosts were fantastic in their communications & in ensuring that our visit was the best.   We found it very convenient to the various activities in downtown Seattle & surrounding areas.  We're looking forward to staying again in the near future.  
5304739,42568988,2015-08-14,5639021,Lauren,"This was an absolutely lovely place! Really nice apartment, very comfortable for 3 people, very clean, and a very nice bathroom. Joe and Shannon made many amenities available, were accommodating about the time of arrival, and were communicative about important details - even though we didn't see too much of them during our brief stay. Absolutely recommend this place!"
5304739,43030077,2015-08-17,11256457,Kirsten,Shannon and Joe were great host. Everything was well prepared when we arrived and they made a early Check in possible. We highly recommend this accommodation. 
5304739,43250502,2015-08-18,36869102,Chengshu,"It was the first time I rented an Airbnb room, and it was a really nice stay at Joe & Shannon's. The room was large and clean, and the neighborhood was quiet. There were one bed and one air bed with electric pump. They put several snacks and drinks for us to take, all free. There were also intriguing table games. "
5304739,43563358,2015-08-20,41092024,Gina,"Shannon and Joe were very accommodating! We came to the room and let ourselves in with the code they gave us. The area was spacious, clean, and had plenty of magazines for sightseeing around Seattle. 

It was very private, we felt like it was our own little apartment. We didn't have any interaction with the hosts beyond texting, but they were very pleasant and easy to communicate with. 

The location was in a quiet neighborhood far enough away from the hustle bustle of the city but not too far that it's a chore to get there. The bus stop is relatively close by and quick trip into the heart of the city. "
5304739,43690725,2015-08-21,39571068,Morgan,Was a great place to stay. They were a really friendly family and the room was clean and well appointed even came with a few free drinks and snacks. The hosts also had printed out Seattle information which was great too. Would recommend. 
5304739,44095765,2015-08-24,29518782,Kevin,"My family came to Seattle for a family wedding and stayed in this light and clean basement apartment. There was a foldaway bed for my husband and I which was quite comfortable and an air mattress for our son. Our daughter used a camping mattress that we had with us.   There were light snacks and drinks in the kitchen area and comfortable couches with a variety of magazines. The bathroom had a great shower head with nice hot water and good pressure. We enjoyed staying here, in our first air bnb experience   "
5304739,44655145,2015-08-28,37718324,Helmut,"we are Helmut, Regina, Maxi and Jonas from Vienna, Austria.
Thanx again for the wonderful stay in your house in Seattle. We can only recommend this accommodation for its convenience and of course for the warm welcome you gave us when we came to your place. The kids were just as happy as we were because your house offers just everything for a great visit of Seattle. We even went whalewatching to Anacortes one day with the ferry from Whidbey so near. You were really great hosts and we hope to see you 
again some time."
5304739,44869837,2015-08-29,2533787,Lori,"Everything is accurate: residential neighborhood, walk to Carkeek Park with nice trails, light and spacious apartment. Thanks for the warm welcome."
5304739,45460943,2015-09-03,31304557,Rosemary,I think Joe and Shannon have spoiled us with our first Airbnb experience!  They were both so welcoming and friendly and really took the effort to make our stay memorable.  The accommodations were spotless and just as described/shown.  Location was great - far enough from downtown to enjoy getting away but close enough to hop on the bus and did not need to use our camper to explore the city.  Highly recommended and hope to stay there again sometime in the future.
5304739,45597138,2015-09-04,3323522,Laurie,"Great neighborhood and the unit is lovely, spacious, bright and super clean. It was well-equipped with nice touches and the bed was really comfy. We didn't realize that the main house is directly above this apartment and you can hear people upstairs walking, talking etc.  Also the two bed areas are separated only by a screen (tho that wasn't a problem for us).  Definitely head over to Carkeet Park -- gorgeous. "
5304739,45931890,2015-09-07,19141526,Lily,"Shannon is sweet and very welcoming. We wanted to check in early and she was very accommodating to our schedule. Her place had everything we needed. It was nice, clean and very comfortable for four of us! We texted throughout our stay and she was very quick in responding as well. Highly recommended - thanks again!"
5304739,46386920,2015-09-10,39286223,Michelle,"We had a great time at Joe and Shannon's. The neighborhood is nice and quiet. It is close to downtown Seattle, but we enjoyed being a bit away to see some other parts of Seattle like beautiful Carkeek park that is minutes away from their home! The room was perfect for us with our young child. Plenty of space and privacy. (Our son LOVED the space.) We would definitely recommend and would stay here again if we come to Seattle. "
5304739,46536636,2015-09-11,3991644,Katherine,"Very clean, comfortable bed, nice friendly dog, gracious host.  Quiet neighborhood. "
5304739,46636556,2015-09-12,19894863,Deborah,very quite neighborhood! The host left us plenty of water and snacks which were so helpful and sweet! The house was really clean too!
5304739,47040106,2015-09-15,34457578,Phyllis,Nice roomy area in safe quiet neighborhood. Easy access to downtown and freeway. Carkeek park is a great place to watch the sunset!
5304739,48064192,2015-09-23,34432168,Elizabeth,"We greatly enjoyed our stay with Joe and Shannon. Their property was in a lovely neighborhood and exactly as shown in their listing. The space was warm and welcoming, complete with snacks, wine, and beer in the mini fridge and reading material on the coffee table. They made themselves readily available for anything we needed, but gave us our space as well. Great airbnb experience. "
5304739,48367556,2015-09-25,44939457,Dale,Cudos to Shannon.  She was a great host.  Made me really feel at home.  Plenty of water tons of snacks and an awesome beautiful black lab that came down to say hello.
5304739,48418010,2015-09-26,34995815,Jane,We enjoyed our stay here. Nice and quite neighborhood and the room is very clean and tidy. Transportation to downtown Seattle is very easy and it's very close to CarkeekPark which offers natural beauty of the area. The host is very quick in responding to my questions. The snacks and the water they prepared for us was a nice surprise. Joe and Shannon also prepared a lot of magazines introducing Seattle and other places you can travel to. Definitely recommend this place. 离市区有一定距离但不太远、开车很方便。很安静的居住区。离Carkeek公园很近可以去走一走。非常干净整洁的半地下室。私密性也不错。和主人没见面但他们回短信非常快 有什么问题非常快就有回复。推荐这个地方。
5304739,48999257,2015-09-30,39340432,Brian,"This was a my first AirBnB experience and it was excellent. My hosts were extremely friendly and made me fill like I was visiting close friends, even though we just meet. The location was perfect for the wedding I was attending, the drive to the events was short. This is one of the reason I pick Joe and Shannon's place. Plus it was convenient to some tourist attraction i wanted to see, like Carkeek Park. The space was great for what we needed. My hosts made sure we had the towels and linens we needed. Everything was clean and nice.  The parking was a good location and no in anyone's way. 
We had space to relax in the private apt. The private entrance and code key made coming and going easy and no worry about locking keys in the house. "
5304739,49214996,2015-10-02,21634166,Loretta,A lovely location of the basement apartment and Shannon was very accommodative to our ad hoc requests.  Thanks.
5304739,49503940,2015-10-04,44124264,Yunyun,very nice and clean. Great experience. Thank you very much. 
5304739,49900648,2015-10-07,22094917,Hyesuk,"Thank you Shannon and Joe!

The place was clean and easily accessible.  They made sure we have everything we needed and assured us to let them know if we need anything.  Loved the park that they recommended ""Carpeek Park!""  Will return again and stay there here!

Thank you!
Sunny and the family"
5304739,50460804,2015-10-12,3349460,Jeff,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Joe & Shannon's basement apartment. It was very clean, comfortable and secure. It's obvious they have put a lot of work into making it a place you want to return to. Most impressive to me is the bathroom, very nice size, extremely clean and great water pressure with a nice shower head. The neighborhood is nice and quiet with on street parking. It was great to spend time in the city and then get away to a ""home"". The keyless entry is great since you don't have to worry about keeping up with keys. The free snacks and drinks were a nice touch and Shannon is very quick and courteous to respond to any questions or other communication regarding booking, etc. 
I would definitely recommend this place for anyone taking a trip to Seattle."
5304739,51320079,2015-10-19,44393658,Hardeep,This was our first Airbnb experience and we absolutely loved it. Very comfortable homely accommodation with everything you need and more. Neighborhood was very quite. Joe and Shannon left plenty of drinks and snacks. It was very clean. Left recommendations and brochures for us which came in handy. The keyless entry made everything easy. Close to downtown. Will definitely return if we come to Seattle again.
5304739,51458856,2015-10-20,35245840,Bryn,"We loved the location, the accommodations and amenities (the shower pressure/head was amazing) with Shannon and Joe.  We stayed a total of 2 nights - our first night was at the beginning of our trip and then the second night was the last night of our trip.
I loved the set up of the rooms.  Shannon has great taste with the bedspreads and pillows.
She was always quick to respond when I had any questions!   We really appreciated her tip about using Uber when going into Seattle (saved us a lot of money from parking)."
5304739,52319358,2015-10-28,11879854,Eoin,We had a very pleasant week in Joe & Shannon's house. They are very receptive and helped us out for each detail immediately. We could not have asked for better hosts. They also provided a great restaurant guide!
5304739,52561239,2015-10-30,47511513,Denver,Really enjoyed the place. Shannon was very nice and even had champagne for us because we were on our honeymoon.
5304739,52980099,2015-11-03,45032602,Andrew,"The apartment was very warm and inviting.  Shannon was very responsive during the booking process and during our stay.  She even provided some crayons and craft paper for our little girl and invited us to visit during a small Halloween gathering :)

Access was very convenient and we enjoyed the privacy of the keyless entry.  The apartment is in the basement, and even normal activity upstairs was a bit disturbing.  However, Shannon's family was very accommodating when we mentioned the noise was too much.  I should also note that we are east coasters on an earlier schedule and had a young toddler, so we might have been more sensitive to the noise than the average person.  Overall, we were very pleased with the comfortable space and Shannon's hospitality made these first-time Airbnbers believers."
5304739,53302785,2015-11-07,31800813,Kenique,"Joe & Shannon were very nice and welcoming,  they have a very gorgeous home. As soon as we got there they both were outside to greet us. When we walked inside we felt right at home the apartment was warm and cozy and very clean. They also had a list of recommendations for us to go to which I thought was very thoughtful of them. (Our favorite was Carkeek park) "
5304739,53554846,2015-11-09,25825123,Janica,"What a beautiful neighborhood to spend the weekend at in Seattle.  The lower level of the house was a nice retreat, and while located outside of downtown, the City was only a 15 minute drive away.  The accommodations were thoughtful, clean and well kept. I didn't get a chance to meet Joe and Shannon, but we connected and communicated very well via text and email. "
5304739,53864680,2015-11-13,25227306,Maria,"The stay was so confortable. Joe & Shannon very attentive. 
The house very clean and equip! thank you very much family!
"
5304739,54418591,2015-11-19,47336272,Giles,"Joe and Shannon's accommodation was excellent value and we had everything we needed in the room and more. The basement apartment is really spacious and it was more than enough for the two of us; it felt like we had our own little home. They provided far more than was expected, including a kettle with lots of tea bags to choose from, plastic plates, bowls and cutlery as well as some snacks which were great after a long day. The access to the room from the outside is perfect for anyone who likes their privacy. We only saw Shannon briefly as we arrived but she was very friendly and accommodating. The keypad lock on the door prevents any worries about losing your key. The neighborhood was beautiful and we felt very safe. It was only about 30 minutes from downtown Seattle by car. Nearby Carkeek park is definitely worth visiting. It really feels like a slice of wilderness and on a clear day the Olympic Mountains can be seen across the water. We'd recommend staying more than one night if you can to fully enjoy the apartment!"
5304739,54461616,2015-11-20,38769068,Donata,Thank you for this short stay! It was great to have such a quiet place to sleep. Joe and Shannon were lovely hosts and kept the place organized and clean. It was a pleasure to stay there! Thank you!
5304739,54558128,2015-11-21,49211240,Jacques,"This was my first Airbnb experience and everything went smooth.  Comfortable accommodation with everything you need and more.   Facilities were very clean. Facilities were exactly as advertized. The keyless entry made everything easy. The space was welcoming, complete with snacks, soda pop and adult beverage in the mini fridge and reading material on the coffee table. Upon arrival, Joe, the host, greeted me and gave me a complete rundown of the accommodations. I felt right at home. I will definitely stay there again."
5304739,54742588,2015-11-23,38976026,Chunyan,"Joe  is very friendly and thoughtful host, left plenty of drinks and snacks, even we did not take any, but it is sweet and warm; left recommendation, brochures and magazines , which is very helpful. It was very clean and comfortable.  The keyless entry made everything easy. The neighborhood is quiet , like the park nearby a lot  and like the recommended restaurant a lot. Will definitely return if we come to Seattle again."
5304739,54834428,2015-11-23,19862185,Charlotte,Place was private in a quiet neighborhood. The place has a side door with a code we let ourselves in.  We never met Joe or Shannon but they were clear and helpful through quick communication. Awesome location near Carpark. I would stay here again. 
5304739,54840072,2015-11-25,22781488,Mary Ann,It was a great experience. She waited for us until she knows we were settled in the house and gave us heads up on what to expect on the day we arrive.
5304739,55084490,2015-11-27,5038050,Rich,"Easy to find, very cozy, and very clean... which is important to me.  The snacks, beverages in the cooler and the coffee for the morning were icing on the cake!

Will happily put on my list to visit again."
5304739,55133841,2015-11-28,48257380,Mary,"We enjoyed our short stay at Joe and Shannon's and felt it was very welcoming, convenient and located in a lovely part of Seattle.  We were able to be close to family and have a comfortable stay.
Thank you for opening your home to us!

Mary"
5304739,55387179,2015-12-01,40495347,Michael,Loved staying here during my vacation in seattle. The living area was very tidy and felt like our own hotel room. We also loved that shannon left a guidebook to the area. Don't miss out on carcreek park!
5304739,56007153,2015-12-07,48734570,Jimmy,This is my first time to use Airbnb I can't say anything (website hidden) everything was perfect. I met the own once really nice person. We were really enjoyed that place
5304739,57401544,2015-12-25,28828415,Haowei,The room is really nice and cozy! Shannon and Joe are really good house owners!
5304739,57526041,2015-12-27,20543813,Darcie,"Joe and Shannon's place was as lovely as they described and pictured. It was very clean, and they were very welcoming and accommodating. The space wasn't far from good restaurants and attractions either. I would highly recommend staying here!"
5304739,57849998,2015-12-29,51414591,경숙,집안 깨끗하고 침실은 편안했다 Joe는 친절하게 우리의 여행을 도왔다 
5304739,58006277,2015-12-31,3517305,Chris And Barbara,"Joe and Shannon were wonderful hosts and the space is as advertised.  Very comfortable beds, nice neighborhood, ready access to all that Seattle has to offer.  We really enjoyed playing scrabble one evening.  Highly recommended.  "
6801095,42347541,2015-08-12,39684380,Tom,"John was an extremely friendly host. He catered to my last minute needs, including dropping off my bags at his house while he wasn't even home. He cooked dinner for me several nights, made me cocktails, and wrote up a whole list of places I should visit in Seattle. He was also incredibly welcoming, letting me do my own thing when I needed to relax, but also involving me in a dinner party he threw. There were countless nights where we sat up and talked for hours. His house was very neat and tidy, and the bed I was sleeping in was amazingly comfortable. All around my experience with staying with John was one of a supreme calibre."
6801095,42797913,2015-08-15,1667392,Alice,"John was the perfect host! I booked for a last minute trip and John was easy to get in contact with and made the check-in process a breeze. 

The property is very spacious and beautiful, set in a tranquil and lovely area of Seattle. There are some fantastic restaurants and bakeries within a very short walking distance, and it is easy to walk to Capitol Hill or to take several bus lines nearby. There are some hills involved, but that's what makes Seattle so beautiful!

I really enjoyed chatting with John at the end of each day to wind-down. His beautiful dog, Sierra, is super friendly and a lot of fun to play with as well. 
"
6801095,43167668,2015-08-17,2450030,Deborah,"We had a great time staying with John. His condo is in a great, central location so it was easy to get anywhere. The condo itself is beautiful and comfortable. The room has a super comfy bed and is right across from a semi-private bath. John was super personable, friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend his place for a Seattle stay!"
6801095,43854572,2015-08-22,41087941,Stefan,"John was very welcoming, helpful and easy going. His house is well located and in a quiet area, which was exactly what I needed to relax. Direct buses to downtown run multiple times per hour from the nearby bus stop. I enjoyed sitting in his backyard, with direct access from the private room, and enjoying the evening. I can definitely recommend John's place for a stay in Seattle."
6801095,44993092,2015-08-30,41568064,Bradley,"Do yourself a favour, stop looking for a room and book your stay with John!

This room offers everything you could want. Plenty of space for two, a personal bathroom directly across the hall, and access to a rooftop patio with some great views. 

On top of all this John is an extremely accommodating host. We were able to drop off our luggage as soon as we arrived in the morning, and keep it stored safely until leaving on a late flight a few days later. John also provided us with a printout that included all of his personal ""must-see"" places and eateries in the city. If you want to get more out of Seattle then the big tourist hotspots then this list is exactly what you need. We visited as many of the spots as we could and enjoyed a lot of good food because of these suggestions. 

In terms of location, the room is located a small distance from downtown. This is actually a blessing however, as you are away from all the hustle and bustle but only one block away (albeit up a fairly steep hill) from a bus stop with routes leading to all of the tourist cores. One bus ride can get you directly into the heart of downtown, or up to Seattle Center where you can find the Space Needle, EMP Museum, and Chihuly Gardens. 

We stayed just a few nights with John, but would not hesitate to book again if returning to Seattle!"
6801095,46224421,2015-09-08,20582754,Maria,"John is an amazing host! My boyfriend and I stayed at his beautiful place for 4 days. He greeted us with a welcome cocktail and gave us lots of great recommendations (food, drinks & sights) for Seattle. We found the bedroom/bathroom exactly as described and we felt more than comfortable.  John's place is located in a cute little neighborhood with lots of great bars, restaurants and parks close by.  It's also just a short walk to multiple bus stops that will take you downtown, though if you travel with someone an Uber is a faster, more convenient and very affordable alternative.  A huge thank you to John, who made everything so easy and even allowed us to leave our luggage with him until late on our check-out day before catching the red-eye back home. When we return to Seattle (which we definitely will!), we would love to stay with John again. 5 STARS!!!"
6801095,49904169,2015-10-07,9679616,Mika,"I would stay with John again in a heartbeat. John was by far the most welcoming airbnb host I have stayed with. He really enjoys having guests and pointing you toward great food. His place is very clean and comfortable. His hospitality extended to little details, water in the room, fresh flowers, coffee and drinks at the ready. His dog Sierra is the sweetest dog you can imagine.  

While not a factor for me, and I was happy with the exercise, John's neighborhood and his place with lots of stairs, is probably not well suited for someone for someone who might find these difficult.      "
6801095,55898111,2015-12-07,1647296,David,"John was a kind and pleasant host. He is very warm, friendly and worked very hard to make me feel at home, and I enjoyed sharing the house with him. The room is on its own floor and so fairly separate from the rest of the townhome. I really enjoyed the tiny well-maintained garden outside of the room. He gave me free run of the common areas of the house and tried to make my stay as pleasant as possible. His dog is super friendly, although she sheds a bit more than I expected as someone who has never owned a dog. The internet worked very well, but the TV not as much. There's a ton to do close by and super easy, fast access to most of my favorite Seattle neighborhoods. Very comfy bed and helpful amenities made my stay very nice."
6835466,42017703,2015-08-10,38537905,Justin,Great space - exactly as described. Whitney was helpful and accommodating - would recommend to anyone.
6835466,46233112,2015-09-08,27221302,Chris,Whitney was an awesome host! She is very friendly and very flexible. My overall experience was a good one.
7777381,46085017,2015-09-07,13145902,Veronique,"Lovely stay - best first Airbnb experience!

I've stayed two days with Jason and Stephanie as my first AirBnb experience and it couldn't have been a better one. They have a lovely apartment with the most adorable pets! If you don't like pets, definitely stay away. If you like them, you'll feel right at home. I've had two relaxing days with quite some work and was accompanied on the couch by the too cute red feline and a soothing purr. With your private bedroom and private bathroom, this is a very nice place to stay. I had two good nights of sleep. They're a 15-20 minute walk from down town and as stated very close to the train station. "
7777381,46540468,2015-09-11,43199159,Lorraine,"Jason and Stephanie were great! They made us feel right at home the moment we stepped in the building. The couple was extremely welcoming and friendly. They were willing to chat and ask us about our plans to see the city. I loved how they were able to respond and communicate INSTANTLY via airbnb messaging so we were able to keep each other updated prior to our arrival. 

The room itself was great! They really weren't exaggerating about the gorgeous panoramic view. It was beautiful to see all the downtown lights at night and to wake up to a gorgeous view of Smith Tower right outside the window. Although on a bit of a hill, the building was easy to find and felt very safe with an additional key needed to get into the building. The neighborhood and surrounding area was quiet so we were able to sleep soundly. It's a 15 minute walk to Pike's and anywhere else in that touristy area. We had our own bathroom right outside the room that was readily supplied with clean towels, shampoo, and conditioner. The apartment and room was clean with our own drawer space, computer to use, ceiling fan, and even an extra lightning cable charger plugged in the bedside! One thing that is a must for any future guests is that they must love pets. Jason and Stephanie have both dogs and cats that are all very well-behaved, clean, and super friendly. We just loved them during our stay! They were so adorable and approachable. This is an ideal stay for any Seattle visitors that are just in to relax and enjoy the city. "
7777381,46999325,2015-09-14,7977439,Jess,"Staying with Jason and Stephanie was great! It was very easy to set up an arrival time which I like because sometimes it is hard coordinating on AirBnB. They have very friendly pets. The room and bathroom were very nice, clean, and uncluttered. Jason and and Stephanie were very friendly. We would stay there again!"
7777381,47320541,2015-09-17,29452723,Charles,"Both the room and the bathroom have a great view. Clean, well-decorated. Stephanie & Jason are very friendly hosts, and their animals are lovely. had a wonderful stay."
7777381,47797396,2015-09-21,11210732,Julia,"I had a wonderful stay at Jason and Stephanie's place. The room was exactly as pictured and described; small and neat, with beautiful light from the bay window and nice furnishings. The bathroom was spotlessly clean. I was in town to visit my parents, and found Jason and Stephanie's apartment to be very convenient to Swedish Medical Center and Chinatown. There is a nice little park next door to their building, which I enjoyed. Communication was just right. Overall, it was perfect for my short visit! Thanks, Stephanie and Jason!"
7777381,48365806,2015-09-25,43629165,Jon,"Jason and Stephanie were amazing hosts. This was my first time using airbnb and I could not have asked for a better experience. Their apartment is in a great location with a beautiful view from the guest room. It is within walking distance of the Pike Market, the sports venues, and a number of great bars and restaurants. Both them and their pets were great. I would happily stay with them again, and highly recommend their apartment."
7777381,50654909,2015-10-13,1803361,Christian,"stephanie, jason and their dogs and cats where great hosts!! uncomplicated and very courteous- when we arrived jason even picked us up from the station because it was raining!
the room is small, but incredible comfortable and very clean-just like the whole apartment!!! we can definitely recommend staying at their place-and no one will give you a warmer welcome when you come home after a long day as their two gorgeous dogs ;))!!
cheers stef & chris"
7777381,50997827,2015-10-16,38756929,Jamie,Nice stay! Friendly people and gorgeous view. Had some issue with getting keys but we were able to figure that out in the end. 
7777381,52003087,2015-10-25,38292651,Kruaorn (Kim),I enjoyed staying with Jason and Stephanie. Their place was clean and close to the downtown. The view from the window was amazing and their pets were really cute!
7777381,53480142,2015-11-09,41327197,Kimberly,Place was exactly as pictured. Great location with a great view in a secured building. Located just a short walk to the light rail and bus station. The animals are very friendly and Stephanie was very welcoming!
7777381,54901321,2015-11-25,25001643,Yipeng,"We really enjoyed our stay in Seattle. The room was clean and neat, exactly the same as described and pictured. Jason and Stephanie were great hosts, and their dogs and cats were very friendly as well. The apartment locates in the International District, and many authentic Chinese and Japanese restaurants are within a few blocks. The apartment is close to downtown Seattle, and is close to bus stops and train station as well. If we revisit Seattle in the future, we would choose to stay in their place again :) "
7777381,55058207,2015-11-27,49387037,Paris,"We were welcomed (despite our late arrival) with both enthusiasm and recommendations for late-night restaurants--and many, many cats, which was fantastic. Both Jason and Stephanie were very kind, supplying us with tea and fascinating conversations on the state of American politics. They made their home feel like our home, and their menagerie of animals was equally hospitable. And the view is incredible, even from the shower. I'm now looking for excuses to come back."
7777381,56227157,2015-12-10,47506485,Matthew,"Jason and Stephanie were just great. Their dogs and cats are especially friendly, if you have a problem with them then you are probably a bad person. Room was clean and comfortable, the view was great, these two are excellent people. A warning to the next person, they do not allow guests no exception. So if you are hanging out with friends and want a place to have people over this is not for you. 
5 stars
Highly recommended, it's a steal for the price."
7777381,56516482,2015-12-14,16070667,Justin,A wonderful stay with Jason and Stephanie. Close enough to downtown to take a morning stroll or walk to a museum. 
6492880,33877610,2015-06-01,26322293,Katie,"Great neighborhood, within walking distance to food and nightlife.  We were able to find on-street parking without a problem.  The home was super clean and welcoming, the bed comfortable and having Sylvia stick her head out to say hello was great.  "
6492880,34487115,2015-06-08,34218597,Christal,"The listing was accurate and the area was great! Super convenient for what my family needed. The apartment was very clean and they even provided towels, soap, and shampoo. There was also a Keurig, coffee, and biscotti.  I would definitely use Bev again, and I would highly recommend the apartment, unless you are looking for something with a full kitchen. But it was great for our needs!"
6492880,35689550,2015-06-21,24836421,Alessandra,"We felt really home at Bev's house. It is in a great location, quiet despite the proximity to I-5, clean and organized. It was fun to ""discover"" something new about the decoration every day and all the family pictures around make the place cosy. The only note goes to accessing the entrance door, because I didn't know I had to open a small gate and go to the back door, so it took us a while to figure it out considering the key didn't open the front door and we were afraid of invading a private property.  Only the next day did we see an arrow on the gate pointing at the right direction though. There is so much decor around the house that we missed that... Another point is the lack of a kitchen sink ( I also hadn't realized that in the house description) and although there were plates and stuff, we didn't prepare anything cause there was no place to wash them properly. Other than that, I really enjoyed the experience and recommend the place. "
6492880,36797798,2015-07-01,12454509,Mackenzie,"This place was just perfect- it was comfortable, clean, spacious, and up to date. Perfect location right in-between Greenlake, Wallingford, and the UDistrict. It was super quick for my father and I to walk to Greenlake for a run around the lake, and to all the coffee and breakfast places a few blocks away, with even more options for dinner also within a 5 minute driving distance. Easy to get anywhere in Seattle from here, really. The bed and couch were both great to sleep on. Also, all the amazing art and photographs up on the walls made the place feel like an actual home and the hosts were amazingly warm and welcoming!

Plus was the mini kitchen and the cute dogs !"
6492880,37780085,2015-07-10,33874155,Shane,Bev was a great host. I got responses to all my inquiries in a timely manner. The place is really unique. You can tell Bev is a global traveler and has incorporated that flair into the decor. Easy bus routes nearby. You're walking distance to the lake with plenty of restaurants/cafes nearby. Would recommend.
6492880,38736326,2015-07-18,15763592,Benjamin,"Staying here was a great experience!  The apartment has a lot of character with books and travel pictures from all over.  You can tell that the hosts are kindred spirits.  Bev was very helpful, promptly answering questions beforehand, and although we didn't interact much while I was there (the place has a lot of privacy) she seemed very pleasant.  The location is great, too, walking distance to Green Lake and a lot of cool neighborhoods nearby."
6492880,39520120,2015-07-24,5405409,Laura,"This place was perfect for us, and I'd definitely recommend. The bed and the sleeper sofa were both very comfortable and we had plenty of extra sheets and blankets put out for us to use. I also appreciated the hair dryer! The apartment had tons of character and had tons of travel books of all kinds to explore, for both Seattle, WA, and around the world. Everything is very easily accessible, and the street had plenty of parking for our rental car."
6492880,41420447,2015-08-07,27088911,Pamela,"This was such a cute, cozy place.  Very clean & well-decorated.  Walking distance to Green Lake park, Elysian, donuts, and coffee...nice location."

Colorful and Retro was exactly as described.   It is in an older Greenlake neighborhood. Very quaint and comfortable and was perfect for our needs.  It is decorated in finds from Bev's travels and great family pictures.  Coffee and Biscotti awaited us upon arrival.  On the coffee table were numerous travel brochures and restaurant info which were very helpful.  Along with a comfortable queen bed, the pull out couch was soooo comfortable as well.  It was nice to have the small refrigerator and microwave .   A great place to crash after long days sight seeing.  We highly recommend Colorful and Retro. "
6492880,43257194,2015-08-18,14355217,Martin,"This is a beautiful, wonderfully decorated, and quiet gem. The neighborhood is walking distance to stores, cafes, and restaurants. there is adequate on~street parking."
6492880,44945321,2015-08-30,2233574,Dave,"Fantastic place, everything you need is there, great location. My only gripe is the property is managed through a 3rd party management company which is impersonal and what I believe to be against the culture of Airbnb "
6492880,47264022,2015-09-17,39871155,Denise,"Bev was very welcoming when we arrived and made it clear we could contact her for any reason. The place was just as depicted... Cheerful, colorful, clean, comfortable (great bed) and complete with biscotti (nice touch) and plenty of info on local sites and restaurants. We had no car but if we had, we still would have taken the bus a half block away to downtown as we were able to see so much of the area without the burden of driving and parking in the city. It truly was wonderful at the end of a long, eventful day to have a home away from home to relax in."
4316910,35144711,2015-06-15,16224099,Amy,"The apartment was in a good location just outside the city, with easy access to and from the freeway. The pictures accurately depict the apartment. I assumed they were not current because they did not show any furniture or decor. It is only that there is no decor and only a sofa/bed (no TV). It was very small, but all that I needed. He had no problem with an additional guest without much notice. Malhar was friendly and did send an email to ask if we had settled in. He was able to provide a Wi-Fi password right after I asked for it. The sofa bed had a thin mattress and was extremely uncomfortable. I could tell this is not someone experienced at renting. I became concerned and started looking for a back up place to stay when I did not hear from him prior to the stay with any information or instructions. He did not reply to texts. The day I was to arrive he replied to my airbnb message requesting any information I might need, and he said I would get the code the day I was arriving; then provided it as soon as he realized I was checking in that same day. The apartment was not clean by guest standards. The carpet had brown spots just inside the door that would have cleaned up easily. There were cobwebs in the shower and hairs on the toilet. Little touches were missing that I feel tell a guest their host cares about their comfort. There was coffee, but no coffee maker. There was a tea kettle, but no tea. There was a table in the kitchen if you wanted to eat standing up, but it prevented the oven door from opening. As I said...little touches. I think with just a little work and better communication, it would be a very nice place to stay. It was satisfactory for my purposes, but I would not stay there again."
4316910,35283052,2015-06-17,34951355,Nutcharat,The host canceled this reservation 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4316910,35616611,2015-06-20,1349586,Alex,I had a pretty good stay at Malhar's place although we never actually met as he was traveling at the time. The location is very convenient especially if you need to get to and from the airport. The bed on offer is a pull out sofa (something that was not communicated to me before the stay leading to some confusion). The place was pretty comfortable  but with the sofa bed down there was not much space at all and it got very hot inside the apartment. But at only $70/night I thought it offered very good value for the whole apartment. Overall communication was not particularly good but I'd say Malhar's place is a pretty good place to stay in downtown Seattle.
4316910,35951584,2015-06-23,34194418,Elizabeth,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for his birthday weekend. It's such a cute place and even though it's small, it's really the perfect size for two. He even had shampoo, conditioner, body wash, tooth paste, mouth wash and soap waiting. All brand new. He also had towels and I was super happy about that! The only thing that may be a problem when staying in the summer is that it tends to get a little stuffy and there isn't any air conditioner (as noted in his description). We ended up opening the window and the door while we were in there and it totally aired out and was really nice. The kitchen was great and had cups plates silverware, the works. We would definitely stay again. He was also very flexible with our arrival time and got back to me fast regarding the wifi password. "
4316910,36321544,2015-06-27,35602761,Sarah,Very clean space. We has had a great time! It was small but perfrct size for just sleeping after exploring the city each day. It's tucked into a quiet little street close enough to see and do everything. Hots was helpful even though we never saw him.
4316910,38462670,2015-07-15,1349586,Alex,Very convenient location. Good price. Pretty comfortable. I've stayed with Malhar twice now and both times have been great.
4316910,38670673,2015-07-17,24871163,Ginger,"Malhar was very helpful when I arrived, responding quickly to my questions and offering extra help.  A very thoughtful host.
This is somewhat small, but I only needed a place to sleep and a shower, so it was perfect.  Although I didn't use it, there is a cute kitchenette. 
Parking is on the street, and it is a VERY steep street.  (think San Francisco) This was a challenge for me due to my older age, as well as my vehicle being a manual transmission. 
The neighborhood is very nice, and this is near enough to the freeway for easy travel.  Overall, I had a lovely stay."
4316910,39679842,2015-07-25,37436043,Isaac,Just as described. An excellent place to rest my head after a day of trekking Seattle's hills. The bus stop is only a short walk along along a nearby path. And there's an excellent Peruvian restaurant about a block away.
4316910,39944503,2015-07-27,30526660,Chris,"We weren't looking for anything fancy. Just some place to sleep.  It met all our requirements.  We didn't even meet the host.  It was a bit far of a walk to downtown, but for the price, it was great."
4316910,40365379,2015-07-30,37925423,Eve,"Excellent place, very clean and homely, walking distance from city centre and attractions! Would definitely recommend this cozy suite! "
4316910,41684776,2015-08-08,9721711,Stephen,"The space is perfect for a couple of people who need somewhere to crash whilst they explore beautiful Seattle. The space is small but well appointed and has everything you would need. A futon, bathroom and washer drier along with kitchen area. The host had great communication skills and helped us out a lot when we lost our way. I would definitely recommend staying here if you are wanting to explore Seattle."
4316910,42160634,2015-08-11,21289769,Lauren,"Malhar was a great host, very friendly!  The apartment is quite cozy but in a good central location.   Overall, it's a great value and I would definitely stay there again."
4316910,43801318,2015-08-22,38079166,Nikki,"The host promptly answered every question I had and was great throughout the entire process. 

The place is really nice and the bathroom was fully stocked with full size amenities and the shower had great water pressure ( a huge deal for someone like myself with super long hair). 

The unit was as described, but it can be a little tricky to get to if you don't know where it is ( GPS gave several cab drivers crazy directions, so I just started verbally giving the dispatch directions to make it easier) and be warned that it is up a small hill, but well worth the hike.

There is a washer and dryer, as well, which was really convenient, and a full set of towels and pillows/sheets was ready and waiting at check-in.

The only thing I can suggest is that the host buy a fan for guests to use during the summer. I wasn't able to reach the window to open it and didn't want to climb onto the counter to do so."
4316910,44455002,2015-08-26,39754326,Louis,Good apartment located close to the highway.
4316910,45391812,2015-09-02,39355418,Timothy,I stayed at this spot for 5 nights and it was everything I was looking for. I was out in Seattle for most of the days so I didn't spend too much time in the room. The small kitchen served my purposes and the bathroom was well supplied. The place was clean and I didn't have any issues. 
4316910,50478060,2015-10-12,34432580,Ashley,"Malhar's place was perfect for what I needed during my stay in Seattle: a place to sleep, leave my things without worrying, and a clean bathroom. The kitchenette was a bonus, so I got to store a few things in the fridge and heat up some food. There isn't too much ventilation, but we just opened the doors and ran the kitchen/ bathroom fans when we felt stuffy. I was a little worried at first because Malhar wasn't as responsive as my other hosts, but don't worry, he's just busy working a lot! He will get back to you with everything you need as soon as he can. The bed is a pull out from the sofa, so naturally the mattress isn't the comfiest, but I'm very low maintenance, so I didn't complain. I used uber to get around, and the most I paid to get to the city where the space needle is was about $11-14. I had a great experience staying at Malhar's, I would definitely recommend! 
"
4316910,50790281,2015-10-14,24746225,Martha,"This was a nice place, matched the listing and was very clean. It is quite small but it has everything you need (microwave, bathroom, etc).  My only issue was with the wifi. I specifically chose a place with wifi as I had to check in with work while I was out of the office in Seattle. If I didn't need wifi, I may have chosen a different place. The network name wasn't included on the sheet with the password, and it took the host 9 hours to get back to me as to which network it was. Then, the password didn't work. So finally, seven hours after that, the host came to the apartment, and upon seeing the info sheet, said that the wrong password was on the info sheet. So overall, I ended up having to use phone data (which was costly because I was in a different country) for most of my stay because they put insufficient/incorrect information on the sheet. Again, this is not a big deal if you don't need wifi, but I specifically chose a place with that amenity and for one amenity not to be included because of human error (and to cost me extra cash) was not really up to standards for me. Otherwise, it was a nice place, clean, and close to downtown."

8518308,48848897,2015-09-28,45070751,Andrew,"Amazing. It was my first time using Airbnb and it could not have been a better experience. It was a spotless place and Goran is friendly and accommodating. Excellent location within walking distance to the space needle. It was awesome that he has indoor parking too! He also has an awesome map, in the kitchen, of local restaurants that he recommends. We are already planning our return trip to this pad. "
8518308,49843243,2015-10-06,24804245,Anali,"Goran's home made my stay in Seattle a million times better than if I stayed in a hotel. It is in a great location , we didn't have to drive more than 5 miles to get anywhere and at a really great price . For 2 nights we paid the price of one night at a hotel possibly even cheaper. The whole place has a really great feel to it, especially when you're smoking some of that free bud he left you ;) it really did feel like we were living there . It was a great experience !"
8518308,50685789,2015-10-13,44842618,Jill,"Goran is a really nice host. The apt is lovely and clean. The location is great, Kerry park is like 5 mins away which probably has the best view of this whole city. If I get a chance to back to Seattle, I will definitely stay here again. 给中国游客们，筒子们，Goran的房子很不错哦，很舒服哒，也很方便。小区的治安各方面都不错，来西雅图就选这里吧～"
8518308,51392729,2015-10-19,15655717,Ashley,"Goran was super welcoming.  His place looks just like it does in the photo.  Very clean.  Picking up the keys was easy and he was very responsive with his messaging. Was a great location, easy to Uber or Lyft to all the bars and restaurants we went to.

8518308,54112693,2015-11-16,42937880,Felicia,"Goran was really welcoming and very responsive to all of our communications. His apartment was inviting and a pleasure to stay in. The perfect place for a relaxing weekend. Overall a cool guy with a cool apartment.

As an added bonus, Kerry park was only a few blocks away and a great spot for an amazing view of the city (or people watching if that's what you're into)!"

8518308,55881450,2015-12-06,504088,Karla,"Goran's place was perfectly located! It close enough to city center while being in a quiet residential neighborhood. We easily found free street parking just a block away. Goran was very accommodating and flexible with our arrival time meeting us at his place for the keys. His place is perfect for a couple or up to three people as long as one doesn't mind sleeping on the couch (it was very comfy by the way!) We only stayed one night, though we wished we could have stayed longer. I'll be sure to book again on my next visit to Seattle. Thank you Goran!

P.S. Don't miss the city view from Kerry Park just three blocks away."
8518308,56205987,2015-12-10,25066153,Joanna,"Goran was an excellent host and his place was everything we hoped for and more. He asked us ahead of time if we drink wine and had a bottle waiting on the counter for us when we arrived. He checked in periodically via text to see if there was anything we needed. His place was clean and he had written clear instructions on how/where to find everything we might need or want to use. After long days of exploring, it was nice coming back to a place that was cozy and felt like home. I'd definitely check to see if his place is available next time I plan another trip to Seattle!"
8518308,56737172,2015-12-17,45038620,David,"Dragan is really nice, and helped us how to use the gas and heating.

Everything about the apartment was just as wonderful as the listing describes. His place was clean, cozy, and comfortable. He's also got an amazing entertainment center in the living room. It's so nice that we almost didn't want to leave the apartment, but I am glad we did because he is located in a really great area close to many restaurants, cafes, and bars, and walking distance from downtown! Really made our first trip to Seattle a memorable one. Would recommend Goran and his place any day! "

2532879,11204218,2014-03-24,7453292,Jordan,"Cole's place was great! It looks just as the pictures show. The bed was comfortable and can easily fit two people (the couch can also work, if you don't want to share). The bathroom and kitchen was clean, and while the apartment is physically on the small side, it feels quite spacious and not cramped. The apartment is in a good location; tons of restaurants and bars around, and from there, downtown was less than a 5 minute walk. Major bus lines that take you practically to all the famous/important spots of city run by his place. 

Cole was an awesome host. He gave us many suggestions on what to do, where to eat, etc. My roommate and I would definitely return next time we get the chance to visit the great city of Seattle."
2532879,11368444,2014-03-31,10971094,A. Minetta,"Cole's studio is great: a lot of wonderful plants, books, and art to make you feel like you're in a home, not a hotel. He left out wine (which I greatly appreciated after several delayed flights that got me in late) and offered recommendations on dining, coffee, etc. The building is perfectly located for anyone doing business or vacation in downtown Seattle. And the place gets the most perfect morning sun (as the weather allows it)."
2532879,13182663,2014-05-21,6628472,Julia,"It was great to come back from a long day and feel right at home. Cole's place is filled with plants and art, and the bed is really comfortable. It's in a perfect location for anyone going downtown, and the bars in Capitol Hill are great after work. "
2532879,13551421,2014-05-30,668551,Dave,"What a great place to stay in Seattle! Cole was a *great* host - communication was on point & key exchange was super easy. He gave me a quick overview of the neighborhood, pointing me in a few good directions. His home is well appointed, comfy and  well located. Would definitely stay again."
2532879,14400269,2014-06-18,15373835,William,"Cole was very friendly & accommodating. His studio apartment was perfect for our stay in Capitol Hill... clean, close to the fun, & surprisingly quiet. My girlfriend & I highly recommend this location for people who want the real Capitol Hill experience in Seattle. We hope to stay there again in the near future. "
2532879,14920909,2014-06-29,6304938,Thomas,Cole has a great apartment in a wonderful neighborhood.  Close to downtown and easy to find and get around from. I hope to go back 
2532879,15061241,2014-07-01,16573599,Grzegorz,My partner and I stayed at Cole's place for two nights and had a great time. The apartment was cosy and had everything we needed. The location and neighbourhood were perfect. Cole had the keys ready for us when we arrived and was flexible and easy to contact. Thanks for hosting us!
2532879,15373719,2014-07-07,2178827,Leslie,Cole's place was great! Located in a cool building that was close to everything- a good jumping off spot to explore the city.  He was easy to talk to and provided some good tips on places to check out.  Definitely recommend. 
2532879,15759754,2014-07-15,15607475,Sy,Studio was comfortable.  Location is prime.  Walking distance to a ton of restaurants and bars.  Close enough to walk to the stadium and catch a Sounders game. Plenty of parking nearby.
2532879,16544371,2014-07-29,14056683,Hannah,"Cole's place is great! My partner and I were there for five nights, and the apartment was perfectly located for exploring both Downtown and Capitol Hill. It's just enough space for two to be comfortable in, and it felt like an inviting place to come back to at the end of each day.

Cole was communicative before and after booking and pleasant in person. He left us some sweets and flowers - a nice touch. 

The only downside for us was that the bed is quite soft."
2532879,16846778,2014-08-03,10854411,Steve,"The apartment was exactly as expected and the process was very easy---the only issue was that the elevator had some issues during the second day. 

Otherwise everything was great."
2532879,17005160,2014-08-05,6327746,Jovilo,It was a pleasant experience.  The place was as expected.  I just needed a place for my daughter and I to sleep and shower.  Didn't expect anymore.  The place was a bit small but good enough for our purpose. The refrigerator was on the warm side so used the freezer instead to store drinks and food.  Not a big deal.  
2532879,17350409,2014-08-11,14950376,Aiko,"Neighborhood was fantastic. Lots of great places in walking distance (coffee, food, theatre, etc). The light rail was only a short walk away as well, making it really easy to get to/from the airport. Cole was there to meet/greet us. He's very welcoming and has a great selection of books. It was easy to feel at home. "
2532879,17848194,2014-08-18,15272399,Alana,Cole was very welcoming. He showed us around and gave us some suggestions for places to see/eat at. His place is adorable and very unique. My boyfriend and I had a great stay here and it was a good location. Easily walkable to Pike market and also great places around Capitol Hill.
2532879,18257514,2014-08-24,11105236,Wayne,"Cole immediately made my boyfriend and I feel welcome - even if the key swap happened in the middle of Seattle's international airport :) 

The apartment was clean, cozy, and in the middle of a great part of Seattle with endless places to explore.  The size of the apartment was perfect for a couple and parking was easy with the resident pass. 

Lastly, we took all of Cole's great food, coffee, and site suggestions - which were all great.  I am already missing my Kaladi coffee mornings! "
2532879,18478621,2014-08-27,7247512,Erica,"Cole was always quick to answer my questions and though he was unavailable, his girlfriend was so kind to meet with me, give me some suggestions with restaurants and overall very helpful. The studio is exactly as pictured and you can't help but feel cozy and at home. It's certainly in a great location - lots of great places to eat! Parking is definitely difficult in the area so can't say you weren't warned. 

Quick tip: the elevator in the building just needs a little extra loving. Be gentle with it."
2532879,18660534,2014-08-30,4505525,Adeeba,"Everything about our stay here was perfect. Cole was super nice about meeting us and giving us a run down of the building and neighborhood. 
The apartment was CLEAN and tidy. It was small, but most definitely enough space for the two of us.
We couldn't have been more conveniently located. Once we arrived, we parked the car and didn't move it again until we left- the apartment is within walking distance if literally everything we wanted to see and do. 
I would absolutely recommend staying here! "
2532879,18876110,2014-09-02,12973037,Terry,"This place is easy to find and close to the best parts of Seattle. It was perfect for my son and I to attend PAX at the convention centre. It has comfortable beds and a small kitchen/eating area. Cole is very personable, easy to communicate with, and was very helpful in orienting us to the area. "
2532879,19150798,2014-09-07,18699138,Adam,"This was my first Air BnB experience and it set the bar high. Cole was a great host. He was easy going, super quick on his responses and texts, and his place was great. I was in town for a friends wedding and his place was a wonderful quiet retreat in a noisy weekend. The whole home is very zen and it has to be one of the best locations in the city. It's so close to downtown and even closer to a ton of really good restaurants. I asked Cole if he knew any good breakfast places and he reponded with a huge list of local joints, one of which is now my new favorite sandwich shop in town. I honestly have to nitpick to find anything negative so I won't bother. I would highly recommend Cole and is beautiful place for anyone looking for a spot to stay in downtown Seattle."
2532879,19335317,2014-09-10,20437347,Maggie,"The place was just what we need, but with a nice flair. The apartment was cozy, and piled high with interesting books and plants. 
The location was perfect, we were planning on taking the bus to downtown everyday, but we were close enough we just walked everywhere.  Things did not really get too loud at night, we did have the windows open. Some of the street lights were pretty bright and the bed a little soft though. 

This was a great stay. Thank you so much. :)
-Maggie"
2532879,19435600,2014-09-12,20790179,Laura,"Cole was an excellent host, meeting us promptly and giving us some good tips on where to eat/drink in the area. The flat was very comfortable, safe and in a brilliant location. I was able to contact Cole with any questions we had and he very kindly responded quickly.  I would recommend Cole and his flat to anyone staying in Seattle, we had a fantastic time."
2532879,19905015,2014-09-20,1679863,Lara,Cole is super nice and was very flexible. The apartment was cozy and clean. 
2532879,20034631,2014-09-22,20419499,Dan,"My partner and I really enjoyed our weekend stay at Cole's place.  We saw Cole briefly when we arrived, and he had everything ready for us and we were settled in comfortably in no time.  The apartment was comfortable and clean, with a nice laid back feel.  We both slept exceptionally well, and were shocked by how quiet it was at night with the windows open.  Considering how loud it can be with the Capitol Hill bar crowd on weekends, I was amazed to find a place where you can't hear the racket from the nearby streets.  We were within walking distance to our favorite restaurants and bars, and even tried some new restaurants Cole suggested in his guidebook (great suggestions).  The neighborhood parking pass is a nice touch too.  We'd stay here again on future trips to Seattle.   Thanks Cole!"
2532879,20443864,2014-09-29,19705144,Suzanne,"My friend and I appreciated Cole's friendly and cheerful hosting and responsive communication. His place is really cute and well kept, and it suited our needs very well. The neighborhood is a great location with lots of walkable amenities. Thanks so much for a very fine airbnb experience!"
2532879,20584066,2014-10-01,21655899,Lance,This was my first experience with Airbnb. Thanks to Cole will use this service for all my travels. Cole has a great spot within walking distance of all things Downtown Seattle and it was very clean and very comfortable. 
2532879,21486456,2014-10-18,138229,Bryce & Brian,"I had a nice stay at Cole's apartment.  The neighborhood is fantastic, and the apartment was what was promised in the listing.  It was clean and comfortable."
2532879,22051454,2014-10-28,1578332,Ariel,"Cole was great, giving me all the right info to enjoy my stay. The place was clean and felt like home.
He wow me with the coffee as well. I will definitely stay again."
2532879,23197763,2014-11-24,17311470,Chelsea,"Cole was so accommodating for our late arrival, even when we arrived later than we planned. The studio was very clean with cool art, books, and atmosphere. The Capitol hill location is convenient near restaurants and bars. We had a great stay and would definitely stay here again!"
2532879,23665517,2014-12-07,665814,Steve,"Communication was great with Cole. Everything was as advertised. Next time I'm in the area, I will set time aside to check out his eclectic collection of books."
2532879,24497116,2014-12-29,2335282,Jack,"The only bad thing I have to say about Cole's place is that the pictures really don't do it justice--in addition to a perfect location, it's a lovely place to hang out in after a long day of city-exploring, with big windows and a soft couch and bed. Would highly recommend booking to anyone traveling to Seattle. "
2532879,24902103,2015-01-03,12394139,Eric,"Fantastic location! Cole was very accommodating, would definitely stay again."
2532879,25570554,2015-01-19,25851986,Britt,"What a great location! You can walk everywhere. The hospitality at this place was great! A quiet apt building, we hardly saw anyone so that makes it nice for relaxing- no one banging around next door!"
2532879,26760016,2015-02-18,14080451,Danielle,"The place was great! My boyfriend and I stayed at Cole's place while looking for apartments for our move up there, and I think my boyfriend may have fallen in love with it. Everything's clean and we spent a lot of the time reading the books. We also loved the art. I would definitely stay here again. Cole was also very quick with responses and information, which was incredibly helpful."
2532879,28140641,2015-03-18,26034599,Sebastian,"Cole's place is awesome. If this is your first time visiting Seattle, you really can't beat it location wise. Just blocks from tons of great places to eat in Capitol Hill and only a short walk to Downtown. Cole was super thoughtful throughout our stay as well and was able to answer all of our questions about the area. Definitely recommended!"
2532879,28489129,2015-03-24,8334976,James,"Cole's apartment was very clean and it was a great location close to everything!  He had us pick up the keys at a coffee shop near his apartment. This went smoothly but it would have been nice to meet him.  However, he was very good at communicating via text and the airbnb website. The decor in his apartment was very interesting, filled with great books and cool rocks. The kitchen was very small and there weren't too many dishes so cooking would have been a challenge.  I would recommend Cole's place to people that want a clean space in a superior location, who would like to eat out at all the great restaurants near by.   "
2532879,28619331,2015-03-27,3896407,Zoohey,"This apartment could not have been more suitable for our trip. Being walking distance from the Light Rail and Pike Market as well as literally down the street from some great Seattle gems, we were extremely satisfied with Cole's welcoming hospitality. 

Being able to pick up the keys at a coffee shop down the street helped with our check in time as our flight came in later. The elevator is a little creepy, but the location was so prime. Even our Uber/Lyft drivers commented on what a great neighborhood to find a place to stay at. We were very lucky and if we come to Seattle again we would definitely stay here."
2532879,29564857,2015-04-09,23989265,Brett,"We had a great time staying at Cole's place.  His apartment is centrally located and within walking distance of many great places.  Also, definitely check out his Guide Book.  We went to several of his recommendations for restaurants and loved every place.

The pictures for this place don't really do it justice.  We were surprised to find a much bigger place than we expected.  Overall, it was a homey and warm place to stay for a few nights.

We will definitely look to stay in Cole's place the next time we are in Seattle."
2532879,29927216,2015-04-14,29153618,Charles Lauriat,"Cole's place was great! Perfect for a couple or solo traveler. Easy walking distance to the convention center, tons of dining options, coffee shops, etc. Very diverse neighborhood. Cole was helpful landing me and his recommendations were good too. A great value for Capitol Hill"
2532879,32583500,2015-05-19,4565135,Steven,"Cole was very friendly and accommodating, responding almost immediately by text and by email. He was actually at the coffee house where we picked up the key. The location of the apartment could not be better or more convenient in the Capital Hill area, just above downtown. The apartment is clean. The kitchen is small. The bed is quite comfortable. Cole made sure all our needs were being met.     "
2532879,34422789,2015-06-08,30856475,Justin,"Me and my fiance had a great stay at Cole's studio apartment. First off; It is a TERRIFIC location. Was only 15 minutes walking distance to Pike's Market, and about 40 minutes walking distance to Safeco Fields. Also only 10 minute walk to the train/railway system that runs throughout the city. This was the biggest plus for us.

The place itself was also very nice. It's obviously a lived in studio, so almost has that ""staying at a friends/relatives"" home kind of feel. The bed was a tad soft for my liking, but I still got a good nights rest. Seattle was very warm while we were there, so I slept with the window(s) open. Was surprised at how quiet it was. There was some noise before midnight on the weekend, but nothing that bothered me much at all.

As for the host himself, Cole was great at communicating with me before and during the stay. Always quick to respond to my text messages, which I greatly appreciated. He also provided some recommendations of places to see and eat, which was nice. We went to some very enjoyable coffee shops and restaurants right around his studio.

I recommend Cole's studio to anyone wanting a central Seattle location that gives you access to many different parts of the City. It was a very pleasant experience. "
2532879,36562039,2015-06-29,16212819,Gina,My brother and I had a great stay at Cole's place in Seattle! The location was great -- just about a 20 min walk from Pike Place Market! Cole was very helpful and accommodating! He was able to suggest a few good spots for drinks and food in the area. I would definitely recommend his place to others! Thanks Cole!! 
2532879,37089492,2015-07-04,668767,Eva,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful stay at Cole's place! The studio is a wonderful, clean, and eclectically decorated bungalow. It is also in the middle of a bustling Capitol Hill neighborhood without being subjected to the street noise. Communication with Cole was really smooth, and he did everything he could to make our check-in, check-out, and the stay itself comfortable. "
2532879,37565815,2015-07-08,1849779,Mindy,"The location of Cole's place was as good as described. It really couldn't be beat. Despite being in a busy part of the city his apartment was situated in such a way that it was pretty quiet at night. Coordinating with him was a snap. Picking up the keys was easy. The downside: I was there during a heat wave and the place was hot as hell. This is not his fault of course but because it was on the 5th floor of an older building it got hot later in the day, between 6 - 8 when we were looking to relax before dinner. I think normally this isn't a problem and with a window fan it will be improved. The place is small and he has quite a bit of furniture in there so it felt cramped at times. That said, it was a fine place to stay for the price. "
2532879,38146136,2015-07-13,35090962,Adrian,"Great host and very responsive to all my questions. Neat and clean location. The location is between 2 parallel streets that take you straight into downtown Seattle. A short 7 mins walk downhill. 

Further up the hill leads you to lots of restaurant and pubs. 

Great experience. Cole made the place available to us for a full 3 days.  "
2532879,39024425,2015-07-20,9353996,Maryann,Cole is very responsive! The room was small but all that I needed for my stay. 
2532879,39920868,2015-07-27,2091336,Jason,My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at Cole's apartment. Cole was very helpful and accommodating. The location in Capitol Hill was fantastic. Close to great bars and restaurants and a close walk or taxi to downtown. Thanks!
2532879,40909453,2015-08-03,33683829,Conor,"After a brief snafu because of my lack of smart phone, Cole helped to get us into his place and it was great. Amazing location in Capitol Hill, close to tons of restaurants and cafes. Short walk to Pike Place. Close to light rail makes it easy to get to from the airport. Very hot the week we were in Seattle but with windows open and fan on it was comfortable. Will definitely look to stay at Cole's again."
2532879,41203785,2015-08-05,429202,Thomas,Our host left two beers in the refrigerator which was very nice. There was also a bus map on the table which was considerate.
2532879,42522543,2015-08-14,33297195,Amy,"Cole was a great host, and his place was perfect for our 4 nights in town for a conference at the convention center! He was very responsive and always pleasant, the key pick-up and drop-off was easy, and the location was super convenient and in a fun neighborhood."
2532879,45367858,2015-09-02,32856076,Brett,"Had a great stay at Cole's place. Great location, building is nice and quiet, easy to communicate/coordinate with Cole, would definitely stay again."
2532879,46970207,2015-09-14,43171325,Peter,"Studio was exactly as pictured, very comfortable for a 5 night stay. Cole was friendly, responsive, and helpful throughout.  Lots of great places to get coffee, dinner, drinks within close walking distance.  Had a very nice experience, would stay again if I return."
2532879,48043495,2015-09-22,24496738,Rachel,Cole's place was great! Exactly how depicted in pictures and terrific location within walking distance to everything. Cole was also very responsive to any questions I had. Would for sure stay here again. 
2532879,50690464,2015-10-13,40626890,Francesca,"There was problem with check-in however Cole dealt with it generously and professionally. The apartment is super convenient to the convention center which is just down the hill and there are plenty of eateries nearby. The apartment is cozy, colorful, and quiet. "
2532879,52495735,2015-10-30,1261538,Peter,"Great location, secure building, easy key collection. All good. Thanks!"
5489676,32913012,2015-05-23,4071102,Dongqing,"The apartment is very close to kerry park( 10 minutes walk, perfect night views there) and space needle. The location of the apartment is convenient. Both bedrooms are spacious. Travis was very considerate when exchanging the keyes. I would recommend his apartment to my friends. "
5489676,34046386,2015-06-03,10959155,Sandra,The host canceled this reservation 34 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5163047,33125415,2015-05-25,8958256,Brian,"Accurate listing - clean, quiet, and great location. Ravendar was not around for the weekend but was an excellent host and facilitated a smooth check-in. The flexible check-out time was also fantastic, I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
5163047,33856207,2015-06-01,11514405,Andrew,"Ravendar was a wonderful host.  He responded quickly to all questions, was very accomodating and helpful and all around super pleasant and a great host.  The room was as described, and the whole place was very neat and clean.  The hosts were generous enough to let us use their kitchen utilities.  The place has a gorgeous view of the surrounding area from the rooftop, definitely check this out!  "
5163047,35211801,2015-06-16,30669713,Yixin,"My experience was great. Ravendar's room was great, big, clean, close to the tourist places and public transportations. Ravendar is a great guy, very considerate and easy to talk to. His roommate was also very kind to accommodate us when we arrive. Thank you guys!"
5163047,46088097,2015-09-07,43215938,Debbie,We had a fabulous time and enjoyed Seattle and our stay.  Host was extremely kind and offered great suggestions on things to see and do.  We would definitely stay here again.  Thanks!!
5163047,54008705,2015-11-15,47316542,Sharon,Although Ravendar was away when we arrived he made sure we were met by his friend with the keys and a walk through his apartment. We were very comfortable. His place is in a very convenient location  to Seattle Center and walking to explore the area was fun. Ravendar stayed in touch to make sure we had everything we needed to have a great stay.
8150045,45637157,2015-09-04,1247368,Mary,"Gloria and her husband were great to work with and quickly responded regarding an immediate need for that night. The cottage had just went live, and I happened to inquire within minutes. Thank you so much for your generous hospitality.
Highly recommended."
8150045,47797420,2015-09-21,23012582,Euiran,My husband and I very much enjoyed a 7 night stay at this amazing studio. It was very clean with everything we need. The sofa bed was just as cosy as the regular bed. We did many touristy things in Seattle during daytime.  So we were thankful for the quietness of the surroundings and the total privacy of the place at the end of each day. Gloria was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend this place.
8150045,49478360,2015-10-04,42272553,Damin,Gloria was very welcoming and easy to approach. She was very nice and quick in responses. She always tried to make sure that I am comfortable during the stay. The studio was just as described. It is spacious enough for a person or two and also very private. The neighborhood is very quiet and feels safe. There is a bus (bus #75) that goes directly to UW and U village. The bus stop is pretty close to the place. I recommend this place.
8150045,53132474,2015-11-05,27503493,Audrey,"Gloria was fantastic! She messaged me before I came to clarify details with me and when I got in, met met at the door to show me around. She was super friendly and welcoming. The studio is EXACTLY as described- the bed was very comfortable and I loved the shower/ bathroom! Very relaxing place. Give Gloria this place 5 stars!"
8150045,53407311,2015-11-08,47681838,Christian,"It was a pleasure to stay in the AirBnB that Gloria offered.  This was my first experience using this service and it was a wonderful one.  Gloria was very easy to get a hold of and responded very promptly to my inquiries.  The space was a private detached studio in her backyard with a comfy sofa bed. 

The space was new, very clean, well maintained, had a nice TV and a cool karaoke system if needed. In a fenced area of her yard you could see chickens roaming which was really neat to watch (don't worry they are silent and make zero noise). 

On arrival, Gloria provided sparkling water and snacks which was a very nice touch.  She also set the temperature a little warmer for me which was nice since I am from Arizona.  She was extremely flexible with check in and check out which was great considering my travel schedule. 

I also am appreciative of her allowing me to borrow her ironing board for the weekend since I love to iron.  I would definitely recommend this host and this space. I would stay there again if the opportunity presented itself again. 

Thank you Gloria for making my trip simple and worry free."
8150045,53838297,2015-11-13,46876198,Jennifer,I was in Seattle for an interview at Seattle Children's Hospital and I'm so glad that I stayed at Gloria's place. I had never been to this area and Gloria was super helpful in providing me with all the information I needed prior to my visit. Her place was also within walking distance of the hospital which was great! The place itself is very nice and well kept. The bathroom was beautiful! Gloria was a great host and really easy to get in touch with. She even gave me a heads up regarding the forecast during my stay and let me borrow her rain jacket! I highly recommend this place.
8150045,54303381,2015-11-17,5709283,Victoria,The description of the studio was very accurate and even went beyond my expectations. Gloria was super nice and was very flexible as far as time to checkin and time to check out. She made sure I was very comfortable during my stay. The room has everything you may need and the location is great if you want to be close to Seattle Children's hospital.
8150045,54640625,2015-11-22,48258532,Jennifer,"This was mine and my friends first experience with Airbnb, and we couldn't be more delighted!  We felt very welcomed and while our schedules didn't allow for us to interact with Gloria until our checkout, she communicated often, made sure we were comfortable, and even provided some snacks and beverages.  The description was entirely accurate and the guest house was especially convenient for traveling around Seattle.  I'd recommend Gloria's guest house to any individual or couple coming through Seattle!"
8150045,54910107,2015-11-25,16311758,Holly,"Gloria is a fantastic host, she and her husband are so friendly, and the studio cottage was perfect for my visit. The fold out bed was very comfortable and I slept very well each night. Excellent set of teas, very clean space, aesthetic remodels in the bathroom and throughout the studio. Will definitely stay here again! Very convenient location for my needs and Gloria is an excellent host."
8150045,55061874,2015-11-27,2005750,Andy,"Gloria was very a quick to respond to all my inquiries about her studio, which was very clean cozy and comfortable and convenient to all my needs .
It was situated in a quaint safe neighborhood with walking and biking trails easily assesible and the freeway within ten minutes."
8150045,55595048,2015-12-02,44676345,Stuart,"She was a very gracious host and I had lots of privacy.  As far as Airbnb rooms go, this is top notch.  Very clean and quiet.

Also, the bed was EXTREMELY comfortable.  Couple with the white noise from the air purifier (which you can turn off if you want), I was out like a light within a couple minutes of putting my head on the pillow.  I'd recommend her to anyone."
8150045,55733026,2015-12-05,25967533,Michelle,"Can't say enough wonderful things about Gloria's place! It's the ideal Airbnb experience in my opinion - totally seperate and private living area yet Gloria was extremely available and responsive if needed. The bathroom is beautiful, the bed is comfy, and there was even a wonderful selection of teas and snacks. The location is walking distance from the children's hospital so perfect if that's where you need to be. It is a more residential area and getting downtown was about a $20 uber or a cheap and easy bus ride, and totally worth it for the accommodations!"
8150045,56620776,2015-12-15,22348617,Erin,"Gloria's piano studio is private, warm and cozy, and complete with everything you could need including kitchen space, modern bathroom, television, snacks and more. Gloria was also extremely accommodating. She communicated early and clearly, considered my needs even before I could, and allowed me to leave my stuff in the apartment after checkout due to a late departure."
8150045,56957334,2015-12-20,14088863,Michelle,"Everything was as advertised.  The neighborhood was great, and the suite was lovely.  There were many kinds of tea and even a plate of chocolates out.  However, there was one major problem;  the hot water in the shower lasted for less then 7 minutes, which is not sufficient for one person, much less two.  We both needed to shower before our event and were unable too. Although it was nice, I would have chosen another location had I known there was not ample hot water."
3489083,16265240,2014-07-24,12332256,Frances,My family and I had a great time staying @ The Post. Facilitiesz were very good and all requests attended to promptly. Staff were friendly and location was perfect. We woulzd definitely recommend Anna's place to others
3489083,22354368,2014-11-04,15236714,Eric,"The apartment at The Post was absolutely perfect. Brand new apartment, with unparalleled views, in a great location. I was able to walk to everything I wanted to see. It's walking distance to Century Link Field, to Pike's Place Market, and to the Space Needle (if you like walking).

It was fully equipped with bathroom essentials, cooking tools, and plenty of blankets and pillows. 

I'll definitely be back here. "
3489083,23186636,2014-11-24,15998768,Bill,"The room was as described and the view was wonderful.  The amenities were very comfortable and the kitchen was well appointed for four.  The balcony on the roof is fantastic.  You can see all of Elliot Bay and into the Puget Sound, and everything from Safeco Field to well past the Ferris Wheel.  We were staying for a Seahawks game, and it was the perfect location, as we were able to walk to Century Link with no problem.  The night before the game, we walked to Pike's Place Market and back.  The shared room on the top floor are awesome with pool tables, large screen TVs, etc.  I highly recommend this location.  I would also recommend parking in the garage across from the Post bldg, toward Pioneer Square.  It was easy and inexpensive.  The only problem we had was trying to cook.  The smoke detector is almost directly over the oven, so it went off twice while we were cooking. This caused the batteries to degrade and the alarm chirped every 30 seconds throughout the night.  There was no phone line in the apartment, so we couldn't report it to the concierge.  I guess sleeping was more important than putting on clothes and going down 8 floors to report is in the lobby.  However, since it is an apartment, I don't think the concierge would have been able to do much more than give me a ladder to take the batteries out.  I would go back and recommend this place to anyone wanting the perfect location in downtown Seattle."
3489083,28475482,2015-03-24,9017294,Bryan,I enjoyed my time at Anna's apartment in Seattle.  Great location and amenities and I would highly recommend it!

284087,958436,2012-02-28,483342,Paul & Dominique,"I made a last minute booking with Suzanne and she was extremely helpful in taking our booking and arranging to meet us. She's easy to communicate with and truly wanted us to have a great time. The apartment is in a great location, a short walk to Capital Hill area or Downtown. The apartment was clean and came fully equipped with what we needed. There are two beds and they are both very comfortable. Overall this is a great place to stay in Seattle, and its nice and cozy to come back to at the end of the day. Definitely recommend it to anyone wishing to stay in downtown Seattle."
284087,993618,2012-03-12,26098,Jonathan,"Nice up-to-date apartment located centrally. The view is indeed nice, and the place is high up so it gets lots of light. It's off the main drag, so you don't hear all the drunkards at night, and typically it's only the drone of the highway in the background. Overall, a great place to stay (though I wouldn't recommend this for groups larger than 4)."
284087,1041333,2012-03-25,1678274,Pad & Jaky,"Suzanne's place is very close to the downtown so we could easily walk down to the big shopping malls. Ditch your car and take a walk please. The apartment was very cozy with a super comfy bed and big windows. We enjoyed our stay in Suzanne's place very much,"
284087,1103200,2012-04-09,1897185,Kevin,"This place is extremely close to downtown Seattle and everything is within walkable distance. The apartment is very cozy and will sleep six with the help of an air bed. Suzanne was extremely helpful with all my last minute questions and requests. Overall, we had an extremely fun stay."
284087,1138699,2012-04-16,2014916,Rob,"Beautiful little apartment with lots of character. Great place in the centre of Seattle and a short walk to Capitol Hill!

Everything was provided. Bottle of wine, chocolate and oat cereal laid out in a small basket on our arrival. Parking was secure. Area felt safe.

Nice addition of speakers to plug our iPods into also. 

Absolute steal for the price. Slept 5 of us comfortably. One addition that we thought of were some blinds or curtains for the lounge (especially if somebody is sleeping in the bed in there).

One major plus was the roof terrace of the apartment block. We had beautiful sunshine all weekend and it was fantastic to go and hang out on the roof terrace overlooking Seattle to have a couple of drinks before going out!"
284087,1200639,2012-04-30,829155,Jessie,"The nest was a perfect spot to stay in Seattle.  Warm, bright and cozy. Suzanne was a great host, friendly and very quick to respond to communications.  4 people were very comfortable in the space.  It was only 3 blocks from our conference downtown and was also ideal for picking up fresh seafood from Pike's market and preparing it in a well-outfitted kitchen!"
284087,1282219,2012-05-14,984880,Rob,"I stayed here with a group to do a hackathon weekend. (guys sitting at their laptops the entire weekend.)  It was sort of a company retreat in the city.

We really liked The Nest because it had wide open spaces and an extra bedroom so people could nap when they needed to. 

Suzanne was a great communicator and the place was as described.  We were happy."
284087,1664975,2012-07-09,2492230,Jessica,"A very bright and comfortable place to stay (perfect for four on a getaway girls' week), a great base for exploring the city (there are delicious restaurants within walking distance), amazing views of the skyline, and all the amenities you would need including a gift basket of treats. I found Suzanne to be very thoughtful, accommodating, and eager to help her guests. A suggestion for people with big cars:  you may find it easier to use the street parking (Suzanne provides a parking pass) instead of squeaking into the spot in the garage. My only complaint would be the noisy neighbor who smokes profusely, but that didn't bother us too much as we were out exploring the city or nestled happily in the living room. "
284087,1719522,2012-07-16,212484,Yossi,This was a wonderful place to stay - it couldn't have been easier or more convenient for us and our toddler. Suzanne was a gracious host.
284087,1752216,2012-07-20,877634,Ashwin And Sina,"We run a start up company and four of us were going to attend a convention at the Seattle convention center.  To get 4 rooms it would have cost us $4,000.  We saved at least $3,000 by renting this apartment instead, and it was great!  The only small thing you may need to be aware of if you are in a similar situation is that the wall between the shower and the hallway is made of opaque glass cubes.  We were two men and two women, so this became kind of a joke.  You can't see anything but some people might feel uncomfortable if you are in a work situation with both men and women.  But the apartment is fantastic and if you need to be at the convention center it is the perfect location.  Suzanne is great!"
284087,1966551,2012-08-13,829833,Kristen,"We had a great stay in the Nest! Suzanne was lovely provided a basket of goodies and all went well. The location cannot be beat and the only thing I would note is that this building is a bit outdated and funky, more than we expected. Would still book here again!"
284087,1992011,2012-08-15,1333567,Jesse,"I and three colleagues decided to stay at Suzanne's place in lieu of a standard hotel while attending a conference, and we have to say that it was definitely the right decision. The Nest was incredibly convenient, being located immediately next to the convention center, and extraordinarily pleasant: the view was lovely, the space large, each of us got our own bed (well, in one case a very, very comfy couch) and all in all we couldn't have asked for more. Should I ever have to travel to Seattle on business again I wouldn't think twice before booking the same space. Love it."
284087,2176123,2012-09-03,632745,Isaac,"Everything about our stay at Suzanne's place was great. My friends and I stayed there for a weekend video game conference over memorial day, and it's proximity to the convention center made it the perfect place to just go have an inexpensive home made lunch, and to just use as a launch pad/meeting place in between events and activities over the weekend. It was clean, cozy and included a covered parking spot."
284087,2389127,2012-09-24,2719479,Richard,Enjoyed staying at The Nest while in Seattle. It was comfortable and better then sterile hotel rooms. Everything we needed was supplied including local information and the off street parking was a bonus.  Not far to the local coffee shops. Thanks for sharing you apartment with us.
284087,2561561,2012-10-09,2787632,Taylor,"Feels like a home tucked away in Seattle. It's easy to get to, easy to walk downtown and capitol hill (which is great.) Suzanne is easy to communicate with and her directions getting in and out of the house are very clear (which is needed, because there are a few steps!) Only downside is the building smells like smoke in the hallways. If you're sensitive to that it might bug you. HOWEVER the apartment doesn't smell like it at all, and it's totally clean, so once you're in, you are in the clear. Thanks Suzanne!"
284087,2655218,2012-10-19,1502372,John,"Suzanne's place was clean, cozy and convenient.  A two minute walk, if that, to the convention center.  Perfect."
284087,3034518,2012-12-06,2524340,Richard,"Ok, so ""The Nest"" is exactly as described, meaning that:

1) The location was great - everything you need to do in downtown is well within walking distance, and there were plenty of restaurants and shops to keep one occupied. Additionally, public transport (buses, the LINK light rail from the airport, etc...) were easy to get to too!

2) The condo itself was fantastic  - don't need to bring anything except your toiletries! 

3) Suzanne (the Host) was good - we actually didn't converse much at all (before, during, and after our stay), which (when you think of it) is a good thing (it means the pre-arrival instructions where great, that nothing on our end went ""wrong"", and that she didn't find the need to ""bother"" us unexpectedly or needlessly during our stay). However, of the few interactions we did have overall, they were all very pleasant!

What can I say... will be staying here again when I'm up in Seattle next!"
284087,3392299,2013-01-22,579253,Leah,"Great place to stay. It is cute and conveniently located in downtown Seattle.
"
284087,3875795,2013-03-24,4153405,Dan,"We had a great time at Suzanne. The Nest is right downtown, 10 min walk from the waterfront and 5 min from the Westlake Light Rail station (to the airport). The apartment is comfortable and clean. The kitchen is fully equipped and Suzanne posted recycling instructions for those of us who are not from the area. Internet worked fine. Suzanne was easy to communicate with, and we were lucky that Suzanne was flexible and the Nest was available for more days than the original reservation. Suzanne is easy to communicate with, and the instructions that she posted are clear and helpful. Overall a great experience, thank you Suzanne!"
284087,3997405,2013-04-02,4862187,Richard,"This is a lovely place that served our needs quite well for 4 people. Seattle is a very eco-conscious city, which I think is wonderful. The mass transit system is great, for this particular trip we didn't even need to use it since everything for us was within walking distance. Enjoyed having the larger shelf on the side of the tub that allows placement of various bath items. The Nest is pretty much as pictured, it now has a washer/dryer combo which was also convenient to have. The night-time skyline is wonderful to (email hidden) stayed in various hotels in Seattle before but was never able to appreciate the Seattle skyline like I was able to at The Nest. Suzanne is a friendly and excellent host, we enjoyed our stay immensely, thank you!"
284087,4242305,2013-04-22,4399288,Chris,"The Nest is a great place to stay, especially if you are attending a conference at the convention center. The apartment itself is comfortable, clean, and cozy. Suzanne leaves a nice basket for your arrival, and is very communicative over text or email. Highly recommended."
284087,4526950,2013-05-11,3617554,Dick,We were a party of 4 attending a meeting at the convention center.  The Nest was extremely convenient and comfortable although one of the group slept on the couch.   We had to make due with 2 keys for 4 people but it did not turn out to be a problem.  At the end of the day the Nest worked well for the group and I would rent it again if there was a need.
284087,4964078,2013-06-04,1152144,Meredith,"We stayed at Suzanne's apartment for a weekend with two couples looking to enjoy and explore the Seattle area.  The apartment was very clean and had all the basics covered.  She left us a nice welcome basket and two bottles of wine.  The apartment is a wonderful location, just a few blocks from Capitol Hill and probably half mile to the waterfront and the market.  Also just a few blocks from the link train which brings you directly from the airport.  We had a great time and hope to be back!"
284087,5022917,2013-06-08,6245442,Michael,"We had a lovely stay in Seattle, at the ""nest"".  The location was great, the facilities and layout were fine, and we felt very much at home.  We would hope to stay there again, on our next visit to Seattle."
284087,5672351,2013-07-11,4086611,Andreas,"Great place to stay. Right in the middle of the city, especially if you need to be at the WA State Conference Center for a trade show. Very clean. Suzanne is responsive and a pleasant host. Nice little touches were very much appreciated, such as the bottle of wine that was awaiting us at arrival. "
284087,6846133,2013-08-27,6656083,Mj,"Suzanne welcomed us to her charming apartment with a lovely gift basket and arranged for us to leave our considerable luggage in the apartment while it was being cleaned.  The main living space was flooded with sunlight and we were thrilled with the convenient location to the Paramount Theater where my room-mate and I were playing a week long engagement. We walked everywhere, including many trips to the Public Market where we bought fresh fish home to enjoy.  After a year on tour in hotels, having a kitchen was a treat.
Our bedrooms were comfortable and everything is as depicted. 
Suzanne responded promptly to our booking inquiry and subsequent questions. 
We had a wonderful stay in this Seattle nest."
284087,7163106,2013-09-09,4086678,Jennifer,"My stay at The Nest was very nice. Easy access to Capitol Hill and Downtown. Perfect location! The apartment is exactly as described. Clean and tidy. It was well stocked with kitchen and bathroom items, and  was decorated with comfortable furnishings. The gift basket with wine was a very nice touch and welcomed after a long travel day. I wish I would have had a chance to enjoy the rooftop courtyard... maybe next time. The bar around the corner Rumba has excellent food and drinks. "
284087,7363885,2013-09-17,7418662,Janet,"Great place to stay in Seattle. Very central, well equipped, wifi excellent and excellent welcome basket."
284087,7741504,2013-10-01,2494296,Eric,"Location was great, apartment was cozy and had everything we needed. Suzanne was very respnsive to messages during stay and very accommodating. Thanks."
284087,8007678,2013-10-12,2949578,Darrell,Very clean place in a wonderful location. Within walking distance to many attractions.
284087,8404776,2013-10-29,7511698,Stacy,"Great location, cozy apartment and very accommodating host! Would recommend to anyone visiting the area!
"
284087,8538618,2013-11-04,769426,Nathan,"Suzanne's place was perfect.  Check in/out was simple and painless.  All accommodations were just as explained and pictured.  The condo is located in a quiet location, but very close to lots of local attractions.  I would definitely stay here again when visiting Seattle."
284087,9343520,2013-12-23,9244484,Andrew,"Staying at the Nest was PERFECT. Apartment had everything we needed, location for the convention center was a dream, check in/out was easy peasy and it was a tremendous value for 3 people. Hard to overstate how nice it is having 2 bedrooms."
284087,9964884,2014-01-21,3221481,Megan,The Nest was the perfect apartment for my friends and I. It slept 4 people comfortably and was very cozy. The location could not be more perfect. It's a ten min walk to Pike's Market and an even shorter walk to tons of shopping and restaurants. The key pick up and drop off was also super easy. I would definitely recommend this place!
284087,10027677,2014-01-26,1028368,Rod,"Great space, great host, and an even better location.  Its close to everything.  "
284087,10673617,2014-03-03,8036769,Artis,"This was my first Air B n B experience and - wow! The apartment was perfect, very cozy and warm. Suzanne left a lovely basket with a bottle of wine and snacks, and there was a very generous coffee and tea supply. The apartment is right next to the convention center, which was ideal for us. I can't say enough good things about the experience. "
284087,11989011,2014-04-21,8200422,Angela,"Our stay at the Nest was an absolute delight! The Nest is well-appointed in every way--kitchen is stocked up with cooking supplies, tea, coffee, spices and other kitchen basics; the bedrooms are spacious and the beds are so comfortable; the bathroom is renovated; the living room is perfect for hanging out and cozying up with a cup of tea. The location is excellent, just a couple of blocks from all the bustle of downtown, Pike Place Market, Link and bus lines, etc. We had a group of 4 adults and there was plenty of room for everyone. Suzanne is truly a pleasure to work with--accommodated our needs and made our stay incredibly easy and comfortable. I highly recommend this place and will absolutely try to stay here again in the future!"
284087,13235153,2014-05-23,9201574,Giles,"A fantastic place to stay, thanks Suzanne for making the nest available to us, and for being so helpful. The apartment offers a warm welcome as you walk in and was a wonderful place to relax at the end of a day walking the hills of Seattle. The position was great, just a few blocks from the shops, monorail and the market. Our stay in Seattle was made better by staying in this great apartment."
284087,13629896,2014-06-01,14142607,Lantien,"Great location for easy walking to pike street market, downtown stores and restaurants, and especially the convention center.  We appreciated the parking garage space, kitchen amenities (coffee and welcome basket!), cozy living room, comfortable beds, nice bath, nice views.  5 of us lived there for 3 nights and enjoyed having this Home away from our homes.  Suzanne very kind, communicative, easy check in and out.  "
284087,14187645,2014-06-14,14607360,Lois,She was pleasant and her directions were easy to follow.  Her directions were thorough. We enjoyed our stay. Thanks again.
284087,14385702,2014-06-18,4900590,Mike,"nice place, close to freeway can be a little noisy but is close to downtown in good neighborhood.  Suzanne is very accommodating and nice utensils in the kitchen!"
284087,15983433,2014-07-19,5608736,Eric,"Terrific place to stay, very spacious and comfortable. Suzanne makes all the logistics incredibly easy. The apartment is really well located - highly recommended!"
284087,16072387,2014-07-22,11192277,Ashley,Our stay in the Nest was very cozy and convenient! We got a little taste of what it would be like to live in Seattle! Suzanne is a great host!
284087,16447475,2014-07-28,9314205,Shelley,We enjoyed our stay at the Nest very much!  Comfy beds and all the  necessities in a great location.  
284087,16883514,2014-08-04,9639997,Carol,"Apartment was exactly as described and was within walking distance to all of central Seattle.
A very comfortable solution for staying in Seattle."
284087,17141014,2014-08-08,9145225,Amy,"We enjoyed our stay in the Nest in the Heart of the City and found the location great for walking around. It was easy to find the key and let our selves into the building upon arrival.  We felt safe in the building and neighborhood.  I'm not used to sleeping with windows open without screens so we kept windows closed at night making the apartment warm.  The fans helped some.  Our only disappointment was that both the washer and dryer in the apartment were broken, along with 2 of the 4 washers in the stifeling 2nd floor laundry room.   We planned on doing a load or two of laundry each night as this stop was our midway point in our vacation and we were unable to do that.  "
284087,17750668,2014-08-17,16092421,Karine,"Hôte très disponible.  Cependant, pas de laveuse ni sécheuse disponibles dans l'appartement tel que prévu.  Appartement bien situé mais très bruyant, d'autant plus qu'il n'y a pas d'air climatisé et qu'il faut donc garder les fenêtres ouvertes.  Finalement, il n'y a pas de moustiquaires aux fenêtres de cet appartement au 11e étage, ce qui rend cet appartement non sécuritaire pour les familles avec enfants."
284087,19027336,2014-09-05,2598239,Harold,Great host.  All was as described.  Really handy to the convention center.  Stay went well.
284087,20080915,2014-09-23,9035000,Becky,"There is good reason why Suzanne's ""Nest"" deserves five stars:

1) The location is great (especially for those who want to hit the major Seattle attractions - Pike Place, the Space Needle, Chihuly glass garden, Pioneer Square, etc.) 2) The condo is clean, cozy and well furnished - our party of four was very comfortable in terms of sleeping arrangements and storage space. 3) The directions to access the condo were very specific - even after a long journey to get to Seattle, it was a breeze to find the unit and settle in. 4) The little details (welcome basket, well stocked pantry, abundance of clean linens), truly made us feel at home during our stay.

The only downside I can think of is that this was my first experience with Airbnb and I'm afraid it may have set the bar too high!"
284087,20335302,2014-09-28,17821924,William,"We weren't able to check in at 4 p.m. (no key in lockbox), and were unable to reach host by phone. Luckily, this little wrinkle sorted itself out in about an hour, during which we worried while we had a beer at a nearby brew pub.

The location is great for leaving the car in the parking lot. 

No mention in the description about the noise from the freeway. Earplugs are essential."
284087,21196459,2014-10-13,2457675,Jeff,"Location was great, super close to the convention center, whichw as exactly where we wanted to be. Really wish there had been fewer people smoking out front and in the halls, but that is out of the hosts control."
284087,21979164,2014-10-27,2947136,Rania,"We had a wonderful time at the nest.  Suzanne was quick to respond, everything was so easy and directions very clear.  We were visiting Seattle for a conference and you really can't beat the location.  Suzanne had lots of tea and extra bedding which was super handy.  Beds very comfy - the place immediately feels like home as you step in.  This is where we're staying next year.  "
284087,22758517,2014-11-14,8406014,Victor,"We had a really nice time in Seattle at The Nest. Although we were there for a business travel, we felt like home thanks to the hospitality and kindness of our host. 
Thanks Suzanne!"
284087,25089283,2015-01-06,12121374,Tom,"Although our hostess wasn't home when we arrived, she had left thorough and simple instructions for access.  She also left us a ""welcome basket"" of goodies. Suzanne was also easily reached by phone.  The concierge was also helpful, from time to time. The apartment was warm, comfy and convenient to everything, as described.
   A lovely experience in Seattle. Thanks, Suzanne.
             Tom and Pat from Vermont."
284087,28516099,2015-03-25,11899897,Bethany,"I was in Seattle for a conference Downtown and stayed at the Nest with my coworker and partner, and we had a wonderful stay and experience! Suzanne was quickly available for any questions and gave us some great recommendations. We were only a 5 minute walk from the conference hotel, and it was such a bonus to be able to go ""home"" at the end of the day to a very comfortable apartment instead of back to a hotel room. Suzanne left a thoughtful welcome basket and lots of maps and info of things to do in Seattle. The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed, although most of the time we ended up eating out since there are so many options! Location was perfect - walkable distance to Pike's Market, the Seattle Center, Capitol Hill and University neighborhoods, and a 10 or so minute walk to the Light Rail station connecting you to the airport. So many coffee shops and eateries in just a few blocks of the apartment, and even more excellent choices if you're up for a longer walk. Very comfortable, convenient, and highly recommended. Thanks for a great stay! "
284087,28773060,2015-03-30,16298722,Scott,"The apartment was clean and organized when we arrived, and the instructions in the house manual explained everything clearly. Suzanne made sure we had everything we needed, and even left a nice gift basket for us.

Suzanne responded quickly to any questions we had. I would definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Seattle."
284087,29252460,2015-04-06,4251415,Jia Ling,"The location was exquisite, and the accommodation incredibly comfortable. Plenty of space and what I love most is that its on a street away from the main roads but close enough to merit only minimal noise while being conveniently placed. Everything was wonderfully clean and getting the keys was a bit like a mystery game. Parking spot was great though you might not want to park anything more than a sedan sized car in there, could be a bit of a squeeze.

Great locale and I'll definitely be back again! Didn't meet Suzanne during the trip but she was incredibly communicative and sorted out any questions and issues we had quickly. "
284087,29735917,2015-04-12,11419603,Nic,"The snack and tea baskets were lovely welcoming treats - so unexpected and so very much appreciated. The beds were comfy, plenty of towels and amenities. The rooms were perfectly, centrally located as we needed to be near the convention center and pike place most of the time. We would love to book there again some day!"
284087,30439975,2015-04-22,25822332,Jaime,"Suzanne made us feel truly welcome at The Nest. Upon entering the apartment we were greeted by a basket on the kitchen table that was full of snacks, chocolates, and even wine. The Nest was stocked with nearly everything we might have possibly needed during our stay, and we couldn’t have asked for more. At just steps from the Convention Center, walking distance from points of interest in Downtown and Capitol Hill, and great vistas of the Seattle skyline, The Nest proved to be an excellent location. We will definitely consider staying at The Nest for our next visit to Seattle, and absolutely recommend the listing to any traveler. "
284087,32356385,2015-05-17,30909657,Ben,"I had a great experience in Seattle thanks in part to Suzanne and the Nest. It was a great central location with easy access to Pike Place market, Capitol Hill etc. I'd recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle. "
284087,33659716,2015-05-31,5093135,Grietje,"Everything was easy and convenient, communication, location, the apartments where i stayed with three friends. There was a basket with some essential snacks, tea, coffee and a bottle of wine. The beds were comfortable and the shower good! the only downside was that the apartment is quite noisy day and night as it's right next to the interstate, definitely bring earplugs! "
284087,36925332,2015-07-02,1809814,Ted,"Suzanne's place was great - I wish it weren't so booked up the rest of the summer, else I'd stay there again easily next time I'm in town! 

Centrally located, and just a really nice apartment. Tons of natural light, and really liked the bathroom - comfortable and nice.

Suzanne was very easy to deal with - I never even met her in person, but everything checking in/out was flawless. Thanks Suzanne!"
284087,40306978,2015-07-30,28520593,Michael,The entire stay was great. Nice location. Comfortable apartment.  Suzanne was accessable by text message and readily agreed to a special request.
284087,41187922,2015-08-05,20127907,Max,"We had a great time at the Nest!  It's conveniently located to downtown attractions so we could walk or take transit to most things.  We are family of five and it worked well for us as a home base to see the city.  A couple of kids ended up sharing a bed rather than setting up air mattress provided, which otherwise might have made things a bit cramped for us.  Kitchen was well equipped.  Handy to have washer and dryer in the condo and also parking.  Check in process was easy, and Suzanne left us some snacks and a bottle of wine which was a nice touch!"
284087,43447513,2015-08-19,41298691,Yingchao,Very good
284087,44421156,2015-08-26,2346846,Jeff,"We found the Nest to be just as described. The neighborhood is fairly quiet aside from the noise of the interstate, which made open windows less desirable. Although the days were warm, AC units kept the condo cool. Many restaurants within walking distance and an easy stroll to Pikes Market. Only annoyance was the Wifi's inability to maintain a connection with our devices for very long, but a reset and reconnect was all it took to restore.  I would stay here again."
284087,46587377,2015-09-12,36898959,Bong Cheol,"Good place to stay.  Very good location for someone attending a meeting at Washington convention center. However, it is noisy a little bit. For me earlplugs were very helpful. "
284087,47838819,2015-09-21,3562249,Jerome,"The Nest was just like the description, great location and comfort beyond expectations. Suzanne made everything so that we feel just like at home. "
284087,49002392,2015-09-30,27175259,Cliff,"We really enjoyed our time at the Nest. My friends and I were in town for a conference at the Convention Center and this was absolutely the best location--just steps away from the main entrance.  The space was clean and welcoming, and the description in the listing was accurate. Suzanne left us a welcome basket with goodies and snacks, which definitely came in handy after long days at a conference.  The instructions for check-in were clear and easy to follow, and check-out was painless and easy. Overall an excellent experience!"
284087,49784377,2015-10-06,40831941,Kyle,"We had a great time in Seattle, The Nest was in a very central location and convenient for the trip. Host was excellent. Thanks Suzanne!"
284087,50365214,2015-10-11,542857,Lauren,"The ""Nest"" was great, very comfortable, great location, the unit has everything you could possibly need for a long weekend in Seattle :)"

284087,53956167,2015-11-15,2710849,Alycia,"Had a great stay at the Nest. I was in town for a conference at the convention center, so the location was perfect. Everything I needed was within walking distance. The furniture was very comfortable, and I appreciated the well-stocked kitchen and bathroom. Suzanne was easy to get a hold of with questions. I would definitely recommend this place. "

284087,57371690,2015-12-25,47420262,Yueyi,We had a great week at the Nest. The cottage was lovely and cozy. We love sitting on the couch listening to music and reading books. Great experience!
6202603,32008544,2015-05-12,32514694,Karina,"Stayed here with two of my friends during a last minute trip to seattle. Nice, clean and well located apartment in the fremont area. Close to some great restaurants including The Dish, amazing breakfast! We were only 20 minutes away from the space needle. Molly is a super nice accommodating host! She even left us trial size toiletries for us to use!"
6202603,32581881,2015-05-19,13281391,Rosa,"I really enjoyed staying in Molly's 1 bedroom apartment. It was my first time in Seattle and it could not have been better! The apartment was in an adorable neighborhood, quick walk to the Seattle troll and pretty easy to get astound, as well as a cute Main Street with lots of restaurants. It was extremely clean and well kept, as well as very nicely decorated. 
Communication was great, simple and easy and she left us a bottle of wine to enjoy when we got there! I would definitely stay again. "
6202603,33141929,2015-05-25,5798034,Bethany,We had a great stay! Apartment was 10-15 minute walk from everything in Fremont and close to the bus line (5) to downtown. Molly was very helpful and gracious. Bed was super soft and place was decorated well.  
6202603,35306093,2015-06-17,31869346,Elizabeth,"Molly's home very comfortable! She was very accommodating for late arrival. The neighborhood was perfect, right by the Troll Bridge and Gas Works Park! Walking distance to some fun restaurants. Quiet street made for a peaceful sleep. Would definitely recommend!!"
6202603,35806381,2015-06-22,6724151,Joe,"Communications with Molly were great and the apartment was as described.  Comfortable bed, great water pressure for a hot shower after a long day of walking.  Can not the (email hidden) and drinks are just around the corner.  Would stay there again."
6202603,36406360,2015-06-28,1840717,Ryan,Molly's place was located close to everything! It was on a quiet street and had easy parking. We had a great time and it was a nice place to stay for a few days in Seattle!
6202603,38121509,2015-07-13,148017,Vivienne,"Nice apartment, close to Gasworks park, short walks to Freemont spots, convenient buses to the city and tourist spots. Only drawbacks, no outdoor area to sit or ability to open windows and not feel ""shut in"". I also prefer a normal bed that's made. "
6202603,39933818,2015-07-27,11124827,Mehgan,"My boyfriend and I had a great stay at Molly's. Her place was in a nice, quiet neighborhood with a few good restaurants close by. It was also nice to wake up and run along the water. There was a great little spot we found to lay in the grass and watch all the boats with views of the entire Seattle skyline very close by to her place. She was very responsive to our questions and made everything easy. Would stay here again! Great value"
6202603,42397338,2015-08-13,35017611,Billie Jean,Great little apartment in an awesome neighborhood. Walking distance to great bars and coffee shops and Molly was very accommodating and easy to work with. She even had baby lotion available for our son! Would definitely stay here again!
6202603,45674729,2015-09-05,19137478,Eileen,"Molly's apartment was in a great location, close to some great restaurants and breweries. Very easy to get downtown Seattle by bus. Molly made everything easy, I would definitely recommend!"

6780615,38218266,2015-07-13,560455,Andre,Pleasant stay in Andrea's place.  Everything appeared to be brand new and was absolutely as described.   Neighborhood and area convenient to both downtown and Magnolia village.  Plenty of on street parking.
6780615,38760484,2015-07-18,31601138,Mike,"Andrea's apartment in Magnolia is immaculate and inviting.  It had all the comforts of home, and she was a charming, gracious host.  We never parked more than 20 steps from the front door.  Hulu and Netflix are available on her newer Samsung flat screen TV, although no cable/local broadcast stations are.  Ask her to tell you about her time living with her family on a boat in the Puget Sound.  When her daughter practiced the cello, orcas followed the boat.  Interesting woman."
6780615,40604640,2015-08-01,35820702,Matilde,"El departamento aunque pequeño tiene una excelente distribución de espacio, cocina grande y abierta para departir, el sofá de la sala amplio y cómodo (quizá yo incluiría un sillón individual), baño de buen tamaño y el cuarto, aunque pequeño, tiene suficiente espacio para guardar las maletas y la ropa de forma que se vea ordenado. Además, por la simpleza de los objetos y muebles del departamento se trata de un espacio fácil de mantener limpio y en orden, más cuando Andrea tiene todos los utilensilios necesarios para facilitar esa tarea.
Algo que llamó nuestra atención es que todo, desde las toallas hasta las ollas para cocinar, parecía nuevo, nada está descompuesto o a medio funcionar y siempre que algo se nos ofreció, lo encontramos. 
La ubicación del departamento resultó también muy conveniente, sin estar en el barullo del centro está a 15 minutos en autobus, el cual se toma a 30 mts del departamento. La zona además es muy agradable para caminar y conocer. Nosotros disfrutamos especialmente el Discovery Park.
En cuanto a la asistencia, Andrea, sin ser persistente, estuvo al pendiente de que estuviéramos bien. Unos días antes de nuestra llegada me envió una serie de recomendaciones sobre el departamento, la zona y la ciudad de Seattle que nos fueron muy útiles para ubicarnos y acomodarnos rápidamente. Su disposición y rapidez para dar respuesta a dudas permite que uno se sienta bien recibido. Para nosotros fue nuestra primera experiencia a través de Airbnb y tanto por su servicio, como por las condiciones del departamento, no dudaríamos en repetirla. El trato fue siempre muy agradable. Gracias"
6780615,41972222,2015-08-10,35791487,Bergit,"Andrea ist eine ausgezeichnete Gastgeberin. Sie hat uns mit allen wichtigen Informationen versorgt. Die Kommunikation während unseres Aufenthalt hat funktioniert.
Das Appartement ist sehr schön gelegen, überaus sauber, komplett ausgestattet und bot ausreichend Platz für 4 Personen (2 Erwachsene + 2 Kinder) Parkmöglichkeiten vor dem Haus waren jederzeit vorhanden. Wir würden es jederzeit wieder wählen."
6780615,43287092,2015-08-18,39631367,Autie,"Thanks for the great apartment.  We had an awesome time in Seattle and this was the perfect location to start all our adventures.   Parking was easy and very close.  The next time we are in Seattle we will make sure to check in with you first to see if it is available.  
Thanks again"
6780615,44026547,2015-08-23,40712201,Lucy,The apartment was lovely!  Would definitely stay there again!
6780615,44709810,2015-08-28,300723,Ben,"Great place and great host, Andrea was very attentive in checking if everything was okay. Place was very clean and nice looking, Andrea also makes it a point to completely replace the pillows for every guest so you are sure its super clean."
6780615,49616022,2015-10-05,24286845,Rachel,"The apartment was just as described, a lovely clean modern space in a peaceful area, with easy street parking. There had obviously been a lot of thought put into exactly what guests would need, even down to the last kitchen utensil and we really appreciated how easy that made everything. Andrea was responsive and super helpful too. We enjoyed the Netflix a little too much and now really miss it! Would recommend heartily. "
6780615,50994695,2015-10-16,26595199,Jolee,"I rented Andrea's place for my parents who were visiting from Minnesota.  We live in Magnolia, so it was very convenient for us to have them staying in the neighborhood.  The apartment was modern, clean and fully equipped with everything a traveler could need.  Andrea was not there to greet us, which was completely fine with us.  She was very responsive to emails/texts and thorough in her welcoming information.  Will definitely use Andrea's place again when others may visit!!  Thanks, Andrea."
6780615,51563654,2015-10-21,18220985,Sheena,"We absolutely LOVED Andrea's place! It was like our home away from home. We almost felt like we lived there just because it was so comfortable. By the 2nd day, it felt like we had been there for 5 days! Parking! What can I say? FREE! That was an absolute plus! Saved us so much money compared to if we were to have stayed at a hotel. The yen location was about 15-20 min drive to most of the places we wanted to go to. It was nice to not stay in the the city where it's so busy. The next time we come back to Seattle, we will definitely be staying here again!"
6780615,54994209,2015-11-27,7737786,Andrea,"We had a wonderful few days at Andrea's apartment in Magnolia. We were visiting family who live nearby, so the location was perfect for us. Andrea provided everything we needed, and prepared us for arrival perfectly.
"
6780615,57264878,2015-12-23,37135421,Erik,"Andrea was wonderful!

We had a small mixup of information when we first arrived at her place. However, Andrea couldn't have been more helpful! I would absolutely stay at her place again. After Andrea settled our initial mixup my girlfriend and I got right to feeling at home. Her place is very pretty and is easy to feel at home. It also has a really cool view and a bus stop just steps away :) 

Thanks Andrea! "
7207641,41158735,2015-08-04,38806623,Ming-Tsan,"Joe and Anna are very friendly. They made us feel very well welcomed and comfortable. 
The house is gorgeous and spacious with newly upgraded decorations and furniture. Everything is prepared really well with thoughts. 
The location is awesome with very convenient access to downtown area with a lot of good restaurants, coffee shop and grocery stores.
Overall, it was an extraordinary experience and I highly recommend this house to everyone. "

7207641,45485315,2015-09-03,39249994,Nils,Very clean and organized.  The hosts provided clear answers to a number of anticipated questions.  Fantastic location--across the street from recreation area and just a few blocks from shops/eats.  Would stay again.
4430381,31089518,2015-05-01,32130332,Derek,The reservation was canceled 14 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4430381,52703424,2015-11-01,38435152,Will,"Great communication before our trip. Nothing seemed too much trouble. In Seattle for a conference and hate hotels - this place was perfect - about 20 minute walk from downtown and conference centre, amazing views over the city from the top apartment. Clean, tidy and had everything you need for a stay!"
4430381,57066135,2015-12-21,50536671,Chris,The neighborhood was great for visiting Seattle.  Enjoyed our stay and had everything we needed.
6610942,40406440,2015-07-30,22961129,Jennifer,"Marco's place was amazing! As a host, he was helpful, welcoming and communicated well with us! The light rail train station was very close by and made commuting into downtown a breeze! Marco's place was bright, clean and spacious. He has the cutest chocolate lab in the world and we highly recommend staying in his suite!! "
6610942,40782101,2015-08-02,13976065,Raegan,"Marco made our stay in Seattle absolutely fantastic! We loved having the large, private suite throughout our stay, and the location is great. Since Marco is new to Airbnb, he was very open to any suggestions on the space and was so sweet to accommodate right away! My husband had his luggage lost by the airlines, and Marco was so kind to offer to help in any way he could, and even got us an iron. I'd recommend him to anyone looking to stay in Seattle!"
6610942,41042436,2015-08-03,22332223,Keith S,"Marco had great communication leading up to our stay. Great location with lots of parking, easy to find. Great room, great place to stay and make base for a visit to Seattle."
6610942,46293730,2015-09-09,40229848,AnJuanna,"Great location! We were able to explore the surrounding communities and get back to the city in no time. Marco was friendly and made us feel welcome and very comfortable. I was pleasantly surprised by the number of amenities (iron, fridge, microwave, towels and extra blankets)."
6610942,46608716,2015-09-12,40296782,Randy,"Marco made us feel very welcome!  The room was exactly as described and very clean.  The space had a private entrance which was very nice because we could come and go easily.  Extra towels were provided along with plates, bowls and coffee.  Shampoo and conditioner were also provided.  Marco was very helpful whenever we needed assistance.

The neighborhood was nice and the Link Light Rail was only a five to ten minute walk from the house.  This location is great if you do not have a car because downtown Seattle is only a ten minute train ride away.  We ate at Pippy's Cafe for lunch and did yoga at Yoga on Beacon.  Both places are along Beacon Avenue.  

I highly recommend this place.  "
6610942,46913012,2015-09-14,5785484,Katie,The space was very cute and clean and close to the action downtown. Marco was very flexible and provided several suggestions of places to eat. Cute dog too! :)  Would for sure go back. 
6610942,47296344,2015-09-17,182610,Sarah,"Very welcoming and good communication as we approached the arrival date. Met us at the house and showed us around.  It's a fun eclectic house in a great neighborhood.  The space was very attractive and comfortable, just as shown. Fridge and micro and they are set up for K-cups if you like that, but there's a wonderful coffeeshop, The Victrola, two blocks away.
Location is impeccable.  Three blocks from light rail and within 2 blocks of great little Italian, Mexican, and Filipino places.  Yoga on Beacon right there too.
Marco checked in on us via text after our first night to see if we needed anything and if we were comfortable."
6610942,47984691,2015-09-22,40634691,Carin,"Marco is a perfect host. He gave me all the information I needed about the place and made me feel welcome. He immediately acted on a couple of my suggestions to making it even more comfortable. The room is very quiet and the neighborhood pleasant. I highly recommend Marco and would stay there again.   
Carin"
6610942,48538349,2015-09-27,31352001,Yunan,"Great stay, we enjoyed the private space and convenient location. Marco was very helpful, a wonderful host. Highly recommend and would book his place again next time when we are in Seattle!"
6610942,48834809,2015-09-28,44858774,Ray,"Marco was great!  Always quick with a response and made it very easy to find our way to the room.  Lovely place, wish we could have stayed longer.  The Victrola coffee down the street was a plus.  Would stay again!"
6610942,48924356,2015-09-29,21894274,Inga,"My friend and I stayed at Marco's for one night so we didn't have to commute after a show at the SoDo Showbox. It was very conveniently located. The studio was nicely decorated and very clean. The bed was super comfortable and the room was quiet, so we were able to achieve good recovery sleep. Marco was friendly and he offered us a later checkout. The neighborhood is very beautiful and beacon hill restaurant are only a couple blocks away. I recommend staying at Marco's!"
6610942,52220535,2015-10-27,32722714,J. Elaine,"Marco's place is absolutely beautiful. As I walked past the zen garden and palm trees to find the separate en suite at the back of the house, it was exactly as pictured and even more. I stayed for a month while working downtown and I loved it. I was amazed that the bed was an extremely comfortable Tempurpedic mattress. The room and bathroom were very clean. Communicating with him was very easy and simple thru texts and he would always respond quickly. The location is so close to the light rail and the views from Beacon Hill are gorgeous. So close to several parks like Jefferson Park or Seward Park. It's a safe, quiet neighborhood.  I biked every day to downtown and this place is surrounded with bike paths so it's a wonderful area to have a bike. If you want a place to stay that is very close to downtown without feeling stuck in the city, I would highly recommend this private large en suite. "
6610942,54333311,2015-11-18,47729264,Michaelene,The space was exactly as described.  Marco is very accommodating.
6610942,57152107,2015-12-22,50074928,Jiawen,"Clean and Convenience place, Quiet environment and nice neighborhood, close by No 36,60 bus stop, and Light Rail station(Beacon hill), really good for traveler that without car, really easy to get to any place in Seattle.
房間非常乾淨，交通也很方便，住在這裏可以不用開車，運用公共交通工具也能方便到達西雅圖很多的景點。社區也非常方便，附近有咖啡廳和吃飯的地方，還有超商和加油站，全都可以5分鐘步行達到。"
2069917,26339074,2015-02-09,27133546,Nifemi,My first time with AirBnB and i am glad it was with Anna. Extremely clear instructions and an awesome space. Very good host and very good location.
2069917,27330678,2015-03-02,26380537,Laiza,"She send a welcome text message the day I arrived. Then another text during the week hopping everything was good. I asked for a late check out, because I changed my plans and my flight was almost at midnight. Anna told me that I only could stay until 1pm. "
2069917,28151782,2015-03-18,10377075,John,"The place was clean and spacious, conveniently located, and close to good restaurants, bars, and coffee shops.  The bed was comfortable, the bathtub was large, the kitchen had plenty of cookware and flatware.  Highly recommended!"
2069917,28447549,2015-03-23,10377075,John,"Awesome little place in a great location.  Close to freeway and bus lines, good food and coffee just up the street.  The place was clean, quiet, and comfortable.  Anna was very communicative via text and answered all questions in a timely manner."
2069917,29353562,2015-04-06,3894682,Chris,Anna was an excellent host and the apartment was exactly what I was looking for. Would highly recommend a stay with her.
2069917,34799010,2015-06-12,7034085,Sarah,"If you read one and only one section in this review, it should be the part about the coffee table because it's the only negative aspect. Everything else about the property was absolutely perfect, and I would definitely want to stay here again!

BEWARE THE GLASS COFFEE TABLE!!!!
The clear glass coffee table in the living room is a HUGE safety hazard, so shins beware!!! If it were my own property and I knew to watch out for it instinctively, it would be one thing. But when I'm a guest in a brand new place and my eye/mind is not trained to steer clear of the invisible thing in the middle of the floor, all roads lead to badly bruised shins. Like mine. I think I can understand where Anna's request to not rearrange furniture comes from - people wanting to move the coffee table to a safer location!

PROPERTY EXACTLY AS SHOWN
The property looks exactly as photographed which is nice. There is plenty of space. It was just me so I had my own cove and felt like I lived here - which I love.

BEST LOCATION
I've been to Seattle before and stayed in Belltown, which is great location for the market, but this time I needed to be a bit out of the hubbub. This was great because there was still enough around without having to be downtown.

The street is super cute with little houses and quaint walkways that lead from street/sidewalk to porch. All parking and such is ""hidden"" in back streets, which adds to the curb appeal.

There is definitely a LOT of street noise, even late in the evening on a weeknight (Tuesday). It's fine for me personally because I can sleep through all and anything, but I could imagine that others may want to know it beforehand.

But then again, that's the price you pay for being just steps away from cool restaurants. A quick Yelp search, which I use nearly religiously, told me that all the highly-rated places are just a block away. I tried out Tippe & Drague Alehouse which was amazing for a craft beer lover like myself. So many craft beers on tap with Trivia to boot (on Tuesdays). Less than 5 minutes away, too! I also tried Victrola coffee shop which was totally perfect - I could have stayed there and worked on my computer all day. And I made my way to Fresh Flours around the corner from the train station, too. Also cute to just pop in, but less cozy if you want to sit somewhere a while.

NO A/C
There's no A/C, which I guess I either read and forgot or never read between the lines to figure out. It was quite warm during my stay so it was definitely hot in the property! I didn't find the fan tucked away in the front close until the second day. "
2069917,35372007,2015-06-18,29500484,Alex,"Prompt communication with the host. Spacious and very clean  1 bdrm on a second floor with all standard features on a busy street. Nice wide soft bed. Wi-Fi is available. Public transportation available (bus, trolley bus, city train few blocks away). For travelers with a car - parking is available next to the building. This neighborhood is located off Rt. 5, about 10 min driving by the car from the downtown (with low traffic). We had a good time in Seattle, thanx to Anna, our host."
2069917,37296287,2015-07-06,30410831,Douglas,"This was my first experience and it started out with host being cordial and following up . All seemed great till I arrived and found the place inhabitable. It was so hot , no air conditioning and only a ten inch fan to cool down the whole place. Aside that no screens on the bedroom window. I stayed one night and hardly slept as it was noisy and to hot. I notified the host I could not stay there and she repeated over and over how I should pay attention to the rules. No compassion at all to the situation and no call from host to see what could be done.   "
2069917,38466587,2015-07-15,30469560,Cameron,Great location! Anna was great with fast communication. Thanks for everything!
2069917,40677560,2015-08-01,691878,Ben & Luís,"Anna's place is cute and comfortable for two. The bedroom is a bit noisy but that didn't bother us at all. Very very soft bed. Well located in an up and coming neighborhood, some fun bars and restaurants up the street and good public transport nearby. We just parked the car in the lot, and took buses and light rail everywhere. A $10 uber ride from downtown/capitol hill. Has everything you need, except A/C but the fan and open windows took care of that. Anna is very accommodating and communicative. Very recommended for an affordable stay in Seattle."
2069917,43860626,2015-08-22,40829878,Katie,"The description of the condo was accurate. Anna's initial communication was spot-on, and her response time was quick. The place was clean, welcoming and comfortable. Location was fine: $37 (plus tip) taxi ride from the airport. Light rail is about 6 blocks away. 
Would definitely stay there again! "
2069917,45370339,2015-09-02,25472172,Alena,"Anna responded to my questions very quickly. The listing was accurate and very clean. The train was a short walk away and convenient. The neighborhood was quiet and right next to a park (which I did not end up exploring, but it was nice to see). A very pleasant stay, exactly what I was looking for. "
2069917,47060606,2015-09-15,19701702,David,Anna was very responsive and the place was as described. $10 uber to downtown. Bed was comfortable. It was a bit warm but with the fan provided and a window open we were able to get the temperature we wanted. Really nice place and we would stay here again. 
2069917,48910467,2015-09-29,20364751,Judy,"Easy  access to the light rail for shopping downtown Seattle, and also to the airport.  Enjoyed taking my grandson to the large park nearby.  Also close to coffee shops, local restaurants and grocery store.  Apartment comfortable, and had all the amenities needed in the kitchen for families who wished to cook meals during their stay."

And Anna is always quick to respond if needed.  "
2069917,56208132,2015-12-10,41768143,Mike,Had a great time in Seattle and having this apartment to stay at made it even better. Very close to all essentials and minutes to downtown.
7601333,43185784,2015-08-17,8088621,Felecia,Lauren was really sweet and helpful. Property is in the center of all local attractions which made it easy to find all of Seattle's hot spots.

7601333,46622549,2015-09-12,2528358,Jesse,"Lauren was awesuum--very quick + responsive to all my questions.  Her house was lovely, spacious, clean and light filled + had a nice bkyard.  House stocked with anything you wld need.  Internet fast 
and consistent.  The neighborhood was great.  

Wld def stay here again--thnx Lauren! *"
7601333,48578894,2015-09-27,878207,Leora,We loved this wonderful warm house. Lauren was a great host. The beds were super comfortable and the location was great. 
6018416,33128777,2015-05-25,21447953,Deborah,"Lindsay is the most wonderful Airbnb host I have encountered. She made us feel more like house guests than renters.  The house is gorgeous, including spectacular views from the dining table, deck and master bedroom. The pictures do not do it justice.  Great location and easy drive to downtown Seattle, ferry to Bainbridge, hiking in the Cascades.  Would love to find similar arrangements in other cities I plan on visiting. "
6018416,34955361,2015-06-14,14813381,Kathy,"We travel via ABB quite often and have had many great experiences. Our stay at Lindsay's Sunset Hill View Craftsman is by far the most outstanding yet! The home sits in Ballard, atop the bluff with an amazing view of the marina and Puget Sound. The home offers this beautiful view from just about every part of the house and property. We were in Seattle for my daughter's college graduation. We needed a home with three bedrooms and baths and a kitchen fit for preparing a graduation dinner. We got this and so much more! The beds are over-the-top comfortable; Lindsay's attention to bedding detail set the tone for a great night sleep. Thank you so much for that, Lindsay! The kitchen was completely stocked with every needed tool, was spacious, and bright. We were able to create a celebration dinner to be remembered. Lindsay's home exudes peacefulness. It was a weekend of morning coffee and cribbage on the deck, afternoon walks to the many local spots, and evenings back on the deck or in the hot tub. Lindsay made it clear she wanted us to have a relaxing and enjoyable stay and that is exactly what we did!"
6018416,35655691,2015-06-21,10020128,Courtney,"WOW!  What a wonderful home.  Lindsey was such an accommodating host and made us feel welcome from the beginning.  We ended up arriving early due to our taxi taking half the time google maps said it would but Lindsey was extremely welcoming, inviting us to come on in.  A much needed bottle of wine was left on the table with a nicely made binder of instructions for the house and local places to eat and things to see. 

The house was absolutely beautiful and pictures can not do the view from the deck justice.  My family and I thoroughly enjoyed just hanging out on the deck and spending time with one another. We didn't have a car so that did make it a little difficult to get into the city but it's only a $20 Uber ride or you can get up early on weekday mornings to catch the express bus into downtown.  Even though transportation took a little bit more work on our part we all agreed that staying at Lindsey's house was 100 times better than staying in a hotel in downtown Seattle.  

In the end we all agreed we wish we could have stayed longer! "
6018416,36381106,2015-06-28,9763,Taylor,"Lindsay's home beyond perfect. We felt right at home and couldn't get enough of the views. Definitely our best airbnb experience to date. Check in was a breeze and Lindsay was a gem, making sure we knew how to reach her and the ins and outs of the house. The house was impeccably clean and had everything we needed. I hope I get the chance to stay at her incredible home again, I'm already dreaming of those amazing sunset views from the deck. Thanks Lindsay!"
6018416,37163606,2015-07-05,3804694,Katie,Lindsay is an incredible host- clear instructions and no detail spared. She responded to questions quickly.  Such a beautiful home!
6018416,38382807,2015-07-15,32072531,Midori,"Wow, just wow. This place is beyond spectacular. The pictures don't even do it justice. Amazing ocean views, wake up in the master loft to sunrise over the Puget Sound. Really made our weekend enjoyable for our Seattle wedding and provided great photo opps for our first look. Lindsay is very communicative and even took care of the plants I forgot on the patio until I could pick them up. You'd be remiss staying anywhere else for the price."
6018416,39016489,2015-07-20,3627631,Sarah,"Lindsay's home is absolutely beautiful. It's open, inviting, and accommodated three couples perfectly. Waking up to the Puget Sound out every window in the morning was such a lovely way to wake up. The kitchen has everything you need to cook up a nice meal or it's just a short walk to grab a bite to eat. The beds are extremely comfortable and the hot tub on the porch was an added bonus! Lindsay is also very responsive to any questions. Thanks for allowing to stay in your home! We had the best time. "
6018416,39920749,2015-07-27,32136622,Sean,"Perfect Seattle location, house and host.  Whether you are coming to Seattle to relax, hike, or experience the city, Lindsay's home is a perfect location for all.  The most amazing part are the views from the balcony, the master bedroom, and living area.  They are even better than shown in the pictures.  This alone makes Lindsay's a must stay.  Also, the interior of the home is spacious, clean, beautifully decorated, and easily accommodates 6 people.  And most importantly Lindsay is a wonderful AirBnB host.  Lindsay was flexible, always accessible, and extremely friendly.  Thanks so much Lindsay!"
6018416,43892440,2015-08-22,6676752,Alythea,The host canceled this reservation 70 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6018416,45077953,2015-08-31,4517798,Kady,"We stayed at Lindsay's house for a month while our house was being remodeled and have only good things to say about the experience.

For starters, the house has the most extraordinary view of the Olympic Mountains, Puget Sound and the Shilshole Marina from every floor. That in and of itself is reason to stay here. The house is also beautifully furnished and comfortable to stay in.

Lindsay is a wonderful host - responsive and attentive to any issues that arose. We've stayed at several Airbnbs and this is the best one yet. Highly recommend. "
6018416,51149379,2015-10-18,4318533,Dayna,"We stayed for one night for a 40th celebration for one of my best friends that lives in Portland. So we wanted a big enough place to cook in and just kick up our heels to relax with a view!
 We had dinner plans in the city and we quickly canceled once we opened the doors to this home! It was so glamorous and filled with so much to do. 
The master bedroom upstairs was so peaceful with the views and automatic window shades were cool. The bed itself was luxurious and super cozy!

 We all need two more days to soak in all the wonders this place has to offer! We will be coming back yearly! On Sunday morning there was a small sail boat races that were fun to watch while we ate brunch. 

Thank you Lindsey for providing the coolest place I have ever stayed in. Wow priceless "
6018416,55362054,2015-12-01,2124482,Kara,"This. House. I can't say enough about my family's Thanksgiving weekend here. Our jaws dropped as soon as we walked in and saw the view, and it never got old. The spacious, elegant kitchen was perfect for cooking our Thanksgiving feast, and we enjoyed many meals around the big, beautiful table. The location is fantastic - a short drive to lots of fun restaurants and breweries (though we always made sure to be ""home"" with a cocktail in our hands for sunset). The beds were comfortable, the big leather couch in the living room fit four of us comfortably for movie night, and did I mention the stunning views from every floor? This was a Thanksgiving to remember, thanks to our stay in this incredible home. Thank you, Lindsay, for sharing it with us!"
6018416,56194056,2015-12-10,46295514,Michael,"I can not say enough good things about this place! It has to be seen to be believed. It's very difficult to capture in photos, but the view, the kitchen and overall function of the home are superb. Lindsay is first class as well. Very friendly, prompt and professional. You should be so lucky to stay here!"
6018416,58018554,2015-12-31,14813381,Kathy,"This was our second time to rent Lindsay's home... as long as Lindsay continues to open her home to others we will continue to enjoy this gem of a home. Just as we experienced during our first stay, this home served us so incredibly well! The spaciousness, the location, the comfort, and the amenities made for another amazing vacation. We were in Seattle for Christmas. Family from California, Colorado, and Washington all met in Seattle for one week. Our Colorado relatives had not before visited Seattle. To quote one of them, Lindsay's house felt so much like Seattle that he wondered where Tom Hanks was. Lindsay and Jason made us feel more than welcome. They made sure we had Christmas lights outside and decorations inside. They even left a supply of Christmas wrap for our use. I am convinced this home feels so warm and welcoming because of the people who live in it. One of these days I bet we'll meet Lindsay and Jason and when we do, we'll most likely feel like we're with family."
23356,233344,2011-04-20,474676,Folkman,It is a very nice house.  Very roomy.  It was clean and comfortable.  The neighborhood was a little scary.
23356,7032800,2013-09-04,5819819,Autumn,"Exactly as expected. The house was nice, and the neighborhood wasn't bad either. Probably one of the less seedy neighborhoods I saw while in Seattle."
23356,15771710,2014-07-15,2887729,Brian,"Tony has a place that can accommodate plenty of people and it is relatively close (15 minute walk) to the light rail either at the Columbia Station or Othello Station.  I always felt like he was available for any questions if I had them.  Super nice guy!

There is a great view of Mt. Rainier on a clear day.  The sunsets were beautiful.  It has everything you need to cook your own meals.  The two bathrooms were nice with the amount of people we had staying there.  The place was kept tidy, the sheets for all the beds were clean.  There were plenty of towels stocked in the closets.  

The neighborhood feels relatively safe.  We never had any problems.  I can see why some people may not feel comfortable...it's not suburbia, but sometimes you have to sacrifice that when in the city for convenience and closeness to all the activities you want to do.  It is on a main road but the noise is minimal because it sits up on a hill and has a wall of concrete steps that leads down to the road.

Overall it is a great place to stay if you and a bunch of friends want to get a taste of Seattle and don't want to have to rent a car to get around.  I'd definitely stay here again!  Thanks Tony!"
23356,28828602,2015-03-30,2734499,Jason,"Great location. Safe neighborhood. Definitely a little bit on the lower income and not as gentrified as closer in, thank goodness! Love having the full amenities of the house. I would recommend Tony's listing to anyone with a small or large group. Very close to Safeway and my favorite Baskin-Robbins."
23356,33260158,2015-05-26,23391776,Julian,"Great stay at Tony's place, this is the first time that I have rented a house to stay and I think it is the best deal that you can get. I didn't get to meet the host personally and now and I would have loved to so that I can thank him personally. The house was super roomy everything was clean and ready for us to use.  Centrally located, we could have use public transportation or drive definitely I would book myself again on my next trip to Seattle since I am so satisfied with the experience thank you Tony very much for making it so easy for us to stay at your place in Seattle"
23356,35656392,2015-06-21,31494939,Helena,"Meille oli annettu perustiedot sisäänpääsemisestä, mutta sen yksityiskohtaisempia ohjeita talon sisäpuolella ei ollut. Ainoa info koski jätteiden lajittelua. Naapurusto oli aika karu ja hoitamaton. Talo oli osittain viimeistelemätön, mutta toimiva. Lähikadun liikenne ei häirinnyt merkittävästi. Majoittujamäärään (6) nähden huoneita ja kylpytiloja oli riittävästi. Liikkuminen edellyttää pääsääntöisesti omaa autoa. Saimme puutteellista tietoa julkisesta liikenteestä läheisestä kaupasta, mutta oma-aloitteisuutemme pelasti meidät."
3490239,18063376,2014-08-21,5242058,Jessica,"My family and I stayed at the Neumann home for 2 weeks in early August. Marie went the extra mile to make sure we would be comfortable in their home by reaching out to us by telephone (twice) and leaving a helpful visitor guide when we arrived at their home. The house was perfect for our needs since we have a toddler. It was fully baby-proofed and family friendly. We loved the house, especially the roof-top terrace where we ate our nightly dinners, and the location near Seattle University and Capitol Hill, and the friendly neighbors. We took advantage of the local markets (Co-op and Trader Joes), cafes, parks and yoga studio that were in walking distance (or bus).  We even walked to downtown (but be prepared for a thigh-burning trek back to the house).  We highly recommend the Neumann house for families who want the comforts of home in a quiet Seattle neighborhood. Note, there are four flights of stairs and a cat, but he was so friendly and spent most time outside or at the neighbors.  Overall, we loved our stay at the Neumann's home.    "
3490239,18330686,2014-08-25,18218678,Kelsey,"Marie was a gracious, generous, and informative host, leaving us plenty of information about both her home and the surrounding area. She provided plenty of details about our arrival, and was accommodating of our unique requests. Her neighbor was incredibly helpful in facilitating our entry into the apartment, as well.

As for the apartment...it is clean, welcoming, and absolutely lovely! The fully stocked kitchen and beautiful roof deck made for a particularly memorable evening cooking and sharing a meal with close but usually distant friends.

All in all, we had a wonderful time, and were very grateful for the use of Marie's home!"
3490239,19276887,2014-09-09,19518395,Allorah,"Marie's house is incredible! It is WAY better than the AirBNB pictures lead you to believe. The townhouse is laid out nicely with lots of open space and beautifully designed. I loved all of the artwork and the overall feel of the place. Everything was clean and organized. It was also very convenient when traveling with my four year old son because he had toys to play with and books to read.  Having a kid's room for him was perfect.  It even has a beta fish aquarium in it!

Marie is also a wonderful host. She provided us with materials and information about the house as well as contacted us during our stay to ensure everything was to our liking.

One of our favorite aspects of the house was the amazing house kitty, Trumpy! She was waiting for us at the curb when we pulled up.  We weren't sure which townhouse was ours (it was dark when we arrived), but Trumpy escorted us straight to the front door. She was so sweet and friendly. I grew up with cats and I have to say Trumpy is the sweetest and friendliest cat ever.  She even slept with us!

Overall we had a great stay in Seattle and this house was one of the big reasons that it was so much fun. Definitely pick this house if you are looking for a unique place to call home for your stay in Seattle."
3490239,20018137,2014-09-22,15155626,Monica,"This is a beautiful, unique and comfortable home and the host was welcoming and helpful. It was especially wonderful to find everything ready for our one-year-old baby."
3490239,40805846,2015-08-02,38473008,Mark,"Awesome modernist townhouse close to downtown Seattle!  Worked great for our family of four.  Clean, comfortable, well equipped home in the Central District, very close to Capitol Hill Neighborhood.  The rood deck is to die for with great views of the city to the West.  The neighborhood is quiet and safe.  Friendly neighbors.  Easy street parking.  Close to cafe's, shopping and two grocery stores.  Great master BR with King bed and en-suite bathroom.  Child's room has twin bed, crib and an additional air mattress if needed.  We slept one in the lower level on a futon style bed that was very comfortable. The kitchen is well equipped and Marie offered us any food we found in the house with the simple request that we replaced what we used.  They have a beautiful cat named Trumpy who we were glad to have as company--super sweet guy!  All and all a very nice home with everything we needed, including laundry for a nice visit to Seattle.  Highly recommended!"
3490239,41328819,2015-08-07,23164180,Sydney,"The location was perfect, about a 15 minute drive to anywhere in the city, and within walking distance to lots of great restaurants, stores and parks. The townhouse had ample room and having 2 bathrooms was a great convenience. I would recommend this listing to anyone looking to stay in the city of Seattle."
3490239,43016365,2015-08-17,26444504,Bob,"We had a fabulous time at Marie's townhouse. The place was perfect for our two small children and had all they needed to be safe and entertained (baby gates, high chair, toys, books, etc).  The place had everything that was advertised and really did exceed expectations.  The space is very nice and comfortable and the rooftop deck is really spectacular!  Sadly, we didn't get a chance to meet Marie but we met a few neighbors and they were all extremely nice.  And, even in her absence, Marie was very helpful and organized.  This is a great place to stay in the city, close to bus routes and walkable to many fun attractions.  I would recommend this place to any small group, particularly one traveling with little kids.  Thanks, Marie!"
4374326,21774237,2014-10-23,2079495,Elizabeth,"Carol was a great host! The room is comfortable, economical and central. Easy access to downtown. It was quiet, clean, and perfect for my stay. I would recommend her rooms to anyone.  She provided me with some snacks which was a really nice touch."
4374326,22213635,2014-11-01,12038774,Bulent Ben,"Carol's place is clean and offers good value for someone who is just looking for a quiet place to sleep and is not high-maintenance... Carol is a very direct and upfront person so it might across intense to some people at first ( Being European, I thought it is Ok ;) but she is a nice person and good host overall. "
4374326,22687137,2014-11-11,18262637,Jay,Carol is a fantastic host.  The house is situated in a charming neighborhood.  I had a car and Carol let me park on the driveway.   I would definitely stay next time!  
4374326,23256362,2014-11-26,4420476,Daniel,Carol was a good trustworthy host thanks.
4374326,23667166,2014-12-07,4420476,Daniel,Great I came back a second time!
4374326,23778981,2014-12-09,4420476,Daniel,"Carol is great. I was one of two guests that kept extending our stay. She is a friend now more than a host. Thanks.
"
4374326,24123114,2014-12-20,24197342,Kevin,"I found Carol to be a very friendly host who enjoys talking with her guests.  She is very interested in learning about her guests and sharing her own stories, which I found very enjoyable.  For my situation the easy access to a 15 minute express bus (#9x) to First Hill was ideal; since I work in that area.  I also enjoyed the quiet of the house in the evening; perfect for relaxing and reading, although a TV is available.  "
4374326,24452631,2014-12-28,25116458,Andrew,Same!
4374326,24515479,2014-12-29,25116458,Andrew,"Carol is simply a delightful host. 

She had everything prepared as listed and she was incredibly accommodating for my needs including amenities and privacy. She is a great conversationalist and just a wonderful human being. I am certain anyone else who visits her place will have a great time!

"
4374326,24693393,2015-01-01,22285021,Andrew,"I didn't get to talk to Carol much since I was out all day, but she was very nice and gave me a nice overview of the house. It's located in Beacon Hill, near Rainier Ave. This gives you access to nearby shopping and a quick route to downtown/Capitol Hill that avoids I-5. The room is warm/large, the bed is comfy, and the bathroom is clean. You also have a private entrance which is great if you're out during the days. Like Carol says in her description, this is a great room if you just need a base of operations while you explore the city. "
4374326,27884533,2015-03-14,9658932,Amnaj,"The room is as described with all necessary amenities and plenty of space to walk around. The air bed is comfy with lots of blankets to keep you warm. Wi-fi is fast and reliable. You can walk downhill (or uphill for some exercise) to and from Light Rail station. The place and neighborhood is so quiet (that I need to set my phone to silent lol.) Carol was there to greet me and show me around when I checked in. She is very friendly and gave me overview of the city. We also had a nice little chat. If you are easy-going and only need a room to crash after a long day in the city, this is the place."
4374326,28102782,2015-03-17,28662025,Yutaka,"Carol is so great host for sure. She is always very kind and helpful to me, thank you Carol! "
4374326,28499842,2015-03-24,4548514,Dustin,"I liked staying here. I took Carol's advice and when arriving from downtown I used Beacon Street Station and walked downhill, and when leaving the house to go downtown, I used the Mount Baker Station and walked up hill. 
The bed is very comfortable and the internet connection was fast. I also liked having my own entrance, since I came in around 11 or so.

"
4374326,28739476,2015-03-29,12167374,Conor,"Carol was a very nice and accommodating host. She offered me free doughnuts and coffee and we had good conversations while I stayed. The room offered enough privacy for me, even though there wasn't a door for the room. Although this space was out of the way from the central part of Seattle, it wasn't too far from the light rail station and traveling back and forth wasn't that bad. I would recommend this space to anyone who needs a place to stay in Seattle, but if you're looking for a place more central, I would recommend finding a place in downtown or in Capitol Hill. "
4374326,29358455,2015-04-06,21290176,Ben,Everything was great. Welcoming host. Comfortable room. Definitely recommend.
4374326,30482808,2015-04-22,6847940,David,"Carol was very accommodating with my last minute reservations. Carol is a great host and had great conversations with her during my stay. Due to the location of Carol's house I had the choice of taking the Link(train), bus, or drive my car around Seattle. I ended up leaving my car parked most the time and took advantage of the public transportation to get around Seattle. I definitely recommend staying here and will again when I come back to Seattle!"
4374326,31273045,2015-05-03,29006606,Assaf,Staying at Carol's place was a great pleasure for me. It does look like she has done everything she could to make the guest feel comfortable and welcome in her place. She is a great conversationalist and her house is flooded with books which she actually read. That means you can have great conversations with her about anything in the world.
4374326,31609731,2015-05-07,28661767,Amber,"Everything was just how it was described in the posting. The ""air bed"" was very comfortable and had a cushy memory foam mattress on top. The room was spacious and despite not having a door, everything was still relatively private. The location was convenient to bus routes and it was only a 15-20 ride to the airport. I accidentally left some items behind and the host was gracious enough to mail them back to me!  "
4374326,32428651,2015-05-17,2234440,Scott,The basement recreation room at Carol's house is spacious and comfortable. The location is great. The side entrance is convenient for coming and going without disturbing your host. Carol is interesting and friendly. I enjoyed my stay and hope to return in the future. 
4374326,33050823,2015-05-24,3029106,Victoria,"This room is large, comfortable, and quiet. Carol is friendly, generous, and helpful. The house is within walking distance to two light rail stations."
4374326,34029367,2015-06-03,30745975,Subin,"I really enjoyed my stay there. When I was lost in her neighborhood, she managed to find me and take me to her home. She did her best to make me comfortable and I am glad that I chose this place for my Seattle trip. Also, the location was really good for person without a car because it was real convenient to go to downtown."
4374326,34385025,2015-06-07,9374231,Steven,"Carol was very nice and welcoming when I first arrived. Her place is as advertised. Affordable, clean and very close to downtown. Will stay here again if in Seattle!"
4374326,34712114,2015-06-11,32455600,Aaron,Great experience! Carol was great!
4374326,35145902,2015-06-15,11252227,Serge,"I really had a good time at Carol's place.She is a caring person and her house was perfect for me.
Thank you again Carol for everything !"
4374326,35433296,2015-06-18,3029106,Victoria,Carol is a great host. She is friendly and helpful.
4374326,35701056,2015-06-21,199915,Eric,"Responsive host--communication was prompt and clear, though a bit strained at first by mistrust of my identity. Decent location about 25 minutes on the bus from downtown, so a quieter neighborhood without as many main attractions. The place and room itself were very clean, with drinks and snacks offered. Some very specific house rules--not the most laid-back experience, but turned out fine for a short stay."
4374326,36886968,2015-07-02,34764316,Amber,"Carol is a great host. This was my first experience using Airbnb and it was a great place to stay. I felt very welcomed from the moment I arrived in Seattle. 
Carol is always willing to talk and share ideas about were to go.
House is close to LINK station and bus stop which was nice for exploring.
"
4374326,37411620,2015-07-06,37100214,Emma,"Carol made me feel very welcome, was always open to have conversations in her beautiful backyard and prepared breakfast and hot coffee and tea every morning. She was also respectful of my privacy at the same time.
The basement room was really big, and also nice and cool (air conditioned) which was great since it was very hot that weekend. The room is also very quiet and the bed is comfy. Everything was clean. The neighbourhood is a bit far from downtown but transportation is easy and it's close to the light rail station. There's also lots of cute little restaurants nearby. This is a great place to stay!"
4374326,38243708,2015-07-13,35732917,Alexander,Carol was helpful. I booked the place short notice and she was quick to comminicate. I would stay again. She was even kind enough to share some beers with an tired traveler.
4374326,38656616,2015-07-17,2234440,Scott,I have stayed at five other Airbnb homes in Seattle. I like Carol's place the best and have visited many times. Her home is in a good location and the cool basement rooms have been perfect this hot summer. Carol is genuinely interested in her lodgers and seems to enjoy the variety of people who pass through her doors. 
4374326,39226702,2015-07-21,36874595,Ana,"Mi experiencia ha sido fantástica en todos los sentidos.
Cuando llegué, Carol estaba esperando y todo estaba preparado para mi. Toda la casa está muy limpia y cuidada y Carol se ocupa muy profesionalmente de su mantenimiento.
Pero lo mejor sin duda es la propia Carol. La mejor y más divertida anfitriona que he conocido, con la que es imposible aburrirse y que siempre tiene buenos consejos y recomendaciones para hacer que tu estancia en Seattle sea diferente e inolvidable.
Cuando vuelva a Seattle, definitivamente quiero volver a este alojamiento."
4374326,39583485,2015-07-24,37736136,Joe,Carol was a good host and her place was accurate as described in the listing. It was just a short drive into downtown which carol gave me rides to at convenient times. She even provided coffee and snacks in the morning. Everything was clean and I felt like my room was very private. Would definitely stay here again! Thanks Carol!
4374326,39840681,2015-07-26,19639610,Brittany,"Carol is incredibly hospitable - everything that I expected I got and sometimes she exceeded these expectations. For example, she provided a complimentary breakfast in the mornings with fresh brewed coffee, which really gave me a great start to the day especially when I was in a rush! Professionally executed Airbnb; would recommend."
4374326,40543647,2015-07-31,27610083,Jacob,"Very friendly host, great big air conditioned room."
4374326,41111018,2015-08-04,37360438,David,"Carol was very accommodating, responsive, and friendly. The ad was accurate, and in a number of ways my expectations were exceeded. Anyone staying in the area should seriously consider renting one of the rooms here."
4374326,41910066,2015-08-09,40805499,Yang,Have a great night there. Carol is friendly and easygoing.
4374326,42581602,2015-08-14,39528383,Mohammad," Carol is very friendly and I should say a great host and person. I was attending a conference and stayed there for 5 days and that was a great experience. 

The room/bathroom/kitchen was quite clean and nice. The place is close to Mount Baker train station and quite convenient if you want to commute to downtown.   
"
4374326,43425984,2015-08-19,39653397,Frank,Carol was an amazing host.  My first time using airbnb and she made the experience wonderful.  The room and house was clean.  She was really cool to talk to and hang out with in the backyard.  Also she gave me great tips on where to go and how to get there.  Would definitely stay here again.  Thanks Carol!
4374326,44072394,2015-08-23,41944427,Jina,"Carol was very friendly and accommodating, and was really informative about places to go to eat and see. The room was very comfortable and exactly as described. The location was convenient as it was close to 2 link stations. I would stay here again!"
4374326,46344251,2015-09-09,38328928,Björn,"Carol replied my enquiries very swiftly and her basement room was quiet and the bed was good for sleeping and resting.  Very good location and easy to transport to and from.  Lots of interesting books all around the room and great to have a private entrance and the access to the patio outside.  Cool excercise machine also, although I did not have a chance to work out on it.  :)"
4374326,47314032,2015-09-17,43814519,Krishna,It was great staying at this place. Carol was very friendly and interactive! The house is also in a calm neighbourhood and has all the required stuff. All in all it was a good experience !!
4374326,47592378,2015-09-20,2234440,Scott,Carol's place is my Seattle home away from home. 
4374326,50892083,2015-10-15,46067650,Kenneth,Great experience - room was exactly as described and Carol was super friendly and accommodating!
4374326,53842536,2015-11-13,1209361,Brian,Carol was a very welcoming host who provides everything you need to have a pleasant stay. She is a great communicator and takes time to get to know her guests. A nice spot for the solo traveler.
4374326,56148551,2015-12-09,49791858,Bryan,"Great location in Beacon Hill. Carol was a fantastic host and was very responsive! 

The room is very clean and spacious. There is a TV provided for extra comfort. The room is located on the bottom level of the house, which can be accessed from the side of the house, so it's almost like having your own apartment! There is also parking available, which is very convenient, because parking can be a pain in downtown. 

It was the perfect place for me to spend a week while I was moving into the Seattle location. Within a 5 minute drive from SODO and Downtown areas. 

"
4374326,58053662,2015-12-31,25084144,Scott,"My experience of stay in Carol's house is fantastic. You can ride the Link from the airport to her house. The house environment exceeds my expectations. The rec room is clean, tidy, private, and big enough. Also, Carol is so far the best airbnb host I have ever met. She is cool, warmhearted, and helpful. I definitely expect to stay in her house next time I go to Seattle. Five-star expience."
7902330,44247721,2015-08-24,31759130,Kylie,"My Mom and I were super happy we chose to stay at this location! Dario was excellent at communicating. Upon arriving, we were given a brief tour of the space, and then shown our room- which was extremely clean, and up-to-date. There was an abundance of fresh towels at all times, and the bathroom was also kept extremely clean. We felt very welcomed and enjoyed our short time here- would definitely recommend!"
7902330,44380852,2015-08-25,20907503,Matt,"Nice clean room in a nice clean house. Everything well organized and comfortable. Handled my early arrival gracefully. For a simple place to stay, I'd recommend it."
7902330,44604734,2015-08-27,23014622,Vasya,Comfortable bed in a nice room and friendly people. 
7902330,45454675,2015-09-02,17814612,Aleece,Dario and Amanda were awesome and their place is the perfect stop if you need a comfy bed and a great breakfast. It was so clean and perfect. Would stay there again
7902330,46078050,2015-09-07,43079631,Teuntje,It's a great place to be. They are really nice and welcoming. It's a great nice and clean room.
7902330,47131199,2015-09-15,10443070,Madhuri,"I used the instant book option. Everything was straightforward. I arrived pretty late in the night, around 11:30 PM and Amanda (Dario's in house host), sent me the details for the code to enter. Room and the shared bathroom was clean as shown in the pictures. 

The only slight inconvenience was that the house was marked ""9311"", as opposed to the actual ""9317"". I had to call Dario to confirm that's the correct house"
7902330,49292702,2015-10-02,45286583,Erin,This was my first AirBnB experience and I had a great stay at Dario's! Amanda was very friendly and helpful. The house was very clean and tidy. Breakfast was a great addition! 
7902330,49755145,2015-10-05,45169344,Max,Really nice house 
7902330,49869395,2015-10-06,30523777,Maura Catherine,Enjoyed my stay! The upgrades Dario has made are perfect. Especially the newly renovated bathroom !
7902330,50236439,2015-10-10,2234440,Scott,"A stay at Dario's place is more like staying in a small private hotel more than a persons home. Which I like. There are several Airbnb rooms so the house is setup for guests with common areas and kitchen access. Bathroom is shared by several people, but there was never a problem with wait time. I will be returning."
7902330,50402636,2015-10-11,38595591,Ines,"Very nice and clean house and a very cosy bedroom. Everything well described, lots of space in the shared areas. 
I would defenitely recommend it to anyone. 

"
7902330,50587916,2015-10-12,24561048,Lindsay,Great easy convenient place near the airport  
7902330,50995155,2015-10-16,43860184,Jayme,"House was very clean, room was comfortable, other house guests were friendly. Met the host of the house and she was very nice. In a convenient location to the airport and near the Kubota Garden! Would stay again."
7902330,51257853,2015-10-18,3769508,Jordan,"Great room with plenty of comfort for a great price! Enjoyed my short overnight here before work; the only concern I had was the lack of towels when I had to shower. 

Overall it was a fantastic experience and I would stay with Dario again! Great and helpful host. "
7902330,51481510,2015-10-20,43912768,Macy,"The house/room is just as pictured- organized. Owner is very generous with kitchen and bathroom necessities. However, bedroom floors were dirty... Dusty and lots of hair.. and bathroom would've been better if it were cleaner. The iffiest part was we weren't sure if our sheets were washed prior to our arrival as there were strands of hair underneath the duvet and pillow shams and the bed sheet was wrinkled as if someone had just slept on it. Was going to reach out to the owner/host, but we didn't really see them and we were only there for 2 nights. Not the nicest area of Seattle, as we were also told by local lyft and uber drivers, but very close to airport and downtown. "
7902330,51589931,2015-10-21,12034172,Philip,Great place. Dario helped with restaurants etc in the area. 
7902330,52290527,2015-10-27,46879819,Lindsey,"Amanda was absolutely delightful (Dario's roommate). The house was quite well kept and everything (kitchen, bathroom, bedrooms) was helpfully labeled. The bed was comfortable, as were the pillows (nice and full, not flat). Amanda was full of great ideas about where to check out and eat. The neighborhood was quiet and easily accessible to the 5, a grocery store, and gas station. We would definitely stay here again!"
7902330,52386960,2015-10-28,45935480,Laura,"I didn't meet Dario but the communication was good!  The place is cozy, clean and private.  I'd recommend it to others.  "
7902330,52642890,2015-10-31,47036404,Bryant,"The entire experience was amazing!!  Actually better in person then posted.  The pictures do not do justice for this house.
Available breakfast, coffee, OJ, WiFi.
The backyard is really peaceful,  relaxing and soothing.
I enjoyed my time so much that I extended my say and booked a different room in the house."
7902330,53302558,2015-11-07,47992243,Matt,"This was my first B&B experience and I must say it went pleasantly well. You can be as outgoing or to yourself as you'd like. The one bathroom for he house wasn't an issue as I made sure to wake up early and do my morning routine. Amanda was very hospitable and everyone in the house was really nice, this is B&B done right! Thanks"
7902330,53522756,2015-11-09,16021726,Natalia,the sophie room was great! clean and comfy! My friend and I really enjoyed our stay! I highly recomend this room to all travelers.
7902330,53997091,2015-11-15,46667538,Weier,"The room is really nice, and the house is clean and tidy. Breakfast makes me feel like at home, and people there are always friendly. Grocery Store is just 5 minutes walk and the bus stop is nearby. I really enjoy the experience in Dario's house. Thanks! "
7902330,56683557,2015-12-16,47561078,Shannon,"I arrived on short notice but everything was organized and very welcoming. Dario was busy that evening but the person who helped me arrange my arrival was great. The room was exactly as described and clean and ready for me. The house had all the breakfast items, the shower was hot, I couldn't have asked for a better stay. I met Dario later in my stay and he is kind and helpful and seemed genuinely concerned about my stay. The neighborhood is quiet as is the house. A big grocery store is several blocks away and the kitchen had all the essentials for preparing my own food. Even the guests in the house were friendly and we had great conversations a few evenings. There is a bus stop two blocks away if that is how you travel. Lake Washington is one block away and beautiful even in this time of year. Being able to do laundry in the house is a big plus. A great place to stay in Seattle if you don't have be downtown in the middle of everything. I really enjoyed the peaceful area where the house is located. Any of the rooms in this house would be recommended. "
1209447,6250518,2013-08-05,7385265,Michelle,"Our experience at this house couldn't have been better. Complete with a crib and a toddler bed (and high chairs and toys and a nice back deck), it was perfect for our kids!  Lovely, quiet neighborhood, easy parking, very close to the city, and the owners were so easy to work with.  I'd definitely stay here again and I'd recommend the house to anyone going on a family vacation to the Seattle area! "
1209447,6487436,2013-08-14,137436,Greg,"We had a great time in Seattle at Shane's house.  At first I was a bit nervous, as AirBnB states that the host name is Timothy, but his real name is Shane.  However, this was not really a big deal, as it is most definitely Shane and his family that live there. The house itself is a work in progress, so if you are looking for something high end, this would not fit the bill. The house was very clean and quite functional. We appreciated the fact that it is kid friendly. At first we were not that impressed by the house or neighborhood, but by the time we left, the house really grew on us and it is a great location in a really cool up-and-coming neighborhood. Shane has done a great job in creating a thorough ""house rules"" packet that has everything you need to feel comfortable in the house.  Even though Shane was not there to meet us, that was no problem as we were easily able to let ourselves in and make ourselves at home.  We appreciated the fact that there was a Safeway just down the street and it was a short 20 min trip to Seattle Center (where we ended up going daily). The house was also really close to the lake and park and that was nice too. Highly recommended if you have a small child or toddler as the house is very kid friendly including the fun sandbox in the backyard. Finally, we did appreciate their sense of humor and laid back vibe that was prevalent throughout the house rules as well as the house decor. :-)"
1209447,7170460,2013-09-09,7007114,Derrick,"Shane was an excellent host and his home was perfect for a family. The neighborhood was wonderful with beautiful parks and great cafe/restaurant recommendations via the house manual nearby. HIghly recommended, and would love to stay again on our next trip."
1209447,17104360,2014-08-07,6388165,Joel,"This house is overall pretty good for the price. Make sure to note that it has 2 full sized beds and one bed for a young child, as opposed to 3 full sized. And it's only a couple minutes to the best french toast in the whole world at Geraldine's Counter!!!"
1209447,17367034,2014-08-11,17622038,Matthew,I brought my two boys for a work trip/vacation to Seattle and was so happy to have found this house to stay at for the week.  It was clean bright and in a quiet neighborhood.  With two young kids it was a refreshing alternative to staying at a hotel.  There was a food co-op nearby for groceries and a short drive to the downtown area.  I hope that we can stay here again for future trips to Seattle.
1209447,30327508,2015-04-20,30235810,Mandy,"Great little house, super close to downtown!  We had a great weekend at Shane's home.  It was the perfect place and location for our family.   Anyone traveling with small children would appreciate staying here - you wont have to bring anything with you to keep your kids entertained.  My 2 year had a blast reading all their kid's books and playing with their toys.  She was also stoked to sleep in a bunk bed.  Dog friendly too, which is a huge bonus.  Comfortable accomodations, kitchen had everything I needed for cooking.  Loved all the big beautiful windows and natural light.  Would stay here again."
1209447,41742122,2015-08-09,31172627,Shawn,Timothy's home is a great house in an even better location. Close to all amenities and the guide he left behind for take out and places to eat was very helpful. Great pricing for a lovely home. The area is pretty accessible to public transit so you are always able to get to where you need to go.
8369321,47881148,2015-09-21,1360346,Daniel,"Had a great time staying in Haley's studio for 3 nights. 
It is located in a great part of the city with lots diverse of things to do very close by. 
The bed was very comfortable and her apartment was incredibly clean. 
I would highly recommend staying there. "
7401854,43653151,2015-08-21,7577440,Alessia,"Carolina's apartament is a cozy, beautiful typical American house in a residencial central neighborhood of Seattle. Downtown is 20 minutes walking from the house (take care with the rise if you have any problems with the hill).
The apartament is perfect for two persons (we had a baby and there wasn't  the third bed for her). It's very clean and bright and with all confort for your stay (washing mashine, dryer, a full equipped kitchen, bathroom with tub, little garden with a table and barbecue...).
Carolina is a good host. She gave us all informations we needed to get her apartament and visit Seattle and she has always answered quickly at all our doubts).
She asked for the first night if for us it would be a problem if she had sleeped in the house and she gave us 20$ back.
Anyway, we didn't see her for all time we staied in the house."
7401854,46039306,2015-09-07,16584701,Caitlin,"An absolutely lovely house in a nice, quiet residential neighborhood.  The place is walking distance to cafes and bars, so it's not isolated, and the inside is gorgeous and clean.  Carolina was responsive and communicative.  Would absolutely stay again.  Thanks, Carolina!"
7401854,46802862,2015-09-13,26876354,Nancie,"Absolutely beautiful home in a quiet neighborhood. Very clean, tasteful decor, all new appliances in the kitchen, & the futon was comfortable. Carolina responds quickly & made sure our first Airbnb stay went smoothly. Thanks again!"
7401854,47405794,2015-09-18,10085911,Jane,Carolina is a very attentive host with a comfortable and lovely place. I had a really pleasant and comfortable stay in Carolina's home. She was there when I checked in to show me around the place and was always available whenever I had questions. The area is lovely and was a short trip to downtown. I definitely recommend staying here!
7401854,47452151,2015-09-18,10330821,Alejandra,The host canceled this reservation 8 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7401854,47875893,2015-09-21,32507101,Kathleen C,"Bright, immaculate, and quiet home in a close in neighborhood.  A perfect place to stay if you want to escape the noise and the bustle of Capitol Hill, but desire to be within walking distance of it.  Carolina's home is comfortable, well appointed and very clean. The home is located in a quiet neighborhood with plenty of on street parking. Carolina was easy to reach by email and responded quickly to all our inquiries.  We have no reservations about recommending Carolina's place."
7401854,51191635,2015-10-18,28838020,Laurel,"Carolina's home provided the perfect respite in Seattle. Heated floors, new (and upgraded) appliances, nice furnishings, and a great location made my trip thoroughly enjoyable. Many unique restaurants are within walking distance. I highly recommend Cafe Selam if you enjoy Ethiopian cuisine. Uber and Lyft drivers are never more than 3-4 minutes away, so you can easily access a ride if you need to travel to other parts of the city. When you first arrive, look for a green house. The house numbers are a bit difficult to locate when you visit the home for the first time. :)"
7401854,55733179,2015-12-05,2232292,Alejandro,"Carolina's appartment was very nice and clean. It is only five blocks from Queen Anne and there you have many cool restaurants and bars.

When we arrived everything was setup in the apartment inluding remote for the garage, wireless password etc.

And also is within (long) walking distance to the space needle."
108765,322176,2011-06-19,590284,Glenn,Very clean and comfortable.  A little small for more than one. 
108765,344703,2011-06-30,715445,Beverly,"Mary is extremely hospitable and the cottage is very clean and cute. It is a small cottage, but it served me very well and I enjoyed meeting Mary. Would recommend this cottage to a friend and I would go back if my travel plans bring me to Seattle. "
108765,367470,2011-07-11,523534,Alireza,"honorable host, and a amazing individual..the cottage is one of the most comfortable,clean and accesiible places i have stayed at.

108765,419827,2011-08-04,831272,Susan,"What a fabulous experience staying in Mary's sweet, beautiful and comfortable cottage was!  We were greeted by Mary, her warm smile and welcome glass of wine were just what we needed to feel at home here. Her garden is lovely, the chickens are delightful, and the bed utterly comfortable. I can think of nowhere I would rather stay when on the road.
Thank you Mary for your generosity and your wonderful hospitality."
108765,481905,2011-08-28,897017,Amy,"Out of the four places we stayed at through airbnb reservations on our driving trip, Mary's cottage was our favorite. It was clean, comfortable, and charming. We loved the garden, deck, and dedicated parking space. Mary went above and beyond providing binders that showcased restaurants and things to do in various Seattle neighborhoods. It was completely ideal for privacy, but when we had questions about Seattle, Mary was the perfect hostess."
108765,1367984,2012-05-28,2429469,Bobbi,"The Beacon Hill cottage was positively fantastic.  Bright, open and well-appointed, the cottage made for a relaxing getaway.  Mary was both charming and welcoming, much like the cottage itelf.  It seemed more like visiting a friend than simply an accomodation for travel.  Most appreciated by us:  the convenient location to public transportation, the cottage porch overlooking the garden worthy of ""Better Homes & Gardens"", and the uber comfortable bed.  It is doubtful we will stay elswhere when our travel plans take us to Seattle!"
108765,1744093,2012-07-18,502164,Carrie,"Beautiful, small space that fit my needs. Mary was easy and friendly to work with. Thanks Mary!"
108765,2339446,2012-09-18,3217437,Chad,"This was my first Airbnb experience, and I'm happy to report it was a positive one. The Cottage on Beacon Hill is as advertised and much more. It provided a comfortable space that was quiet and private yet just a short bus ride from bustling hub of downtown. Mary is a respectful and accommodating host, and it was a pleasure getting the opportunity to meet her. I highly recommend this property and its charming host."
108765,2456221,2012-09-30,3401115,Mladen,"Passing through Seattle recently I stayed at Mary's cottage and found it excellent! The cottage is perfectly sized for individuals or couples, its very clean and has all the amenities you could possibly need. Its in a nice location and pretty much everything is within 10 minutes or so. I was there with a car but public transport is easily accessible. Best of all, Mary is extremely helpful and will gladly share tips about the Seattle area. No doubt about it, its 5* and if I pass through Seattle again and need a place to stay I know where I am headed to! Recommended."
108765,2479225,2012-10-01,1279870,Lindsay,"Beacon Hill Cottage is delightful with fantastic hosts. It is cute, clean, homey, and although small, provides everything you could need. It is a short and convenient bus ride from downtown Seattle. We couldn't have asked for a better night's stay. We are looking forward to our next stay at the cottage and would highly recommend it."
108765,2528918,2012-10-07,693263,Lindsay & Todd,"The cottage was beautiful and impeccably clean. Mary left beverages in the fridge and even a bottle of wine (which we didn't partake in given our limited stay) for us. The bed was comfortable and the cottage offered a cozy and quiet night sleep in a private location.

Great place to stay if you are just passing through or staying for several nights! My husband and I both highly recommend staying here on your journey to Seattle! "
108765,2811528,2012-11-05,763614,Dan,Mary and Bonnnie are fabulous hosts with a fabulous cottage. We'd love to go back and spend more time with them!
108765,3236139,2013-01-02,3915170,Brendan,"Mary was wonderful.  My girlfriend and I needed a place to sleep for New Years and I was flying up from San Francisco that night. Besides a call earlier in the day, there was no need to meet up and go over house rules, it was as simple as grabbing the key.  Great location too."
108765,3794010,2013-03-15,5424716,Carole,This was a perfect situation for me. I loved the Cottage and the lovely garden setting. Mary is terrific. Her passion for people and generous hospitality was a delight to experience. Will return every chance I have.
108765,3863444,2013-03-22,5319317,June,"Mary is the quintessential welcoming host.  From the time we arrived until the time we left, she made us feel like old friends.  The garden was in bud and bloom, and must be magnificent in spring and summer.  The snugly bed, excellent shower and homey feeling were completely enjoyed by us.  Mary even had a welcoming bottle of red upon our arrival which we enjoyed after a long flight from CT.  We will certainly recommend her dear cottage to others!  Close to the environs of Seattle by rental car or public transportation."
108765,4013761,2013-04-02,3769228,Kevin And Ashley,We loved Mary's cottage. It was the perfect place for us to relax in tranquility while exploring a new city. The interior itself was very clean and had just the amenities we needed. Mary was a great host and very friendly. We would very much like to stay again and highly recommend the cottage.
108765,4095883,2013-04-09,1458921,Leslie,"Wonderful space with a warm, generous host.  The cottage was private, very quiet, clean, with shower with lots of (website hidden) worked great and free Wifi and a very comfortable bed.  Mary was welcoming and warm.  Having a parking spot not on the street, but in their yard made me feel safe.  Would highly recommend this space, close to downtown, West Seattle, Columbia City and the Vashon Ferry.  Price was really reasonable and beats staying at a hotel."
108765,4443585,2013-05-06,267216,Jimmy And Annabel,"Dear Mary...... what can we say? FABULOUS, DARLING, SWEET, UBER COMFORTABLE, THOUGHTFUL, CALM, CHARMING..... too much?  Jimmy (the Hat), Ruben (uncle Ruby, oh also Renshi Rub!), and Annabel (the Queen) enjoyed Seattle & your place & peeps immensely.  Great vibe. Thank you &  We""ll be back if you'll have us! Xoxoxo from Texas,  annabel;)

108765,5735569,2013-07-14,6904832,Brenda,A PERFECT place to stay in Seattle: cozy cottage with outdoor seating and lovely gardens. Spotlessly clean; comfortable bed with deluxe bedding & duvet; convenient to GREAT restaurants and neighbourhoods. Our hosts: second-to-none! Wonderfully warm... welcoming... kind. We highly recommend the Beacon Hill Cottage!
108765,11368937,2014-03-31,7462811,Tobe,"This is a great little cottage in a nice neighborhood. Our hosts were very nice, and helpful. This cottage had everything we needed. The cold beverages kept us refreshed after long days of seeing the sights. My phone was easy to charge. The bathroom was nice. The gardens surrounding the cottage were very relaxing. What a cute dog too! "
108765,16904283,2014-08-04,12576019,Amber,"This cottage has everything a single person or a couple could want while visiting Seattle. The bed is cozy, the bathroom is clean, the fridge is stocked with beer and wine, and the surrounding garden is just gorgeous. Mary was also a friendly, accommodating host with an adorable dog that roam around the property. The rest of the city is easily accessible via the Lyft app. I highly recommend both using Lyft and staying here!"
108765,17050548,2014-08-06,16952606,Christina,"This cottage is great.  Cute, space efficient & clean in a centrally located neighbourhood with great hosts & on site parking.  I can't recommend this spot enough.  Fabulous!"
108765,21997264,2014-10-27,9855842,Nick,"What a wonderful place to stay!  Mary was a gracious and attentive host, and both the location and the actual cottage were fabulous.  The fridge full of beverages was most welcome.  I will definitely come again next time I am in Seattle.  Thank you"
108765,27621396,2015-03-08,6472900,Jaki,Very welcoming! Really cute house and nice neighborhood. 
108765,30620186,2015-04-25,19361392,Philip,"Mary is wonderful. She made us tea and had a wonderful chat with us upon our arrival. The cottage is very cute and well appointed. She went out of her way to make us feel welcome as well as providing us a list of local sights and restaurants.

We would stay here again anytime! Her dog Kuma is also fantastic"
108765,31332148,2015-05-04,9291997,Beth,What a great cottage ! Perfect size and well thought out! The fridge was stocked with all kinds of goodies:) hosts couldn't have been sweeter! Location was PERFECT! We will be back and wouldn't think of staying anywhere else!!!!
108765,31721215,2015-05-09,31092235,Miguel,"Beacon Hill Cottage is a great place to stay if you're visiting Seattle. The cottage was a perfect size for my fiancee and I and the mini-fridge full of drinks was much appreciated. The plates/flatware Mary had in the cottage also came in very handy.  It felt like a home away from home!  The cottage is also conveniently located. Mary’s cottage is right across the street from a bus stop which takes you right to downtown Seattle. Mary was an amazing host during our stay. She greeted us upon our arrival and she let us know of all the great places to eat in the area. She also answered all of our questions about getting around in Seattle and how to use the public transit system. We appreciated that Mary did everything she could to make sure we had a great time in Seattle. Because of her, my fiancee and I left feeling like we really soaked in Seattle, not just the tourist sites. Mary was so warm and welcoming. We couldn’t have asked for a better host! It was great having her on-site and running into to her throughout the day. As first-time Airbnb users, we are definitely thankful that we chose Mary’s cottage for our Seattle vacation. "
108765,34303828,2015-06-07,1462674,Mike,"Mary was a phenomenal host, and the cottage was comfortable and cozy.  Even on a hot weekend, the cottage remained cool, especially with the great shades and window fan.  Mary's garden is beautiful, making it delightful to sit on the porch with a glass of wine (kindly provided).  From the cottage, it's easy to get to and from downtown Seattle, or any where, as the ramp to the 5 is nearby.  And exploring is made easy with the details guides Mary has provided and compiled from scratch!  

Mary was cordial and delightful in conversation, and my friend and I had a wonderful time speaking with her and learning about her time in Seattle.

I would absolutely stay here again."
108765,38194958,2015-07-13,31860371,Melissa,"Mary was a fantastic host!   She was warm and personable and the cottage had all the right touches of home!  She was kind enough to let us in early, and it was a joy to be greeted by her family and pup.   Her guides to various parts of the city were extremely useful.    The bed was comfortable and the refrigerator was a great touch.    If you are going to nap mid-afternoon,  the cottage seems to be in the path of SEA-TAC, so you'll hear the occasional landing, but this isn't a problem at night.   In fact, I probably slept better here than at home.   Parking on the street was super easy and a great proximity to downtown and other areas.  On our next visit, we will be calling up Mary again!"
108765,38538804,2015-07-16,37271938,Hope,"Mary was very welcoming! She had very detailed information and suggestions about each of the local neighborhoods, as well as a refrigerator stocked with tasty beverages. Both she and her dog, Kuma, were very friendly and a pleasure to talk to."
108765,41384452,2015-08-07,36533915,Deborah,"Beacon Hill cottage in the city is such a gem as is its host, Mary. She greeted us with a smile, pleasant, laid back - couldn't have asked for a better first time airbnb experience. The cottage is as described. The complimentary beverages aren't a surprise any longer due to all the amazing reviews but so appreciated. It's the little things that stand out now that my mom (82 years young) and I have been on the road traveling together. Snacks, small refrigerator filled with a variety of beverages, hot pot for water, Starbucks instant coffee, tea, binders labeled with specific areas of Seattle which include maps and recommendations. Cottage is impeccably maintained. Mary's garden is an oasis to come back to at the end of the day. The outdoor deck attached to the cottage serves as your living room - comfortable couch and beautiful surroundings. I believe Mary has a tremendous amount of pride hosting in Seattle and sharing her bit of paradise with others "
108765,41945739,2015-08-10,34229576,Marty,"The Beacon Hill Cottage is the perfect place for a weekend get-away near Seattle!  We took the train up from Eugene, OR,--- deciding we did not want to stay in a hotel downtown, we tried Airbnb for the first time, preferring the quiet and more private promise of a small cottage like Mary's.  She delivered!  First of all, the cottage was clean (very clean with no harsh chemical smells or perfumed scented candles - just clean!).  The accommodations were comfy and quaint with a very comfortable bed, nice linens, a hot shower, and very private.  The cottage had absolutely everything we needed! We were within walking distance from the bus and light rail stops which made for easy (and fast) access to the downtown Seattle area.  Mary was very helpful and made excellent recommendations to restaurants in the Beacon Hill and Columbia City area, allowing us to enjoy fantastic food throughout our entire stay!  We give the Beacon Hill Cottage, AND Mary as the host,  5 enthusiastic stars!  Thanks, Mary, we'll be back!

108765,44924163,2015-08-30,7502211,Chelsea,"Our stay at Beacon Hill Cottage was fantastic! The cottage is so cozy and comfortable and extremely well accommodated. Mary clearly put a lot of effort into making sure her guests feel comfortable and have everything they need. We felt so at home and welcomed staying with Mary, who was so enjoyable to talk with and beyond helpful and accommodating! 

As far as the cottage's location, it was perfect. Just a short bus ride gets you to downtown Seattle and the bus stop is literally across the street and the neighbourhood is home to some cute and delicious bars and restraunts.

We will definitely be staying here again whenever we return to Seattle!"
108765,46668272,2015-09-12,361724,Christina,"Mary's cottage was one of my best airBnB experiences. Everything of the cottage was perfect. In addition you get an extraordinary friendly and caring host Mary, who welcomed us in the most open-hearted way you can imagine. She even helped us getting a cab to the airport in the middle of the night, for which we are really thankful. 

We definitely recommend Mary's cottage for a stay in Seattle. We hope, we can return  to her place some time."
108765,51234128,2015-10-18,17129386,Mike,"Exceptional experience- Mary was warm, welcoming and did everything she could to make us feel comfortable. The place is fantastic, it was set up for us to be really comfortable and have a great stay."
4988679,43912787,2015-08-23,32608208,Jon,"Maggie was very welcoming and helpful during our stay. She mostly left my roommate and I to ourselves, but was there whenever we needed something or had a question."
4988679,44602331,2015-08-27,37039633,Dan,"While I do not necessarily have anything poor to say about Maggie, herself - she was extremely responsive to my questions that I had before and during the stay - I do feel the need to inform others what to expect from this place, in general.  I really hate to leave poor reviews, but I am hoping that it will help others looking for a place to stay as well as the host as she continues to strive to improve her guests' experiences.

First, I was dismayed to find parking very inconvenient.  Nothing in the description of the property speaks to parking.  The street the unit is on is very short and parking is at a premium.  There is no garage access with this property.  You can park on the main road, but be prepared to move it before 7:00 am unless you don't care about getting a ticket.  

Additionally, the apartment/condo appeared as if people (either permanent residents or previous visitors) had vacated it just minutes before we arrived.  There clearly was no cleaning done prior to our arrival with the exception of towels and bedding, which were clean (thankfully).  There was gritty dust/dirt and debris on the floor (there are no slippers by the front door to wear, as indicated in the description), shopping receipts, mail and other personal items on the countertops, thick dust on the window ledges, etc.  The TV did not work (at least we couldn't figure it out) and we had to message Maggie to find out what the wifi network/password was.   

If you do book this property, please make sure that you get all of the pertinent information you need before arrival (TV instructions, garage access, parking hints/advice, wifi information, etc.).  It will alleviate frustrations like what we had.
 
This property really does have the potential to be an awesome place to stay given its proximity to everything.  But I would suggest going in the colder months so that you can keep the windows closed and mitigate the noise from the road and the trains.  Likewise, I think the rate is a bit high given what it is.  I have stayed at other Seattle Airbnb properties that are a fraction of this price that were almost like true B&B properties - copious information about the area, instructions for equipment, clean, etc.

It was a very unsettling evening for me since I brought along with me my 70-year-old stuck-in-his-habits father, ensuring him that everything was going to be perfect and comfortable.  It wasn't.  I was embarrassed and exhausted the next day from losing sleep over this anxiety."
4988679,45087475,2015-08-31,5542259,Lauren,"Maggie was fantastic and very accomodating towards us, the apartment was clean and was perfect for what we wanted. Maggie went out of her way to give us an earlier check in time."
4988679,45561903,2015-09-04,7616712,Jessica,"Maggie's place was a great place to stay! Only a short Uber trip away from Pike Place Market and from plenty of bars and restaurants. It was spotless, comfortable, well decorated, and left nothing to be desired. Maggie was very responsive to any questions. Would stay here again if I were to come back to Seattle."
4988679,45942958,2015-09-07,8015256,Darren,Everything was accurate about the listing. Great location and neighbourhood. 
4988679,46139360,2015-09-08,36762666,Julie,"This place was perfect! I stayed here to enjoy a night close to Seattle with my parents, who enjoyed this as well. The view was incredible! Comfortable beds, a lovely porch, good location and yummy coffee make for a nice place to stay. I have nothing bad to say, except that I wish I could've stayed longer!! "
4988679,46591686,2015-09-12,16282274,Tom,"Maggie's place is comfortable, clean and conveniently located.  The steps behind the building is a pleasant surprise to walk up the hill to Mercer street, a short walk to the Seattle Center and many great eateries. Maggie was easy to communicate with, she responded to our questions within minutes. We loved the location and the comfort, will definitely stay there next time!"
4988679,47048376,2015-09-15,38341884,Tracey,"Maggie's apartment was a great place to stay. Good location without being on top of everything. Easy access to downtown as well as further out of town.
The apartment was clean and comfortable,  with everything you need for your stay.
The only downside would be the outside noise earlyish in the morning,  if you are a light sleeper.
Maggie was easy to communicate with if needed."
4988679,47494919,2015-09-19,39177603,Anna,Maggie made it very easy for us to travel to a different city. Everything she did and said was great. 
4988679,47745326,2015-09-21,40329408,Meagan,"Maggie is easy to communicate with. She responds quickly and efficiently. Condo was exactly what we needed. Hard but comfortable beds, nice bathroom and shower and clean apartment  "
4988679,48546418,2015-09-27,41774173,Will,"Maggie was great. She sent over a bunch of info prior to my arrival which definitely made check-in a breeze. The apartment was just as described, and was stocked with everything we needed. She even left out some magazines/print outs for recommendations nearby. Maggie definitely gets a thumbs up. "
4988679,49794088,2015-10-06,42640137,Brian,"Maggie was very helpful in making our experience in Seattle a very memorable one. She sent us information for some places to visit while in town. Check in was very easy once we arrived in the city. Everything in the apartment was very exactly as it was in the pictures, with a great view of the water. The neighborhood was quiet and very enjoyable. Next time I come to Seattle, I will try to stay at Maggie’s again if possible!"
4988679,51277845,2015-10-19,34439294,Lisa,"Not only was this a clean, lovely apartment in a great location, Maggie was great to deal with.  She gave us all the info we needed to check in, gave us advice on parking and getting around the city, and responded promptly to our questions.  We would definitely stay there again if we ever get back to Seattle.    The place was spotless and having a washer and dryer was a real bonus!  We especially liked that we were able to open the windows to bring in the cool air even on rainy days.  Thanks, Maggie!"
7364024,40300718,2015-07-29,14371486,Andrew,Rick was a terrific host. He quickly responded to my inquiry and gave us good directions for getting to the #2 bus. Great place with lots of natural light. Rick helped us out in a pinch and we were  happy to be his first guests.
7364024,40855657,2015-08-02,33036946,Shirley,We had a good three days of sight seeing...Uber was best form of travel to downtown.
7364024,41184434,2015-08-04,7677793,Joel,"Rick was a great host! He met me at the house to show me around and pass of the key and we had a nice chat. He has a great place that is better than what you see in the photos. Excellent neighborhood, nice backyard, great price. Coffee in the morning at the push of a button pre-loaded by Rick was a nice touch. I hope to stay here again when I am in Seattle."
7364024,41669659,2015-08-08,14497898,Vincent,Rick was a very accommodating host. He kept in contact during the time leading up to the rental and the time that I was in the house. The house very nice; clean and comfortable. He was gracious to let me stay the last day past the check out time since I had an evening flight. I had the house to myself. The neighborhood was quiet. The weather was perfect. I had a very enjoyable visit.
7364024,42317067,2015-08-12,1015943,Greg,Quiet residential location (which was nice). Older building but pretty well maintained.  Overall a good deal for the price.  Rick was very responsive and communicative.  Thanks. 
7364024,42943250,2015-08-16,14519188,Rikita,"Infomations before visit are perfect. Receive house-key was no trouble.
Rooms & facilitis furnitures are clean and comfortable.
It’s easy to access( From Airport ,LRT and bus No.8 is the best).When you go out Bus No.8 is straight to Siattle Center ,and bus No.11 is transfer to Downtown.
Nice bakery restaurant(open at6am) and some nice restaurant are not so far.

7364024,44180910,2015-08-24,18170311,Bruce,Rick was friendly and responsive.  His place was clean and comfortable.  We'd stay there again (if we had an opportunity).
7364024,44840999,2015-08-29,41257735,Thibaut,Very nice and quiet half duplex. Not really close city center (around 4.5km to downtown). Thanks to Rick for all and specialy for preparing our late arrival.
7364024,46649897,2015-09-12,39728115,Ryan,The listing was accurate.  Rick was quick to respond and made our stay very comfortable. Thank you. 
7364024,49727042,2015-10-05,42787510,Wenjun(Vincent),The place is spacious and clean. Great for a family vacation. The place is about $15 uber ride to the downtown attractions which makes it convenient. 
4279578,22046490,2014-10-28,2515303,Erika,"My dad stayed in this beautiful little place while he was visiting me from out of state, and he absolutely loved it. He couldn't say enough about how warm and cozy it is, how incredible the location is, how helpful Donna was, and how he cannot wait to return for another stay. Regarding my own interactions with Donna (I booked it for my dad), she went out of her way to make everything perfect and comfortable for him...I absolutely recommend this awesome deal to anyone looking for an incredible location near the lake, a wonderful host, and adorable accommodations. "
4279578,22349789,2014-11-03,23152831,Alejandro,I love the location of the studio. It is so convenient if you want to visit Seattle's center or just go for a walk/run on Green Lake. It is quite and neat. An A+ experience definitively.
4279578,22637015,2014-11-10,20778558,Denise,We plan to come back again.  My husband and I stayed here for a late husky football game.  It was great. Clean with everything you would need.   Right on the bus line and a safe feeling neighborhood.   We didn't get to meet Donna but the communication was spot on.   We enjoyed the book she had on the history of Green Lake.
4279578,23055838,2014-11-21,18492801,Ned,"Wonderful apartment! Clean, cozy, lovely furniture, awesome bed. Great location basically across the street from Green Lake. All kinds of fun walkable restaurants, bars, outdoor activities. Donna has the place setup to perfection and is very easy to contact and provides first-class support. Highly recommended!"

The reserved parking space is so convenient and the unit was clean, cozy and comfortable. Will definitely book this again when visiting Seattle."
4279578,25289082,2015-01-11,22891094,Tom,Donna was a great host! It was our first time as AirBnB guests and she was very welcoming and patient with us. She made sure we were comfortable and at the same time respected our privacy.  Her place is clean and comfortable and in a wonderful location near the Green Lake. We would certainly go back! 
4279578,26646886,2015-02-16,1289077,Steve,"We're thrilled to have found this gem of a spot in Seattle. Donna responded to our inquiries quickly and made sure we had all the information we needed to make our arrival and stay easy and enjoyable. Having the off-street parking spot was great. The place is clean, comfortable and quiet. And the bed is comfortable! So much so that we wanted to find out what kind of matters it is so we could consider replacing ours at home. Can't recommend Donna and the place highly enough. We'll be staying again on future visits!"

The place is cute, cozy and clean, and communicating with Donna was very easy. 
Definitely recommended!"
4279578,33167304,2015-05-25,11216928,Mary,"I planned, rather last minute, to rendezvous with a friend on her overnight stay in Seattle. Donna was very quick to reply and very thorough with her replies, directions and explanations of certain situations at hand. Be aware of the short shower rule (worked out just fine for my friend and I, both of our showers were under eight minutes and the half hour between showers passed easily while we were getting ready) - and unfortunately the parking space that I had specifically booked this listing for was being re-paved at the time I visited - but you will have a brand new, re-done spot when you arrive! ;) 

Beyond those couple of wrinkles in the visit, Donna was extremely kind and helpful, provided suggestions when asked and made sure to accommodate me with an alternate parking spot as well as a late checkout time to make our stay perfect and convenient. The place was cute and clean, and the bed was extremely comfortable. 

Overall a very nice spot to stay and a sweet, helpful host. Thanks Donna! "
4279578,33947749,2015-06-02,5976482,Dana,"We stayed 4 nights in Donna's studio apartment after our arrival in Seattle from the east coast. The apartment is clean, cozy and quiet. Communication with Donna was quick and timely. The neighborhood is lovely, and easy walking distance to food, coffee shops and the lake. The pictures of the apartment represent the space just right. Thanks Donna - we had a lovely stay and we were so happy this was our introduction to Seattle!  "
4279578,34014215,2015-06-03,10769221,William,"This was a wonderful haven for my first-ever night in Seattle. Donna made everything clear and easy, and the room was delightful, comfortable and just right for one (or two) happy travelers. Loved the neighborhood, with the lake a great shared space surrounded by lovely residential streets and terrific restaurants and coffee shops. I'd love to go back. Sorry to be slow in reviewing; left the next day on a backroads/camping cross-country motorcycle trip! Thanks, Donna!"
4279578,34233051,2015-06-06,33516252,Jacob,"I stayed at Donna's Bright Green Lake studio from 6/2 to 6/5 and loved it. It was fully equipped with everything needed--e.g. A microwave, refrigerator and all of the supplies for the bathroom. The bed was comfortable, the apt. was clean and quiet. Donna was available if you needed anything. Her recommendations for places to eat were spot on esp. the Greenlake Bar and Grill. The best part is that you are located one block from Green Lake one of my favorite places in Seattle (I grew up here). I definitely would stay here again."
4279578,34578293,2015-06-09,4873557,Beth,My mother in law stayed with Donna on a visit to seattle. She commented several times on how charming and well equipped the space was. Thanks for hosting and providing a great seattle experience!

She is also from NC and both liked that about each other and she made it feel like home by putting a ""gone to Carolina in my mind"" pillow in the room. It was very convenient for where I needed to be and she made sure I had everything I needed."
4279578,35069777,2015-06-15,20044425,Sharon,The listing description was accurate and the place was as pictured. It was so convenient to have a private entry and the key code lock made it easy to check in. The instructions for the home were very clear and it helped make our stay comfortable. The home was clean and cozy! It was also very easy to communicate with Donna and she was always prompt with her replies. Would definitely stay here again!

Parking was RIGHT outside the door. Absolutely perfect in all ways. Donna was available via text for anything we needed, which was mainly advice on how to travel around town!  The front door lock system was super cool for you didn't have the concern of ""keys"".....A quick walk to Whole Foods made for a great breakfast ."

Very clean and welcoming studio in a pretty laid back Seattle Neighborhood. The studio was well furnished and you can tell a lot of thought went into everything. Donna made my first airbnb experience amazing!"
4279578,35990721,2015-06-23,4669248,Lucas,"My experience at Donna's studio was very nice. Parking was easy, it was a block away from Greenlake, and there was plenty of restaurants nearby. Her studio was also very clean and comfortable. And Donna was very easy to communicate with! I would recommend this place to anyone traveling to the Seattle area."
4279578,36704811,2015-06-30,22997201,Stephanie,This was my first trip to Seattle and Donna made us feel more than welcome in her home. She was extremely friendly and provided us with great suggestions of places to eat and things to do for the weekend - she also gave us some delicious blueberries that she picked! The downstairs studio was fully equipped with everything we needed for the weekend and it is very apparent that Donna takes great care of the place. The keyless entry was very convenient and we didn't have to worry about walking around with keys the whole weekend. The studio is in the perfect location with some great restaurants and coffee shops nearby and easy access via public transit to other parts of the city. The lake is one block away and made for the perfect morning run. I would love to come back to Seattle soon and would definitely want to stay in Donna's place again!
4279578,37107827,2015-07-04,16427391,Lyndsey,"Donnas studio was the perfect location for walking green lake and walking to any of the cute green lake restaurants/bars and coffee shops. The studio was exactly as described, small but cozy and clean. Perfect for 1 or 2 people. Check in was easy and seamless. Thank you Donna for the hospitality! "
4279578,37845787,2015-07-11,6048974,Kelly,"My husband and I had a wonderful experience at Donna's Green Lake studio. The location is fantastic!  It's close to so many restaurants and bars. Also, walking distance to grocery stores and practically anything else you would need. Then there's the lake!  Literally a block away is the beautiful Green Lake, complete with swimming, walking trails, gorgeous views and playground for kids.
We had a picnic on the grass, and enjoyed a leisurely walk around the lake one day. We bought inner tubes and floated on the lake one afternoon.

The room was small and simple, but felt safe and comfortable. It was very clean, and well stocked with basic toiletries, bottled water in the fridge and of course towels and linens.  The neighborhood was quiet and we slept very well.  It was so much better then a hotel! 
Donna was very prompt with replies to text messages.  Also, she was honest and thorough when communicating about her studio. 

We decided to save money and hassle by not renting a car for the week. We figured out the bus schedule the day we got there, and took it everyday into downtown. It cost $2.50 per person, each way. It took around 20-30 mins depending on the time of day.  We also walked a lot!  
It was a fun adventure, and I feel like we really got to experience Seattle!  "
4279578,38647282,2015-07-17,9658583,Veronica,"Situated in a nice and quiet neighborhood the place is just as advertised.  Neat, clean and easily accessible.  Donna was welcoming and provided all the right info to make the stay easy.  Would stay there again."
4279578,38988156,2015-07-20,4576224,Britt,"Donna's studio in Green Lake was the perfect spot for my recent trip to Seattle. The studio was clean, spacious, and had a ""home"" feeling. Access was easy, and Donna was helpful throughout the whole trip though we never met. Her recommendations of where to eat and get coffee were spot on. Also, the area - Green Lake - is the most incredible spot that's somewhat removed from the touristy section of Seattle. I enjoyed long walks around the lake every morning. I highly recommend staying at Donna's place on your visit!"
4279578,39992271,2015-07-27,37714306,Andrew,"Donna's studio was exactly as advertised, and a fantastic place to unwind and regroup after making our way through Seattle. The neighborhood is quiet and family-friendly, but also within striking distance of a lot of great late night spots elsewhere in the city. In short, it was the perfect balance for our stay. Green Lake is a beautiful (and very close) destination for a walk, but really, you can't go wrong strolling around anywhere in this neighborhood. "
4279578,40540626,2015-07-31,39653737,Adam,Donna's place was great! The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed for the few days we were in town. The apartment was in an awesome location - less than a block away from the lake. She was very accommodative even though we booked at the last minute.  We would definitely recommend Donna's place for anyone traveling to Seattle. 
4279578,40789719,2015-08-02,35727782,Clare,"Amazing place, super clean and incredible location.  Adjacent to the boat house for easy 1 minute walk to paddle boarding.  Parking is directly in front of the door.  Wonderful neighborhood for strolling and a great place missed by most tourists given no hotels.  Residential with cute shops, restaurants, coffee houses, bars, etc."
4279578,43050006,2015-08-17,34905488,Sato,"She was very welcoming and attentive in arriving at the location. The neighborhood was quite, which is surprising as it is a minute away from a major road. It was so relaxing to walk around the Greenlake after a long busy day."
4279578,43423036,2015-08-19,32583781,Matus,"Donna's studio was perfect for our stay in Seattle to visit friends. She made us feel very welcome with great directions on how to get there and park, and the space was well-lit and welcoming. The studio is in a perfect location with easy access to Green Lake and restaurants and shops plus a quick trip to Downtown. We would definitely stay here again."
4279578,44321951,2015-08-25,18425826,Bill,"Great location, very comfortable and convenient to some nice restaurants, a great supermarket and Green Lake. Donna was a fantastic host, providing immediate response to any questions I had leading up to my stay, as well as being very accommodating while I was there.  Strongly recommend!!!"
4279578,45122397,2015-08-31,39721452,Alba,The host was amazing.  Everything in the description was accurate and she adds touches to make you feel at home.  She included a rain jacket in the closet (which you will probably need) and a flashlight that was very useful on our night walks around the lake.  The neighborhood was very peaceful and safe.  We had a great time.  
4279578,47044744,2015-09-15,37792273,Barbara,"i was in Seattle for the first time to attend a wedding by myself.  This private entrance rental is 1/2 block from Green Lake Park in a safe area with jogging, biking, tennis, swimming, shops and restaurants galore. it enabled me to enjoy all the downtown sights  by day (without the exorbitant downtown hotel prices) and stroll the charming Green Lake area in the evening. the bus stops right outside every 10 minutes and is downtown in 15 minutes where you can easily connect with the Link Rail Train to the airport. The quiet room and bathroom were immaculate and the bed very comfortable. the delightful hostess answered all my questions promptly.  If ever in Seattle again, I would choose to stay here even if not attending a wedding in the Green Lake neighborhood."
4279578,47221373,2015-09-16,9968533,Nadya,I reserved this Airbnb for a visiting guest.  It was in perfect proximity to my own apartment and very close to Greenlake's main attractions.  Donna quickly responded to my request and had a perfect space for my guest.  When I have more visitors I will contact Donna about this unit again.  
4279578,48225913,2015-09-24,6287820,Tim,"What a great stay!  I was in Seattle for 10 days for work and really enjoyed my stay at Donna's.  She is a fantastic host and really went above and beyond to make me feel at home and comfortable.  The place is perfect; simple, great neighborhood, easy check-in and check-out, literally a block from Green Lake and short walk to great restaurants, bars, shopping, and fitness.  Parking spot was key for me and it is a short drive to both I5 and 99 for those who need to head north or South for work.  I would recommend this place to anyone."
4279578,48817604,2015-09-28,1016687,Felicia,"Great studio in a great neighborhood. Right next to Greenlake Park, a bunch of cafes and restaurants within walking distance. Very detailed directions by the host and everything was in perfect order. Great communication and flawless booking. Would definitely stay again as this was a great alternative to staying in Downtown Seattle. Very clean, well organized, and a great neighborhood. Very much enjoyed our stay with the amenities provided and all the extra information neatly organized in a binder. Perfect!"
4279578,49290356,2015-10-02,13376402,Tom,Donna was extremely helpful and asked several times if there was anything else I needed during my stay. 
4279578,50056796,2015-10-08,6845232,Amber,"Wonderful, very clean, she obviously goes to alot of effort to make things perfect."

Very gracious and thourough."
4279578,51173347,2015-10-18,44932552,Alyssa,"I absolutely adored staying at Donna's! The apartment was not very far away from SIOM, where I was visiting, and it was very well kept and beautiful! Donna provided everything that I could possibly need, and she was easy to get in contact with if I needed anything, which was greatly appreciated!"
4279578,52136961,2015-10-26,7880851,Gianluca,"The communication with Donna was prompt and flawless, getting to the place very easy.
The place was clean, nice and very quiet. We loved it!"

4279578,57123562,2015-12-22,2946874,Nicole,"Donna's place is perfect!  

So comfy and cozy.  My MIL reported back that the bed was heavenly and she slept so well there.

Donna is an excellent communicator - so very thoughtful and thorough. We felt very prepared for my MIL's stay and very well cared for.  

The location is excellent and we ought to know as we live a few blocks away.  For anyone in the ever expanding apartment landscape that is green lake who has family and friends visiting, this is the spot!

There are well stocked bathroom amenities, a luxe robe and big, fluffy towels in the bathroom.  The fridge is stocked with water.  Wifi, drawers for storage  and cable TV rounded out the experience and gave us just what we needed to get my MIL settled in and comfortable.

The parking spot is a terrific bonus as well.  

We hope to book this spot frequently in the future as it's just ideal fro one or two people to stay comfortably.

Thank you, Donna!  You're amazing.

7666155,42984267,2015-08-16,807481,Adama,"Ben's apartment is an oasis in the heart of bustling Capitol Hill. The location is perfect in its proximity to everything. The apartment is beautifully decorated and comfortable. 

Although I didn't meet Ben, he came across as a warm and kind person. Super responsive, easy-going and accommodating (allowing for a late check out on Sunday). 

If ever you get to Seattle, I would highly recommend a stay here."
1702092,14542439,2014-06-21,2479220,Kevin,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in the Woodland Park Suite.  Location was very handy to transport and food options, and the suite was well appointed.  Sarah`s hospitality was great - and I really appreciated the flexibility given my short-notice booking.  Thank you."
1702092,34337310,2015-06-07,19235033,Billy,Had a wonderful stay up in Fremont. Lovely space with a very convenient location to fun neighborhoods. Would definitely stay here again. Thank you!
1702092,37712694,2015-07-09,22100477,Christine,"Sarah was a great host. She welcomed us upon arriving and showed us around our apartment. The place is lovely - comfortable, clean, quiet, updated and modern. The location is amazing too - it was easy to get where we needed to go from her central location. We would stay here again. Thanks Sarah!"
1702092,42542270,2015-08-14,35641516,Deirdre,We had a great stay at Woodland Suite.  The suite was designed really well and offered  great privacy.  The location was great - close to lots of playgrounds and the zoo of course.........all important with a 4 year old.  I will definitely look this one up again on our next trip to Seattle.  Sometimes I groan when I hear a pull-out couch but this one was great and we have the exact same in our house!  Thank you thank you.
1702092,46808919,2015-09-13,2098828,New,"We had a fantastic time at the Woodland Park Suite!  Sarah has thought of everything and the apartment is designed to a high standard!  She even so kindly provided a pack and play for our 7 month old, which made things easier for us.  Neighbourhood is great and apartment had everything you needed and more.  
Sarah and her husband are lovely people and made you feel welcome.  We would stay again in a heartbeat!"
1702092,52580702,2015-10-31,12867960,Maureen,"I stayed at Woodland Park Suite for an extended period (1 mo+) and would rate is as the best airbnb location I've stayed at since joining 3 years ago. Everything about the listing is accurate and the suite has all accommodations you need with a great amount of space. Sarah and her family make you feel very welcome and were so helpful throughout the entire stay. The neighborhood is great with easy access to grocery stores and a 2 min walk from the bus stop. 

I would definitely recommend staying here, whether for a weekend or extended stay. It's the perfect amount of space with everything you need in a great location. "
7435912,44972350,2015-08-30,21508200,Benjamin,"Host was great, responsive and flexible.  The location is near cafe's and restaurants and walking distance to downtown.  The place did not feel like it was worth the $120 a night fee, so I would not repeat the experience for that amount - but I would for a more reasonable amount."
7435912,45850267,2015-09-06,29747559,Iris,"Arnaud was a great host. 
We were in town for a music fest and it started pouring, he left us an umbrella to use. 
The space was great. The room was very comfortable and it was nice that it had it's own private bathroom. Everything was clean. 
Arnaud lives a few blocks away from great bars and restaurants. You're a 15 minutes bus ride away from downtown. 
Arnaud was very flexible about checking in and out, I would stay here again."
7435912,47222877,2015-09-16,39834783,Marco,"Arnaud is great guy, very helpful. His place very clean, simple but comfortable.
Great location right in the middle of Capitol Hills but away from all the noise.
Having parking included with the room is a huge plus. I'll definitely come back."

Matthew, our host, was a star  - communicative, organized, friendly, and just the right amount of help without being 'too much'.  The room is perched on the top floor - windows to the trees, comfortable bed, great bathroom.  We will be back. . . . . ."

The room was super clean and overlooks a terrarium-like group plush green vegetation on one side. Very zen! Kitchen, like the rest of the house is newly painted and spotless. 

The neighborhood is wonderful! A gorgeous, tree lined affair, it also has a great park, an amazing cafe (Volunteer Park Cafe for breakfast and excellent coffee YUM!) and is also close to a couple of buses. "
2670365,34813663,2015-06-12,33067825,Jay,"Matthew was a great host and very helpful and was available for any questions we had. The house was beautiful and so was the neighborhood.

I will have no doubts in staying in his house again.
"
2670365,35413383,2015-06-18,34960288,Su,"Mathew is a wonderful host. He was interesting and interested and helpful but not intrusive. We found his home spacious, relaxing and spotlessly clean, as was our room. We loved the Capital Hill area and it's quiet eateries. Street paring was easy and bus to the wider City frequent and inexpensive."
2670365,35823287,2015-06-22,34005195,Rebecca,Our stay was great! This was our first time using airbnb and won't we our last. Matt was a wonderful host and very easy going. Beautiful home and beautiful area! 
2670365,36038684,2015-06-24,1511782,John,"A nice room in a beautiful, recently renovated home. The neighborhood is quiet and picturesque; the house is a short walk from Volunteer Park (be sure to climb the water tower!). 15 mins walk to coffee/drinks. 45 mins walk to downtown. The local bus network has several options. Matthew was very helpful, ensuring we had everything we needed. "
2670365,36312486,2015-06-27,4525854,Yu (Jade),"Matthew made an exceptional welcome to me: he actually gave me a ride to his home from the airport!  His place is meticulously clean and comfortable.  The neighborhood is beautiful and I loved my walk to the bus stop.   Matthew is the perfect host who made me feel right at home.  I will come back again next time I am in Seattle.  Thank you so much for everything, Matthew!
"
2670365,36888830,2015-07-02,2172825,Mevelyn,"Matthew was a great host, warm, easy going, and quick to reply to our many queries.  His home is exactly as shown on Airbnb, charmingly renovated.

The house was clean and the bathroom perfect for us. Matthew was helpful and welcoming, providing us with ideas of things to do and restaurants to check out. He also went above and beyond to text us after we left with suggestions for Portland and the Oregon coast, knowing that was our next destination. "
2670365,38507770,2015-07-16,334973,Eddie,"matthew is such a fantastic host! i really lucked out on staying with him. he's warm and outgoing, introduced me to local friends and had thoughtful recommendations for new things to do (this was my  4th time in seattle). i appreciate his clean aesthetic and he has done a remarkable job renovating his house. 

i opted to stay a bit away from ""downtown"" but everything is super accessible. whether you're a walker, bus or uber type of person, his house isn't far from the action. as a runner, i liked being able to get up and run directly thru a park vs weaving thru traffic to hit the trail. his neighbourhood is quiet, safe and 2 blocks from coffee! :)

the room has two great windows that allow tons of light in and provide a nice breeze for warmer months. the bed is amazing. the washroom is tidy.

his room is across the hall and he works from home, but matthew is conscientious and respectful of privacy and quiet time. i tried to return the favour altho i probably interrupted him more often than he needed! 

i can honestly say this airbnb experience was one of the best. definitely left seattle behind with great memories and new friends, thanks to matthew. i would wholeheartedly recommend him as a host. a big thanks also for scoring me some bubble rap and a box to protect the yard art i found in ballard!"
2670365,38740670,2015-07-18,17977632,Kevin,Matthew's place on Cap Hill was exactly as described. The home is within walking distance to Cap Hill dining and shopping. A short Uber ride and you are in the heart of downtown Seattle. Matthew's place was clean and the bed was comfortable. My wife and I would not hesitate to stay at Matthew's place again.
2670365,39085434,2015-07-20,34710498,Emma,"Matthew is a great host. He let us drop off our bags early and took them up to our room for us so they were there when we got in. We were able to come back and fetch our bags after checkout so we didn't have to have them in the car while we were at brunch. He also caught the bottle of witch hazel I had forgotten in the bathroom!

The room had plenty of power outlets so we could charge our phones. And there was a fan provided, which was a blessing in the middle of a heat wave. 

The house itself is beautiful, retaining it's original character, but with the modern touches one would want. "
2670365,39942112,2015-07-27,34794076,Holly,Matthew was easy going and generous with his space.  
2670365,41107386,2015-08-04,32728006,Janet,Matthew was a great host from the time of booking to the end of the visit. He has a beautiful home and made both my boyfriend and I feel very welcome and comfortable. He was very accommodating to our early check in and allowed us to store our bags after the regular check out time. We really appreciated that. Matthew was very helpful with providing us with tips and recommendations of where to eat and what to do around town. We had a great visit and enjoyed our stay very much. I highly recommend booking with Matthew and would book with him again.
2670365,42135685,2015-08-11,35492928,Rachel,"Matthew was not in town for our visit but he was still very responsive with any questions we had during our stay including where to eat at 10p when we arrived. 

His home is absolutely beautiful and the room we stayed in was spacious and comfortable. If you forget any amenities, don’t fret, because Matt has a small supply of toiletries in the guest bathroom too. His home is located near a park and local café where we had breakfast every morning called Volunteer Park Café. 19th street is also only a block away where there are nice restaurants, a homey general store, and a Walgreens. 

We absolutely enjoyed our stay and pretending we were locals for a weekend.  
"
2670365,42470827,2015-08-13,526488,Greg,Matthew was a great host and his house is incredible. It's very well-kept and evident that he pours a lot of love into it. The neighborhood is picturesque and not too far from Lake Union and lots of entertainment in Capitol Hill.

2670365,45664711,2015-09-05,1788432,Rene,"My parents spent two nights in the upstairs bedroom in Matthews house while the rest of the family was in the downstairs rental.  The downstairs is top notch if you are looking for private or more space. 

Anyways, this house is beautiful and very well maintained.  My father noted on multiple occasions how comfortable the bed was.  The neighborhood is a great place to explore from with many places that can be reached by foot or public transportation a block away.  Matthew was a welcoming host and easy to communicate with making it an overall enjoyable experience."
2670365,46167902,2015-09-08,8121456,Antonio,"We loved Mathew's house! Everything was just as described in the listing (if not better). The house was very clean, the room was great - it smelled awesome and he put some fresh cut flowers in the room. We had our own bathroom and loved the tranquility of the neighborhood. We loved how accessible his place was to Capitol Hill, the freeways, and also to Downtown Seattle - we would gladly stay with Mathew again!"
2670365,47175940,2015-09-16,15841728,Ami,"Matthew is a very kind host, me and my sister had a late night flight back to our country and he didn't ask us to check out earlier instead provide another room for me and my sister to rest until our Uber car coming, besides my crazy bro order a lots of shopping items to Matthew's house before I arrive there, Matthew take care those items for me! Actually he doesn't have to do it, but he stand on our side to make us like staying at home! I will 100% recommend my friends or my family to stay at his at their visit to Seattle! Btw, the bed is really really comfortable, good for travelers! "
2670365,47714505,2015-09-21,40826689,Shirley,"We love Matthew’s house!  It has all the old school charm, yet very modern and stylish design! Location can’t be beat, very close to Seattle University, and all of the downtown attractions are just a few minutes car ride away.  Matthew was a gracious host, he gave us our space, yet checked in on us to make sure we have everything we need.  We cannot ask for a more perfect place to prepare for my daughter’s school year.  We will definitely stay with Matthew again!"
2670365,48189325,2015-09-24,10258121,Craig,"Wonderful house. Spotless, organized, stylish, clean. In a very green neighborhood of big old beautiful homes. Easy parking. Near a great park and neighborhood cafe. Matthew is a great host - professional and knowledgable of Seattle and Portland. Would return again hands down. Great access in the Capitol Hill area.  Lovely bed to sleep on. Thanks Matthew!"
2670365,48543463,2015-09-27,36583749,Xing,Matthew is a great host that I would recommend. He was always easy to reach when our check in plans changed and he was very friendly when speaking with him and told us where is the restaurant and grocery store. He even shared another room to us when he knew our two kids was accompany with us.
2670365,49116946,2015-10-01,25474704,Mary,"My boyfriend and I stayed with Matthew for four nights and loved our stay! The neighborhood was beautiful! We were close  to shops, bus stops, and Volunteer Park, and felt safe walking through the neighborhood even late at night. Matthew was a great host, very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. His home is gorgeous, and the shower was phenomenal! We would definitely stay with Matthew again! "
2670365,49815522,2015-10-06,29642545,Susan,"This is a wonderful place to stay in Seattle. It is located in a walkable, leafy neighborhood of stately older homes, but only a few blocks away from stores, restaurants, and the beautiful Volunteer Park. Matthew is a charming host and responded immediately to all communications, which made the reservation process a breeze. The house is stylish and immaculate, the bed is comfortable, and parking is easy ( and free). What a gem."
2670365,49946988,2015-10-07,45458892,Chris,"My wife and I stayed at Matthew's house in Capitol Hill while in Seattle for the Seahawks game on Monday night. Traveling from Vancouver, BC and familiar with the area, we were looking forward to a different experience other than the usual downtown hotel. (Hotel rates were also double than normal considering it was a big game).  We arrived early  and were able to check in and change for the game. It was a beautiful day so we decided to walk through Volunteer Park on our way downtown. It only took 30-40 minutes to get to the Hyatt where my brother and his wife were staying. Seattle is a very walkable city.

Matthew's house is a heritage classic and looks like it was recently renovated. It is tastefully decorated and comfortable. The only downside is that the neighboring houses are very close together. However, it was very quiet even with the school across the street.

The house was very clean and we met the professional cleaner upon our arrival. Matthew obviously cares for his home and we appreciate that he shared it with us during our visit to Seattle.

We visited a cafe on 15th street that he suggested for breakfast and had a nice meal before heading home.

Thanks again Matthew! I would highly recommend your home to other travelers."

2670365,50976284,2015-10-16,3577067,Brock,"My wife and I had a fantastic stay here. The house is flawlessly maintained and decorated. The upstairs room and queen bed are perfectly comfortable. We enjoyed the proximity to Capitol Hill's parks, coffee shops, bars, and restaurants. It's a great neighborhood for walking and jogging. Street parking is no problem if you have a car. Finally, Matthew is a superb, welcoming host. We'd definitely stay here again."

2670365,51781683,2015-10-24,15020004,Alexis,Matthew was quick to answer questions and help us book our stay in Seattle! His house is in a beautiful neighborhood near a cute school with plenty of parking. Matthew was flexible and accommodating. Our bedroom was not only staged but smelt lovely. I could have snuggled under the bed sheets for hours. Clean and comfortable. Thanks Matthew! 
2670365,52345893,2015-10-28,33807503,Lisa,"Home was beautiful and clean. Neighborhood was adorable -- a bit of a hike by foot to downtown, but a very quick uber to most parts of the city. Keyless entry made the stay really easy. "

The room was beautiful and comfortable. We had everything we needed and he recommended intresting things to see around the town. We weren't in the house often due to an event in Tacoma but I couldn't have asked for asked better stay! I definitely recommend and would stay here again!"
2670365,53191741,2015-11-06,1572010,Anya,"I had a great experience at Matthew's place. He was out of town, so his friend/fellow Airbnb host helped us out. Easy to find from the airport (exceptional directions were given), great neighborhood and cozy, welcoming space! I thought the location was perfect---quiet with good restaurants/bars about 10 min walk away. Matthew's house was beautiful, but comfortable. "
2670365,54908059,2015-11-25,48264690,Mariko,Mathew was very nice and very welcoming! It was a great place to stay! Great house and great space! Location was amazing. It was my first time in Seattle and I was able to see all the sites very easily from this location. It's a beautiful neighborhood. This was my first air bnb stay and it was a wonderful experience  :)
2670365,55273616,2015-11-29,559331,Carol,Matthew's friend Christopher made me feel very welcome. The location was perfect for me. I was quite comfortable there. Will definitely try to reserve it the next time I need to be in Seattle and need a place to stay.
2670365,55698134,2015-12-04,32142944,Jason,"Very nice place in a great area, recently remodeled in very good taste. We spent very little time in the house because we were on the run, but Matt was a great host. "

2670365,57132320,2015-12-22,34405253,Jason,"Great host with a beautiful home in a wonderful area of Seattle. Easy to walk to a variety of restaurants, bars, grocery stores etc and still be in a quiet residential neighborhood when you return. Room itself is meticulously decorated as is the rest of the house; towels/shampoo etc all provided. The heated floors are pretty awesome too. Matthew is great about accommodating whatever your arrival time might be and was a pleasure to chat with. This was a perfect location if you're interviewing down at UW for any reason. I'd highly recommend it and will certainly stay here again if I'm back in Seattle."
2670365,58404761,2016-01-02,51264572,Lisa,"This B&B is better than  a 5 star hotel.  It was absolutely beautiful inside and meticulously restored.  We loved this house.  Our host, Mathew, was very helpful and while he was out of town when we arrived, he still ensured someone was there to great us.  The location is also fantastic and within a few blocks of great restaurants and boutique shops.  On a final note, the bed was very comfortable and the linens good quality.  We will definitely be back and would recommend this place to anyone."

6004058,31233618,2015-05-03,19283318,Dana,"Marina’s Queen Ann studio was just as described; the place was small but clean, cozy, and comfortable.  Marina left a basket with helpful info, maps, and tissues. The apartment is in a great neighborhood close to downtown and Kerry Park with a beautiful view of the city.  

Marina gave us our privacy but was very responsive and helpful whenever we texted.  Overall, a great trip to Seattle!
"
6004058,33151436,2015-05-25,1911621,Alexis,"The description was accurate - the suite is very similar to a hotel room, but was the perfect size for our visit.

The location worked well, but it would have been nice to be a little closer to coffee shops and amenities. The building is very quiet and relaxed. "
6004058,34213590,2015-06-06,19359483,Becki,Very nice place! Cozy with a fantastic location.
6004058,34958147,2015-06-14,23496987,Judith,Mariana makes you feel very welcome.  The apartment was very clean and nicely decorated.  Perfect location for my visit to Seattle.  
6004058,36408316,2015-06-28,553007,Holly,"This airy studio had all the amenities and the most amazing view from the spacious patio. Walking distance to downtown and offering killer views this property was more than I could have hoped for. Our hostess was more than helpful and left everything a visitor could need, whether staying for one night or more. I cannot recommend this property highly enough!"
6004058,37981463,2015-07-12,22499900,Andrea,"This is a great location just a few minutes' walk from Queen Anne and Key Arena. There is free parking. The apartment is a studio, so it's small, but Marina sets it up beautifully and it is clean and comfortable. Marina was great about communicating with us to give us information and helpful directions to the place. "
6004058,38954954,2015-07-19,8190421,Adam,"Great place! Clean, comfortable bed. Great location!"
6004058,39966022,2015-07-27,6965616,Margaret,The apt is adorable! It's clean and cozy. Perfect stay if you plan on just sleeping there. Checking in and out was a breeze. Looking forward to visiting again!
6004058,40596659,2015-08-01,3537849,Briana,"Marina made us feel super welcome and was great at communicating! The place was just as described, perfect for one or two people for a short stay, and in a great location! ESPECIALLY perfect for heading over to the port for cruises early in the morning - it was a 10 minute ride! Also walking distance to the space needle. We loved our stay here! "
6004058,41822097,2015-08-09,11005411,Tara,"The location was amazing - beautiful views and an easy walk to so many restaurants and attractions.

The place is great as well. Marina really did a fantastic job of keeping the area spacious and light. 

Marina was very accommodating and caring, and made us feel at home."
6004058,44059382,2015-08-23,13512660,Stephanie,"We had an amazing time visiting Seattle for the weekend and couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. This adorable studio apartment was small but so well organized we never felt cramped. The Amazing use of space. The building itself was beautiful and felt so comfortable to come home to.
The apartment has a bus stop across the street which easily takes you downtown. And while you wait you get an amazing view of the Space Needle! It's breathtaking. Or you can walk around the Queen Anne area which is full of adorable shops, cute cafes and amazing restaurants. There's something for everyone. 
In summary, great space, very welcoming host and we would definitely recommend it!!"
6004058,44930272,2015-08-30,27230942,Julie,"This place was decent and just as described. As stated, it's small but has everything you need for a short stay. My only complaint is that the apartment gets pretty warm, with no air conditioning."
6004058,45119937,2015-08-31,38961660,Joy,Cute hotel style studio with everything you need for your stay. Love the historical feel of the place!  Host was very accommodating and check-in was a breeze. Steps away from the bus stop and a short walk to the Seattle center. Overall a good experience! 
6004058,46782491,2015-09-13,6391228,Elina,Very clean and conveniently located studio that meets all your basic needs. The host is very easy to communicate with and accommodating with the check in/out process. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Seattle. 
6004058,48646907,2015-09-27,2519446,Joel,"Place was great. Totally quiet at night! Its like we were the only people there and no noise from the street. Studio was small but clean and cozy. Love the old building and the claw foot tub. Location was a little far away from things walking, and up a hill for those biking, but not too bad. We had a communication breakdown right when we were checking in, but it all worked out."
6004058,49631934,2015-10-05,18990958,Annie,"Location was great and is within walking distance or a short bus ride/car ride to Kerry Park, Space Needle and Pike Place. There is also a great view from the apartment itself. Neighborhood felt very safe and was quiet. Room is cozy and is perfect for one or 2 people. It was also very clean and had everything we needed. Marina was a great host, super friendly and was very fast to respond. Check in/check out was very easy and the flexible hours were convenient for us. Would recommend to anybody needing a place to stay in Seattle!"
6004058,51017020,2015-10-17,39938930,Madelyn T,"Great neighborhood, but the ""patio"" photo was misleading. There was no table and chair(s) - you have to climb out a window onto a roof that can be accessed by several other windows, so limited privacy.
It would have been helpful to know before booking that there was no coffee maker, toaster, or microwave and that parking can be difficult.
Comfy bed, though."
6004058,54228180,2015-11-16,10895975,Blake,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6004058,58411660,2016-01-02,6848429,Joy,"Marina's place was perfect for us - compact, but with everything we needed, in a charmingly converted hotel building. Check-in and out was easy, Marina was a great host!"
4297068,22117748,2014-10-30,1382241,Alex & Mari,"Chris' 3 floor unit is a treasure in rainy Seattle. It feels like home. Everything is new. Everything works. If you have a dog - it's perfect, because there's a decent park cross the street and you don't need to break your head thinking where to walk your pet. Location is good too, there's a general store in the next building. Parking is forever free and always available. Definitely recommending this beautiful home to anybody staying in Seattle. It's exactly what you need."
4297068,23377473,2014-11-30,22701309,Cinty,"I stayed in the Chris's house for a month with others 3 friends. The house is small but with a really good location. Also the house is so pretty with all the services and many bus routes pass near there. In general the place is quiet and safe. We enjoyed a lot our stay in Seattle and rent this house was the best election because the price was good and the house was perfect.
The neighbors are friendly. Also Chris is an excelent host who  helped us with advices and fast answers about our questions. We definitelly recomend this house :)"
4297068,25713771,2015-01-24,5973736,Adam,"This is a great home in a great neighborhood. I highly recommend this space to anyone who is traveling to Seattle and looking for a modern, spacious and well located home to stay in. Everything went very smoothly!"
4297068,39048140,2015-07-20,14658569,Matt,"Chris was a welcoming and helpful host. The townhouse was nice with hardwood throughout. The hardwood gave the townhouse a very sturdy and grounding atmosphere. Having a second bathroom made the stay for our group of four much easier, as my brother loves to spend time primping in the bathroom. Although the area surrounding didn't have a large amount of options, there are a couple of nice coffee shops within a block or two. Also, the International District is a short drive and has plenty of mind blowing options (stick to the strip malls to avoid the more Americanized options). 
Unfortunately, we were there during an unseasonably hot July, the townhouse does not have a/c, and the series of fans was not enough to keep us cool. However, I lived in Seattle for about a decade and never had a/c in an apartment, normally you don't need it but 1-2 weeks out of the year (if that).
Finally, Chris showed alacrity for dealing with problems when the water throughout the townhouse turned brown one morning from some nearby construction. Chris made all the necessary calls (to the city no less) and gave us a timeline when we could expect it to get better. He is very good at communicating. 
I am tempted to take off a star for the lack of a/c, but since that amenity is so unusual in Seattle, it would not be fair."
4297068,39965614,2015-07-27,1401740,Timon,"Chris's house was really nice and the description how to find the house how to get in was flawless. The house is perfect for two couples visiting Seattle. Its a walk or really short uber drive ($5 ) away from Capitol Hill which has really nice restaurants and places to hang out. 
Wifi is super fast. Apartment was very clean. Beds are comfortable. 2 Full bathrooms which is a real luxury. Best thing though was Chris reads basically all the books we read so it would have been nice to meet and chat in person because we would have connected but this way it was a perfect airbnb experience none the less"
4297068,55343789,2015-12-01,6628867,Mark,"Cold Thanksgiving weekend trip, but this house made it warm! Visited some family up in Seattle and got an amazing deal. This place end up behind my sis in-laws house so quick walk to see the family. Bonus quick uber or lyft ride to Canon which has the best cocktails in town. Condo is three stories and has heated floors in the master bath. Super spacious for Seattle compared to other places. Bed is super soft. Two tubs, master is super deep so perfect for soaking. Chris was cool too, hooked us up with some local cookie dough. It was pretty good. Book it! You won't regret. "
4279876,21445149,2014-10-17,18757232,Chris,"Neighborhood was great, lots of interesting restaurants and shops right near by.  Beth was super accommodating, giving us a laundry list of great places to checkout while we were there.  This place is a steal compared to most listings on here!"
4279876,21641227,2014-10-20,9521246,Benjamin,"Beth and her husband made us feel welcome and were quick to communicate. The apartment was perfect, clean and accommodating. The bed was very comfortable. Internet was fast and basic cable was nice to have. It is in a nice neighborhood with lots to do within walking distance and close to all the things I enjoy about Seattle. We had a great time and felt very welcome. "
4279876,21732701,2014-10-22,207449,Chiara,"WOW. what a wonderful house !!!
super clean & well equipped. in a very calm and silent zone but really close to a lot of cool bar&risto, just 15 minutes by car to Seattle downtown. beth&pierce are very helpful and kind. 
definitely recommended  "
4279876,21916478,2014-10-26,12305475,Ramona,Beth was very nice and made sure we would be comfortable in the home. I enjoyed staying at the home which had temperature controls in every room and clean comfy bedrooms. The kitchen and bathrooms were also well stocked with everything that we needed.
4279876,22330601,2014-11-03,5575173,Anthony,"What a great place to stay!  Beth and Pierce were friendly and welcoming, allowing us to feel right at home.  Booking process was super easy because of their prompt and clear communication.  We had a fantastic anniversary weekend thanks to their hospitality and their great flat!  It is just as described and in an awesome part of Seattle.  We loved exploring the surrounding communities and the quiet neighborhoods were great for some morning jogs.  Beth and Pierce also had great recommendations for local fare and points of interest.  We would absolutely recommend this place for your stay in Seattle!"
4279876,22551245,2014-11-09,23013262,Simon,"Great tips and very thorough with the information. Large place, good amenities, close to lots of cool places. Thanks!"
4279876,22799635,2014-11-15,22169201,Mateo,"Beth and Pierce were nothing less than stellar hosts!  Communication from the beginning inquiry to the very last day was prompt, courteous, informative, friendly and helpful.  I stayed at their Seattle Sunnyside Suite in Wallingford for my initial week transitioning to a new job and relocation to Seattle (my parents happened to be visiting for this same week as well).  The Suite is private, spacious, super clean, cozy and comfortable.  Beth and Pierce were even generous enough to allow us use of their outdoor furniture and fire pit to enjoy...although the night temperatures ended up to be a bit too chilly to put it to good use.  

This was my first official Airbnb experience in the U.S. and both my parents and I would definitely recommend a stay here to friends, family...and you!  Cheers"
4279876,23115775,2014-11-23,3126509,Damien,Beth and Pierce were incredible hosts and offered us a few local eateries and bars that were great. They were very understanding when I made an error on the reservation and we both helped remedy the issue quickly. Great location and a quick drive to Ballard. 
4279876,23328568,2014-11-29,22766720,Shelli,The Wallingford area is great!  This property was spacious and very clean.  Well stocked kitchen with everything you need.  Beth was a wonderful host and very helpful.
4279876,24078145,2014-12-19,21543939,Mariposa,Beth and Pierce were great hosts and were easy to contact and responded quickly.  I stayed here with another family member while visiting in Seattle. The location was great. Wallingford is a fun neighborhood and there is easy access to the rest of what Seattle offers given its the proximity to I5. The apartment was very comfortable and had everything we needed.  Would definitely recommend it. 
4279876,24485482,2014-12-29,18842569,Nancy,"My husband, adult daughter and I really enjoyed our stay at the Sunyside Suite. We were in Seattle to spend Christmas with our son and his fiancé.  The apartment made a homey place to be together and relax. The apartment was very clean and spacious.  The bedrooms were large with large closets and the beds were comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked with dishes and pots and pans. We made both Christmas Eve and Christmas day dinner as well as some breakfasts at the apartment.  

The apartment is located in a great neighborhood with some fun restaurants, bars and ice cream. There is a great grocery nearby.  It is not far to downtown Seattle or the university area. Beth and Pierce have made a book with some great recommendations. 

They were very accommodating and we would definitely stay here again on a future visit to Seattle. 

"
4279876,24658945,2015-01-01,2872052,Jordan,"This is a nice, simple and cozy spot near the heart of Wallingford. There are lots of restaurants, it's close to the highway and there are many other neighborhoods that are easy to get to. There is a book with a lot of recommendations of great places to go to. If you've never been to Seattle, the guide is perfect for you. 
Beth was out of town while we were staying there, but she was great about replying to messages and addressing any questions or concerns we had. Very helpful.
The only slightly strange thing was the amount of clean up required of attendants. It seemed like quite a bit more then any other Airbnb I've been to. You'll be charged a $50 fee if it's not all completed. However, our mess was pretty minimal, so it was manageable for us. "
4279876,25085972,2015-01-06,23222282,Kristen,"The Sunnyside Suite was A+!! Would stay there again any time I go to Seattle. You get a lot for the price....super clean, tidy, easy off street parking, very convenient to walk to a ton of great restaurants/bars or 1 minute to freeway. Comfy beds and pillows, nice bathroom, well appointed kitchen, comfy sofas, big dining table - easy to work at with good light...all in all really a great place. And I'm picky! "
4279876,25390765,2015-01-14,7274055,Shing,"Beth's place was great.  2 bedrooms, a full kitchen, dining room, living room, etc.  Everything you need to make yourself feel at home away from home.  Wallingford is one of the best locations in Seattle.  Close enough to downtown and the tourist sights, yet it has its own charm that doesn't need any help.  Lots of restaurants, bars, grocery store, etc. within walking distance.  With a private parking spot, you couldn't ask for more."
4279876,25497473,2015-01-18,9953988,Bridget,"Great apartment- comfortable beds and furniture, kitchen good for cooking, etc. Beth and Pierce were helpful in finding hikes and restaurants in the area ( among other things). Location is great. Enjoyed our stay immensely!"
4279876,25825535,2015-01-26,564715,Gini,"The apartment was spacious, light, and airy feeling.  I was even lucky enough to enjoy some rare sunny Seattle days while staying on Sunnyside Avenue.  I definitely appreciated that the kitchen was well stocked with significantly better-than-airbnb-average flatware, dishes, cookware, and utensils.  Both beds were quite comfortable and I am very picky because of a long history of back issues.  The apartment was quiet and peaceful even though it's only less than a block from the bustling main drag in Wallingford.  The walk to the grocery store was easy.  The hosts were friendly and flexible about check in and check out as my schedule changed after the initial booking.  

Altogether a positive experience.  I will definitely recommend it to friends and relatives. "
4279876,26028623,2015-02-01,7221074,Eowyn,"A nice, clean place near the bustling Wallingford thoroughfare. The place was a bit loud from neighbors in the adjoining apartment. Other than that it was a great experience!"
4279876,26161484,2015-02-05,852867,Brian,"A calm atmosphere, within one block of an amazing coffee shop and bar. Furniture (especially the beds!) were comfortable."
4279876,26356589,2015-02-10,25315719,Charles,Beth and Pierce were completely welcoming. They were in touch via email and text at all the right times and made it clear we could ask them whenever we had any questions.
4279876,26599101,2015-02-16,1523350,Jason,"The suite was ideal for the three of us and met or exceeded our expectations. It was clean and tidy with ample room in the living area to relax. The beds were comfortable and had closets and dressers for our things. We appreciated the private parking space saving us the hassle of trying to find street parking.

Beth and Pierce were easily accessible by phone/email and they even checked in with us just to make sure we had everything we needed.

No complaints at all. We would definitely stay here again on our next visit to Seattle. "
4279876,27262187,2015-03-01,2920816,Tiffany,"We stayed at the Sunnyside Suite at the end of February and had a wonderful time! Pictures show the home exactly as it is. The neighborhood was great and felt very comfortable and safe. House was clean and had everything that we needed for the few days we were there. We ate at local restaurants, played at the neighborhood park, walked to/from UW and even hoped on the bus located right there!

Traveling with two small babies meant it was important that we found a clean and clutter free place to stay. This worked great and two play pens fit in our bedroom with plenty of extra space. 

Beth and Pierce were great and responsive! Thank you!

If you are looking for a central launching point to explore the city with all the amenities of home without the price tag of a hotel, this is for you. We had a great time exploring the family-friendly neighbor that lies just footsteps from their door. We'd definitely stay with them again."
4279876,27572463,2015-03-08,24768959,Lauren,"We received useful information about the house and neighborhood. They've created a comfortable, clean and accessible space for people to stay in one of Seattle's most walk-able neighborhoods. "
4279876,27808305,2015-03-12,13039042,Daniel,"I book this apartment for a couple coworkers of mine and they thought it was great. If you're looking for a nice, clean, 2 bedroom apartment for your stay this place is perfect. The rooms are big and the location is hard to beat, with plenty of walkable restaurants, minutes away from I-5, accessible bus lines, all in a friendly neighborhood. "

You made our first visit to Seattle memorable. We greatly appreciated all of the information you shared with us regarding restaurants, sightseeing and your first hand advice on areas to live in Seattle. The book you make available to whomever stays at your apartment is amazing with all of the info and insight you provide.  Our stay was like being at home and the apartment is immaculate. We felt at home immediately and its location is fantastic. It is located in a great neighborhood with a wide variety of restaurants.  We hope to stay there again when we return this fall.  Thank you for opening up your home to us and we look forward to coming back to Seattle.
Best Regards,
Tony Fabiano"
4279876,28769151,2015-03-29,21146225,Emma,It was the perfect location and house for three travelers! We booked the last minute and Beth was very accommodating. The house had everything we needed and more! Great neighborhood  and many places to eat all within walking distance. 
4279876,29077094,2015-04-03,15121499,Kathryn,"Beth was a great host! Super communicative and accommodating.  The apartment is in an awesome location, walking distance to great restaurants, coffee shops, parks and more! It is spacious and comfortable and such a great value! I would absolutely recommend. "
4279876,29461108,2015-04-07,30260311,Kate,The listing was comfortable and clean and in a great location!  We used to live in Wallingford and this was a perfect place for a homecoming.   We had a car for one day and it was great to have a dedicated parking spot.  Beth and Pierce were quick to respond and offered help if-needed.  They also had a handy binder inside the house with suggestions for things to do and had a laminated cleaning list.  I would definitely stay here again!
4279876,29641297,2015-04-10,5436837,Raelynne,My bridesmaids and I had a great time. Everyone was very impressed with the apartment and location! The venue was better than the pictures show. 
4279876,29773863,2015-04-12,30056076,Liz,"Beth and her husband did everything they could to help us feel welcome - giving details of local amenities and transport options and more. The house is comfortable and well kept, with a great array of DVDs to watch when you come home at night. Nearby stores and restaurants, not to mention several coffee shops make this an ideal place to stay."
4279876,30866429,2015-04-28,28258381,Jeff,"Beth and Pierce did a great job of making us feel welcome.  They sent us out a very nice, detailed list of recommendations for restaurants and places to see.  The neighbor hood was very fun and was extremely convenient to where we needed to be.  The pictures and the descriptive information on the Airbnb was very accurate and was a nice or nicer that what we expected."
4279876,31301083,2015-05-04,10902932,Denise,"Pierce and Beth made our ""check-in"" very easy with detailed directions. Their home was immaculate and very comfortable for my daughter and I . It is within walking distance of some good dining options and they made great recommendations for us . We enjoyed the BBQ from Pinky's just a few blocks away!  They checked in with us once via email and we would definitely stay here again. It was just a short drive to any scenic attraction you would like! Thanks so much :) "
4279876,31821963,2015-05-10,11352128,Vittorio,"We were a party of 4 people. Beth has a cozy and nice place! pefect for two couples or a small family. It's clean and well located. There is a small shop about 2 minutes far and a few restaurants in the area. 
Both, Beth and Pierce were extremely nice and available all the time. Beth was getting my messages with questions about Seattle and she was replying within minutes.
Unfortunately, we got robbed in downtown (which kind of ruined our weekedn) but Beth was making sure we had everything we needed all the time.... I have to admit, she made us feel home. I definitely recommend it"
4279876,32335222,2015-05-17,28454235,Michelle,This was a very comfortable and centrally located place to stay.  It had everything we needed and Beth and Pierce were very responsive to all my inquiries.  Couldn't have gone smoother and I would definitely stay here again the next time I visit Seattle!
4279876,34114473,2015-06-05,3916002,Dennis,"In a two-week stay we put Sunnyside Suite to the test and it passed with flying colors.   It was a great place to stay in every way we care about: cleanliness,  uncluttered and uncramped rooms with plenty of closet space, very functional kitchen, and comfortable furniture for sitting and sleeping.   A bonus was the easy-to-access patio just off the living room, and even a small greenspace at the back of the building.  And the location was superb, being within easy walking distance of so many places to eat and drink in the Wallingford neighborhood (a veritable arboretum in May) and of glorious Green Lake -- not to mention our grandchildren just a mile away. 

Finally, Beth and Pierce are really nice folks, very easy to communicate with and attentive to the renter's needs.  What more would anyone want in a ""home away from home""?

4279876,34413245,2015-06-08,29712858,Fang Ling,Nice and clean place.Convenient check-in& check-out process. Free parking is plus. We really have great one in Seattle!
4279876,34936034,2015-06-14,13715111,Alexandra,"The Seattle Sunnyside apartment was perfect for our visit to Seattle.  My daughter was graduating from the University of Washington so it could NOT have been more convenient.  The apartment was easy to find, easy to get into, very comfortable, quiet and easy access to everything we needed.  Parking was on site.  Beth communicated very well with us, expressed interest in our visit and offered to any advice we might want.  Wallingford is a fun neighborhood, has great restaurants and is located centrally but not downtown...which we preferred.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat.  Alexandra Derby"
4279876,35540704,2015-06-20,28180483,Leslie,"Wonderful, large and comfortable apartment in a great location! Beth was super friendly and was full of wonderful suggestions on where to eat and what to do. She checked in with us multiple times to make sure we were having a great time. Apartment had everything you could need during your stay."
4279876,38398186,2015-07-15,10685513,Digby,"Large space that easily accommodated this family of four. We had no problem cooking full meals for ourselves and hanging out in the space.

45th street is pretty busy but the traffic noise is minimal and everything you'll probably need for day to day living is there within a few blocks of the location - grocery stores, restaurants, cafe's and bars.  And within a ten minute drive you'll find as many additional restaurants and bars as I think anyone could wish for.  Loved Gas Works Park that's just a twenty minute walk away through a well-kept tree-lined neighborhood.

The only minor matter that may be a big deal for you or not (it wasn't for us) is the space gets a little musty when the windows have been closed for the day while you're out. We opened all the windows and the large patio door in the house each day whenever we were in the space - everything is fine within minutes. "
4279876,38776596,2015-07-18,37946236,Lisa,"This was our first experience using Airbnb.  Beth was very quick to respond to our request for a reservation and to my inquiries.  The check in process was easy and the apartment was clean and had all appointments one would need.  In terms of location, it is convenient and close to downtown and the neighborhood was crowded with great little restaurants, coffee places and - our favorite - a walk-up burrito joint called TNT.  "
4279876,39732023,2015-07-26,2539117,Graham And Vicki,"We had great communication, opened the door and found a wonderful two bedroom accommodation and the distance to the ball game was easy and close."
4279876,40448116,2015-07-31,31040001,Caroline,"Super easy landing - Beth and Pierce are fun and welcoming.  The apartment was perfect for us - kitchen big enough to cook, and the comfiest couches for watching movies.  Enjoyed the sun (!) in the front.  Thanks again."
4279876,41938039,2015-08-10,33038010,Megan,"We loved staying at Sunnyside!  I'm worried Beth and Pierce have ruined us to the AirBNB experience- I have a hard time believing that there will be nicer, cleaner, more thoughtful and accommodating places to stay!  The location  is a perfect jaunt from every Seattle attraction!  There is plenty to do within walking distance as well.  This is a great place to stay with your family, and we highly recommend it!  "
4279876,42508502,2015-08-14,28479735,Kelly,"We LOVED staying at Sunnyside! It was perfect for our family of 4 on our vacation to Seattle. The place was just as it was described, charming and well appointed. Beth & Pierce were very accommodating hosts. They checked in with us during our stay to make sure we were comfortable, but mostly let us do our own thing. We even had a package arrive during our stay which they made sure we received. Wallingford is a super location if you want to be close to activities but not in the bustle of downtown Seattle. We loved the array of restaurants, coffee houses & shops within walking distance. The bus stop was very convenient (1/2 block away), as we did not have a car. Along with the traditional Seattle visitor spots (Pike Place Market, Space Needle, Science Center & Aquarium), we also took advantage of the wonderful Woodland Zoo & beautiful Green Lake since they were nearby highlights. Both are definitely worth a visit. Thanks, Pierce & Beth, for a very memorable stay!"
4279876,43936808,2015-08-23,12528995,Angel,"Sunnyside is very centrally located for some amazing things to do in and about Seattle.  It is two miles east of the zoo and the little downtown is really cute must try Fainting Goat Gelato!  There is a coffee shop right on the corner and a grocery three blocks away. 

The pictures really don't do justice to the unit.  It is so much better!! The patio is very private,  the living room furniture is crazy comfy, the beds are great in both rooms.  They don't offer hotel style linens either (thin and scratchy) Nope sheets and towels are high end! 

The kitchen is large!  There is cooking and eating supplies for a large family.  There was even a juicer available plus the coffee maker. 

Would recommend!! "
4279876,44918056,2015-08-30,1149567,Jessica,"My cousins and my mom and I all flew out for a family wedding. We did not get in until around 1 am. Beth accommodated our check in time as well as our late check out, due to the wedding being later in the day. Sunnyside was a wonderful apartment to stay in we were all very comfortable, big rooms, comfy beds and very clean. We all enjoyed ourselves very much and Beth and her husband gave us privacy while staying in their home. The apartment was just as it was presented on the sight if not better then we had hoped! The neighborhood was beautiful and Beth and her husband provided a great book of all the local restaurants and bars with personal reviews that we utilized and loved. So many cute restaurants and breakfast spots. We have already recommended Beth's place to our west coast family and to spread the word if anyone is looking for a great place to stay when visiting. Thanks again! Jessica from Boston"
4279876,45427515,2015-09-02,13866611,Kristina,"My sons and I enjoyed three nights at Sunnyside Suite. The suite itself is cozy, clean, quiet and very comfortable. The kitchen is well equipped and the beds were very welcoming after a long day of sightseeing. The boys enjoyed the television and the selection of movies during downtime. The location is fantastic, easily accessible by car or public transit and Wallingford is full of great places to eat or get take-out. We especially enjoyed a pizza dinner at Tutta Bella, ice cream at Molly Moon's, and the novelty shop called Archie McPhee's. During our time in Seattle we really enjoyed the Duck tour, the Bill Speigel Underground Tour at Pioneer Square, and we spent over five hours at the Woodland Zoo which is the nicest zoo I have ever visited with great natural environments for all the animals. There is still so much to see in Seattle and we hope to return soon. And we would be very happy to stay at Sunnyside Suite again. Highly recommended. "
4279876,46730418,2015-09-13,37923652,Betsy,We enjoyed our stay at Seattle Sunnyside Suite! We stayed two nights and the place was perfect for our group of four - very comfortable and exactly what we needed. Beth and Pierce were very accommodating with your check-in schedule and were very easy to communicate with throughout the entire process. We would definitely stay here again!
4279876,47393438,2015-09-18,11136704,Alicia,"This place was great. There are tons of restaurants, cafes and interesting shops to visit within walking distance. The house is clean, roomy and comfortable. The neighborhood seems quiet and safe but there are also bars she karaoke nearby just in case quiet nights aren't your thing. Beth quickly responded to messages and was able to accommodate our early check-in need. University of Washington is also just a short bus ride away or about a 25 minute walk (the walk is beautiful)."
4279876,47984150,2015-09-22,40489203,Carey,房东很守信用，准时打扫干净入住，入住前的信息也很详细准确，地方很好找，交通很便利，屋子是两房一厅一厨房一卫生间，宽敞舒服，还算干净，不错！
4279876,48716147,2015-09-28,22550920,Sheryl,"Such a comfortable, clean stay in a great neighborhood. Beth also left little reviews of local restaurants/bars/coffeehouses, which was a nice touch. And we felt close to everything, but were still in a peaceful yet happening residential area. The 16 bus takes you right downtown; Green Lake is just north of here. It's a fantastic place to be while in Seattle. "
4279876,49133842,2015-10-01,41899230,Derek & Jacqueline,"The Sunnyside Suite is welcoming and charming. Even though we live in Western Washington and are familiar with Seattle, our stay at this little place felt like a getaway. The place was clean and nicely furnished and we really liked the travel themed decor. Great location, close to the University of Washington with many options for dining out close by. We would definitely stay here again!"
4279876,49852658,2015-10-06,23042680,Rongdi,"The house is perfect for my family. Clean and pretty, the small yard is awesome. Close to the main road which is convenient. Also, I love all the lonely planet they have. :-) Great stay here! My family like it much too."
4279876,50082998,2015-10-09,41774887,Rui,"It is a clean and functional apartment near Seattle center.   The house location is easy to find in a quite residence.  There is a Green lake park near the apartment, I did jog every morning and the environment is amazing!  Thanks Beth's guide e-mail regarding all the details.  We really enjoyed our stay in Seattle!"

4279876,50874775,2015-10-15,23042680,Rongdi,Beth's home is perfect for a family trip! My parents loved it so much and it was really convenient for them. They stayed there for more than a week and enjoyed the whole time there!
4279876,51143133,2015-10-18,13646102,Ellen,My daughter and her Dad spent 2 nights here and had a great experience.  Very convenient for access to UW  and in a great neighborhood.  They said communication with Pierce and Beth was very easy and their place had everything they needed.
4279876,51647263,2015-10-22,24197304,Stephen,"Thanks for a great stay! My wife and I enjoyed relaxing in the living room, walking around the U of W campus area and going a long run around the nearby lake trail. The accommodations where excellent. It was a great way to see everyday Seattle life! E"
4279876,52834778,2015-11-02,11639017,Anne,We received helpful and timely responses from Beth and Pierce both before and during our stay.  The place was super comfortable and spacious. We loved the neighborhood; it's a beautiful area to walk around and and there are numerous restaurants and tea/coffee houses in close walking distance.  We loved staying here and will definitely return as well as recommend to friends! 
4279876,53710319,2015-11-11,47547076,Kathryn,The suite was very welcoming. The area was quiet and very easy to get around with several places to explore. Seattle Sunnyside was the perfect place for our family to relax and reconnect. Thanks!

4279876,55506310,2015-12-01,28938535,Erin,House was nice and clean and conveniently located to University Washington and a QFC was about a block away.  Beth and Pierce were easily reached and responded quickly prior to trip and for access info. 
4279876,55954909,2015-12-07,33448819,Connie,"We had a great weekend in this space.  We were able to get where we wanted to go easily and quickly with several bus lines conveniently located close to us.  We were close to several great restaurants and a QFC.  The space was comfortable, cozy, and had everything we needed.  There were four of us and my daughter ended up sleeping on the couch, which she said was OK.  It was nice to be in a neighborhood instead of downtown.  "
4279876,56911921,2015-12-20,593072,Merideth,"What a spot! This little 2-bedroom apartment in the middle of Wallingford (one of Seattle's best - and most walk-able neighborhoods) is perfect! Full disclosure: I live across the street with my family - but rented the space for extended family when our home was bursting at the seams. Beth and Pierce have created a wonderfully welcoming home that I was happy to have the family stay in. 

The hosts are all around awesome people. I think the price is great on this space - a real steal for the neighborhood! 

Thanks, Merideth Kelly"
6005443,43236934,2015-08-18,2773716,Dillon,"Jeffery was a great host for a great AirBnB. Jeffery made some great recommendations for restaurants in the neighborhood, made ""checking in"" very easy and timely, and was easily reachable by text throughout our stay.
The apartment itself was very spacious and clean, and had an amazing view of the water and city. Though it seemed a bit far out of the way, the apartment was only two blocks from public transit and we were able to get to any other area in Seattle very easily.
Would definitely recommend this AirBnb, we had a great time in Seattle because of it. 
"
6005443,47974588,2015-09-22,15401508,Jackie,"We stayed a week at Jeffrey's lakeside apartment and it was so lovely, start to finish. Every morning we would get up, marvel at the perfect view of Queen Anne Hill across Lake Union, and then trot over to the adorable 14 Carrot Cafe for breakfast. The place was well stocked with back up toiletries and a variety of refreshments, and is within walking distance of lots of great local eats. Being two blocks away from
the water didn't hurt either. Jeffrey was a very friendly and responsive remote host (with great taste!) and I hope to visit again. 

Street parking is tight but available, and I would recommend having a car to explore the city. Most everything touristy is within 10-15 minutes' drive from here. And definitely check out Discovery Park to hike the beach trail, if you can!"
6005443,48749785,2015-09-28,25263779,Frankie,It was supper easy to get the keys and the apartment was beautiful!! Jeff even left us a parking pass which came in SUPER handy!! Stay here and enjoy the bar on the corner and the Calzones from the pizza join as well!!!
4661812,33999867,2015-06-03,1298855,Anya,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Rebecca’s place. The apartment is beautiful with great panoramic views from huge windows and lovely floor plan. There is a lot of natural light for as long as the day would last. 
The kitchen is well stocked with pots and pans and dishes and utensils. The stove looks and works almost like a commercial one with powerful exhaust hood.
The bed and pillows are comfortable and sheets are of good quality which adds to comfort. 
The only thing I’d do differently is allowing for more closet/drawer space to keep cloths and belongings of those who visit. We had very tight space in the closet allotted for our stuff and very few hangers and no drawer space at all for small personal items. 
The place is half-way up the Queen Anne hill and getting around the neighborhood requires steep climb up no matter which way you want to go/come back. So a car is highly recommended, otherwise be prepared for a good cardio work out daily : )
In spite of these inconveniences, I’d still recommend this place and I would love to stay there again one day when visiting Seattle.
"
4661812,35591337,2015-06-20,33914842,Greg,"Rebecca's apartment was very nice, clean, and plenty large enough - bed was comfortable. She was very helpful with recommending places to eat, etc.  

It is convenient to downtown, but we would recommend having a car, as the walk and uphill climb from the bus stop to the apartment can be gruelling at the end of a long day sightseeing. It is worth mentioning that there is no elevator to the 3rd floor unit.  

While probably not usually a problem in Seattle, being an upper floor unit, it was a bit warm in the early evening. (No AC).  Opening windows helped of course, but then traffic noise was pretty loud."
4661812,37209411,2015-07-05,27071911,Michael,"Rebecca's condo is absolutely beautiful! We enjoyed every minute of our stay at her home and she has all the comforts you need. Most important to us is cleanliness and her place is immaculately kept! She was extremely friendly and hospitable. We would love to visit again soon!

4661812,38167059,2015-07-13,10100292,Sean,"We loved staying at Rebecca's place! The entire experience - from initial inquiry, to the thorough and easy to follow instructions, to the travel tips around Seattle - we had a wonderful trip. 

Honestly, the photos do not do this place justice. It is wonderfully appointed and beautifully designed. The views from the kitchen, eating area, and living room are superb. Everything you need to feel at home is there and Rebecca was more than accommodating and was a very gracious host. 

I would absolutely stay here again and couldn't say enough good things. Thanks Rebecca! "
4661812,39037910,2015-07-20,35508991,Matt,Everything at Rebecca's was great. We had a wonderful time and really enjoyed the apartment.
4661812,41217243,2015-08-05,35145201,Veronica,"Rebecca's place was fantastic! Honestly the pictures don't do it justice. The views were fantastic and the amenities were great. The beds were supper comfortable and the bathroom was big enough for a small family.

It's a little tricky to find but she provides great directions and once we figured out the streets we found it pretty quickly.

The location is perfect. We relied on the public transportation for the first half of our stay and it was easy. We even walked home one evening from the space needle with our two kids and it wasn't half bad. But that last hill to the apartment is a doozy ;)

The last half we rented a car and there was always plenty of room to park out front. We didn't get to meet Rebecca as she was out of town and arrived the day before we left, but she did check in on us to make sure our stay was going well and we didn't need anything once she was back. 

All in all it was a great experience, a great location and a great place to stay. We would definitely book with Rebecca again! "
4661812,47735868,2015-09-21,39566060,Debi,"Staying at Rebecca's place was a great experience.  Comfortable beds, wonderful kitchen and the views!!! Rebecca was great at communicating with us before and during our stay. "
4661812,48396110,2015-09-26,25412397,Lisa,"Love to find places which capture a sense of place, this one being the neighborhood of Queen Anne Hill. Our stay highlights will be slower mornings with a cook's kitchen, ample views, and a great whole-floor sound system to listen to NPR news in the morning, jazz at night. We were here for an event at SPU, which was a doable 25 minute walking distance (or 6 minutes by car). Accommodations are uncomplicated and elegantly stylish. Hope to have reason to stay again!"
4661812,49469755,2015-10-04,42744735,Benjamin,"Amazing apartment with beautiful views! Very comfortable, clean and friendly. I would totally recommend this place!"

741699,5457117,2013-07-01,6349737,Laura,"The Zen Retreat is a wonderful place to stay.  It's situated about 10 blocks away from Columbia City - a vibrant Seattle neighborhood with good food options - and just a few minutes away (by car) from downtown Seattle.  The bedrooms are airy, and the beds are comfortable.  The spa shower is very relaxing.  The living spaces are designed for socializing and yet provide comfort when working remotely or just hanging out.  Matt is a generous host who takes care in making sure you have what you need.  I highly recommend this home for short or extended stays. "
741699,5517820,2013-07-03,6408811,Krishna,Matt is great. The house is very nice spacious clean and light. It is about 12 blocks from a very nice eating shopping street (Columbia city) and light rail. Good beds. Good kitchen. Nice deck. I'd go back. 
741699,5618381,2013-07-08,725408,Mita,"The Seward Park Zen Retreat was just that - a zen retreat. We loved the place, it's energy and proximity to Seward Park for early morning jog. Matt was a good host and made sure the place was clean and we had easy access to the key when we arrived. Due to power outage on one of the days, the wifi service was interrupted but Matt immediately responded and we were able to reboot the modem. I highly recommend this place for your next trip to Seattle!!"
741699,5734028,2013-07-14,5339397,Heather,"Matt's house was lovely & comfortable for our week-long stay in Seattle. The kitchen is well-stocked with anything you'd need to cook a meal, and the bathroom is beautiful & tranquil. There's a back deck with several comfortable chairs to enjoy the weather. Matt was a great host, checking in several times during our trip, and always willing to answer questions, & quickly! We would definitely stay here again! "
741699,6775456,2013-08-25,750565,Amy Lou,"We had a lovely month in Seattle at Matt's place. His house was well-furnished and comfortable. The bathroom was luxurious! We appreciated having a full kitchen to prepare meals. The neighborhood is incredible in terms of being able to walk to the grocery store, Lake Washington, Columbia City, and public transportation.
Matt was very responsive to our requests (for more towels, etc.). 
We were there in late July and August. The house doesn't have air conditioning, but was comfortable most of the time because of Seattle's great climate."
741699,6833660,2013-08-26,2982308,Mohamed,"My girlfriend and I stayed there for one night a few weeks ago, and could not have asked for a more glorious space. Bright, sunny, spacious, just utterly lovely. One of the more beautiful homes I've stayed in, the spot was in an excellent area (trendy neighbourhood with lots of cool little coffee shops and restaurants) that was extremely close to downtown Seattle (less than a twenty minute drive). 

Matt was extremely hospitable, flexible  and helpful, and made sure that we were accommodated fully. We would love to stay here again the next time we visit the city."
741699,6853850,2013-08-27,7248494,Cate,"Our stay at the ""Zen Retreat"" was just that - a nice relaxing space to reconnect with family during our trip to Seattle.  We arrived late and checked out early; however, the process was seamless and Matt was very accommodating.  Also, first impression of the home was quite impressive... clean, interesting decor, fun design ideas, soft and comfortable sheets.  As a bonus, we took Lake Washington Blvd on our way back to downtown, which was a nice, peaceful and scenic way to start the morning.  Overall would recommend staying here."
741699,6902331,2013-08-29,206203,Amanda,"I stayed at the Seward Park Zen Retreat as a birthday present to myself and it was a perfect choice. While the rate is a little higher than I like to pay, it was well worth it. Matt's place is clean, private, very comfortable and with all the comforts of home and then some. Like his unbelievable shower/steam room! Soooo nice after a hard day of work for me or site seeing for you. Matt was easy to deal with and arrangements easy. I will definitely stay here again when I want to treat myself."
741699,7042970,2013-09-04,5607826,Marissa,"We loved staying at Matt's Zen retreat.  It was a beautiful, serene, and unique place.  We enjoyed the back patio and proximity to the city.  Matt was helpful and flexible."

741699,7511750,2013-09-23,7226027,Stefan,The zen retreat was the perfect place to stay for us. It was a great place to base our busy sightseeing days out of. The neighborhood is quiet and house's decor is relaxing. After a long day it was great to grab a quick bite at the local market and relax for the evening. Matt was a good host and very responsive to our questions.

741699,7899904,2013-10-07,9060604,Melanie,"A gorgeous home. The shower has a steam option.. it was like having a spa accessible 24/7 and I took advantage of it. We cooked meals and enjoyed the well stocked kitchen. The fireplace delighted us nightly. The decor was zen and calming. Beautiful, tranquil and very comfortable. We highly recommend Matt's lovely home. "
741699,8005202,2013-10-12,4398324,Regina,The Zen was a nice quiet home in a good location that fit our travel needs while working in the SEATAC areas. The bed was especially comfortable.

My nephew is an aspiring artist and was very impressed with many art pieces decorating his walls. 

Staying at Matt's house was a memorable experience for my Japanese relative and  certainly contributed to the positive impression about  Seattle. 

Matt is easy to communicate and prompt to return my inquiry.  We definitely recommend his property to any of out of town guest.

741699,8338651,2013-10-26,9481836,Wes,"Matt, was a wonderful host! Easy to communicate with and very responsive with any questions. The house was very clean and organized. The steam shower was definitely a plus after traveling and running around the city all day! Strongly recommend to any out of state visitors and people who just want to get away from their own little neighborhood.

Thanks Matt!"
741699,8473343,2013-11-01,9599025,Tom,"We chose Matt's Seward Park house because it is near our daughter's Columbia City home. The home is quite comfortable and the neighborhood is quiet. We were close to Seward Park trails, the Arboretum and a short drive to anywhere in the city. We hit the Columbia City/Ranier Avenue strip, eating @ La Medusa, Geraldine's and live jazz @ the Royal Room.
This was our first use of Airbnb and all went well. Matt was very easy to work with and quick to respond to any question. He offers a great alternative to the hotel room. We hope to return.                          "
741699,8673175,2013-11-11,5792373,Lia,"Perfect Airbnb experience. Matt's place is extremely clean and beautifully designed. Matt made checking in very easy and the house was warm and ready for us even though we came in quite late. I've traveled quite a bit using Airbnb including Europe and Matt's house was one of my favorites. You won't be disappointed if you are his next guest. Oh yeah, and the steam shower, yep, definitely a big plus.  :) Thank you Matt. "
741699,9054455,2013-12-03,9556943,Dianne,"The Zen Retreat House is exactly how it is represented in the write-up. The house is located just minutes from shopping, bakery, local meat market, etc.  Matt was available by phone or internet if you needed anything.  We would stay here again the next time we are in the Seattle area.  This house worked perfectly for my husband, myself and my 80 year old mother."
741699,9152224,2013-12-09,2699094,Elyse,"This place was absolutely beautiful. We arrived for a group retreat, and had an excellent stay. The kitchen was well stocked and the house was warm and cozy. There were a few things that could have been improved, but they were incredibly minor: the tv would go into 'sleep mode' while watching a movie, we couldn't find the compost for the house, and we would have loved to use an auxiliary cable on the stereo system. Again, totally minor! The house was all we wanted, and I would definitely go back. "
741699,9263232,2013-12-16,2119646,Eugene,The Zen Retreat is tastefully decorated and exactly what I needed after two days of running around Seattle trying to take in all the sights. Matt was the consummate host and even put out some sparkling water on the beds for us to enjoy. Would recommend to anyone visiting the Seattle area!
741699,9397859,2013-12-26,10616961,Susan,"Matt has made a comfortable house available for people with their dogs.  We stayed one night to be with family at Christmas.  It is not easy to find houses that will allow dogs, and we appreciated his generosity.  The house is comfortable and clean and Matt was easy to work with."
741699,9766506,2014-01-08,10947521,Michelle,"My stay at Matt's house was wonderful - it's an exceptionally peaceful space, especially with the added benefit of a steam shower. It's like staying in an art gallery. Very tastefully appointed with lots of warm colors. The neighborhood is very quiet as well. Pick this one - Matt is a wonderful host and the house is very comfortable. "
741699,9884315,2014-01-16,6546815,Sean,"My stay at Matt's was reserved last minute, and he made it hassle free and very convenient to check in after my late flight. The house is beautiful, and in a great neighborhood, and every detail was attended to. I only wish I could have stayed longer!"
