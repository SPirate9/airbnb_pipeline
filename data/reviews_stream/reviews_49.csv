The studio was really clean, had a modern feel, and in the really nice neighborhood of Mount Baker. Teresa made us feel completely at home and we LOVED the use of the hot tub!  We wish we could have stayed longer. Parking was easy and it was close to center city Seattle. "
5194332,49980654,2015-10-08,13023786,Katharine,"Lovely host, great location, very comfortable studio apartment. Would definitely stay there next time I am at a conference, etc., in Seattle."
5194332,51115426,2015-10-18,38289713,Meaghan,Beautiful studio! I would suggest it to anyone. Awesome neighborhood extremely close to everything.
5194332,52048812,2015-10-26,21562972,Emily,"This place was everything we were looking for in Seattle! It was a nice, private, quiet space with a beautiful view of the lake, gorgeous landscaping, and very comfortable accommodations. I would definitely recommend staying here for your Seattle trip  - you will not be disappointed!"
5194332,53452363,2015-11-09,7026598,Shelley,Everything was as stated. The hot tub is heaven. The view is gorgeous. Immaculately clean. We never met Teresa but w securely appreciate her. 
5194332,54976275,2015-11-27,41510254,Samantha,"This was a great place to stay! The neighborhood was nice and quiet - I ran down a picturesque set of steps to the lake and took a jog in the mornings. The TV was awesome, the bed was super comfy, and Teresa was around if there was anything we needed. We really missed the space once we left it during our trip! "
5021969,28156255,2015-03-18,15356940,Keri,"Darcy was great accommodating us last minute! The place was beautiful, historic, clean, and walkable to everywhere in town. We were able to have an easy (email hidden) downstairs and the bartenders were very nice and welcoming. Overall we loved the area and the room! I would definitely recommend this place to everyone."
5021969,29582184,2015-04-09,16280661,Bryan,"Unfortunately I haven't met Darcy in person, I was greeted by the bar tender downstairs to check in.  The room itself was cozy with very tall ceilings and old world charm. reminded me of my old NYC apartment in a pre-war building. Pioneer square can be a tad seedy late at night, although I knew this ahead of time. Just keep your head up when walking at night alone.

My stay was problem-free otherwise. Checking in and out was quite easy and flexible. "
5021969,29765809,2015-04-12,26917252,James,"Great location. Walking distance to a lot of Seattle's best and only a 10$ cab ride to the rest. I am from the area and just in town for an event... some people claim in reviews that the homeless in the area are pushy, but it is just a Seattle thing, they are 99% harmless and will leave you alone if you just push on. Stick to the main streets and you will be fine. The amount of living space you get vs. a hotel in Seattle is about double for half the price so well worth it. Darcy and the (email hidden) are very helpful if you need anything. If you are there on a weekend expect it to be noisy until around two am or so, mostly from people in the street more than the club next door. It is an old building with thinner walls and you can hear the building make it's own noises (creaky floors and such) if you are a super light sleeper bring ear plugs. Would definitely stay again! We stayed in 202."
5021969,30781898,2015-04-27,26050928,Payton,"Darcy's apartment was comfortable, clean and in a great location. There is a bar and restaurant right downstairs which made picking up and returning the key to the room easy. Great place!"
5021969,31831663,2015-05-10,22721139,Baskut,Very nice apartment. 
5021969,33099543,2015-05-25,30375964,Gary,"Nice place to stay. Room was clean, lots of towels, lots of linens, and lots of pillows. The pictured couch is a pull-out bed, so the room can probably comfortably fit 4 people even. Picking up and returning the key at Merchant's is convenient. Being able to get to the place by light rail from SeaTac is a great perk.

Apartment is walking distance to Pike Place and Seattle Center. Ballard Street and Capitol Hill are about a $10 Uber ride away. As others have said, there are homeless around asking for money, but they don't pester you if you politely decline.

Only possible drawback (or benefit) is that the apartment is right next to the Trinity nightclub, which we could hear one night. Not loud enough to disturb sleep though."
5021969,33990748,2015-06-03,30113257,Molly,"Great stay! The apartment was very comfortable and centrally located. The check-in & check-out was a smooth easy process. It did get a little noisy at night, but it didn't affect my sleep. I definitely recommend! "
5021969,34266828,2015-06-06,2504283,Andrew,The host canceled this reservation 29 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5021969,34613354,2015-06-09,789794,Sabirah,"The communication with Darcy was easy. She gave specific and easy instructions to follow. The apartment was wonderful, had a rustic charm to it and the bed, oh my, was divine. It's a short walk away from the King Street train station. "
5021969,34958489,2015-06-14,31612868,Celia,I arrived at the Merchants Cafe early to pick-up the keys. The staff at the Cafe were very nice and checked me in right away. The apartment was very comfortable and had everything i needed.
5021969,36282428,2015-06-27,16749162,Will,This mini flat is really pretty big and has everything you would need for a short stay. You can't really beat the location although it can be a little loud. Check out London Plane a few minutes walk away for brunch or dinner.
5021969,36365208,2015-06-28,28410914,Kristi,Checked in through Merchants Cafe after lunch. We were escorted to our room by Cafe staff. Room exactly as described in photos. Excellent location to sports venues - about 5 blocks. And theres 2 parking garage options across yhe street. The neighborhood is always busy with the bustle of city life but still quaint and always people around. Dispute the heat (90s) the place was surprisingly cool and had many windows and a fan. Also didn't hear night club or Cafe at all in our room. 
5021969,36689400,2015-06-30,2043064,Lindsay,"This is a very central location in Seattle, just steps to the ferry and a 15 minute walk to Pike's Place. It's directly above the Merchant's Cafe. The apartment was a great value for Seattle with a small kitchen, living room, bathroom and private bed room costing less than a hotel room anywhere! The brick/chalkboard walls were fun and created a lot of fun ambiance. The building is on a busy corner and the walls are thing so you will hear everything going on outside. There are street cleaners and other vehicles that will wake up even deep sleepers wearing earplugs, so that's something to consider. The building is old and some electrical outlets do not work. Internet was also unavailable. It's a great spot from which to explore Seattle and the total value was great, but it's best for those who want to unplug and don't need to be connected. "
5021969,36948890,2015-07-03,3004706,Chelsey,"Myself and a couple friends had a nice stay at Darcy's apartment. Darcy responded promptly to all communications. The bar staff at Merchants was very friendly when we checked in, and the check-out process was easy as well. The apartment is just as pictured and described in the listing. Clean and comfy. 

A few other reviewers have commented about the street noise, and it did bother us. The weather was pretty warm when we were in Seattle, so we kept the windows open to get some air. We heard a good bit of noise between 12-2am with people leaving bars and then more noise in the early morning with dump trucks emptying out trash bins in the alley (right below the bedroom window) and seagulls waking up. I purchased some ear plugs and they helped a bit, but I probably would not stay here again in the summer due to the noise. I imagine with the windows closed it probably wouldn't be a problem. 

I have mixed feelings about the neighborhood. On the positive side, it was very convenient (just a couple blocks from Kings St station and easy walk to the market and other attractions), and there are some great restaurants nearby (loved Damn the Weather). However, it's sketchy at night. A lot of homeless people sleep on Occidental, and there are some shady characters that hang around the Saveway convenience store right around the corner from the apt. No one really bothered us, but I would avoid that particular area at night. "
5021969,37592602,2015-07-08,14602044,Lindsay,"This booking was refunded, less fees. Had arranged to leave door unlocked because our train would get in 4 hours late than anticipated. We arrived to find the door locked and no one was available to answer messages due to it being 1 hour later than he restaurant closed, so I had to find a hotel downtown instead. Please note I that airbnb requires feedback for all items, even though some do not apply as I did not stay; average ratings have been selected in these cases."
5021969,37958411,2015-07-12,30921607,Casey,"This place is a corner of the building, it is nice and a good location.
However, it is very noisy. In fact, probably the noisiest place I have ever been, due to the club next door, and the general street noise.
In the early evening, the music is bearable, but as the night goes on the music got louder.  So I was not able to get to sleep any earlier than 2:00am.  Over the course of consecutive days, this gets pretty grating, when all you want to do is sleep.

Fear not, It is only open Thu-Sat, so if your days are outside of this it is a great place to stay.
Also, I would suggest getting the top floor, because the old floors in the place are wooden and creak, so you are privy to the bedroom habits of those above you.

The location is close to public transit hubs, and walking distance to many places.

However, the neighborhood is full of homeless and panhandlers, and they are aggressive. One came in to Merchants (the Bar and Restaurant downstairs) while I (email hidden) and begged money there. The Bar Tender, caught this and hastily removed them from the building.

Other than this, the place can get pretty hot, and at night. You can't really open the windows due to the noise until after 2:00am when the bars let out due to the street noise and people.  This was not really the case on Wednesday, mostly Thu-Sat.

The wifi, is spotty at best.  It continually drops your phone, but laptops with strong connections are a bit better.

Would I book again?  Yes, Sunday through Wednesday.
You really can't beat the location.

Based on the noise alone, I would give this place a 2 star rating, but coupled with the fact of the location, and a washer and drier, that is a 4, so I will split the difference at 3 Stars.
"
5021969,38489365,2015-07-16,31625189,Jennifer,This place was exactly as listed. Perfect place to stay and be close to everything down town. We loved it and will be back.
5021969,38711126,2015-07-18,32875483,John,"Great location, clean, spacious, no complaints."
5021969,39644547,2015-07-25,35215548,Will,Location was great - near a lot of great places. It was a bit loud overnight as the apartment is close to a bar - so bring ear plugs - other than that everything was as described.
5021969,40098089,2015-07-28,8291940,Maria,Easy and quick booking and arrangements. Great location for our day in Seattle--afternoon at Pike Place Market and evening with the Mariner--walking distance to both. Surprisingly quiet for Pioneer Square. A perfect fit for us and our 12-year-old nephew.
5021969,40458919,2015-07-31,27194287,Janet,The apartment is very spacious and we really enjoyed our stay there. Staff at the merchant cafe were very helpful and the area being the original part of Seattle was most interesting.
5021969,40920720,2015-08-03,274148,Ben,Great apartment in a great location!
5021969,41334400,2015-08-07,28897151,Alex,"Beautiful place – we were very impressed with the size and furnishings of the apartment. Very high ceilings, lots of large windows, well furnished. I have been to Seattle a number of times, but had never explored the Pioneer Square area: a great part of town, with a lot of good places to eat, grab coffee, and great architecture. Highly recommend the Sky View Observatory only a couple blocks away. Also an easy walk to King Street Station."
5021969,41935437,2015-08-10,5641898,Barbara,"Wonderful old historic building. The flat was clean and comfortable. It is on the second floor, and there is no wheelchair access. The stairs are a bit on the steep side, but wide, with a sturdy handrail. We stayed on a Sunday night and the neighbourhood was quiet.  Conveniently located near the Pioneer Square train station, so we were able to get there easily from the airport. The second bed is the sofa shown in the photos. The back pillows remove and it is a single. I am 5'7"" 150 lbs and had no problem getting comfortable. Would definitely stay there again. "
5021969,43528832,2015-08-20,1821645,Dallas,"t was a bit hot, but the temperature in the city didn't help the day I was in in town. It was very loud due to construction going on in the city. For the most part it looked like the picture, the furniture in the apartment was different then the picture. Not as modern or new as the pictures display. It was easy getting into the apartment. "
5021969,45267032,2015-09-01,19567553,Jane,"The pictures were very accurate and it was close to major attractions (aquarium, Pike Place Market, Amtrak station).  Darcy was very easy to communicate with before and during the stay."
5021969,46392597,2015-09-10,40133472,Mac,"Great apartment, good size and nice layout. The location is awesome, really close to shopping, food, and the water. The one negative thing I will say about the location is that there is a number of homeless people that come out at night and stay in the park across the street from the building, they stay to themselves and dont cause any problems though, so it isint something to really worry about. The only thing to be aware of is the parking situation. There are multiple garages and llts around the building, but they all have signs posted saying no overnight parking. Luckily darcy was an amazing host and was able to let us rent her parking pass for the garage directly across the street from her building allowing us to park there overnight. All in all it was an amazing experience and i look forward to staying at darcys again wheb i am back in the city in a couple of months."
5021969,46584724,2015-09-12,36093146,Matt,Great location with easy access to public transportation.  Darcy made check-in and check-out easy and seamless. The noise of the surrounding restaurants and night life was minimal so we had no trouble sleeping.  Would definitely stay here again.
5021969,47006242,2015-09-14,19318055,Ronald,Darcy and her staff were great. They did everything to make our experience pleasant. They place is very very very centrally located in pioneer square. 
5021969,47385177,2015-09-18,26267156,Maggie,We arrived before check in time and the downstairs bar was great and let us store our bags while we explored a bit. The space and neighborhood are great. We walked easily to everything including a baseball game the waterfront and shopping the library and market. Would recommend and stay again when in Seattle. 
5021969,47734822,2015-09-21,26361471,Lauren & Jesse,"What a great apartment.  Clean and extremely well put together.  The location is perfect for exploring Seattle! Thanks, Darcy."
5021969,48134984,2015-09-23,9372607,Evan,"This is a beautiful, historic apartment in the heart of Pioneer Square - I was truly impressed, and I look forward to visiting again. Darcy went out of her way to make me feel welcome. The bed was comfortable. The wifi was fast. I had a wonderful stay. Highly recommended whether you're in town for work or play."
5021969,48308770,2015-09-25,42957836,James,"Apt 202 is a great apt in a primo location. It's a corner apt with windows on two sides and the front room windows look right onto Pioneer Square and the pergola. It's in public transpo heaven --close to many bus routes, 1.5 short blocks from the transit tunnel and light rail from the airport, an easy 10 minute walk from the Amtrak station, and there are always plenty of Ubers near. It's a charming old place with a living room kitchen and bedroom. If you like an older place in the heart of the city, you'll love this.

We add an issue with the facility and the cleaning so I knocked off a star, but Darcy jumped on it right away, taking time from what she was doing and driving through double-crazy traffic to get there and make it right, so I only knocked off one star. She was responsive, responsible and efficient.  We'd book it again."
5021969,48469891,2015-09-26,36582242,Arturo,"Experience was Good overall, the building is old but well kept and renovated for the most part. Darcy's employee was there to welcome me and explain the ins and outs. 
The only bad side is not the listing itself but the area, which is not the safest part of town and there are many homeless asking for change at all times. Beware if you travel with children."
5021969,48941066,2015-09-29,44312684,Lauren,This place was so cute!! Very central location and walking distance to many things. My friend and I loved the interior. It's very accurate to the pictures. Also got to meet some of the people that worked the bar below and everyone was very friendly and helpful. Overall great place and would recommend!
5021969,49959317,2015-10-07,39803170,Brendan,"This is a really cool apartment, located really close to King Street station.  Check in was easy in the bar downstairs.  The Pioneer Square area certainly has its fair share of interesting characters, but if you want a place close to the station, you can't do better than this."
5021969,50146288,2015-10-09,45771625,Geoffrey,"Really a great place to stay.  A cool, spacious room right in Pioneer Square at a reasonable price.  Convenient to everything. The bar staff were very friendly and accommodating.  Checking in and out with them was a breeze.  The neighborhood was a bit noisy at night, but that was expected.  Would stay here again."
5021969,50374516,2015-10-11,25543200,Susan,"If you are 25 years young this is a great place.  Pretty much nightclub central.  If you want a relaxing atmosphere and ""peace"" of mind this is not for you.  The suite itself has everything you need including a washer/dryer and kitchen.  Paper thin walls.  Nothing very close for breakfast.  One thing I will say is that the bed was very comfy.  Be prepared for a very steep flight of stairs!!!"
5021969,50644239,2015-10-13,6465632,Brian,"The listing and photos were pretty accurate, and the location is excellent. The host never responded to us after 3 messages we sent prior to our arrival. We left a day early due to excessive dust that seriously aggravated our allergies."
5021969,51072989,2015-10-17,45583275,Kirsty,"The building had a historic charm to it and the room was clean. It's in a great location, right in the heart of Pioneer Square, very close to the light rail station and walking distance to the market and downtown area. Overall really enjoyed staying here. "
5021969,53261418,2015-11-07,1938083,Kyle,"The apartment was absolutely great! It looks gorgeous and has everything you need. The bed is very comfortable and cozy, the WiFi is fast, and having  a well-supplied kitchen and washing machine/dryer was great as well. Some people complained about street noise but I didn't notice anything other than what is normal for a city. It didn't bother me. The location was very convenient to downtown the surrounding areas so I was able to walk mostly everywhere. Check in at the cafe below was very smooth. Overall my stay was great and I highly recommend the apartment to others. "
5021969,53825443,2015-11-13,8092970,Christina,"Loved our apartment and the stay as a whole!  The place is super comfy and cute, and so much fun with all of the saloon, speak-easy, brothel and hauntings history.  The decor/feel of the apartment and building is so much better than some modern high-rise in my opinion (the Pioneer Square area is as a whole).  We arrived on the light rail, day-tripped on ferry, departed by Amtrak... all within easy walking distance.  Though we arrived before check-in, we were able to store our luggage... couldn't have been an easier process.  For us, a huge part of our stay, was the great input, warmth and humor of all three women working at the saloon/cafe.  We'll definitely stay again the next time we are in Seattle.  Thank you!"
6968101,36254883,2015-06-26,271176,Paulette,The host canceled this reservation 14 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6968101,37387237,2015-07-06,19385528,Andrea,"Andrew's apartment was clean and cozy, and provided a great home base for our Seattle weekend. It is just a quick ride away from downtown, Lake Union, and the Freemont area. There are also several restaurants, coffee shops, and grocery stores within a few blocks of the apartment. We had the added bonus of a fantastic view from his back porch for the Fourth of July fireworks show on Lake Union! As is common for Seattle, the apartment does not have air conditioning. It was a bit warm during the day, but bearable with the multiple fans in the apartment and opening doors and windows. Andrew was very responsive throughout the process, and provided a detailed guide for managing our stay in the apartment as well as visiting the city. We also felt very welcomed with a bottle of wine and fresh flowers upon our arrival!"
6968101,41779880,2015-08-09,7595438,Jordache,"What a fantastic experience! I would recommend Andrew as a host to any fellow AirBnB'er. Not only was his communication top-notch, he provided a wonderful personal guidebook of the area for us. Even having lived in Seattle before, I found his guidebook to be very informative. Uber was about to get me downtown for under $10 everyday from this location, which ended up saving us a lot of money on parking downtown. I plan on staying here again the next chance I get to spend time in Seattle. I'm an experienced AirBnB'er and rest assured, this is the kind of AirBnB experience you won't regret."
6968101,43063482,2015-08-17,5094403,Justine,"This Queen Anne apartment was absolutely everything we were looking for. We did not have a car while we were in Seattle so it was important to us that public transportation was easily accessible. It was a quick 5 minute walk to the bus stop which took us straight into downtown Seattle and about a $10 Uber ride to downtown/Pikes Public Market. There were several restaurants, a Trader Joes, coffee shops and bars within walking distance to the apartment as well. The apartment itself was very quaint, comfortable and well decorated. There is both a front and back balcony with stunning views, perfect for a morning cup of coffee. Andrew was the perfect host. As soon as we walked into the apartment, we were greeted with a basket of toiletries, a bottle of wine (which we enjoyed on the back balcony) and beautiful flowers. He was very flexible and quick to respond whenever we had questions. I would definitely recommend staying in this lovely apartment."
6968101,47155664,2015-09-16,38049145,Shirlene,"Andrew's place was the perfect home for our weekend in Seattle. It was in a great location with nearby grocery stores, coffee shops, and restaurants. It was a quick ride to/from Fremont and downtown so it kept Uber costs low and parking our rental in the neighborhood was always no hassle. It was also about a 40 minute drive to the Rattlesnake Ridge hike.

The home itself was very cozy, though a bit cold early in the morning. The photos from the front & back balconies definitely don't do them justice as the view we caught of the sunset from the front balcony was absolutely stunning. He mentions a dog in the description of his home, but there was trace amounts of hair around the house and was definitely no bother.

As a host, Andrew was great. He was very friendly and responsive. He clearly outlined pertinent details for our stay in his home and provided us great recommendations for things to do, see, and eat in and around Seattle."
6968101,49720388,2015-10-05,45044262,Dorothy,"It's everything he says it is and more. Andrew responds quickly to any correspondence before and during your stay. We found his home to be cozy (comfy bed, nice pillows), very clean and private feeling. There are two lovely decks (nice views from both), it's a very pretty neighborhood, close to so many things you'd enjoy and the kitchen is well equipped if you want to cook.

I echo all the positive things that were said by others and will tell you I'm picky about places I stay. Andrew's house was just lovely and you won't regret choosing it, I promise!"
6968101,53649776,2015-11-10,47943829,Megan,"Andrew shared relevant information before we arrived, responded in a timely fashion, and gave clear instructions. The house was as described and in an excellent location in Seattle. Everything was great!"
6968101,55220845,2015-11-29,46459331,John,"The place was perfect for us. Great location and the kitchen worked out really well (we actually fixed Thanksgiving dinner there!) Communication was excellent. We were there during the winter, so we couldn't take advantage of the decks, but the views were very nice and it would be a great place to hang out during spring and summer!"
6561811,36696312,2015-06-30,9006936,Aaron,Best Air BnB experience I've had yet!
6561811,37681801,2015-07-09,36053878,Jaime,"Overall, my (email hidden) House was great. The location can't be beat and the people were the best. The house was pretty clean considering that it was full of boys. I would say the only cons were when visitors were over hanging out late at night because the deck is through the room I was staying in and the bathroom is also right next to the room. So, that's just something to be aware of. Def bring some earplugs"
6561811,41781655,2015-08-09,36587190,Sven,"I went to Seattle for The International 2015 tournament, and I'm very happy I chose to stay at this place. For me, the location(distance/proximity to Seattle Center) was just perfect. Bus connections to the city center are great, and very close to the house.

The area where the house is, in/around Capitol Hill, is beautiful and relaxed. If you want groceries, take-out, restaurant food or anything else, just go up to Broadway street that is the neighboring street to 10th Avenue East. 

The house was pretty much as I expected. Clean sheets/covers and a towel was waiting for me on the bed when I arrived. The rooms, kitchen and bathroom were clean and didn't show neglect. Furnishing was okay. A bit scarce, but that made it easier to feel comfortable and at home. You're not walking on egg shells. 

I didn't get to meet Andrew. But his appointed captain, Timo, was very friendly and welcoming. I at once felt at home and included in the community. I had a great time, and would definitely return to this place."
6561811,44034253,2015-08-23,3495029,Tirdad,"I was in Seattle for a confrence,  I didn't stay in long. I left the house at 9 am and I was just going back after 12 usually and I hope I didn't intrupt others. It is a nice place, have a wonderful balcony for grilling.  And everything was clean. So close to bus station. Only complain is, it has one bathroom so I felt uncomfortable in the morning which I was shaving . I though mybe others need it too."
6561811,45263302,2015-09-01,37275382,Lyle,"Neighborhood was great, lots of great places to each just down Broadway. Mattress and pillows not the greatest."
1511620,7312857,2013-09-15,8265028,Elaine,"I stayed at Io House the day they launched. Some things were still put in place, but Katlyn who was in charge is really nice and made sure that I had everything I need. The house, as mentioned in the description, is really old, but I liked the vintage flare. They did a great job decorating the place which made it really cozy and friendly. Also, the location is perfect. It's in Capitol Hill where there's tons of restaurants and things to do. It's also really convenient to go to downtown Seattle."
1511620,8978017,2013-11-30,8268664,Gustavo,"If you need to be en seattle for a few weeks or month the hacker house is an excellent place to stay. You will have a small family waiting for you. 
Internet is great and there are many places were you cam hangout or work.
The kitchen is fully equiped and you can do your laundry easily.
The cleaning mostly depend on you and your roommates.
My stay in seattle wouldn't have been the same without the hacker house."
1511620,12998648,2014-05-17,2799742,Matthew,"Matt who runs the house is gregarious, awesome and will take care of your needs. The house is a wee bit old but nonetheless has a great community atmosphere with all the interesting people you live with. I typically like to live in a very clean / borderline ocd space and this is an area of improvement they could work on. The location is ideal. Everything you need or want to do is available within a 2 mile walk. And the wifi is always on point."
1511620,17264139,2014-08-10,13687102,Charles,Great place to live. You get to know tons of really cool people. The location is close to groceries and restauraunts. I had amazing time!
1511620,18497385,2014-08-27,7088963,Gabriel & Ka,"(email hidden) house was GREAT- I'll definitely be back if I stay in Seattle again! Everyone was friendly, interesting, and genuinely good people. Great experience, wish I hadn't had to leave a day early :(

The house itself is clean, very open, lots of space and in an awesome neighborhood- artsy but not hipstery, on a quite street with TONS of food, entertainment, bars, etc just one block over. Have a quiet, simple stay, or hit the nightlife, it's up to you :) "
1511620,21397234,2014-10-16,134603,Simon,"the place was awesome. i could chill out and code away and not feel too out of place. the location was good, tons of nearby places to eat or buy groceries. kitchen had quite a few free foods and was stocked well with cooking/eating utensils and the beds were really comfortable. the free laundry down stairs was a great convenience.. as well as being able to park the car in the driveway! the host dude i met was awesome too, super chill and great to talk to."
1511620,42111277,2015-08-11,29855682,Corey,(email hidden) house was a great experience. The place itself was great. Location was perfect and the house had enough room. The house is a bit older but has a lot of character. The cleaning service was a nice touch to keep things clean. The best part about staying here was really for the people. Living with a house full of people from all different backgrounds made my stay. It was great getting to know everyone and making some great friends.
1511620,46750206,2015-09-13,20485599,Eugenia,"I am grateful to Andrew and Timo for welcoming me to their hacker house that empowers growing number of startup minds to organically stimulate one another. During my first week, I was introduced to technology and marketing talents working for some of the most beloved and recognized brands in the world. I also had the pleasure of meeting many thoughtful and inventive minds driven to solve big and meaningful challenges for startups in various industries. Thank you again to ‘Everyone’ that makes IO House possible, you incubate in Seattle a future hub that cultivates an inclusive and collaborative environment for the next startup successes!"
394408,1285865,2012-05-15,2199893,Amy,"Great little ""urban farm"" that's walking distance from Fremont and easy access to Ballard and downtown. We stayed with two kiddos, and it was so fun for our 4 year old to help feed the chickens, watch the baby ducks and play with the two sweet kitties that live here. His only question was, ""Where is the buffalo?""! We loved being able to spread out and relax in the living room. Nice spacious kitchen and beautiful yard. Great neighbors too! We had such fun that we thought about locking Caroline and Paul out upon their return and staying indefinitely!"
394408,1717237,2012-07-16,2147966,Kari,"I'm not sure where to begin.  We rented from Caroline and Paul for an entire month in summer 2012.  The house was perfect.  The location was just up the hill from all the restaurants in Fremont and the Burke-Gilman Trail, allowing us lots of freedom to walk and bike around beaufitul north Seattle.  There are several bus routes to reach the UDistrict, Ballard and downtown as well.

The house itself was adorable.  Very clean and comfortable to live in.  We were here as a family of four, so our daughters slept together upstairs and we slept downstairs.  Caroline and Paul left us cornbread to enjoy with honey from their own bees upon our arrival.  And we found a surprise bag of chocolates with a sweet note at our door mid-stay.  They were overly welcoming and a joy to work with.

The one thing to know is that they have many animals at the house, including chickens, ducks and cats.  We loved caring for them and enjoyed learning about what having chickens is like especially as we are considering it ourselves.  However, if you are not into animials this may not be the place for you.

Overall, if you are looking for a place to truly experience Seattle life - walking, biking, eating in quirky Fremont, busing downtown, caring for chickens (and eating their fresh eggs) - this is the place for you."
394408,1994937,2012-08-15,3020063,Anne,"We had a pleasant stay in Caroline and Paul's home. It is centrally located in the Fremont section of Seattle on a quiet street with off-the-street parking. We enjoyed fresh eggs and honey from Caroline and Paul's hives for breakfast. They have a lovely kitchen and dining room, and two bedrooms and baths. Everything was clean. The stay comes with some animal-feeding duties for the chickens and ducks they keep in their yard so you should only stay here if you like animals and caring for them. They also have a cat who takes care of herself pretty well, with her own little cat door in and out of the house. We were very fortunate to enjoy beautiful weather our entire time in Washington, and Seattle was bathed in glorious sunlight. "
394408,3043401,2012-12-08,1456313,Sarah,"Caroline was an impeccable hostess: organized, informative, and incredibly friendly. Upon arrival, we found a hand-written note encouraging us to consider her home our home for the duration of our stay--what a considerate and warm touch! Living in a stranger's home can be a bit awkward, and there was none of that with Caroline and Paul. Our stay was easy, fun, and a learning experience: we'd never enjoyed duck eggs before, which was quite a treat. The neighborhood was quiet and friendly; we chatted with a neighbor and always found parking on the street and fun in Fremont. What a great spot!"
394408,3097153,2012-12-16,4200458,James,So glad that we ended up staying at Caroline & Paul's rather than checking into a hotel downtown.  The house was really good fun and in a great location for us. Even though I'm English I left the tea behind and couldn't resist the fresh coffee beans and hand grinder each morning.  The duck's added extra charm.  Would recommend the place and stay there again given the chance. 
394408,3166994,2012-12-27,2618398,Nancy,"We had a little family reunion at Caroline's lovely home in (email hidden)t up with our son and his wife for Christmas. The  house was perfect, great location, plenty of room, great spots to sit and visit and a dining room table for means, games and coffee. We loved it. Lovely view, duck eggs (thanks  girls), and nice neighbors. We cooked, talked, walked, and had a rockin good time. highly recommend.
thanks Caroline...loved the kitchen maps..."
394408,3199280,2012-12-31,4289330,Amy,"My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed staying here.  Not only did it fill our basic need of 2 beds in Seattle, we also appreciated experience the flavor of Seattle that Caroline lives (recycling, composting, energy efficiency and DUCKS in the back yard!!)  We cannot say enough how much we enjoyed dotting our day with ""what are the ducks doing??""  We were also impressed with Caroline's collection of cast iron pans and Prince CDs!  There were good eateries and places to get coffee/drinks in the neighborhood and the PCC grocery store is a gem.  The house is near a variety of busses, so we had no need to rent a car while staying here.  

We are very happy we opted for the Airbnb option over a hotel.  We thank Caroline for hosting us in our first visit to Seattle!"
394408,4933288,2013-06-03,5006351,Gabe,"Caroline's place is truly a sweet home in Fremont.  Far enough away to be quiet, but close enough to stumble home from nano breweries, and get the most delicious coffee in the morning that Seattle has to offer.  The ducks are a riot!!  The Brewery Cafe was a big hit!!  I'd stay again and again.  "
394408,5174360,2013-06-17,5002538,Mary,"Caroline's home was everything that she said it would be.  It was easy to find, comfortable and pleasant. She even left us a loaf of bread and honey from her own bees.  We didn't take care of the ducks, but enjoyed them when we were there at the house. The neighbors were friendly, too.  
It worked out well for us to stay there and we enjoyed making coffee in the mornings and lounging around before our busy days began.
Thanks Caroline very much."
394408,5595622,2013-07-08,4019101,Amanda,"We were in the area for a wedding, and loved staying in this ""sweet home in the heart of Fremont""! We had everything we needed in the house, and there were plenty of restaurants within walking distance. I can't speak for public transportation to downtown Seattle though, if that's what you're interested in, as we rented a car for all our wedding festivities. Oh, and watching the fireworks from the rooftop will no doubt be one of the highlights of my year - just be careful, the railing up there is a little wobbly!

We cared for the ducks ourselves, but that was our choice. I'm glad we did, because they were so darned cute. It put a smile on my face at the beginning of each day, watching them parade out of their coop and into their little pond :) Caroline did offer to have the neighbors care for the ducks if we preferred, and in fact they did help out one evening when we couldn't be there. We met said neighbors, and they were super friendly - they even invited us to join their bonfire! If you're concerned about the bees, don't be. They keep to themselves. We barely noticed them.

Thank you Caroline - if I ever make it back to Seattle, I'm checking with you first to see if your place is available!r"
394408,6145599,2013-08-01,5438997,Jessica,"Caroline and Paul's home was perfect for our stay in Seattle.  The kitchen had everything you needed and more.  We loved the amazing energy of the home and how comfortable we felt staying there.  The ducks were soooo much fun to wake up to every morning, especially for our two little girls who loved following them around the yard.  Caroline and Paul were so wonderful and lovely to work with.  Would recommend this home to anyone looking to stay in Seattle.  We also loved the neighbors. :)"
394408,8477972,2013-11-02,7598340,Marcy,What a great place to stay for my first AirBnB experience! The house was very cosy and in a great spot for visiting my family in Ballard (as well as close to the city).  My daughter had a great time looking after the ducks and even made an omelette for herself.  Caroline is a great host and very helpful with information throughout the whole process.
394408,8666183,2013-11-11,9553908,Carrie,"We had a fantastic time in Seattle and staying at Caroline's was great! It was really nice coming back from a long day of walking and sight seeing and being greeted with a comfy, cozy home. The neighborhood was cute, and in great walking distance to lots of food! The house was adorable, clean and the pet ducks were a great bonus!"
394408,9626612,2014-01-03,679048,Lacy,"Caroline's house was so visitor friendly! I enjoyed how cozy it felt, but not at all small! Great use of space and the prefect retreat for NYE! The ducks were great as well and I even was able to fry up an egg thanks to the neighbor! Loved it. Everything. Thanks for letting us use your home!"
394408,12024679,2014-04-21,4871153,Jack,"House is exactly as advertised, very comfortable and very clean. Caroline was an excellent host providing recommendations on things to do and even a stock of breat butter and cheese which along with the fresh duck eggs made for great breakfast! Nice to see a local Seattle neighborhood too while still very accessible to Downtown and nearby Ballard."
394408,13301275,2014-05-25,9730551,Ana,"Thank you so much for providing a wonderful, welcoming, and homey spot for my family when they were in town. It was wonderful to meet you guys too! "
394408,15023953,2014-07-01,10698983,Jodee,"We had a great time in this house!  My son loved the ducks....lots of quacking all weekend :-D  A quaint and cozy house in a cute part of town.  She had great instructions for the house and fun suggestions for nearby things to do. So nice to have a nice place to go back to that also has some fun aspects for my toddler! 
Also the duck egg breakfast we made was fantastic :D"
394408,15390653,2014-07-08,4288000,Marye,"Caroline and Paul's cozy home in the wonderfully quirky Fremont neighborhood was everything we wanted in a vacation spot.  The house was spotless and had everything we needed for our meals, relaxation, and a good nights' rest.  Our son especially enjoyed caring for the ducks and looking for eggs each morning.  Caroline was very responsive to our emails and easy to work with.  Thanks for a great stay!"
394408,16969062,2014-08-05,11563665,Nils,"We had an excellent time staying in Caroline and Paul's house in Fremont. It was exactly the space we needed for the two kids and the location was perfect. Easy walking distance to the zoo and good bus connections to Downtown, Ballard and the University area. We enjoyed ourselves very much. The ducks were a particular highlight with the kids. Very entertaining. "
394408,23523118,2014-12-03,10924107,Pam,Caroline and Paul are wonderful people!  The house was perfect for our family Thanksgiving celebration.  All of our questions prior and during our stay were answered in a gracious manner.  It was evident that the goal was for us to enjoy our time - and we did just that!  
394408,24421497,2014-12-28,23780039,Daina,"House was clean. Quiet, eclectic neighborhood.  Close to good restaurants.  Tile work in the basement bathroom was quite delightful.  Good music selection. Bed was comfortable and had warm blankets.  The brochures were a nice touch.  Downstairs bedroom has a low ceiling, if you are 6'2"" or taller, be prepared to duck."
394408,28597648,2015-03-27,22923112,Alan,"We really enjoying at Caroline and Paul's home. The neighborhood was beautiful, the house was comfortable and clean and they were excellent hosts. My grandson really loved seeing the ducks. I would definitely stay here the next time I visit Seattle. "
394408,33076208,2015-05-25,18476262,Emily,"Caroline was great and her house was beautiful. We were happy with every part of our experience there. She had a delicious craft beer (and many neighborhood maps and guides) waiting for us when we got there and both she and Paul were kind and welcoming when we ran into them during their work on the backyard cottage. 

This eco-friendly home was very cool. We loved the tile work in the basement bathroom and the map collage wallpaper in the kitchen. 

I would say to be careful about committing to sleep in the basement bedroom if you are very tall, the ceilings are quite low. If you aren't very tall (over maybe 6'2""?) it shouldn't be any problem.

Free street parking was a breeze and we drove less than 5 minutes to amazing food and beer most of the weekend. We didn't have much of a chance to explore the area on foot because we were only in town briefly but it seemed like a great neighborhood all around.

Overall I would definitely recommend this place! We had no issues at all and would love to stay there again if we ever need an airbnb in Seattle again."
394408,33903769,2015-06-02,19469004,Denise,"Yes, we felt very much at home.... loved peeking in at the ducks! They even offered us duck eggs! Loved the ""Theo"" chocolate on the table along with all the helpful maps and attractions of the area. Thank you for the lovely stay, felt very much a part of the Seattle culture and LOVE Fremont Coffee house!!!! My personal new fave! "
394408,34054655,2015-06-04,11878378,Sunny,"It's a very nice and clean house in a good neighborhood. The hosts were very communicative. They also left eggs for us to use. The house has one bedroom on the ground floor and another bedroom in the basement. During our stay, the basement bedroom was quite cold and we didn't get the heating system to work for the basement. Anyways, the stay was good overall. I would recommend this place to other guests! "
394408,34634193,2015-06-10,23884428,Vida,"Enjoyed a lovely stay in Seattle, our hosts were very helpful with tips and directions when we met them on arrival and the house is very nice. We liked the library outside the front door and the fun things to do in Freemont, it was easy to drive downtown too."
394408,35399412,2015-06-18,29532392,Mike,"Caroline made us feel very welcome in her home. She was very responsive with communications and instructions to access the house where great. The place was very close to the heart of Fremont and the Seattle center. They did a great job renovating their home, very eco friendly and comfortable. And the ducks were very cute !"
394408,35907193,2015-06-23,143236,Polly,"We were welcomed with a Theo (made in Seattle) chocolate bar next to a note on the coffee table.  This is one of the nicest places I have ever stayed in and the pictures give a very good idea.  The fridge and pantry were full of delights, including fresh duck eggs!  The kitchen is very well stocked with equipment, including a bullet coffee grinder.  We had all our breakfasts and one dinner there in our 4-night stay.  Caroline and Paul gave us some good suggestions regarding the Freemont Solstice Festival and got back to me right away when I had questions.  I can heartily recommend this home to others, as long as they have no problem with steps (a few to enter the house) and hills, as the neighborhood is very hilly!"
394408,36666568,2015-06-30,30968023,Aimee,"LOVED staying here! We were left several guides, some great local chocolate, and even duck eggs to try :) The house was beautiful and had a great location so we were able to walk around and explore Fremont, or take an Uber for under $20 to get to a near by city. I met Paul and Caroline and they were both very kind. I would absolutely stay here again if I had the opportunity."
394408,37035156,2015-07-04,3011045,Sarah,"We met the hosts when we arrived and they were very sweet and welcoming. The neighborhood was as described and close to many things.  The house is a little quirky, but well taken care of with love."
394408,38906125,2015-07-19,21799966,Theresa,"3 of us were in Seattle to visit family and friends, and this was the perfect place for us. The house is clean, spacious, and gave us convenient access to where we wanted to be.  Caroline was also terrific: easy to get in touch with and very welcoming even though we didn’t actually meet in person. She kindly left us bread, etc. along with an invitation to try the duck eggs for breakfast (which we did—yum!).  "
394408,41195436,2015-08-05,301697,Edward,"Enjoyed our stay in Seattle thanks to our comfortable accommodations!  The house was cozy and the beds were comfortable.  It's a great location, close to Ballard Locks, Woodland Park Zoo, and downtown Seattle.  We enjoyed walking up and down the hills to explore the Fremont area.  We would recommend this home to anyone visiting the Seattle area.  Thanks for sharing your home with us!"
394408,52979201,2015-11-03,41057472,Doyle,"We consider ourselves fortunate to have had this home opened to us.  We were able to relax and unwind after the classes we took.  It is out of the way, well appointed and cared for.  The beds are comfortable.  This was a really enjoyable stay for us.  The instructions are very clear for taking care of the property."
394408,53467741,2015-11-09,29513749,Morgan,"The house was as lovely as my communications with Caroline (which were all great).  Stayed for a friend's wedding in Fremont, and the house was convenient, well-stocked, and cozy.  Wonderful all around.  The ducks were a bit noisy in the morning, but I'll let that one slide ;) "
8327083,56132955,2015-12-09,23861567,Jamie,Our experience at Joes house was great!! It is in such a great neighborhood and the house itself is amazing!!! Will for sure be staying again next time I am in Seattle! Thanks so much Joe. 
8617043,49732933,2015-10-05,34802665,Julia,I really love my stay at Esther's place. The bed is so soft and comfortable. It takes only few minutes walking to the alki beach. Esther is so friendly and interesting. The best   Company from her make my travel in Seattle so happy and sunny.
8617043,54798504,2015-11-23,7742581,Andrea,"Esther’s place is decorated by a true artist, a poet in her case. Her and Rae, her dog, are warm, friendly and incredibily accommodating. You cannot beat the location. It is walking distance from some amazing restaurants, especially Cassis!"
8617043,55418406,2015-12-01,47419007,Michael,"Esther was pleasant and welcoming.  The accommodations were as advertised and quite comfortable.  Her house was conveniently located for us, walking distance to Alki Beach restaurants and night spots.   I would definitely return when we visit Seattle again."
3124383,16715645,2014-08-01,13524667,Ahmad,"I am at loss of words for my stay at this wonderful home in Maple Leaf, Seattle. Me and my girlfriend had the pleasure of staying with Jodi for a month, and we felt right at home throughout our stay. The day I stepped in the house, I had no doubt that we'd be really comfortable. And, by the time we left, I had this sinking feeling of leaving behind a lifelong friend.

We got to stay in a wonderfully decorated room. Like the rest of the house, the room was adorned with different things from Jodi's travels - and she has traveled a lot. The bed was comfortable to sleep in, and the sheets were magically changed every 2 weeks. The closet had ample space to keep the loads of things I had. In fact, I had more stuff than what could fit in the closet, but Jodi found me a place to tuck away my things. The washroom was next to the room - and like other things, it was also fashioned with memorabilia from Jodi's travels. Also, it was stocked with everything from towels to shaving foam. The bottom line was that she made sure that both of us were always comfortable.

I did a lot of cooking while staying at Jodi's. I had some things to cook with, but being in Seattle for only a couple of months, I didn't feel the need to buy every pot and pan. Everyday when I was missing a mug or peppers or plates I wanted, Jodi insisted on me using hers, saying that I didn't need to ask for permission. It felt more like cooking at my parents' place. And, she graciously set aside a lot of room in her fridge for us.

Ever day when I came back from work, we sometimes talked to her for a few minutes and at times for a couple of hours. But, the discussion always was far from being banal, and more about sharing our experiences. So if I was looking for a sympathetic ear, I knew I didn't have to look  for long, since Jodi was there. 

If I come to Seattle again, I wouldn't think twice about staying Jodi's place. I already miss her, and I hope our paths cross again."
3124383,17211250,2014-08-09,16309109,Linda,"Jodi made us feel very welcome.  Her home was very lovely and comfortable.  She made us banana bread one day and shared fruit with us.  Coffee was wonderful!  She let us leave our little dog there one day while we explored Seattle.  This is my first trip to use airbnb and 2/3 of our experiences were wonderful. I would love to stay with her if we return to Seattle.  I plan to look up her other listing when we go to Mexico.  She was very informative about the area and we asked a lot of questions since we are considering a move to the PNW.  

I was very impressed with how she had her travel momentos displayed throughout her home.  I also appreciated how cool it was even though it was warm outside.    "
3124383,32127797,2015-05-14,31628927,Maranda,"I had a wonderful 13-day stay at Jodi's house. That was such a good place to live in in Seattle. The room is nice and clean, and I had full access to a private bathroom, kitchen and living room. Jodi always being nice to me and I really appreciate the coffee made by Jodi in the morning. What's more, one thing I really appreciate is that, Jodi always left a light for me every night in the kitchen, which makes me so comfortable and welcomed when I came back late each night. : ) I also enjoyed a short and brief talk with Jodi every morning, sometimes with Jodi's families as well. I will definitely chooses to live in this place next time visiting Seattle, and I will also recommend my friends to stay in Jodi's house if they need some place to live in in Seattle. Thanks a lot, Jodi. Miss you~ "
3124383,32291342,2015-05-16,25321010,Anita,"The bedroom is located in a cozy apartment, 2nd floor. Private bathroom and both bedroom and bathroom are driectly at the entrance. Jodi tries her best to make your stay as comfortable as possible. We got fruit and her amazing bananabread for breakfast! 
"
3124383,33118653,2015-05-25,31461136,Alanna,Jodi is an extremely welcoming and pleasant host who goes above and beyond. There was a lovely homely atmosphere in the apartment and it was a brief walk to the local amenities.  A wonderful place to stay in a tranquil leafy neighborhood!
3124383,34024931,2015-06-03,28883377,Ken,"Jodi was a wonderful host and is a great lady. She was very informative about the area and we had some great discussions during my Stacy She is very generous and offered what she had.  Her banana bread was amazing and she knows how to pick out great fruit. The room was comfortable and the bathroom was clean; and the location was great for me, close to shops, groceries, and a gym.  The #77 is real close and got me downtown in under 20 minutes. I hope to book again soon. "
3124383,34447543,2015-06-08,4600607,Alida,Jody was very welcoming. The place was exactly as described. Our bedroom was quiet and comfortable and very clean. Our dedicated bathroom was nice with a good shower and also very clean. Jodi welcomed us by offering food and conversation. She invited us to sit on the deck to enjoy the evening breeze. The room was not noisy and the mattress was comfortable. One of our best AirBNB stays!!!
3124383,35230236,2015-06-16,3287150,Saeed,"Jodi is very kind and friendly. She checked in with me before I arrive and immediately responded to my call when I arrived. She showed me the place and gave me the keys.
The room is nicely decorated. It is almost convenient because both the room and the bathroom are close to the apartment entrance, so I did not have to bother Jodi when coming/going.
The building is old but comfortable. There was some noise during my stay but I was mostly out so it didn't bother me that much."
3124383,37081088,2015-07-04,1029862,Jovan,"Jodi was such a welcoming and accommodating host! Her apartment was stuffed with books and photos, all to my taste, and a brief visit with her family warmed me. All that on a hothot Seattle holiday weekend in preparation. I enjoyed my weekend with my daughter, and, was grateful for the graciousness of Jodi. "
3124383,37458243,2015-07-07,15825570,Jane,Jodi is really enthusiastic and kind host that I've ever met! Her tiny little apartment is such warm and comfortable! I really highly recommend Jodi's airbnb and her as to be a nice friend.
3124383,37928432,2015-07-11,37451290,Scott,"This was a delightful stay - and a lucky find, as it was a last-minute reservation.  Jodi is a 'together' person, and therefore someone who is easy to be around.  Felt a friendly presence form the start, and it grew over the short two days I was there.  Hope to return if/when in Seattle again."
3124383,38196962,2015-07-13,2486419,Valentina,"The house of Jodi was comfortable,clean and in a quite and safe zone.Jodi is very kind and it 's a pleasure  to talk with her"
3124383,39044131,2015-07-20,34771927,Elsa,"Jodi is a very kind and gracious host and my sister and I had a wonderful time staying with her. She was very accommodating, even when we were a little late checking in, and made us feel welcome in her home. The banana bread she made for breakfast was super delicious! We really enjoyed our time here and highly recommend it!"
3124383,39815396,2015-07-26,37530225,Ai,"This is my first time using Airbnb, and staying at Jodi's definitely helped leaving me a great impression of it. Jodi is super hospitable, very warm, and easy to get along with. In addition, the bed in our room is quite comfortable. We rented a car when we were in Seattle, and judging from my experience driving from/to Jodi's place, the location of her house is quite convenient. Also the Italian restaurant downstairs is pretty good. Will definitely stay at Jodi's again next time when I visit Seattle!"
3124383,40796254,2015-08-02,37488800,Whimsy,Loved this location. Jodi is great and the area is very beautiful. Highly recommend.
3124383,46004719,2015-09-07,1425748,Selwa,Jodi was a wonderful host. She was easy to communicate with when we needed to be flexible with our schedule. She had coffee ready to go each morning. The place was clean and very inviting. We could have spent hours looking at her art work and books. Our only regret was not being able to visit with her more. 
3124383,48121496,2015-09-23,43739982,Gabriela,Jodi was a gracious and attentive host. The room and bathroom were beautifully decorated and spotless clean. Her place is amazingly cozy and her warm personality will make you feel right at home. 
3124383,48991884,2015-09-30,1674395,Cristal,"Jodi was a wonderful, accommodating, friendly and very welcoming host. Before my arrival, she gave me information about how I would get there by public transit (since I didn't have a car). And when I arrived, she helped me figure out which bus to take to the University. Her space is very warm and lovely. It was a huge plus to have access to your own bathroom since I was an early morning riser and didn't want to disturb Jodi. I will highly recommend Jodi's Place to friends who plan to visit Seattle in the near future. "
3124383,50107711,2015-10-09,42759229,Hui,"Very happy can meet you in Seattle, your home is a collection of art, every details reveal your heart, is very pleasing. Room is very clean and warm, I heard that I want to buy some things for me to write down the address in detail the patient tells us how to go. We have prepared many food breakfast back. You are super kind and nice man. Our trip to the United States is a perfect full stop. Sincerely wish you a happy and healthy happy over each day. Hope we have a chance to Seattle. Bye. More hope one day you come to Beijing a guest, and we welcome you very much.

很开心在西雅图可以认识你，你的家简直就是一个艺术珍藏馆，每一处装饰细节都透露出你的用心，都非常赏心悦目。房间非常干净和温馨，听说我要买一些东西帮我详细写下地址耐心的告诉我们如何前往。早餐还给我们准备了许多食物。你真是超级亲切又善良的人。为我们的美国之行画上完美的句号。真心祝福你开开心心健健康康快快乐乐的渡过每一天。希望有机会我们西雅图再见。更希望有天你来北京做客，我们非常欢迎你。"
3124383,50769241,2015-10-14,7053116,Marion,"Jodi was very helpful and welcoming. Accommodated our late arrival time graciously. Bedroom and bathroom satisfied our needs. Had an opportunity to meet her lovely family and she very kindly let us prepare dinner in her kitchen one night. 

Great location. Easy parking in front of the complex with a coffee shop and gas station within walking distance. 

Wonderful experience."
3124383,51446848,2015-10-20,42119144,Siobhan,"Staying at Jodi's place is like staying with family, except without any of the awkwardness or obligation. The place itself is extremely warm & welcoming, as is Jodi. She's full of great tips and recommendations, and regularly has delicious home-baked goodies on-hand. Super comfortable room with private bath, this exceeded my expectations. I can't recommend her place highly enough!"
3124383,55603274,2015-12-03,4406363,Penny,"Staying with Jodi was a joy; she is warm, loving, generous, and helpful. We felt like family from the moment we met her and it was much easier to share the space with her than I would have guessed. Moreover, the apartment was very well located for our needs and though we had to use on/street parking,it was always available right across the street. The only problem, from my point of view, is the age/quality of the building. The building is relatively new, but not in my view, especially well kept up. There does not appear to have been any attempt to update or renovate any of the spaces, public or private, and the deterioration shows. Also, the room is smallish so that there is no space for an easy chair in it should a guest wish to relax in privacy. That having been said, the positives will far outweigh the negatives for many, if not most, people. FYI, my husband and I are 76 (almost 77) and 71 which may explain my issues. But one could not ask for a more lovely hostess."
3899160,28968209,2015-04-01,29981070,Beverly,I had a lovely stay with Molly and her family. They were most welcoming. The room was cozy and quiet. The bath is shared with the children but access was never a problem. Their home is at the end of a street in a quiet neighborhood. I would definately stay there again.
3899160,30360320,2015-04-20,31163992,Andy,"A wonderful, clean room in a great part of Seattle. Molly was very accommodating, especially given the last-minute nature of my stay. Smaller amenities were also provided, such as fresh fruit, a bottle of water, and even a new toothbrush and toothpaste.

The house in general was very clean and tidy, the bed was comfortable, and I was able to come and go easily even relatively late at night. Overall a great host that I would recommend highly."
3899160,33394025,2015-05-27,3739197,Jeffrey,"The Sheffields were absolutely amazing, very accommodating and easy to talk to. The location was at an amazing part of Seattle with a wonderful view of the city. Room was decorated in a very cute way, I had a great time!"
3899160,33961918,2015-06-02,33699354,Ungsumalynn,"I absolutely loved the Sheffield's home. I thought it was everything like the description and the pictures. Molly has a lovely home. Not only that, but she and her family were very welcoming and made me feel right at home! The room is very cute and everything about it felt cozy! I had no problems with the family or the home. The location was great, everything was just great! If I ever travel back to Seattle, I'll be sure to book with Molly again!"
3899160,35265811,2015-06-16,31765467,Chris,"Molly & David were great! They were kind & gave me insights into exploring Seattle. The accommodations were perfect. Their home is beautiful, clean, and quiet. I could have asked for nothing more. Except they even had amenities, bottled water, and even a printer awaiting me in the guest room. Awesome!  If I ever make it back to Seattle, Molly & David's home will be the first place I look to stay.   "
3899160,35858299,2015-06-22,4423542,Matt,"Molly has a nice place in a quiet cul-de-sac with a great view of the lake, certainly a pleasant spot in the city. Molly was helpful and friendly, and the room was comfy, so I had a nice stay. Do realize, as Molly states in the listing, that you're staying in a townhouse with a young family. Nothing wrong with that -- some will find it a plus, some a minus -- just worth pointing out so that you know what you're getting. "
3899160,36977677,2015-07-03,34044420,Sarah,"I had a wonderful stay at Molly's place. The room was quite and comfortable. She has a cute family, very well behaved kids and spectacular view from the rooftop deck! Molly is a wonderful and gracious host!! I would recommend her place to anyone."
3899160,38545802,2015-07-16,35390615,Amanda,My stay at Molly's home was fantastic. I arrived super late and she waited up on me which she didnt have to do but i am thankful for. The view from the roof top is amazing. My room was nice and neat just like the pictures. Molly was very friendly with answering all the questions i had about Washington.
3899160,39249337,2015-07-21,29510233,Christine,"My stay at Molly's was wonderful. The room was just as pictured, including some water bottles. Room was a bit warm being that the temp was the highest it had been this summer but for the price, location and such easy access to public transportation coffee and food, it was just what I needed.  
"
3899160,39855257,2015-07-26,7323637,Li,Great family and great house. Clean cozy and comfortable. Would for sure stay again! Thank you :)
3899160,41131271,2015-08-04,38481871,Christian,Molly and her family were very welcoming. She was extremely flexible with the hours I arrived and left which was amazing! My room was very close to the entrance and very accessible to the bathroom. It was extremely clean and very comfortable. I had a lot of privacy and the whole family was very helpful. The location of the house was amazing and a quick bus ride to downtown. It was a fantastic experience overall.
3899160,42630834,2015-08-14,40997841,Ben,"The Sheffields were absolutely wonderful. The room and accommodations were exactly what I needed, and Molly and her family were very warm and friendly. I was in town looking for an apartment, and they provided me with a great home base where I could relax after a long day of walking around. The location is great, too -- a few blocks from the 5 bus to downtown, and also a few blocks from the stores on Fremont Ave. An excellent stay!"
3899160,43400818,2015-08-19,38909982,Jon,"I had a great stay at Molly's! Great hosts, great room and a great location. Got to travel a lot about in the state, but always felt welcome when I was at the house. 
Easy access with parking for my rental car right outside and a nice welcome after a long flight from Norway. Everything I needed on arrival was there and made my stay even better.

Thanks a lot for your hospitality and for welcoming to Seattle!"
3899160,44331527,2015-08-25,39729851,Hillary,"Great location!  This area has the flexibility of walking to places or hopping in a car to go to others in minutes.  If you need a room to stay, this is a great spot to come and go.  A nice safe place to rest at night, and get back out the next day to enjoy all Seattle has to offer.

Molly and her family were all kind and welcoming.  Thank you!"
3899160,44831810,2015-08-29,41482065,Lynne,The room was spotless and comfortable. Very nice neighborhood!
3899160,45591718,2015-09-04,20456426,Daniel,Great location to stay! Molly was a great host and her family was awesome as well. The room was perfect for my needs. I would highly recommend this if you're traveling alone. 
3899160,45956108,2015-09-07,24734906,Lillian,"Molly's house is perfectly located in the Fremont area of Seattle, which is totally walkable and features good views from every angle! The room is small but adorable, and the bed is very comfortable. Plenty of privacy, perfect for a weekend."
3899160,46906759,2015-09-14,22246290,Christina,I was in and out of town for a short trip. Molly's place was perfect. The place was clean and as described. Molly and her family are very nice and laid back. Since it was a smaller room I would recommend it for shorter trips or if you plan on spending most of your time out and about.
3899160,47987899,2015-09-22,2466175,Mary,"Molly is a lovely and welcoming host. The room is comfortable, and the house is in a nice neighborhood that is well connected by bus to other parts of town. It was a perfect base for a busy weekend visit."
3899160,48455631,2015-09-26,44154712,Natalie,"Molly was a fantastic host. She emailed me in advance to touch base and set up my check in time.  She met me upon arrival and made me feel welcome. The pictures are accurate. The room is small, clean and comfortable.  The water pressure in the shower is great!"
3899160,48969914,2015-09-29,44315305,David,"Molly and the family were very welcoming and the room was small, ideal, clean and great! "
3899160,52185205,2015-10-26,47117997,Vassily,"All I needed was to spend two nights in that area, and this place worked perfectly."
3899160,55522208,2015-12-01,46695273,Stephan,"Great location, quiet but still close to all the restaurants/coffee shops in the vibrant neighborhoods of Fremont/Ballard and just a short ride from downtown. Thank you Molly & David for the warm welcome to your supernice home, I really enjoyed my stay with you!"
3843706,30437478,2015-04-22,4243206,Jill,"Marianne and her husband were wonderful hosts!  They were very accommodating and their house is very comfortable.  The house is in a great location--close to I-5, three blocks from Whole Foods and Starbucks, and just a block from a local coffee shop and small grocery store.  It's close to the University, without being a ""college"" neighborhood.  It's nice and quiet and comfortable.  We couldn't have asked for a better experience.   "
3843706,48406623,2015-09-26,21057403,Michael,"Perfect for UW visits.  House is beautiful, clean, and has everything you need for a comfortable stay.  Dine out or cook for yourself.  Parking was no problem.  Easy highway access to downtown or daytrips."
3505739,16049477,2014-07-20,18280423,Wendy," The neighborhood was nice, beautiful houses. You can see why residents of West Seattle love living there.  The house sits on a busy street, but the living space is quite far away from the street so it's very quite and peaceful.  It feels much more remote than it actually is. The view is amazing!  The house is nicely decorated. The living area is very spacious. There are big windows looking out over Alki Beach and the sound to the Olympic Mountains and beautiful sunsets.  It's a very short walk (5-10 minutes) to the beach and restaurants.  You do have to take several steps down from the street to the front door. The host was very helpful and accomodating."
3505739,16786789,2014-08-02,2356762,Mary,"Shauna has a wonderful Alki Beach view home that provides quick access to Alki Beach, a beautiful water and mountain view, as well as all the comforts that make for a relaxing vacation.  We loved that the house was quiet, comfortable, and relaxing while just a quick walk away from one of Seattle's best beaches.  Shauna was a great host, providing everything we needed and just a text message away if we had a question.  We would love to stay with her again when we're in the area and recommend her without reservation!"
3505739,16932241,2014-08-04,18343614,Linda,Had a great time. The view from the condo huge windows was awsome. Nice quite neighborhood with its own pathway. The place was clean and inviting.
3505739,17455483,2014-08-12,266436,Thoi,"About 4 blocks to the beach and all the restaurants in Alki Beach. The weather was great, we walked to Alki Beach for the gorgeous vistas, ice cream cones, and people watching. Shauna's place was spacious and had nice views of the water and mountains. Lincoln Park is a short drive away- the  best park ever, with so many different areas..including a nice paved trailed next to the water with no cars in site..just trees, water, mountains."
3505739,17646160,2014-08-15,2930805,Jessica,The view from the deck is spectacular and it was great to hang out there and BBQ and just watch the boats go by. I like how quick it is to get downtown from there. The place is really spacious and comfortable and I would definitely stay there again.
3505739,18179768,2014-08-23,17896272,Claudia,"Great place with view even better than shown in picture.  Everything worked, convenient cozy place to stay...We didn't want to leave!!"
3505739,18254454,2014-08-24,4953964,Zachary,"Shauna's house was great! The listing description was spot on - It's a 5-10 minute walk to Alki Beach, with a deck with gorgeous views. The house itself is spacious, comfortable, and surprisingly quiet at night. Shauna was a very responsive host, and made us feel completely at home."
3505739,18811464,2014-09-01,1870968,Kamrun,"Great communication, great place, great location. We were happy. Thank you Shauna for lettin us stay ! "
3505739,20339023,2014-09-28,18829568,Lewis,"I had a fantastic time! Shauna was a awesome host! Just minutes from the beach, restaurants, bicycle rentals, and the bus stop. There is even a free bus that will take you to the water taxi! It was so easy to get all the way to downtown Seattle for just $4.75. Of course best of all is that amazing view and BBQ!! I absolutely loved it and I recommend it to anyone. "
3505739,20579147,2014-10-01,9192817,Sureyya,"Shauna's place was very spacious and peaceful in a nice neighborhood. She responded quickly whenever I have requested information. Kithcen and bathroom was equiped perfectly. Bed was really comfortable.  It had a wonderful deck which I spent lots of time. It is only 5-10 min. walk to the beach where you can find nice restaurants. Cactus&Alki Cafe had good food and fine atmosphere. I have extended my stay for 3 more days. Shauna, thanks again for being such a nice host and I promise to remember you whenever we play eith your frisbee which I have accidentally taken with me. "
3505739,20971459,2014-10-08,4144412,Sophiya,"Shauna was super responsive to our needs. Her place was immaculate and the view ..just jaw dropping. The place was super cozy and clean. It was just picture perfect. I really love the fact that the area where the house was located was perfect for my dog. She enjoyed her walks on the park that was right down the street. She also loved the beach. The location was perfect too. Didn't have to drive too long to get to downtown at all. Will definitely be back again.

Thank you!"
3505739,21170627,2014-10-12,22067909,Cory,The place was exactly as advertised. Great water view from the living room and the deck out back. Close to coffee shops and Alki Beach. I would highly recommend staying here to anyone going to Seattle. 
3505739,21593780,2014-10-20,20271332,Pamela,"Shauna's place is well-equipped and in a great location in West Seattle. There is a nice deck with a grill and view of the water- a perfect place to relax after a hike or exploring Seattle. It had everything we were looking for, including comfortable bed and furniture and nice kitchen and bath. Overall an easy place to call home for a week. :)"
3505739,22238555,2014-11-02,17470229,Patrick,"Shauna made us feel very welcome! Her home was very nice, and she took the extra time to put up decorations for my fiance's Birthday!! Talk about unexpected, and awesome :) I highly recommend this listing."
3505739,22676059,2014-11-11,10113799,Janet,"This rental was fabulous!  We thoroughly enjoyed our 10 day stay.  The home has all the amenities needed for a comfortable stay - cozy furniture, large screen TV, kitchen with everything needed to prepare meals, and a bedroom with an increibly comfortable bed. To top it off, there is a nice view of Puget Sound with the Olympic mountains in the background.  The home is also in a very nice location - within walking distance to the beach, restaurants and a beautiful park.
Shauna was very responsive and accommodating - wonderful host! 
"
3505739,23527982,2014-12-03,7433434,Jeff,"Shauna went out of her way to accommodate us in our stay. When booking the reservation, she responded immediately and made very thoughtful suggestions. 

The property is very comfortable, spacious, and the view is better than advertised. Location is perfect for getting around West Seattle. We loved walks down then path behind the home to the beach and the coffee shops and restaurants nearby the water."
3505739,24368165,2014-12-27,4853976,Michelle,"The view was phenomenal!  Location was great. Easy access to get downtown, close to Alki Beach, Lincoln Park and ferry to Vashon. The apartment was bigger than it appears in photos, was clean, comfortable and inviting. Shauna was a perfect hostess. Responsive, helpful and thoughtful. "
3505739,25100241,2015-01-06,18214124,Ed,This place was perfect for us and Shauna provided just what we needed for a most enjoyable visit. I had expressed our interest in a quiet place to rest that still had access to the best of Seattle. It was indeed quiet and comfortable and travel to Seattle was convenient. It was so helpful to have the eating and activity tips that Shauna left. Nice to have the insight of a Seattle native. And she provided just the right level of support. We never met personally . . . but I always felt she was accessible if we needed help. . . . Thanks for a most relaxing time!
3505739,27052830,2015-02-24,1132018,Jody,"Shauna and her awesome rental just blocks from Alki were a lifesaver. My partner, myself and our two kitties were homeless for 26 days while we waited for our new home to close but we had to be out of our apartment. We found Shauna's listing and were very much at home while waiting for our forever home. The place was clean, spacious and convenient. She was an excellent host and let us do our own thing. And those views!!!!!  So amazing. Highly recommend. "
3505739,28100436,2015-03-17,28809636,Nancy,"Wow - gorgeous view, quiet home and an amazing host in Shauna. If anything, it was even MORE beautiful than the pictures portray. We were welcomed with a nice note and information on restaurants, walking trails, etc. Peaceful and relaxing - can't wait to return."
3505739,28430800,2015-03-23,29102240,Sandy,This was our first AirBnB experience and it was excellent all around.  Shauna was great to work with and was very responsive.  We were greeted with a nice welcome letter with a lovely bottle of wine.  The house was very clean.  The bedroom was nice and the bed very comfortable.  The view was fantastic! The house is a short walk to Alki beach.  We also took a hike at Schmitz Park just a block up the road.  Thank you Shauna for opening up your space. I would not hesitate to stay here again.
3505739,28826505,2015-03-30,29334367,Rhonda,"This space was perfect for a girls weekend with my daughters.   Shauna was very helpful and provided great recommendations.  Home has plenty of room, wonderful views, neat & well designed and best of all was very close to the beach and restaurants.  Surprisingly easily to get to other places in Seattle too.  I would love to stay here again.

3505739,29607321,2015-04-10,27775655,Ulrike,"Am Tag vor unserem Eintreffen schrieb uns Shauna schon nette Worte und teilte uns alles Nötige mit. Als wir das Haus betreten haben, haben wir uns sofort zuhause gefühlt. Auf dem Tisch stand zur Begrüßung eine Flasche Rotwein und daneben lag eine supernette Willkommenskarte. Auch in der Küche gab es alles, was wir brauchten. Die Unterkunft entsprach genau den veröffentlichten Fotos , auch der Ausblick war mindestens genauso schön."
3505739,29858123,2015-04-13,29716159,Amber,"The location of this home is beyond surreal! An extremely cozy, warm, welcoming home with one of the best views and a short few blocks to the beach! Also, a short drive to downtown. By far exceeded our expectations. We felt comfortable and at home for the three days we were there and definitely plan on going back and staying there in the future! I would highly recommend this to anyone. Great vibes made for an amazing vacation!   "
3505739,30311561,2015-04-20,29446423,Will,"We couldn't have been happier with our experience here.  Shauna's place is perfect!  Just a short walk to the amazing beaches and good food plus a spectacular view!  This was our first time using Air BnB and we will definitely be using it again!  Thank you to Shauna for being a gracious host and opening your home to us.  It made the weekend of our 14th anniversary the best one we've had yet!  Maybe we'll be back for #15!!

3505739,32441134,2015-05-17,21386442,Katie,"We had such a fun ""staycation"" at Shauna's house! We live in Seattle and her beautiful home was perfect for an easy night away. We walked down to the beach and park which were only a couple of blocks away. Shauna's home has an amazing view and a great deck to enjoy it from! 

Thank you Shauna for being a great host. Check-in/checkout was so simple and we felt very welcome with the sweet note from you. I can't say enough great things!"

Your description was spot on and the views of puget sound were spectacular. We grilled on the deck twice which made us feel ri Michael Jght at home. On our next trip to seattle we will definately be staying with you. You know what they say...West Seattle is better known as Best Seattle.

Thanks again
All the best
Peter and Alice"
3505739,33406866,2015-05-27,6624381,Damon,Shauna is a great host! Everything was as described. The house is i a great location. Plenty of restaurants and bars in walking distance. I highly recommend. 
3505739,33936879,2015-06-02,15525087,Sara,We really enjoyed staying at Shauna's sunny oasis in West Seattle. The neighborhood was perfect; quiet and a short walk to the beach. The bus stop and water taxi stop right out the door made visits into downtown Seattle easy. The view was incredible from the wall of windows and the deck. We slept well in the quiet bedroom. The perfect retreat!
3505739,34352131,2015-06-07,34142953,Adam,"My family and I loved staying in Shauna's beautiful West Seattle home. It is in a great location. It was a short walk to Alki beach. We had beautiful weather the whole weekend, so we enjoyed barbecuing on the patio and watching the sun set over the Pudget Sound. The view from the front room is stunning. The house was modern and clean. Shauna's communication was great, she even had recommendations for nearby places to dine or visit. I would recommend her place to anyone visiting Seattle."
3505739,34585370,2015-06-09,9316213,Jill,Shauna was an amazing host. Very friendly and helpful.  Her place was perfect.  I loved the views of the sound in Seattle.  Walking to coffee and restaurants as well as the beach was just what I needed.  
3505739,35661499,2015-06-21,24746491,Jill,This home is great for a relaxing visit to Seattle. We were within 10 - 15 drive from downtown. The DART shuttle to the water taxi was easy to use and fun for our kiddo. The view is great and the weather this weekend spectacular.  Shauna made check-in super easy. We liked being able to come and go as we pleased and not feel like we were staying with anyone.  The home was very private and super clean. 
3505739,36197683,2015-06-26,7156948,Barbara,"We loved our two days at Alki Beach. The apartment was peaceful and quiet and the view, especially at sunset, delightful.
We would love to return sometime - and can recommend this host and the accommodation. 
Thank you Shauna and Ben"
3505739,36590017,2015-06-29,10535832,Sarab,"Ben & Shauna are an excellent host, very welcoming and helpful! Her place is well kept, spacious and comfortable. A great place to stay with a nice , quiet neighborhood and few blocks from the beach."
3505739,37595136,2015-07-08,33002072,Sharon,Such a lovely house with great view and warm ambience! The minute I stepped into the house I felt the great care the owners have put into the place. This is different from some of my other Airbnb experiences where the apartments/houses are just set up and maintained for rental business. This one feels like someone open up their well cared home to you with open arms. What they have they share with you. Thank you so much Shauna and Ben!
3505739,38492338,2015-07-16,32457337,Gary,"
This was our first Airbnb experience and we are very pleased to have stayed at ""Alki Beach, Seattle -- Water View"". The West Seattle location was easy to find, is close to/from the airport, downtown and Mt Rainier. The apartment is within walking distance to Alki beach, and the deck is perfect for relaxing and enjoying the view. 

The home was spotless, and also stocked with items needed for cooking, preparing meals, doing laundry. 

The hosts left us clear instructions on how to get to the house, parking, recommended restaurants, transportation. There was a lovely bottle of wine waiting for us. While we never met in person, Shauna was highly responsive to our emails. 

We would highly recommend this property for those headed to the Seattle area."
3505739,38860937,2015-07-19,10373850,Terri,"Good! Great place for me and my daughters to have a girls weekend! Alki beach is fun and the place has a great view.  We used Uber to get back and forth to downtown.  We would have appreciated a table on the deck, but Shauna's place is well supplied otherwise and we'll plan to return."
3505739,39370180,2015-07-23,7969151,Jeroen,"Our first time with airbnb and it was a succes. Very nice place, close to the beach in a quiet area. We didn' t get the chance to meet Shauna but when we had a problem she was very responsive and helpfull. Thanks again for having us at your place."
3505739,40314131,2015-07-30,31053288,Ainhoa,"The place was fantastic! Lovely views, minutes-walk from the beach, close to downtown (15 min-drive). We didn't meet Shauna face to face, but talked on the phone at arrival.  We found everything in place according to photos and description. Shauna's tips for getting around were very helpful. 

Nos encanto el sitio. La casa, las vistas, el entorno...Estando muy cerca del centro de Seattle, tienes además toda la tranquilidad de un área residencial y de la playa. Sin embargo, no me lo podría imaginar una estancia sin coche. Shauna nos envió toda la información necesaria antes de la llegada por lo que todo resulto muy sencillo."
3505739,40926767,2015-08-03,1390376,Juri,"Shauna was very responsive and catering for our stay. The apartment is slightly dated however it is still very clean and cozy.  The view from the whole living and dining area is amazing and def worth the outdated decor! Location is great, walking distance from the beach!"
3505739,41380832,2015-08-07,19528446,Chelsie,"Shauna & Ben's place was clean, comfy & convenient. We only stayed here one night and particularly loved how convenient it was to the airport. It was very easy to get out of town in the morning and didn't encounter any traffic. The house itself had a beautiful patio & communication was super clear and easy. Thank you for opening your home and providing us a nice place to stay our last night on Seattle :)"
3505739,41929300,2015-08-10,1979154,Kathy,"We came to West Seattle to celebrate a birthday and were very happy to find Shauna's place. The home is very spacious, open and comfortable with plenty of amenities. The views are lovely, and we enjoyed sitting on the deck watching the ferries and other marine traffic pass by.  The beach and restaurants are within easy walking distance, and other shopping, movies and restaurants are within an easy drive. We enjoyed our stay very much."
3505739,42556257,2015-08-14,37165033,Jennifer,"Shauna was very responsive and proactive about sending information and providing useful details for our stay, which was the 4th leg of a 10 day vacation in the pacific northwest. I must say, however, that for the price we paid, the accomodations were not terribly clean (everything was very dusty) and didn't feel nearly as glamorous as the pictures made it seem. It felt unfinished, from a decor standpoint, with piles of stuff sitting around on the floor, and crappy old couches in the living room. While we certainly enjoyed the neighborhood and proximity to the beach the house itself was something of a let-down. There was also major work being done on the unit above ours so there was considerable noise during the day, so if you plan to use the space during daytime hours, this might be a concern. "
3505739,43491994,2015-08-20,34645049,Suzanne,This was our first airbnb experience and it was not exactly what we were expecting. The view from the living room/dining room was the best part. Construction was being done everyday of our stay in the upstairs of the house that we were not made aware of at time of booking or at any other time. The construction began around 7:00 am daily and ended around 6:30 pm. which made it very difficult to enjoy anytime there or take a quick rest after sightseeing. The last day of our stay shauna offered us a discount but we did not see one. We were hoping for a better airbnb experience. We did have a great visit with our daughter which helped offset this experience. The place is not worth the value when construction is going on. 
3505739,45796787,2015-09-06,14249794,Tianna,We loved our stay! Great location with a stunning view. The metro market place is right down the street so we were able to quickly grab groceries for our stay. Wish we had been able to explore the surrounding area and beach more. Thank you for a great stay. We will be back.
3505739,45932291,2015-09-07,33991144,Ali,We enjoyed our time in Alki Beach!  The location could not have been better & I thought the pictures accurately represented what the house actually looked like.   It felt very home-y and we appreciated the restaurant suggestions Shauna made!  
3505739,46693450,2015-09-13,28716447,K,Nice space and view. Easy parking...I would say getting around would be difficult w/o a car. Clean and comfortable.
3505739,47129894,2015-09-15,43591055,Thomas,"Shaun and Ben have a lovely home and everything appeared as it did on the website.  The home is very inviting, clean, and the amenities were exactly what we needed.  The view from the back deck is very nice and was the perfect place to relax as the sun went down.  They were very accommodating and provided valuable ""local"" info before our arrival."
3505739,47861227,2015-09-21,41876126,Rui,very fantastic house！
3505739,48700481,2015-09-28,36061453,Charles,"We really enjoyed our stay in Seattle at Shauna & Ben's home. Is was everything as listed on the rental listing and so much more. It was super clean,we had everything we needed at our fingertips. The bed was very comfortable ,very nice kitchen and dining area. The views from the balcony were breath taking. Blazing fast internet connections which we now need at home:) we were able to walk to the beach and several restaurants Shauna recommended. It was easy to get over to Pikes Plac and the Space Needle. We ran out of time to explore the area and would love to stay here again in the future. Thanks for sharing your beautiful home with us."
3505739,49827719,2015-10-06,15823904,Michael,Shauna and Ben's Alki suite was amazing!  The water view and the big open windows made for some peaceful relaxing for my wife and I.  The suite is in a nice area of West Seattle with access to shops and restaurants on California ave a short drive away.  The fridge was stocked with a selection of drinks and I particularly liked the collection of books.
3505739,51101453,2015-10-17,46630608,Gloria,"We arrived very late in the evening and left the next day, so we did not have time to try out any of the many suggestions our hosts provided for us for restaurants and entertainment. 
Their home was beautiful, even better than the pictures, with a glorious porch and view of the sound. Would definitely go back!"
3505739,51792287,2015-10-24,4189910,Steve,This place is just as advertised. The house was roomy and very clean and the view from the living room and deck is incredible. The neighborhood is perfect. It's 3 blocks from the beach where there are restaurants and bars all around and a mile up Admiral Way around California St. has restaurants and bars everywhere as well. Downtown and Pike Place Market is a 15 minute drive. Shauna and Ben left a very nice note and bottle of wine for us on the dining room table and were very accommodating. We couldn't have had a better experience. We will definitely be back!
3505739,53071478,2015-11-04,26864923,Cayley,"Shauna and Ben were very welcoming, we really appreciated the local tips they provided including some great restaurants, all of which we tried (Cactus Mexican and La Rustica Italian were definite favourites). The home had everything we needed including a fully stocked bar and a really nice bottle of wine which was much appreciated after a long, rainy, journey in! We had spent lots of time in Seattle before but never been to Alki Beach and really fell in love with the neighborhood. House was clean, comfy, excellent location and we could have sat in the lounge chair and stared out the window for hours! We will be back!"
3505739,54299189,2015-11-17,10428340,Shawn,Description was accurate. Nice place.  Beautiful view.  East to access. 
3505739,55488100,2015-12-01,62204,Lynn,"The place was great, beautiful with a great view. A nice bottle of wine was waiting on the table. Shauna and Ben were very nice and welcoming. They even e-mailed us to make sure everything was okay. Would definitely return and recommend staying here."
3505739,56440739,2015-12-13,38074781,Deborah,"Thanks, Shauna and Ben, for a great stay in your cozy apartment over a wet and cold Seattle weekend.  The location and the set up were perfect for us, and we appreciated the flannel sheets!  Thank you for being considerate hosts and we look forward to returning.

5728135,28458071,2015-03-23,17332720,Yunkin,"Hello world,

First off, I want to start with how Hannah really saved my behind! My travel arrangements got shifted two days early and I was scrambling to find a second place to stay. NCAA was shutting down the city in terms of lodging and pumping up all the hotel prices for the rooms that were actually still available. After being declined on some listings for short notice or not having reviews I was in Minnesota on a lay over flight with no plans for a place to stay what so ever when I got to Seattle! I found this listing and it was in one of my favorite districts which is Cap Hill!

I messages Hannah and told her my situation and right away got a message back with a pre-approval! I literally jumped out of my seat at the airport! We went back and fourth dialing in all the details for my arrival. She was extremely responsive and helpful, which helped relieve my worries even more. 

I want to describe the neighborhood first. Just WOW, Cap Hill is just so beautiful. The houses are all completely all different and the foliage everywhere is just all naturally/unnaturally set in so perfect. I didn't know that this was the time of the year for Cherry Blossoms as well. Many of the streets just had rows and rows of these that dropped white leaves that would cover the ground as if it were snow. 

The area has it's own ""strips"" close to it with shopping, bars and good restaurants. Everything was in walking distance and the 43 bus runs you all the way to the city. UBERS were under $5 to the Cap Hill area so it doesn't break the bank to get to any main strips. 

Walking up to Hannah's place was a scene in a movie with their large windows and they floor placement from the street was just so welcoming. The warm vibes and when I got in I felt as if I were at home. You know when you go to places and you're like I could so live here! That was Hannah's place! 

I met Peter who was also my host and they're just so inviting it's like we were already friends from before. They were extremely accommodating, but not to the point to over sell something. They treated me like a long time friend that was traveling to their area and they wanted to be as helpful as they could be for them. 

This has been by far my favorite airbnb experience. The photos represent the listing very well and I would go as far as saying any photos you will see won't do this place inside/outside, the vibe and the neighborhood justice. 

I've been there, everything about this is more than worth it if this is an option for you.

Thanks again Hannah & Peter, you two were more than fantastic. Loved our conversations and laughs.

Safe  travels everyone!

cheers,

yk"
5728135,29135760,2015-04-04,29386798,Kaytie,"My husband and I always have a blast in Seattle, but this time around has raised the bar. Staying with Hannah & Peter was like staying with longtime friends. The house was so inviting and bright and located in the middle of an incredible neighborhood in Capital Hill. The bed was sooo comfy and we had fresh towels ready for us. Hannah was such a great hostess and has such a great energy about her. Also she is a great help to find some eating/cocktail spots that are killer! I can't wait to visit again! "
5728135,29701440,2015-04-11,8380163,Hyonah,"Hannah and Peter were very welcoming. Their home was very cozy and clean. The room was very spacious and the comfortable. The location was awesome - not only is the 43 and 48 bus stop nearby but the arboretum is very close, which is so beautiful! "
5728135,30055339,2015-04-16,31045679,Janey,"Sunny in Seattle is at the top of Capitol Hill, which means it's pretty accessable to everything.  It's a great location, and unlike much of Seattle, there is street parking!!!  My hosts were charming and interesting...we had a long talk over morning coffee before I headed out.  Their home is very nice and their cat is fabulous.  She's a calico with watercolor markings on a lot of white.  Recommended."
5728135,30232977,2015-04-19,18400569,Ariane,"This was the first time I've used AirBnB, and it was a great experience. Hannah and Peter are super cool and were incredibly warm, friendly and welcoming. We arrived late on Friday night, and Peter stayed up and let us in, showed us around and chatted. Both Hannah and Peter were happy to chat with us throughout our stay and suggested places to check out, and day trips outside Seattle - the Arboretum and the tulips were both winners! Their apartment is lovely - so bright, comfortable and warm, exactly what you see on their page, and it's in a really nice neighbourhood, close enough to Capitol Hill and Downtown that exploring isn't difficult at all, with lovely views and a bus stop close by.  Definitely recommend these guys and their lovely space. "
5728135,31267044,2015-05-03,32052893,Mallory,"Hannah and Peter’s place was in the perfect location for us!  It was also very clean, welcoming and parking was super easy and free (a big plus in Seattle). The bed was quite comfortable and their cat is such a charmer!  We didn’t have the pleasure of meeting Hannah since she was out of town, but Peter was a great host. We had some fun chats with him and wouldn’t hesitate staying here again! 
"
5728135,31817697,2015-05-10,1988178,Margo,"Our interaction with Hannah and Peter was flawless. They are very accommodating hosts. The bed was super comfy and the apartment was amazingly quiet; We slept like babies. Kekoa, their cat, was also a gracious feline hostess. Thanks, Hannah and Peter! "
5728135,32392502,2015-05-17,27266182,Carly,"My sister and I had a wonderful time staying with Hannah while passing through Seattle. She and Peter were very accommodating and were so willing to offer up some great suggestions for our stay, as well as the rest of our road trip. Their place was so comfy and inviting and located in such a beautiful neighborhood. We would highly recommend staying with Hannah and Peter to anyone visiting Seattle."
5728135,32781708,2015-05-21,653785,Debra,"I had an employee coming to town for training and wanted to book a room in a great location for her. Hannah and Peter's place is in a fantastic neighborhood and one I knew our employee would enjoy. It's a great walking neighborhood in a beautiful part of Seattle; close to everything in town with many wonderful restaurant choices nearby.

When I explained my unique booking situation to Hannah, she was super accommodating and a pleasure to deal with. Below is what our employee, Katie, had to say about her stay there:

""My stay at Hannah's was lovely! Peter and Hannah's home was very clean and comfortable. They were more than accommodating and Peter even made cookies to share. I would definitely stay here again.""

Thank you, Hannah and Peter, we look forward to booking with you again!"
5728135,33688076,2015-05-31,23384191,Jacqueline,This was a wonderful home in a beautiful area! Hannah was so kind and friendly and their cat was very nice.  Would definitely recommend to stay or host them! 
5728135,34072567,2015-06-04,14818619,Maddie,"Hannah & Peter's home is so welcoming, bright, and comfortable, and the same could be said for its owners. Before I even arrived, Hannah was available by text to welcome me to Seattle and offer help with suggestions for the best way to get to her house. Once I made it there from the airport (a quick and easy Link Lightrail to Metro trip), I immediately felt like more of a friend than a stranger. The whole house gets such beautiful light, including the guest room which is lit by a large window opposite the bed. Hannah & Peter also have an adorable and super-friendly cat named Kekoa, who I loved hanging out with. The neighborhood is great, full of beautiful craftsman homes, but a short walk from great bars, restaurants, and coffee shops. You can also easily take a bit of a longer walk from there to central Capitol Hill, which was another really fun area. I am so happy I chose to stay here during my trip to Seattle, and I can't recommend it enough to anyone planning to visit!"
5728135,36395629,2015-06-28,31981746,Matt,"My girlfriend and I recently stayed with Hannah for a few nights in Seattle, and it turned out to be a great choice. Hannah and Peter were great hosts and helped ensure that we felt comfortable and relaxed while staying at their place. We really appreciated the fact that they also accommodated our late-late night arrival which was a big concern for us on choosing a place to stay at. Kekoa, the resident feline Goddess, also was a pleasure to meet and pay our head and chin scratching respects to.  "
5728135,36931340,2015-07-02,2409629,Dan,Hannah and Peter were great hosts who made me feel very welcome in their lovely home.  
5728135,38835668,2015-07-19,32378619,Shabnam,I definitely enjoyed my staying in Sunny Seattle with Hannah and Peter  and their friendly cat :)  They are very friendly and easygoing and cooperative. The room is very cozy with a nice window. I hope I can visit them again when I go to Seattle.
5728135,41075032,2015-08-04,26224895,Katie,"What a fantastic stay in Seattle! Hannah and Peter couldn't be kinder, more welcoming hosts. They were easy and fun to be around, full of bright ideas and excellent Seattle recommendations. 
The whole apartment is adorable, and the room is perfectly cozy with a super comfortable bed. Location is ideal in a great neighborhood. Couldn't recommend their place enough!"
5728135,42874452,2015-08-16,36215825,Tina,The neighborhood is quiet. It is only about 10 minutes drive away from Seattle University. The house has a relaxing atmosphere. It feels like home away from home.
5728135,43394799,2015-08-19,18938664,Jess,"Hannah's place was super cool and also home to the cutest cat in America! 
There was a small mix up with the entrance instructions which meant we were unable to get in when we first arrived, but luckily there are plenty of cool things to do nearby and hannah offered us a full refund for the night.

The appartment is really well furnished, super comfortable and hannah's cat is the sweetest friendliest and cuddliest ever, but will also mind her own business if cats aren't your thing. You can easily walk to cool areas like capitol hill and further downtown if you're up for it, but there is a bus stop right by the house which will get you anywhere if you're not.

Even with the mix up which, due to its nature is extremely unlikely to happen again, we would definitely recommend staying at hannah's!"
5728135,44184188,2015-08-24,40144238,Christopher,"Hanna and Peter are the best! We had a great time staying with them, and their very friendly cat :) Their apartment is in a fantastic location in Capital Hill, and it feel like any part of Seattle is accessible within a 12 minute car ride. I would highly encourage anyone to stay here!"
5728135,44648349,2015-08-28,19308299,Kara,"The location of the house is great - walking distance to a ton of places in Capitol Hill, as well as the arboretum in the opposite direction.  We were ambitious and walked all the way to the waterfront and market as well from here! The house is so cute and the bed is really comfortable - Hannah and Peter are both super sweet, and their cat is AMAZING.  We would definitely recommend their home to anyone looking for a place in Seattle!"
5728135,45104229,2015-08-31,32050770,Ty,"Easy place to stay, not too far from Downtown. We took the bus or used Uber and it was easy access. Hannah was out at a wedding and made us feel like we had a great, safe place. "
5728135,45959505,2015-09-07,18422383,Colleen,"Hannah and Peter were wonderful hosts – communicative, helpful and friendly. It felt like coming home to a friend's house. The apartment is super charming and is in a great location. As I set out to explore Seattle during my stay, nothing was ever too far away. I'd easily book this room again."
5728135,47903156,2015-09-21,15027313,Kelly,"Hannah, her apartment, and her furry kitty Kokoa gave us a wonderful place to stay in Seattle!  Hannah was very friendly and helpful with finding cool things to see and do around town.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would definitely like to stay again my next time in Seattle.  Thanks Hannah!"
5728135,49733402,2015-10-05,38521340,Peter,My wife and I like Hannah's nice and clean room and distance between Broadway is not far. Hannah and Peter are warmhearted and friendly. They love life and enjoy it. We like their kitty Kokoa and it always basks in the sunshine. We would like to recommend anyone to stay here.
5728135,53532956,2015-11-09,15774525,Hannah,"Just say YESSSS to Hannah, Peter, and their home. First off, Hannah is an effortless host. She is warm, chatty, and helpful, full of suggestions and genuinely into making you feel at home and is able to do so while respecting your privacy. I only met Peter briefly, but likewise a gem. Secondly, Hannah and Peter's home is legit just as beautiful as it looks in the photos. They keep a cozy, neat house but aren't sticklers, and you're welcome to the common space (which has amazing huge windows and this great outdoor area). In all, Hannah and Peter offer a super friendly, welcoming, comfortable place to lie your head for a few nights. I'd rebook in a heartbeat and recommend this place and these people to any of my friends visiting Seattle. "
5728135,54065491,2015-11-15,48005746,Anthony,"I can't say enough good things about this airbnb experience. The hosts were inviting, respectful, super easy to work with, and a lot of fun. The location itself was right in the middle of all the places I wanted to visit in Seattle -- and the street parking was always available. Peter and Hannah have a beautiful home, and it was nice to have a comfortable, cozy room. Peter first greeted me with some freshly baked cookies, which was a great way to begin my stay in Seattle. Everything in the airbnb listing was accurate, and I can see why the reviews were five stars. Their cat was really friendly, too. Lastly, Peter was really flexible with me in terms of check in/check out time, as well as always offering to be available. I highly recommend for anyone looking for a safe, inviting, comfortable, affordable, and fun place to stay in Seattle. Peter will be my first phone call if/when I visit again!"

8939687,53555010,2015-11-09,10378736,Eddie,"GREAT stay. Ethan was very welcoming and the room was exactly as pictured. Very comfortable stay, and Ethan works hard to keep the house immaculate. The breakfast was FANTASTIC, definitely the selling point for me. Great location too. I'd definitely stay here again."

8939687,54937126,2015-11-25,20059453,Zane,"I came for an interview at UW for a quick one night stay.
Pros:
- Excellent location and proximity to UW.
- Host was really responsive and flexible.
- Bed was very comfortable and clean.
- GREAT free breakfast spread.

Cons: 
- Paper thin walls/windows.  My neighbor was a snorer... and the room was above the furnace."
8939687,55131822,2015-11-28,47863313,Robin,"Great, no issues with check-in or stay in general. Would have liked to option to lock my door, though!"
8939687,55641352,2015-12-03,47029110,Cameron,"Great stay! Room was clean, spacious, and convenient. Hosts were very friendly. The house itself is in a very convenient location, only a short walk or car ride from the entire UW campus."
8939687,56150945,2015-12-09,45197909,June,"Very cozy apartment, but a bit small for two people. "
7241235,38228658,2015-07-13,36967128,Megan,"We had a great weekend staying at Molly's! The apartment was clean, uncluttered, bright and in a great location. We could walk downtown or the bus stop was right at the corner. We didn't actually meet Molly, but she was quick to respond to email before our arrival. She really helped us out when our original booking was cancelled two days before arrival.  Molly left us some treats and some fantastic recommendations in the neighborhood. Check-in was super easy since you can call Molly and she can buzz you into the building, super helpful if you get delayed with your arrival as we did. I would stay again if I return to Seattle :)"
7241235,38657881,2015-07-17,37934614,Jeremy,"The apartment is super clean, well organized and in a great location. The hospitality was top notch, and the building was lovely. Really happy I chose to book this apartment and not a hotel."
7241235,39221670,2015-07-21,832760,Cheryl,"Molly's place was really nice and modern, and very comfortable. The neighbourhood was very convenient, and I would definitely recommend staying there!"
7241235,40253843,2015-07-29,38026290,Nate,"Aptly named the apartment was cozy and despite the size did not ever feel cramped or claustrophobic. The space was clean and modern with new appliances as well as dishes, silverware, and anything else you might need if you decided to cook. Molly also left us with a french press which was great! and was able to accommodate a few special requests as well! She was very responsive and helpful for all of our requests and needs, and even helped us find a restaurant when we were hungry on our first night after flying in.  Beyond the interior the location was amazing. It was within a 30 minute walk of the space needle, and all the main sights downtown including pike market. Nearby there was a grocery store and plenty of restaurants and coffee shops for the days we were to tired to venture as far. The neighborhood was also clean and fairly easy to navigate, and both of us felt comfortable walking around even late at night. Overall, great experience, I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to get an organic experience of the city yet still wanting to feel like they are being pampered enough to be on vacation.  "
7241235,42211777,2015-08-11,13744386,Gavin,"Location on cap hill is excellent, could not be more central.
Building and unit very clean and secure.
Molly is very prompt in responses, check-in and out was simple and hassle free."
7241235,43256536,2015-08-18,26969322,Hailey,"We had a lovely stay at Molly's Cozy Studio. The location is fantastic, there is so much to do and see in Capitol Hill! Molly's place was clean, her directions clear and she had great suggestions for some spots to check out! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle!"
7241235,45139091,2015-08-31,16733278,Ryan,"Molly is truly a wonderful host.  Her home was perfect for our stay in Seattle.  Not only is the location ideal (i.e., near great restaurants, bars, city attractions, etc.), the apartment itself provides a peaceful respite from the hustle and bustle of the city.  What really impressed us the most was Molly's attentive service.  She was only a phone call or text away if we needed her, and if we didn't need her, she was not a bother.  We had a late flight out of Seattle, and she was more than willing accommodate a later checkout.  

In addition, Molly helped me out with a travel dilemma I had.  I was an idiot, and I left my backpack with with some valuables (including an SLR camera) on the curb in front of a nearby restaurant before getting into a taxi en route to the airport.  Not surprisingly, the camera had some priceless photos stored on it.  Luckily, the restaurant was able to retrieve the bag from the sidewalk.  Molly graciously offered to pickup my bag and facilitate its transport back to Chicago.  Now that is service!  Having worked in the hospitality industry for many years, I can attest that is something that usually only luxury establishments (e.g., Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton) would do.  Understandably, the restaurant where I left the bag was having difficulty accommodating this unusual request--staffing can be tricky for most establishments.  What kind of employee can just leave in the middle of a busy restaurant and ship a bag across the country? 

Anyway, I apologize for the long-winded review, but I am blown away by Molly's service.  The unit itself and the ideal location are good enough reasons to stay, and the service is a huge added bonus.  Leaving my bag behind is uncharacteristic of me, and you never know when you will need a host like Molly to help in a time of desperation.  Staying with Molly will be our first choice for all our future visits to Seattle.  "
7241235,49645317,2015-10-05,29830827,Yumi,My stay at Molly's was awesome. The place was very neat and clean and very comfortable. It was also in a very convenient area and her advice on food and coffee shops were on point! Thanks for the great time! 
7241235,50661785,2015-10-13,24153062,John,Our experience at Molly's studio was great. It had everything we needed for our weekend in Seattle and it was in a great location to walk around town. Molly even provided some great recommendations for places to go in the area. Would definitely stay here again!
7241235,51367658,2015-10-19,6487767,Kevin,Everything was great! Location was amazing. Would love to stay here again.
7241235,53629372,2015-11-10,1850136,Shawn,"Molly's place was just as advertised!  Clean and modern with all that you need for a stay, located in a great, new building in a part of town that has everything you need.  24-hour Quality Food Centre one block away, as is the Gold's Gym if you need  workout.  You can easily walk to downtown in about 20 minutes or take a quick Uber ride, either way you're close to the major attractions.

Molly was very easy to communicate with and responsive.  Instructions for entering the building were quick and easy.  If you're looking for a great place to stay in Seattle, this is it!"
7241235,54477321,2015-11-20,48178390,John,"Molly did a superb job.  It is a very nice place, kept as new, clean, safe and outstanding location.   Made active use of the gym too."

Supriya helped and gave us privacy.
The location is great! it's peace and quiet area. There are some restaurants , grocery stores and cafes close to the house.
We wish we could have stayed longer.
if the space is available, highly recommend booking it! (You can also meet her lovely dog which is full of curiosity and little cowardly:))"
8535897,49401608,2015-10-03,10296619,Catherine,"We had a wonderful stay at Supriya's home. The room was huge and very private. Supriya was very welcoming and looked after us so well. We fell in love with Scotch, the dog."
8535897,49536307,2015-10-04,14955244,Jane,Supriya was nice and organized. We ended up having the entire floor by ourselves. The location was good and it's walking distance to restaurants and bars. Her dog was so cute and friendly :) happy we were there. 
8535897,50784245,2015-10-14,13736510,Donna,"The owner was very kind and made us all feel welcome. The house is gorgeous and is only one block from numerous shops and restaurants. She knows the area well and has great recommendations on the best restaurants, coffee, bakeries, shops, and playgrounds in the area. The room was super clean, cozy and large enough to comfortably accommodate 2 adults and a busy toddler. "
8535897,51200636,2015-10-18,45765019,Kim,"We so thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The location is ideal with close access to all the sites, lots of great eateries and views within walking distance.  Supriya was very warm and welcoming.  All her dining recommendations were spot on.  Her puppy Scotch, we loved him!!  Parking is included and you have a private entrance. "
8535897,53296559,2015-11-07,34112140,Rob,Supriya was a very nice hostess. Her home is lovely and is in a great location for both walking in Queen Anne and for easy access to downtown.  Her dog Scotch is adorable!
8535897,54017943,2015-11-15,13326750,Samantha,"Supriya is a wonderful host.  She made us feel welcomed and comfortable in her home.  She had great suggestions and is a wonderful conversationalist.  There is a private entrance, so if you are out a little late you don't have to worry about disturbing her or her sweet puppy, Scotch.  Her home is located in a residential area of Queen Anne and is just a block away from wonderful restaurants, shops, and not far from Kerry Park and its lovely views.  We were only in Seattle for the night, but would definitely stay with her and Scotch again on a longer trip. "
8535897,54623022,2015-11-22,47672204,Santiago,"Our time on Seattle was great and Supriya has a lot to blame for that. The house is beautiful and our room and private space was perfect, better than what Airbnb says. She is a great host and very helpful.
The house is very well located in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood with a lot of services around. It's walking distance from Seattle Center and Kerry Park and it has some bus routes that take you to Downtown and Ballard.

Great place to stay!
"
8535897,55119452,2015-11-28,19270851,Maxim,"We had a great stay at Supriya's home. She was a very welcoming host, she kindly answered all our questions about nearby activities. We also had a great thanksgiving dinner with Supriya.
The room was clean and quite big. Location is great for downtown visitors, everything is in walking distance (you may only want to take a bus on the way home if you don't like climbing a steep hill)."
8535897,55577398,2015-12-02,42221833,Connie,"Supriya home was just perfect! Beautiful home in a wonderful neighborhood, close to many shops, coffee houses, restaurants and bus line. The room was just as the pictures depicted: clean, comfortable and lots of space. Easy access with a private entrance. Supriya was very friendly and helpful. She offered the perfect amount of privacy. And, her dog was adorable! I will definitely be coming back. "
8535897,57540585,2015-12-27,48718038,Karen,"Supriya was a gracious, kind and supportive host, assisting me in my initiation to the Airbnb process, providing instructions on how to best to use the facility, and offering information on places to dine, and touring options.  I loved my sleeping arrangement, and rested well in a spacious and private spot with my own exit and entrance.  

Supriya's home was in an ideal location for me.  I could easily walk to museums, areas to tour, cafes with yummy food, and to-and-from my relative's home.  I felt safe and very comfortable in her home and in the area.  I would definitely return to Supriya's home and the area."
8535897,57809675,2015-12-29,1429340,Rasheel,"The room was warm and comfortable, and Supriya was very welcoming and had suggestions on places to eat. Great location in a beautiful neighborhood."
9030929,54027219,2015-11-15,4011006,Chris,"Darren was a fantastic host during my stay.  Great value, everything in his listing was even better in person.  Gorgeous location in Ravenna just a short drive to cap hill and downtown.  Will definitely be back! "
9030929,54644068,2015-11-22,47948469,Khang,It was great experiences for me to stay at Darren's place. He is really friendly and will be able to help you out with anything. I would recommend to anyone that wants to stay in Seattle for a short period of time
9030929,55481794,2015-12-01,4650031,San,"Darren was a great host - prompt communication, very polite, and was always open to offer help or any of the house amenities! Speaking of which, I felt very comfortable and happy to stay in his house! Very spacious, clean and organized. Highly recommended! "
9030929,56792205,2015-12-18,49223489,Yuya,"Darren is a super nice host! Although he is usually busy at work and we didn't have much communication in person, he always sent me messages to keep updated and make sure everything goes right. The room was very nice. It was actually much spacious than it seems in the photos. All in all, it was a very satisfying stay in his house."
9030929,57263720,2015-12-23,10107408,Volo,Really nice place and very good landlord. It was pleasure to stay here. We definitely will be back:)
9030929,58066702,2015-12-31,51111663,David,Clean place and always super warm despite the cold nights in Seattle! We didn't get a chance to meet Darren but he made proper accommodations for our stay. Definitely recommend this next time you visit Seattle!
4410493,24685762,2015-01-01,25082387,Claudia,"This was our first experience using Airbnb and of course with our host Jordan Allen. We went away with nothing but praise for both.  The experience was smooth, hassle free and pleasant every step of the way.  Jordan went out of his way to accommodate us as our first choice had been previously booked.  We welcomed the new year from  his second location in downtown Seattle which had an amazing view of ""The Needle"" from the dinning room table!  Condo was clean and modern.  The experience was so much fun and the location so convenient, we decided to add an additional night to our stay.  Again,  Airbnb made it easy.  We weren't charged any additional fees other than the additional  night's stay.
Overall, an amazing experience!  We will recommend Airbnb to all our friends.  Thank you Airbnb, thank you Jordan!"
4410493,26948191,2015-02-22,26977496,Robert,"Love the location, great place to stay! Jordan is best at responding questions & having a comfy place. Highly recommended "
4410493,37623327,2015-07-08,23675903,Michael,"The neighborhood was great and the view was spectacular. Besides some misunderstandings, i would definitely recommend to anyone passing through Seattle."
4410493,40901210,2015-08-03,11462738,Mabelene,"The apartment was as described in the listing and as it appeared in the photos. It was comfortable for our group of 6 ladies. The location is great! Walking distance to Pike Place Market, Space Needle, Chihuly Garden & Glass and a Light Link Rail station, as well as lots of great restaurants! Check in and check out process was straightforward."
4410493,45248738,2015-09-01,34606942,Ryan,"This was my first AirBnB experience, and I can happily say that I've been spoiled. The location is perfect, and everything was clean. Jordan answered all of my questions promptly. If I have any complaints, it's that there was only one sofa! My party was four adults (one couple, two single folks) and a child, and we relied on the photos indicating two sofas/couches in the living room (photo number six), but there was only one. The couple got one bed, another adult took the other bed, I took the couch, and the child was relegated to some spare sheets on the floor. So don't count on this place accommodating six people unless it's three couples, or folks who don't mind sharing beds. I'm told both beds were very comfortable, though. There could have been more silverware. That's it, though. I would definitely stay here again!"
4410493,45936028,2015-09-07,33564288,Amber,"For the most part we enjoyed our experience. The neighborhood we stayed in was centrally located to great restaurants, Pike's market, the space needle and many other cool attractions. 

The arrival was a little strange. We were given specific instructions and when we arrived the the lock box, that supposedly held the keys, would not open and the door was left open. Once inside there was keys on the counter for us. None of the keys worked, except for one. The parking permit and fob were not there but StayAlfred informed us that they would reimburse us for parking cost. Other than that the stay was great. It was a nice space but a little more beat up than I expected but nothing major. 

Jordan was always quick to respond and we really appreciated that. Overall I would stay at this location again. I know that the key issue was something that was most likely a mistake or out of their control. They did a good job of remedying the situation and we are thankful for that. "
4410493,48442916,2015-09-26,39191033,Kevin,"Great location. Close to everything downtown. Wonderful apartment with every necessary amenity. The third party manager, Stay Alfred, wasn't the easiest to deal with, but I managed to work around that. I'd happily stay there again."
4410493,49778407,2015-10-06,36635479,Francois,"Great location, with everything within walking distance, including a fabulous French bakery.  All amenities were great, and we will stay there next time we are in town.  We almost felt at home!"
4410493,50518346,2015-10-12,36743678,Sally,"The listing description was (email hidden) stated before, there is one couch, not two.    The neighborhood was what I think a typical city atmosphere is:  clean, hip, restaurants and coffee at your disposal.  There were many homeless people in the neighborhood in the early mornings.  They were harmless."
4410493,57353207,2015-12-24,8479414,Steve,"Clean modern apartment building.  Better than the chain 'suite' hotels.  Parking was easy, restaurants walkable, movie theatre two blocks away, streets safe, but with the usual Seattle dose of many homeless on the street.  Access was simple even in the absence of face to face contact.  I am Airbnb veteran and this is the kind of place I hope for on my urban visits."
6315435,35476039,2015-06-19,21113230,Meghan,"The Seattle Oasis team was amazing.  The unit was as promised and truly a hotel comparable experience (including toiletries, pre-stocked coffee, towels, etc.)  -- better frankly as we had access to a great and well set up kitchen.  Our group had a last minute change in arrival and also managed to lock ourselves out of our room on our final night.  The Oasis team responded cheerfully and more importantly -- very quickly -- in both cases so we could access the room without interrupting our business trip.   Highly recommend!"
6315435,42703456,2015-08-15,28167653,Loc,"This property and Seattle Oasis was a treat to deal with.  From amazing communication prior to our arrival, to the whole process of checking in and out.  We did call the on call team once while in the unit and they were beyond helpful and courteous.  The space is as described, everything was in pristine order when we got there.  The views and walkabilty to everything downtown can't be matched.  All we did was walk.  Would book again in a heartbeat"

4739190,24247925,2014-12-23,7629552,Emma,"Beautiful, light, peaceful studio with everything we could possibly need to feel at home! We appreciated how private and quiet the studio is... it felt like a woodsy retreat, yet so close to everything. Very convenient bus stops close by. We highly recommend anyone to stay here!! "
4739190,25174742,2015-01-08,7718502,David,"The place looked exactly like in the pictures! We enjoyed the comfort and privacy of this secluded Pacific Northwest oasis. Although out of the way and very quiet, the location was actually quite convenient as well, with access to major roads, malls, and highways within a few minutes.

Ellwood and Sarah were very welcoming, detailed, and courteous, and provided for all of our concerns. There are many hidden surprises awaiting you, at this wonderful gem of a studio...

: ) "
4739190,26306181,2015-02-09,24798985,Victor,"It was a great experience to stay here! BUT read CAREFULLY below to get the real conclusion:

1. The neighborhood is safe and quiet.
2. The host is helpful, welcoming and flexible.
3. The host is from respected occupation. 
4. The transportation are convenient. Location is great. Check north gate on Google, you got everything in this area.
5. It's the BEST price you can find in Seattle for a BIG INDEPENDENT STUDIO with all the kitchen stuff, great warm heater, washer & dryer in unit, big yard, free parking and a small library of all kinds of books, etc. Lots of extra!

So the real conclusion is: It will be a great experience to stay there!"
4739190,27091020,2015-02-25,25392998,John,"Elwood's studio apt was fantastic. Plenty of space, clean and bright. Very quiet residential neighborhood. Comfortable bed and very nice bath towels. When I texted Ellwood he responded immediately. He provided pamphlets about Seattle and left some snacks for our enjoyment. Very positive experience. Would definitely stay here again."
4739190,28119289,2015-03-18,10135815,Mariana,"Ellwood's and Sara's studio is definitely a charming place to stay in. It is located close to several bus stops, there are restaurants, cafés and a safeway nearby, and the neighborhood is calm and pleasant. I also need to highlight the features inside the studio, however: the cooking utensils and kitchen appliances are pretty awesome, the bed is comfortable, and the bathroom is great. There is plenty of light and space, which is wonderful. It naturally feels like a scholar's place due to the numerous books. Those full bookshelves will add a unforgettable cultured flavor to your stay. The hosts are incredibly nice, kind people. They look like a happy family with lots of good vibes! It's a no-brainer, really. Stay there if you have the chance. :D"
4739190,29698848,2015-04-11,30240765,Nena,"After a few days of travel, this studio provided a great place to stay and more! The studio was clean, uniquely styled, and fully equipped for all our needs. The bed was perfectly sized and comfortable for two, and was so nice to wake up in with natural light coming the skylights above. We did some light cooking and laundry during our stay, which helped make us feel within a home rather than traveling. I will most definitely be using this location for future needs. "
4739190,30046222,2015-04-16,374924,Rushika,"Great stay in all aspects. Ellwood clearly communicated directions and how to pick up the key if I came late, but he was awake at 1130p and showed me in. Nice private separate space in back of the house- quiet, very comfortable bed, nice kitchen, couch, tables, lots of great books to keep you entertained, peaceful yard. Quiet safe neighborhood, parking just outside. Would recommend highly. "
4739190,31579059,2015-05-07,16416981,Marc,"Loved every minute of our stay there, wish I could've stay longer. Everything was cleaned, nice comfortable bed and we love ceiling. The studio is located near all the stores and Downtown. Arrived at the studio late, however, Mr. Ellwood was still up and gave us the keys to the studio. I will definitely stay there again next  time I'm in Seattle."
4739190,35589893,2015-06-20,33784342,Stephanie,"My husband and I had a very lovely stay at Ellwood and Sara's private guest studio.  It is very charming, especially if you love books, and open, light-filled spaces, which we do.  The space is exactly as described and the pictures are what you see upon arrival.  
It was nice having a kitchen, I cooked breakfast and made coffee in the French press every morning and had a place to store and reheat leftovers.  When we had down time it was an awesome space to relax or take a nap.  
If you are sensitive to light when you sleep or are not an early riser you might want to bring a sleep mask, there are large skylights that let in a generous amount of light.
We would definitely stay here again.  We loved the very comfortable bed, the overall feel of the space, the cleanliness, and the location.  
Thank you Sara and Ellwood!"
4739190,36582816,2015-06-29,34846302,Cristi,"We loved our stay here! The space was homey, charming, and relaxing. Ellwood is a great communicator. He makes sure you have everything you need for your stay.. The kitchen and bathroom were very nice and well-appointed and the bed comfy. I loved the beautiful sky lights and being surrounded by sounds of nature in the city. The light, the sounds, and the books all reminded us to relax. The location was also (email hidden)nvenient for exploring Seattle. Thank you!"
4739190,36997866,2015-07-03,36365183,Christine,"We had a very nice time in this studio with our family. The hosts had all the necessary things for us to use and we were even able to cook a nice meal. They were nice and accomodating, allowing us to borrow a baby travel crib. The place is very private and has a nice deck. Unfortunately the weather in Seattle was unusually hot and we had to keep the windows open and the fan on to cool down. But we fully enjoyed the place and their hospitality."
4739190,38189790,2015-07-13,36634510,Lea,"Ellwood and Sara's guest studio was perfect for our vacation weekend.  Quiet neighborhood an easy drive to downtown and private. Ellwood waited up for us when we arrived late, and the had chocolate and wine in the fridge for our anniversary! Clean and spacious, I would definitely recommend staying here!"
4739190,38640420,2015-07-17,22611381,Ellen,"Ellwood and Sara were very good hosts. They were able to accommodate my same-day request to book, responded to communications immediately and politely, maintained the studio spotlessly clean, and were generally attentive, flexible and helpful. The description of the unit is accurate - very spacious. However, I would emphasize that it's perfect for one or two people - three can work if the third person is small and doesn't mind sleeping on Ikea couch cushions on the floor (I'm 5'7 and my feet were hanging off the edge); the couch does not convert to a true bed. One perk of staying here: they have an impressive, thorough, well-organized book collection, mostly Western lit with many complete sets of old editions...fun to browse through! "
4739190,40152836,2015-07-28,38518719,Aaron,The hosts made us feel very welcome. For everything that was included I feel the place was under valued. We highly recommend this place to other users. 
4739190,40513541,2015-07-31,38131615,Joanna,"Ellwood and Sara made us feel very welcome in this roomy but cozy studio. The space is clean, and the skylight provides perfect lighting throughout the day. The washing machine was also a nice addition. The bathroom was great; spacious and spotless, with a wonderful shower and fresh towels provided.

Part of the charm of this place is the vast book collection. Anything you can think of, it's probably there. I wish I had stayed longer just so I could read more! 

Highly recommended for anyone visiting Seattle. "
4739190,43944887,2015-08-23,22017859,John,"It was a pleasure staying at Ellwoods'  apartment, which was very comfortable with a large one room space having 3 skylights provide great lighting( with a large separate bathroom), well designed to include a full kitchen space, nice sized living space with a very comfortable bed. Everything was clean and neat, loved being able to go out in the back patio and have refreshments at the end of the day and relax. Neighborhood was quiet with easy access to a QFS supermarket which had great prepared foods if you didn't want to cook. 
I did not see or need to bother Elwood due to my busy schedule and there were no issues to be concerned about regarding the apartment, but he was very gracious when we first met and when I said my thank-you's and goodbye!!
If I repeat my activities that brought me to Seattle this year next year, I would love to utilize the apartment again- hopefully you will be successful in becoming tenured at the college!!  Good luck!!

"
4739190,44779663,2015-08-29,37433987,Sally,"We felt welcomed by our host, who gave us helpful suggestions about restaurants and other services in the neighborhood. The apartment was large, quiet, sunny, and in a pleasant neighborhood for walking. The bed was comfortable, and there were many books to look at or read. The studio was equipped with the basic necessities for being able to cook breakfast and warm up leftovers, and also had laundry facilities. 

One of us is sensitive to fragrances, and we found it delightful that there were minimal fragrances in the studio (no air fresheners; and the sheets had been washed in an unscented detergent).

We were a little concerned with how long it would take us to get downtown or to other tourist areas, but with the help of Google maps, we were able to navigate the city reasonably easily and quickly.  We would stay there again if we were visiting Seattle."
4739190,45379208,2015-09-02,37077686,Stan,Elwood made us feel most welcome. The studio was as described and is situated in a very pleasant and quiet neighbourhood. It was very straightforward to drive downtown (about 20 minutes). Due to storms we had a power cut on the first night and within minutes Ellwood arrived at the door with candles and a torch. I would recommend staying here if you want to stay away from the hustle and bustle. 
3463245,16428646,2014-07-27,7619111,Kelley,Great location and a great host. It's delightful spot in Seattle.
3463245,16510432,2014-07-28,18171911,Sean,"Stephanie was a great host! The unit was in very nice condition and provided a good sense of privacy by way of its own entrance.

The location is good. Less than twenty minutes from downtown/Pike's Market area, and within easy walking distance of some tasty restaurants.

I would definitely consider staying here again on my next visit to Seattle."
3463245,17055796,2014-08-06,1516137,Deborah,"My stay was wonderful !!  The room, with its own bathroom, kitchen, and outside door was a perfect size and extremely comfortable!!  This was a great location and so easy to get to the freeway, the pier area, downtown, and really-- everywhere. Stephanie couldn't have been a better hostess.   She was helpful, courteous, and never intrusive. I would definitely stay here again!!"
3463245,17243094,2014-08-09,17894420,Jennifer,"We stayed 2 nights at with Stephanie and the listing doesn't do the place justice! Her house is beautiful, as is the garden in the back. The room is awesome and was fully stocked with anything we could have needed including dishes and pots and pans! We could come and go as we pleased without any worries. The neighborhood is very cute and there are several restaurants within walking distance. It's very close to downtown and easy to access considering Seattle's reputation for having bad traffic. The bed was great and it was awesome having our own little kitchenette. I would definitely recommend Stephanie's place to anyone looking for a place in Seattle! "
3463245,17645072,2014-08-15,3667165,Roseann,"Stephanie's Private Studio Apt in Madrona was delightful!  Great neighborhood and apartment was perfect for what I needed.  There is plenty of street parking and Stephanie is a great host.  I was in Seattle for business and had a very busy schedule - she respected my privacy - but 
was also friendly when I did have a few minutes to chat.  Would love to go back when I have more time to explore the neighborhood and enjoy her beautiful garden!"
3463245,17875797,2014-08-18,5708078,Jennifer,"Stephanie was a gracious host.  She was unable to meet me upon arrival so she left me a drink and a snack on her back porch, overlooking her beautiful garden.  The apartment is bigger than it looks in the photos.  Very clean and bright.  Stephanie had information for traveling and sightseeing waiting on the desk.  I love the Madrona neighborhood.  Just beautiful.  My first experience with airbnb was great and I would not hesitate to book this apartment again.  "
3463245,18488115,2014-08-27,19228176,Milisia,"My husband and I stayed here for the first leg of our anniversary vacation. Stephanie was a wonderful host. Very accommodating and kind. She has maps, bus routes and flyers for downtown attractions and gave us some personal tips for local restaurants and places in the area to check out when we arrived. She also let us know we could contact her anytime if we needed her or anything for the apartment. 

The apartment is fairly small (as pictured) but very roomy feeling thanks to the open layout and full size kitchen and bathroom. It was perfectly sized for our trip since we spent most of the time out and about. We even made a few meals in the kitchen and we sat either outside on the garden patio or at the breakfast bar. The natural light from the high placed windows was very refreshing. 

The area itself is lush and peaceful. A quaint grocery store, local cuisine restaurants and the beach all within walking distance through the neighborhood. Easy access from the airport and just a bus ride away from downtown and Capitol Hill. 

I would definitely stay at Stephanie's again. "
3463245,18813554,2014-09-01,15890845,John,"We loved the neighborhood. Our host was very gracious and provided helpful info (buses to take, restaurant recommendations...) Riding the buses was easy and we made it to all the places in the CityPass and lots more. The backyard patio garden is perfect for relaxing and enjoying some Seattle wine/beer and food. "
3463245,19383363,2014-09-11,20414636,Kirk,Stephanie was very quick to respond to electronic communications and made us feel at home the moment we arrived. She was also very helpful with directions and navigating the bus system. The room was a basement apartment with a separate entrance and we had all the privacy we wanted. There was some construction on the house taking place while there but it did not interfere with our experience. We rented a car while there and always found a street parking spot within 100 ft of the apartment. 
3463245,19564296,2014-09-14,18119454,Anna,Stephanie was a gracious host. She was very welcoming and friendly. She also helped us find great local dining options and helped us navigate the bus system. Her basement studio was just as described: spacious and clean. I highly recommend her place and I would definitely stay there again.
3463245,20046765,2014-09-22,8349426,Denise,"Stephanie was very welcoming and understanding of my changing schedule. The apartment is clean with nice natural light.  It is in a very quiet, residential neighborhood away from Downtown but a nice walk to Lake Washington.  Thanks Stephanie!"
3463245,37483142,2015-07-07,4541890,Brian,"Staying with Stephanie was great! The private studio apartment is connected to the house, with its own entrance, bathroom, and kitchen, and lots of space. Stephanie was an excellent host, made us feel right at home and helped us find our way around Seattle!"
3463245,38558324,2015-07-16,33448121,Raghav,"The accommodation was extremely clean and comfortable, as advertised. Stephanie made sure all the necessities were present (from towels to glasses, plates and bowls). The bed had a comfortable spring mattress and the area seems peaceful. The proximity to downtown areas and public transport was also good."
3463245,39045706,2015-07-20,2537651,Anna,"Stephanie was  a wonderful host, left us to ourselves when we wanted it but was very friendly and kind to us. The apartment was perfect for a couple -  perfectly clean, tidy and welcoming. Stephanie was very understanding of us getting in late and made our stay very easy."
3463245,40295515,2015-07-29,18115556,Eric,"Clean, private, and in a great locale. Stephanie is wonderful, too. Recommended!"
3463245,40642125,2015-08-01,38265060,Jodine,"Quiet neighborhood, nearby coffee and boutique restaurants. Easy drive/bus ride to downtown, Pikes Market and Pioneer Square.  Close to Swedish Hospital(s) and Harborview Medical.  Stephanie was very accommodating.  Unit was as described; comfortable and private."
3463245,41606370,2015-08-08,5406059,Nick,"Stephanie has been a very gracious and amicable host. She is very easy to converse with and makes you immediately feel comfortable in her home. I arrived late on a Saturday evening, and it was not a problem. The listing is accurate to the description, the place is kept very clean and has everything you will need. Her back patio is very cute and nice to sit out on. The neighborhood is fairly residential, but is located only a block from a strip of restaurants, cafes and coffee shops. In addition, bus routes are readily accessible to both the downtown and Capitol Hill areas."
3463245,41949937,2015-08-10,15343620,Natalie,"I had a wonderful stay at Stephanie's apartment! Everything was clean, comfortable, nicely equipped and well-maintained. The apartment also has a lot of natural light, despite being a basement unit, so it feels warm and inviting. It's in a quiet and pretty residential neighborhood, a short walk to a few cute bakeries/cafes and a longer walk or easy bus ride to Capitol Hill and downtown. Stephanie was a great host, very friendly and welcoming, provided great directions for arriving from the airport and made everything work well."
3463245,45249818,2015-09-01,5406059,Nick,"Stephanie was a very gracious and amicable host from the start. We had great conversations and was very welcoming. The space is as described, comfortable and clean. There is plenty of kitchen space with cooking supplies. The bathroom is a nice size also. There is a TV, but no cable, so plan accordingly with laptop/tablet/chromecast, etc. Her backyard is very quaint a great place to do some work/eat meals. The neighborhood is residential mostly, but there's a great strip of restaurants, cafes, breakfast shops, coffee and dessert two blocks away. Dowtown and Capitol Hill areas are easily accesible with short bus rides. Also a short walk down to Lake Washington."
3463245,54497437,2015-11-21,34880635,Paul,"Stephanie is a wonderful person. She made me feel welcomed from the moment I got there. The space was perfect for me. It was comfortable, warm and private. Since I'm a student who's often on the go, the fact that there was no microwave slowed me down a bit. But I ate much better using the stove/oven and the rest of the appliances. The neighborhood is one of the nicest in the city and has two very convenient bus lines that are extreamly close by and take you everywhere downtown. My friends who lived there were very envious that I got to enjoy such a beautiful location every day. I would definitely stay there again."
8067001,52488521,2015-10-30,23640143,David,"Everything was wonderful.  Amazing building, great location, clean, etc. We stayed for almost 2 months and were very happy with the apartment.  The only thing is it's not really a 1 bedroom, more of a very large studio.  You couldn't be intimate in the ""bedroom"" if anyone was staying on the couch as there is no door."
6647442,35729974,2015-06-21,29340033,Subhendu,"In one sentence, Julian and his wife Jasmine are the most warm and kind hosts I know. I never felt more welcome at any other place than theirs outside my home.

I have had a rough time in Seattle losing my wallet with my IDs , credit cards etc. I borrowed money from them. Julian drove me around to the Police Station etc. 

The room is clean, nice and comfortable. The house is maintained very beautifully. Julian has thought about all the basic requirements you might have, from pen, pad, table lamp, extension, wipes, tissues to bottled water. It was enjoyable to stay at his home.

The place is 1 minute walk from Columbia City Station, 20 minutes from SeaTac by Link and 20 minutes from Westlake. Fantastic location.

This should be your first choice if you are visiting Seattle. I had an amazing time."
6647442,35850522,2015-06-22,22067391,Vivian,"We had a very pleasant stay with Julian and his wife. They are lovely people, very accommodating and flexible with our arrival time. The room is comfortable and clean. There was bottled water for us in the room, which we appreciated very much. The location is perfect, since it is right down the street from the LINK station, which takes you downtown in 15 minutes or so. The bathroom is shared with other guests, but that was no problem at all. "
6647442,36810421,2015-07-01,16316691,Ck,"The room is very clean and is as pictured. Julian is a great host and gave us great tips on what to see in the Seattle area! One note though: if you are sensitive to heat and are staying in the summer, Room B gets quite hot in the afternoon."
6647442,37508337,2015-07-07,31483929,Kee Wai,很方便。机场来搭地铁才20分钟4个站。走不到5分钟就到了。下Westlake Center 也是搭地铁25分钟。房间很干净还可以洗衣服。
6647442,38155046,2015-07-13,35589206,Vivian,"The host, Julian, is a very friendly and accommodating host. He was very thorough about the simple rules of the house which made the entire process very easy and peaceful! He even offered us advice on our stay in the area, where to go, etc. Julian and his wife keep a pristine home in a fantastically convenient location (the Link station is literally around the corner). The description is accurate and the room looks exactly as pictured. The neighborhood is mostly residential so it's quiet and it felt safe. Certainly there were no issues with our stay. "
6647442,38627232,2015-07-17,34845495,Lena,"It was a great experience to stay in Julian's house. From the first moment we contacted him via Airbnb we felt welcomed. We arrived in Seattle quite late, at around 10:30 PM, and Julian met us at the LINK train station, we really appreciated it. The room was exactly how it was described, nice and clean. The bed was nice too, and it was a pleasure to sleep on the bed with clean, fresh linen and a cozy light blanket. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. The location is great, just a minute of walking from the LINK train station, and it takes 15-20 minutes to get to downtown. Julian and his wife were wonderful hosts. They were nice, friendly, kind, helpful. We even took Julian's advice to go to the Alki beach (takes about 50 minutes from Julian's location if you go by bus). Over all, we really enjoyed staying in this house and would definitely consider staying there again. "
6647442,39202903,2015-07-21,36754196,Chen,The hosts are friendly and the room is cozy. 
6647442,39331001,2015-07-22,36837216,Lu,We had an amazing time at Julian's home. He and his wife were hospitable. The house was very clean and warm. We'd love to stay again on our next trip to Seattle.
6647442,39466089,2015-07-23,35608134,Eun Ah,"Clean room, bathroom!
so kind host :D
totally good!"
6647442,39788075,2015-07-26,22763507,Christine,"This was my first time airbnb'ing a private room as oppose to an entire place and Julian and his wife are amazing! They're place is no joke, easiest commute to the city! Their location is amazing if you don't want to stay at a hotel that's going to charge and arm and a leg. The link is literally down the street and comes every 7 mins or so. An all day pass from Columbia City to Westlake (pike place) is only about 15 mins and costs around $6 for an all day pass (20mins to the airport). Their location is ideal since, for example, one day we had bought some things and didn't want to carry it around all day. Because of their location and ease of  light rail access, we were able to still drop it off at the house and go back out without having it hinder our plans. 

The room is exactly what I expected, clean and comfy. The clean towels, bathroom, bed sheet, and water bottles in the room, all of it made you feel welcomed and not just another guest. 

There were other people staying in the other rooms and one would think that the bathrooms were going to be an issue after a long day of sight seeing, but their house has two bathrooms for guests in the rooms they rent out. There was never a wait.

Overall, the only thing I would suggest is giving the guests some kind of caddy to carry their bathroom things (toothbrush, toothpaste, hair brush, contact solution, etc) from the bathroom to the room. But that is something so small that it shouldn't make you stray away from staying here. 

All in all, their hospitality made me feel as if I was more of a relative than just a guest. I would HIGHLY recommend anyone to stay at Julian and his wife's place! 

Thank you! "
6647442,40344246,2015-07-30,36487480,Matt,"Julian was one of the best host I have had. He was very caring and outgoing and made my stay feel like home. Almost everyday, we would have a fun and interesting conversation. Also, everything described was as promised. We will visit again because we love Seattle!"

刘生和刘太人非常好!他们知道我带着孩子，特意去车站接我，还破例同意我使用厨房，走的时候看我们行李多，又特意把我们送到车站，真是太感谢他们了!
每天我们都会愉快的交谈，他们会告诉我哪里值得去观光，哪里该如何抵达。。。诸如此类，提供了非常多的有益帮助，尤其是刘太，身体不是太好的状况下，特意开车带我们去社区菜场和公园，令人十分感动!
谢谢你们!
欢迎回国观光!(_)"

They allowed us to storage our luggages since our flight was at evening so that we can still have a whole day walking around at Seattle. They also recommended us some places worth to go. We had a wonderful day staying at their house. Thanks!!!!!!!"
6647442,42719068,2015-08-15,38430469,晶,房间很舒服干净，东西设备都超级齐全。刘妈妈人非常nice。这里交通好方便，出门一分钟就到车站了，每天都坐link出去玩。让我在西雅图度过了愉快的几天。会推荐给朋友的^_^
6647442,43050104,2015-08-17,32414839,Fabio & Patrizia,"The location is Strategic, because it's easy by light rail to go to the center of Seattle. Near the House there are a lot of place to lunch and dinner... there are many rooms and two bathrooms shared with other guests."
6647442,43311378,2015-08-18,20511813,Thomas,Clean bedroom and bathroom. I could airplanes at the nearby SeaTac airport but they were not too loud. A good location if you fly in and do not have a car.
6647442,43887038,2015-08-22,41975519,Sam,"Julian and his wife were very nice and accommodating! The room was wonderful and I slept very well the night I stayed there. Julian's house is very conveniently located since it is right next to the Columbia City light rail stop. Thank you, Julian!"
6647442,44301715,2015-08-25,31606924,Karolina,"Our stay at Julian's house was absolutely great. Place is very nice, clean and so well organized. Room was beautiful, spacious and comfortable. Julian is extreamly helpful - meet us on Link station and walk us home explaining everything on the way. Place is located in Columbia City and it is I think 500/600 meters far from Link station. You can almost see the station from the house. To go to the Seattle downtown you need 15-18 minutes, to airport 20. Great place to stay."
6647442,44700464,2015-08-28,15102330,James,"This location was very convenient to the Sounder transit link which was important to us since we did not have a car . The host ,Julian and Jasmine, were very nice and very helpful. The place is clean and the amenities are great. 
Highly recommend this location and will definitely return when we go back.
Thank you Julian and Jasmine for your hospitality and holding our bags for a few hours beyond our check out time, greatly appreciate your hospitality. "
6647442,44808250,2015-08-29,10554165,Justin,"The room house was clean and comfortable (with an abundant bottled water provided), and Julian was super friendly and helpful -- he told us about good places to eat nearby, and helped us find the best way to get to an early morning (website hidden) location is also great -- in a beautiful neighborhood, and right next to a LINK station. Would definitely stay again!"
6647442,45017460,2015-08-30,42327467,Sarah,"Julian and his wife were very welcoming. The room looks just like the photo, they even leave out waters for you, just like a hotel. The house feels very safe, and the rooms and bathrooms are very clean. The neighborhood is a little ways from downtown Seattle, but we got an Uber taxi ride for only $14, so not bad at all! Overall I thought this Airbnb was well worth the price. I would stay here again for sure!"
6647442,46147931,2015-09-08,23620540,Julie,"Great room, very clean. Centrally located with the train station right around the corner and about a 20 minute train ride into downtown, which was great. Julian gave us good information on how to get around and provided everything we needed, including bottled water! We had a good experience and would definitely come here again, thanks! "
6647442,46355827,2015-09-09,38783768,Dani,"Julian's place is a catch! The location is key. I got there at 4pm to drop my stuff off before I explored the city. Julian and his wife greeted me, showed me around the house and showed me the Light Rail is right outside the house to take to the airport the next day. The room was clean (had my own key), comfortable and quiet. All rooms were booked when I stayed, but I had no problem at all with noise. There are two restrooms available so no need to fight over them. I had a nice sleep and hopped on the Light Rail right outside the house. Great stay, thank you Julian!"
6647442,46388227,2015-09-10,239648,Cam-Mi,I felt welcome. Julian always try to be helpful.
6647442,46925056,2015-09-14,37685995,Aaren,"Julian did an excellent job of making us feel welcome and explaining his preferences in terms of house rules and how he'd like the door locked when entering and exiting the house. He was very kind and gave us some tips on where to go for dinner. The room was very clean. The bathroom was okay; I would have preferred it if the bathroom were wiped down or cleaned daily. One other small issue is that the area around Julian's home is somewhat noisy. The neighbors were loud and played loud music at around 8-10pm, but not any later than that. 

From what I could tell, there was not an iron or ironing available in our room, and I think it would be helpful to have one available. 

The house is very conveniently located, it's a quick walk to the Link Light Rail, and just a few minutes from a PCC grocery store and from downtown Columbia City. "
6647442,47257584,2015-09-17,38928985,Lindsey,Julian and his wife were very accommodating. Hey kept good contact with me prior to my stay and gave excellent advice on how to get to his house. The house is in a great location right off the LINK rail. My husband and I walked to it everyday we were there and it took less than 5 minutes. Our room was clean and looked exactly as shown in the pictures. The neighbors were a little noisy at times and we'd have to close the window to the room to block out their noise and smell of smoke but once the window was closed we'd here nothing. The bathrooms were clean. They gave us great privacy while we were there. It was very comforting. We would definitely stay again! 
6647442,47484901,2015-09-19,40294858,Kathy," It was my first time using an Airbnb and Julian made me feel at home.   The bedroom and bathroom were very clean and I had more than enough room.  

"
6647442,48100354,2015-09-23,9626687,Rashmika,"The place was very close to the train station which made the main areas accessible. I actually did not get Room B but a smaller Room E with a single bed. The room was comfortable and had everything I needed. Although the other rooms were occupied I always had access to the bathroom when I needed it.

Julian was very helpful and friendly."

The rooms were clean, private, and we had a lock and key for our door. The rooms had wooden floors, large closet with mirrors, a desk, bureau, and there were complementary water bottles available on the floor. The beds we comfy, the pillows were fluffy, and the blankets were warm--it was the best sleep we had in weeks!

We ended up needing to stay one more night and they accommodated us the best they could, without hesitation, and we were ever so grateful!

Their home is super close to the Link Light Rail (1 block!) and the 7 bus, plus, the neighborhood has great eats on Rainier, only a few blocks away (Ezell's Famous Chicken, Columbia City Bakery, and PCC).

Staying with Julian and Jasmine was a pleasure!"
6647442,49646763,2015-10-05,43193025,Vanessa,"Julian and her husband were very hospitable. The room was lovely, and we felt like we had our privacy. There are also two restrooms available in the hall, which is very convenient.  We needed some clothes cleaned and she was sweet enough to put them in her washer and dryer. The location is perfect as well. The metro is walking distance and she also left brochures with more info on the metro in a drawer. We were very happy with this airbnb. "
6647442,49989765,2015-10-08,27924144,Yin,"Nice and clean room, great location and convenient to downtown. Recommend to those who are single, especially single women."
6647442,50192214,2015-10-10,31500935,Rebecca,"I highly recommend Julia's apartment. Super super clean, excellent location to take Link to city center. Julia and her husband are very accommodating, responsive and helpful. They gave us many good suggestion to have one day tour in Seattle."
6647442,51549713,2015-10-21,37820779,Ruth,Wonderful neighborhood and very close to the rail station. Close to   CenturyLink Field (Beast Mode approved). Julian and his wife were great hosts! :) 
6647442,52722528,2015-11-01,328575,Wanda,Julian was very friendly. The room was clean and good size just as described. She gave us recommendations of where to eat and location was great!
6647442,53473383,2015-11-09,8131078,Clarisa,"This room was perfect, thank you for having us!  Julian was very hospitable, we really appreciated how comfortable and private the room was.  The house has a great location and we enjoyed walking around or just taking the Link for quick ride into downtown. When we are in Seattle, we hope very much to stay here again.  Thank you!"
6647442,54645383,2015-11-22,48564908,Li-Wen,Julian夫妻倆超級和藹可親，房間好乾淨住起來很溫暖舒服，很適合來西雅圖遊玩的旅客，因為離link-Columbia City Station好近，只要步行3分鐘。在西雅圖的這些日子，有他們的關心與協助，真的感到非常開心與貼心～
6647442,54709905,2015-11-23,18622548,Joe,"As usual - clean and nice, extremely convenient - 200m/600ft from the LINK station. Highly recommended!"
6647442,56095853,2015-12-08,45231520,Khaled,The house is very clean and organised and in a very good location. Very close to the train station. The room is very clean and the bed is very comfortable. I recommend this room.
6647442,58465374,2016-01-02,10397202,Jessica,Very comfortable and easy to find from light rail. Julian was great at answering any questions. Thanks for a great stay! 
82763,2197792,2012-09-04,990400,Heidi,"Lovely place! Safeway and Capitol Hill shops within walking distance, downtown/convention center is a ~10 minute bus ride (or 6.75 cab ride) away. The place is clean, well kempt, and has plenty of amenities. Only real potential issue of note is that the room we stayed in was on the third floor, which involves a lot of stair-climbing and may be tough for guests with heavy luggage or mobility issues."
82763,2872619,2012-11-12,1510385,Danielle,"I booked this place at the last minute on a weekend when every downtown Seattle hotel was at maximum capacity. So I greatly appreciated that Vaibhav was able to accommodate my last-minute request. 

That said, I was very dissatisfied with the condition of the place when I arrived. The bedroom and bathroom were extremely dirty - not just cluttered or messy, but dirty. Dirty sheets, dirty shower, dirty counter, dirty floor. Giving him the benefit of the doubt, Vaibhav was out of town that weekend and, because of my last-minute request, I imagine he did not have an opportunity to clean up before he left. But seriously, a heads-up would have been nice. Especially at the price for which he's renting the room. I mean, dirty sheets? I slept on top of the comforter (well, tried to sleep) - it was that bad. 
"
82763,2975296,2012-11-26,4172526,Rona,"Great location. Liked the house, awesome views, sheets could have been softer but that is a minor point! :)  

"
82763,6879125,2013-08-28,6504343,Andrew,"Vaibhav was extremely accommodating and friendly and the condo indeed was in a great location.

The stay was enjoyable except for two fairly minor things:
1.  The bathrooms were out of hand soap.
2.  The sheets were not that comfy (a little pilly and not very soft) and the pillows were really thin.  I think an update to the bed might be in order.

For me, it really wasn't that big of a deal.  I would love to stay there again when I go to Seattle!"
82763,28449720,2015-03-23,8270495,Scott,"I reserved a room fairly last minute to extend a business trip for the weekend and found this location to be perfect - nestled in a calm residential neighborhood yet only maybe a 10 minute walk from restaurants and nightlife. I found the lodging to be very clean and comfortable and there is even a fun view of the Space Needle from the back balconies. I unfortunately did not get a chance to meet the host but I found him to be extremely accommodating. He provided clear communication on how to get there and what to do upon arrival to gain entry. Also, I had an issue with the heat one night and he was quickly responsive to my email and offered to change the thermostat (which I couldn't figure out how to do) and even provided a space heater. He also has many tourist publications for the city and surrounding areas for one to peruse as well."
82763,35169262,2015-06-15,35326649,Joe,"Vaibhav made me feel very welcome (although I did not see him, he was a very responsive host via text). The room was clean and the photos were a fairly accurate representation of the real thing. Having the bathroom in the room was great since other guests were staying downstairs. The apartment is right in Capitol Hill and is just a few blocks away from much of the action. 
"
82763,37815139,2015-07-10,1708419,Ammad,"Vaibhav wasn't there when I stayed at his place. He was prompt, courteous and understanding in all our exchanges. We were both travelling and everything worked out well. "
82763,41568526,2015-08-07,40734650,Kayla, This was our first Airbnb experience.  Post was quick to reply and accommodation was as advertised .  He was very polite and answered all questions quickly and allowed us to store our bags at his place after our check out which was very much appreciated .   He provided us with info about the neighborhood and recommendations . Would definitely  this property and this house to other Airbnb users 
82763,44264761,2015-08-24,14588779,Quy,"Smooth operation.  Just needed a room for the night, and Vaibhav's place was just the ticket.   Great location in Capitol Hill.

Was able to check-in and check-out at on a self-serve basis, at my own convenience, which I like."
82763,45338368,2015-09-01,42478867,Oscar,Vaibhav is a great host. The communication with him was very easy and clear. He answered all my questions very quickly. The check-in and check-out was just perfect. Everything was very clean. The location on Capitol Hill is great and the view from the master bedroom is amazing.
82763,46979850,2015-09-14,36091350,Xiaohan,It's a nice and lovely house located in a quiet neighborhood. It might be a little bit far from all the attractions but still convenient to shop in groceries nearby. We had a lovely trip in Seattle thanks to this house. Helps relax a lot!
82763,48038898,2015-09-22,18365836,Houede,"Everything went super smooth with Vaibhav for the whole journey, he answered very quickly to my reservation a day or two before my arrival in Seattle. Vaibhav wasn't there when i stayed at his place but it was all set and remain accessible by phone and didn't get any issues on my two nights in Seattle.
the House was super clean and neat; the room was really cosy and i had a very cool stay in Seattle thanks to that.
Capitol hill may be not in the Seattle center but it offers a very nice view from the city and the neighborhood is really interesting for someone who wants to understand the city on a different scale. It s 10 minutes from bus from city Downtown. 
thanks a lot Vaibhav for the Hosting ;)"
9317101,56513487,2015-12-14,31305672,Nancy,Casey was very easy to communicate with and friendly. Adored his place! Super clean and close to all attractions downtown. Would love to stay here again someday! 
7492006,40173967,2015-07-28,34220424,Joey,Sandra was super nice and easy going. We would definitely stay at her place again.
7492006,41465364,2015-08-07,34510100,Esma,"We had a great stay in Sandra's apartment. She was very friendly and cool, she greeted us and had guides and magazines on Seattle to orient us, made us a list of good places to visit, and was very and helpful in general. The apartment was like it was in the pictures, it was cute, comfortable, perfect in size for a couple and had a very good location. There were good restaurants and coffee shops in walking distance. It also had a lovely courtyard full of flowers. We really felt at home and was very happy with our stay. Highly recommended! "
7492006,42243139,2015-08-11,3531171,Carlos,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7492006,42576333,2015-08-14,5461173,Wesley,"Sandra was a great host! The place was very clean when I arrived and she made sure to call me before I got to Seattle to give me the details of everything in the apartment. She even left a few beers and some essentials, like butter, in the fridge for me.

The location was excellent. Nice neighborhood in the middle of Capitol Hill, and the outside had a gorgeous garden. Easy walking distance to the grocery store and lots of good restaurants. The only issue was that the wifi was unusable for the most part (too slow), which wasn't a big deal to me since I had cell reception and didn't need to do any work in the apartment.

Overall, my stay was pretty perfect and I feel lucky to have found Sandra's place on relatively short notice!"
7492006,45118528,2015-08-31,39511134,Mark,"Sandra was a great host. The place and location was great, and everything we expected it to be!"
7492006,46086659,2015-09-07,40151880,Katy,Sandra was a responsive and warm hostess. The cottage was in a great location with a lovely shared garden courtyard. Everything was very clean and nice.
7492006,47082221,2015-09-15,24456462,Alexandra,"Sandra was a wonderful host and her apartment is as charming as the photographs. Located within walking distance of tons of shops, bars and restaurants on Capitol Hill, the apartment provided a central yet quiet place to explore Seattle. Getting downtown was easy with a bus ride (stop right next to the apartment) or a $8 uber ride. Check in and out was a breeze. Sandra is a hotel concierge so she was full of great recommendations. Thanks for a great stay! "

609701,1833367,2012-07-29,1004640,Annette,"Nan's cottage is nestled at the back of her secret garden, perfect for a relaxing getaway. The skylights and bay window let in plenty of natural light and the foliage of the garden provides a picturesque view. Nan was a wonderful host in providing us with everything we needed, including tea and Walker's shortbread cookies :) As a Seattle native, I can tell you the location is great, within walking distance of Fremont's shops, bars, cafes, and a walking/biking/running path along the water. If this is your first time to the city or AirBnB, I would definitely recommend staying here!"
609701,1864692,2012-08-01,2985857,Kara & Fred,"This was one of our first Air BnB experiences, and we loved it!  Nan and Mark's cottage is a cozy refuge, tucked away in their backyard amid their garden.  Since it was our first trip to Seattle, we spent quite a bit of time exploring, and the cottage proved to be the perfect space to relax at the end of the day.  It was particularly peaceful and very quiet at night - I slept wonderfully!

It is very easy to walk to Fremont cafes, restaurants, bars, and shops from the cottage, and it is VERY easy to hop on a bus downtown - the bus stop is a block down from their home.

Nan and Mark are wonderful and kind hosts!  After they got us settled, Nan checked in to make sure we had everything we needed via text/Air BnB message so as not to disturb us.  We loved the combination of making sure we were comfortable and respecting our privacy.

We'll definitely be staying here again!  We look forward to seeing you again soon, Nan!

609701,1906123,2012-08-06,2394431,Chris,"A friend and I stayed at Nan's Garden Cottage in Fremont, Seattle and had an absolutely wonderful time. The cottage was stunning, beautifully decorated, spacious, exceptionally tidy, and equipped with all the essentials. Furthermore it was located just a short walk from central Fremont, where those who like cafes, music, great food and superb shopping couldn't pick a better part of Seattle! We were also supplied with bikes for our stay, and were able to ride to neighboring areas easily- one of which was Ballard and was a similarly wonderful area of Seattle. Nan and Mark were nothing short of exceptional hosts, and made our stay perfect.  They supplied us with all the info one could possibly need and were always willing to help out if we ever needed advice/tips. If you are travelling to Seattle you must stay here, I couldn't recommend it more highly!"
609701,1943597,2012-08-10,906945,Sonny,"This charming garden cottage went beyond our expectations. Nan, our host, welcomed us into her absolutely beautiful garden and nestled in the back of this wonderland of trees, green plants, flowers, and a pebbled path, was an adorable cottage.  As we first approached the bay windows, a vase of flowers, a bed with fresh white linens, and a personal touch of care and thoughtfulness into decoration welcomed us to relax and enjoy our stay.  To my surprise, little conveninences were provided, such as soft fresh towels, soap, shampoo and conditioner, an assortment of teas, shortbread cookies...Nan even provided us with bikes and a shopping bag.  The location was perfect as every night we walked down the street where several restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and stores were nearby.  This cottage was a very comfortable place to stay and we would definitely return whenever our travels bring us back to Seattle."
609701,1986492,2012-08-14,3075764,SiSi,"Nan and Mark are extremely welcoming and friendly! Their cottage is ideal for a couple or one person who wants to stay in a cozy, homely environment. The Fremont location is awesome- my boyfriend and I were able to walk to all of the Fremont restaurants and bars/live music venues, not to mention the statue of Lenin! We were a short drive away from the Ballard locks and Gasworks Park. Nan was very accommodating as well- she and Mark had many recommendations for us, and whilst we didn't have use for the two beach cruisers, it was nice to know they were available as their cottage is only a block from the Burke-Gilman trail :)"
609701,2102779,2012-08-26,3187548,Nicola,"Nan's cottage was a great hideaway--very well-appointed, in the midst of an amazingly lush garden. Nan herself was a great host, accommodating but once I was settled in, happy to let me come and go without interference. She even left shortbread cookies for the guests! The one note I might have appreciated is that the parking is parallel parking on a 30ish degree hill. There were generally plenty of places, but my parking break got a good workout."
609701,2112743,2012-08-27,3121100,Normajean,My God-daughter and her husband stayed at this lovely cottage for a family wedding - they were both delighted with the accomodations.  They said that the space was filled with flowers and greenery and that it was like a little Oasis.  I heard that Nan made them very welcome and they would love to stay again.
609701,2206964,2012-09-05,897698,Tara,"The cottage couldn't be cuter! A quick walk to the 28 bus line (and Nan left two free ride passes!), and a lovely stroll to the heart of hilarious, quirky Fremont. We will DEFINITELY be staying here in all our future visits to Seattle! 

(You may want to note that the bathroom is just one stall, with the shower right next to the toilet...and so if someone's in the shower, you can't be doing anything in the bathroom. Totally ok for me + my husband, but it would make getting ready with girlfriends a challenge!)"
609701,2230956,2012-09-08,333764,Ellie,"Listen up, travelers! Nan's place was a real gem. I mean, it was immaculate, full of interesting curio and beautifully appointed. Every single drawer held something to aid a traveler and the check-in was as convenient as could be. I traveled with my mother here and I must say, I have never seen my mom who's almost 70 and not in any stretch ""rugged"" be more impressed. My mother literally did not stop raving about Nan's place and said she felt like she was in a secret garden retreat. It was a perfect place to start our Washington state adventures. I would love to move in! The location is perfect in Fremont near coffee, bars, breweries, and a great Sunday market. This is about as good as it gets on this website."
609701,2258903,2012-09-10,1162439,Kyle,"Loved our stay.  Really like the fact the 'cottage' was on its own (not a room in another house but your own private space).  Wonderful garden and Nan was very accommodating.

Freemont is a nice part of Seattle too.  We hung out there and in Ballard and it was the first time we didn't spend a minute downtown - lots to do in the surrounding neighbourhoods.

"
609701,2306357,2012-09-17,2278696,Jackie,"We had a lovely stay at Nan's garden cottage.  It's adorably decorated, quiet and within easy access of lots of great neighborhoods.  We road the bikes to Ballard (2 miles away) and checked out the salmon running at the Locks.  And Nan stocks the cottage with lots of great surprises- Walker biscuits and tea and a 3 minute facial were my favorites.  This was our first Airbnb experience and it was a really great one."
609701,2307301,2012-09-17,1381365,Lisa,"Nan is a wonderful host! She was quick to respond to all emails and very flexible when my travel/work plans changed. 

 The cottage is super cozy and cute. It is the perfect combo of quaint and practical. The location is fantastic. It's walking distance from Fremont (great food, shopping and nightlife) and has easy access to the 99 (highway that runs north and south). 

Hope I can stay there again soon!"
609701,2392028,2012-09-24,3211840,William,"Comfortable, convenient, clean, cozy and charming, as represented, and delightfully appointed. No complaints from a picky couple. Parking not a problem. We would stay there again. Thanks to our courteous and accommodating hostess."
609701,2420970,2012-09-26,3281258,Anne,"This cottage is, if possible, even cuter in person than in the photos! When I arrived in Nan's lovely garden, I was charmed to see a sign on the cottage welcoming me. I had a friend visiting that day and we had afternoon tea, using the tea and cookies Nan had thoughtfully laid out. 

Nan and Mark were fantastic and generous hosts, giving us recommendations on where to visit and even providing suggestions for yoga classes in the area! They made themselves available for little chats and were very welcoming. I enjoyed exploring Fremont and the local area, which was even easier as Nan had laid out area and bus maps to help me along.
 
The location is great and there are easy bus links into downtown and towards the airport (as my 5:30am departure on the local bus line attests). There's a lot to see, with the Sunday market, the path along the canal and downtown Fremont itself. The only thing I would note is that the surrounding neighborhood is pretty hilly, so bring your walking shoes!

The cottage was extremely cosy and a really lovely place to stay - I absolutely loved it and would definitely stay again. "
609701,2441273,2012-09-28,2592419,Margo,"Loved staying at Nan's cottage.  It is just darling and soooo nice and clean.  It is a beautiful spot with such a quiet and peaceful atmosphere.  The only slight, and I might slight drawback was the narrow walk to the back of the house and into the cottage.   However, this did not hinder the delight in my stay.  Thank you, Nan.  Margo"
609701,2448078,2012-09-29,40759,Sue And Bob,The cottage is very private and very cozy and quaint inside with a nice little kitchen area.  Nan is a wonderful hostess and has taken care to ensure everything one might need during their stay is on hand.  We had a delightful cottage stay and hope to stay again sometime.  Bob & Sue
609701,2504009,2012-10-04,163997,Bill,"We were so fortunate to find Nan and Mark's charming wooded hideaway!
It was so cozy and perfect for a few relaxing days in Seattle.
Both Mark and Nan were gracious hosts and willingly shared information on finding our way around.  
We would definitely return if we were in the area again."
609701,2558563,2012-10-09,3344364,Kate,"""Charming Fremont Garden Cottage"" is an understatement. This perfect little escape is located in Nan's backyard, which is more like a secret enchanted garden. Beauty everywhere you look. Her thoughtful touches are truly inspiring and make it the perfect place to relax and forget the world around. Nan is a wonderful hostess, and made sure we had everything we needed, including bikes, maps, and city recommendations. I will absolutely visit Seattle again, if only to stay in this charming garden cottage! "
609701,2664483,2012-10-20,1401971,Emre,"Everything that we needed were ready waiting for us in the unit. A real cozy cottage in a lush garden - super quiet for a good night's sleep. Nan and Mark were great hosts, friendly and very welcoming. We will definitely be back."
609701,2768837,2012-10-31,3305864,Judith," I feel so lucky to have found the Charming Garden Cottage.  I am from NY and my stay in Seattle was for 10 days, I was on my own and I was looking for a place to feel safe and comfortable in.  What I found exceeded my expectations.  The cottage is, as is Nan, very welcoming.   It is compact, and yet, it had everything I needed; a super comfy bed, a well equipped kitchen, very clean, and cheerful.   As an artist I really appreciate Nan's attention to detail and placement.  Every bit of my experience there was a delight and it suited my needs perfectly.   Nan is a super lady, very interesting and was extremely helpful and accommodating. She placed me in the right direction when I needed help navigating .  I could go on and on in praise about all the little touches...but you need to see it yourself!  This Charming Garden Cottage is truly Charming. 
 "
609701,2809124,2012-11-05,2107858,Rachel,"The cottage is terrific! It's clean, cozy, romantic and looks like something out of a movie. We had a great stay. I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle. "
609701,2880408,2012-11-13,1379818,Krista,"The cottage was even more lovely and perfect than we expected! My partner Ryan and I stayed with Nan for an evening and explored the nearby shops and market, and we have already recommended this wonderful little cottage to friends. Nan was a generous and warm host who offered us tea and coffee upon arrival. The cottage is extremely private and decorated with much appreciated intention. Everything was extremely clean and there was even a space heater for when the evening temperature became chilly. 

I'd recommend this to anyone; truly a divine experience:) Thanks again Nan! "
609701,2888587,2012-11-15,3950363,Suzinn,"The Charming Fremont Garden Cottage truly lives up to its name!  We spent a pleasant night sleeping under the stars (there is a skylight right above the bed, shaded by a tree) amidst a beautiful garden.  We had everything we needed and the bed was very comfortable.
The location was perfect especially for exploring Fremont, Ballard, Green Lake and Wallingford.  Also a short ride to downtown Seattle."
609701,2928963,2012-11-20,3954992,Hayley & Scot,"fabulous cottage...enchanting, cozy, and clean in a magical garden setting. nan evidently cares deeply that her guests feel welcome, comfortable and cared for. all that freemont has to offer was easily accessible on foot.  a wonderful stay!"
609701,2955289,2012-11-25,3150082,Kathy,"I stayed in Nan's cottage for 5 wonderful nights and loved every minute of it. First, the basics: it's clean, exceedingly comfortable, very quiet and secluded, homey and warm in the very best sense and Nan has gone above and beyond to carefully think about and anticipate one's every need. Cold and rainy? There's hot chocolate mix or tea or coffee. Hungry? Have a cookie or popcorn or cook something on the great, little Hotpoint stove. There's a toaster and a refrigerator and a microwave. Want to ride the bus? For free? Nan provides bus coupons. There's shampoo, conditioner, lavender soap, cushy white towels, extra pillows, extra blankets, a skylight above the bed, candles, and reading material. Did I mention Nan is a wonderful host? Kind and friendly and communicative. After a long day of travel I arrived to find my name on the welcome sign by the door! The cottage was warm and the lights were on. I love the cottage style and Nan has captured that aesthetic perfectly. Besides all the great amenities and the garden location, it just made me happy to be in that space on rainy Seattle evenings, with a cup of hot chocolate sitting in bed reading. Vacation heaven. Thank you so much, Nan."
609701,2991712,2012-11-29,3790222,Miranda,I absolutely loved this place. I had a very relaxing few days in this peaceful spot and Nan was a fantastic host. Very highly recommended!
609701,3014087,2012-12-03,1789774,Adam,Nan's cottage was especially lovely and cozy with classic Pacific NW weather. We laid around listening to the rain on the skylights and had a relaxing time away from Portland and our only regret was not being able to take full advantage of the amazing backyard and bikes to ride around the neighborhood. 
609701,3044781,2012-12-08,4227271,Sara,"The pictures probably say it all, but I'll add on a few words: this little cottage was terrific. It's exactly as you see in the photos, except for the sense of calm and warmth you feel while you're there. We enjoyed the surrounding neighborhood, too. Fremont has lots of fun stuff, great coffee, good food and drinks.

Nan was very open and communicative and I appreciated that. The cottage had everything we needed and even things we didn't: cocoa and tea.

I'd go back here all the time if I didn't live a million miles away."
609701,3049528,2012-12-09,1774433,Jody,"My husband and I took a quick trip up to Seattle from Portland and Nan's cottage was ideal.  The Fremont district has tons of bars and restaurants, all of them walking distance from Nan's.  The cottage itself is so cute and had us wondering how we could build something similar in our backyard!  Nan had stocked the kitchen with tea, coffee and some treats, which we enjoyed immensely.  I highly recommend Nan's cottage!"
609701,3135219,2012-12-22,326167,Amelia,Nan's Cottage is so charming and lovely. I wish I could have stayed longer!  It is the perfect spot for launching a Seattle adventure. Nan is gracious host and the cottage is stocked with everything you need to make your stay comfortable and relaxing. 
609701,3163270,2012-12-27,3929771,Pamela,"We had a delightful stay in this aptly named cottage. Nan was a very thoughtful host, providing everything you might need and even inviting us in for a cup of tea on Christmas morning. The cottage is very private, set in a lush garden that I would love to see in the spring or summer. We would definitely stay there again."
609701,3225195,2013-01-02,1466333,Jeff,"This is an absolutely terrific place. You will not be disappointed about it's location. The cottage is very close to fremont's main strip of bars and shops. It's located close to Balard and the Zoo. There's a great walk along the canal trail that is close by. The cottage itself is wonderful. It's whimsical; a traveler's muse. The lighting is great. The kitchen has everything you need. Nan is also very helpful and cool as ice. There is no question about it, if you need a private, cute, romantic escape in Seattle, this is the place!"
609701,3332545,2013-01-12,3866520,Melea,"Doug and I had a lovely time at the Cottage! It was warm & cozy despite the winter rain outside, and Nan's attention to detail really made us feel welcome and at home. Since Doug works offshore and I'm a full-time grad student, we often do not have as much time together as we would like. For this get-away, we were looking for a place that was quiet and private, where we could either hunker down at ""home"" with a bottle of wine, or go exploring; we both agreed that we could not have imagined a more perfect place. 

The location was perfect for us, too; the #40 bus was our go-to. A short ride to Ballard took us to the Locks for a brisk walk along the water (cormorants fishing, eagle circling, heron preening, seal barking), and then to Walrus & Carpenter for a sublime dinner of oysters & small plates; a longer ride south to 3rd & Main took us to the ID for dim sum at Jade Garden. We spent a day downtown admiring regional art & in the Market gathering wine & picnic goodies to take on the ferry to Bainbridge; it is a perfect way to spend a rainy afternoon! We spent a little time kicking around the lovely Fremont, and went antiquing (found a great vintage modern coffee set!) at Seattle Antiques Mall on the waterfront and on Capitol Hill, where we enjoyed Molly Moon's homemade ice cream (earl grey for her; ""walnut maple bourbon crunchy something-or-other"" for him) and a phenomenal meal of smelt, mussels, and salmon at Sitka & Spruce (in the Melrose Market) for our last dinner in town. 

In summary: TOP NOTCH! We hope to be back very soon! 

Thank you, Nan and Mark, for a wonderful stay!

609701,3344791,2013-01-14,2520366,Lisa,"This cozy little cottage was very private and quiet.  It was just what we needed while attending a conference near the university.   We enjoyed lighting all of the candles in the neat old stone fireplace and watching the stars and trees through the big skylight.  This place has lots of character and charm and Nan's little touches, like the personalized welcome sign at the front door, made our stay really enjoyable."
609701,3378535,2013-01-20,1308155,Tori,"Nan's charming cottage is exactly that! It was cozy and clean with everything we needed on hand. Plus it was only a short walk into downtown Fremont with great restaurants and bars to while away the evening. Nan was available for questions and advice and I know that if we were to need anything at all we could ask. I would recommend staying in Nan's cottage to anyone looking for an affordable, clean, and cozy getaway with character. Have fun!"
609701,3398782,2013-01-22,2277755,Bridget,"Nan's cottage was the perfect cozy, relaxing space to stay in Seattle.  The cottage is like a small mother-in-law house, with a nice amount of privacy and everything you could need.  The space is very clean and comfortable.  It's close to a lot of restaurants and stores in Fremont and Ballard.  "
609701,3403696,2013-01-23,4151401,Rebecca,"Great find in great Fremont location! :) I would recommend this place to any couple looking for a cute place to stay. The bus stop is very close, so getting downtown is easy.  It's also close to several restaurants, bars, coffee shops, parks, and vintage stores. "
609701,3441731,2013-01-30,4131358,Melissa,"The cottage is exactly as described! It is a cozy little respite just a half a block from the bus stop. Thank you to Nan for stocking the larder with tea, coffee, oatmeal, popcorn, granola bars and shortbread cookies! I had a wonderful stay and would love to visit again the next time I am in Seattle."
609701,3496952,2013-02-08,4546823,Carol,"This is a cozy cottage. Even though I was there in the winter, the electric heater provided enough warmth for my eight night stay.
The  Fremont neighborhood is a great location base from which to explore Seattle.  Nothing seemed more than 3 or 4 miles away-- downtown,  the university district, Discovery Park, Ballard.
I enjoyed using the bicycle to ride the beautiful and interesting near by rail trail.
Nan is a very friendly and was calm and ionderful when I couldn't find my way back to the cottage my first night. Nan was always there for me when I needed her.
The bed was very comfortable and I slept very well, feeling safe even though I was alone
The decor is classic ""shabby chic.""....you can tell Nan had a lot of fun making all  the ""finds"" that are in the cottage.  I have many of the same things in my own home/
One word of advice before you book:  the charming stone steps and  path to the cottage would be a bit difficult to navigate if you have any balance or walking issues. Since I do not travel light and I am not that strong, it was a bit difficult to bring my HUGE suitcase up the stairs!

This was my first airbnb experience and will definitely use the service again on my next trip.  So nice to get away from sterile hotels. And I will stay at Nan's again if I ever return to Seattle.

609701,3528974,2013-02-12,100354,Hannah,"We loved the location of the cottage and how easily accessible bus routes were! Nan and Mark are great hosts and made our stay extremely comfortable. They were extremely accommodating and even took a few special requests (thank you so much!).  We really appreciated all the extra touches, especially the free bus tickets:)! The cottage is very private and clean. Everything you can possibly need is stocked fully. Two things I feel inclined to mention: the bed is a double and the mattress very soft. Being used to sleeping on a firmer mattress, the pillowy softness took a bit of adjusting. This is completely subjective of course as others may prefer the softer memory foam. Second, Nan clearly states that short showers are recommended due to the small size of the water heater. Fully knowing this, I still tried to indulge in a longer shower.. big mistake! Future garden cottage dwellers, you have been warned... the water will quickly turn cold if you try to indulge like me. Overall, this is a gem of a place in Fremont with amazing owners. Thank you!"
609701,3554790,2013-02-16,4931191,Ashley,"Our stay on the west side of the state was short & sweet. 
Nan's cottage location was perfect.  The cozy ambiance was ideal to get away from the bustle of the city & I fell in love with Fremont! 
This cottage was clean, as well as completely stocked with anything you could possibly need & treats & tea to top it off! 
The candle fireplace, the comfy bed, the decor...are perfect :)
Basically we really enjoyed our stay & will return again!
"
609701,3573216,2013-02-18,4803352,Ian,"What a surprise! There's so much more to this cozy cottage than mentioned in the description. Nan is too modest. She has stocked the cottage with maps, guidebooks, tea, and various breakfast items. We even availed ourselves to a couple of Metro bus passes. The location is very close to a bus stop, but we enjoyed walking around Fremont ourselves. The kitchen was fully equipped with refrigerator and stove, so I would imagine long-term guests benefitting from that. There was also a skylight above the bed where we watched the Seattle rain fall. Perfect. The place is adorable."
609701,3593183,2013-02-20,4196363,Tris & Taia,"Nan's garden cottage truly is charming! A really comfy bed in a very cute and quirky little cottage, all the necessary amenities and surrounded by an amazing garden. The location is great, within easy walking distance to Fremont and a few short bus stops to Ballard as well. Nan was very accomodating and easy going. Would definitely recommend to friends and family :) Thanks Nan!"
609701,3619044,2013-02-26,4061273,Denise,Adorable little cottage in a the fabulous Fremont area.  Very comfortable and clean.  I'll be back!
609701,3637502,2013-02-26,5101990,Katie,"The Fremont cottage was lovely!  We had a great stay.  It was quiet and cozy, well appointed, nicely decorated, and the location was awesome!  Nan was very nice and extremely accommodating.  We can't wait to come back and stay again!"
609701,3708026,2013-03-06,4803740,Robert,"Nan was very friendly and quick to respond to all questions.  The cottage is very comfortable and has everything any traveler could need.  It was the perfect place to come back to after a long day in the city.

Thanks!"
609701,3750573,2013-03-11,2130419,Matt,"This is hands down one of the best places I've ever stayed. Nan is the perfect host, and the cottage is just gorgeous. Perfectly located for seeing all the sights of Freemont (particularly with the free-to-borrow bike). "
609701,3793319,2013-03-15,5367432,Jim,"What a lovely cottage, loaded with decorations and knick-knacks, in the back of an urban garden on a quiet residential street. It's about 50 yards up one of Seattle's notoriously steep streets, and the access is a steep, narrow set of stone steps, but once inside it's warm and cozy. A great getaway, and I'd stay there again."
609701,3818150,2013-03-18,1964585,Quang,"This cottage is awesome! I met Nan on my way in, but she had it set up so I could have just gone right on in. I didn't see her again for the rest of the weekend, and felt like the cottage was really my own, even though it's in their backyard. The neighborhood is fantastic, easy parking, beautiful yard, and the cottage has everything you need, and is organized in a very sweet, thoughtful way. Nan was also great in terms of communicating just the right amount before my trip. She also offered for me to stay as late as I wanted on check out day because she didn't have another guest. How thoughtful. This really is a perfect place to stay in Seattle."
609701,3847593,2013-03-20,511633,Kristina,"What beautiful space with all the essentials! Cozy, comfortable, clean. Relaxing setting, lovely garden & a great selection of teas, coffee, snacks, & lotions to make your stay complete! Thanks Nan- we look forward to staying here again!"
609701,3859281,2013-03-21,2217060,Stacy,"Nan's place truly is named appropriately! Definitely charming.
And so well appointed! Fluffy white heavy towels, bath amenities, THE softest bed ever! It's like a storybook cottage. The knickknacks are perfect.
Clean, comfy and cozy. I will be back in the future!"
609701,3866726,2013-03-22,5539127,Isobel,"Nan's cottage in Freemont was so cute and comfortable, I wished I was in town longer so I could hang out there more. Nan was very helpful, communicative, and welcoming. The cottage itself is incredibly cute. Definitely good value for the cost...I'll never stay in a hotel in Seattle again. I'll definitely be back!!!!"
609701,3887226,2013-03-25,4741217,Ana,"I was visiting Seattle for a weekend workshop and staying for one night; this was my first Airbnb experience.  I loved my stay at Nan's cottage :)  This was one comfortable bed, no kidding; I slept like a baby!  Had plenty of fresh towels, kitchen amenities, and heat sources.  I loved the skylight above the bed, and the HUGE walk in shower/bathroom that was stocked with everything a traveler could need.
The location proved to be great, it was easy to find and like stepping into a little getaway in the city.  There was some mild construction from the neighbor during the day, but so quiet at night.  The light coming through the windows was so refreshing and calming; it was entertaining to watch the neighborhood squirrels gallop by.
I would, without doubt, stay here again!  Thanks so much Nan, for making me feel so welcome and so comfortable!"
609701,3913879,2013-03-26,3751240,Nancy,"Nan provided such a warm, welcoming and lovely experience. Everything was perfect, and the cottage is just wonderful. I will be staying here again when I need accommodations in Seattle!"
609701,3927892,2013-03-28,2683233,Pauline,"Nan's cozy cottage was a delightful start to our Seattle visit. I loved the early morning view of the garden while sipping tea and listening to the birds. Location, location, (email hidden) easy to catch public transportation and also walk to many different
 eateries. "
609701,3956743,2013-03-30,4996556,Tim And Patty,"What a treat Nan has created for us in her backyard.  Beauty, privacy, and every little extra that one might imagine.  Plus a location convenient to downtown, the U district, Ballard, Fremont, and Wallingford.  We have found our home away from home in Seattle."
609701,3966606,2013-03-31,5524796,Daniel,"Nan was the perfect host. We had complete privacy and the place was absolutely adorable, with a very comfortable bed. We got to say goodbye to Nan in the morning and she was very friendly and sweet, we'd love to go back."
609701,4040617,2013-04-05,2376824,Sam,"Nans place is great, we have travelled all over the country and this was definitely the most homely. Bed was really comfy, the basic kitchenette and bathroom provided everything we needed for the few nights we were in Fremont. The location is great, it is really close to the bus stop and only a short walk from the main strip in Fremont, plenty of bars, shops and restaurants. Nan was great, she provided lots of touristy information for our trip and made our stay great. Would definitely stay there again."
609701,4067801,2013-04-07,3711911,Cendrine,Fantastic little house in the Willy Wonka/Fairy forest. Loved my experience in Seattle knowing I could come home at night and relax.  
609701,4223848,2013-04-20,5080303,Pam,"this cottage is in a perfect location for public transit, walking and biking, if you like to get around that way.  i had a wonderful time, and it was pretty amazing to have such a nice little hideaway to come back to during the chilly spring days i was there.  thanks a million nan!"
609701,4280811,2013-04-24,2647849,Kim,"Nan's cottage was absolutely adorable and perfect homebase for our time in Seattle. It's close to the bus and walking distance to everything great about Fremont (including the co-op and Caffe Ladro). We hadn't read deeply enough to know about the tiny water heater, so were a little surprised when the first shower went cold fairly quickly. But it wasn't that big of a deal. The garden was gorgeous, the bed comfy, and Nan was a really nice host."
609701,4306743,2013-04-26,5076648,Marie,"This is a lovely cottage, very charming in the middle of trees and plants and meanwhile, very convenient to visit downtown! Nan was really sweet and helpful. I definitely recommand this place to anyone who wants to visit Seattle."
609701,4409624,2013-05-03,1857929,Caitlin,"Nan's cottage is so charming, and her garden is so beautiful. It was so nice to stay in a place so surrounded by nature but within walking distance of so many good restaurants and shops. "
609701,4442915,2013-05-06,4687304,Kristiana,Nan and her husband are wonderful and gracious hosts and their cottage is absolutely lovely. Highly recommended.
609701,4669246,2013-05-19,1995936,Janelle,Nan's backyard cottage was adorable. My mom and I had a great time staying there. Our favorite part was the welcome sign with our names on it! Her backyard is beautiful - it's like a little oasis in the middle of Seattle. Highly recommended!
609701,4727052,2013-05-22,5338737,Robyn,The Fremont cottage is exactly as described and photographed. It is a cosy little cottage walking distance from the bus stop near a very trendy part of Fremont. It is extremely well equipped with everything a traveller could need. We did not meet Nan(or anyone else) during our stay which did feel a little strange. We stayed 3 nights. I would definitely stay in Fremont Cottage if we return to Seattle.
609701,4758043,2013-05-24,5731861,Jillian,"Wonderful!  Perfect spot to stay whilst getting over a long flight... I Struggled to leave the cottage as it was so cosy and comfortable!!

The little treats were also greatly appreciated for a weary traveller and having some food, milk and coffee there when I arrived meant that I could just focus on getting over the jet lag!

I felt safe and had lots of privacy staying alone too- great spot, would definitely stay again if I come back to Seattle! Thanks so much Nan :)"
609701,4872239,2013-05-30,1547892,Kathryn,"What a treat! From our names written on the blackboard outside the cottage, to the delightful space in the cottage, to the green garden all around, it was just wonderful to be here. We spoke to Nan twice when we met in the yard, but it was private for our whole 6 day stay. Nan and her husband were there if we needed them. I can't think of a single negative thing to say! We travel by public transportation and it is about 6 blocks from most of the commercial part of town, but we like to walk and the canal path was a great way to walk into the main part of town. The cottage itself had everything we needed including a fan and a heater and tons of towels and toiletries. 
Thanks so much for all the care you put into this!

Kathy and Michael"
609701,4932766,2013-06-03,951583,Charles S,"Staying in Nan's cottage confirmed once again the great value in using Airbnb for accommodations when I travel.  It's a lovely, quiet place, very private, with access to downtown when you need it.  Nan was quick to address whatever I needed in a timely way. I will return whenever possible."
609701,4967839,2013-06-04,1422930,Jessie,"Nan's cottage was the perfect place to stay in Seatlle.  It's located in the very cool neighborhood of Fremont but since it's in the back garden surrounded by flowers and trees, you feel like you're out of the city.  Nan also let us borrow her bicycles, which made our trip so wonderful.  The bike path is right down the hill from her cottage and we easily biked to Gas Works Park and Ballard (in the other direction).  The cottage has everything you need.  We would definitely return.  Thanks, Nan!"
609701,5020318,2013-06-08,4983141,Janice,A perfect cottage tucked in a wooded garden. Every detail has been considered and the bed is super comfy! A great location for exploring Seattle and an easy walk to Fremont. Would stay again and wish we stayed longer! Thank you. 
609701,5056515,2013-06-10,3824410,Krista,"Super cute cottage great location!  Nan was very kind and accommodating.  The only thing I would say I didn't like was that the toilet and shower share the same room and floor so when you shower the whole bathroom floor is wet, I really didn't like that.  The kitchen was great but there really was not a table to eat a meal at in the cottage.  Besides those two things the place was great and I would recommend it to friends!!!"
609701,5131530,2013-06-14,5469607,John,"We loved staying with Nan in her cute, quaint, and artistic cottage! At first, I was hesitant to stay far from downtown (especially since the purpose of my trip was to see a soccer game). However, it is super easy to hop on the 28 or 40 bus and get right into town. Also, I am very happy we took Nan's advice and explored Fremont. Fremont was very cool. Check out the great restaurants, shops, bars, Lenin Statue, the infamous Troll, Fremont Brewery, and Theo Chocolate...oh yeah, Paseo sandwiches are delicious as well!!!! Next time we are back in Seattle, we will without a doubt book Nan's place!!!!"
609701,5229146,2013-06-19,6186867,Jeff,"Nan's cottage was indeed charming. It had everything we needed for a 40th anniversary celebration, was just the right size for a hideaway and was exactly as pictured and described. We felt secluded in a wonderful garden and yet Nan and her husband were always close by if we had a question. We loved the provided bikes, the close proximity to the Rail Trail and the bus and the easy walk into charming downtown Fremont, which is, very probably indeed the Center of the Universe. The cottage is close enough for easy rides to the museums at the end of Lake Union and also to Ballard for the locks and fish ladder. We spent five days on this trip and barely scratched the surface of things to do. We'd love to return someday, and wouldn't consider staying anywhere else."
609701,5278404,2013-06-22,3707387,Troy,"Wowsers, what a beautiful unique space and setting! It's clear that Nan loves hosting people in her beautiful home and cottages.  We will definitely hope to stay again soon!  "
609701,5359149,2013-06-26,4689768,Nicola,"This is the best place to stay in Seattle! The cottage is absolutely gorgeous, quirky and comfy in a beautiful garden setting and Nan is the best hostess you could ask for. Free bus tickets, advice and bikes. Also, the area you are based in is fantastic, great atmosphere with plenty of places to eat and drink and only a short bus ride into Seattle itself - just watch out for the troll!"
609701,5574101,2013-07-07,1640251,Gerry,"Cozy studio so close to trendy Fremont and the canal bikeway.
Lovely cottage in a garden setting, comfy bed with all amenities.
Even bikes to use on the bikeway...and lots of hints and info about where to go and where to eat.
Thanks Nan you made our Seattle stay memorable.
Robyn and Gerry.....don't forget to come Down Under one day!"

Charmingly decorated with small personal touches, like the welcome sign with your name painted on it, make this a ""must stay"" place in Seattle!  Nan is a wonderful hostess!"
609701,5691825,2013-07-12,6179779,Kelly,"Nan was a wonderful hostess, with a refreshing beverage waiting upon arrival. The cottage and garden are delightful--I felt like I was in a sweet little dream. I will definitely stay here when I travel to Seattle to visit my friend."
609701,5781188,2013-07-16,1266882,Cindy,"Nan's magical garden cottage is a haven of relaxation, birdsong, and comfort. She has provided every detail a traveler could want in a well organized, vintage atmosphere.
Nan herself is naturally communicative and helpful.....when I arrived, admittedly tired and not too strong,  she helped carry all my things up to the cottage. We then sat in the nourishing garden and chatted about life, like two old friends.
Others have raved about the details of Nan's hideaway. If you want peace and comfort on the edge of a hip Seattle neighborhood, then this is your place!"
609701,5824925,2013-07-18,4649963,Dionne,"This place was just perfect for our stay in Seattle. Location is super good and place was cozy and clean, situated in a beautiful garden. "
609701,5879797,2013-07-21,1647584,Naima,"Love love LOVE the Cottage! Nan and Mark have created a haven in a secret garden. This was the perfect place to take refuge after long days of touring. They made check in and check out easy, and Nan was very quick to reply to all my questions. Her kindness, integrity, and positive attitude are apparent in the way she runs her AirBnB space. Highly recommended! "
609701,5915164,2013-07-22,7010459,Steve,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Nan's cottage. Great tea! We would definitely return for another stay in Seattle.

609701,5985469,2013-07-25,3973865,Siobhan,"We loved the cottage! It was exactly as in the pictures. There were so many little details that just added to the overall experience. 
We had a lovely time and would stay again without a doubt! "
609701,6099654,2013-07-30,3991640,Philiy,"We absolutely loved our stay here. The cottage was beautiful. Had everything we needed. Nan and mark were very friendly hosts. It was great to have the bikes. Which we rode into downtown Seattle and then got the water taxi across to  west seattle. The bike trail there was beautiful.

We were glad we stayed in Fremont and got to enjoy that area as well as Seattle and it was really easy to get a bus downtown.

Don't hesitate, stay here you won't regret it xx"
609701,6145669,2013-08-01,3506962,Dennis & Monica,"Nan's lovely cottage was the ideal location for our visit to Seattle.  With Nan's generous assistance she helped us to navigate throughout the city by public transportation.  What a joy not to drive or get lost!  It's super easy to use the  buses from Nan's cottage.  

 This was our  third visit to Seattle and the very best by far due to our beautiful accommodations and the graciousness of our hosts, Nan and Mark!  We were sad to leave such an oasis in the city!  By the way, the Fremont neighborhood is a very cool place to stay, and with Nan's help we enjoyed great places to eat too!   Thank you kindly for everything!!  You have such a wonderful Airbnb!

With  gratitude, Dennis and Monica ... Swansea, Illinois. "
609701,6319311,2013-08-08,1872747,Michael,"This is such an amazing and fairy tale-like place to stay while visiting Seattle. From the cozy cottage with the personalized welcome chalkboard to the daily greetings from the backyard bunny, this place was the absolute best. From the start, Nan lets you know you are welcome by getting in touch with you first and making sure you are okay with time and directions. She makes the entire stay a pleasure by her upbeat attitude and just letting you come and go as you please. The use of the bikes (helmets and lock included!) is such an added bonus and believe me, we made use of them and they are great. We'd be happy to stay here again if, and definitely when, we return to Seattle."
609701,6505404,2013-08-15,2459701,Rachel,"Nan's cottage was a terrific and unique place to stay. All in all, everything went smoothly! The cottage is small, but was quite clean and had everything we needed, plus some extras that made things easier, like 2 free bus passes to get us started in town. As others have mentioned, the shower is european style and does not have a separate enclosure apart from the rest of the bathroom. This wasn't a problem, just something to be aware of.

The cottage felt private, as it was tucked behind a garden. Also—somewhat unrelated to this review—Nan has a giant pet bunny that sometimes hangs out in a cage in the garden! We thought that was pretty cool. 

I'd recommend the cottage to anyone on a budget who wants somewhere comfortable and doesn't mind a few quirks."
609701,6578686,2013-08-18,3942315,Roland,This was a magical experience from the moment we walked up the path following the lights to our very own little fairy world.  Our cottage for three days was every little girl's dream. Nan was like a fairy God-mother - providing everything you need. We felt cared for and special - what more could you ask for. Thank you Nan and Mark and we look forward to seeing you again.
609701,6727030,2013-08-23,5542581,Kate,"We stayed twice, before and after a trip to the mountains- Charming is exactly what this cottage was. Loved it and would stay again. Fremont is a lovely area and easy to get into Seattle from, I would recommend Fremont over the inner city. Lots of great bars and local breweries, good food- all close by. Nan is friendly and helpful, her cottage is beautiful!"
609701,6845097,2013-08-27,6575882,Kate,I couldn't have hoped for a better place to stay while in Seattle than Nan's cottage - it had absolutely everything I could have possibly needed and was in such a fantastic location! Nan and Mark were wonderful hosts and the cottage itself was great - decorated and stocked with such attention to detail! 
609701,6913036,2013-08-30,5439607,Jill,"Very private enchanting cottage in the back of the house, hidden in a secret garden, close to the hub of the Fremont district. Nan was an accommodating gracious host. We would love to come back again."
609701,6954127,2013-09-01,5884602,Anna,"We had 3 days of camping in the rain (beautiful, but wet and no sleep) and a 5 hour drive back to Seattle.  This was everything we could have hoped for.  It was secluded, warm, clean and just so welcoming.

The cottage is just cozy.  A bit bed which was amazing to sleep in, small kitchen with huge selection of teas, oven and microwave.  And a small shower room with selection of shampoos and moisturisers.

There's also a TV and DVD player if you want to chill in the evening.

The area of Fremont is also just really friendly.  Lots of nice restaurants and bars to get food if you can't be bothered to cook.  The cottage didn't have a washer/dryer so we found a laundrette 2 minutes away.

I didn't get chance to meet Nan, but I did meet Mark and he very kindly let us hang our wet tent out to drive.

The place is really beautiful, it was clean and had everything we needed."
609701,7032842,2013-09-04,6029049,Elizabeth,"Nan was a wonderful host.  My boyfriend and I stayed for 3 nights in September.  The cottage was cozy and although there was no air conditioning, the temperature was quite comfortable with the windows open and the fan circulating.  She even provided bus passes to get around town and access to bicycles with locks and helmets.  There was plenty of granola bars, tea, and instant coffee available.  All in all a great stay!"
609701,7669219,2013-09-29,7900306,Antonella,"We couldn't have been more pleased with the accommodations that Nan provided.  The cottage is absolutely charming - very clean, well appointed and so romantic.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and are very grateful to Nan for going out of her way to ensure that we were comfortable and happy while in her care.  From the very first contact, Nan was very prompt in responding to our messages and very helpful in providing all sorts of information. This was our very first experience with Airbnb and what a fantastic introduction it was! I highly recommend Nan's garden cottage and cannot wait to go back!"
609701,7768414,2013-10-02,6509494,Rachel,"The cottage was very cute and clean. It was very neat and organized. It was close to many things that we wanted to do. It really felt like Nan had gone a few extra steps to make us feel at home, like leaving wifi info, bus route info ect. There was a very cute chalkboard welcoming us by name and that was very sweet. The cottage is in the homeowners backyard and they were very quiet, you didn't feel like you were in someone's yard. There are tons of flowers and plants that afford privacy from the house. And they have a pet bunny that graces the back yard on occasion! It was a wonderful experience that I would whole heartedly recommend. "
609701,7846284,2013-10-06,1287663,Ian,"We loved the little cottage at the back of Nan and Mark's place in Fremont. The cottage is in a good location, very quiet, with easy access to buses and to bike paths on the canal and not far from coffee shops in Fremont. The cottage It is lovely and light, with plenty of windows and skylights and great kitchen and bathroom facilities, efficient heating and wifi access."
609701,7925897,2013-10-08,507273,Majid,Cottage was really fun! I loved the extra touches that made our stay very nice! We used the bicycles to ride to the Downtown Fremont District as well! Bed was a bit soft sprung for me but was fine for my travel companion. We had a lot of fun and I would recommend this place! We stayed only 2 nights but I wish we had an extra day! Also Nan was super friendly! 
609701,7977775,2013-10-11,49953,Una,"I had an absolutely delightful time in Nan's wonderful garden cottage, perfectly located in terms of peace and quiet, but also close to downtown Fremont. There were lovely touches - cookies, delicious drinks, a fireplace full of candles, a super comfortable bed and I love the 'vintage/English country cottage' style. Nan was also very helpful in organising a cab for me when I left. I would not consider staying anywhere else on future visits to Seattle. A real find - both in terms of lovely Nan and her beautiful cottage and garden. Thank you!  Una "
609701,8079291,2013-10-15,1752229,Talaina,"I could not have been happier with my stay at this beautiful cottage. Spending a few days and nights here truly felt like home and Nan and Mark made my boyfriend and I feel completely spoiled. I would highly recommend a stay here. Friendly, clean, peaceful, and wonderfully decorated to boot. Absolutely perfect!

"
609701,8156247,2013-10-18,9112445,Sheryl,Nan's place is absolutely adorable and cozy and quiet.  And the best part about Nan's cottage is Nan herself.  She is so incredibly welcoming and will really bend over backwards to make your stay the best without being intrusive at all.  Please enjoy!
609701,8324436,2013-10-26,6591658,Laura,"Nan's little cottage was the ideal place for me to stay on my trip to Seattle. I had lots of privacy, and I found I'd really overpacked as there were already towels and many toiletries. Nan also provided many teas and snacks. The space was functional, but it was also comfortable and cozy. I would definitely stay there again. Thank you, Nan!"
609701,8404488,2013-10-29,764861,Ed & Ash,We came to visit for a few days to explore the Seattle area. This adorable warm cottage is tucked away in a secret garden and is tranquil and private. The location is ideal for the Fremont area and theres plenty of great places to visit within biking distance. We would love to stay here again. 
609701,8475115,2013-11-01,9112445,Sheryl,This is the second time I came and I'll be back!  Nan is  a doll and the place is completely lovely.  Enjoy!
609701,8564006,2013-11-05,8960842,Susan,"The cottage is an absolute delight and great fun to stay in.  I stayed for 3 nights and had everything I needed.  If you don't want to go out to eat there is a tiny full kitchen that you can cook in.

I walked everywhere, but the bus stop is close by.  It is really fun to walk or bike across the Fremont draw bridge and if you are lucky you might get to see the bridge go up.

Nan is a delight, very easy to talk to and a SO gracious hostess.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this cottage to anyone."
609701,8642523,2013-11-10,9523358,Mary Anne,"We enjoyed the loveliest stay at Nan's cottage.  It is, in a word, charming !! and Nan provided every possible item we needed.  The cottage is in her very green, very lovely back yard with much light and every accoutrement.  We will be back just as soon as we can.  Thanks Nan !!"
609701,8674565,2013-11-11,9767436,Kara,"Our stay in Nan's cottage was short, but wonderful. The bed was comfortable, the kitchen and bathroom convenient, and the location quiet and private. Thank you Nan, for a wonderful stay! We plan on coming back on our next trip up.  "
609701,8709664,2013-11-12,514158,Tao-Ming,"My partner and I stayed at Nan's regrettably only for a night but it was quiet, clean, and romantic (the sign on the cottage door with our name even made us feel that much more welcome!). We unfortunately didn't get to meet Nan but rather her cats in the garden and her cute giant bunny. It's a quiet oasis on a treelined hilly street. We would definitely consider returning. Tao"
609701,8925834,2013-11-26,7465511,Kate,"Such a beautiful place to stay!  It's a gorgeous cottage in such a great suburb,  we couldn't have asked for a better spot in Seattle. Nan is so lovely and accommodating!  She is extremely helpful and approachable! We hope one day to return to Seattle and Nan's adorable cottage! "
609701,9124759,2013-12-09,6756460,Peggy,"If you are looking for a cute old fashioned cottage in a garden, with TV, kitchen, great heat and air, great lighting, and where you can even watch the stars at night thru a skylight over the bed, this is it.  You can escape the city in this garden setting. Nan is well organized, kind, and generous… this is a happy home. Thanks!
"
609701,9185061,2013-12-11,3070697,Amy,"Nan has created such a lovely space! I fell in love with the property and the cottage was super sweet. Great shower, great bed, great everything! Stay here:) "
609701,9196597,2013-12-12,3370,Andrew,"Wonderful place, completely lives up to it's description. Quiet, out of the way and unobtrusive. Would stay there again in a heartbeat."
609701,9216390,2013-12-14,4601257,Roxanne,"The cottage is sweet, cozy, and simply perfect. Location is also very desirable, and is walking distance to ""downtown"" Fremont, ie, stores, restaurants, cafes, and the PCC market. Very close to the canal, for taking nice walks or bike rides. I would stay here again, and hope to. I imagine it is very lovely in the warm weather, as the cottages sits in the middle of a lush garden, set away from the street, with complete privacy."
609701,9250280,2013-12-16,2110103,Catherine,"This is a delightful place to stay. The cottage is indeed charming and comfortable. Set in the beautiful back garden it has everything one might need in a creative and efficient space. Easy and private access for coming and going as need be. Nan is an excellent host who responds quickly to questions, anticipates needs and unobtrusively provides for a pleasant stay. A real bargain. Highly recommended. 
"
609701,9425913,2013-12-28,9738335,Chad,"We had a great experience at the cottage!  Fully stocked with toiletries and other essentials that we might have forgotten, cozy and private and very convenient to Aurora/99.  It really was the perfect place to stay, for us. We'll be back. Thanks Nan!

609701,9465888,2013-12-30,9506743,Erin,"This is a great space with everything you need- with a bonus of skylights to let in the morning sun.  It's close to the water, and Fremont and Ballard (two great Seattle neighborhoods).  The only tough part about this place is the STEEP hill the house is located on, but that's Fremont for you."
609701,9688072,2014-01-05,1466333,Jeff,"This is the best place to stay in Seattle. My girlfriend and I love this place and Nan! This was our second time staying here and we will definitely be back. It's all in the details. The place is definitely cozy and a great place to rest up after touring around Seattle. It's close to everything. The 40 and 28 bus lines are less than a 5 min walk. Both lines will get you downtown in about 20 to 30 mins. Freemont is a 5 to 10 minute walk. Definitely try the Outlander Brewery if you find yourself in Freemont. There is a trail along the canal that is about a 3 min walk from the cottage. The trail will take you to Ballard or to Gas Works park and beyond. To sum it up, the cottage has three C's going for it: it's cute, comfortable, and, convenient."
609701,9718600,2014-01-06,10646252,Melanie,"Loved Nan's Cottage!  It was such a wonderful escape to a little shabby chic place that is within walking distance to Fremont.  We had a great time shopping, dining, and visiting Fremont.  Super clean, and a perfect stay overall."
609701,9852182,2014-01-14,1580344,Kimberlee,"The Fremont Garden Cottage is beautiful, cozy and perfect in every way.  Nan is an amazing host and she has taken care of all the little details that make a person feel so welcomed.  I would highly recommend the Fremont Garden Cottage.

Thank you Nan for your warmth and welcome!

609701,9989608,2014-01-23,10869488,Cynthia,Nan's cottage was very welcoming and comfortable.  The bed was great and the location was perfect for what I was looking for.  Being located behind the house made it very quiet and private.  Thank you for providing such a lovely place to stay.
609701,10060888,2014-01-28,9928973,Naomi,"Nan's cottage in Fremont is located in the heart of Seattle minutes away from downtown, the Ballard district, beautiful city parks and great tea shops. We enjoyed walking the path from the busyness of the road through the mossy garden into the quiet cottage, where we were able to prepare meals and relax. We were happy to meet Nan on the morning of our departure and had a lovely chat with our very warm hostess. My partner and I had a great time... "
609701,10810798,2014-03-09,5563686,Jennifer,I stayed at the cottage for 6 nights and Nan was the perfect host. The cottage was very clean and had all the necessary amenities. I would definitely stay there again. Thanks so much Nan!
609701,14144322,2014-06-13,6688754,Lisa,"What an absolutely marvelous place to stay! It was clean, cozy and so secluded.  Sitting in the garden (which we wish we'd had a chance to do more) you wouldn't even know you were in the city.  You couldn't ask for better hosts.  Even though we never met Nan face to face on our 10 day stay there was easy communication via email.  She saw to it that our every need was met... without even asking I might add. We will certainly be staying here again if it is available the next time we are in Seattle."
609701,14296043,2014-06-16,8145770,Emily,My husband and I stayed at this lovely cottage for  2 nights! We loved staying here Nan has done such an incredible job of making this cottage feel so welcoming. The mini kitchen was perfect for hearing up leftovers and making a quick breakfast! We would def stay here again! 
609701,14449000,2014-06-19,48770,Sarah,"What an amazing cottage! It was like stepping into a fairy tale. The grounds were lush and beautiful and the cottage was a dream. So clean, so comfy, just delightful. The location cannot be beat. You're close to everything. There is tons of parking. I felt very safe and taken care of. Nan is so sweet and nice... I wish I got to spend more time chatting with her! Finally, my favorite part if my stay was Delphine- Nans adorable bunny!! What a personality! So sweet and fun to watch run around her little yard. I can't wait to go back!"
609701,14595570,2014-06-23,12028574,Katie,"Nan's charming Fremont garden cottage was everything we were expecting and more. It's a really cool little studio at the back of a beautifully lush and dense garden. Very secluded, very quiet. Nan & Mark were really great hosts. A warm welcome and a pantry & fridge stocked with treats fortified us after a long drive in.
We were in town for Fremont Fair and the cottage was so close to all the action. We loved Nan's  garden cottage. We will be back!

609701,14781719,2014-06-26,1589377,Leah,"The cottage was amazing! So cute and the perfect little hide-away. The location was excellent, just minutes away from Fremont and we did all of Seattle on public transport without a problem! For Brits like us there was a taste of home in that cottage (though a lot lovelier than my actual home) and we loved being in a tranquil garden - so peaceful. Would absolutely come back in a heartbeat. Anyone thinking of staying will love it - promise! "
609701,15031429,2014-07-01,13451792,Will,"A beautiful, compact cottage that had everything we needed.  It was clean, comfortable and just as depicted - no faked wide-angle shots here!  Really convenient for downtown, with frequent buses just down the hill.  And although close to a busy road, it is very quiet; almost like being in the country. We would definitely want to return ... Will & Judith"
609701,15183563,2014-07-04,2972119,Philip,"This was our first stay using airbnb, and now the bar has probably been set unrealistically high for all subsequent stays at other airbnb locations.  The cottage provides a thoroughly Thoreauvian experience in the midst of a thriving city.  It was quiet, cozy, and stocked with virtually every amenity you could imagine.  We didn't get to meet Nan, but her personality infuses all of the wonderful details of the cottage.  We couldn't have picked a better place to stay in Seattle.    "
609701,15387673,2014-07-08,10932840,David,"Omg.   Nan has created a standard totally unfair to judge others by!   Her cottage is tucked away in a magical garden of fruit trees, plants and flowers.    Everything was perfect, including the location only steps away from bus stop.   This whole experience was perfect!!!!   Thanks Nan!"
609701,15567894,2014-07-12,12098762,Lisa,"We were so thrilled with our experience staying here for four nights.  Nan and her husband made us feel welcomed and accommodated every question and request that we had.  The cottage is in a central location and it was great to use their bikes to ride along the canal or get food. The cottage is set back from the street away from the house, so it feels like staying in a private and secluded secret garden.  The cottage is small, but it contains everything a couple would need.  I highly recommend staying here, and we plan to come back! "
609701,15905731,2014-07-18,11694665,Lukas,"Nan was very welcoming, it felt as if the cottage was already waiting for us. Everything looked exactly like it does in the pictures and even though it's a small space, it really is very cozy and especially quite.
Probably the best part is the neighbourhood. Fremont is a great place to walk around, have breakfast or lunch at cool places and see some really cool stuff. We made heavy use of the bike Nan provided, which was a perfect way to get to Downtown Seattle.

We would totally recommend Nan's cottage to anyone looking for a quite, cozy place in a cool neighbourhood but in arm's reach of Downtown Seattle."
609701,16196922,2014-07-23,1369575,Marissa And John,"What a perfect little place to stay in Seattle! It was quaint, central funky and comfortable. We loved it and would love to come for a visit again. Thank you Nan!"

We had everything we could possibly need, and more (loved the coffee via French press in the morning!) We loved walking around Fremont and found getting the bus to downtown really easy. We were in town for a wedding and told many guests about Nan's place for future visitors (especially couples)--we will certainly try to stay here again when we return to Seattle!"
609701,16700785,2014-08-01,11688525,Jennifer,"Lovely, charming cottage, tiny, but everything you need.  Nan was very friendly and helpful."

I can't even begin to describe the charm and character of the adorable guest home tucked away among lush greenery and vintage treasures.  The cottage was inviting and had everything we could've ever needed. Snacks, toiletries, and plenty of towels. Not to mention the most beautiful decor.  Next time we're back in Seattle, we won't be staying anywhere else. THANK YOU!! "
609701,17195797,2014-08-09,11688525,Jennifer,This was our 2nd visit.  Just as perfect as before.

Location was convenient for us, there was plenty of street parking, and great to have privacy of a cottage to come and go whenever we needed to.  Especially loved the bunny!"

609701,18935158,2014-09-03,353342,Tom,"Such a relaxing place to wake up in each morning and a welcome respite after returning from an active day of sightseeing.  Supplied bicycles allowed us to easily travel to nearby coffee shop and cafe. If you're lucky, a big bunny greets you on the pathway to the cottage!  "

609701,19372245,2014-09-11,14334519,Ryan,"Nan's cottage was perfect for our trip. Nan has thought of everything you might need from snacks to tea and she even put out two bus passes for us! The location is great and easy to get to via multiple bus lines. Fremont/Ballard were even better than we had expected, perfect for people who love small businesses specializing in all types of food, beer and coffee! 

If we're in the area again we would absolutely stay at Nan's again!"
609701,19472833,2014-09-13,3236620,Lisa And Callum,"There's a reason Nan has almost 150 positive reviews because her garden cottage is brilliant! It has everything you could need including tea/coffee/cereal bars. The art and pieces in the cottage are beautiful, it's 15 minutes by bus to Seattle downtown and close to supermarkets, coffee shops and restaurants but really quiet at the same time. Finally it's great value!

Thanks Nan we couldn't have asked for more. If you'd have us back we'd love to stay again. "
609701,19929540,2014-09-21,1393779,Cara,"What a lovely place to stay in Seattle. Everything was perfect, and the hosts made us feel very welcome without being intrusive. We loved how quiet it was at night, all the little thoughtful touches (like personalized chalkboard welcome), and the bikes that made getting around Seattle super easy. I hope we get the chance to stay here again!"
609701,20138507,2014-09-24,1016831,Jennifer,Nan was such a wonderful hostess. She gave us our space and made the cottage like a private retreat. Not to mention that the cottage itself was absolutely adorable. We wish we could have stayed longer and have already recommended her to friends who are traveling to Seattle soon. Thank you for having us!
609701,20416601,2014-09-29,18473590,Chris,We had a fabulous stay in Seattle.  Staying in Nan's Fremont garden cottage was fabulous.  The garden is gorgeous and the cottage is cozy. We started our stay with a cup of tea in the garden. We would love to stay here again on future visits.  We very highly recommend Nan's cottage to other couples visiting. A refreshing change from hotels.
609701,20659217,2014-10-03,10032495,Glenn, Nan was very welcoming and helpful during our brief stay in Seattle. Cottage was very cosy and had everything we needed including comforts bed. Fremont great suburb for coffee and food.

609701,21333667,2014-10-15,13153964,Annie,"Nan's cottage lives up to its name - super cozy and charming in a lush garden, making for a fantastic retreat. Nan is a great host, super friendly and always available if we had any questions. The garden is beautiful and make sure to give Delphine the bunny a treat on your way out. Great location, walking distance to Freemont and Ballard and also a stones throw away from the the bus to downtown. I would highly recommend this cozy cottage and would stay again if we make our way back to Seattle! "
609701,21657597,2014-10-21,20375804,Shakira,"This was the most magical and beautiful place I've ever stayed! The sweet bunny Delphine was outside to greet us when we arrived and the entire process was so EASY! The cottage was gorgeous and peaceful, with everything you could ever need inside. What a delightful family with an amazing location. Never a problem with parking or traffic from the cottage into the city and were thrilled to find out some of our convention locations were walking distance! Just can't get enough of their new puppy Fargo either, such lovable amazing people and pets! I cannot wait to come back! A true inspiration for a gardener as well! My heart overflows with gratitude for being able to stay in such a calming atmosphere. STAY HERE! you will love it. 3!!!"
609701,21823574,2014-10-25,4944147,Zach,"This was such a lovely place to stay -- a cozy hideaway that was actually hidden away by the surrounding trees. Wonderful, wonderful location within easy walking distance to Fremont and Ballard. Such a cozy delight -- thanks again!"
609701,21984718,2014-10-27,816190,Christopher,"We absolutely loved this cozy little cottage.  It was the perfect place to stay on a rainy fall day in Seattle.  The neighborhood was great - very walkable to shops and restaurants, with a bus stop less than a block away.  Nan was an excellent hostess (as was the bunny and the puppy!)  Would definitely stay again."
609701,22304272,2014-11-03,2442043,Diane,"This little cottage is delightful!   About the size of a hotel room, with everything you need.  Sweetly furnished with a collection of vintage prints and pottery, it is a welcoming, private and unique space.  The lush garden pathway in gives such a sense of quiet and remove from the city.   

Nan greeted us warmly in person and with a sign on the cottage with our names.  A nice touch.  We knew we could seek help with anything if needed, but the main house across the garden did not feel intrusive in any way.  

The bed was remarkable.  It was one thing I'd worried about as I love a very firm mattress.   It is described as soft in other reviews - and is, yet in such a way (memory foam topper) that I absolutely loved.  Big surprise for me.  We slept great and I even took naps to get some more.  The bedding was perfect for the season (flannel sheets) and down comforter with extra warmth as needed.   Honestly, I came home and missed 'my new bed'!

The bathroom is a bit unique - but having traveled in Europe and South America, the one open room for shower, sink and toilet was not a surprise.   Just took a bit more planning and a bit of wipe up after the shower.

The rain on the skylights was soothing.   The cruiser bikes were fun to ride several miles towards UW.  A little tricky to get the bikes out to the street through the path and narrow steps, but worth it!  Lots of great Seattle water action along the bike path ride.  Vibrant city!

The location is wonderful for exploring Fremont by foot or bike.  Easy to go a few blocks to everything.  Flying Apron Bakery and Cafe's vegan & gluten free pastries and savory soups, lasagna, etc. is incredible!   The Sunday market was fun.   Coffee shops welcome and you can linger for hours.  The general location is central to everything Seattle,  Discovery Park not far, the Ballard Locks, Woodland Park, Ballard district, Greenlake, UW, downtown...all an easy drive without freeway if desired.  

As our daughter lives nearby in Ballard, we'll be making this our Seattle nest many times as the years go by.  

Thanks Nan!"
609701,22754892,2014-11-13,17533046,Arthur,"We really enjoyed our time in Nan's cottage. The cozy cottage was exactly as pictured. Welcoming and charming. Nan provided a variety of maps of  metro Seattle and more.
Parking was easy and location is perfect, close to restaurants and coffee shops.
The bed is very comfortable :) we absolutely recommend her place to anyone! 
Can't wait to come back to her cozy place again.
Thank you very much Nan!"
609701,22843406,2014-11-16,8292204,Angeli,"The coziest and most charming Airbnb place I've ever stayed. I never met Nan in person, but I didn't need to meet her in person to know what an exceptional host she was. She thought of everything to make me and my friend feel so comfortable during our stay. She has gone above and beyond! 

The location is in a quiet part of Seattle but still very accessible. The bus line to go to/from downtown Seattle is just a short walking distance. Also walking distance are low key restaurants, a coffee shop, gas station and a trail that is good for a leisurely walk/jog/bike ride. Overall, a wonderful stay and would not hesitate to book Nan's place again if I'm back in Seattle. "
609701,23321831,2014-11-29,13205223,Emily,"Nan was a great host - her communication before, during and after was excellent, she had the place beautifully prepped and cleanly kept. It was small but cozy, perfect for 1 person. Lots of charm in/around the property, and a convenient location. Thank You!!"
609701,23577141,2014-12-05,664340,Matthew,"My girlfriend and I really enjoyed our stay at Nan's cottage. The cottage itself is warm and well adorned--a very comfortable space to come back to after a long day of seeing the sights. The bed is as comfortable as advertised.  

We loved the area as well and found plenty to do in Fremont. Downtown was only a quick bus ride away. 

I highly recommend staying at Nan's cottage. "
609701,24061779,2014-12-18,18614722,Laura,"Staying at the cottage was great. I was in town for business and the location was perfect, the size of the cottage was just what I needed, and it was much more enjoyable and relaxing than a hotel. Nan has a gift of hospitality, so it adds that little something extra to the space. The only difficult part is parking…but it's to be expected in a large city. I'll be staying here again. "
609701,24115243,2014-12-20,11986587,Maria,"I truly recommend this beautiful cottage. A lovely and cozy place to come back to after exploring Seattle. Waking up to the rain at Nan's  place beats any hotel room.  Very accessible.  I didn't get to meet Nan but, she makes sure you have a cozy bed, a cup of tea. (Loved the tea station) the decoration  is so adorable. I would love to come back."
609701,24598180,2014-12-31,22218006,Drew,"Nan made us feel very welcome by having the cottage decorated with hand made signs of our names, and she left us some local sweets and coffees to give us a taste of Fremont. The listing was very accurate and was what we expected and had hoped for. The neighborhood was very quiet and is walking/ biking distance to many things that we wanted to do."
609701,25017224,2015-01-05,1537939,Mary,"We stayed at Nan's Fremont Garden Cottage for a week and had a wonderful time. The cottage is just as listed, small & cozy with all of the amenities needed for a comfortable stay. With private access through the side yard, we could come and go at all hours without disturbing Nan or her husband. We would definitely stay there again as it is very quiet, convenient to the area of Seattle we visit most, the UW area, but also has excellent access to downtown via US99/Aurora Ave. We really enjoyed getting to know the Wallingford, Fremont and Ballard areas better and found many great breakfast and dining spots. "
609701,25407313,2015-01-15,23508693,Karli,The room was cozy and adorable and Nan left everything we could need there for us from toilet paper to conditioner to instant coffee. The bed was comfortable and the pets were friendly and so was Nan for the brief interaction we had! It was a wonderful trip as I would absolutely love to stay here again!
609701,25571142,2015-01-19,25868230,Peter,"Awesome place, awesome location. Nan was very friendly and welcoming."
609701,25635302,2015-01-21,271104,Andrew,Great neighborhood location and cozy space with a functional kitchen. Nan was very helpful throughout. 
609701,25760127,2015-01-25,25863326,Linette,"Most adorable cozy garden cottage in a quiet neighborhood, but within walking distance to many restaurants & stores. 
Nan welcomed us with a charming little sign (and spelled my name correct), as well as a wonderful selection of teas, coffee's and little treats.
We did not get to meet her in person, but she was very friendly in conversations and she made us feel welcome. We had a wonderful stay and would recommend Nan's garden cottage to anyone. 
"
609701,26022119,2015-02-01,14973077,James,"We absolutely loved our stay in Nan's cottage! The space is exactly as described, cozy, clean, and welcoming. The bed was super comfy and we loved the soothing 'fire' in the fireplace! The location is perfect and very walkable to food/ drink in downtown Fremont. Nan was very responsive and we had no trouble communicating at all. I would highly recommend this space to anyone looking for a perfect weekend getaway in Seattle. We plan on coming back this Summer! Thanks again, Nan!!"
609701,26187087,2015-02-06,26215715,Magda,"Nan's place was so magical. From the beautiful garden to the welcome sign outside and so many other little details...coffee and tea, snacks and well stocked toiletries just in case you forgot anything. There were also maps for nearby areas in the great history book on the area Fremont where her place is located. Super clean and quaint with a comfy warm bed looking up to skylights. Everything you need and more to feel right at home. I hope to come back next time I'm in Seattle! "
609701,26241746,2015-02-08,16885133,Diane,"Lovely little place in a great part of town.  The room was small but very cozy.  Nan left me nice extras like tea, oatmeal and even beer in the fridge.  Comfy bed, good shower, lots of dishes and cooking implements for whipping up a meal.  Nan was friendly but not intrusive at all.   A wonderful place for a quiet getaway."
609701,26439997,2015-02-12,27440110,Dave,"My first experience with Air BNB, it was a great place to stay, very nice and cozy and clean, quiet neighborhood and very close to my daughter's house, Nan was a great host, had a welcome sign out for us even though it was almost midnight when we arrived, my granddaughter came over, we made Valentines for her pre-school class and had fun exploring the yard and the bunny"
609701,26525481,2015-02-15,25245709,Rebecca,"Nan has truly created a magically cozy cottage. All of the reviews for her & the cottage were spot on. Comfy, cozy, bed like a cloud, dreamy garden, friendly puppy, precious bunny & Nan is warm, welcoming & helpful without being intrusive. I highly recommend staying here as it also rests on a street nestled within the vibrant Fremont neighborhood. I had a wonderful & relaxing time basing myself at the cottage after long days of seeing all of the sights Seattle has to offer. I am already planning my next visit. Thank you, Nan!!
"
609701,26772563,2015-02-19,20947293,Rebecca,"This cottage was the perfect place to wind down with my daughter each evening after three fun-filled days in Seattle. Nan went above and beyond getting us excited about our trip and provided great tips for things to do (MUST go on the Theo Chocolate factory tour in Fremont!), transportation (which was amazingly convenient), and Thai take-out that delivers to the Cozy Cottage when we arrived Sunday night after an exhausting day of travel. I highly  recommend this great place in a great location!!"
609701,27054712,2015-02-24,4057242,Suzanne,"My husband and I had a lovely stay at Nan's cottage. It's in a great location with easy access to our friends Fremont and Ballard. The cottage was adorable and had everything we wanted: privacy, quiet, a kitchenette and a comfy bed. The bathroom is a Euro style all in one, which takes a little getting used to, but not an issue for us. We loved the fully stocked coffee and tea supplies, which was really nice to come home to after a chilly night out. We were happy to meet Nan as we were feeding the resident bunny, Delphine! We'll be back. Thanks Nan for sharing this space! "
609701,27349166,2015-03-02,10624129,Katie,"My boyfriend and really enjoyed our time at Nan's cozy cottage! It reinforced why we prefer AirB&B over hotels - we really felt like we were at home during a busy travel weekend. It's a very charming place to stay, exactly as it is described, complete with comfy bed and fireplace. I also really liked the backyard garden it is situated in. The location is great too. We had a car, which was no trouble to park on the street outside, but you could easily walk to Ballard and Fremont from the cottage. Nan was an excellent host - prompt communication throughout. I would highly recommend it! "
609701,27431132,2015-03-04,26581277,Nate,The host was very thorough and went over the top to make us feel welcome. The neighborhood was our favorite part of Seattle!
609701,27658059,2015-03-09,1126594,Betsy,"We enjoyed our stay very much. The cottage is truly cozy and comfortable, with supplies of everything you might need way beyond the usual. It is very private and safe, in a beautiful garden setting. And the Fremont location is convenient to the major roads and public transportation, but still in a quiet location. We also enjoyed the easy walk to all the restaurants and shops in Fremont.  "
609701,27926906,2015-03-15,11234256,Elizabeth,Beautiful little cottage in a wonderful back yard setting in between Fremont and Ballard.  Nan was very friendly and welcoming.  The cottage is within walking distance of several restaurants.

We found the bus to be very convenient and had no problem getting around with public transportation. We loved being able to use the bikes that Nan has! Nan was so helpful and always friendly to run into. Couldn't have asked for a better place or host! 
609701,28393595,2015-03-23,1928915,Vita,I had a wonderful stay at Nan and Marc's cottage.  They are wonderful hosts thank you 
609701,28544893,2015-03-25,6041867,Robert,"Nan was such a lovely host! Very cozy cottage- nice and warm with everything I needed.

609701,28694145,2015-03-29,8400840,Emma,"My boyfriend and I stayed here on a vacation and we were so happy, we loved the cottage! The neighborhood was cute and quiet but also a short walk from shops, restaurants, etc. in Fremont and Ballard. The cottage was very comfortable and everything was as described in the listing. Nan was so welcoming and even left lots of snacks, drinks and extra toiletries.  This is a fantastic place to stay, we would recommend it to anyone! "
609701,29278314,2015-04-06,27762283,Xiaojiao,这是我第一次使用airbnb，没想到就如此的惊艳，nan的小院真的很别致，非常适合1-2个人住，并且位于西雅图最有艺术气息的fremont区，周末还可以去逛周日市集，很方便，门口有直通派克市场的40路公车，总之一切都是那么美好。有机会一定会再去。
609701,29917051,2015-04-14,27851127,Maggie,The cottage was so cute and comfortable. It also was perfect for my husband and I to stay at because it was right around the corner from our son and daughter in laws house making our visit perfect. Nan goes the extra mile to make you welcomed. She made it so simple for us to extend our stay an extra day. We enjoyed the teas and chocolate especially! What a secret treasure we have found. We will definitely return.....very soon!
609701,30451167,2015-04-22,24984415,Caitlyn,"The cottage was cozy and comfortable, and well-stocked with anything we could ever have needed for our week-long stay in Seattle! Plenty of toiletries, snacks, coffee, etc. The surrounding garden was beautiful as well. Nan was a wonderful host - very kind and communicative throughout the entire process, and we enjoyed meeting her briefly in the garden on our last full day there. The location was excellent - a short walk to buses downtown (and anywhere else in the city) and easy access to a bike path along the bay and lake union. Would highly recommend staying here!"
609701,30669803,2015-04-26,3707387,Troy,We LOVE our time with Nan and the Cottage....such a fantastic place to stay.  Much Gracias!

609701,31533149,2015-05-06,30901886,Meliz,"It was the perfect cottage for our visit to Seattle! Every detail about the space was beautiful, from the cozy feel to its perfect location. It had everything we needed. The sky lights in the house brought in plenty of natural light and allowed us to wake up with the sun every morning. We could not have asked for a better place to stay during our visit!"
609701,31765876,2015-05-10,26745624,Ina,"We had a wonderful time at Nan's cozy garden cottage! It was the perfect hideaway after long sightseeing tours in and around Seattle, and exhausting conference sessions at Washington University. Nan embraced us with loads of positive energy and love through small gestures as goodies and refreshments which made us feel like home. Our first visit to Seattle was amazing also, thanks to you Nan! We truly hope to stay in touch! Warm wishes your way from the Californian coast!"
609701,32243261,2015-05-16,1493250,Lisa,"Our stay in Nan's cozy cottage was absolutely perfect! The walk up to the cottage is a special treat - a beautiful garden with an adorable bunny and kitten, and a welcome sign just for us. Nan is a wonderful host, and the cottage was quiet, comfortable, and equipped with just about anything one could possibly need. The location couldn't have been better - just a few blocks from all the great shops/pubs/restaurants of N 36th Street, and a quick bus ride to downtown. We would definitely recommend Nan's cottage to anyone visiting Seattle!"
609701,32469810,2015-05-18,20316930,Elizabeth,Nan was very welcoming and met us in person when we arrived. The cottage was very cute- exactly what the pictures show except more adorable. I would return to her cottage.

609701,33061501,2015-05-25,16712683,Heather,"Cottage was perfect! Tucked away, but steps from the bus and Gilman-Burke bike trail. I had contacted Nan about secure storage for my rental bike, and when I arrived there was a Seattle bike guide (and a Theo's chocolate bar!) waiting for me. Very thoughtful touches throughout the cottage: tea, cocoa, coffee, and snacks in the kitchenette. Extra toiletries in the bathroom. An umbrella and lots of hooks to store your clothing. Bus passes and neighborhood and city guides. A flashlight by the door. Super comfortable bed with skylight. Truly a home away from home."
609701,33982201,2015-06-03,27807317,Robin,"A cozy home away from home with many pluses - treats, soft fluffy towels, close to public transportation and very accommodating hosts. 

The Cozy Cloud Cottage served all our needs during our visit to Seattle.

Thank you Nan and Mark"
609701,34139077,2015-06-05,2813906,Kyle,"The Charming Fremont Garden Cottage was a fantastic place to stay. It was cozy, relaxing, accommodating, and centrally located within the Fremont  District. Nan was a great host and took care to make us feel welcome in this little abode. 

The little cottage was much more wonderful in person and very functional. Being able to make a few meals helps the budget traveler and the collection of maps and guides helped us find our way to the best local spots.

All around, a great place to stay!"
609701,35204091,2015-06-16,8753679,Bee,"Brilliant little home for our stay in Seattle, would thoroughly recommend!"
609701,35448623,2015-06-19,5906166,Joan,"Great communication from Nan.  From the time we walked thru the forest to the enchanted little cottage we loved the experience.  A wonderful welcome with our name on a chalkboard by the front door.  The cottage was exactly what we wanted and we had a wonderful time.  The neighborhood is walkable and enjoyable.  Loved the bunny, kitty, and dogs that welcomed us also.  Great hosts.... great cottage.... we will definitely be returning when we visit Seattle.  "
609701,35901835,2015-06-23,23420467,Amber,"This is one cool place in the heart of it all!  The cottage was clean and beautifully decorated, complete with an electric fireplace.  We were fortunate to book this cottage during the annual Solstice Festival and could actually walk to the event.  The bed was so very comfortable!  Our hosts were accommodating and we did not even see them unless we wanted to.  "
609701,36503709,2015-06-29,24977851,Courtney,"I couldn't have asked for a better stay in Seattle. The bed was so comfy, and the kitchen is equipped with everything you could possibly need. The cottage is in a well-shaded backyard, but the bay window, garden windows and skylights let in the sunshine. The welcome sign, plenty of Earl Grey tea, and a friendly kitty made it feel like home. There's easy access to a bus that takes you right to downtown Seattle, but there's also plenty to explore in the Fremont area, including a great Sunday market. I can't recommend this place enough and hope to stay again some day! "
609701,36774153,2015-07-01,31376357,Catherine,"This lovely cozy cottage is exactly like the photos and description -very charming, densely planted shade garden, very private, clean and comfortable. I felt safe and secure. I was alone and felt safe enough to keep the windows open on an unusually (for Seattle) hot summer night. The resident family, including the biggest bunny rabbit I have ever seen, were warm and welcoming. Thank you, Nan!"
609701,36948271,2015-07-03,211843,Elizabeth,"Nan's cottage—nestled in what felt like a secret garden—was a wonderful place to stay.

Nan really made us feel welcomed, thank you!
/Karolina & Marcus"
609701,38385980,2015-07-15,467005,Rose,"This cottage is certainly ""charming"" as described!  Nan's backyard is a little wonderland with lush vegetative, a welcoming rabbit, Delphine, a  precious playhouse with cruiser bikes inside, and the cottage that you'll stay it.  They accommodations were very comfortable and had all the amenities we needed including a functional kitchenette, small, but clean bathroom, and and a whimsically decorated bedroom with wifi, cable, and a comfy bed.  It's definitely best for just two, but could even be a nice ""staycation"" for someone in the city.  It was a welcome respit from our miles on the road and a great place to re-explore the city from.  You can easily walk to Fremont or grab a bus to Downtown, the U District, or Ballard.  Parking was also ample.  Nan and her family were great hosts and made us feel quite welcome.  I would highly recommend this listing and can't wait to return, myself!"
609701,38692162,2015-07-18,5014714,Shannon,"We absolutely loved Nan's place.  A great location and a perfect guest house.  My husband and I really enjoyed the comfortable bed, all the lovely extra touches (such as biscuits, tea and breakfast makings) and the incredible backyard.  Delphine the giant rabbit is quite the attraction herself and we enjoyed petting her and feeding her cereal treats.  
Nan was also incredibly friendly, providing free bus passes and sharing with us stories about her home and menagerie of friendly animals.  She made us feel very welcome and we have already recommended her place to various friends visiting the area."
609701,39157027,2015-07-21,31689940,Theresa,"Thank you Nan for the welcome board! Your cottage is the perfect rest and relax getaway. 
The location is excellent, easily walkable to cafes, restaurants, supermarket, shopping, salons...bus route...
Check in and check out - super convenient.
Cottage is neat, clean, thoughtfully arranged and super welcoming.

609701,39483819,2015-07-24,30797640,Rob And Gretchen,Nan and Mark made us feel very welcome with great communication and instructions to check-in easily. They made access simple amid our jumbled vacation scheduling. Their hospitality was evident in every detail. The cottage was exactly like the listing--darling and inviting. 
609701,39862191,2015-07-26,15347518,Christian,"The cottage is even better that it looks in the picture! It´s very clean, great located and it has everything you need(sink, stove, TV, fridge, maps, books)! The place is very cozy, and the area is very calm.  We arrive at midnight and Nan was very aware of the communication to be able to arrive at anytime without any problem. Free Bus tickets and bikes were available but we needed to use our car. She also recommend us a very close place near the house to have a great coffe and chai for my wife, including tips to avoid traffic and ferry to take. His husband Mark was very kind as well and say good bye before leaving the cottage. I definely recommend Nan´s cottage and stay again as many times as possible!"
609701,40434201,2015-07-31,2993539,Joelle,"We loved our time at Nan's cottage! We were welcomed warmly by Nan's husband, a bunny, a few cats and a sign with our names on it. Nan provided us with all we needed and more, including coffee, bus passes and bikes! We loved the neighborhood of Fremont and enjoyed coffee and two dinners there. We used the bikes and the bus passes to travel all around Seattle. Thanks for a wonderful time!
"
609701,41186508,2015-08-05,5683977,Amanda,"I arrived very late in the evening after a long drive from California but Nan greeted me and even helped me with my luggage.  This is in a nice neighborhood on a steep hill.  It is very close to the Fremont neighborhood, very hip and cool with a great PCC Market (Upscale Organic Coop) within walking distance along the canal.  A couple of breakfast restaurants to choose from, again in walking distance.  Busses pass close by and go to downtown Seattle or Ballard.  Good access.  We parked the car on the street and walked or bussed most places.  Kitchen was great to have as we stayed 5 nights and cooked several meals 'at home'.  Bathroom was a European style with open shower.  Actually, I found I really liked this as the floor stayed clean.  Bring shower sandals though for walking on the wet floor after.  This does drain and dry fast in the summer when we were there.  Tons of amenities were stocked throughout, even new toothbrushes.  My fiancee and I loved the privacy as the cottage is on the back of the property.  The path is uneven and because of the steep hill on the street, this location is not easy to access for anyone physically challenged.  Also, pack suitcases lighter since there are a few steps to navigate.  There are outdoor chairs to relax in the morning over tea or coffee.  All in all, a wonderful find at a super price!   "
609701,41720971,2015-08-09,5060610,Cristina,"Everything was as described, even better!"
609701,42394670,2015-08-13,3274628,Colleen,The cottage was perfect! Great location and excellent host. Loved being able to borrow the cruisers since the cottage is so close to the bike trails. Short ride up to marina to go kayaking. Close to transit to easy to get anywhere in Seattle. Nan was a great host. 
609701,43209610,2015-08-18,25631310,Mary,"What a wonderful place to call home during my first AirBnB experience and Seattle visit!  This cottage couldn't have been any more charming.  It had everything I needed for my solo birthday trip - having a bicycle to use was a welcome bonus.  Nan was unobtrusive, we did meet once briefly but otherwise I had peace and quiet, though I know she would have been easily available had I needed anything.  All the little touches made the difference - the welcome sign, the snacks, the bus passes, the tourist info.   Highly recommend to anyone considering a stay in the area.  If I'm ever lucky enough to return to Seattle, this will be my home again if I'm so lucky."
609701,43896928,2015-08-23,26525981,Lisa,"We so enjoyed our stay in Nan's charming Freemont cottage...I could have moved right in! It was a little backyard oasis in the city surrounded by lush vegetation, both peaceful and relaxing. We really made such good use of our stay there...we slept well, (the bed was great!) we sat out and dined in the garden and enjoyed the quiet. We even hosted our family for a wine and cheese snack on the upper terrace! The kitchen was well equipted, the bathroom too, everything was really perfect and we can't wait to return to Seattle to stay here again! Thanks so much for a lovely stay."
609701,44763940,2015-08-29,34470697,Phyllis,"We were very pleased with our stay at Nan's charming Fremont cottage. The small cottage is perfect for a couple, it is private, peaceful and well equipped. There were many thoughtful, welcoming touches. We would definitely come here again and recommend it to others."
609701,45165363,2015-08-31,24868940,Mary,"Our stay at Nan's cottage was great. She made the place very cozy and she thought of everything that would make our stay comfortable. We enjoyed the bunny in the garden as well as the shortbread cookies she left for us. If I travel back to Seattle, I would definitely stay at Nan's cottage again. Very charming neighborhood and very local to everything we wanted to see and do. "
609701,45493260,2015-09-03,40593303,Margaret,This was my first time using Airbnb and I was pleasantly surprised at the results.   Nan's cottage was exactly as she described.  It was very quaint and cozy.   I also loved the fact that it was very conveniently located to public transportation.   I will definitely stay here again next time I visit Seattle.   Thanks for a wonderful stay!
609701,46114503,2015-09-08,5136527,John,"This was a perfect place for my mother in-law. She stayed here for our wedding weekend and couldn't have said nicer things about the accommodations. 
Thanks for giving her such a wonderful place to stay."
609701,47036601,2015-09-15,22534960,Karen,"The cottage was absolutely perfect. I couldn't have asked for a better location. It was quiet, charming, and just the right size. I really liked the bathroom - it was my first time trying one of this type so I wasn't used to it at first, but I grew to prefer it - I think it optimizes the space perfectly. Nan and Mark were both extremely kind in our limited interactions, and I loved seeing their rabbit and cat every day on my way out. I would (and have already) recommended this cottage to friends of mine and would gladly stay here again myself.   "
609701,47353582,2015-09-18,34141793,Shelly,Beautiful cottage! Everything was clean and stocked with anything you may need. Its in a great spot next to a gas station and lots of restraunts. Delphine (rabbit) is ADORABLE! Just an overall wonderful experience! 
609701,47608159,2015-09-21,15805470,Mitch,Great little place.  Beautiful garden setting.  Nan thought of everything - even a food items to snack on.  Made us very independent - we really didn't need Nan for anything.  Friendly rabbit also.
609701,50012211,2015-10-08,44369288,Sarah,"This was a great place to stay while I was in Seattle. I was nervous at first that it was far from the main attractions in Seattle, but that made it even better. It was easy to get to and from downtown and was a great oasis to escape to after a long day of touring around. Fremont was a place I probably wouldn't have seen if I didn't stay there, and it was a great spot with bike/walking trails, little shops, and great people. The cottage was exactly how Nan had described it, cozy, relaxing, clean, I was really able to feel at home here. If I'm ever lucky enough to make it back to Seattle, I will definitely stay here again! Thanks Nan!"
609701,50164442,2015-10-10,33574549,Marleen,"The little charming cottage was really cute! Although space is scarce, really everything I needed was there and lots more. The garden is amazing, full of green and let me remember my mother in law. I felt at home at once."
609701,50450652,2015-10-12,10972442,Kelly,Nan and Mark were awesome hosts and made our stay extremely comfortable! My boyfriend and I enjoyed every moment we were in Seattle! The cottage was just as described and the place is in a very convenient (email hidden)ose to cool areas of the city. Highly recommended place to stay at for anyone! Would definitely stay here again! 
609701,50850449,2015-10-15,25477710,Caroline,"We had a wonderful time staying at the cottage. Nan was very welcoming and gave us great recommendations for what to do in the area as well well as bus passes to make travel that much easier! We road bikes to Gas Works Park and tried some great restaurants in the Fremont and Ballard area, also went downtown, road the ferry, it was a very fun visit. Coming back to the cottage after a day of site seeing was so relaxing. Also, we love Nan's animals, they made the stay even more pleasant! Thanks Nan!"
609701,51602977,2015-10-22,28990577,Sean,The perfect little cottage in the perfect little garden. I think my favorite is the sound of rain on the skylight over the bed.
609701,52427294,2015-10-29,291746,Katie,"Staying in Nan's Garden Cottage was a wonderful experience, and made our visit to Seattle so easy and relaxing. Although we did not have the pleasure of meeting Nan in person, her presence was felt in every thoughtful detail. We would certainly stay her again, and are already planning our next trip back!"
609701,52832243,2015-11-02,6616748,Margaret,Everything was great!  Nan left us a little personalized message on the door and it was easy to check in.  The neighborhood is great and all the fun stuff in Fremont is easily walkable.  
609701,54247045,2015-11-17,24696745,Alexander,"We enjoyed our stay in the cosycottage! It was easy to find and everything was set up for our late arrival. 

The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen had everything we needed. The bathroom/wet room had a great shower and was stocked with toiletries. We were warm and cosy in our hideaway while it was wet and windy in the rest of Seattle, but on the one day of sunshine, we appreciated the chance to borrow the bikes to explore the city. 

Nan was very friendly and made us feel welcome. We'd recommend the cottage to anyone."
609701,55804012,2015-12-06,40994658,Mindi,Great location! It was just a short walk to many bars and restaurants and a less than 15$ Uber ride to the heart of downtown. Cozy little cottage for sure!
609701,58010331,2015-12-31,30943977,Jing,The cozy cottage made our winter trip to Seattle relaxing. We really liked the Fremont neighborhood! Thanks Nan.
4270642,21494235,2014-10-18,22452497,Michael,"I stayed in this studio for 3 nights.  The description is accurate.  It is really close to UW's campus, and there are a lot of food options around.  It is also easy to go to downtown Seattle, as there are many bus stops nearby.  To/From the airport it takes about an hour.

Here are the things I liked about it:
- good water pressure
- instant hot water in the shower/sink
- clean when I arrived
- location (campus, food places)
- fast WiFi
- good instructions and communication from/with the host
- host checked in with me before I left

The only negative things:
- noise travels very well in the building (although most of the time it was quiet)
- as it is mentioned in the description, there is a shared door with the adjacent studio: there is a large gap in between the door and the floor, so you'll hear conversations/music... anything that is going on, so also be aware of your own private conversations etc.
- I found the mat in the bathroom not very inviting, use a towel instead

All in all I had a good impression of the place.  Melissa is very responsive and communicating with her is very easy.  This combination of location, quality of the place and price is hard to find!"
4270642,23066767,2014-11-22,15581298,Luiz,"The host was nice, and the room was as described (and pictured).  The location was fantastic, just 2 blocks from the UW campus, and right in the middle of a lot of restaurants and things to do.  The perfect place if you are visiting the university, like I was doing.  It is a very simple room, but I didn't need much, so it was great.  Very clean.  2 downsides, though.  The first problem was that the room is connected to the adjacent room by a door, and has a opening of about 1/2 in below it.  That means that sounds travel very easily between the 2 rooms, which can be annoying for you and your neighbor.  The second problem is that this is a first floor room with some traffic on the street - your window opens right to the people walking by, so if you like privacy, you will have to keep the windows always shut, which is unfortunate."
4270642,26222158,2015-02-07,10289076,Nima,This place is very close to UW which was very important to me. It was clean and comfy and had everything I needed for my stay. Getting in was a breeze since Melissa had already prepared everything. The one downside to the place is that the doors (one to the hallway and one that goes to an adjacent studio) do not isolate noise properly. That wasn't a big concern for me though.
4270642,27890821,2015-03-14,15581298,Luiz,"I ended up changing rooms upon arrival, so I cannot review this specific room.  However, I can still review the building and host.  The host is very polite, nice, attentive to guests, and is open to feedback - she took a couple of suggestion that me and another guest made to improve the room, regarding sound and privacy.  Another good example is that other people had asked if they could stay in adjacent rooms, which in this case included the room I had reserved.  So before I even arrived, she asked if it would be ok to move me to a bigger, nicer room for no extra charge, which of course I accepted (and the room was indeed great).  The rooms are simple, but spacious and comfortable.  The location of the building is excellent if you have any business in the university, and there are tons of great restaurants around.  This is the second time I stay at this place and it's really good, I highly recommend the place and the host."
4270642,28564274,2015-03-26,27740713,Adam,"Melissa was an excellent host. I would have no reservations staying with her again. I visited UW while staying there and found it to be about a 15 minute walk from the Quad, quite convenient. Also right around the corner from stops for multiple bus lines which were incredibly useful! I'd recommend buying an ORCA card to make it simple to get on and off buses. "
4270642,28925242,2015-04-01,19844856,Nobuko,"I stayed in Melissa's studio for one week while attending a conference in March. Melissa was very easy to reach by text message if I needed anything throughout my stay. The studio was very clean, and located in an incredibly convenient part of town. There were a lot of good restaurants within walking distance. Heating system works well when I need it.

The only negatives were that no plug for the bus tub, and not much kitchen tool. 

Overall, I would stay here again due to the convenience and location."
4270642,30937928,2015-04-29,7116689,Amy,"A great experience overall.  The location of the apartment couldn't be better and the apartment itself was cozy, clean, and quiet.  For one person this unit is a great deal."
4270642,31935483,2015-05-12,22642486,Michiru,"The host was very efficient and we didn't have to meet to arrange a check-in. While that can be a bad thing for some travellers, I knew that I was not staying at someone's private house so no problem. The neighborhood is a very lively student area."
4270642,32213997,2015-05-15,3965840,Bryan,"Pretty much just what you want from an Airbnb rental, especially if you have appointments in the U-District and are traveling by yourself. The highlights of this unit are the bathroom and kitchenette. I had lots of privacy and the building's other tenants were perfectly quiet during my stay."
4270642,33178549,2015-05-25,33460242,Sam,"I had a very positive experience renting Melissa's studio. The apartment was clean and located conveniently to a number of buses. I was generally only there to sleep and shower, and it worked well for those purposes. 

I generally had an easy time accessing the apartment and Melissa was easy to reach when I first checked in. Hot water worked and everything was generally very comfortable. As others mentioned, the apartment is street-level but I didn't have any issues with noise or anything.

Fair price compared to the cost of a local hotel and convenient. Would definitely recommend."
4270642,48124841,2015-09-23,43893080,Nancy,"Melissa and her husband were very friendly, respectful, polite and welcoming. The neighbourhood was safe, quite, clean and at a walking distance from the University of Washington and the University Way where we found several good restaurants, a health clinic, banks, and a dollar store. Besides,  on Brooklyn Avenue, we found two gas stations and a Safeway Supermarket. We couldn't ask for more. It was perfect for us. "
4270642,51745699,2015-10-24,40997706,Nick,It was fine and functional.  Good for short term stay.
9414303,55284744,2015-11-29,18901320,Clarke,This was a perfect little hideout in the Capitol Hill area in Seattle. Easy access and perfect for 1 to 2 people looking for a simple yet well-arranged place to crash for a few days while in Seattle.
4104442,20403110,2014-09-28,10665651,Alistair,"Hosts like Arnaud give Airbnb the best reputation. Extremely welcoming and an exceptionally nice place to stay. I'd recommend this to anyone that is after a clean, private and warm stay. Thanks!"
4104442,20808093,2014-10-05,397278,Alex,"I absolutely loved staying at this property! The location is ideal, the house is beautiful, and the room is fantastic. The house is just a few blocks from beautiful greenlake where I went for a run in the morning. The host Arnaud is one of the friendliest and most interesting people that I have met. Highly recommended in all aspects!!"
4104442,24414093,2014-12-28,4613074,Ingrid,"We came to Seattle over Christmas to be with our daughter and family who had just had a new baby. Their house was too small for all of us and Arnaud's place was within walking distance of their house, the zoo and nice cafes and shops. It was the perfect location for us. Our room had it's own on suite bathroom with a nice shower and a big closet. The bed was most comfortable. I don't think we could have asked for anything more.

Unfortunately Arnaud was away in France during the time of our stay so we didn't get to meet him. However he made sure that we were very welcome in his lovely home. We even had our Christmas Eve dinner around his kitchen table with our daughter's family. We stayed for a week and will be coming back again in 2015 for another few days, hopefully this time we will also meet our host! 

I would highly recommend Arnaud's place for an airbnb stay. It's a lovely home in a beautiful part of Seattle with easy access to local shops and cafes and a short bus ride to town. "
4104442,25212926,2015-01-09,4613074,Ingrid,"After a lovely stay in Arnaud's townhouse over Christmas we came back again for a few more days in the New Year. I guess that the fact that we wanted to return says it all - it's a great place, great location and great value.

We got to meet Arnaud briefly this time. It would have been nice to have spent more time getting to know him, but we both had busy schedules. He made sure that we had what we needed though and we felt very much at home. "
4104442,28768641,2015-03-29,30027896,Xuanyu,The house is very good. My friend and I enjoy the games in the x-box very much! Thank you!
4104442,32401805,2015-05-17,2128823,Rachel,We couldn't have asked for a nicer stay. Arnaud's place is perfectly cosy and we felt right at home. The best thing we enjoyed was the complimentary Netflix and Nespresso coffee! There is a delicious variety of restaurants within walking distance and its an easy 15 minute uber ride into town. Lastly I would like to mention how reassuring it was to know that Arnaud was just a message away. His communication was excellent and we would love to stay again if we get the chance! 
4104442,33806992,2015-06-01,31539483,Mélanie,"Arnaud's place is really nice, very clean and super comfortable ! We really enjoyed our stay. The room was perfectly cosy, and sunny, with the balcony it was pleasant. Arnaud gave us some good ideas about what doing in the city, answered our messages right away anytime we had a question.  It's very easy to go downtown with the 5 bus, and the neighborhood is quiet, with a lot of small restaurants, and a wonderful bakery (fresh flour) !! 
Thanks Arnaud !"
4104442,36174297,2015-06-26,19099312,Jim,Arnaud was most gracious and he was there when we arrived late in the day.  His Townhouse is exactly as pictured and described. Please be aware that there is no air conditioning and note that most of Seattle places do not have it.  For the short amount of days that are hot it is not worth having it.
4104442,41322370,2015-08-07,9293999,Alex-Andre,"Arnaud is one of the friendliest, most accommodating people I have ever met. He was kind enough to show me around and make me feel very welcome in his home. His home is excellent: clean, organized and very comfortable. The room was very comfortable and its ensuite bathroom gives guest a great amount of privacy. The house isn't far from restaurants, the downtown bus and a local supermarket. I would highly recommend Arnaud for his genuine nature, excellent accommodation and friendship."
4104442,45581306,2015-09-04,26068381,Amanda,"Arnaud was a super sweet, kind, and accommodating host. His place is lovely, modern, and very clean. The neighborhood is quiet and charming which was great for us because we had a car which allowed easy access to the whole city. I would definitely recommend staying here."
4104442,46292426,2015-09-09,39706394,Winnie,"Our stay with Arnaud was a really great experience! Arnaud is extremely warm and welcoming and super accessible through text. He was accommodating with our check-in and check-out times and generously offered up all the amenities in his home, from the coffee maker to his Netflix account to using his office as a second bedroom.

The townhouse itself is very modern, clean and cozy. It looks exactly like the pictures posted. All the neighbors we came across seemed really nice and friendly as well. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful, great for running, exploring little shops, and just a short distance away from downtown either by bus or by car. 

We would definitely think about staying here again on our next trip to Seattle!"
4104442,47357510,2015-09-18,38294670,Katharine,"Thank you, Arnaud, for being such a gracious host. We were very comforrable with the room and proximity to our daughters 's condo. Your office area was perfect to work online. We were able to do laundry and keep breakfast food in the fridge. 
We will come again"
4104442,49053577,2015-09-30,8491538,Anna,"The apartment is immaculate and in a great neighborhood.   It was super convenient to travel downtown with the bus, with a stop just one block away.  The nearby parks are also a gem. Arnaud was very friendly and helpful.  "
3686556,16957906,2014-08-04,7994582,Parveen,This place was excellent. It was clean and comfortable. It was close to Seattle Centre and Belltown.
3686556,17179905,2014-08-08,8554750,Ron,"Place was fantastic. Couldn't ask for anything better and Meg was very accommodating. 
Also, there's a 24 Hr Fitness right across the street if you're a member - that was really nice. 
The apartment is blocks from the space needle and science center and to get downtown or anywhere cool it's a quick bus ride that picks up on the street you're staying which was super convenient. Just as a note, this apartment, along with most of Seattle I've learned, does not have AC but I was here on the hottest week of the year and still kept very cool with the windows open. The building is very new and the balcony has a beautiful view of all of Seattle and the needle. 
Highly recommended!"
3686556,17255694,2014-08-09,8013961,Chris,"This place is a great find, I will be back for sure I hope.  Meg is super easy to deal with, her place is really clean and nice and the bed is comfortable.  Just what an airbnb experience should be like."
3686556,18678250,2014-08-30,14981099,Steve,A great spot in a great city!  Awesome location and great hospitality. Meg is wonderful. Would stay here again in a second!
3686556,18763185,2014-08-31,20401511,Tina,Meg's was very helping and responsive when coordinating my stay at her place.  Everything was very clean and we felt comfortably at home.  Her place was the perfect location!  Blocks away from the Space Needle and some great restaurants in Queen Anne.  We were able to check out some cool speak-easy places and enjoy nice walk back to her place.  I'd definitely recommend staying here!
3686556,19040319,2014-09-05,19920883,Sean,"The apartment was lovely and just as depicted in the listing. The appliances in the kitchen were nice and new, the living room was comfortable and sunny, and the bathroom was very spacious. The floor plan was also neat - one big loop.

The location was within walking distances to the Seattle Center area, the piers, and much of Queen Anne. There were great places to eat nearby.

Meg was in communication throughout the stay. Gaining entrance to the apartment was easy and didn't require scheduling a meet up, which I appreciated. We didn't have any issues at all when we stayed, but I'm confident Meg would've been able to assist us if we had."
3686556,22502000,2014-11-08,981721,Anna,"Meg's place is amazing!  It is literally walking distance from Downtown and Pike Place Markets (less than 10 mins), 5 mins walk away from Belltown and Elliot Bay trail.  The Space Needle is really as close she says and so is Key Arena!  Plenty of restaurants, bars and cafes on the same street as the apartment to walk to and safe area to walk around at night.  There's also a gym close by, which was handy.

Meg's place is well-equipped with everything you need (the bullet blender came in very handy!)  Meg was an amazing host - she made us feel at home and helped us with any questions we had and was so accommodating.  We stayed for 4 weeks initially then extended our stay by a further 2 weeks because we loved it so much.

We seriously did not want to leave!"
3686556,22566659,2014-11-09,23166664,Kelly,We had a great stay at Meg's place.  The apartment was clean and comfortable.  Nice views of the city and even a view of the water. Meg was a pleasure to work with. Would definitely stay here again. 
3686556,29127888,2015-04-04,29559380,Anh-Tuan,"Meg's apartment is awesome !!!  Perfect size for 1-2 people, and the view is just fantastic.  The place is super clean and very cozy.  The location is perfect in relation to Pike's Market, downtown bars and restaurants and the water front.  Also within walking distance is the space needle and science museums.  A Trader Joe's is also very  close.   What you see in the picture listing is exactly how it is, but even better in person.  I felt like I was right at home.

Communication with Meg was very easy and she responds very quickly.  I would definitely stay again when I visit Seattle. "
3686556,32419099,2015-05-17,21317995,David,"Great location!  So close to City Center, Belltown and lots of bus lines. Nice apartment too. Meg was very helpful and accommodating, but the house had a couple unforeseen quirks - the building door key didn't work and the bedroom shade didn't completely close. Both will likely be fixed when you stay here. "
3686556,33470188,2015-05-28,33610195,Joseph,"The blinds were broken on the large bed side window. We communicated the issue to Meg on the first night. We stayed seven nights but the conditions didn't improve for us. We definitely lost sleep due to light coming through the window. 

Meg communicated efforts to help and was responsive to our messages throughout our stay. The apartment is in a great location, is clean, and equipped with modern, functional amenities. If it hadn't been for the window problem we would be extremely happy with our experience."
3686556,34708121,2015-06-11,8030199,Stephany,"Megan was really great about giving us ideas for dinner in the area. She was very quick to respond to anything we needed. The apartment is great! My fiancé actually proposed on her balcony :) the apartment is near a Safeway which is wonderful. Also not too far from downtown. About 1 mile to pike place, which we walked it. "
3686556,35096322,2015-06-15,79683,Kin,Meg and her place was awesome. She let us check-in early and greeted us as we got there. She checked in with a text later on to see if we needed anything.  Her apartment's location was walking distance to pretty much everything. Her place had everything we needed. There was even a wireless printer so we could print tickets off our phones. Would definitely recommend staying here.
3686556,35685644,2015-06-21,6205163,Quentin,"The place was great, clean and quite. I was there for business and everything was easy to access."
3686556,36332477,2015-06-27,26954158,Matt,"We had a fantastic time in Seattle and that was definitely due in large part to Meg, her amazing apartment and her wonderful hospitality.  

Her place is in a fantastic central location in Queen Anne, and she was extremely helpful and accommodating, both before and during the trip."
3686556,37064921,2015-07-04,17511175,Lara,Meg was great and really easy to get in touch with. Her apartment is lovely with a gorgeous view of the Space Needle from her balcony. And it was bigger than we expected!
3686556,44939390,2015-08-30,38970643,Rafael,Meg was a quick communicator which is key to making airbnb work. We had a blast in Seattle in due part thanks to staying in such a wonderful place. The apartment is very close to the Space needle and all of the museums which made it easy for us to see more things during our short vacation. The apartment was cozy and had literally everything necessary for our stay to go smoothly similar to staying in a hotel. The view from the bedroom and balcony was great as well. I would definitely recommend this place to any couple as me and my girlfriend had a blast!
3686556,46586512,2015-09-12,36351423,Laura,"This was our first Air B&B experience and it did not disappoint. Meg was awesome in letting us check in early. The apartment is great, extremely comfortable, very clean and beautifully decorated. It also has a very good location, super close to the Space Needle and walkable to all major points of interest. Had a little trouble with the WiFi the last few days but that's probably already taken care of. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone visiting Seattle! "
2481189,11035793,2014-03-17,2396938,Ed,"Clean, small bungalow - perfect for a couple with an extra child. Comfortable loft master. Easy to get to the city and cool neighborhoods. Parking a little tight. Coffee and press were appreciated! Easy in and out. "
2481189,11191791,2014-03-24,6698675,Chris,This was a wonderful experience. Peter is a wonderful host. He waited for us at the house to greet us and make sure any of our questions were answered. Their home is beautiful and spotless. The internet access was fast. The view from the upstairs room is beautiful as well. Linens and towels are of great quality. The location was perfect. We would absolutely like to stay here next time we are in Seattle. Highly recommend it. 
2481189,11969360,2014-04-20,1331859,Nicole,"Couldn't have enjoyed our time in Seattle more.  The apartment is very comfortable and clean.  There were five of us: two adults and three young children and we didn't feel crowded thanks to the second floor master suite, two bedrooms and full bath on main floor.  Really great fenced-in outdoor space and super convenient parking space.  Full-size laundry helped keep our luggage packing light and the baby/kid stuff helped keep the family happy (crib, high chair, stroller, toys).  Highly recommend!"
2481189,13424424,2014-05-27,9728550,Annabel,"Peter was prompt at replying and organising the stay was hassle free (bar some technical difficulties with the app!) 
The apartment was clean, good location and easy to get to and use for the weekend.
Thanks for letting us stay! 
One note: a kettle for tea would be great!!

2481189,13967939,2014-06-09,13573582,Stephane,"I was in Seattle for a two day workshop with 4 friends and we decided to try something new. We absolutely loved the accommodations here! The 5 of us were very comfortable and slept really well. The house was immaculate, the location was perfect. I have no complaints and highly recommend this house for groups visiting Seattle. Thanks Laura and Peter!"
2481189,14425711,2014-06-19,6248105,Frederick,"Laura and Peter's house was perfect; great location, great views from the upper deck and all features in the house was in excellent working condition.  The kitchen was was fully equipped.  Laura and Peter are outstanding hosts. "
2481189,15305042,2014-07-07,12881275,Lindsay,"Laura and Peter's home in Queen Anne was very cozy and cute.  We had 6 adults and two young kids (ages 3 and 1) in my group and the house had just enough space for us.  When I arrived for check in, I was told the number code to retrieve a key from the lock box.  For check out I simply returned the key to the box and had to be out before 11:00am.  All went very smoothly!

The location was great!  We were in town for a wedding and had to drive down to the Edgewater Hotel in downtown Seattle a couple times for wedding events.  We also easily drove to places like Kerry Park and The Space Needle.  The neighborhood was fairly quiet.

We found the house to be clean with soft sheets and warm blankets.  There were also plenty of towels for our group to use.  The towels were also high quality.  It was nice to have access to a full kitchen and a washing machine and dryer.  There's also wireless internet access in the house.  We had plenty of hot water for showers even with the size of our group.  We did stagger shower times or some showered at night versus the morning.

This was my first Airbnb experience and I was very happy with the experience.  Staying in a home can be more comfortable than a hotel!  Thank you Laura and Peter for promptly answering my questions through email and text before and during our stay.  Thank you for opening up your beautiful home to us!  We had a wonderful Seattle experience!"
2481189,15451518,2014-07-09,4308175,Harriet,"We communicated easily by email with our hosts. The house was immaculate. The neighborhood was wonderful. We crossed Dexter St., and caught a bus to downtown to visit the sites. We had a great time."
2481189,15748408,2014-07-15,13246339,Wendy,"We loved our stay at Peter and Laura's home! The highlights include: the outdoor space out front, toys and crib for our toddler son to use, the upstairs deck, comfortable beds, overall cleanliness, and charming atmosphere. 
The location was close to a lot of cool neighborhoods-Quuen Anne, SLU, Fremont, etc.-  and great restaurants. We always drove, mostly due to the hills on either side of the main road. We had two rental cars and were always able to find the extra space we needed on the same block as the house. 
Peter and Laura were great communicators throughout the process and were available for a couple of quick questions during our stay. Check in and check out were both seamless and easy. An overall excellent experience.
One quick note on the kid's items- they were very handy for us, but also would not be intrusive to a group staying here without a need for kids items. Toys were in a closet and the room with the crib still had plenty of living space that it wouldn't get in the way if you didn't need it."
2481189,16055927,2014-07-21,13076113,Cesse,"The house is super cute, convenient and has a great view! My cousin, her husband, their toddler, my husband, my mother, and I rented this house for the weekend for a family wedding. The hosts were nice enough to let us check in early, and made sure that they knew how many people were staying so they could arrange the beds accordingly. The house was super clean, the beds were comfortable, and the bathrooms were spotless! The kitchen was well stocked, and we were able to cook for ourselves very easily all weekend. There is a grill outside, and a tiny yard that we were all able to easily congregate in. There's a great view of the lake and Gas Works park from the upstairs bedroom. A bus across the street takes you straight downtown!"
2481189,16832503,2014-08-03,226821,Angela,"Awesome place 10 min bus ride to town. Excellent alternative to hotel, especially for small group. Laura was so obliging & helpful. So was Peter! 
Would to go back some day. 
Angela"
2481189,17497846,2014-08-13,13782799,Justin,"We stayed at Peter and Laura's home for 7 days and had a wonderful time! The location is perfect for visiting all areas of Seattle. Downtown, the lake, Fremont all are within walking distance, and there's a fabulous view of Lake Washington and Gas Works Park from the upstairs, master bedroom balcony. Two comfortable chairs on the balcony make it the perfect place to relax.

The house was immaculate when we arrived, and we immediately felt welcome and at home. There is a crib in one of the bedrooms (one of our 3 kids just turned 3, so the crib was perfect for us), and Peter wrote and asked if we'd like the crib prepared for our arrival. Very thoughtful. I had some questions during our stay, and Peter was very quick to respond every time, even offering to come by if needed.

Everything was as advertised, and I would definitely recommend staying at Peter & Laura's to friends."
2481189,17996338,2014-08-20,10710006,John,"Never met the hosts in person, but they were extremely responsive by phone and text.  Everything was as described, gorgeous view out 2nd floor balcony.  Doable, but kitchen/dining area was a bit tight for our 6-person family, but we knew that going in.  Nice modern appliances throughout. Great location: bus stop across the street, ample free street parking within a block or two.  Plenty of literature provided for sights, dining, and travel. Street was sometimes a bit noisy, but we didn't have trouble sleeping.  Loved our stay!"
2481189,18645082,2014-08-30,13259006,Yu-Sih," It is my first time using airbnb, this was an awesome experience!
Very cute typical Seattle house in a nice neighborhood. Clean and everything you need. Loved the house and location!
 I would highly recommend their house, not only for the convenience, and comfort, but also for its generous and helpful owners."
2481189,18875599,2014-09-02,16023506,Katie,"The home was better than we expected! Great location, extremely tidy, and we especially liked the very generous master bedroom and ensuite. Was really convenient to have the designated parking spot. Laura and Peter were great hosts as they were readily available to answer any questions and even offered suggestions of events going on in Seattle the weekend we visited. "
2481189,19766646,2014-09-18,13704358,Julia,"Our two week stay was wonderful. We came with out 1 year old daughter and we're very please with the kids room with the crib. The house was very nice in general, lost of room, all appliances and equipment you could ask for and a great view from to master bedroom. The location is great just a few minutes away from Queen Anne Ave. of lake union and Freemont. It was also a pleasure to meet out host Pete. Next time we come to seattle we will make sure to rent this apartment again!"
2481189,20008377,2014-09-22,17962769,Dirk,"We had a great trip to Seattle for a family wedding. The house was bright and clean, with great views. The neighborhood was safe, though the noise from the road might be a little loud for some light sleepers. All-in-all we had a great experience and would recommend for anyone visiting the area. "
2481189,20411218,2014-09-29,653233,Matt,"My four friends and I enjoyed our stay. I'd stay there again and recommend the house to others.

The place was clean and conveniently located in a quiet neighborhood. For larger parties, it is cozy (not a big common space), has no common TV, and ran out of hot water after four consecutive showers.

We didn't meet Laura and Peter, but they were very responsive over text."
2481189,20654872,2014-10-03,20717632,Francesca,"Beautiful house in a very pleasant and quiet area close to lake Union. We stayed there with two grown-up children for four days. Everything was as described and the interaction with the owners, whom we did not meet in person, was very good and effective. Check-in/out very easy and straight-forward. The house is extremely tidy and clean, furnished with a lot of taste and attention to the details and very well equipped. We particularly enjoyed the master bedroom on the second floor (the 1st for European readers!) with its lovely bathroom and the spectacular view on the lake.  All beds are very comfortable. We also appreciated the presence of a reserved/private parking space on the back of the house as we did not always found one on the street. Very conveniently located for Seattle downtown. We warmly recommend this property to everybody and hope to be able to get back again! Thank you very much for your hospitality!"
2481189,20856346,2014-10-06,2897623,Colleen,Easy check in and great location!
2481189,21950714,2014-10-27,20937363,Jake,"We stayed at Peter and Laura's home in late October and it was perfect for our needs. With two adult couples and an 11 month old, we had plenty of room for everyone. If you have a larger group, the shower situation might be tricky (only one shower in the downstairs bathroom with a nice soaking tub in the upstairs master bath), but since we were just four and in no hurry, it was no issue. The home is a nice escape from the city - no cable TV, but and ample and impressive selection of books. Coupled with the proximity to the lake, the home has a cabin type feel for those used to an urban metropolis. Peter was very responsive and was kind enough to let us check out a little late so the parents could get the baby ready for the flight. Overall, we were very satisfied and would definitely stay here again. "
2481189,23423147,2014-12-01,12038244,Chad,Peter and Laura were very accommodating for our group of 6 adults.  They were also very easy to get in touch with.  They made our stay very enjoyable.  The apartment was beautifully decorated with old pictures and books galore.   Our group had no problem with the smaller water heater.  The upstairs bathroom with the french tub was perfectly decorated.   It was centrally located between Downtown Seattle and the Ballard neighborhood.   I highly recommend staying here.
2481189,24578983,2014-12-31,19223084,Kathy,"We had a fabulous trip and loved this home!  It was even more charming than described and is in a great location. The kitchen was well appointed, the beds were comfortable and the house was immaculate.  We would definitely love to stay there again.    Bus lines are easily accessible, Lyft trips to downtown or Queen Ann restaurants ran us $7 to $8 and there is a cute little corner grocery store two blocks down the street that has a nice selection of wine, beer and sundries.  We arrived the day after Christmas and were very surprised and happy to find a fully decorated Christmas tree in the living room, it was perfect and really made us feel at home.   Laura and Peter checked in with us through text messages to make sure everything was okay and they responded quickly to questions.   We could not have been more pleased with our stay! "
2481189,25060784,2015-01-05,25264114,Michael,"My guests and I thought the place was beautiful and whenever we had questions, the hosts were very quick to respond to make our stay more enjoyable. We would stay here again!"
2481189,28434990,2015-03-23,29036181,Molly,This was absolutely perfect for our trip. The home was beautiful and very conviently located. Laura and Peter were phenomenal hosts.

2481189,29880515,2015-04-13,54896,Cassy,"This was our second time staying with Laura & Peter. Just as before we had a wonderful stay. Their home is so comfortable, clean and well appointed. A great value and a lovely location. Thank you for opening your home!"
2481189,30330982,2015-04-20,11690259,Kevin,"My partner, our 4 month old daughter, both our mothers and I stayed in Peter and Laura's place in Queen Anne for a long weekend. The house was even nicer than the pictures showed--very cozy and nicely decorated. Peter and Laura were very responsive and accomodating. The location is excellent--very convenient to Downtown, Fremont, and Ballard. Parking is easy. Nice view of Lake Union from balcony. Would definitely recommend, especially to families or groups looking for a more comfortable and personal alternative to multiple hotel rooms."
2481189,31975135,2015-05-12,7656187,Jean,"We felt very welcome by Laura and Peter!  The listing was accurate, the neighborhood was very convenient to downtown.  Everything was very clean and well thought out.
We were especially grateful that Laura and Peter were very baby friendly since we had a two year old with us. 
We would recommend this listing for anyone coming to enjoy the beautiful city of Seattle! "
2481189,33009870,2015-05-24,6962337,John,"We had such a wonderful time here.  Very clean and cozy.  The view from the balcony was outstanding.  Loved waking up each morning and walking to the nearby grocery store grabbing a cup of coffee taking it up to the balcony to watch the boats and planes go by.  

Mostly took ubers to get around and this place is perfectly situated to get anywhere.  Loved the quiet neighborhood aspect as well, it was very peaceful.  Had such a wonderful stay.  "
2481189,33247998,2015-05-26,7861969,Corinna,"Beautiful home, wonderful location! I planned a weekend in Seattle with a few girlfriends and Laura and Peter's place was the perfect homebase. Laura and Peter were extremely responsive and flexible."
2481189,33978602,2015-06-03,21905768,Friederycke And Jeff,We had a wonderful stay in Laura and Peter's home. They made us and our two little kids feel very welcome. They were very quick to respond to all our questions. The house is beautifully decorated and well equipped. We will try to stay there again if we come back to Seattle.
2481189,34276347,2015-06-07,27971407,Ashley,"The house looked just like the pictures.  For a group of 6 adults it was possibly a little too cozy, but the convenient location made it worthwhile. The house was very clean which I personally appreciate a lot!  Peter & Laura were also great at communicating to us and responding to questions.  Overall a great stay."
2481189,34650366,2015-06-10,5063549,Julia,"We had a wonderful stay at Lauren Peter's house. That house is cozy but well appointed.  It more than met the needs of the two adults and two children in our party given that we were out and about most of the days we stayed. The house is also perfectly situated for touring Seattle and is an easy walk to the Fremont neighborhood.

Laura and Peter were easy to communicate with and made checking in and out a breeze. "
2481189,35057260,2015-06-15,10574030,Alan,"Laura met at us at her beautiful home, and gave us a tour of the house.  She was very welcoming and was quick to communicate via text if we had any questions. The house is even nicer than the pictures portray, with a lovely view of Lake Union from the upstairs balcony. We were attending our daughter's graduation from SPU and this location was perfect. We had our in-laws with us, and they also thought the home was lovely. We shared many happy hours there celebrating a once-in-a-lifetime family event. Thank you Laura and Peter for sharing your home with us! "
2481189,35998261,2015-06-24,24659604,Suki,The house is beautiful with great location. We had a wonderful stay. We would definitely stay there again on future trips to Seattle.
2481189,36253302,2015-06-26,3054325,Matthew,"Solid place. We made a last minute reservation and they were able to accommodate. It was a little tricky to find the parking space and unit, but besides that it was a great place. I like when hosts pay attention to the details in the place. Nice classical Music playing upon entry, hand written instructions for house notes in a nice artistic book, and everything in order."
2481189,36659009,2015-06-30,17982271,Andy,Beautiful house in the Queen Anne area of Seattle. Only about a mile from the space needle/seattle center. The house looked great just like the pictures. Everything was clean and well maintained. One thing to note is that there isn't any air conditioning (which is very common in Seattle). We happened to come during the great June heat wave that hit the west coast and so it was warm during the day. It did cool down significantly at night though with the windows open and was comfortable. Overall we would stay here again. 
2481189,37069505,2015-07-04,34781969,Eugene,"House is in a nice residential location with easy access to Space Needle and other attractions. The house was very clean and comfortable, and everything was in good working order. There was a bit of a heat wave when we stayed, and host was kind enough to call to let us know and come by with extra fans to cool off the house - very considerate! The upstairs balcony had a nice view of the water and small boat traffic, and it was very nice to step out there and watch the boats. Everything was exactly as described, so we knew what to expect. There is a reserved off-street parking space, so we always had somewhere to park, but the spot was a little tight - which is normal for the area, but it might be difficult to park a wide SUV (like Suburban) in the reserved spot."
2481189,37444292,2015-07-07,26855636,Emily,"We stayed at Laura and Peter's charming home over the July 4 weekend.  It was wonderful for our family of 4 adults + 2 children.  Laura and Peter were beyond accommodating, even getting an air conditioner for the unseasonable hot weather!  Their place is great for viewing the July 4 fireworks - we could look down onto Lake Union and see the barge from where they were launched!  

The neighborhood is convenient to downtown Seattle and having a dedicated parking spot is a big plus.  We would stay here again!"
2481189,37944604,2015-07-12,27507290,Debbie,"Peter and Laura's home is beautiful and the neighborhood was perfect for our family. The kitchen is well-stocked and we loved cooking dinners at home. Everything about our stay was easy and comfortable, and we felt welcome. Thanks, Peter and Laura!"
2481189,38373378,2015-07-15,29518682,Kathleen,Peter was very gracious and answered all of our questions about getting around in the downtown area.  His house is very clean and comfortable and is within walking distance of the Space Needle.  We were able to walk to catch the monorail to Pike's Market as well.  Peter was also available for last minute questions or problems.  Thank you for letting us use your house while on vacation in the Seattle area.
2481189,39141622,2015-07-21,24204127,Patricia,"What a terrific time we had staying in this lovely place in Seattle last week! The home was immaculate and very inviting. The hosts made us feel so welcome and provided all the information we needed for our stay there. Communication was excellent! Everyone in our family group was very comfortable and we would definitely return to this airbnb if an occasion to visit Seattle should arise again. The view from what we called ""The Lido Deck"" is absolutely gorgeous and we all enjoyed having a cocktail up there in the evening. We highly recommend this airbnb home. Don't hesitate to book this location. "
2481189,40072127,2015-07-28,5002436,Beth,"Peter and Laura were great. They were so responsive to anything we needed and answered questions we had immediately. The house was perfect! Clean, comfortable, convenient. I would definitely recommend them as a place to stay in the future. "
2481189,41308569,2015-08-07,26640215,Patricia,"The house was wonderfully furnished and very clean with plenty of room for 3 adults and 3 kids. Everything we needed was provided: plenty of clean towels, blankets, kitchenware, fresh coffee beans, fans, ironing board and iron, laundry detergent, and even shampoo and conditioner in the bathroom. The location was a close drive to pretty much everywhere and there is also public transportation available. We had our toddler with us and also really appreciated the availability of some toys and puzzles in the house to explore while we stayed. There is also a lovely view of Lake Union from the upstairs balcony. It really felt like a home away from home. "
2481189,41747125,2015-08-09,24650562,Jeannette,Peter and Laura made us feel very welcome although we were not able to meet as they were out of town when we were there. The queries I had before our trip were answered quickly and fully. The property more than filled our expectations and was well described by our hosts.

Our location was even more convenient to the city center than we'd realized.  I sent a few texts during our stay asking for certain items, and got replies immediately.  This is a great space and these are great hosts!"
2481189,44889118,2015-08-30,872000,Halli,"Laura and Peter's home was perfect in many ways,  first it's beautifully decorated very homey feel to it. Second the location is great
only a ten minute drive to the museums and other downtown attractions. Go on Yelp and we found some great restaurants."
2481189,46263507,2015-09-09,3212553,Erica,"We loved this place! It was exactly as described, lovely, convenient neighborhood, felt very safe, very clean.  Hosts were away while we were there, but stayed in touch via email.  Highly recommended!"

2481189,54714076,2015-11-23,10637023,Jannie,Laura and Peter were lovely hosts. They even brought pastries from a local bakery! Super cute home and that view is so pretty. Beds were comfortable and our 1 year old loved going around and around the hall way. Great location. Easy to get downtown and out to the other sections of town. Thanks for a wonderful stay! 
3050140,13395822,2014-05-26,2529102,Daniel,"Susan's place was FANTASTIC! It was CLEAN, neat, and felt brand new. If we were moving to Seattle we would try to convince Susan to rent her place to us full time, that is how much we loved it. Susan's place had all that we needed and more. We prepared multiple meals and Susan's place was equipped with everything we needed minus the groceries. 

The location is in Wallingford/Greenlake in a quiet neighborhood with ample street parking. There are places to eat and grab coffee just a few blocks away. Getting to downtown is quick and easy, making Susan's location more than ideal.

Susan was super communicative both prior and during our stay. Susan was more than accommodating in providing anything we needed. We'll be contacting Susan first on our next visit to Seattle.  "
3050140,14571395,2014-06-22,16136949,Bill,"We had a wonderful time in Seattle. Susan's apartment was even nicer than the pictures.  Clean, homey, attractive, private and convenient to all of Seattle, located in a beautiful area. Susan treated us like personal guests. She was helpful, warm and friendly. Full of good tips for tourists.  I'd recommend these accommodations to everyone and we would go back again! "
3050140,14989825,2014-06-30,6716567,Darren,"We never saw Susan but we didn't need to, she was great about communicating through text and email. Her location is excellent (10 minutes to Queen Anne, 10 minutes to Freemont, 15 or so to downtown) and the apartment even better. A bedroom, living room with easy to use cable, private entry, seamless wifi, doors that open onto a patio with flowers in bloom, chairs in the sun, a bbq, and a hot tub. The apartment seems really new and very clean. She even let us use the garage to store our bikes. All in all an outstanding experience and I would recommend to anyone, it's a no-brainer to stay there! "
3050140,15547796,2014-07-11,17020931,George,"This is an absolutely fantastic place to stay. Susan is a wonderful host, and the accommodations are terrific.

Our situation was a  little unique,  but Susan worked  with us to make sure we had everything we need.  the  apartment  was very clean  and comfortable.  the outdoor space was the perfect place to relax.  she was warm and friendly and  gave us  complete privacy.  she was also very responsive when we did have questions.  We would definitely go back again!"
3050140,16348863,2014-07-26,2767415,Alice,"Susan was very welcoming and available if needed.  Although she was in the process of painting the exterior of the house, she was careful to make sure that she and her workers did not impose on us, and that we were comfortable.  The apartment was in excellent condition, and was in a great neighborhood.  I would gladly stay there again without hesitation. "

The space was even nicer than the pictures represented, everything was clean and comfortable, and niceties like extra towels, a hair dryer in the bathroom, and a coffee maker for our morning brew made the experience a great one. Susan made us feel welcome with tips on local sights and restaurants, and even a bar of chocolate to greet us on our arrival.  The neighborhood was lovely; we enjoyed taking walks around the lake and checking out nearby cafes and restaurants, and it was an easy drive to the downtown area, Fremont and Queen Anne, as well as other spots in the city.  We felt like we got to know Seattle a lot better by staying in this residential neighborhood.  Overall, we really enjoyed our visit and would definitely stay here again."
3050140,16666598,2014-07-31,1030968,Sean,"We loved staying at this apartment in a quiet little neighborhood in Seattle.  True to the pictures, the place was very clean and had clearly been remodeled recently.  It was especially nice having a full kitchen (full-size refrigerator, microwave, stove/oven, coffee maker, etc.) right in the unit.  We also loved the neighborhood.  It was a quiet, residential neighborhood, but close to two freeways, and a short drive to the center of town (Space Needle, Pike's Place Market, etc.).  Susan was a perfect host.  She was there if we needed her, but she gave us our space.  If you stay there, try to get dinner and drinks at nearby Rock Creek Seafood & Spirits on Fremont Ave.    "
3050140,16984570,2014-08-05,16395386,Jenny,We were first time visitors to Seattle and we had a fabulous time!  Our stay at Susan's cozy private apartment was one reason of many as to why we had such a great visit.  Conveniently located to all areas of Seattle.  The apartment was very comfortable and had all the amenities one would need for a visit to the area.  Susan was very thoughtful and genuine care for her visitors.  Wallingford is a cute neighborhood with fun restaurants all within walking distance from the apartment.  Susan has great taste and you can tell she puts a lot of time & effort to maintain her beautiful home.  
3050140,17275990,2014-08-10,7342676,Trish,"Great location close to Greenlake w/ easy access to downtown. Apartment was very clean, cute, and cozy. Nice to leave the french doors open for airflow and just relax and read on the couch or chairs outside. Susan was very accommodating and accessible. Definitely would return. "
3050140,17444728,2014-08-12,4844198,Farra,"The space is well designed, functional, clean and private. Susan has thought of many details to make life easy and is a perfect host...quick to respond and easy to communicate with. Green Lake is just a brief walk away and there are coffee and donut shops in walking distance as well. So happy that we were able to stay with her during our Seattle stay."
3050140,17693688,2014-08-16,17873184,Martha,"This apartment was in excellent shape. Clean, safe,quiet,comfortable,and perfect! I was very nervous about using airbnb it is not in my comfort zone and I was by myself. I was so happy with this place and Susan is wonderful and very friendly. The neighborhood is safe and I parked on the street,found a place every night. 
I am 58 years old a registered nurse who was visiting my new grand baby.
The kitchen is great and very well stocked with everything you need,to cook and then some. Very clean stove ,fridge and cooking things. I LOVED it! I will stay again the bed is very comfortable .Thank you Susan !!! Martha
P.S the bathroom is very nice clean and has  everything you will need!"
3050140,20030503,2014-09-22,11165674,Tommy,"Susan was an excellent host. Very accommodating for arrival time, present for any needs but not obtrusive. Her guest space was perfect for our time in Seattle. "
3050140,21415967,2014-10-17,18067237,Nancy,"Susan was a very gracious host. She told me where the nearby places were to eat. There is a lake a few blocks away where you can walk,run, or just sit. The apartment is clean, spacious and she had everything there that I needed. She even lets you share the washer and dryer for a nominal fee. The apartment is near the University of Washington which is perfect for attending a short term class, or getting you children settled in their dorm, or attending graduation ceremonies. I was always able to find street parking within 1/2 block, but usually right in front of the apartment. There is a private entrance to the apartment off a beautiful patio. It was quiet, which was important as I was studying for a class. WIFI and cable tv worked well. The whole experience was very positive."
3050140,21984124,2014-10-27,22495650,Pamela,"This was our first experience with airbnb and I was a little nervous.  Our host Susan could not have been more accommodating.  She was easy to stay in contact with and made access to the apartment easy based on our arrival.  It was very comfortable, bright, clean and adequately spacious.  There was a super large walk in closet with drawers, clothes rod and large surface to set our suitcases.  We would definitely stay here again on another trip to Seattle and would consider looking at airbnb for a trip to different city.  Thanks Susan for sharing your home!  Great neighborhood, felt safe."
3050140,22474753,2014-11-07,22019484,Antonella,"Susan'apt is fantastic. I really like it. It's comfortable, very clean and functional, it' smuch better than you can hope! 
I hope to reserve again for my following stays in Seattle. The location is refinent and residential."
3050140,22850701,2014-11-16,20629296,Diego,"We recently moved to Seattle and stayed at Susan's place for a week waiting for our things to arrive. Susan was accommodating with our arrival time and made us feel very comfortable during the whole stay. The place was in excellent condition when we arrived. 
The neighborhood is quiet  and conveniently located close to parks,  restaurants, a grocery store, and public transit. Five star experience!"
3050140,23193745,2014-11-24,23916360,Connie,"Susan was a friendly and welcoming host.  She was prompt to reply to all questions.  The location is ideally situated in that it is close to UW, a quick drive downtown and a couple of blocks from Greenlake.  We appreciated the cleanliness and neatness of the locale.  Overall, the stay was great and I would definitely recommend Susan as a host."
3050140,23334565,2014-11-29,9666389,Mike,"We had an excellent time in Susan's apartment!  It was clean, as advertised, and Susan is a very gracious hostess.  We enjoyed meeting her cat, Olive, her dog, and her younger son, who was delightful.  It's a great location, close to Greenlake and our son's house. We had a great Thanksgiving in Seattle.  We would love to visit again next year!   Mike & Lila ..."
3050140,28643970,2015-03-28,22414452,Dawn,"Thank you, Susan, for such a welcoming stay.  We both enjoyed our extended stay in your apartment.  The place was comfortable and quiet. We'd recommend your place to anyone needing a cozy quaint neighborhood to stay for a weekend or longer (like we did) Susan, I hope to see you around town soon!!"
3050140,28850472,2015-03-30,4213736,Kate & Eric,We had a wonderful stay at this basement apartment! Susan was friendly and greeted us briefly at our arrival. The apartment itself was perfect for our needs and incredibly clean. The location was also exactly what we were looking for - a quaint quiet neighborhood within walking distance to shops and restaurants and only a 10 min drive to the city center.  We would stay here again. 
3050140,29353237,2015-04-06,23358651,Juanita,"This place was exactly what I expected and it was great.  Very cozy, private and having a kitchen & access to laundry was key.
Street parking was never an issue.  Will ALWAYS want to stay here when I come to Seattle if possible :)"
3050140,30318739,2015-04-20,293649,Lenny,We both wished that we could live here! Fantastic location near Green Lake with lots of privacy and everything we could ask for.
3050140,30734677,2015-04-26,16617514,Max,"Susan's Greenlake apartment is perfect. It is delightfully cozy, private, surprisingly bright and very clean. My stay was so comfortable. The neighborhood is really welcoming. Parking out front was easy-breezy. We were just blocks from the park. Susan is friendly, efficient and professional. Thank you, Susan!"
3050140,31263765,2015-05-03,10835793,Aron,"Susan was very communicative and made the booking and check-in process seamless. I booked this location for my parents who were visiting from out of town. This private in-law was meticulously clean and was very comfortable for my parents. What my parents liked most in addition to the cleanliness, was that this in-law is off the street and very quiet. This is just a few blocks away from Greenlake, which is a beautiful place to walk or run. Susan was a pleasure to deal with and obviously takes a lot of pride in her home. I highly recommend this apartment!"
3050140,31813596,2015-05-10,21701624,Dave,"We really loved this apartment, it had plenty of space and was in a very walkable neighborhood in Greenlake. "
3050140,33261599,2015-05-26,1105152,Polly,"What a welcome! What a place! This apartment was wonderful, just perfect. Great location in funky little Tangletown with a choice of very good restaurants, amazing donuts (Mighty-O), delicious coffee (Zoka) and a fantastic walking opportunity (Greenlake) to clear your head after an evening at Elysian or the Burgundian. Plus it is easy access to Seattle's best northwest neighborhoods - UDistrict, Wallingford, Phinney Ridge, Ballard (oh the taphouses!). And Susan is a wonderful host - the perfect balance of friendly/ready to help and giving you space. The apartment is so lovely - lots of light and cozy with an incredible closet and hooks everywhere (which sounds like a small thing but really helps to keep organized away from home). Plus a hot tub in case there is some over-indulgence of all Seattle has to offer. We will be back for sure! Thank you Susan :)"
3050140,33989494,2015-06-03,29831486,Drew,"Wonderful home to stay for our 4 day vacation in seattle! I couldn't be more pleased with our stay. I was able to cook full meals to help with our vacation expenses and when I forgot an ingredient at the store susan was willing to help me out. 
I would recommend this place to couples or possibly a family of 3. We stayed with out daughter who was almost 2 and slept in her pack and play in the closet (which is a perfect size and right next to the bed ) I'm sure another child could sleep on the couch if need be. 
The location was wonderful we were far away enough from the busy life of downtown Seattle, but still maybe a 15 minute drive from the ferries. And if the city life isn't for you, the area around greenlake is breathtaking. We walked to breakfast, then to the beautiful zoo, and then walked around greenlake! 
Over all I wish we had stayed longer. Thank you so much again susan!"
3050140,34556278,2015-06-09,33194988,Daniel,"Susan has a lovely, well kept, home...highly recommended! We really enjoyed our stay in her basement apartment the two nights that we were there. The apartment is a great size and very cozy. Green Lake is close by and worth checking out. Would definitely stay there again if we are out in Seattle. Thanks for the complimentary chocolates as well! :)"
3050140,34948064,2015-06-14,15129491,Sara,"My stay at Susan's was very comfortable! She was extremely flexible with my check in time, and she responded very quickly during our correspondence. The apartment was clean and very nicely furnished. I felt like I was at home. I would recommend this listing to anyone!"
3050140,35560593,2015-06-20,8202342,Aram,"I don't think that words can describe how amazing this rental is. First off, Susan is very nice and accommodating. She made sure that my sister and I were settled and showed us where everything was. The unit was beautiful, clean and felt like home. The location is spot on. It's in a quiet neighborhood that's about a couple of blocks from Greenlake and less than 5 min from I5. Oh, I forgot her friendly cat.  She has a very sweet cat that loves to play. "
3050140,36264682,2015-06-27,25224859,Dennis,"What a great apartment. What a great host Susan is. Would not hesitate to stay here again. Susan,
thanks for making our stay trouble free!"
3050140,39366981,2015-07-23,17941991,Lisa,"What a fantastic experience!  The apartment is very nice, clean, and has all the comforts of home.  The bed is so comfortable that we are going to purchase the same mattress for our home. The outdoor space outside the living room is beautiful and so relaxing. You can't beat the location. Definitely a walkable neighborhood.  A few short blocks away are wonderful restaurants, coffee shop, the lake, donut shop, bodega, farmer's market, and a bus stop that goes straight to downtown.  Ballard and Fremont (two great areas) are less than a couple miles away. Because of the location, it is easy to get to just about any area of Seattle.  We did not have a car and used the bus and uber when we were not walking. Our daughter visited us often and there is always free available street parking-a plus for Seattle.  
My stay was for over three weeks, so I had the pleasure a getting to know the host, Susan, and some of her family and friends. Such nice people. Susan does such an amazing job maintaining her home to perfection.  Susan is so easy going and has put a lot of thought, effort and time into providing her guest with a pleasurable and comfortable experience. 
We have stayed at many Airbnb's and have had great experiences at all of them, but this one has been the best by far. I plan on staying here again and again. Enjoy."
3050140,39922261,2015-07-27,32423033,Marcy,"The apartment was perfect for us -- the size, the outdoor space and the furnishings. The neighborhood is very pleasant, quiet and convenient.  A good walking area."
3050140,40756075,2015-08-02,5959658,Jenn,"Susan made us feel very welcome. Her apartment was perfectly appointed with everything we needed--including her generous offer of the laundry facilities. We loved the convenience of an extra room/huge closet to store & keep our luggage out of the way. Green Lake neighborhood is beautiful & in close proximity to everything, though you don't feel a city ""vibe."" Highly recommended!"
3050140,41122377,2015-08-04,27782844,Rachelle,Great little apartment with all the essentials and a beautiful backyard patio. Easy to get around my bus and plenty of restaurants and shops within walking distance. 
3050140,41631733,2015-08-08,10283647,Jane,"Susan's apartment was perfect. It's a wonderful attachment to the main house. It actually was a lot more roomier than I had anticipated from the pictures. There's a huge walk in closet, comfy queen bed, and a living area with the necessary amenities like coffee, tea, cream, and even chocolates! We also had access to the patio which seats 6 guests and the jacuzzi (even though we didn't use it, it was a nice option to have).

We appreciated that Susan also left plenty of clean towels and access to a washer and dryer. Not much else to say but it was a very pleasant stay. When we come back to Seattle, we hope that she will still have this listing up so we can stay here again!"
3050140,42817546,2015-08-16,28695219,Steve,"Susan was responsive and pleasant (but not at all intrusive) from my initial inquiry through check out. The apartment was comfortable and clean, and exactly as advertised. I especially appreciated the abundance of natural light for a lower unit and the beautiful shared patio space. My 11 yo son was a big fan of the nook with a mattress in the enormous closet off the bedroom. We were in Seattle for a mix of business and pleasure, and Susan's place suited us perfectly. "
3050140,44317272,2015-08-25,7592266,Rebecca,"This was our first trip to Seattle.  We chose Susan's apartment because of its proximity to our daughter's house and its location in a residential neighborhood within walking distance of Green Lake and other amenities.  We were not disappointed.  I can't imagine a better location from which to explore the city.

The apartment is clean, spacious and well-equipped.  The bed was super comfortable.  There is plenty of empty closet and drawer space so you can move in and stay organized.  We ate all breakfasts in and prepared several dinners for 4, which we enjoyed in the back garden.  (This would not be as possible during cold or rainy weather, because there is no dining table in the apartment.)

We loved strolling through the neighborhood to the lake and to restaurants.  We had a rental car, but we did not always use it.  We found it easy to take a bus into town to avoid the traffic.  The back garden is very tidy and a private place of respite in a busy city.  Susan and her family are all very friendly and considerate.   The pets are sweet and gentle and added to our enjoyment.

We found communication to be easy.  Susan quickly addressed the one issue we had.  We would certainly stay in Susan's apartment again, particularly during the beautiful summer months in Seattle!"
3050140,44629239,2015-08-28,4992506,John,"Susan was a wonderful host. Her home is beautiful. We have stayed at a number of airbnb homes in Seattle and this was the best by far. It was in fact better than described. Susan has provided every possible convenience. It was a terrific experience, truly a home away from home. Hopefully, this will be our go to place each time we visit Seattle.
"
3050140,44911192,2015-08-30,29763813,Robin,"Susan's house was an ideal place for my husband and I to stay when we were visiting Seattle for a wedding. The apartment is immaculate, comfortable and the backyard amenities were a huge plus. Susan was the perfect host. We plan to return and we will highly recommend Susan's place to our friends visiting Seattle."
3050140,46262039,2015-09-09,4992506,John,"We had great experience. Susan is a wonderful and welcoming host. The accommodations were excellent.
Nothing was lacking from her charming home."
3050140,46888348,2015-09-14,34538391,Liz,"This place was absolutely perfect for what I needed! Great little kitchen area for coffee and breakfast in the mornings, a nice sized bedroom with a huge closet, and a great view of the patio and trees. My arrival and departure was easy - Susan met me when I arrived and showed me around. She even offered to take me to pick up my rental car I used for a day. The neighborhood was wonderful as well. And convenient! A block away the #16 bus takes you into downtown, shops and stores close by, and Green Lake trails just two blocks west. I'm definitely glad to have stayed here. Susan was a wonderful host and the apartment was delightful. I would absolutely book again!"
3050140,47642667,2015-09-21,14146427,Gretta,"Our stay at Susan's apartment was perfect in every way. Excellent communication from start to finish. Susan went above and beyond to ensure our stay and visit with our family went smoothly and it did.  We enjoyed the well appointed, tastefully decorated apartment with everything that one would need at home.  It is set up in an environmentally conscious way for easy recycling. The photos are 100% accurate. The entire apartment is spotless and well cared for.  We enjoyed the backyard and hot tub - a definite bonus. This will be our home away from home whenever we visit Seattle.  Thank you Susan for sharing your lovely home with us.  We look forward to staying with you again soon.  "
3050140,48699161,2015-09-28,32616560,Wendi,We really enjoyed our stay. The basement had everything that we needed for a pleasant stay. The bed was especially comfortable. 
3050140,50632489,2015-10-13,14739833,Kim,"We had a good time staying at the apartment while visiting friends who had recently had a baby nearby. Easy to walk to coffee and vegan donuts. The hot tub was a plus and the surrounding garden area was SO beautiful to look out on from the apartment - so peaceful! The apartment itself was clean and well maintained, it looked new! The provisions for a cup of tea, including tiny creamer was the highlight of my first morning there. Susan had thought of everything"
3050140,51135250,2015-10-18,42601031,William,"My wife and I had a nice visit with Susan on our first day. Had a lot in common with our sons and our pets. She was very accommodating, but gave us our space."
3050140,52239004,2015-10-27,44778606,Mary,"Our host made us feel extremely welcome and comfortable. Coul not have asked for a better location! Close to bus route, which was great to go back & forth downtown easily. Plus close to walk the lake and good eats close by too. Loved it!"
3050140,53852942,2015-11-13,48333912,Kelsey,"Susan's space is just as welcoming and inviting as she is! This little mother-in-law style apartment is cozy and comfortable. It was wonderful to have a place to call home while I was away from home, especially one that was so well-kept and close to so many little shops and restaurants. You can feel right at home, curling up with a cup of tea on the couch, or you can walk 10 minutes to a main strip of shops, bars, and restaurants. I will definitely be staying with Susan the next time I'm in Seattle!"
3050140,54134073,2015-11-16,46171766,Cilla,"Very comfortable apartment with everything we needed.
Susan made our arrival time flexible so that planning our trip was very easy."
3050140,55101417,2015-11-28,2946874,Nicole,"Susan's apartment was the perfect spot for my mother to stay while visiting over the holiday weekend.  It was plenty roomy for her and a couple would be very comfortable there.  

The French doors and numerous windows let in plenty of light.  Susan has gorgeous, healthy plants thriving in the space!

The living room is perfect for visiting and lounging and the kitchen had everything she needed - full size appliances, coffee and coffee maker, cookware, glasses, plates, etc.  

The bedroom was spacious and includes a large, walk in closet.  My mom reports that the bed was very comfy.

The bathroom is stocked with big, fluffy white towels (like a luxury hotel!) and all amenities including lotion, shampoo, conditioner and a hair dryer. 

Wifi and TV both worked perfectly.  Mom's visit was on a very chilly weekend, but the heater worked great and she was able to control the thermostat herself and keep it to her liking.

Because it was so cold, we did not get to take advantage of the spacious, sunny deck.  We are hoping to book  the apartment for friends over the summer to enjoy some time out there though!

The neighborhood is ideal with easy access to Greenlake and Woodland Park.  At the top of the street is the Tangletown neighborhood with great restaurants, a brewery and a convenience store.  The location couldn't be better!

Susan visited with us the night we checked in and was warm, friendly and funny.  While we knew that she was a mere text away if we needed anything, we left her to enjoy her own holiday weekend because there was not a single thing we needed.  

She has thoughtfully created a lovely and comfortable guest apartment that I'd highly recommend to anyone visiting Seattle.

We will  definitely be back in touch with Susan when we have guests visiting in 2016.

 "
3050140,57158488,2015-12-22,2539852,Kathy & Jerry,"Outstanding lodging: spacious but cozy; clean, modern and warm. Susan is an excellent host, very accessible and accommodating.  The location is nice - quiet, but very convenient to Greenlake area, with easy parking.  We definitely would stay here again. "
3050140,57507568,2015-12-27,17154881,Jake,"Susan's place is great! The description is perfect and completely met our expectations. Easy to find and park. Comfortable bed, massive closet, nice kitchen space. Coffee and tea is provided, along with a welcome gift of chocolate. Would love to stay here again next time I visit Seattle. 

Zoka Coffee and Tangletown Elysian Brewery are a short walk away, both worth checking out. Green Lake is also close - good place to walk or go for a run."
3050140,58151865,2016-01-01,29895388,Jonathan,"Loved the place! Clean, private and within walking distance of the buses and a few really good restaurants and coffee shops. If you want to stay in, there is a full kitchen and cable tv. "
8053396,46537486,2015-09-11,14740568,Vince,"This location is absolutely perfect. I travel all over the country and like being able to experience new places on foot and the place is located in the heart of the city. Very walkable to locations like the Space Needle and the baseball/football stadiums and is basically inside Pike's Market and across the street from the main pier. Lots of great places to eat or grab a drink, as well. 

Jones was an exceptional host, actually picked us up at the airport! She is a lifelong Seattle resident and knew all of the ins and outs of the city. Want a great place for dinner? Text Jones. Want a local sports bar to watch the game? Text Jones. Always got back to us quickly with answers. Look forward to staying with this host again in the future. "
8053396,47434512,2015-09-18,44091245,Bethani,Amazing location with a great view of the bay right outside your balcony. Right in the heart of downtown Seattle located basically in Pikes Place Market. What more could you want but great local eats and fantastic shopping right outside your door? Jones was a great host and very accomidating. Looking forward to another visit and would defiantly book this location again 
8053396,49053331,2015-09-30,21787024,Terry,"The location is perfect - close to Pike Place Market, the waterfront, SAM, downtown. The apt. has a terrific view of Puget Sound, was immaculate, nicely furnished and equipped with everything you need for a comfortable visit. Jones was a wonderful host - full of local knowledge, provided local maps and guides to activities, and even gave us a lift to the apartment from downtown so we wouldn't have to carry our bags. We'll definitely be back!"
8053396,49401646,2015-10-03,26565894,Victor,"Jones was extremely friendly and responsive from our 1st question before we booked, to check in.  The apartment was model home perfect with all the decor, supplies, features we could have wanted in a hotel and was FULLY STOCKED.  It was clean and ready to enjoy. It has a clear view of the ferris wheel and the bay. Truthfully, it was better than we had expected and a pleasant surprise for our 1st Airbnb experience.  We would definitely recommend this unit for someone wishing to stay in the heart of Pike Place Market. "
8053396,49678747,2015-10-05,20639661,George,"Great place to stay in Downtown Seattle. Very convenient for everything. Jones was a great host, responsive and keen to help. "
8053396,50020231,2015-10-08,41773747,Son,"Book your next Seattle getaway at Jones! Enough said! However, if you need more reasons, here are some:
1) His place is amazing. It is a hidden gem among the different BnB options nearby. Clean, classic, and well-organized. Appliances are brand new. It has enough room for 4 people or less. In terms of location, you cannot beat his place! It is right across from the marina (Elliot's, Aquarium, Argosy...etc). The gum wall and Post Alley is 3 floors down. The view at night from his small balcony is stunning as well. 
2) Jones is an exceptional host. He knows the ins and outs of his place and was very enthusiastic in providing details about his place along with places that I should visit. He definitely went the extra mile when he picked us up at the D-Link station (we were stranded there due to a train accident)
At first, I had my reservations about his place due to the lack of reviews. However, after this experience, Jones' place will definitely be my first choice whenever I visit Seattle now. "
8053396,50341075,2015-10-11,31721600,Jillian,"Amazing place in downtown Seattle!  I would definitely recommend this apartment for anyone that wants to stay right by the market and the waterfront, we couldn't have asked for a better location!  We did all the touristy things like the Space Needle, EMP museum, Chihuly museum, harbor tour, and a handful of bars and restaurants and everything was walkable from our apartment.  We didn't even need to rent a car! Jones was the perfect host and very accommodating from the moment that we booked this trip, he even picked us up from the airport because we were nervous about getting into the city and it worked out perfect! And he made sure to check in with us during our stay to make sure everything was going okay. The apartment itself was amazing, Jones stocked it with everything from chocolates and bottles of water to maps of things to do in Seattle. We liked it so much we wished we could live there! I would definitely recommend staying here over a hotel!!! "
8053396,50909720,2015-10-15,46499651,Jim,"PERFECT LOCATION can't be stated strongly enough!!!   I was here for work and all of my clients were within a five block walk.  After work, my wife and I had a great time hitting up some of the local restaurants within walking distance.  We counted 45 restaurants within two blocks but I'm sure we missed quite a few.  Jones was a great host from the moment I booked.  He was full of all kinds of suggestions.   My next trip to Seattle will wont be booked until I know that Jones' apartment is available for me."
8053396,51053398,2015-10-17,44133605,Nicole,This location is PERFECT!!! i'd highly recommend you stay here if in (email hidden)e apartment is conveniently located in Pikes Place and is walking distance to everything.  Jones was a great host from the day we booked. Cant say enough great things about this place!!!  
8053396,51816763,2015-10-24,9786908,Jordan,"We had an excellent stay in Jones's listing in Pike Place. The pictures on the listing were very accurate to what we found when we arrived. There were fresh flowers when we arrived and the apartment was very clean. The location could not be beat - within two minutes walk you could be in the market. Jones always responded within an hour and was very easy to work with. Jones was very accommodating - we were able to store our luggage in the apartment until we left for our flight even though we had already ""checked out."" We would definitely stay again on future trips to the area."
8053396,52525144,2015-10-30,11201586,Kathy,"I spent 3 weeknights at Jones' place while conferencing at the Bell Harbor Conference Center.  I flew into Sea-Tac and took the Link to downtown, arriving at nearly 10 pm.  Jones was a gracious host. He met me at the station and walked the few minutes to the apartment - wow!  I was told to please contact him with any questions.  Though I brought my own, I noticed a big umbrella in the corner for the 'forgot where you were going' guest.  

The apartment is nice.  It is well stocked and has homey decor.  The view is of the ferris wheel and the Sound (and the Alaska Highway, but that is easily overlooked!) The linens and toiletries are well above average and the kitchen is well stocked (I only used it for tea and leftovers, so I didn't look for much, but everything I needed, I found).  There is also a stackable washer-dryer in the apartment.

The apartment was an easy walk to the conference center and to nearby Pike Place Market.  There are nearby shops and restaurants.  

My mother was hospitalized the day I was to fly to Seattle.  Jones accommodated my request to arrive a day late and refunded my money for the day I was not there.  This was one relief amid a few tough days."
8053396,52798851,2015-11-01,4691749,Amy,"This was a fabulous place to stay. It was near  the Pike Place Public Market, Seattle Art Museum and other downtown Seattle sites. There was no need for a car as you can walk everywhere. The condo faces the water with a fun view of the ferris wheel on the waterfront. Once in the condo you felt at home as it was warm and inviting.  The kitchen was well stocked and there were fresh flowers.  Jones found us reasonable parking across the street.  He met us, took us to the parking and helped carry our luggage to the building.  We will definitely be back to stay here again. Jones was a great host with an inviting place to stay. "
8053396,53211270,2015-11-06,47552426,Mark,"Great location,  great apartment, great host. The unit was clean, stocked and felt like home.  Everything you need is within walking distance. Great view of the water. "
8053396,53258661,2015-11-07,38769649,Jason,perfect location! exactly as advertised. host was very help and super responsive!
8053396,53510422,2015-11-09,3692,Joe,Jones is the kind of guy you can establish rapport and trust with very quickly. He's gracious with his hospitality and is eager to make you feel comfortable in his home base. 
8053396,54927678,2015-11-25,3179610,Dwayne,"This is a great location to explore Seattle from and the place was clean, well stocked and easy to arrange. Recommended."
8053396,54998919,2015-11-27,30234102,Liz,This was the best air bnb I've stayed at.  Felt very welcomed but the host was not overly intrusive.  The apartment was very comfortable with beautiful views and the best location.  I was there for Thanksgiving and felt I could have cooked a really nice meal with all the cookware available as well.  Would highly recommend to anyone visiting Seattle.  
8053396,55797679,2015-12-06,21852441,Annie," This was our first Airbnb experience and it was all we hoped for and more. The apartment was comfortable, tastefully decorated, and had lots of touches that made our home away from home a great place for a week-end Seattle getaway. (There was even a decorated Christmas tree!)
The location was awesome. We were a block from Pike Street Market, the waterfront Ferris wheel, and The Seattle Art Museum. We will definitely stay here again when we return!"
8053396,56054343,2015-12-08,23654632,Daniel,"Perfect apartment for a trip in downtown Seattle. Jones was extremely accommodating and had very good communication. 

The apartment itself is very comfortable and has everything you need. There are even umbrellas right by the door for a typical Seattle rainy day. They came in very useful. The location is steps from the market and the newly cleaned gum wall. There was a pack of bubble gum in the basket of treats to contribute to the new wall. There was a Christmas tree set up and provided a beautiful view with the big wheel in the background. Attention to detail is key.

I will 100% consider staying here again next trip. "
8053396,56509869,2015-12-14,30588362,Steve,"Jones was a great host from the minute I made the reservation to the minute we checked out. He replied quickly to all questions and gave me some great tips on where to go/things to see in Seattle. His condo is located in a prime spot within walking distance to Pike Place, the Aquarium, the Pier, many great restaurants, the Pier and so much more.  His condo was clean, well stocked if we wanted to cook and even provided some bottles of water for us.  He also helped us with an ideal parking location.

We experienced one hiccup during our trip and Jones was on it QUICKLY and had a solution for us and it was fine. 

The only con I can give this rental is the size of the bed. Not sure if it's a queen size bed or a full, but we're used to a king size so it felt cramped.

Overall, I'd stay there again!"
8053396,57657760,2015-12-28,25574869,Annie And Matt,"A wonderful, convenient, clean, bright, fully-accommodated, well-decorated, private, downtown apartment with excellent customer service by the host! Will stay there again, and would highly recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to stay downtown."
2419879,14974325,2014-06-30,15859942,Rich,"The house is in a great location, very close to the Freemont Bridge.  We found the house to be exactly as it was pictured, comfortably sleeping three couples with the convience of two full bathrooms.  Separate living areas provided one space for watching television and another for socializing.  The kitchen was in good working order.
  Sarah and Carsten were prompt responding to our questions before we arrived.  "
2419879,35193035,2015-06-16,15974781,Phyllis,"We were extremely happy with our experience with Sara & Carsten.  It worked out that I was able to stop by and say hello and get a tour the week before our stay.  Sara was very helpful and responsive to any questions throughout our stay.  Carsten was a champ helping us with a TV technical question over the phone.  The beds were extremely comfortable and the kitchen and living areas very homey.
We definitely will look to stay here again if the need arises. "
2419879,35770293,2015-06-22,27979437,Steve,Great experience; house was as advertised; great location in a great neighborhood. Sara was great hostess. Would definitely go back.  
2419879,38282566,2015-07-14,33576805,Shelby,We had an amazing time staying at Sara and carsten's house. They were very detailed in information given and provided an outstanding place to host. Plenty of room in the house for a bigger party of people to stay and sleep comfortably. Very impressed with the kitchen as well. 
2419879,39735962,2015-07-26,29803404,Sheila,Neighbourhood was great!  Was great to have the entire house to ourselves with having small children. Gorgeous home.

2191633,12572961,2014-05-05,5777625,David,"Place was absolutely wonderful and they did a good job communicating everything in advance. Exactly as described, comfortable with the kids. Immaculately clean when we arrived.

Logistics worked wonderfully except for the fact that their checkout instructions made it difficult to get our car (before leaving you have to return a fob which is the only convenient way to get back to the part of the parking garage where our car was--easy to solve, just don't follow instructions).

Team/people/interaction were great other than the 2:00 AM wake-up call we got the day before our reservation."
2191633,15206623,2014-07-04,15694385,Rawson,The reservation was canceled 12 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2191633,16622900,2014-07-30,13484669,Allen,"The location is fantastic and if you compare it to a hotel in this area it is a great deal. Jordan and his team are very accommodating and easy to communicate with - first class all the way. 

The condo is a bit run down. The carpet definitely needs replaced (kind of gross) and it should be noted there is no AC in the building (this is common in Seattle I'm told). There were two portable AC units in the room but they couldn't be run on the same side of the condo or they blew a fuse. 

The location of the condo prevents you from opening the window in the 2nd bedroom because it is right above the grille and it was used quite frequently thus making the condo smell like BBQ. 

The cleaning crew left streamers taped to the wall from the previous guests which made me question the cleanliness of the entire place. 

All in all I'd stay here again but I would have liked to have some additional information prior to my arrival about the AC and the inability to use the windows without smelling up the condo. "
2191633,42349238,2015-08-12,1748547,Atsushi,"Booked this unit for a last minute business trip in Seattle as there were no hotels available.  There were two of us so it was perfect for our needs.  Location was perfect, just a few blocks away from the office and also from Pike Place Market.  Jordan was quick to respond to my questions and the Stay Alfred instructions were very clear and thorough for check-in procedures.  Would definitely consider this unit and other Stay Alfred units in the future. Thanks!"
2191633,49381060,2015-10-03,11623944,Olav,"Awesome unit, great location, no problems at all."
5364609,26969660,2015-02-22,12483392,Rachel,"This apartment was amazing! It is a great amount of space with a super friendly host. Though we did not meet him in person, he was very helpful and thoughtful via message and text. It is in a great location, close to freeways and awesome restaurants. Easy to find, super clean and welcoming, has great views! We had a wonderful time! "
5364609,28335826,2015-03-22,23301474,Jodi,Paul's place is awesome. He sends you every piece of information you could possibly need for enjoying his space and he was very responsive to questions even while he was out of town. Highly recommended!
5364609,29562648,2015-04-09,9793493,Ashley,"What a great stay at Paul's place! The neighborhood is pretty fantastic (grocery store, pretty decent eateries nearby), and Paul was super welcoming. Although he was away, he was easy to get in touch with when I needed to, he checked in as well, and did all he could to make me feel welcome in his space... which is gorgeous. I will totally stay here again if I end up in Seattle again."
5364609,33332181,2015-05-26,28892687,Eric,"Paul's place was lovely to stay at. The place was cozy and well put together. The full sized kitchen was a joy to cook on, and the location was exceptional! Having a place to park our car was another very welcome perk. All things said and done, I would highly recommend Paul's place to anyone visiting Seattle."
5364609,38063450,2015-07-12,14564090,Tyler,"My GF and I really enjoyed Paul's place. It is well located as you can walk, bike or take a quick Uber the 1-2 miles to either Belltown, Seattle center or Capital Hill. We ended up walking all of it and wasn't too big of an issue. There was a grocery store and a few good little restaurants within walking distance as well.

Getting into Paul's building & receiving the keys was very easy. He gives you all the information you need for use of his apartment. While we didn't cook, we very easily could have as it was a nice kitchen with anything you would need to prepare food.

Clean & in a great location with a responsive host, I'd definitely recommend Paul's spot for anyone traveling to the Seattle area.  "
5364609,42566551,2015-08-14,17841330,Jimi,Paul was very accommodating and flexible. We absolutely enjoyed our stay and appreciated his hospitality!
6292452,35670008,2015-06-21,32850549,Flo,"We had a delightful time at this warm and welcoming home.  Their published pictures captured it well.  There was the surprise gift of coffee and scone mix on the table when we arrived (thanks).  
      Our grandson has not had a pet, so he was excited to take care of the cat while we were there.  He had fun feeding and playing with the cat.
      It was also a fun adventure to see how many eggs the chickens had
produced each day.  We all enjoyed the eggs for breakfast each morning.
      The location is excellent with easy access to downtown and tourist 
spots, and a great neighborhood to walk and try local restaurants.

660603,2790924,2012-11-03,923893,Nicholas,"Tricia and Peter are amazing hosts. They're friendly, gracious and very helpful. I was lucky enough to stay with them for almost two months during an extended visit to Seattle. The room itself is fairly small, but the private entrance, private bathroom and the access to the outdoor space make it feel larger.The house is well decorated, Tricia has a great sense of style and it feels like upscale living. Certainly not roughing it in any way. The shared kitchen and common area are large and well lit and it was a fun place to interact with Tricia, Peter and the other house guest.  It's on a quiet street, and there are several good coffee shops within a couple blocks which is great. And it's walking distance to all of the great things Capitol Hill has to offer. Restaurants, bars, cool shops and much more. Overall, I would stay here again in a heartbeat. I was very lucky to find a place this good."
660603,3781997,2013-03-14,4715020,Lulu,Peter and Tricia were great hosts and I would highly recommend staying at their home! They were very welcoming and accommodating. Their home is very clean & comfortable and located in a great neighborhood!
660603,9500715,2013-12-31,3238525,Mark,"Great little place. It's just as the pictures show. And the bed is fantastic. Peter and Tricia were welcoming and basically offered full run of their place (even with a newborn in the house). I didn't need more than the room, though. The private entrance was great as I could come and go without disturbing anyone. Quiet and very clean and uncluttered! A great place for any amount of time."
660603,24079296,2014-12-19,20784545,Rick,"Great Place!!  Very well decorated, comfortable, and all around nice place to stay!!  Peter and Tricia were great hosts; thanks for everything!!! 
"
660603,33914971,2015-06-02,15150884,Joseph,"A very nice room in a great neighborhood. I stayed with Peter and Tricia for four weeks while getting on my feet in Seattle. It was nice to know I had a safe and warm place to come back to in the evenings. I'm a generally quiet person and like to keep to myself, and Peter and Tricia respected that completely, while also offering me advice or a friendly chat when I needed it. There's a Trader Joe's and a Safeway within walking distance, and I also walked just about everywhere in the Capitol Hill area. If I going to travel a little further, I was able to get anywhere I needed to in the city using the bus stop right around the corner. Great place and great hosts!"
660603,35244543,2015-06-16,31948021,Nykia,"Peter and Tricia have a lovely home, and they encouraged me to make myself comfortable. The room was neat and clean, and I especially liked having a private entrance, which allowed me to come and go without intruding upon their space. Public transportation is conveniently nearby, and there is plenty to see and do in the area."
660603,41577726,2015-08-08,2844209,Cathrina,"I loved this place! The photos are definitely accurate -- it's beautifully decorated, comfortable, and spacious for a townhouse. The location was perfect for me (I was in the city for work and moved here from the Central District, where I stayed the month before, and this neighborhood was so much more walkable and green); I walked to work downtown in ~25 minutes every day. Lots of really good restaurants a couple blocks away, plus a Trader Joe's and Central Co-Op within a 5 min. walk. The room itself is small, but I didn't need any more space for myself...plus the bed is great, there's ample closet space, and the bathroom feels clean and new. I'd stay here again in a second if I was returning to Seattle!"
660603,43425861,2015-08-19,15435772,LaTeesha,"Overall a good experience. As most reviews have mentioned the space was small, but there's a closet with hanging space and drawers, so I never felt cramped. Having the private entrance and bathroom were great, made it feel a little more like my own space, rather than staying in someone's home. There's definitely a lack of sound proofing in the house though, so I could always hear what was happening upstairs. I suppose that's only a problem if you're a light sleeper and want to sleep in. "
660603,47637978,2015-09-21,9482220,Alston,I had a wonderful stay with Tricia and Peter! I was there for a full month working at one of the hospitals downtown and I their apartment was perfectly located. It was walking distance from any number of great restaurants in Capitol Hill but their street was still quiet enough that you could relax in peace when you get back to your room. They made me feel very welcome throughout my stay and I enjoyed being a part of the family for my few weeks in Seattle. 
660603,56264788,2015-12-11,10549631,Sean,"Peter and Tricia's home was in a great location, close to a variety of bus routes and stores within walking distance. The house is beautifully decorated and the room is very comfortable. While Peter and Tricia were both away on business during my stay, they communicated with me freqiently and promptly responded to all of my questions by email. They definitely went above and beyond as hosts and I would highly recommend this listing to anyone visiting Seattle."
4240933,28652416,2015-03-28,26706564,Anmeng,"Everything was perfect! Felt like home in Jordan's apartment. It was quite convenient to walk to Pike Market, 5th Street (Monotrail to Space Needle, EMP Museum, Chihuly glass museum, etc.) and many other amazing places to explore."
4240933,32563929,2015-05-19,9807418,Manuela,The apartment was nice and it was just as described. Perfect location and very nice building. Great common areas and beautiful view.

4240933,38504062,2015-07-16,34485403,Michelle,"The apartment as a whole was adequate and very central to where we needed to be. It was clean and spacious. However, I'm disappointed that the second bedroom had no mirror or adequate lighting - it only had a side lamp which made the room very dark. The fold out sofa bed was terribly uncomfortable. Because of this, I'd say it is overpriced."
4240933,39932262,2015-07-27,29584020,Ayla,"There were a lot of Little details that the host payed attention to, which made us feel right at home. We ended up renting two condos because 12 of us came down, in the host was very accommodating. I would recommend stay Alfred to others looking to stay in Seattle"
4240933,42397621,2015-08-13,132750,Hadley,Great location and great facilities. Couldn't ask for more for a stay in downtown seattle!
8027776,46255499,2015-09-08,43469608,Chad,This place was great! Perfectly located in the heart of downtown. My girlfriend and I were able to walk to the waterfront and lots of local shops in the area. The beds were very comfortable and the place was nicely decorated. Just enough space for the two of us. Marianne was very quick to respond with any questions we had about the place. I would absolutely come back.
8027776,46358798,2015-09-09,39134557,Nicholas,The place was in a great location. It was very close to nearby hotspots like the Pike Place market. The apartment was very comfortable and simple. The host was very on top of things and reliable. All in all it was a good experience. 
8027776,46984411,2015-09-14,17959632,Khabrim,Marianne's place suited my needs for 2 days in Seattle.  The location is near some great food spots and in walking distance to the Space Needle if your a tourist.  She left valuable directions for checking in and out of the apartment.  She also accommodate me at the last minute which was great. 
8027776,47313435,2015-09-17,7260642,Jason,"Overall, this apartment is great!  Just the right size for a solo traveler or couple.  The amenities and furnishings suit the space wonderfully and it even has a small washer and dryer for your laundry.  There's even an iron and ironing board - which came in very handy during my business trip.

Marianne is a wonderful communicator and knows the area well!  Her recommendations for food and fun were excellent.

The neighborhood and location are very urban...very fun...with lots of LIFE.  It's also amazingly walkable!  The apartment is walking distance from just about everything...the Link Light Rail (which goes to/from the airport), Pike Place Market, the convention center, the Space Needle, Whole Foods, and so much more.  I really enjoyed walking and exploring Seattle from this apartment!

The kitchen and bathroom are great.  The apartment is air conditioned, though it was cool enough on my trip that I didn't have to use it.  

There are only two things I thought could be improved and one of those is really just a personal preference.  The mattresses are quite a bit firmer than I'd prefer, but that's just my preference.  The second thing is that the apartment is right over 5th Ave - which really isn't a busy street - but there is quite a bit of street noise.  The A/C intake and other windows just don't insulate the apartment well from the noise outside.  This is totally understandable as it is an older building.  I might recommend ear plugs if you're a really light sleeper.

Overall, awesome experience.  Fast internet, great apartment, perfect location!"
8027776,47822552,2015-09-21,27208384,Nikita,"Marianne was a wonderful host! She was quickly available to answer any of my questions. She was even able to accommodate a late night check-in. The unit is in close proximity to just about everything! This place should have a walking score of 100 because you can really walk anywhere (pike place, monorail, restaurants, coffee shops, etc.)  It really made our trip worthwhile! It's a perfect space for a couple and can get a bit noisy at night due to the street noise but nothing we couldn't sleep through. Next time we are back in Seattle (and we will be back) we will definitely be hoping to utilize Marianne's unit.

Nikita"
8027776,47902155,2015-09-21,44307720,Isabel,"My husband and I really enjoyed staying at Marianne's place in Seattle. The studio was very clean, charming, and cozy. The photos are very accurate, might even be nicer in person. Also very well located,  walking distance from great restaurants and cafés right in center of town. We almost wish we were staying in Seattle a bit longer to stay there for a few more nights. Marianne was very helpful and friendly throughout the process. I really appreciated how quickly she responded, her clear communication to make the arrival very smooth, and even gave us some great recommendations for the area. Great experience over all!"
8027776,48337306,2015-09-25,5555507,Joan,"True to its title, Marianne's place was indeed perfectly-located—and that's in addition to being an incredibly comfortable, clean and cozy, with refreshingly minimalist decor. We woke up to beautiful views of Seattle's bustling, tree-lined downtown before our extensive mountain hikes and enjoyed the Netflix access at night. 

Marianne made check in/check out logistics a breeze with
quick/comprehensive communication (Thanks again, Marianne!). 

We're hoping to return sooner rather than later in 2016 :) "
8027776,48586771,2015-09-27,42273992,Laurel,The help and information Marianne provided was so detailed and really easy to follow - a great host.
8027776,49041400,2015-09-30,43694711,Kurt,"Great space in a great neighborhood. Very clean and functional apartment. Quite close to the convention center, Space Needle, and a plethora of restaurant options. Host was extremely helpful and responded quickly to questions. Definitely preferable to a hotel room, and at a lower cost."
8027776,49663633,2015-10-05,43861306,Santiago,"We stayed there 4 night for a conference. We had a really nice stay. the apartment location is unbeatable (very close to downtown), the beds are comfortable, and the apartment is well taken care off. The host was friendly, very responsive, and provided detailed instructions. 
I would happily stay at this place again."
8027776,49936422,2015-10-07,45018903,Lang,We had a pleasant stay at the studio. The location is perfect and Marianne was very attentive and responsive to our questions and requests. Definitely will consider staying here again. And do try to go to the doughnut cafe downstairs. Awesome coffee and a good selection of doughnuts and other snacks. 
8027776,50137245,2015-10-09,2214919,Judy,My sister and I stayed here for two nights and found it very comfortable and convenient.  The one thing we hadn't realized is that it's a third floor walk-up.  Not a problem for us but I thought I'd mention it for those who may have difficulty a lot of stairs.  The donut shop next door is excellent and the neighbors are remarkably quiet.  As others have mentioned you can walk to anything you'd need from this location.  A word of warning if you have a car -  we were able to find street parking pretty easily plus there are several garages near the apartment but be forewarned that parking in Seattle is pretty pricey ($2.50/hour from 8 am - 8 pm).  Marianne also gave us code for a valet car parking service if needed.  We didn't wind up using it but it sounds like pretty cool system.
8027776,50490368,2015-10-12,1996899,Amanda,"Marianne's apartment was just as described and was great for our weekend trip. Check-in and check-out was a breeze, and Marianne was able to accommodate our request for a later check-out, which we really appreciated. The surrounding neighborhood looked to be pretty safe and we didn't have any trouble finding parking for our car. Another bonus, the apartment is an easy walk from downtown Seattle and the light rail to the airport. "
8027776,51479498,2015-10-20,45603914,Valinda,"Our stay was wonderful! Not only was the location perfect walking distance to pretty much everything, but the room was fresh, clean and very welcoming! It was very simple to get the keys and Marianne made sure to check with us that all was well. We loved it! "
8027776,51811294,2015-10-24,46339147,Suzanne,"A definite perfect location to experience Seattle! Access to public transportation easily accessible if your destination is beyond your scope of walking. Amazing grub, coffee, grocery stores, entertainment and shopping all within a block's distance. 

Marianne is a very responsive host that made our stay incredibly easy and amazingly comfortable. No detail is overlooked as far as ""must haves"" to feel at home at her place. Modern, clean -- a refreshing experience. 

Can't wait to come back to Seattle again, enjoy Marianne's place as our ""home base"" and experience her hospitality and generosity!

Thank you, Marianne!

8027776,52369824,2015-10-28,46292314,Nate,"We really enjoyed our time here. The place was in a perfect location for waking to anything downtown. It's a small studio, but if you aren't planning on spending a ton of time inside, it's perfect! Parking was a bit of a challenge but we found the Luxe app to be very helpful. Great experience. "
8027776,52435137,2015-10-29,237776,Emily,"The place is beautiful, clean and well-appointed. It is also located in a great spot, with easy access to many key spots in Seattle. Check in / check out was very easy. Also, Marianne gave very clear and user-friendly instructions / notes."
8027776,52762564,2015-11-01,46886414,Brian,"The place was great! We stayed two nights and Marianne was very accommodating. No in person key exchange, which actually worked in our favor because we were running late for our check-in time. Marianne also was very helpful with suggestions on activities and restaurants in the area. Great location to do anything in the downtown area."
8027776,53096693,2015-11-04,24375255,Brent,Great spot in Belltown. Close to restaurants and it's nice to stop next door for doughnuts in the morning. If available I would definitely recommend staying. Will look again the next time I am coming to town.
8027776,53722555,2015-11-11,4376977,Sophia,"Marianne was so welcoming and made us feel taken care of - she responded to every message lightning fast with ample detail.  We loved her studio - awesome location, very clean, and everything had its place to maximize the space.  The only issue for us at the time was that 2 of the windows wouldn't close all the way, so it was difficult to sleep at night from the street noises and cold air.  I mentioned it to Marianne the next morning and the very next day the window was fixed - awesome!  We will definitely be coming back to stay here the next time we need to be close to downtown Seattle. "
8027776,53788344,2015-11-12,48298298,Penelope,"Marianne was great about getting in touch right away upon booking and was very helpful answering any questions we had.  We were very pleased with how easy the whole process was from start to finish.  The studio was adorable, very well maintained and in a perfect location - less than a 10 minute walk to the pike place market.   Marianne provided exceptional detail to streamline our check in/out process as well as information on house rules, overall accommodations and multiple items available for convenience that you just don't get from a hotel.  We will definitely book with Marianne again on our next trip out to Seattle. "
8027776,54048952,2015-11-15,34757889,Eryleena,We had a great experience and the apartment was very centrally located. Beds were a little more on the firm side but great spot to explore downtown Seattle!
8027776,54266020,2015-11-17,8631871,Emily,Thanks Marianne!! The apartment was the perfect spot for our girls weekend. It was walkable to almost everywhere we wanted and slept all 4 of us extremely comfortably. This was my first Airbnb experience and I will definitely do it again and recommend to all my friends to stay here if they ever come to Seattle. 
8027776,54409653,2015-11-19,32420150,Brad,"I was in town for medical appointments so I didn't really get to take advantage of one of the main features of this location. You can easily walk to so much of what downtown Seattle has to offer. The studio apt is lovely. More than two could stay here but it is super comfy for two. More than the normal amenities are available to you here, kind of all the comforts of home. We took advantage of little, but could see doing so if we were in town for a different reason. We live rurally on 2 and half acres, so we enjoyed the downtown city life for a change. The monorail goes by right outside your window, which is kind of cool. It is not noisy and only goes by in the daytime. We loved the abundance of natural light. Very comfortable bed too!"
8027776,54465765,2015-11-20,6299349,Jacob,"Listing was accurate, neighborhood was great, apartment was comfortable! "
8027776,54561795,2015-11-21,32085436,Lori,"I can't say enough good things about this place and my stay. Marianne was responsive, gave extremely thorough checkin/checkout details, the location is great, and it was immaculately clean. I don't think some hosts know just how much clean towels and sheets are appreciated, but Marianne does. Thanks again! Would definitely stay here again."
8027776,54788925,2015-11-23,1107047,Tavia,"Marianne's apartment is Belltown was perfect for us! The space was clean and beautiful, and was in the perfect location. We had everything we needed and more. The apartment is in a beautiful old building and we felt safe and secure.
The lack of a parking space was not as troublesome as I thought it would be although it did shape our day a little bit on Saturday. I would absolutely book this unit again!"
8027776,54957840,2015-11-25,6839042,Rachel,What a lovely apartment! Great to have the whole space to ourselves. The building itself Felt very safe and the space was very comfortable. Fantastic location close to one of the main attractions - the space needle. Didn't meet Marianne but this was not a problem as she was very helpful and emailed me step by step instructions about check-in and information about the apartment. I would have extended my stay but unfortunately there was no availability!! 
8027776,55421239,2015-12-01,16899619,Xiao,"We were staying here over Thanksgiving and everyone was satisfied. The studio is in good condition, clean and warm, and well supplied with kitchenware and toiletries. Space Needle and Pike Place are within comfortable walking distance and there are some grocery stores that open until late night. Marianne is very welcome and helpful. She's always ready for questions and is very quick to respond. Overall it was an outstanding experience."
8027776,55469124,2015-12-01,48801520,Curtis,"Place was very clean and the directions couldn't have been easier. Marianne was quick when responding to emails and very kind. 

Great experience. "
8027776,56273723,2015-12-11,12222410,Jillian And Jamil,"Excellent and clean studio apartment! Very convenient location near Westlake station. Neighborhood is safe to walk at night and lots of amenities nearby. Just a heads up this is a downtown apt. Due to old single pane glazing and adjacent busy street and monorail, it can be a bit noisy at night. Noise is not excessive, but ever present."
8027776,56625365,2015-12-15,39880829,Denise,"Marianne's cozy apartment was perfect for our short trip to Seattle! She was friendly and responsive immediately upon my inquiry, and sent a thorough, easy to follow ""welcome"" email with clear instructions & information about getting in and around the apartment. The building itself is very clean, safe, and centrally located to Pike Place, the Space Needle, various restaurants and shops, not to mention next door to a delicious and adorable donut shop! The apartment is exactly as pictured, is clean & comfortable for the 2 of us, although 1 or 2 more could have stayed comfortably as well. There is good wifi connection, TV/netflix, comfy bed, kitchen with supplies & washer/dryer (although we did not utilize these), clean towels & sheets, basically everything we needed for our stay. The only things to be aware of is that this a 3rd floor walk up, which I had failed to realize initially; it isn't a dealbreaker or even a big deal at all, just a heads up if you have a piece or two of heavy luggage like we did. Also there is some regular ""city traffic"" type noises throughout the night, which I think is to be expected, given the location. It wasn't a big deal for us, but might be for some lighter sleepers. Overall, this place was perfect for us, Marianne is a perfect host, and I would gladly stay again and recommend to others! "
8027776,57690027,2015-12-28,50461407,Rebecca,This apartment was adequately perfect for our needs during our visit to Seattle.  The apt was exactly as described.  Thanks so much!
8027776,57966796,2015-12-30,51743735,Amalia,"This was my first airbnb experience, my boyfriend who was with me has used airbnb before and always has been happy so I decided to check it out. The space was awesome and right in the middle of everything. Pictures are right on but it was cleaner and more cheerful then the pictures show. We walked to pikes place, downtown, the space needle and to many of restaurants from the room. It was perfect for what we needed! Also just a $5 uber ride to any of the attractions!"
8027776,58243837,2016-01-01,52564072,Caroline,"Great place! Awesome location, cute kitchen, and perfect amount of bed space!"
8027776,58629466,2016-01-03,16109796,Isabelle,"Marianne is an excellent host! Very quick to respond to messages and is very helpful in planning our stay in Seattle. Such a cute studio apartment too!
We loved the neighbourhood. Everything was within walking distance and we loved using Seattle's app valet service to park our car instead of worrying about street parking. Top pot doughnuts right next door are to die for! We loved the salted caramel.
I can't say enough good things about this apartment and the city of Seattle. Really looking forward to recommending this spot to friends and family.  Thank you for an excellent experience Marianne!"
8103365,51547982,2015-10-21,4948998,Jim,"Trace was very accommodating. He wade sure everything was well thought out and gave us some great info on places to check out. I wish we had time to use the bikes because we enjoyed a great location to get out and ride.  

The place was just as described. Great Views! The rooftop deck was perfect for afternoon wine and cheese. Every place we visited was in close walking distance and there was just too much to see in the short five days we were there. We did not even need a rental car. The bus and light-rail was easy to navigate.

It was nice to sleep with the sliding door open but we are in the city so there is a little noise to get use to. Otherwise, it was all perfect and we will definitely come back another time.

Thanks Trace. Go Seahawks!"
3544550,37071418,2015-07-04,34949501,Anissa,"Staying in Jill's home was a great experience. The house is absolutely beautiful, there was plenty of room for my 8 person group, and she even left us wine and chocolate to make us feel welcome. Queen Anne is a beautiful neighborhood and we really got to experience some of the best views in the city both from the home and the neighborhood. Thank you so much Jill!"
3544550,37862813,2015-07-11,15573225,Rebecca,"The views from this house are breathtaking. 

The house itself is incredibly comfortable and was a nice walk from where we were working for the week. We would recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing space. "
3544550,39489638,2015-07-24,31910444,Steve,Exactly as described and a view to die for!
3544550,39769427,2015-07-26,33666455,Erin,Overall we had an excellent experience in the house - it was just beautiful and perfect for a relaxing summer weekend. The kitchen is lovely and ideal for cooking.
3544550,40731354,2015-08-02,25534495,Yong,Beautiful house overlooking Puget sound.  Great neighborhood.  Jill also made us feel like home.  Highly recommended.

3544550,45396753,2015-09-02,37247192,Kenji Chris,"Great cozy little house in a lovely neighborhood close to downtown. Great view especially from the little park in walking distance. Jill was professional and the check in/check out went smoothly as well.

Hope you enjoy it"
6543683,35883550,2015-06-22,35998045,Amy,"Our hosts were very polite and friendly without being intrusive. The neighborhood is gorgeous and in a very convenient location. The house was beautiful and very clean. The sheets were super soft. It felt like they thought of everything! They provided bathrobes in our room and stocked the mini-fridge with drinks, yogurt, etc. Breakfast was simple and delicious.

The only thing to note is that sometimes there are other guests, and (at least of this writing) the sunporch off this room is a shared space. It wasn't an issue for us, but it's worth mentioning.

Saturday night, my bf and I made the mistake of parking in a garage that closed at 10 p.m. :( We took a cab back to the house, and the next morning our host was gracious enough to drive us downtown so we could fetch our car. We thought that was very generous of them, and we very much appreciated it!

I would absolutely recommend staying here. Cody was fantastic about providing quick, clear communication throughout the entire experience from pre-booking to checkout."
6543683,37427692,2015-07-06,26029118,Paul,"This house is very beautiful, and has a very nice ambiance. The hospitality was excellent, and parking was easily found nearby. While you'll need transportation to access most things in the area, there is a beautiful park about a block away and its in a nice residential neighbourbood.
Top notch accomodation - thank you!"
6543683,38202227,2015-07-13,7761091,Jitendra,"I booked Cody's place for my friend who visited Seattle this summer during a weekend. Here is what he has to say about his stay at Cody's :-

It was really nice to stay at Cody's place. The place has nice feeling of old British days. Rooms are  full of nice and comfy furniture. It was very easy to get to the place and parking was easy. The dead end on the side of the apartment makes it a safe and convenient place to park a car!  Cody and his mother were gracious hosts with welcoming smile. The bed room was nice and well kept.  It had most of the things like shaving cream that a traveler needs. 
Cody's mom prepared nice breakfast and kitchen was full of fruits to grab anytime. I would highly recommend Cody's place to anyone visiting Seattle."
6543683,38788755,2015-07-18,1450328,Adam,"Cody was terrific.  Very fast responses to all my emails, including a delayed arrival (I didn't get in until close to 11).  The room was as described.  Very accommodating to my busy schedule in Seattle.  Good public transportation access to downtown."
6543683,39085177,2015-07-20,12812458,Steven,"I had a great stay with Cody in Seattle. The house is in a great and easy to access location and the house is beautiful. Cody was incredibly accommodating and helped me have a great stay. It was great to have a nice place to go back to at the end of the night. 

I absolutely recommend staying here if you're going to be in Seattle."
6543683,39465146,2015-07-23,35478869,Barbara,"I just loved to stay at Cody and his mum's place!It was the nicest place ever,and above that,they fill their house with warmth and love and you just feel completely at home.Everything was decorated in the nicest way,and there was always fruits,coffee,cookies and more to drink and eat.And as I have told Cody's mum,I will miss her delicious breakfasts that she served me every morning.Cody and his mum are not only people that you are just happy to meet,they are both also extremely helpful and kind,with whatever you need.I hope I will be back soon :-)"
6543683,40489083,2015-07-31,37946344,Liangjiao,My wife and I had a great time staying with Cody and his mom.  They were very accommodating with our late arrivals and we felt very much at home during our stay. Cody's mom made the best croissants for breakfast!  The location is excellent with parking and easy access to public transportation. The room is clean and comfortable.
6543683,40808580,2015-08-02,38601450,Effieyu,"That's a super amazing experience. The house is very nice, you can see from every details. Rosalyn(hope I spell it right) who is a beautiful, kind and caring lady maintaining a really beautiful garden. The bed is very comfortable. She prepared us a lot of drinks and fruits, and rich breakfast everyday. Cody is also a very smart young man, still studying in college. Hope everything going on well to you both.

The house is very clean and tidy, there are always drinks, snacks, cookies and fruits available, and the breakfast was excellent.
He and his mum were very sweet and accommodating, they really made me feel at home.

I highly recommend staying here, everything was spot on."
6543683,42361687,2015-08-12,28024193,Patrick,Cody was a great host. I would definitely stay at his house again. 
6543683,42610841,2015-08-14,40633564,Julian,Cody and his mom were so welcoming. They waited until I arrived at 10.30 pm. The room was comfortable and warm. It was lovely having breakfast in the sun room. It was a brilliant first time experience for me. 
6543683,42981340,2015-08-16,35004692,Carmen,We are so glad we found this gem in Seattle. Cody and his mom are so kind and thoughtful.  The bed is super comfy and the house has so much charm.  They are centrally located so that you can get to all the fun stuff to do in Seattle.   I highly recommend them and hope to stay here again someday.
6543683,44053700,2015-08-23,2188537,Abhinav,The place was perfect. Cody's mom ensured that everything that a guest needs is taken care of. The breakfast in the morning was beautiful. Would highly recommend to any traveller visiting Seattle!

Not only was theirs a well-kept house, quiet and located in a great area, every morning we woke up to a beautiful breakfast set up by Rosalie. It was much more than we expected and that made it perfect."

286712,1320925,2012-05-21,2318258,Roya,"Galina is very kind, friendly and flexible. She has a very nice place. It is very spacious and the townhouse was surprisingly very private feeling since it was off of the street and had a private fenced back yard. I would definitely recommend her place to future renters. It's a great deal and a beautiful home!"
286712,1453891,2012-06-11,1776867,Pedro,"great place to stay close to downtown. groceries stores a block away. very clean place, lots of room for a family. loved the place. downtown is about 10 min driving & to take the bus is a block away. starbucks is very close. as a sport fanatic, is very very close to a mariners & seahawks stadiums. very quiet neighbors around the place. i really recommend this place for any occasion. "
286712,1675297,2012-07-10,1896201,Rachel,"The townhouse was clean, spacious, and perfect for the family members who came to for our wedding. The location was very convenient, as well. Excellent backyard and kitchen."
286712,1827125,2012-07-29,2421581,Rachel,"I chose this house for 3 reasons, it had plenty of bedrooms and bathrooms to accommodate my adult large family, it was close to the bus line, and it appeared to have adequate cooking and dining facilities.  The first 2 expectations were accurate, but we were disappointed to find that there was no dining table , and the kitchen area is much smaller than it appears in the photos, making it difficult for us to sit down for a meal together or use the table for group activities. People should be aware there is no television.  The garden in the rear of the townhouse is lovely!"
286712,1899319,2012-08-06,2469424,Mitchell,"Nice, well-kept, clean and completely as advertised.  Nearby Starbucks and grocery store was a plus.  Easy drive to Pike Place Market."
286712,1920231,2012-08-07,2989859,Genya,"We had a great stay. When we had a late night question related to the townhome Galina responded to our telephone call promptly and was very flexible about check out times. Everything was clean and ready to go when we got there. Finding the door and entering the code at night was a little tricky, but aside from that everything went really well.   "
286712,2043907,2012-08-20,565446,Katrina,"Galina was great!  So sweet and the place was perfect for us.  Three of us stayed and we loved having our own bathrooms and a place to cook!  Luxury! :)  It was so convenient to have the keypad--I want to get one for my door!  It meant that we didn't have any problems with figuring out who should take the key and could come and go as we pleased. The only thing that was tough was having to do the laundry at the end. It took longer than we thought it would (we didn't want the red sheets to bleed onto the white, so ended up doing three loads the morning we were leaving).  With other hosts I've just stripped the beds and left the sheets, and wished we didn't have to do laundry at the end. "
286712,2189973,2012-09-04,1164598,Markus,"We had an awesome stay!
The neighborhood is quiet, the house was clean. We really loved the room layout, it was perfect for our group. Location was excellent. There is a small shopping area with a Starbucks in walking distance. And a bus stop with the 14 going directly into downtown/convention center.

Galina is a great host, always responsive, all instructions were spot on. "
286712,2252287,2012-09-10,763614,Dan,Galina's place was wonderful for our group visiting Seattle for a wedding. The townhouse was perfect four the six of us. Access was super convenient and it was central to all of the places we needed to go!
286712,2313262,2012-09-17,3336238,Kendra,"We had a bit of a mishap with Galina's place: her cleaning service didn't actually clean it before we arrived. There was a lot of rotting food in the kitchen, which was pretty unsettling. We called and messaged Galina and she was quick to respond, and sent her cleaning service back to check on the house later that day. They folded the towels in the living room but didn't remove any of the rotting food, yet she told Galina that she had already cleaned the house. We messaged back and forth, and the next day Galina sent a friend to remove a box a rotting bread sitting in the kitchen. She also offered to reimburse our cleaning fee and pay for half of the first night's stay, and she was very apologetic about the entire incident.

Other than that, the place was wonderful and perfect for me and my friends from college. There were 8 of us in the house and with couches, beds and floor sleeping, we all slept comfortably. She has a lovely modern kitchen and is close to the Captiol Hill neighborhood and downtown Seattle. Galina was courteous and prompt to respond to our messages."
286712,2393577,2012-09-24,1347189,Katy,"Galina's house was very clean and had plenty of extra towels and bedding for our large group.  Her home was as adverstised and as spacious as it appeared in the photos.  

Galina was a bit hard to get a hold of by email but was very responsive by phone and texting.  

Definately worth the cost.  "
286712,2487748,2012-10-02,3552193,William,"My friends and I enjoyed our stay for five days at Galina's place. The house was clean, nice, and well setup to cook. There is a grocery store and other shops within a close walking distance. Galina was easy to communicate with and quick to respond to any of my questions.

The only issue we had was difficulty finding cabs in the area. The bus system ended up being easier much of the time. Using the Uber app to get a car was much more effective than calling Yellow Cab."
286712,5117483,2013-06-13,3973818,Heather Paula,"When we arrived the place was a bit of a mess due to some long term tenants not cleaning as promised. Though a bit of a disappointment, Galina was remarkable in responding quickly; she sent someone to clean the next morning, and even sent a (website hidden) delivery of supplies like sponges, soap, etc. The townhouse is lovely, with a cute backyard, easy parking, and enough space to sleep a lot of people comfortably. One of the bedrooms has a futon couch/bed which is as comfortable as to be expected. As long as you know, and come prepared for it, it's just fine. There is a grocery store and starbucks within walking distance, and a Trader Joe's an easy drive away. Overall a great experience!"
286712,5315882,2013-06-24,6355390,Kurt And Susan,"For our group of 3 couples staying 2 nights in Seattle, this newish 3 story townhouse worked very well.  Two bedrooms (one Queen, one full futon) are on the top floor, one (Queen) is on the lower.  All have full ensuite bathrooms.  Kitchen, dining & living rooms, half bath + laundry occupy the middle floor.  The kitchen is compact but adequately outfitted for simple cooking. There is a full size refrigerator, gas range, microwave but no dishwasher.  Seating for 6 for dining: table for 4, plus 2 (email hidden)e one car garage was tricky to get into with our Kia Optima rental.  Street parking on the block was generally easy to find.  Grocery, drugstore, Starbucks, restaurants & bus stops easy to walk to.  We needed to contact our host two times about the rental:  3 days before we arrived to get the entry code, and at the property when we could not figure out how to lock the front door from the outside.  We were not successful communicating with the host by email; it seemed to work best to leave a phone message to which she responded promptly.  We would definitely stay here again when we come to Seattle.                    "
286712,5995280,2013-07-25,7561693,Darren,The house was nice and clean when we arrived.  Galina was very responsive and answered all our questions beforehand.  Getting in and out of the place was easy.  One thing we didn't care for too much was paying a $150 cleaning fee when we had to do the cleaning of the towels and sheets.  That wasn't received very well from the parents.  Also the security code doesn't always get changed so if you are the paranoid type you may ask ahead to make sure it can get changed from the last people that stayed there.  Other than that we loved it.  It was very spacious and was in line with hotel prices around the area.  If you are okay with the things I mentioned I'd definitely recommend it!
286712,6319050,2013-08-08,5680406,Shannah,"We were a group of six friends (2 couples + 2 singles) travelling to Seattle for four nights and were very pleased with our stay at Galina's townhouse. We would definitely stay there again! 

When we first arrived we were a little concerned about how far the location was from the attractions (Pike Place Market, Shopping District, etc) but it was a very quick cab ride - about $10-12 each way. There is a grocery store and Starbucks down the street which were very convenient. 

For the six of us, we thought the townhouse was enough space, though I wouldn't want to go with a bigger group, and we had only minor concerns: 
- Someone over 6' tall won't be too comfortable sleeping in the downstairs bedroom (the bed is a little short) 
- The kitchen is a tight to have two people cooking 
- It would have been nice to have a TV or radio, but we managed without 
- There isn't a toaster or regular coffee maker but enough variety of pots & pans for the cooking we did 

We enjoyed sitting in the backyard (there are only three lawn chairs in the downstairs closet though) and having the code lock was very convenient because when someone wanted to go back to the townhouse we didn't have to coordinate who would have a key.  Also, the three and a half bathrooms were awesome for our large group. 

A note on other reviews: 
- We didn't notice the airport noise mentioned by another reviewer 
- The large capacity washing machine and dryer made laundry very quick 
- There is a dishwasher 
- We fit a Ford Escape in the garage 

All in all, we thought it was a great place to stay. I would recommend it to anyone travelling to Seattle."
286712,6367900,2013-08-10,2214163,Heather,"My real rating for this place is a 3.5, but you can't do half stars on Airbnb...

A little bit about our party - there were 6 of us, a mix of immediate family, cousins, and Uncles/Aunts, adults and young adults.

Pros
- The house is located a little over a mile outside downtown Seattle with a bus route nearby (though we ended up walking/taking a car in each time)
- Galina's house is clean and extremely modern with granite counter tops and stainless steel appliances
- There are 3 bathrooms (two of them have showers), which was really nice in the morning while we were all getting ready
- Galina is quick to respond to any issues or questions. For example, the air mattress at the place had a huge hole in it. After I called her about it, she had a replacement dropped off the same day for us.

Cons
- The place says it sleeps 9 people, but I find that to be a bit inflated. There are 3 full/queen beds, 1 queen blow up air mattress, and a couch. To fit 9 people you would have to have 2 people on each bed, 2 people on the air mattress, and 1 on the couch. With 6 people it was even tight, just because there was only one couple in our party and it wasn't really appropriate for the others in our party to share beds.
- If you do have to blow up the air mattress, you will lose the functionality of the living room, as that is the only room with ample space to fit the blow up.
- The driveway and garage are really tight. We had a rental minivan and it wouldn't fit in the garage.

For the most part we had a great experience, but the deceiving sleeping accommodations were unfortunate. I would say this place could comfortably sleep 4-6. But only do 6 if there are multiple couples in your party. "
286712,6556241,2013-08-17,6666007,Bruno,"The house is smaller than it looks, but OK for 4-6 people. The bed quality is poor except the one in the master bedroom and the neighborhood is not as nice as some other affordable places in Seattle.
This said, the biggest problem is SEATAC airport close approach: be prepared to count planes at the rhythm of one every 60-90 sec. In the silence of the night, these planes are very noisy and since the windows are not double-glazed ...
Brief, we are far from the promised ""great location"". "
286712,6853206,2013-08-27,7656933,Andrew,Great location. Close to all Seattle sites. We had sufficient room for 9 and having three bathrooms was great. Very clean and ready for us. Thank you.
286712,7005598,2013-09-03,5962190,Amanda,"The space is much tighter then anticipated. Though it is possible to house up to 9 tenants, but in my opinion I believe that it would be much more comfortable with a maximum of 6 (We had a total of 8). Small cars should be able to fit in the garage, did not wish to attempt with our truck to confirm however. The street is fairly tight and crowed during most of the day, but there usually is at least some places where you can park otherwise.
The location of the townhouse is a little bit hidden as it is behind another townhouse, so it is not easily noticed at first from the street. Like noted by previous tenants, it is fairly close to a small shopping area where you can purchase groceries, go to Starbucks, restaurants and cafes, and various other small stores. Please note that if you do wish to go to larger shopping areas that you will need to either drive or taxi around. 

My party and I found our stay to be decent, though we found that the place was not as cleanly as we had expected it to be. One of the major areas was the bathroom, as we needed to buy drain-o, as a large majority of the drains were clogged prior to our arrival. "
286712,7755057,2013-10-01,6505464,Joel,"Place is great, very modern, and clean. We slept 5 very comfortably. 9/10 would stay again"
286712,8100874,2013-10-15,9234199,Anna,"We had a really nice time there. The house was very clean and looked really nice. Although it was a bit small for 8 people, we enjoyed our stay. The garage is pretty small but you can park on the street in front of the house. "
286712,8381467,2013-10-28,8516406,Bobby,"Galina was very pleasant and the experience, overall, was good. The condo is much smaller than you might think; that's not a bad thing, just don't think you can easily sleep 8. Unless your group is filled with couples, don't expect more than space for 4. The neighborhood is fine; don't let people scare you off about it. 

The bottom line is: the place is fantastic for the price, the owner is kind and helpful, and if you're visiting Seattle to explore and discover (ie. not spending the majority of your time inside the place), I couldn't suggest it any higher than I do. "
286712,13569672,2014-05-31,14130610,Kyle,Had a wonderful stay.The house was very clean. It was also in a nice walking distance form many different things.
286712,19785701,2014-09-18,6734346,Scott,"The house was exactly as described. Galina was awesome about responding to any questions quickly.  The place was very clean and we found it slept nine quite comfortably (one was on the couch).  Although we had four couples, so sharing beds wasn't a problem. 

The kitchen is a good size and has everything you need, and the three levels made it feel like we all had our own space.

The location is nice, close to public transit (which was needed to get downtown), and there is a large supermarket and pharmacy really close.  The area feels safe as well.

There's no TV, not that we had much time to watch one anyway."
286712,21801662,2014-10-24,17146007,Steve,"Galina was very responsive, and access was easy.  The home was neat, clean and well furnished.  Great to have three separate bedrooms with their own baths.  The home is on a nice block that feels safe, although the broader neighborhood is very urban and varied.  Worked great for three colleagues on a business trip.  We'd do it again."
286712,21970726,2014-10-27,22013963,Darrow,"Galina made it super easy to come and stay at her place.     It was a comfortable standalone carriage house, well located to access the many cool areas of Seattle.  It was maybe a little tight for nine of us (but, seriously, what place wouldn't be!).  And it was a great, affordable way to be able to stay in one place with other friends attending a wedding.  "
286712,22291342,2014-11-03,8994792,Dawn,"Galina's place was very beautiful and clean. It accommodated all 9 of us perfectly, although we did bring an extra air mattress that we used. Her place was only 10 minutes away from downtown. I would highly recommend staying with her."
286712,26241468,2015-02-08,1350159,Asra,Host was easy to communicate with-very nice and accommodating. We stayed for 6 weeks with 2 kids and it was a great temporary stay set up. Large enough space and rooms for all 4 of us. Location was central and easy to get around from.
286712,32009919,2015-05-12,12935346,Chris,"the place was in an excellent location, and everything was neat and clean. the backyard was nice as well. the host was also very accomodating and flexible towards our arrival times!"
286712,41914964,2015-08-10,24897795,Niraj,"The house that we stayed at this summer was amazing, it definitely matched the picture description that we were given and the location was accurately described. I stayed with 3 other people for about 3 months and the place was definitely homey and big enough for all of us. Galina was a great host and if we ever had any issues, I could just text her and she would come to the house and take care of the problem. I would definitely recommend staying here if you want to be close to downtown!"
286712,42575653,2015-08-14,2914241,Jonathan,"The townhouse was very spacious and comfortable and comfortably slept all 8 of us during our stay. The location was perfect, 15 minutes from downtown Seattle, 20 minutes to downtown Bellevue and there are grocery stores and restaurants nearby.

Galina was a great host and she was very responsive with all my questions.

The townhouse does have a quite a few steps, the living room is situated on the second floor and all the bedrooms require walking two flights of stairs. So it was not as accessible as we would have liked for my grandparents.

Overall, the place is very well furnished and a great place to stay for a visit to Seattle!"
286712,43952420,2015-08-23,37043849,Kim,"Galina's house was great for me and my coworkers. Quiet, clean, and convenient; I would absolutely stay here again!"
286712,45243674,2015-09-01,20948380,Tu,"Very clean.  Seemed Quiet.  Close to downtown. There are 3 floors, lots of stairs, would be difficult for the elderly.  The garage is a little difficult to get in and out of due to the lay out, so street parking is preferred.  The Townhouse is hidden behind another townhouse.  Her number on airbnb was wrong, it was to some company called ""Pillow"" that used to own this listing.  She was very accommodating once we were able to get a hold of her.  There are 3 double real beds and 1 double inflatable bed.   We brought 2 extra air beds and were able to sleep 8 people with only 2 people having to share a bed and one on the couch.  The wifi has a difficult time handling 8 people trying to stream stuff at once since there's no tv."
286712,46147293,2015-09-08,39071990,Matt,Great house for our group.  We had two couples and two single friends heading to the west coast for a wedding.  Having 3 bathrooms was a huge help when everyone was getting ready.  Galina's house was in an easy location to uber around the city and out to points east (wineries!).  The house is clean and modern and had everything we needed.
286712,46942203,2015-09-14,42077865,Tyler,"Wow! I cannot say enough good things about Galina and her beautiful home! The townhouse is actually quite spacious and very easily sleeps 9 people with the really nice air bed. The location is amazing and the neighborhood is quiet and right around the corner from shopping, coffee, and restaurants and about 5 minutes to freeway access. The property itself was great, but what really made our stay was what an amazing hostess Galina was. She always replies to any questions very quickly and has excellent communication. She went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable. When someone accidentally turned on the heater and we couldn't figure out how to turn it off, she came by and did it for us. And then, when our weekend event went longer than expected she accommodated our team by allowing us a later checkout. Polite, friendly, accommodating, and an A+++ hostess! Would recommend to my friends and stay with her anytime."
286712,47962621,2015-09-22,8629424,Kit,We had a fantastic stay here! The space was clean and spacious and our party of 9 fit perfectly! 
286712,51569553,2015-10-21,45932247,Doug,Working with Galina was a good experience.  She was very responsive and helped answer every question we had.  We liked the location and the neighborhood.  It was very clean and comfortable.  I just wish it had a TV for relaxing in the evenings.
286712,53559925,2015-11-09,11217275,Jessica,"We never met Galina. The property is managed by TurnKey. Which was confusing. They asked for me to send a photo of my drivers license for verification even though i am verified through AirBnb with several reviews and references. 

Initial confusion aside, the neighborhood is quiet with ample parking. The house is nice, they fit a lot of stuff into a small space, which is impressive; there are 3 bathrooms! The small yard out back was a nice retreat.   "
8501721,52600918,2015-10-31,44390048,Katie,"I stayed in the one bedroom for about two and a half weeks. Lovely town house in a quiet, pretty neighborhood. Close to bus routes, so it's easy to get downtown. The room has a big closet and a nice bathroom. Comfortable living area and kitchen downstairs! Overall great experience and a friendly, accommodating hostess! "
2068301,10872171,2014-03-10,7686250,Karen,"My husband and I came to the city to celebrate my birthday and absolutely loved our stay here!  Holly is a great host and even accommodated a last minute booking / late check-in.  The condo was amazing and had a fun and trendy vibe to it.  The best part was it's location in the heart of Belltown...easily within walking distance of several attractions like the Space Needle, Pike Place Market and tons of great restaurants.  Plenty of street parking.  Secured entry into the building.  This place has it all!  "
2068301,12034378,2014-04-21,1253005,Dominic,"This place is so true to the description. My girlfriend and I loved staying here. It's accessible to all parts of the city. And if you don't feel like traveling far there are plenty of bars, restaurants and other fun stuff close by.

Holly was very accessible and full of awesome suggestions. She was helpful and made things easy. She does an incredible job of making you feel like a guest."
2068301,13434329,2014-05-27,2451371,Jessica,"Holly's apartment is super well located. There are  a lot of bars and restaurants near by and it is close to Seattle's main attractions. We enjoyed a lot our stay there, so I highly recommend this place."
2068301,14094454,2014-06-11,15692808,Alexandra,"Holly ' s place was our first go at AirBNB and we were pleasantly surprised!  Her studio itself, her building and her location were awesome! Very easy and professional check in and out process. Her recommendations were dead on. The neighborhood was great, neighbors we met on the open patio in the 7th floor were friendly and helpfuk (including the big Grey and white cat who hangs out in the morning)!! Walking distance to everything you want to see! ! It was an authentic Seattle experience.Loved it!"
2068301,14402374,2014-06-18,15582324,Brett,"Great apartment, great location... Holly (and Kathy) were quite helpful and had some excellent recommendations. Checking in and out was straightforward and seamless. Very highly recommended!"
2068301,14743811,2014-06-25,7078940,Courtney,"This apartment was great!  And the location was Fantastic!  Holly was out of town while I was there, so I didn't get to meet her in person, but our email exchanges were really helpful and informative in preparing for my trip, and Kathy - who we picked up the keys from - was super attentive and had the place ready for our arrival.  I would definitely stay here again!"
2068301,16375978,2014-07-26,227252,Swapna,"I stayed at Holly's place for a week in July. The apartment is cozy and was as described. There is a fair amount of outdoor noise due to proximity to the freeway, but this was only a problem on hotter days, when I had to leave the windows at night to cool off from the summer heat. Noise will likely not be an issue for travelers visiting during cooler months."
2068301,17009630,2014-08-05,18277169,Ryan,"My wife and I could not have been more pleased about the accommodations at Holly's apartment. The apartment felt cozy and was clean and Holly had left a number of notes around the place to direct us through anything that might have been difficult to handle (aka strangely designed sliding door) and a welcoming packet that answered pretty much any question that we came up with during our stay.

The location was amazing (0.7 miles from the Space Needle, 0.9 miles from Pike Market) and street parking was abundant. We would definitely stay again.

Quick note about summer visits: It's apparently in a thing in Seattle that most apartments/condos do not have A/C. Holly provided a number of fans that were very helpful in keeping us comfortable during our stay."
2068301,17227557,2014-08-09,18280193,Nadezhda,"holly's place was just as described and pictures are accurate, it is perfectly located near pike market and space needle and olympic park.
I have not meet Holly in person but checking in was easy and she gave detailed description of how to get there. One thing which was unfortunate for us that it easa a heat wave in seattle when we were there and as many bilding there it does not have AC. holly was very helpful and she left two fans running for us but i had to leave the balcony door open at night to be able to sleep. the appartment is near the highway and with open door it very nosy and first night was difficult but hot days in Seattle almost never happend and with closed windows it is fine and nobody should have any problem. but location is perfect and i would gladly stay there again. 
Nadia"
2068301,17857581,2014-08-18,391453,Chris,"We loved staying at Holly's. Great, walkable neighborhood that provided great access to Seattle. The studio is just like the pictures and Holly herself was communicative and easy to deal with. Recommended."
2068301,18806795,2014-09-01,10979482,Kevin,Holly was a great host. Everything was easy. Her place was clean and we could not ask for a better location. My only minor complaint is that her mattress was hard but other than that it was a very pleasant experience!
2068301,21618185,2014-10-20,3202374,Yu,"We had a great stay at Holly's studio apt and highly recommend it to anyone. The apartment is exactly as pictured from the AirBnb images. It was clean, spacious and tastefully decorated. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect location. It was walking distance to Pike Place, good restaurant spots, the Space Needle but just far away enough that street parking was affordable ($1.50/hr versus $3.50/hr closer to downtown). We rented a car and was able to find street parking without breaking the bank."
2068301,24561019,2014-12-30,6239984,Sara,"Holly's place was just what my boyfriend and I expected - clean, bright, hip and in the right neighbourhood. We had a great time walking around Belltown and enjoying some of the places Holly recommended, but were also able to access other neighbourhoods in the city with a quick bus ride or a walk. The place is very accessible and Holly is very easy to connect with. I would definitely stay here again. "
2068301,24973155,2015-01-04,11266278,Peter,"Holly's apartment was great! Perfect location in Seattle within walking distance of Pikes Place and Seattle Center. The apartment was well equipped and exactly as described online. Didn't get to meet Holly, but she got back to me quickly over email and text."
8050232,45868324,2015-09-06,9353961,Francisco Javier,"Unfortunately, I did not have a good experience with this host and apartment. 
First of all, Chase responded all messages on time and seemed opened to arrange details to make the hosting work and was sort of flexible with checking in and checking out times. However, the apartment it is not a place I would ever go again.
I was supposed to meet Chase at his work to get the keys on the arrival day, he did not show up at the time we were supposed to meet.  I spoke to his coworker who offered to help, fortunately he got in touch with him because he was not answering my messages and turned out that he was not there. Then, Chase sent a friend who arrived 30 minutes later to bring the keys. Finally, we were taken to the place and the friend told us that they were not expecting us to arrive that day, that they confused the dates.
Once we got to the place, the apartment was dirty and dusty. That  living room floor and washroom floor really need to be cleaned. There was just a couple dirty blankets with weird stains on the bed and there was not even a complete bed sheet set. It was definitely not a bed I felt comfortable sleeping in. I was told that there was going to be an air mattress as well, but we could not find the pump to inflate it and it was kind of dusty. In the washroom, there was not hot water for taking a shower and the floor mat was gross. In addition, the garbage bins in the apartment were half full.
Unfortunately, I did not have a good experience in this apartment, the location was good though. You can go everywhere walking from that place but the fact that the host did not get the dates right, he did not showed up on time to bring the keys, and how dirty the apartment was, made the overall experience not good. We stayed there for a single night and we could not wait to leave next day. It is not a place a would come back or recommend."
8050232,47218965,2015-09-16,21617141,Britt,"Chase was attentive and helpful, coordinating a time and location to exchange keys, even when I moved out earlier than I originally communicated. The apartment itself is pretty minimal but in a great location for a decent price. I booked last minute and only really needed a place to store my things and rest my head so all in all it worked out great. Thanks!"
8050232,47420230,2015-09-18,17843519,Laura,"This is an okay place to stay if you just want somewhere to crash for a night, but I don't think it's worth the money you're paying. The bed is comfortable, it's in a really fun area, and it seems like a safe building. However, the bathroom is pretty dusty and there was a lot of trash left in the trash can. These are things I can deal with if I'm crashing with someone who is doing me a favor and I'm staying for free. But I think part of paying money for a space is that these aspects are comfortable as well, so this was a little disappointing. 
That said, Chase was very accommodating about check-in and check-out, and the sheets were laundered (and he mentioned that he was doing the same for the person staying after I left). So if you just need a bed to rest your head while you're out and about, this is the cheapest place available, and you're not picky about overall cleanliness, it's totally workable. "
8050232,48207630,2015-09-24,17851350,Dom,This place is perfect for a young person / young couple not looking to spend too much dough. You get what you pay for and there's a reason that this place is priced considerably lower than other properties in the area. It could use a solid cleaning but overall it's a decent space in a great part of town. Chase was very accommodating for me in regards to coordinating the key pick up and drop off (I got into Seattle at 11pm and left a few days later at 5am). I would definitely stay here again but this isn't the kind of place to put your parents if they're coming to visit you for a couple days.
8050232,48753046,2015-09-28,43042450,Nathaniel,Meet up/departure was very smooth and painless. Great location to explore the city. Little market across the street for food and snacks. Lots of places to eat out. 
8050232,49477435,2015-10-04,43026661,Brennan,Chase was friendly and accommodating. The apartment is bare bones and could use a good scrub but it is very centrally located and is priced very affordably for the area. 
8050232,49822317,2015-10-06,6087372,Alex,"The apartment was great, and exactly as advertised. It's a small space but ideally located to get into both downtown & capital hill. I wouldn't say this is the spot for someone looking for the height of luxury, but it was exactly what I needed. There are some great local bars & restaurants, with good hiking spots less than an hours drive away. Check in & out was made very flexible, allowing me to make the most of the time I had. Thanks Chase!"
8050232,50206709,2015-10-10,44483465,Tuuli,"Chase is a very hands off host. I'm not one of those AirBnb-ers that like room service, meals, over hospitable people 'checking in' etc... So in that respect Chase was awesome. He was also very patient with me as I was two or three hours behind my eta. I got lost (first time to Seattle and that airport is really not user friendly). I also fudged my Uber and it took me to a different part of town. I was there doing some apartment hunting and he gave me some good advice regarding where to find cheap rent in the city.

 I disagree with the other reviewers about how dirty the place was. I think a more accurate description would be 'lived in'. Although, that shower rug needs to take a trip to the washing machine (I lay a towel over it). You truly cannot beat the price for the location. Highly recommend walking around the corner to pike grocery and getting a delicious sandwich (the bird and the Cajun were my favorites) Hawaiian BBQ kettle chips, and a beer yuuum. 

Despite being advertised, there was no TV in the apartment. Not a complaint, just an observation. I had my laptop to keep me company. Wifi worked. Stove took really long to heat up. Safe building. Bed was comfortable.  

The only thing that really annoyed me was there was no back stock of toilet tissue or paper towel. All I had was less then half a roll for my stay. Other than that I dug it and will recommend it to friends."
8050232,51637102,2015-10-22,16511629,Florent,"Chase was very accommodating regarding check in/out times. As mentioned in other comments, place could be cleaner. A little street noise at night. "
8050232,52345903,2015-10-28,4930958,Matthew,"Best location and price out there.  Cleanliness of the apartment is not in keeping with airbnb standards. Chase was prompt in meeting me upon arrival and pleasant to deal with, however he did not show up after arranging to meet me for my early departure and key return.  He was not reachable by phone or text that morning.  Parking is possible at this location but it is a little bit of a hassle.  If you plan on walking, using public transport or Uber , I can't stress enough how great a location this is."
5736082,32661647,2015-05-19,20866146,Sharde,"Pretti is great. She is very accommodating.  I just moved to Seattle and needed a place for the weekend before my place was ready, and I didn't want to spend a fortune.  She will give you a cloud-like air mattress and your personal belongings are very safe there.   "
5736082,33288751,2015-05-26,17317748,Rashmi,"Preeti was very helpful in general and helped me settle in quickly. 
However unfortunately there was no furniture in the house (eg. a table and chair to sit on and work). The airbed unfortunately was damaged during the stay and no effort was made to replace it. As a result I had to sleep on the floor during the last few days. 
My stay was not comfortable and this did not feel like home unfortunately!

5736082,42981812,2015-08-16,35766799,Zenan,"Preeti was very nice and helpful. It's the first time I came to Seattle, she recommended me a lot of attractions. The apartment is pretty convenient!"

4009295,19791769,2014-09-18,19625363,Jon,"Miranda and Mike's Very Spacious 1 Bed Cap Hill apartment was exactly as promised, bright, spacious and centrally located in Capitol Hill.  

My flight arrived late from the east coast and I was met  by a warm and welcoming friend that made sure I had everything I needed. 

Miranda was gracious and genuinely concerned that I was comfortable and enjoying my first trip to Seattle.  

"
4009295,19961784,2014-09-21,15962637,Rosa,"As as I got there, Miranda was there to check me in and to orient me to her place.  She also had a bottle of wine for me which was an awesome touch.  She was very personable and accommodating, she honored my request to check in early.  The apartment was centrally located, cute and comfortable to stay at.  I loved it!"

Miranda was incredibly responsive and went out of her way to check in on us and make sure our stay was going well, and to see if we needed anything. She also left a bottle of champagne which was a sweet touch. The location was great and we pretty much walked everywhere. We would definitely stay here on our next Seattle adventure!"
4009295,21851377,2014-10-25,17423692,Ryan,"Miranda was an excellent Airbnb host, We actually arrived early morning and Miranda showed up very promptly and let us into the apartment early even though check in said 5pm. The place worked our perfect for my girlfriend and i, allot of good restaurants around and your about  a 10-15 Uber ride to down down. Miranda also gave us some excellent recommendations on places to go since it was our first time to Seattle. The listing was exactly how described would defiantly stay again."

I really appreciated her checking in with us to ensure that we were comfortable and had all the amenities we needed -- the apartment was the perfect location for my boyfriend and I on my worktrip.  I couldn't be happier with my stay, and with my first-time Airbnb experience!"
4009295,23460057,2014-12-01,21421535,Justan,"Miranda was an amazing host. Professional, prompt to reply and extremely supportive and flexible when I needed to change my plans short notice. If I ever stay in Seattle again I will be sure to use one of Miranda's units just because I know I will be looked after 100%. The apartment itself was well equipped, warm and in an excellent location. I really couldn't ask for a better airbnb experience overall."
4009295,24318426,2014-12-25,2403288,Alok,Great location to explore cap hill. I've booked with the host multiple times. Always a pleasure
4009295,25631943,2015-01-21,7546907,Julie,The apartment was clean and well equipped. Great location on Capitol Hill. We had a problem getting the TV started. Mike responded right away to fix the problem. We   love visiting Seattle and would highly recommend Miranda and Mike as hosts. 
4009295,26268590,2015-02-08,290422,Tawnee,"Super great neighborhood. Miranda, and her college Wally - who helped get us situated, were both super communicative and went out of their way to make sure my partner and I were well taken care of and comfortable. We had a little bit of a mixup with our flat being ready when we arrived, but Miranda and Wally were quick to correct the issue. Miranda has a few different places she rents through AirBNB & we managed to get an upgraded flat, just around the corner from the one we reserved. Capital Hill is vibrant & a great place to have a home-base. We had an excellent time, and would highly recommend any of Miranda's properties. "
4009295,26645455,2015-02-16,5436444,Suzanne,"Great neighborhood -- you're near all the good stuff in Capitol Hill but it's still quiet in the apartment.  The apartment is clean and spacious, and they even bought a brand new HD TV for it while I was there. How's that for service!"
4009295,27006459,2015-02-23,4348115,Vanessa,"Loved staying at this apartment! It's located in a great location in Capitol Hill, a hip area of Seattle and about 20 minutes walking distance from downtown. The apartment itself was spacious, clean, and perfect for a couple. They even left a complimentary bottle of wine for us! I would highly recommended staying here. "
4009295,27343456,2015-03-02,25944554,Elisha,"We felt very welcomed and absolutely loved our stay in Seattle.
Eve & Michael were very accommodating and responded to any request or queries we had almost instantly!
The description of the unit is very accurate (which is not always the case) Clean and plenty of space for a couple.
Great location in Capitol Hill. 
Could not be happier with our stay.
Would highly staying here! "
4009295,28321208,2015-03-22,2105115,Frank,"This location was excellent! Very close to many cool places -- Oddfellows  and Quinn's were great places to go. Eve was very warm, attentive, and willing to go the extra mile to make us comfortable. We had a very enjoyable time. "
4009295,28720349,2015-03-29,2763935,Miriam,The apartment was incredibly nice and clean; there was everything one can possibly need to spend a comfortable week or more in Seattle. Eve is a great host! She was always available and willing to make the experience the best possible.
4009295,28995670,2015-04-02,23264547,Jason,Great space - very large living room. The Keurig and supplies really helped to make morning coffee really easy. This is a great spot in Cap Hill and is easily walkable. 
4009295,29204475,2015-04-05,28509179,Brandi,"LOCATION. LOCATION. LOCATION. This place is close to everything! Easy walk to Pike Place, about a 30 min walk to the Space Needle.  Eve is incredibly communicative, even before we arrived the first day. She left us a lovely bottle of wine and some treats along with a handwritten welcome note. She even took the time to recommend some breweries for us to visit since I had mentioned it in a previous email. She was also very flexible with our arrival and departure times which was appreciated. The place was clean and spacious - pretty much as pictured. And even more important the building was quiet. We had a great stay!"
4009295,29536373,2015-04-08,28194622,Kristen,"Getting in contact with Eve was very easy & she responds within minutes. The apartment was easy to find & in a great location! Overall I have no complaints it was clean & nice, looked like the pictures & eve made sure everything was good for my stay."
4009295,29845277,2015-04-13,5898723,Russell,listing was as described & had a great time
4009295,30309010,2015-04-20,4629995,Kelly,"What a great place! The apartment was exactly as described and was perfect for a long weekend in Seattle. The location was great - well situated, safe, and comfortable. Eve was a spectacular host and greeted us at the apartment. We didn't have any questions during our stay but I know if we did, she would have responded promptly. There aren't enough superlatives to cover this space!! Highly recommend."
4009295,30569827,2015-04-24,647184,Jason,"Eve & Michael's place is spacious and scrupulously maintained! The neighbourhood is great, and they made sure I had everything I needed for my stay. Would AirBnB again, aaa+++!"
4009295,30736222,2015-04-26,4845872,Jaya,Great place in a great location. Eve was very helpful and responsive throughout the trip.
4009295,31909832,2015-05-11,6299047,Alison,"Eve was a very welcoming and responsive host. She made accommodations for us to check in early and check out late, which made the trip go very smoothly for us. The apartment is very comfortable and has everything you need. It is pretty sparse, which is nice because there isn't a lot of clutter, but it isn't super cozy. Not a lot in the kitchen, so don't plan on elaborately. The location is awesome and convenient, it was quiet at night and there are blackout shades in the bedroom which was nice for sleeping in. The balcony is great to sit out on and there is a nice and very large TV for movie watching. Linens are clean and fresh and the bed was comfy! Eve definitely knows how to host!"
4009295,32178665,2015-05-15,3946883,Sean,Excellent stay!
4009295,32515627,2015-05-19,16438548,Kelli,"Eve made us feel very welcome in her apartment. She met us on time, gave us the key, and welcomed us to Seattle. The apartment was perfect for my cousin and me. It was spacious, quiet, and the bed was extremely comfortable (along with blackout shades!). The location could not be beat- there are numerous bars and restaurants nearby. If you are a walker, as we were, the major Seattle attractions were all about 20min walk away (Pike Place Market, ferries, Space Needle). All in all I would highly recommend staying here. No complaints from us!"
4009295,34409872,2015-06-08,29164326,Janiffer,"The neighborhood was young and urban.  We had no safety concerns. On Friday and Saturday nights there was a fair amount of noise in the late evening/early morning hours. The entryway, elevator and halfway on our floor were dated. Again, on Friday and Saturday nights, the neighbors on our floor were quite loud in the early morning hours. The unit was clean and functional. The countertops, faucets and sinks are quite nice. There was a great breeze. There's a nice little balcony with a table and two chairs.  Eve bent over backwards to accommodate our early arrival which was much appreciated."
4009295,35645142,2015-06-21,11264374,Robert,"Great place. Nice and clean. Lots of room. 
You get what you pay for and exactly what you see in the pictures. Real good deal. "

4009295,36672498,2015-06-30,23540389,Daniel,"Everything was as described on the listing. The location is great, really close numerous restaurants and coffee shops. There were a number of bars and nightlife nearby, but it was never loud inside the unit. Definitely recommended! "
4009295,37657329,2015-07-09,33516936,Ingi,"Eve met us and introduced us to the apartment and her welcome bottle of wine was a lovely touch. The apartment was immaculate and well laid out and very spacious for two people. We also thought the amount of storage space, particularly in the hallway, was fantastic. The pictures do the apartment justice. It was a great bonus to have access to a washing machine and dryer (coin operated) in a room next to the apartment, since we had been traveling for a while before Seattle.

The location is in an up and coming part of the city. The street is residential and quite built up but still relatively private and is minutes walk away from cafes, bistros and food markets. Down town is also easily accessible by car (7-10 minutes), by bus (15 minutes) or walking (40 minutes). We mainly used Uber which was far superior to any local taxi we used. Uber were prompt, professional and friendly. For example an Uber from the apartment to the Space Needle was about 8$, in comparison the bus costs 5$ for two people.  "
