4349344,23704198,2014-12-08,725335,Brent,"Just as the pictures show, the Sweat Retreat is a simply cozy and comfortable spot nestled in a quiet neighborhood just up from the heart of Fremont.  My wife and I both enjoyed our stay here and would recommend it to anyone looking to escape the usual hotel ruckus and still be close to all that Fremont and nearby downtown Seattle have to offer.  
Communication prior and during our stay was quick.

Thanks!"
4349344,23914764,2014-12-14,12320518,Deanna,"Hasna was a great host. She provided fresh towels for us and extra blankets if we needed them. The small apartment definitely served its purpose for us, as we just needed a place to sleep and take showers. Oh, and the heater worked great. We really appreciated that since the weather wasn't too warm when we visited. It was a short walk to bars, shopping, and a grocery store which was extremely helpful also. "
4349344,24116152,2014-12-20,555279,Corey,"For a Fremont-based stay in Seattle, this apartment could not be more perfect. We were able to walk everywhere that we wanted to go and we were just as happy to come home at night. I have stayed in multiple Airbnb properties and none have had a bed as cozy as this one! "
4349344,24537364,2014-12-30,12425975,Jill,"Leila was great with communication and made us feel very welcome. She was very fast to respond and when there was someone parked in the designated spot for the unit she took care of it very quickly so we could park and go inside to enjoy the rest of the evening. The unit is very cute and unique. Hasna and Leila have obviously worked hard to make this unit comfortable and welcoming. The location is great and centrally located in the Fremont district. You can walk to coffee, food and nightlife easily. The only thing I'd say is slightly less than perfect is the mattress which was a bit too firm for our taste. Perhaps we are just getting old and need more support. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
4349344,24680158,2015-01-01,16642354,Ross,"This place was great - just what we needed.  We love this area which is underserved by hotels, but this ideal - super cozy and comfy and close to all the restaurants and places we wanted to visit.  Also great access to transit and provisions.  Would definitely stay again.  Hasna and Leila were super helpful and everything was easy and seamless."
4349344,24946760,2015-01-04,2313921,Audra,"Really adorable and cozy spot; made us feel relaxed and right at home. Fabulous decor and clean space.  Excellent location, easy to get to other areas and enjoyed the adorable Fremont neighborhood.  Washer and dryer option a plus."
4349344,25469093,2015-01-17,21698056,Kira,"Sweet Retreat was just that...a very pleasant home away from home. The location is fantastic, you are walking distance to all of Fremont which includes restaurants, bars, coffee shops, cute shops and a grocery store. The apartment was very clean and the host was very easy and pleasant to communicate with. I enjoyed my stay very much!"
4349344,25605360,2015-01-20,23231026,Jennifer,"Hasna and Leila were fabulous hosts! The place was lovely, clean, and very welcoming. The location was absolutely perfect, and had many shops, restaurants, and bars within walking distance. My husband and I would definitely stay again at the Sweet Retreat!"
4349344,27606260,2015-03-08,13153964,Annie,"This place was great! Just as advertised, great location, Fremont restaurants and shops are literally 1 min away from your door. House was clean with relaxing decor and plenty of plants and good wifi. Would definitely recommend!"
4349344,27722693,2015-03-10,16240938,Caitlin,"We had a lovely and peaceful stay at sweet retreat during an otherwise stressful period. The location was perfect, secluded yet still close to the action. The unit was a good size for a couple and felt very safe. Check-in and check-out were also hassle-free. I would highly recommend staying here!"
4349344,28011529,2015-03-16,25205221,Randy,Just as described! Great location within walking distance to downtown Freemont. Place was perfect size for two and had all the amenities we needed. Highly Recommended!
4349344,28238008,2015-03-20,15121499,Kathryn,"The Sweet Retreat is absolutely lovely. The location is fantastic and it's just so private, peaceful and tranquil. Retreat really is the right work to describe this spot. It was a perfect place to relax after a long day of work and the bed is the most comfortable EVER!"
4349344,28471811,2015-03-24,12867508,Megan,The place was simply gorgeous. The location was perfect! The ambiance was definitely very inviting and relaxing. The host did an amazing job in allowing us feel like we 'own' the place for few days by giving us privacy and responding quickly to questions we had for them. I definitely will recommend this place to my family and friends if/when they visit Seattle. 
4349344,28587231,2015-03-26,29713226,Lawrence,"While we did not get a chance to see the host, her sister communicated with us via SMS and was very prompt with any questions/concerns we had. We were a little worried about the hallway outside of our unit that connected to the neighbor upstairs. Thankfully, he entered from a different entrance and only we used the other entry so we felt pretty secure.

The unit itself is clean, for the most part. It had everything we needed for a good two nights. The lights above and behind the bed were a nice touch."
4349344,28647105,2015-03-28,3219157,Travis,"A fun little hideaway within walking distance of shops, restaurants, and lounges. A nice alternative to staying in the city."
4349344,29109918,2015-04-04,4328269,Patrick,"We had such an incredible stay at Sweet Retreat! The apartment is cute, cozy, and clean. I always love staying in an airbnb that has character and Sweet Retreat definitely does. The apartment is less than a block from the heart of the Fremont neighborhood, which is such a cool Seattle spot. We easily walked to coffee shops, restaurants, and bars - we really enjoyed exploring this part of Seattle!

In addition to the apartment, Leila was so amazing too coordinate with! She was so friendly and responsive - always getting back to me immediately and making sure I had everything I needed. 

I think this was my best airbnb experience yet!"
4349344,29279174,2015-04-06,21923726,Jessie,This place truly is a sweet retreat. We had a great weekend stay. Leila was incredibly flexible with us as we were arriving far later then we thought. The location in Fremont is absolutely perfect and getting there from the ferry docks only took 30 mins in total of walking and a 15 minute bus ride. Will definitely stay here again when in Seattle. Thanks Leila!
4349344,29847354,2015-04-13,29187454,Cory,"Super Seattle experience! Amazing apartment, amazing hostess, amazing experience. At one point I managed to lock my key inside the apartment, whoops.. One text to the hostess and she gracefully took care of everything. The apartment feels like a beautiful reflection of the City of Seattle itself. Walking distance to the Fremont Troll and in the heart of the Fremont district.

 5 stars from me :)"
4349344,30028153,2015-04-16,29051188,Shane,"What a great spot!  Tucked a mere stone's throw from the center of Fremont, this small studio was both convenient and quiet. Neat personal touches (see if you can find all the tiny terrariums!) along with all the usual amenities made a great trip. "
4349344,30173369,2015-04-18,29589256,Justin,"The Sweet Retreat is exactly how it sounds, it's a wonderful lil get away in the Fremont Neighbor close to funky lil shop and amazing places to eat! It was exactly as pictured and better then the pictures to be honest. If you are looking for a stress reducing place with an awesome location, this would be the place for you. "
4349344,30292872,2015-04-20,8960936,Tara,We had a lovely time at this stylish studio in the heart of Fremont. Easy walking distance to so many places yet a very quiet place for respite. We would stay there again in a heartbeat. 
4349344,31237692,2015-05-03,2917058,Maxwell,"We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay while we visited/got to know Seattle.  Located right in the heart of Fremont, there was so much to do out of our front door! And to come back to a nice, quiet retreat after a long day of walking around made it even better.  There are so many great shops, restaurants, bars, and cafes within a few blocks that it was hard to decide where to go sometimes.  Though we didn't meet Hasna or her sister Leila, it was very easy to find the place via their directions and the key was waiting for us.  

All in all we couldn't have picked a better place for our visit!"
4349344,31658404,2015-05-08,12616771,Kari,"Leila was fantastic with her communication about the place, down to every detail. The space had so much charm, with cute terrariums and abundant greenery. Location was fantastic; right near the heart of Fremont. Never heard a peep, nor saw the upstairs neighbor...Entries were 100% separate and we had total privacy. Bed was a little firm, but we slept well every night. I'll stay here again next time I'm in Seattle!"
4349344,43702951,2015-08-21,41305993,Valerie,"Great place!  Great location, great view, comfy and cozy.  My daughter and I had a great time.  "
4349344,46178125,2015-09-08,15339679,Kiri & Peter,"Great location  in Fremont and a short distance down to the waterfront trail to go for a nice walk.  The description of the place is accurate.  It's not a large place by any means, but she states this up front, and it is more spacious than a hotel room. The place was clean and easy to access.  Communication with host was good.  We were in town for a long weekend for our friends wedding.  The reception was at the rowing club nearby and this proved a great place for our stay in Seattle.  Thanks!"
4349344,47993472,2015-09-22,2398821,Laura,We loved the sweet retreat. It was in a great location for the bars and restaurants of Fremont and easy access to the city. The flat was very relaxing and really well designed. The location was lovely and quiet and a  perfect escape from the city. We would love to have stayed longer. 
4349344,50020720,2015-10-08,44887375,Greg,"Great host- made us feel very comfortable, even had chocolate waiting for us to welcome us to Seattle. 

Great place - very homey, clean, and exactly what we had hoped for in a place to stay. Especially loved the decor and bed.

Great location - steps from the heart of Fremont.

I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
4349344,50407687,2015-10-11,537016,Katie,Hasna's house was a delight to stay in.  She keeps it extremely clean and very comfy.  It's also a great location close to many restaurants and shops.  I would strongly recommend a relaxing stay at this location!
4349344,52184769,2015-10-26,24862026,Roland,"Thank you for a wonderful experience, the house was very clean. We enjoyed our walk to and from Seattle space needle! Do not take the google map direction, thru Queen Ann, great looking house and high hills. Take the Westlake route it. Our suggestion is to have another chair to use to eat at the table with. Also a coffee pot. The neighbor hood had a very 60's culture setting in the Fremont neighbor hood. Deadbolt may need a little WD 40. Overall very nice and clean. Did not get to meet the host or sister who was assisting with the house.  Thank you for working with us.."
4349344,54254411,2015-11-17,11379661,Cameron,"Great place to stay right in the heart of Fremont. The location really can't be beat, tons of things to do and see nearby, very walkable! The place itself is very cozy, clean, and well decorated. Hasna was a great host, easy to get a hold of and very thorough in her communications."
4349344,55214069,2015-11-29,46334286,Janice,We felt very welcome and had sweet email exchanges before hand!
4349344,55689317,2015-12-04,12428871,Joseph,I stayed for two nights at Hasna's place in Seattle while in town on business - would definitely recommend to any business travelers or couples who don't need a lot of space. The studio has everything you need and is very comfortable with a lot of plants and quirky features. Very well located for access to Fremont and host was very communicative and helpful - check-in and out were very straightforward and flexible.
4349344,56689858,2015-12-16,16211617,Natalie,"We loved this little apartment! It was just as described, well taken care of and super walkable to bars, restaurants and little shops. Everything was very clean, which I very much appreciated. The host gave excellent directions for parking and made it easy to get the key as soon as we arrived. I never actually met her, but she was prompt with her responses and I had the sense she would have quickly helped us out if we had needed it. Thank you for a beautiful stay."
7971395,46840921,2015-09-13,43804516,Emily,Just as described. Everything was very clean and new. The host was very responsive and easy to get in contact with. The room had everything we could need and has a private entrance through the backyard which we were given keys for.  Lovely.
7971395,47913714,2015-09-21,15610289,Whit,This listing was accurate in it's description and was a lovely place to stay while in Seattle.  The host was more than gracious and accommodating. They went above and beyond to make my stay extra special. I would definitely stay here again.
7971395,48130836,2015-09-23,5338700,Melissa,Cindy and her daughter Francine made my two day visit for business very relaxing!  The room is perfect...bed is more of a full size!  The place is ultra clean and conveniently has a separate entrance!  As soon as I arrived they served me water and snacks and made sure I didn't need anything else.  The area felt very safe to leave my car.  I would definitely stay with them again when in Seattle.  
7971395,48469190,2015-09-26,6942699,Jacky,"I decided to go on vacation on the last minute. After I booked my flight, I discovered that the Chinese president was visiting Seattle and most of the hotels were unavailable in downtown. I found Cindy's place. She was very responsive and helpful to host her place. The room had individual entrance and a electronic lock, which she will setup for you upon your arrival. The room is absolutely very clean. You will get a large closet and dress mirror. The bathroom was stylishly decorated and not a stain was observed. I thought I was in a 5 star hotel room on a mini-scale. In fact, the bed was more comfortable than many of the hotel beds I have visited. Cindy and her daughter Francene were very welcoming and even offered tips for lunch and local shops. Not to mention, this place is close to Capital Hill and University District. If you are tired of the downtown scene and want to explored other places in Seattle, I think Cindy's place can give you a fresh experience. "
7971395,48789427,2015-09-28,9437543,Sheryl,"Loved the private entrance as well as how beautifully done up the room was! It was a pity we only stayed a night here. The room was a little cold in the morning, but perhaps because we couldn't figure how to work the heating. Otherwise, it was a perfect stay and the hosts were excellent. "
7971395,49855070,2015-10-06,33571357,Jack,"Cindy was incredibly sweet with the whole move in process! She was kind, and helpful with whatever we needed and was always there if we had any questions or anything like that. The space was very cute and comfortable and I would definitely recommend it to a friend! "
7971395,50729142,2015-10-13,20359749,Deiane,"My first experience using airbnb. Amazing family, really sweet and the room and bathroom are simply great! Clean, warm, comfortable, quiet. 
Quite a bit of a long walk downtown if you decide to go walking (as I did) but there's a bus stop just two block down that take you downtown. Cindy and her daughter Francene were really lovely, they would bring me every night some dinner tk my room. Simply adorable. I would definitely recommend this place."
7971395,51596433,2015-10-21,912564,Steve And Michael,"First the positives: the bedroom and attached bath are attractive and easily accessed through a private door off the back yard. There is an adequate sized closet. However we were unhappy with a number of things.

The sheets and pillow cases appeared to have not been changed since a previous person slept in the bed. There was no top sheet, just a single comforter. Fortunately, we brought our own pillows.

The way the double bed is situated is awkward. One side is against a large headboard, forcing the inside person to clamber over the outside person should he/she need to get out of bed in the middle of the night. Because of this, the room is best suited for a single person.

Finally, we felt the bath room had not been cleaned, and the liquid soap was extremely watery."
7971395,53847680,2015-11-13,47933038,Ding,"Cindy and her daughter are so kind, made my stay a fabulous experience. As host, they even invited me to their homemade dumpling dinner, and i was feeling so at home. 

The place is located conveniently to the cities' attractions, while sitting in a quiet neighborhood. Plus, the house is very new and clean. 

After all, I would highly recommend!"
7971395,57274468,2015-12-23,51833984,Zhaohui,"Although it was a very short stay, I loved my experience in this clean, comfortable and lovely private room with everything I needed neatly organized. Cindy and her daughter are so kind and helpful, everything just made me feel like home. The house is located in a quiet and safe neighborhood. Really short distance and easy access to great eats, shopping and downtown Seattle. It was so much fun being so close to everything! A perfect home, would love to come back here again, highly recommended!! "
8904766,56286048,2015-12-11,40421770,Xueer,"Dane's house is clean and well decorated. I could enjoy the living room and big kitchen space, that was really convenient for my stay."
8934054,53012943,2015-11-03,45960646,Katie,"This accommodation is great for privacy and for having the space to relax. The hosts were welcoming and very friendly, allowing us to make ourselves at home. The hosts were not there for our two day stay even though it is advertised as a private room. "

7514366,48961768,2015-09-29,41158892,Paige,"I had a wonderful time staying at Abigail's place. It was quiet and cozy, and I even got to do a little cooking! Gold star!"
7514366,50218338,2015-10-10,2324828,Will,"Abbey was a terrific host! She made sure to welcome us, show us around her place, and ensure our comfort. We had a great time checking out West Seattle and her recommendations were of great help to us. Thanks Abbey!"
7514366,50954049,2015-10-16,44779254,Denis,"Abigail was the perfect host, the house is cosy and the neighbourhood quiet. A perfect place for visiting Seattle!"
7514366,52724032,2015-11-01,12908307,Michael & Fatima,"Abbey's place is exactly what we needed. It is close to the bus stop, has all the amenities, and it looks exactly as described. Abbey is very helpful and ready to answer any questions. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle! :)"
7514366,56233931,2015-12-10,47601777,Ahlim,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
14386,76517,2010-08-09,158878,Nancy,"Bob was very nice and accommodating to our needs, even to my daughter who can be a challenge at times.  He was helpful with assisting us as we attempted to navigate around the Seattle area.  His pets were friendly and well-behaved and very well socialized.  Bob even made a point of calling and emailing to make sure things were going well prior to our visit.  He was a super host and I enjoyed listening to him sing and practice on the piano.

Personally I would have preferred to have a private bath/shower, etc. and the bathroom and bedroom were not as clean as I would have liked.  If you're over 5'8"" this may be an uncomfortable place for you to stay with the dormers sloping ito the ceiling."
14386,90173,2010-09-04,206772,Susan,"Bob's house was a great place to stay in the Green Lake area.  It was close to the bus, the Lake.
His dog and cats added to the home feel.
Susan"
14386,91456,2010-09-06,211913,Alana,"Bob was really easy-going, flexible and approachable.  He was particularly nice about allowing check-in and check-out times that would suit our schedule.  We felt totally comfortable staying there.    

We also really appreciated the opportunity to see a  part of Seattle we never would have visited otherwise.  Green Lake is huge and so idyllic.  As we biked back downtown along the water, we saw people stretching and doing yoga in the park at 6 am!  Yet, you can easily see the sanity in it!

Regarding the place, Bob's animals are beautiful--they completely enhance the experience as long as you have no allergies.  The rooms and bathroom are very clean and the entire home is really stylishly decorated.  Comfy bed, soft duvet.  The adjacent upstairs room make a great set-up for friends travelling together.  Factual note: the ceilings are pretty low and the bathroom is downstairs.  

Great experience overall!     "
14386,101652,2010-09-20,237992,Rochelle,"Bob has a quaint house in a great neighborhood in Seattle.  Walking distance to Green Lake, that has a perfect path for walking/jogging as well as some fun restaurants and bars.  We went for a nice walk to a coffee shop only a few blocks away and then hit the lake for a rainy day stroll.  Our bed was comfortable and since it was upstairs we enjoyed listening to the rain as we fell asleep, relaxing!  It was difficult to motivate myself to go down stairs in the middle of the night for the restroom, but not a big deal.  Bob was so flexible about our arrival time and departure it took all the pressure off us and his pets were so sweet. "
14386,452199,2011-08-16,940406,Jamie,"Bob is a fun, outgoing and easy guy to level with.  The accommodation was great and it was quite spaceious. The back yard was nice and relaxing with next to no noise. His pets were very friendly and were not afraid accompanying you. The location of the house was great as the bus stop was one block away and with the lake just south, shops and restaurants nearby too."
14386,736418,2011-11-21,1411663,Lisa,"My stay at Bob's was very pleasant. The room I stayed in is on the top floor and overlooked the back yard and the changing Fall color leaves. Bob was busy at work while I was in town, and when he was there, was a gracious host and a good communicator. I loved having the pets around, too. The pets very friendly, easy going and gregarious. 

The futon was already made into a bed. The bathroom is downstairs near the large kitchen. It was great to be able to make my own breakfast and dinner, instead of going out. 

The lake is within walking distance as are a few cafes. Great location. Easy access to I-5. "
14386,807949,2011-12-27,679284,Clarissa,Bob is very friendly and easy to get along with. He really makes you feel welcomed. The pets are very sweet too. This was a perfect stay for us.
14386,1333783,2012-05-23,1744620,Frederik,"I enjoyed living in Bob's house for almost a month. There's a friendly and laid-back atmosphere around the house and Bob is also a very friendly and helpful host. 
"
14386,1529029,2012-06-21,1111440,Nathanial,"Clean and comfortable, great area, conveniently located. A great option for your stay in leafy Seattle. "
14386,1870738,2012-08-02,2629579,Emilia,"Very nice, safe house with a comfortable bed, great pets, and a welcoming host. Thanks, Bob!"
14386,2158757,2012-09-01,2727594,Rachel,"Bob was a wonderful host.  He is very laid-back and relaxed, but also very friendly and easy to talk to.  The house is lovely, and a short walk from Green Lake.  The bedroom is nice and airy with a lovely skylight.  He has a beautiful backyard that a person can relax and enjoy a quiet afternoon in.  The dog and cats are all very friendly.  I stayed there for a month, and was very sad to have to leave.  The house is conveniently located near shops and a grocery store plus the bus to downtown has a stop very close by.  I would recommend Bob to anyone looking for a quiet place to stay while visiting Seattle.   "
14386,2340172,2012-09-18,1272665,Oliver,"Bob is a very nice guy, his place is very convenient and also his pets are very friendly and Bob was always there if I needed help with directions and guidance, Thank You Bob! :=)"
14386,2893678,2012-11-15,3943011,Sonia,It was a very comfortable and convenient stay at Bob's! He was friendly and his place is in a superb location. Thank you!
14386,3050187,2012-12-09,325837,John,It was a distinct pleasure to stay at Bob's house.  Bob offers a multitude of kitchen utensils and storage.  He likewise displays a quintessential Italian spirit for socializing and promoting his manifold talents. I frequently enjoyed the company of his pets and occasional other guests as well.  He is a very valuable Airbnb host for any guest lucky enough to spend time at his abode.
14386,3108181,2012-12-17,4365290,David,"Bob was an excellent, attentive host. Even though I could not meet him personally beforehand he provided excellent directions and the room was exactly as posted. "
14386,3209083,2013-01-01,3916427,Peter,"Bob' place was fine and in a good location. Bob was performing all week and so I didn't get to interact much. He seemed a friendly nice person, though. No complaints."
14386,3313675,2013-01-08,998361,Molly,"I felt so grateful to have stayed at Bob's bnb!
Bob's house is beautiful and is located in a lovely serene neighbourhood.  I stayed in his sweet upstairs bedroom which has a skylight and windows looking out onto his mossy and tree filled backyard... and I loved that when it rained, I could hear the raindrops on the skylight and see the sky when I was laying in bed.   
I had a very peaceful experience at Bob's house all in all.  

I did not get to see Bob much, but really enjoyed speaking to him briefly and felt extremely honoured that he performed an original song for me on the piano while I was there.  
I could tell he had a really kind spirit.   Thank you Bob for a pleasant experience!"
14386,21134373,2014-10-12,209888,Melanie,"I have had a great experience staying at Bob's upstairs room. The room is quiet and there is full kitchen access.  Bob is very welcoming and easygoing, and always helpful. The house is located in a great part of Seattle that is convenient to the city, but away just enough to get away from the hustle and bustle. That cats are super fun. The room itself is small but definitely cozy. Bus stops are a block away and parking is easy too. Overall I have had a great stay."
14386,21663692,2014-10-21,21183084,Joseph,Bob was a gracious host. I hope to stay at his place again when I come back in January.
14386,36771056,2015-07-01,24333475,Rinita,"Best part for me is that the house is at a really good location, half a block away from the bus stop that has 16, 316 and 48 which is super convenient while traveling to downtown or university district. Green lake is another block away from here, which is perfect for walks and such. Bob is very friendly and easy to get along with. As the description suggests, probably not the right place for someone who isn't a cat-person but I'm quite fond of Pollux :) I should probably warn that the upstairs room gets really stuffy and hot during the summer, I don't know if that's usual Seattle summer or just global warming acting up this time.
I'd like to add that the futon has been replaced by a bed which is great. The house is really nice with the hammocks and a hot tub in the backyard. (Sadly, I haven't been able to use them as much as I'd like to.)
I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to live away from the downtown rush and yet have easy access to commute to downtown."
14386,41233009,2015-08-05,20613361,Ben,"I very much enjoyed my stay with Bob and am looking forward to returning on my next overnight stay in his part of Seattle. The upstairs room was quiet and cozy, comfortable for me. Bob is a gracious host. His home is only a few blocks from the beautiful Green Lake trails, another plus. Highly recommended."
14386,42273101,2015-08-12,10601127,Joseph,"Echoing so many of the reviews here  --  Bob is a gracious host.  He could not be more likable and helpful but he's not at all intrusive. 
   The house has a vibrant lived-in feel.  It's casual, quirky in a good way, well organized and reasonably clean especially where it counts (the bathroom, the sheets, etc). The bed is comfortable.  The room is very small but perfectly adequate and priced appropriately. It's quiet.          There are two other airbnb rooms, both occupied while I was there. You might think that could feel crowded and chaotic but it didn't.  The location and the neighborhood are both very good. 
"
14386,42422732,2015-08-13,17020227,Eugenia,"Our only regret about our stay is that it wasn't long enough. Bob was an exceptionally kind and generous host. We greatly enjoyed chatting with him and sharing travel stories. Bob's home is comfortable, with everything labeled for guests, and comes equipped with an amazing backyard with hammocks and a hot tub. The room we stayed in was quiet and comfortable. The place is 2 blocks from the beautiful lake, running trail, and lots of food. We would definitely stay with Bob again!"
14386,45254384,2015-09-01,28806683,Emily,"Bob is great! He was so welcoming and friendly. His notes all around the house made it easy to ""make yourself at home"" and he was always ready to offer help in any way. Full access to the kitchen, washer/dryer, and backyard (with hot tub!) made it a great place for a longer term stay. There were usually other people staying in other rooms of the house as well, which gave it a nice communal feel. Also - so close to Greenlake Park, which is absolutely beautiful and great for swimming, biking, and running. "
14386,45420485,2015-09-02,295772,Scott,"I only regret I didn't really get to chat with Bob much.  Judging from the few minutes we met (I arrived shortly before he had to bolt.) and judging from his wonderfully eclectic house, he's a very interesting guy.  The bedroom was comfortable, Bob made everything pretty idiot proof with instructions and all sorts of things labeled.  The neighborhood and location were perfect, and I hope Bob will have me back again.  "
14386,46133279,2015-09-08,7005260,Amy,"Bob was a fantastic host! We didn't see him too often as we were out all day, but he was so friendly and welcoming. Would definitely recommend!"
14386,47855696,2015-09-21,12424016,Angeline,"Staying in Bob's cozy upstairs room was lovely! Great location, beautiful garden view and wonderful conversation.  Bob is  very accommodating and helpful - he recommended fantastic places to visit and dine during our stay.  I would highly recommend a visit here.  Thank you Bob!"
14386,49175161,2015-10-01,32851261,Hannah,Bob was a really great host and I found this the perfect place to stay. Within easy walking distance of the lovely green park. Close by to buses - i would recommend walking to the rapid line on aurora as its much quicker. Room was all I needed and bed was comfy. Bathroom clean and good shower. I was included in Bob and his friends games night which was great fun!!! This is very much a home stay. The house is well lived in and you feel like part of it when you stay. I loved it!!!!
14386,49299172,2015-10-02,20941654,Michael,"Bob's place has a great location, and he is great host.   "
14386,54843199,2015-11-25,14762805,Heather,"Bob was a wonderful host. He was very warm, inviting, and accommodating. I felt completely at ease in his home. The room was nice and the bed was comfy. The room is a little small (as the listing states), but Bob was more than gracious about allowing us to store things in the various closets and spaces of the house. We checked out early, because we found a place to move into, and Bob went the extra mile to invite us to game nights at his house, even after we had left. Bob is a fan of music and art, so talking to him is always fun. The house is in a really nice neighborhood, with plenty of parking. I recommend staying here!"
4565370,23412849,2014-11-30,2270720,Sam,"Rachel and Jon were extremely friendly and welcomed us into their home when we arrived. They also invited us to take part in their Thanksgiving dinner! Their home is beautiful and the room I stayed in was very comfortable. Brigitte, their cat, made sure we felt at home during our stay. Their place is in a quiet neighbourhood and convenient for accessing other parts of Seattle."
4565370,23611581,2014-12-06,24197342,Kevin,Jon and Rachel are very outgoing and friendly; they put me at ease and I felt at home immediately.  The bed was exceptionally comfortable with a warm comforter that kept me cozy during a couple of cold winter nights.  It is a unique house just as they described it with interesting interior touches.  You will feel right at home here.
4565370,23927928,2014-12-14,18821513,Jon,"Excellent stay with Rachel and Jon. Their home is great, wonderfully located, and very comfortable and tastefully decorated. They even offered to share dinner with us! Our only regret was having to leave on an early flight the next morning!"
4565370,25275217,2015-01-11,2394361,Nicole,"We felt super comfortable at Rachel and Jon's place. Rachel was very welcoming and flexible with our schedule - she let us check in early and check out later. Their home is lovely and in a decent location near Capitol Hill, but a bit of a walk to downtown. They are superb hosts and did a great job of making sure we felt welcome. "
4565370,25488345,2015-01-17,26107514,Stephanie,Jon and Rachel have a lovely home. The stay was perfect - comfortable and convenient. And they were very flexible hosts. 
4565370,26276679,2015-02-08,16752374,Christine,Rachel and Jon were very kind and accommodating. It was easy setting up an arrival and they even wrote us a great selection of breakfast spots for the morning of our departure. The house and our room are BEAUTIFUL! Love all the decor in this character home. Our bed was super comfortable and their cat was a gem. The neighbourhood was central to everywhere we needed to go. Highly recommended and we will definitely look to stay here again! 
4565370,26380201,2015-02-10,15914073,Kazuhiro,"I could have great time at this place. The whole house (room, washroom, kitchen etc) is so clean. And it's nice location. Also the hosts (Rachel and Jon) are so friendly."
4565370,26715184,2015-02-17,14370445,Fanie,Rachel and John were very nice and welcoming hosts. The house is charming and in a quiet neighborhood not too far from downtown. I would definitely stay again with them.
4565370,27109734,2015-02-25,8945188,Michelle,"We had a fantastic stay at Rachel & Jon's lovely home. We had a warm welcome from Rachel & their beautiful cat Briggie, which was a nice surprise. Our room was great, comfy bed, lots of space, liked the decor. Everything about our stay was perfect, felt at home there. Was easy getting the bus into town, also found a great local cafe, Cheeky cafe for the best breakfast & you are very close to some nice Chinese & Vietnamese food! We enjoyed our chats with Rachel too. Thank you for making our last stay in an AirBnB for a while so wonderful! We will miss all the lovely people we have met in our last year of traveling."
4565370,28085350,2015-03-17,17942836,Kelsey,"Better than photos. Rachel and John's home has a lovely aesthetic with sleek, wordly and vintage appeal. Tidy and uncluttered. This place could be in a magazine. Bedroom has high ceilings and an incredibly comfortable bed and blankets. Beautiful kitchen. Bathroom is lovely, too. Hosts were highly flexible. Brigitte (cat) likes to snuggle. Neighborhood is an Uber or bus ride from downtown and lively spots like Capitol Hill. We used the bus routes heavily and walked only a few blocks to a well-connected bus. Highly recommended. "
4565370,28797931,2015-03-30,6948129,Joseph,"Had a fantastic time in The Reading Room.  We were in town for a conference, and as such were quite busy, but have nothing but good things to say about our hosts and their lovely home.  They were very welcoming, gave great advice, and welcomed us above and beyond.  And they have excellent taste in furniture, and an even more wonderful cat.  Highly recommended."
4565370,29945910,2015-04-14,30410457,Jonathan,"These guys are just amazing. They are both so chilled out and happy to help with anything possible. Location is superb. A 2 min walk will have you on a bus heading into downtown Seattle. Or if you fancy walking it, which will take you 30 mins or so. I'd recommend these guys to everyone. "
4565370,30827908,2015-04-27,31247533,Tina,"Rachel and Jon are just the sweetest! Thank you both for the lovely room, and your generosity. Your home is very close to everything ""Seattle;"" I definitely recommend! I felt comfortable and safe, and will absolutely check for an available room with you next time I come that way!"
4565370,30905041,2015-04-28,31306689,Charlotte,It was a very short but sweet stay in this beautiful house. Rachel was very friendly and accommodating (we never met Jon). Lovely bedrooms and an excellent location; we had no problems finding parking near the house. The cat was also very friendly too!
4565370,31332962,2015-05-04,30195909,Jeremy,Tout simplement simple et tres genereux! Merci Rachel et Jon
4565370,32488777,2015-05-19,33317339,Parth,The host canceled this reservation 66 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4565370,33580096,2015-05-30,4874068,Shasha,"Both Rachel and Jon are very welcoming and accommodating throughout my stay. The house is bright and airy, and is a wonderful place to stay. It's a short bus/taxi ride into the main Seattle city center, and is within walking distance to cafes and grocers. It is a fantastic place for your Seattle visit, to get away from the noise of the city and experience the neighbourhoods. I highly recommend staying here!"
4565370,34459782,2015-06-08,5925127,Craig,"Rachel & Jon were very warm and welcoming, as was their home --  an older frame structure, decorated with an austere elegance: Uncluttered, very clean, but cozy and woody and organic. The Reading Room has a bed, night stand and a chair, as well as a few shelves of books, ranging from French texts to Thomas Pynchon novels. The bed was quite comfortable, though I had to tread carefully down the wooden steps when I had to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. 
The neighborhood is centrally located in Seattle, fifteen minutes' drive from most key places in town. There's a very nice coffee shop a block and a half away.  "
4565370,35085497,2015-06-15,10799142,Sophia,"Rachel and John are generous and friendly hosts eager to share their home (and a variety of delicious snacks). If you want great company and host interaction, their place is the place for you. They keep their home tidy and have great suggestions for area activities and locations.  Brigitte the cat has tons of charisma and really, really wants your attention. A cool spot!"
4565370,36665542,2015-06-30,30638900,Phillip & Paulie,"Jon and Rachel have a lovely home in a neighbourhood that is in close proximity to downtown Seattle. Although we had a rental car we chose to walk to the downtown area on our first full day. The walk was pleasant and took about 25 minutes. The house has high ceilings and large windows and is very tastefully decorated in a minimalist style that allows one to enjoy the space. Jon and Rachel were very friendly and welcoming. They graciously provided complementary tea bags, coffee, fruit and a few other treats. We enjoyed chatting with them at the breakfast table and felt welcome to share their kitchen and dining area with them. Everything was as described. The weekend of our stay Seattle was experiencing a heat wave. The room was warm for sleeping but Jon and Rachel did their best to provide ventilation by setting up fans, etc. A great place to stay when visiting Seattle!"
4565370,41200942,2015-08-05,32676248,Christian,It was a perfect stay in Seattle. Our hosts helped us a lot to find restaurants and shops. Without  Rachel and John it wouldn't have been that amazing
4565370,41330503,2015-08-07,5007424,Julia,"We loved our time at Rachel and Jons house! It was a lovely space, the room was great and a good size. The rest of the house was beautiful and relaxing. The bathroom was clean. All together a great place to stay!!"
4565370,43032403,2015-08-17,20337121,Angela,"Rachel and Jon were very welcoming during my long stay. The house was clean, and occasional fresh fruits (sometimes from their garden) were provided! The neighborhood is very safe and it only takes about 15-20 minute walk to get to the lively Capitol Hill. The only minor problem about the house was that there is only 1 bathroom, so sometimes it can be a little bit inconvenient...Overall, I think I fell in love with Seattle partly because of this nice airbnb experience! It made me feel right at home! "
4565370,46135290,2015-09-08,8069245,Sarah,"We had a delightful overnight stay in this lovely home. We felt very welcome, not just in our room but throughout the house. Rachel provided great and interesting company that kept us up chatting later than we intended! We would highly recommend this home to anyone. "
4565370,46495997,2015-09-11,19923524,Lauren,"We enjoyed staying with Rachel and John during our time in Seattle. The house was lovely, decorated with beautiful art throughout and the room was very comfortable. We were out and about during the majority of our time there however they answered any questions and provided everything we needed to make our stay comfortable. Their cat Brigitte is the sweetest! She welcomed us at the door when we arrived. The location was a great! Just under 10 minutes and about 6 bucks for an Uber to Pike Place Market and many attractions downtown. We would definitely stay there again if in Seattle!"
4565370,46882869,2015-09-14,14491949,Itay,"We had an amazing time at John and Rachel's place! Rachel did everything she could in order for us to enjoy our stay and make the most of the short time we spent in Seattle. The room was very comfy and was basically exactly what we've been looking for. We left with a very posotive impression of the city and the neighborhood and we will definitely come stay here again when in Seattle.
"
4565370,48111514,2015-09-23,41624164,Serge,"B&B agréable et bien placé, rapidement au centre en bus, et calme la nuit. Rachel possède de bonnes adresses, et parle le français. En fonction de la saison, quelques fruits et légumes offerts, ainsi que boissons chaudes. Salle de bain commune au rez de style années 60, une maison pleine d'authenticité.
"
4565370,48698424,2015-09-28,15998893,Britt,"Staying with Rachel and Jon was great! The house is beautiful, clean and in true Seattle style. There were plenty of clean towels, and they provided an easy way to get in and out. They even let us check-in early so that we could store our bags and get headed out on the town! (They also have an adorable cat!)

It’s in a great part of town, too! Walking distance to the University, and all of the bars/restaurants in Capitol Hill. Not too far from other tourist attractions like the Space Needle, EMP Museum, etc. either. Though, a nice quiet place to rest at night. All in all: Great trip!

Our only bummer was not having more time in Seattle so that we could hangout with Rachel & Jon a bit. 

We would definitely suggest staying at the Farmhouse to anyone looking to be in the city — no better location or room!"
4565370,52134859,2015-10-26,10547401,Andryce & Tyler,"Staying with Rachel and Jon was phenomenal. The location was great for where we needed to be in Seattle. They have a very clean, open and inviting space, and the room we stayed in worked out great. They were very hospitable and made our stay special. I would highly recommend their space to others!"
4565370,52837254,2015-11-02,43289205,Alisha Lucia,"Rachel and Jon were the perfect hosts during our short stay in Seattle!  
All the welcoming hand-written notes, plus the gorgeous plants in every room and the added bonus that they are both such lovely people really sealed the deal; we will definitely look to stay with Rachel and Jon again on our next visit to Seattle! A++!"
4565370,54414251,2015-11-19,4316081,Jo & Mike,We loved staying with Rachel and Jon. Their home is beautiful and they were really good hosts and good people to chat too. We'd love to stay with them again if we get back to Seattle v
4565370,54801050,2015-11-23,1422930,Jessie,"Had a fantastic stay with Rachel and Jon. They are both lovely people and I really enjoyed meeting them. Their cat, Brigitte, was super sweet - definitely a special kitty. I loved my accommodations - the house was super cool and I had everything I needed. Will definitely stay here again next time I'm in Seattle!"
4565370,55966290,2015-12-07,5589650,Lauren,"Had a fabulous stay with Rachel and Jon. Though visiting just for one night, we felt instantly welcomed in their space- an absolutely stunning home with so many thoughtful details. We had the pleasure of enjoying coffee and breakfast with Rachel and Jon on the morning of our departure and just couldn't have asked for a better experience.  Lovely home and even lovelier hosts! "
5969872,38595126,2015-07-17,32294212,Jared,"I stayed here for two months and can say that Joachim was a very friendly, laid-back host. He was also very helpful: anything that needed to be fixed in the house was done in a day or two. Overall, I had a great experience staying here!"
5969872,39835820,2015-07-26,38268319,Sophie,"Joachim was extremely welcoming and helpful throughout my stay, always making sure I had everything I needed, and even inviting me along to social events. I was free to come and go as I pleased, and felt very much at home for my week's stay. 

The room was as listed, and although there was not much room to manoeuvre, the bed was very comfortable. The kitchen was well-equipped and I could use it as I wished, which was really nice. The location of the house is ideal, with a short walk to both the university district and Green Lake, and easy bus access downtown. Thank you Joachim - I would be back without hesitation!"

5969872,41808025,2015-08-09,38005299,Tim,"
Everyone in the unit was very friendly. The room itself is small, with 95% of the space taken up by the humongous airbed. Large pieces of luggage will need to go in the shared space, which is quite spacious. Kitchen, bathroom are all clean. There are two nice parks within walking distance, as well as a whole foods market. Bus route 66 stops right across the street in front of a car rental place.

Overall, would stay again.
"
5969872,42610135,2015-08-14,27115967,Shana,We had a really great time at Seattle. The appartment is really nice and clean just the air matress were bad. Joachim is a really nice guy.

5969872,49312063,2015-10-03,10703555,Ellyn,"Neighborhood is easy walk to University of Washington and Green Lake. There is parking on the street.  Room is small, home is quiet and clean,and kitchen is available. Joachim and Allie are great hosts, warm, welcoming and attentive. "
5969872,50376079,2015-10-11,45461426,Taryn,Listing is very accurate.  Bed is small but comfortable and the house overall was clean and welcoming.  Thanks for a great stay!  
5969872,52327805,2015-10-28,44204472,Katherine,"The host wasn't able to be there, but was Very kind and welcoming over the phone, when he was able to get back to me.
Fresh flowers were on the kitchen table, and even little Halloween plates were on the counter !
"
5969872,56380918,2015-12-13,24123641,Cara,"I really enjoyed my stay with Joachim. The room was great, just as described, enough room for me and my clothes for the 5 weeks. Location was excellent, right opposite a bus stop which went to the U district and downtown. Great cafes and supermarkets dotted around close as well. Joachim was a great and friendly host. "
5969872,57267406,2015-12-23,20978189,John,"I live nearby and needed to be closer to work for 5 days so the room served it's purpose for my needs as I was only home during the late evenings. The restroom that comes with the room is located upstairs and was always clean and available for my use. 

The room itself is small and the bed was more of a memory foam placed on top of frame/ flat surface. It actually flipped on me as I rolled over during my sleep however it was manageable. I will say the sheets and comforter were nice though.

All said, I would stay here again given the same needs for the space."
3033913,38321812,2015-07-14,5076760,Charlie,Clean accommodations. Flexible administration. Would recommend.
3033913,38542342,2015-07-16,37439033,Kristen,"Jenell was very welcoming, provided toiletries, free wifi and parking. Easy to get a hold of via text. Washer and dryer working with detergent provided. "
3033913,38758538,2015-07-18,27507133,Terri,Jenell was helpful and pleasant to work with. She was quick to answer my questions. Her studio apartment was extremely convenient to find and to use as a home base during our short downtown Seattle visit. I would stay again. 
3033913,39685967,2015-07-25,38521713,Kathleen,Jenell was a very responsive host. Very shortly after our booking she initiated contact and worked to make us feel very comfortable. Our stay was lovely and the location is amazing. We parked our car upon arrival and didn't need to use it until our departure. This was our first experience and I am very happy that Jenell was our host. 
3033913,40618768,2015-08-01,36900681,Marisela,"Our experience was great! The apartment has a perfect location, close to everything and Jenell was a great host putting little details that made our stay very placent. The apartment is very modern and clean perfect for 1, 2 or 3 people. "
3033913,40948358,2015-08-03,37171398,Jeff,The apartment contained everything we needed and could not have been in a better location.  We felt welcomed and there were small touches throughout the unit that really made it special.  The parking was a huge bonus and allowed easy access across the city even though we could walk to most of the main attractions.  There is an amazing shared deck overlooking the water right by the unit that we really enjoyed.  Would definitely recommend and will be coming back.
3033913,42717180,2015-08-15,4042558,Emily,"Super nice, clean studio!  Close to Pike Place, very walkable.  Easy access garage.  Jenell made it very easy to stay at her place and was super available."
3033913,43781305,2015-08-22,21368218,Ben,"The best thing about Jenell's place is the incredible location. We were very close to most anything we wanted to see, especially some of Seattle's best attractions (half mile to Space Needle area, half mile to Pike's Market, a few blocks from Olympic park). Everything was very easy to get to. 

Apartment was nice and had a really nice shared balcony just across the hall. It was a little warm in the room, but Jenell provided fans, so it wasn't too bad. 

Jenell was great and attentive to any question we had. She even provided a pack and play so that our baby could have somewhere to sleep!

Would stay again. "
3033913,44925772,2015-08-30,38027348,Brian,"great location for visiting seattle. very centrally located to many of the things you will want to see and do and easily within walking distance to all of them. the place was very nicely decorated and had great attention to detail. it also came with all the amenities you probably would want or hope for.  would stay there again if in seattle. also, jenell checked in frequently to make sure everything was going ok and we didnt need anything-something that was unexpected but very nice to have in the event that something went wrong. "
3033913,45475274,2015-09-03,405161,Madeleine,"Everything was great!
Location was perfect, bakery/coffee place and a small market right downstairs, plenty of bars and restaurants in easy walking distance, and a quick cab to other tourist spots.
The condo was as pictured but better than we anticipated - great little balcony for morning coffee, bed and pullout both comfortable, and some great little extra touches like condiments, spare towels and brew coffee provided.
Jenell was easy to contact by text and had left helpful hints and a bunch of brochures, maps etc to make our time better.
Thanks so much, we had a blast."
3033913,46015001,2015-09-07,8207975,Prateek,Great location; loved it. Ideal to experience the Seattle city life; walking distance to all key attractions and restaurants. Jenell did a great job with the instructions prior to our trip; made it easy. 
3033913,46715559,2015-09-13,36071998,Gary,"Jenell was very nice and exceedingly responsive. Getting into the condo and the terrific parking space were both easy things to do. The location is absolutely terrific. Walking to the Pike Market Place takes just a few minutes but one can also easily walk to the Space Needle in just over a few minutes and even Lake Union is walkable for those who crave the exercise. The view from the common area deck (which is steps from Jenell's condo) is sensational. Having a washer-dryer in such a small condo was a real achievement and very handy. Wireless was perfect--no issues. Overall, an excellent experience and I am happy to recommend it. "
3033913,47154551,2015-09-16,37365569,Nikki,"We loved our stay at Jen's place!  Perfect location - walkable to all the major attractions (Pike's Place Market is just down the street, the Space Needle and museums are close too) and, for those out of walking reach neighborhoods like Fremont, the buses are easy to navigate and arrive on time.  I loved the dedicated parking space (so much easier than trying to find and pay for parking in Seattle)!

The studio is large for a studio or I'm used to East Coast studios - the sleeping nook was more of a mini-room than a portion of the living room and the bathroom was large (for any condo).  The small porch overlooking the courtyard provided a nice place to relax during sunsets and the shared porches provided a nice place to relax and watch the sunset over the water.

We'd definitely stay here again!"
3033913,48359681,2015-09-25,38715460,Joey,"Loved our location! Walkable to pikes place, shopping, and great restaurants. The studio was clean, cozy, and all the amenities you can ask for. Jenell was easy to communicate with and responded to any questions quickly. We'd definitely stay there again in a heart beat. "
3033913,51844646,2015-10-24,29040837,Scott,Jen's place was wonderful!  It's in a great location within walking distance to everything. Parking was great. Communication with her was easy and fast.
3033913,52022565,2015-10-25,28582215,Pat,"This is by the far the best AirBNB experience to date and it will be extremely difficult to top! You can tell Jenell has been doing this for years because she had every single detail flawlessly executed. The microwave even had a bag of popcorn waiting for you!!! 
It smelled like the gates of Heaven and beaches immediately upon entering! The patio is tiny but perfect for coffee and a little chill sesh overlooking the courtyard from the TOP floor. The bed was super cozy as were the futons! The carpets were freshly cleaned I could tell...everything was IMMACULATELY cleaned! I felt as if I had lived there for years! Oh and the parking is crucial, just please remember to give her back her pass! Once the car is parked, you are a half mile walking distance to EVERYTHING! Pikes Market, the Space Needle, the water, the Aquarium! 
We kept in contact via text and I felt as if I was asking a friend for questions/advice rather than some person! She was absolutely AMAZING! There was zero things wrong with my stay...you will not be sorry! Read no further...BOOK THIS NOW!"
3033913,52530359,2015-10-30,24620846,Molly,"I booked Jen's apartment for 2 of my co-workers, who were attending a conference nearby.  They said the apartment was clean and had most amenities (minus toothpaste) and the location was very convenient to the conference location and some good restaurants.  Jen was very communicative and helped to make the rental experience very smooth.  Thanks, Jen! :)"
3033913,54011434,2015-11-15,47417505,Chad,This was our first experience with Airbnb and Jenell made it awesome. She was always one step ahead on communication and answered all of our questions quickly. This wasn't a 5 star luxury apartment but it was a solid 4 stars. Everything was super clean. The location was perfect. Garage parking (included) was a HUGE bonus. The building was secure with lots of amenities. And there is an awesome bakery (Macrina) on the ground floor which you have to try! And if you like pinball - there is a cool Clown/Coney Island themed dive bar a couple blocks away called Shorty's. The bed here was comfortable and the bathroom was a good size. Kitchen was small but complete... The tiny balcony was nice and had a cool view of the courtyard. Perhaps the only thing lacking was the living room furniture which wasn't very comfortable but it wasn't a bid deal. I would stay here again!
3033913,54151067,2015-11-16,47293724,Ryan,The place is just as posted great location even better quality of  room
3033913,55241752,2015-11-29,47937131,Shelley,"Two thumbs up for this fantastic place!  Jenell is a wonderful host who lays out all you need to know perfectly!  The condo was clean, quiet and safe and made for a comfortable stay for the 5 of us!  The decor was warm and inviting.  The ability to walk to so many attractions, restaurants, shops and bars was a huge plus!  Thanks Jen for making our family time extra special!"
3033913,55534264,2015-12-01,5820356,Sophie,"Great location, easy walk to all the most popular Seattle attractions and restaurants. Nice, safe & quiet neighbourhood. House was clean and comfortable with modern decor - would stay gain "
3033913,55632868,2015-12-03,6454370,Jody,Perfect stay for a quick trip down to Seattle from Vancouver on business.
3033913,55973670,2015-12-07,49939057,Kimberly,"Jenell is such an awesome host! She was so easy to reach and reliable. This was my first experience using Airbnb and since it was so positive it won't be my last. The apartment is centrally located between the Space Needle & Pike Place Market. It's easily walkable to either and there a lot of restaurants/bars right down the block. The apt also included all your necessary toiletries, towels, bedding, and even a washer and dryer with detergent! The parking spot was also really helpful because we rented a car. Definitely recommend this apt!"
3033913,56204082,2015-12-10,19039433,Erin,"Jenell was an AMAZING Host and was always very willing to answer questions!   The location of this can't be beat and you're really not going to find anything better in BellTown at this price!  We were within walking distance of everywhere we wanted to be.  The apartment was clean and nice and we loved having a pool!   Would definitely stay here again!  Thanks again, Jenell!!! "
3033913,56576990,2015-12-14,51027817,Dena,"We loved this Belltown condo.  Close to everything.  Tons of excellent bars and restaurants (and a bakery!) within walking distance.  Convenient, quiet, free parking,  it was fabulous.  Excellent location.  We would love to stay again.  It was perfect for us.  Jenell was helpful, welcoming, friendly, accommodating and professional."
1145148,5117569,2013-06-13,841053,Kristal,"What a wonderful stay we had at Gardenlife Sanctuary!  From the cozy sleeping accommodations to the peaceful and beautiful yard...we couldn't have found a more enjoyable place to stay on our recent visit to Seattle.  The home is a quick drive to the beach and only 15 minutes to Safeco & CenturyLink Field (avoiding all the crazy traffic).  Jessie Rey & Maketa were perfect hosts.  They prepared a map to help us navigate around the area as well as instructions to help with items in the home.  If you are considering Gardenlife Sanctuary, you won't be disappointed."
1145148,6119054,2013-07-30,7631174,Shauna,"A lovely, relaxing, peaceful retreat to come ""home"" to after a full day of sightseeing in Seattle. The garden was enchanting, and we stayed outdoors as late as possible playing bubbles, talking, and lounging in the hammock. The interior is tastefully styled, and little bouquets, leaves, and live plants bring the charm of the garden inside the home. The alleyway neighborhood looks a little rough, but once you get inside the driveway, it feels like your own little sanctuary. We felt safe and the guys walked around the neighborhood for snacks and to pick up a few meals - no problems. The energy in the garden and the home is serene, peaceful, and energizing.  

There's no microwave in the home, and although we don't use one in our home either (EMF!), the other couple with us found it odd. Just plan ahead to use the oven and stove, and you'll be fine. There is also no TV cable, but the Apple device connected to our iPhones seamlessly, and we were able to stream Netflix and Hulu. Again, not a huge issue with us since we spent most of our time outdoors and sightseeing.

Overall, this was  LOVELY place to stay, and we will DEFINITELY be contacting Jessie Rey and Maketa again next time we're in town!! "
1145148,6399221,2013-08-11,5355142,Danny,"Great place to stay while in Seattle. Jesse and Maketa's place is tucked away in a quiet neighborhood away from the hustle and bustle of Seattle, which is a short bus ride away. The place was clean and plenty of room for my group. I highly recommend."
1145148,6472225,2013-08-13,3964043,Allison,"GardenLife Sanctuary was a delightful place to stay with a beautiful yard and gardens.  The home was immaculately clean and well organized, complete with fresh flowers in every room.  Jessie Rey and Maketa also provided a house manual and info about the neighborhood.  They were always very prompt in responding to messages and provided a neighbor's contact information in case we needed immediate assistance.

My family and I very much enjoyed our time there, both in the home and in the yard, where we had a lovely picnic dinner to celebrate both of my sisters getting married.

I highly recommend GardenLife Sanctuary to other Airbnb guests."
1145148,6942593,2013-08-31,661595,Antonio,"I could not met Jessie Rey & Maketa in person, but the service was great,  the house ws in great condition, written instructions for everything, so we were very pleased with the house. I only stayed one night, but everything is great.  the garden is beautiful,  so thank you for evrything Jessie and Marketa, and hoepfully next time I could stay longer!    regards  Antonio"
1145148,13479022,2014-05-28,14318541,Kera,"Jessie Rey and Maketa were amazing hosts. They let us check in early, and the house and backyard were pristine. The bathroom was also amazing. They even left some nice Trader Joe's shampoo/conditioner/body wash. How cool is that? Even though the house was SO CLOSE to downtown, it was extremely quiet and serene in the backyard. Awesome house. We definitely plan on booking this house the next time we come to Seattle."
1145148,15119059,2014-07-02,710660,Matt,"What a fabulous place, a truly serene setting only 10 mins from downtown. The place really felt like a home away from home, and both front and back gardens -as the listing suggests - were sanctuaries from the hustle-and-bustle of city life. Jessie Rey left great instructions for us, which let us enjoy the highlights of the neighbourhood, and feel like a true local! Highly recommended - our only regret is that we didn't stay longer..."
1145148,15755620,2014-07-15,409246,Andres,Experience dealing was smooth and very prompt. The place is just as described. A quiet and serene atmosphere. I would definitely repeat if I had the opportunity and I highly recommend it.
1145148,17672262,2014-08-16,14120093,Nova,"This home was as presented in its ad. Very comfortable rooms throughout, with ample room for relaxation inside, where several good-sized windows can be opened to let the cool, fresh Seattle breezes flow thru. The table & chairs on the elevated deck overlook the charming yard & gardens, providing a delightful place to dine or just chill. The location is awesome: downtown by reliable,  on-time bus route 120 in under 15 mins. Good neighborhood coffee shops, creperie, pizza, pho, Italian & Mexican eateries within easy walking distance. Also a 10 min walk to a beautiful urban forest trail walk. Having full kitchen and laundry in-house makes extended stay easy-peasy. Highly recommended!"
1145148,36969989,2015-07-03,33129402,Malte,"Nice house with high porch, overlooking a beautiful little garden. Great location for easy access to city center. 
No access to washer/dryer was a bit inconvenient for a longer stay (but known from stated information). No microwave."
1145148,39917598,2015-07-27,13580456,Shan,"My husband and I traveled with another couple to Seattle for the weekend. We chose this house in large part because both of the gentlemen are fairly big guys, so it was important to find a place with two beds that were at least queen-sized, and we were happy to find that here. The house is exactly as it looks, with the best features being the deck and backyard. Very private and relaxing. The hosts were extremely helpful without intruding at all, and very easy to communicate with. We found West Seattle to be super convenient and fun, and would definitely stay in that area again. A great time had by all!"
1145148,41069435,2015-08-04,19755023,Marisa,"The Sanctuary was exactly as described, a beautiful home. The owners were very mindful of what a guest would want. They left us everything we could need, a stocked fridge even! 

The drawers and closets they wanted private were clearly marked, and we were left plenty of space for ourselves, which made me as a guest feel better about being in their home. 

Perfect location to get in and out of town fast via our rental car or an Uber driver. They made our first trip to the Pacific Northwest amazing. Some afternoons we would just watch Netflix and sit in the house with the cool breeze."
1145148,42267533,2015-08-12,17012544,Derrick,"Very smooth booking and communications with Jessie Rey. The house was well kept, clean and comfortable.  We had a great time and would highly recommend the house. "
4218733,21015114,2014-10-09,22026184,Mike,"Very nice basement apartment, clean with all the amenities. Super close to a park we frequented with our dog. In the early mornings there was always a dog or two out for her to play with. Henry also helped us by letting us reserve a couple of extra nights because we were in a bind."
4218733,21493866,2014-10-18,1867172,Ben,This was a great place in a perfect location. Very close to all the shops/restaurants/bars in Upper Queen Anne. Would stay here again!
4218733,21616615,2014-10-20,8180018,Alan,"Henry's apt was a very welcome and clean place. It's walking distance to a little main street area w/ shops and bars and also a very short cab ride (or a ~$5 Uber ride) to the Belltown area where lots of nightlife is. One thing to note is that the sound does carry from the floor above so you may hear some footsteps, especially if sleeping in late. Not a big issue but something to note. Overall I would recommend it. "
4218733,21972995,2014-10-27,1035959,Joey,"Henry's apartment in Queen Anne was great. It was in a convenient location near shops and restaurants, and a short cab ride to Capitol Hill. The apartment was clean and spacious enough for 3-4 people. Henry was also flexible enough with the check-out, and allowed my friends to leave their luggage in the apartment until their evening flight on check-out day. We really enjoyed our stay, and would definitely book Henry's apartment again. Thank you!"
4218733,22074706,2014-10-29,22050055,David,"Very convenient and comfortable place for our stay in Seattle. Queen Anne is a pleasant neighbourhood in itself to stay but equally close enough to downtown via über or walking to get the most out of the city. 

The place provides everything you need. The sofa bed is among the more comfortable that we have experienced. "
4218733,22285106,2014-11-02,18136911,Mckenzie,"Clean, comfortable, and convenient. Henry's rental is in a great location. It was a great experience. "
4218733,22336064,2014-11-03,7184239,Brooke,"We were disappointed with the property. The entry is in an alley which is not ideal, the door was damaged and appeared to be glued, and the property was not clean. 

Henry was accommodating when we asked to have an additional guest stay at the property."
4218733,22563557,2014-11-09,19230482,Alyssa,My friend and I had a great experience staying in this home. The location is excellent; close to all the fun but far enough away to relax. Uber rides downtown are very inexpensive!
4218733,22601063,2014-11-10,16885781,Cyndy,Did not have chance to meet Henry but was good communication and easy to find and access apartment. Location is great on Queen Anne Hill which is a charming and very walkable location. Amenities of apartment were as described. Did only a one night stay but would easily accommodated  lo get stay with kitchen amenities
4218733,22994032,2014-11-19,13920818,Kris,Henry had a lovely space and was convienently located to all the major attractions downtown.  It was about a 10 minute drive to everything.  The home is located in a great neighborhood with a great dog park just around the block (which worked out great for me and my pup!).  He had all the comforts of home readily available and the water pressure from the shower was excellent (always a deal breaker for me!).  I will def stay at Henry's again and suggest this space for anyone looking for reasonable accomodations close to the city but not caught up in all the hub bub!
4218733,23189943,2014-11-24,12214085,Daniel,Henry was an awesome host!  Response times to my initial inquiry and all subsequent communications were fast and efficient. Instructions were clear and everything is exactly as I was expected and pictured.  When I say he was awesome it was because he was there if we needed anything and WASN'T there when we didn't.  Perfect AirBnB experience.  Thanks again!
4218733,23451949,2014-12-01,1223410,Jasmine,"LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION! So easy to walk to Queen Anne for great coffee shops (Storyline?), restaurants and shops. Trader Joes, Safeway and a great natural health store are a 5 minute walk. Traveling with kids? There's a great park and rec centre less than a block away. Kitchen was a bit sparse but Henry was quick to supply us with an extra mug when needed. Has a coffee machine (bring filters) and an assortment of cooking ware (some have seen better days but sufficient). Overall this place could be a bit cleaner (sheets weren't changed when we arrived), but having access to laundry was great! Henry and his son went above and beyond in inviting our son to play upstairs in their space and even provided a few toys. It was nice to not worry about our son being too loud and rambunctious:)."
4218733,24325349,2014-12-26,2767065,Mimi,"I booked Henry's place for my in-laws who were visiting for the holidays, and this was perfect for them. They were very confortable staying here. Henry was a great communicator and this apt. is in a great location. They loved the trader joes that was near by.  :)"
4218733,24533997,2014-12-30,6342825,Sand,"We really enjoyed staying here! 

Pros: Location, parking, pet-friendly, cute minimalist yet home-y decor, Apple TV, board games. Henry was super nice and responsive. He was also really flexible and kind enough to let us check in early. 

Cons: Cleanliness was decent but not great. We'd give this 3/5 stars...it needed a good deep cleaning. It was pretty dusty in some places, and the bathroom trash wasn't taken out before we got there. We wondered if this was because we asked to check in early. The neighborhood is really quiet, yet there were two issues with noise. One was that you could hear some running (little kid feet) upstairs. We didn't mind it so much because it wasn't at odd hours or above the bedroom, but I could see how it might bother other guests. The other thing is that the heater is pretty loud in the bedroom, and it did wake us up a couple times.

If we could give 3.5 stars, we would. It was somewhere between average and great."
4218733,25141873,2015-01-07,24739322,Aaron,"The place was comfortable, in a great place, and Henry was a great host. It was easy to walk to places to get coffee in the mornings and there was plenty of street parking in case you end up renting a car. There was nothing at all to complain about during the stay!"
4218733,25388686,2015-01-14,11263976,Christina,"Henry is an amazing host. He is so easy to communicate with and is very accommodating. The home is perfect with everything you need. The location is great with grocery stores, restaurants, cafes, and public transportation just steps away. I will definitely being staying here anytime I'm in Seattle!"
4218733,25679384,2015-01-23,19986167,Barry,"Henry is a very hospitable and gracious host. He is very friendly and helpful. His communications, both in person and via text, were very helpful and made for a delightful stay. 

His apartment is located in a convenient spot on Queen Anne close to bus routes, excellent restaurants, grocery stores, shops and fun boutiques. The apartment is very clean and well maintained with all of amenities of home--a very comfortable place to stay if you're visiting Seattle.

I was at his apartment the day of the 2015 Seahawks breathtaking win of the NFC Championship. He invited me to his home to watch the game on his 105"" screen home theater with his 3 year old son, Westin. What a treat that was! It was a very memorable Seattle experience. 

Thanks Henry and Westin! I look forward to coming back."
4218733,25803862,2015-01-26,19980933,Sheryl,Henry was very accommodating and welcoming. My husband ad I stayed 3 nights while visiting our daughter and family who just recently moved to Queen Anne. Comfortable bed ad nice warm shower. Very close to Quee Anne Avenue shops and restaurants. Information Henry provided was accurate and helpful. 
4218733,25967639,2015-01-31,1335019,Matt,"This is a great place up on Queen Anne hill. Very quiet yet near plenty of grocery stores an cafes. Henry clearly put some time and resources into renovating the apartment. The bathroom and kitchen were particularly nice, and we spent a lot of time cooking food there. 

We were two people looking for two beds in separate rooms, and this was a great arrangement for the price. The pullout couch in the living room was quite comfortable. 

One of our favorite perks was the free access to the washer and dryer. So nice when you're in town for a while, or just coming in from the rain. "
4218733,26605574,2015-02-16,25972327,Michelle,Henry was great! He was very accommodating and the place was very nice and cozy and clean. Thank you for a wonderful experience. 
4218733,27645969,2015-03-09,526523,Laura,"We enjoyed staying here for 3 weeks with our little dog. Henry was very kind and accommodating to us. The place was very clean and cozy. We really liked how comfortable our bed was! The Apple TV  (with HBO Go) was really nice to have as well. It was great to have within walking distance, a park (one block away), Trader Joe's, and Storyville Coffee. We would stay here again! "
4218733,27819670,2015-03-12,17088201,Zhi,"Book this place! 
Can’t say enough great things about Henry and his space. On my first interaction with Henry, he waived my extra person fee for a day and when I had a last minute schedule change, he allowed me a late check out until 9 pm! Henry has a lot of attention to detail, and that was clear from the moment I booked my trip. He provided very clear instructions on check in, and created a very thorough guide on where things are in the room and where to go in the neighborhood. Not having to worry about those things really put me at ease!
The space itself is very homey and there's all the amenities anyone could possibly want, tv, laundry, board games and a private kitchen area. There is also a memory foam topper on the bed, so it's extremely comfortable. I had the chance to try some of the things recommended in the guest book, and walking around the neighborhood made me fall in love with this place! Really had a very pleasant experience and would highly recommend to anyone. :)"
4218733,28465841,2015-03-24,485950,Chris,"My parents stayed in Henry's apartment when they were here visiting from out of town. The place was great! Clean, neat and super functional. It's a cozy little apartment in a great location. My parents couldn't have been happier!"
4218733,28607498,2015-03-27,19145751,Wayne,"The listing is pretty much on par to the description, and the pictures tell it all.  Our stay was very comfortable, everything was very clean, grabbing the keys was the easiest we ran into on our road trip of a few other cities.  The space was also very private, we didn't run into Henry at all, although we knew he was upstairs (think of apt living when someone is above you).  Nothing too crazy, pretty quiet for the most part during our stay except for one night, but it's understandable.  Instruction booklet is clear and bathroom was really nice and clean.  The location was great too.  I would consider staying here again in the future."
4218733,28794938,2015-03-30,14507494,Amanda,"Great place to stay in a quiet, beautiful neighborhood. Loved the shops and restaurants within walking distance! The place is very clean and well decorated. Thanks Henry! "
4218733,29056004,2015-04-03,2193115,Justin,"Great location. Henry was super helpful and accommodating. A cold beer in the fridge, comfortable bed and clean place. I'd definitely stay there again!"
4218733,29274134,2015-04-06,13409438,Rachael,"Henry's home has tons of amenities and he has put care into making it easy to navigate the home and the neighborhood. We appreciated the binder with information, felt comfortable in the home and found it perfect for two of us!"
4218733,29525236,2015-04-08,14737072,Kurt,This is the quietest airbnb I have ever stayed at.  Great location with a memory foam bed and pull out second bed.  My daughter and I used it as our base to explore UW and all of Seattle.  It fit the job perfectly and would come back here again. 
4218733,29648272,2015-04-10,27374028,Wendy,"The apartment was exactly as described. Queen Anne is a great neighborhood and we felt completely at home there. It is close to downtown and is walking distance to coffee shops and restaurants. 

Henry was very quick to respond. We would definitely stay there again!"
4218733,29737639,2015-04-12,82683,Geoff,"My friend and I spent a couple of days at Henry's place.  It's in a good location, short drive to downtown and close to restaurants and grocery stores. The place itself, the beds, the pillows are very comfortable but the suite was not very clean.   We brought this up with Henry, he replied right away and sent his cleaner the next day. Even though he said the cleaner had cleaned the place the morning we arrived.  Unfortunately the cleaner didn't do a good job.  Other than day, the sheets and towels were clean and Henry was very quick to respond to my emails and apologized for the inconvenience."
4218733,30241059,2015-04-19,9577989,Kelly,"Henry's hospitality was great! He checked in to make sure we had everything we needed. He had beers in the fridge and a cross-referenced map of restaurants, cafes and stores with descriptions & recommendations. The neighborhood was beautiful and quaint and the ""garden"" unit was only two blocks from Queen Anne Ave. The unit, while having somewhat low ceilings, was bright, clean and stylish. It was stocked with cooking utensils, coffee and coffee maker, toaster oven, blender, etc. Also, lots of clean towels and extra bedding. The bed was pretty comfortable, too! The TV had clear instructions, with tons of subscriptions on AppleTV and also a DVD player available for use.  There was also a dedicated parking spot that went along with the unit. It was just what we needed for our stay. :) "
4218733,30398377,2015-04-21,8502654,Will,"Henry's place is just fantastic. Clean, quiet, lovely, and incredibly convenient -- I never had any issues getting anywhere around town. Henry was quick to reach out to see if I needed anything, and quick to respond when I had questions about the neighborhood. Highly recommended!"
4218733,30928266,2015-04-29,28253486,Amy,"Henry's place was perfect! Great location to walk or uber to all you want to see and walking the neighbor hood is a treat! Cozy place with everything you need! Comfy bed, hot shower and all the supplies you need!  We were able to cook fresh fish from Pikes and had everything we needed :) I would recommend this to anyone who plans to stay in Seattle!"
4218733,31174990,2015-05-03,3846700,Dan,"Loved this place! Location was very good, get a great view of the Seattle skyline only a couple blocks away. Apartment is very well equipped and Henry left a detailed notebook with all the information you need for a visit, whether for a couple days or a week. "
4218733,31541715,2015-05-06,31537275,Molly,"We had a great experience during our time in Seattle.  Henry was responsive to our email questions, and made us feel welcome.  The description and photos were spot on.  The neighborhood is wonderful, and as described... a  walker's dream.  Good coffee and food were a walk away.  We would definitely recommend Henry's place to friends, and look forward to returning."
4218733,32634517,2015-05-19,20184224,Rome,"Awesome spot, easy parking, walking distance to great places to eat in Queen Anne as well!"
4218733,32982646,2015-05-24,17734547,Janice,"Henry, the host, is very welcoming and professional. The unit is just as described, even better! Everything works well, particularly the kitchen and sleeping areas. The interior colors are calming. The TV and video equipment are great. I think everything was just right! And, the neighborhood is super with a Trader Joe's and Safeway nearby. If you are on foot, the number 13 bus takes you right into town. 
Thank you, Henry!"
4218733,34083085,2015-06-04,3238525,Mark,"On the plus side: The place is very much as described, and it was clean, and is in a great location for both neighborhood activities and access to downtown and other areas of Seattle. Henry also has a ton of movies available to stream on the TV.
On the negative side: Though it does technically qualify as an ""entire home/apt"" unit - given that it does not share access or any rooms with the main house - it does get a lot of noise from the main house above, especially the child running around on what I assume are hardwood floors. So it doesn't always feel quiet or private. Henry hosted an afternoon party at the house one day while we were there (he gave us a few hours' notice and did offer us an invitation) and the noise was significant, though he did get the TV turned down when I requested it.
In all, it is a good place, but it may feel like a shared space when you stay here just because the sound carries."
4218733,34728324,2015-06-11,12225160,Kathryn,We loved the neighborhood! We were able to walk downtown and easily walk to coffee shops and restaurants. The space was perfect for my husband and two girls. Very clean and comfortable. Henry was good at communicating and we had no problems whatsoever.
4218733,34847037,2015-06-13,11921753,Catherine,Convenient location in great neighborhood and Henry provides a wealth of information. 
4218733,35540541,2015-06-20,19512155,Ashley,"Henry's apartment is a wonderful place to stay in Seattle!  You will be close to an adorable downtown area of Queen Anne as well as public transit.  The apartment is plenty spacious for a couple or small family.  Additionally, it's great if you want to stay in or go out. Henry was more than gracious in supporting any of our needs."
4218733,36659725,2015-06-30,407245,Stephen,"Incredible neighborhood: beautiful homes and gardens on every street, just a few blocks from some great cafes and restaurants. Really accessible to downtown. 

Apartment was comfortable for a group of four sharing one main bed and one pullout. Clean and comfortable. Henry was very accommodating, including shipping back a bag we left behind promptly and courteously! Thanks for our first great stay in Seattle!!"
4218733,37293610,2015-07-06,8682098,Xavier,Appartement propre et tout a fait adapté pour un séjour en famille à 4. Quartier calme et agréable avec des facilités pour se garer.
4218733,37776725,2015-07-10,74777,Niki & Colin,"We appreciated Henry being upfront with us.  When his construction team became available during our stay and there would be noise, he let us know and allowed us to cancel our reservation."
4218733,38104055,2015-07-13,4308009,Jessica,"Henry's place is in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood very close to some amazing coffee, restaurants, and shops. We appreciated being an easy walk to Pike's Place Market and downtown (an easy walk there... the return walk is straight uphill, just a warning! :) 

Henry's house had some unexpected construction going on at the time, and he was extremely accommodating and apologetic about the inconvenience, offering us a partial refund for our stay. 

The place itself was very basic and comfortable, nothing fancy, but it worked for us for the weekend. "
4218733,38980873,2015-07-20,22879176,Hugo,"O espaço é excelente e muito bem localizado. Existem mercado, farmácia e muitas lanchonetes e cafés bem perto da casa. Transporte público também é de fácil acesso. Henry deixa uma série de informações para que você possa se localizar e muitas dicas de lugares para comer. A casa estava limpa e tinha até algumas cervejas na geladeira. Foi uma ótima estadia!! Recomendo muito!!!"
4218733,39603428,2015-07-25,7940393,Megan,The fact that Henry is upstairs is great...he is very quick at responding to any needs. The neighborhood is (email hidden)pecially with kids...there is a great park...at the end of the alley..which was really fun. Everything was just like it had been explained...we loved the place and the (email hidden)ank you..it met our needs.
4218733,40886651,2015-08-03,586880,Raji,"I stayed one week with my wife and our 2 years old kid. 
The location in Queen Anne is perfect as it is a very nice neighbourhood and close to downtown. When needed, Henry was very responsive and helpfull.

There is not so much light in the apartment but as we visited Seattle and its surrounding during the day, it was not a problem.

Conclusion: I would recommend staying here!"
4218733,41924351,2015-08-10,20565125,Kyle,"The place was awesome, and exactly as described. Henry has made the place feel very welcoming and a great home away from home. The location is in a good spot close to many things and a perfect Uber pickup spot. Would recommend to friends and would stay here again."
4218733,42297283,2015-08-12,26932000,Adrienne,"I was very happy with our stay at Henry's place.  He was very easy to communicate with, the apartment was clean, the location is great, and the bed was the most comfortable one we had slept on since the beginning of our road trip.  You can at times hear him upstairs, but I am a light sleeper and didn't have any problems with noise.  I would definitely stay there again if we come back to Seattle!"
4218733,43028863,2015-08-17,767940,Daisung,"Nice place, close to transport and supermarket. Great place to stay for a small party. "
4218733,43617181,2015-08-21,15309643,Blanca,"Henry's place was great. The neighborhood was beautiful and very close to several places to eat. Getting to downtown was very easy and public transportation made it easy to move around the city. 

I would highly recommend Henry's place to anyone looking for a comfortable, quiet place to stay while visiting Seattle."
4218733,43930822,2015-08-23,865871,Eric,"House is in a great location and parking was an awesome feature. Perfect for two old college friends to set off and explore Seattle. We didn't spend much time in the unit, but we found everything to be fine for the price. We didn't interact with Henry due to our schedule and the independent nature of the place, but it was clear he and his family were about and was nice to know people were around if we had any urgent questions or issues. Also, a super-comfortable bed!"
4218733,44544963,2015-08-27,16624742,Gabriel,"Henry was fantastic! His place was perfect. It's a couple blocks from a small quaint strip of restaurants and grocery stores (There was a Pizza Place that was amazing!...Our favorite food we had on our entire trip.)

The unit is convenient and had everything. Henry was really quick to help out if we asked but also great about making us feel like we owned to place so we could feel at home after a day exploring Seattle. 

"
4218733,45244873,2015-09-01,225474,Flavilina,"It was nice stay at Henry's place. It's a quaint and quiet neighborhood filled with shops and a 24-hour Safeway that saved the day many times.

The apartment looked just like the pictures. It was great to have access to the washer + dryer, along with the broom and vacuum. I really loved the heater in the bathroom. After taking a shower, I just stood under there. If you stay here, you'll probably do the same thing. lol

We didn't use public transportation to get around because we relied on Uber. If one chooses to use the bus, I think it's the 2 line that gets you into downtown.

If you have any issues, Henry is quick to respond. We didn't have time to meet him but I'm sure he's nice."
4218733,45577197,2015-09-04,4260738,Christiana,"We really enjoyed our stay. Henry's apartment was as described and pictured, it was the right amount of space for us and our 1.5 yr old.  Being walking distance to restaurants, coffee shop and grocery stores was awesome and we appreciated not having to drive for every meal.  It's also a great location, ~10 mins drive time to most of Seattle's tourist attractions. Highly recommended!"
4218733,45791798,2015-09-06,1670797,Jonathan,"Though we didn't get a chance to meet Henry in person, he made the stay as smooth and comfortable as possible.  He checked in to make sure we were settled in and there was a great printed guide in the house.  Everything was pretty much as described and it was generally a wonderful stay.  Both the bed and sofa bed were extremely comfy and we slept well.  Only thing that dampened the experience a bit was that there was a mild musty odor when we first arrived..not a huge deal but it was noticeable.  Also, though it is definitely possible to walk to areas from this location, we preferred to have a car..it made things a lot easier to navigate around.  "
4218733,46124153,2015-09-08,8556386,Jaime,"Henry's place is in the cutest neighborhood and the home itself is quaint and very nice. We didn't have the chance to meet Henry in person but he was quick to respond from the day of booking. If you're looking to spend some time in Seattle without the hustle and bustle of city life, Henry's listing is definitely recommended! "
4218733,46706476,2015-09-13,35908897,Jimmy,Great location and great apt. Will stay there again!!!
4218733,47475805,2015-09-19,37431012,Mavis,"Henry's place is AMAZING!  It's such a beautiful and comfortable apartment.  The area is excellent, we found ourselves hanging around the local bars and shops more than downtown Seattle!  

It's a wonderful place to stay - HIGHLY recommended!
"
4218733,47622580,2015-09-21,314241,Al,"My wife and I enjoyed our stay very much. Thighs were clean, bed was comfortable and the TV had an Amazon Fire with all those new fangled subscriptions so we were plenty entertained in our down time. "
4218733,48414340,2015-09-26,42236869,Erin,"Henry was very hospitable and very accommodating. His place was an excellent spot to use as a base for exploring downtown Seattle. We very much appreciated the map with legend and Henry's recommendations for where to eat and what to do nearby were excellent. The grocery store, eateries, and bus stops to downtown were all within a 5 minute walk. Our 23 month old especially loved the park a block away. Thank you, Henry! "
4218733,49831068,2015-10-06,17131755,Tyler,"Didn't get to meet Henry but his place was perfectly set up. Really comfortable bed, nice bathroom, and a well equipped kitchen. I was able to stream all types of media from his Amazon Fire stick and there were some beers left in the fridge. Great place, perfect Queen Anne locations."
4218733,50208829,2015-10-10,43028383,Xiaochen,"Henry is a great host, although we don't have a chance to meet. He is really nice and reasonable host. His response is always quickly no matter what question I have. And even if I have to cancel the reservation due to some reason, he is willing to give me the full refund. Overall, it was a great experience."
4218733,50901799,2015-10-15,607193,Daniel,"Accurate listing, frictionless check-in/out with key box. Didn't meet Henry, but he was quick to respond to emails and provided everything we needed for our stay. Got in late and was surprised how quite, and residential the neighborhood was. The next morning realized that it was a 2.5 short block walk to a main drag with lots of good restaurants, two grocery stores, etc. Great spot."
4218733,51334389,2015-10-19,2465485,Lindsey,"This place is in a great location, tons of shops and restaurants just blocks away! We had a great stay here and I would definitely recommend it. "
4218733,52863167,2015-11-02,11247155,Larry,"Great, spacious, modern  apartment, with everything you need, (including a cold beer in the fridg). Parking out front.
Super location, easy walk to the heart of Queen Anne where there are great restaurants (Betty restaurant for one) and bars (try Paragon). From there its a easy bus ride ( or walk) to everything Seattle has to offer."
4218733,54358130,2015-11-18,10033462,Kristen,"My husband, baby girl, and I had a great stay in Henry's basement apartment. He was an excellent host and checked in with me via text message to see how our stay was going. The apartment was great for what we needed, nothing super fancy but cute decor, spacious, a washer and dryer, fully functional kitchen, and a parking spot! It's in a nice area with plenty of restaurants nearby and it's only a short drive to the Space Needle, Pike Place Market, and downtown shopping. "
4218733,56855794,2015-12-19,6724,Michelle,"Henry's place was perfect for my parents' visit. The space was spacious, very clean and the neighbourhood was lovely! Henry checked in to make sure they were okay and didn't need anything; very kind of him! I'll definitely send other guests his way. "
4218733,57145422,2015-12-22,36840419,Eleven,"The whole set is cute and comfortable. Warm in such a raining whether. Different kinds of cooking tools look good though I did not have time to cook. The surroundings are really quiet, safe and convenient. "
4218733,58120885,2016-01-01,15481444,Joyce,"We had everything we needed in Henry's apartment, and he always made himself available in case of questions or problems.  It was a quiet, cozy place to come back to at the end of a busy day.  The Queen Anne neighborhood is safe and friendly, and conveniently close to downtown.  Highly recommend."
6278216,32290719,2015-05-16,4719246,Jason,"There was almost nothing positive about our experience with Isaiah and his rental. I rented this place for one night for my brother and his family who came down from Vancouver BC - communication was a difficult task in itself, It was hard to get a clear check-in time - not to mention when I called, I felt like I was it was an inconvenience. I found out that  Isaiah does not manage the place, but his neighbor Henry does and also seemed put out by the responsibilities included. For the rate that is being asked, my expectations would be a lot higher - my brothers family was not able to stay in the home as it was too filthy. The bed was not made, only sheets & blankets provided, the trash had not been removed, dust covered all surfaces in the apartment, mold in the shower, pictures did not represent the actual space and the last straw was having to pick out the pillow that was the least stained. My advice? Hire a maid! Nobody should be spending $100 / night to sleep in such conditions. I was extremely disappointed and upset my brother had to scramble to load up his family and kids late at night and take them to a hotel nearby. 

Spend your money elsewhere, there are plenty of other hosts who want to give you the experience you deserve and hold up to the Airbnb reputation.

"
6278216,32605565,2015-05-19,32717215,Patrick,"Great place right in the middle of the action in Capitol Hill. Isaiah was very helpful and responsive during the whole process. Nice, safe area with plenty of options for food and nightlife around. Would stay again."
6278216,32777470,2015-05-21,29401103,Autumn,"Amazing apartment for the price. Has everything you will need for a trip to Seattle! I would recommend especially if you are using public transportation - our car window did get smashed in at the closest lot, but that is to somewhat to be expected, especially in Capitol Hill - there has been a lot of this lately, so I'm told! Anyways, apartment is nice, clean & spacious. Construction begins around 8am right outside the window so if you are late risers this may be an issue, though it didn't bother us & host does provide earplugs (we didn't need them). "
6278216,33175117,2015-05-25,33196864,Alisa,"The location was great. It's in a very lively neighborhood and all of Isaiah's food recommendations were yummy. The apartment is a spacey studio, clean and basic. The apartment does not have a tv, but my group did not stay in the apt much since the neighborhood was so fun, and extremely gay friendly. An uber to the light rail was only $5, and $8 to century link. You can also walk from the light rail if your luggage is not too heavy. "
6278216,38649779,2015-07-17,11951275,Mikaël,"I had a great time in Isaiah's apartment in Seattle, between Pine and Pike in Capitol City (10-15 minutes from downtown walking downhill but there's a bus stop less than 200 yards away). With lots of bars in the vicinity (a campus is nearby) it actually reminded me of my college years - which is a good thing! :-).
Three specific notes: if you are a cleaning freak this may not be the place for you; the mattress is extremely firm - something I personally appreciate but which might not suit everybody; and yes, there is construction work starting early in the morning very close by (but clean earplugs are provided).
All in all a great place to stay for a solo traveler like myself!"
6278216,46088129,2015-09-07,4512096,Dirk,"We had a great stay at Isaiah's Apt. Capital Hill is probably the best area to stay in Seattle with downtown in walking distance and some great food/nightlife around the corner. Isaiah always responded very quickly and had some great food recommondations. He couldn't be there when we arrived, which was our fault because we were later than expected, it was easy to get access to his apt. There was a very cheap carpark two blocks away if needed. Would stay there again."
6278216,46846062,2015-09-13,43645782,Brian,"I contacted Isaiah the morning before we needed to stay in his apartment. He responded promptly within the hour (even during regular weekday work hours) which was great because we were running out of time to book a place!

Checking-in was seamless. There is even a parking garage less than a block away (Seattle Central College) for $5.00 a day.

The location was perfect for our needs. We were within walking distance of Pike Place Market, Downtown, the Space Needle, and SLU.

The apartment complex is quite old, but his studio was very clean and simple. We needed two beds, so Isaiah offered a regular queen bed & frame in the main bedroom as well as a full size mattress that was placed on the floor in the living room. The pull-out doors worked nicely to close off the main bedroom from the rest of the studio. The sheets were freshly washed, so no concern over cleanliness, but were well-used and could stand to be replaced.

As Isaiah warned, there is still a good bit of construction in progress right next to the complex, so beware of the noise factor. They get started early in the morning...even on weekends. If you plan on being out and about early each day as we were, it shouldn't be a big issue.

Overall it was a great location and great value! Would recommend!
"
6278216,49751453,2015-10-05,1728586,Jason,Great apartment in an awesome location.....easy to get around.
6278216,51419854,2015-10-19,26877391,Susie,Great location and it was really easy to get ahold of isaiah. He gave us lots of food recommendations which was very helpful
1256892,5222096,2013-06-18,5961656,Jacob,"Thanks for a great stay Laurie!.... My co-workers and I really enjoyed the hospitality and very cozy accommodations.  You B and B is clean, comfortable, and quite an amazing location. We will certainly check in with you the next time we are in Seattle.  Cheers,

Jacob"
1256892,5332152,2013-06-24,6951621,Joshua,"Laurie was a fantastic host. She was very accommodating and attended to anything we needed while also giving us our space and freedom. The place was very clean, comfortable and spacious. The breakfast was great. It was well above and beyond what we expected. They just got wifi and it has a strong, reliable connection. Their neighborhood has a number of cafes and restaurants that visitors should definitely check out. We especially liked the Phinney Market Pub. The location is easily accessible, especially by car, with the I-5 and 99 highways in close proximity. Enjoy!"
1256892,5406578,2013-06-28,142290,Breanden,"Definitely an exceptional Airbnb experience. Laurie was very helpful, respectful, and always responsive. She went out of her way to have food, coffee, and drinks available throughout the entire stay, which was extremely convenient because I was working so much. I have used Airbnb all over the world as both a renter and a tenant, and this is the first time I ever opened a fridge to see exactly what I needed. I really appreciated it.
"
1256892,5498056,2013-07-02,5999349,Allana,"We enjoyed our stay with at Daisy Mae's B&B very much. Laurie is a welcoming host. She responded to my inquiries promptly and was flexible about check in times. She provided lots of information and tips about the local neighbourhood. The fridge was stocked with healthy snacks when we arrived and she brought fresh muffins in the morning which were delicious. The B&B is bright and clean. It easily accommodated our party of two couples. We enjoyed the books and the sitting area in the back yard. We sometimes heard our hosts walking around upstairs, particularly in the sitting room, but we didn't find it bothersome. The neighbourhood is quiet and there are many restaurants, cafes and shops within walking distance as well as Green Lake and the Woodland Park Zoo. We would recommend Daisy Mae's B&B to anyone looking for a place to stay in Ballard."
1256892,5588737,2013-07-07,2985648,Daniel,"Daisy Mae's was a very pleasant experience. Rented this space for my two out of state parents to stay at during a vacation trip. The host was very easy to work with, arranging our arrival at our convenience. The host did have guests sign additional documents surrounding the apartment's expected policies, wasn't expecting that, not sure if AirBnB's policies would suffice instead.

Overall a great experience, would rent this space again."
1256892,5668052,2013-07-10,7010899,Lauren,"My husband and I stayed with Laurie for a couple of days while we visited Seattle for the first time. It was fantastic! The place was comfortable and spacious, and it felt like we were returning to a home at the end of each day. Breakfast each morning was a treat, Laurie's homemade scones were out of this world! She was easy to keep in contact with and always looking to make our stay more pleasant. We would definitely stay here again."
1256892,5738535,2013-07-14,4482750,Hannah,"The purpose of my visit to Seattle was that I was moving there and had brought my mom along to help me find an apartment and move. Laurie and her adorable dog Daisy Mae met us on the first day of our stay at their gorgeous craftsman. The space was great; had everything that we could ever need during our short stay, including a kitchen and two places to sleep. Laurie stocked the fridge, and checked with us before our visit to see if we wanted any special items. She also brought us breakfast every morning (homemade muffins and scones; YUM!). I would absolutely recommend staying here for anyone's visit to Seattle! It is in a great neighborhood while still being close to everything and a very short drive to downtown. Although I now live in Seattle, I don't think my mom will stand to stay anywhere but here when she visits. "
1256892,5846913,2013-07-19,6867004,Carolina,"I was looking for a place for my parents to stay in their visit from Spain and Daisy Mae's fulfilled all our expectations. The place is very clean, in a very friendly neighborhood and Laurie is an excellent and very helpful host."
1256892,5924431,2013-07-22,7361724,Susan,"Clean, pretty, comfy space! Basically a roomy 1-bedroom apartment with your own entrance, full kitchen and a nice bathroom all to yourself. Close to everything in Phinney- walk to the 5 bus and tons of restaurants. We wanted to stay in our old neighborhood when we came back to Seattle for a wedding and this was absolutely perfect! It was like being home again. Laurie is very attentive but lets you do your own thing.  She should charge much much more.

My only complaint is that now that we are back home, my husband expects delicious fresh baked goods to magically appear every morning as they did at Laurie's. He has so far been disappointed. ;)"
1256892,5978158,2013-07-24,3615469,Donna,Laurie was a wonderful host. Our booking was replied to and accepted in a timely manner. She went out of her way to provide us with off street parking. The neighborhood was charming as was the house and our accommodations Laurie provided fresh berries and baked goods for each morning we were there. Lets not forget to mention our arrival greeting from our namesake Daisy Mae. She is a lovely lab!. 
1256892,6054536,2013-07-28,6962785,Ryan,"Had a great stay at Laurie's while visiting Ballard for my niece's first birthday. We had a delicious breakfast delivered every morning, and the fridge was stocked with juices, milk, yogurt, etc...along with a pod coffee maker. Neighborhood is beautiful and it's an easy walk to all of Phinney / Ballard. Thanks again!"
1256892,6325126,2013-08-08,6903424,Janna,"Most of the reviews already say it all. Laurie's place is supremely cozy and comfortable, and Laurie is exceptionally nice and inviting. Phinney Ridge is one of the safest and prettiest neighborhoods in Seattle, but with easy access to transportation. Laurie makes delicious breakfast treats and keeps the fridge in the private space for guests stocked with water, juice, and a few extras. Adorable and comfortable B and B. "
1256892,6381311,2013-08-10,6513669,Heather And Thomas,"We had a wonderful stay at Laurie's place!  It was an adorable apt.  The breakfast was wonderful, too.  You are a 30 minute easy bus ride to Pike Place and the bus stop is a 5 minute walk.  Within the area of this apt there are loads of restaurants and bars as well. The apt had everything we needed and was quite large, too! She was a very gracious host.  We highly recommend staying here. "
1256892,6541123,2013-08-16,7730878,Murray,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Daisy Mae's!  The space was comfortable and inviting.  There is an excellent library of books to peruse and its very easy to walk to nearby restaurants, Green Lake and a direct bus to Downtown.  The morning treats were delicious!  We would recommend it to anyone."
1256892,6591147,2013-08-18,39883,Rebecca,"We were in Seattle for a cousin's wedding, and had the pleasure of staying at Daisy Mae's! The space is clean, spacious and well stocked with coffee, tea and snacks. Walking around lively Pike's Place was quite shocking after 8 days of hiking around the National Parks, but coming ""home"" to Daisy Mae's B n' B was perfect. On our last night, we had to go downtown for rehearsal dinner and our cab never showed! After hearing our story, Laurie and her husband rescued us and drove us to the Pier. What a life saver! Thanks so much, Laurie, for your hospitality and kindness. We will remember you, always! And we'll see you the next time we're in Seattle :)"
1256892,6663643,2013-08-20,6409053,Gina,"Laurie was a great host. Her home is situated in a lovely neighborhood north of downtown Seattle. It allowed us to walk and explore Seattle like locals. There are lots of great local restaurants/shops within the Phinney Ridge/Greenwood area. The home itself is very spacious and clean with everything you need to enjoy your stay. My husband and I were thoroughly impressed by Laurie's attention to detail and thoughtfulness. She provided us with fresh food/beverages, DVDs, books, and great recommendations. Her co-host, Daisy Mae, is a beautiful yellow lab with a friendly disposition. After our stay, we headed to the airport where Laurie informed us that we had left our computer charger in the home. Laurie was kind enough to take it to the post office that day. I would definitely stay here again and recommend anyone looking to stay in Seattle to stay with Laurie (and Daisy)."
1256892,6900468,2013-08-29,7411404,Sara,"My husband and I spent three nights at Daisy Mae's.  Although Laurie was out of town during our stay, we communicated with her extensively before our visit and she gave us lots of information about her wonderful city.  While we were there, her friend brought us our daily breakfast of fresh-baked pastry and fruit, and even delivered our final day's breakfast the night before since we had an early flight.  Along with the well-stocked fridge with drinks, crudités, and yogurt plus granola and a coffee machine, we were well fed indeed.  The apartment was comfortable and clean, with thoughtful touches including toiletries, books, and board games.  Our stay was short and we were out much of the time, but the kitchen has a full stove and plenty of cooking equipment, so it would have been easy to prepare meals there.  Phinney Ridge is a pretty neighborhood, with nice homes, views of Puget Sound, an easy walk to shops and restaurants, and excellent access to recreational opportunities at nearby Green Lake.  I highly recommend Daisy Mae's to anyone visiting Seattle.  It's a lovely place to stay with a warm and friendly hostess, and excellent value for the money in a very expensive city."
1256892,6968995,2013-09-01,8120153,Lynne,"Daisy Mae's B&B is in a great location and neighborhood, close to everything. We enjoyed our stay, felt safe and the area is very quiet. We did hear walking above us as mentioned in her description of the rental but it was manageable. It was great waking up to fresh pastries in the morning. I did not get to meet the host because she was out of town but the whole rental process went very smoothly. Yes I would recommend her B&B. Very clean!!"
1256892,7042219,2013-09-04,7919623,Marc,"We loved our stay here.  Great place with ample space and comfort for a short -- or even -- extended getaway.  Breakfast was provided every morning and consisted of a tasty scone, granola, milk (even soy!), yogurt, and fresh berries.  The place was spotless, had thoughfully detailed instructions/messages, and included amenities such as DVD/TV (though no cable) with many movies, wi-fi, an impressive library of eclectic books.  Towels were provided as were some toiletries/shampoo/soap etc.  Since the apartment is below ground, the amount of natural light was somewhat limited but despite being very particular about lighting, I would have no reservation at all about recommending it.  A car is probably important as public transportation in Seattle is modest and to see the sites efficiently you do really need one.  The entire rental experience was seamless and excellent. "
1256892,7373412,2013-09-17,247898,Jenna,"Daisy Mae's B & B was fantastic! Clean, roomy and lovely. Plus Laurie is a fantastic baker and we loved the breakfasts! The area was great too and super close to some wonderful restaurants. Overall my brother and I have an amazing experience and would definitely stay again. Thanks again Laurie!


"
1256892,7681218,2013-09-29,3911252,Millard,Laurie could not be more hospitable; fresh scones and fruit on the weekends. The refrigerator was kept stocked with snacks and juice. She was very responsive to questions and requests. Very cozy situation. Only downside was the TV connection was unreliable. My wife was recovering from an operation so we were using the TV more than the average tourist so the TV proved to be a frustration for us.
1256892,8102461,2013-10-15,1918396,Nancy,"Although we did not meet Laurie, all details were communicated clearly. We did meet her husband & Daisy Mae who were both nice. Pastries and other provisions were great.  Apartment was clean and quiet. Very good location. We were pleased with the accommodations and would recommend Daisy Mae's to anyone."
1256892,8245367,2013-10-21,9488643,Erin,"I am so grateful to have found Daisy Mae's! It was perfect for me. In a charming neighborhood, great for walking, the apartment was super clean and has everything you could need, including really good coffee and delicious homemade hot baked goods in the morning. Super comfortable bed in a lovely clean apartment, with really delightful hosts who were very warm and kind, while giving me lots of space and privacy. I'd definitely stay there again, and recommend it highly!"
1256892,9018425,2013-12-02,3599730,Constance,"Laurie is a thoughtful and accommodating hostess.  The basement apt. is very clean, and well-stocked with books, full kitchen, vanity amenities.  It's perfect for 2 people, though it accommodates 3 with a pull-out in the living room.  Her blueberry muffins should be famous as they were healthful and delicious."
1256892,9546845,2014-01-02,6409053,Gina,"FIVE STARS!

This was our second time staying with Laurie and Daisy Mae. It once again exceeded our expectations. Laurie is a wonderful host! I would highly recommend staying here during your trip to Seattle, whether its for one night or one week. 

Our first time was in summer, and the B&B stayed nice and cool. The second time was in winter, and the B&B has space heaters that work very well. So regardless of the time of year, it's the perfect spot!

Did I mention the breakfast? Scones, muffins, yogurt, and lots of other goodies are available every day during your stay. Laurie was kind enough to supply us with coconut and almond milk as well! This is a remarkable value. 

Thank you again, Laurie and Daisy Mae, for the amazing stay! "
1256892,11230463,2014-03-25,13044284,Belen,"What wonderful stay at Daisy Mae's B&B!  The apartment is roomy and well-equipped with everything you could need to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable.  Laurie (and Daisy Mae, too, of course!) has thoroughly considered all the things that would make someone feel more ""at home"" while away from home, from a huge selection of books, myriad board games, yummy and healthy snacks in the kitchen (on which Laurie will thoughtfully consult you ahead of your arrival... nut allergies?  preference for soy, almond, or cow's milk?).  On top of that, my mornings were greeted with fresh-baked goodies from Laurie - delightful scones and amazing muffins!  Also, because I rented a car, Laurie made space in her driveway for me to park; fantastic!

Daisy Mae's is located in a Seattle neighborhood (I believe the Fremont/Ballard area) which was just what I was looking for - nothing tourist-packed.  Not only that, the neighborhoods are really interesting: the houses, the cafes, restaurants, boutiques... just a wonderful place.

Laurie is a wonderful and considerate host (who has the added bonus of being a fantastic baker!). I highly, highly recommend staying at Daisy Mae's B&B for your trip to Seattle."
1256892,12520669,2014-05-04,10286591,Kristopher,"I had a very lovely stay at Daisy Mae's. Laurie is very kind, accommodating, and respects your privacy. She offered the flavor Greek Yogurt I desired and some very delicious scones! Everything was very clean and organized; I highly recommend staying here if you wish to explore Green Lake, Ballard, and/or Fremont. There are several great restaurants, bars, and coffee shops within a few blocks. "
1256892,12794543,2014-05-11,7441000,Carrie,"Overall this is a great option for staying in Seattle and getting a typical Seattle neighborhood experience. Laurie is an excellent host, and is very detailed in catering to specific needs of her guests.   
The apt and bed are very comfortable. The only thing to note is that this is a basement apt and does not get much light.  The yard and neighborhood street is typical of Phinney ridge and beautiful in the spring time. The apt is walking distance to great cafes and restaurants."
1256892,13258841,2014-05-23,1416606,Zac,East to find in a great quiet little neighborhood. Everything was clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again. Really nice back yard to sit out and read if you have some down time. 
1256892,13418367,2014-05-27,14058032,Katherine,"Such great treats for breakfast! Walking distance to lake, shops, restaurants, as well as the bus that can take you to downtown Seattle."
1256892,13919467,2014-06-08,2869409,Tamar Naomi,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Daisy Mae's for five lovely days at the beginning of June. Daisy Mae's is located in a wonderful neighborhood close to tasty restaurants and charming bars. Laurie was a wonderful hostess, always available if need be but provided us privacy etc. The fridge was stocked with snacks and breakfast supplies - even catering to my gluten free requests (really above and beyond). Laurie also provided freshly baked scones and muffins on the weekends! I will most definitely return to Daisy Mae's and have already encouraged my family and friends to do the same. "
1256892,14176049,2014-06-13,548999,Ian,"I had a great experience here, it was a nice little neighborhood that was quiet, yet close to restaurants in the area. She stocked the fridge with food so it really felt like a home! I highly recommend staying here!"
1256892,14262200,2014-06-16,197646,Joanne,"Our host was wonderful.  She provided breakfast each day with fresh fruit and baked goods on the weekend.  The apartment was spotless, quiet and we had no trouble finding a parking spot each evening.  I would definitely highly recommend this B&B to others."
1256892,14742900,2014-06-25,1416379,Carmen,"Daisy Mae's was a top notch experience! My girlfriends and I were in town for the Seattle Rock n' Roll Marathon and Laurie did everything possible to accommodate our needs (including drive us to the start line during the 5 o'clock hour - wow!). The very comfortable basement apartment was clean and stocked with goodies and all kinds of directions and tips were provided. Laurie was very quick with her communications. The basement apartment is located in a great neighborhood - quiet and accessible to restaurants, bars, grocery, etc. it is also very easy to get anywhere using the bus from this apartment. VERY HIGHLY recommended. "
1256892,15399839,2014-07-08,3090787,Shawn,"Daisy Mae's B&B was simply perfect. Excellent location, amenities, and breakfast goodies. We will absolutely stay here next time we visit Seattle! Highly recommended!!"
1256892,15873480,2014-07-17,2212384,LeAnn,"One of the best airbnb's we ever stayed at. Nice apartment with everything you would want including freshly baked scones and blueberry muffins together with fresh fruit. The hosts are terrific and friendly so you feel right at home. We especially enjoyed our breakfasts and dinners in their beautiful backyard. We also enjoyed the huge selection of books in the large bookcase - literature, travel, art, nature and self help. Definitely will stay again on our next trip to Seattle."
1256892,15974740,2014-07-19,17162404,Andrea,"Laurie was a great host.  The space was very clean and inviting.  She checked in with us to make sure we had everything we needed.  Thanks to her preparation, we were not wanting for anything. I would say that the space was actually nicer than pictured.  "
1256892,16206632,2014-07-23,5681465,Molly,"The listing was very much as described.  It was clear that the host put a lot into making the space comfortable and attractive.  The fridge was stocked with snacks and the host even refilled the granola container for us when we had eaten all of it.  The baked goods and fruit on Saturday and Sunday morning were a treat.  It was really nice having the code for the door lock so we didn't have to keep track of keys.  Laurie also gave us advice about taking the ferry and a book about the San Juan islands after we told her we were visiting them.   The beds were really comfortable.  There was a memory foam pad for the sofa bed, which was fantastic.   A bit cramped for four people but met our needs and definitely a great deal for the money.  "
1256892,16407012,2014-07-27,16017156,Patrick,We were welcomed by fantastic granola and well-stocked food.  The place was roomy and cozy. The facilities worked well and had a flow; the host was amazingly helpful and provided great breakfast and hints for local eateries.  The B & B is centrally located and easily allows access to local eateries and to downtown Seattle. All worked so well. 
1256892,16655064,2014-07-31,6475297,Kim,Laurie is a top notch host--felt very comfortable and safe in her neighborhood and inside our apt space. It was quiet and peaceful. The beds were very comfortable and all the extras Laurie provides made our stay the best. Be sure and take some time to sit in her backyard in the early morning and enjoy a cup of coffee or tea that she provides (if the weather permits) and enjoy her well tended garden. You might see a squirrel or a hummingbird scurry by if you are still! Her description is extremely accurate. We walked to dinner nearby and Starbucks each morning. We are already booked again for the fall! Thanks Laurie!
1256892,17097638,2014-08-07,16148135,Brian,"We had everything we could ever want at Daisy Mae's!  Great space, neighborhood, and back yard.  The fruit and pastries on the weekend were delicious.  We would definitely go back!

Thanks! "
1256892,17351393,2014-08-11,16770402,Maikel,"Laurie was a wonderful host. We truly enjoyed our stay. The room was spacious, with a full kitchen, and a delightfully quiet areas. We enjoyed the local restaurants such as the Stumbling Goat, and the pastry items and fruit provided by Laurie were a real treat! "
1256892,17573108,2014-08-14,10331180,Stephanie,"It is obvious that Laurie is serious in making sure that her guest's experience at Daisy Mae's is the best.  This is apparant in her high level of customer service leading up to the day of check in, her responsiveness to any questions and in all the little wonderful details in the space.  This has been one of my best experiences in renting through B&B becuase the space was clean, inviting and exactly as you see in the pictures.  "
1256892,18074267,2014-08-21,5478388,Lauren,"My mom and I spent 3 nights at Daisy Mae's B&B. It was very nice, everything we expected and more. Despite the unusually high temperatures when we stayed, the space stayed cool due to being partially underground. The breakfast food provided meant we didn't have to worry about buying more food or spending bucks on eating breakfast out. The neighborhood was also nice and quiet but close to the zoo and a bus to downtown Seattle. We enjoyed our stay here!"
1256892,18197293,2014-08-23,14036840,Moriah,"We stayed at Laurie's for 2 nights and absolutely loved it. It is so perfectly located on a very quiet street in Ballard, within walking and short driving distance of some awesome coffee shops and bars. The house was cozy and clean and provided us plenty of space as well as reading material, movies and breakfast goodies. Definitely recommend this awesome stay. Thanks again Laurie!"
1256892,19072136,2014-09-06,16690617,Gary,She had everything ready for us when we got there and could just check in at anytime. 
1256892,19598751,2014-09-15,6475297,Kim,Our second stay at Daisy May's b&b! Laurie is an attentive and responsive host and provides amenities above and beyond what are expected. Our place was quiet and comfortable. We will be back often!
1256892,19807503,2014-09-18,7272522,Angela,"Laurie made me feel welcome and went above and beyond with all the little extras with delicious granola (home made) and organic milk. The fridge was packed with snacks and treats I truly felt at home.
The listing description is accurate and Laurie is very honest about Daisy Mae's B & B.
The bed is comfy and the neighbor quiet...you will sleep well.  "
1256892,19942080,2014-09-21,1362370,Atisha,Thank you so much for making our stay so special. We really appreciate the gracious hospitality.
1256892,20461898,2014-09-29,7452760,Beatrice,"A clean and cozy place, with plenty of amenities and delicious snacks. The yogurt, milk, fruit and goldfish Laurie provided made it a super easy stay with a toddler. We enjoyed walking around the neighborhood and exploring restaurants and farmers markets. Laurie also provided memory foam mattresses for both beds - excellent sleep :)

Thank you Laurie!!"
1256892,20751441,2014-10-05,20272421,Jerry,"Laurie is an amazing host. She is responsive, communicative, and accommodating. The listing description was extremely accurate, and Laurie really did go out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed, right down to coconut-free granola for my partner's dietary requirements. The unit was fantastic - clean, comfortable, well-stocked with everything one could reasonably need on a short stay. Although we were just two travelers, you could easily sleep four adults comfortably here. We were  really glad that we chose this listing."
1256892,21462529,2014-10-18,19895983,David,"The host was very pleasant and welcoming. 
The description of the flat was accurate, and it was located in a quiet street close to shops and restaurants.  It was a good place to come back to at the end of the day to sit and relax."
1256892,21702043,2014-10-22,10331180,Stephanie,"This was my second time staying at Daisy Mae's B&B.  Again, Laurie and the space did not disappoint!  The apartment is clean, comfy and had everything I needed (even special treats and water).  I will be back! "
1256892,21794019,2014-10-24,827218,Peggy,"Laurie makes great granola! Everything was just as described. Hope to return soon.
Peggy"
1256892,22624189,2014-11-10,23240671,Nicola,"Breakfast supplies make this a real bnb (including freshly baked goods on the weekend). Pristinely clean self-contained area in the basement.
Easy bus ride to Fremont and into downtown. Peaceful neighbourhood and Laurie was very accommodating.
All in all a great stay in a great city. Thanks again Laurie."
1256892,23862409,2014-12-13,4717479,Robyn,"Laurie has created a very homely atmosphere. The fridge was stocked with all that was needed for breakfast. The kitchen is well equipped for those who want to cook. Bathroom also well-stocked with plenty of towels. As the area is under her house you will hear some movement upstairs, mainly her lovely dog Daisie's paws tapping, which was not a problem for me. Close to buses to city, supermarket nearby, coffee shops with good cappuccinos, restaurants and bars. Very quiet area. Plus yummy scones on Saturday morning. Laurie is very helpful and friendly. On my arrival, as a friend and I waited in the rain for a cab, she kindly drove us to a dinner we were attending. It all contributed to a great stay in Seattle. Thank you, Laurie."
1256892,24084480,2014-12-19,10331180,Stephanie,Thank you for being a wonderful host! 
1256892,24368017,2014-12-27,19895983,David,We went back to Daisy Mae's B&B which says it all.  It is a very comfortable apartment and Laurie is very thoughtful.
1256892,24760449,2015-01-02,19685599,Bryan,"Daisy Mae's was PERFECT!!  Thank you Laurie for the fabulous accommodations, hospitality and welcomeness.  2 blocks away from Greenwood Blvd. which has everything you could need, comfortable and home style environment in an enchanting little neighborhood.  The 'real' Seattle experience.   "
1256892,25139557,2015-01-07,10331180,Stephanie,Thanks again for a wonderful stay! I hope we can meet next time I stay. 
1256892,25379614,2015-01-14,125970,Adam,"Everything was great. Full basement of a house in nice Phinney Ridge neighborhood, walking distance to commercial area. Apartment fully stocked with yogurt, granola, fruit, water, fruit juice, and coffee--a very nice touch. Though we didn't meet, Laurie was accessible and friendly, and we had a great visit!"
1256892,27632783,2015-03-08,1464372,L.,"Laurie makes the guest feel welcome by providing an immaculate space, fresh cut flowers and delicious baked goods in addition to gluten free breakfast options on request.  The neighborhood is quiet and beautiful.  We loved the library, with wonderful and erudite options for all ages.  This is a basement apartment, but we had no issues as I am only 5'3"".  Laurie was very thoughtful preparing the pull out bed for us and flexible with our late arrivals while we attended a wake after a death in the family. The delicious cotton sheets and NASA mattress foam pad made for a lovely replenishing sleep. Daisy Mae is an adorable dog who sometimes accesses the space, but I think she only enters part of the living area.  This is important to keep in mind if you have allergies to dogs."
1256892,27776135,2015-03-11,10331180,Stephanie,"I have stayed at Daisy Mae's many times, and Laurie continues to be one of the best hosts on AirBNB.  Not only is the space clean, it has everything that I need while staying in Seattle.  "
1256892,28143731,2015-03-18,24372533,Doris,"Laurie was an amazing host who delivered freshly baked muffins and scones to us in the morning! She was very considerate and loving. The space itself is very cozy with a lot of board games, books and movies to spend time with during rainy days. The neighborhood is quiet and friendly. I slept very well during my stay here. Also, there are tons of coffee shops and restaurants near by. It was by every aspect a nice stay."

1256892,29797203,2015-04-12,24261174,Joni,"This place is very nice - exactly as described. Very clean, easy to find, easy to access the apartment. Nice neighborhood, beautiful back yard that guests can use. It was a great location for us as we were visiting relatives in both Ballard and University district. We would stay again."
1256892,30418617,2015-04-21,4940783,Jennifer,Great place in a great neighborhood. Easy access. Plenty of room in the apartment and we used the yard a bit too on a sunny day. Very comfortable and generously stocked with foods and extras. 
1256892,30583332,2015-04-24,31362559,Jessica,"Daisy Mae's was a great alternative to the hotels I usually book for work travel. The space is basically a full MIL unit with a kitchen, bathroom, living room, bedroom and dining nook. Laurie stocked the fridge with breakfast goodies, like greek yogurt, fresh berries and my favorite creamer for my morning coffee. The neighborhood is a gorgeous tree-lined typical Seattle hood, with well-maintained homes built in the first quarter of the 1900s. It's close to Aurora/99, so you can get downtown quickly. I plan to come back for my future business trips to Seattle so I can feel more at home! "
1256892,31673935,2015-05-08,29955221,Caroline,"Daisy Mae's was a wonderful place to stay! Our host was courteous, helpful and the place was very cozy. 
Laurie provided us with fresh fruit, yogurt, granola and coffee (among a few other things) which made our stay that much more convenient and relaxing. It is also located in a great neighborhood with lots of walks, shops, restaurants and sites nearby. The views of the Olympic mountains are amazing! 
I would totally recommend this place and would love to stay again if the need arose. "
1256892,32004573,2015-05-12,5741945,Christopher,"Laurie's place was exactly what we were hoping for and made our stay in Seattle easy and relaxing. It's in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance of good food and drinks, and just around the corner from Green Lake which is great for a run or walk. Laurie went out of her way to accommodate us with delicious home made gluten-free muffins, along with other great breakfast options. And the memory foam mattress is super comfortable."
1256892,32615424,2015-05-19,2512683,William,"Wonderful gem of a place if you're considering visiting Seattle area. We stayed at Laurie's B&B for the second half of our trip and really enjoyed our stay.

Main points:

Communications: Laurie was quick to respond to any messages or questions we had prior to and during our stay. 

Location: nice quiet neighborhood, with easy street parking. Area felt very welcoming and had a nice community feel to it. Not exactly walking distance to downtown Seattle but close enough that you can uber, drive, bike or bus into town. 

Place: super clean, spacious, felt very comfortable and had everything you would need from basic toiletries to kitchen-ware to board games. One note: ceiling can be a bit low in some places, so watch your head. And you can hear footsteps above but nothing that made it inconvenient or bothersome for us.

Verdict: we were really blown away by how welcome Laurie made us feel and for being a wonderful host. We would definitely stay again. Thanks Laurie!"
1256892,32929352,2015-05-23,25137004,Russ,"Great location, very well kept space and very comfortable."
1256892,33138766,2015-05-25,5149551,Janice,"Laurie is an excellent host.  The accommodation was spotless, had comfortable beds with wonderful cotton linens, well equipped kitchen, and a great library.  Laurie was very prompt in all her communications with us and seems to have thought of everything a guest could want.   Wonderful breakfast food including the fresh scones and tarts!  We also enjoyed the eclectic library.   Thanks very much!"
1256892,34314546,2015-06-07,32560807,Peter,"Laurie's place is very comfortable and we enjoyed our stay. She was in contact with us throughout, exceptionally helpful, and generally a fantastic host.

The surrounding neighbourhood is pleasant, safe, and has a great selection of pubs, shops, restaurants, and Green Lake within walking distance. A convenient bus route goes from a 2 minute walk away right into the centre of downtown. 

Overall, highly recommended!"
1256892,34728298,2015-06-11,13460803,Kyaw,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Laurie's beautiful apartment for 3 nights in June. It was spotless clean and had everything we needed plus some lovely extras such as fruit and muffins that Laurie kindly baked. When we texted to say we couldn't find the washing up liquid, we came home to find not only a new bottle but Laurie had even done the washing up for us! She was also helpful with tips for places to eat in the neighbourhood. Thank you!!! "
1256892,34954581,2015-06-14,31172966,Justin,"Our family loved our stay here this summer, and Laurie was such an amazing and gracious host. Being completely new to Seattle, she not only stocked the fridge with plenty of food but also provided guidance on local transit and things to do. Clean, comfortable and quiet unit for the weekend. Nice neighborhood not far from downtown. Thank you!"
1256892,35392136,2015-06-18,15149611,Monika,"Laurie was great host..she was available all the time on phone/message. The house was nicely done and very well kept. If you are travelling alone, there is  great collection of books, games and DVDs to keep you busy. The house has all the utilities that you would need for a short duration trip. On top of that Laurie had also stuffed the refrigerator with breakfast ingredients and some of the seasonal fruits. Thanks Laurie..we had a great time!! :)"
1256892,37552686,2015-07-08,29993189,Pauline,There was a good informative welcoming notice and file inside providing excellent wifi information. Good bus guides. Excellent provisions in the fridge when we arrived. It was in a good area only 5 minutes from buses on Phinney Ridge and very near our relatives. Good garden area to sit in although compact. Breakfast was provided and when we sat in the garden one afternoon we were treated to little home made fruit pies.  There were 3 of us staying and the sofa bed was large for one person. A little short on hanging space when using the sofa bed. We stayed for 12 days and towels were changed when needed. As we were out for most of the time we didn't use the TV or the cooker but the coffee machine was very good. We felt it was our own space and was welcoming and organised. The area was very quiet.
1256892,38894562,2015-07-19,16569164,Emily,"Laurie was a superb, ultra professional host!  And her home is perfectly located.  It represents great value and is one of few rentals available in that wonderful corner of Seattle.

I would particularly recommend this property for those who are sound sleepers and generally not disturbed by noise.  For me, though, the match was not a perfect one.  I was surprised that when I checked in, Laurie had left a rental agreement to sign with a clause to the effect of ""Renter acknowledges that this is a basement unit in an inhabited house and hence that footsteps and other household noise are audible.""  Of course, I went ahead and signed because there was no other choice at that point-- I'd already arrived and checked in.  However, the noise mentioned was, as the rental agreement noted, very typical for an older home but also very present.  I could hear continuous footsteps during waking hours, full conversations, even the sound of someone mixing ingredients in a bowl in the kitchen.  For me, the very audible presence of the host (who I do not fault at all) just living her life distracted from my stay.  

My only suggestion for Laurie would be to more clearly highlight this clause from the rental agreement on the Airbnb listing, so that potential renters can make the decision to come stay ""eyes wide open"".  For someone who is used to sharing a living space with others and/or not troubled by normal household noises, then this property is a wonderful place to stay, and I highly recommend it!

Special thanks to Laurie for: 1) the timely communication throughout the booking process and stay, 2) being so impressively organized, and 3) the small touches like fresh cherries in the fridge and baked goods offered.

For the right guests, this property is a gem that represents great value, an enviable location, and an ultra professional host!

Thanks Laurie!"
1256892,39608852,2015-07-25,31472121,Lori,"Laurie was an excellent host.  She was friendly and communication was easy.  She went out of her way to make our stay enjoyable (e.g., inquiring about food preferences).  We thoroughly enjoyed Daisy Mae's which felt like a home away from home.  The apartment was well stocked with food, maps, books, videos, linens etc.  We really appreciated the extras like a local coupon book and list of restaurants in the area.  The neighborhood is quiet and parking was easy.  We were able to walk to many restaurants and shops and were close to many other great neighborhoods of Seattle.  We would love to stay here again!"
1256892,39958452,2015-07-27,36114084,Elizabeth,"Laurie had everything ready for us upon check in, all instructions, a wonderful binder (with area info, restaurants, etc), and chocolates (which was such a nice touch).  The neighborhood was beautiful and extremely safe - we actually went out and explored shortly after arriving.  The place was extremely clean and welcoming.  The blueberry muffins Laurie brought down on Sun morning were delicious as well.  We will stay again next time in Seattle."
1256892,40207438,2015-07-29,5849082,Josiah,Great location. Host very hospitable; she went above and beyond to accommodate me and my family. Rental comfortable. I would highly recommend.
1256892,40649352,2015-08-01,38414644,Bre,"Staying with Laurie was a pleasure. Upon arrival the fridge was stocked with breakfast goods, instructions for use of everything, and she thought of everything like soap and a blow dryer etc. The location is awesome and Laurie left a list of all the places to eat in the area. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it. "
1256892,41131114,2015-08-04,10344182,Katie,"Loved our stay in Phinney Ridge at Daisy Mae's. Everything was as described in the listing. Laurie provided a large library of literature (coupons, maps, local magazines) and was extremely helpful in helping us arrange for the storage of our luggage. She has a lovely home and our stay was exceptional. We especially appreciated the breakfast and snack food she provided - great for our day excursion to Mt. Ranier! "

1256892,42324696,2015-08-12,37445312,Kyle,"We'll be back! A perfect location to go anywhere in Seattle and a wonderful neighborhood to ""come home"" and relax.  There were four of us during our stay and the space was more than comfortable.  Clean, not just ~hotel room clean~ but really clean...  with many thoughtful touches to enhance our stay in Seattle that were much more than we expected. Laurie is not only friendly and welcoming but efficient, professional and SUPER fast in all her communications. Parking was never a problem with easy access to well, everywhere!  
"
1256892,44421389,2015-08-26,12937084,Mary,"Laurie contacted me about a week before our stay to ask how she could customize the breakfast items she left for us.  The yogurt, granola, and fruit were delicious.  And the surprise dessert were a special treat.  Thanks Laurie!  

We found the space clean, well equipped, comfortable, and very convenient, especially if you like the Phinney Ridge area as we do.  We come to Seattle often to visit family and will definitely try to book this place again."
1256892,45101380,2015-08-31,8298076,Sergii,"Thank you so much for such enjoyable stay, you really made this weekend very pleasant for us. Everything was great, the place is awesome neat, organized and your hospitality is just great!  Thanks for all extras and as for me we will miss your bakery, because no one will treat me like that when I'm home :)

Best wishes.

1256892,46123714,2015-09-08,34506922,Beth,"My daughter, boyfriend and I had a wonderful stay at Laurie's basement apartment when we were in town for a family wedding and Bumbershoot. Laurie had excellent communication with me before and during our stay. She answered my questions about charges, helped me change my booking to add an extra day and made sure that we had breakfast options and beverages on hand. Her home baked goodies were a real treat!  I only got to meet her directly once, as she was delivering muffins, but I knew she was on hand if we needed anything.  We felt very safe staying here."
1256892,47263294,2015-09-17,40034253,Ana Carolina,"This was my first airbnb experience and could not be better. The place is great. Laurie made a great job on the apartment. We can see that she is concerned about every single detail to make us fell conformable. She provided great yogurts and other foods. I would like to highlight the breakfast during the weekend, it is delicious! The apartment is extremely clean with a great smell! The neighborhood is calm and with great market and small stores around. You will find everything you need. I definitely recommend! and will also recommend to friends and who will visit Seattle.  "
1256892,47742307,2015-09-21,5055184,Maria,"We had a lovely 4 day weekend at Laurie's place.  The house was immaculate, and very comfortable.  We loved walking around the Phinney Ridge neighborhood, and had some really good meals in the local restaurants and cafes.  The flat is very private, and Laurie provides a very healthy breakfast.  She and her husband were also very helpful and accommodating.  A place to recommend!

1256892,49739036,2015-10-05,3884446,Kate,"I had a lovely stay at Daisy Mae's while visiting my sister in Seattle. Laurie was able to accommodate me on pretty short notice and everything was so nicely organized for my arrival. Delicious baked goods were delivered on the weekend mornings that I was there and the fridge was stocked with yogurt, juice, and fruit. I would definitely recommend staying here especially if you want all the comforts of a home away from home. "
1256892,53361038,2015-11-08,19405878,Olivia,"I LOVE Laurie's place!! It is clean, cozy, quite, and comfortable. Her scones and muffins were so tasty with a cup of coffee in a cold morning. This was my second stay in Laurie's place :) I will definitely stay here again, when I am in town. Thanks again, Laurie!!!!"
8613792,49941983,2015-10-07,45315902,Matt,"My host was very welcoming when I arrived despite my arriving quite late (my flight was delayed significantly).  The description of the location was accurate and the facilities very nice.  The neighborhood was very safe and nice, I arrived and departed during darkness and felt very comfortable.  My host also made coffee in the morning."
4449303,27816309,2015-03-12,578490,Jake,"Steven was an excellent host. He shared all information I needed early and offered his help and advice if I needed anything else. His house, the bedroom, and bathroom were all clean and comfortable. Great place, would be happy to stay there again."
4449303,28196871,2015-03-19,2186252,Ellen,"The listing is very accurate.  The room and bathroom are right near the entrance to the house that you see in the photos, and have a lot of privacy from the rest of the house.  The room is small but very nice, with a huge closet.  The house is extremely clean!  The dog is beautiful and so sweet.  Steven was very prompt at responding to all communication and was very flexible on check in and check out.  The neighbourhood is a very safe and nice area, not far to walk to restaurants, pubs, and grocery stores.  Several bus routes are within short walking distance too.  "
4449303,29146553,2015-04-04,29646332,Keith,"Very nice place, great neighborhood. Wish I had had more time to spend here. Very modern place. Steven was accommodating and understanding of my constantly changing schedule and even made time for me after my stay when I had forgotten something. Great host, great place, cute dog too!"
4449303,29792443,2015-04-12,28883377,Ken,This house is in a great location and Steven is an excellent host.  The place is very clean and has all you could need. Steven went out of his way to ensure I had what I needed; he vent supplied a iron and ironing board. He has a great dog that is very friendly; and not a bother at all. I highly recommend Steven and this listing. 
4449303,30174414,2015-04-18,25868878,Christine,"My husband and I had a most enjoyable stay. Everything was ready for us when we arrived in this lovely neighborhood. Steven was a truly gracious host and sharing his home was perfect for us. I was having a surgery done at Swedish and this provided a close in respite for us. The neighborhood park was just what our dog needed too. We would stay with 
Steven again when we need to be in the city.
Thank you Steven, it was perfect!
Christine & David"
4449303,30317405,2015-04-20,28458195,Karen,"Great location in Ballard. Nice, very clean bedroom and bathroom. I wasn't around much, but Steven was very helpful."
4449303,30835108,2015-04-27,26827388,Don,"Steven was very  welcoming and available to while honoring personal privacy. The space was better than advertised, clean, comfortable, had unexpected extras (large flat screen TV, full pot of coffee in the am), and in a great location for visiting SPU. 
I'll be back!
Thanks!"
4449303,32692714,2015-05-20,2680894,Nicole,"Steven made sure the space was clean and welcoming, and had some extra coffee on every morning. I loved the great internet/tv access and the house is really beautiful with great facilities. Plus, dog cuddles! 

The house was not far from services/grocery etc, and an easy walking distance to a number of bus routes which was helpful for me as I wasn't driving while in town. 

I appreciated the privacy of having the bedroom and bathroom on their own level too. I tend to keep to myself when I travel to rest up so it was nice.

Flexible check-in times were really helpful too, with a late flight arrival on my first day. "
4449303,33255581,2015-05-26,6545739,Drystan,Steven was a great host. My partner and I stayed with him for 3 nights. The bed was extremely comfortable and Steven made everything very clear and was great about communicating. Thanks for a fantastic stay. Loved your house!
4449303,33713373,2015-05-31,14592153,T.J.,"Steven's home is every bit as hospitable and inviting as his listing suggests.  The first floor bedroom is very comfortable, the private bathroom is very convenient, and the common areas are a great perk for moments when you need to just relax for a bit.  The location is a short walk from a bunch of great micro-breweries, and it's not much farther to get to the hip spots in Ballard.  We walked almost everywhere, which was perfect.  

Steven is a very accommodating host.  Everything worked perfectly, down to the personalized key code to enter the house.  He even made us coffee in the morning!  As far as shared living situations go, Steven was the perfect blend of hand-on when he needed to be, and hands-off when he wasn't needed.

I would highly recommend this location.  Go for it!"

4449303,34332570,2015-06-07,9425232,Katie,"The bedroom was cozy, and being on the first floor was quiet and private. Steven was easily accessible when we had questions. Tug is a sweet, sweet pup. Great place to stay if you enjoy the Ballard neighborhood. "
4449303,34642677,2015-06-10,10769222,Scott,"Highly recommended.  Steven was a great host & made everything super easy.  The listing is accurate & he keeps the place very clean.  His dog, Tug, is also awesome.

The neighborhood is close to downtown, to public transportation & quiet."
4449303,35414536,2015-06-18,18995371,Jay,Steven was very accommodating and we enjoyed staying with him. He has a lovely dog that I enjoyed playing with as well. 
4449303,35528669,2015-06-19,11278939,Elisabeth,"Steven was really accommodating during my stay. It was a last minute request and he was able to go out of his way to fit me in so I had a place to stay for the night! It was nice to have a whole floor to myself...my stay felt so luxurious! The bedroom and bathroom were really nice and the TV was huge!! I was able to relax in bed watching modern family on HuluPlus :) the bed was super comfortable as well. Steven was an amazing host...chill, relatable, and friendly. I would definitely stay here again! "
4449303,36324369,2015-06-27,35880140,Tuukka,"Steven oli loistava isäntä. Asunto oli todella siisti ja sänky oli erittäin mukava. Asunnon sijainti oli kätevä sillä sieltä oli helppo kävellä mm. Ballardin ja Freemontin alueille, kuin myös bussipysäkeille. Über -kyyti Downtowniin maksoi n. 12$

Steven loi meille oman ovikoodin ja wifin ja antoi hyviä neuvoja siitä, mitä kannattaa tehdä. Huippumesta!"
4449303,36830879,2015-07-01,36582015,Brian,Great place and model of hospitality.  Perfect location for restaurants and bars in Ballard.

4449303,37518301,2015-07-07,10134755,Kelly,"Steven has a great pad in a wonderful part of Seattle, convenient to almost everything it felt.

You'll also have delicious coffee and fresh eggs from his hens! Tug, his dog, is friendly and very cute, but if you're not a dog person he's very quiet and shouldn't bother you. The townhome is about a 15 min walk to downtown Ballard or Freemont, but you'll need to drive/Uber to most other places. "
4449303,38695617,2015-07-18,29114469,Kira,"Steven has a very nice and modern house in a lovely neighbourhood in Seattle. He helped a lot when we had questions or wanted to know things. The room and bathroom is like on the pictures: very comfortable and modern! From Stevens house, you could very easy come into town with public transportation.  So all in all, we would definitely recommend to stay in Stevens house!"
4449303,39012759,2015-07-20,16759450,Amy,"I loved my stay at Steven's great house in Ballard! It was great to be in a real neighborhood with character instead of in a boring hotel. Space was clean and pleasant, and parking was plentiful. Plus, there were tons of great breweries, food carts and restaurants a short walk away. Steven made it really easy to access the space and made us feel very welcome. Will definitely try to book this place again on my next visit to Seattle."

4449303,39536628,2015-07-24,6688306,Toni,"Good stay at Steven's house. The home was comfortable, and it was great to be able to lounge in the upstairs living room and make use of the nice kitchen.  We enjoyed walking around and exploring Ballard. Everything was close by. Parking was easy. Steven was working most of the time, but was very responsive via texting and e-mail. would recommend tony friends."
4449303,40462459,2015-07-31,36001614,Brooke,"Staying at Steven's Modern Townhouse with my very own private floor was a truly top notch Air BnB experience. He had everything customized just for my stay - from the wifi with my own name on it, to the custom four digit lock code that was the last four digits of my personal cell number, Steven went to great lengths to ensure that my stay was as comfortable and easy as possible. It was the first air BnB i stayed at that wasn't completely detached from the hosts main living spaces, but Steven was super gracious and gave me the space when I needed it, but was more than happy to let me sit down and watch ESPN with him over a glass of wine. And his awesome dog, Tug was a pleasant surprise too. If you're looking for a place with hotel-like service, then this is definitely the one you're looking for!"
4449303,40795938,2015-08-02,29410495,Mary,"Great location!!. Very hospitable hosts. Very friendly greater (dog). 
Would stay there again anytime! "
4449303,41257316,2015-08-05,38776906,Bruce,"Steven's townhouse was just as it looked: newish and very comfortable and clean. The bathroom was nice too and completely private.  Getting in and out was easy via a coded lock - no key needed.  The neighborhood is very quiet, and everything you might need is within walking distance: breakfast, lunch, and dinner restaurants, and many microbrew pubs. I took the bus line to downtown for $3.00.  Steven was a nice host - he provides lots of recommendations on where to eat locally, and what to see - as was his dog Tug, who I took for a walk. This was a great way to get to know a part of Seattle that I never would have visited. "
4449303,41636105,2015-08-08,37365701,Matt,Staying at Steven's place was amazing. The house is super clean and beautiful! Steven went out of his was to be accommodating and provide suggestions as to what to see and places to eat and drink. Plus Tug(the dog) is a blast! Super cute with a lot of energy.

4449303,42625165,2015-08-14,1988707,Andrew,Though we only visited one night Stevens house is a great place to explore Seattle from. A bus stop that will take you downtown is only a few blocks away. We followed his recommendation and had breakfast  at The Dish. A delicious and cozy little place.  An overall great experience.
4449303,43468587,2015-08-19,14253774,Peter,"Great place! Location was easy to get to, and still close to downtown. Parking was no problem, and the house was nice and clean. The bed was also super-comfortable."

4449303,44693479,2015-08-28,40812035,Erica,"This was my first experience with airbnb and i'm happy to say it went great. Steven was very welcoming and his dog Tug was awesome. The apartment was on a pretty quiet street in Ballard but close enough to everything. My bedroom and bathroom were both cozy and clean! I would definitely stay here again. Steven makes it very easy on setting up codes and passwords for coming in and out ,internet, and cable. Wish i could have stayed longer! "
4449303,45462656,2015-09-03,17737644,Deborah,"
My stay at Steven's house was very nice and quite comfortable.  My cozy bedroom was just the right size for me and had a sizable closet for all my stuff; plenty of room altogether.  My private bathroom down the hall was spectacular.  The neighborhood was delightful and friendly.  I rode my bike through it feeling quite safe. "
4449303,46928975,2015-09-14,10509212,Eliot,The perfect spot for us to visit relatives in Seattle for a few days. Steven was gracious and helpful. Thanks for the excellent stay!
4449303,47419486,2015-09-18,24191533,David,"The place is very nice and clean with 2 great breweries within 2 blocks of his house!  The room is on the smaller side but was very clean and had a big TV mounted on the wall so you can easily hang out on your own if you want.  Steve is a really nice guy and although we didn't see much of each other he was pretty easy going and even made coffee the first morning I was there!

Would definitely go back."
4449303,48295429,2015-09-25,4358671,Ruda,I like the fully automated checkin/checkout process which made ti very easy to arrive at any time.  Steven's house is very well appointed and just as described.  I found it perfect for my visit to Seattle.

4449303,50983980,2015-10-16,46189019,Liz,Steven was a great host and made our stay super easy. Easy instructions on how to come and go from the condo and the downstairs unit was very private so it felt like having an apartment to ourselves. The Ballard area was perfect for great restaurants and exploring the city both on foot and an easy drive to popular sites downtown. 
4449303,51816372,2015-10-24,39046730,Kathleen,"Steven's Airbnb was a restful retreat--enjoyed the downstairs suite and small garden area. I also used the kitchen on the main floor to heat water for tea and eat meals in a clean and contemporary space. Steven is a gracious, responsive and accommodating host!"
4449303,53943692,2015-11-14,21462192,Kathleen,"Steve was very welcoming and even ran  home in the middle of his work day to be certain the space was in good order.  He also responded quickly to all of our inquiries.

The neighborhood was safe and quiet and within walking distance to the Ballard business district where we discovered several wonderful restaurants.  On a chilly, rainy Seattle afternoon we found refuge at the Majestic Movie Theater and enjoyed the BIG screen experience!

4449303,55700571,2015-12-04,2479597,Jerry,"Steven's place im Seattle's hip Ballard neighborhood was ideal! His dog, ""Tug"", is very cute & welcoming as well.... Walking distance to several great micro brewery's - One of the most relaxing airbnb experiences i've had... You really have your own entire floor to yourself, with access to the other floors if needed-- I'd stay here again in a heartbeat!"
4449303,55870941,2015-12-06,20116571,Nancy,"Easy to find. Quiet and comfortable. Did not meet Steven, but he was responsive and easy to work with prior to my stay. Thanks for providing recommendations for places to eat - I really enjoyed trying a new place for breakfast (loved the food, service and setting of the Dish)."
4449303,56082517,2015-12-08,7190320,Yachiyo,"We had a great time! Nice and clean, exactly as it was listed, and the pup Tug made for a great new friend! Steven was even kind enough to get the coffee brewing for us late-ish sleepers. The house is close to a lot of local breweries and stylish restaurants, ensuring that neither the foodie nor the beer-lover will go wanting if they stay here. Highly recommend this place and its awesome host!"
4449303,56286314,2015-12-11,2479597,Jerry,"A hidden jewel of an airbnb located in the pleasant Ballard neighborhood of Seattle, Steven's place is quite charming & relaxing. This was the 2nd time in 2 weeks that i stayed here and, as with the 1st time , i give it 5 stars~ "
4449303,57242583,2015-12-23,47466955,Wendy,"This was my first airbnb experience.  I was a little nervous about being a stranger in someone else's house but Steven made the experience comfortable and easy.  I was out and about most the time so only interacted with Steven once but he was very welcoming and his dog Tug gives excellent hugs.  The neighborhood is great.  I rented a car and found that I was an easy 10-15 min away from everything I wanted to see.  I did a lot of yoga around Ballard, Fremont and Queen Anne.  All the studios were excellent.  Coffee shops in all those neighborhoods are cozy and tasty as well.  It was great having a comfortable place to come home to each night.  Not having to bother with a key was excellent!    "
8273948,47311331,2015-09-17,1949223,Erik & Mishi,"the separate apt. and the location were great. The apt. was very private, clean, bright,  comfortable, well equipped with all the cooking needs . Very nicely furnished, and great space size. We  had a great stay and highly recommend this very nice apt."
8273948,48042120,2015-09-22,7681928,Maie,"Ania's apartment in Leschi is located in a beautiful neighborhood and is filled with natural light.  The efficient space is as pictured and the bed is comfortable.  Unfortunately, we did not get to meet Ania but rules and neighborhood info was noted on a long list."
8273948,48438515,2015-09-26,12339195,Lisa,"Ania was a very nice host!

The area this Airbnb is located in is very charming and beautiful! If you like to go for a run, there is a lake 1 mile south, and if you keep on going there's a nice park too! A lot of mini shops near by, walking distance.

The space itself is very spacious! It's a basement setting, but definitely doesn't feel like one at all! 

While my time here I was working so I can't say much about touristy stuff, but definitely a well kept and beautiful neighborhood. 

If I ever needed anything Ania was one text away. Very kind.

I would def recommend this place to others!

Excellent!"
8273948,49822046,2015-10-06,44352316,Susan,Ania made us feel welcome before we arrived with helpful messages. The suite was as described but even more spacious and fresh! The location was perfect for us and parking on the street was easy. The suite wasw well equipped and very clean.
8273948,50519125,2015-10-12,3851497,Dave,"I thoroughly enjoyed my 3 night stay!  Ania made her home very welcoming and the logistics of getting in and out were very smooth.  The apartment is lovely, very private, fully equipped, great location and beautiful walking neighborhood.  I am sure I will be staying again!"

8273948,52139183,2015-10-26,46346481,David,"Beautiful neighborhood that is actually pretty close to downtown.  We had access to everything we wanted to do.  The house itself was very secluded and private, and everything provided was great.  Would absolutely book it again next time I'm in Seattle."
8273948,53012999,2015-11-03,2316057,Jen,Very accommodating and private place. Close to the lake and I'm a lovely winding neighborhood
8273948,53539974,2015-11-09,47654801,Kyne,"The apartment was exactly like it was pictured and the word secluded is very apt in describing it. Quiet neighborhood with decent parking. If you need a good place to stay to be around Seattle-Proper area, you can't beat this. You're staying below a family so be mindful, of that (upstairs noise travels downwards). "
8273948,54159258,2015-11-16,8106907,Stacy,"Very nice neighborhood, description and pictures of the unit were very accurate and was great for my needs- a place to crash while in the city for the weekend. Overall, a nice space. "

1198884,4974164,2013-06-04,4206210,Jean,Sanjaya place was perfect for my first trip to Seattle. It was in a great location so I walked everywhere. It's a short 15 minute walk to PIkes and also close by all the cool shops bars and restaurants in Capital Hill. I would definitely recommend it to everyone. 
1198884,5065438,2013-06-10,4430971,Andy,"The apartment is in a great location, only a few minutes walk to the centre of the city. The apartment is fully equipped with a well stocked kitchen and a great media setup. Sanjaya is a great host, he answered our questions  and dealt with all our queries quickly and efficiently. We highly recommend this apartment."
1198884,5119158,2013-06-13,6570648,Kelly,Sanjaya's condo is absolutely lovely and is in the PERFECT location for anyone attending a conference at the convention center. Sanjaya was also incredibly kind to provide assistance with  finding parking. I would highly recommend staying at his place and will gladly stay there again the next time I visit Seattle.
1198884,5167325,2013-06-16,6570648,Kelly,Wonderful condo and amazing hospitality! Sanjaya is a great host !
1198884,5326760,2013-06-24,1831563,Kristen,"Sanjay's apartment was perfect for our weekend stay in Seattle! His instructions to get in the apartment were sent well in advance and very detailed. The apartment was immaculate and he even had a few cold brews in the fridge when we arrived (which we greatly appreciated after a long day of travels). We also loved the location (close to downtown/Pike's place) and also close to Capital Hill (cute restaurants, shopping). Thanks for the stay! "
1198884,5725178,2013-07-13,3485883,Michael,"Sanjaya was great. His apartment was neat, clean and a VERY convenient walk to the CBD, Convention Centre and Capitol Hill. Perfect for one or two people. I would definitely recommend staying here if you want Seattle charm and accessibility to the city. "
1198884,5813588,2013-07-17,7121305,Misty,"The apartment was super convenient and in walkable distance to all the tourist attractions. It looks just as advertised and although I didn't get to meet Sanjaya, he was very responsive and helpful when setting up the reservation as well as upon arrival. I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone coming in for a short stay in Seattle. "
1198884,5948088,2013-07-23,7114792,Ramon,"This was our first time using AirBnB and we were a little nervous about what we would find.
We were very happy about Sanjaya's place. Very well located, a homy feel, and very quiet area. Lovely restaurants nearby, a 10min walk from Pike Market. 
Would stay again if I return to Seattle."
1198884,6248646,2013-08-05,7149525,Phillip,Excellent location just blocks from everything! Nice apartment. Really enjoyed our stay here and Sanjaya arranged everything so that when we arrived everything went smoothly. Street parking is only 2 hours but if you are lucky you can find a spot where you can park overnight for free. Luckily we found a spot where we could leave the car for our entire stay and just walk everywhere. There also seems to be a lot of places where you pay to park but I'm not sure how much they cost. Other than that we had a great time at Sanjayas place and would definitely stay there again. Sanjaya was very helpful and checked up to see of everything went according to plan. Thanks Sanjaya!
1198884,7396576,2013-09-18,8065202,Dave,Good location with access to market and pike street restaurants being very close. New paint and a professional cleaning of entire unit including appliances is necessary. Sanjaya was very helpful and parking pass he provided was huge plus. I would stay again after paint and cleaning are complete. 
1198884,7519716,2013-09-23,8073720,Mercedes,"Sanjaya place was an excellent location, waking distance to any tourist and shopping places and a safe area to stay! Bed very comfortable.
His coffe machine and coffe was excellent!
His response to any request was very quick.
"
1198884,7611239,2013-09-26,8524417,Mac,We are Airbnb 'newbies' and loved Sanjaya's apartment.  The location was great - we had 3 outstanding meals right within a few blocks of his place.  There is also a late night convenience store nearby which was very useful.  He was flexible and responsive and a pleasure to deal with.  We would return to his comfortable place.
1198884,7746568,2013-10-01,8284484,Amanda,"We had a great time staying at Sanjaya's place. The location on First Hill couldn't be beat for convenience; it is the perfect halfway point between downtown and Capitol Hill, making it an easy walk to both these areas. There were four of is in our party, so it was a wee bit cramped, but still a great location with all the amenities. To top it off, Sanjaya was a super responsive and accommodating host; he got back to me right away whenever I had a question, and even dropped off an extra blanket during our stay. I'd stay here again. Thanks Sanjaya!"
1198884,7801005,2013-10-03,8597825,Josh,"The check-in process was super smooth, place was clean, great TV, comfortable couches and bed. Oh, and it's suuuuuper close to downtown. He gave us an extra key and parking pass, without us even having to ask. This is the best Air BnB place I've stayed at so far!"
1198884,8027949,2013-10-13,9067015,Herbert,"What a great location in this wonderful city! I had a great time and enjoyed watching the vacuum-cleaner-robot. I loved the super-comfortable bed, which helped adjusting to the time-zone quickly."
1198884,8197118,2013-10-20,3722490,Gerald,"My stay was short and for business. 3 nights only. Did not use kitchen nor TV / lounge.

PROS:
-location,
-good bed,
- no carpet.
- quiet.

CONS:
-old appart,
- bathroom/shower not great - old
- no storage for hanging clothes.
- did not feel thoroughly cleaned before I got there.

All in all, I believe it should be cheaper to be good value."
1198884,8414858,2013-10-29,9337617,Melanie,"Sanjaya was a good host, he was very quick to respond to all of my questions by text messaging. The apartment was nice and clean. The location is very convenient for the convention center because its literally a 3 mins walk. Overall, very good experience and would recommend the apartment to anyone! Thanks again! "
1198884,8589330,2013-11-06,418391,Zach,"Sanjaya's place has several great things going for it. The location is excellent. It is within walking distance of many great markets, venues and restaurants. The apartment is cozy and has the added amenities of a washer/dryer and a dishwasher if you have an extended stay. I would absolutely stay here again."
1198884,8824588,2013-11-19,9858696,Evan,Sanjaya is very nice and has a perfectly located apartment in walking distance to downtown and Capitol Hill.  The place was very clean and fully stocked with all of your needs.  We accidentally locked ourselves out (totally our fault) and Sanjaya was very quick to help us out of our jam!  A very accessible host indeed.  Thanks again for the great stay!
1198884,8879515,2013-11-23,10100687,Nick,"Perfect location if you are attending a conference at the Washington Convention Center. It is literally a 5 minute walk door to door. It is also within walking distance to coffee, restaurants, and the downtown Whole Foods. Highly recommend if you need a place to stay in downtown Seattle. Sanjaya was very prompt with communication and made it a seamless process to rent his place for the week. I would definitely stay here again next time I travel to Seattle for work."
1198884,9173162,2013-12-10,2078086,Jimena,"Sanjaya's apartment is a great option for staying in Seattle! Very reasonable price in a great location. Even though you are right next to downtown and within walking distance from most tourist attractions in Seattle, you don't feel like you are right next to downtown. The apartment building is behind the Convention Center, which makes it an extremely convenient location if you are in town for a conference, but also means that you don't get all the noise and  buzz from downtown, and the neighborhood feels like an actual neighborhood. The apartment is equipped with everything you might need and more. The coffee table in the living room was waiting for us covered with Seattle maps, magazines, and brochures that helped us planed our itineraries. Sanjaya is a very responsive and accommodating host. All of our exchanges went very smoothly. He even gave us a parking pass so we could park for free in a restricted parking zone. Would definitely stay in Sajaya's apartment again!"
1198884,12578050,2014-05-05,3028795,Jesse,"Sunjaya and Rick were very responsive and got back to us very quickly with each question or concern we had. The apartment is in a secure building and could not be more convenient to the convention center, good restaurants and shops. We enjoyed walking down to Pike Place and the waterfront. Once we found a parking place we were happy to leave our car parked and just walk to everything since it was all so close by! Thank you Sunjaya!"
1198884,13699639,2014-06-02,5733020,Brett,Great location and clean apartment.  Would definitely rent this again when in town.  
1198884,13879543,2014-06-07,14473179,Yida,Everything is great
1198884,16844047,2014-08-03,12318642,Juan,"We had a great experience here.  The condo is close to everything.  We walked almost everywhere during our stay.  And when we didn't, Ubers were in the $5-$7 range.  Nothing was more than a 30 minute walk, with most being 15.

The space is very nice.  There is a full kitchen if you need to cook, an HDTV with cable and Netflix and a comfy bed.

Sanjaya also provided us with a neighborhood visitor parking decal to park our rental car.  We were able to find parking about 5 minutes from the condo.  This was really helpful as parking in Seattle is not easy to find.  Although, had I known just how walkable everything was to the condo, I would have just turned the car in early and saved on the rental."
1198884,17436101,2014-08-12,15382644,Philippe,"Even if we did'nt get the chance to meet Sanjaya in person, he prepared everything in advance so we will feel very comfortable in his appartment. We found the place easily and had access to the building and appartment without any difficulties. Sanjaya even let us a parking pass, which was very helpful, thanks a lot!. Everything is absolutely as described (the washer/dryer was also very appreciated).
The appartment is great and the location perfect for who want to discover easily the city (very short distance by walk to dowtown or Capitol Hill). We would recommend staying here."
1198884,17617689,2014-08-15,15982576,Amanda,The apartment was in a good location and came with parking whih was very convenient. We really enjoyed our stay in the apartment. 
1198884,18129272,2014-08-22,17285143,Yael,"Sanjaya's apartment is super. It seems that the entire building is under a single management, which is fine.
GREAT location - took us 20 min. by foot to get to the waterfront and the market. It takes even less to all the commercial and shopping centres.
The beds (and also the living room sofa) are really comfortable. All the appliances in the apt. are new and functioning - we took the liberty of doing some washing in the machine and drier.
Take notice, if you come from a quiet area, such as a suburb or something more rural, the street runs very close to the freeway and a main street, so there are ""street noises"" at night. We didn't mind it much, since we have the same noise at home.
We strongly recommend the apartment."
1198884,18400784,2014-08-26,4022437,Dan,"I really enjoyed staying in Sanjaya's Condo. As mentioned it is very close to the convention center and it was very easy for me to walk to my conference every morning.  The condo felt very safe and was relatively quiet. It also has all the essentials - a nice kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. 

Sanjaya was also very easy to work with. He always responded very quickly to my questions and requests.  I highly recommend this place, especially to anyone using the convention center. "
1198884,18657388,2014-08-30,17547747,Travis,"Very accurate description of the condo. I loved the location! We were able to walk to almost everything we did and for the things that were too far, it was usually s condo again!"
1198884,18780919,2014-09-01,3631211,Jon,"Our experience with both the host and accommodations was superb and - with this being our first actual airbnb adventure, we are more than pleased! Thanks Sanjaya for answering all our questions and in a timely manner. We hope to stay again!  "
1198884,19117157,2014-09-07,13901594,Elena,"El apartamento es perfecto para poder disfrutar de seattle. Muy limpio, con todas las facilidades y a 10 minutos andando del centro, a un precio razonable. Además si vas en coche te deja una tarjeta para poder aparcar en la zona."
1198884,19361765,2014-09-11,17403652,Ulrike,"The perfect place to explore Seattle. 
We had 3 perfect days in Seattle in a very nice and clean appartement .
When we arrived everything was prepared and we just had to move in and feel comfortable. All you need is just a walk away an to Pikes Market it was just a 10min walk. So we did'nt had to use the car once. We wish we could have stay longer. "
1198884,19642056,2014-09-15,887616,Hidaya,"Sanjaya is a great host. Very helpful, very welcoming.
The apartment is convenient and very close to fantastic restaurants.
(Check out the ""Melrose triangle""  - a three-sided block bordered by Melrose, Minor, and Pine-  home to the best ""great eats"" per square foot in Seattle).
I would highly recommend staying at Sanjaya's place."
1198884,20182360,2014-09-25,12543942,Alexandra,"I flew in for a conference at the convention center, and this place is right next to it. Perfect location! Cozy apartment. All around a good experience!"
1198884,20552593,2014-10-01,3691993,Sam,"Sanjaya's apartment was in a perfect spot, right between downtown and the hipper neighborhoods that are coming alive in the city. Apartment was exactly as shown. Easy entry and access. We would stay again. "
1198884,20827824,2014-10-06,19838160,Wlisses,Sanjaya foi muito atencioso. O apartamento estava limpo e bem arrumado. As instruções por ele deixada foram claras e a proximidade com Downtown deixaram nossa estadia muito tranquila e agradável. Apesar dessa proximidade o bairro é extremamente tranquilo e silencioso. Recomendo.
1198884,21011445,2014-10-09,17921594,William,Sanjayas condo was in a great location.  Close to downtown and capitol hill.  The apartment was clean and the bed was comfortable.  Sanjaya was easy to work with in every respect.  I highly recommend Sanjaya and his condo.
1198884,21283681,2014-10-14,9445704,Stephen,"Great location! Close downtown, the convention center etc...
Apartment is clean. I would definitely come back."
1198884,21889478,2014-10-26,7486205,Elyssa,"Sanjaya's place was a wonderful place to escape to during my vacation.  Everything was ready for my arrival, and he even provided a helpful guide to both the condo and the nearby neighborhood.

The condo is well located and it's quick and easy to walk to many noteworthy places in Seattle. Definitely a great place to stay!"
1198884,22096973,2014-10-30,4887978,Jennifer,Had a great experience staying at this apartment!  Everything was very clean and very conveniently located!
1198884,22359377,2014-11-04,8650740,P. Michael,"Even before the booking was confirmed, Sanjaya was very accomodating and pleasant host.  Though we did not meet face to face, he made me feel very welcome.  
The apartment was very comfortable and had welcome home feeling whenever I came back any  amount of time.
I look forward to staying at his place again and again!!"
1198884,22494064,2014-11-08,15201248,George,"Sanjaya was as communicative and assistive as any host could be. His place is what you'd expect of an urban apartment. I found it clean, well appointed and perfectly located for a conference at the center. The surrounding neighborhood had all the usual residential needs: grocery store,pharmacy,bar. Other reviews miss the point of airbnb and Sanjaya's place: character makes distinction. 
I would recommend this place to anyone (or two) folks needing an affordable spot in Seattle anytime."
1198884,22794597,2014-11-15,5317959,Clare,"Sanjaya was very helpful and accommodating during my stay.  He was very prompt in responding to the my questions via email, and was willing to work with my schedule for checking out and lost luggage!  The place is exactly as described for an urban apartment.  It was literally right next to the convention center.   The place is clean and have all the necessary amenities, and close to lots of restaurants and public transportation if you need to get to other places.  It's very affordable for a stay for one or two persons."
1198884,27690305,2015-03-09,22124467,Nathan,"Very central location in First Hill - walking distance to Pike Place, Capitol Hill, etc. Sanjaya was very responsive and answered all of my questions very promptly"
1198884,28180457,2015-03-19,27923001,Michael,"Arrival was great, found the place easily and the apartment was set up and ready for us when we arrived.  Sanjaya is a pro, had keys ready, parking pass and information related to visiting Seattle.  "
1198884,28403060,2015-03-23,25509957,Steven,"This was an excellent place to stay. I did not meet Sanjaya personally, but he immediately buzzed me in remotely upon arrival. The location is excellent, sitting directly between the major shopping district and the capitol hill bars and restaurants. The apartment itself is cozy, basic, and perfect for someone interested in getting an easy place to stay while in Seattle. It’s a little bit far from major tourist attractions, but the whole point of airbnb is to avoid the main tourist drags, right? 

As for amenities, I enjoyed the kitchen (with lots of pots, pans, and utensils), and the bedroom with plenty of extra towels and sheets and whatnot. The living room is perfect for unwinding after a long day of walking and has comfy couches, cable, and a Roku box for Netflix, Pandora, etc. 

In general this is an great place to stay, and Sanjaya is an ideal airbnb host."
1198884,29917133,2015-04-14,5855292,Alex,Great spacious spot located super close to convention center.

1198884,30496078,2015-04-23,26821015,Eric,"This was a great location about two blocks from the Convention Center, four blocks from Capitol Hill, and a nice walk to Pike Place Market. It's not far from the light rail, and there's bus options all around. The apartment was furnished nicely, and even had Netflix available!

We were happy with our stay. Sanjaya answered our questions about Seattle before our arrival, so we were comfortable that he would help us out during our stay if we needed it. There were even maps and guides to Seattle available in the apartment.

Overall, nicely furnished, clean apartment and excellent location. Would stay again!"
1198884,30896701,2015-04-28,5010493,Charisse,"I rented the condo for my mom visiting from out of town. She loved the location, which was within walking distance to downtown Seattle. Gaining access to the condo was easy, and the condo was clean and comfortable.  "
1198884,31933106,2015-05-12,16465755,Elaine,"Sanjaya was a great host. His apartment was perfect for my needs. I was working at the Paramount Theater for two weeks and his apartment was an easy 5 minute walk to work. It had everything this traveler needed, in a city I love. Even though his apartment is next to a freeway, with the windows closed you didn't hear any road noise. The view of the freeway is really pretty, lots of trees and a cool wall that keeps you from seeing any cars. There are about 5 steps to get into the building and an elevator to take you up to the apartment. The bed is quite comfortable, kitchen fully stocked and having a washer and dryer is SO helpful. Thanks for a great stay!"
1198884,32398827,2015-05-17,3329930,Harrison,"Great apartment, super quiet and comfortable. The location was fantastic. It was very easy to walk to the water front, Capitol Hill, Belltown etc etc. I would stay here again for any future trips to Seattle. "
1198884,32725775,2015-05-20,23791016,Kris,"The condo was in a great location, easy walk to pike market. The condo itself was really nice with plenty of room including the pull out couch. We ran into a little hiccup but we were able to get in contact with the host and got everything squared away. We stayed 3 nights and had a great time overall. "
1198884,32920309,2015-05-23,2258784,Kimberly And Ryan,"Sanjaya's place worked out great for out stay. It was a 15-20 min walk from almost all the spots we wanted to go, which was really convenient. The place was very clean and comfortable. It is located next to the freeway, so since we had the windows open most of the stay there was some decent background noise, but the convenience of everything else balanced it out. I'd reccomend it for anyone interested in scoping out Pikes Place, Capitol Hill, downtown, or the Space Needle. Thanks for great stay!"
1198884,33654340,2015-05-31,28476674,Charles,"Good place to stay, clean and cozy in a great location. Sanjaya was prompt to let me in the place. Pretty hands off approach. Very modern."
1198884,37292304,2015-07-06,28468150,David,The location and the facilities are good except without air condition. The communication with Sanjaya is ok.
1198884,43388617,2015-08-19,37930929,Heather,"We had a wonderful time staying at Sanjaya's condo in Seattle. The place is in a great location, just between downtown and Capitol Hill - we were able to walk to most of our destinations. Some pro's about the condo were the fully equipped kitchen so we could cook, and the TV with cable + Roku so that we had something to watch at night. We would definitely come back to stay and see more of the city. "
1198884,44297315,2015-08-25,35916507,Patrick,"We stayed 3 nights and everything was great.  The check-in was perfectly smooth and the condo was exactly what we wanted.  The description was accurate and the place was clean.  The location of the condo was great, just across from the convention centre and just a few minutes walk from the retail core."
1198884,44676482,2015-08-28,39880231,Tommy,"Very nice place. Really close to the convention center and lots to do within walking distance. Only downside was that it can be a little loud in the morning, and the Internet wasn't very stable. "
1198884,45363075,2015-09-02,28260407,Alicia,"Sanjaya's condo was clean, comfy, and private. The location was very close to the convention center as described, which was greatly appreciated. We loved the entertainment options - wifi, netflix, and roku.

Staying here made our trip enjoyable. Thank you Sanjaya!"
1198884,45703739,2015-09-05,22220803,Vivian,"The apartment was located very close to EVERYTHING! It was so convenient walking everywhere including the Pike Place market, monorail, malls and literally right there from the convention center. The place was very cozy and had everything we needed! Thank you for hosting us! We would definitely come back again!"
1198884,46500632,2015-09-11,40940025,Becky,"Really nice place, great location. Everything was comfortable, functional, and as pictured in the listing. It was easy to check in late in the evening. "
3401644,18915342,2014-09-02,20228207,Jade,"This is the perfect space for a quiet Seattle getaway! 

The apartment is lovely, bright, comfortable and welcoming. The neighborhood is quiet, but only steps away from a lively avenue with great restaurants and shops. With Seattle Center, Pikes Place, and Downtown within walking distance, this is the ideal location to explore the city from.

Paula was a great host, and made check-in and out a breeze. We had a great stay, and would highly recommend this apartment!


"
3401644,19099868,2014-09-06,13322261,Trey,"Great, extremely safe neighborhood and walking distance to retail area with great shops, cafes, etc.  Apartment is lovely and the photos are accurate. "
3401644,28907118,2015-03-31,29562829,Chrissy,"This apartment is in a very quiet and safe residential neighborhood.  Apartment photos are accurate, and the space is just as described.  I slept very well during my stay, the bed was very comfortable.  

The apartment is just a quick walk away from a great downtown area with some really cute shops, cafes, and restaurants.  Paula made us feel at home in her space!  She made restaurant recommendations, and was very helpful in providing directions to/from all locations I asked about. 

As this was my first time to Seattle, I was unaware of how many hills are in this city!  Queen Anne is located at the top of a big hill which overlooks the city.  There are a lot of spectacular views of the mountains, the cityscape, and Lake Union, which is a great perk when you are a tourist.  However, being on top of a big hill does make walking back to the apartment after a long day of sight-seeing daunting, so taking the bus was necessary.  Thankfully there are bus stops super close the apartment.  Walking to the downtown area or tourist attractions was about a 30 min walk, mostly downhill.  Overall, I loved staying in a quiet neighborhood that provided a different view of the city."
3401644,37885084,2015-07-11,36068038,Andrea (Andy),"Paula and her Queen Anne apartment are wonderful. This is our first Airbnb and I am left wondering why would anyone use a hotel? 
The neighborhood is charming, getting on public transportation was easy, strolling to the more commercial section of the neighborhood was pleasant, and we found a great dinner and breakfast spot. Trader Joe's was also within walking distance.
The apartment is welcoming and safe. Thank you Paula for a perfect Seattle experience!"
3401644,44933472,2015-08-30,38103607,Janie,"Thanks to our host, Paula, our first Airbnb experience was excellent.  Paula set our expectation with her accurate photos and description of her apartment, her communication and responsiveness, and her welcome package upon arrival.  The Queen Anne Hill location was perfect ( just 3.5 blocks away from my cousin's day spa), and we enjoyed walking to and enjoying the local restaurants.  We will definitely be back!"
3870253,18832640,2014-09-01,9250695,Lauren,"This is a wonderful space! Steven and Dawn made my boyfriend and I feel very welcomed and as though we could make ourselves at home. The space itself was very clean, well decorated, and private. The place is in a convenient location - easy to walk to restaurants, bars, etc. in Fremont and Wallingford and super close to the bus that takes you to Ballard, UW, or downtown. I definitely recommend staying with Steven and Dawn if you are visiting Seattle!"
3870253,18964326,2014-09-03,20380757,Alvina,"This place was great, Tucked into the end of a street, very private with ample parking. The loft was spacious with a lot of beds, though not great for tall people, and the apartment had everything. Dawn was quick to respond to messages and text, very communicative and flexible! All in all a great experience, location close to everything, I would recommend for anyone and definitely come back! "
3870253,19299885,2014-09-09,20849192,Gabe,"Steven and Dawn were wonderful hosts and made for a really special trip to Seattle. The rental space was warm, inviting and comfortably accommodated all five of us. Very convenient location - less than ten minutes to Downtown and within just a few miles of great restaurants and a large grocery store. We had a wonderful time here and will definitely contact Steven and Dawn the next time we visit Seattle!"
3870253,19395437,2014-09-11,21018251,Alan,The host were a lovely couple that made us feel right at home.  The place was even nicer than the pictures revealed - so many nice details. The place was centrally located.  It was on the corner of a busy intersection but the yard around was like an oasis in the middle of the city.  All in all it exceeded our expectations.
3870253,19626975,2014-09-15,19784230,Dennis,This was my first time using Airbnb and it was just 1 word. AMAZING! Dawn and Steve are awesome host. The loft was just charming. Everything was clean. I am most definitely coming back here in the near future.
3870253,19982030,2014-09-21,13405850,Angela,"Steven and Dawn's place was lovely. They were so helpful and friendly, with quick communication and all the info we needed about the city.  Even with a last minute booking they left breakfast basics. It's a good location to grab the bus downtown or explore Wallingford and Fremont. Greenland is a short distance away as well. Great upstairs loft so would be perfect for a family. Was on a busy street which was a little noisy in the day but windows were sound proof when closed and nights had less traffic. Would stay with Dawn and Steven again in a heart beat."
3870253,20297948,2014-09-27,10249511,David,Staying with Steven and Dawn was my parents introduction to Airbnb and it was an entirely positive experience for them. The apartment was clean and the listing gave a good indication of what it would be like. Steven and Dawn were very helpful ensuring that my family was able to do washing and get everything that they needed.
3870253,20445005,2014-09-29,20985236,Jessy,This was my first air b&b experience and Steven and Dawn set the bar really high. I traveled to Seattle with my husband and two boys one 17 and the other 8. The apartment was better than the description and Steven and Dawn have thought of everything!! We were greeted and given a tour by Dawn and told to come and go as we pleased. She even provided goodies for us. We loved having a whole apt to ourselves and the kids loved the loft. The neighborhood is awesome with so many things to do just in Wallingford. We were not far from anything and were able to do a lot on our short stay in Seattle. I can't find anything negative about the apt or my stay. Not that we needed to use the provided washer and dryer but it wasn't available and Dawn offered to wash our clothes for us. They have a beautiful backyard and provided us with information about site seeing. If ever back in Seattle I will def stay with Steven and Dawn again. I felt like family and the boys loved Mrs Dawn!!
3870253,20856818,2014-10-06,2472136,Heather,"Great experience. Dawn and Steven were helpful and welcoming. They were always a text away if we had any questions. The apartment was cute, comfortable, clean and tastefully decorated.

We will definitely return!"
3870253,21673030,2014-10-21,21606662,Alicia,"The Wallingford Apt was charming and wonderful. Not only were the hosts',  Dawn and Steven DeGroot very welcoming, the neighborhood was great too with a central location. We could not have asked for more, and if and when we return we hope to stay again. Five Stars"
3870253,22028830,2014-10-28,21815123,Jeff,"Steven and Dawn were fantastic hosts! The place is clean & beautiful and the price is more than reasonable. What makes this place stand out is how hospitable the hosts were.

Upon our first arrival, the Steven and Dawn provided us water, juices and snacks. They had good suggestions for places to eat and places to grab drinks. When my phone got wet from a hike, Steven and Dawn provided me with a bag of rice to soak my phone in. Any problems you have, they are quick to accommodate. 

I personally got to spend a bit of time getting to know Steven and Dawn and learned about their backgrounds and their family. If you are planning a trip to Seattle, I would highly suggest this place and definitely plan in a few hours just to get to know your hosts."
3870253,22335870,2014-11-03,40277,Jasta,"Dawn and Steven were great with communication, and very flexible! My cousin wanted to join in on our weekend in Seattle last minute, and they were open to accomodating us all. With a seperate entrance, we felt like we had our own private apartment! There were ample blankets, straw medallions, trinkets like ""The answer book"" and a cozy fireplace! We loved this little gem.The place is central and walking distance to our favorite places in seattle and the price, fantastic. Thank you again."
3870253,22711572,2014-11-12,12089214,Danielle,"This was a fantastic place to stay for our Seattle trip! The layout of the space was perfect for us 5 girls. We especially liked the soft carpet and warm fireplace! We found it a bit difficult to get around because of the one-ways surrounding the apartment, but as we discovered the city, we realize that these one-ways are everywhere! 
Dawn was very welcoming and helpful in showing us where to find some things around town. I would recommend this place to any group for a cozy, comfortable stay.  
 "
3870253,22907537,2014-11-17,13901820,Karen,"We had a lively time at Steven and Dawn's. We were a group of five (2 kids and 3 adults) so loved having the kitchen and the extra space that we wouldn't have had in a hotel. 

The location was fantastic. It's really close to the park and the zoo. Their garden is spectacular, especially in the evening with the lights. 

Bedding and beds were great. Kitchen had everything we needed. Fireplace kept us warm. The loft and ladder were fun for the kids. Lots of natural light all day. 

Would recommend this place. 

"
3870253,23381170,2014-11-30,11713481,David,"A cute, well appointed apartment with its own entrance. The living room is a cozy gathering place complete with a fireplace. My family of four was comfortable and we appreciated the privacy of this apartment. The master bedroom has a comfy bed. Visitors not used to city life should know this home is on a fairly busy street and you will hear a lot of traffic. There are trees and a fence which make you feel as if you are not on a busy street, though. This is a nice option for families. We spent many hours one night talking by the fire since we were all together in a private space vs. two hotel rooms! Not having a t.v. was a plus in this setting, to encourage conversation!"
3870253,23690115,2014-12-08,22937302,Chet,"We arrived late due to some emergency, but Dawn was there waiting for us. Thank you! 

Steven and Dawn's place is so cute and cozy that we start out our stay by taking a lot of photos inside the house before carrying in our stuffs. They did many extra things to make sure our stay being convenient and comfortable, and it was. The kids loved the loft so much that they spend much of their time climbing up and down the stairs while the adults were sitting comfortable watching them. Thank you so much Steven and Dawn for sharing your place with us for our stay in Seattle!"
3870253,24298743,2014-12-25,11551353,Brian,Our family of 5 had a great time at this place. One large bed in the bedroom and 3 twin beds up in the loft. Cozy and clean. Dawn met our every need and was quite welcoming. She was quite easy to contact throughout the entire stay whenever we needed anything. Would definitely stay here again in the future.
3870253,24385001,2014-12-27,9377149,Ge,"Very good, couldn't be better. "
3870253,24543435,2014-12-30,24091881,Ammie,"Stephen and Dawn have a most adorable place in Seattle.  Our family of four absolutely loved our time in their rental.  They were extremely welcoming and made us feel right at home.  Truly, there is no other place we would want to stay in Seattle.  It is a quick 10 minute drive to Pikes Place Market.  Five minutes to the Woodland Park Zoo and family friendly Green Lake Park.  The beds were very comfortable, the bathroom clean and the unit has its own washer and dryer.  Our children loved playing in the two story fort and tire swing out front while we enjoyed watching them from our own private balcony.  This rental is a must for any family wanting to visit Seattle.  "
3870253,37080142,2015-07-04,3524265,Petra," I absolutely loved their cute and cozy place! We were so surprised when we got there because it looked so much better in person!! 
Steve, Dawn and Sophie were wonderful. They stocked the fridge with some goodies  and it had everything we needed and more! "
3870253,37301367,2015-07-06,13982376,Michael,Really nice atmosphere; light & airy place; well equipped. Steven & Dawn were very friendly and forthcoming. 
3870253,37556510,2015-07-08,30941938,Colleen,We were greeted at a super cute little cottage with an amazing back yard.  Steve meet us with groceries in hand! 
3870253,37747373,2015-07-10,2983871,Soledad,"Our time in the loft was short but so sweet. The space was homey, clean, well decorated, equipped and perfect. Steve and dawn were great hosts! Thanks! "
3870253,41063989,2015-08-04,30046306,Katie,"My relatives thoroughly enjoyed their stay at Steven's and Dawn's apartment. Pictures are accurate, and everything is described as it is, clean and comfortable. Their garden is so cozy and lovely. We could tell they take a good care of this place! Travelling with children, my relatives appreciated having a kitchen equipped with utensils, and there is a washer and a dryer, which everyone appreciated! Wallingford is a quiet yet accessible neighborhood, and the proximity to grocery markets, restaurants and bus stops made this apartment a perfect place for a family to enjoy Seattle. Steven and Dawn promptly responded to our questions before and during our stay. I only met Dawn, and she is such a kind and friendly host. As the other reviewer noted, this is the best place for a family visiting Seattle!
"
3870253,43028122,2015-08-17,29585140,Scarlet,"What a lovely apartment and home for our family in Seattle!  We had a great time in this apartment.  The DeGroots were absolutely wonderful hosts who greeted us with groceries on our first day, and opened up their beautiful home to us.  We had a fantastic time visiting Seattle, and loved coming back to our home base.  The location was excellent - right near Woodland Park Zoo and Green Lake (near swimming and a fantastic playground) and close to downtown Seattle. Thank you Steven and Dawn for a lovely stay!"
3870253,43404754,2015-08-19,36490727,Jessica,"I cannot say enough good things about Steve and Dawn's sweet little cottage. I asked my daughter what her favorite part about Seattle was and she said their house! They were hospitable, the place was pristine, and centrally located. The garden was amazing and everything was extremely nice and comfortable. We are planning our trip back next summer! It's perfect for a small family to explore the city while having a place like home to come back to."
3870253,43661835,2015-08-21,16304507,Emily,"Dawn and Steve were absolutely wonderful hosts.  The minute we booked this apartment, they emailed us a personal greeting and offered recommendations for our girl's trip along with any answers to questions we may have.  During our travel, they were extremely responsive and assured us that the apartment would be ready whenever we arrived.  They were there to welcome us and gave us a quick tour of the place.  One of my favorite touches was that they had healthy snacks waiting for us - much appreciated after travelling!  The description of this apartment is exactly what we envisioned and more!  The neighborhood is quaint with hidden gems that Steve and Dawn recommended we try.  Steve is a landscaper and the entrance to their home/apartment is a botanical garden.  The apartment/loft was perfect for two girls as we each had our own personal space to sleep.  They even had a washer/dryer that we utilized at the end of our stay.  Coming from St. Louis, Missouri, we were enthralled with the Seattle weather (no bugs)!  We loved that we could leave the windows open during our stay and have a constantly fresh and cool environment.  The apartment is a quick run/walk to the bustling Green Lake Park and a quick Uber ride to the great nightlife spots of Capital Hill and Fremont Street, the bay where we went SUPing, the Arboretum, and Pike Place Market.  Do not think twice about staying with Dawn and Steve.  They are incredible people and made our first airbnb experience a memorable one.  "
3870253,44547348,2015-08-27,38594232,Michelle,Steven and Dawn were such great hosts! They immediately made us feel welcome and part of the family. They were so accommodating and courteous even providing a light breakfast. The apartment is beautiful with lots of light and was perfect for our needs. It's easily accessible to downtown Seattle with a bus stop 1 to 2 blocks away. 
3870253,45244919,2015-09-01,16094960,Svetlana,"Great little place, just as pictured!  Well stocked kitchen, cozy loft, easy check in/ check out, and a wonderful little garden and tire swing! We came with 6 people for 4 nights, and had one couple in the master bedroom, and everyone else in the loft/couch. Cereal and milk was provided which was fantastic, and we were able to cook eggs in the kitchen, which saved us a lot of money on going out. Also, communication was very responsive, the neighborhood seemed safe, and street parking was readily available (we came with 2 cars). Basically, the whole thing was super comfortable and completely stress free. Would absolutely stay again (maybe next year), thank you!"
3870253,46128146,2015-09-08,35736776,Tricia,"Dawn and Steven were perfect hosts.  Dawn greeted us when we arrived with a friendly smile and the kitchen was stocked with coffee, juice, yogurt and healthy snacks to start our first day in Seattle.
The apt. was clean, well furnished and a perfect place for our family. The sleeping loft was great and the kids LOVED the backyard treehouse and tire swing!  It's in a great location - easy walk to the main street with cafes and shops as well as parks and bus routes. 
  We would highly recommend this guest apt. to anyone visiting Seattle! "
3870253,46896809,2015-09-14,27788911,John,"Steven and Dawn were fantastic hosts.  Kept in touch periodically right up to and beyond our stay, although we never did actually meet up with them in person.  This is a testament to how private the apartment is.  The apartment is just as shown in the pictures, and is in a fantastic neighbourhood; and we loved coming back to it after a busy day in the city.  "
3870253,47183262,2015-09-16,19478842,Will,"Dawn was simply excellent. Our family (3yo, 2mo) felt right at home, right away. The loft was very spacious, clean and functional.  Lots of options for sleeping! A playful yard outside entertained my son, especially the cool treehouse!"
3870253,47674493,2015-09-21,18220177,Katie,"Steven and Dawn were extremely welcoming and accommodating. The space was lovely and had everything our group needed and then some! The location is great with easy access to the Fremont and Wallingford neighborhoods. This was by far the best AirBnB experience I have had thus far, I would highly recommend this rental!"
3870253,48528830,2015-09-27,40325331,Kimberly,"We had a great time staying at Steven and Dawn's Wallinford Apartment. Dawn was quick to answer all our questions before our stay and provided breakfast items upon our arrival. The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed. Our daughter enjoyed sleeping in the loft and the playhouse in the garden. We enjoyed walking to restaurants down the street, playing at the neighborhood parks and the quick drive to downtown Seattle. The main street above their house can be noisy during heavy traffic times, but Steven and Dawn have done everything they can to cut the noise - installing double pane windows and a garden fountain. "
3870253,49031677,2015-09-30,150820,Ali,"This place was perfect! Great location, and easy accessibility to all parts of  the city. 

I stayed here with my boyfriend and parents, and it was a perfect amount of space for all four of us. We especially loved the cute garden area. Dawn gave us great restaurant suggestions, and left us bagels and fruit for breakfast. Very welcoming and responsive hosts. 

Highly recommended!"
3870253,49618362,2015-10-05,41216713,David,"Steven and Dawn were wonderful hosts during our trip to Seattle. Our flight landed late but Dawn stayed awake to welcome us, which was a great gesture. They even bought us breakfast items! In terms of spaciousness, we were a group of 5 and the loft was more than accommodating. The location was great too. Walking distance to many restaurants and bars nearby. Quick drive to downtown and university districts. We would highly recommend!

"
3870253,53490108,2015-11-09,8776642,Alexandra,The loft was a great place to stay. Steven and Dawn have created a beautiful space inside and out. The garden that you walk through to get to the loft is just as enchanting as the inside. I stayed here with 5 girlfriends and it was a great way to spend time in Seattle together without breaking the bank. The only thing I would advise is that it is tight for 6. One of us ended up sleeping on the couch but we were all comfortable and very happy with the stay. 
3870253,54320286,2015-11-18,39153828,Beau,"Steven and Dawn's loft was as cozy and charming as the pictures suggested – we loved it! Four grown guys stayed at this lovely guest-home for four nights and it was perfect. It's perfectly clean, and both the kitchen and bathroom were well stocked. It's very simple to get in and out of the loft, and the garden area outside is beautiful.

It rained all but one day of our trip, so we enjoyed the added comfort of the fireplace every time we stepped back inside for a break.

Our hosts were very accommodating and welcoming. They were highly accessible, but let us do our thing with no influence other than friendly waves as we came and went.

We really couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. We only spent 1 day in/around Wallingford, yet we were able to easily hop around the various neighborhoods of Seattle. The neighborhood is nice, we rented a car and parked on the street. Super safe area.

Thanks, Dawn and Steven!"
3870253,57572463,2015-12-27,25687167,Sohrab,Were amazingly gracious hosts. Gave us Christmas cookies on the holiday. The space was super super super cute!!
4211629,22940013,2014-11-17,5361710,Julie,"The photos are accurate and the place is actually a bit bigger than it looks in the photos. The kitchen has great amenities, the bed is comfy, the fireplace is super cozy, and there is lots of light through the large front windows. Lovely view (like the title says!) And just a super short walk (5 minutes) to coffee, groceries, and restaurants in Interbay. The house is in the beautiful neighborhood of Queen Anne, and if you are willing to walk a little bit (15 minutes) through a lovely neighborhood there are a few cute bars, restaurants, and boutiques. I would definitely recommend this place!"
4211629,24367645,2014-12-27,18994666,Cliff,The flat was in excellent condition.  Great neighborhood with outstanding views.  Large and very comfortable 2 bdm. flat with a wonderful kitchen.  Checkin was easy as the host met us at the flat with the key (she lives upstairs).
4211629,28540076,2015-03-25,29353666,Billy,"We had a lovely visit and Kimberly was a very nice host, offering to pick up some breakfast items for us as we were arriving late. This is a very comfortable space with ample room and is close to all Seattle has to offer. "
4211629,33265515,2015-05-26,22730336,Luis,Everything was great at this appartment. The acomodations were in very good condition and Kimberly was very nice and helpful. I'd definitely recommend this appartment.
4211629,33840753,2015-06-01,4526743,Kerri-Ann,"This is a really nice apartment & Kimberley is a lovely, gracious host (she answered all our pre-booking queries promptly & accurately, she had stocked the fridge with breakfast supplies, and she gave us some great advice about where to eat on our first night: the Golden Beetle in Ballard - we ate there & highly recommend it!)
It's probably a good idea to have a car when staying here (there is off street parking) as it is up on a hill.  However, we decided not to hire a car and it was just a short walk downhill to a 24/7 grocery store & to the bus stop to take a bus downtown or up to Ballard."
4211629,36657549,2015-06-30,2087308,Adam,"Kimberly's place is spectacular.  Its quite large, very clean and very comfortable with a fully appointed kitchen.  The neighborhood is lovely and great for walks being situated on top of a hill with long views of the water and the mountains.  Kimberly was a gracious host and very helpful at every stage of the visit.  If you are coming to Seattle this is a great place to stay."
4211629,38124145,2015-07-13,18272136,Dustin,Kimberly's place was great. Good-sized 2/1 and extremely clean. The neighborhood  was great as well. I definitely would stay here again. 
1589461,7125887,2013-09-07,3181181,Christine,"Melissa was very helpful in getting us settled. We were able to get parking for the building.  She did ask us to move out of the original place we reserved, but made it up to us by helping with the parking."
1589461,14755654,2014-06-25,3597702,Joseph,"The apartment was exactly as described. Clean, quiet, and close to UW. Plenty of space and a comfortable bed. "
1589461,14859387,2014-06-28,14379389,Gary,Melissa is a champ.  This was my first AirBNB encounter and Melissa provides us with all the info needed and a comfortable place to stay.  I look forward to using AirBNB many more times.  Thanks again Melissa!
1589461,16361718,2014-07-26,14832838,Timothy,"The place is as advertised: very clean, simple (to the point of being a bit austere) and in a great location.  Melissa was a very helpful host.  Only downside was the the neighborhood can be noisy any time of night, although the building itself was very quiet.  But that is the price for being very close to a lot of restaurants and bars in a student area."
1589461,43219244,2015-08-18,3677018,Francisco,"My wife and I stayed at this place for one month. The good things about it are its location, only 5 min from the the University of Washington for those visiting there, that it is quite spacious and with plenty of natural light, and that Melissa was very helpful when needed. However, there are many bad things that would make us choose a different place next time. Most importantly, the bedroom is very noisy during the night because it faces the laundry room of a hotel. Even with the windows (double glazing) closed, the only solution for me was to sleep with earplugs every night. The other problem is that it is under equipped, we had to buy many things for the kitchen to function properly. Another thing is that when we arrived the place was not really clean, Melissa had to take out many things from the fridge and bin when we told her about it. Also, remember to ask for proper bed sheets, as the default was to have only one bottom bed sheet between you and the mattress and an electric blanket to cover you (difficult to clean properly). Overall, the place was OK, but too noisy and with below average cleaning standards."
1738425,8957987,2013-11-28,6946575,Beau,"Mandy has a beautiful home near downtown Seattle. Nice little newly built area. Parking was very easy and always available. Very nice clean home. Neat green/energy efficient amenities. Mandy is very nice, quiet and laid back. She was more than willing to help me get adjusted for my stay. Thanks again."
1738425,9323741,2013-12-21,10390585,Cherisse,"I enjoyed my stay at Mandy's home, which is very new, clean, and has a cozy modern cabin-feel to it. Located in Columbia city--a very diverse part of Seattle--it has great local coffee shops and organic food markets. Mandy is a great host; she's very nice and I highly recommend her!"
1738425,10140082,2014-02-02,1245925,Lindsay,"Mandy is a cool person and was a great host. You might call the house's style minimalist, but it's definitely calming. Close to light rail, buses, and the main part of Columbia City, it's easy to get to the action but a quiet place."
1738425,10872981,2014-03-11,638937,Susanne,The reservation was canceled 43 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1738425,14648341,2014-06-23,7217033,Natasha,"Mandy was a great and generous host. Staying in her home felt like visiting an old friend. Even though she was very busy she made time to share tips and local knowledge. Her ecological house is gorgeous, with lots of space, light and privacy. The neighbourhood was lovely and diverse, a walking distance from the lake and main street with quirky shops and cafes. Just a ten minute drive from downtown Seattle. I couldn't recommend staying with Mandy more and would definitely return there if back in Seattle. "
1738425,14760262,2014-06-25,16911073,Barbara,"My husband and I popped up to Seattle from Portland for a concert in Columbia City. Staying with Mandy was a great 1st Airbnb experience for us. Mandy... and her house... are lovely & comfortable. Nice, new green-constructed townhouse, complete with a living garage roof visible from our bedroom. Close to Columbia City Theater (the venue for our show) & restaurants & pubs of all stripes. We would definitely stay there again. Thanks, Mandy."
1738425,15355279,2014-07-07,6091896,Nancy,"I so enjoyed visiting with Mandy and staying in her beautiful new home. It was very interesting to learn about her green-built home and the well-designed, planned neighborhood.  Her house was a peaceful haven for me after extensive travels and I felt very welcome. Thanks, Mandy.
"
1738425,17526528,2014-08-13,17054844,Miguel,"First Airbnb experience and it was a good one. Mandy is a very accommodating host who is very knowledgeable about the Seattle area. Her place is very short walk to light rail and all the amenities Columbia City has to offer (restaurants, shops). Would highly recommend. "
1738425,18688954,2014-08-30,9297503,Mason,"Mandy was very welcoming and a kind individual. She immediately made me feel at home. Beautiful house and a great location. 

Thank you so much Mandy!
"
1738425,18814612,2014-09-01,18946135,Aaron,Mandy was a gracious and flexible host. Her home was an excellent location- 10 minute walk from Link Light Rail (great if you fly into SEATAC (20 minutes) and want to continue exploring downtown (another 15-20 minutes). Mandy's home and neighborhood is comfortable. Highly recommend. 
1738425,25479574,2015-01-17,10132034,Ramani,I simply loved my stay with Mandy.  I had been traveling for more than a month and was looking for a place to sit back and relax--and that's exactly what I found.  Mandy's place looks out onto grass and trees and is serene and peaceful.  And it's also just a short ride from downtown Seattle by light rail.  It's the best of both worlds.  Mandy herself is one of the most welcoming people I have encountered.
1738425,27586658,2015-03-08,3131760,Heidi,"Mandy's place was beyond perfect for my needs. Her place is very convenient, accessible from the highway and getting to downtown. The house is immaculate. The setup was perfect. Everything I needed for my sleeping quarters. There was more than adequate storage in my bedroom (large, well thought out, walk in closet). The neighborhood is diverse but I felt very secure and safe. Mandy was very responsive and helpful when needed. I would highly recommend this place."
1738425,33632377,2015-05-30,9410774,Ana,Mandy has a beautiful home and the neighborhood feels safe. There were no issues with parking. 
1738425,34822775,2015-06-12,32419224,Loren,"Mandy, and her sister were very welcoming to me, and took pains to ensure that I was comfortable during my stay. The home is fairly new, and very stylish and modern. The bed was very comfortable, and I appreciated having a desktop space to use for working in the evening. I look forward to staying there again in the future, when my travels take me back into that area. "
1738425,35254358,2015-06-16,16301617,Maria,"We had a short stay in Mandy's house and we enjoyed it. Location is perfect, near the light rail station and restaurants in the area. Check in/ out instructions are clear and were provided in a timely manner. Lovely home and room. Highly recommended."
1738425,36699402,2015-06-30,20221185,Raquel,"My stay at Mandy's home has been an amazing experience. I have been there for 15 days and everything was perfect : it is a clean and quiet house in a familiar neigbourhood in Columbia City. My room was big with a great wardrobe and sunlight all day long. The location is perfect for those who are searching for relax but also visit the city: the light train/Link takes to the downtown in 20min. And it's very comfortable.
Haelen has been a wonderful host, always taking care of the house, the garden and the guests, helping me  with everything I needed. Thanks for all the recommandations, Haelen! :)

Hope I'll come back soon!
"
1738425,36912819,2015-07-02,3041928,Greg,The host was very welcoming and helpful during our brief stay. The room was as described and the neighborhood was great. 
1738425,37007515,2015-07-03,976360,William,Mandy's place was great.  I arrived very late and everything was laid out for me.  The instructions for entry and exit were very clear and made access incredibly easy.  The light rail stop was only a 10 minute walk away.  The second floor bedrooms gave me the impression of privacy and the 1st floor seemed like it would be a great place to socialize if you wanted to do that.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat.
1738425,37197491,2015-07-05,3883746,Alison,"The private room at Mandy & Haellen's is a great, quiet spot to explore Seattle from. The bathroom is nice and large and very convenient, the bed is comfortable, and everything was clean. We were only there for a short stay so did not use the kitchen much, but it is nicely set up and has everything you need as well. We did store leftovers in the fridge, which is helpful to have access to! The Light Link is a very close walk to take you to downtown, Pike Place, etc., you'll just need to be a bit creative with buses, walking, and taxis to explore from there. We always felt safe walking in the neighborhood and would return!"
1738425,37417674,2015-07-06,29888495,David,Clean and comfortable! Recommend!
1738425,37594984,2015-07-08,20238208,Michael,"Mandy was very responsive and flexible with us about our arrival time and check-in, which we appreciated.  The house indeed is about a 10 minute walk from the light rail, which easily got us both to downtown and to the airport in under 20 minutes.  We were greeted at the home by Mandy's sister, Haellen, who was out front gardening.  Haellen was lovely and endearingly quirky (in that Pacific Northwest sort of way), chatting with us for a while about her own background before showing us around the house and leaving us with our privacy.

The house was immaculate and beautifully decorated with a Pacific and Japanese decor.  The room had been refurnished and was absolutely gorgeous; I wish I lived in a place this beautiful!  The stairs are made of cork, so you leave your shoes at the door to keep them from being damaged, but it feels great beneath your feet.  The bed was perfectly kept and extremely comfortable.  It was a little warm one of our nights there and the house doesn't have AC, but the Seattle evening breeze cooled it down very well.  Just a note, the windows do indeed have shades (the current picture must have been taken before they were installed).

Too long didn't read: Highly recommended!  Beautiful home, very convenient to both the airport and downtown.  No AC, but house is airy and cools down well at night."
1738425,37793025,2015-07-10,31487463,Ryan,We had a great time during our stay at Mandy's! She was a gracious host and had a beautiful home. 
1738425,37985275,2015-07-12,5992959,Xavier,"The host, Haileen, was very friendly. She welcomed us when we arrived at the house and gave us some blueberries from her garden to taste.  

Pros: 
- Location was great, just a few short blocks from light rail. There was no need to rent a car. 
- House, room, and bathrooms were very clean. 
- Our room was large, but simple. It met our needs. Wi-fi access was good. 
- We loved the green features of the home. 
- Closet was a really good size (great for someone who plans on staying longer). 
- Access to the house was simple, the neighborhood felt safe and there were nice trails to run and walk on. We went on a long walk at Seaward Park and went for a run around the local golf course (they had a nice gravel trail around the course). There was also a farmer's (email hidden) hospital Saturday morning. 
- Great restaurants and live music a 10 minute walk away on Rainier ave. 
- The host and the other roommate were very polite. 

Other notes: 
- The room decor and furniture looked much different than the pictures, even though it was still a nice room. 
- The room was on the warm side at night, having an inexpensive fan  stored in the closet and available to help the air move would've been nice 

Overall, it was a great experience. I recommend this place to anyone looking to explore Columbia City or looking to take advantage of public transit to tour Seattle. Thank you for your hospitality.

1738425,38437509,2015-07-15,36636320,Jay,Our first time in Seattle was great and so much of that is thanks to Mandy and Haellen. The whole house was beautiful and we felt both welcome and comfortable. Thanks for answering all our questions and making our stay enjoyable. I highly recommend staying here if you're ever visiting Seattle.
1738425,39078548,2015-07-20,5124155,Laura,"Mandy's place was both clean and convenient to both Seattle and the airport. The pre-check in instructions were very clear and we really appreciated having a great quality washer and dryer to clean some things during our travels. The room was not the one pictured, but the bed was still comfortable. "
1738425,39255485,2015-07-21,8146851,Tobias,"Very nice place, very friendly host, very much recommended!  "
1738425,39324004,2015-07-22,21193046,Karen,"Mandy's place was exceptional.  Very clean, very attractive, very funky.  Good location, close to downtown bus and light transit.  Great introduction to her place, and then we were private (our preference).  Thanks so much.  "
1738425,39415490,2015-07-23,36954479,Patrick,This was our first airbnb experience. Everything was perfectly organized  We received all the Details in advance which made it very easy for us to find everything. We really liked the House  and the room. Both for short Trips and for longer vacations we would highly recommend this Place!!
1738425,40588992,2015-08-01,6000675,Rachel,Beautiful home with clean lines and safety options. It was exactly as pictured and would come again! Thanks for letting us stay in your humble abode!
1738425,41622086,2015-08-08,36452516,Colin,"We had a very comfortable and pleasing stay at Mandy's place. Haellen welcomed us as soon as we arrived and ensured that we felt at home. The place was very clean, organized, eco-friendly, and with an excellent atmosphere. We were able to maintain our privacy for the entire week which we really appreciated. The room we stayed in didn't exactly match the picture, but everything else in the description was accurate. Overall, excellent. "
1738425,41786630,2015-08-09,979227,Kristen,"Mandy and Haellen were great hosts. They greeted us when we arrived, showed us around the zen-like place, and made themselves accessible. My friend and I had a short stay, just one night, but the bed was really comfortable, the house was clean, and they had a large selection of tea and fruit from their trees for us to enjoy. 

Street parking was ample and free on Saturday/Sunday. Their place is very conveniently located. It's a very quick walk to the light rail station and only 5 stops away from Pioneer Square. I plan to stay here again next time I'm in Seattle."
1738425,42184915,2015-08-11,11401050,Cathy,"What a lovely, well-designed and decorated home.  Everything felt fresh, clean and well thought-out.  Mandy's house manual & communications were *wonderful* -- clear and comprehensive.  The location is great as well.  It's an easy walk to the Columbia City light rail and I felt safe walking back after an evening Mariners game."
1738425,44078904,2015-08-23,42050378,Graham,"Had a great stay! Very close to a rapid transit station, super clean, very nice property. Great family neighbourhood."
1738425,45806282,2015-09-06,36994340,Andrew,"Many and her sister Haellen were very inviting!  Many sent us an extremely detailed and helpful message for our arrival and stay, laying out everything we would possibly need to know!  Her sister Haellen communicated with us even before we were in the area, and called to let us know when it was ready.  Once we arrived, she gave us a quick tour of the space and told us how to get around with the light rail.  The place was very tidy and clean, and has a very unique look that my fiance and I loved.  We recommend the Tin Umbrella coffee shop, which is about a 5-10 minute drive from Mandy's!"
1738425,46049458,2015-09-07,34141042,Kevin,This place is clean and comfortable. The host is nice and helpful. I have a good sleep here last night.
1738425,46707258,2015-09-13,36096843,Jamie,"This was a very relaxing beautiful loft-type bedroom. Easy to find. Easy ride into Seattle. Perfect location. If you have a car, Mandy provides an overnight pass that you can make visible from your car. This home has wonderful wood craftsmanship and interior design. It is elegant and peaceful. Architects and interior designers should see this home as it was designed and well-thought out for it environment. Fun and different! "
1738425,47492990,2015-09-19,12759592,Jessica,"We were greeted by Haellen; she was entertaining, funny, and super welcoming. She gave us a nice little tour of the house with some fun facts. It was our first time using Airbnb, also our first time staying in a house like this. It was an all around awesome experience. The neighborhood was cute and quaint, but just outside of it had an urban feel that was really cool. Thanks again for making our trip to Seattle even more memorable.
"
1738425,48055987,2015-09-22,4964293,Jeff,"Great place, great stay! "
1738425,49025906,2015-09-30,42785685,Minke,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was wonderful! I didn't get to meet Mandy but Haellen is a sweet and fun-spirited woman that made my stay very comfortable. She made sure of that, gave me privacy when I wanted and had some fun stories to tell. The room was as described, it has a comfortable bed, and the house in general is great. (I love the stairs!) The house is not so far from the Columbia City Light Rail station that takes you downtown or to the airport. I didn't travel by car so it was perfect. If I ever visit Seattle again I will definitely stay at Mandy's once more. Thank you for the pleasant stay! "
1738425,50091634,2015-10-09,43463506,Benson,"Our stay with Mandy and Haellen's place in Seattle was great. The description given on AirBnB about the home and the room we stayed in was perfectly described. Our stay there was very comfortable and they made us feel very welcomed.

Any questions that we had about the place or what to do in Seattle was answered promptly by either Mandy or Haellen. They were very flexible in when we would be able to arrive as well and made themselves available to greet us. We appreciated this as we did not know how long it would have took for us to arrive.

The room and the place was kept very well. It was very clean.

If people are looking for a place to stay in Seattle and close to light rail transit, we would definitely recommend this place."
1738425,50572701,2015-10-12,43779515,Cassy,"I didn't have the pleasure of meeting Mandy but was greeted by her sister Haellen who was absolutely wonderful. This was my second time staying at an AirBnb and it was my favorite. The place is just perfect. The room is clean and spacious and we loved the eco friendliness and decor of the place. During our stay, we had access to the kitchen and even cooked a romantic dinner our first night. We had privacy and also had great conversations with Haellen. If I go back to Seattle, I would most definitely love to stay here again. "
1738425,51048214,2015-10-17,44853153,Jorge,Excellent experience! 
1738425,51876305,2015-10-24,7853023,Rebekka,"Mandy's home is beautiful, in a great neighborhood, and the bed is very comfortable; but this was our most awkward Airbnb experience to date. I felt Mandy was not the right host for my fiance and I. She was very communicative at first but after she sent a VERY long list of instructions it was radio silence. We never met the host and because of all the rules we were constantly nervous of getting in trouble. To add insult to injury the room down the hall from us was having extremely loud intercourse, which made for an EXTREMELY awkward experience when brushing our teeth in the bathroom right next to their bedroom. Call me a prude, but they could have turned down the volume once they heard footsteps. I don't know if this was the host or another Airbnb guest, because we never saw or met anyone else. We were there for an hour between 6pm and 7pm to drop off our things and then headed out to dinner, we didn't return till 11:30pm and that's when the room down the hall was getting busy. From the long list of instructions that made us feel like we'd get in trouble, to never meeting a host, to the loud neighbors - we left very early the next morning and didn't look back. This just wasn't the Airbnb situation for us, but that's what happens when you roll the dice. "
1738425,52341860,2015-10-28,10343769,Grace,"Mandy and Haellen are nice and accomodating, nice flatmates as well. Good orientation of the house and neighbourhood and what to see in Seattle (no idea at all before coming haha). I was a bit road-weary near the end of my trip, and they respected my privacy. The house is beautiful!!! Close to lightrail and buses, takes you to downtown and airport pretty quick (I don't have a car). Cool neighbourhood, safe at night as well."
1738425,52794319,2015-11-01,10338504,Julie,I had a great stay with Mandy! It was easy to communicate with her. I would definitely stay again! I made a new friend:)
1738425,52883053,2015-11-02,2855970,Janice,The host canceled this reservation 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4848255,25057281,2015-01-05,24593251,Vicenç,The hosts are nice.  The neighborhood is quiet even though the public transportation to down town (city center) it is not really good (the bus stop is in front of the house but there is only  one bus per hour)
4848255,31730903,2015-05-09,1410060,Andrew,"Good host, walking distance to all the great areas. Got my own room on a seperate floor. Luan is superb!"
4848255,32423371,2015-05-17,4942324,Emilia,"Nice room with private bathroom. Great location in residential area, with an easy access to downtown and Seattle attractions.  Luan met me when I arrived and I saw him one more time when I checked out."
4848255,33161407,2015-05-25,8009894,Justine,"Luan was a very nice host, very respectful, and I had a really great stay at his place. The room was clean and tidy, with a comfy bed, your own bathroom, and just a few bus stops from the Downtown and Capitol Hill. I'd definitely reco staying at Luan's apartment for visiting Seattle. Thanks again Luan! "
4848255,45090238,2015-08-31,6592807,Anson,Luan was extremely accommodating. The location was extremely convenient and we had no issues trying to find our way around town and into Seattle. Luan's home was a perfect spot for us to settle down after being out and about. We wouldn't hesitate to book again!
4848255,45497513,2015-09-03,21020345,Michal,"Luan and his wife were very friendly. When I arrived, the power had just gone out as the result of a storm, but Luan kept me updated and provided flashlights and candles to get by and it was resolved in he middle of the night. The room and bathroom are on a separate floor from the rest of the house and so are very private. Since I was leaving on a red eye, I appreciated his flexibility on a later check out time! The location would be best for someone with a car, since the bus across the street runs very infrequently. Walking up or down the hill via many flights of steps will lead to other bus lines."
4848255,47061826,2015-09-15,40555038,Bowen,"Nice, cozy, clean, reasonable priced, and quiet! You get the whole floor to yourself which is nice. You definitely get to enjoy your own privacy! I've only interacted with Luan when we arrived, and his wife, Ellie, when we had to give back the keys. Luan is also very flexible with check in and check out times.

The area was close to many bus stops (5-10 min walk the most) which was convenient and only about an $8 Uber right to most Seattle attractions.

All in all, I highly reccomend Luan's home if you're looking to stay in Seattle for a couple of days. Thank you for hosting us Luan! 
"
4848255,47968675,2015-09-22,37848184,Joelle,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was great! I was worried about my late at night arrival time and early morning departure, but Luan was very flexible and accommodating. The room was perfect for me and my sister: clean with a comfortable bed and adjacent bathroom with all the necessities. We were out and about all the days we stayed, so we only ran into Luan once, but he was easily to keep in contact with via the Airbnb messages. My sister and I aren't very good at figuring out the buses, so we walked or Uber-ed to all our destinations. Definitely would recommend Luan to a friend and would book again if visiting Seattle again!"
4848255,48312989,2015-09-25,4647421,Carrie,"It was wonderful!! They are very lovely people sweet and chill. They very informing of the area. The place was very clean. The room very nice and area was so nice walk around. Very easy to get around area of Seattle.

4848255,49003698,2015-09-30,39964457,Leisl,Luan was very accommodating to our late arrival.  The room was clean and private from the rest of the house.  We could come and go as we wish. Great location with easy access to popular areas both by foot and car.
4848255,49496044,2015-10-04,43949546,Patricia,Enjoyed the wonderful view of Lake Union and the gracious hospitality shown by Luan and his wife.  This was my first experience with airbnb and lucky for me it was great.
4848255,51128116,2015-10-18,41614330,Shawn,"Luan & Ellie is a very nice couple that will make you feel welcome from the time of arrival. They're always very responsive to answer my questions about everything and provide help/assistance. The house is super clean and spacious and you get your room and bathroom located in a different floor so you have very good privacy. There's bus stop just located near the house to downtown, and it's neighborhood is quite safe and  quiet with beautiful lake view. I highly recommend Luan's house. I had a good time there."
4848255,52851598,2015-11-02,28443045,Karnnaree,We had a great experience here. Luan and Ellie are so nice. They're very friendly and so kind. They make us feel comfortable like staying at home. The location of the house is perfect. It's takes about 5-6$ to downtown by Uber. I highly recommend this house for those who are looking for awesome residence.
4848255,52980704,2015-11-03,40826689,Shirley,"Luan and his family were kind and flexible.  I arrived earlier than expected, Luan was graciously waiting at the door with warm welcome.  Check-in was super easy, Luan’s room was very tidy and clean.  I have a bathroom all to myself!  Location was very convenient to Seattle University and freeway.  Street parking was definitely a BIG PLUS!  Wish I could stay longer.   I would certainly plan my next trip with Luan in Seattle again."
4848255,53526529,2015-11-09,38857502,Mirenda,"Luan and Elli were great hosts.  The room and bath were clean and comfortable, and private from the rest of the house.  There was plenty of parking and easily accessible to the freeway.  We very much enjoyed our stay and would not hesitate coming back. "
4848255,54156038,2015-11-16,47576790,Michelle,"Wonderful couple.  Luan and Ellie made me feel like an old friend.  Very helpful with recommendations and advice on what to do in Seattle. The house is very centrally located with easy access to bus routes, and walkable distance to stores and restaurants."
4848255,55388025,2015-12-01,46039616,Kana,"We had a great time in Seattle!
The place was exactly as described; clean and cozy room in a very nice neighborhood, easy access to downtown as well as lots of cafes and restaurants. 
Thanks Luan and Ellie for being such great host!"
4848255,56933881,2015-12-20,44876200,Kumarie,This was an ideal place to stay!  Luan and Ellie were both very sweet and so helpful. It's a $7-8 uber ride to downtown. The neighborhood is beautiful and lots of places to eat and have coffee within a 10 minute walk. Nice room and bathroom 
4848255,58299882,2016-01-02,9010696,Justin,Luan was gracious and welcoming. A fantastic host I would recommend to anyone. His space in Seattle is functional and a convenient drive to some essential attractions.
7661577,44083743,2015-08-23,14417100,Charles,Katie and her husband were awesome hosts! Easy check in and check out. The space was very accommodating and we had a very relaxing visit to Seattle. 
7661577,44608905,2015-08-27,37671972,Peter,We had a great experience and would recommend others to stay.
7661577,45442971,2015-09-02,4637778,Jed,"Katie was very accommodating, and the place was clean, comfortable, and just a few blocks from many shops, restaurants, and grocery stores. I wish I could have stayed longer."
7661577,45527126,2015-09-03,42701861,Heather,"Katie was great! She let us in showed us around and left us to do our thing.  The place was great, clean and comfortable.  Excellent location in a great Seattle neighborhood.  Definitely would stay here again! "
7661577,45726561,2015-09-05,23053906,Fada,We're satisfied with the room!! Very good experience!
7661577,47228274,2015-09-16,267242,Dana,"Perfect stay. Great location, clean and lovely apartment, parking permit, friendly host. I highly endorse! Katie is a great communicator and that made the process so smooth. Wish we could have stayed longer. "
7661577,48005494,2015-09-22,12917466,Alison,"Katie's place was just as the photo's depicted - it was a home away from home - very comfortable, quiet and exceptionally clean. Katie  made every effort to meet us on our arrival and familiarise us with the apartment and locale. Katie was always contactable and responsive to any queries we might have. Snacks and drinks and supplies for breakfast were provided. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here. It was close to all shops and restaurants one would need on a visit to Seattle. We came from overseas and used the busses to get around and Katie was very helpful with any additional information needed to get to our destinations. We highly recommend Katie's place to all visitors to Seattle. "
7661577,48299531,2015-09-25,38496858,Allan,Great location that's nearby the university of Washington. An entirely self contained apartment and Katie was very helpful with great communication. 
7661577,48558936,2015-09-27,42324289,Beth,"We had a great time at this location. Katie was a great hostess, meeting us when we arrived and leaving plenty of information and tips for things to do in the area. The apartment was clean and well maintained, with everything you need from a kitchen to laundry. This apartment was very close to the bus stop, making it easy for us to get anywhere we wanted. We would highly recommend this apartment."
7661577,48928388,2015-09-29,33127411,Jacob,We enjoyed a very pleasant stay.  Everything was clean and in good order. Katie went the extra mile to ensure our needs were met!  It was a great overall experience.
7661577,49348574,2015-10-03,43187109,Michael,"It's been our first airbnb experience - and we liked it very much. 
Everything was perfectly arranged, very clean and also fully equiped. Katie was very welcoming and helpful. 
We highly recommend Katie's place. "
7661577,49638192,2015-10-05,42801948,Lisiane,"Katie is an awesome host. You shold stay with her. She made us have the best experience and it was waiting since we arrived @seattle. If I go again probably will stay there.
The neighbourhood is quite calm. It's a little bit dark, but you can deal with it."
7661577,49848531,2015-10-06,31232366,Haya,"We were only here for a night but this basement apartment had everything we needed, including a parking pass for our car! The sofa and queen sized bed were both comfy, the bathroom well stocked with everything you could need, and plenty of space in the living room to hang out, watch a movie or play some board games. I would stay again."
7661577,50757517,2015-10-14,39937050,Jose,"This is a super basement apartment in a really nice neighbourhood, close to a great supermarket, a park and convenient bus routes into the city. We found the apartment neat and clean and very kindly stocked with goodies to eat and drink, which was so convenient after a long flight into Seattle.  My family and I had a great stay and would recommend Katie's home. Thanks "
7661577,55150270,2015-11-28,18068581,Kevin,"Katie was very welcoming during our week long stay in their basement apartment. The place was very clean and comfortable, and was a good private setting. Katie was helpful enough to provide snacks and other foods and beverages when we arrived, and also had some clear guides of the neighborhood and hot spots around town. The neighborhood itself was very nice, with people and families taking walks around in the morning and afternoon, and parking was always accessible close to the house. Katie is really great with responding to questions as well, giving immediate answers. 

We very much enjoyed our stay with Katie, and highly recommend this location for anyone looking for a comfortable stay, nice neighborhood, and friendly hosts."
7661577,56376913,2015-12-13,40105952,Esa,"An awesome place in a nice neighborhood! Easy to find, clear instructions on how to get in and info on nearby restaurants and cafes. Quick communication, 5/5 would stay again, we especially loved the board games!"
7661577,57458147,2015-12-26,40859102,Zining,The description was accurate and the place is exactly how it is in the photos! Katie was so nice and responded very quickly to all messages and requests. A+++++++!!!!!!!!
7661577,57936195,2015-12-30,15100923,Paul,"Accommodations were great, Katie was very responsive. Location was close to everything we wanted to do. Walking distance to a Whole Foods made getting groceries easy. Would stay here again in a heartbeat. "
937370,9010709,2013-12-01,9965461,Debbie,"My husband and I, my mother, and my brother shared a 2BR/2BA unit at the Shelby. My brother got one of the roll-away beds. The location was so convenient. We used the kitchen a little. It was a great situation for the 5 of us. We were very comfortable. And the parking was awesome."
937370,9116419,2013-12-08,9879796,Liz,We had a great experience staying right in the heart of the city. It's a gorgeous and comfy condo. Thank you for making it such a great experience!
937370,14634541,2014-06-23,13958839,Steven,It was a great location and a comfortable rental. 
937370,16918286,2014-08-04,17548142,Tim,"This property is well located and well maintained, and the neighborhood feel is great. One major issue that requires mentioning is we had a warm day and the unit has neither good circulation or good air conditioning. If you are not staying when the weather is warm this will not be an issue for you, but we could not get the unit to cool down. Otherwise it was fine and we would stay again on a cooler day."
937370,19181114,2014-09-07,3826047,Amber,"Condo was great! Great location, in great condition, was perfect for our group. Thank you so much for accommodating us last minute!"
937370,20963979,2014-10-08,21424381,Frank,"Great Unit !!!  Clean and in a great area close to everything we wanted to do in the city.  

I highly recommend renting out this unit.  "
937370,23375689,2014-11-30,246089,Barbara,"Three persons stayed at Belltown and enjoyed the location that is within walking distance of good restaurants, Pike St. Market, etc.
The apartment was spacious with a nice kitchen with dishwasher,
a nice dining table, nice living room, two comfortable bedrooms, and two nice bathrooms.  The beds were very comfortable, but I wished I had had a feather pillow.  It was wonderful to have the washer and dryer available in the unit.  Free parking was included and secure.  In order to help make this experience even better, I offer the following comments.  It would be nice to crack a window for fresh air, but the windows are sealed shut.  There was nuisance activity of several loud individuals on the street corner under our windows from midnight until 6:00 am.  I guess you could be prepared to use white noise to mute the nuisance of their activity.  I would love to have found small hospitality items that are offered in other airbnb properties like laundry soap that is pictured on the wash machine, shower soap in the bathrooms, more than one roll of toilet paper in each bathroom, a box of Kleenex, coffee filters, etc.  We made a grocery run for household amenities, but properties we've visited have offered these amenities.  We liked our visit.  We liked the spaciousness of the unit.  We liked the secure garage parking, and we hope the items I mentioned can be taken as constructive feedback."
937370,23643780,2014-12-07,13535371,Joe,"The condo worked out perfectly for us. It's a great location and everything went very smooth. Host was responsive and helpful, everything was clean, neat, and accurately represent. Very pleased!"
937370,26614594,2015-02-16,155836,Stacy,"This was a beautiful space and a great location, close to all the major destinations in downtown Seattle. The whole stay was seamless and smooth. Very much enjoyed staying at the Shelby!"
937370,26830050,2015-02-20,18126959,Elisabeth,"Our stay in ""The Shelby"" was lovely. The apartment is located extremely downtown and it is about 10-15 minutes walking distance to the Public Market and also to the Space Needle so for a short sightseeing-trip the location is perfect. Although it is a little bit loud, as it's next to the heavily trafficked 4th avenue. 

The apartment is beautiful and well equipped. The beds are very comfortable and the bathrooms nice and clean. The kitchen is well equipped and the living area is also very nice. The apartment is a really nice place, even though I have to add that there are slight differences to the pictures as for example there are stains on the toilet seat or scratches on the wall and on the table, but as mentioned those are just minor blemishes. 

The communication was easy and all questions got answered really quick and the staff of Stay Alfred was very friendly and helpful. However, I want to mention that if you are looking for a ""real AirBnB experience"" this is probably not your first choice, as it's completely anonymous, without any personal contact and all the communication gets organized throughout the agency Stay Alfred and therefore it's more like a stay in a Suite Hotel. 

Two improvement points, which I would like to mention: 
-) The check in and check out hours are kind of inconvenient, especially when you are just staying for 2.5 days in the city and want to see as much as possible. It would be great if there is a possibility to store the luggage somewhere else in the mean time. We could enter the apartment not before 3 and had to leave at 11 - without any flexibility. 
-) We could not use the WIFI for the first day, because the Code was in the App (which needed internet to access) and as none of us has an American phone, the WIFI code was not accessible. Therefore it would be nice if the code is already included in the apartment description. "
937370,27481361,2015-03-05,18599336,Stefan,"Great place, well described"
937370,27939403,2015-03-15,13839732,Stephanie,"This was a fantastic rental. The location could not have been better. It was clean and comfortable, even the couch bed. It was very easy to get in, and the host was easy to contact had I needed to. I would stay again if I return!"
937370,30944736,2015-04-29,30558365,Chris,"Nice place, close to many attractions.  Good location.  lots of activity in the evening on the street (homeless), so be prepared for that.  Overall a good stay at a reasonable price."
937370,31081782,2015-05-01,31697178,Chris,"This apartment was really nice and in a great location. We did a bunch of walking as it was closer to the space needle and pike place market than we expected. The window in the bedroom was a pain to close but that is probably my only complaint. This was my first AirBnb experience and it was a good one. Check-in was super easy, as they email you directions on how to get in the building and unlock the keybox. No human interaction, which is fine, but not quite the standard airbnb experience. Don't take that as a negative, just a heads up. If something were to happen in the apartment, or you have some questions about the area its nice having someone a little more accessible. Again not really a negative, as we were able to take care of our only issue ourselves. (That window) The three of us definitely enjoyed the place. Comfy beds, modern feel, great location and I will definitely consider this location again. Highly recommended."
937370,31971176,2015-05-12,31492520,Lauren,We had a great time and the location was just perfect. We will totally come back.
937370,32706063,2015-05-20,19908701,Kate,Host was very informative and gave great directions. The place was clean and in a great spot!
937370,33389129,2015-05-27,32536797,Tom,"Very organized registration process and great communication before check-in.  Checked in on Memorial Day, when I called Stay Alfred to buzz us in the front door was put on hold and the door system hung up.  Happened twice.  Luckily a resident let me in, and the rest went smooth.  The unit is nice, good location, and well appointed.  Has cable TV and wifi, which were very nice to have.  Only big complaint is the noise: the unit is on the 2nd floor in the corner of the building at a noisy city intersection, and the windows do next to nothing to block the noise.  We all woke up during the first night thinking we needed to close the bedroom windows, but they were closed. "
937370,33813793,2015-06-01,1750769,Gill,"The apartment was what we expected. Neighbourhood was great, very convenient. We arrived late and it was very hot. No fans. These were delivered late the next day. The TV was impossible to program without instructions which were nowhere to be found. One of the toilets' handles was a bit tricky and kept the toilet flushing until fiddled with. The blinds need replacing. Altogether maybe better housekeeping would solve all the problems. The beds and pillows were great!"
937370,37346709,2015-07-06,30946001,Emily,"This was our first time using airbnb and we had a really great experience. The check in instructions were clear and simple, making the process very easy and stress free. The host responded quickly and they also left a binder of info in the apartment containing check out instructions and the address of many different areas of interest around the city which I appreciated. They have their own app which is convenient though I did not use it that much since all important instructions could be found in the email or binder. The location is great, we were able to walk to all the places we wanted to go to. Overall very good first experience with airbnb."
937370,42675348,2015-08-15,34179931,Linda,"Roomy, comfortable and ideally located near Pike's Place,the Stadium,and numerous restaurants and entertainment locations. "
937370,44422749,2015-08-26,19711932,Ankit,"The neighborhood is great - very close to Pike's place market and to the space needle. I would say walking distance from both. 
The apartment itself is nice - simply furnished and functional. The only down side is that there is a fire station close by with frequent sirens at night. And the seagulls early morning! 
The apartment has a small gym as well. "
937370,48174416,2015-09-24,38464905,Marvin,Great accommodations and location.  Nearby restaurants and grocery along with parking garage were a real plus.  We could walk to Pikes Market and the Space Needle. Building staff were helpful with directions and information.  An enjoyable and cost effective way to spend a few days in Seattle. 
937370,50638108,2015-10-13,7860565,Joyce,The apartment was very well equipt with all the necessities. The apartment was very clean with comfortable sheets and towels.  the mattresses were great - good night sleep!  I would recommend this option over a hotel room.  It was so nice having a comfortable home base for our trip to Seattle.   
937370,51277492,2015-10-19,39659949,Ann,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and renting from Stay Alfred (SA).  Jordan was great helping me decide which property to select based on our needs, and the building was in the perfect walking location for our entire stay (having parking included was a bonus!)  The one drawback, which had no reflection on SA or Jordan, was the level of noise in the unit.  The builders did not use a high quality of windows so the unit was extremely noisy and we could hear people walking by along with all the traffic so if you are a light sleeper this unit may not be the one for you.  But the next time I go back to Seattle I would definitely consider staying at one of Jordan's properties."
937370,54882839,2015-11-25,5187736,Ann,"The check in at the door was seamless but the cleaning staff was still there when we got upstairs, they had been told no one was checking in that day.  By the time we had parked the car in the parking garage they were ready to leave.  It took longer to park the garage as the ""fob"" provided did not work so one of us had to get out, use the ""people door"" entrance, manually open the door.  Not a huge thing but should check those periodically."
937370,56275318,2015-12-11,8681488,Bridget & Matt,Check-in process was smooth and Jordan was very responsive. We had a slight hiccup with the cable but was immediately taken care of with one call. The listing was as described and is located in a great area where shops and restaurants are easily within walking distance. 
937370,57316070,2015-12-24,39307866,Phyllis,"very nice neighborhood. Walking distance to many downtown attractions and restaurants. Very clean and spacious. Surprisingly view of space needle from the window, like it very much!!"
7763298,42482073,2015-08-13,40830361,Peter,Jennifer was very welcoming and responsive. I arrived a bit late and was kindly greeted by her. She was kind enough to let me check out later than the scheduled checkout time. The room was very spacious and clean with a balcony. There are two nearby rooms with guests coming in and out occasionally but overall it is quiet. Would recommend to others.
7763298,42968714,2015-08-16,40832604,Tammie,"Jennifer met us at the door when we arrived, was very friendly, gave us the keys and showed us to our room.  The room was amazing for the price: very spacious, comfortable beds, nice little balcony, large bathroom.  Everything was very clean and there was bottled water left for us.  Apparently, we could have used the kitchen if we wanted, but we really were only there to sleep.  I think we would have had to walk through the family's living area in order to use the kitchen, which may have been a little awkward.  Unlike a hotel, there is a no shoe and no food rule while staying there.  This makes it a little inconvenient, but I'm sure it helps with wear and tear.  There is also no TV, so bring your own entertainment if that matters to you.  The street is very narrow and parking was a little tricky our second night because the car parked in front of us didn't leave a lot of room, so we ended up having to park in front of the gate, which didn't leave a lot of room between the car and the gate.  The house is in a convenient location, just off of I-5 and only about 7 miles from downtown Seattle.  Overall, this is a great place to stay, especially for the price.  I would definitely stay here again:)"
7763298,45352415,2015-09-01,6727396,Memo,"Very straight forward, the room we stayed in has all general amenities such as shampoo and toothpaste and if u forgot they supply towel, also clean and tidy.  If u need to stay in a private room with convenient access this place is a pretty good one."
7763298,45632555,2015-09-04,13613877,Gilbert,It was nice and easy to stay there...using the washing machine n check-in at any time helped us a lot
7763298,45860902,2015-09-06,40548611,Andrey,Fantastic place to stay! Jennifer always replied immediately and was very welcoming. The place was exactly as described. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone staying in the Seattle area!
7763298,46795895,2015-09-13,43023890,Kevin,"Everything and everyone seemed very open and welcoming.  The room was very cozy and a ton of space for any luggage and moving around.  I enjoyed my stay for sure.
Only about 5-10 from inner Seattle. Then, being out of Seattle little more, it was easier to drive around in a new area along with getting out to attractions outside of the city.
The only downside was needing to do street parking a few days, just because of the amount of people staying at the time.  The street parking is a bit precarious; a bigger car would have made it difficult to street park near the apt."
7763298,47084203,2015-09-15,42351756,Karla,"We (two couples) enjoyed our two-night stay very much! The room is VERY spacious with a lot of natural lighting and a lovely balcony with a table and two chairs. We never actually met Jennifer but we did met her daughter, 9-year-old Cindy, who was just a wonderful little host! She showed us around the whole house, told us the house rules (VERY reasonable: no shoes inside the house, no eating in the bedroom but you can use the kitchen/dining room, and quiet time after 10:30 pm), and handed us the key... she was so adorable! Don't be alarmed, she was under the care of a lady but she mainly stayed in the kitchen and didn't speak much English so Cindy ran the show :) 

Jennifer had left water bottles and indoor sandals for us in the room. I texted her to see if she had an iron and it appeared at our doorstep when we got home later that day (along with an ironing board). The bathroom was equipped with a hair dryer, shampoo, body wash, toothpaste, four towels, and four glasses. There's a HUGE walk-in closet and another smaller closet in the bathroom as well. I also texted Jennifer the day of our check-out to see if we could leave our luggage there so we wouldn't have to haul it around town with us and she was very accommodating and allowed us to leave it in her living room until later that day. 

LOCATION: we found it to be very convenient, right off the i-5 and a short 15-20 min drive from downtown attractions (depending on the time and where you're going). Not having to worry about crossing downtown on our way back to the airport when we left was a plus too since this is on the Southern side of Seattle. The streets don't have sidewalks and are narrow so you sort of have to park your car either close to the bushes across the street or on top of where the side-walk would be right in front of their gate. No parking in the driveway is allowed. It honestly wasn't bad at all though. "
7763298,48748447,2015-09-28,38207655,Sridevi,"
Thanks for having us. It is good."
7763298,49246318,2015-10-02,43295063,Stephen,"Jennifer's place was very nice, clean and spacious. Han and I felt welcomed and very comfortable there. It was close to the bus line and access to the kitchen and laundry were convenient. Thank you!!"
7763298,50193700,2015-10-10,42881644,Mac,房东没有见到，一切自助，房间大而宽敞，浴室干净，出门也比较方便。性价比较高。
7763298,50666080,2015-10-13,18331636,Silvia,We got to meet with Jennifer's cute daughter. The room is really clean and has a nice view. I love it. I go Seattle pretty often. Will definitely stay here again. 
7763298,52230116,2015-10-27,42947013,Amelia,"The house and neighborhood were exactly as described! We were greeted by a young girl while trying to open the key box. Other than that we didn't have a lot of in person meetings with anyone from the house. The room was clean and home-like. The room was also very spacious and comfortable for 4 people, or even more to stay in. The bathroom was also clean and very nice with two sinks, perfect for our group. There was also a spacious closet and balcony!"
7763298,52945587,2015-11-02,6343594,Victor,"I would definitely recommend this place for a small group of individuals looking to visit that area of Seattle. Jennifer is very responsive once you make your booking. The private room was just as nice as some hotels. A well decorated, spacious, colorful room with all the items you need to relax."

7763298,56320343,2015-12-12,14573163,Kacey,"Jennifer's place is very clean and cozy, we had a good time staying there. Jennifer is very thoughtful even tho we never had the chance to meet her. There were bottle waters  in the room for the guest, blow dryer in the bathroom drawer (which is very awesome!!) Thank you Jennifer!  "

7763298,57371308,2015-12-25,47031798,Candy,The host is very helpful with our questions and requests. The place is big and clean and it is only 15 minutes away to downtown. I will definitely go back if I visit Seattle again in the future.

1897000,16258469,2014-07-24,16853201,Kelly,This was my first airbnb experience and Jake made it super easy.  The location is great and his place is perfect for just crashing out after a day of pounding the pavement and taking in the local scene.  If I come back to Seattle I'll definitely be making this my home base if Jake will have me!
1897000,17585128,2014-08-14,12879216,Kerry,I really enjoyed my stay at Jake's place! It's in a fun neighborhood and as advertised on his posting. Jake is incredibly helpful and very easy to get a hold of for check in and check out. Don't hesitate in booking this apartment!!!

13068,2670493,2012-10-21,3409335,Romain,"Our research group was looking for a shared accomodation during our conference in Seattle. This house was just the best way to host every individual in a comfortable way, with a balanced mix of private areas (e.g. bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.) and shared spaces (e.g. kitchen, living room,  patio, etc.). Its hillside location in a quiet neighborhood made our stay very pleasant. Meanwhile, supermarkets, bars, restaurant are only a couple of blocks away. The city centre is only 15min walk (this is the time we had to walk every day for our conference).

It was just the perfect house for us (i.e. business travelers) and it would also perfectly accomodate families and friends. The host was very responsive and answered to all of our inquiries. We had a very nice welcome during our check in (with a detailed introduction on all the house facilities!).

We wish there were houses and hosts like that in every single city of the world :)"
13068,3030763,2012-12-05,3836479,Kirstin,It was great to stay at Christopher's house - we all enjoyed it a lot. We were 10 people in total and it worked fine. The highlight was definitely to sit outside in the hot tub enjoying the view. Thank you so much!
13068,3217309,2013-01-02,622154,Max,"The place was so great! I stayed here with a bunch of friends from out of town for New Years and it was everything we could have asked for. Plenty of space to sleep 10, great kitchen for cooking, and a hot tub that made for the perfect place to relax. The place is right in Capitol Hill, so there are tons of great restaurants and bars within walking distance, as well."
13068,3592419,2013-02-20,2027464,Nancy,"For anyone wanting to house a small group of folks in Seattle, you should check out this house!  We had an extended family in town for a wedding weekend, and the house not only slept us all, but served as a gathering-place for other friends and families who came to town for the event.  The only issue at all involved parking locations for these ""drop-in guests,"" and we handled this issue by finding a web site which provided maps of the closest parking lots in the neighborhood and distributing this to all.  
The house itself is spacious, well-maintained, and casual.  We found it easy to handle the door code and security system, and had no problems with safety issues. We were within walking distance to any needs we had, and the freeways were quite accessible. The upstairs shower was a complete hit, as was the hot tub on the back deck. We had a couple questions during our stay, and Chris got back to me immediately and cheerfully on both of them. If I had a small group planning a Seattle trip again, I would definitely try to stay at this house."
13068,3834161,2013-03-19,4930870,Miriam,"My friends and I had a great time at the Oasis. There were 5 of us and we were beyond comfortable. The hot tub was a gem, the shower was incredible, and the kitchen was fabulous. Great location and perfect space for an unofficial high school reunion. We loved the community dining/lounging area."
13068,4243032,2013-04-22,4725848,Jasmine,"We had a great stay at the Oasis! We were a group of 7, so we definitely fit comfortably (only sharing the king bed). More people could certainly fit.

Checkout was a breeze - the owners provided a great checklist that was easy to follow. After splitting up the tasks, it only took us a few minutes to get the house ready for checkout.

Our group was attending a conference at the Washington Convention Center; the conference site was only a short walk from the house (10-15 minutes). There are lots of great cafes nearby, and plenty of great places to eat (Molly Moon's for ice cream, Tacos Chukis for great/cheap tacos). The information book provided also had many restaurant recommendations. The house also had a nicely stocked kitchen and grill if you're interested in cooking (Melrose Market nearby has a great-looking meat shop).

The hot tub was especially useful for post-conference relaxation. If you're a crossfitter interested in a workout on your trip, we checked out Foundations Crossfit (also a 10-15 minute walk) and got in a great workout!"
13068,10448004,2014-02-19,5075645,Tess,"This place is true to what it says unlike a lot of Airbnbs!

The place was spotless and very homey. The kitchen is amazing and so is the back patio. The beds were comfortable and the sheets and towels new.

Wifi was fast which was great. I was there for a charity and had 7 other people staying with me and we were very comfortable. 

This isn't mentioning the location which is just where you want to be. I was in walking distance to everything on the hill and downtown. What a treat!

Next time I am in Seattle, I will plan on staying here again.

Greatly appreciated all around."
13068,10847283,2014-03-10,12098994,Asha,"The house is amazing and the location is great too. However, the parking is very badly organized. It's at a hidden spot and no one can find it without getting direction on the phone. When we called Chris, the owner, he was very rude to us, and said that he is catching a plane and he cant' give us directions until we are around the house. The other woman Tina, and her co-worker women at Seattle were helpful, and they ensured we find the parking. Chris should be more polite to people who are giving him business. 
Additionally, the hot tub wasnt working. The water didnt get heated and we couldnt use it inspite of paying for it. We looked for directions everywhere but couldn;t bring it to work. "
13068,11173089,2014-03-24,6488419,Jeff,"This was a perfect place to share with 6 friends while we were in town for a conference. Walking distance to downtown, but also far enough away that we could take advantage of being in a different neighborhood and retreat. The hot tub was an especially nice bonus to come back to. Would definitely recommend for a group such as ourselves."
13068,12641363,2014-05-06,14339598,Leah,Where else can you be in a house in the heart of a city?  Nowhere!  Great place for a group that wants to hang out.
13068,14013863,2014-06-10,7109907,Cameron,We had a great experience. The location is PERFECT. You can get everywhere in the city on foot or for a very cheap cab ride. The house is very charming and Chris was very responsive when we needed to contact him. I would definitely stay here again.
13068,15652050,2014-07-13,7110547,Alex,"Chris place was perfect for what we needed. 
Spacious, great patio with a BBQ.
Few steps from downtown, in quite neighbourhood.
Would definitely be back!"

13068,19823033,2014-09-19,18891174,Shivin,"The Oasis is a great place for anyone to stay at while in Seattle. The neighborhood is very nice and quiet and the house is just as described in the property listing, actually better and more comfortable than it seems in the photographs. This is a big house and the cleaning staff did a great job of making the place sparking clean for us. There was plenty of room for everyone and overall the facilities provided in the house were great. There was some basic food/coffee/spices and dishes to work with, which was very nice. Chris was a great host and was almost always available on phone/text. Most of our questions were answered immediately and everything was neatly put down in the handy house manual for quick reference. Chris was also kind enough to point us to a number of nearby eateries and coffee/tea shops. 

Overall, this was a fantastic experience for a lively group of grad students.  The house exceeded our expectations and I would highly recommend this property to anyone who is travelling in a small/medium group and needs a comfy, convenient place to make camp. There are several stores and restaurants nearby so that is also a big plus. We look forward to staying at the Oasis again on our next visit!"
13068,22100213,2014-10-30,19240440,Joseph,"It was odd working with a company that works doesn't completely clarify that it is a separate entity from AirBnB and requires agreement to a separate contract. 

Other than that - the property was amazing and in an excellent location! The property manager was very friendly and the check-in/out process streamlined. We enjoyed our stay very much and highly recommend to other. "
13068,22578513,2014-11-10,8501923,Jay,"Great neighborhood, very accessible to the popular parts of Seattle. 
House had great character, a great backyard area, and was fun for our entire group.

Thanks Chris!"
13068,23428995,2014-12-01,475119,Chetan,"The urban oasis is in a great location in seattle, incredibly easy to get downtown, and in capitol hill which is a very neighborhoody place. I especially loved morning trips to Analog Cafe, two blocks away, which has amazing coffee. The giant custom texas shaped table was perfect for thanksgiving as well. "
13068,26353744,2015-02-10,5075645,Tess,"This is the second time I have stayed at the oasis. I LOVE IT. Location is perfect, the house is super clean, the beds are so comfy (which is a sad but true rarity for most airbnbs I feel).

And the serivce was amazing. When I arrived this this trip the hot tub hot recently been cleaning and drained. When I arrived the tub was not very warm. After sending an assistant over to take a look and still no increase in temp, they sent over a professional technician who fixed it immediately. They didn't have to go through such efforts-- on a sunday no less!-- but they did. A great house and totally worth the price."

13068,30444809,2015-04-22,27503612,Martine,"This house was amazing. The host cleaned the house and left the lights on for us, it was walking distance to the Convention Center and Capital Hill restaurants and pubs, the shower is amazing.  The house is fully stocked with essentials and basics for cooking.  Perfect for a group.  House rules are very well laid out and property managers were responsive and friendly."
13068,31590808,2015-05-07,30807792,Zhenzheng,"We had a wonderful experience in this house. The house has enough space and nice environment. The location is very convenient, nearby space needle. Thus, it was a good decision to live here."

13068,48671485,2015-09-28,20236341,Marcie,Lovely home. Tons of character. Fabulous location. Walking distance to all the sites and great nightlife.  Only comment would be it is an old home and the windows are very drafty and you can hear a lot of the outside noise. All part of the homes character. 
13068,56587504,2015-12-15,39894649,Maria,It was a nice property with all amenities.  My family did not expect such a cosy ambience.  Highly recommend it for family reunion or gathering.  Will rent this property again next time.  Except infecting- could not find a jug to boil water as our custom is we like to have a cup of chinese tea or English tea in the morning so we had to boil water in a saucepan several times a day.
8441477,48810474,2015-09-28,27054623,Jeff,"We just spent a delightful 3 nights in Rebecca's home. It was wonderful. The beds were comfy, the linens were even better than ours at home. The home itself is beautiful and very well maintained.  Everything worked. Rebecca and her husband Nick are great hosts.  We walked to a great bakery, they sent us to a wonderful Italian restaurant for dinner one night in a nearby neighborhood, and they left us with coffee, chocolate and red wine. What more can you ask?  The large screen tv with HBO and reliable wifi were also big pluses. As were the showers with great water pressure and temperature. We have had mixed experiences over the years when renting someone's home but this house is special and so are the hosts. We give this our highest rating. "
8441477,49842127,2015-10-06,44940133,Jeff,"Our family had a wonderful time.  The house was super cozy, very clean, had everything that we needed for a full family to live, cook, hang out, and have a relaxing stay.  Rebecca was absolutely amazing and helpful.  So nice, that we extended our stay.  The location is also great.  We walked to dinner, coffee, and shakes/ice cream in this great neighborhood."
8441477,50392231,2015-10-11,44940133,Jeff,"So nice, we stayed twice!  We were transitioning from selling a home and needed a spot.  This house had everything we needed as a family, was amazing."
8441477,51580095,2015-10-21,4349175,Erin,"This house is great! We really enjoyed our time!
Rebecca is a great host! She was very quick to respond after I expressed interest in booking it for 4 nights in October. She was extremely flexible and very sweet. She even met us at the house to go over things. 
The house has been completely renovated. Everything was done top notch. It's an older house which we loved because it has such great character, but has been redone, so it felt really new because of the renovation and style of furniture.
The house is very comfortable, plenty of space. I stayed with my husband and a couple co-workers. Everyone got their own room so it worked out really well. We stayed in the master bedroom and it was super comfortable. The bed was amazing!
The house was furnished with everything we needed (and then some).
The location is perfect! It's right off a busy and fun street, so everything is within walking distance. We normally stay in Ballard, but we were very pleasantly surprised by all the great options for food, etc.  The area is a perfect place to get a feel for what it would be like to live in Seattle because it was in a residential area, and it was super safe and a really nice area. But it was right off Greenwood Ave so it was nice to walk to things.
Greenlake Park is very close too. We walked there a few mornings and even walked around the entire lake!
We would rent this again in a heart beat. You can't beat the price for a 3 bedroom, spacious house with a backyard!
Rebecca definitely takes pride in her house and you can tell. She has added some really nice touches like a bottle of wine when you arrive, shampoo, etc so you really get the amenities of a hotel. Plus, I really liked that you didn't have to clean the sheets, etc like some other rental properties.
Can't wait to visit again!
Thanks Rebecca for a great stay in Seattle!"
8441477,53191334,2015-11-06,46225249,Ian,"It was a pleasure to stay at Rebecca's home for two weeks in North Seattle. The home has been beautifully remolded and modernized with plenty of room for our whole family and everything we needed to move in, cook, have fun, and explore the walk able neighborhood. Rebecca made us feel very welcome and even brought over candy to hand out to trick or treaters. Would stay here again!"
8441477,53558462,2015-11-09,47941842,Dani,"Rebecca was extremely accommodating to me, my husband and my one year old son. She was easy to communicate with and made our stay so comfortable by providing all the essentials for our baby! The pack and play was perfect and we loved the high chair so much we are going to buy one. Rebecca was very flexible with the check-out time which made our stay in Seattle very relaxing. The TVs were an added bonus, as we don't have TV in our house. Felt very much like a vacation! We plan on staying in this awesome, newly renovated house again!"
8441477,54382661,2015-11-19,45560173,Amanda,"This is an amazingly beautiful and comfortable home and Rebecca was an awesome and attentive host. She welcomed us with a bottle of wine and chocolate and was responsive and super helpful the entire time before and during our stay. The home is lovingly restored with gorgeous bathrooms, a wonderful kitchen, and big comfy beds! It is in a great location, just a few minutes drive to just about everything you'd want in Seattle. Phinney Ridge is a cute little neighborhood too, with close proximity to food markets and restaurants. The home has great space and she was incredibly accommodating for our baby, providing a pac n play, car seat and high chair. We especially loved turning on the fireplace and congregating in the living area. I would definitely come back to this home in Seattle and rent again from Rebecca. We thank you so much for making our family gathering that much more enjoyable! "
8441477,55107270,2015-11-28,30507968,Aubrey,"Rebecca's home was in the perfect location and was great for getting the whole family (or a group of friends all together.)  We all loved the historical aspect of the home and the neighborhood.  Rebecca made us feel very welcome and the home had everything we needed to feel comfortable--Plus, it was great to have a full kitchen to prepare meals.  My family and I will definitely be staying at this beautiful bungalow every time we visit Seattle!"
8441477,55414071,2015-12-01,49214770,Kome,"Rebecca was very polite. She gave me pointers and a heads up on how things worked, especially with the house being somewhat genuinely old. The neighborhood was great! People around us were courteous and had the holiday spirit. "
8441477,56105877,2015-12-08,47797710,Arlea,"My family and I stayed at Rebecca's place for 5 nights. We immediately felt right at home. There were 7 of us and we had more than enough space for each person to sleep comfortably. The house is fully stocked with anything you might need--A full kitchen, 2 bathrooms with all body care products provided, emergency kits. She welcomed us with a local bottle of wine and chocolate. The area is a very cute/charming with lots of little coffee shops and bars.  The road it is on is very narrow as are many of the streets in that neighborhood, but thankfully, there is a very long driveway so parking is not a problem.  Unfortunately, we didn't get to meet Rebecca in person but she was very responsive to messages and more than willing to answer any questions at any time and even stop by if we needed anything.  She was also very flexible with the check out time. All in all, there is nothing id change about our stay. My family and I all agreed we would stay there every time we came back to Seattle.  "
8441477,57002938,2015-12-21,20066544,Jennifer,"Great location, helpful host, beautiful house with all the amenities one could desire.
Walking distance to stores and supermarket.  "
8441477,57880769,2015-12-30,3661325,Carol,"Our family had a wonderful Christmas experience.  The house was well furnished and comfortable.  The old home had character and charm and was beautifully upgraded with all the amenities you need while traveling.  The kitchen was well equipped for cooking, the fireplace was lovely, and the beds were super comfy.  Rebecca was friendly and showed us around.  All-in-all it was a super experience for us.  "
6343866,34981494,2015-06-14,23152302,Margaret,Tobin was very welcoming and eager to assist us as we were his first guests. The basement apartment was freshly painted and the bedrooms are large with plenty of storage. The beds are very comfortable and the bathroom had all you need-lots of hot water. And the washer and drier are fabulous -great for the traveller. It is close the city and a bus ride 2 blocks from the apartment.bthe neighbourhood is green leafy and trendy. There are some interesting restaurants down the street too.
6343866,36606605,2015-06-29,6122305,Kristin,"Easy access to Seattle! For couples or small families looking for a place to stay while visiting Seattle, consider Wallingford. Parking on the street was easy and free and not limited. We used the bus system or Uber to travel and we walked a lot. We visited downtown, Bainbridge Island, Capitol Hill, Seattle Center and Ballard from Wallingford. The bus stop was 3 blocks and we bought a single pass for the whole family at the QFC (grocery store) right by the bus stop. 

We were really happy with this AirBnb. It is very clean, new, roomy, and thoughtfully arranged. Although it lacks a kitchen, it does have laundry. The apartment was nice and cool despite record breaking temps in Seattle. (It has AC.)  We enjoyed our host and his raspberries and chickens. The neighborhood was a delight. There is a multitude of great restaurants and coffeeshops and neighbors. We even helped a couple move in across the street! This place was a hidden gem. I loved staying there and because of AirBnB we discovered a wonderful new area of Seattle.  Thanks, Tobin!"
6343866,38857900,2015-07-19,26920913,Rosemarie,"The apartment is in pristine condition and suited our small family very well. Its in a really great location- friendly neighbours and a playground, restaurants, stores and ice cream a short walk away. There is no kitchen for cooking, but the fridge and microwave and coffee machine are very handy. The laundry is also great to have. Tobin was friendly and attentive throughout our stay. The kids loved his chickens and got a real kick out of counting eggs each morning :)"
6343866,39655488,2015-07-25,6254020,Mona,"Tobin's basement apartment was bright, spacious, clean and comfortable.  It didn't really feel like a basement at all.  It had everything we needed. The washer and dryer were new, worked perfectly and were helpful to us at this stage of our travels.  The beds were extremely comfortable, as was the extra large sofa in the living room.  We didn't use the  TV.  The internet worked perfectly. Parking was never a problem and the location could not have been better for what we were looking for. We loved nearby Green Lake, the neighborhoods of Ballard and Fremont and Wallingford too."
6343866,40934885,2015-08-03,36284610,Mary,"This place was a perfect setting for our Seattle stay - centrally located, quiet neighborhood, and very cozy apartment. It was just as described, clean and well-furnished, spacious enough for our party of four adults. We'd come back in a minute!"
6343866,41751766,2015-08-09,4517797,Kristin,"This place is fantastic! Beautiful, convenient neighborhood, wonderfully friendly host and super comfortable accommodations. Tobin was very easy to communicate with and helpful with suggestions of places to eat and visit that you won't find in a guidebook or on Yelp. The unit is fresh, clean and new, beds are comfortable and its quiet! I stayed here with my two kids age 16 and 20 and we had a great time exploring Green Lake, Washington Park, UofW, Wallingford, Fremont (all walking distance) plus its easy to get downtown or over to Ballard via public transportation. There is an amazing farmers market one block away on Wednesdays and many others close by on other days of the week. This is one of my favorite AirBnB's yet!"
6343866,45493172,2015-09-03,40525537,Teresita,"Great conditions, no complaints. "
6343866,46954802,2015-09-14,3554126,Ahmed,"I have to say that this was one of the best airbnb experiences I've ever had.  Firstly, the location is excellent!  Walking distance to the house are a plethora of restaurants, coffeehouses, shops, etc.  Very safe area.  Make sure you walk to Molly Milk ice cream to try their various flavors.  Its under 15 min drive to downtown where all the ""touristy"" spots are.  Walking distance to Fremont neighborhood which has a hip and eclectic vibe to it.  The house itself was exactly as described in the pictures.  What made this so great was Tobin's attention to detail in preparing the apartment for guests.  He has a book which lays out everything you would want to know about the stay, wifi issues, nearby things, etc.  A wonderful guide!  The beddings, bathroom, furnishings, and everything was clean and tastefully decorated (down to the small details like door knobs and bathtub tile).  Due to its separate entrance, you have your utmost security and privacy.  A nice washer and dryer were present as well, along with coffee, electric tea pot, etc.  Very well supplied in terms of amenities and accessories.  I should add that you will hear steps occasionally of people walking upstairs, and a little bit of the backyard chickens in the morning, but it was nothing significant or bothersome.  The host was very communicative; check in and check out were smooth.  Overall, this was an excellent stay.  "
6343866,48102795,2015-09-23,23117653,Israel,Great little apartment in a great little neighborhood. Quick and easy access to most major roads and many Seattle attractions.
6343866,48777696,2015-09-28,42082468,Simon,Great location near U district. Within walking distances of restaurants/bars/grocery stores. Tobin's home is nice and sleeps 5 comfortably. Our group was in town for the Udub-cal game and the home was a short uber ride away from campus. 
7368030,41436843,2015-08-07,38262666,Larry,"My week-long stay at Megan's  apt. was a convenient and affordable choice for my week's visit to the University of Washington. I left my car in the small parking lot the entire week and walked to campus each day. The immediate neighborhood is full of dining options and shopping distractions, and the QFC grocery across the street came in very handy. The apt. was very clean and tidy, but it took me awhile to sleep through the street noise and lights.  Communication from Megan was prompt and helpful. "
1652097,14628021,2014-06-23,15777036,David,"My wife and I were looking for a fun place to stay for our staycation in Seattle on our anniversary.  Pam's place is very cozy and secluded; excellent for a getaway!  Once you get inside it's as if the rest of the world doesn't exist.  There is minimal lighting, and only 1 small window, but for this location I think that it works well!  Pam's place was clean and welcoming, with excellent instructions left for us to handle any questions we might have.  She worked with us to make sure we could find the location easily, and provided ample time for us to check in and out.

We highly recommend this spot if you are looking for a romantic, cozy hideaway in the heart of Seattle!"
1652097,16212357,2014-07-23,5696859,Walter,"This place is very cozy but Pamela is super accommodating. It was a nice experience and there are even some fantastic restaurants nearby (Ravish, Little Water Cantina)."
1652097,16788406,2014-08-02,16763071,Justin,"My stay at Pam's apt was very nice, the apt was clean, organized and got everything we needed (clean towels, essentials, a fridge, kitchenwares) upon our arrival. Outside the place was the beautiful view of Lake Union, and it's only a less than 10 mins walk to UW. Although we didn't get the chance to meet with Pam in person, but through all our conversation, she was a very welcoming and warm-hearted person, she stayed up and guided us to her apt at 1 in the morning, throughout the trip, she cared about our comfortability and shared with us a few bonus points of the apt. It was very pleasant staying with Pam, if you were looking for a quiet, secluded place to stay in Seattle, look no further."
1652097,17599053,2014-08-14,19469437,Charlotte,"Working out the details with the host was a very positive experience, even with the technical difficulties, and was greatly appreciated.  Pamela was willing to take the time to work with me and confirm the details of the booking process.  "
1652097,19610989,2014-09-15,14721529,Kim,"Pamela's space was romantic, warm & inviting. She gave us great directions and was easy to communicate with too."
1652097,27163982,2015-02-27,25491097,Linh,"This 's definitely a good place to stay if you like privacy. The studio is cozy, closes to Public transports with many good restaurants nearby.  Internet isn't good enough and kitchen is small but we can manage with that. My family stay for 7 nights in total. Overall, it was a fantastic experience.    "
1652097,32321729,2015-05-17,27897294,子建,"Good room for stay, I have comfortable night."
1652097,35092573,2015-06-15,31862411,Lorena,"Pamela was great. She was flexible and made my stay easy and carefree.  The place really does have all the things you could possibly need for a few nights stay. There were plenty of towels and other amenities. 

The place itself is very unique and small, and clean. There isn't a kitchen area but there is a small area for small prep, when comparing it to a hotel, it was basically the same in that respect. 

It's in a great location in East Lake, close to the water. The apartment is tucked away in an alley and has zero views, very private. "
1652097,37167725,2015-07-05,28348062,Boston,We stayed for a month and it was lovely. Pamela was very accommodating and gracious. There are busses directly outside that go downtown and to Fremont. The water is less than a block away. I would stay there again. 
1652097,39490474,2015-07-24,18360278,Greg,"A pleasant place to stay in a good location. I also found that the apartment was better than I expected from the photos. There is a restaurant less than a block away and a small grocery store within a 5 minute walk or so. Pamela was also quick to reply to any questions.
"
1652097,40094185,2015-07-28,4049255,Sabrina Rowe,Pamela was a very nice and accommodating.  The studio is cozy for a single or couple who wants a quiet little nook. 
1652097,40372209,2015-07-30,38411071,Sarah,"Pamela's Lake Union Tranquil Retreat was exactly that.  Tranquil and thoughtfully decorated to make it a comfortable experience for anyone staying there.  We had a lovely time.  Pamela's warmth and hospitality was apparent at every step of the process, even as we felt completely private.  I highly recommend walking down by the water.  Truly peaceful."
1652097,41928588,2015-08-10,7603678,Alexander,"Pamela was an excellent host! She was very attentive in making sure we got into the studio okay and made sure everything was going well. 

The studio was charming and very relaxing. It's small, but there are no secrets about that in the description and it fit two of us very comfortably. 

Would definitely stay again next time I'm in Seattle!"
1652097,42574973,2015-08-14,38990120,Nick And April,"This was our first time using Air B and B. I first saw her listing as $74/ night but ended up being $100/ night. First time air B and B'er beware. We called Air B and B customer service and was told that listers can change their rates. Not sure if this was overnight or what. But anyways.... Overall the experience was nice. 

Pamela was very accommodating especially as we only had 3 guests on half the stay and did not charge us for additional guests the other days. The neighborhood is very quaint and quiet. Beautiful area near the docks by Lake Union. We only stayed at the place at night and went off around Seattle. 

The place is very clean and had everything that we needed. She is very detailed in her air BnB description and instructions at home. All the photos are accurate. Her place is small and all the walls are draped with only one window that is opaque. She has adequate lighting for her place. 

She is correct about her address is somewhat difficult to get to but leaves good instructions to get to her place. 

She kept good communication with us, especially during our stay making sure we found the extra air mattress and if we got to the place fine. "
1652097,44186083,2015-08-24,33719377,Jon,"Pamela was great. The place was clean and cozy and well-stocked with supplies. Her directions were very clear, which made finding it easy. It was also very conveniently located. Pamela was great at communicating and was clearly an experienced host. All in all, a great experience -- recommended!"
1652097,44616209,2015-08-27,31610161,Molly,Cozy little get away!
1652097,46283202,2015-09-09,16445392,Nancy,"This place is definitely unique. Because all other reviews basically reiterate each other I will point out some other points: comfy bed, living room was big open space, there is definitely thought put into the decor. Things to keep in mind: there is no sink to wash dishes, plenty of pillows but (as I do with all Airbnbs) bring your own pillow. Lighting is limited. There is a cooking area but again also limited. 

There is not much to do in then neighbor but Capitol Hill is only a 15 min bus ride away, and downtown is a fairly easy bike ride 45mins away. Both bike and buses is a 3 min walk. 

I do not think I will stay here again-- though Pamela was very nice and responsive and the space very unique--it was hard to move around, find things, and no sink or washer. The place feels pretty make-shift. Might be good for a night or 2, but we stayed 4 nights."
1652097,46917613,2015-09-14,18311324,Tim,We really enjoyed our stay at Pamela's AirBnB. Very private and cozy location with easy access to downtown via local buses or Uber. Pamela was quick and friendly when responding to any messages. Thanks again Pam!
1652097,50537221,2015-10-12,45240542,Reuben,Pamela thought of everything and was very pleasant to talk to.
1652097,50826359,2015-10-14,39338703,Osha,The host canceled this reservation 10 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1652097,53271359,2015-11-07,41422827,Jim,"Pamela made our first experience with Airbnb a pleasure. The space is exactly as described, and her on-site instructions were very helpful. The place is very clean, and the kitchen and bath amenities were price-appropriate. The neighborhood is largely residential, but only a short walk to coffee shops and restaurants. Public transportation and bike rental are very convenient.  For just two of us, it was a great spot for easy access to UW and its neighborhood."
1652097,56049791,2015-12-08,48530048,Kathy,"We loved our stay and will be recommending this space for our friends and family when they visit Seattle. Everything was as described, BUT we didn't find 4 plastic forks and 1 knife to be enuf flatware....we left some plastic spoons, much better for yogurt and cereal. "
8311242,53796016,2015-11-12,2607068,Ck,"Great location, clean apartment. Thanks for having me, Thomas!"
8311242,54016773,2015-11-15,25971955,Kim,"The location was exceptional, we walked pretty much everywhere.  It was just a couple blocks away from pike place market, directly across the street from Seattle Art Museum with plenty of great shops, cafes and restaurants in the immediate area.  We were their first airbnbers so there were some minor hiccups but nothing that I am sure they will fix before the next people stay.  Thomas was readily available via Airbnb message, was very welcoming and provided great recommendations in the area as well.  The concierge was also pleasant and helpful.  Thank you for having us at your place, would definitely stay there again. "
8311242,55293996,2015-11-29,14337930,Gina,"Thomas was extremely helpful when we checked in. The check in/out process was very smooth and easy. Everything was as expected and the location was perfect for downtown activities. Great view of the sound. We struggled to find an affordable parking situation downtown, so if you're traveling with a car be aware of that. "
8311242,56861813,2015-12-19,4680435,Joe,"Incredibly well-located, comfortable apartment in a great building with easy access. Thomas has created an awesome place to stay in Seattle, perfect for one or two people. Great and clear directions, great communications, what Airbnb should be!"
8311242,57314691,2015-12-24,49751417,Xia,"Great location, great place. perfect."
8311242,57668078,2015-12-28,18168236,Karen,"This apartment is perfect is you want to stay in Downtown Seattle.  It is one block from the rail station, has a great view of the water, and it is only 2 blocks from Pike Place Market.   

The apartment is clean and comfortable. The bed is a little firm for my taste, but I was so tired, it didn't matter.   Parking a car would be difficult, but you really don't need one if you stay here.  I would definitely stay here again."
8311242,57911654,2015-12-30,11248977,Alma,"My husband and I enjoyed staying at Thomas's place. It was clean, had a great view of ocean and ferris wheel. A couple blocks from the market. He was quick to respond and offered helpful recommendations for eating and entertainment. And he allowed us to drop off bags early so we wouldnt be carrying them around. The building was very safe. And liked having washer and dryer in the apartment. Thank you Thomas!"
5056580,29367228,2015-04-06,1259218,Sunny & Tory,"We were Eric's first guest, but he treated us with the highest level of awesome service. He truly made us feel welcome to the space. The accommodation was large and great for anyone who wanted to wind down and relax. The location is great for anyone new and familiar to Seattle, as it was central to get around the city. He was great to converse with and fun to joke around! The unfortunate thing was that we wish we could have stayed longer... We truly made a friend in Seattle. We believe this place is very worth checking out!"
5056580,29476399,2015-04-07,5799576,Nikola,"Eric was a gracious host and made us feel at home. The space is peaceful and private and the surrounding gardens were glorious in their spring bloom. We were pleased with the location, easily accessible while feeling tucked away. It is a tranquil retreat in the city."
5056580,29593116,2015-04-09,21068887,Katy,"Beautiful, super peaceful space. A little tricky to find, so make sure you read the directions on the listing carefully! Eric left plenty of useful information. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
5056580,29647327,2015-04-10,20081840,Ryan,Gorgeous property and space. Very zen and calming. Eric was a very gracious host. Easy access from public transit. I'll opt for his space over a hotel room anytime I'm in the area!
5056580,29705714,2015-04-11,3927977,Bobbi,"The Soaring Crane Luxury Garden Retreat was everything promised and more. The location is extremely convenient, but it is so private and quiet that it feels like you are miles away from the city. The place is beautiful and Eric has obviously put a great deal of effort and thought into designing a place that is inviting and comfortable. Eric was great, and very anxious to provide us with a wonderful experience. We will be back"
5056580,30058724,2015-04-16,7014052,Megan,"I booked Eric's flat for a work colleague travelling in the States. He was very communicative and helpful with information before his arrival, and my colleague had only great things to say about the flat. I wish I could have stayed there myself, but i will be definitely doing so if I eve come to Seattle!
Thanks Eric. "
5056580,30178057,2015-04-18,31228673,Rowena,"This is a really wonderful space, the suite is beautifully renovated and it's a lovely location. It was quiet, we didn't hear anything. Eric was great at communicating the details and was fast responding. The only disappointment was only staying one night. Thanks!
"
5056580,30240420,2015-04-19,30436566,Yuxuan,"Thank you for your lovely home. My girlfriend and I had a really wonderful night. We love the way you decorate your house, especially those dry flowers and pictures. Really love this place and we will come visit again if we are back to Seattle."
5056580,30372260,2015-04-20,31473280,Teri,"The Soaring Crane was our first Airbnb stay, and Eric set the bar at the top his great hospitality, the quality of the setting, and the overall experience! 

This Airbnb rivals any of the luscious and special settings my husband and I have enjoyed at B&B establishments around the world. The experience starts first by discovering the house and studio tucked away at the end of a tiny alley off a cul-de- sac, set amidst flowering vines and a winding trail into the Crane's own bird garden sanctuary.  Take a moment to breath in the peace of this oasis before opening the charming gate to a special world beyond. 

A private garden path leads you through a lush and carefully tended sanctuary, then down a few steps to a the doorway of your tranquil retreat. Take off your shoes, and let yourself be absorbed. 

The space is tastefully minimalist, uncluttered and artistic.  An open foyer leads to a cozy office/dining alcove to the right, to a sitting room ahead, and a bedroom to the left.

The kitchen, just off the comfortable sitting room, is beautifully appointed with full size appliances and almost any crockery and utensil you might need to prepare your own meals or enjoy take out from one of the many local restaurants. There are no food staples except tea, coffee and spices, but we visited a little market just a short walk away for supplies. 

Dining space is offered in the alcove or at a tall table set for two, plus a sweet little back patio -- perfect for an evening glass of wine or morning tea. 

The bath includes a full size tub and shower, with plenty of hot water available. All rooms have their own temperature controls, and the heaters  work quickly. There's not much storage space in the bathroom, but the bedroom is just a few steps away, and there are plenty of shelves and cupboard spaces there .  

The bedroom is, like the whole apartment, decorated in earth tones with a restful, inviting Asian motif throughout. The queen bed is medium firm, the linens are top-quality, and a choice of pillows and additional bedding is available. It's very quiet, and we slept wonderfully.

Our host, Eric Spivack, was amazing. He is clearly interested in making your experience wonderful in any way he can, but not intruding when unneeded. He responded quickly on Airbnb, was on hand to welcome us and give us a tour of the apartment, and to offer suggestions about the neighborhood, transportation, and other amenities. We preferred to stay ""home"" so after we strolled the neighborhood -- which abounds with lovely small houses and very friendly and garden-proud residents -- we took ourselves  back to the Soaring Crane with a picnic! 

Eric even helped us out with a critical errand the next day, which made our trip a complete success.  We feel we have found a lovely new home away from home in Seattle, and a great new friend!"
5056580,30529258,2015-04-23,24233097,Jason,"Eric shows passion in Thai culture, nature, and thoughtfulness in innovation of amenities provided in his home. It is a quiet place to relax and extremely clean. Nice garden to enjoy fresh air right off the patio. Eric was nearby but respected our privacy and attended to anything we needed. We had our own access to and from this full and private space only 20 mins from downtown. He is open to suggestions if you recommend something in the kitchen. He also works massage therapy to which we took advantage of! Very good Beacon Hill market 10 min walk specializes in Asian and Latin cusine.  Highly recommend this place and will be back before you know it ;). Thank you Eric!"
5056580,30814326,2015-04-27,18308491,John,"Eric's garden retreat has ruined AirBnB for us. Nowhere will beat the convenience, friendliness and tranquillity of his Beacon Hill hideaway. Communication was great, Eric was friendly and open but not intrusive and the place itself has to be seen to be believed. This will be the first place I look whenever I come back to the Seattle area. Close to some great coffee shops and restaurants (Eric's recommendations are spot on) and less than 20 mins to downtown via (close by) public transport or car. Highly recommended."
5056580,31263172,2015-05-03,1385605,Ricky,"Eric was a great host. He was understanding and very gracious to us during our stay. His place is immaculately designed and maintained, and really is a gem of a home. It me feel like I was back in a Bali or another part of Asia. Absolutely loved our stay here, and couldn't recommend it more. "
5056580,31501325,2015-05-05,4549806,Cedar,"A beautiful, clean, quiet, and peaceful space. My mom and I really enjoyed staying here. "
5056580,31717774,2015-05-09,30802755,Matthew,"The entire experience was fantastic!  The location is perfect, very accessible by train but tucked away from the main roads for plenty of privacy.  Everything in the retreat was immaculate, from the furnishings to the private porch, to the included teas.  Eric made my girlfriend and I feel very much at home and I would love to stay again when I am back in Seattle."
5056580,31824162,2015-05-10,31817301,Frances,"Absolutely amazing!!! The neighborhood is quiet and beautiful, and the flat is better than most of the five star hotels I've stayed in. It's incredibly well maintained and Eric is a wonderful host. We'll probably come back to Seattle just for staying here again."
5056580,31913065,2015-05-11,18981575,Madison,"Eric was the best host! From contact with him prior to booking, to check out, he was personable and caring. Keyless entry makes checking in a breeze! The inside of the listing is amazing. The absolute prettiest air bnb I have ever stayed in! We kept saying ""I would totally live here!"" We didn't get to stay long, but we definitely plan to go back! "
5056580,32181491,2015-05-15,18778952,Gabi,"What a lovely exquisite place. You really feel and see all the love and work Eric has put into this space.  He has spared no expense, from the fixtures to the linens and the carpeting. We were sadden that we had not booked to stay longer, it really is so peaceful and relaxing there. "
5056580,32221255,2015-05-15,4124592,Katie,"We were really impressed with Soaring Crane. . .it has a luxurious feel to it, is located in very lush natural surroundings, and is very spacious.

It is a very well designed flat, with heating and lighting you can customize to your visit, which was appreciated. . .the bed was quite comfy, and Eric has all sorts of extra blankets and throws that are incredibly soft! We cooked and relaxed and found it a perfect place to stay. Eric was so gracious and welcoming, which just made everything better when we arrived late in the day. Eric had many Seattle area travel books as well as other novels and photo books that are now on my wish list, perfect. Lots of tea, coffee, dishes and all you need for a very easy stay, including this excellent smelling shampoo and body wash that is supplied in the shower. 

As usual, wanted to stay longer and probably would have moved in if encouraged. . .thanks, Eric!

5056580,32302056,2015-05-16,33302438,Shaun,"The Soaring Crane Luxury Garden Retreat was very comfortable and relaxing, simple and easy access and a beautiful setting, would definitely come back."
5056580,32353667,2015-05-17,6457901,Carey,I stayed two nights with a break between stays. My review for the first night remains as the review for the second night
5056580,32568704,2015-05-19,6457901,Carey,"I didn't take the time to explore the neighborhood because I didn't want to leave Soaring Crane retreat, I was so spellbound by the place.

The beauty, the quiet and privacy were stunning. I arrived to the sweet song of a wren coming from the deep greenery of Eric's garden.  I was tired from my travels and meetings, yet I had trouble sleeping the first night. The stimulation of the beauty in and outside the Soaring Crane retreat stirred me. I didn't want to miss a minute of it by sleeping even though the bedding couldn't have been more sumptuous. Although I was a solo guest, friends and family visited during my stay. Eric was most welcoming and accommodating. His attention to detail in the apartment is exceptional. Motion sensitive LED floor lights safely illuminate the way to the bathroom, the kitchen is completely equipped, and the cleanliness is exceptional. Luxury doesn’t begin to describe the pleasures of the Soaring Crane retreat. This is ultra Airbnb. Lucky is the traveler who gets to stay here."
5056580,32693878,2015-05-20,30907386,Heather,The place was very clean spacious and quiet. And the outdoor sitting area was pleasant surprise.

5056580,33679044,2015-05-31,31186787,Remi,"Soaring Crane apartment was a truly serene  and beautiful place to stay for a week. We loved the design aesthetic - the colours, the art objects, the comfort of the furniture and the bed. It has a great shower and everything was very clean. The private back garden was lovely for eating, reading, meditating. Almost daily, we walked the pleasant neighbourhood to the station for the Light Rail or the Bus. There was also a good supermarket near the station to pick up supplies for cooking. It was central and accessible to greater Seattle, yet when we were inside the apt, we were on retreat ( as if in Bali). Eric was a gracious host, making sure we had everything we needed. We will definitely return on future trips to Seattle. "
5056580,34045660,2015-06-03,782812,Kimberly,Great stay! Very clean and spacious. A great find at an excellent price. Beautiful gardens
5056580,34130794,2015-06-05,4298984,Brian,"Eric was very responsive and helpful. His place truly has a retreat like feel with elegant Asia decor that would fit a 4 star hotel.  We only wish we had more time to enjoy it.  Thanks Eric. We will be back.   Brian and Tina

5056580,34687352,2015-06-10,35315364,Scott,"Eric is an amazing host.  He made us feel right at home the minute we arrived.  The space is private, quiet and soothing.  Everything has been thought of for the perfect place for an urban retreat!  Comfortable bed, great shower, and plenty of space to move around.  We didn't feel any need to leave the room.  But when we did it was just a short walk to the light rail station for an quick and easy trip into the city - very easy to get around without a car.  The neighborhood has wonderful parks and watering holes all within walking distance.  We'll be back again for sure!  Thanks Eric for a wonderful stay :-)"
5056580,34779329,2015-06-12,3788525,Jane,"Eric seems to have a knack for making his guests feel welcome. His listing accurately described Soaring Crane. Eric communicated clearly about the amenities and how to access his listing.  He also provided us with information about the neighborhood and surrounding areas.
We had the pleasure of meeting Eric. He is in person as he is in his profile, warm and approachable.
Soaring Crane is a hidden gem in Seattle.  We loved everything about the space both inside and out. In particular it was a pleasure to be able to get away from the hustle and bustle of center of the city.
We slept well and comfortably which is always plus when traveling."
5056580,35299966,2015-06-17,3249826,Kate,"Eric is a very responsive host who patiently and thoughtfully responded to all my questions before we arrived. The location of the apartment is a bit tricky but once found, it is such a delightful refuge from the bustle of the city. Everything in the apartment was carefully and neatly arranged and spotless. All amenities we could want and many more we did not even think of (chocolate, a selection of teas, umbrellas, etc) were provided. The sunny deck facing the wildlife refuge was perfect for morning tea.

This is the best Airbnb apartment I have stayed in to date, and we would have certainly considered staying on a few extra days if the apartment had been available. Would definitely come again and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a peaceful oasis in Seattle."
5056580,35458867,2015-06-19,9813860,Jill,"Soaring Crane is a wonderful oasis. It featured all the amenities we could have asked for. It's also in the perfect location, close to the transit station, to head to a Mariners game. Our trip was streamlined thanks to Eric's advice and expertise! We will definitely be back."
5056580,35569384,2015-06-20,235494,Katherine,"Eric is a great host. He is very communicative and responsive from the time of our booking and during our short stay.  Upon our arrival, he welcomed us with open arms.  He even shared his fresh baked, delicious, homemade almond torte with us!  
The apartment is spotless, everything in its place, and well organized. The kitchen is well stocked and there was even a nice bar of dark chocolate ( my favorite) on the bed, just like a five- star hotel.  There are interesting books to read, games to play, instructions and recommendations to follow. Everything was well-planned and beautifully executed, down to the motion detector night lights. 
It was a pleasure to meet Eric, a thoughtful, considerate and mindful human being that comes through as we walked beyond the garden gate into the oasis of a lush green garden and a peaceful, zen, tastefully decorated interior of the apartment.  The beauty of the place is in its simplicity and calmness.  If one is looking for a restful place to unwind, this is it!   We would definitely return on our next visit to Seattle. 

"
5056580,36099095,2015-06-25,32475607,Nicolas,"Eric's apartment was perfect for our 2-days first visit of Seattle. Now I understand all grateful comments from previous guests! Eric's place is equipped with all you may need (including delicious tes and chocolate!) and decorated with taste. It is not in the center of Seattle but at walking distance from the Beacon Hill train station from where you can directly reach downtown or the airport. And Eric was a perfect host, very helpful for our first Airbnb booking. My boyfriend and I definitely recommend staying at Eric's place"
5056580,36376736,2015-06-28,30705857,Chiloh,Soaring Crane met and exceeded our expectations. The unit was so welcoming and relaxing.  Just what we were looking for in our first visit to Seattle.  We wouldn't hesitate to book Eric's place again!
5056580,36770167,2015-07-01,19128750,Sebastian,We got to Eric's place after our long flight from Germany and we felt in love with this place right from the beginning. It is such a nice place - feels like an oasis of relaxation. In addition Eric is a very responsive and great host. I fully recommend Eric's place to anybody!!! Looking forward to our next stay in the soaring crane!
5056580,37041843,2015-07-04,3410925,Zachary,"Most of the time that I do Airbnb, I'm not searching for a particularly luxe place, I'm more just looking for a place to rest my head - a place where I can cook my own meals, save some money, link up with a host who can give me city tips, that sort of thing. It's always worked great for that. Except for that one time in Austin. The less said about that, the better. Anyway, it's almost always worked great.

But this time we were in Seattle for my wife's birthday and we decided to seek out a nicer place. And Eric's apartment definitely fits the bill. It's way nicer than most any hotel room you could want to stay in. It's spacious, thoughtfully decorated, comfortable, plush - the kind of place that you'd want to spend a lot of time enjoying. Sadly, we only had 1 day in Seattle, and since we wanted to see the city, we didn't spend as much time in the apartment as we could have (or would have wanted to). But the apartment is also good for seeing the city. It's close to downtown - if you're feeling up for it you can walk (we did), or the light rail is easy and close, or Uber is cheap. 

Also important is that Eric is a super-helpful host - he made sure we were comfortable in Seattle's version of a heat wave (coming from Mississippi, I was unimpressed with what counts as a heat wave) and also took the time to call a local bakery to make sure it would be open for us to grab breakfast before a July 4 early-morning flight. 

In sum, my first time in an Airbnb luxury option went extremely well and I recommend Eric's place without hesitation. I certainly hope we can get back there someday soon.
"
5056580,37230063,2015-07-05,15330983,Duduo,"Eric's place is the cleanest airbnb I have ever seen amongst all of my trips. I can tell that he put a lot of effort into the place i order to create a calm and relaxing environment. We also really enjoyed the coffee he provided, so good ! On top of that , Eric is very friendly person and he makes everything so effortless. Fantastic place , awesome host !  "
5056580,37605641,2015-07-08,36801668,Richard,This was my first time doing airbnb and I didn't know what to expect.  Eric was a great host and responded to my inquiries within 30 minutes.  The flat was very spacious and updated.  It was a quiet and calming surrounding.  
5056580,37744345,2015-07-10,32373178,Anna,"We had a very nice stay at the soaring crane!  Lots of room in the flat, with a full kitchen and living room. It was extremely clean and had lots of helpful notes throughout. We actually got to meet Eric who was very nice, helpful, and a pleasure to speak to.  The location was really nice. Close to the light rail which took us right downtown and to the airport. We also walked to a great Italian restaurant and the grocery store located really close to the flat. A feature that I really liked was having motion lights come on while walking up and through the garden to get to the door. Made me feel safe and welcome. Would definitely stay here again if we come back to Seattle!! Thanks Eric!!"
5056580,37877092,2015-07-11,3033544,Alex,"This flat was beautiful! Even more spacious than we expected, meticulously clean in a much-appreciated peaceful setting. Eric communicated well and promptly and was a very conscientious host. Would definitely stay again! "
5056580,38288005,2015-07-14,34925088,Marque,"Eric was nice and welcoming.  The place is well furnished and comfortable.  The garden is beautiful.  The area leaves a bit to be desired but it's such an oasis that the surrounding area didn't matter.  Great host, good communication, and wonderful place to stay."
5056580,38592998,2015-07-17,15603945,Anne,"All the previous reviews detailed how wonderful the place is and how welcoming Eric is. This is all true! 
The flat is so quiet and well organised - it is also really big and super well-located, half way between downtown and the airport, with easy access the the light rail (5min walk). 
As if this wasn't enough, I must say, the very best thing about this listing is definitely its host: Eric is simply delightful. From the 1st moment I met him, I felt as if I was staying with a friend. He was caring and helpful, without ever being intruding. As I was staying on my own, this was particularly welcome. I knew that if I needed anything, I could just ring or text him. 
I wish I could give 6 stars (******), as this is what Eric deserves.
When I come back this is definitely the place, I'll stay! 
Thank you again this restful stay... 

"
5056580,38709247,2015-07-18,2004337,Michelle,"This place is truly a one-of-a-kind gem nestled in a small & friendly Seattle neighborhood. We stayed here for one night at the end of a week-long trip and were truly sorry we didn't have more time to enjoy the Soaring Crane. From the moment we walked in we didn't want to leave. As everyone's said, the place is just magic...large, welcoming rooms, a serene garden, organic bedding, stone bathroom... better than your own home! 

Eric was the perfect host...answering every text immediately and giving advice on travel and dining when asked. He prepared the place for our arrival with chocolates on the bed and a welcome folder with a list of all local stores, restaurants and service.  Instructional notes were tastefully placed around the apartment in all the right places.

There are fine hosts, good hosts, and amazing hosts...Eric and the Soaring Crane are AMAZING."
5056580,39154261,2015-07-21,19128750,Sebastian,"This was already our second stay at Eric's apartment. Again, it was a great stay. Eric is such a friendly host and the soaring crane apartment is just amazing. We are looking forward to book our next stay in Seattle at his place!!!"
5056580,39298552,2015-07-22,35708268,Grace,"Eric was the ultimate host.  He allowed us to drop off our bags early and then check in a couple hours early in order to take a nap, since we were arriving after an overnight flight.  He showed us around the place  so that we knew where everything we might need was located and then gave us suggestions for local restaurants and attractions.  The retreat was exactly as pictured -- clean, organized and extremely well appointed.  Eric has thought of every nuance to create an aesthetically pleasing and soothing atmosphere.  It was the perfect place to relax, with an ultra quiet and comfy bedroom, books, tea, and a lovely sunlit table on the deck overlooking the back garden.  We only hope that next time we visit Seattle, we are able to stay at Soaring Crane longer!   Thank you, Eric!!"
5056580,39496539,2015-07-24,27812401,Katharin,"Eric greeted us as soon as we arrived. Soaring Crane is like a beautiful garden retreat. His flat, as he calls it, is beautifully decorated and you truly have your own little home with living room (comfy leather couch and chair) sitting area for computer, cards or snacks; large bedroom and elegant bath with the best shower! Very clean and classy! Eric was extremely helpful in local travel advice and responded immediately. Sorry to leave! Thanks so much. Great way to start our tour through the northwest. "
5056580,39758344,2015-07-26,25241442,Allison,"Everything was perfect.  Clean comfortable.  Attractive.   Would be happy to live in that suite :) 
He had a list of recommendations for restaurants.   Only a 25 min walk to safeco field.   "
5056580,40429873,2015-07-31,30770233,Michael,"Soaring Crane Luxury Garden Villa far exceeded my expectations.  Eric Spivack was polite, attentive, and amazingly organized.  He had thought of every possible need a traveler could have.  The villa is very large, beautifully decorated, meticulously clean, and in the middle of a peaceful garden.  There were comfortable indoor and private outdoor spaces provided.  A large and comfortable bathroom was stocked with everything needed and then some.  The lighting was perfection with dimmer switches in every room to make the villa a relaxing oasis any time of the day or night.  A variety of teas and coffee were also provided.  It was so nice that Eric lives on the property.  He kindly made himself available for questions about Seattle, restaurants, directions, and other useful information.  I felt very welcome, pampered, and lucky to have found such a fabulous place to stay for my first visit to a beautiful city.  It was an amazing experience that I will repeat next year if he isn't all booked up--which would not surprise me."
5056580,40727864,2015-08-02,8260766,Michelle,"We rented Eric's space for our newlywed niece and her husband, when they returned from a month in Europe. It was the best gift we could have given them!
The apartment is private, serene and beautiful! There was a real sense of a garden getaway that we wouldn't have thought possible this close to everything!
The thoughtful touches Eric has included in the ample space make this a place to want to stay and take care of yourself, while being just 3 blocks from the light rail which gets you downtown in 5 minutes! If you're driving on your own, it's just 10 minutes. 
We will definitely use Eric's place for out of town visitors and HIGHLY recommend this site!
Thank you, Eric!"
5056580,41065588,2015-08-04,1723645,Jennifer,"Soaring Crane is perfect in every way-
It is beautiful, thoughtful and as a result gracious and exceptionally comfortable.
We hope to return. It is a retreat in every way and yet so very convenient to all that Seattle offers. Eric is charming and has created a jewel of a nest. "
5056580,41587441,2015-08-08,31494006,Rosalie,Eric greeted us on arrival and introduced to the locality .The accommodation was spotlessly  clean and beautifully appointed and well located about 10 mins from an excellent transport system.Would highly recommend this accommodation

5056580,42267555,2015-08-12,12162269,Katie,"As everyone has already stated, this place is beautiful, peaceful, cozy, and very clean.

5056580,42673834,2015-08-15,2269860,Kai,"Soaring crane was beautiful! The pictures do not do it justice. It was a large, beautiful and thoughtfully decorated place that was a joy to come back home to after a full day of exploring the city. I never got a chance to meet Eric but he was present and felt easily accessible. Would love to stay here again! "
5056580,42831659,2015-08-16,10016086,Frank,"I had a pleasant stay in Seattle (would recommend to see the Rat City Roller Girls) and Eric did a perfect job as a host. Beautiful place, clean and comfy. Easy to come and go."
5056580,43547108,2015-08-20,4345264,Alison,"Eric was the perfect host -- responsive, attentive, and thoughtful. He seemed to anticipate any need his guest might have while staying in his lovely home. Impeccably appointed, the accommodations were wonderful providing privacy in a serene, calming atmosphere. I particularly enjoyed the recently added personal deck where I enjoyed a cup of tea courtesy of the many options supplied by Eric. The combination was a fitting, relaxing option for me after a long day of work downtown.

I highly recommend Soaring Crane to anyone seeking a retreat-like experience nestled in the lovely Beacon Hill community. Easy access to the light rail, safe area in which to run/walk, and many options for eating/shopping make Eric's place an easy choice for an overnight visit or extended stay. I look forward to seeing you again, Eric! Thank you so very much!"
5056580,43781993,2015-08-22,11134865,Ariel,"The Soaring Crane Luxury Garden Retreat certainly felt luxurious to my husband and me, but for a great price!  The home was spacious and so clean, with many little personal touches and notes around the house, making us feel incredibly welcome and taken care of.  The surrounding gardens were peaceful and spelled fragrant and lovely, and we used the light rail several times which was nearby - just a few minutes walk away.  Eric was so helpful and friendly, and we used his recommendation list for a delicious Vietnamese restaurant our first night in Seattle.  It was a wonderful place to stay and I highly recommend this garden retreat during your trip to Seattle!"
5056580,44174686,2015-08-24,39628292,Philip,Thanks so much for the great experience Eric!  We love the luxury flat and definitely will try to book it on our next trip to Seattle!

Eric was the perfect host.  His suggestions and recommendations were awesome, and we loved every single minute of our visit.

He checked in with us prior to arrival to see if we had any questions and to ensure we had proper directions to his home. The flat was exactly as described-- immaculate design, comfy, and open. The gardens outside the home were beautiful to sit in (and eat some veggies from! Thanks Eric!)We felt very safe with the electronic entry to the flat and the great motion-sensor lighting outside. The kitchen was wonderful to cook meals in that we bought from the local farmer's market and Eric had great tips for restaurants and things to explore in his neighborhood. We hope to be back!"
5056580,48615327,2015-09-27,1768177,Nancy,"This is a very special place.  It is in a beautiful tucked away alley, very quiet and private, with greenery all around.  Inside, every detail has been lovingly created to promote a sense of relaxed order and calming beauty.  There is no TV which is a blessing.  Everything was beautifully appointed; the kitchen is brand new and has anything you could want.  It's spacious and I thoroughly enjoyed being there, and will certainly go back.  I've stayed in many hotels, AirBNBs, and VRBOs, and this is one of the very nicest places I've ever been.  It's an inspiring space that gives much more than a place to lay your head for the night."

We have been to Thailand, and we felt as if we were back there as walked through the well bamboo path.  
Eric provided the most extensive selection of teas (organic) of all the Airbnb places we stayed at.   We enjoyed sipping hot herbal teas and the delicious chocolate.  The place was very clean and comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked with all the pans and utensils needed to cook a meal.  Wine glasses are also provided

The pictures on the site are beautiful and the place itself did not disappoint. Soaring Crane has a tranquil, spa-like atmosphere enhanced by a beautiful garden sanctuary. The suite itself is comparable to a nice hotel in terms of decor, cleanliness and amenities. We met Eric as we were leaving and he was very friendly and eager to hear how our experience was. We would definitely stay here again and will encourage others to do so as well."

It was well stocked and decorated.  We were very comfortable there and would return!  If you are looking for a retreat, this is the place.  It's also close to downtown.  We had a car which made it even better but the place is also near a light rail station, grocery stores, restaurants and bakeries.  Thumbs up for this place!"

The Soaring Crane retreat has been, by far, one of my favorite Airbnb experiences and would stay again for sure! The location is great - a short walk from the nearest light rail station, which takes you right into downtown Seattle. The home itself is simply beautiful and immaculate; the perfect place to come home to after a long day of exploring the city. Quiet, calm and surrounded by a beautiful lush garden. We really enjoyed having our morning coffee out on the little deck, just taking in the gorgeous garden and fresh Seattle air, as well as checking out all of the great books Eric provides. Thanks for everything, Eric!"

5056580,53340388,2015-11-08,322938,Amy,"This is an Air BnB host whose fastidious level of cleanliness and peaceful/cozy design choices exceed all expectations. Eric could give lessons to aspiring hosts. 

The place is perfect. The design is well thought out, we loved the warm colors of each room and the beautiful garden you walk through to and from the front door. The location is great. There are restaurants, bars, public transportation and a beautiful park all within walking distance. It's away from the hustle and bustle of downtown but a very quick trip by car or train (which is 10 minutes away by foot).  "
5056580,53606114,2015-11-10,5079017,Natalie,"Eric made me feel so welcome! I arrived in the evening and Soaring Crane was a beautiful environment to settle into for the night. In fact, it was such a beautiful environment I ended up staying in later the next day as well! Clean, friendly, Thailand decor which was beautiful and gave a true sense of serenity. Eric was helpful and kind and considerate in his manner. I was fortunate enough to meet him and can honestly say that he was as wonderful to talk to as the place was to stay at. Quick walk to the light rail and the neighborhood safe and fine for a good run.  24 hour grocery nearby and if you want a ride, easy to find a quick Lyft in case of rain! Thank you for the best airbnb experience I have had yet. "
5056580,53707156,2015-11-11,3779192,Nancy,"You won't find a more peaceful, clean, simply decorated, comfortable, well planned, airbnb than this. "
5056580,53866973,2015-11-13,48706896,Sarah,"On arrival day, Eric sent me an email mentioning that he would love to say ""Hello"" when we arrived. His simple message allowed us the pleasure to arrive when we were ready. We didn't feel rushed or abided by time. Soaring Crane was just as he had described. After exiting the highway with Google Maps, and following the directions, we found the house by using the wonderfully descriptive message he had sent. It looked exactly on the outside like he had described! As soon as we arrived I went for a quick walk, and got some cold beers and delicious USA tortilla chips and salsa!  "
5056580,53933643,2015-11-14,2129221,Skye,"My boyfriend and I needed a getaway to recharge and reconnect amidst our chaotic lives. We came toe the Garden Sanctuary to be greeted by a smiling Eric, chocolate, a clean, spacious space and a beautiful garden outside. I could not have asked for a better location, nor host!"
5056580,54037337,2015-11-15,17104852,Michael,Wow that was awesome... Thanks. See you soon!
5056580,54422881,2015-11-19,45023599,Scott,"Eric was a wonderful communicator.  His Beautiful Oasis was just as great.  It was a perfect evening!  I would have loved to stay a bit longer, but I know where I will be staying next time I am in town!  He was full of great advice locally as well as internationally.  Thanks for the welcome gift Eric!!  
Much Aloha to you!  "
5056580,54638517,2015-11-22,18173824,Saran,The place was quite spacious and nice. It looked like it was described.
5056580,54946113,2015-11-25,33604195,Michael,"Eric made us incredibly welcome. We have done a lot of Air BNB's in Seattle but he was definitely one of our greatest highlights. Communication was super solid and we arrived late, but luckily he had a great entry system that allowed us to get in without bothering anyone. The place is AMAZINGLY GORGEOUS. THE PICTURES DO NOT DO IT JUSTICE! You must arrive for yourself to see the condo-like decor accented with the beauty and art of Thailand and South East Asia. It is one of a kind. You can TELL the level of care and detail into every small thing in the place. I challenge you to find all the small bits and pieces personally accented by Eric. You will be teleported to Thailand in his pad. 

Also he has EVERYTHING you need. It was cold when we were in Seattle but there's a heater in every room. The bathroom is incredible and the bed was a dream to sleep on. The ease of access made going in and out very simple. We even have our parking spot (But watch out it is a bit narrow).

We loved talking with Eric and sharing great conversation. We can't wait to stay again with our new friend Eric :) I highly recommend for couples or one individual! Also, comfy sofa that can turn into a bed in the living room!"
5056580,55685906,2015-12-04,13017185,Kenneth,"Soaring Crane... probably the perfect experience for what we needed. Quiet, calm, spotless, cozy. An oasis. We felt like we were in our own world there, surrounded by a peaceful garden. I can't think of a single detail I would change. Eric was very discreet; we did run into him when he was gardening and he was helpful and friendly. The design of the bathroom, the bedroom, the kitchen... well, let's just say... by the end of our stay, we wished we lived there. Beacon Hill is an upward trending neighborhood with some great bars and restaurants -- and it's incredibly easy to drive to Capitol Hill, Georgetown, or any number of hip enclaves should Beacon Hill not have what you're looking for. Parking was available at Soaring Crane, but even if not, there are two cul-de-sacs on either side of the alley you enter Soaring Crane from where you can easily find parking with no restrictions. 

My favorite Soaring Crane memory is listening to rain fall on the leaves of the garden, feeling at peace, and best of all, at home. "
5056580,55734992,2015-12-05,10103404,Ann,Soaring Crane Luxury Garden apartment was everything that was advertised and more.  What a beautiful place!  I also enjoyed my quick interaction with Eric.  
5056580,56374502,2015-12-13,45763307,Kelsey,Eric has created such a beautiful and relaxing space. The location is perfect and he gave us so many wonderful suggestions of what to do in Seattle. We could not have asked for a better host for our first time exploring this wonderful city. 
5056580,56846848,2015-12-19,6073336,Mike,"Eric's home was an excellent point to explore Seattle from. We especially loved the relaxing, calming atmosphere of the home. Would definitely recommend!"
5056580,56955637,2015-12-20,48585267,Daniel,"Soaring Crane is an absolutely beautiful retreat nestled in a lush private garden in the quaint (and very desirable) Seattle neighborhood of North Beacon Hill. The accommodations are spacious, elegant and exquisitely appointed with Thai themed décor, rich dark wood interiors and soft, warm lighting throughout.  There are many different spaces within the apartment for sitting, relaxing, meditating or working.  The full kitchen and bathroom contain all the amenities. We enjoyed relaxing in a hot bath and then having coffee in the main entrance area where a table and chairs face out onto the garden. Eric has thought of every detail. There are several small, extremely efficient wall heaters built into strategic areas so that no matter where you are in the apartment, at the turn of dial, you are sure to stay cozy and comfortable. The bed is one of the most comfortable we’ve ever slept in and the bedside lamps provide just the right light to read by and add to the golden glow that suffuses the place. Extra pillows and even two faux fur blankets folded up and waiting in a bedroom niche behind of saffron curtain made us feel like royalty- and why not? We look forward to staying with Eric again- who, by the way, is the perfect host: hospital, friendly and attentive. 
"
5056580,57065337,2015-12-21,31675315,Alison,My boyfriend and I stayed the night is Eric's very cute and very clean air bnb for the night! We got into town before the check in time and Eric graciously kept our bags for us while we went to a Seahawks game. Great location for the Link Lightrail. I could not have been happier with how cozy and neat the place was. We felt right at home :) I would highly recommend this place and would love to stay there again in the future. 
5056580,57661993,2015-12-28,45332415,Meredith,"My husband and I loved our 6 night stay at the Soaring Crane! It is a beautifully decorated, extremely peaceful unit. Everything was very clean, stocked and tastefully chosen. Fantastically comfortable bed, too. This is a BnB where you can tell the owner loves hosting! The convenient location near the light rail made it possible for us to forgo a car rental and get outside! Eric was very kind and flexible with arriving early and dropping off luggage and leaving a little late. We loved our Christmas adventure here and will definitely recommend this place to our friends. 5 stars. "
5056580,58046340,2015-12-31,10736635,Michael,"This was a perfect place to stay. Every detail was well thought out so that we had a relaxing stay. This is a model for what Airbnb's should be. If you're considering staying here, do it! We were visiting Seattle without a car, and it was very easy to walk the 2ish blocks to the light rail and take it a few stops into downtown."
6107518,32432163,2015-05-17,14711154,Hannah,"Stacies place is in a great location and is within walking distance to the light rail with easy access into the city (20 minute trip) and the airport (15 minute trip). McDonald's, Circle k, Starbucks and various other small restaurants in very close proximity with Safeway within walking distance too (next to the light rail station). The house itself is very clean, large and well kept. The room was great, equipped with a TV and closet if needed. The private bathroom is newly renovated, very clean and right next door to the bedroom. Shampoo, conditioner, soap & towels were provided. Stacie was more than happy for us to use the kitchen facilities which was great. She also provided us with details of the city, maps etc which were very helpful. Communication from Stacie prior to arrival was very easy. Would definitely recommend this room, Stacie was a wonderful host and her cats are very friendly :)"
6107518,34045460,2015-06-03,34782809,Justin,"Stacie was very accommodating on very short notice and provided a great experience.  The directions to her house are very accurate and it's easy to find.  I felt safe on the walk to/from the train and in the home/surrounding area.  Her house is very nice and well kept (never would have known she had cats if I didn't see them).  The private room and bathroom was a bonus.  Unfortunately, because of conflicting schedules we didn't actually get to meet in person but she was very quiet while I slept and it was a great first airbnb experience.  I will be back in the future if she has an opening!  "
6107518,34471225,2015-06-08,5391752,Luke,I enjoyed my stay. Stacie was friendly and helpful when I need some tips on where to find food and transportation options. Very comfortable bedroom and nice kitchen and dining areas for meals. I would stay again!
6107518,34806503,2015-06-12,17357311,Aurélien,"Our first experience with Airbnb in Stacie at Seattle was wonderfull. Stacie is a good host. She is very kindly, friendly and very serious. Her house is very quiet and the bedroom and bathroom are clean. She is available to give many advices about activities in Seattles. We recommand Stacie.  "
6107518,35015328,2015-06-14,34831486,Kelly,"Great first experience using Airbnb. Chose this location due to easy access to public transport- the house is within walking distance to  the light rail which we used all weekend- no need for a rental car if you're staying here! Very comfortable and clean home- the room had a brand new mattress. Nice deck and yard that was great for enjoying a coffee in the morning. Stacie is a great host and makes you feel right at home. She provided local information upon arrival, and was happy to give restaurant recommendations. I would definitely recommend Stacie and her home to anyone visiting Seattle! This was such a great alternative to paying 300+ for a hotel downtown."
6107518,35581840,2015-06-20,23744416,Bob,Stacie was very easy to reach and her house was great.  Completely updated and comfortable.  Stacie went out of her way to let me know about transportation and dining options in the neighborhood.
6107518,35726507,2015-06-21,35469598,Linzy,"This was my first experience with airbnb and I would definitely do it again! Stacie's house lived up to her description. Her house was very clean (and smelled like apple cider, yum) the bed was very comfortable, I slept like a baby. She provided us with the bus and link schedule which was very handy. She accepted my request ten minutes after submitting it! Overall, it was a great experience!"
6107518,35975381,2015-06-23,10832010,Rachel,"Stacie was a wonderful host and her home was welcoming and comfortable. Carter the cat was charming.
 The bed was comfortable. The TV was luxurious. Stacie was friendly and accomodating.  We highly recommend this spot. "
6107518,38516134,2015-07-16,35103596,Gina,"This was our first experience with airbnb, I'm so glad it was with  Stacie she made it so easy. Her place is beautiful ,the bed is so comfy . We slept great ,the room is so nice and quiet. Carter the cat is so sweet.
Loved the kitchen!! The bathroom is perfect, water pressure is fantastic.
The light rail is located close by and so easy to use . Thank you Stacie for everything, you really made our stay so pleasant ! "
6107518,38747834,2015-07-18,36473425,Vernon,"This was my first bob experience so I probably didn't read the fine print about two cats.  If I had, I don't think I would have selected this listing.  That would have been a colossal mistake, and I would have missed out on meeting a great host and staying at a place that was absolutely perfect for my stay.  The room & bath room were very clean, the location was great, and I don't believe I could have selected a better place."
6107518,39300860,2015-07-22,13425642,Molly,We really enjoyed our stay with Stacie. She is very sweet and went out of her way to make sure we had the best experience possible. We definitely recommend her!
6107518,39657884,2015-07-25,2548616,Ryan,"Don't let the location of Stacie's place dissuade you. It's so close to the Link train, it's a breeze to explore all of Seattle. Her place is immaculate and inviting, and Stacie was a welcoming, gracious host. "
6107518,40494241,2015-07-31,38102388,Eleanor,"Stacie was welcoming and her home is just as gorgeous as the photos.  What you can't see is Stacie's kindness and warmth AND the comfy new mattresses.  The room is very private and has a super luxe bed, nice fresh linens. The house is a 10 minute walk from the Link Light Rail, which makes it convenient to the airport and downtown.  The urban neighborhood has many services (like a ""Walk-Ins accepted"" salon for hair and pedicure), stores and restaurants.  There's a Safeway and a huge Oriental market close by to get anything you need.  The Drive Thru only Starbucks won't serve pedestrians :) but McDonalds will, right across the street.  Staying here was fantastic! It was such a bargain because the kitchen, living room and backyard deck were also available to responsibly enjoy."
6107518,41625153,2015-08-08,33607719,Daniel,"Listing description was accurate and had everything I needed to rest and do some work from home.  I booked the room with a friend and we had everything we needed to be comfortable. Unfortunately, Stacie was out of town during our visit so I didn't get to meet her, but she had set up everything for us in advance for a great stay."
6107518,41767342,2015-08-09,5391752,Luke,Lovely home. My son enjoyed feeding the cats which were quiet all night. We hope to be back in the future.
6107518,42886461,2015-08-16,26184513,Jessica,"Stacie was very helpful and welcoming, with a useful info sheet provided in the room. We left some items behind and Stacie was very helpful in arranging postage back to us. The bedroom and bathroom were as described, very clean and comfortable. The bed especially was one of the best beds we've slept in through airbnb! TV with Netflix in the room was also great. Location was close to the light rail station, less than a 10 min walk. Super cute cats! "
6107518,43789433,2015-08-22,6124025,Chao,I extended my stay at Stacie's. Highly recommend!
6107518,44170365,2015-08-24,33617901,Janell,All good. Thank you for the BBQ.
6107518,45694032,2015-09-05,21064485,Amy,We spent a very comfortable night in Stacie's very nice house. It is a perfect location.
6107518,45980947,2015-09-07,951515,Marina,"We chose Stacie's place because of short drive from airport, easy parking and good reviews - we were not disappointed! The 100 year old house is fully remodeled, spotless and comfortable. Plenty of parking spots! It is about 10min walk to lightrail train which goes right to downtown of Seattle. If you have a car, you can get to Highway 101 in 5min or so. 
Stacie provides very descriptive information on everything you could possibly need during your stay, so don’t worry if you don’t have a map of downtown. She is really welcoming host… and plums from her garden are delicious!
"
6107518,46356075,2015-09-09,2159173,David,"Our stay with Stacie was perfect.  There was good communication leading up to our stay and Stacie was there to meet us upon arrival.  Her house is beautiful, clean and close to transport.  There are some great flyers to help with general house keeping, things to do and public transport.  Stacie is a great host who welcomes the visitor and ensures your stay is comfortable.  I highly recommend staying with Stacie when visiting Seattle"
6107518,46390081,2015-09-10,8246972,Nico,Stacie was very hospitable and has a beautifully-appointed house. We enjoyed the room and private bathroom. It's a great location for accessing light rail (to/from airport and downtown) and bus to the city. Safeway supermarket near the Othello LR station. 
6107518,46680906,2015-09-12,35333637,Mykayla,This home was so beautiful an amazing price for the value. It's was conveniently located near downtown and airport the light rail was super easy to understand. Stacie was amazing she let us extend our stay longer because other plans fell through and was very helpful and accommodating. Would definitely stay there again if I went back to seattle
6107518,48007060,2015-09-22,42233247,Dana,"Stacie has the nicest home in the working-class neighborhood. The accommodations were tight. Large people would be squeezed. 
Stacie is very hospitable, and her 2 cats well behaved.  My only negative was long, dark hairs on the bathroom floor which I swept up.  She had been very busy with other activities. Since several reviews talked about neatness, I was disappointed that all the floors needed to be vacuumed. Overall, a lovely home and stay.  Location was good. "
6107518,48556876,2015-09-27,41938914,Pavlina,"Stacie was a nice host! Her house is beautiful, stylish and comfortable. She made us feel like at home. Also is easy to get there from the airport and the city. Thank you! "
6107518,49543587,2015-10-04,44987602,Jianzheng,"Great place - clean, quiet and comfortable. My wife and I enjoyed this stay so much. Stacie is very nice and always make you feel at home."
6107518,50696269,2015-10-13,15878502,Richard,"The house was beautiful! Clean, quiet, and convenient. The light rail was literally five minutes walk from the house, and you can pick up a Thai bubble tea along the way. Charming neighborhood. The Rainier BBQ on the corner of the block was actually featured in Anthony Bourdain's 'The Layover'. And it was amazing! The cats in the house made for good company- one was very social and loves attention. Overall, highly recommended place to stay if you want cheap and convenient access to Downtown Seattle."
6107518,51337976,2015-10-19,33873305,Trevor,"Such a great place to stay! Everything was so easy and Staci was very responsive and great to work with. The room was nice and clean and so was the bathroom!! The cats were awesome to hang with too, my wife definitely loved those little guys. Getting to the lite rail was very easy also, it takes you straight to downtown or the airport and anywhere in between. If I'm ever in Seattle again, I will be coming back here for sure! Thanks for providing a great first experience to Seattle!"
6107518,53968464,2015-11-15,44109606,Rebecca,"We had a wonderful time during our stay with Stacie! The house is located within a short walking distance to the light rail and bus stations, and the copies of routes/timetables waiting for us when we arrived made navigating the city a breeze. Our room was a spacious and comfortable place that we were grateful to come home to after long days of exploring the city. The clean private bathroom and TV with Netflix were nice bonuses as well. Stacie was quick to answer any questions and was very accommodating during both the booking process and the duration of our time there. This was an overall great experience, and I'd especially recommend it to anyone planning to rely on public transportation during their time in Seattle. Thank you for being such a great host!"
6107518,54416797,2015-11-19,47744879,Noriko,"We felt very welcome in Stacie's place.  Everything was clean, convenient, and generally as reported in the listing.  Stacie was friendly and quiet.  We would be happy to stay at her place again. "

3998922,20461616,2014-09-29,817363,Jenna,"Brandon and Bethany were very welcoming and extremely kind hosts - we had a great stay at their house in Seattle. Their place is located in a nice, safe neighborhood and is convenient for exploring the city. The space was clean (as pictured) and they were great at giving recommendations. I highly recommend staying there while in Seattle! "
3998922,20676446,2014-10-03,20944190,Katie,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful experience with Brandon and Beth! We arrived exhausted from many hours on the road and they were immediately welcoming. Their lovely 2 year old is so well behaved you won't even know he's there. Overall, extremely gracious with kitchen use and super entertaining to talk to! They city is also pretty walkable from the house. I walked to downtown every day (took about 30 min)
"
3998922,20879829,2014-10-06,21931821,Kate,"Brandon and Bethany were the nicest possible couple, and they have a very cute, very well behaved son. They not only gave us a million awesome suggestions for restaurants, they also gave us some free bus passes to use! "
3998922,21103789,2014-10-11,10086597,David,"Really enjoyed my stay.  Super friendly hosts with lots of interesting stories about their time in Seattle and Asia and excellent transport connections to the whole region -- local transit as well as airport light rail, Amtrak and Bolt Bus.  Good on-street parking too.  Room was exactly as shown, immaculately clean with its own bathroom and lots of space.  A great Airbnb experience -- highly recommended."
3998922,21261960,2014-10-13,22244617,William,Brandon & Bethany are both gracious and welcoming hosts.  They made us feel at home and their place was spotless.  Great location too.  Thanks!
3998922,21487352,2014-10-18,22176570,Joshua,"Brandon and Bethany were kind, relaxed, helpful people.  House was clean and quiet.  We travelled with our 2 y/o and appreciated a space friendly for little people.

The bedding situation was a little sparse - 2-3 thin fleece blankets - and we got cold the first night.  We were able to get more from our hosts, but ultimately borrowed a thick wool blanket from friends for that comforting weight.

We live in a quiet sub-urban area and, consequently, were sensitive to the car noise from the fairly busy street outside.  If you are used to urban living this may not be an issue."
3998922,29011284,2015-04-02,18285209,Tuo,Really nice people and great place. It makes me feel a home away from home
3998922,31001839,2015-04-30,7408997,Amy,"The Lindseys welcomed us into their home from the start. They were very accommodating with the room, bathroom, kitchen, laundry and even the garage (where we kept our bikes). Everything was exactly as described and worked very well for us. We also just really enjoyed the neighborhood - close to everything from cafes and parks to bike paths and transit to restaurants and night life. It was a great spot with great hosts. "
3998922,31667734,2015-05-08,2389842,Taylor,My stay with Bethany and Brandon was great! Both of them are friendly and make you feel comfortable. Their parking situation makes coming and going easy and their room is great.

My wife and I stayed in their house for 5 days and enjoyed to be there and to talk with them.
Their three year old boy is very cute and a bundle of energy.
With a lot of advice what to do in seattle additionally, 
we were able to see almost the entire city in this very short period of time.

The house is really beautiful with lovely interior, safe and very clean.
We had a spacious room with large bed and a complete bathroom for ourselves, 
were allowed to use the (energy efficient) washing machine and the dryer.
It is close to downtown, there are 2 busses which takes only some minutes to go there.
We can recommend this stay to our best friends.

The hosts were very nice and gave us some good advises about places to visit and how to get around Seattle. We didn't get to see them much because we were out most of the day but they always made us feel like at home. We enjoyed our stay and loved Seattle. "
3998922,50170899,2015-10-10,20383682,Ellen,"Clean room. Comfortable bed. Brandon and Beth were super nice, they gave us a lot of advice about Seattle. The location of the house is great, just 2 or 3 miles to downtown. Chat with Beth was very nice. "

The apartment is exactly as described, very comfortable, well-appointed, and with a FANTASTIC view of Lake Union! The location is great. With a bus to downtown right outside the door, I didn't need to use my car and even enjoyed a nice run around the lake.
Laura was a great host, easily reached for any questions. Would recommend this place to anyone!"

6400379,35443090,2015-06-18,32936490,Janelle,"We booked very last minute and did not get to spend a ton of time with Alex, but he was very accommodating and communicative when we were trying to figure out our schedules, his home is beautiful, his dog adorable and the neighborhood very cute and upscale.  If you are looking to have fun in the area go check out Lower Queene Anne (mercer) and Fremont.  We tried to go out in Upper Queen Anne at night and it all pretty well shuts down-just a cute, upscale, sleepy little suburb! "
6400379,36316342,2015-06-27,33122732,Kacey,"This is a great house in a quite, safe neighborhood. Room and house are as described in the ad. I would gladly stay there again. "
6400379,39042959,2015-07-20,36158996,Deb,"Binder with information about the area was useful. Host provided bus schedule. Quiet neighborhood. Was within easy walking distance of Upper Queen Anne area. Hard copy of 
Wall Street Journal  newspaper enjoyed."
6400379,40753496,2015-08-02,35038925,André,"We had a great time in Seattle, at Alex's house. It is exactly as is mentioned @ airbnb website, that is, cozy, walking distance to several bus stops, a number of grocery stores nearby and a very pleasant neighborhood. Free parking and Alex's Coffee is also a plus. We would definitely stay there again"
6400379,41375022,2015-08-07,18907445,Villy,"Alex og hans hund tog venlig imod os, selv om vi kom lidt sendt. Værelset var rent og pænt, og vi havde 3 fantastiske dage i Seattle "
6400379,41436584,2015-08-07,38603658,John,"Everything was as described. Alex was very welcoming but gave us our privacy. Accommodations were very clean and comfortable. Great spot in a beautiful neighborhood on top of the hill in Queen Anne. It is walking distance from Freemont and the restaurants and shops of Queen Anne, otherwise easy public transport. Cab from the airport runs you $50.  "
6400379,41633122,2015-08-08,37371729,Awe,"We're in Seattle for one night before heading to Vancouver on our wedding anniversary trip. Alex's place is great and is exactly like what we saw in the pictures. The room was clean and the house has this warm welcoming vibes.  The house has a good location, not too far from downtown, parking is very easy. All in all we have a pleasant stay! Thank you Alex!"
6400379,41784279,2015-08-09,6377854,Brett,Really nice home in a charming neighborhood.  Alex worked with us about our arrival and was there to greet us.  
6400379,42185065,2015-08-11,31245433,Virag,"Beautiful space, great view, the place is very clean, the bed was very comfortable. The neighborhood is friendly, quiet at night, great for a good night's rest. Alex's place is close to buses that will take you downtown in minutes. Alex's young dog, Chloe, is very cute and possibly the silkiest dog I've ever seen, with lots of puppy energy. Alex was a pleasant host, had information available on local spots, and made us delicious coffee in the morning. Would stay again!"
6400379,43069574,2015-08-17,16635989,Chris,"Alex was very accommodating with our late arrival. The room and bed were nice and comfortable. Nice, clean bathroom with cushy towels. He provided yogurt and coffee. He even gave us a lift to the Seattle Center as it was on his way, which we appreciated. Nice neighborhood. It would have been better for us if we had a car, as it was a little far to get to places, although Alex was happy to show us public transportation options (we mostly took Uber rides). Chloe the dog was generally very sweet, but her bark can be a little intimidating. Overall, we had a very nice stay and would recommend this place. "
6400379,44311910,2015-08-25,8021701,Juergen,"Everything was as Alex has described. He has got a beautiful home located in a charming neighborhood. We loved to walk there!
Busses to downtown, restaurants and supermarkets are in walking distance.
Alex was there to say hello, when we arrived and gave useful information.
Room and bathroom were very clean.We stayed for a week.
Overall we had a pleasant stay and would recommend his place.

6400379,45117291,2015-08-31,39473806,Jenny,"We had a great stay at Alex's. Room was exactly as described with convenient bathroom, plenty of street parking if you need it, and very close to bus stops for #3 and #13. The neighborhood is very nice, lots of beautiful gardens, but quite hilly! Lots of great shops and cafes nearby and very convenient to Seattle Center, downtown, Ballard, and Freemont. We would definitely stay there again!"
6400379,45813038,2015-09-06,39296417,Kim,"Great place to stay. Very central to where we wanted to go...pike market, University of Washington, Seahawk stadium. We were easily able to walk or Uber to all locations. Even though we were just sharing a house with Alex, it was very private and quiet. "
6400379,47175458,2015-09-16,345465,Megan,"Alex's home was exactly as advertised: modern, charming, quiet, and with a beautiful view. It was also stylish and impeccably kept. Alex's communication throughout the trip was excellent and he'd left clear and simple instructions for our stay. The bed was very comfortable, with quality linens and soft pillows and the neighborhood was very quiet, lending to 2 nights of great sleep."
6400379,47726772,2015-09-21,7761458,Kristin,The house is very beautiful on a quiet street in a trendy neighborhood. Alex was an attentive host who made sure we had everything we needed.

The place was clean, and Bede was an excellent host - great communication and very responsive.   Will definitely keep Bede in mind for the next visit!"
8293287,48933263,2015-09-29,27374254,Mellissia,"Everything about this experience was positive. Because of urgent travel plans, I had limited time to find a place to stay in the Capitol Hill area, and I am so glad Bede's house was available. He is an excellent communicator, and although we didn't meet in person because of our schedules, he made sure I felt quite welcome. The location was perfect for me, and parking was always available on the same block. The room with attached bathroom was immaculate. I especially liked having a private entrance. Although I didn't use the kitchen very much, I did use the washer and dryer. It was so nice to know that although I was renting a room, I was welcome to use the amenities within the house....and it's a really cool house! I highly recommend this listing and host. Next time, I hope to meet Bede in person."
8293287,49298878,2015-10-02,40988199,Molly,"Bede was a great host while our stay in Seattle. He tried his best to meet our needs and replied our inquiries as soon as he can. The lodging was neat and very well equipped. He has got very good kitchen and efficient WiFi connection. His mattress bed has also given us very good quality sleep. Most importantly, it's only 1 minute walking distance to the bus #2 stop heading to the city center."
8293287,51053356,2015-10-17,45107515,Nicole,"We had the best experience at Bede's. It was our first time using airbnb and I'm so glad we stayed here. Bede was a great host, very accommodating, and answered all our questions quickly. The room was great and having a connected bathroom made it easy to stay private. Upstairs the kitchen and living room was very modern and it was a great area to relax. The location of his house made it easy to commute downtown as the #2 bus takes you straight there. Great experience and would stay here again!  "
8293287,51510209,2015-10-20,46663192,Matt,"I spent two nights at Bede's place.  It was just as advertised.  Good location and easy to get to, would definitely stay here again.  Didn't get a chance to meet Bede but he was reachable by text/email and provided everything needed for an enjoyable stay."
8293287,52449723,2015-10-29,45160572,Amber,"Bede was a great host and opened his place to us for a few days.  We were able to make it feel like home, use the kitchen, and do laundry as needed. He also gave us some suggestions of hiking and places to eat. I would recommend his place! "

7777219,42488001,2015-08-13,40900689,Bivin,"FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE!
The place is exactly as listed and even comes with a mint on the towels!  The room and everything in it is very clean as is the bathroom.  The host was very friendly, attentive and made me feel right at home.  I was in Seattle for a conference so I didn't need a kitchen, although full use of the kitchen was offered if I wanted to fix my own meals at home.   This place is in an awesome neighborhood that I would feel safe with my Mom walking in by herself.  Everyone I ran into was very friendly, most especially the crew that works at the coffee shop / cafe directly across the street.  I give this place and the host an A ++ on a scale where A+ is the best!"
7777219,42789777,2015-08-15,41074503,Bruce,Vivian and roomies made my first Airbnb stay a pleasant one.  Providing great recommendations for food and bars.  The location is about 10 - 15 minutes from anything downtown Seattle.  Super convenient.
7777219,44830147,2015-08-29,1526430,Chris,"Very solid, clean, convenient. Apartment is in an area on the move. Much construction and high rents. Vivian and Oscar are very considerate and eager to please. Bedroom was a little tight and windowless but otherwise fine. Apartment is fully functional. "
7777219,49265801,2015-10-02,27555462,Shi,"Vivian's bf Oscar warmly welcomed me and checked me in. The room is 1 of the 3 bedrooms in the nice apartment. As I left early in the morning and came back at night, I didn't have a lot of communications with the landlord but they are always happy to provide helps! "
3998984,19170376,2014-09-07,14205700,Brittany,"Amy is a wonderful, communicative, and accommodating host! Her beautiful studio apartment is clean, charming, and comfortable.  If you are wanting to get the full Seattle experience stay here! It is literally a block away from some of the greatest bars in Seattle and only a few blocks from pikes place market! She even left us a list of all the amazing restaurants and bars and a map on the wall to check out the city.  And best yet, it's by far the most affordable place you'll find that close in to the city center! "
3998984,19343402,2014-09-10,19981212,Bruno,"We don't met Amy because she was out of the city but she's a very good host because we kept in touch with whatsapp. We arrived late from the airport but it wasn't a problem, she organiced all for our wellcome. The apartment have all necesary for a comfortable stay.
Thanks"
3998984,19488366,2014-09-13,9760228,Sara,"Amy's studio apartment was the perfect place to stay! It was my first time in Seattle and could not have asked for a better location. Only a few minutes away (walking) from Pike's Marketplace, the Space Needle, the Aquarium, tons of great restaurants, bars and of course amazing coffee! The studio provides a spectacular view of the city. Amy was such a gracious host! She is extremely accommodating, communicative, and very quick to respond. Thanks for the amazing experience, Amy!! "
3998984,19802031,2014-09-18,3291450,Matt,Fabulous flat – excellent location and the perfect launchpad for seeing the sites of Seattle. Also one of my first Airbnb experiences; Amy made the whole thing extremely comfortable.
3998984,20038963,2014-09-22,20552065,Cam,"Great place, very tidy and comfortable. Close to EVERYTHING."
3998984,20161558,2014-09-24,21190292,Paul,Great location.  Apartment was clean and Amy was responsive and professional.  
3998984,20618059,2014-10-02,8763594,Hailley,Amy's apartment was exactly as pictured and very comfortable.  I personally enjoyed the bed in the closet- it felt like my own little private cubby and I loved it!  Perfectly close to the public transit I needed and within walking distance to so many great places- I would happily stay there again next time I visit Seattle alone!
3998984,21716880,2014-10-22,16573066,Caro,L'appartement est bien situé. La résidence est sécurisée. L'appartement est lumineux. Peu de bruits provenant de l'extérieur. Mise à disposition de tout le nécessaire pour la cuisine.
3998984,22617018,2014-11-10,23064054,Ivan,"Let me start off by saying that Amy's studio apartment was great for the little time we spent in Seattle. The only flaw (and it isn't even really a flaw) was that it was a little dusty w/ possible pet hair. Aside from that, it was cozy to come back to from a long day and to rest. One of the other great attributes was the location of the apartment. It was only a few blocks from WestLake station and we found it to be walking distance from a good amount of tourist locations. Pike Street Market was right around the corner (not literally but super close). All in all I think we made a good choice on staying in Amy's studio apt. We slept good and were able to walk majority of the time. Thanks Amy for a great stay :)"
3998984,22751667,2014-11-13,18354169,Matt,"Amy's place was incredibly welcoming. It's very well located - within walking distance of downtown and tons of amenities. Amy is very responsive by text and her place is both clean and full of personal charm. The bed was comfortable and the place was warm. The gym in her building is actually great and seems underutilized by residents. I'll definitely stay there again.
"
3998984,23499702,2014-12-02,23126365,Lisa,"Amy's apartment was the perfect choice for our stay in Seattle. It was very conveniently located to the popular touristy sites including the Space Needle and Pike Place. Not to forget all of the delicious restaurants we could walk to :). The bed in the closet was cozy, and we really didn't appreciate much of the noise from the city below us. I felt safe in the building and in the general area. Amy was responsive and also gave us some great recommendations on things to check out - definitely would recommend the Underground Tour. Overall, we really enjoyed our time in Seattle and partly because we stayed in a very conveniently located apartment at a great price!"
3998984,23818004,2014-12-11,1483057,Jenn,"Cozy bed. Hot shower. Cool city. 

Amy's is a great place to stay in downtown Seattle if you need a simple place without fuss. She's a lovely hostess and the location is great!"
3998984,25277580,2015-01-11,24737958,Kevin,Amy is an excellent and very responsive host while the space is cozy and located conveniently close to most of downtown Seattle. We couldn't have asked for a better experience. 
3998984,33160511,2015-05-25,33063434,Mary,"Amy made our first trip to Seattle better than we could've ever hoped for! Her apartment is in the perfect location--we parked in a garage and didn't touch our car all weekend because we could literally walk everywhere. So many great bars and restaurants within a block of her apartment, too! The apartment itself was very clean and comfortable, and had all of the amenities we needed. Amy made the ""check-in"" process extremely quick/easy, too. She was also available by text all weekend to help us with anything we needed, and she left us with suggestions for sights to see and things to do. Couldn't have asked for a better host, apartment, or experience!"
3998984,33619268,2015-05-30,9440163,Jessica," Amy is sooo nice!
She replied every message very quickly, and her place is absolutely perfect which is in a safe neighborhood, nice building and you can walk to almost any attraction.
The most important thing is Amy is willing to help out since we have some questions with our luggage. I really appreciate that.
I will definitely stay in her apartment next time.
"
3998984,35003148,2015-06-14,34410242,Niles,"I had an awesome time at Amy's place! The apartment was clean, neat, and as described. Beside from the excellent location and convenience of the place, Amy was super helpful in directions regarding activities in and around Seattle. In addition, she was also flexible with timing and made sure that I had everything I needed! I would definitely stay with Amy again and strongly recommend her apartment and service! "
3998984,35424211,2015-06-18,1317574,Luke & Breanna,"Very easy to communicate with Amy.  Apartment is as marketed: beautiful location downtown.

Thank you, Amy."
3998984,36416365,2015-06-28,18697852,Cathy & Marvin,"Amy's apartment was everything that we wanted and more. Everything was very clean and the studio felt spacious because of the current room layout. We were very comfortable sleeping in the closet as there is a good amount of room, as well as a small window which let in light and air. It's also worth noting that this is a corner apartment which means there are even more windows for light. What we loved most though, was the location of Amy's apartment. We were able to walk to almost all the places that we wanted to visit in less than 15 minutes like Pike Place, the Space Needle, public library, great restaurants, and more.

We had the pleasure of meeting Amy when we arrived and she made us feel welcomed in her home. In addition to the helpful tips and suggestions that she sent over prior to our arrival, she spent time to tell us about even more places (that we visited and loved) when we arrived at the studio. The check in and out process was very simple and Amy was extremely accommodating. We are truly pleased with our stay and would recommend Amy's place to anyone traveling to Seattle!"
3998984,38941221,2015-07-19,38297961,Allison,"Nice place, perfect for just my husband and I. Amy was very professional and easy to communicate with "
3998984,39836691,2015-07-26,5566459,Casey,Apartment was exactly as described.  Late check in-check out was very easy.  The location was also great.....Ralphs Deli/grocery is 1 block away for the essentials and quick eats.
3998984,40747760,2015-08-02,34876022,Kathy,"Loved this place; very cozy and it sure felt like home. I would definitely recommend this place to others and if I were to visit again, no doubt I'll try to get this place again.

Pros:
The bed is surprisingly comfortable. I thought sleeping in the closet would be weird, but it felt cozy. Love that there is a kitchen for your use; we sure used it to cook dinner one night. Great lighting consider there were tons of windows around the apartment. My favorite thing about this place is the location. No doubt, everything is very close by - downtown, pikes place, space needle, pier and etc.. We were able to walk to everywhere.

Cons: Sometimes noisy at night due to constructions/sirens/and etc.. But it didn't bother us much. "
3998984,41880889,2015-08-09,6026266,Liz,What a great space in a great location!!  We had a wonderful weekend touring Seattle.  Parking was easy.  Amy's space is attractive and comfortable.  Highly recommend.  :)
3998984,43519926,2015-08-20,38177079,Emily,"Amy was so polite and responsive to our questions ahead of our arrival. She made the check-in process easy and stress-free (even though she was out of town)! Her place was exactly what we were looking for: safe, cozy, and within walking distance to all the major sites as well as several cafes, bars, and restaurants. Everyone who lives in the building was friendly. The apartment was clean and looked exactly like the pictures. We were curious about the bed in the closet, but it was no problem. (Probably not a great fit for taller-than-average folks, though). Don't pass this place up - Especially if you're looking to explore the walkability of Seattle but would like to be a few floors above the street noise at night!"
3998984,43795705,2015-08-22,36022476,Richard,Amy was a great host. Also great location in belltown. Everything as described.

It was so conveniently located, and though there is no free street parking during the day, it was easy to part right in front of the door at night. Building and apartment were neat and safe. Everything was as described. I'd definitely stay here again!"
4180905,20474515,2014-09-29,2270493,Jan,"We had a great experience. This was our second stay with Tanya, which tells it all. Her place is our first choice for a place to stay.  She was welcoming, great with instructions, and very flexible. Her place is comfortable and clean. Communication was great.  Great location for exploring the city, many restaurants within walking distance, near transportation. Parking available diagonally across the street, very convenient.  I don't know what else you could ask for.  "
4180905,22625991,2014-11-10,4812169,Julie,Tanya was incredibly fast and easy to work with - if I had questions they were answered immediately and professionally. The apartment was very clean and well taken care of. Everything was easy - I'd stay again in an instant.

Anything you'd need is available within a couple blocks and it's easy to get into town from here. Everything checks out; the place was very comfortable.
4180905,28442509,2015-03-23,1217135,Ryan,"We spent two nights in Seattle at Tanya's place. Her apt is in a great location, with great restaurants and attractions all within walking distance. Her place was clean, tidy and most of all - comfortable. We felt right at home! If we make a journey back down to Seattle again Tanya's place will be at the top of our list. "
4180905,28684191,2015-03-28,29602706,Casey,"Our family felt super welcome in Tanya's place.  Key pick up was very easy.  Great neighborhood, proximity to Seattle Center, Space Needle, etc.  Would definitely stay again!  Thanks!"

Nice, clean apartment.  Looks just like the pictures.  The apartment complex and the neighborhood around was very safe.  "

4180905,32383411,2015-05-17,32052546,George,Tanya and her friend Charlotte were most gracious. We arrived after-hours and had the convenience of picking up the keys at a nearby hotel just a block away. The bed and the couch were both comfy - the place felt like home. Great location within walking distance to the water and most attractions. A couple of nice brunch and coffee places within walking distance as well as the majority of your tourist destinations. We hope to be back someday! Thank you!!

Great food shops around the apt. so you're never at a loss for what to eat! Tanya was great with communication and making sure that our needs were met throughout the entire process of staying at her apt. Since Tanya was out-of-town during our stay,  we were hosted by her good friend Charlotte. She is so warm, welcoming, and helpful from start to finish. The apt. is clean and well-kept too.

All in all, a great place to stay at for our Memorial Day weekend in Seattle (and for our first time using AirBnb). Thanks for making our stay there amazing!"
4180905,34317521,2015-06-07,1974714,Emily,"We had a great time staying in Tanya's apartment. It was centrally located and had everything we needed, including lots of information she left about the neighborhood and where to find things. Tanya was out of town while we were there, but she had her friend coordinate the key drop off. Because we arrived late at night they were able to leave our key at a hotel a block away for us to pick up- this for the most part worked smoothly, although the hotel receptionist was unaware of the setup and somewhat suspicious of us. "
4180905,35377510,2015-06-18,1495129,Kathy,Unfortunately I couldn't stay here and forfeited all but $30 of a $795 fee. Next time I will be more careful about strict cancellation policies. 
4180905,36103602,2015-06-25,28506824,Nathan,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Tanya's apartment for 4 nights. We had a wonderful experience and felt right at home in the apartment. The location was fantastic and the unit was very well maintained. Tanya's friend, Charlotte, went above and beyond to help make us feel comfortable during our stay. Overall it was a fantastic experience and made our visit to Seattle even more special."
4180905,36774127,2015-07-01,30808775,Kelsey,"The apartment was easily accessible and very homey. Lots of amenities and the rooftop had a nice view. About a mile or so walk to the market place and not far from the space needle. There are a few close restaurants and marketplace for food and rinks. Just happened to be in Seattle when the temperatures were in the 80's/90's and no air conditioning in the building/apartment, which made is slightly difficult to sleep, but overall a very nice stay. Thank you."
4180905,37847490,2015-07-11,16187300,Neal,It was great!
4180905,38167316,2015-07-13,28780884,Kaori,"The host was flexible with handing me the keys, which was great because we could plan without worrying about having to be at the apartment at a certain time. The location is great, close to downtown but not loud at night. The apartment is very cute and cozy!"
4180905,38709335,2015-07-18,15790505,Rachel,"We had a great time staying at this apartment! The location was perfect- one block from the Seattle Center.  Great kitchen, comfortable bed, stylish, clean, wi-fi, laundry. Swift communication, easy key exchange. We loved the rooftop deck and the friendly people of Seattle.  This is a prime place to stay and we hope to be back! "
4180905,39169987,2015-07-21,34134337,Julia,"Tanya's friend, Charlotte, met us to hand off the key and give us a walkthrough of the apartment - check in and check out went very smoothly. The apartment is as nice as advertised and is situated in a walkable neighborhood (Lower Queen Anne), close to South Lake Union, Belltown, and Downtown Seattle. We enjoyed an evening walk up to Molly Moon's for ice cream, stopping at Kerry Park for amazing views along the way. It was very hot during our visit to Seattle (~90 F at 8PM!), but even though the apartment didn't have AC, we were able to stay cool with the ceiling fan on and the balcony doors open. I'd definitely recommend Tanya's apartment to anyone looking for somewhere to stay in the area. "
4180905,40207137,2015-07-29,14609796,Sue,"Great location, comfy bed, and quiet time for sleep. This was a fantastic stay. Nice clean apartment, exactly as described. Would stay again.  Thank you!"
4180905,40763761,2015-08-02,13140034,Alan,We stayed at Tanya's for our very first airbnb experience and it has set high expectations for my future stays! Her place was conveniently located near good food and the main Seattle attractions. Communication was great throughout with her friend Charlotte coordinating the key dropoff. Would definitely stay here again if we ever drop by again from Sydney :)
4180905,42277625,2015-08-12,23222919,Alexandra,"First Airbnb experience was a great one. 

Tanya's place was immaculate when we arrived and check in went smoothly. We were getting in at about 10:30pm and she had a deal worked out where we could pick the keys up at a hotel down the street. 

The neighborhood is very walkable with lots of grocery stores, restaurants and things to do close by. The apartment does not have AC (like many places in Seattle) but we were fine opening the windows and using the fans provided. 

Would highly recommend and would stay here if we're ever in Seattle again! "
4180905,42725778,2015-08-15,17383796,Sophie,"Great location in a really nice a quiet part of town. Seriously, so quiet - we've never been in such a central and quiet airbnb! And the bed is super comfortable! Tanya's place also has everything you'd need for a longer stay (great kitchen equipment etc). The apartment is quite hot, but if you run the fans and keep the windows open it's ok."
4180905,43277414,2015-08-18,7272852,Jessica,"Tanya is the best host!  She is so accommodating and her place is great!  Awesome location; quiet neighborhood but close enough to walk/catch the monorail to the action.  She has a cute patio with a grill that I would have loved to use, but there's just too many good places in Seattle to go out to eat!  I would highly recommend her place!  Plus, she has the best sense of style...love how her place is decorated!"
4180905,44158359,2015-08-24,2504493,Andres,"Tanya was an amazing host that made us feel very comfortable and that genuinely cared about our wellbeing during our stay at her apartment. She was very informative before our trip, was able to accommodate her schedule to receive us (even though we arrived later than expected), and was understanding and helpful at the end of the trip so we could make a late check-out.

Also, she takes very good care of her apartment and she expects her guests to be thoughtful and considerate with her space. This helps in keeping the apartment in perfect condition for each new group of guests. We loved staying here because it felt just like home. Clean. Warm. Authentic.

Additionally, the place has a magnificent location. It's very close to the Seattle Center—and its impressive Space Needle—and at walking distance from downtown. Also, you can find dozens of good restaurants and inspiring coffee places in the area.

Staying here was the best decision we could make to fully enjoy this city full of wonders."
4180905,46175038,2015-09-08,32841486,Dan,Lovely place right by City Center. I would totally rent it again. 
4180905,47854811,2015-09-21,43888830,Daniel,"Fantastic experience ! This was my first air b n b. Tanya , your apartment is in a great location and has everything closeby. Thanks for the hospitality we definitely enjoyed Seattle , would recommend !! "
4180905,48543473,2015-09-27,37834117,Pat,"Tanya was a great host! As a first-time AirBnB-er I appreciate that she took a chance on me! She made the process so easy and communicated well prior to the stay. All the info she sent ahead of time was useful in planning my trip. Her apartment is exactly as she describes, and is very homey and casual. 

Check in was smooth and easy. Access to her apartment is secure and private, but very simple. She has umbrellas there, but I never needed one; she ordered perfect autumn weather!  

Her location is terrific. Not knowing anything about the city, I’m glad I settled on Lower Queen Anne. It is a perfect base for exploring so much. She provided tips on where to go and how to get around, including her favorite eating spots. I felt completely safe in the neighborhood and was at home in the local bars and restaurants. Seattle Center is about 5-8 minute walk, and it was very doable to go there in the evening after dinner to see Chihuly at night. The walk up to Kerry Park she recommended was up hill, but completely worth it. 

Tanya thought of everything, even how to use her multiple remotes for the tv, bluray, and streaming. Her unit is clean and the bed is very comfortable. I didn’t use the little balcony, but it is a great option. Also, the sliding doors give an open, airy feeling. I would definitely rent from her again! 
"
4180905,54198040,2015-11-16,22522139,Tuana,"Tanya made us feel very welcome and gave us some great tips on things to do while in Seattle.  Her place was very clean and cozy!  Great location, too.  My friend Katie and I had a very nice stay."
991961,4008347,2013-04-02,644269,David,I stayed here for two weeks with two work colleagues and this place was absolutely wonderful! The views from the room overlook the Olympic Mountains and there is a pool and Jacuzzi in the building. Highly recommended!
991961,4620056,2013-05-15,1755793,Cecelia,"What a great place to stay!  The views are INCREDIBLE, and the place is super modern, sleek, and also comfortable.  Can't recommend it more!"
991961,8363285,2013-10-28,2700652,Barbara,"Great condo, close to everything in downtown Seattle!  Beautiful decor, very clean, very spacious.  Fabulous views.  With windows closed, hardly noisy at all.  All mod-cons, huge wide-screen TV, etc.  Fastest internet I have ever experienced.  Listen carefully when your host meets you and takes you through all the electronic stove, gadgets, etc because they are the latest.  

Very helpful concierge(s) 24/7.  Nice to have shared business office to do last minute printing of airline check-in. Only a short 5 minute walk to the Washington Conference Centre.  

I will definitely book this condo again if another conference is scheduled in Seattle, much better value than the hotels if you can stay a week."
991961,10629993,2014-02-28,8527490,Krassen,The reservation was canceled 114 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
991961,22155751,2014-10-31,6887596,Chris,"Smooth reception, great location, great stay. Literally a stones throw from the market and a a short walk to any neighborhood you want to go to in the Seattle area. The hosts are very professional and warmly provide assistance to enhance your stay in any way they can. The apartment is super clean, very nice and has the best amenities possible."
991961,36008431,2015-06-24,592134,Kunal,"What a fantastic experience! As this was our second trip via airbnb, Darik, Sally, Sarah, Ruri and the team were very accommodating to all our questions.  The suite was immaculate - Very beautifully furnished, and had all the amenities we needed to really feel at home.  Location-wise, the suite is located within minutes from Pike Market (excellent fish place!).

Definitely recommend this unit, and hopefully will stay here again on our future travels.

Thankyou Darik, Sally, Sarah, Ruri and the team!"
991961,55352973,2015-12-01,14421055,Basak,"Beautiful condo with a stunning view of the Puget Sound. The unit is clean and well-appointed with high-end appliances that take some time to figure out. Both bedrooms are spacious and comfortable and the kitchen was stocked with essential items on our arrival. Having a garage space was key as additional parking is hard to find/expensive in that area. Target and the Pike Place Market are easily accessible, as are lots of downtown tourist attractions. In booking the stay, you will have several points of contact (all through Seattle Oasis Vacation Rentals), but they are very prompt in responding to questions."
5625964,33975621,2015-06-02,4873522,Katie,"Jill and John were excellent hosts and very knowledgeable about the area! Their home is beautiful, parking was very easy, and there are so many shops and restaurants within walking distance. Their description was definitely accurate. I had a wonderful experience staying at their place and will definitely stay with them again! "
5625964,34507406,2015-06-08,24859835,Tracy,"Wow!  If my future hosts all turn out to be as wonderful as Jill and John, then I will no longer ever consider googling hotels.  These two have the kindest hearts.  From the moment I entered their home and was greeted by a home-cooked dinner, to the thoughtful gesture of leaving me a bar of chocolate, these two are amazing!
  Room was cozy and lived even better then its photo.  The Landmark seminar I was attending was a 12 mins. walk down the street.  They are tucked away from the partying of the Freemont district but perfect distance to enjoy its festivities.  Coffee shop and bus stop are only one block away!  Stay here - you won't be disappointed!"
5625964,34740035,2015-06-11,34792764,Zack,"Jill and John were incredible hosts. Their home was very nice and they went out of their way to make me feel welcome.  They were full of kindness, offering to help me out in numerous ways as I was relocating to Seattle.  They truly went above and beyond what was required of them. "
5625964,35012417,2015-06-14,18973920,Chao,"I really enjoy the stay in their house. The room is very comfort. Its place is perfect to see beautiful scenery in Fremont. And the transportation to downtown is convenient. Last but the most important, Jill and John are very nice and welcome! Hope to stay with them, when I stay in Seattle next time!"
5625964,35333742,2015-06-17,22633405,Roger,V clean n quiet neighbourhood. Easy to take the bus to town. Parking is free n u wud feel safe. Value for money stay. Our rating wud b 4 STARS! 
5625964,36206254,2015-06-26,33171428,Aidan,"Jill and John are very warm and welcoming. This was our first Airbnb experience and it could have not gone better. The house was easy to find, the room very comfortable and conveniently located (by the front door so you do not risk disturbing anyone should you return late) and the living space offered a wonderful view and ambiance to drink your morning coffee. The bus downtown is a block away and there are some coffee shops and cafes just as close. My only regret is that we did not stay longer. We will definitely be looking into staying here again should we return to Seattle."
5625964,36430388,2015-06-28,6819684,Ross,"Had a great stay with Jill and John. Their place is lovely and clean. A great location to explore Seattle. We had a whirlwind trip and didn't see them much, but would recommend their place to anyone!"
5625964,36976268,2015-07-03,1971733,Caroline,"Jill and John made us (fellow hosts!) feel very welcome - we'd rented out our house, needed a nearby place to stay and so we were lucky to have them so close!  Jill  and I had easy communication before our arrival, she showed us around when we got there, we had a nice conversation with both Jill and John, and they were easy to share space with..Of course, the location is great, their home is spacious with a nice upper floor with a view of the mountains and sunsets, and our bedroom was perfect....."
5625964,37187955,2015-07-05,19065661,Kaya,Jill and John were great hosts! Very accommodating and respectful. We wish were able to extend our trip! It is a great location for a short stay; clean and bare necessities :)
