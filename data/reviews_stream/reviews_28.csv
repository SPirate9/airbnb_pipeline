It was unusually stormy for the first few days we were there, and Lauren's place was a great retreat.   She also provided us with great recommendations for food and navigating the city. Thanks so much for going above and beyond, Lauren! "
397117,56099350,2015-12-08,29128859,Sarita,"Lauren was very accommodating and helpful. Her place is very quaint! I loved the location of her apartment. It was really easy getting to where I needed to go. Her place was clean and warm on the cold night that I stayed there. The only thing was that the bed sheets smelled strongly like thrift shop (like skin and scalp oils), but overall, I had a great experience for my short time there. I highly recommend staying at Lauren's if you're visiting Seattle!"
397117,56883197,2015-12-19,49673051,Tom,"While we never met in person, Lauren was very easy to communicate with and replied in a very timely manner. The check in for the room was very hassle free and straightforward, and the place itself was very lovely. Very comfortable, and my only complaint was that I didn't stay longer."

Would definitely book again when we're back in Seattle!  Thank you so much for opening up your home to our group.  Nothing but a positive experience!  And, loved the view!!  "
8227710,53213795,2015-11-06,31231229,Colin,"Great location and a lovely lake front house.

Served the 4 of us perfectly travelling on business, plenty of space, great surroundings, and very nicely furnished and comfortable.

Some minor work needed on bathroom finish."
4664312,25341443,2015-01-12,25739891,Josh & José,"Husband and I stayed at Tommy and Tim's place for 3 nights.  They were first time hosts and we were first time guests.

Bus Route 66 and 24-hour Safeway grocery are one block away.  Route 66 was $2.50 per person and a 30 min ride to downtown Seattle.

Friendly and easy going, kicked our butts in Wii Mario Kart.  2 big comfy and clean couches to sleep on with plenty of blankets and pillows.  

The bathroom is between Tommy and Tim's bedrooms- and they are perfectly fine with you walking through either of their rooms to get to the bathroom (even while they're sleeping).

We would stay there again."
4664312,32040721,2015-05-12,17656128,Koa,"Tim and his roommate had blankets and pillows all ready for us and offered some nice suggestions for places nearby. Close to the interstate for easy access to downtown. Would stay again.

8195629,48605116,2015-09-27,8186696,Kristina,"Camellia's tender home is located in the best location in Seattle.  Some of the city's best restaurants, shopping and coffee are located within walking distance.  The home is private, sweet and literally like your home away from home.  I want to stay here everytime I come back, it was a dream.
"
8195629,50378793,2015-10-11,40447798,Laura,We had a great stay at Camellia's house.  It was beautiful and clean--exactly what we expected.  The neighborhood was safe and close to everything we wanted to do in Seattle.  We would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it to friends.  
8195629,52565144,2015-10-30,39948303,Kayla,"This this little cozy cottage nestled in Capital Hill was a gem. It's a beautiful home, very quiet, I left safe and could walk to anything. Definitely stay here if your looking for a great AirBNB in an awesome location. "

8195629,54388460,2015-11-19,20283810,Suki,"Camellia was very flexible with our visit and a delight to deal with. The house was clean and as described, but was cold and the heat took awhile to kick in (plenty of blankets were available). Great location and quiet neighbourhood. "
8195629,54543624,2015-11-21,14545031,Hoi Ting,It is a wonderful place since it is close to downtown. And Camellia is really nice:)
8195629,54626420,2015-11-22,26360243,Stella,"Camellia was out of the country during our stay, but very detailed and pleasant throughout our written communication. Her friend was nearby in case we needed anything, but her accommodations met our needs just fine. Her place is clean and cute, and in a great location near the wedding we attended at Shafer Baillie Mansion. She also included a list of her favorite places for food and drinks. The pullout twin bed was perfect for our 11 yr. old son, and the queen bed provided a great night's sleep. Hot water was not an issue for three consecutive showers, not to mention wonderful water pressure. Finding parking was not always easy, but it was to be expected since it's in the city. At most we parked a block away with her guest parking pass. Safe, clean neighborhood. We would definitely stay again!"
8195629,55136994,2015-11-28,48431977,Nicole,Thank u so much for letting us stay in your lovely quaint home. We hope to be able to stay again in the future. God bless Nicole n Joseph Salcido.

6246861,33526094,2015-05-29,22915244,Ankit,My experience in Seattle was pretty comfortable. We were there to visit a conference and this place was very close to the washington state convention centre.

6246861,34685004,2015-06-10,5349196,Laura,"James was the most fantastic Airbnb host I have ver had! He was accommodating to my request for an early check in per my flight arrival with a small baby. When we showed up, I immediately felt comfortable and well taken care of; it seemed like we were old friends catching up. The apartment it very quaint and spacious actually. No that LOCATION! Cannot beat it. There are so many amazing restaurants, shops and so forth surrounding the apartment. It was the perfect spot for my daughter and I to stay and experience Capitol Hill."
6246861,34872246,2015-06-13,18066778,Heather,"This little studio is in an excellent location on Cap Hill, perfect for two people. Very clean and simple, modern decor. James was an amazing host! He was able to check us in early, met us at the apartment, and even gave us a welcome treat! He left excellent tips (which would be perfect for a newcomer to the city) for exploring, eating, transportation...he really went above and beyond as a host. I'd highly recommend his place and if I need a place to stay in Seattle again I'd definitely return to his!"
6246861,35001219,2015-06-14,33713125,Hillary,"James was awesome! Would definitely recommend the place! In the heart of seattle, perfect location in Capitol Hill "

James was incredibly communicative throughout my stay and made me feel very welcome.  I highly recommend James as a host and will definitely be contacting him again when I am back in Seattle."
6246861,35494798,2015-06-19,20320807,Nicholas,Had a wonderful time in Seattle and James' place is perfectly situated in the heart of the action. Make sure to get some recommendations from him beforehand as there's lots to do it in the neighbourhood! Lots of nearby parking.
6246861,35691387,2015-06-21,6593046,Roberto,We had a very pleasant experience. The location is centric and within walking distance to all main downtown attractions. James provided is with great restaurant and itinerary suggestions and was always available.

On top of that James recommended some stellar places to drink and eat. Besides that, the apartment was extremely clean and welcoming. Located in the best neighborhood in Seattle. I will definitely be staying there again!"

6246861,36114796,2015-06-25,25500393,Jason,Our stay was nice.  Everything was as described.  We didn't realize that there were three flights of stairs to walk up and no elevator until we got here although the elevator amenity had been removed upon further examination.  James offered the best local restaurant and tourist info of any AirBNB experience I've ever had.
6246861,36254101,2015-06-26,16718244,David,"James' place was ideally located, clean, cool, cozy and well stocked for everything we needed for a quick night in the city. This was during a busy work day in which we had limited time and James was wonderfully accommodating in getting us situated, also providing a lot of great feedback about the surrounding environs. Definitely recommended!"
6246861,36421038,2015-06-28,34069492,Phoebe,James was a wonderful host! He was quick to respond to my messages/questions. He gave a list of recommendations for places to eat and places to explore. The apartment was the perfect size for my three friends and myself. We were in a great spot for exploring. The apartment included a parking pass and has a fantastic air conditioner that was necessary with 90 degrees fahrenheit outside!
6246861,36808362,2015-07-01,18230424,Lois,"James was a great host for my stay in Seattle. He was traveling at the time himself, but never failed to check in or respond promptly to any questions we had. He provided a full list of good recommendations from things to see, what to do and what to eat. The studio was clean and comfortable for a two person stay. Will definitely look him up again when visiting Seattle."
6246861,36908167,2015-07-02,33815731,Jeong,"James was a very friendly host to respond our askings.. introducing famous visits, restaurants.. providing free wine and coffee.. We enjoyed the place.."
6246861,37344963,2015-07-06,14352155,Tushar,James has a wonderful apartment very close to Pike place market which was a big plus! He also helped me plan my tour in Seattle and his recommendations really helped. I enjoyed my family vacation and we had a fun time thanks to this cute little place on Capitol hill.
6246861,37506784,2015-07-07,2498773,Derek,"I loved staying at James' apartment. From booking to check in to check out, everything was easy. I appreciated all the little things he did to make my stay a great one. "

6246861,37862996,2015-07-11,34210268,Paul,"Cute apartment in the middle of a very hip neighborhood.  Clean. Kitchen provided many basics like coffee, tea, spices.   Lots of extra towels and linen in cupboard.  Shampoo and conditioner provided. Many restaurants within 5 minute walking distance.  Owner will provide you with a list of restaurants close by.  We walked down to Pike's Market several times and it took about 15 minutes.  We were visiting Seattle University and that was a 10-15 minute walk.  A bottle of Seattle wine and a big jug of bottled water provided!  Owner was super flexible about checkout.  "
6246861,38162570,2015-07-13,25875446,Verena,"My family of 4 stayed here during our visit to Seattle. The apartment was nice, but was smaller than what we expected. Would not recommend for 4 people, but definitely a great place for 2-3 people."
6246861,38512890,2015-07-16,19235033,Billy,"James was a really great host - incredibly responsive and offered an extensive list of restaurant, coffee shop, and bar recommendations in the area. Very comfortable and spacious apartment in a lively neighborhood, but quiet and removed from busy streets.

Would definitely stay here again! Highly recommended."
6246861,38642438,2015-07-17,37189282,Marla,"This was our first Airbnb stay and it was WONDERFUL!  The apartment was perfect - Simple, beautiful, and with everything we needed. James was a great host and gave us any ideas of ways to enjoy our stay.  We were able to walk to all the places we wanted to visit including the famous Pike Place Market!  We are already planning another trip and want to stay here again!! Thanks James"
6246861,38852380,2015-07-19,16310127,Vinita,"We had an awesome stay at James's place in the hip and friendly neighborhood of Capitol Hill! I highly recommend his place for a fun weekend stay in Seattle or if you have a week or so to stay in the city. Cabs and Ubers were easy to find and there is an awesome ""Starbucks reserve"" around the corner from his place. James was wonderful to work with and I hope my next Air BNB stays are as fabulous! I highly recommend staying with James.'"
6246861,39503173,2015-07-24,26102934,科,"Great stay at this apartment,James gave us very good suggestions and informations in the area and we really felt at home here.Thanks again for everything and the location was perfect!I am looking forward to returning."
6246861,39759803,2015-07-26,33769219,Savannah,James was a great host! He gave us lots of great suggestions for bars/food/activities and information on how to get to and from the airport (which was super helpful). The neighborhood was in a great location pretty central to everything. We had a bottle of wine waiting for us which was a nice little surprise. I would book with James again if I am ever in Seattle. 
6246861,40123710,2015-07-28,228018,Franz,"We had a wonderful time in Seattle, and staying at James' place kept us close to everything. It's around the corner from great coffee; Victrola and the Starbucks Roastery. It's a pretty basic apartment building, but the suite had everything we needed. Nice bedding, everything very clean, as described. The kitchen is very small, so don't plan on doing any big meals. That's no problem because this place is right on Capitol Hill, with plenty of great restaurants within walking distance. James was also very helpful in getting us there, sending me a free Uber ride. Stay here to be close to downtown and Capitol hill at the best price."
6246861,40357953,2015-07-30,37599937,Erin,"The apartment was very cute and in an awesome location. The bed was super comfortable, as was the futon. There were several great coffee shops and restaurants right around the corner and it was an easy walk to Pike Place Market. The only downside to staying here was the construction noise early in the morning.  James was an excellent host and I would love to stay here again. "
6246861,40926211,2015-08-03,13164359,Mongkol,"We really enjoyed our stay at James'. His place is cozy and very tastefully decorated. The place comes with a nice kitchen and dining area and a small office space for those who need to work. 

James was also a very pleasant host. He was great at communication and would promptly respond to any of our queries.

All in all, we really enjoyed our stay with James. We look forward to coming back again in the near future.
"
6246861,41122228,2015-08-04,787203,Paula,"James's apartment is wonderful!  We really enjoyed staying there. It's right in the middle of downtown, walking distance to Pike Place and the waterfront. The location is perfect.   James is really nice and very helpful.  He gave us a warm welcome and lots of information about the area.  Would recommend James's place 100%."
6246861,41616991,2015-08-08,14251547,Sara & Alex,"James' apartment was a great home base for our stay in Seattle. Not only are there many great places within minutes' walking distance, it is centrally located. The apartment was very clean and James clearly takes pride in providing for his guests. He was easy reachable and responsive during our stay - including great recommendations around the city. Highly recommend for any stay in Seattle!"
6246861,42385990,2015-08-13,32919320,Piotr,"James was an exceptionally friendly, helpful and welcoming host. To start with, he was very prompt to respond to emails pre-arrival, and his check-in instructions were precise and clear. What I also found very helpful were his recommendations for places to eat in the neighbourhood of the apartment.

Upon arrival at Seattle airport, it turned out that my bag had been delayed. On hearing the news, James immediately offered to pick up my bag from the airport once it arrived later, did so the next day and brought the bag in person to the apartment. He did not charge extra for it. As if this was not enough, he also in fact picked me up (for free) from the airport as he happened to be driving past it shortly after my arrival. All incredibly helpful, and made my stay in Seattle one level easier.

The location of the apartment was great - in an ""up and coming"" part of town, close to interesting independent cafes and restaurants, and a 10-minute walk to downtown.

The apartment itself was charming, functional, and had all I needed for my 4-day business stay. The kitchen was well-equipped and I was able to cook some simple meals. The air-con was in working order, and strong enough. The wireless internet was fast and problem-free. There was a wooden floor throughout. Basic toiletries and towels were provided. There was very little noticeable noise coming from outside.

Overall, it was a very nice experience and I would not hesitate to stay there again.
"
6246861,42682662,2015-08-15,24204012,Paul,"Great stay, thanks James!"
6246861,42870707,2015-08-16,36895228,Richard,"Stayed here with a group of three. The room was clean, nicely decorated, well maintained, and as advertised. The bed was comfortable. There were nice touches that you don't find in a standard hotel room, like fluffy soft towels and a bowl of fruit."
6246861,43491860,2015-08-20,14156614,Sean,"James was easy to communicate with and very accommodating.  The apartment was clean and besides some construction on the building next door, it was very quiet.  It was a relatively easy walk to the convention center and there are many places to eat and drink nearby."
6246861,44289456,2015-08-25,31817764,Jody,"Listing as described in Capitol Hill (very convenient location with lots to do).  James was a wonderful host!  He gave me a listing of restaurants, coffee shops, and bars.  Also best way to get  around and get from airport.  There was coffee and condiments, fruit, a wonderful oversized bottle of water, and toiletries.  Would definitely stay here again."
6246861,46569260,2015-09-11,4767595,Amber,"James place was great - very clean and centrally located. Lots of cute bars, eats, and shopping within walking distance. He was also a great communicator before we arrived. Normally he has a two-night minimum, but we were desperate and looking for a place to stay at the extremely last minute - James was nice enough to bend his rules and share his home with us. There is construction going on next door, which started around 7AM - not a deal breaker by any means, just good to know. Thanks for giving us a place to rest in Seattle, James!"
6246861,46816858,2015-09-13,43394720,Marc,"James was a solid host to have and was accommodating to our needs. He checked in a few times during our stay to make sure that everything was working out as well as providing suggestions for things to do in the area.

The apartment we stayed in was very tidy and simple. It had all the basics which was just what we were looking for. Above all it was in the perfect location. After finding a good parking spot just a few minutes walk away from the apartment we didn't go back to our car until we drove home at the end of the weekend.  "
6246861,47116662,2015-09-15,4952394,Jacob,Great place and great location! 
6246861,47356555,2015-09-18,24814073,Carissa,"James is a very friendly and helpful host. He is extremely prompt to respond to all pre-trip emails. His instructions for self check in were very easy to follow.

The apartment is located in a great part of the city. It's a very easy walk to the main tourist areas (Pike Place Market , Shopping Pike/Pine Streets and Columbia Tower). There are lots of great cafes and restaurants very close by (Victrola , Starbucks Roastery & Homegrown).
The apartment itself is very clean and well equipped. James is a very generous host and provides starter shampoo/conditioner/toothpaste. There is also a hair dryer. The kitchen is big enough to make small meals. There is plenty of room for 3 people (my 11 year old son slept comfortably on the futon lounge). The apartment felt very safe and the wifi connection is excellent (probably better than many hotels). 

I would recommend James apartment 100% and I would definitely stay there again when visiting Seattle."
6246861,47777864,2015-09-21,9579690,Maya,"James was a great host - friendly, available for any questions and made our stay easy as first-time Seattle tourists. The location was perfect for getting around town and is located close to a number of bars, cafes and local coffee roasters. The apartment itself is simple, quaint and beats a hotel room. 

I'd stay here again! Thanks, James."
6246861,48156027,2015-09-23,3399328,Carly,"James Place was extremely convenient, tidy, He made the whole process extremely easy. Would definitely recommend staying at his place. "
6246861,48922136,2015-09-29,43023537,Anthony,"James' place was great. It's not the largest space but big enough and has everything you could need.

James was a really helpful host with lots of great info about ths area and ideas of things to do during my stay."
6246861,49475866,2015-10-04,8651461,Colin,"James was a helpful host, and worked hard to make sure I was comfortable for my stay. The place itself is very nice. There was construction going on next door, so if you're sensitive to noise it might not be ideal. If that sort of thing doesn't bother you then its perfect. Location is amazing. Room very comfortable. "
6246861,50011777,2015-10-08,7571045,Marjorie,Our experience in James' place was wonderful. He greeted us when we arrived and was helpful in giving us local recommendations. The apartment was neat and clean and centrally located in the city. We would certainly stay here again:)
6246861,50107461,2015-10-09,12962786,Sally,"There was some initial issues getting in (key wasn't in assigned location) but we eventually figured it out and James reimbursed us for part of the night. He was responsive despite being away and the apartment was clean, cute and in a great location. "
6246861,50483691,2015-10-12,43362745,Virginia,James was great in responding to emails.  The place was accurate to the description.  Everything in the apartment was clean and well taken care of.  The building itself is an old building so we had some trouble with the keys in the door of the apartment as well as in the building itself.  Other than that it was a comfortable place to stay.
6246861,51044944,2015-10-17,11344635,David,James' place was perfect for my girlfriend and I. It was a five minute (if even) walk from the convention center and perfectly located for sightseeing and restaurants. The apartment was neat and check-in/out were both super easy. We never got the opportunity to meet James but he texted us while we were there and made himself readily available if we had any questions. I highly recommend staying here.
6246861,51458448,2015-10-20,16113242,Sondra,"James place looks exactly as it does in the photos. It's super cute and clean, its such a great space. My two friends and I stayed here and we had plenty of room. The friend that slept on the couch said it was really comfortable too! I think the absolute best part about this spot though is the LOCATION! We walked to Pikes Market from here and all around Capitol Hill. Tons of great things right at your doorstep. I would highly recommend staying here. "
6246861,51829331,2015-10-24,29929835,Annie,"A wonderful experience staying at James's apartment in Seattle indeed!  Everything started long before I checked in - when I enquired about the apartment and my stay, James was super prompt in his response and provided me with very useful and helpful information.  He was very caring all throughout the process of finalizing the rental arrangements.  The apartment is tastefully furnished.  The bed is heavenly.  Wifi is great and the TV with its many services provide exceptional entertainment options.  I did spend one evening, out of 3 evenings in the apartment, just watching the TV!  The neighbourhood is excellent with different dining options.  It is also very convenient to walk downtown, e.g. to the Pike Place Market, as it only takes me about half an hour walking leisurely.  Walking back to the apartment, although uphill, is still very pleasant!  Would wish to come back here next time I visit Seattle!  Thank you, James.  You are a great host! "
6246861,52234953,2015-10-27,43903455,Conor,"James was a great host. The apartment was exactly as described/pictured, and in a really convenient part of Seattle. I'd definitely stay here again."

6246861,53166115,2015-11-05,43666185,Shanta,"James was a wonderful host. Not only was it my first time in Seattle, but also my first time using air bnb. James was very accommodating and helpful. 

As for the apartment, the pictures don't do it justice. It's an adorable very clean and well kept studio truly in a fantastic part of town. Wish I could've stayed longer! Will definitely be back."
6246861,53671224,2015-11-10,27072885,Justin,I had a great stay! The place was in such a prime location close to all the great food spots and lots of things to do. The space was great and very comfortable. James was such a good host and very helpful. Checking in and out was a breeze and I would definitely come back for another stay. 
6246861,53736385,2015-11-11,2677945,Reuben,Great neighbourhood; great host; perfect little place for our one night stay.
6246861,53798730,2015-11-12,36273,Dylan,"The inside of the apartment looks cute and clean just like the pictures.  I was a little surprised at how rundown the interior of the building was compared to how nice it was inside the actual apartment.  James made booking, check-in, and check-out very easy.  I also appreciated that he doesn't actually live in the apartment."
6246861,54250344,2015-11-17,30967921,Travis,The place was a great location for hanging out in Seattle and James was quite accommodating to our travel plans both arriving and departing. The room came with even more than described and I will definitely stay here if I travel to Seattle in the future.
6246861,54401510,2015-11-19,2402963,Stavros,"Cute, clean, and convenient apartment in a great part of Seattle. Clean and simple furniture, with one neat and quirky art work (I'll leave it as a surprise). James was very welcoming, inviting me out for a drink as soon as I arrived. The apartment had everything you need: comfortable bed, reliable and fast WiFi, clean everything, even a full kitchen.

The one thing to keep in mind is parking. On-street pay parking is limited to two hours at a time. Overnight (8pm-8am) is free, and you can pre-pay 8am-10am the previous evening after 10pm. I didn't look in to off-street parking, but James can give you advice on all this."
6246861,54628541,2015-11-22,2059036,Michael,"Cute, cozy, and clean. Great location with excellent places to eat, drink, and shop around the corner. Touristy stuff within walking distance, too. "
6246861,54958325,2015-11-25,49044114,Eli,"Everything was awesome.  The apartment was fantastic, the bed comfortable, the kitchen functional, the shower endlessly warm, and the host, James very accommodating and friendly.  Checking in and out was totally painless.  I would recommend this venue to even the most persnickety people."
6246861,55392387,2015-12-01,338701,Heather,"James was an excellent host and the apartment was exactly as described. We had a great time exploring the neighborhood, and all of his recommendations were on point! The location absolutely can't be beat - we walked everywhere and had a ton of great coffee shops, restaurants, and shops nearby. Would stay here again!"
6246861,56000318,2015-12-07,44852261,Matthew,"James was an excellent host!  He worked with us to coordinate check-in and check-out, provided a ton of great recommendations, and shared his excellent apartment!  Great location, apartment just as pictured, absolutely had a great time in Seattle and would stay here again the next time I visit!"
6246861,56253837,2015-12-11,48912732,승원,"미리 보내준 내용을 토대로 숙소를 찾는데 무리 없었습니다. James는 궁금했던 내용에 대해 직접 전화를 해서 확인해 주는 등 매우 친절하였습니다. 숙소는 쾌적하였고, 저는 혼자 머물렀지만 여러명이 함께 지내도 될만큼 충분하였습니다. 숙소가 위치한 곳은 다운타운에서 약간 떨어져 있었지만 걸어서 다운타운 및 다른 관광지를 둘러보는데 충분히 가까웠고, 주위 분위기는 오히려 다운타운보다 좋았습니다. 다만, 숙소 바로 옆에 공사가 진행중이었는데, 늦은 저녁에는 크게 시끄럽거나 방해가 되는 정도는 아니었습니다. "
6246861,56395537,2015-12-13,4209615,Nikolas,"James was an INCREDIBLE host. He was there to greet us at the apartment, and was in communication immediately when we needed anything. I could not have imagined a better experience while exploring a new city. I will definitely be staying with him again when I return to Seattle. "
6246861,56797323,2015-12-18,30204405,Jasmine,My stay was great. The neighborhood was very nice with lots of great bars and restaurants. The space was clean and everything that I needed for my short stay in Seattle. James put up with my request to have my friend get the key and then having the time of meet up change due to weather/plans.
6246861,57379140,2015-12-25,11180795,Robert,"The listing accurately describes the property and James is a good host.  The apartment was reasonably large (400-500 sq ft?), clean, and in a well tended building.  James was readily available should you need to contact him.
"
6246861,57533920,2015-12-27,4804333,Holly,"Everything was very smooth, despite the challenges of a Christmas day arrival. The apt was very much what I expected, small but with everything we needed. The bed is quite comfortable, the fold-down couch somewhat less so! The location cannot be beat--right off the freeway and walking distance to anything we'd need. It's an apartment building, and smells and sounds travel. We could hear people coming home late, and if you're uncomfortable with the smell of pot, it might not be the place for you! The smell's ubiquitous in Portland and not a problem for us. James gave us a list of nearby restaurants, and we tried Stateside which was AWESOME. Sad we can't eat there again soon. We will definitely try to stay again when we visit."
6246861,58579964,2016-01-03,49020656,Coreena,"My husband and I had a great stay at James' place. James was an excellent host! He was attentive, hospitible, and very responsive. We also really enjoyed exploring Capitol Hill and downtown Seattle was just a 10 minute walk away. I would definitely recommend staying at James' place!"
8612922,49740159,2015-10-05,43138742,Tanya,"Kendall was a great host! She was very helpful with tips on places to visit for our first time in Seattle. Her home was very cozy and welcoming. The Airbnb was for the basement with a bedroom and pullout couch. Slept 4 very comfortably. Great location: walkable distance from the beautiful University of Washington with easy access to bike shares and cheap Uber rides into the city. Highly recommend staying here. (Also, Kendall makes amazing cookies!)"
8612922,49959863,2015-10-07,6949495,Chen,"We (a friend I was travelling with) and myself had a great time at Kendall's.  The neighborhood is beautiful as is the house and the space we got.  Very spacious and comfortable.  Kendall helped with some tips on Seattle while I shared some tips of a seasoned AirBnb traveler - all in all, we had a great experience and will be happy to return.

The unit is exactly as posted and very clean. The separate entrance is very convenient if you intend to come and go without wanting to disturb the host's family.


"
8612922,51356394,2015-10-19,2073071,Matt,Kendall and Chris have a really great basement setup less than a mile from Husky Stadium. The hospitality and communication was excellent.
8612922,52298485,2015-10-27,46979475,Kevin,"Kendall was a gracious host and the accommodations were spacious and immaculate. The location is very quiet and convenient to UW, Children's Hospital, and shopping. I would stay there again in a heartbeat. Kendall bakes yummy cookies!"
8612922,52882299,2015-11-02,46328499,Rachael," Kendall had a wonderful set up for us.   It was warm, it was cozy, it was clean.    We also knew what to expect Kendall kept us very informed.
Plenty of space and we loved the cookies.
"
8612922,53188676,2015-11-06,18679871,Michael,"My wife, two young children, and I stayed in Kendall's basement floor Airbnb while in Seattle for a quick trip to nearby Seattle Children's Hospital. The space was very clean had everything we needed for a comfortable stay in a pleasant, quiet neighborhood. We enjoyed the proximity to Union Bay Natural Area for an evening nature walk and fun playing with the ping pong table set up in the living space. Two of us used the bed in the bedroom (which was very cozy), and while one of the couches in the living space was a foldout bed, two of us opted to just kick it on the couches. We picked up goods at Trader Joe's and used the microwave, fridge, plates, silverware, and dining table for a nice dinner. 

We did not meet Kendall while coming and going, but knew she was available for any help if needed. We'll consider staying here again on future trips to Seattle!"
8612922,54261714,2015-11-17,2189683,Will And Lynne,"Kendall has a lovely, well-maintained home in Laurelhurst which is a very attractive, upscale neighborhood. The basement suite is exactly as advertised.  It is very spacious, nicely furnished and very comfortable.
Communication with Kendall was prompt and very easy.  She is very accommodating and was always pleasant and thoughtful. An unexpected but delicious surprise were the homemade cookies she made for us.
We wholeheartedly recommend this listing.


"
8612922,55645034,2015-12-03,29063109,John,Homemade cookies. Beautifully renovated house in a nice neighborhood. Quite and respectful hosts. What more could you want.
8612922,56556975,2015-12-14,546836,Gaurav,"Kendall's place is just a couple of streets from my own home. I rented her place to accommodate extra visiting family -- and it worked out just great. 

Kendall was a gracious and very pleasant host who took the time to walk me through the place, show me the amenities, and answer any questions. She was very easy going, and very prompt with all our communication -- she even offered an early checkin to help my visitors settle in.

The place itself was spacious, clean, and very cozy. There were yummy cookies for us, as well as coffee, a ping pong table, a fold out bed, and plenty of room to lay back. 

The location is great for those visiting Seattle and wanting a quiet retreat, access to Children's Hospital, the University, all while being within 5 miles of downtown. I will definitely reach out to Kendall again when we have the need for extra room!"
4271221,21856465,2014-10-25,20977485,Carol,"Wow!  I can't imagine a much better airbnb experience!  Clif and Nelda's room/suite is spacious, beautifully decorated, comfortable, private, and immaculately clean. And the view of the lake and beyond from the room's large windows is awesome - changing with the weather and filling the room with light. The rest of the home is similarly lovely, and the residential Madrona neighborhood is great to explore - I enjoyed hiking through the woods down to the lake, looking at interesting houses on tree-lined streets, and having meals at a few of the restaurants several blocks away. Best of all, Clif and Nelda are perfect airbnb hosts - friendly and informative and so gracious in opening their home to me, while still giving me my own space. I felt ""at home"" with them. They are a wonderful addition to the airbnb community, and I highly recommend their new offering to anyone looking for a special place to stay in Seattle."
4271221,22000176,2014-10-27,5487635,Alan,"Clif and Nelda were perfect hosts - invited me to hang out with them if I wanted and gave total privacy if I wanted that.  I felt totally comfortable and at home.  Their house was beautiful with great views. My room was beautiful, spacious, private and had a wonderful bathroom with spacious shower.  Really a treat and an excellent stay.  "
4271221,22167922,2014-10-31,22823343,Nick,"I sought accommodation for a parent visiting to help with our newborn.  Nelda was very nice, set out breakfast each morning, made my mom feel welcome, did not impose and, they had chats on West Coast schools, work, et cetera.  I visited beforehand to see the room;  room and house are very attractive, as pictured.  Hosts were great! "
4271221,22416056,2014-11-05,899408,Charlotte & Bob...,"We LOVED staying with Cliff and Nelda. They have the loveliest house (really really nice), two fab cats, they are very laid back, helpful and thoughtful. They were relaxed about our plans and yet inviting in terms of their plans too. The coffee and light breakfast were so appreciated and I doubt we'll wake up to such a great view for a while. We were very taken by Seattle (and Bainbridge) and hope to return again one day. If we do, Clif and Nelda's will be the first place we look up."
4271221,22623183,2014-11-10,158946,David,"We met Clif and Nelda all too briefly when we arrived, they were off to a trip the next day.  They were friendly, gracious, and fun and we immediately felt right at home with them.  The house was fantastic: clean, well-furnished, and very comfortable and we felt tension drain out of us just from being in such an absolutely pleasant and peaceful space!   It was amazing watching the sun rise the first morning, and we also enjoyed being greeted by their cats, and chatting with their other lodger.  We very much hope to stay there again on our next trip to Seattle."
4271221,22964550,2014-11-18,23248542,Shane,"Fantastic house, fantastic location and fantastic hosts!  Clif & Nelda made me feel right at home from the moment I arrived.  We had some great chats about the area and they were always willing to give recommendations for dining and other activities.  The room itself was massive and had it's own private bathroom.   Can't recommend them highly enough, no negatives at all during my stay.  Would return!!"
4271221,23178807,2014-11-24,23551204,Naga,"Clif & Nelda's place was our first AirBnB experience, and it was great!  They were home to greet us and make sure we were settled in.  Their place is gorgeous, as other reviewers have mentioned.  The view alone is worth it, but the house has also been lovingly taken care of.  

We didn't spend a lot of time at their place, but we did have a chance to visit with them in the kitchen after coming home that night.  We had a great conversation about our creative pursuits (theirs being jazz, ours being theatre & writing).  They're like the encouraging aunt & uncle you always wished you had.  

I'd highly recommend staying with them.  "
4271221,23471471,2014-12-01,23378761,Brian,"I am so glad that we stayed with Clif and Nelda on our trip to Seattle. They were generous hosts and allowed us privacy while being sociable when we were looking for conversation and advice. I do not think the description adequately express how amazing the view is, especially the sunrises over the cascades. The view was always offering something new throughout the day with the changing light and weather. We enjoyed exploring the pedestrian trails and architecture of the neighborhood as well as the local cafes. The house is also close to the diverse eateries of the Capital Hill area and Downtown, no waiting in traffic to cross a bridge. Overall their accommodations were very comfortable and If you are are a cat person Isabella was always looking for some attention.
"
4271221,23652109,2014-12-07,11278939,Elisabeth,"Clif and Nelda were wonderful, very friendly hosts! I have so many great things I want to say about my stay here, but I'll only mention a some. 1st,  the view...AMAZING! I couldn't keep my eyes off of the view every time I came into the room or was resting in bed before falling asleep. 2nd, the room was so spacious, private, and beautiful. It looked exactly as it looks in the airbnb pictures. The bed was SO comfortable as well. And of course, as I've already said but want to keep mentioning...the view was spectacular. 3rd, the hosts were there to check in with us regularly about how are stay was going and to help as needed. They were so accommodating, allowing us to do our laundry there even. Overall, this stay felt like a luxurious and relaxed vacation thanks to the perfect room, view, and hosts :)"
4271221,25415057,2015-01-15,3269634,Sofia,"Clif and Nelda are amazing hosts. My fiancé and I spent a week with them and the conversations were as great as their lovely home. The room is exactly as pictured: an oasis of calm surrounded by a fantastic views. We intend to stay with them again soon and would strongly recommend their place to anyone seeking great accommodations, friendly and inspiring conversations, as well as an appreciation of music and nature."
4271221,25576043,2015-01-19,25975361,Marilyn,"We were warmly welcomed to their beautiful home. Our room was spacious and comfortable, with a beautiful view. The bed was extremely comfortable. The hosts were relaxed and easy to talk to. We loved walking through the neighborhood looking at the beautiful, eclectic homes. There is an interesting little business district just a short walk away.  This was a perfect location for us, and the hosts are just lovely people."
4271221,25649664,2015-01-21,16503899,Sam,"This was a wonderful place to stay! Clif and Nelda are accommodating, welcoming, and delightful people, and their home is beautiful! We enjoyed that the neighborhood was both quiet and not too far from the more ""happening"" area. (Clif also have us some very good recommendations on where to go.) I only wish we'd been able to stay longer!"
4271221,26402917,2015-02-11,8060013,Oliver,I haven't meet Clif but Nelda was there to take care of everything. The place was excellent. Very beautiful neighbourhood of Seattle. Everything clean.

4271221,28346990,2015-03-22,29006752,Betsy,Clif and Nelda were extremely accommodating with arrival time and gave us good advice for the area (and Vancouver). The place had great views and was easily accessible. 
4271221,28403096,2015-03-23,105888,Jerry/Aida,"We've stayed in some wonderful airbnb rooms around the world but never have we enjoyed a more incredible view than from our window  in Clif & Nelda's upstairs bedroom. There beautiful home on Lake Washington was the perfect compliment to the Cirque du Soleil show we traveled to Seattle to see.  And when we weren't enjoying the serenity of our room, we were exploring the shore of the Lake which is only footsteps away. Wonderful people...wonderful room...the perfect airbnb mix."
4271221,28892264,2015-03-31,714648,Jennifer,Spectacular hosts! I loved staying with Clif and Nelda and would highly recommend this listing. Also appreciated the collection of games and books in the room.
4271221,29099284,2015-04-04,6981780,Renaud & Kaylah,"We had a wonderful time at Cliff and Nelda, the house and the view are magnificent. Lots of things close by to eat, see and do. If you need more information of the area they will be glad to give you pointers on what there is around. Again we had a very good time at Cliff and Nelda, I highly recommend you stay there on your next visit to Seattle. Thanks again for letting us stay in your lovely home."
4271221,29629199,2015-04-10,21980878,Steve,"We arrived in Seattle for the first time and were amazed at how beautiful, green and friendly people were. We decided to stop by a few well known sites before checking in with our host family. When we arrived at Clif and Nelda's home we were thrilled with their beautiful home and knew we had made the right choice. They were friendly and delightful. The room was gorgeous and the view is something we still miss to this day. A beautiful home and a friendly family made our stay even that more memorable."
4271221,29851854,2015-04-13,8596910,Howard,"Lovely and welcoming hosts, beautiful setting with phenomenal views, very comfortable room...our stay with Nelda and Clif was wonderful!"
4271221,30323673,2015-04-20,30015710,Margaret,"Clif and Nelda were welcoming and gracious. The neighborhood and views are exactly as described, beautiful and convenient to downtown and waterfront. Our room was pretty, immaculate, comfortable. It all worked perfectly for a three night stay. "
4271221,30623319,2015-04-25,7437396,Matt,"This was my first time using Airbnb. I had a totally awesome experience! Clif & Nelda were very gracious and made me feel very comfortable. The home was absolutely beautiful, the room was quiet, cozy and private. Very comfortable bed and super clean house. Five minutes walk through the woods to the lake, could be a perfect morning hike. Again, what a view!"
4271221,30806528,2015-04-27,30671098,Jack,"My first experience with AirBNB as well as Seattle and it could not have been better! Clif and Nelda's home was beautiful and beyond what the pictures here can represent. The drive to Seattle's different tourist attractions was very convenient and the neighbourhood was superb. Hosts are very friendly and delightful, and our conversations were always fun! Also enjoyed the books offered in the room. Overall a perfect experience. Thank you again for letting us stay at your lovely home!"
4271221,31238218,2015-05-03,30313149,Ryan,"Clif and Nelda were great hosts! Very inviting and friendly but also gave us the rest and privacy we needed.  The view was EXTRAORDINARY, and their cat was awesome.  I would recommend this space to anyone who wants to relax in a quiet neighborhood without being too far from all the Seattle action."
4271221,32064586,2015-05-13,30646594,Catherine,"This was my first stay at an Air BnB and my first trip to Seattle. Cliff and Nelda's room is quaint and has a lovely view of Lake Washington and a welcoming cat named Isabella. Unfortunately, I was not able to meet with Cliff and Nelda since they were out of town but I was able to get by through text. They're located near a lot of slopes outside of downtown so I suggest having a car or taking a Lyft or else you'll get tired real fast. The neighborhood surrounding this location is extremely quiet and the neighbors are very nice. If you have a problem with cats or cat hair, do not stay here. Isabella is very welcoming and likes to come into the room during your stay. Thanks again for having us over! "
4271221,33102575,2015-05-25,30598389,Jordan,"We had a wonderful stay with Clif and Nelda. This was our first Airbnb experience and it far exceeded our expectations, not least because Clif and Nelda were such kind hosts. Our room was very comfortable, and the view, as promised, was spectacular. The house is a gem, the neighborhood is lovely (do go to St. Cloud Cafe for brunch), and getting to and from downtown (by bus, in our case) was a cinch. We just wish we could have stayed longer!"
4271221,33341546,2015-05-26,34017320,Ari,Fantastic experience in Seattle! Clif and Nelda have a view only matched by their own hospitality. Truly warm people. Thanks for making our stay so pleasant!

"
4271221,34022577,2015-06-03,33854271,Teresa,"
Beautiful place. Vwry clean, lots of character, and gorgeous view. I haven't slept so well in a long time. Not only is the bed one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in, it is next to large windows overlooking the lake.  Nelda and Clif are super chill, gracious hosts.  Location is close to downtown in a gorgeous neighborhood. You can walk to quaint breakfast/lunch spots, and also a library. I hope to stay here again sometime. 
Bonus points...sweetest cat ever! But if your not into cats, no worries, she will keep to herself and the house is so clean you'll never know she is there. "
4271221,34291196,2015-06-07,16111520,Lucy,This was our first time using Airbnb and we had a great experience. The room is spacious and the view from the room is absolutely amazing! It's just a quick cab ride to get to many of the local attractions. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to others traveling to Seattle. Thanks for your hospitality Clif and Nedra!
4271221,34712342,2015-06-11,31882868,Roxane,"It was our first experience on Airbnb and we really liked it. The room was exacly like on the pictures, it was clean and with a very nice view. Clif and Nelda were welcoming and helpfull. Thanks a lot!"

Arrival communication was clear, early and easy. 

The place is fantastic and the view even better!

I'll be back for sure - Thank you Nelda and Cliff :)"
4271221,35078750,2015-06-15,30123234,Patricia,"This room exceeded our expectations. It was a lovely aerie in a leafy, peaceful neighborhood that was great to explore, with beautiful homes and some great restaurants on 34th, including one of the best breakfast spots in Seattle. The large windows offered a jaw-dropping view of Lake Washington. The room was cozy, meticulously clean, with a great en suite bathroom. Our hosts were very hospitable but also allowed us privacy and gave off a very relaxed, calm and welcoming vibe. For those who want a Seattle experience away from downtown and too-busy tourist spots, this airbnb stay will make you wonder why you don't live in Seattle!"
4271221,35299246,2015-06-17,30988846,Jen,"Clif and Nelda were great! We had to stop a little early, and that was okay. The view was beautiful, the bed comfy and the cats companionable. We got to hear some great jazz music and enjoyed that thoroughly. Good conversation with our hosts made this a good trip. We'd stay with them again."
4271221,35922842,2015-06-23,27752769,Gym,My stay with Clif and Neida was very enjoyable. The room was very clean and comfortable with exactly the view as pictured. Everything worked as described. Public transportation was easy and the walk was not bad either. Thank you for sharing your home.
4271221,36059178,2015-06-24,20083907,Wendy,"The house and guest room is absolutely gorgeous!  Overlooking Lake Washington for stunning views. I highly recommend Clif and Nelda's home. They are incredibly warm and hospitable hosts. There are a couple of feline friends in the house that are very chill and friendly. The home itself is up a large natural stone stairway and the guest rooms are upstairs too, not a bother for me it added to the charm and overall experience. Plenty of street parking in a quiet neighborhood. I could not have asked for a better accommodation. Thank you!!"
4271221,36178251,2015-06-26,26701557,Ricardo,Beautiful location and very clean room. Cliff and Nelda we're welcoming and gave us the freedom to come and go. Both were more than willing to offer suggestions. Make sure to walk down to the lake through the woods. Thank you for offering such a peaceful and open room. It's a little bit far from downtown but there was always an Uber driver 5 minutes away and downtown is a 10 minute drive. 
4271221,36290968,2015-06-27,33661034,Sandra,"Great place to stay, the view is stunning, the room spacious and you can walk down and take a swim in Lake Washington, overlooking Mount Rainier.... we loved it. Thanks Clif and Nelda for creating such a friendly environment to finish our 2 week vacation. "
4271221,36767350,2015-07-01,27963915,Fredi,"Cliff and Nelda are very warm and friendly hosts. My wife and me spent 3 wonderful days in this beautiful room, before we started our trip! Thanks Cliff, again for you support with my lost luggage, that has not arrived for 2 days! We would come back anytime."
4271221,37020214,2015-07-03,25047394,Eugenie,"This Seattle oasis redefines a ""room with a view."" It's the same view Bill Gates has from his house. The only problem with it is that it may discourage from going out and seeing the rest of the city! Clean, comfortable and convenient. Perfect. It's a 10-minute drive to Pioneer Square. Use Luxe valet to have a driver meet you wherever you go and then deliver your car at the end of the day wherever you end up--all for $15."
4271221,37294083,2015-07-06,15747429,Neil,"Amazing first time in Seattle
Beautiful home
Beautiful room/view
Beautiful people 
Definitely recommend to anybody who needs an awesome place to stay in Seattle "
4271221,37522224,2015-07-07,23909111,Qian,"Clif and Nelda are wonderful hosts, thoughtful and friendly. My stay was short but very pleasant. The room is very comfortable accompanied by a stunning view of the lake. "
4271221,37669427,2015-07-09,2984352,McCarton,"What an amazing view from the bedroom. THE VIEW. That alone is worth the price of admission, but Cliff and Nelda were also extremely friendly and hospitable during my time here.  Great neighborhood, close enough to the downtown action if you need it but far enough away to decompress. I definitely recommend!"
4271221,38612511,2015-07-17,10541906,Alona,"Beautiful view and a very clean, spacious room. The area is convenient to all the Seattle hot spots. And the hosts are wonderful people to talk to vI will definitely go back on my next Seattle trip!"
4271221,42548496,2015-08-14,9092971,Ashleye,"Our time in Cliff and Nelda's home was perfect! They made us feel very welcome and we instantly fell in love with their beautiful character home. Pictures don't do justice to the amazing views from the room. We fell asleep while admiring the distant city lights and awoke to the sun shining off the lake. So amazing! We really enjoyed the neighbourhood as well. Cliff suggested some restaurants down the street (37th and union) and we had the BEST meal at a small Ethiopian restaurant called Cafe Soleil. So delicious! We also suggest getting some yummy ice cream at Molly Moons! Overall, we had a great time in Seattle and can't say enough good things about our stay. We will be back! "
4271221,43195062,2015-08-17,37436541,Jonathan,"Great location with spectacular lake view in the morning.  Although Cliff and Nelda weren't able to host us , the room is very comfortable.  Would love to stay again!

A few things to mention:
1. We arrived late at night, and had some trouble finding the house.  Maybe some lighting by the stair would be helpful.
2. The internet was not working when we arrived, luckily someone in the house was able to help and reboot the router.
3. Very clean and comfortable room.  Wish we could've stayed a bit longer to enjoy the room and view.
"
4271221,43792102,2015-08-22,1593293,Ryo,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Clif and Nelda's beautiful, peaceful home for a week while we were exploring Seattle. The room had an excellent view of lake Washington just like the photos and their generous hospitality allowed us to stay rested and comfortable. One thing to note is that taking public transit from the location requires a bit of an uphill walk, however taking an uber or lyft into town was very economical and easy. Also, easy parking if you rent a car. We wouldn't hesitate staying here again if we are in Seattle. Watching the sunrise from the room is an event in and of itself! "
4271221,43958979,2015-08-23,12082835,Katie,"This location was primo! We so appreciated being in a neighborhood area that was rich with style and ambience.  Although we did not meet our innkeepers, they clearly take care of this property. It was clean and beautiful. Thanks you so much for the hospitality. "
4271221,44408801,2015-08-26,31613385,Claire & Xavier,"Thank you for this amazing stay. Airbnb hosts should all be like Clif & Nelda: welcoming, kind, happy to share tips on the area. The room had a breathtaking view on the lake and the sunrise."
4271221,45069206,2015-08-31,29105447,Klaus,"Clif and Nelda got a Wonderfull house.
The Room was just like shown on the pictures.
It is very spacefull and perfect tidy!
We had three Wonderfull nights there and i would definetly go there again."
4271221,45387340,2015-09-02,32159271,Meggie,"This is truly a wonderful home with an incredible view! We were so pleased with our stay at Clif and Nelda's. They are easygoing and welcoming hosts. The room with bath was clean, tidy and more than adequate for our stay. Great location too, with walking distance to restaurants and a short drive to the sights of Seattle. We'd definitely recommend this to anyone. "
4271221,45569742,2015-09-04,38503336,Zach,This was a wonderful place to stay the view is awesome to wake up to! Also the hosts were awesome and very friendly!
4271221,45928564,2015-09-07,6234630,Daphne,"My friend and I had an amazing stay in Seattle. The room is big and beautiful, just like in the pictures and the view is breathtaking. 
Cliff and Nelda were great hosts, super friendly and as much involved as you want them too. We're very happy we stayed with them and would always come back and recommend it to friends. Thanks again! 

Also their two cats are super cute:)"
4271221,46419494,2015-09-10,19684061,Rebecca,I can never forget the wonderful and beautiful view. The neighborhoods were also calm and friendly. The host were also same. 
4271221,46503669,2015-09-11,3586924,Mary,"Clif and Nelda are lovely hosts with a beautiful home. They welcomed us warmly, gave great information on local restaurants and made us very comfortable. "
4271221,46705723,2015-09-13,30181440,Matthew,"Lovely spot not too far from downtown.  The hosts (and their two cats) were welcoming, and we didn't hear them at all while we were there.  The neighborhood is quiet, upscale (but not uppity) residential, with a batch of restaurants and a few shops at the top of the hill in Madrona.  

Morning view from the bedroom was fantastic, and the water pressure in the shower was quite nice.  It's a long walk to downtown (about 2-3 miles with hills, depending on where you're going), but short car, uber or bus, especially if you stop in restaurants in Madrona or Capitol Hill on the way.  We walked or used uber.

The only potential drawback:  the front steps and steps up to the room could be difficult if you're mobility-impaired.  Otherwise, we would highly recommend it to anyone--nice start for our first Airbnb rental.  "
4271221,47260030,2015-09-17,22153619,Sascha,Clif and Nelda were really friendly and they had some recommendations what to discover. The neighbourhood was very quiet. The house was very good accessible by bus. We had everything we needed. 
4271221,47404988,2015-09-18,43264744,Nanette,"Peaceful! We couldn't stop gazing at the view outside our window. We left our shade open at night in order to continue the view into the dawn. Clif and Nelda were friendly and welcoming, but not overbearing.  The bed was comfortable. The bathroom and shower provided everything we needed. An added bonus was the jazz piano music softly filtering up to our room in the evening. Our first AirBnB experience was perfect!"
4271221,48071971,2015-09-23,37074368,Judith,"The room was lovely, the hosts were welcoming, and the location was perfect for my needs."
4271221,48199640,2015-09-24,41866388,Matthew,A lovely home with a welcoming host. The morning view from the bedroom cannot be beat. We hope we have the chance to stay there again sometime soon!
4271221,48995740,2015-09-30,31214282,Shengnan,"Cliff and Nelda are very kind and friendly, my husband and I enjoyed a happy time in their house.  We have a phenominal lake-view room, it is warm, clean, and the garden is tiny and beautiful. If you wanna have a peaceful night, be here. The bus is convenient to downtown, or by UBER, which is just about $7 to westlake station. oh, their cats are so shy and cute, I love them～and we also had a nice breakfast, they offered us milk, shapoo,hairdrier. Sometimes, if you leave late in the morning, you can hear the amazing music by Clif, really nice.oh, you may see a lot of art pieces, books, photos, they own the best memories in many places. If I could visit SEATTLE again, I will still choose here, much better than five star hotel"
4271221,49228726,2015-10-02,41840550,Liam,"Clif and Nelda were very welcoming and gave us a useful run down on the local area, which was lovely. The room was accurately described but even better in real life. They gave us help when we asked but also allowed us to feel free, independent and at home in their house. 
We would stay with Clif and Nelda again in an instant and recommend their room wholeheartedly."
4271221,49615015,2015-10-05,40847395,Xiaoqing,"Lovely house and friendly host. The lake view from the window is very beautiful. The location is convenient. We had fully privacy, free to come and go. Clif gave us very helpful advices. Their two lovely cats are very friendly either. This is definitely a perfect place to stay in Seattle."
4271221,50655510,2015-10-13,43729116,Kyle,We cannot thank Clif and Nelda enough. Their home was the perfect place to come home to after a long day hopping around the city. The bedroom has breathtaking views and they thought of everything that we could want or need on our stay. We hope to come back again someday to a home away from home. 
4271221,50937961,2015-10-16,2155870,Russ,Our 3 nights with Clif and Nelda were great.  They were gracious hosts and the accommodations were excellent.  We would have no hesitation to recommend them to anyone planning to visit Seattle.
4271221,51356915,2015-10-19,43281564,Shunrang,"Really beautiful house with nice view. It has separate bathroom which is super convenient! Overall, it's a very good experience!"
4271221,51554192,2015-10-21,44536616,Kaitlyn,"What an amazing place to stay! Do not pass this place up. The view alone is enough, but to accompany that you have a comfortable bed, a bathroom stocked with anything you may need and host that are kind and easy to communicate with. Thanks for such a great stay, we hope to come back one day :)  "
4271221,52089383,2015-10-26,44663854,Li,The house is simply perfect! The room has breathtaking views and you could find everything you need in the room. The whole house is filled with artistic feel. You would able to enjoy the beautiful music played by Clif and Nelda  if you  choose to stay here :)
4271221,52386656,2015-10-28,46508209,Courtney,"Clif and Nelda were great. Their home is beautiful and the room has an amazing view! We only had a short time there but they were able to accommodate us last minute which was very appreciated. We had a short conversation with both of them and they are very sweet people, we only wish we had more time to spend there! "
4271221,52628033,2015-10-31,1159134,Stephanie,"This is the perfect location for people who want to see the less-touristic side of Seattle and still be close to the attractions.  The house is nice, and the neighborhood is wonderful for people who enjoy exploring on foot.  Clif and Nelda provided easy instructions and information about the neighborhood and how to get around.  They went a little above and beyond by providing light breakfast options.  The view really is spectacular.  I wish I had more time to explore."
4271221,53366988,2015-11-08,36589441,Viviana,"The home of Clif and Nelda is homey, comfy and beautiful views! It's perfect because their neighborhood is very safe and almost forest like yet they are so close to the downtown area, the city night life. They we're kind enough to let us drop off our bags in the morning. We mostly got around through the bus or uber, not expensive at all! Everything in Seattle is close by so it was easy to get around. The bed and room of the house was perfect size! And the window of the room was a great perk to wake up to looking outside at the lake. We spoke to Clif and Nelda a couple of times and they are very kind. The breakfast was a good amount in the morning that they provided and it was easy to get in and out of the house. All in all I felt very comfortable and my trip was so much fun, I hope to visit Seattle again soon and I would definitely stay here again. I recommend this place to anyone, thanks again Clif and Nelda (:"
4271221,53817762,2015-11-13,45561386,Reed,"This Airbnb lived up to it's listing! The views from our room of Lake Washington were spectacular. The neighborhood and its restaurants are great. We were comfortable walking at night, though we didn't realize it was 3 blocks up stairs through the neighborhood to the shops! Clif & Nelda were welcoming hosts. We highly reccomend this home."
4271221,54239835,2015-11-17,42868241,Paulina,"Clif and Nelda were wonderful hosts and their house is beautiful! We were not able to interact with Clif and Nelda for more than on our way out but their house made us feel at home in Seattle. We would absolutely visit again, the views were truly breathtaking especially at sunrise! You will not regret your stay here, it was much better than any hotel. "
4271221,55911176,2015-12-07,37941455,Kristen,"Clif and Nelda were excellent hosts. They were warm, welcoming, and happy to have us stay. Their two sweet cats were also happy to great us at breakfast each morning.
 The house is homey and beautiful. Our room was clean, comfortable, and had a spectacular view. The neighborhood is certainly not a tourist area and it's a quiet retreat for a restful night if you've been exploring the city all day. But it's still incredibly easy to get to everything. We didn't have a car and found the buses quite accessible.
  The Saturday of our trip we had a whole day of cold rain ( to be expected in Seattle in December) and were able to enjoy an afternoon in our warm room watching the rain and napping. The house is really a respite, and if you're lucky, you'll be soothed by Clif or Nelda's musical talents!
  I believe we would stay again if we find ourselves back in Seattle! Thanks for a great time, Clif and Nelda!"
4271221,57090393,2015-12-21,4612981,Steve,Great Great Lake view in a quiet neighborhood! Truly the best Seattle local experience. Host are warm and kind about everything! 
4271221,57733773,2015-12-28,28780068,Suzanne,Clif and Nelda's home was absolutely beautiful with a stunning view! I had the pleasure of meeting Nelda and she was very hospitable and allowed my friend and I to make ourselves at home. The room was a nice size and the location was accessible to where we needed to go in Seattle. 
4271221,58087130,2015-12-31,22782706,Victoria,"We had a great time staying here.  The neighborhood is beautiful, and view from the bedroom is better than the pictures can describe!  We walked to two fantastic restaurants from the house--one for breakfast and one for dinner.  We also could walk to the Arboretum.  Superb!"
206781,15838519,2014-07-16,17348592,Eric,"We loved our stay - the apartment was great, the location was fantastic, and the host (and his assistant) were responsive and helpful. It was a real home from home on our American road trip, and we were reluctant to leave after our ten relaxing days! As one might expect from Airbnb it's like the owner just left town for a few days, so the cupboards have their food and the closets have their clothes, but you are welcome to live there and there's plenty of room for your own stuff.

Best things:
- awesome central Seattle location, convenient for everything downtown and around
- comfortable, well-kept and very clean building and apartment with plenty of space for a studio
- very quiet, especially for such a large apartment block in such a location
- fully equipped kitchen - I was able to cook as if I was back home
Drawbacks:
- WiFi wasn't available, though we could get online via cables
- The bed was rather small for two people, and the mattress wasn't particularly firm or supportive
- Not suitable if you're allergic to dog hair (which we weren't)

We didn't meet either the host or the assistant but communicated frequently by text message and email, and we worked with the (super-friendly) assistant to update the information sheet with some additional pointers on the immediate area, so hopefully the next Airbnb'ers will have more tips on where to go for groceries etc.

We would highly recommend it for a stay in Seattle!"
206781,16155957,2014-07-22,5821646,Brian,This was our first experience using airbnb. It's going to be hard to beat the experience we had here. The condo is perfectly located. It's a great sized studio with a nice kitchen and bathroom and plenty of room. Sarah managed our stay and was absolutely wonderful. She was very responsive and made sure our time in Seattle was perfect. We will definitely stay in this apartment again if we come back to Seattle!
206781,16359967,2014-07-26,17236768,Kelly,"John's place was great! It was totally as described and very comfortable. The location was near coffee, cafes, and shopping. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay."
206781,16783047,2014-08-02,17361134,Dona,"John was a wonderful host. His assistant Sarah was always there to help with questions. The studio was perfect we had everything we needed. The location is within walking distance of most main attractions. The building was clean, beautiful and secure. Definitely one of my top 10 favorite vacation spots."
206781,22100677,2014-10-30,6134046,Jody,"We had a great experience staying in John's place.  John and Sara were checking in via text and email regularly.  The apartment was clean, comfortable and had great towels, linens, etc.  Lots of room in the fridge for our stuff and we appreciated a well stocked kitchen.  It's in a great location, close to the convention center, shopping, lite rail, monorail, and not far to the waterfront.

We took the lite rail from the airport and had a little trouble navigating to it (even with Sara's excellent directions on bing), since it was dark and rainy and most people don't notice that it's there.

The pool, hot tub, sauna, lounge area and patio were great...  even better than the pictures.  The steam room in the ladies locker room was not working, but the men's was.

Everyone in the tower was friendly, and we felt very save staying there.

We've used airbnb a couple of times, but not one that someone regularly lived in, ie, their clothes in the closet, etc.  We got used to that fast and felt comfortable.  There was lots of room for our stuff!

Thanks for a great stay!"
206781,22776133,2014-11-14,23317074,Joseph,Very easy experience. Great location.
206781,28356892,2015-03-22,29300166,Joline,"Clean bathroom. Need I say more? Oh, the gym, indoor hot tub and pool, and sauna were pretty nice perks, too. I only worked with his assistant but it was super easy and she was really sweet and accommodating. Location is perfect if you're visiting Seattle -- it's on the edge between the downtown core and south lake union. Highly highly recommend! "
206781,28750861,2015-03-29,29647899,Heather,"One of my employees stayed at John's residency for five nights. He loved the place, the location, the gym, and the responsiveness of John's assistant."
206781,29220063,2015-04-05,29938058,Garrett,The host was considerate and very communicative. I couldn't have asked for a more pleasant stay and at such an ideal location. Highly recommended. 
206781,33284299,2015-05-26,6865336,Kirsten,"What a great location! We were able to walk or take public transportation easily. We enjoyed the amenities the apartment offered. Sarah, John's assistant, was very helpful and kind. Everything went smoothly & we highly recommend staying here! "
206781,33781708,2015-06-01,14424559,Rose,"The flat was extremely centrally located - it was very easy to get to some of the really lovely parts of downtown Seattle. It was also very close to the airport. It was clean and had everything we needed including a massive fridge, a coffee machine, wonderful washer-dryer set up and dishwasher. Sarah, John's assistant, was absolutely lovely and went out of her way to help us even with things unconnected with the flat. The receptionists at the building were equally nice and helpful. Bed linen and towels were in abundance! The terrace - located on a different floor - is absolutely wonderful. We wished we had had more time to hang out on it. Many thanks to Sarah and John!! "
206781,34782405,2015-06-12,9209849,Jon,"I loved my stay at John's house. John's assistant, Sarah was very helpful. I would recommend this house !"
206781,35562270,2015-06-20,32619550,Shannon,"This was a great experience! The location was close to everything downtown, and the space was decorated nicely and had everything we needed.  John and his assistant Sarah were very communicative and friendly with us.  Very easy check-in and check-out. Two thumbs up!"
206781,40609246,2015-08-01,24286845,Rachel,"We had a great experience at John's place, we stayed for a couple of weeks and it was handy to have all the home comforts including the washer/dryer and dishwasher. 

It's a lovely building and central for everywhere you need in downtown Seattle/Belltown/Westlake area.

John's assistant Sarah was great and very easy to deal with and we found check in and check out very simple. We'd definitely stay again."
206781,43483586,2015-08-20,19347983,Mary,"Great location in secure building within easy walking distance to Whole Foods, fine dining, shopping and Seattle attractions. We really enjoyed relaxing on 8th floor's outdoor space.  John's apartment provided all we needed during our visit to Seattle. Location is terrific!"
206781,45366601,2015-09-02,31940964,Jason,"Everything about this apartment was perfect. I was in Seattle for 5 days and wanted to feel like I was living there and not staying there, and this was the best way to do so. The apartment building is centrally located and easy walks to restaurants, the water, and many other local hot spots. 

The apartment itself has everything you would need. Washer / dryer, kitchen, wi-fi, etc. It was very clean, with little notes everywhere to help you out with any questions you might have had walking into the place that you didn't think of asking before hand.

If I ever need to stay in Seattle again, this will be the first place I look for to see if it's available to stay.

Thanks John for contributing to a great time in Seattle!"
206781,46270022,2015-09-09,2439288,Alexander,"John's appartment was just as described - bright, spacious and even quiet given its location. It is well equipped for a multi-days visit to Seattle. Communication was clear and easy. I can only recommend the place!"
206781,52442471,2015-10-29,44792735,Paul,"Building is very well located and generally cool, love the rooftop deck. This is another location in the category of ""you are definitely living amongst someone else's stuff."" There's nothing inherently bad about it but I wish airbnb would try to capture this quality in a filter. Sarah was an excellent communicator. I would definitely stay here again if my tolerance for living amongst stuff was at an ebb in its cycle."
8889257,56670807,2015-12-16,48350132,Elizabeth,"Ellie left seasonal decorations, fresh flowers and sweets to welcome us. The amenities were excellent and much more than we expected. The cottage was spotless, well appointed and exactly as depicted. Our contacts with Ellie were timely and professional. We fully expect to make the Queen Anne cottage our Seattle home-away-from-home. Thank you again for a lovely, stress-free visit."
8889257,57565572,2015-12-27,50153406,Stacy,"Listing description was very accurate and the host was quite responsive.  First time staying in an Airbnb, and the experience was excellent!"
8889257,58308199,2016-01-02,29587235,Aaron,"Andrew/Ellie have the house setup really nice. It was decorated per the description and was very nice from start to finish. 

I think my only concern with this property is the parking situation. It is at the end of a very small cul-de-sac and does not have much room to even drop off luggage.

Other than that, the place is great. My mom loved it so much that she liked to just stay in and enjoy the comforts of the home. The location is great, very close to Seattle Center and awesome views of the Space Needle and the Bay just around the corner. The area is very high end with million dollar homes all around. Very posh in my mind. Great value compared to getting two bedrooms at a hotel.

We really enjoyed the home. One night we bought fresh fish, steak, veggies from Pike Place Market, brought it ""home"" and made a wonderful meal. I say ""home"" because we considered it home. I think we were all a little sad to leave it behind."
52525,105835,2010-09-26,240066,Marge,Friendly hostess;  pleasant and comfortable room.
52525,229868,2011-04-18,421216,Tine,"Mapple Creek House is ideally located in a quiet and friendly neighborhood, just what I needed during my stay in Seattle for the 2011 AAG Conference. I like to explore and see places where I visit so staying in Downtown Seattle would serve me little, hence Carol's place was the perfect location. The buses to Downtown are regular at 20 minutes interval and one can choose between the 71 route which takes you to many places and before it goes to Downtown, or the faster one which is 65, which one can connect to other buses  from University of Washington en-route to Seattle Downtown.

Carol's place is quiet, neat, comfortable, warm and very homely. I like the kitchen very much as it is designed in a circular fashion and one only has to turn around in circles to reach everything in the kitchen.  Carol is kind, open and friendly and takes time to discuss topics of interest and takes interest in the guests as well which is great attribute. 

I would recommend anyone wishing to explore a bit of Seattle and who is also looking for budget accommodation to choose Maple Creek House, trust me, I can bet on this that you will enjoy your stay.

Best wishes

52525,378978,2011-07-17,799430,Shruthi,Carol is an excellent host always accommodating all the requests from her guests. She is fun to talk to and most helpful. It was a pleasure staying at Carol's. 
52525,424172,2011-08-06,825574,MarySue,Carol was very kind and accommodating. 
52525,669227,2011-10-27,1252951,Eric,I really enjoyed my time here.  It was quiet and relaxing and the location was great.
52525,791200,2011-12-18,1400628,Jane,"A must stay in Seattle! 

Located in a safe and quiet neighbourhood, the Maple Creek House is a restful place to soothe one's mind and soul. The host, Carol, is one of the best hosts I've ever met - understanding, supportive, and creative. I genuinely felt at home during my one-month stay there. 

"
52525,833728,2012-01-03,1511786,Neil,"Carol had been an amazing host during my short 4 night visit, she is very friendly, generous, informative and helpful. Her house is clean and quiet from the busy traffic yet does not lack convenient access to all daily accessories - only a 10 minute walk to nearby shops! What adds further to this wonderful experience was the presence of other gorgeous guests that she hosts, it all makes a home away from home. Definitely recommended!"
52525,913490,2012-02-11,474888,Jarrett,"Absolutely Loved it! Could not speak higher about Carol and the Maple Creek House. I rented out her room for a month and had a blast! The room is comfy, very spacious, and the house is in a super quiet neighborhood so you can sleep like a baby. You've got 2 awesome grocery stores and restaurants in short walking distance.. And the bus stop is just right down the street.. so you can hop on it and quickly be in downtown Seattle.

Carol is an amazing host.. Extremely warm and loving and will make sure you are taken care of. A++ from me!

"
52525,1565172,2012-06-26,2026318,Gaelle,"I spent 5 weeks working at the university as a visiting graduate student, and my stay at Carol's house was really great. It is in such a nice neighbourhood, with good access to buses and supermarkets/cafes/etc. I loved the quiet atmosphere, it was really nice to come back to the house and wind-down after a busy day. I would highly recommend staying here, you are very independent and it is very much your home away from home. "
52525,1858580,2012-08-01,2359712,Brandon,"Carol was a great host.  The study den was perfect- nice, quiet, and comfortable. Would definitely recommend staying here.  "
52525,2662015,2012-10-20,3404791,Tom,"Carol is a wonderful host: very warm, gracious and generous with her knowledge of not only the local Wedgwood neighborhood but Seattle in general.  In the month and a half I stayed here, I was treated to a clean, quiet room -- exactly what I needed.  Maple Creek is in close proximity to the local 71 bus line which travels downtown, Van Gogh coffee shop (a great neighborhood spot), and two grocery stores -- all within easy walking distance.  Carol was extremely accommodating when I need to modify my reservation on multiple occasions, and just an all-around gem of a host.  Highly recommended!!"
52525,3455247,2013-02-01,4782348,Bagley,"Carol was welcoming,  kind, and clear  with all  things relevant  to  the visit.  He house is in a lovely and very quiet  neighborhood,  which was what I wanted.  Her wood floors are as beautiful they were in her photos.  There were luminescent silk teal curtains in the Garden View room, and the hot water was plentiful.  Easy parking at the house made it a perfect stay."
52525,8627354,2013-11-09,7539030,Sebastian,"I stayed at Carols place for about two month, while working on a project at UW. Carol was always very helpful and it was easy to make myself a home at her place. Stores are located within walking distance and UW can be reached by bus in about 25-30 minutes. "
52525,9661735,2014-01-04,586610,Kim,"good communication, no problems whatsoever, a great place to stay"
52525,12324924,2014-04-28,13266408,Emad,The reservation was canceled 33 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
52525,17474847,2014-08-12,13753546,Robert,"Convenient food and shops nearby and easy to reach by bike. Didn't see much of anyone else in the house which was fine, and BB was always quick to respond to any request. Definitely a quiet, mellow place to stay."
52525,20608319,2014-10-02,20370508,Patrick,"Carol was very kind and welcoming.  A few more photos would have been helpful with my decision to stay as the home was not what I was expecting inside.  The home was ""clean"", but rather dumpy...not worth the amount I paid to stay for a month.

I was not comfortable with the fact that Carol entered my room on multiple occasions without my permission.  The whole time I was there I felt like I was being watched."
52525,22126753,2014-10-30,13123664,Daryl,"I loved staying at Carol's Airbnb!  As a writer, it was the perfect place to be creative and have the peace and quiet to write.  In fact, the time spent at her house gave me the exact push I needed to start the layout of my first eBook!

It was exactly what I needed."
52525,22889811,2014-11-17,9492008,Noelle,"BB was very friendly and accommodating. Room was clean and cozy. House is easy to get to, great location, quiet street. Thank you!"
52525,26053221,2015-02-02,221965,Stephanie,"The Maple Creek House suited my needs perfectly.
I stayed here in Oct 2014 and Dec 2014 and I will be staying here again in Feb and Mar of 2015.  Carol met me the first day and showed me her small but cosy older home in a very quiet area of northeast Seattle. There was a desk and chair in my room for studying and a good internet connection.  I could control the heat in my room (off in the day, on at night). I took the 30 minute ride on the express 64 bus to downtown every week day.  I was kept milk and OJ in the fridge for breakfast but mostly ate out.  At times there were two other borders and we shared one bathroom.   The other borders were all very respectful and quiet. There was also good washer and dryer for laundry.  No problem with parking in the front of the house. A very safe, well lit, neighborhood. Grocery store and drug store and a boutique coffee shop within walking distance. (8 blocks) And Burke Gilman trail down a hill for those who jog.  I could always reach Carol with questions by text message and had some pleasant conversations with her but otherwise she lets guests do their own thing. I found it convenient to take the 65 bus to Lake City and 125th on weekends (15 minutes) to study at the Lake City library or go to LA Fitness or go to the Post Office or Fedex for copying.  Or from Lake City catch the bus to Northgate Mall and see a movie.  Also the 71 bus and 65 bus go straight to University of Washington from Maple Creek House.  The house is far enough away to be very residential and quiet but close enough to everything to be easily reachable by bus.
Perfect for me.  (website hidden).
They take recycling seriously in Seattle so be prepared to separate your discarded stuff."
52525,37424199,2015-07-06,37285870,Talia,"I loved staying with Carol Her house is clean and well organized and magical, with amazing pieces of art ie dragon paintings and statues, owls everywhere, stuff I really enjoyed looking at.  The house is in a beautiful location, a neighborhood with lots of trees and accessible views of the lake and sailboats.  Her backyard is peaceful and wonderful and Carol herself is warm, welcoming, and accommodating to guests."
52525,38541889,2015-07-16,29260667,Jane,"Carol is very warm and friendly. I stayed at the Study Den in the basement which is spacious. The small but well-function kitchen fed me everyday, love the kitchen! Maple Creek House is a lovely old house, having a feel of what we read in the fairy tale story because Carol's home is full of fantastical art works from different culture. I enjoyed a lot stayed there.  "
52525,49223058,2015-10-02,40432004,Ruth,"Carol is the absolute ideal host. I could not have felt more at home. She is warm inviting and wonderful, I did not want to leave. The house itself is perfect for staying a long weekend, or a month. Everything was taken care of, from clean fresh linens, to a full use kitchen to cook in. Its centrally located to shopping and grocery stores , as well as an amazing bike or walking trail, and Matthews Beach is right around the corner. I would highly recommend if you are to stay anywhere in Seattle this would be the spot! Thank you Carol for the amazing stay!"
52525,52063153,2015-10-26,21769709,Cheryl,"This was a warm and cozy place to stay. Carol was very welcoming and sweet. The area was mellow with lots of trees, not too much city noise or hubbub, which was great for me."
52525,54719873,2015-11-23,14241548,Alison,"I stayed in the Study Room with Carol (BB) for 4 weeks while doing a rotation at Seattle Children's Hospital. It was a very convenient drive (5-10 minutes) to the hospital, which was great, and BB was very welcoming. There was a grocery store and pharmacy around the corner, which were very convenient, but otherwise it is mostly a residential neighborhood so not much else to do without driving to another part of the city. But if you're looking for a quiet place near the hospital, this worked great for me!"
6907671,38419012,2015-07-15,1675458,Shehla,"Kristina's cottage has a great location & communicating with her was quick and easy, even though she was out of town.
Beautiful flowers, lemonade and granola bars were a nice welcoming treat. Also appreciated the refreshing pitcher of water with lemon slices in the refrigerator. Really nice deck with grill and comfortable outdoor furniture.
Wish though, the place was a little cleaner. It was awkward to see the hosts clothing still hanging in the bathroom. The window next to shower made for an embarrassing morning shower as you hoped that you did not expose yourself to the next door neighbors.
The bed was comfortable, nice bedding, except for the splotchy duvet insert (without cover).
We had booked 2 nights, but decided to leave after the first night.
"
6907671,38884824,2015-07-19,36436534,Merideth,"We enjoyed our stay at this precious cottage.  The location is fabulous, convenient to lots of Seattle activities and sight-seeing.  Kristina was prompt in responding to any questions and she left us some lemonade and granola bars, which were really appreciated after our late arriving flight.  The cottage is adorable, open (no doors, aside from bathroom), cozy, and fashionably decorated.  We were truly using the cottage for a place to sleep as our days were busy with visiting friends while dining and taking in the gorgeous scenery of the city.  The deck was awesome with a nice large outdoor sofa and grill- we only wished we had enough time that we could have spent an evening with a bottle of rose out there!  The landscaping is also quite well done and beautiful to be surrounded by while enjoying the outdoor space.  On this particular weekend, it was pretty hot for Seattle standards and this home, like most it seems in Seattle, does not have air conditioning.  We knew this (as it is stated in the profile) before arriving and were prepared, but when it is in the 90's during the day, the house gets quite hot and only one window opens.  We left the doors open while we were at home, but it only did so much to cool the place down and we did not feel comfortable leaving them open at night.  On our last night, when it was the warmest, we were drenched in sweat throughout the night.  We are spoiled in NYC and Texas (where us visitors are from) and are used to moving from one a/c space to another when it is this hot out.  This shouldn't be a big deal most of the year in Seattle as the weather seems pretty perfect- we just happened to be there during a particularly warm weekend.  One note to visitors, if you are planning to use the blow-up mattress or couch for sleeping, you need to bring an extra set of sheets as there are not extras available.  This may change, but it is something to be aware of when planning and packing.  Other than the unusually warm weather, we had an amazing time staying in this charming cottage!  The price is right and you get more of a Seattle experience than you would in a hotel stay.  We recommend!      "
6907671,40762797,2015-08-02,36239659,Megan,"I'm going to start with the positive. This place is in a good location and fairly close to the city. Secondly, it was cute and clean. I do have a couple warnings for anyone staying here. First, the ad for this place says it accommodates up to 4 people. Realistically, it accommodates 1. There is no practical furniture to put anything away! No dressers, nowhere to put toiletries, nothing. Second, the pictures in the ad show a living room full of windows. They DONT open! There is only 1 window that actually opens which means if your out exploring the city all day, your going to come back to a house that is hotter than hell. It was so hot in the house at night, I had to sleep outside on the lovely decorated patio. It was a surprise that the place didn't have A/C but it was a SHOCK to find that none of the windows opened. If I didn't have upcoming reservations, I would have left a lot earlier. My best advice is do not stay here during the summer"
6907671,42910282,2015-08-16,33470112,Lauren,Such a cute cottage! Perfect size for two people. Made us feel so welcome with a gift basket full of essentials! Loved this stay in Seattle! Perfect location too. 
6907671,44829802,2015-08-29,7935263,Jade,We had a very nice time at Kristina's cottage. Access was easy. Everything was clean and wifi was a since. I would definitely stay there again. 
6907671,46165673,2015-09-08,7963696,James,The house was great. We spent all day out and about so it was nice to come home to a quiet neighborhood. The bus was close and 5 doors down was a nice upscale bar. It took about 15 minutes to get to pike market. Loved it. Thanks. 
6881188,37214571,2015-07-05,35441868,Joon,"Fantastic!  Jean was very responsive to requests and townhouse was perfect for our family vacation.  Having grown up in Seattle I can say that this is great Ballard location, walking distance to the locks and main area on Market - and easy access to downtown Seattle.  Great place - thanks Jean!"
6881188,37621739,2015-07-08,35702675,Stephen,"This is the first time I use Airbnb, the experience was mixed. The house was ok but the clean policy and check out part was not friendly. We spent hours to wash dishes with hands, clean kitchen and looking for garbage ban, etc. But we were asked to pay extra fee $120 for we did't do something they think we should do. Overall I was quite upset for my first Airbnb experience."
6881188,38304195,2015-07-14,36083064,Jason,"Jean's townhouse was perfect for our group of 4 adults, and centrally located for the all the weekend activities we had planned in Ballard. The kitchen and bathrooms were were stocked with all the necessities and everything was in great shape. Thanks Jean!"
6881188,39786830,2015-07-26,1221822,Maureen,"Great Central Ballard location! SUPER CLEAN, well appointed with all that we needed.  The bedroom/bath layout for us was perfect with the twin beds in one room for our younger travelers and then the adults got the queen beds.  "
6881188,40134137,2015-07-28,13581104,Keegan,We loved the location! The property itself looked exactly as the photos and communication with Jean was great. Really looking forward to our next trip to Seattle :-) 
6881188,41375242,2015-08-07,35776639,Sarah,"Jean is a fabulous host and her home is perfect. My family and I absolutely loved the place and were very happy with our stay. We would absolutely rebook this property with Jean if we are ever in the Seattle area again.

This home is fabulously located in Ballard with restaurants, shops, and the Ballard Locks within easy walking distance. We walked a lot and loved it. Downtown Seattle is about 10-15 minute drive and a relatively cheaper uber ride.

Jean is very good with communicating and answering questions. Her responses were always quick. The instructions for checking in and out were few, clear, and very simple to follow.

Overall, the home was very clean, well located, and working with Jean was great. We had no problems and very much enjoyed our stay in Ballard on this property!"
6881188,41964663,2015-08-10,2529336,Cheryl,"This was a perfect place to stay. The apartment was located close to downtown Ballard, near the locks, and not far from other great areas. The accommodations were roomy an very comfortable with everything we needed to have a good trip including a blender for our smoothies and premium stations on the T.V.
If we come back to the area we will definitely stay here again!

6881188,42566613,2015-08-14,38410304,Dan,"Fantastic stay.  This place was very clean and has everything you need.  Great location.  Walked 2 blocks to the fish ladders/locks.   Many great eating places within walking distance.  WiFi available, DirecTv had all the movie channels.  Highly recommended."
6881188,43833365,2015-08-22,39787827,Wyman,"Jean's town house looks excatly the same as picture, it was very clean and in very good condition. Shops and restaruants are only a short walk and plenty of options. We had a wonderful time staying in Jean's place."
6881188,45094958,2015-08-31,2032107,Louise,"Wonderful spot in the perfect neighborhood.  Jean thought of everything, and it is completely fitted out for all kinds of groups.  We were a group of three couples and a toddler, and we had plenty of space.  The location was ideal, walking distance to everything, including the amazing Sunday farmers market!"
6881188,45953684,2015-09-07,38027464,Monica,"La descripción de la casa y la ubicación fue como estaba anunciada en la página. Jean fue siempre muy atenta y amable y resolvió todas nuestras dudas al instante. La casa estaba en perfectas codiciones muy limpia y organizada con todo lo necesario en baños y cocina.
  En general muy buena experiencia "
6881188,47644568,2015-09-21,36477810,Rita,"Jean's townhouse is beautifully appointed,  well maintained,  and in a great location.  The garage was a much needed feature.  Our group each had their own car, so street parking for some was found a block or so away.

Communication from Jean was great!  All emails,  texts, and the manual inside the house were all clear and concise.  

This is my first time using Airbnb, and I would definitely recommend Jean."
6881188,48347373,2015-09-25,17852562,Fiona,"Jean's townhouse was perfect for our family of three. It's well appointed, tastefully decorated, and even toddler safe. And as a former Seattleite, I can attest that the location in Ballard is hard to beat. We appreciated being so close to the locks, restaurants, coffee shops, and grocery stores. Communicating with Jean was easy; she was very responsive. She even provided a helpful house manual that gave us all the information we needed about the rental and made it clear what was expected of us. I would recommend her place without reservation and we would happily stay there again."
6881188,48902986,2015-09-29,3752073,Sarah,"Booked this place for five family members to stay at when they came to Seattle and they loved it!  The townhouse was stocked fully stocked with anything you could need - extra towels, blankets, hair dryer, toiletries, first aid kit, and plenty of kitchen supplies.   There was also plenty of hot water for each of them to take a shower in the morning. 

The location is perfect for walking around Ballard, and the garage in the townhouse worked out well for parking the rental car at night.  Everyone said that they would definitely stay here again.  "
6881188,50230065,2015-10-10,28751312,Karen,"Everything was wonderful, and location was convenient! The host was quick to reply and very gracious. Thank you so much for opening your home to us!"
6881188,51285431,2015-10-19,14616392,Samantha,This house was very clean and a perfect size for a larger group. Great location to see The Locks and there were many great restaurants in the area. 
6881188,52948958,2015-11-02,21845870,Khalid,"It's really amazing home. I like it, and every time when I'll come to Seattle I'll take it:)"
6881188,53466200,2015-11-09,13535499,Daniel,The host was wonderful and flexible. The house was nice and clean. I was very happy. It is within easy walking distance of many cool places in Ballard. I would stay here again.
6881188,54092499,2015-11-16,40479936,Kristi,Great location. Kid friendly and she had everything we needed. She was very responsive and we were even able to get in early. 
6881188,54827499,2015-11-23,41837079,Jean,"The townhouse was lovely, fully equipped and a welcoming place to return to after a day of intense sailing. Jean was highly responsive throughout the booking process."
6881188,55349155,2015-12-01,25500927,Natalie,Jean's place is conveniently located in Ballard. The apartment was clean and true to the pictures. Jean was readily available and responded promptly to questions. I would definitely stay again!
6881188,55740530,2015-12-05,34391549,Mike,Jean was extremely helpful.  We checked in to a clean and comfortable home. The fireplace was excellent and the garage perfect/secure for our project equipment storage (we were testing offshore Shilshole).  We'll stay again if the place isn't already booked.
6881188,57874288,2015-12-30,28498620,Serena,"This property worked out perfectly for me and my family for our Christmas holiday. There were a total of five of us who stayed here (the property can sleep six), and there was plenty of room - bathrooms, kitchen and cooking space, laundry, even a fireplace for maximum coziness! The property was within walking distance of Ballard and having a garage was handy, too. Bus lines into downtown Seattle are easy and within walking distance as well, so you can avoid traffic and parking hassles at many of the most popular tourist attractions. We've stayed at other Airbnb properties and hotels in Ballard and this was by far the best.

But perhaps most importantly was our hostess! We had an issue upon walking in where the heat didn't work in a couple of the rooms, and the hostess was incredibly communicative throughout the entire process. Even though she was out of town she was in constant contact and also sent maintenance to correct the problem immediately, and this over the Christmas holiday! Our holiday vacation went uninterrupted and all was well. I don't have a bad word to say about our experience."
6934128,35994037,2015-06-23,26123284,Ellie,"Lynn and Randy provided excellent accomodations while I stayed at their house! They are located in an area in Capitol Hill that is near all the action, but not exactly right in it..so there is a perfect balance of peace and action if that is what you're looking for. Their house has a cute backyard with a beautiful garden and spectacular views of the mountains/Rainier! Lynn and Randy were out of town when I first arrived, so their friend Tim was kind enough to show me around Capitol Hill and grab dinner/drinks with me! I'm moving from Chicago to Seattle in the near future and my first impression of Seattle was made a thousand times better with my fantastic stay here. I would recommend a stay with Lynn and Randy to anyone! :)"
6934128,37936342,2015-07-11,35664887,Jay,"I'm a Photographer/Filmmaker/Dance Instructor whom recently moved to San Francisco from NYC nearly 5 months ago.  I'm currently in Seattle to attend a Tango Festival.

I originally booked and secured a private room with another host via airbnb near University Village; but when I showed up, I was informed that my private room was a camping tent in the backyard.  I quickly cancelled and re-booked via airbnb with another host with an actual private room at the last minute.  It wasn't a great feeling especially when I flew in the night before and didn't get much sleep. Now I have to scramble to secure an accommodation for the week that most hotels/hostels/bedandbreakfasts/airbnb were busiest and fully booked for the downtown area. This also meant that I will have to either pay higher prices or travel further from the accommodation to the event for a lower fee.

I was lucky that something came up near the downtown area and managed to secured a two days accommodation of the original 5 days trip while sitting at Starbucks from 8am to 5pm.  An entire day was wasted in researching for open accommodation while the event that I was attending will be kicking off in a few hours prior to a host via airbnb accepting my reservation request.

Linda was my host who accepted my reservation at the last minute. Linda is super friendly, very thoughtful and extremely helpful. I got to meet Linda very briefly due to my event schedule and her hiking with her friend and weekend get away plan with her husband. I technically come and go in my convenience.

The place was as seen on the airbnb listing. It has an amazing backyard view over looking the landscape. "
6934128,39681127,2015-07-25,866459,Aidan,"Great house, quiet and easy to get to from downtown (via Car2go).  

Randy was also easy to communicate with and quick to respond. 

Thanks for an easy airbnb experience! "
6934128,39842347,2015-07-26,38360156,David,This is a great place to stay. Private bedroom in a very nice house. Randy and Lynn are very accommodating and make sure you enjoy your stay. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in Seattle.
6934128,45297360,2015-09-01,40077551,Christie,"Randy and Lynn were warm welcoming hosts. I saw Lynn the most, and she was very helpful (down to making sure I had enough layers to wear for my Mt. Rainier hike).  The check in/check out process was seem less, with flexibility that can accommodate any travel schedule. The room I booked was clean, large, and bright with lots of windows for taking in all that fresh Seattle air. If I'm ever back in Seattle, I would totally book here again. Thanks Randy and Lynn, you made my first Airbnb experience a great one!"
6934128,46012388,2015-09-07,6319221,Chris,"Check-in at Randy's and Lynn's place was super easy, despite me arriving rather late. The room and house looks exactly as the advertisement. It's a quiet neighbourhood, one block away from the busy 23rd Ave E with frequent buses (8,43,48) to downtown and the U-District. There are also plenty car2go parked in the area. 

The room is super huge and bright. There was nothing that I felt was missing during my stay. "
6934128,49554136,2015-10-04,2119753,Sara,"Our stay at Randy and Lynn's home was short but great. Unfortunately, we didn't get to meet Randy or Lynn, but they were very communicative and made sure that we had everything we needed for our stay, including excellent restaurant recommendations. Our room was clean and big with a beautiful mountain view. The location in Capitol Hill is great - close enough to all the action on Broadway and the Pike-Pine Corridor but also separated enough that you can enjoy their pretty, peaceful neighborhood. If you like a good walk, then the walk downtown (approx. 45 mins) to Pike Place Market/waterfront is an enjoyable one and a good way to explore the city.  Thank you Randy and Lynn for a wonderful first Airbnb experience! We would love to stay again next time we're in town!

6934128,53702110,2015-11-11,6537585,Alex,"Very welcoming house with a spectacular view from the kitchen! I really enjoyed my stay, and their little dog Teddy is very friendly :)"
8052542,50032387,2015-10-08,44542320,Natalie,"Ciara is a wonderful host, she provide basically everything we needed, especially she bought a brand new baby crib for our baby and set it up before our arrival. She's also very responsive to all the communications. Not to mention that the roof top of this place is the best you will find in seattle area, we are so greatful to live in the apartment. Def recommend people to stay and will come back to visit in the future!"
8052542,51346417,2015-10-19,45381921,Stephen,Fantastic accommodations just two blocks away from Pike's Market.  Ciara was easy to work with and communicated clearly through the check-in & check-out process.  The rooftop terrace provides a wonderful view of downtown Seattle and is a great place to have an evening cocktail.  The apartment was clean and exactly as advertised in the website description and pictures.  I would definitely recommend this listing.
4760472,28152787,2015-03-18,25446284,Megan,"Had a wonderful time at Elizabeth's apartment. We didn't get the chance to meet her, but her boyfriend, Chris, was very nice and accommodating. The place was close enough to walk to everything we wanted and in a charming neighborhood. The ceiling is low, which wasn't a problem, but would be if you were over 6'3"". One unexpected bonus was the deep soaker tub! The apartment is lovely and we would go there again anytime! Great Ethiopian food nearby and pie. Thanks Chris and Elizabeth!"
4760472,28424084,2015-03-23,28431559,Ashley,Everything was wonderful! We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. Everything we needed was right there and the area was perfect. 
4760472,28810268,2015-03-30,545048,Kyle,"Elizabeth was a wonderful host! She greeted us with fresh towels, and a fantastic in depth walkthrough of the space as well as local places to go see, eat and drink. 

Id happily stay here again, as the location is perfectly just outside the downtown area and still has tons to do.  "
4760472,29417833,2015-04-07,16944650,Alisa,"What a great little find!  Elizabeth and Chris were there to welcome us and give us a quick tour of the apartment.  The place is super cute and cozy and couldn't have been in a more convenient location.  Just a quick 5 minute drive to all the touristy stuff--Space Needle, Public Market, the ferry terminal, Volunteer Park.  Anytime I had a question, Elizabeth was very quick to respond and amazingly helpful.  This was so much better than staying at a stuffy hotel.  Would love to come back on my next visit to Seattle!!"
4760472,30613024,2015-04-25,8522599,Jen,"Good value in a convenient location. This is a basement apartment that definitely feels basement-y, but the hosts made it comfortable with cute furnishings and a space heater. Best of all, it is within walking distance of Ezell's, the best fried chicken in the world."
4760472,30806311,2015-04-27,11710721,Cole,Good location and the host was very helpful about the area. It's a quietish location but there are things to do within walking distance. It's a fairly short trip to downtown using a number of options. Pretty basic spot to stay but everything that was needed was provided. Only concern was that it's kind of a busy street and you get a bit of that traffic noise in the downstairs unit but I sleep with white noise anyway so didn't bother me too much. 
4760472,30941805,2015-04-29,17728095,Scott,Good location. Great hosts. Easy check in . Clean . As advertised. 
4760472,31182629,2015-05-03,15837299,Sehun,I did not get to see Elizabeth but her son helped us when we needed help. She had very quick responses when we contacted her and she was willing to help for anything. 
4760472,31639072,2015-05-08,6274844,Mary Lee,"Easy to find, excellent space in a very cool, historic yet ""up and coming"" neighborhood. Seattle's Central District was home to both music legends Quincy Jones and Jimi Hendrix. Don't miss the opportunity to stay in this charming little apartment! Walking distance from some great local bars, restaurants, and attractions: Chuck's Hop Shop, Skillet Diner, Restaurant Zoe, Uncle Ike's Pot Shop, and Central Cinema to name a few. Extremely easy to walk, take the bus, Uber, or cab to downtown, Capitol Hill, and UW. "
4760472,32503743,2015-05-19,28325063,Aya & Jeff,"We loved the friendly neighborhood, nearby coffee shops and restaurants as well as Elizabeth's excellent recommendations and the convenience of the number 2 bus – just a 10-15 minute ride to the market. We love Seattle and very much enjoyed our cozy stay at Elizabeth's apartment."
4760472,32972031,2015-05-24,8735674,Blair,"We really enjoyed our time here. The apartment was in a great location and super cozy. Lots of thoughtful touches throughout, from brochures of things to do to a Brita pitcher. 

Despite the warnings about the lower ceiling, my husband who is 6'1 was very comfortable.

Elizabeth was a great host. We arrived pretty late and she was very accommodating of our late check in. 

Would definitely recommend this listing to others, and hope to come back in the future."
4760472,33283724,2015-05-26,3483455,Trin,Thanks for being so hospitable. The place was clean and they respected our privacy. I would stay there again if I am in the area.
4760472,42652213,2015-08-15,27420827,Chelsey,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for the whole summer, and Elizabeth was a fantastic host! She and her partner Chris were so responsive to anything we needed around the house. The apartment was in great condition and perfect for a Seattle summer- the basement kept us cool on hot summer nights! The location is great; it took me 20 minutes to get to work downtown on the bus, and it was just a 15 minute walk to get to the hustle and bustle of Capitol Hill. The Central District is also great in itself-- lots of great restaurants, bars, and definitely has its own awesome culture. I would absolutely recommend staying with Elizabeth-- what a great first Seattle experience for me, thanks to this place and our wonderful hosts!  "
4760472,43233610,2015-08-18,24615819,Catherine,"We had a really great time staying at Elizabeth's place. The apartment is lovely and is a short walk to lots of bars and restaurants. Elizabeth was a great host and provided tons of information. 

We would definitely stay there again and totally recommend it for anyone who wants to visit Seattle. It's a great place to base yourself because it isn't in a total tourist zone and gives you a good, authentic feel for Seattle's neighborhoods. 

Enjoy!"
4760472,43932686,2015-08-23,33382276,Phylis,"We just returned from a 2 night stay at Elizabeth's apartment.  It was exactly as described!  Location was great and accommodations were fantastic.  
I came a bit early and the apartment was not quite ready for me, but they were kind enough to store my bags until then.  Everything was clean and necessities, such as toiletries and water were available.  And just like other reviewers' comment,  the bed was very very comfortable.  
I highly recommend staying at Elizabeth's place and would not hesitate to return in my next visit to Seattle.
Thank you for a wonderful stay."
4760472,44630134,2015-08-28,721473,Lena,Thank you so much Elizabeth and Chris for all your hospitality. You guys made it a smooth trip for us and gave us lots of great local info. The place is in a great location and super close driving distance to everything! 
4760472,45059459,2015-08-31,12027877,Manfred,"Conveniently located close to a bus station and nestled in a pleasant neighbourhood, well kept place.
Elizabeth was easy to communicate with, everything cld be discussed in advance. Thank you"
4760472,46119935,2015-09-08,33227282,Terri,"Elizabeth and Chris were lovely hosts.  We arrived at midnight due to air travel and Chris had waited up for us to help us with our luggage and give us a tour of the apartment.  The accommodations were lovely, welcoming, very comfortable and the perfect size for two friends to feel at home away from home.  The location was most convenient to public transportation to downtown or just a short walk to cafes, grocery shopping and food trucks.  The kitchen was well appointed for cooking breakfast in the apartment before our long days of sight seeing.  The Both Elizabeth and Chris took time to visit with us about their lives in Seattle and their love of the area, the neighborhood in particular.  This gave us a sense of connection with them and the area which made our stay feel more personal.  We would definitely stay with them if we return to Seattle."
4760472,46373502,2015-09-10,25825305,Jude,Great neighbourhood everything was perfectly clean and tidy.  Good advice on getting to the apartment s well 
4760472,46867613,2015-09-14,22099566,Laura,"Comfortable apartment, short ceilings so beware tall people. Had to kill a few spiders, but it's a basement so not too surprising. Great apartment, would recommend."
4760472,47171114,2015-09-16,26924015,Donald,"Elizabeth was a great hostess throughout our trip to Seattle. The location was also convenient for both downtown and University exploration! The house was very spacious, organized, and well-decorated. I also appreciated the amenities included, such as the coffee laid out for us! She made sure to keep in contact with us before and throughout the trip. She also made sure to update us with any changes within the neighborhood. All around phenomenal job, and I would highly recommend booking with Elizabeth for any first time visitors to Seattle!"
4760472,48377693,2015-09-26,25824031,Lizzy,Elizabeth's flat was great! It was clean and had everything we needed and more. The location was perfect; walking distance to multiple coffee shops and grocery and a short drive downtown or to Capitol Hill. Elizabeth and her boyfriend were also very helpful and accommodating throughout our stay. 
4760472,48837614,2015-09-28,12166358,Mike,"Awesome hosts, great place to stay 30  minute bus from downtown when busy, 7 dollar uber.

Rental was as listed and as expected, very pleasant hosts with a great ideas about the neighborhood."
4760472,49132443,2015-10-01,23827969,Brett,"Very nice basement suite in a lovely area. The suite was well stocked with everything we needed. Great location, we rented a car and it was no more than a 5-10 minute drive to everything. Great hosts!"
4760472,49986747,2015-10-08,36841520,Nickie,"Comfortable apartment, great neighborhood. The house was clean and well-decorated. Very convenient to bus station. 
Chris was very considerate and helped a lot during our stay. 
Would like to recommend for visiting  Seattle downtown."
4760472,50835473,2015-10-15,3610478,Janice,What a great stay and an awesome location. Lots to eat around the area and easy access to buses that take you all over downtown Seattle. Elizabeth was very kind and responded to questions and requests very promptly. I would definitely stay here again!
4760472,51277751,2015-10-19,19614923,Beth,Great place and great hosts! Really enjoyed our time here. Excellent communication prior to and during our stay. Really great book of recommendations which we found very helpful. Thanks again :)
4760472,51710467,2015-10-24,20858329,Justyce,"I booked this listing for my partner's birthday and we had a great time staying here! Chris and Elizabeth were always available when we needed them, yet never overbearing. We stayed in the basement apartment, which was super cute and charming and has everything you need. There is even an adorable garden just outside the door!

The house is located in a very walkable neighborhood and is a short drive from all of the most popular attractions (Space Needle, EMP Museum, Pike Place, etc). Our Uber rides were all around $10 or so. We also found the list of local restaurants and businesses to be extremely helpful.

It felt as though we had our own little apartment, which was a great way to get a taste of both the residential and touristy sides of Seattle! We highly recommend this listing and would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
4760472,52579926,2015-10-31,42034611,Crystal,"This place is great! It's super close to a lot of great attractions and many wonderful local cafes and bars. They had parking, too, which was super helpful! The hosts are also wonderful! They responded very quickly to anything messages we sent. We had an amazing time and we would definitely recommend this place to others.  "
4760472,53025991,2015-11-03,11703337,Travis,Elizabeth greeted us as we arrived. She was a very gracious host. The accommodations were perfect for our stay. We felt right at home in her cozy garden apartment. Her neighborhood is quiet and close to everything. We love to walk and explore so we were very happy with our decision to stay in this part of town. Thanks again for providing such a wonderful place to stay. 
4760472,53765542,2015-11-12,39446070,Antoinette,We had a great trip to Seattle and this apt had all the amenities you could ask for especially for the price and location. 
4760472,53977222,2015-11-15,4205857,Amanda,"The listing for Elizabeth's place was very accurate. It was a nice and private place, conveniently located downtown. We didn't get a chance to meet the hosts but they kept in contact. Elizabeth was a great communicator. We were able to park our car in the drive way and take the bus around town. I would recommend this listing to others and consider staying here in the future. "
4760472,54436370,2015-11-20,37039633,Dan,"Very convenient and a nice place to stay.  Close to a lot of great restaurants.  Great place to call ""home"" while in Seattle on business."
4760472,54600064,2015-11-22,37200468,Lauren,"Elizabeth was friendly and helpful. Nicely furnished area- had everything we needed, and in a great area too!"
4760472,56037006,2015-12-08,6027878,Lindsay,"Elizabeth was an excellent host!  She provided plenty of detailed information about the apartment, directions, tips for getting around, and great neighborhood recommendations, and Elizabeth was always quick to reply.  The space was very nice and quite cozy in the winter, and there was everything we could need in the apartment (towels, dishes, extra shampoo, etc)!  The house is in an excellent area.  It was a quick walk to Capitol Hill.  Downtown was walkable also, but there are two buses nearby for when it was raining.  There was a dedicated parking spot, which made renting a car easy.  We enjoyed our stay very much and recommend this apartment!"
6436976,34989986,2015-06-14,17009269,Lexi,Great location for visiting downtown Seattle. It is far enough away to be in a quiet neighborhood but close enough to be an easy walking distance to Downtown or the multitude of fun restaurants in the Capital Hill area. It also has an assigned parking spot which is like gold in this area of Seattle!
6436976,35243199,2015-06-16,34219351,Cl,"The apartment is accurately described. The contact was great, prompt, and helpful. We were given good suggestions about where to go and what to do and available quickly if needed. The parking spot was a huge plus. "
6436976,35574379,2015-06-20,15471929,Kiki,"My friend and I had a great stay at Alcie's apartment. It's located in a good neighborhood in CapHill, walking distance to tons of restaurants, bars and other amenities. On two of the days we walked all the way to pike street and down to the water and back up. Wear decent shoes and be ready for the little hike back up. The last two days we still did tons of walking around but used über for farther destinations. 
Alcie was great with coordinating everything for us. He was out of town during our visit, but arranged for his friend Erik to walk us through the apartment. Erik went way above his call of duty and actually picked us up from the link when we arrived! He text me some local places to check out later on our first day and made check out very easy! 
Thanks Alcie & Erik for a great first time airbnb experience and making Seattle a second home for us! :)"
6436976,37986128,2015-07-12,22381748,Lynn,"Lc was incredibly welcoming and responsive. We never even met in person, but his correspondence before my trip and calls to check that everything was ok once I arrived were much appreciated. His place was immaculate with plenty of space and welcoming touches. "
6436976,38605734,2015-07-17,22981227,Donna,We loved this apartment. It was spacious enough for two and it was nice and clean. The dedicated parking spot was much appreciated because street spots were slim to none. The location was perfect and easy to get to the downtown area (website hidden) our host met us when we arrived and gave us the info on parking and showed us around the apartment too. The view of the space needle was an added plus too. We walked to local restaurants for dinner. Would definitely stay again
6436976,41077007,2015-08-04,32627616,Cheri,"Highly recommended! This is a spacious and comfortable apartment in a nice neighborhood with a view! Capital Hill was a fun place to explore. We were within walking distance to Top Pots for coffee/donuts, and a neighborhood store for miscellaneous.  The QFC grocery was farther but still walking distance. We were also close to the Lake Union (website hidden) was a perfect host and so accommodating. He made sure we were comfortable, gave us names of places to go and offered to be a go-to person at anytime we needed him. Downtown and The Market are a walk down hill or a quick car ride. I stayed 12 nights and began to feel like it was my second home. My fiancé and I were comfortable the first 7 nights as were my mom and I for the last 5. Mom used the elevator but we usually used the stairs. The neighbors were kind as well. "
6436976,41438462,2015-08-07,32928201,Nick,"Lc was very responsive to questions and made our check-in and check-out very efficent.  The apartment was immaculate, comfy, and had great views.  Really nice neighborhood with good restaurants within walking distance, and fun bars."
6436976,41942886,2015-08-10,33817968,Jennifer,"This was an absolutely great place to stay!  It was clean, well-decorated, had everything we needed, and was close to restaurants, coffee shops, etc. The best part was the host was responsive and friendly and helpful. It was an awesome place to stay!"
6436976,42558158,2015-08-14,37875898,Nina,"My husband and I had a great stay! We walked a bunch to the center of Capital Hill and Downtown. We also visited a bunch of family close by, so the parking was very convenient and essential in Capital Hill. Plenty of fans for the unually hot summer. Great view and private place."
6436976,43377357,2015-08-19,36731572,David,"Everything was perfect, the appartment was clean. "
6436976,44148893,2015-08-24,25301059,Parks,"The apartment itself was wonderful, and for how much we paid, it was a steal. It's in a quiet location, has a beautiful view of the Space Needle, and Lc had the place spotless for our arrival. While the immediate surrounding neighborhood was quiet, if you walk a short 3-5 blocks, you are in the heart of Capital Hill, filled with delicious restaurants and (website hidden) was a wonderful host - very quick to respond to any questions we had and made sure we knew where everything was in the apartment. About a week before, I messaged Lc to let him know I was expecting a package and that it might come in a day or two before our arrival. He was incredibly accommodating and said he would keep an eye out for the package for me. 

The incredibly comfortable bed, large TV (+Netflix!), great location, and spacious living room made this a fantastic experience.

Thank you, Lc!"
6436976,44679854,2015-08-28,2449257,Richard,"Lc's place was a lot more than advertised. He is one (uphill) block from Top Pot and Single Shot, two very special places. He's also just a few doors down from Cafe Barjot (the best yogurt and granola I've ever eaten) and minutes away on foot from Starbucks Reserve. If you like walking this is the neighborhood to be in. Just minutes from Downtown/REI/Amazon, on foot. His apt is relaxing and a great place to come back to. From his dining room/living room window you have a clear shot of the space needle. We will be back!! Thank u Lc!!"
6436976,45569155,2015-09-04,36806331,Michelle,"We had a wonderful experience in Lc's Capitol Hill apartment. The place was very clean and well stocked with travel necessities and although we never met Lc face to face, his communication was fantastic. The apartment is in an amazing neighborhood and made it so easy to get to everything we wanted to check out... The private parking spot was an added plus! We will be back! "
6436976,46146529,2015-09-08,408120,Annarose,"The location was great -- lovely neighborhood and easy to get around from. We had a car with us so the free parking was especially appreciated. While the location was great, I did not find that the apartment was clean ."
6436976,46784791,2015-09-13,6377312,Sally,"Lc does a fantastic job at communicating all of the details and making sure everything was clear. He was quick to respond to everything we needed and made sure we were comfortable. He even sent along some great restaurant recommendations in the area. The unit was extremely neat and clean, and the location can't be beat. We really enjoyed exploring Cap Hill and beyond. And the view of the space needle was pretty awesome. We fell in love with Seattle and want to keep coming back!"
6436976,47488965,2015-09-19,36169401,Susan,"Our host was very good about checking in and making sure we were doing OK.  Place was clean and neat.  There was some trash left in the kitchen and bath and food and other misc things in the cabinets, but I think it was within acceptable standards for a private place to rent.  The bed is very hard - too hard for me but not my husband, so it's a matter of preference. I would have liked a coffee pot, however, the lack of it made us get out and go to some of the local bakeries so it's hard to complain given all the wonderful pastries I had while in Seattle.  The walk to the Seattle Center is 1.5 miles.  Parking is ridiculous expensive, so I would walk there if you're up to it.   It was nice to have Netflix, but it kept having to reload - most probably an area problem and not the host's fault.  Overall, it was better than staying in a one room hotel."
6436976,48569799,2015-09-27,7468998,Chimére,"Lc was very accommodating and polite - a great start to my first Airbnb experience. Check-in was so easy breezy and made the start to our Seattle exploration super simple. He checked in to see whether we needed anything, but we were well cared for with the amenities available in the apartment, including Seattle maps in case mobile batteries failed us. Fresh sheets and comforter plus clean towels were awesome. This was actually the first time I'd packed solely carry-on, so towels were a big deal! :) 

The location of the apartment was incredible. We walked a ton and discovered so many amazing neighborhoods. We also took Pronto bikes to Olive and even over the Denny bridge to have brunch - the Pronto bike pickup was just a swift walk up a friendly hill. We also had a dreamy breakfast at Top Pot Doughnuts then finished up a couple of our nights at Summit Public House, both of which were a simple stroll away. Loved the neighborhood and the hospitality. When we discovered the direct view of the Space Needle we melted! We will be back!"
6436976,49480286,2015-10-04,25498020,Tina,We enjoyed our stay at LC's. The location was ideal. The space was comfortable with every convenience provided. Host communicates perfectly. Highly recommend!
6436976,51463993,2015-10-20,44725968,Bethny,"This apartment was fantastic. Clean, spacious, very well located for bars/restaurants on Capitol (website hidden) was a great host with good communicaiton throughout, easy check-in, great tips for where to go and see.

Would definitely recommend this place.
"
6436976,52369802,2015-10-28,46972341,Effie,"LC was very prompt contacting us to answer questions. The apartment had everything we needed and within quick walking to great coffee & donuts (get a box of both from top pot). Don't expect to do much cooking, had basic utensils, plates but with the close proximity of good food you may not need to.
Right near a bus stop to ride to museums, aquarium, pike place though we could walk to those too. 
Neighborhood & building felt safe, secure. Would definitely go back. Thanks LC for making our first AirBnb experience a positive one!"
6436976,53194968,2015-11-06,42173440,Thomas,"Lc as a host was very on top of things and communicated well.

A bit disappointed though. Unit was listed with free parking, but after I booked the unit, I was told I had to pay for parking. 

The unit was also listed with washer and dryer. When I arrived, I was told it was a coin operated washer and dryer in the basement. I had to run and get change as soon as I arrived which was very inconvenient. I always unpack my suitcase and throw the wrinkled clothes in the dryer. The last two units I had, the washer and dryer were in the unit.

When I arrived and parked, the parking lot was full of trash and smelled horrible. 

When I entered first entered the building there was dirty, smelly carpet padding and carpet tacks (no carpet). The floors that did have carpet were soiled and very very dirty.

The unit itself had stained carpet, but not as bad as the stairs and hallways. Below average cleanliness over all.

I was left two towels and two wash rags for the entire week with no washer or dryer to wash them. I certainly didn't want to go and wait in the basement to wash towels.

The unit needs a coffee maker. I bought some great coffee at the store only to find that there was no coffee maker. 

As I said, the host was great with communication, but the unit and building was not so great."
6436976,54315549,2015-11-18,38456313,Stephanie,"Lc was a wonderful host who communicates very quickly and creates a great, positive experience. His apartment was exceptionally clean and he even left us some fruit and protein shakes (which is great if you are like us and in the PNW for day hikes!). He was very helpful and checked in periodically to make sure we were okay and to give us suggestions on places to eat. His place is in the heart of everything and perfect if you love to walk everywhere. We used his parking because we had a car to go hiking, but other than that we never had to use it, everything in the city was incredibly close. We would stay here again in a heartbeat next time we are in Seattle :) "
6436976,55481662,2015-12-01,25559065,Francky,"Lc tries to keep in touch with you to check how goes the check-in and check-out. I appreciated that a lot because I had a few trouble and he was available to help me. His check-in details are quiet clear, efficient  and easy to understand. Always keep the door locked: this is the best recommendation I can give you. The apartment is exactly as the pictures show it. It was very clean and welcoming. However if you visit Seattle during the end of fall or winter get warm clothes... Lc left all the windows open for fresh air which is great but I arrived at 7pm and the whole apartment was pretty cold. keep your jacket on and turn on the heater (a bit weak) ;-p. The building is a bit old and doesn't seem to be entirely insulated, I am not sure about that though. In addition you won't have unlimited hot water (10/15min per day). In case you didn't notice I am super sensitive to cold. The apartment has got all the necessary amenities you would need. And Lc like to know about your experience in the city and in his apartment. He's a very nice guy and very helpful.
Overall it's been a nice experience that I would renew for spring or summer only.
Thank you Lc for your help ad your quick responses when I needed to communicate with you. He was back to India during my stay but he was still able to help me which is extremely enjoyable."

It's just 3 blocks from Broadway, where restaurants, a huge grocery store (with everything from hardware to liquor to groceries and natural foods), a post office, coffee shops, and more.  The living room is as open and inviting as it looks, and boasts an excellent, large flat-screen TV.  The little dining nook made a great work area, and plenty of floor space made it possible to exercise comfortably.   It's just bit over a mile walk into the heart of the city (downhill, so plan on the uphill walk back) with all that it offers.  I felt secure in the building and walking in the neighborhood."
8385687,47885127,2015-09-21,44188801,Andy,"We had a wonderfully experience here.  Casey is very friendly, charming and welcoming. He knows lots of things about the area that most travelers wouldn't know about. The condo is in a perfect location with everything in the downtown, Capital Hill and hospital neighborhoods just minutes away. It was great to be able to park the rental car off street, something hard to find in this area. The king bed was cozy, as was the whole place. This will definitely be where we will stay on future trips to Seattle."
8385687,48843835,2015-09-28,42431439,Brad,"Casey was great! Fast communication, nice tidy place with plenty of space. He was very flexible with check in and check out. The place was a 20 minute walk from downtown and an Uber ride was only $10-$20 to any major attraction or event. Great spot, great guy, there isn't anything I could write negatively about my first experience with Airbnb or Casey."
8385687,49189433,2015-10-01,17639643,Aaron,"Casey's place was great! Comfortable, clean, spacious and close to downtown. Would highly recommend staying here!"
8385687,49933093,2015-10-07,44709570,Jo,"Casey was prompt to answer questions and give suggestions as he seem to be very familiar with the Seattle area.  Two bedrooms, two full baths,  kitchen, patio/grill and parking --very good,  nice space to spend my time in Seattle.    Did not use parking or grill/patio but condo  was cleaned and ready for use.    
"
8385687,50236867,2015-10-10,20831839,Li Heng,"The location of the apartment is very good，easy to visit the major viewpoints of Seattle. Casey is very nice and helpful.

8385687,50538836,2015-10-12,45277861,Ashley,"We traveled to Seattle for a wedding recently and decided to stay here with another couple. The place is in a great location and very central to everything downtown. There are also a few coffee shops and great breakfast places just a short walk away. It was very clean, spacious, and perfect for what we needed. Casey was a great host and checked in a few times to make sure our stay was going well. We will definitely keep this spot in mind for the next time we travel to Seattle!!"
8385687,52907773,2015-11-02,5980423,Jamie,Casey's condo was very clean and well taken care of. The description perfectly matched the location of the place and the layout. Casey was very attentative and gave me all the information I would need in a timely manner. He is also very pleasent and responsive with requests or queries. 
8385687,53991481,2015-11-15,46500487,David,"Perfect location for an easy commute to east side work while enjoying the Seattle nights. Casey saved me lots of money by knowing special dinner deals at great restaurants, and he was very helpful in making sure I had everything's I needed.  The building is very secure with protected parking and is quiet and new-feeling.  The elevator was wonderful for my limited mobility.  The condo is large and clean, like having a suite in a nice hotel at a fraction of the cost.  Access is quick and easy to downtown sites like the art museum and Pike Place market.  I will definitely stat here on all my future business trips."

4993710,32540829,2015-05-19,21173126,Bobby,"There was a bit of confusion the first night when I went to check in, but Shawna was able to come up with a solution and helped me stay with another Airbnb host that night. It worked or very well and she was very eager to come up with a solution to the issue immediately.

After that night I had a great stay in Shawna's apartment. It was very nice, clean, and comfortable. I hope her place is absolve the next time I come to Seattle!"

She made us feel right at home. The condo, right in the heart of Fremont, was super clean and very well appointed. It really felt like a home away from home during our week in Seattle and would stay there again in a heartbeat. Thanks again, Shawna. "
4993710,34806226,2015-06-12,34239599,Greg,"Very warm and cozy apartment. The location is really the main selling point of this stay. Great restaurants, small local coffee shops and a close walk to the troll! Couldn't ask for more. Shawna was great, very responsive to all my questions. You will love you stay. Thanks Shawna"
4993710,35265507,2015-06-16,35332940,Jeremy.,The place was convenient and comfortable.
4993710,36260889,2015-06-27,27800982,Olivia,"Our stay was delightful.  The condo was both a convenient location to the main Fremont strip and also to the wedding we were attending on Lake Union.  Shawna was quick to answering any messages I sent her and and was accommodating to our late night arrival in town.  

The place was cozy and had everything we needed.  The perfect place for 1-2 people to stay if you want to be in Fremont."
4993710,38495669,2015-07-16,11629594,Betty,"Cozy condo in Fremont was exactly that! It was comfortable and cozy. Great location for walking to anything you might need from groceries, to a fabulous cup of coffee to fine dining.  It was also  great to have a place to park a car for when you need a car to get somewhere farther away. 
The condo was exactly as pictured. Tastefully decorated, clean  and extremely comfortable. Everything you might need with the comforts of home. Great views from the balcony. We arrived in Seattle during a ""heat wave"" and  Shawna had several window fans for us to keep us cool.  We appreciated the thoughtfulness and we were never uncomfortable. 
Thank you Shawna for letting us stay in your condo! I've never stayed in Fremont before. I loved it and found the location to be amazingly convenient to anything we wanted to see and do in the Seattle area. It really is the center of the universe."
4993710,39619603,2015-07-25,4564273,Shannon,The place was in a perfect location for us. Having parking was a big plus. Beautiful views. We had a great comfortable stay in the apartment. Everything was very clean.
4993710,40493630,2015-07-31,9366654,Josh,"The home was clean, well stocked and very comfy. Excellent shower and water pressure. And a very cozy big bed. Location is close to Cafe Ladro, good breakfast and solitude and the heart of Fremont.
We felt secure."
4993710,41966433,2015-08-10,1974944,Sarah,"Shawna was so easy to coordinate with! She's flexible and cool, which made the whole process seamless. Her apartment is clean and in an awesome location.

4993710,42564537,2015-08-14,1981183,Allison,"This apartment is cute and clean. My husband and I enjoyed the space, and we loved spending time in Fremont and nearby Ballard. There are seemingly endless restaurant, brewery, coffee and craft cocktail choices in the area. As a host, Shawna is communicative and friendly. She happened to see us come in with our suitcases so she made sure we got in okay. Overall, I highly recommend this experience. "
4993710,43266556,2015-08-18,21893208,Tillie,"Great, great, great location & easy parking. We didn't stay at the apartment much but it was clean and nice. Definitely recommend staying here if you are in town! "

The apartment was clean, cute and in a great location. We would definitely stay again."
4993710,46116640,2015-09-08,9140830,Alissa,"Shawna's place was just what we were looking for during our trip to Seattle - it was clean, modern, and beautifully decorated. The deck was a wonderful place to sit and relax. It was a great location and had a reserved parking spot (street parking would have been difficult to find!). Shawna checked in with us to make sure we made it safely and was available for any questions that came up. We would definitely stay there again on our next trip to the city! "
4993710,46776917,2015-09-13,42427394,Elizabeth,"Fremont is a wonderful neighborhood in Seattle, as we discovered for the first time.  The apartment is in walking distance to the neighborhood cafes, eateries, shops, outdoor sculptures, and waterfront paths. Great location. We had a quiet, peaceful stay in this pleasant Fremont condo. Just as described."
4993710,47302257,2015-09-17,15619971,Alex,"Shawna's communication was awesome, and her home is a great place in a wonderful neighborhood.  If I'm ever in the area again, I'll be back!"
4993710,47854465,2015-09-21,21884790,Austin,The host was super helpful as far as WIFI codes and directions. There were no complaints from us. The location was great and the apartment was very well maintained. I would definitely stay here again. 
4993710,48097785,2015-09-23,22348764,Jennfier,This is my favorite spot to stay when I travel for work in Seattle. It is cozy and great location. 
4993710,48599374,2015-09-27,2446906,Joseph,"Shawna's condo looks exactly how it does in the picture and was very clean and a great place to stay. I was worried about not staying downtown, but Fremont was an awesome neighborhood that I enjoyed very much. Tons of restaurants and shops all a block away from the condo. I would definitely stay back at this condo if I were to visit Seattle again. "
4993710,49010916,2015-09-30,647613,Brad,Shawna was very responsive and helpful.  The condo was very clean.  Nice view.
4993710,49520892,2015-10-04,44437376,Caroline,Place was cozy with cute decorations! Great location for Seattle and very clean! I would recommend it :)

4993710,53284238,2015-11-07,22348764,Jennfier,"Amazing place, it is my home away from home :)"
4993710,53515460,2015-11-09,42427394,Elizabeth,"This was my second time staying in this Cozy Fremont Condo. The apartment is ultra-quiet, clean, and definitely cozy. It's great to have the parking spot in the back, too. All in all, I love the location: the neighborhood coffee houses, restaurants, and shops, all in easy walking distance. "
2737038,41467394,2015-08-07,38122031,Casandra,Over this was a great pick for us. It was located in a quiet neighbourhood but still close enough to all the things we wanted to do. The view was amazing and the overall suit was very clean and cute. Johnny was very easy to work with and provided us with all the details we needed. The listing was a bit vague but I think that was only because there was work being done on the suite when we were trying to rent it and everything was not quite ready.
2737038,41781189,2015-08-09,36660725,Joshua,Our stay was great. Johnny is a good host kept great communication and has a wonderful home! Amazing view! 
2737038,42726124,2015-08-15,38126457,Brianna,"We chose this location for the privacy, and we were not bothered at all exactly what we were looking for. Very beautiful view and only about a 15 minute drive to get downtown."
2737038,43069013,2015-08-17,19731499,Keith,Johnny's place was beautiful! Recently remodeled with a lovely porch and view to die for. I loved the quiet neighborhood and being just 10 minutes from Ballard.
2737038,43688391,2015-08-21,13389228,Jeremy,"I had a great stay! This small granny house behind the main house is definitely set up to be a full time rental. It has simple yet tasteful  styling and the view was spectacular. Johnny gave clear instructions, communicated well. I had a flat tire on the way in, which caused me to arrive very late. Even at night I could easily find the place and get in, no problem. The view in the morning was spectacular!

One thing to note: this place is about a block away from some fairly busy train tracks. I personally live close to some tracks myself, and I'm pretty used to the train noise. I also travel with ear plugs. So, it was no issue for me. Light sleepers should consider bringing some ear plugs though."
2737038,44802731,2015-08-29,29538288,Pamela,"We had a great stay in Seattle.  The cottage was clean and everything was in working order.  It was close to restaurants, basic amenities (grocery stores, drugstores, etc.), as well as a ~20 minute drive to most of Seattle's major attractions including downtown.  The neighborhood is quiet, perfect for a relaxing vacation.  "
2737038,45697058,2015-09-05,39765094,Jacqueline,"This place was spotless and very comfortable. The cottage is about a 25 min drive from Downtown Seattle, but we didn't mind too much. The view from the cottage was worth it, it was lovely waking up and seeing Puget Sound every morning. 

This is a great place to sleep and drop your stuff, because it's just a bed (huge/comfy!) and a bathroom. Perfect for someone who is in town for a few days to see Seattle."
2737038,46298737,2015-09-09,40712432,Michelle,"Johnny was very responsive, gave easy instructions and we felt welcome and relaxed. The listing is accurate and if anything, understates its attributes. I can get phobic about cleanliness when I travel but the cottage completely appeased me. It is sleek and clean and done up with quality workmanship. The bed and the shower are glorious. When I saw the daybed in the ad I figured “backache” but I was wrong. It was quite comfy and so fresh smelling. The cottage is in a private, peaceful setting with an amazing, non-stop view. Wireless worked great. The neighborhood is lovely, and it is a good workout to walk through with its hilly streets."
2737038,46930695,2015-09-14,39748247,Elan,"The cottage was perfect for our short weekend getaway! The view is amazing, and the location feels surprisingly private. Even though it's in a neighborhood, the cottage is perfectly placed to not be staring at other houses. The location is close by Golden Gardens and you can easily get into Ballard, but it feels removed from the city at large -- great if you're looking for somewhere to relax after your adventures. Comfortable bed with lovely bedding + great view and amazing porch set up = wonderful. "
2737038,47744702,2015-09-21,42048174,Ann,"The Seattle Water View Cottage was exactly as described. We arrived late at night so the lights were left on for us and we were advised how to get in. Johnny replied to our two inquiry texts about directions/
restaurants promptly. When we had a chance to meet Johnny and his family, they were friendly and courteous. The cottage was sparkling clean. The pillows were fluffy and oh so comfortable. The view was incredible. We were happy with our first ever Airbnb selection."
2737038,48009294,2015-09-22,23914108,Karen,"This tiny cottage had a gorgeous view. It was a steep climb with luggage, but the lovely landscaping on both sides made it private.  It was airy with large sliding windows throughout. The modern bathroom was clean. Large bed but only 1 chair. Nice porch outside with 2 chairs but no roof or overhang so when it rained the second night we had limited places to sit. Hard to find location but Google map gave good directions."
2737038,48238791,2015-09-24,44303848,Ryan,"Johnny's cottage was clean and had a gorgeous view. The neighborhood that the cottage was located in was incredibly nice, and his directions were straightforward. Light sleepers might get a little annoyed by the train, but we thought it was kind of cool. "
2737038,48913382,2015-09-29,42245115,Sarah,"I thorough enjoyed my experience at the cottage. The view was great, the cottage was a good size for two people and I was able to bbq. However, I felt I was treated unfairly afterwards when I was told I was to pay $100 extra for cleaning up trash that I had left in bags and the smell of the bbq. Next time I do an airbnb I'll just take out my own trash and do their laundry for them."
2737038,49174817,2015-10-01,22265892,Andrew And Nikki,"Johnny's cottage was the perfect place to wake up in before a day in Seattle, and to relax in after. It was full of light when we wanted it to be, and dark when we didn't. The space was extremely clean, had a very comfortable bed and an incredible view of the water. Johnny was the perfect host and made sure we had what we needed, without being overbearing. We would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone who was interested."
2737038,50811715,2015-10-14,33098289,Sarah,"Lovely apartment, very clean and comfy. The view is fantastic!  Safe and interesting neighborhood. Host was very accommodating for our needs!"
2737038,51155916,2015-10-18,43822706,Fernando,"The place was fantastic and the view was beautiful. We had a great time staying at Johnny's place. The neighbors were very nice. There were some work trucks blocking nearby parking and his neighbor told us to park in her driveway for the night. I met Johnny went we arrived and he was very nice, too."
2737038,51485461,2015-10-20,38708263,Zhenghao,"Fantastic view! Gorgeous neighborhood! Though we didn't meet, Johnny communicated everything really well. Awesome wifi quality too!"
2737038,52055049,2015-10-26,41101522,Kevin,"The views were amazing! very clean and neat. we like the colors and decor. It's a great small place and very quiet!
Comfortable big bed with still room to move around and relax.
Everything was there just like he described too.
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying around Seattle!"
2737038,52374502,2015-10-28,46221862,Caitlin,"Directions from Johnny & the place itself were accurate and just what we were looking for. The view from the cottage is great, and location is right next to Golden Gardens park & Ballard neighborhood. No problem with parking."
2737038,52872621,2015-11-02,12128757,Christopher,"Johnny was a great host and the accommodations were no different. The place was very clean and were more than comfortable. As others have said, there is a bit of a hike to get up to the cottage, but it is well worth the spectacular view! My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our time here."
2737038,53690267,2015-11-11,13651295,Stephdaddy,Great location and beautiful scenery. I was very satisfied with my stay at johnny's place.
2737038,53917963,2015-11-14,10135617,Rachel,"The cottage was adorable! Very clean and in a safe and quiet neighborhood. If you are a light sleeper, the fan provided worked perfectly to drown out the train that goes by every once in awhile. I wished the bed was an actual king instead of a futon, it was still comfy. Johnny was great at communicating and was even kind enough to send up extra blankets and a flash light when there was warning of a power outage because of a wind storm (everything was fine thank goodness!). Just a heads up, if you are uncomfortable with stairs, this may not be the best place to stay. 
I am thrilled with my first airbnb experience! Thank you Johnny!"
2737038,54532858,2015-11-21,17492843,Joseph,"Come alone, or with someone you want to be alone with. Amazing view, comfy space, extremely peaceful. There is no tv and a lot of steps to the top, but it was just the peace and quiet I was seeking. The only thing I'd request would be a full body mirror. Would definately recommend and would definately stay again!"
2737038,54863871,2015-11-25,45307603,Monica,"This cottage is breathtaking. The view of Puget Sound cannot be beat. Everything was very clean and new. The bathroom is gorgeous and I really loved sitting on the front porch to enjoy the surroundings. Included in the room was everything I needed for my 4 night stay, plenty of towels, wifi, microwave, mini-fridge, plates, silverware, glasses, corkscrew etc. 
The cottage is very close to Ballard and surprisingly close to downtown. It was just far enough away to be very enjoyable. I highly recommend this listing!"
2737038,55428146,2015-12-01,40046331,Alexandra,"The cottage was cozy and offered beautiful views of the Puget Sound. The hike to it was a bit more than we expected with 2 large suitcases, but nonetheless absolutely worth it. We would stay here again. "
2737038,56014982,2015-12-07,46968969,Kathleen,The host canceled this reservation 210 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2737038,56055848,2015-12-08,10660278,George,Awesome place with a great view. Great location not too far from things in Ballard 
2737038,56648579,2015-12-15,22384106,Jordan,Great place! We loved staying in the cottage. Waking up to that view was spectacular. Thanks for letting us stay! 
2737038,56804079,2015-12-18,31477995,Julia,"I had a great stay at Johnnys place! It really is just a bed and a bathroom, but it was a lovely retreat for myself. The view is phenomenal and I walked down to Golden Gardens park in about 15 minutes which I highly recommend. It is very clean, the bed was super comfortable, and it's so cozy! "
7922373,55232024,2015-11-29,21660876,Maddy,"Derrill and Patty were amazing hosts! They made us feel so welcome into their home and provided us with a list of attractions in the area and some fun places to eat. 

 The space was cozy, private and super clean. It was exactly what we needed for a weekend away! "
4814894,25301686,2015-01-11,25803922,Alli,"Jill was so responsive and helpful in booking! We were very last minute and so it was great to be able to hear back so quickly and get everything locked down.
The apartment was so cute and cozy- it was easy to find and in a cool part of town. There were two bedrooms, a kitchen, a well-stoked bathroom and a beautiful view! 
We had a great stay here and I would definitely recommend this place for a weekend in Seattle. "

4814894,46536907,2015-09-11,43121758,Megan,"My fiancé and I came to Seattle to house hunt and this house was a perfect hub to work out of and a great location to come back and forth too. This was my first time using air BnB and we had a few challenges to work with, the first was that we have two dogs and happily Jill was accepting and open to having them in her home. The second was that my fiancé is currently in crutches after his recent knee surgery. This house was extremely easy for him to get in out and around, that made our trip way easier. Jill was really sweet and helpful the entire time, it was truly a great experience, I feel like I already have a friend here. As for the actual house, the beds were comfortable and the entirety was clean and organized. The kitchen was stocked with basic necessities and we had everything we needed, the direct TV was fully loaded too. If you are looking for a clean house in a great location this is it. Thanks again Jill! "

The location was perfect! We were in the heart of the city and were within walking distance to anywhere we needed to go. 
Overall a great experience!"
4814894,49290384,2015-10-02,45245505,Glenn,"Jill's place was neat, spacious, and super convenient to downtown and elsewhere in Seattle. We appreciated that her place is pet-friendly, in a nice, quiet neighborhood. Street parking was a breeze, too. "
4814894,50689347,2015-10-13,45285898,Joseph,"The property is so central to everything! It is not on a bus route, but we managed just fine. House is exactly as described, and Jill was very prompt in her replies to emails, etc."
4814894,52428493,2015-10-29,19917470,Kyle,"Jill was wonderful! She was very responsive leading up to the visit and the place was very clean when we arrived. It's also in the perfect Queen Anne location. We were lucky enough to meet Jill and she has a great personality. We didn't need to reach out to her during our stay but she did provide her contact information just in case. Thanks for the great spot, Jill!"
4814894,53504860,2015-11-09,6663442,Mayumi,"The apartment was cute and the neighborhood was quiet. If you are a cleanly person this is probably not the place to stay.  

The location was great. We were about 15 minutes to wherever we wanted to go in the city. There was always available street parking.

A few things to point out was the bathroom had cracked tile on the countertop and the bath tub had a stain that looked made it look like it hadn't been cleaned. The shower however was great and had good water pressure.  

There were a lot of cobwebs throughout the house with a web dangling from the bedroom with hair hanging from it. Don't look behind the curtains. There are a lot of spider leftovers on the window sills. There was also smeared bug stuff on one of the bedroom walls and just random stuff on the walls (hair, stains, etc). A bucket and a rag or a few gallons of paint would do wonders for this place.  

When we first walked into the home it smell really bad, like wet burned firewood and wet bathroom. This smell lingered our entire stay.  

Not really sure why but there were two mattresses just sitting in the living room. The beds were ok.  My buddy said her bed had a slight dip in it. The apartment was cold and unsure of how to turn the heat on but I'm sure you could ask the host. We didn't make any attempts to contact her regarding this.  

You cannot use the deck space because the door to the deck does not open. The wifi and the television worked great.  

Getting the keys to the place went smoothly. The host was really nice.  However the day of, the host was supposed to confirm a time frame when we would be able to get the keys and I had to text and call her before I got a response. There is a Keurig for coffee and the host left half and half which was great. For a two bedroom in Queen Anne this place is a deal. I'd pay a bit more for cleanliness.  

This apartment could be amazing. It just needs some love, a little more attention to detail and a good cleaning.  "
4814894,53854043,2015-11-13,48365919,Chris,"Jill was a great host. She was friendly and quick to respond during our trip. The property is in a nice, quiet neighborhood in the heart of Seattle. It is conveniently located near shops, restaurants, and area attractions."
4814894,54155969,2015-11-16,47574862,Mike,"This was just what I had hoped for. Great location, very roomy and the owner (Jill) was nice and helpful. We met for coffee to get the key and info about the place. It was clean and enjoyable. And Jill was great! I'll be back :)"
4814894,54526896,2015-11-21,6672508,Camelia,"This place was perfect for me - the fireplace was great and the apartment was very warm, clean, and inviting.  Great location too - quiet and lots of parking, but short ride right into town and action if you want that.  Thanks so much, Jill!"
4814894,57181511,2015-12-22,51262185,Rui,It was a wonderful time there. Jill was really nice and the house was awesome. There was a great view from the huge windows in the living room and also the house is pretty large so it's also a great house for party.
4814894,57612349,2015-12-27,40453534,Liang,"It has been great staying at Jill's place. It's nearly impossible to find a second house that  nearly excellent as Jill's place at such low rate. Great location, and the house has everything we need. Next time I come to Seattle I'll definitely stay there."
7093738,44459473,2015-08-26,39656334,Aurelia,"From our first enquiry about staying over at Ted’s I gathered that he would be a great host and he certainly was. He was quick to respond to questions and very accommodative regarding check-in and checkout times. Upon our arrival he went the extra mile to assist with our luggage, I really appreciated that! 

The house itself is as described: modern, clean, spacious and very well equipped.
Our room had one of the most comfortable beds. I loved the layout of the bathroom (Master bedroom).

Ted’s house is centrally located, a 10-15 minute drive to and from major attractions. 
We decided to not rent a car and to see more of Seattle by making use of public transportation (bus and UBER)-found it to be more cost effective plus it saves you from the hassle of having to pick and drop off a rental ☺. The bus stop is right outside the house – we used it to go downtown as well as to the light rail station, which took us to the airport.

Given Ted's hospitality and our comfortable stay, we highly recommend his place. "
5524847,30009632,2015-04-15,31160402,Serena,"Really nicely designed apartment! Everything was obviously brand new inside and had just been remodeled. Could use a few more signs, like what the wifi network and password is. All in all, wonderful and the hosts even left chocolate on the counter for us. The artwork is a really nice touch; very interesting and contemporary. Definitely would stay here again."
5524847,30959101,2015-04-29,21231359,Kelli,"Great place to stay. Well equipped, good wifi, comfy beds, quiet street, lots of towels.
Cool decor and art.
Would highly recommend."

All facilities are working great, it's clean and nice."
5524847,34645753,2015-06-10,3991644,Katherine,Very easy arrival with keyless entry- didn't require coordinating arrival times with owner.  It's a nice quiet neighborhood.  We liked the combined washer/dryer unit- had never seen that before.  
5524847,34880544,2015-06-13,32973808,Nicholas,"The host was great. Always willing to answer my questions through text messaging. Never actually met him, but the home was great."
5524847,35401740,2015-06-18,34063216,Robert,"Great place. Clean, lovely furnishing with a nice patio and yard. Nice, quiet neighborhood. Walking distance to bus route.  We loved it!"
5524847,35579343,2015-06-20,34223229,Raman,"House is very comfortable, clean and modern for 4 people.  I enjoyed my stay and will stay again in future.  I loved hosts attention to detail and everything as described was there from clean towels, clean beds, coffee machine, filters, iron etc.   "
5524847,35828568,2015-06-22,34063216,Robert,"WOW! Our first experience using AirBnB and Jay made it comfortable and easy for first timers.  The house/apt is clean and charming located in a nice, quiet neighborhood. It felt like home!  We had all the essentials but especially enjoyed the backyard patio and grill (morning coffee, evening meals). The location is fabulous.  We walked two blocks to catch a bus straight downtown to tourist attractions(Pike's Market, the Needle, the EMP, etc.).  
Thank you, Jay!  We had a wonderful stay!  :D"
5524847,36220288,2015-06-26,3065140,Kathy,"A clean and comfortable duplex in a pretty quiet residential neighborhood. A good spot for a work trip. Fred Meyer is minutes away. The internet didn't work too well, the TV signal wasn't great and the DVD player was broken. So late night entertainment was limited. But overall, we enjoyed the place and thought it was fairly priced. I only messaged with the operator of the property when I booked it. After that, the contact person was someone else, I think from a management company. But she was very quick to respond."
5524847,36692226,2015-06-30,16287658,Lorien,"We enjoyed staying at Jafon and Serena's place in Greenwood.  It's obviously a newly redone unit, and has been tastefully decorated.  The original artwork is a nice touch.  There's a fun commercial district at 85th and Greenwood and a playground a few blocks away, making this a great location.  Only complaint was that it was in the 90s during our visit, and the unit was brutally hot since there aren't many windows.  A few fans could help with that, and I can't imagine that that kind of weather is too common."
5524847,38708384,2015-07-18,32237834,Caitlin,"The neighborhood was residential but one block away from a busy commercial district, but fairly quiet.  It was really hot and the unit only had one fan, maybe a few more to get the air circulating would be nice.  It was nice to have some condiments and other cooking items available.  The bedrooms were big, furniture and appliances throughout were all new and artwork was cool.  The television worked but had few channels available.  The wifi and the streaming chromecast option was difficult the navigate. Didn't use the DVD player because we had no DVDs, maybe having a few DVDs available would be nice.  Location was close to transportation and street parking was easy. There were lots of towels and bathroom supplies available.  When I emailed with questions/problems, they responded quickly with solutions. "
5524847,39285194,2015-07-22,33693333,Laurie,"Jafon's place was cute, clean and as described. Plenty of towels, nice linens, and great layout. Coffee, tea, condiments all thoughtfully provided. Communication was excellent although he was not in town. We did experience a heat advisory while we were there (unusual for Seattle) which required us going out to buy two more fans, but Jafon is reimbursing us. Tip for keeping costs down: take light rail from Seatac to end (Pioneer Sq), walk about a block and take E line bus which goes up Aurora Ave to 91st St stop. House is one block from stop and total cost is about $7 pp. To get downtown we used same bus and $2.50 tix seemed to be applicable all day even when we switched buses."
5524847,39541400,2015-07-24,26230371,John,"We had a great time staying in this home. It was a very quiet neighborhood. Its only 10 to 15 minutes from several places we visited like the Aquarium, Minors Landing, Argosy cruises, pikes Market and more. The hosts were helpful and were available for any questions we had. We can tell the home is well taken care of and thoughtfully arranged."
5524847,40129144,2015-07-28,28733193,Kevin,"Great stay, very near to aurora ave where all the foods and groceries are. Very near to northgate area where i used to live. Very recommended"
5524847,43044576,2015-08-17,34603571,Sam,Lovely place to stay!! Very clean - comfortable beds - nice neighbourhood. I would definitely recommend to friends!
5524847,43563732,2015-08-20,40965601,Dianna M.,"Our host was wonderful and responsive in communication with us before and during our stay. The home was lovely and the space was perfectly laid out-the kitchen was a great space for making our stay feel like a home away from home. An added bonus was the outdoor space and seating, which was really relaxing to settle into and enjoy during meals or for post-dinner drinks. 

The location was key and convenient to Greenwood center and accessible to Aurora Ave for getting around to other main throughways.

I highly recommend this space, the aesthetics, and the thoughtfulness of the host!"
5524847,48593210,2015-09-27,43732909,Jeremy,Was a very well thought out & designed Airbnb experience with all we needed for our 5 night stay. Hosts were awesome & helped out when the booking system fell over. Thanks so much!
5524847,51383919,2015-10-19,8145308,Scott,"We had a great stay. Location was perfect. Quick access to I-5. The house was clean and there were plenty of towels, etc... Beds were comfy too. Would definitely recommend staying here on a visit to Seattle. And btw, thx for the chocolate bar. :)"
5524847,54465707,2015-11-20,27853192,QingQing,"The house was a very nice location for us, we enjoyed the stay very much. Serena was easy to get in touch and very helpful. We would want to come back again next time we are visiting the area!"
5524847,57450176,2015-12-26,49272783,Imee,The owners were very responsive and accommodating - they allowed us to check in early and left a dark chocolate treat for us which was very welcome after a long drive.  The location was perfect for us as it was very close to where my daughter just moved to.  The house was smaller than I thought it would be given the pictures and the aerial view of the house but you can't beat the price and the location.  The bedrooms could use some dressers or luggage holders especially for stays beyond a couple of days.   A DVD player would have been nice to have especially since it was raining the entire time and we were not able to take advantage of the backyard or outdoors as expected.  Again - the location was perfect and the price was definitely reasonable.  
5792683,38526111,2015-07-16,10139607,Michael,"I stayed here for a few weeks prior to a relocation, and I had a great stay.  The place is the lower floor of a very modern, new house so everything looks good and is in great order. It was really nice to have such a large space, and my own bath room, storage closet, and washer+dryer for doing my laundry. Highly recommended!"
5792683,39209501,2015-07-21,27324334,Jose,"This was a nice modern studio in a converted basement of the owners home. The owner provides snacks and toiletries that were much appreciated. Comes with mini fridge, microwave and portable burners. The location was nice by a park and centrally located. The owner responded promptly to our messages and checked in to make sure we needed anything often. I would stay here again and recommend it to others. My wife and I used it as a crash pad as we were out 14 hrs a day during our trip. "
5792683,44106876,2015-08-24,3912578,D'Ana,I had a fabulous time here last time I was in Seattle. Hila and her husband were very helpful and welcoming. The apartment was very cozy with s nice big bed and has a separate entrance to the apartment. To get to the space needle area of Seattle it's either a 10min uber or an hour walk which really wasn't bad because the weather is so mild in Seattle in the summer. There's also a nice park nearby with a playground and plenty of space to jog or bike around. All in all it was a great stay and I would totally stay here again. :) 
5792683,45788658,2015-09-06,37279071,Jesus,She was a great host! Checked in with me to make sure everything was in order and I was accomodated.
5761290,35693084,2015-06-21,34321991,Takashi,"Jim and Katie did a very nice job welcoming us including some foods in the fridge. The house was clean and everything was there for us. Friendly neighbors around. Quick access to the Green lake. This is the first floor of a 2 story house, and the stairs are blockaded by some veneer, but not a big issue for us.

Overall, our stay was fantastic. Thanks Jim and Katie!"
5761290,37494374,2015-07-07,35515938,Hennessy,This was my first experience with AirBnB and everything was perfect.  Jim & Katie were right there to walk me through the entire process and answered any questions I had in a timely manner.  Location was perfect.  Thanks Jim & Katie.
5761290,38340223,2015-07-14,30181011,Kim,Great apartment. Enjoyed staying there with my husband and baby.  Everything we needed including a fan (it was a warmish week).  Very close to great restaurants and a grocery store.  
5761290,39052767,2015-07-20,34261507,Lee,Never been to Seattle so didn't know where to stay and took a shot.  Turned out to be a great choice. Perfect place to stay. Easy to get to and surrounding areas were great places to go.  The place was very clean and comfortable.  Highly recommended!!!
5761290,39952578,2015-07-27,31858949,Adam,"Everything at Jim's place was great, and the fresh muffins were a nice touch. I had never been to Seattle before and it was a really nice, quiet neighborhood that also had tons of places to eat and walk around nearby. "
5761290,40530010,2015-07-31,18312899,Michael,Very attentive. 
5761290,40761907,2015-08-02,20574858,Erika,Jim's house was great and exactly as I expected. It had everything we needed! We spent a lot of time riding bikes around town and exploring the city. Greenlake was beautiful and the home was in a great location! Jim was a great host! 
5761290,42491378,2015-08-13,3684874,David,"Pleasant, clean, spacious unit competitivly priced in nice area. Just what I was looking for.  I can recommend this place."
5761290,43985200,2015-08-23,31833522,Romi,Great place! We were a family of 4 including a 7 week baby and this place worked out really well for all our needs. 
5761290,44867570,2015-08-29,15291414,Doki,"Everything was perfect. Communication before and during my stay. Location, Internet tv access house access all idiot proof and well communicated. Great comfi place on top. HBO was a nice bonus."
5761290,48040056,2015-09-22,2983157,Quyen,"Review for 7342 15th Ave NE:  My husband and I were selling our house and chose this Air BNB location to stay in while our house was on the market for a week. We had originally booked the 2 BR UW/Greenlake apartment for 1 week. Jim had mistakenly double-booked us in the middle of our itinerary dates but was quick to acknowledge and correct the problem. He offered to us another of his properties in an adjacent neighborhood. This was appreciated as it was an upgrade to a charming Craftsman with more space for us (we have twin 1 year old girls). The space was very nice and clean with nice furniture. Jim and the house supervisor Tony were always available for prompt communication via text or email. The kitchen was well stocked for multiple guests (with a very good dishwasher--a PLUS!) and there were plenty of cleaning supplies to clean up after ourselves. 

It is on a busy arterial which can be quite loud during commuting hours if you choose to open windows or leave the front door open. Nevertheless, the kids were well entertained by the sirens of firetrucks every day!

If we weren't selling our house and moving out of the state, we would definitely save this as a location for visiting family members to stay in.  We appreciated our time there! "
5761290,56741191,2015-12-17,3463253,Tamara,"Jim's space is in a quiet neighborhood with easy street parking. The ground floor apartment was spacious and well appointed. We used the space while my husband had major surgery at UWMC and for his first week of recovery and it was perfect. It is a 2 mile, 10 min trip by car to the medical center. Jim provided plenty of linens and pillows and the access to a washer and dryer were perfect. The ability to access the apartment off of the alley without steps made getting around much easier than many Seattle properties. Jim is a low-touch host and we communicated through text messaging which worked well."
2033191,13045023,2014-05-18,9128324,DeWitt,"My family and I stayed at Paul's wonderful Green Lake home for two weeks in May.

The downstairs apartment was ideal in every way for our extended visit. The bedrooms and living and dining rooms were spacious and offered plenty of light, (and a beautiful view of the lake right across the street), and the kitchen was fully equipped with every appliance and cooking utensil we could think of. Paul and his family have clearly made a tremendous effort to make their guests feel welcome, going out of their way to make sure we had everything we need.

The house itself couldn't be better located. We walked around the lake nearly every day, and there are a number of great restaurants and coffee shops within blocks. Street parking right next to the apartment was never an issue, even when the everyone came out to enjoy the beautiful weather on the lake.

We miss it already, and would happily recommend Paul's Green Lake home to anyone visiting Seattle anytime soon."
2033191,14547919,2014-06-22,11586014,Iliana,The host was very generous with the staples in the apt. the coffee was fabulous.  The location was excellent and the view of the lake is amazing.  We also enjoyed the size of the apt.  We'll definitely stay here again when visiting Seattle.
2033191,15906821,2014-07-18,11642170,Kate,It was a huge pleasure to stay at Paul's property. Anyone looking for a fabulous Seattle local experience will not be down by this choice. Centrally located to everything you can imagine. The neighborhood itself is charming and convenient. Paul and Susan has always been considerate and responsive. The property is clean and has everything you will need for a pleasant stay. The owner are generous to offer any possible things you will need for a quality life. Imagine staying in a house where you will just be one cross away from the beautiful lake and dozens of nice restaurants around. I will definitely choose to stay here again if ever revisiting Seattle.
2033191,16460469,2014-07-28,15066942,Christine,"Green Lake was the perfect spot for us and Paul's place with a lovely lake view made it even better. It's easy to walk around the lake to the playground or nearby shops, and the space itself is clean, well maintained, and pleasantly accommodated/decorated. Paul made us feel right at home with a PacknPlay and high chair already set up, and Peet's coffee for a much needed pick me up. The space feels private even though the family is upstairs, and though there is some walking above noise occasionally, though with the windows closed you can barely hear the street noise. It feels comfortable, easy, and I'd stay again on a return trip to Seattle."
2033191,17039024,2014-08-06,202006,Ken,"My family and I had a pleasant and comfortable 8-day stay here. Paul was very helpful before and after we arrived in town, answering my questions about the house, the neighborhood, and things to do with the kids. We loved the Green Lake area and the beautiful view we had from the patio. Paul was also conscientious about making the place child-safe for our young children -- they also played with the toys provided in the apartment. It was also great to have the pack-and-play and high chair right there when we arrived. We would certainly want to stay here again the next time we are in Seattle!"
2033191,17208265,2014-08-09,2844363,Arron,"Paul's place on Green Lake was absolutely perfect for our family of three. It had everything we needed, including a wonderful little room for our 2.5 year old that she loved. Not to mention, the location right across from lake cannot be beat. We only stayed 3 nights, but would have been happy to stay longer!"
2033191,17555250,2014-08-14,14810706,Karina,Everything about our stay was as near perfect as could possibly be. Paul was there when we arrived and immediately I felt welcome by his warm greeting.The  space is so lovely with all the amenities one would need (even a washer and dryer).  We had been traveling for several days and to come into such a comfortable and attractive  space was most appreciated. Two very small problems with my not understanding how to close the dryer door and once not being able to unlock the  apartment door  were both quickly and graciously resolved and forgotten in four days of a very pleasant and satisfying time in beautiful and wonderful accommodations. Since my son lives nearby the location was great to visit with his family and then to have our own space when we needed. Being close to the new PPC was also a plus.  As  a retired teacher and accustomed to a letter grading system  I give   this rental an A+ and would love to return anytime. 
2033191,18308686,2014-08-25,14520064,Yuval & Cece,"Paul's apartment is the perfect place to stay in Seattle!  The house is overlooking Green Lake, with great views and the lakeside activities right across the street, and easy street parking right next to the house.  It's also just a few blocks away from a coffee shop, grocery store, restaurants, etc.  

The apartment itself is set up really well with plenty of extra towels & bedding, a well-equipped kitchen, and coffee, chocolates, & flowers to welcome guests.  As a family with young kids, it was a dream, as there were foam cushions on sharp corners, some toys and kids movies, a pack & play bed, and even a baby bath.  And everything was sparkling clean.

We will definitely stay here again next time we're in Seattle! "
2033191,18790247,2014-09-01,16101382,Tilmann,"Pauls Appartement hat einen schönen Blick auf den See und den Park dazwischen. Es ist Individuell und gemütlich (website hidden)/Entertainmentist der zeitgemäß.  Die Küchenausstattung ist perfekt. Bad/Dusche ist gut, die Handtücher und die gestellten Seifen, Shampoos usw. sehr gut. In dem Schlaf- und dem Kinderschlafzimmer lässt es sich gut und leise schlafen. 
Ein Appartement zum Wohlfühlen. Einen Parkplatz findet man immer fast direkt vor dem Haus. Mit dem Auto sind es 5 Minuten bis zum PCC wo es die leckersten Dinge zum Essen gibt.
Sehr zu empfehlen."
2033191,19047718,2014-09-05,7034996,Ross,Lovely spot. Nice little in-law apartment in a wonderful neighborhood. Parking was always available. It was perfectly outfitted for our toddler. Would be happy to rent again!
2033191,19778892,2014-09-18,17936834,Rosemary,"We loved the apartment!! It was a perfect location for us. It’s right across the street from Green Lake which is a much loved and well used Seattle Park which always seems alive. There are a number of small, interesting, restaurants very nearby. Street parking was always available and easy, and the location is extremely convenient to I-5 and the University District.

The apartment itself is set up very well with a fully-equipped kitchen. The great kitchen combined with a Whole Foods just a few blocks away is a real plus. Also, the kitchen was well supplied with a number of staples, so we could have coffee and tea as soon as we arrived.

The fresh flowers and chocolates were a great touch!! The apartment was clean, and there were plenty of extra towels, bedding and toiletries. While our children are now grown, the second bedroom is really well set up for young children.  

We strongly recommend the apartment. The best recommendation we can give is that we certainly intend to return to this location anytime it’s available when we are in Seattle.

Thanks, Paul. You do a great job!!"
2033191,20151703,2014-09-24,5209629,Vojko,"The apartment is great, really spacious – even nicer than on the photos – and the location is just perfect, overlooking the Green Lake. We liked a well-equipped kitchen, so that you really can cook, and a complimentary, like coffee, tea, chocolates etc. There were even flowers to welcome us when we came. And Paul was a perfect host. He even drove us to the nearest Whole Foods Market on a first day. Really appreciated. Thank you Paul. "
2033191,22500722,2014-11-08,6412778,Jeff,"Wow!!! what a great place, great location, great host. Everything in the listing is even better than described. Paul and his family were wonderful hosts. The apartment was clean when we arrived and they even left coffee and snacks for us which was an unexpected touch. The location is right on the lake which is more than we could have asked for. Overall this is one of the best I've found on Airbnb. We will stay here again!!!"
2033191,23978135,2014-12-15,24631219,Andrew,"The flat was comfortable, well-appointed and the location is superb, as the photo's indicate. Paul was very helpful re. bike hire but in fact you have a choice of bus routes to downtown and the UW campus. I also loved watching the night-time community walk around Green Lake, snug behind the patio doors."
2033191,24540596,2014-12-30,15613527,Sue,"We loved our stay! The location is absolutely beautiful. Rain or shine, the view of Green Lake from the dining and living room is just gorgeous.  The proximity to highways, quaint local shops, downtown Seattle, grocery stores, etc. is ideal.

The apartment (and property) is super clean and offers ample space. It's perfect for 2 couples or a small family.  (In other words, the apt. is kid friendly, with toys, pack-n-play & high chair at your request. But if you don't have kids, the home is equally comfortable for two couples). Towels and linens were nice quality (much appreciated!) and lots of little extras in the loo, in case you forget anything at home. Washer and dryer are a definite plus!

We love to cook and the kitchen is well appointed with everything you need. The kitchen is an open floor plan to the dining and living rooms, so it's a great set-up for enjoying guests while preparing meals.

The homeowners were super gracious; there if you need them but they offer guests plenty of privacy too. We rented during the holidays and the homeowners even had a little Christmas tree, fresh flowers and other seasonal decor awaiting our arrival. Great touch!

We're looking forward to staying at the apartment again during warmer months so we can take advantage of the outdoor seating that looks out towards the lake. But even in December, it was awesome to walk around the lake, since it's only steps away!"
2033191,25495588,2015-01-18,21337830,Allycea,Excellent experience with our stay on Green Lake. Though our host Paul and his family were out of town he did a great job preparing for my family. Our two boys loved thier room and the perfectly sized kids craft table. The perfect retreat for families with young kids. We walked everywhere due to the central location of the Green lake apartment. We felt welcomed with a welcome basket waiting for us and lots of supplies stocked for the day to day. The house was clean and lovely. All around great experience. When Paul and his family came back into town he checked in on us to see if we needed anything. Absolutely encourage vacationing at Paul's Green lake apartment.
2033191,26688716,2015-02-17,385052,Kieron,"My wife and I with our ten year old son stayed at Paul's rental on a recent long weekend getaway to Seattle. 

It's a wonderful spot in a great location. I've always favored the Green Lake area because some friends used to live in Wallingford. It's a really nice relaxed part of town and a great retreat from the chaos of downtown. Although this place is right on a fairly busy street that surrounds the lake, it's surprisingly quiet inside the unit. 

Unfortunately Paul and his family were out of town the same weekend we stayed so we didn't get to meet them. But their hospitality and thoughtfulness were apparent nevertheless. Everything was tidy, clean, and well organized. My son loves to draw and appreciated the drawing materials and table in the living room. The beds were comfortable and there were plenty of extra linens and pillows, etc. 

There are lots of great things to see and do throughout the Seattle area. Despite a few suggestions from Paul, we really ended up doing straightforward touristy Seattle stuff and nothing unusual or noteworthy. But the weather was awesome and we very much enjoyed walking around the lake each morning before setting out on our day. 

It should be noted that the proximity to both Peet's Coffee and Might O Donuts also make this location a great choice in places to stay. ;)

Thanks for the hospitality! I'm sure we'll be back. 

"
2033191,27056395,2015-02-24,26364699,Sue,"We stayed at Paul's place for about 5 days/4 nights and couldn't have asked for a better experience.  Nothing was left to be desired.  Upon hearing we were traveling with our one year old daughter, Paul & his wife put extra effort into making sure our visit was as comfortable as possible.  They even set up their pack-n-play for our daughter to use.  The location of their property was superb.  You could throw a stone and hit the lake, although I don't recommend doing so.  The neighborhood had all the amenities you'd desire...diverse restaurants, excellent grocery stores, bars, coffee shops, etc.  Heading into downtown Seattle took no time at all.  It seemed like getting anywhere took no time at all.  The fact we could stroll around the lake whenever we desired without having to drive anywhere was pure bliss.  Unfortunately, we only ran into Paul once during our stay.  He's a standout guy who we would've enjoyed spending more time with so he could educate us on the area and get his thoughts and opinions on living in Washington, considering we're thinking of a move.  Something tells me he'd be more than happy to have obliged, if we had the time.  All in all, staying at his place beat the pants (and whole attire) off of staying at a hotel.  Everything you need and more."
2033191,28171163,2015-03-19,26857900,Laurel,"This place deserves more than five stars.  Paul and Susan have gone above and beyond to think of anything one could need, plus the house itself and the surrounding area are absolutely beautiful.  

My husband and I stayed for 4 nights with our one-year-old daughter, and having this place as our home base absolutely *made* our vacation.  Great location; doesn't take long to drive anywhere around the city.  We loved the feel of Green Lake, walked the lake several times, got coffee, and hung out at the park.  We were so thankful to have a comfortable, aesthetically pleasing place to hang out, while our daughter slept (and played with all the toys).  Paul clearly communicated every detail.  I'm not exaggerating; their place is an amazing find.  Exceeded our expectations.  "
2033191,28516703,2015-03-25,3169620,Rebecca,"We had a great experience staying at this apartment for 3 nights. Communication with Paul was easy and fast, and when we arrived we found the apartment sparkling clean and well stocked, plus extra touches like flowers, coffee, and chocolates. The lake is literally across the street and our girls (5&8) enjoyed jaunts over there to walk around and look at the ducks. The apartment has lots of stuff for kids, including a well 
stocked kids art table, books, toys, and kids movies. If you're in town to explore for a few days like we were, you can't beat the location. We would definitely stay here again!"
2033191,28879420,2015-03-31,27789703,Peg,"Paul gave us helpful information regarding parking, etc. prior to our arrival, appeared the moment we arrived and greeted us warmly, gave us complete contact information and let us know he would be available for anything we might need, and made us feel, in a word, welcome.  The location provided easy access to Seattle and ready access (across the street!) to beautiful Green Lake and the surrounding park.  The description and pictures of the apartment on the website were  completely accurate, so there were no surprises.  The apartment was spotless.  The kitchen was well-equipped, and there was coffee in the refrigerator and flowers on the table.  Although Paul was readily available (upstairs, in fact), he never intruded on our privacy.  Our experience was first-class.  We would definitely stay here in the future and recommend it to others."
2033191,31031737,2015-05-01,26293144,Leslie,"H- It is a perfect Greenlake experience! The location across the street from the lake was wonderful! Paul & Susan could not have been more 
accommodating or helpful! Highly recommend-will be back! neat clean and had every amenity-fantastic!"
2033191,31784258,2015-05-10,24387132,Kaili,"Paul and Susan are wonderful hosts. Apartment was immaculate and in a prime location across from greenlake park. The kitchen was fully stocked with gourmet chocolate truffles, fresh flowers and excellent coffee. Paul even helped find a date night sitter for our two kids. Can't recommend highly enough. Will be back soon. "
2033191,32571106,2015-05-19,31976239,Elaine,"This lovely apartment is even prettier than I expected with a view of Green Lake and outside patio with Adirondack chairs. We felt very welcome with Paul and Susan obviously going out of their way by displaying fresh flowers and providing treats, coffee, and even beer in the fridge. They kept in touch with us to be sure everything was going smoothly which it did. The apartment is spotless and nicely furnished. The beds were comfortable. The kitchen is well stocked with nice dishes, utensils and cookware. The bathroom had plenty of toiletries and extra towels. We were pleasantly surprised by the easy parking on the street. The Green Lake area has become my favorite part of Seattle with lovely scenery and plenty of nice restaurants and bars with easier parking than Fremont or Ballard.  My daughter and I stayed here for 3 nights and I wished we could have stayed longer. It's a perfect location for visiting families of UW students as the University district is an easy 12 minute drive. The Seattle Center was also a short drive away. "
2033191,33372095,2015-05-27,13777689,Ann,"When we arrived flowers were on the dining table, and a bag of chocolates on the counter.  I had difficulty finding the apartment door, but I phoned Paul, and as promised, he was immediately available to assist.  The house overlooks Green Lake, which has a beautiful path going around for walking or jogging."
2033191,33898197,2015-06-02,7305341,Elisabeth,"Paul was very thoughtful. He left messages and instructions. The apartment was in great shape with a charming bouquet on the table. Everything was as specified or better. The kitchen is well appointed and there was very welcome tea and coffee supplies.
The apartment is a real find; the location is ideal. The place is very quiet and the patio offers a stunningly beautiful view of Green Lake. There are stores in the area including a couple of nice cafes.
My family met Paul in person and liked his caring presence.
On the whole this host deserves five stars if that's the highest rating. We hope to return to that location soon."
2033191,34654467,2015-06-10,23677905,Jim,"Amazing host. Paul and his wife were welcoming and available for extra needs, such as a cooler and ice packs for a last minute picnic. The apartment was very well stocked with all the cooking and serving needs one could ever want, lots of bathroom amenities as well.
 ( soaps, shampoo, etc....) 
The apartment is right across from Greenlake with great views and access.
We will definitely be staying there again in the future."
2033191,35063934,2015-06-15,27603144,Melinda,"Wonderful place to stay while in Seattle. Great location close to U district. Super clean. Beautiful view of the lake. Very quiet day and night. Paul was easy to communicate with via text, email and phone. Fully stocked house including baby toys and blankets which was nice as my son and daughter in law decided to bring their infant at the last minute. Fresh flowers and a nice little box of chocolates upon arrival. No more hotels for me! I highly recomend this place and would be my first choice upon returning to Seattle.  "
2033191,35377081,2015-06-18,30799072,Eugene,"We absolutely ENJOYED our stay here. The house was PERFECT for our family of five (three kids 4 and under). Immediately when we walked in, we were blown away by all the features of the house. Our two older kids LOVED the craft table and were so excited to get their crafts going. The house was so well baby-proofed that we had no worries letting our 10mo old crawl around. Both rooms were very comfortable, bathroom amenities were well stocked, kitchen had more than enough utensils/pots/pans for us. Everything was perfect.

And the icing on the cake was undoubtedly the location of this home. Literally across the street from Green Lake. Absolutely beautiful views. We were at the park every single day and the kids loved it.

If/when we ever come back to Seattle, we would definitely consider staying here again! Thank you so much Paul for the hospitality!"
2033191,36000090,2015-06-24,27899796,Sally,"Went to Seattle on a trip with our grandson.  We could not have found a better location.  He even caught some fish in Green Lake!  We enjoyed the area, the accessibility to the places we visited, the quiet neighborhood and the unit.  Paul even arranged time for our grandson to kick around the soccer ball with some neighborhood kids.  The unit was very well-equipped and comfortable.  Thanks Paul and family."
2033191,36651353,2015-06-30,27226816,Natasha,"We stayed for about 5 nights. The host made us feel very welcome. The home was clean and had everything we needed. Great space in a great location. Check in and out was also very easy. We would recommend it, and we would rent it again in the future. "
2033191,37298138,2015-07-06,30719265,Victor,Paul was a gracious host. He was available upon our arrival and knowledgeable about the area. The apartment was clean and as advertised. The experience was very pleasant.
2033191,37832431,2015-07-11,28070246,Sasha,"This space was perfect for our needs: close to the university, walking distance to recreation/restaurants, and very comfortable, spacious and up to date.  Thoughtful touches included popsicles and fans during our heatwave arrival, in addition to a full kitchen, tea and coffee, and a kids room/area filled with kids' games, books and craft materials.  We also appreciated the laundry set up in the hallway.  Greenlake was a beautiful area to call home for our stay, and we only had to cross the street to be on the 2.8 mile walking trail around the lake.    Our host was available any time we had questions.  "
2033191,38476538,2015-07-16,26928005,Clifford,"Firstly, the Wallingford / Green Lake scene is perfect for a vacation to a major city; so close, yet a very laid-back atmosphere.  A lap around the lake, pitch & putt golf and so many restaurant choices within walking distance of this fantastic property.  This is a well-equipped 2 BR apartment overlooking the lake that couldn't be sweeter!  We had our son & GF in-tow and the rooming situation / privacy was A+.  We look forward to staying here again."
2033191,39148044,2015-07-21,29027274,Tracey,Great location. Spectacular sunsets. Walk to restaurants and swimming lake. Very comfortable apartment. 
2033191,39665629,2015-07-25,13873712,Dan,"This place was perfect!  We were in town to visit 2 of our kids in Seattle.  The space was as advertised, close to downtown and the Green Lake area is a wonderful place to be!  We utilized the walking path around the lake as well as the paddle boat rental.  We hung out with the kids in a comfortable space, which is something you surely can't do in a hotel.  Parking was easy and close. Paul was helpful to our inquiries.  We would definitely stay here again and more than likely will!"
2033191,40077278,2015-07-28,10319703,Kristi,"When we arrived at this lovely property there were flowers, chocolates, fresh ground coffee in the  fridge, and a detailed note regarding the wifi, laundry, extra keys, etc, as well as cell phone numbers to get touch with Paul or his wife if we had further questions.  What a wonderful welcome!  The home is in a perfect location, literally across the street from Greenlake, yet quiet and very private.   We enjoyed sitting on the flagstone patio in the morning with coffee and in the evening watching the sunset.  The apartment is exactly as described, only better!  The kitchen is extremely well equipped, and the entire apartment was very clean and organized.   There is public transportation close by,and there are markets and restaurants within walking distance.  I highly recommend this airbnb!"
2033191,40410565,2015-07-30,39664832,Ryan,"Paul was awesome. I ran pretty late on that day aster trying to contact a couple hosts before him with no success. Paul responded within SECONDS and save my family that night. Much appreciated!

The place is a wonder. It is located right across the green lake so you ll get a marvelous lake view. The property is super clean and organized. Thanks to Paul's hospitality, we got coffee, tea, cooking utensils, and a private laundry room that you won't find in a hotel. I highly recommend this house and will definitely contact Paul the next time we visit Seatle again."
2033191,40634013,2015-08-01,25671153,Katherine,Paul and his wife were wonderful hosts! Very accommodating and responsive via text throughout our stay. Kitchen and bathrooms were well-equipped with essential items and even non-essential items that come in handy when you least expect it to! Lake view was wonderful and my parents enjoyed watching the sunset from the patio.
2033191,42106509,2015-08-11,7461048,Kent,"We rented the bottom floor of the 3 floor house that Paul, his wife Susan, and their 2 children have.  It was a fantastic location and sat high above Greenlake Way East with a view west of Greenlake.  It was so convenient to walk across the street and enjoy the Greenlake atmosphere.   Paul was an incredible and quite gracious host.  He was so very helpful in attending to any questions or issues we might have.   We really appreciated dealing with someone who was so nice and also let us have our privacy.   Paul even let me have access to his bike to use in biking Greenlake and the Burke Gilman Trail.   We spent our anniversary at the house and Paul welcomed us with a bottle of champagne and a dozen rozes.  What a wonderful surprise and a nice touch! We unfortunately had to leave a day early due to a family emergency, but Paul was very understanding.  He and his family are very busy themselves!   There is even a PCC grocery store nearby as well as a host of restaurants and taverns within walking distance.   We even took the bus downtown once and it comes only a couple blocks away.  All in all, a nice place to use as a base to all sorts of Seattle activities.  "
2033191,42679721,2015-08-15,20535039,Marc,"Fantastic host, fantastic apartment, fantastic location. Paul was super helpful and friendly before and during the trip. The apartment was perfect for us (including 2 small children) - stocked with everything you would need including kids' toys. Very clean and comfortable. The house is right on Green Lake, within walking distance of restaurants, groceries, shopping, paddle boats, and bars (and the Lake trail). Plenty of parking in front of house despite the popular area. We will certainly ask to stay here again next time we come back to Seattle. "
2033191,44281014,2015-08-25,31050325,Jenny,"The apt was clean and well equipped. Clear and helpful instructions were left for us. Excellent communication from the time of booking and until we left. Great neighborhood, just a short walk to restaurants, supermarket etc. a bus stop around the corner made traveling easy. 
Great apt great host. Thank you Paul. "
2033191,44756089,2015-08-29,989825,Paige,"We had a wonderful week staying here.  Perfect for walking around Green Lake everyday, close to the Zoo, parking on the street was no problem.   I loved working from the apt. Great light! Thank you for a fun week. "
2033191,45718344,2015-09-05,21452621,Joseph,"Paul's apartment was a great place for my wife, my son and I to stay while in Seattle.  The apartment was very clean and well-appointed, and was an easy apartment to have a young child in as well.  We were delighted with out choice to stay here.  The location on Green Lake is ideal for walking out your door and taking a morning run around the lake!"
2033191,46224114,2015-09-08,465281,Scott,"I stayed with Paul on a Seattle ""staycation"" with my wife and newborn over Labor Day weekend. The trip was perfect. The apartment is well-furnished for traveling with kids. Paul even loaned us a pack-n-play and baby bathtub. We appreciated having laundry in the apartment, and the well-stocked kitchen for cooking relaxing dinners (PCC is a short walk away for groceries).

The real gem of this apartment is the proximity to Green Lake Park. You can take your morning coffee out on the patio and watch the morning joggers take laps around the lake. The park is right across the street, and is great for walking, running, picnicking and people-watching. Along the loop you'll hit downtown Greenlake, which has a nice variety of cute restaurants and shops.

Highly recommended! Thanks for everything, Paul!"
2033191,47699183,2015-09-21,14566535,Christine,This listing is a beautiful space in a great spot which is very walkable and convenient for parking as well. It has all the amenities you need to feel comfortable in your home-away-from-home. There are special touches from the thoughtful host. It is a great listing for traveling with kids and just go over and above to meet any additional needs. The host was very responsive and kind and thoughtful as well. 
2033191,48391839,2015-09-26,326571,Margret,"Our family had a wonderful stay in this apartment. Everything in the apartment is so well set up and we had everything we needed. Our family enjoyed the lake views, access to the lake side running trails, and all the apartment amenities. We would love to stay here again on a future Seattle visit! "
2033191,49012566,2015-09-30,41243404,Ginger,"We really enjoyed our stay by Green Lake.  Paul was a great host and made us feel very welcome.  WE were VERY being tourists during our visit so we did not get to enjoy the apartment as much as we would have liked.  The location is awesome, close to  everything.  Although we do not have small children, the apratement was certainly equipped to make the little ones happy.  We would definately stay here again when visiting Seatlle.

2033191,49404457,2015-10-03,45376296,Judith,"Our stay at Paul's Green Lake house couldn't have been better. We arrived after dark. Paul's detailed instructions made that part easy. Fresh flowers and chocolates greeted us and, after a very comfortable and good night's sleep, we awoke to see that we were perched high above a beautiful lake, sparkling in the sunshine. The next order of business had to be coffee (kindly provided by Paul) in an Adirondack chair overlooking the perfect October morning on the lake. Inside all was pristine, comfortable and convenient. The presence of children's toys added a homey feel and the kitchen was wonderfully equipped. Obviously Paul and Susan appreciate the finer points of enjoying cooking as the place had every imaginable tool, the knives were carefully protected and the one cookbook in view was a huge volume from The French Laundry. Wish we'd had time to really take advantage of it all.  I even liked washing dishes as the view out the window over the kitchen sink is so nice! The shower was strong and satisfying, towels soft and abundant. Beds so comfy. We enjoyed the three-mile walk around the lake as well as the short walk up to the business district where we had burgers for lunch one day. There's a Whole Foods store a short way up 65th, just beyond the I-5 overpass where we picked up some of the best smoked salmon EVER to enjoy with eggs for breakfast. My husband and I both had some work to do and the dining table was a great place to set up shop. We opened doors and windows (all screened) to the cool breeze and loved occasionally looking up and seeing that view. Nice place to work!  We barely had time to enjoy the TV and the great leather couches but when we did, the instructions for using that equipment were handy and clear and much appreciated. We were so fortunate to find Paul's place on such short notice and his prompt and friendly communication made the process smooth and easy. We enjoyed the perfect, respectful privacy and would have loved to meet our host had time allowed. Not only would we eagerly stay here again when we need to be in Seattle, we just might have to make up some reasons to visit just so we CAN!"
2033191,51990375,2015-10-25,46661263,Laura,"We live about a mile away, and stayed here for several days while we were having some work done at our house.
What a fantastic, cozy, spotless apartment, ideally situated across from Green Lake, Seattle's best park. With the roomy dining and living room and two large bedrooms, the three of us (me, hubby and teenage daughter) had plenty of space to spread out. Paul and Susan left us fresh flowers, chocolates, a couple of interesting beers, coffee and tea.
The kitchen is fully stocked - I can't imagine anything else we could have needed. For families with young kids, the apartment has tons of books, games, toys and crafts, and even a kid-size craft table.
For dining out, an easy 5-10 minute walk is all you need to get to numerous fast food, fine dining, coffee and cocktail spots.
Check-in and check-out were as easy as could be.  
We'll recommend Paul and Susan's place for our own out-of-town guests. And we would definitely stay here again ourselves."
2033191,53066203,2015-11-04,9737162,Lelia,I had a great experience staying at this apartment. The space was beautiful and clean. We were welcomed with fresh flowers and chocolates. Everything you need for a stay was included. Plus the location right across the road from green lake was perfect. There is also a short walk to the grocery store and cute shops and restaurants. The host was easy to communicate with and available if there were any issues or questions. I would stay ther again the next time I am in the area.
2033191,53691223,2015-11-11,6838450,Therese,"This apartment is just plain wonderful. The location right on Green Lake was perfect for me and my 3-year-old daughter. Long walks around the lake, playground, proximity to groceries/restaurants, and easy access to main roads make it a perfect base of operations for a Seattle stay. Paul and Susan were the most considerate hosts... freshly ground coffee, lovely flowers, chocolates, and much-needed help unloading luggage after a long flight. Overall, a very comfortable and terrific place to stay. I hope we get the chance to stay here again. Thanks, Paul and Susan!"
2033191,54789267,2015-11-23,23503051,Kyle,We could not have asked for a better experience!  Paul was extremely helpful not only in regards to the place but also helping us with recommendations on babysitters.  We have a 1 year old and the place was perfect for him as it is child friendly.  Even if it was just us the place would have been great as the location right on the lake within walking distance to restaurants/coffee shops is ideal.  I can't say enough about the experience other than suggesting that if you're looking at this review and it's available to book it right away.  
2033191,57014730,2015-12-21,19384924,Jan,"The place was great!  Spacious, comfortable and private with a great view of the Green Lake.  We just crossed the street and we were walking around the lake, and we were within a few blocks of lots of restaurants and other retail establishments.  Parking was easy (even though we did not have our own car).  A few blocks and we were also at the bus stop to downtown or wherever we needed to go.  We did not do any cooking, but the kitchen was nicely appointed with everything we would need ... for next time!  We hope to return on future visits to our daughter and her boyfriend and stay here!!  "
2033191,57902802,2015-12-30,48727894,Melanie,We really enjoyed our stay.  The apartment is spacious and well appointed.  Everything we could ask for was provided.  We loved the flowers!  It was a great location and we hope to stay there again when visiting family in the area.
6883913,35889790,2015-06-22,17052720,Penny,"Anthony took care of every detail.  We found the apartment easily and it was very tidy, clean and comfortable."
6883913,36071866,2015-06-24,1328975,Michael,"Very easy to get into the place, and excellent communication with Anthony. The pad has fairly amazing views of Lake Union and is very central to the things around Eastlake. The bedroom is located in the back, and the bed is fairly firm. There are little creature comforts in the place, but it has all the basics."
6883913,39788097,2015-07-26,5877417,Hannah,"Anthony was very accomodating and helpful. The apartment was lovely and the area was nice, safe and convenient. Though, if you don't have a car it might be difficult to get groceries or go to the pharmacy, things like that. 

Overall, I had a great stay. But I will say that the apartment wasn't quite ready for a longterm guest. It was missing a lot of the amenities that make a place feel like home – hangers, coffee pot, a fan, a couch, little things like hand soap and garbage bags, etc. However, Anthony was very helpful in ordering some of these things online for me when I requested it. I think he must have just moved in, so I'm sure when he has more time to get settled this place will be perfect. "
6883913,40178826,2015-07-28,39392383,Lola,"We had a great experience in this apartment! Gorgeous views and all the basics you need for a comfortable stay. Anthony had all bases covered, and was very easy to reach. Highly recommend! "
6883913,40411457,2015-07-30,4970236,David,"Excellent place to stay close in to Seattle. Clean, and simple apartment. Great view and location. No frills but easy access and great host."
6883913,41778934,2015-08-09,33335651,Gordon,Anthony was a great host. He replied immediately when I had questions and was always readily available. His home was just as described and it was a delight to stay.
6883913,42200695,2015-08-11,29463845,Iris,"Anthony has been very helpful and attentive when I have questions about the stay. He was also very flexible in scheduling and made sure to give me early notice when things come up. The stay was comfortable in addition to the great views and restaurant around the Eastlake/SLU area. We were able to study and relax in the living room, which was very nice. I would say that Anthony has a great taste in furniture :) "
6883913,42591544,2015-08-14,26029194,Justin,"This being my first airbnb experience, Anthony has made it a great experience. The property was located in a quiet neighborhood next to coffee shops, restaurants, and a mart. With a few direct bus routes to Downtown, the commute was less than 30 mins away. Anthony was very helpful and quick to respond. Even though he wasn't on the property, his communication was fast for any questions. Awesome host!"
6883913,43003761,2015-08-16,13159922,Marie,"Anthony was clear with information and pretty prompt when troubles arose, but he was not around or had noone around to solve a leak issue so we were responsible for communicating with the neighbors to brainstorm a temporary fix for something  which seemed like it should have had a more permanent solution. Also--he does not have free access wireless, he expects you to have comcast or setup a day pass."
6883913,43423590,2015-08-19,40445143,Jill,"Wonderful host! Anthony was a delight to deal with very patient and kind. The apartment was in the cutest neighborhood a short walk from the waterfront of Lake Union. The unit was very clean, quiet, and covered all of our needs.  I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends and family. Great cafe less than a block away too! I'd recommend renting a car to see Seattle if you are there for the first time and want to get a feel for what this beautiful city has to offer."
6883913,44580690,2015-08-27,5658985,Michael,Email contact was prompt with accurate instructions. The location was great for our visit in Eastlake. Amenities were spartan but adequate for our needs. Apartment was as advertised. Parking is sparse in this area.
6883913,44952656,2015-08-30,40068778,Prany,"Anthony's apartment was cozy although a bit barren. The neighborhood felt very safe and parking was pretty easy. It was clean and comfortable. Overall, good experience. "
6883913,45626424,2015-09-04,2502435,Sarah,"Anthony was very responsive with requests as they came up. Very simple place, but perfect for business travel. Thank you"
6883913,45977290,2015-09-07,12773439,Yifei,Anthony is very organized and the place is great! I like the settings and  it's really clean. It has a great well! Good location!
6883913,46766025,2015-09-13,1452739,Hanbing,"Anthony's place was very conveniently located off the Highway and a short drive from everywhere we wanted to go (downtown, U-district, etc). Everything was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The view from the deck was gorgeous as well.

It was very easy and efficient communicating with Anthony, and there was even a french press and coffee left for us! (Truth be told, we never woke up early enough to actually make a pot for ourselves). One note is that it can get fairly hot in this top floor space, but Anthony provided a floor fan which helped immensely.

Would highly recommend this place. It's particularly easy if you've got a rental car."
6883913,47298626,2015-09-17,7728420,Cynthia,"Great location, clean place, and great communication "
6883913,47660749,2015-09-21,38403501,Seth,"The stay was great – everything was super clean & comfortable, if a bit spartan. The view from the balcony was amazing!"
6883913,48632979,2015-09-27,42337837,Gabrielle,"This place was fantastic! Easy access to everything, clean, and very comfortable. Anthony made sure all of our questions were answered and the place was prepared for us. We will be staying there when we visit Seattle in the future. Thanks Anthony!!!"
6883913,49496723,2015-10-04,43712279,James,"Anthony's place was great. It was very neat, clean and comfortable. Really nice location and easy to find. Anthony was very responsive to messages and made the whole process smooth and stress free. Would stay here again 10/10."
6883913,49869539,2015-10-06,844393,Brenda,"I loved the full experience of Anthony's flat. He accepted out last minute booking request and was great at communicating the details. Overall, The unit is pretty spacious and very clean. The balcony had a spectacular view of Seattle which was beyond my expectations. The neighborhood was fantastic and  just 2 miles away but from downtown. Highly recommend a stay here.
"
6883913,50045494,2015-10-08,45680859,Stefanie,"Could not have chosen a more perfect private place, surrounded by all the things Seattle has to offer. It is a clean quite little apartment with a cute deck, on which you can catch a perfect view of the city scape. Anthony was very straightforward with information making the process of arrival/departure a piece of cake. Thank you Anthony and Airbnb for providing such a hospitable weekend getaway! "
6883913,50344716,2015-10-11,22220693,Lola,Loved our stay!! The apartment was exactly as advertised and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Nice area and a beautiful view from the deck. Anthony was very responsive with the question that we had. Would definitely stay here again. 
6883913,51477001,2015-10-20,28884817,Maybelle,Anthony's flat made my stay in Seattle such an amazing experience! It's in a safe and quiet neighborhood with restaurants and markets within a few steps. The flat was SO clean and has all the needed small amenities. The host responds quickly if you ever have a question. Thanks so much Anthony for accommodating us! I've already recommended friends to check this place out if they are ever visiting Seattle! The view from the balcony was my favorite part.
6883913,52446030,2015-10-29,35787523,Drew,"The place was even better than it looks in photos. Very clean, had everything you would need, and Anthony was very communicative and helpful throughout. I will definitely stay here again when I'm in Seattle."
6883913,53395647,2015-11-08,12407594,Dan,Great place...clean and comfortable.  
6883913,53766686,2015-11-12,8200693,Jack,Anthony was a great host. Checking in and out was simple. The view off the balcony was pretty sweet. Street parking was fairly easy. Would stay her again. Thank you for everything 
6883913,53984429,2015-11-15,18020664,Carolyn,"We had a lovely time staying at Anthony's flat in Eastlake during our weekend trip to Seattle. The space was clean, cozy, and centrally located. Anthony was very communicative with us and promptly answered any questions we had. Thanks for the great stay!"
6883913,55109510,2015-11-28,45536248,Tom,"Great place for a couple visiting Seattle. Exquisitely clean, if a bit Spartan. Bring your own internet, but everything else you need will be there. Especially convenient to Lake Union and neighborhood shops and cafes. Anthony is very responsive to any questions."
6883913,55792588,2015-12-06,22381919,Meera,"This is a great apartment - spare in all the best ways. It's calm and cozy with great views, and close access to the Howe St Stairs, for anybody looking for a bit of a workout on the way to Capitol Hill! Everything was as advertised and I enjoyed my stay."
6883913,56404919,2015-12-13,8787089,Jessie,"I had a nice time staying in Anthony's flat. Minimal, clean, warm and cozy, just the way I like it. I love how you can even see downtown and the Space Needle from the deck outside. We had a little bit of trouble with the keys, but other than that it was a great place to come back to after a chilly night out. Parking was easy too. I would definitely love to stay here again if I ever come back to Seattle! "
6883913,56962751,2015-12-20,50378243,Jared,"Nice little place, very clean & comfy bed. Great views of Seattle on the balcony. Keep a close eye out on street parking signs and you're good to go!"
5104918,30330661,2015-04-20,2474952,Tyler,"Excellent experience!  Highly recommended!  I had an amazing and relaxing time staying there 2 weeks for work, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I'm definitely going to miss waking up with the view of the morning sun on the water, watching the rowing teams go by while I drank my morning coffee, and the twinkling lights across the water at night.  It was very quiet and still a quick 15 min walk to my job in U District across the bridge.  

Everything was brand new and exactly as pictured (I was the first guest). Everything I needed was there and more.  If you like brand new everything, this is the place for you.  

The neighborhood is pretty sleepy, nice and quiet and away from the  noise and riff raff, and at the same time it's centrally located and very close to other more vibrant neighborhoods.  Definitely walkable to plenty of places in neighboring hoods.

Dennis was an excellent host, very responsive, and a pleasure to work with.  Can't recommend this listing enough!"
5104918,30956947,2015-04-29,30645683,Cathy,"The apartment was beautiful and comfortable.  It still had the ""new home"" smell and was very clean.  We enjoyed the view off the deck and the location overall was so convenient.  Dennis and his business partner made sure we got into the apartment without any problem and checked in with us several times to ensure we had everything we needed (which we did).  We look forward to staying here again soon! "
5104918,31828345,2015-05-10,31981103,Chris,"My Mother and I stayed here and we had the best time.  The apartment is fantastic.  Everything is brand new, the view is incredible and the location can't be beat.  Plenty of great restaurants and things to in the area to do.  If you have the chance to stay here do not hesitate."
5104918,32394707,2015-05-17,310403,Heather,Great central location.  Knockout view.  Comfortable and stylish; but soundproofing from upstairs neighbors is necessary.
5104918,33025147,2015-05-24,8219655,Rob,"Everything about our stay here was fantastic: the location, the view(!), the well appointed apartment with everything we needed. Dennis is a great host - very responsive and friendly. Fantastic french cafe around the corner for good coffee and croissants. Will stay here again if we get the chance."
5104918,33389229,2015-05-27,4180340,Amy,"The apartment was comfortable and lovely, and the host was very outgoing and helpful (via messages - we actually needed nothing so we never had to take him up on his offers of recommendations or ask for anything).  The view is a winner, and really made the mornings and evenings relaxing."
5104918,33544320,2015-05-29,4681523,Johanne,"Dennis was very friendly, prompt in his communications, and helpful.

The apartment, was very clean, we'll furnished, and had amazing views of the river. If I the opportunity came up again, I would definitely stay in Dennis' apartment again."
5104918,34702198,2015-06-11,5791737,Daniel,"My family and I had a great time staying at Dennis's Portage Bay View apartment.   We were visiting Seattle for our middle son's UW graduation and made a short vacation out of the trip.   The location was very convenient to the university and to the Eastlake and Capitol Hill neighborhoods.   We enjoyed walking the Portage Bay neighborhood, and the views from the apartment were outstanding.

We found the apartment to be as advertised.   Dennis and his business partner own the building and have done a major remodel on the whole building.   As such, everything in the unit is very new and in good condition.    There is relatively little noise when the windows are closed, and we enjoyed the sounds of the boats and drawbridge during the day when we had the windows open.

As a host, Dennis was very responsive to my inquiries during booking and prior to our arrival.   We didn't need to contact him during our stay but did have the chance to meet him and his partner, as they were doing some work on an adjacent unit that they are preparing to put on the AirBnb market.   Both took the opportunity to inquire about how our stay was going, which was appreciated.

I would definitely rent this unit again if staying in the area."
5104918,35208964,2015-06-16,30322125,Debbie,"

Our stay was great. Dennis was easy to work with. Apartment was like new in Eastbrook neighborhood close to the University of Washington and easy bus access.  Loved view of water from deck. Perfect location for our first visit to Seattle."
5104918,35567929,2015-06-20,33248105,Dung,"Awesome host.  If you are looking at the place on google map, it's an old google photo, the facade of the front of unit does not do the place justice. This is my first time using AIRBNB and the photos provided were exactly what the place looks like, absolutely beautiful.  Our family was  amazed at the place.  Everything is in like new condition.  I did not realize that his window/porch view was actually looking towards  U. of Washington's  campus.  This place is fully equipped washer/dryer, pots/pans/utensils/ glass ware/dining plates.  Don't know if the laundry detergent/ dryer fabric softener sheets/ bleach/ shower shampoo/ shower conditioner/body wash were left behind by guests or if provided by host, so we didn't have to make a trip to Safeway.  There are internet access and cable provided.  Host has provided not just a place for guest to stay, but really a home away from home, with all the amenities you would need-even a house vacuum.  Some habits are hard to break,  I see a vacuum- I just have to clean-LOL. UW is  within walking distance over University Bridge to campus and worth the walk the first time you explore the area.  There is also a French Pastry shop(Le Fournil-3230 East Lake Ave E) 3 min. walk/ .1 mile around the corner of host's place,  definitely worth getting up for.  It opens at 7 AM-fresh pastries and coffee, so you can enjoy it on the porch and watch row team.    For lunch or dinner , there is Agua Verde-1303 NE Boat St on UW campus-a Mexican eatery with patio  and view of Portage Bay looking towards host's home. It's about a .8 mile(17 min walk / 4 min. drive) . You will want to walk off your meal afterwards and see UW's gorgeous campus.  The place is so centralized that getting to downtown or out of town is super easy even with traffic.  If possible, I will be making plans on staying here again and  watching HUSKY football, next fall.
"
5104918,38439712,2015-07-15,16440126,Zé,"The apartment has a great view and the apartment was impeccable.  Just as described.   No issues at all with coordinating access to the apartment.  Noise from upstairs neighbors is an issue, not because they're noisy, but because there is no sound insulation and you can hear them walking upstairs.  No issue going to sleep with ear plugs though.  Also, the hot water in shower didn't work well, so I took mostly a cold shower.  I forgot about all of that when looking at the beautiful view in the morning, watching the boats and the sculls go by."
5104918,39043273,2015-07-20,3226353,Tony,"Great location with a great view of the bay! Dennis had the place spotless when we arrived, and we felt right at home. The only downside was an issue with the shower temperature, but Dennis was nice enough to come by and do his best to fix the issue. All in all, highly recommended. Thanks Dennis!"
5104918,40127101,2015-07-28,19955315,Brian,"The apartment was wonderful and the view exactly as pictured!! I stayed here with my family and we truly enjoyed our time. The patio is wonderful to have a cup of coffee at and watch all the water traffic. Inside the apartment is very nice and clean, with a large bathroom and kitchen area was big enough as well. The added BBQ was a great touch as well! Location is superb, right next to major bus lines and just a short walk to a nice bakery (Fornil?) around the corner. Also, Dennis was a very responsive host and made things extremely easy and simple for us. We had a small issue where hot water wasn't consistently coming out of the shower, but if you let it run for a bit out of the bathtub spigot and switch back it will get hot again. Dennis was looking into the issue after we left, think his new solution will work :) Would definitely recommend this place to a friend and/or return myself! "
5104918,41070917,2015-08-04,32077720,Kelly,"The apartment was exactly as pictured – modern and remodeled. (My only suggestion might be to share the size of the apartment – maybe add square feet?)  I stayed here with my family of five. It is a very nice and clean apartment with an incredible view.  The patio was a great place to wake up, drink coffee and watch boats go by.  It has a large, fully equipped kitchen (although coffee cups only for four) which we took advantage of instead of eating out every meal.  We found staples of sugar, salt & pepper – so it saved us a trip to the store.  We had issues with the hot water in the shower.  Initially, we didn’t have any hot water then hot water would not stay on and had to be turned off and on to complete a shower.  Dennis was quick to come to change out the shower head which allowed hot water.  The location is very nice and close to a major street that goes right down town.  Having the dedicated parking space is definitely a plus – parking can be a premium in Seattle.  We utilized the washer & dryer and that worked perfectly.  It was unusually hot in late-July/early-August when we visited Seattle.  The apartment does not have central air, but does have a portable air cooler/fan.  My only suggestion is that maybe an additional one for the master bedroom might be helpful as there was very little air flow in the back of the apartment.  There is internet and we had no issues with any of that.  Dennis was a great host.  Gaining access and leaving the keys was a seamless.  I would definitely recommend this location."
5104918,42293749,2015-08-12,35088617,Yuki,"Dennis is so welcome and warm, his house is tidy and clean. The location is good. It's convenient to get to every place and you won't feel noisy outside. I really recommend his house. Awesome experience:)"
5104918,44125181,2015-08-24,36310193,Mario,The apartment was clean and nice. Dennis was very responsive to a few issues that arose. The location is perfect. Close to everything and most importantly close to the freeway. The view of Portage Bay and the houseboat community is wonderful. We enjoyed the apartment and would recommend it and Dennis to anyone looking to stay in the area. 
5104918,45263865,2015-09-01,13396153,Rob,The apartment was very nice and Dennis was very quick to solve any problems that we had.  
5104918,46274903,2015-09-09,36570187,Beth,"Dennis made us feel very welcomed and quickly responded to questions.  The home is even better than described, the view is amazing and the neighborhood is quiet yet walking distance to restaurants and easy access to many Seattle landmarks.  We highly recommend this property and will stay again on our next trip to Seattle.  "
5104918,46882305,2015-09-14,5295756,Liz,The apartment was just as listed. It was clean and easy to find everything. We enjoyed the view from the deck and found the space comfortable to be in for the weekend (there were 4 of us). We didn't see Dennis but he left instructions on how everything works. Not much information on the local area and bus lines are a little confusing but nothing we couldn't figure out by going online.  I would recommend.
5104918,48327403,2015-09-25,43940813,Rakesh,"This was our first stay using Airbnb and we were really glad that we did it. It's a very cosy apartment with excellent view    and ideally located. It is a short 10min walk to the UW campus and one of the  best place to stay for anyone visiting the university. Unfortunately my wife fell sick but at least the UW Medical Centre is just 20min walk.

The size is ideal for a family of 3 or 4. It has a fully equipped kitchen and we had fun cooking some Indian food. With lots of eating places within a mile it was pretty easy to get free delivery of food.

Dennis is a great host and always looking to make sure that we had a comfortable stay. There is a minor issue with the power supply which Dennis is getting rectified. We would surely want to come and stay again. 

Thanks Dennis."
5104918,51334369,2015-10-19,6639633,Paul,"This has wonderful views as depicted. It is what you see looking out from the family room and kitchen. It creates a fantastic sense of openness that makes you just want to linger. The towels were very high quality, more like an upscale hotel. The queen size bed in the master room provided a great night's sleep. All of the furniture and construction finishes seem to be recent. There is a very small market and a wonderful breakfast cafe a short walking distance away. This property can make for a very romantic stay.

The only ongoing issue was that the sound insulation is very poor in the ceiling. The foot steps from the unit above are quite clear."
5104918,52268032,2015-10-27,7599580,Jerry,"Delightful property, either as good as described or better, can't decide which. It felt like being in a brand new upscale apartment but with complete privacy and a great view of Portage Bay. The finishes are warm and enticing even the bathroom, which is very large, was wonderful with the washer dryer and laundry soap was provided. One thing that always irritates me is when I arrive at a vacation rental I have to buy absolutely everything, salt, pepper, catsup, mustard, paper products, coffee....the basics. You know the previous guest left some things behind but it all get tossed and we have to start over.... but at Dennis' place, it was all there, the laundry soap, several kinds of coffee, sugar, condiments you name it, the basics were there.....Thank you Dennis"
5104918,53488414,2015-11-09,12335436,Jennifer,This was a great location in Seattle. Perfect for a weekend gateway. Not right in the middle of the city and has a great view of the bay.  Apartment was perfect for us. Good access to the university and Burke-Gilman trail. Dennis provided great information  and he was quick to respond to questions.  
5104918,54396168,2015-11-19,9058472,Matthew,"Perfect place for a short stay in Seattle. Stunning views. Comfortable, clean and the host very helpful. "
5104918,55124079,2015-11-28,47500309,Julie,"I think the host tries with this unit;  view is great and the bed was comfortable.  However, there are some real issues with this place: electrical (no running basic appliances together), hot water is inconsistent, people in until above are up all night and walking on the floor above, no dish soap, and everything was not clean (carpet of man hairs in the shower - blender had green stuff growing in it).  "
3422894,15994151,2014-07-19,2129404,Romeo,"Amy is a very accommodating host. She has a great energy and makes sure you have a comfortable stay in one of the most beautiful US cities. The apartment is just steps to the main strip in the University District and the university itself. One of the biggest draws of the studio is an outdoor patio area overlooking the city where you can lounge, read, do yoga, grill out or have a glass of wine. Thanks, Amy for the stay and being so welcoming!"
3422894,16179976,2014-07-22,8104145,Christelle,"Amy is an amazing host, the communication with her is smooth and easy. The studio is awesome: top floor with a huge south-facing rooftop! It is clean and has everything you need. It looks exactly as on the pictures. Thank you!"
3422894,16185488,2014-07-22,832287,John And Kathleen,Amy's Studio was perfect for our needs.  We were looking for a place to crash for one night in the North East Seattle area.  Amy was able to accommodate us on short notice.  Amy was very responsive and helpful during the reservation and checkin process.  The pictures and description of the studio on the website is accurate.   As described on the website it is on the 4th floor of an apartment building with no elevator so keep that in mind.    
3422894,16376817,2014-07-26,18177525,Howard,"What a fun place!  I especially liked all the light and air and quiet (rooftop apt with windows on three sides), the eclectic world-traveler decorations, the nicely stocked kitchen and bathroom (bean coffee and new toothbrushes) and the wine and cheese welcome.   The apt includes a private parking space off the street, which is a big plus.  Amy is a great host - made sure I was comfortable on arrival and gave some great tips on neighborhood.   It's a very engaging neighborhood - all walkable within a few blocks - lively international student life, and boucoup de coffee shops and ethnic restaurants - too many to sample on one trip.    I'll be back."
3422894,16447210,2014-07-27,16389582,Sarah,The reservation was canceled 34 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3422894,16634206,2014-07-30,5677829,Denny,"My wife and I had a wedding to attend at the Botanic Gardens of the University Of Washington. And along with this being her first trip to Seattle, we were looking for accommodations that would offer the 'entire place' and us the chance at getting around at a minimal expense.  Amy's Sunny Rooftop U District Studio perfectly fit our needs. Her place is beautiful; with live plants, bird feeders, and a sustainability feel that inspires you. It comes furnished with a large refrigerator, a hot plate and essentials for cooking. The neighborhood couldn't have been more excellent with grocery stores, restaurants, and bars a short walk away. Being near campus the area is lively and well lit at night. And thanks to Seattle's amazingly efficient public transpiration system, getting around was worry free. There are bus stops in every direction leaving Amy's, able to truck you to Downtown or Mathews Beach within 20 minutes. Of course, our wonderful experience could not have been made possible if not for our very pleasant host Amy. Prior to and upon arrival she was in consistent communication with us. Updating us on early checkin availability, and helping us begin our public transit journey with directions on how to get from the airport to her place. We met Amy just after brunch and during our walk from the bus stop she filled us in on the things to know about our new neighborhood. The introduction to our digs for the next 5 days began with Amy encouraging us to make ourselves at home, enjoy the food and beverages inside the fridge, and if anything at all was needed not to hesitate in contacting her. After handing us the keys and saying ""cheers"" we did not see Amy again, though her words rang loud as we did enjoy everything her place had to offer, and contacted her several times with inquiries. And each time Amy was immediate in her responses. 

By not staying at Amy's Sunny Rooftop U District Studio for your next get away to Seattle you will be missing out on an opportunity to be inspired, feel at home, and truly enjoy Seattle as a local. 

The sincerest of appreciation and warmest of thanks, Amy :)

Cheers,
-Alissa and Denny"
3422894,16797230,2014-08-02,14342397,Mary Beth & Nick,"Amy is super nice - met me after 11 pm to let me in. Apartment is exactly as pictured, and although the ""bed"" is really a futon on the floor it was extremely comfortable! The wine in the fridge was also a nice touch :)"
3422894,17011647,2014-08-05,18285139,Nicholas,"It was a pleasure to stay at at Amy's rooftop apartment near the university. Amy was very accommodating with my check-in time and communicating with her was easy. The place is as advertised, cozy and well situated for getting around  Seattle. I would most certainly stay here again. "

3422894,17234257,2014-08-09,4860114,Kyle,"Amy was very easy to work with, she was in touch before the trip and everything was great. The apartment was awesome, and in a great location for going out and walking campus bars and food spots. The place was very clean and had good wireless internet. Anyone looking to stay near campus in Seattle should consider staying here."
3422894,17319086,2014-08-10,19139905,Jill,"Charming, light-filled studio apartment in U district.  Amy met us promptly and was a lovely host. It's worth noting that the neighborhood becomes very noisy on a Friday night. "
3422894,17468367,2014-08-12,48554,Young Min,"such a cute place, loved staying at Amy's place."
3422894,17790628,2014-08-17,19454215,Kun,I had a really good experience in Amy's studio. It is just what the photos look like. Necessities for living are provided. 
3422894,18075383,2014-08-21,10712616,Vadim,"Great apartment in a fun neighborhood near UWashington campus. The apartment is sunny and relaxing, and has a great balcony area. Overall we couldn't think of a better experience staying in Seattle. Amy is very accommodating and kind, even when I didn't make it to check-in on time. She was very helpful in making sure our needs were met. Thanks!"
3422894,18187689,2014-08-23,6246162,Beth,Amy was easy to coordinate our stay with.  The space is conveniently located near restaurants and coffee shops in U District.

will definitely visit again."

3422894,18672357,2014-08-30,19364672,Jason,I had a fantastic experience staying at Amy's place. It's adorably charming with fresh tomatoes on the vine and perfectly riped pears for her guests. She was flexibile and accommodating with us for pickup and departure. The place looks exactly like the pictures. Thanks Amy! 
4024844,26967321,2015-02-22,28019652,Amelie,"What a great find! Jill and Loren are the sweetest hosts. Their location is excellent and their apartment is large and VERY clean. They gave us great neighborhood recommendations for food and activities. We walked to the University Farmers Market, which was awesome! We are already planning to stay with them again in the fall when we come up for a football game.  Highly recommend!!"
4024844,27192675,2015-02-27,3872371,Michael,"Lorin and Jill were great hosts - courteous, friendly, and communicative.  
The unit itself is very clean & spacious, has a very comfortable bed, and the bathroom and kitchen felt brand new.  
I really liked the location too, very close to the freeway.  I wish that I hadn't rented a car because I found out that I could have easily taken the bus downtown, or to most other parts of the city.  There's also plenty of fun stuff within walking distance.
The neighborhood itself has everything you would want - lots of restaurants & bars, good shopping, etc.  I enjoyed being in a neighborhood with (what felt like) the locals. 
Overall a great deal for the price, and I would definitely stay with them again on my next trip.  Which I hope is soon!"
4024844,27422141,2015-03-03,28624875,Fernanda,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and I'm SOLD! This place was really a good find! Centrally located and very easy to get around with public transportation/walking. The street is quiet and parking was very easy to find (which is not a given in Seattle). The place was HUGE, nothing shy of a 5 star hotel (minus room service)! Shower pressure was wonderful, bed and sheets were comfortable and clean, kitchen was super functional and everything works great! Hosts were nice and very good at respecting our privacy. Would totally recommend this place."
4024844,27779744,2015-03-11,28642470,Cassidy,"Staying at Jillian and Lorins airbnb was a wonderful experience. Before even arriving we felt totally comfortable and prepared with detailed instructions on entering the unit. After arriving from a long cross country flight we were welcomed with fresh fruits and refreshments. The apartment was clean and comfortable, spacious, and well furnished. We would recommend staying here to everyone. The location is in a quiet and convenient neighborhood with two busses downtown only one block away. Jillian and Lorin were accommodating, polite, and wonderful to meet- we were very happy we chose to stay in this unit. "
4024844,28430979,2015-03-23,29048486,Grace,"Jillian and Lorin were very helpful answering all my questions before I booked the reservation. Their place is very clean, nice, cozy, and comfortable. My friends and I stayed for a weekend and we had a very good experience. Parking is also very convenient. I would recommend their place to anyone."
4024844,28571425,2015-03-26,28277267,Tim,"Jill and Lorin have created a comfortable, sleek and modern apartment for guests. It would work especially well for longer stays. It's a basement unit, but it gets some natural light and has been decorated to include elements from the natural world. The kitchen is fabulous!

We treceived detailed instructions in advance, taking a little of the stress away from the unknowns in airbnb stays. We met Jill and Lorin just as we arrived, which was great, plus they left us a nice welcome note and a bowl of fruit.

The space is just as described and parking and bus lines were convenient, plus I was able to walk a couple of block to Whole Foods to pickup a few missing items for dinner. The neighborhood is active, but the block is quiet with the home mid-block with lots of single family houses.

We also had plenty of timely communication. I'd be happy to stay here again."
4024844,28689472,2015-03-28,14817515,Erin,"Jillian and Lorin's place was great, including personal touches like a note and treats for my husband and five year old. Clean and very well-furnished. Looked exactly like the pictures. Communication was great, very responsive. A pleasure to deal with!"
4024844,28958699,2015-04-01,18600194,Caroline,"I really enjoyed my stay with Jillian and Lorin, they made me feel welcome from the very beginning of my time there.  The neighborhood is great, lots of things to see and do, plenty of parking nearby (as long as you're not trying to park when the high school is in session) but I never found it a problem as I was gone throughout the day.  The apartment itself is beautiful and very comfortable.  There were books, games and movies for me to use if I wanted to.  They had thought of everything that I could need, and were really receptive about having feedback to make sure there was nothing else that I needed during my stay.  They were also very communicative and I felt I was well prepared for my stay even before I got there.   I would HIGHLY recommend Jillian and Lorin's place, and if I ever need to go back to Seattle they will definitely be my first choice!   "
4024844,29349391,2015-04-06,543046,Nadine,"J&L's basement apartment is exactly as pictured - light, newly renovated, and comfortable.  The appliances and fixtures seem barely used. Towels, dishes, cookware are all fresh and new and (bonus!) there's no characteristic Seattle ""old basement"" odor. Parking is convenient and easy during weekends & non-school hours. Olive oil, salt/pepper are provided. So if you're planning to cook, you may want to bring spices/condiments.  It's a compact but completely outfitted kitchen.  Jillian and Loren left fruit and an Easter chocolate treat for us - and there was abundant tea and instant coffee. Lots of info was left for us and if we'd had any questions or needed anything, Loren and Jillian were really happy to help out.  Riley met us as we checked in and then he seemed to ""know"" that it was us coming and going.  No barking.  Happy dog!  

All in all, this was a really comfortable and convenient place to be. Nice location, kind hosts. Highly recommended!"
4024844,29880677,2015-04-13,2091484,Sumi,"We had a perfect stay with Lorin and Jillian! The apartment was wonderfully cozy, clean and well situated. We had a chance to meet Lorin when we arrived and he was so kind and welcoming - even giving us fruit from their local market! We had a car with us so the available parking out front was incredibly convenient. Would not hesitate to stay here again! Highly recommend! "
4024844,30135919,2015-04-18,23400294,Christina,Jill and Lorin were extremely nice and so was their dog. They even let us check in 2 hours  early! Lorin went out of his way to introduce himself on our first day and offered any help he could provide to make our stay enjoyable. They left us a nice hand written note and a bowl of delicious fruit to welcome us along with some sparkling water to drink. The kitchen had basic essentials which was great. They also provided a nice manual that answered all the questions we had regarding the rental. It was extremely comfortable and in a great location.
4024844,30650491,2015-04-25,31484127,Peter,"It's a pleasant, spacious, daylight-basement apartment, and I recommend it. Everything is thoughtfully laid out and considered. I was running around town, preparing to leave the country, so had opportunity to meet only Jillian, who was welcoming and considerate. And their place is in a quiet neighborhood that is very close to stores and cafes."
4024844,32346323,2015-05-17,7274055,Shing,"Jillian & Lorin were wonderful hosts.  The apartment was very comfortable and perfect for us.  It was well lit and had everything that we needed.  Easy access to the market or the freeway.  Lots of restaurants, etc. close by."
4024844,33110326,2015-05-25,30998866,Bryan,"Our stay was great!  Easy free parking across the street, plenty of space in the apartment for us.  We almost had to use the laundry (but worked around it), so it was nice to have that option.  The place was tidy and cozy, and we would stay there again if the need comes up.  Great convenient location for our daily adventures around the city in every direction."
4024844,36957689,2015-07-03,17944575,Derek,"Nice and spacious basement unit, which turned out to be cool and comfortable during the recent Seattle heat wave. Clean and inviting. Messages and questions were answered promptly and courteously. Interesting bars and large park nearby. Recommended. "
4024844,37788512,2015-07-10,1682593,Theo,"Great little spot, convenient and close to transit and food."
4024844,37864092,2015-07-11,33686287,Daniel,"It was dark as we arrived and Lorin saw, from the front window of the house, that we were looking for their place. He turned on the lights and came out to front door to welcome us. He helped us get inside and offered several times to help with our things. He was very nice and gracious. The bed was comfortable and was able to get a good few hours of sleep. It was clean and kept up nice. Cute little place. Only one small complaint would be the squeaky floor as we could hear him and his dog walking around up stairs. "
4024844,38114676,2015-07-13,31876371,Rob,"This was a great basement apartment: very clean, spacious, quiet. Parking was easy, though it's right next to a school so I imagine it might have been tougher during the school year. The location was a quick drive to downtown Seattle. The hosts were helpful and seemed very friendly. Overall, I had a great time!"
4024844,38446586,2015-07-15,35871907,Harpreet,"Jillian/Lorin were great hosts and super duper welcoming! EXTREMELY ACCOMMODATING. Had a superb stay. The space was as listed, if not better. Super clean, and super easy to ""make home."" The kitchen was very nicely equipped, as was the space in general. :)  The bathroom was nicely done as well -- towels galore. Just a really good place to kick back and enjoy yourself. Would stay again, no questions asked. :)
"
4024844,38597345,2015-07-17,26973351,Jon,Owners were kind and quiet and the place was just as clean and cute as advertised. One thing we really appreciated was that they let us store our baggage for hours after checkout so that we didn't have to lug it around Seattle while we waited to check in at another place.
4024844,38999186,2015-07-20,19844506,Merri Sue,"We had a great time here and Jillian and Lorin were very good at descriptions and helpfulness.  The place was just right--nice neighborhood, good running track right across the street, quiet. The space was perfect for us--we'd definitely stay again!"
4024844,39304307,2015-07-22,36331879,Kari,"This is a nice, quiet place to stay for a family or couple.  The neighborhood was quiet, parking was easy at the time we arrived (late afternoon, summer), and there is a nice shopping center with a grocery store (Whole Foods) in easy walking distance.  The space was clean and tidy and comfortable, and it offered more privacy and room than a more-expensive hotel room in the same area.  Extras like Starbucks Via coffee and tea were a nice treat.  The owners were gracious when communicating (through email & text).  As with most rentals within a home, guests cannot control the thermostat, but we found the temperature comfortable. Perhaps the only reason I would not give it five stars is that it is a basement, and the tight space in the landing behind the door might be a tiny bit difficult for some people to negotiate with luggage or small children."
4024844,40714057,2015-08-02,12228834,Shinrou,"The apartment was clean, comfortable and well-equipped throughout as pictured and described. Jillain was very communicative and helpful throughout the booking process. Thank you for a great stay in the wonderful neighborhood!"
4024844,41160945,2015-08-04,8871521,Serina,"Lorin greeted us as my boyfriend and I walked up the house and was really friendly and welcoming. He showed us how to lock and unlock the door, and let us into the apartment. The space was clean, new, and exactly as shown in the photos. Because it's a basement space, it was nice and cool, too. A wonderful weekend spent here, thank you for being excellent hosts and sharing your house with us!"
4024844,41464956,2015-08-07,38700933,Patti,"We met Jillian and her family on our first day arrival, it was our first Airbnb experience which was Great! My son love to sleep on their sofa, and we love the location near by Whole Food Market, every night  we had some wines and late snack to enjoy:)"
4024844,41465344,2015-08-07,38769326,Vjera,"Jilian and Lorin's place is a very nice spacious appartment. Its in a quiet neighbourhood. Upon your arrival they give you very detailed instructions so we didnt have problem finding it and getting in.Everything was perfectly clean. Parking is just outside their house and we felt comfortable leaving our car there. Even if it was short, we had a great stay at their place."
4024844,41651536,2015-08-08,27782844,Rachelle,"We loved this spacious apartment! Jillian and Lorin obviously put a lot of thought into it with all the books, movies, and games provided. We only stayed one night but their apartment would be perfectly comfortable for a long visit. My husband and I ended up getting into town earlier than planned and when I asked Jillian and Lorin if we could keep our bags there until checkin, they actually had the apartment ready for us several hours early, which is way more than I would have expected! I'm glad we could support a nice young couple with a baby rather than a hotel chain :)"
4024844,42527314,2015-08-14,34624557,Diana,"The apartment was perfect for my friends and I. It was just the right size and we loved how Lorin and Jillian provided things in the apartment that we didn't realize we'd need until we needed it. They were very understanding of our situation and accommodated us when they didn't even have to so we truly appreciated that. The apartment is bright and beautiful. With just a quick 15-20 minute drive to downtown Seattle, we highly recommend you staying here if you were to visit Seattle. "
4024844,44407328,2015-08-26,31023017,芳,"We've been living in Jill and Lorin's house for 12 days and our feeling was everything was just amazing. We are satisfied with the house as well as their thoughtful service. The day we arrived they helped us with our heavy luggages. We talked with them and their cute baby and their dog. They also didn't forget to inform us about the great events that would happen in the city during our stay. The house was clean and neat, in which the facilities were complete, and cooking kit were also really new and easy to use. The environment around the house was awesome, we enjoyed having walks between the neighborhoods. Bus stops were everywhere, so you could just go to downtown in 30 mins. We would like to live in their house again if we are going to Seattle next time. Strongly recommended."
4024844,44584266,2015-08-27,23323333,Alexandre,"Great place, super clean and very private. We would certainly recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle."

The apartment was very clean, it is very well equipped, the location was perfect for us, the street is very quiet and we were within walking distance of two food stores. Jillian & Lorin are a very sweet couple and we would not hesitate to stay with them during our next visit to Seattle.  "
4024844,47365149,2015-09-18,18312176,Jason,Jilliand and Lorin were very kind and helpful with our arrival and stay. The apartment is big and very nice. The location is not too far from downtown and very close to UW. Parking was easy to find. Recommended.
4024844,47637831,2015-09-21,35002890,Nina,"Great apartment! I loved how clearly Jillian communicated things ahead of our trip. When we booked she said she would provide information a week before our trip. Then exactly 1 week before our trip, we received a document full of everything we would need to know for our arrival and stay. Fantastic!

The listing was as described and true to the pictures. Everything was fresh & clean and the kitchen was sufficient for our light cooking needs. The bed was really comfortable. My friend and I switched off on who slept on the couch. One of us (a 200 pound man) didn't sleep well on the ""too firm"" couch, the other (a 120 pound woman) thought it was great! Neighbourhood was very quiet, centrally located, with easy parking. We were in Seattle for Tough Mudder so definitely appreciated being able to wash our (very thoroughly rinsed out first) clothes!

Definitely recommend this place!"
4024844,48639903,2015-09-27,44784821,Steve,"We highly recommend Jillian and Lorin's Newly Renovated Apartment. The communication before our arrival was warm, clear, and easy to understand.  The apartment is on an established, tree lined, one way street.  We realized it was quieter than our own home. 
The apartment is beautifully renovated with charming touches such as several framed notes around the apartment and information on the refrigerator from our hosts. 
We left the rental car at the house.  A main bus line is half a block away with restaurants and stores within a comfortable walking distance.
Next time we visit Seattle we hope to stay in Jillian and Lorin's Newly Renovated apartment."
4024844,49082995,2015-09-30,2451780,Jervis,"The listing description was accurate to the nail. Apartment was newly renovated, and felt like brand new. The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. We felt very safe here. The bed was comfortable and our sleep was restful. Lorin and Jillian provided amenities that made our stay better than a five star hotel. Some of these amenities included a whole suite of DVDs, various shower products and clean white towels, as well as a complete set of cutlery and plates. The apartment was beautifully decorated and felt cosy. "
4024844,49784373,2015-10-06,25948997,Suri,"Jillian and Lauren were lovely people, and the apartment is more than pleasant. The bed is very comfortable. We had privacy and quiet. Our only discomfort was the entrance to the house was awkward, not easy for people with balance issues to navigate. "
4024844,50382229,2015-10-11,5647908,Sharla,"The newly renovated apartment was perfect for my weekend trip to Seattle!  It was very clean, spacious, and the hosts provided all the needed amenities for a pleasant stay.  Although I didn't meet Jillian, our communication via text and email was very helpful and friendly.  I would definitely reach out to them upon my next visit to Seattle."

4024844,53445387,2015-11-08,48365275,Julian,"Jillian and Lorin were so welcoming and hospitable. It was our first Airbnb experience and they have set the bar very high! Jillian, Lorin, their child and dog all welcomed us as we arrived and helped us settle in. We love the neighborhood: quiet yet near the university, cafes, shopping and sight seeing. Their apartment is better than advertised--clean, modern, comfortable, with all the amenities needed for a stress-free stay. The attention to detail is impressive: they have thought of everything,  a traveler could need, from well equipped kitchen and bathroom to the beautiful linens and comfortable bed. We were so impressed and look forward to another visit to Seattle and lodging with the Seeks. "
4024844,54815652,2015-11-23,17820,Chelan,"Jillian and Lorin were perfect hosts and their digs are the best I have seen in all my AirBnB travels. They were just as friendly and responsive in person as they were through the AirBnB site. They provided clear instructions to and throughout their home, plus helped us find a place to eat in the area.  We traveled with a very mobile 11-month-old and I had no problem letting her roam all rooms of their apartment because of how clean the place was (bathroom was pristine, even the baseboards in all rooms were clear of dust). When I mentioned our Little Traveler before we came, they cleared the bottom shelf of their book rack and stocked it with age appropriate toys--such a wonderful extra step for them to have taken! Like I said above, we have toured NYC, DC and CA via AirBnB plus been hosts ourselves and I can confidently say they created the best experience I have seen--including our own place! Wish I could keep them a secret, but they are what make AirBnB great. Stay with them if you can! "

Their apartment was very clean, spacious and had everything that we needed! They added small touches such as keeping ear plugs in the top drawer in the bedroom, which we loved. The listing is exact and true to the pictures shown.
We definitely highly recommend a stay in their place if you are visiting Seattle! "

My brother and I felt right at home. Karin had fruit and breakfast food for us during our stay and even packed us a lunch for the hike! She's sweet, attentive, and it was a pleasure to stay with her and her two friendly cats.  Location was central to everything in Downtown Seattle. Space was clean and pull-out couch was comfy. Thanks again Karin!"

She was hospitable and provided me with the essentials when traveling. The apt was spacious, clean, and in a great location as well.  The apt was described well, and overall good experience on top of that.  "

The apartment was spacious, bright, clean, and well-located. Even with a pull-out couch, it was a comfortable place to stay. Also, her cats are adorable and very sweet!"
6993978,41437327,2015-08-07,34809999,Peng,"I had a great time stay with Karin. Karín is a wonderful hostess. She made my first visit to both Seattle and United States a very delightful experience. Her apartment was spacious, clean, bright and well-located. Everyday I walk down to the beach in the morning. The beach has a great view, and the restaurant near the beach is fabulous. She is totally ok that I came back late after I saw the nightfall on the Space Needle. The pull-out couch is very comfortable. And her cats are really adorable!"
6993978,42577546,2015-08-14,6258516,Derek,"Karin is a most accommodating and pleasant host, who makes the effort to make sure your stay is perfect. You couldn't ask for a more helpful host. As I was in Seattle for a conference, I didn't have much time for sight-seeing or any socializing, and she maintained a perfect level of interaction - making sure I had everything every evening, without being overbearing.

I just wished I could have spent more time in Seattle and taken advantage of the hospitality that she offers in terms of taking people around (see the other reviews).

For people in the convention center, this place couldn't be more convenient. After a whole day's activity, the sofa bed is as comfortable as anything. Just make sure you don't become enamored with her adorable cats."

It was in a great location between downtown and Capitol Hill, we enjoyed exploring the bars and quirky shops in Capitol Hill and found it was very easy to get anywhere else we needed to go using nearby buses. The room itself was a shared space in Karin's living room but she gave us plenty of privacy and we were very comfortable! We also loved sharing the space with her 2 adorable cats who are very friendly and sweet. Thanks for your hospitality Karin! "

The space was just as listed and was clean, was just what I needed for a weekend get away. Karin even offered clean towels and slippers, and even tips for what to check out in Seattle. Her two cats were super adorable and affectionate! "

The bed is a comfy pull out, clean sheets and towel provided. I was away most of the time for work and had little time to spend in the apartment. Location is great, 10min walk uphill from downtown hotels. Karin's cats are adorable and did not bother me at all. Karin was just lovely to talk to, and she really cares about her house guests. Would recommend wholeheartedly!"
6993978,48813635,2015-09-28,19962441,Paul,The host was very nice. I loved her cats and the location was amazing. Everything was walking distance away. The living room area worked out nice for me for just needing somewhere to sleep.

Thank you for the lovely stay"

Lynn also left us a bottle of wine and (email hidden)ed I say more? 

Loved the experience on every front. "

The proximity to Fremont and the neighborhood was excellent.  I was able to walk everywhere including the PCC market and lots of great restaurants.  

I was traveling for work and it was great to have a place that felt like a home.  I would stay here again!  "

Just as a heads up. Cozy place, very clean, and overall good stay! "

3531616,15729357,2014-07-14,17793377,Suresh,This was our first experience with rental lodging and we loved it. The place itself was very beautiful  and their garden is heavenly. Our experience was way more than what we had expected. We were very well received by Esperanza & Leo and they were very hospitable and made us feel at home. We were served great breakfast on both days we stayed and also had a good chat with them. I would definitely recommend their place for a single person or a couple. We would definitely go back to their place if we visit Seattle again.
3531616,15854078,2014-07-16,10721706,Brian,"We saw more of Leo, due to work schedules, but we were made to feel at home. The family was very polite, the bed was very comfortable, we had a private room and bath, and there was a nice breakfast waiting for us each morning. (Fantastic banana bread!) Very pleasant and pretty home. "
3531616,16224690,2014-07-23,3946124,Sylvia,"Esperanza and Leo were amazing and accomodating hosts.  Esperanza baked delicious bread and cakes for breakfast together with a bowl of fresh fruit. The room and bathroom were spacious and clean, and cooling even in summer. 
The location would be more convenient if you had a car, but we managed fine with public transport. The house is located near 2 bus stops that take about 30 minutes to get to downtown Seattle, although buses seem to be more infrequent over the summer weekends.
Overall we had a lovely experience with Esperanza and Leo. They were very friendly and helpful and made us feel very welcome in their home!"
3531616,16325672,2014-07-25,18266129,Susanne,"It was my first time using AirBNB, though I've stayed at traditional BNB's. The room and bathroom were located downstairs and were quite private. Esperanza and Leo were kind, thoughtful and accommodating hosts.  Thank you! "
3531616,16636339,2014-07-30,928930,Jocelyn,"As our first Airbnb experience, my mom and I can only say wonderful things about our stay. Esperanza and Leo were courteous, kind, friendly, and patient hosts. We arrived way past our accorded check-in time and they were kind enough to wait for us. Esperanza left us a lovely breakfast each morning, while Leo was available in case we had questions, concerns, or wanted to chat. The home was gorgeous and impeccable, while the downstairs was clean, cute, comfortable, and spacious. The neighborhood was accessible, safe, and quiet. The stay definitely exceeded our expectations with only a 10/12 minute drive to downtown, incredible deck, and great hosts. I recommend Leo and Esperanza’s place to anyone staying in Seattle! Hopefully, we'll be back in the future. "

3531616,18074289,2014-08-21,14359257,Noelia,"This was our 1st experience with airbnb and it was a great one! 
Esperanza and Leo are both extremely nice hosts and made us feel welcome and at home. 
They have a beautiful home, and the neighborhood is quiet and minutes away from Downtown Seattle.  We mainly used Uber and Lyft to go places versus the public transport but the bus stop was very near to the house.  Esperanza was very kind to give us a ride to downtown one day since she was heading to the area.   Our room/area was cozy, and had everything we needed-fresh towels, clean bathroom, hot water, and there is a small family room in the downstairs area for you to enjoy with a TV. I recommend opening the windows at night, the first night we didn't since we got in a little late but then I realized that the windows could be opened- and it made a world of a difference (just make sure you close them before you leave!).  Breakfast was ready for us every day and she made sure we had everything we needed.  We loved Seattle and will be back :)"

Breakfast was healthy and yummy.  Perfect for us. This was exactly what we were hoping for and a wonderful experience for our first airbnb adventure. Thanks again Leo and Esperanza!  It was a pleasure to meet you ...and don't be surprised to see us again.  Blessings, Jeff and Christi"

Their house is cute and homey and the neighborhood was pleasant and conveniently located for access to downtown Seattle and to the ferry docks.  The house and the neighborhood were quiet and safe feeling. Our hosts were helpful and went out of their way to meet our needs.  I would definitely recommend them and their home as a great value and a good place to stay while visiting Seattle.

They are fantastic people and I enjoyed a lot talking with them. Esperanza took a deep care about getting everything I needed for breakfast and she always wanted to make sure I was pleased and satify. Home made granola, soy milk and fresh fruit. Exactly like I do at my home! 
I jad the whole basement at my disposal with a cozy room . A full bathroom and a living room with flat screen tv. Overall I had an amazing stay and I'm very thankful to Leo and Esperanza to have make it so special."

Our room & bath were cute and comfortable, and we were provided with everything we could possibly need for our stay (inc. a magical veranda & garden!).
The breakfast was always delicious & satisfying.
The neighbourhood is beautiful (make sure you do the camp long trails & visit the local vegan place) & well connected to downtown.
We absolutely recommend Esperanza & Leo and cant thank them enough."
3531616,36957463,2015-07-03,15429788,Mercury,"Leo and Esperanza are absolutely nice, friendly and the best host I have ever seen. They provided us a lot of great touristy information and great advice for restaurants, sightseeings and activities. The house is in a very quiet and safe neighborhood which is only 15 min away from downtown Seattle. It is also very close to the Alki beach where we can walk and look at the sunset and eating wonderful food every night! The house is very cozy and clean. We have the whole basement by ourselves with our own restroom, living room and TV. The breakfast was delicious and in a variety. With the fair/inexpensive fee, this is a 200% great deal. They definitely deliver another great experience for us about Airbnb and Seattle. And I will definitely stay with them again if I ever visit seattle again. "
3531616,37674928,2015-07-09,15756940,Ming Yan,"The best thing I've ever got in Seattle is to stay in this well-decorated house with friendly and caring hosts! The location is just 20 mins from downtown, however, what you can enjoy here is peace, safety and quiet environment. I slept very well and the breakfast Leo and Esperanza prepared was very warm to every morning. I recommend traveller to stay here strongly! The only bad thing is, my time here is too short, I wish I could stay longer haha!"

All in all, the host couple is a real super host! Would recommend their place for sure to everyone! "

But what's most important: Esperanza and Leo are welcoming, friendly and open-minded people who do not hesitate to help you and answer all your questions:-) Staying with them was a real pleasure. "

3531616,45952118,2015-09-07,37727765,Karen,"This was my first time using an Airbnb and Esparanza and Leo gave me an amazing experience! Me and my boyfriend were warmly greeted by them and the house was very clean and beautiful. What was great about this Airbnb was that we got not only 1 room to ourselves, but an entire floor. We had our own downstairs bedroom, bathroom, and living space complete with a TV, lifting weights, and a workout bike. Having that extra living room area was a great way to unwind at the end of the night and just relax like we were at a friend's home. The house was located very close to central Seattle, about a 10 minute drive away from everything you want to experience in the city. There was breakfast prepared for us every morning and they were super attentive to any needs we had. Overall I had a great experience, thank you Esparanza & Leo for giving me a great impression of Airbnb and Seattle!"
944237,4431918,2013-05-05,5600812,Jason,"Emma was wonderful to work with in preparation for our trip and planning for our week in Seattle. Also the include guide in the room about the unit and quick tips for the city was very helpful. Our unit 807 was perfect for our family of 3 (My wife, 11 month old, and I). The balcony view was nice for morning breakfasts and was safe for Ellie. The unit had easy access to 1st street, Pike Place Market, and a convenient target 2 blocks away. This is a perfect place to stay if visiting downtown or the piers. The included pack-n-play was a nice perk. This was our first experience with AirBNB and I am sold on it. I enjoyed working with a person in Seattle and will choose this plan in the future. "

944237,26923689,2015-02-22,26113734,Melissa,Emma was great. She was accessible when we needed her help. The property is in a GREAT location in Seattle: close to the waterfront (great running path and ferry to Bainbridge Island); the Space Needle and Chihuily Park. The property was clean and comfortable. Three of us stayed there for a fun girls weekend.

944237,46583075,2015-09-12,35340694,Joytika,"Very convenient location. Everything we wanted to see(Pike Place Market, Seattle Aquarium, Space Needle, etc.)was within walking distance. Condo was on the eighth floor, so we had a good view of Elliott Bay. Everything in the condo was as shown in pics for the listing. Balcony door did not have a working lock, but not too much of a concern since we were on a high floor. Shower had really good water pressure which was lovely. No central air conditioning but rooms have portable air conditioners which we ended up using since it was in the 80's when we stayed and a bit humid for us. Was able to do early bag drop which freed us up to do some exploring the first day which was nice since we were in Seattle for only a short stay."
944237,52623443,2015-10-31,46135894,Phyllis,"Great location, very close to Pike Place market and walking distance to all of the great Seattle attractions.  Overall the place was comfortable, clean and well stocked with all the necessary items.  One of the neighbors had an argument with his girlfriend at 3am one morning but otherwise the place was comfortable and we felt safe.  Emma was a bit difficult to get a hold of to get the key instructions but once we had those we didn't have any further issues."
5104077,38843772,2015-07-19,726475,Caroline,"geraldine was not in town when we arrived, but her daughter who lives on the property, in a separate house, was and she was very accommodating.  she was always available by at least by text (and often by phone), and when we needed something she was apt to respond.  I didn't ask about A/C - which I probably should have (but didn't think about); fortunately the week we stayed was cool enough (and there were fans in every bedroom) that it ended up not mattering.  the neighborhood is a normal neighborhood, with a grocery store closeby, a few good restaurants within walking distance, and even a lovely thursday evening farmer's market that we were able to walk to.  if you're looking to get to downtown seattle (we went to the zoo, space needle, aquarium, pike place, ferries, etc) then understand that you are at the north end of town and will need to get on I-5, at some point, to get where you're going (and I-5 is usually full of traffic).  if you have time and don't mind the drive, then it's a nice quiet area.  the house next door is a but in shambles, but other than that sore spot it's a nice enough neighborhood. (and you can't see it once you're on the property/in the house). the house itself is quite appropriate - 3 bedrooms, 1 bathroom (w tub and shower), kitchen w all you need (even coffee and creamer!), washer/dryer, living room, kitchen table, and cute deck. the TV is only set up for DVDs, but really if you're in seattle on vacation, you're not going to sit and watch TV anyway (unless you have little kids that need a break).  it fit what we needed for our family trip. "
5104077,39395613,2015-07-23,34117968,Arcelia,We enjoyed our stay. Plenty of room for our family. Large yard for kids to room. Very clean home. 
5104077,40098035,2015-07-28,34105373,Robert,"Despite being near the northern edge of the city of Seattle, this location served our needs well because our daughter lives only a short ten-minute drive away.  The house was delightful with a well-stocked kitchen (with tools one does not normally find in a rental).  The walls featured many works of original art which make the decor unique.    The house was also replete with interesting books.  The beds were very comfortable.  The shower was a bit quirky, and the water pressure was a bit low but adequate.  We admired the backyard but, due to Seattle's legendary rain, we were unable to enjoy it to its fullest.  Overall, it was a cozy locale for spending time with our adult children."
356608,1417995,2012-06-05,1835679,Gerard,"We stayed at St John's Apartment #309 in May-June 2012, which is right in the heart of the Capitol Hill district and just a short ten-minute walk from downtown Seattle. The apartment is located in a lovely old building, right on Pike and there is parking (at a reasonable price) at the back. The apartment was very clean and nicely decorated in lovely  traditional rustic colors. There are lots of amenities, including cable TV (in every room!) and a generally fast internet connection. 

Our host Mark was a real gentleman and his buddy Johnny (who looks after the apartments) is a real nice guy. Check our Mark's framed photos throughout the building, which add a nice personal touch and gives the whole place a nice feel.
I would definitely return!

356608,1946095,2012-08-11,1742509,Judi,We enjoyed our stay and found the location to be great!  johnny was very helpful.

356608,3268749,2013-01-04,4385495,Meilani,"We love the location! You can walk to pike market and to restaurants! The beds were comfortable, and the place was very clean! I highly recommend staying at St. John's apts.

356608,3812870,2013-03-18,2354806,Sonja,"It ended up that I personally did not stay at Johnny's place but 4 of my colleagues did. They tell me that everything about this place was great! Clean, accessible, straightforward key exchange, and in a great location! They said that they would highly recommend Johnny's place!"
356608,4442332,2013-05-06,4189876,Michael,"This apartment was EVERYTHING....great location, very well done accommodations, friendly neighbors and hosts. If you are looking to stay away from downtown and live more like a local, I recommend this place to anyone. I was in town for 5 weeks with work and could not have been more pleased with this apartment. I travel full time with work, so this apartment was a nice break from my usual hotel hopping routine. Everything was clean and well kept, the kitchen was fully stocked, and the location is spot on. A short walk to downtown, a grocery store just feet away, and tons of dining and evening entertainment within blocks of your front door. If work ever brings me thru Seattle again, I will be back to Johhny's!!"
356608,5573951,2013-07-07,1611801,Rhonda,A cute and arty apartment in a quiet building but noisy neighbourhood. Easy walking distance to downtown Seattle and local attractions. Good for two couples sharing.
356608,7820500,2013-10-04,9087223,Lily,Great apartment. Very comfortable. Exactly as it appears in photos. Walking distance to downtown. Terrific Thai restaurant downstairs. 
356608,8110861,2013-10-16,4366293,Ellie,"Four of us stayed here for three nights and absolutely loved the place. The apartment itself was very charming and super clean. It was also very conveniently located. Quick walk to shops & restaurants on Broadway, Elysian Brewery, Cal Anderson Park, and actually not too bad a walk to and from the light rail station. I would definitely stay here again. "
356608,9833337,2014-01-13,10663424,Connie,"Our group of four stayed at this cute and cozy apartment for 3 nights. This two bedroom apartment was clean and had everything you could possibly need! We all brought our own towels and toiletries but were pleasantly surprised to find that the apartment provided these. Although we didn't cook anything during our stay, the kitchen was stocked with all sorts of cooking essentials (oil, salt, pepper etc.) that it would've made cooking a convenient and cost friendly option. The location was just a short walk away from downtown and Pike Place Market.
 
Christine was easy to communicate with and thoughtful. She provided us with 3 sets of keys (1 set even had a discount card to the grocery store across the street)!
 
Definitely a great experience! We’d all love to visit Seattle again and plan to stay here when we're back in the city."
356608,10882230,2014-03-11,11982313,Brittany,"This place is lovely. Nice and clean. No problems checking in or finding the location. It's super close to some great restaurants and a good walk to city center. There is a bar across the street that is quite loud on a Saturday night though there are white noise machines in each room which helps.  Don't bother bringing hair dryer or even basic toiletries, shampoo conditioner and body wash, there is plenty at the apt. Overall great experience. We would stay here again just maybe bring ear plugs for the noise."
356608,11994386,2014-04-21,2409983,Marta,"A group of us came from Victoria for conference at a hotel downtown and this apartment was the perfect homebase: ideally located in Capitol Hill, a ten minute walk downtown, close to wonderful coffee, food, bookshops, record shops and great places to get drinks. The apartment itself is fully equipped, cozy, and comfortable (the beds are great!). Definitely recommended! :) "
356608,13914755,2014-06-08,14278973,Ella,"The listing was beyond our expectations, the neighborhood was fun, busy, and very centrally located, making exploration by foot very feasible. The only negative on the location was that it did tend to get a little loud at night, but great if you are not planning to sleep early of if you are a deep sleeper! The apartment was stocked with many great necessities in the kitchen, there was a TV in every room, each bed was large and easily accommodated multiple people."
356608,14594909,2014-06-23,11803677,Aidan,"The apartment is incredibly spacious and convenient to many restaurants, coffee shops, bars, etc.  It also has very comfortable beds. 

The main downside is that the larger of the two rooms is across the street from a VERY loud and rowdy bar. On Thursday night it was regular city hum, but Friday and Saturday were painfully loud. Police actually showed up on Friday because it got so bad that the bar patrons were blocking traffic. This did not allow for restful sleep, despite the provided white noise machines (which should have been a hint).

There was also not adequate communication from the renter, who was on vacation when we arrived, leaving us on the sidewalk with our luggage until we finally got a hold of the building's grumpy manager. It turned out fine, but wasn't a great way to start our vacation."
356608,17036028,2014-08-06,6121461,Niki,"The apartment at St. Johns was perfect! Checkin was easy. The apartment is very spacious and clean. With 4 of us traveling together we had more than enough room. We did use the sound machines at night but the outside noise was not bad at all. The apartment looks just like the pictures and is very cozy! The location is perfect! Right in Capital Hill, there are plenty of places within walking distance. Also, there is a grocery store across the street. The back patio is also very nice and large included with table, chairs, and BBQ grill. We loved this place and would love to stay here again! "
356608,19864770,2014-09-20,12055743,Vince,We found the St. John's apartments to be in a fantastic location not to far to walk from downtown and most other attractions. This was our first time using Airbnb and we were very impressed with the service we had and would highly recommend anybody visiting Seattle to (email hidden)hn's apartments and If you do stay there try the bar downstairs for a beer or two and also try the Lost Lakes diner for something to eat the breakfasts are amazing. Once again we had a great start to our family road trip at St. John's and would not hesitate to stay there again :-)
356608,21657701,2014-10-21,1092897,Rajiv,"Our stay here was wonderful!  Christine was there to meet us when we arrived and the apartment was in great condition.  There was a helpful handbook of things to do in the area.  TVs in every room!  The location is great with easy access to downtown and the rest of Capitol Hill.  At night, it is a bit noisy on the street until last call, but otherwise I would definitely recommend a stay here.  "
356608,22950671,2014-11-18,22282573,Michael,"Christine was really welcoming, accommodating, and very friendly.  The unit was well located and met all of our needs."
356608,24700632,2015-01-02,17112206,Paul,"Christine took very good care of our family and me. She was fast with her email replies and answered my questions thoroughly. In addition, she answered her cell phone quickly to help us with a minor personal emergency. It was above and beyond the call of duty. 

The apartment 309 was very comfortable and had lots of hot water for the shower. There is a bit on street noise in the master bedroom, however, we found a ""white noise"" machine on the bedside table that provided a ""rain forest"" background. It worked well to mask the outside noise. The location of the apartment made it easy to get around Seattle. "
356608,25080832,2015-01-06,16631390,Grant,"The apartment was great! It was a perfect location for a short walk to restaurants, bars, and even a grocery store right across the street. A little bit of a further walk and you can be at Pike's Place in no time. Everyone was extremely nice and helpful upon arrival and the place was so great that we never needed to bother them with anything again. Next time I'm in Seattle there's no doubt I would stay here again."
356608,25306745,2015-01-12,21643998,Ori,"This was a fantastic deal for a place right in the middle of a vibrant Seattle neighborhood—I'm actually amazed that it was comparable to area hotels, but with more space (it was very comfortably shared between five people for almost a week) and privacy. The apartment was clean and well-stocked with basic necessities and a lot of items (especially in the kitchen!) that made staying there for a long time very convenient.

Because it's right across from a bar and in a very active area, the people in the larger bedroom had some noise issues, but we knew that when we booked it and it wasn't a huge issue. That's what the noise machines are for.

Highly recommended."
356608,25465334,2015-01-17,12246104,Bryce,"Loved the place! It's was clean, perfect size for five people! Functioning kitchen, clean bathrooms and water pressure and heat was great in the shower! It would be cold so having warm water fast was so nice! Would come back 100%! Oh! Also location was really nice, thought we were going to be walking a lot but everything was so close by great area, very clean and market right across the street open 24 hours! "
356608,27801426,2015-03-12,15581988,Michelle,"The location is the best! My friends and I basically walked to Pike Market, downtown, and all the restaurants everyday! There are also grocery shop downstair and really good Pho restaurant. The room was also clean and comfortable. It was a wonderful stay!"
356608,28407456,2015-03-23,20454773,Guy And Rachel,"The apartment was clean, tidy and comfortable.  Checking in was a breeze and the neighborhood handbook was accurate and informative.  
     The neighborhood was lively at night and packed with quality eateries and shops.  The location was perfect for what we were looking for and the descriptions of the apartment were spot on.  All amenities we desired were there and in great working order.  There was also an amazing Thai food restaurant directly beneath the apartment, which was perfect for our late arrival.  We loved it and would stay again in a heartbeat."
356608,29827112,2015-04-13,12931196,Vajra,We loved staying at St. John's! Ten times better than a typical hotel. The building has tons of character and its decorated with eclectic art. It was very clean and very comfortable. Christine is a very gracious host. She's awesome. We'd stay there again in a heart beat.
356608,30682396,2015-04-26,28652051,Eric,"The apartment was clean and as shown in the pictures. All the amenities were just like a hotel. Aside from the daily housekeeper visit but who wants that anyways. We arrived well before the standard check in due to the flight but they were able to accommodate us and that was really appreciated! The neighborhood is a mix of cultures. You can tell the area is in transition. On a weekend night you will see ""dive bar"" crowds walking along side people in suits. AWESOME restaurants all over. As some may have read it can get a bit loud on the weekends outside but its tolerable and little fun in my opinion. The walk to the market and public transportation is easy. The apartment is located up hill from the market so without a car or bus it can be a vigorous uphill walk back. Based on the nature of the city and the area I would STRONGLY recommend not having a car if it can be avoided. Use public transportation. All and all nothing disappointing and it was a great stay!"
356608,32839395,2015-05-22,25510410,Lee,"Nice and cosy place! Fully equipped kitchen, bedrooms and bathrooms. Also very conveniently located, withing walking distance to everything. We definitely enjoyed our stay in Seattle :)"
356608,33512960,2015-05-29,14032107,Patricia,"My stepdaughter and I stayed here for four nights.  It was easy to pick up the keys from Christine and Johnny, and communication was good.  

The apartment had everything we needed.  It was spotlessly clean and the owners showed great thoughtfulness in the amenities, such as paper towels, garbage bags, coffee filters, blankets, and too many other items to list. 

The living arrangements worked out perfectly for us, two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a decent-sized living room, and a full kitchen.  There are 3 TVs with cable -- they even get HBO.  The apartment is a little old-fashioned but very comfortable and everything works.  Parking was in the back of the building and I never had a problem finding a space.  The location is fantastic with a grocery store/pharmacy across the street and numerous restaurants within easy walking distance. The only problem I had with the location was that the master bedroom where I stayed faced the street, which could be noisy.  Also, one night someone -- a neighbor? I wasn't sure -- was playing loud music.  Fortunately the bedroom is equipped with an air purifier, an air conditioner, and a fan, so there was plenty of white noise allowing me to sleep.

All in all, for about the price of a hotel, or less, we had a comfortable and convenient space.  We would definitely choose to stay here again."
356608,34690148,2015-06-11,24956760,Jonathan,"The apartment was excellent for our needs while 5 of us attended a research conference at the convention center.  The bedrooms were spacious and comfortable and the common space was charmingly decorated and a great place to relax after a long day of presentations.  Given the number of folks that needed to get spruced up for the conference in the morning, we certainly appreciated that one of the bathrooms has a vanity separated from the shower/toilet.  The shared back porch was great and we made some delicious meals on the gas grill there.  But really, the best part of the apartment was its location.  Situated amongst restaurants, pubs, bookstores and a grocery store with everything you could need, and yet the apartment was a quiet retreat at the end of the evening. Thanks Christine!"
356608,36096867,2015-06-25,7452227,Sachini,"Christine was great, really nice and responsive. This place is wonderful. It is exactly as advertised, clean and comfortably fit four of us. The location is also great. It is right in the heart of Capitol Hill, surrounded by great restaurants and bars and walking distance to Pikes Place. Highly recommend staying here!"
356608,37829844,2015-07-11,20136087,Monica,"This is first experience with Airbnb, and we had a wonderful time at St. John's. Christine was quick in replying my emails, and Johnny was most helpful in settling us down. The apartment was exactly as the pictures, and it had practically everything in the kitchen if you feel like cooking, but you can find plenty of good food nearby. As for the location, it is perfect, within walking distance to the city center. The neighboring pubs can be a bother for those who stay in the master bedroom, but since we had the air conditioner on due to the heat, the closed windows shut all the noises out. My friends in the second bedroom didn't hear anything at all. If I come back to Seattle, I will definitely stay with Christine again!"
356608,39273994,2015-07-22,31911094,Mark,"Location was great, convenient to great restaurants and to downtown.  Beds were comfortable and the water pressure in the master bedroom shower was awesome.  Nice having two bathrooms."
356608,44524188,2015-08-27,19180210,Maureen,"Location, location, location!!  We were able to walk to all our tourist sites.  Christine was very accommodating - very easy to work with.  I would highly recommend this condo as a very affordable option in Seattle.  Maureen Fitzpatrick

356608,48499411,2015-09-27,33434375,Liam,"My friends and I have been coming to St. John's Vacation Apts. annually for several years & love it.  Christine is great at making us feel welcome and communicating with us before our trip, making sure that everything is prepared and we're organized for our trip down & stay.  

We've recommended this building to many friends over the years & everyone falls in love with their experience here.

The building has everything that you could want in a weekend/week away from home.  It's comfortable, clean, and has the warmth of being at home.  Location:  Capital Hill has gone through remarkable changes since I first started visiting 10 years ago, but I still love the vibrant life in this part of the city.  Every convenience is just steps away from your door.  

As this area of the city has grown & become a night-life destination, so the street noise has increased since I started visiting.  This is part of what's so interesting about Capital Hill, so be prepared & embrace it by bringing a pair of earplugs if you're staying Friday/Saturday night."
356608,50071752,2015-10-09,39555050,Cari,"Christine left a personal note, she provided contact information for her and Johnny in case we needed anything. "

Christine was welcoming and responsive to our every need.
I would stay there again!"
356608,52506108,2015-10-30,1878730,Frances,Christine was there to welcome us and show us around the apartment. We felt very at ease and the apartment was as described! It's a great location for a great price. 6 of us comfortably stayed there and it's so nice to have 2 bathrooms. 
356608,54238456,2015-11-17,43869653,Charlene,We had a great stay! Apartment 309 was perfect for us. It was a wonderful place to have our family together. We were in Seattle for our son's wedding. The apartment was clean and within walking distance to the venue. Christine was great to work with. 
356608,55189037,2015-11-29,7846861,Navid,"My wife/mom/dad/brother and I had an incredible (email hidden)hn's apartment over Thanksgiving. Christine and the crew went out of their way to set us up with tables in the living area so we could have a few family members over and enjoy thanksgiving dinner away from home (thanks so much!). The beds were really comforable and having 2 showers was a big deal for us. Having parking was a nice added benefit and the price ($15/day) was much better than general parking rates. I would say we had a far better accomodation experience than my cousins who stayed in a very nice downtown hotel ($50 parking per day to make up for the cheap room rate) and a different Air bnb (payed more for the same number of people in the same neighborhood and had less space). To top it all off, the crew was gracious enough to work with us so we could stay a few hours later on Sunday because our flight was at night and we really didn't have anywhere else we wanted to go. It was such a blessing being able to stay in a comfortable apartment for a bit before having a late night/red eye flight. Thank you so much!"
356608,56483221,2015-12-14,18748447,Hayley,"Christine is amazing. My friends and I had the most wonderful time living in this clean, adorable, very accommodating apartment. The area was to die for, with delicious food and drink just a few feet away from our front door. I can't tell you how many times one of us said ""Can we stay here for a week? A month? Forever??"" There were 6 of us ladies, and honestly never felt like I was too crowded. Each bedroom easily fits 2 people as does the living room. The sofa bed was actually comfy with no pokey springs of death! Bathrooms were so clean and cute. Oh and the kitchen was just great! I truly have no complaints and would love to stay here anytime I come back to visit this amazing city. Thank you for everything Christine!!"
6796246,35608517,2015-06-20,4617125,Bart,"We had a wonderful little week in/around Seattle with Mumtaz's nice and spacious studio as our 'home base'. The view over the water and Seattle skyline really were a nice daily treat for the eye. Mumtaz was a great host, being very helpful with everything we needed in the studio and checking in frequently to see all was fine. Overall a great experience!"
6796246,36230582,2015-06-26,28047958,Mark,"Located in a rather convenient location with a great view of the Seattle skyline and within walking distance of a grocery store and a Starbucks, this is an excellent deal.  Mumtaz provided a warm welcome and was very generous with the accommodations.  

The amount of space, amenities, proximity to the beach, and view of the Seattle skyline make this the best deal I've ever come across on Airbnb. "
6796246,36596994,2015-06-29,9332119,Bruce,"Very kind and welcoming hosts. This property is tucked back in a very quiet neighborhood (note... parking can be tight). Hosts live above, but place feels very private, with its separate entrance.
The view is beautiful day or night, looking N across the water at the Seattle skyline. I had a friend with a car, which made getting over to Seattle proper much more convenient (there may be a bus line). Local walking was convenient, with some great coffee shops, restaurants, groceries, etc. only a few blocks away.
The space itself was very roomy! A great value. Comfy bed. Kitchen was well-equipped for cooking and prepping meals. Laundry inside. A comfortable space where you could stay for many days."
6796246,37899601,2015-07-11,13474275,Iris,Mumtaz and her husband were very friendly and helpfull. The appartement is great and so clean. The view is like on the pictures. The bed very comfortabel. Very nice neighbourhood too. Very nice experience.
6796246,39307525,2015-07-22,29604472,Peggy,"Mamtaz and Abdul were very dear and attentive hosts; they are right on any  concern or need you might have, while also not being intrusive.  We loved our 11 day stay, and are pining for that beautiful serene view of the ""Needle"" and Seattle city skyline.  There was a neighbor who played music out on his deck one night who took requests through the trees, that was enjoyable.  I was worried about having to park on the street away from the house, but that worked out fine, and the car was safe.  The studio gets full morning sun, so if you are not an early bird I recommend eye masks for sleeping. Very comfortable, quiet and safe venue, I hope I get to return soon.  Also very clean."
6796246,39453927,2015-07-23,19839934,Valerie,"Mumtaz and her husband were very warm and welcoming. They were flexible with our arrival time and were available for questions. The space itself is beautiful and the big windows provide lots of natural light. The view is amazing! We had a very comfortable stay. Wish we could've stayed longer, but they were booked almost every night we were in Seattle! We would love to come back :) "
6796246,39808247,2015-07-26,35293739,Dean,"Mumtaz's home is beautiful, clean and the view of the City is great. Location was a 15 minute walk to the water taxi which allowed us to explore Seattle with ease. Would definitely go back."
6796246,40177693,2015-07-28,38352529,Cheryl,"We loved our quiet night  in this lovely neighborhood. Mumtaz welcomed us even though we had to serve pretty late. That was greatly appreciated. The place was just as pictured and a spectacular view.  If had anything negative to say (& it's a stretch)  I think the layout for TV watching was awkward. Truth be told, we could do with more quiet and less TV anyway. We'd definitely return."
6796246,40372994,2015-07-30,38516911,Emily,"This unit was spacious, comfortable, and perfect for my honeymoon. Mumtaz was friendly and helpful, suggesting places nearby to eat and visit. The view is incredible and I would definitely stay here again!"
6796246,40641991,2015-08-01,38171153,Leslie,"The apartment is clean, comfortable, and the view of Seattle's skyline is beautiful. Mumtaz is welcoming and warm. There are restaurants and a grocery store within easy walking distance, as are Alki beach and the water taxi (a little longer walk). Would definitely stay there again!"
6796246,40814090,2015-08-02,25801939,Emily,"We loved this property. The layout of the room accented the view perfectly. The location was excellent for us. Very close to Metropolitan Market and a quick drive to Restaurants, stores and bars on California Way and Alki Beach. The hosts were very welcoming and excellent communication. We hope to stay here again. "
6796246,41006270,2015-08-03,39396909,Shawn,The studio was really large and the view was great. The listing describes it very accurately. It's on a small street so you do have to park a couple of blocks away to walk in. It's really quiet and peaceful. Mumtaz and Abdul were great at communicating with us.
6796246,41244415,2015-08-05,4854182,Davida,"What a wonderful stay in West Seattle.  This studio is in a highly desirable neighborhood.  It was a clean, lovely, and safe place to stay.  The view of the Seattle skyline is really spectacular!  The hosts are very friendly and easily accessible by phone or messages through Airbnb.  I highly recommend this nice studio!"
6796246,41487107,2015-08-07,699829,Sylvia,"Lovely place in a lovely neighborhood. Spacious studio with balcony, great city views, very clean. Walkable to everything in the Admiral District, including stores, coffee shops, restaurants. Also close the the ferry (""Water Taxi""), which takes you downtown in ten minutes. Highly recommend this place. Communication with host was easy and pleasant. "
6796246,41631747,2015-08-08,36090702,Nicole,"Mumtaz was a beautiful hostess from start to finish.  Mumtaz greeting us upon arrival and showed us around while giving us a little back ground to the place.  Mumtaz let me borrow things that I had forgotten...that was nice.
The place was clean and well set up. It was private yet had a very open appeal.  We would love to be able to return."
6796246,42102245,2015-08-10,14565024,Rich,"The apartment is huge, very clean, and has an unbelievable view. Mumtaz was very accommodating, we arrived well past our scheduled arrival but she got us situated. The neighborhood itself is worth checking out, lots of options for food and coffee, and has a neat character. My only regret was not booking an additional night. "
6796246,42718628,2015-08-15,12742265,Robert,"Communication with our host was clear and easy. The neighborhood was quiet and pretty and the studio was exactly what we expected, if anything it was better. Better view, better location, I'd stay again in a heartbeat."
6796246,43398902,2015-08-19,38957147,Karen,Beautiful view and just what we needed.  Fantastic location quick travel to Alki beach & downtown.  Very clean.   Very simple rental with not much seating or decor but it is very clean & the view makes up for the simplicity of the interior.   Very comfortable bed.  We needed to move the couch so that we could watch tv together but this is a very minor thing.  This was our first experience with air bnb and based on this experience we will do it again.  Communication was good.
6796246,45792754,2015-09-06,14698272,Lynda,"I enjoyed her lovely home. I was writing a second novella in the series  Jet- Exposed on Amazon Kindle Worlds. So the environment was perfect!  The sweeping view of the Seattle skyline touched my artist's soul! Of course being walking distance from the Metropolitan Market and Starbucks made it a perfect location to stay in West Seattle. Thanks Mumtaz, for your gracious hospitality. "
6796246,46159803,2015-09-08,8291395,Keitha,"Unfortunately, we weren't able to spend as much time as we would have liked in this space. The view from the balcony was just outstanding! Mumtaz and her husband were both wonderful hosts! She was very communicative about when we would be checking in and came out to greet us when we arrived. They even saved us a piece of cake from their grandchild's birthday party (delicious!). The only issues we had were finding parking and a wine opener, haha! The bed was so comfortable it was difficult for us to get out for our early morning flight. "
6796246,47082474,2015-09-15,6374510,April,"The house was everything it promises.  The studio was spacious
   Clean with a great view.   Mumtaz & her husband were helpful & kind.  They even drive me to pick up a Zipcar.   "
6796246,47324517,2015-09-17,31130761,Dorothy,"We loved everything about our stay! Mumtaz was great at communicating with us prior to arrival. The studio was beautiful, and had a nice view. The bed was ultra comfortable. We could even faintly hear the sea lions way down on the shore. We wished we took the water taxi to the city center.  West Seattle is a quaint neighborhood too, with very nice homes. We were about 5 minutes from Alki beach! What a wonderful place!

We would return!"
6796246,47888453,2015-09-21,39805136,Christian,"Vi boede hos Mumtaz i 3 nætter, og havde en rigtig god oplevelse. Mumtaz er sød og rar, og meget hjælpsom. Huset ligger perfekt, og er  pænt og rent. 15 min gang til en vandtaxi og så 15 min sejlads og så er du i midten af Seattle"
6796246,48428557,2015-09-26,10327027,John,"Mumtaz' studio is fantastic! The view of downtown Seattle, looking out over the water is just beautiful. All of the amenities you would expect are furnished as well as a nice welcome plate of fruit and tea. We only spent one night before our travels took us elsewhere but we were very happy here!!

"
6796246,48603696,2015-09-27,44094645,Samuel,The studio had an amazing view and was in a lovely neighborhood.  Our host was very helpful and friendly. Everything was very clean and welcoming.  The studio was large.  I would highly recommend taking the water taxi downtown.  We would definitely recommend this place to friends. 
6796246,48970158,2015-09-29,22721175,Hannah,"Absolutely stunning place to be! The views, both day and night were incredible. Such a terrific property, and a super neat neighborhood. You can walk to the local market, or coffee in a 2-3 minute walk. Don't miss Alki beach, just a 5 minute drive-right on the water, lots of restaurants. "
6796246,49645432,2015-10-05,43148972,Kirwin,"Our Host, Mumtaz, was Excellent & Very Kind! Available for any questions needed... We stayed for 4 nights and traveled the Seattle area during the 3 days. Downtown Seattle was just a 15 minute Drive or Water Taxi away and the Mountains for hiking within a 30 - 60 minute drive. Great Central Location with A View of the City Skyline to Envy! Wonderful neighborhood with great restaurants, grocery stores, gyms & waterfronts within walking distance... Catch the Sunset on the Sky-Rises Glass' then wait for the Moon to Rise behind the City was one of the greatest moments from the Private Deck facing Downtown Seattle! No Doubt a Great Place to Stay!!! "
6796246,50354590,2015-10-11,5550144,Ginger,"The listing was very accurate and the host made us feel welcome she was there when we arrived at the house. The view is great of Downtown Seattle. We stayed 2 nights, there is a market within walking distance, coffee shop(Caffe Fiore) and other retailers. Salty's on Alki Beach I would highly recommend for weekend brunch(5 mins drive from house) . You would probably need a car like we had to get around to the rest of Seattle. There is street parking available. The queen bed was comfortable and the shower was nice and hot. The rental was perfect for our weekend trip."
6796246,50976146,2015-10-16,12987249,Jack,"This is a great place, beautiful view of Seattle, and excellent accomodations. I hope to stay here again."
6796246,51240284,2015-10-18,32085487,Lisa,"Our stay here was just what we needed after spending two days downtown. Mumtaz was great, she met us upon our arrival to provide us with the keys and was very helpful in recommending a nearby restaurant and beach. We ended up going for a good run along Alki beach. The view at night from the studio is pretty amazing and the bed was really comfortable. We would recommend."
6796246,51404554,2015-10-19,46383228,Nick,Nice place. Let us be. The owners were home the whole time which I thought was a little weird. They didn't really mention in the ad they'd be home. Right above you you could literally hear everything they were doing.  Other than that I thought it was great. Clean. Very very nice view. 
6796246,51680217,2015-10-22,46245685,Greg,"Safe neighborhood, accurate listing - super clean.
Host was welcoming and helpful - a very nice person."
6796246,52365973,2015-10-28,3355312,Ashley,Listing is as described and with a beautiful view of the Seattle skyline! I would definitely stay here again! 
6796246,57608311,2015-12-27,51330182,Carly,This studio was perfect. Everything and anything I could have asked for. The view was overwhelming beautiful and the space was very well kept. Thank you for a wonderful experience. 
1583047,7530428,2013-09-23,8754279,Eunji,"First time using airbnb and I was glad that Eric was my first host. Eric was very helpful and quick to respond (even when he was across the continent!). 
The apartment was conveniently located close to downtown. There were many things to do walking distance. The apartment was cozy and had plenty of room for the 4 of us who stayed.

one negative thing about the location was the parking. "
1583047,9041516,2013-12-02,9793809,Nela,"A great place to stay in Seattle! Perfect location, close to all sorts of fun things to do in Capitol Hill. Eric was a great host, he left great instructions and the apartment was amazingly organized and clean upon arrival. Eric was incredibly accommodating, especially with key delivery! The parking space was also a huge plus. My friends and I had a great time and we'd definitely stay here again! No complaints whatsoever!"
1583047,18916936,2014-09-02,2441460,Jacob,"Eric was easy to communicate with.

The space was as expected and conveniently located. I walked to/from the washington convention center every day."
1583047,35476633,2015-06-19,32646803,Julia,"Before I arrived, Eric and I were able to connect and set up the trip.  He mailed me the key to a place I was staying before coming to Seattle. He arranged me to have two keys, to ease our stress. There were a few issues when I arrived, like I could not find the sheets for the air mattress, and I was unsure if I could have the breakfast food in the fridge... I didn't know if the stay included breakfast or not.  During the trip I sent a message, but did not get a message back.  Later he said he had not seen it until he returned.  Overall, the place was very nice, and well situated to the conference center.  I would definitely stay there again. "
1583047,35813445,2015-06-22,21123810,Walid,"Eric was extremely clear with communication before the reservation was booked, I had questions about availability, the numbers in our party and arrival times changing leading up to the trip, but he was very fast in responding to my questions and very understanding. He mailed me the keys ahead of time to the place so that we won't have any issues getting in to the unit. The unit itself is extremely pleasant to stay in, tons of natural light that made us feel at home. He had an inflatable mattress that worked out for us as we were traveling as party of 3. The unit is located in a great part of Seattle, short walk to restaurants and bars near the colleges, short drive over to the Market, Chinatown, other attractions like the Sounders game and also very conveniently located for my morning run along 10th and 12th Ave with a great view of the water as well as downtown Seattle. It was great to have a parking spot for our rental car as parking could potentially be an issue late at night for on street parking, so that was a great additional feature. This was a great place to stay for our short weekend visit to Seattle and would love to stay again."
1583047,45137662,2015-08-31,39970031,Lucinda,"My group was in Seattle for PAX weekend and we had a lovely experience at Eric's place. He was very accommodating with my group's arrival times. He mailed us the keys a few days before our stay with clear instructions on where we can park. The apartment was very close to the Convention Center and Capitol Hill, and definitely very spacious and comfortable for our group of four. Thanks again for hosting us, Eric!"
3691288,53867015,2015-11-13,14515462,Jack,My friends were visiting me in Seattle so I booked the house for them to stay. We had 7 people and the house has more than enough space to accommodate all of us. Everything was great. The house was very clean and perfect for our needs. It's only a few minutes away from Chinatown and Capitol Hill where all of the restaurants and bars are located. Young was very attentive to our needs and made sure we had everything we needed. We also appreciated that there was washer and dryer in the house. I would highly recommend this house for anyone visiting Seattle. 
3691288,55584246,2015-12-02,48694988,David,"I loved staying at Young's place. The place is heated and has everything we needed. The house is exactly as described in the listing, so i am not going to repeat that. I would definitely come again if possible."
3691288,55704827,2015-12-04,48678232,Ron,"Our host was incredibly gracious and accommodating.  Young went out of his way to take care of our needs.  The house is charming:  

Modern, clean, comfortable and the location is optimal.  The price was right, and the experience was start to finish delightful."
3691288,57570187,2015-12-27,35549015,Daisy,The place is nice and neat. Young is very nice and helpful. The kitchen is great and has everything we need for fixing light meals. The location is close to highway and bus stop. We definitely will stay here again when we visit Seattle next time.
3691288,57906529,2015-12-30,49274086,Dan,"Great location in an up & coming neighborhood that is a short drive from Downtown Seattle. Nice little house that will comfortably house a family or group of friends.

4516960,23998990,2014-12-16,23679642,Lndsy,"Matt and Jessie made my husband and I feel very welcome.  The apartment is located in the heart of downtown Seattle, within walking distance to the Market, Space Needle, museums and more.  This is the perfect place to stay in Seattle to see it all! The apartment was clean and spacious and had many great amenities. "

4516960,24660653,2015-01-01,24192153,Jonathan,"Honestly this was the best experience I have ever had. Matt made may stay one of the easiest and best vactions ever. I would never stay at another place in the city. The condo itself is on the 10th floor so no one is above you and it is so cozy and romantic. Then the top floor has a deck and bbq so you can look out over the city. It is central to everyone, you literally do not need a car unless your going into the mountains. Everything is within walking distance. Amazing food, shops, sites, everything you need is local. I can not stress this enough this place is better and cheaper than the four and five star places in this city. Matt and his wifes communication was awesome anythign I needed they were a text or a call away. Thank you for one of the best experiences and vacations of my life."
4516960,25089253,2015-01-06,13886722,Alyssa,Matthew and Jessie were very accommodating! They answered all of our questions and/or concerns prior to our arrival and were enthusiastic to host us. Absolutely no complains! 
4516960,25312865,2015-01-12,23818077,Graham,"Matt and Jessie’s apartment was fabulous throughout.
We didn’t expect it to be as beautiful as the pictures don’t do it justice!   The building alone is beautiful.  After a very busy three-week trip this was the perfect place to go to relax before travelling home.  Everything was readily available for us.  Very welcoming hosts who made contact as and when required.  Perfect location to stay in Seattle, it really is the centre of it all, anywhere else just wouldn’t have done!! 
"
4516960,25593962,2015-01-20,11297334,Kendra,The place was perfect and beautiful! Exactly as described in a perfect location close to everything downtown...Don't miss out on this place!

4516960,26816536,2015-02-20,3158731,Laura,"I had 4 nights at Matthew and Jessie's. The location can't be beat, as it's right at Westlake Center, the Market, restaurants and so much more. I decided not to rent a car this trip, and use Uber and Lyft to visit other parts of the city. I made the right choice as everything is within walking distance. The condo is wonderful on the inside, tastefully furnished, spotless and very comfortable. The building has a door person who was incredibly helpful, even storing my bags for a few minutes before my car came. Communicating with Matthew and Jessie before the rental was very easy... clear and responsive. "
4516960,26984025,2015-02-23,20687826,Julie,Matt and Jessie have a beautiful home and it is in a fantastic location!   We stayed for three nights and everything was perfect.  I will definitely be staying here again!

We decided not to rent a car so from the airport we took the light rail into town which dropped us off practically at their doorstep.  Transportation to other parts of the city was quick, easy and convenient.  All the major attractions, exceptional restaurants, convenience stores and many shops are all within walking distance.  Communication with Jessie was very easy, responsive and clear.  Coming back to their beautiful condo after a full day in and around Seattle was a welcoming retreat!  Thank you so much for a first time AirBnb experience!"

4516960,28297190,2015-03-22,12223649,Dan,"What a great apartment! I was in town for a conference and it was an easy 3-4 minute walk to the convention center and just as quick to Pike Place Market. Just an overall great location and overall apartment.

Matt & Jessie were very responsive to my multiple questions and changes in my itinerary. 

No doubt I would stay here again if I ever visit Seattle again."
4516960,28958689,2015-04-01,29437989,Mike,"Love Love Love it! 

We had a great time and Matt and Jessie were helpful and accommodating beyond belief. Couldn't have stayed any closer to the center of downtown and as they say in real estate, location, location, location!

The building was beautiful, the apartment was perfect, we just wish our trip had been longer so we could have enjoyed it more!

We will definitely be back! My only concern is that since this was our first AirBNB experience and it was so great, there's no way they can all be this good!! Thanks guys for helping us enjoy a great trip. You have a beautiful place!

Cheers,
Mike"

The door staff downstairs are seriously some of the nicest, most helpful people I've ever met, and Jessie was super nice and responsive to all of my inquiries. This was the kind of place I looked forward to ending my days in. The only thing I noticed was the large amount of homeless people outside the building at night, but they're not aggressive. Overall a wonderful experience! "
4516960,29975289,2015-04-15,28473598,Chris,"The apartment was spectacular, great views, beautiful inside. I quite honestly didn't feel wealthy enough to stay there, so got to play that I was for a few days. 

Jessie was great, made sure we had everything we needed, and was great at staying in contact. 

The light rail is about half a block away so easy to get to from the airport if you don't want to rent a car. 

Overall fantastic place, people, city, everything was great."

They had all amenities available to us; towels,shampoo, lotion, hair dryer, etc.   It was a great location walking distance from lots of restaurants, shopping, pike market and site seeing.

Their beautiful and tasteful apartment is located a short walk from all of the attractions that Seattle has to offer. The entire apartment is beautifully finished and comfortable. 
Communication with Jessie and Matthew was seamless. They were in touch whenever I had any questions and prior to check-in, I was given adequate instructions for how to access the building, etc. I felt very comfortable throughout the entire process. 
Overall, I loved staying here for many reasons and would do so again in a heartbeat. Thank you Jessie and Matthew!"

The apartment was as pictured and it was very spacious, clean and comfortable.

4516960,35058505,2015-06-15,2326346,Maria Cristina,"I got this place for my high school friends as they were in Seattle for my wedding and helping me with wedding preparations. The apartment was clean, comfortable and beautifully decorated. It’s also located in a pretty central location in downtown Seattle and so it was pretty convenient to go around. What made this airbnb even better was that Jessie was really responsive to our needs and any questions we had. Jessie wasn’t around, but Michelle was also very sweet and helpful. I would happily recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle especially for the first time!"

It really is in the downtown core, within walking distance of every Seattle attraction we wanted to see and experience. Public transportation is right out the lobby door and buses ran on time and often. We rode the light rail from the airport and walked a short distance to get to the Seattle Downtown Core listing.

Jessie is a great host. We did not meet Jessie but we felt her great and generous hospitality through her quick response to our e-mails, her flexibility on our arrival time, and the worry-free process she set up to check in and access the unit. "

She checked in with me periodically to see if I had any concerns or questions and to make sure we arrived okay. I also corresponded with their housekeeper so I could check in slightly early and she was also super friendly and helpful - helped advise me on parking. 
Right at the base of the building are a bunch of shops and restaurants and a great outdoor courtyard and everything else is all within walking distance. 
The inside of the condo is decorated beautifully, lots of nice seating, the bed was comfortable and you feel a sense of privacy while in a big city. The concierge was nice and it was nice that the front doors were locked at all hours to feel safe.
I can't wait to stay here again and will! Definitely recommend it. "
4516960,39150388,2015-07-21,29883461,Vivien,"Jessie was amazing; she was very accommodating and welcoming. The neighborhood was right in the center of downtown. It was very convenient to walk around, shop and eat. "
4516960,39511542,2015-07-24,35676663,Van,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT if you are ever in Seattle. Jessie and Matthew are wonderful hosts! We flew into town past midnight and Jessie met us to give us the key and show us around. Their space is on the topmost floor with a decent view of downtown Seattle (there are elevators). The place is as pictured, clean and modern. There is one queen bed on the loft and a pull out bed downstairs, so it can really sleep 3. The host accommodates you with towels, linen, and toiletries. The place is close to all the major attractions. Pike Place Market, original Starbucks, the waterfront, the gum wall, The Paramount Studios and the Westlake Shopping Center are all I'm walkable distance. You can see the space needle from the rooftop deck, and if you're up for it, you can walk there too! All in all, we enjoyed our time and stay there. Jessie and Matthew are very nice and accommodating. I contacted Jessie over the app and texting and she always responded very quickly. We plan to return to their home when we visit Seattle again."
4516960,42812909,2015-08-16,4045138,Chris,"Exactly as advertised!
We had an excellent stay, truly, in the heart of downtown Seattle. We didn't even bother renting car due to the fact that we wanted the full ""city"" experience. With the Pike Street Public Market only 3 blocks away we were able to choose  fresh seafood to make our dinner in the large, modern kitchen. Only a block away is the Monorail to take to the Space Needle, EMP museum and Chihuly  Park.. all three are awesome experiences! All in all, we highly recommend.

4516960,43660454,2015-08-21,5879415,Roni,"Apartment was everything we could hope for
Clean and airy, light and well furnished.
Location was excellent.  Right in the center of everything.  Michelle, who met us there with the key, was wonderful.  Gave us lots of local suggestions.  Was very glad that we stayed there.  Very quiet in spite of the great location"
4516960,44095086,2015-08-24,16590965,Lauren,"This was a great unit, and you couldn't ask for a better location.  It was super easy to work with Jessie and do the key tradeoff. I highly recommend this location if you're travelling to Seattle!"
4516960,44592002,2015-08-27,13356065,Emily,"The apartment was exactly as described- wonderful location, beautifully furnished, and exceptionally clean! Communication
prior to and during our stay was excellent and the check-in process was a breeze. We highly recommend this gorgeous space for your next Seattle trip."
4516960,45361418,2015-09-02,4769526,Phil,This was our 5th time staying in downtown Seattle and Mathew & Jessie's condo has been the most comfortable home of them all and absolutely the best location!
4516960,47276448,2015-09-17,41656057,Bryan,Great location for walking to everything. Condo was very nice and extremly clean. Only negative was there was no AC and the bedroom being in a small loft room was very hot at night. Would reccomend! 
4516960,48675793,2015-09-28,5100440,Becky,"What a treat! The condo is lovely, and the host was incredibly gracious. Jessie answered our questions, made some recommendations, and provided easy access to the condo to meet our travel schedule. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. 

The condo is right in the middle of the Westlake neighborhood - close to everything: Pike Place Market, public transportation (light rail and mono rail), great restaurants (like chef Tom Douglas' Dahlia Lounge and Lola), shopping... We used public transportation and walked everywhere. The kitchen is nicely equipped, so you can cook after shopping at the market and local wineries."
4516960,50103952,2015-10-09,2246572,Tyrone,"Jessie and Matthew's spot is a gem in Seattle and the decor, location, and size are all amazing. I have stayed in some of the nicest hotels in Seattle and their place is just as nice if not better. I would stay there again in a heartbeat! "
4516960,50494066,2015-10-12,43855769,Kelli,The place is lovely and located in the heart of the city. My husband and I celebrated our anniversary during our stay and it was the best spot. Our hosts were great and made the experience easy and seamless.
4516960,51007427,2015-10-17,28874823,Mark,"Excellent location and a very secure area.  If you're looking for a place by Pike's Market, this is it. Updated, beautiful room."
4516960,51275943,2015-10-19,14689508,Kimberly,My husband and I enjoyed our time in Seattle staying in this beautiful home. The location could not have been better. Loved the spacious kitchen and tall ceilings. Their housekeeper was super friendly. Will absolutely stay here again. 
4516960,51698435,2015-10-24,38121271,Julie,"This is our first time using airbnb & we couldn't be more pleased with staying at this condo! Everything in the description is 100% accurate. The location is in the middle of everything, the condo is absolutely immaculate & beautiful! We will definitely be back to stay here. Highly recommend this listing!!!!"
4516960,52089514,2015-10-26,4507669,George,"The place is in the perfect location. You literally ( and I don't use literally like some people ) can not get better in downtown Seattle.  It is surrounded by everything if you love walking around town. The place is very well kept up, clean and well suited to sleep three people. 
The pictures are very accurate and another good thing is that the building is very secure.  The hosts will accommodate your needs to check-in early if needed, which in rainy Seattle means more than some places. Overall, it's a great place. "
4516960,52678955,2015-11-01,29929987,Amanda,"Condo was exactly has pictured. The location was perfect, as it was close to everything we wanted to do while visiting the city. The condo was super clean and felt nicer than any high class hotel. The host and the cleaning lady were both very attentive to any possible need. We had a slight issue with the a/c, but the host did everything she could to resolve the issue promptly. We felt very safe and satisfied with our choice and would definitely stay here again. NOTE: If you have a car, then make sure you research parking options. We learned that the street parking next to the building is free for over-night parking and the building also has a ""loading zone"" which made it easy to get our bags up to the condo. Some of the parking garages are closed between 11pm - 8am and if you need to get your car out during those times, you'll be out of luck. So, parking on the street overnight is cheaper and most convenient. Overnight parking in the garages were anywhere from $20-38/night. That was an expense we didn't plan for, but by asking several locals... we figured the above information out. You won't be sorry for choosing this condo! :D "
4516960,54086960,2015-11-16,32123014,Ronny,"The condo was awesome! It was as pictured and felt like staying in a top notch hotel suite. Building is very safe. The building and location was A+++. Pike Place Market is only minutes away and we took advantage of that. The condo is located near several shopping and dining options and the LINK light rail is just a half block away making it easy to get from the airport to downtown and other way very easy. Jessie was very friendly and prompt in answering any questions I had. Even though I did not get to meet her, she was made sure everything was A-OK!! Check in was quick and very easy. Concierge was very pleasant and helpful too. Would highly recommend!! "
4516960,54694639,2015-11-23,34991839,James,"Matt and Jessie were fantastic to work with, very responsive and helpful.  The Condo was not only in the ideal location, but had all the amenities one could want; very clean, well-appointed and tastefully decorated.

Wonderful stay, great city, amazing accommodations and very gracious and kind hosts.

4516960,55182774,2015-11-29,35966274,Kathryn,"A good sized apartment.  Good value.  Wonderful location.  Saw the Thanksgiving parade, tree lighting, protest and fireworks.  Easy to walk anywhere, felt very comfortable in the area.  Staff at the door were welcoming and most helpful.  "
4516960,55922822,2015-12-07,47798256,Derek,"The stay exceeded my expectations.  The location is prime, right in the heart of downtown. Everything is within walking distance and easily accesible by uber/cab if you don't want the exercise. Also, the actual house was exceptional.  The decor and lighting made for a comforting, modern, and warm environment. I imagine the foundation of the units was built very well, as they were nearly sound proof. I never heard any neighbors, and I never felt like I had to be extra quiet to be courteous to them either.  Lastly, Jessie was a great contact and was very accesible."
4516960,56296838,2015-12-12,27994257,Melissa,"This is THE perfect place to stay when visiting Seattle, as it's conveniently located just a few blocks from the Pike Street Market, a 20 minute walk to The Space Needle, and all of the shopping you could ever want is just steps outside the front door.  We took the light rail from the airport to Jessie's place, which was super cheap ($3) and easy. Upon arrival to their condo, we had no problems checking in and getting the keys. The condo is so unique and BEAUTIFUL! It's very clean and organized The bed was soooooo comfortable, the kitchen had everything one would need to make a cup of coffee or even a meal, lots of shelves and hanging space in closet/bathroom available to unpack. Jessie was very easy to communicate with. She was very kind to offer some restaurant suggestions after I asked for her favorites. 
I honestly didn't want our stay to end because I enjoyed the overall experience so much! I know we will be back to Seattle in the future and this truly is the only place I would like to stay. Without a doubt, I give Jessie and Matthew a five-star rating! 
I highly recommend their beautiful home! 
"
4516960,56521707,2015-12-14,25652823,Tracie,Jessie was awesome! She was extremely helpful through the whole process and their place is more beautiful than the pictures! Would recommend to all my friends and family. 
4516960,56917363,2015-12-20,44217780,Matt,"Matthew & Jessie were great hosts and took care of all my needs. It was the first time my friend and I visited Seattle, and we had a great, clean location to stay in. Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay."
4516960,57529149,2015-12-27,38047322,Andy,"Matt and Jessie's place is a beautiful Seattle loft in the heart of downtown and within blocks of Pike Place Market. We arrived by train from Seattle, and it's about a mile from King Street Station and a few blocks from the nearest LINK station if you're arriving from the airport. It was a very positive experience and check in and out was the easiest I've experienced. There is a concierge on duty what felt like around the clock, and happily let us in and provided us the keys. She helped us find groceries and gave us recommendations about the area. The home itself is gorgeous and the photos do a great job of showing how nice it is. We cooked several meals here and the kitchen was well stocked and the appliances were top of the line. Well worth it compared to the prices of nearby hotels."
8967776,52008463,2015-10-25,1167945,Scott,"Megans place was great!  It located in a nice part of town that had great restaurants,  one of my favorite was Citizen.   Very easy to book and stay."
8967776,52811006,2015-11-01,41058698,Kailyn,Megan was a great host! Her apartment is very clean and cute. Queen Anne is a great central location to stay. I would definitely recommend this place to a friend! 
8967776,53384004,2015-11-08,9346826,Peter,"Megan did a great, proactive job of communicating with us, and was both gracious and flexible.  We found the location to be ideal for our visit.  There's a grocer, bus stop, and good food/drink nearby.  The accommodations were modern, clean, neat, and as promised.  All you have to do is relax!  We had great stay & will likely be here again!  Thanks Megan!"
8967776,53850942,2015-11-13,4262275,Matthew,The house was very nice and clean and is in a great location in Queen Anne. Megan was super responsive to all my questions and was a great host.

8967776,56347011,2015-12-12,50711306,Marcos,We had an amazing time at megan's place and in seattle. Her place was cozy and welcoming everything we needed was made available to us. With a great selection of things to do around us it was a great place to stay in we will definitely book her place again the next time we visit 
8967776,56456282,2015-12-13,8141802,Merna,This is a cozy and very quiet home in Queen Anne. It was the perfect place for my weekend visit. Thanks Megan!
9096972,56711305,2015-12-16,9978676,Alex,"All in all, the stay went great! The view was awesome, and the apartment had everything we needed (full kitchen, living area, shower, comfortable bed). Kevin and Sue were great hosts; they respected our privacy, gave us a great dinner recommendation (Elliott Bay Brewery) and provided us some croissants and OJ for breakfast.

We should note that we're Seattle locals who just happened to run into some issues at our own place for the evening so we were already pretty familiar with the West Seattle area (which is awesome if you want to get out of the city without going very far). But regardless of where you're from, this place definitely provides for a fun and relaxing stay and an amazing view!"
9096972,56903698,2015-12-19,20494024,Abhinav,"Was great. We'll maintained place, didn't disappoint us in any manner."

6210952,44463612,2015-08-26,30505341,Raymond,"This is a great home in a desirable location close to restaurants, bars and transit. The apartment was extremely well set up for traveling guests with all the amenities needed for comfortable living. Everything was mapped out and there was a 'manual' to help with any questions."
6592178,35011217,2015-06-14,6315143,Peter,"Great place, great location, great trip! We really enjoyed staying at Nicole's place. It is definitely as good as advertised and then some! We got really lucky with weather and got to utilize the roof top deck, which is an amazing space. The location is within walking distance of mostly everything in the CapHill area and not too far from the downtown area as well. If I'm ever in Seattle again, I would love to stay at her place again!"
6592178,35835666,2015-06-22,9859115,Richard,Thank you for such a great experience in your home. Everything was exactly as described. My friends and I appreciated how much you made the place feel like home. Such a great experience (especially loved the roof deck!).
6592178,36431505,2015-06-28,2308467,Maria,Nicole was great.  Her communication was frequent and helpful.  The snacks she left out were greatly appreciated.
6592178,41864570,2015-08-09,40072610,Craven,"I could not be happier with my stay in Seattle.  Nicole was so helpful  settings things up, preparing the place and providing local insight.  The house was incredible top to bottom, plus Capitol Hill is a great neighborhood.  Nicole left us refreshments to enjoy upon our arrival, gave us plenty of info about the place and even sent all of her favs from the n'hood.  So many cool amenities and and a perfect rooftop deck to enjoy, as well.  This review could not do it justice.  If (and when) I return to Seattle, this is will be my #1 choice for accommodations.  Exactly how Airbnb should work.   Thanks again Nicole! "

6214998,35115679,2015-06-15,33469192,Abby,"Ravenna Retreat is perfectly named! It’s a lovely and peaceful home in a great location very close to UW, excellent shopping & restaurants at University Village and the Burke-Gilman Trail for walking and biking. We were in Seattle for UW graduation and were able to avoid traffic and walk everywhere. The bedroom is small but it’s quiet & comfortable and sharing the living room, full kitchen & patio provided plenty of space and all the conveniences we needed. And everything was spotlessly clean! Heidi, the owner, is very friendly and generous and her pets are very welcoming too—we felt like part of the household! One morning I took my book and coffee and sat in the front window seat and one of the cats joined me and curled up on my lap. This was our first Airbnb rental and it was a thoroughly positive experience. Our son’s college graduation will always be a very special memory and Ravenna Retreat will always be a very special part of it. "
6214998,35600114,2015-06-20,35151553,Becca,Heidi was a welcoming and considerate host. It was very easy to communicate with her and she made us feel at home. Her house is beautiful and she had great recommendations for places to go nearby. 
6214998,38064940,2015-07-12,37367439,Madison,"Heidi was a great host! She accommodated to our late check-in (which was such a stress reliever) and quickly responded to any questions we had (even though we were on different schedules and never got a chance to actually meet - boo!). The room was in the re-done basement of her lovely home. We were very comfortable and had our privacy. Everything was clean and tastefully decorated. The bed was very comfy too - a great thing to come back to after a long day out in Seattle. And I can't forget to mention the shower with dual shower heads! The bathroom looked great in the pictures, but the dual shower heads was a surprise bonus that we loved. Ravenna Retreat is in an ideal location if you're wanting to be close to UW or downtown as it's just a bus ride away from either. Heidi made our first Airbnb experience perfect and I would definitely recommend staying here - prime location and great host! "
6214998,38802614,2015-07-18,38624066,Michael,"My fiancé and I felt very welcome, Heidi was very friendly and her kitties are so cute!!! 
The neighborhood was great! Spacious with yards and trees in the middle of the city put us at ease! "
6214998,39824033,2015-07-26,30910464,Laura,"We throughly enjoyed our stay at Ravenna Retreat! 
When we arrived, Heidi was away, but she had organised for us to access our room & the shared facilities in the house. There was no problem with instantly feeling comfortable in our room, as everything we could have needed was there. The bed is very comfortable and the bathroom facilities are impeccable! 
The 2 cats quickly made friends with us, and are very handsome creatures!
As we had a busy, touristy, sightseeing couple of days in Seattle, our paths never crossed with Heidi- but judging by her cosy, friendly home & the fact that she was easily contactable by phone, she was still the perfect host for us!
We would happily come back to stay at Ravenna Retreat!"
6214998,41899237,2015-08-09,23970984,Caroline,"Our experience at Heidi's place was great. We weren't there much except to sleep, so not a lot of interaction. We arrived very late, which thankfully wasn't a problem. The bed was comfy, the place was clean, and the shower was excellent. Location was fine for us for what we were doing in Seattle, it's about 20-30minutes to downtown by car. Super sweet pets live here too."
6214998,45317810,2015-09-01,33469192,Abby,"Our second stay at Ravenna Retreat and just as wonderful as the first! Again everything was perfectly clean and bright, lovely and welcoming. We didn't even feel like guests--more like we were back at ""our place"" in Seattle. Thanks Heidi!"
6512979,35129459,2015-06-15,14252980,Ivan,"Brian's place was great.  The neighborhood was fantastic! 3 minute drive to a ton of restaurants, 10 minutes to Alki beach and the beautiful views of Seattle skyline.  Everything was just as described, communication was excellent.  I definitely recommend Brian and his apartment.  "
6512979,35440396,2015-06-18,25973808,Marco,"The kitchen and living room were very spacious and the apartment was clean. Brian respected our privacy and was a good host. The location was great, close to shopping and dining.  Thank you Brian!"
6512979,35703191,2015-06-21,34775350,Abby,"Brian was a great host! The apartment was clean and well-kept. He had towels ready and a basket of bathroom essentials in case we'd forgotten them. He also had a helpful list outlining any questions and even some recommendations for places to eat in the local area. The apartment is in a great location in West Seattle which is a lovely area, and there's a bus only a short ride away that takes you right into downtown Seattle (I'd recommend taking the water taxi one morning too - great views). The futon was actually pretty comfortable, if a little tight with two people, but perfect for a short weekend away. We were busy exploring, so we didn't use the TV or the kitchen very much, but it was nice to have them as an option. I would definitely recommend this place and a great price!"
6512979,38638862,2015-07-17,35204462,Daryl,"Brian's place was excellent. He made sure there were clean sheets, extra towels, and even a basket of travel toiletries in case I forgot anything. West Seattle was a wonderful break from my days spent near downtown Seattle-- it's cozier and more friendly. If you stay, be sure to head to Alki beach for fish and chips, and get your morning coffee at C&P down the street! "
6512979,39646439,2015-07-25,15581654,Kelly,"Very nice, convenient, cool space!"

Brian was a great communicator, and even purchased a fresh set of sheets for me to use which was greatly appreciated. Would definitely stay at again if ever in the West Seattle area in the future. Thanks! "
6512979,41412657,2015-08-07,32231983,Dan,Brian's place was great to spend a couple days in West Seattle. I enjoyed my stay.
6512979,41788381,2015-08-09,36486117,Kevin,"I had a wonderful stay in Brian's apartment. Located in West Seattle, it is in a very relaxing and peaceful part of town only a short bus ride from downtown. The room I stayed in, and the apartment as a whole, was exactly as described and portrayed in the listing. I would definitely rent from Brian again."
6512979,43308441,2015-08-18,11451524,Martha,"The listing was just as described. It is cozy, but actually has quite a bit of room, with a full kitchen and small living room as well as the bedroom. The bathroom was a good size, with a washer and dryer! The owner left us clean towels and  a basket with toiletries for our use. We shared the space with Brian on our final night as this is his residence during the week, and he was very gracious and friendly. The apartment was in a nice neighborhood, convenient to stores and to our family, who we were visiting."
6512979,45606704,2015-09-04,16546222,Tim,"The place is as described. It really is a cozy and convenient man cave in West Seattle. This spot is in a pretty good spot where you can easily get to downtown by either  bus or car. The bedroom/man cave, kitchen, and bathrooms were very clean when I checked in. As for the host, Brian, he was super helpful and accommodating in making my stay here great. Whenever I ran into an issue, he was very quick to help address it. He's really is a pretty righteous dude."
4432489,24453401,2014-12-28,16516540,Xueting,"It is really a great and very very clean house, we have all the basement all by ourselves, and there is no noise at all. We have everything we need, walk-in closet, clean bathroom, fully equipped kitchen, and fast speed internet. The house is close to Washington Lake, I can walk to the lake, and watch the view, it was very nice. Cathy and her family are very friendly and helpful, they provided us all the information we need, and prepared us some snacks before we arriving, thank you Cathy. Oh, by the way, if you just want to visit Seattle downtown, you don't need rent a car, there are buses go there. And thanks Lila providing us ride! We enjoy leaving here!!!"
4432489,24880166,2015-01-03,11575285,MIke,"Very clean and well located. Cathy was a gracious and helpful host. She went out of her way to give directions and local information. The unit is exactly as presented, very comfortable and relaxing space.

It easily accommodated 4 people. The couches were very comfortable. A full kitchen and clean bathroom made this a bargain."
4432489,24989357,2015-01-04,8412305,Laura,"We found the basement apartment very clean and full of extras--fruit,  nuts, lemonade, coffee, tea, etc. The bed was comfortable, though be aware it's a full, not queen.  Wish we'd had more time to explore the neighborhood, since  it's very close to Lake Washington.  All in all, a good experience and I'd return!"
4432489,25298405,2015-01-11,3142894,Jasna & Sloby,"We and our friends had great time at Cathy's place. Cathy and her husband were very friendly and helpful. Place was exactly as described, very clean, great neighbourhood, quiet and peaceful. We would recommend this host and place to everyone. "
4432489,25509747,2015-01-18,15693657,Christian,"Cathy and her husband were excellent hosts. Space was perfect for four and full of extras (various food items, games, movies, tv, and wi-fi, to name a few) that made our stay even more comfortable. Great location and quiet neighborhood with ample parking. Would definitely recommend."
4432489,26133569,2015-02-04,25338796,Emilie,"Everything was perfect, exactly what I needed for extended stay in Seattle. Thank you and can't wait for my next visit!"

4432489,26988160,2015-02-23,24973378,Hikaru,"This house was so comfortable for us. It's completely private, and there are good bed room and big couch. We could sleep well. And the neighbors were silent, also there were good natures such as park and lake near the house. We spent good time in this house!"
4432489,27466326,2015-03-05,25338796,Emilie,Really great place to come home to. I work long hours and am always happy at the end of the day to have such a comfortable place to come home to. Exactly what I'm looking for!
4432489,28043077,2015-03-16,1217247,Alice,Our second stay in this great apartment was just as good as the first! Thanks for everything!
4432489,29252456,2015-04-06,23950766,Michele,"Cathy and her family were wonderful. They all made us feel welcome. The pictures were very accurate. We walked in knowing what to expect and got it. Loved that it wasn't a hotel. Felt like it was our own home!

The location was great. Away from Seattle but close enough to go in to town each day if we wanted. Information binder was very helpful.

Loved being able to cook in the kitchen and on the grill! Thanks so much for a great stay!"
4432489,30461750,2015-04-22,25338796,Emilie,So great as always!! Clean comfortable welcoming generous family. I would recommend this place to anyone! Worth every penny and great location! 
4432489,31704825,2015-05-09,27912872,Linda,"This airbnb was perfectly located up the hill from Lake Washington where our daughter & son-in-law live and were expecting their first child.  Cathy's home was a great location with  beautiful views overlooking Lake Washington - the perfect spot for us.  The basement apartment was spacious.  The pictures are very representative.  There is a great kitchen, and Cathy had food items available for us.  Lila had a great informational notebook for us about the area and transportation.  The bed is a full bed with head and foot board which probably works well for shorter people. 

There was some confusion as to our check in. We were told that we were to remove our shoes, yet the carpet was already very soiled & covered by throw rugs.  We found the basement to be a bit noisy as the family did not removed their shoes on the hardwood floor above.  

We were staying 16 nights.  On day eight, I text messaged Cathy asking her if we could wash our linens and towels. 

Unlike other reviews we had very minor contact with our hostess & her family.   "
4432489,32550195,2015-05-19,31466155,Casey,"The neighborhood where this basement apartment is located is absolutely beautiful! Only about 10 min drive to downtown. Private entrance was nice. Very spacious, and accommodating for my husband and I and our week long stay."
4432489,33093147,2015-05-25,29057367,Melanie,"Cathy and Joe were terrific hosts! The space was extremely clean and welcoming, definitely a great and comfortable place to come home to after a long day. Thank you so much for the great stay!"
4432489,33455750,2015-05-28,30927334,Ai Lin,"We stayed 2 nights at Cathy's spacious granny flat which was very well furnished and kitchen stocked with essentials.  The large screen TV with Netflix and Xbox games were a great bonus.

Cathy accommodated our early check in and late check out request, and was very kind in helping us in an emergency situation.

The property is in a very nice safe neighbourhood, and there is a bus stop 5-10mins walk away which goes downtown every 30 mins via international district/ Chinatown.  Journey time is approx 30 mins.  The same bus going in the other direction will take you close to the mt baker light rail station for the airport.

I would recommend this flat for a relaxed home away from home break, and if you have a car or don't need to go into downtown area that frequently."
4432489,34130020,2015-06-05,8261441,Carmen,"Our stay at Cathy's place was tremendous! A home away from home. Nice and calm neighbourhood, close to the city, everything at hand. 

The place has everything you need. It is very spacious and clean. We also loved their pets :-)!"
4432489,35077820,2015-06-15,29756720,Saskia,Cathy and her husband made us feel welcome and introduced us to their cute little dog. The neighborhood was cozy and close to downtown and restaurants. 
4432489,35537277,2015-06-20,8609203,Michelle,"Cathy was a wonderful host. Communication was easy and she was flexible with check in time.  Her house was perfectly located for all that we were doing in Seattle. It was just enough space for the 4 of us. The house was well-stocked and very clean. Exactly as described, we felt right at home. The backyard area was gorgeous and we enjoyed her friendly dog and cat. We had a great time while we were they and we would stay there again in a heartbeat! Thanks Cathy!"
4432489,36189057,2015-06-26,7385844,Mark,"Cathy was incredibly welcoming and accommodating, offering great advice about the city but also giving us freedom and space to have a relaxing trip in the city. The neighborhood is fantastic, the space we rented was well-kept and up-to-date, and the commute to all major Seattle attractions was a quick ride away."
4432489,36755388,2015-07-01,10516961,Michał,"Greatest AirBNB experience so far. Place is very nice, well furnished with all that you need ready for you :). Neighborhood is also great, close to Lake Washington so you can enjoy swimming, but also close to Downtown, either by bus or car. 
Cathy and John were very helpful and overall we had amazing time in Seattle. "
4432489,37492886,2015-07-07,6627843,William J,"We were very well received, and the accommodations were exactly as described (and what we expected). The small lower-level apartment faced a well-kept back yard with a nice space to take the morning coffee or visit with our son. Thee neighborhood was quiet and residential, and nearby street parking was always available."
4432489,38248187,2015-07-14,21023366,Joani,Cathy welcomed us upon arrival. Thought we were coming later so we hung out at my daughter's until it was ready. She explained everything about the rental to us. Gave us some tips about the surrounding area.
4432489,38810973,2015-07-19,21420481,Jamie,"This place was in a great, quiet neighborhood. The space itself was roomy and very comfortable. Great quality space and lovely backyard patio. Would definitely recommend. "
4432489,39525122,2015-07-24,9154723,Edie,"Very nice house + yard, away from busy downtown but just close enough. Parking was good. Area was cute and very close to Lake Washington and a 10 min drive Downtown "
4432489,39766123,2015-07-26,4911418,Jesse,"Great, comfortable stay in a quiet and scenic neighbourhood! Cathy was very helpful during the booking process and was able to accomodate our late arrival. Would definitely stay again!"
4432489,41057552,2015-08-04,1722839,John,Great host and great place to stay. Very accommodating with our requests. Thanks again for allowing us to stay at your place. 
4432489,41744231,2015-08-09,28635240,Kimberly,Beautiful home and wonderful experience! The spacious apartment was like a home away from home. It had everything we needed and more. Modern and very clean. Cathy was great at offering advice on restaurants and transportation.  I would definitely book this spot again!
4432489,42563473,2015-08-14,17525398,Daniel,"Cathy has a really nice, super well maintained in-law unit that is very private and easily accessible. I wanted to stay close to the train station and the ballpark and the listing was perfect, if not a bit long of a walk to Safeco. This was more than made up for by how close you are to Lake Washington. I was able to take a nice long run along the water. It was picture perfect.  

I had some weird scheduling with taking the train and Cathy was very accommodating. The unit itself is really cool with a wide open floor plan and old school maps hanging up and some really funky touches. The kitchen was great and the bathroom was really comfortable. I would stay with Cathy again in a second. Thanks Cathy!"
4432489,43035839,2015-08-17,31853238,Brenna,"Apartment was lovely, spacious and comfortable - it was in a nice location on a quiet street.  Host was gracious and friendly!  We would definitely stay again!"
4432489,44105652,2015-08-24,32546276,Heather,We had a wonderful stay at Cathy's place. Her and her husband were extremely nice and helpful. Their place had everything we needed and was just a short distance from everything we wanted to do in Seattle. Everything was as described in their listing. We would definitely stay here again.
4432489,44609712,2015-08-27,36394213,Nicholas,"Clean, organized and extremely comfortable! I would definitely stay again."
4432489,45635851,2015-09-04,43009793,Jose,"Great place to stay! Definitely centrally located, nice area, great fried chicken down the street. Unit was clean and very comfortable. Would certainly stay here again."
4432489,46070217,2015-09-07,43001018,Jacob,"Apartment is very clean and identical to pictures online, in a pretty neighborhood where the leaves hang over the streets.  Very close to downtown - we preferred to drive, but public transport is really close. Really, everything you need to be comfortalbe is provided.  Very pleased we came and will definitely stay again when back in the Seattle area. "
4432489,50710111,2015-10-13,4283404,Erin,"The place was just as described and great! The hosts were friendly and communicative if needed. Clean, comfortable, great bed with blackout curtains. I slept great. Great entertainment system for some Netflix binging late at night. Convenient location and super easy street parking. I highly recommend! "
4432489,51196174,2015-10-18,32443156,Danielle,"We had a wonderful stay here for the weekend! Great location - tucked away in a neighborhood, but still very close to main roads and public transportation. And a very short (but steep) walk to the trail along Lake Washington. Accommodations were just as promised and the host was very helpful and friendly when we asked for restaurant recommendations. Would definitely recommend staying here! "
4432489,51986641,2015-10-25,32876824,Andrew,The perfect location for a getaway. Close in to city center and easy to get to from the highways. The rooms were as comfy as described. Well lit at night and was nice being able to park in the driveway. We would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a comfortable place to stay close in to the city. 
4432489,53148871,2015-11-05,44668247,Candice,"Beautiful warm and cozy private and separate unit in an even more beautiful neighbourhood. Truly feels like home. The place is very clean, spacious and has all the amenities you may need. Thank you for a great stay!"
4432489,53440427,2015-11-08,44668247,Candice,It felt like home as soon as I stepped inside. The location was better then I actually thought. Spacious and comfortable. Great view of Lake Washington a few steps away. The host was also gracious enough to extend my stay. 
5057466,30266984,2015-04-19,31314929,Maribeth,"Eli's home is beautiful. The colors and the decor are very warm and welcoming  Eli invited us to feel at home, offering us the use of the entire main floor in his home, including his kitchen with some refreshments available to us! (totally unexpected) Eli checked in with us to ensure we had everything we needed. He offered suggestions for restaurants and stores in the neighborhood and was a great host for our weekend stay in Seattle.  It was easy to find his home in a very nice neighborhood with our GPS, and parking was available on the street. We are first time users of airbnb and Eli's home and hospitality was a  great start!   "
5057466,30372302,2015-04-20,335510,Sun,"Eli's friendly hospitality and beautiful home made for a fantastic stay. We had plenty of space and privacy on the first floor and could hardly tell there was anyone else in the house. The oversized hammock in the back yard was our favorite feature,  but the well-equipped kitchen was a close second. 

You can't go wrong with this convenient location in a quiet, attractive neighborhood just blocks from the UW, several parks, and quick I5 access to the rest of the city."

5057466,30913651,2015-04-28,8584485,Diann,"Lovely room with a gracious host family. Bath room next door is large. I would stay again as the home is located within walking distance of Whole Foods, places to dine and bus service to move around the city"
5057466,31672688,2015-05-08,1382906,Karen,"Eli made our 1 short night visit very pleasant. Great communication about entry instructions, time coffee would be brewing in the morning and a very lovely home.
This is a perfect spot for getting to any locations - super easy access to I-5, easy street parking, great neighborhood of beautiful homes with nice sidewalks. 
Comfy bed, huge bathroom and easy use of kitchen and yard. Wish we had more time to enjoy."
5057466,31738602,2015-05-09,23832081,Eva,"Our night stay was perfect. Eli and his family were so polite and accommodating, and our room was charming. We very much enjoyed our stay!"
5057466,31853755,2015-05-10,24262965,Jessica,"Staying with Eli was a breeze! He was welcoming and helpful, and the space he provided was as described in the listing bio. I would stay again in the future! "
5057466,32042805,2015-05-12,25698872,Katie,"My partner and I decided last minute to drive up to Seattle, and Eli was able to have our room ready within an hour of booking! Although we did not get to meet him, he made us feel welcome by leaving a bowl of rainier cherries in our room, along with some refreshments in the fridge. Eli also provided us with suggestions for dinner in Seattle and some bagels for breakfast, which was quite convenient. The room itself was quite comfortable and perfect for our one night stay. Overall, a very lovely experience."
5057466,32394235,2015-05-17,31621902,Richelle,Eli was a great host. He was very welcoming with all information given to me. Privacy was given. Accommodations were very nice. Thank you for a nice visit to Seattle.
5057466,32668622,2015-05-19,10004630,Paola,"I had a great time at Eli's beautiful home. I had a last minute work trip to Seattle and Eli was able to have my room ready within hours of booking! He was a great host and he made me feel welcome by offering some refreshments in the fridge and coffee in the morning. I was gone all day and back late at night from work, privacy was given at all times and accommodations were very nice. It was also great to have a Whole Foods walking distance and Pies & Pints around the block for a late night dinner. Thank you Eli  for a nice visit to Seattle!
"
5057466,40686744,2015-08-01,39760134,Jeanine,This was exactly what I was looking for. My privacy was respected and all of the accommodations were as described and what I needed. Love the flexibility as well!
5057466,40754616,2015-08-02,12315360,Annette,"Eli's has a very beautiful and comfortable home in a residential neighborhood in Seattle. He was very accommodating to us and flexible with our schedule. While we did not meet Eli during our stay, he was very communicative with us and was very easy to reach. Our only regret is that we were not able to spend more time in this lovely home. "
5057466,41081899,2015-08-04,18228010,Robert,"We had a great stay at Eli's house in Ravenna.  He was a gracious host, setting us up with some food basics and all we'd need.  The house is great and the backyard is sweet, a great place to hang out after a long day in the city (there's even a lovely hammock for two).  Eli communicated promptly and clearly to me about directions, the questions I had, etc--that's really important to me, and I felt well-thought about by Eli.  Highly recommended."
5057466,42661528,2015-08-15,9017633,Kirvan,"Great room in a beautiful house. The location was perfect for my brief stay before a big bike ride the next day. Everything was very thoughtful down to the key for my individual room, if I had needed it.
Really appreciate Eli's prompt communications to make sure I had all the information I could need or want prior to my stay. Would definitely recommend Eli's airbnb and would look to stay again."
5057466,45511120,2015-09-03,3424659,Tiffany,"Eli's place was fantastic! Unfortunately, I arrived battling a serious cold but his accommodations made for the perfect place to rest and relax. We didn't get a chance to meet, but he was very responsive while also non-intrusive. The house is also walking distance from great restaurants, shops, and a Whole Foods. Car2Go and Uber also readily available. Our only complaint is that we couldn't stay longer.  "
5057466,45947373,2015-09-07,7476097,Moritz,"I was on a roadtrip through the USA with my girlfriend and a friend. Eli hosted us in his beautiful house which was exactly as described in the listing. We always felt safe in the neighborhood. 

Eli provided us with breakfast essentials (bagles, cream cheese, fruit and coffee) on our first day which made us feel very welcome. Communication was prompt and uncomplicated. 

I can recommend staying at Eli's."
5057466,46191227,2015-09-08,25034090,Vija,Eli was very helpful and a welcoming host. The house was very easy to find and the location is superb. Loved our stay there!
5057466,46434902,2015-09-10,43117541,Adrian,"Eli was such a gracious host! His beautiful home was well kept and was perfect. I wish we could've stayed longer. He responds quickly and has a flexible check-in/out. The neighborhood is about 15 minutes away from downtown Seattle & well within short driving distance to shops & eateries. Thanks, Eli! "
5057466,47123077,2015-09-15,43852320,Jessica,Beautiful house in nice and quiet area. I had the whole of the bottom floor of the house to myself.
5057466,47218628,2015-09-16,24010177,Fan,"Eli is a really really nice host. My dad I just booked one room but he gave us extra room. The room is really nice and comfortable and is really close to the u-district. Eli is really good, and I had a really good experience for staying in the house."
5057466,47678741,2015-09-21,39606237,Devin,The experience was exceptionally good. Clear communication from the owner and a beautiful clean home. I would stay again when I am in the area. 
5057466,49270486,2015-10-02,44740065,Minhui,It's a nice and sweet place. The hair drier saved our life. Eli gave us plenty of privacy. Good experience.
5057466,49704842,2015-10-05,42884076,Sheng,位置在西雅图市区很近，邻居很安静，附近不远处就有吃的喝的，当然房东冰箱里提供了很多好吃的。房东是大学老师，聊得很开心。推荐我去西雅图的朋友们都入住！
5057466,49847120,2015-10-06,42884076,Sheng,房间非常舒适，房东人非常好，还替我解决了门口停车收到超时罚单的罚金。非常愿意推荐朋友以后到西雅图就住这家！
5057466,50308955,2015-10-11,20709115,Don,"Eli's welcome package of bagels, cream cheese and refreshments in the refrigerator along with providing coffee beans for the coffee maker was a nice addition to our stay. Having the house to ourselves while Eli was away is, I'm sure, an indicator of her trust in us. Even while not being present Eli responded by email and Txt to many questions we had after checking in. Her Airbnb description describes her home as Neoclassical, which is certainly the case. I grew up several blocks away, yet had never experienced the beautiful homes in her neighborhood before. We felt safe walking the neighborhood, sometimes chatting with the local neighbors about the uniqueness of the Ravenna neighborhood. Having the bathroom with shower next to our bedroom was a definite plus too."
5057466,50851010,2015-10-15,43422824,Denise,Eli was a wonderful host. We really enjoyed meeting him and staying in his beautiful home. The location was great. He also let us use the whole downstairs of his home. The place was very clean and we appreciated the big bathroom. 
5057466,52489019,2015-10-30,30139210,Tina,"This is our second time to book at Eli's place. It was another awesome stay. All we can say is that Eli is a super host. Very accommodating and quick to respond to any of our questions and requests. We had room to roam as we had the entire first floor and yet it was very cozy and elegant. The view is amazing and the backyard is relaxing and friendly. We also appreciated his little gestures to welcome us... bagels and cream cheese, juice, fruits and lots of drinking water. I consider his home my second home in Seattle. We were very lucky to have found him on Aribnb."
5057466,52730981,2015-11-01,44471146,Alexandra,"Eli was a great host. The accommodations & other details as described. Eli was outstanding with communication, answering questions, giving suggestions & letting us know of things available in the neighborhood. I'm the most grateful with his flexibility. At the last minute my 2 sons needed a place to stay & Eli was so accommodating. Thank you so much!  Will book again!"
5057466,55680210,2015-12-04,855723,Bridget,"Eli was incredibly welcoming and went above and beyond providing bagels, coffee, and even a beer! He let me leave all of my belongings in the room while I was gone interviewing during the day, so I basically did not check out until 4:30pm. The house was beautiful and very clean. The neighborhood seemed safe, though you might want to ask him whether there are daytime parking restrictions for non-residents (I was gone during most of the day, so this didn't apply to me)."
5057466,56821973,2015-12-18,2396938,Ed,"Flexible, clean place, short stay was fine!"
5057466,57105157,2015-12-21,45473167,Kristi,"Eli was incredibly friendly and welcoming! He made everything easy and was always quick to respond to questions. The house was beautiful and in a great location, within walking distance of some cute restaurants, cafes, and other interesting stuff. I would definitely stay there again!"
2923529,13158681,2014-05-20,15109393,Jacob,"Beautiful Apartment, Beautiful Neighborhood, Centrally Located! One of the nicest places I have stayed and can't wait to stay there again! "
2923529,13255766,2014-05-23,4717648,Serean,"Sarah and Katie responded quickly to my reservation request.  They had great communication leading up to my stay.  The apartment was easy to find and matched the pictures and description well.  Sarah and Katie had everything set up for me to get access to the apartment without them, and even had laminated instruction sheets for everything that I would need to know such as how remotes worked, recycling guidlines, internet access, and how to check out.  They even had a stack of take out menus and area attraction brochures to help us find out what to do.  The included parking spot was definitely a plus.  Also, the aparment is right next to a bus stop, so taking public transportation into the city was a breeze.  I would definitely recommend staying at Sarah and Katie's place - they definitely know what they're doing!"
2923529,13371368,2014-05-26,514097,Cherie,The location of the apartment was great! It had an incredible view and it was very comfortable and cozy. It's very walkable to everything in Fremont and the parking space available to is was very convenient. Would definitely stay again next time I'm in town. 
2923529,13592820,2014-05-31,15737344,Miguel,"Where do I begin with this place. Walking into the front door I thought, oh no this place is going to be small. Turning the corner though I was thankfully surprised that it wasnt! This place was very spacious and extremely clean. The location was perfect because it had great access to everything that was needed. If I ever find myself in Seattle again I would definitely stay here again. Sarah and Katie were also great hostesses. Communication was on point and even left maps for transportation among other things. Check in and check out were a breeze and they were both incredibly flexible on when check in was. "
2923529,14353442,2014-06-17,15096891,Ridhwan,"My family and I had a great time in Seattle and Sarah & Katie were vital for that. The reservation process was seamless and so was checking in. The place was beautifully kept, spacious and had a wonderful view. All my questions were answered so promptly that it felt like we were talking in real time! The various take out menus, bus routes and other brochures made our stay much easier as well. All in all, if you're looking for a place to stay in Seattle for a few days, I would highly recommend staying here with Sarah & Katie as the hostesses."
2923529,14695002,2014-06-24,15483390,Gunter,"This was my first experience with airbnb - and I can not find anything to complain about. The accomodation was ""awsome"" as a Seattelite would probably phrase it. Location is perfect for conquering the city by bike, and for enjoining the great neighbourhood of Fremont.
The flat itself was well equipped with everything from Musik (had no reason to watch TV), kitchen, balcony with morning and (!) evening sun (at least around solstice) and a BIG barbecue (that must be the american dream).   "
2923529,15319155,2014-07-07,15309670,Alexis,Great apartment! The place was very clean and welcoming. The location was great. The free parking was a bonus too. Would recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle! 
2923529,15455871,2014-07-09,4873738,Eva,"We really enjoyed staying at Sarah and Kate,s apartment. It was spacious and clean and the location was very funky.
"
2923529,15820282,2014-07-16,15492181,Brian,"For those who read only the first line of a review, let me say this is a fantastic choice for a place to immerse in the beauty of Seattle, and you should definitely choose Sunrise View! Don't trouble yourself with all the other choices on airbnb. This place is a home run.

Sarah and Katie made the process so easy and smooth with prompt and thorough communication, and the space was clean, easy to assimilate to, and just a joy to be in. The building is quiet, the views are vast, and the vibe is great. The bed is so comfortable we just had to see who makes it and hope to get one ourselves! The constant breeze and sunlight make the space. 

The location is perfect! We easily parked our rental car in the dedicated space in the alley. We also were able to easily get Uber rides from the front of the house for making trips where a car was more of a hassle than a benefit like going downtown. Easy walk to coffee and we spent each morning on the canal watching the boats roll by with our morning cups.

The house tech is solid, with great wifi and all the video and sound you could ever need. We enjoyed watching the world cup on the giant tv and sound system! After a long day of seeing the city, or venturing out to the mountains, we always looked forward to coming ""home"". 

We will not even look for another place the next time we visit Seattle, we will book Sunrise View without a second thought. Thanks to Sarah and Katie for being super easy going, friendly and helpful, and making our trip perfect!"
2923529,16330735,2014-07-25,14077540,Thilo,"Sarah & Katie have a wonderful apartment in a very nice neighborhood, I can only recommend these hosts and their location."
2923529,16414423,2014-07-27,17046746,Claire,"This apartment was great, and we loved being a short walk across the bridge from Fremont. Public transportation was easily accessible, as well. Sarah and Katie left us tips, menus, etc. We were on our honeymoon, and they even left us a note wine to celebrate! Everything was easy and as described. "
2923529,16769253,2014-08-02,2744518,Lars,"This was an amazing apartment. Open, great location, and Sara & Katie were immensely helpful. I highly recommend it if you'll spending time in Seattle."
2923529,16942792,2014-08-04,18769282,Susan,"The apartment was lovely, super comfortable, very clean and full of light. It was also very quiet which was exactly what I was looking for. It was great to be able to sleep with the windows open with just a fan keeping a nice cool breeze blowing through the room. The fan in the bedroom was very neat, I didn't use the remote control, but it was cool that it had one. The bed was also so comfortable, I regret that I couldn't bring it home! Best sleep in a long time. 

The hosts were very nice and helpful when I made some dumb mistakes in following the instructions for the key management. I really appreciated it.

The instructions/house rules were on the table where you couldn't miss them and were very complete. The wifi network worked well and I was able to watch streaming video without a problem. I didn't use any of the other tech, but the tv, etc. looked nice. 

The kitchen was basic, although I didn't really use it. The bathroom was also basic and somewhat small, but the shower had plenty of pressure and hot water and the towels were great.

Overall, it was a great experience."
2923529,17824966,2014-08-18,15653347,Galina,"The apartment is in a great neighborhood, easy access to major Seattle points. Sarah made it very easy to check in/out. She was immediately available if we had a question and  was accommodating to our needs. 
The apartment has everyone one would need. It's spacious, bright, clean. It made our 2 week stay feel like we were home. 
"
2923529,18024333,2014-08-20,19274989,Uchenna,"This apartment was such a pleasure to stay in. It was exceptionally clean and there was plenty of space for the two of us to relax in and feel at home. It was very easy to keep in contact with the hosts and their instructions were very clear and easy, making our first experience with Airbnb a very positive one! It was such an awesome experience that we would happily stay at this listing again for all future visits to the city."
2923529,18153583,2014-08-22,3624305,Paul,"Sarah and Katie have a beautiful apartment. It was very clean which I can be picky about and the furniture and bed were quite comfortable. Plenty on amenities like an excellent tv, balcony, fresh towels, dedicated parking spot etc. Lots of windows which kept the place cool while providing lots of sunlight. Would definitely stay again."
2923529,18497868,2014-08-27,6570383,Erin,"Unique, friendly and un-touristy neighbourhood. Homey, comfortable and beautiful place. Comfortable bed. Everything you need. Easy check-in process. Thank you Katie and Sarah!"
2923529,18616909,2014-08-29,13793941,Tori,"Katie and Sarah's pictures and description is very accurate of what the apartment is like. You have quite a bit of room for two people. Easy access, good location and good directions to get the apartment. Katie and Sarah and both very approachable and helped me in any questions I had. I would book again if ever back in Seattle. Thanks! "
2923529,19023958,2014-09-05,16435646,Patti,"We were very comfortable in this home and appreciated the relaxing atmosphere of so much space for us to enjoy.   It was a fabulous first experience for us with Air BNB when so many 'first experiences' are not.  We would definitely stay here again; Sarah and Katie left so many Seattle tips for us re places to visit, sights to see, foods to enjoy.  We loved our Seattle experience."
2923529,19173151,2014-09-07,20547224,Jis,The place was neat and clean. There isn't too much nightlife around there which can be a pro or con depending on what you are trying to do. There is ample public transportation in the area. She has a really good sound system with a nice tv and some cool led fittings. The bed was comfortable. 
2923529,19459105,2014-09-13,11308948,Jim,"This was our first trip to Seattle and Fremont Sunrise View was a terrific home base. It is exactly as advertised. The property is light, airy, comfortable, and clean. Even though we rented a car for extended tours of the area, we were thrilled that public transportation was so close and we didn't have to take the car downtown! The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful with many people out walking, running, and biking. There are several great restaurants nearby - we enjoyed everything from fresh seafood to amazing burgers.

Sarah and Katie provided tons of information about attractions, restaurants, bus routes, ferry routes, etc. They were even available during the week when we had additional questions.

We slept well and enjoyed great water pressure in the shower. We would recommend this property to anyone! Thanks so much for your hospitality!"
2923529,20192193,2014-09-25,2855041,Jonathan,Great place. Exactly as described and really close to the Fremont bridge. Large space with lots of light. The hosts were very accommodating to our family and supplied us with a lot of information on what to do during our time in Seattle. 
2923529,20434768,2014-09-29,19788938,Liz,We got to meet Sara in person the day we checked in.  She was very kind and made us feel welcome.  It is a large apartment and the windows and views are amazing.  The bedroom is cozy and the bed was very comfortable.  There were three of us and we all had plenty of space to move about.  It was nice to have a full kitchen to make our bagel breakfasts and popcorn one night.  It was our first experience with Air BbB and we were delighted with how easy and efficient it is.  We used Lyft to get around but always walked into Fremont.  There is a great trail along the river that will take you to the Ballard Lockes.  
2923529,20897442,2014-10-07,2133103,Robyn,"Loved, loved, loved Fremont Sunrise View! This spacious apartment makes you feel like you are outside, so much light! The bed, pillows and bedding were so awesomely comfortable! The location was perfect for our visit to Seattle. It is a few blocks walk to the Fremont area, full of great shops, restaurants and a food coop. Did I mention the chocolate factory tour at Theo Company in Fremont? Mmmmm, indeed! Easy access to downtown as well. Whenever we had a question, we received a quick email response. We had a fantastic experience. Thanks Sarah & Katie!"
2923529,21616323,2014-10-20,9532292,Julie,"We enjoyed out stay at Fremont Sunrise View very much. Well located near the Fremont Bridge and easy walk to Fremont area. Apartment was clean and comfortable and bed was especially nice. Owners communicated promptly to all questions. This is a nice home base for Seattle travelers
"
2923529,21915083,2014-10-26,10897445,Andy,Exactly as described.  I got this place for my parents who were visiting from out-of-state.  Perfect setup.  Highly recommended.  A+++
2923529,22468497,2014-11-07,3904278,Michael,"Great location, near downtown Fremont. We loved how close it was to downtown Fremont and enjoyed the restaurants nearby. The Fremont Sunrise View was spacious, clean and well outfitted with everything we needed. Sarah & Katie were very responsive. We enjoyed our stay."
2923529,22622620,2014-11-10,3593479,Barbara,"Everything was efficient, smooth and painless. Even more than your average hotel in terms of responsive communication.

We also really appreciated the option to check in early and check out late since there was no one right after us.

The place is just how it looks and sounds. Conveniently located, clean and bright.

Would stay here again."
2923529,23134630,2014-11-23,23878378,Sabrina,"Sarah and Katie were quick to reply to my reservation request and made obtaining access to their apartment simple to follow. The parking space directly behind the building was super convenient and the apartment is cozy and inviting, from the carefully-stocked kitchen to the dreamy bed. We loved it! Will definitely request to come back again when we can stay longer! 

They are in a very hip and trendy area of Seattle, easily accessible to just about anything downtown and in the University district. Yet the apartment itself is quiet and peaceful. A perfect urban experience with just the right amount of privacy inside. 

A definite recommendation!"
2923529,23843655,2014-12-12,13494929,Ranae,"The apartment was just as I expected from the photos.  It was a perfect set up for me since I was visiting my son who attends Seattle Pacific University.  

This was my first experience with airbnb.  It was so much better than a motel.  I will definitely be back. "
2923529,24443931,2014-12-28,10701308,Paul,A very welcoming host.  The environment exceeded our expectations.  Very nice location in Fremont.  Close to downtown and U of W.
2923529,25221431,2015-01-09,17796277,Larry,"Sarah and Katie have a really great place. It's clean and cozy. They have gone out of their way to make both their home and Seattle accessible, and all the best spots in the city are close by. We had a great time. "
2923529,25361447,2015-01-13,3675548,Hugh,"Wonderful. Very nice, comfortable, amenable place. The neighborhood is lovely. The place is quite big and has a lovely view.  Loved it. Was sad to leave! Highly recommend."
2923529,25540931,2015-01-19,10676343,Kelly,"Fantastic place! Great view, cozy, quiet, roomy, accessible to everywhere, and perfect for a weekend in Seattle! Thanks so much! "
2923529,27384799,2015-03-03,23899845,Don,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Great location—easily accessed by car and just a quick stroll into Fremont for restaurants and shops. The unit was cozy, warm, quiet, and comfortable. Everything worked just fine, and the bathroom has been newly remodeled.  Sarah and Katie were great."
2923529,27892876,2015-03-14,908218,Michael,"We absolutely loved this apartment. It's gorgeous, and the photos don't even do it justice. Everything was spotless and beautiful, and it was the perfect home base for a week of exploring Seattle. The living and dining room were super comfortable, and sometimes it was hard to get motivation to leave! Big windows look out over the canal and Fremont Bridge, and sunrises over the Cascades in the distance were gorgeous. The bathroom, just renovated, was terrific with one of the best showers we've used in our lives. The kitchen was also great, well-outfitted with everything we needed (coffee, mugs, bowls, utensils, coffee, more coffee, etc).

The location, right near the Fremont Bridge, was perfect for exploring the city's neighborhoods. There were great restaurants in Fremont in easy walking distance, and Wallingford, Ballard, and Queen Anne were 
all 10 minutes away by car. It was also easy to get downtown, both by car and by transit. If you're the type of vacationer who really loves to get the feel of a city and its neighborhoods, I can't think of a better place to stay.

Further, Sarah and Katie were great communicators, giving us so much information about the various neighborhoods in the city and what we should do and visit. Everything was clear and straightforward, and there was even a big binder with instructions for lighting, heating, parking, the entertainment systems (great in both main rooms!), checkout, and everything in between. Checking in was super easy and we were able to do it on our schedule, and checking out was easy too (aside from leaving at 6 am, but blame the airline schedule for that one...).

If we ever need a place to stay in Seattle again, this will ABSOLUTELY be the first place we check for availability. It was a completely wonderful experience, and you should go and stay there."
2923529,28411934,2015-03-23,994595,James,"What a great place and what wonderful hosts! The apartment was beautifully furnished, filled with natural light, nicely appointed (love the new bathroom) and it served as a nice jumping off point for exploring the city. I also really appreciated how they went out of their way to put together in incredibly thorough visitor guide to make finding my way around (both the home and the neighborhood) easy. I would happily stay there again."
2923529,28569886,2015-03-26,3104188,Will,"We had a fabulous time staying here. The apartment is beautiful, spacious, bright, and clean. The location couldn't be better, right across from Fremont and its many restaurants, cafes, and bars. Would love to stay here again next time we're in Seattle! "
2923529,28888791,2015-03-31,1575497,Brittany,"We LOVED our stay here! While we didn't get to meet them, Sarah and Katie were super friendly and prompt responding to any questions and messages we sent. Their apartment is located in an amazing area and we loved being able to walk across the bridge to go explore the Fremont area. We would absolutely recommend to stay here :) "
2923529,29066418,2015-04-03,2484965,Kelly & Martin,Great place. Very spacious. Walking distance to Fremont.

2923529,29569429,2015-04-09,8935574,Sarah,This apartment is seriously amazing. The views of the bridge and the light coming in in the morning was amazing. It was also nice to have so many wonderful amenities. I would recommend this place to anyone. 
2923529,29758857,2015-04-12,24500968,Alyssa,The place was great! Very clean and organized. The location was amazing! Easy to get to everywhere we wanted to be. Check in and out were very easy! Thanks for the stay! 
2923529,30084889,2015-04-17,875045,Jason,"This home was the perfect getaway for a few days of work-cationing. The home is a wonderful, well-appointed home with tons of natural light and an incredibly cozy and welcoming feel. I was able to walk to dozens of local places for great food and drink, and was able to work happily in the quiet home with great internet. 

Sarah and Katie were incredible hosts who helped me before and during my stay making it really easy and simple to come up for a few days and get some work done. Whenever I messaged them they replied very quickly and with great information. They were the epitome of perfect hosts, and their home was exactly what I was hoping for."
2923529,30559712,2015-04-24,8614550,Glenn,"We stayed at the Apartment mid-April 2015.   We found it to be in a very desirable location. It was less than a mile from a Safeway Grocery store and a Trader Joe’s. We were able to easily get to Seattle Center, Pike Place, Fremont, Ballard, and were about 30 minutes from the ferry in Edmond, so it was easy to travel and explore the surrounding area.
The apartment was very clean and comfortable. There was a roomy living area and a comfortable queen bed. The bathroom was new and had a great shower. The kitchen was equipped with a coffee maker, toaster oven, dishwasher, and pots and pans. We also were grateful for the washer and dryer in the apartment since we had been traveling for a week. The only additional appliance we would have liked is a microwave oven. 
All in all, we totally enjoyed our 6 days here. 
Sandy and Glenn Peterson

2923529,32754643,2015-05-21,12778461,Francisco,"Sarah and Katie received me and my wife and show us how everything works at the apartment, they were very kind. The apartment looks just like in the pictures, very well equipped . Located in a nice neighborhood close to many bus stops that one can easily move around the city by bus and at the same time was located at a walking distance from many restaurants and venues .
We had a really nice time, totally recommended."
2923529,33307923,2015-05-26,2182331,Martin,"Sarah and Katie have a beautiful apartment. It was super clean and well equipped. Fremont and its coffee shops, bars and restaurant are only a short walk away, and the buses make it super easy to get to the other parts of Seattle. Communication and check-in/out were totally effortless. I would definitely stay at their place again."
2923529,33817227,2015-06-01,32083722,Rhoderick,"This was my first Air BnB experience, and Sarah and Katie exceeded my expectations.  Sarah and Katie were the perfect hosts and the place is simply amazing.  Even though we didn't meet them, they were very responsive when needed.  Sarah and Katie had their whole place in order with instructions for everything.  The place was perfect for my first anniversary.  The location is very convenient for a car or public transportation.  Downtown is only minutes away, and Fremont is a walk across the bridge.  When we return to Seattle, we will definitely book again!"
2923529,34005355,2015-06-03,32353214,Beka,"The apartment was clean and very roomy for a two person stay. There are restaurants and bars within walking distance in Queen Anne and Fremont, and the area is quiet at night. Downtown is a bus or car ride away (typical Uber pickup time for us was about 5-7 min), and I really appreciated that Sarah and Katie were very responsive to any messages sent."
2923529,34208715,2015-06-06,31511803,Alice,"We had an awesome stay at Sarah&Katie's place- it is super clean, spacious, airy and has everything we needed for our holiday. It is located in a leafy area with great views of sunset or sunrise (if you get up early enough) through the big windows. Both the couch and bed are very comfy!! Too comfy that we almost fell asleep while sitting on the couch enjoying the views and the sun. It is close to bus stops and its easy access to downtown and U district. We would highly recommend this place!!"
2923529,34578349,2015-06-09,27379367,Valerie,"Sarah and Katie's condo was a lovely, light and super clean place to stay. Everything is exactly as advertised, the location could not be more perfect, walk to Fremont and really pretty views from many windows."

2923529,36774987,2015-07-01,20270178,Anthony,"I booked this condo for my parents to stay in while visiting me in Seattle. It was a great location right between Fremont and Queen Ann neighborhoods. The condo was clean, set up nicely and plenty of amenities to accommodate.  Katie travels a lot for work but either her or Sarah are reasonably responsive by email or phone. Seattle is an expensive market these days but this condo was well worth it. My parents had no complaints and enjoyed their time. If you are lucky there might be a few beers left in the fridge from the last stay.   "
2923529,42820110,2015-08-16,29171653,Rob,"Immaculate, roomy and well appointed one bedroom in a six plex.  There are nice amenities such as smart TV with surround sound, gas barbecue. Perfect location near the foot of the Fremont Bride, bike path, ship canal, and about 15 minutes into the City. Thumbs up!"
