6154478,51272219,2015-10-19,38789269,Steve,"It was just like it looked in the pictures and description. It was nice to be so close to Green Lake, and we all had a great time."
6154478,53494963,2015-11-09,2654816,Ashlee,"Andrew's place was perfect for our needs. The lake is absolutely gorgeous, and we enjoyed running the loop several times during our visit. Ballard is awesome, and it's only about a $10 uber ride from his place. Also, PCC Market is within walking distance, and they have several options for grab-n-go, a quick bite or some yummy treats. My husband and I thought we had the most comfortable bed ever....until we stayed at Andrew's. Everything about our stay was comfortable and pleasant. We would definitely love to stay there in the future. Great spot!!"
6154478,57045878,2015-12-21,26136760,Jeannie,"We had a great stay at Andrews! The location was perfect and the townhome was exactly what we needed! Adorable place, would definitely rent again!"
6154478,57682963,2015-12-28,13666546,Daniel,"We had a wonderful experience staying at Andrew's place .  The home was very comfortable , clean, and exactly as advertised .  I loved having a lock box on the house so that we could arrive without having to disturb our host.  This is a prime location in the green lake nieghborhood and is close to a great coffee shop and several restaurants .  "
5593399,29199983,2015-04-05,8006919,Kate,Great place to stay! Close to everything we wanted to do! Amazing view from the park right next to the condo. We would definitely stay there again. 
5593399,31241780,2015-05-03,30854928,Cynthia,Beautiful condo and great location! We would definitely stay again! 
5593399,31922758,2015-05-11,21289023,Lissie,"Great experience. All the clinic action was swift, and directions for entering the condo were extremely organized. The condo is spacious, pretty, and very clean. The bed was so comfortable and the kitchen was very well stocked for cooking. Since it's a little removed from the downtown area, we were so glad to have a parking spot for our car! Would definitely return. "
5593399,33150385,2015-05-25,3579605,Andrew,"Our host was helpful and responsive with our needs. The condo is located just outside of downtown with a parking garage conveniently in the building. The space was large, had a reliable WiFi setup, and satisfied us. Plenty of room in the family room and dining room."
5593399,34863394,2015-06-13,31758696,Dominic,"Michael and Hope's apartment is on Beacon Hill part of Seattle, WA.. It's exactly as shown in the pictures, large and spacious, with a place for us to safely park our car and use public transportation to all the sights in the city. Michael was kind enough to help us navigate the city. The rental also gave us high speed internet access to make reservations and do our airline check in. Mike also gave us late check out, and let us leave our car in the garage till 10:00pm on our last day so we could spend the day in Seattle and catch the red-eye home."
5593399,35559054,2015-06-20,4242187,Karl,"Michael did an excellent job of hosting us for our short visit to Seattle!  The place was very clean and tidy, and the location was excellent.  He even arranged for a lift back to the train station for us, which was above-and-beyond!"
5593399,48001101,2015-09-22,20829555,Tony,"We like the Parkside Condo, easy access to shopping and downtown.  The building is a bit old but the unit interior is comfortable and rather spacious.   Condo is well stocked and we managed to cook a few lunch/dinner after a long day out.   We checked in rather late (around 10pm) and Mike was emailing us to make sure we had no problem getting into the condo.  He is helpful and available when we had questions.

When we were there, one of the elevators in the building complex trapped a resident for a few hours (from 11pm - 3am in the morning).   We did not know about it until some neighbors gathered around the building courtyard and when the police/fire department showed up around 2:30am.   From what we were told the poor guy had been kicking & shouting for help since he was trapped.   We used the stairs after this incident.    "

1148517,5326752,2013-06-24,129599,Sarah,Great little house! We had a perfect stay and loved being close to the action in Ballard. Also loved the outdoor space.  Fleur was extremely helpful in helping us plan our trip. 
1148517,5419666,2013-06-29,5419530,Shawn,"I loved staying at Fleur's house.  It is in my favorite part of the city, Ballard neighborhood!  It is a lovely and comfortable home.  She had everything I needed for my 5 day stay.  I would definitely stay there again!"
1148517,5662749,2013-07-10,6504755,Billy,"Fleur was easy to make arrangements with, and her cottage is a perfect, cozy place to stay in Seattle. The location is convenient to so many great neighborhoods and activities. Thanks Fleur for a wonderful stay!"
1148517,5761322,2013-07-15,486997,Lisa,"Fleur's place was perfect for us and we were really happy we decided to stay in Ballard so we could spend our two days in Seattle exploring this great neighbourhood. Fleur's place was really well located, easy walking distance to everything. It was also full of character and felt very  homey. It was a pleasure meeting Fleur towards the end of the trip."
1148517,6130583,2013-07-31,6606105,Zach,"Fleur is a great host. Easy to communicate with and very accommodating. Her place is close to all the action in Ballard. The house is well equipped, spacious, and comfortable. I would recommend her place to anyone visiting Seattle."
1148517,6459292,2013-08-13,6886890,Melissa,"Absolutely loved Fleur's little Ballard cottage! (We would have left you flowers, Fleur, but we ran out of time!) My girlfriend and I stayed a weekend as we attended a workshop in the Greenwood area and this was the perfect hide-out. Market Street with it's coffee shops, restaurants and bars is all within easy walking distance. The house was lovely and clean... and the little kitchen well equipped. I will definitely stay there again!"
1148517,6684715,2013-08-21,4780849,Patti,"What a terrific location! We loved it~it's an especially perfect house for someone who is young and laid back. We walked all over Ballard to restaurants, Ballard Market, Farmer's market, galleries, bars...it was great. Took the bus to the city and Car2go is a a good alternative,too. We had rented a car and never had a problem with parking out front. "
1148517,7013942,2013-09-03,6642762,Leslie,Fleur's cottage was very clean and comfy. It is in an excellent location central to everything in Ballard. We would stay there again next time we visit the city. 
1148517,7180188,2013-09-09,375104,Mj,"Fleur did a great job of creating a cute and comfortable home for us to stay in. Her cottage is convenient to Seattle hotspots, not least of which her immediate neighborhood. The beds were comfortable and she was a friendly and accommodating host."
1148517,8540222,2013-11-04,190776,Laurie,Fleur's place is awesome! You couldn't ask for a better spot in Ballard. I look forward to coming back again.
1148517,8665473,2013-11-11,7411960,Francesca,"Fleur's house was perfect!  Very cozy and great location.  1 block to a grocery store and great breakfast/coffee place, and lots of restaurants just a couple blocks away.  Both the bed and futon were comfortable (4 female friends slept there comfortably) and the house was charming.  I highly recommend it. "
1148517,9133912,2013-12-09,9771325,Zoe,"Such a cozy place, everything we needed for our weekend get away and a perfect location to hanging out in Ballard. Fleur was very helpful and accommodating to our plans."
1148517,9191997,2013-12-12,9817257,Debbie,"We stayed at this cute outage in Ballard during a visit to family there. The cottage is in a great location, close to shops, cares and restaurants.  The cottage was clean and comfortable.  We hope to be able to stay here again next time we visit!!"
1148517,9404143,2013-12-27,52854,Libby,"Fleur's cute house was wonderful for our stay over Christmas.  Everything was so clean and cozy....  We did a little cooking and even walked to Old Ballard for dinner. 
Thanks Fleur!       We had a great stay!"
1148517,10290414,2014-02-11,10284066,William,"In spite of record-setting cold weather, Fleur's cottage was warm and cozy when we arrived!  Everything was great, and we really enjoyed our stay.  We'll probably stay here again, as we regularly visit the area."
1148517,11181523,2014-03-24,6883700,Nina,"Just finished a weekend trip at the cottage with another couple. There was enough room for all four of us and the location was within walking distance to great pubs and restaurants. We didn't get a chance to meet fleur but her home was a great spot and a welcome change to a tiny hotel room. No issues, great trip. "
1148517,11880075,2014-04-17,12599989,Rob,The reservation was canceled 22 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1148517,13454383,2014-05-27,884408,Jody,"The cottage is exactly as pictured ... a little house with 2 bedrooms, a separate living room and kitchen and a little back yard.  You are a block away from food, coffee, etc.  Fleur was a great host.  We enjoyed our stay and will stay again next time in Seattle."
1148517,14348655,2014-06-17,6865005,Teresa,"Enjoyed our stay.  The beds were comfortable and the location cannot be beat.  There was a fully stocked kitchen although we only used some glasses and French press.  24 hour grocery within 2 blocks and we walked to restaurants, too.  Fleur met us there and she was very nice and filled us in on what to do.  She also answered our questions during the stay via email.  Highly recommend!"
1148517,15186583,2014-07-04,15696765,Scott,"Great location and great place if you have kids. 

Walking distance from anything you might need and less than 10 minutes to downtown. Lost of parks in the area and very family friendly."
1148517,15685785,2014-07-14,15500192,Lindsey,"Fleur's home was a wonderful place to relax and unwind during our trip to Seattle for a wedding. Her home is cozy and offered great space for the four of us who were staying there. The location was fantastic, as it was a 10 minute walk to the actual ceremony. The bus took us straight to Pike Place market in a direct route and allowed us all to see parts of the city we normally passed by on the I-5. We spent Saturday morning in Ballard at the markets and had a surprisingly great breakfast from the Smoke Shop diner. We were all very happy with our experience, spending a beautiful, hot weekend in Seattle."
1148517,16202192,2014-07-23,8679240,Lilli,"Our group of 4 visited Seattle and had a very comfortable stay at Fleur's cottage.  The neighborhood was great for walking to get dinner/drinks after a long day out.  The living room/kitchen area was roomy enough to hang out and chat or have a few beers too.  There is even room to sit outside.  All of my friends loved the cottage and, to my knowledge, slept comfortably.  We definitely chose the right accommodations for our trip."
1148517,16973683,2014-08-05,13970557,Elizabeth,"My family really enjoyed staying in Fleur's cottage. It was clean, charming, and comfortable. Its location was really great - a convenient walk to a very good grocery store and perfect for exploring downtown Ballard. The whole family walked to the Farmer's Market on Sunday morning. Given the very warm weekend, we thought the house stayed cool enough to relax in during the afternoon, ventilated only by fans.

Fleur was also a pleasure to work with in renting the cottage. She was very quick to respond to messages and left very organized and clear instructions in using the cottage's amenities.  "
1148517,17437752,2014-08-12,2253189,Kurt,"Fleur's cottage couldn't have been a better find. The location was perfect, one block from a grocery store and 2 blocks from the center of Ballard. The house had everything we needed and was very welcoming. The rooms and amenities were as described and we definitely felt like we were staying at a friend's house. We'd love to stay again next time we travel to Seattle."
1148517,17851459,2014-08-18,2204526,Elaine,"Fluer,
Loved your information book for guests.  Very helpful.
This is a charming cottage & we enjoyed our stay.  Thanks for calling to check with us that all was OK.
This home is conveniently located, close to Seattle downtown, & Ballard has a charm of its own, with some excellent restaurants, & a particularly good children's toy store, Clover.
Ballard Farmer's Market is great.  Much smaller than Pike Street Market, with more charm, & smaller crowds.
Due to the number of steps up to the cottage, it would not be convenient for those with disabilities."
1148517,18358478,2014-08-25,19114320,Nate,"Wow what a great place! Unfortunately we did not get to Meet Fleur as she was away for the weekend, but she made a great remote host. She was communicative from the beginning and continued to be so during our stay. 

The place was perfect for our needs. The two bedrooms were exactly what we needed for both couples on our trip and each had comfy beds. The common areas had everything we needed to unwind in-between outings (the new couch in the living room is über-comfortable) and the whole cottage had a great cozy atmosphere. It felt lived in and loved, but was still neat and clean. I particularly enjoyed the art and decorations (props for the skateboards and theater seats!) scattered throughout. Something to keep in mind is that this is actually a cottage and not a full-sized house, but as long as you don't have large group, or don't mind doubling up, it's perfect. A picture of this place should be found next to the dictionary definition of quaint :)

As for the location: Parking was really the only aspect that left more to be desired, however this was mostly due to a lot of construction in the neighborhood, and Fleur was very upfront concerning this. The cottage is located in a sweet neighborhood called Ballard about 10-15 min away from downtown, but has a bunch of stuff to do and see in its own right (which Fleur was happy to list out in her extensive info binder) and we had just as much fun exploring the surrounding area as we did the usual tourist hangouts. 

I definitely would not mind staying here again, and in all likeliness will probably seek it out on my next trip to the area. "
1148517,18880143,2014-09-02,16727569,Lisa,"We loved our stay at Fleur's place.  It was clean, well-supplied, cozy and welcoming.  Very pretty too and the location was so convenient.  Just a block to many facilities in Ballard.

The 4 of us felt that we were at our own home and our 4 days passed too quickly.  We give the cottage our highest recommendation."
1148517,19223308,2014-09-08,4482207,Yvette & James,"Our group of four enjoyed staying at Fleur's cozy home.  It is very conveniently located near bike trails, the locks,  and the community center where our training was held.  It is also a short walk from wonderful dining options which Fleur nicely outlined in her welcome book. 
We especially loved her quaint and well equipped kitchen! The cast iron skillets were a huge bonus! We loved the fresh flowers throughout her space. There was plenty of space in the refrigerator too (perfect for the daily meals we prepared).
The shower had good water pressure,  and the bedrooms were comfortable.  We appreciate having the fans as one of the rooms got hot during the night. 
Although we never met Fleur, we felt very much at home in her space. She checked in with us the day after we arrived and made herself available via phone of we needed. 

We did arrive at her home later than we had originally planned so, it was dark, parking was a bit awkward, but we were able to work things out.

We would definitely recommend Fleur's cozy cottage as a great place to stay and a very reasonable price!"
1148517,22558312,2014-11-09,13533910,Rochelle,"We really enjoyed the Ballard neighborhood.  We were able to walk to alot of restaurants, coffee places and shopping.  The house is in a nice, safe enviroment.  It has street parking, so sometimes couldnt park right in front but no problems finding a spot.  The house was nice but a little cool in the livingroom, luckily the room had a heater.  "
1148517,26621128,2015-02-16,6842575,Chrissy,We had a wonderful stay at Fleur's home. It is the perfect size for two couples and is very conveniently located. We had no issues with parking. Fleur was very responsive and provided great recommendations. We would stay there again in a heartbeat!
1148517,32428673,2015-05-17,10932495,Christie,"Fleur went out of her way to welcome us to her cute cottage on very short notice when we came to town after the birth of our grand baby. The cottage was perfect for our needs, clean, great location, and very cozy. The neighborhood was quiet, and walking distance from anything we needed. We would very much recommend this cottage, and Fleur as a gracious host."
1148517,33331717,2015-05-26,24834555,Jonas,"Staying at Fleur's place was a real pleasure for us. Located in one of the nicest areas of the city, we felt at home immediately and enjoyed our evenings in the house a lot. It is a very clean and tidy place with more than enough room for four to five people to stay in. Communication with Fleur was a bit difficult as she was not in the house and could not be contacted via phone but we were able to communicate with her upon our arrival, so that was not a big problem either.
Overall, I would definitely recommend the cottage if you are looking for a neat little place in one of the nicer and less busy areas of the city."
1148517,33640144,2015-05-30,33693213,Atle,The host canceled this reservation 38 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1148517,34498652,2015-06-08,15563271,Karen,"Upon arriving at Fleur's place, we were happy to find a clean cottage with all household items provided. The beds were very comfortable and the other rooms were just perfect for our needs. The cottage is located within walking distance to everything in Ballard. Unfortunately  we did not get to meet our host Fleur but were able to communicate as needed. This accommodation was perfect for us and we would definitely recommend this place to others. "
1148517,36023890,2015-06-24,13488316,Hannah,"Fleur was very welcoming and met me for a tour of the place before my family arrived, who would be staying at her place. The house was very clean with plenty of linens and kitchen tools. The location was wonderful because you can walk to downtown Ballard in 3 blocks!"
1148517,36568485,2015-06-29,1454901,Gerard,Fleur's home was just as described.  Our family of four was really comfortable and enjoyed all the great neighborhood of Ballard had to offer.  We hope to come back again soon.
1148517,39047452,2015-07-20,19834757,Victoria,"Great peaceful little sanctuary in Ballard. Fleur was easy, flexible and professional. Absolutely recommend!"
1148517,39958933,2015-07-27,17248656,Kelly,"We had a really lovely stay at Fleur's home in Ballard, great location for someone who wants to explore this neighborhood! Super easy check in & out! Really cozy feel, would definitely recommend!"
1148517,42854888,2015-08-16,10605750,Christine,Great location and super cute place! Fleur was a very sweet host and made us feel so welcome. 
1148517,44299505,2015-08-25,32438785,Carma,"Our family of three had a magical time staying at Fleur's place. She clearly is good at what she does.  The place is so charming and accommodating.  The neighborhood is highly walkable, and street parking was never an issue.  Thanks for providing such delightful accommodations for us, Fleur. "
1148517,44911122,2015-08-30,9842384,Alex,"Fantastic place in a fantastic neighborhood.  Great cottage within walking distance of shops, bars, restaurants, and grocery stores.  Clean & cottage with all the amenities you would need.  Would stay again in a heartbeat."
1148517,45835915,2015-09-06,41454752,Kristen,"Our group of four had a wonderful stay in Fleur's sweet little cottage in Ballard. The cottage was clean and comfortable, with everything we needed for a laid back weekend. The location was great, an easy walk to lots of good restaurants and bars. Highly recommend!"
1148517,46935236,2015-09-14,27509599,Carol,We loved staying at Fleur's house! Our beds were comfy & we love Fleur's cottage style. Everything we needed was available. Eateries and entertainment are only a couple of blocks away. Parking skills come in handy! Thanks Fleur! We enjoyed our stay.
1148517,47806143,2015-09-21,43369140,Elizabeth,Thank you for the wonderful cottage.  We loved the lcoation in Ballard and loved the homey feel of this place.  Fleur also left a book with great recommendations of places to go and see in the surrounding area!
6627403,51409312,2015-10-19,17500508,Viviana,"I was honored to be Zach's second guest! He was very flexible with my arrival as it took me longer than expected to get to his place from Port Townsend. His place is gorgeous, super comfortable, and centrally located. That night I was able to walk down the block and have dinner at 2 fantastic places (oysters at Taylor Shellfish Farms and Lebanese cuisine at Mamnoon). Starbuck's fancy flagship cafe is just down the block as well. Zach was just a text away with great recommendations for sightseeing the next day.  "
6627403,52546568,2015-10-30,47287042,Palmer,"The host was very welcoming. At the same time he was very respectful of his guests privacy. The listing is nicer than the picture, the high ceiling's don't show up well in the photo.  People unfamiliar with the location should know that it is awesome and very well served by transit and the bike share program. Rooming bathroom and Guest room. Every thing was very clean."
6627403,53306668,2015-11-07,1526430,Chris,"Zachary was great - very flexible, responsive and accomodating."
6627403,53514577,2015-11-09,13844,Gunther,"Zachary is a great host, and turned me on to some great restaurants in the area. The room was comfortable and clean, and I would stay there again if the opportunity came up.  "
6627403,54263513,2015-11-17,47420733,Sara,"This was my first experience using Airbnb, and it couldn't have gone better!  Zach was a great host even before we arrived to his place in Capitol Hill.  I messaged him the night before my flight asking if he had a hair dryer (he didn't - which was no problem at all), but then the very next morning, he messaged me saying he went out and bought one!  He gave great recommendations for restaurants, places to shop, and things to do.  As for the home itself, the pictures on Airbnb were extremely accurate, and the space was very clean.  Overall, Zach was a very welcoming, friendly, accommodating, and responsive host. I would recommend his place to a friend and stay there myself again!"
6627403,57226238,2015-12-23,3404989,Max,I stayed at Zach's for 23 nights and had a great time. His place is super clean and comfortable. The location was super convenient too. He responded very fast to all of my requests and questions and made me feel very welcome. Looking forward to staying there again!
1097520,4669480,2013-05-19,1774671,S-Ann,"Bill and I were Jeanie's first guests. We enjoyed our stay at her apartment very much. We were in close proximity to Lake Washington and all the great dining options in Colombia City were just a few minutes away. It was very easy to access downtown, Seattle from Jeanie's place. Although we drove the light rail and bus lines were in very close proximity and would have been easy to use. The apartment is very nicely decorated and the bed is super comfortable. We also appreciated the heated bathroom floors."
1097520,4720600,2013-05-21,3353206,E. Taylor,"Jeanie's garden apartment was the perfect choice for a relaxing stay  in Seattle! She made us feel completely at home, with plenty of privacy and every amenity I could imagine needing. Her home is beautiful and well-located, and waking up each morning to a blossoming garden was lovely. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat -- and you should too!"
1097520,6581918,2013-08-18,6151300,Jeffrey,"I stayed at Jeanie's apartment for the Summer while I was in Seattle on an internship and had a great experience. The apartment itself was exactly as described and was quite comfortable. The location is great with local restaurants and bars easily accessible at Columbia City and downtown accessible by either the bus or light-rail. Beyond the apartment Jeanie was a very gracious host who is very welcoming, friendly, and extremely knowledgable on fun things to do in the area. I highly recommend this apartment for anyone looking for a short or long term stay."
1097520,6705696,2013-08-22,6306743,Peter,"The apartment is inviting, extremely comfortable and tastefully, yet playfully decorated. It is also spacious. It is located in a beautiful residential area not far from Lake Washington and a lovely park.
Jeanie was away when I stayed there, but her friends, Mia and Robert, were extremely accommodating and helpful. Jeanie was also helpful via email in advance of my email. I would gladly stay there again."
1097520,6958830,2013-09-01,2476366,Stacie & Tim,"    Stop!  If you are looking for a place with personality and where you can visit with a local and get advice, book Jeanie’s place today!  
    We had a fabulous experience during our recent week-long visit to Seattle.  Jeanie’s designer touches in the apartment and the shared areas made our accommodations unique and exemplified the creative “Seattle Experience”. 
The location was the perfect home-base for our many adventures to various parts of the city via light rail, bus and water taxi.  If you are OK with 10 to 15 minute walks in a hilly area, we highly recommend this apartment without a car.  
    Don’t miss the chance to stroll through the community of Mt Baker, around the shores of Lake Washington and through quaint nearby Columbia City.   Go ahead and take the long way home through the surrounding neighborhood, because Jeanie’s gardens and the hot tub await you and are welcoming and relaxing after a long day of exploring.  
    Jeanie was a fun hostess, she made sure that we were pleased with our stay, she had fantastic recommendations based on our desires and we really enjoyed getting to know her.  Jeanie was very easy to reach via text or phone on the few occasions where we needed advice or something we forgot to pack and we had a great mix of quiet and privacy.  
    This was a much better choice for us than a hotel, we bet it will be for you also!

1097520,7039595,2013-09-04,6396499,Justin,"Jeanie is awesome and her place is incredibly charming!  From the minute my wife and I arrived, she made us feel right at home and provided everything we needed for a great stay just outside of Seattle.  

With the light rail station a reasonable 15 minute walk, Jeanie's place is a great spot to stay when visiting Seattle.  Everything is really nice in the suite, including the beautifully custom remodeled bathroom.  

My wife and I got to know Jeanie a bit, and really saw the care she put into outfitting the space.  She also left us to our own exploring devices, but was readily accessible when needed.    

An excellent stay and one I'd love to repeat again in the future.  Highly recommended!"
1097520,7177577,2013-09-09,2649612,Bryce,"Jeanie's studio is a great place to stay.A decorator's professional touch is evident throughout. The bath is wonderful, the bed comfortable, and their lots of good seating to relax. If you want to bring in food, the efficiency kitchen has thoughtful equipment to make it possible to prepare something simple or warm up. Use of the grill outside was offered as well, and if you're there when it's warm enough to be outside, take the opportunity to enjoy the lovely garden.
Best to come with a car as it's a fair walk to rapid transit or amenities like cafes, but you are downtown in a couple spots, and fares are very reasonable. The local line also takes you directly to the airport if you want to arrive or depart that way. It's a short cab ride from there to the apartment. There are several buses available within a short walk.
The area is a lovely residential location in a well kept neighbourhood of Craftsman houses. Lots of trees & green spaces. It's worth planning a day to explore the lake trail and parks a short distance away.
A great, restful retreat to plan with or without an urban experience. Highly recommended.
"
1097520,7283379,2013-09-14,8442100,Debbie,"A very nice, clean and elegant basement ""apartment"".  Large bathroom and having the microwave, sink, under counter fridge and counter space was nice.  The neighborhood is very pleasant with quaint and beautifully maintained Craftsman and Queen Anne homes and quiet walking streets.  Highly recommended."
1097520,7373943,2013-09-17,7097573,Amy,"Jeanie's place is one of the most relaxing homes Ive ever stayed in!  My husband and I were in town for a wedding and wanted a different experience; away from the hustle and bustle of the city, and that's exactly what we got.  The neighborhood is quaint, quiet, and so incredibly relaxing.  We enjoyed several runs along Lake Washington (the absolute HIGHLIGHT of our trip...if you can run or walk all the way to Seward Park, I highly recommend it!)
We rented a car, and definitely liked doing so.  The neighborhood is VERY hilly (we're midwesterners) so walking to the bus stop would have been a slight challenge.  
If we make it back to Seattle, you can bet we will stay at Jeanie's again. THANK YOU JEANIE for a truly relaxing weekend full of R and  R!
Amy & Tony"
1097520,7618061,2013-09-27,5806272,Pam,"Classy lodgings in a great neighborhood. The apartment had every amenity I needed and was a restful space. Jeanie was very welcoming, and a gracious hostess, plus she was fun and interesting to visit with. I recommend ""Relaxed Sophistication""!"
1097520,7764111,2013-10-01,3635722,Craig,"Very exquisitely done apartment.  The backyard with hot tub was private and delightful in a big wind and rain storm.  Bathroom, bed, fireplace, paint, furnishings... all very tasteful and clean.  The neighborhood is nice and two blocks off the lake.  We'll certainly be back."
1097520,7907475,2013-10-07,5303291,Edward,"Fantastic space in a peaceful neighborhood. 
Found this place last minute and it worked out perfectly. Jeanie was  quick in responding and very helpful to set us up. The apartment was very luxurious and cozy and well stocked.The neighborhood is accessible to lk washington for runs and walks along lake. "
1097520,8360852,2013-10-27,5659518,Lisa,"Jeanie has a beautiful home in a quiet Seattle neighborhood. She provides amazing hospitality and great info about local food and venues. Accommodations were exceptional and we both LOVED the heated bathroom floor. I hope we make it back soon. Jeanie, thank you SO much!!!"
1097520,8692184,2013-11-12,1548597,Corey/Jessica,"Jeanie's apartment is one of the nicest airbnb spots I've been to. Everything was top notch: The bathroom, the sheets, the environment and location. 

On top of the first class amenities, Jeanie was an awesome host. She made us feel comfortable and was very friendly about anything that came up that we needed. 

The location is right by the Lake and it is a really beautiful neighborhood. I highly recommend it for a single traveler or a couple. My wife and I had a great time. "
1097520,9445289,2013-12-29,676486,Elizabeth,"We had a fantastic experience at Jeanie's house. Beautiful, peaceful, and incredibly well decorated.  The fire place was my favorite part.  I will definitely be back! Plus, Car-2-Go is in the neighborhood too. Gotta love it. Lovely house, wonderful host."
1097520,9575822,2014-01-02,4577500,Chad,"Fantastic, tastefully decorated, comfortable pad ... felt super warm, cozy, and dry, despite the mid-winter, soggy Seattle gloom outside (don't get me wrong ... I love it). Jeanie made sure that all of our needs were attended to, including breakfast items (yogurt, milk, etc.). Induction stovetop and microwave were thoughtful and handy additions, especially after a long day on the road, when a trip out to yet another restaurant felt like just a little too much to bear. Neighborhood is awesome, with easy access to parks (and great restaurants, when you're feeling up to it!)."
1097520,10167082,2014-02-03,11696666,Mike,"This was our first time with AirBNB so we did not know what to expect and were somewhat nervous. 

Host: Amazing. It was like we were staying with family. 

Space: The pictures, description and reviews all looked great so we had high expectations. The space exceeded our expectations in every way. A few specifics: 

Location - quiet and convenient, especially if you are coming from SeaTac and plan on going into downtown Seattle

Cleanliness - Cleanest place I have ever stayed - home or hotel

Decor - So comfortable yet elegant. The bathroom was off the charts. Very tempted to sleep on the heated floor

Fireplace - Amazing

Overall - We have accumulated over 1000 room nights with Marriott hotels over the past seven years, many at 4 & 5 star properties. We would choose Jeanie's property again over any hotel anywhere. We looked at over a dozen properties before choosing hers. Besides being one of most affordable, it was by far the best choice. We are already planning our next escape to Seattle. "
1097520,10384290,2014-02-17,11077274,Judy,"We loved this facility.  It is a place one could easily stay a month or longer and still be comfortable.  Loved the bed and  the heated bathroom floors.  Jeanie
has thought of everything for your comfort.  The security  system made us feel our things were safe left in the room.  What a terrific location for a house.  We saw Mt.  Baker from Jeanie's porch the first day we arrived.  Hope this place is available the next time we come to Columbia City."
1097520,11015756,2014-03-17,11428372,Sayre,"My parents stayed with Jeanie for a week and absolutely loved it! This place is really special. Jeanie's an interior designer and you can tell--beautiful, fun details like cool tile work in the shower and an amazing coffee table that quickly morphs into a much bigger, taller dining table. It's not only beautiful, but very well configured to be SUPER comfortable and efficient. I could easily imagine staying here for weeks. 

My parents's main concern was the bed--they're older and needed a particularly comfortable one--not too hard, not too soft. They found this one to be ""perfect"", which amazed me since, like I said... they're particular.

Anyway, I can't say enough about this place. Jeanie is very available without being present. The place is private, elegant, comfortable and within walking distance of the lake and of one of my favorite parks in Seattle. It's a beautiful neighborhood and I wish I could move right in!"
1097520,11269227,2014-03-27,13047559,Michael,"This was my first time using Airbnb, and if first impressions are anything, Jeanie really left a positive one!  We arrived in the late afternoon after a cross-country flight to the best reception possible: the room where we stayed (actually, more like an apartment in and of itself) was immaculately clean and wonderfully accented.  The pictures were absolutely accurate, which was a surprise because I wouldn't have imagined such a nice apartment.  Everything was exactly as described and very inviting.  We had a wonderful stay and Jeanie was an impeccable host.  The apartment was close to a major bus line, which runs to the city center in about 20 minutes.  There were also many nice restaurants nearby.  The only thing I regret is that we couldn't stay longer!"
1097520,11765484,2014-04-14,6243013,Dale,"Jeanie was really friendly and had a nice place. Very clean, incredibly comfortable bed and definitely well-designed space. Just be sure to understand the apartment is inside of her house and not a separate entry. All in all really enjoyed my stay. :)"
1097520,12283395,2014-04-28,4500867,Denise,"We thought this apartment was great.  Lots of natural lighting, very comfortable bed, plenty of closet space and very, very clean.  Jeanie has furnished this with great care and very good taste.  The bathroom was beautiful!  The site was convenient to Columbia City.  Jeanie was a very attentive host, and breakfast items would magically appear on the stairs!  Access to a washer and dryer was very convenient for us.  We are looking forward to staying here again."
1097520,13046690,2014-05-18,13183001,Lisa,"This was my very first experience with Airbnb and I was impressed. First, Jeanie (host) was quick to respond to my questions and her southern charm captivated me instantly! Second, we arrived to her home and was greeted warmly, and shown around her beautiful home and felt immediately welcome. Third, our place was clean, well appointed and as beautiful as in the pictures. Actually, it exceeded our expectations with morning bagels, fresh juice, blooming flowers and elegant high-thread count cotton sheets that had us sleeping like queens! I especially loved the tiny details that brought Jeanie's personality into the space, utilizing her skills as a talented interior decorator.  My adult daughter and I spent four blissful days at Jeanie's and found it difficult to leave. All in all, this was a lovely place to stay in Seattle with a delightful host! I highly recommend staying at Jeanie's to anyone! We will be planning a return visit ourselves!!"
1097520,13358835,2014-05-26,4312807,Isaac,We had a wonderful time staying with Jeanie. She was most accommodating and she has a very lovely and extremely well decorated apartment. we love it. Right down to her suggestions for local restaurants. Thanks Jeanie! 
1097520,14101239,2014-06-11,15099078,Ernest,"It's really a lovely place to stay, well-kept and cultivated like on the pictures. We appreciated the breakfest as surprise every morning. Parking the car on the street no problem. Very call  and within 15 minutes you can reach Downtown or Washington University.
Jeanie was very friendly and helpful. We would again choose sophisticated Mt. Baker as place to stay in Seattle. Thank you very much."
1097520,14174692,2014-06-13,1226066,Matthew,"I was in Seattle for work and downtown was sold out, so I was delighted to find Jeanie through Airbnb.  Jeanie was a truly fantastic host.  She made me feel totally at ease in her home, even making me some homemade bruschetta for dinner :) Jeanie’s place is immaculate and spacious (designed by Jeanie herself!)  It was great to meet Jeanie and I hope to return soon! "
1097520,14432751,2014-06-19,14810573,David,"Jeanie was a very welcoming host and this worked out extremely well as a place for my visiting parents. It's a single space, beautifully done with a really nice view into Jeanie's lovely garden and beyond. The bed, sofa, table and other furnishings are very comfortable and elegant. There's a well organized little kitchenette to use (microwave, hot plate, toaster oven) and we were welcomed with fresh fruit and other tasty tidbits. Wifi worked well. For my dad, who can't walk many steps, this worked out really well and was accessible on a single level. The open shower was really helpful and great. It's an easy walk to the lake or drive elsewhere.  I'd definitely recommend it to others! Thanks Jeanie!"
1097520,14616448,2014-06-23,14448771,Lindsey,"This was our first experience with airbnb and it was fantastic!  Jeanie's place is exactly as pictured.  It is clean, comfortable and beautifully appointed.  Jeanie is a great host as well.  She greeted us with a tour of the apartment and great suggestions for wonderful places near by.  We had a rental car and the location was fantastic.  We visited Lake Washington, downtown and Capitol Hill with ease as well as took a quick drive to Chateau St. Michelle.  We will absolutely stay here again.  "
1097520,14912678,2014-06-29,15157754,John,"Jeanie was a wonderful host.  I usually don't like BnBs because of the intrusiveness of the hosts, but Jeanie helped when asked and respected boundaries.  The apartment was exactly as described - even better.  Plus the neighborhood was perfect for a morning run by the lake and for access to both downtown and the University district (a car really helps with this).  

The apartment was very clean and beautifully decorated.  The sound proofing that Jeanie did makes it so that you don't know anyone is upstairs.  The fireplace is a very welcome touch that takes the edge off of damp Seattle days.  

There is a 24 hour grocery (QFC) right near by, and right near by is a lovely restaurant row.  "
1097520,15069829,2014-07-01,16830697,Dennell,"Beautiful and safe neighborhood, incredibly geniune and caring host, and phenomenal apartment! If you have the opportunity to stay at Relaxed sophistication in Mt. Baker I highly recommend you sieze it!

Jeanie was so accomidating and flexible with check-in/check-out times, and was so helpful in suggesting places to visit in Seattle. The light-rail is only a short-walk away which provided quick and easy transportation right downtown. 

This was my first experience with Airbnb and I couldn't have imagined a better stay. Thank you so so much Jeanie! Hope to visit again!"
1097520,15749221,2014-07-15,12987233,Greg,We stayed here for our honeymoon and had a great time! It is a lovely little downstairs apartment and Jeanie is very nice and takes great care of her guests. It is close to the light rail to where you can walk to the station or take a quick car ride to the parking lot. Seattle is a beautiful place to visit with a perfect balance of the city and nature. This place is also walking distance from parks that border Lake Washington! Definitely recommend staying there.
1097520,15879681,2014-07-17,896716,Chris,Jeanie was a wonderful host and her downstairs apartment was peaceful and very comfortable. Many small touches were much appreciated.
1097520,16214519,2014-07-23,17083904,Sydney,"My boyfriend and I stayed with Jeanie this past weekend and she was wonderful. Very nice place, highly secured. Many amenities including heated floors, a hot tub,  t.v.,  and mini kitchen made the stay all the better. Her neighborhood was nice, but if you have to go downtown by bus or train you have to go through some sketchy neighbourhoods to get there. Overall, an enjoyable stay, but just a little bit too far from downtown Seattle for my taste. (A hour bus commute) "
1097520,16553064,2014-07-29,15943009,Liz,"     I absolutely adored “Relaxed sophistication in Mount Baker”.    The house is in a wonderful residential neighborhood with plenty of street parking.  The space is as pictured and as described with beautiful decorations, sumptuous linens, luxuriant landscaping.   The weather cooperated enough to let us catch views of Mount Baker and Mount Rainier as well as of Lake Washington.  Although we had both cold/rainy and also delightful summery weather during our six night July visit, the apartment remained comfortable throughout.  Frankly, my husband and I were so contented that some days we could hardly muster out to sightsee.  Our host Jeanne was incredibly accommodating, energetic, gracious, and open.  We were made to feel more like visiting friends than like customers.  This was our first airbnb experience and it was outstanding.  "
1097520,16844744,2014-08-03,17248324,Kim,"My mother and I where in town to visit my  brother who lives near by and we needed a place to stay...boy what a place!   The pictures are spot on, and after many long days out having fun it was great to come back to and relax.  Jeanie was flexible on our check in time. We were on the run so much our interactions with Jeanie were few but great.  This was our first experiance with airbnb...we'd do it all again."
1097520,17264015,2014-08-10,9726615,Barbara,"Just got home from a wonderful vacation in Seattle Washington and our first experience with Airbnb.  I have to say it was fantastic!  Our host was perfect!  Her place was perfect!  Very well appointed and comfortable!!  Jeanie was concerned that we had everything we needed.  She even stocked our fridge with milk, OJ, bread and butter.  She also offered to go shopping for groceries for breakfast!  If you decide to stay with Jeanie you will be very well taken care of!  Thank you so much Jeanie!  We will most definitely be coming back!"
1097520,17511822,2014-08-13,58602,Julia,very nice place.  a few things that went wrong were probably circumstantial.
1097520,17883443,2014-08-18,3978397,Thomas,"Jeanie's apartment was a great place to stay for our long weekend visit to Seattle. Quick and easy 15 minute drive into the city center. Loved the restaurants and shops in nearby Columbia City, as well as the views of Lake Washington and parks nearby. Jeanie was very friendly and helpful, the apartment was very clean and well decorated – she also has a beautiful garden. "
1097520,18135399,2014-08-22,5805253,Fay,"I enjoyed my stay at Jeanie's place. The place is as pictured and described and the neighborhood is nice. Jeanie is a great host. She has best taste in decoration, and is very warmhearted and helpful.  Jeanie's beautiful decoration and garden are very impressive. 

The location is good. There is a bus going to downtown nearby, as well as a shopping center. It's only several minutes walk, but if you carry too many things coming back from the bus stop it may take efforts to walk up slope. The route to light rail station is through a beautiful neighborhood with view of lake, and there is a great pizzeria serving nice pizza and breakfast on that route.   There is also a nice park nearby, beside the lake.  

Jeanie's place is really comfortable and convenient. Everything needed is available. I had wonderful experience with Jeanie. I hope to stay at Jeanie's place when I come to Seattle next time. 
"
1097520,18418312,2014-08-26,9968065,Samuel,"Awesome location, clean and bright and very comfortable. Close to everything. Jeanie was a warm host and we had a great experience there, would definitely do it again!"
1097520,18790656,2014-09-01,16398698,Gene,The listing was completely accurate and Jeanie was welcoming and helpful. We were very busy for the 5 days we were there and definitely would consider going back there. She provided a starter food pack and invited us to pick from her garden. Good location and well outfitted.
1097520,19090168,2014-09-06,5286986,Kenny,"Jeanie's apartment has everything you need to enjoy your stay in Seattle. The entire place is nicely decorated, and lies within a very beautiful environment. Jeany herself is always ready to answer your questions and she is very nice to talk to."
1097520,19331374,2014-09-10,19121789,Jacqueline,Relaxed sophistication accurately described this wonderful apartment and experience. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We were pleasantly surprised by how beautiful the place looked which was just like the photographs. Our host was a delight! Very friendly and accommodating. We had everything we needed and she supplied us with a map of the lake and local eateries. We couldn't have asked for a better experience. We just felt completely at peace there. The bed was also super comfortable and the bathroom was gorgeous. Definitely a great getaway for my boyfriend and I. We can't wait to visit again! Not a single complaint. It was all wonderful. It was our first trip to Seattle and our first time using airbnb. If you are even considering it....Go for it! The location worked out perfect for us. By car it was just a short ride to downtown Seattle and the light rail is very convenient to go directly to the airport. We would love to stay with her again. 
1097520,19467648,2014-09-13,14383826,Britney,We just did a 2 week trip on the west coast and air bnb'd the whole way. Jeanie's place was by far our favorite. It was super private and amazingly decorated. Everything you would ever need. Jeanie is also very sweet and accommodating. She gave us tons of recommendations on where to go and what to do and they were all great. She even made us an impromptu breakfast. Definitely stay here! 
1097520,19740711,2014-09-17,20376571,Jenni,We loved our relaxed sophistication staying in Jeanie's apartment!  Everything looked even better than in the pictures if you can believe it.  She was very welcoming and provided us with an extremely comfortable stay for the remainder of our trip in Seattle. 
1097520,19853072,2014-09-19,21109695,Ronda,"As first time Airbnb users we were a little nervous about how the experience would turn out. But thanks to Jeanie and her beautiful suite, we have nothing but positive thoughts to take away.
Jeanie was very warm and accommodating. She had great recommendations for places to visit. (But more importantly, great places to eat!). 
The suite is even more beautiful than the photos!
Thanks, Jeanie!!!"
1097520,20018446,2014-09-22,19534654,Meg,"This was our first experience with airbnb and it was a great one.  The apartment was beautiful, very private and sparkling clean.  We only met Jeanie once but she was very welcoming and made us feel comfortable from the start.  The neighborhood was quiet and close to downtown.  Overall an A+ experience."
1097520,20195823,2014-09-25,698860,Jovan,Jeanie was a wonderful host and her apartment was quite cozy and comfortable. It is located in a beautiful neighborhood that is a very short distance away from the city center. It offered everything I expected ^_^
1097520,20660298,2014-10-03,1499027,James,"This apartment is fantastic. Jeanie is the consummate host and really goes the extra mile to ensure her guests are comfortable. The Mt Baker/Lakewood neighborhood of Seattle is quaint, quite, safe and charming. The property is a few short blocks from Lake Washington and Columbia City. Access to the airport, downtown Seattle and the Eastside (Bellevue/Kirkland via I-90) is ideal. The light rail in Mt Baker and Columbia City is not very far away either. I was visiting on business for the entire week and honestly I don't really want to leave. If Jeanie's stylish and amenity filled apartment is available for your next trip I'd highly recommend snatching it up. Thanks Jeanie! Hope to be back next month if it's available"
1097520,21306174,2014-10-14,21762847,Moyra,"This was a different Airbnb experience for us since we never met our host. She had warned us when booking that she was going to be away for a wedding and ensured we were ok with that. We agreed.

However, she was welcoming using text messages and responded quickly to our one question, and we had everything we needed to get into the house.

The apartment is as advertised and perhaps even nicer than the pictures. The quality of the finishing is impressive, especially the bathroom. It is kind of a lower level (house is built on a hill) but you would not know it since the light is great. The apartment is well equipped, the refrigerator is of good size and she'd stocked it nicely to permit us coffee the first morning, and everything but one blind worked fine (though we chose not to try the gas fireplace without her being there, for fear of having problems - she'd left instructions but we would have liked a demonstration of the pilot light lighting).

The good: The bed is very comfortable, the shower wonderful, she has a good collection of CDs of local artists and she included some very good information on restaurants and music venues with a map. There is also a hot tub but we did not try it (the weather in the evenings was not nice enough to try and again, because she wasn't there, we were not quite sure where it was - I'm sure she would have walked us through it by text, had we asked). There was a security system that made us feel safe.

The not so good: Cooking a meal can be a challenge. There is a microwave and a toaster oven which suffice nicely for warming things but there is only a one ring induction stove, small pots and no venting. So the one meal I made had to be done in 3 stages and on low temperatures to avoid too much smoke.

There was also one blind that could not be opened and the system of closing blinds higher than the sensor was a bit finicky. 

The 'it depends': The location is great in that it is in a nice neighborhood, great for walking,  quite close to the intersection of highways I5 and I90 and not far from large streets Rainier, and Martin Luther King Jr. However, if you do not have a car and are not physically able to walk to the light rail (a few blocks and some large hills), using the local buses located close by might mean long commutes.

There was no bathtub which might be an issue if staying longer.

Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would stay again. We would want her there though to fully enjoy the fireplace and hot tub.

1097520,21538397,2014-10-19,14554407,Sandra,"The studio is more beautiful than the pictures.  It has the feel of a luxury boutique hotel mixed with a modern bed and breakfast.  The attention to details (toiletries, lux towels and sheets), combined with sophisticated decor (mid century meets Hollywood regency), was perfect.  The space was spotless and beautifully maintained. We loved having a full closet to keep everything organized, and the heated bathroom floor and fireplace were just what this southern cal girl needed to keep warm.  I fell in love with the unique bathroom and appreciated the combination of artistic vision and functionality.  The windows in the studio provided great light while also being private.  We look forward to returning.  "
1097520,22698025,2014-11-12,11077274,Judy,"The host,  Jeanie made us feel very welcome with the lovely aesthetic surroundings.  The place was spotlessly clean,  and there was food in the refrigerator,  enough to get us through several mornings of breakfast.
Such a generous touch."
1097520,22854004,2014-11-16,23044362,Elena,"Staying at Relaxed Sophistication was a lovely first Airbnb experience for my husband and I. We were looking for a comfortable, cozier stay than that of a hotel for our 10 year anniversary. This was it! Complete with fireplace and heated floors in the bathroom. Jeanie also let us see her killer view from her balcony! This place is in a great neighborhood close to yummy restaurants and delicious coffee and only a 10-15 minute drive to downtown Seattle. Jeanie was a great host that gave us our privacy but was still available if we needed her. Defiantly recommend this listing! "
1097520,22880104,2014-11-16,23786947,Susanne,The reservation was canceled 11 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1097520,24119093,2014-12-20,24581738,Connie,"Jeanie is an amazing host...she made us feel right at home.  Any questions we had from where to eat, shop or just hang out she answered.  Her home is beautiful and the room/efficiency we rented was incredibly beautiful, warm, inviting and comfortable.  The view from the windows is breathtaking.
The only drawback for us was transportation, public transportation was just a little too far for us to hike 2 to 3 times per day.  We used Uber for a couple of days then switched to a rental car. 
We are counting the days until we can come back.  We hope you love Jeanies place as much as we did."
1097520,25321572,2015-01-12,11766214,Christine,"Honestly I have nothing but big praise for my experience at Jeanie's beautiful home. The accommodation was spotless, chic and quiet. A perfect blend of well-considered interior with windows looking out to gardens and greenery. The space is truly beautiful. But the best part by far was Jeanie. She is an incredible woman and a fabulous host. I was 150% happy with my time spent. ❤️ "
1097520,26540641,2015-02-15,13227847,Katherine,"My fiance and I spent Valentine's Day weekend in Seattle, and this listing was absolutely perfect for our needs. Situated just south of Seattle, it is incredibly easy to get around town, as the unit is located just a few blocks away from Rainier Ave.

Jeanie was a gracious host, who communicated with us quickly and easily, mostly via text. She provided us with clear, detailed instructions on how to find the unit, get in, and regarding many of the features of the apartment. The decor in the apartment is delightful, and the unit is very clean. The neighborhood felt very safe, and was quiet, which made sleeping easy."
1097520,27923133,2015-03-15,15142561,Matteaccio,"Very nice location, the suite is cozy, very comfortable couch, with fireplace. The bed is huge and soft and the bathroom is so clean and provided with heated floor. "
1097520,28358067,2015-03-22,21766389,Sunny,"Jeanie was very accommodating and had a very clean and private place.
Will definitely recommend her place to others as it is exactly as what she's listed in her listing. "
1097520,28481629,2015-03-24,6741749,Cullen,"Jeanie was a magnificent host. She was very warm and welcoming and gave us a wonderful description of the neighborhood and places to check out. The home itself was very clean, comfortable, and cozy. In fact, it was often hard to leave the warmth of the fireplace and the heated floors in the bathroom. The neighborhood was also quite charming, offering a very short walk to beautiful strolls along the lake, while also being close enough to downtown or any other destinations we were hoping to check out. All in all, I had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend this home and Jeanie as a host. "
1097520,28719798,2015-03-29,28214971,Alanna,"This was a great first Airbnb experience for my husband and me. The apartment is comfortable, quiet, and in a great location and lovely neighborhood.
We enjoyed little things like the heated floor in the bathroom, the speaker for our ipod, plentiful light in the windows (okay, it was actually quite sunny during our stay…), the coffee she provided, the comfy bed and sheets, the many dimmable light fixtures to suit any mood. 
Jeanie was a fun hostess, giving excellent tips for things to do around town and in nearby Olympic National Park. She was very available via text throughout our stay and was flexible with us since our initial arrival was fairly late in the evening.
Thanks for a great stay, Jeanie! We’d definitely stay here again."
1097520,29471660,2015-04-07,24270679,Melissa,"Staying with Jeanie in her home was the best decision we could have made. Jeanie was very accommodating. She even left us orange juice, coffee and granola/yogurt in the fridge. : ) The apartment was private and comfortable. It had everything we could have needed. In some air bnb's I've stayed in before we needed to concider even the tiniest conveniences of home: Do I have a cork screw to open this bottle of wine? Do I need to go buy toilet paper? How do I brew this coffee? These are thoughts I never had in Jeanies apartment. That made the stay so much more pleasant.
 Jeanie herself was helpful and kind. We only ran into her a few times and anytime we had questions she was available with answers and advice.
 Her neighborhood is BEAUTIFUL! we spent a few hours walking around the neighborhood enjoying it's beauty as well as making the quick walk down to the lake and taking in the amazing views. We rented a car for our trip which made touring around VERY easy. Jeanie is just a quick trek to downtown and all the cool neighborhoods Seattle has to offer. It was such a treat to spend the days in the city and then return to the beautiful charm that is Jeanies neighborhood. I highly recommend staying here. My fiancé and I will definitely be back! Thanks Jeanie!"
1097520,30593367,2015-04-24,6475379,Joncien,"Jeanie was great.  I wasn't clear on how to enter the unit, but this was addressed quickly.  The accommodations are lovely.  We booked this on short notice when our home closing was delayed and Jeanie was very considerate.  The space was an amazing retro modern mix I really enjoyed.  Did you see that shower?  The fireplace?  The neighborhood, if you don't take a causal walk through the neighborhood and down by the lake you are really missing the full experience.  The neighborhood is as lovely as the accommodations.  Did I mention the breakfast basket that was left outside our door?   Another wonderful Airbnb stay."
1097520,31593205,2015-05-07,31042195,David,"wonderful apartment in a great location. We did not have a car for the majority of our stay as we were in a city, but the public transport links to this lovely neighbourhood were fine. Short walk in the morning to Lake Washington and a good 20 minutes from the light rail link or bus at night - good for walking off dinner, or $20 taxi from downtown. "
1097520,32852504,2015-05-22,33134426,Austin,"Jeanie was a great host! If you are going to the Seattle area, this is the place you want to be. Great neighborhood with beautiful parks all around. This was my first time using Airbnb and I would recommend all travelers to check it out."
1097520,33281813,2015-05-26,32067829,Timothy,"This was our first experience with airbnb, and it was a very pleasant one.  The accommodations were just as nice as advertised.  The rooms were very clean, the neighborhood was very quiet and the overall experience was very comfortable.  Jeanie was there to meet us upon our arrival and also the evening before we left.  She is very friendly and made us feel right at home.  Our privacy was respected.  I would certainly stay here again and would recommend this place to anyone staying near the Columbia City area of Seattle."
1097520,34177169,2015-06-05,3634087,Jane,I am so thankful to Jeanie for hosting my husband and I on incredibly short notice. We booked her place the night before and showed up the following evening. Jeanie greeted us and gave us a tour of the suite and what a great suite it was. Spacious and very well decorated (fresh flowers from her yard) with great attention to detail and fabulous amenities- the heated floors in the bathroom is a real winner. The suite was clean and comfortable and provided plenty of natural light. I would gladly stay at Jeanie's again and would not hesitate to recommend her place to my friends and family. 
1097520,34627618,2015-06-10,29826589,Jared,"Jeanie met us at the door, and showed us around her very comfortable apartment. It was exactly what we needed in a location that suited our needs to a  T. Her flower gardens are gorgeous, and we only wished we'd had time to take advantage of the offer of the gated yard with more beautiful plantings.

The open floorplan seems bigger than it actually is and left us with plenty of space to chill out with a coffee or a beer. The place was spotless and tidy, and well appointed for a studio apt. The bathroom has a great shower, large sink, and a toilet stall nicely separated on its own. Great design!

Despite the ridiculously high temps in Seattle, the apartment remained cool and comfortable. I imagine it would be similarly temperate in cooler times. 

The (secondary) garage entrance meant I could bring my bike into the garage without having to navigate the stairs - making my early AM rides and returns a non-issue for my wife. 

The apartment is a pleasant walking or very short biking distance from Columbia City, a trendy, but not tony, neighborhood replete with excellent dining options including the Columbia City Bakery, with a knockout apricot walnut bread. 

For our needs, ""Relaxed Sophistication"" was a perfect find. I recommend it without hesitation. "
1097520,34973971,2015-06-14,27247099,Rheadawn,"Jeannie was exceptionally accommodating. We arrived at a time convenient for us and she was very welcoming. She brought us down fresh fruit and amazing orange juice, had coffee set up for us, and had a very, very artistically tasteful, beautiful home. I honestly felt like a princess. The following morning she let us help ourselves to the hot tub and some fresh eggs and veggies for breakfast to cook in a cooks dream kitchen! You'd be lucky to catch her while she is at home during your stay! The only potential setback was that the place is not exactly detached or what you might think of for an ""entire home"", as it was in the basement portion of the house. We didn't mind being cautious of our noise and timely night time arrival, but it did feel a bit conservative in vibe! We're a silly couple who loves to laugh and enjoy our vacation time, without the extra 'people ' around precautions, after all. Either way, this place is definitely ideal if you want an amazing host, beautiful place, and quick access to an amazing bay. I would definitely stay here again!"
1097520,35455373,2015-06-19,15269041,Johanna,"Jeanie welcomed us to her wonderful home in the diverse neighborhood situated between Mount Baker and Columbia City. She made us feel right at home and offered us suggestions for nice walks, places to eat, and directions to the light rail stations nearby. We felt entirely safe walking around, even at night. The apartment was exactly as pictured- filled with artwork and charm! The bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet and private. Jeanie provided us with coffee, fruit, and yogurt in the morning. She was the perfect hostess. We will definitely recommend her place to our friends and family!"
1097520,36162526,2015-06-25,5147575,Katie,The host canceled this reservation 49 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1097520,36440129,2015-06-28,5254648,Lyndsay,"Though we didn't get a chance to meet Jeanie, she was a very accommodating host via text whenever we needed anything. The apartment is beautiful! Really tastefully decorated, and more than comfortable. An awesome bed, big bathroom with lovely shower, great kitchen for cooking meals, and a comfy couch for hanging. We were out and about for most of the day and coming back to Mt. Baker was a lovely place to relax. Highly recommended."
1097520,37130400,2015-07-05,15464229,Fran,"Jeanie is a wonderful considerate host.  This lower level apartment is exactly as pictured and described - relaxed and sophisticated.  Bed linens and towels are fresh and luxurious.  Bath is large, good lighting, good supply of towels, large shower, plenty of counter space and light-filled.  Living room area is large with comfortable furniture.  The whole space is decorated professionally with style and comfort in (website hidden). Baker is a lovely neighborhood for walking with friendly diverse neighbors.
My stay was during one of the hottest weeks in Seattle but I was very comfortable in this apartment without A/C."
1097520,38272252,2015-07-14,8655022,Natalie,Jeanie was able to meet us after we arrived in the area. She was wonderful! Fresh flowers on the table upon arrival. She was very helpful with local tips and even included a map to grocery stores and restaurants. The neighborhood was also lovely and close to the lake.
1097520,38822460,2015-07-19,29867984,Cindy,"Jeanie was an excellent host. If we needed anything we forgot, she had a room full of supplies to help out. (She gave us some sunscreen.) The apartment was beautiful, clean and spacious for two. There was fun artwork in and out of the apartment. The lake was a five minute walk and was just lovely for runs and walks and the neighborhood was charming and interesting. We were busy and gone most of the time but we loved the place when we were there. I would highly recommend it. "
1097520,39603689,2015-07-25,30110111,Sherry,"We very much enjoyed our stay at Relaxed Sophistication. Our host was very welcoming. She even offered to pick us up at the light rail! The apartment is comfortable and decorated beautifully. The neighborhood is quiet and has plenty of parking if you have a car. If you chose to use public transportation, the station is a beautiful 20 minute walk north through a nice neighborhood which gives you easy access to downtown.  A 20 minute walk south takes you to Columbia City with another rail station and many excellent restaurants.  Our host had maps and recommendations for activities and restaurants. Lake Washington is a five minute walk to the east with a great walking/biking trail. We loved the location and ambiance of this place and would visit again."
1097520,40321767,2015-07-30,5843223,Sandro,"Jeanie was an amazing host! She welcomed us in fron of her house (with an overwhelming garden) and showed us, where we would stay. The small flat was very modern an comfortable. All the furniture matched perfectly together and we felt home right away. In the fridge were some fresh yogurt and OJ, some granola and cold water. We enjoyed every minute we could spend in the flat and it was really hard to leave. 
Thanks again to Jeanie for making Seattle our favorite experience on our tour up the west coast."
1097520,41209853,2015-08-05,7002835,Jason,"Jeanie, was a excellent host, she gave us great suggestions on spots in the area. I recommend the property to anyone visiting. "
1097520,41743813,2015-08-09,31583583,Andrew,"Jeannie is a great host and her apartment is an excellent place to stay, exactly as described.  She provided a map, directions to the train into the city, advice on local restaurants (including a veggie) and a recommended local walk.  The well stocked fridge was a welcome bonus."
1097520,43783787,2015-08-22,32379986,Adriana,"Jeanie received us very joyfully! She was very nice and made the whole process very comfortable and easy. She even offered and s her own space upstairs! The place was exactly as described in the listing. It is very private, and beautiful. It was extremely clean, which for me is a huge deal. She had everything you needed in the place- towels, toiletries, all the necessities for a kitchen. She even had food in the fridge for coffee and ground us up some fresh coffee!
The neighborhood was amazing. It was so well located, we were close to everything! A very short ride to downtown seattle and you basically miss traffic coming from this area. We explored Columbia City and honestly it had the most delicious food around. We loved that area- highly recommend it!"
1097520,44331559,2015-08-25,33643,Sofy,Perfect location for the purpose of our trip. The apartment is very spacious and comfortable. I loved the heated floors in the bathroom! It was really nice to find a bottled water in the fridge and I also appreciated the recommendations for dinner and breakfast that were left out for us. Geraldine's breakfast spot is a must try for a good greasy spoon breakfast.  
1097520,45085736,2015-08-31,2316913,Annette,"Jeanie provided a great place.  The sheets and pillows helped for a great night's sleep.  The bathroom was spacious and as the closet was within it, it helped to minimize clutter.  Although on street parking is available, it was nice to have a parking spot.  Neighborhood was friendly and Lake Washington was visible from outside.  Would definitely stay again."
1097520,46274915,2015-09-09,31013492,Marc,"Jeanie is a friendly, very acive person. We really enjoyed our stay in her studio, it is clean, spacious and very comfy. She even drove us to the train station with our luggage the day we left so I can recommend anyone who wants to visit to stay at her place!"
1097520,46877930,2015-09-14,462076,Iva,"Jeanie was a wonderful host, very accommodating and helpful. She even stocked the fridge for us and gave us lots of recommendations for the local sights and restaurants - very much appreciated. The apartment was exactly as pictured, very comfortable and clean. We had a great time!"
1097520,48868305,2015-09-29,34646660,René,"Hey Jeanie,
thanks for the great time in a fantastic place. The flat, the neighborhood and the city was absolute awesome. And especially a lot of thanks for the good tips where I must go in Seattle. I'am sure the I will come back...

Greetings from Germany,
René "
1097520,49376680,2015-10-03,19536495,Brandon,Great listing! Jeanie's listing is well appointed and exactly as described. She has paid great attention to all the little details that go into providing a great stay. You can tell easily that Jeanie takes great pride in hosting!
1097520,50066373,2015-10-09,33327456,Rosa,"Jeanie's place was reasonably clean and cozy; located in a nice neighborhood close to town, restaurants, parks and Lake Washington. Her suggestions for restaurants were very helpful. Thanks Jeanie!"
1097520,50482537,2015-10-12,2399200,Sam,"Jeanie was a wonderful host; super friendly and helpful as well as flexible when we were late for our check-in time. She had many great suggestions for nearby restaurants as well as fun things to do in Seattle. Her home was gorgeous and the room is spacious and surprisingly well-lit for a basement space. Beautiful neighborhood, beautiful place, hope to stay there again!"
1097520,51731994,2015-10-24,28098792,Barbara,"Our stay with our host Jeanie in Mt. Baker was perfect. We were very busy with kids and grand kids so we didn't have much time with her.  But the space was perfect for the 2 of us.  Comfortable, clean, beautiful bathroom.  I especially loved the heated floor in the bathroom.  Jeanie stocked us with coffee fixings, juice, granola, yogurt and even though we did not arrive until after midnight she greeted us with champagne, very welcome after our 6 hour flight.  We visit Seattle often and will definitely stay there again."
1097520,55235018,2015-11-29,9078049,Matthew,"A very good experience.  Even though Jeanie was away for the holiday, everything was in order and we had absolutely no problems.
The location is ideal if you desire peace AND easy access to downtown Seattle.

Given the peaceful , neighborhood surrounding, plus the comfortable and cozy suite, it was a 1st rate stay, one we hope to repeat."
4854767,24317228,2014-12-25,11153789,Ben,"I loved my stay at this house! It's very comfortable, spacious, and has great character. Also, the neighborhood is excellent! It's the perfect mix of a few useful chain stores and then a myriad of small boutique businesses, art galleries, restaurants and bars! There was even an art walk going on in the Greenwood neighborhood one of the nights I was there, and we hit up four different galleries (including Urban Light Studios!) which were right in walking distance! Really neat area, great house, and very accommodating host. Thanks, Libby!"
4854767,24793867,2015-01-02,9053257,Megan,"Libby's place is the cutest, we called it the smurf house. Some good friends and I stayed the night only for New Years, so we weren't there very long. I would definitely stay there again, great locations and Libby was super helpful."
4854767,25818462,2015-01-26,20402024,Nick,"Libby was a very flexible and accommodating host even though we never met in person.  Quite affable and quick to respond to inquiries.  She and her friend Prashanti, who provided on the ground service in light of Libby's absence in LA, were quite gracious.  The house itself was perfect for what could turn into a long-term stay in a dynamic Greenwood neighborhood.  Highly recommended!  "
4854767,27924909,2015-03-15,14278422,Mary,"Libby was a great host! She was very accommodating with a request to extend at the last minute. If you like to cook, her kitchen will delight you!"
4854767,28516589,2015-03-25,7525631,Jessica,Libby was a wonderful hostess for my family! Being able to stay feet away from us in Libby's home made their trip very nice and convenient. The accommodations were comfortable and just what they were hoping:) A great spot and super convenient location! I would highly recommend Libby's place.
4854767,32696348,2015-05-20,31179249,Julie,"Libby did a terrific job of hosting us! We were in town for a friend's wedding at nearby Urban Light Studios and Libby's location couldn't have been better. When my dress ripped at the wedding, my boyfriend was able to run back home and get dress #2 without missing more than a song or two! Her place was just as we expected- cute, clean, and cozy. We enjoyed having the whole ""smurf house"" to ourselves, and found her suggestions for local eateries and coffee shops were wonderful. I would definitely recommend her place to anyone wanting to explore the Greenwood area. 

"
4854767,34383821,2015-06-07,34943589,Joel,"Libby was really Johnny on the spot for me, i inquired the night before i wanted the house and did not complete everything until the morning of the stay and she pulled it all together, the house was clean and cozy
and there was plenty of info in her book to help with our stay. thanks Libby"
4854767,34658157,2015-06-10,33216072,Kathleen,Great stay in a lovely part of town! 
4854767,35080304,2015-06-15,12589746,Luann,"Libby's cozy house was just what we expected. Adorable little home in a quiet neighborhood. Close to stores and restaurants. Would stay again when I'm in Seattle. 
Luann"
4854767,40563328,2015-08-01,193291,Claire,"Libby was quick to respond and extremely easy to communicate with. The house was exactly as represented in the pictures, and the neighborhood was lovely, lots of things to do, restaurants, and grocery stores nearby."
4854767,40966018,2015-08-03,37452471,Jouko,"We had a great stay at Libby's clean and cozy house in the similarly cozy Greenwood neighborhood. Libby had some great tips and recommendations which were very helpful when looking for good food and getting around using public transportation. She was also very accommodating with regards to working around our odd arrival and departure times. Great stay!

Extra bonus surprise: Amazing muppet poster in the kitchen. "
4854767,41450243,2015-08-07,38981206,Lance,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and Libby made it a personal and positive experience. From her smiling picture with Elmo, to our written contact, to the pick-up of the key at a friendly local coffeeshop, we found ourselves becoming excited about our stay in ways never experienced by the usual hotel booking. The house itself was cute and homey, reflecting the artistic temperament of it's owner. We were sorry to leave, as we felt we had gotten to know a new friend; more than a business transaction. A lovely experience we will repeat on our next visit. A great location to visit the city, around the corner from the bus direct to downtown. Nice neighbors, lent us a bike wrench; Libby had a bike for us to use which was nice. Thanks for a great stay!!!"
4854767,42000662,2015-08-10,18094848,Caitlin,"This place had all the basics - enough space for a few guests, a clean kitchen and bathroom, and access to public transportation - plus it was located in a very cool neighborhood. And Libby was friendly, accessible, and accommodating.  However, a few aspects of the listing were a tad misleading:  the bed in the second bedroom is a mattress on the floor and not a real bed as it appears in the photo.  Also, the house is described as having lots of old-school charm but I found several things not charming but in poor condition, including a faucet that was loose and a bench/shelf that broke when I sat on it (I was fine; it was a low bench/shelf for holding shoes and I mistakenly sat on it while I was putting my shoes on). Still, this place was a good deal for what it offered, and overall it was a good experience."
4854767,43396655,2015-08-19,38787283,Randall,Our host was super easy to communicate with and open to solving coordination issues with chek-in and check-out. Great neighborhood!
4854767,43566229,2015-08-20,4795162,David,"Cute house with character in a great neighborhood. Amazingly quiet at night and super close to tons of great places to explore, eat, and drink. "
4854767,44131988,2015-08-24,37087106,Jesse,"Libby was great to work with - quick and thorough in responding to email. The neighborhood was a lot of fun - plenty of coffeeshops, vintage/consignment stores, book store, and restaurants and bars in walking distance. The location was great for exploring other neighborhoods too - we had a car, but I noticed several bus stops close to the house, if you choose to use public transportation. "
4854767,45298120,2015-09-01,40728506,Megan,"Libby was very helpful and kind throughout, giving us quick feedback and customized recommendations. We stayed in the little blue house while apartment hunting in the area and were very grateful for its convenient location to many places we viewed. It's a great neighborhood, too! "
4854767,48442852,2015-09-26,11132047,Brad,"I booked Libby's place for my employee Jeremy who LOVED it. His words:
""Great little house in a quiet neighborhood. Libby was very communicative and gave great recommendations in the neighborhood. I was able to walk everywhere I needed to go and had no trouble with the check-in/check-out. Would definitely stay there again."""
4854767,57201706,2015-12-23,217299,Robin,"I stayed at Libby's charming house for three months. It was a fantastic experience from start to finish. 
The house is as described, though it's hard to give a sense of how adorable it is in words alone. The kitchen is spacious with great appliances, the lounge is cozy and relaxing, the bedrooms are soothing sleep caves, and throughout the house there are delightful artistic decorations. 
From the first contact, Libby was wonderful hostess. She made the effort to find out what I needed and would like to know about as a newcomer to Seattle, and provided very useful and extensive tips and advice. She was very responsive and helpful whenever I had a question throughout my stay.
The area shows the best of Seattle. Greenwood is very artsy, fun,  and varied. Within a few blocks lie a 'Space Exploration' store, a theatre, a creative reuse for artists, coffee shops and a second-hand bookstore. The area is close enough to downtown via bus or excellent cycle routes for easy commuting in around 30-45 minutes.  
Libby's house lies on a charming street away from the area's main avenue, and is blissfully quiet. I was studying intensively during my stay and being able to retreat to the house for quality rest and sleep helped get me through the work. I can't recommend the place enough. 
I found Libby to be conscientious, helpful and incredibly amiable. She's a great hostess and her upbeat and good nature was evident in every communication. I thank her for a marvellous time in Seattle. "
8723086,49963560,2015-10-07,21267620,Gordon,"First thing that strikes you is that Wesley is a really nice and helpful guy. He is willing to do anything to make sure your stay is perfect, which it was. He has a really nice apartment, with some lovely antique Indian furniture and it's in a great location. He was also very generous to leave breakfast cereals, fresh coffee, eggs, milk, juice , fruit, etc. in the kitchen. That was a really nice and much appreciated touch! Clean towels and other facilities were also provide. There are restaurants and bars within easy walking distance in Fremont. Would highly recommend!"
8723086,50252969,2015-10-10,43470389,Canija,This apartment was awesome! The pictures really do it no justice. It was extremely easy to make ourselves at home and enjoy our time. The art and books in the apartment added a very nice touch to the experience. Wesley and his girlfriend were accommodating and helpful in every way possible. I will definitely be staying here again. It's the perfect home away from home. 
8723086,50803119,2015-10-14,45538984,Jackeline,"The apartment is great, it has all appliances needed for a pleasant stay, it is clean, and is located in a very nice and quiet neighborhood, with accessible public transportation only 15 min from downtown Seattle. 
Wesley is extremely nice and had purchased cereal, milk, bananas and OJ, for us! 
We rented a car and he allowed us to park in the garage.
I highly recommend this place! "
8723086,50901653,2015-10-15,42625946,James,"Great location, Wesley is prompt and available if you need anything.  Having a full kitchen was great and the breakfast/coffee was a nice addition!"
8723086,51223628,2015-10-18,21633829,Jennifer,"Wesley's place was great! It was clean, spacious, quiet, and comfortable. The location was a perfect home-base for our Seattle explorations. It is convenient to downtown or Fremont. Wesley and his girlfriend Louise were so easy to work with and very accommodating. I would definitely stay here again!"
8723086,51391227,2015-10-19,3596706,Emery,"Wesley's home is cozy and conveniently located near town. It's easy to drive or catch a ride wherever you want to go. Wesley left some basic amenities for us in the apartment, which was appreciated."
8723086,51863878,2015-10-24,47041903,Abby,"Wesley and Louise are lovely and accommodating hosts! The apartment was really cozy and in a very convenient location for experiencing the city. They provided nice, simple breakfast options and on-site laundry was a nice perk!"
8723086,52153793,2015-10-26,38285583,Excel,"Wesley was really nice and accommodating when it came to check in and check out times which I really appreciated! Since it was my first time in Seattle, he also shared a lot of cool things to do around the area. The place was identical to the photos and really clean. Was a great first time Airbnb experience!"
8723086,53440627,2015-11-08,43586173,Marco,"Wesley is a very cool guy.  His place is nice, got an inside parking, the bed is comfortable and we even had breakfast stuff for the next morning.   We had an issue during our stay, but Wesley was good to figure out a fair arrangement."
8723086,53616518,2015-11-10,11608180,James,"Wesley's place is fantastic. Truly elegant and spacious. It's right in the center of everything and really close to downtown. Public transit can take you anywhere from here. It was very quiet, clean, and accommodating with cereal ready for a good breakfast. I would for sure stay here again! "
8723086,54359411,2015-11-18,236259,Heather,"Wesley was very communicative and helpful for us and made booking easy by responding to all of our questions, as well as being super reasonable on check in time. The space was perfectly comfortable and had all the amenities that you could need. Super cozy for 2 people and in a key location close to everything we could need. I'd definitely suggest a stay at Wesley's and I would easily re -book a stay there myself! Killer find. "
8723086,54451420,2015-11-20,27478127,Vinay,"Wesley's apartment was great for me and my pregnant wife! Only a 5 minute drive to the Space Needle and Chihuly Gardens and to a bunch of great restaurants in Seattle. His place was clean, warm, quiet, and Wesley was a friendly and accomodating host! He had every amenity anyone would need and even more! We will definitely be recommending his place to friends! "
8723086,55242066,2015-11-29,30588334,Azrah,"I met Wesley my first day, he was very patient and understanding, as my flight got delayed and I got a little lost with my phone being dead. His apartment is a lot more spacious than in the photos. I loved the art on the walls. My friends and I had a great time at his place because it's very convenient and comfortable. Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a home away from home:)"
8723086,56877313,2015-12-19,20048942,Girish,"This was our first AirBnb stay and we are really glad that we chose to stay at Wesley's place over a hotel. Our stay here was nothing less than pure awesomeness.

The place: It had everything one might need for a comfortable stay. A fully stocked kitchen, a warm nice bed, big closets, a large tastefully decorated living room and a quiet balcony to enjoy your morning coffee. Advice - If you are hauling a lot of luggage, enter from back of the building from the garage to avoid tugging your luggage up a flight of stairs to the elevator.

Neighborhood: It is a well connected quiet area. There is a quaint deli down the road which also serves decent sandwiches. There is a bus stop right opposite the building where you can get a bus to downtown or SLU if you don't prefer walking.

Host: Wez is an awesome host. Kind, understanding, unassuming and all round a great guy to hang out with. He communicated well before our arrival. Once we reached, he took time off to check on us, introduced us to the setup of the house and made us feel very welcome. We couldn't hope for a better host.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking at a short or long term stay. "
8723086,57155619,2015-12-22,39971118,XiangLonn,"Wesley was very helpful and answered my questions promptly. We had no trouble checking into the house. He also provides instructions that were clear. 
The house is spacious and cosy, and we enjoyed our stay here."
4814811,24775307,2015-01-02,18218137,Jonathan,"Cameron was a gracious host, ready to accommodate any of our needs during our stay. The space was beautiful and clean, and the windows allow so much light into the room. The location was really convenient - near lots of great restaurants and bars. Hope we'll have a chance to visit again!"
4814811,26558088,2015-02-15,2591829,Chrissy & Matthew,"The house is in a really great location and it's very clean and beautiful. Cameron and his roommate Daniel were so welcoming and friendly. Checking in was super easy, Cameron was easy to contact. We had a great stay at their place and would stay there again for sure. "
4814811,27254249,2015-03-01,24192077,Martin,This was my first Airbnb stay and I could not have hoped for a better experience. Cameron and his flatmate Daniel are super friendly and nice guys. Their flat is gorgeous and it instantly felt like a home for me. They were also incredible helpful with any questions I had about Seattle. The flat is in a great part of Capitol Hill and I totally fell in love with that area. If I go back to Seattle then I'll be heading back here for sure :)
4814811,27625807,2015-03-08,6863118,Aaron,"We had a great time staying at Cameron's place in Seattle!

Cameron and his housemate Daniel were fantastic hosts and incredibly welcoming. They provided some really stellar restaurant recommendations in the area, and were really helpful with basic tips for navigating the city and getting downtown. We arrived late in the evening on the first night, ended up just hanging with them in the house, and felt completely at home.

The home and room are fantastic as well: very clean, modern, and bright. And the rooftop deck was a great way to take in the city skyline. The location is just blocks from lots of restaurants and entertainment, but the street itself is quiet. 

We will absolutely plan to stay here on any return trips to Seattle."
4814811,27912050,2015-03-14,18783851,Peixi,"Cameron's place was truly amazing.  The room was very nice and clean and the house is in a perfect location. The best part of my stay was meeting Daniel and Cameron, who were extremely helpful and friendly. I was on an house hunting trip and both of them gave me lots of insight on different neighborhoods in Seattle. Both guys were super chill and made me feel like home. I'd definitely stay there again next time I'm in Seattle. "
4814811,27969754,2015-03-15,28875280,Kate,"Daniel and Cameron were wonderful hosts! They made us feel right at home and were very accommodating to our needs. The apartment is very clean, and the rooftop deck has a wonderful view of the city. Definitely stay here especially if you are interested in the Capitol Hill area! 

"
4814811,28235080,2015-03-20,19236729,J.R.,"Cameron's flatmate, Daniel, was an excellent host and my husband and I had a great time talking to him!  He also gave us great recommendations for what to see/do in the area, which we very much appreciate.  He recommended visiting Volunteer Park, which is just a 25-minute walk away from the airbnb, and we had a great time walking through the park, as it has beautiful views of Seattle, including the Space Needle.  The house is very clean and tidy and we definitely appreciate how thoughtful Daniel was with providing us with freshly ground coffee in the morning!  It was an all around great experience!!"
4814811,28280859,2015-03-21,29196676,Kimly,"We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay on our weekend trip. From the start, Cameron was really easy to communicate with. He and his roommate, Daniel, were both incredibly friendly and made themselves readily available if we needed them for anything.  

The apartment was clean, modern, and in a really great location. The neighborhood was nice and quiet, but also a short walk to really great food and coffee. "
4814811,28487651,2015-03-24,6628403,Juan,"This is our first visit to Seattle and it was amazing staying at Cameron's house. Great neighborhood. It's super clean and neat. Cameron was not at home when we arrived. Daniel showed us around in the house. He was very friendly and helpful definitely. Also, they have super soft and cozy bed! I love it!! :)  "
4814811,28808970,2015-03-30,1119191,Denise,"Staying at Cameron's beautiful place was a great pleasure and my best Airbnb-experience so far. The room and the bathroom are bright, spacious, super-clean and look exactly as on the photos. The house is most ideally located: the neighborhood is an exciting, nice, and safe area; there are cafés, health food-stores, bars, and restaurants in walking distance - also the fabulous bookstore ""Elliott Bay Book Co."" Downtown is just a 20 mins walk (or a bus ride) away. 
Cameron and his roommate Daniel are really nice and friendly people, and most generous with their advice. I felt very welcome and enjoyed - not just Seattle - but staying with them a lot."
4814811,29207962,2015-04-05,14316034,Jennifer,Cameron's home is incredibly beautiful. It was a peaceful oasis between busy work meetings and I enjoyed having such a warm home base. I really felt like I had the whole house to myself! Total luxury in Seattle. Cameron is beyond welcoming and kind - he made navigating Seattle very easy to do. 
4814811,29757596,2015-04-12,3530722,Kelsey,"I really enjoyed my stay at Cameron's place! He and Daniel were wonderful hosts, and made me feel welcome in Seattle. The room and place were perfect, and the location was excellent (in Capitol Hill). They had great tips for the neighborhood and were happy to answer any questions that I had. I had a great time at their place and would recommend it to anyone that's in town and wants to meet some nice Seattle residents!"
4814811,30093157,2015-04-17,13873078,Lorence,"It is a lifetime experience to stay in Cameron's place. The location is very good for Traveller's who want to see the other side of Seattle. It's very centralized to walk to the downtown area as well as to parks and interesting neighborhood around. This area is very safe, clean and so many things to explore. The only disappointment that I've is not staying here long enough. Will definitely stay here again if I'm coming back. Thank you so much to Cameron and Daniel for your kind hospitality."
4814811,30356953,2015-04-20,672713,Yann,"Oh what a fantastic stay. The house is great: very clean and tidy, spacious, beautiful. The neighborhood is great: lots of nice restaurants, cafés, and bars within walking distance but not so close that there’s any noise, it’s a very pretty and quiet street. And to top it all I had a great time hanging out with Daniel (Cameron’s housemate) who was so kind and full of good advice, and made everything so easy. If you’re a foodie like myself be sure to ask him about the nice restaurants around.
I didn’t get to meet Cameron as he was away at the time but if his housemates are anything to go by I’m sure he’s a great guy.
I would definitely come back here again and would certainly recommend it to anyone."
4814811,30434134,2015-04-21,29255906,Annu,"Thanks again for having me it was such a lovely stay, the house was amazing and everything went perfectly. I would love to stay again with more time! "
4814811,34033394,2015-06-03,6584614,Jan,"Cameron was wonderful.  His place is very near Swedish Hospital Cherry Hill.  My father-in-law was having heart surgery and our schedules were just crazy.  Cameron was flexible, caring and a great support.  We will book with him again when we have time to play in Seattle.  His place is in a great neighborhood and within walking distance of some very cool places.  Right near the bus line too."
4814811,42810897,2015-08-16,16261607,Jason,"Stayed here for a whole summer while working in Seattle and it was the perfect spot.  Cameron is a wonderful host, and the house is clean, well-designed, and ideal for both a short or long stay.  The area has two grocery stores within a few blocks, great access to the best of Capitol Hill, and the house has a view of the city skyline from the large roof deck with a grill.  Highly recommend!"
4814811,43514081,2015-08-20,38138955,Stella,Awesome stay. Pretty convenient location to many of Seattle's best sights and restaurants. Great view of the tranquil neighbourhood. Super useful tips from the hosts and thank you for having us! Definitely a recommendation for all going to Seattle!
4814811,43660073,2015-08-21,10890802,Andy,"Cameron and Daniel were great, very helpful in recommending restaurants and places to see while in Seattle. The room and bathroom were great and the location is wonderful as well. "
4814811,44102014,2015-08-24,11349187,Heather,"Great stay and lovely hosts. We didn't see much of each other, as I was out sightseeing most of the days! Rooftop deck perfect place to wind down with a wine at the end of the day. Home was spotless. Thanks for having me :-)"
4814811,45065374,2015-08-31,32851820,Keith,"We had a great time! What a lovely flat, amazing view, and perfect location.  Cameron and Dani were friendly and gracious hosts.  They knew the area well and were generally awesome!"
4814811,45316400,2015-09-01,4676241,Rosamund,"A superb apartment, with absolutely charming hosts! Thank you so much for making us feel so welcome on our all too brief stay. We definitely hope to be back in Seattle and would definitely stay here again. Thanks a lot :)
PS. The bed is sooo comfortable! I want that mattress."
4814811,45489990,2015-09-03,19079168,Ross,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay in Seattle at the house. The location is excellent, only a short walk to Capitol Hill where there are plenty of bars and restaurants, and really close to downtown where the main tourist attractions are. I didn't see much of Dani or Cameron (probably because people go to work during the week), but when I did, they were both friendly and welcoming. The house is as great as it looks in the pictures, and I am thoroughly jealous and want a place like that for myself. Would definitely return to continue exploring Seattle! "
4814811,45780257,2015-09-06,10398164,Michelle,This is such a great house and Cameron and Daniel were excellent hosts and made me feel very welcome. Located in a quiet street and beautifully decorated you won't be sorry if you book here - my only negative is that it was raining and I didn't get to enjoy the gorgeous roof top terrace enough - but that's Seattle! Thanks again for having me stay 
4814811,45923500,2015-09-07,29063405,Megan,"Description from website was very accurate. Cameron and Danny provided a clean, comfortable space and were very generous with offering beverages, etc. The beautiful, modern house is located in a neighborhood within walking distance to bars and restaurants and a short bus ride from downtown. The hosts were also very helpful with recommendations of places to go around the neighborhood. "
4814811,46315353,2015-09-09,26813948,Vicenc,Nice neighborhood and great place to spend a couple of days!!!
4814811,46580418,2015-09-12,34211559,Roberto,"Cameron und seine Mitbewohner waren super Gastgeber und konnten uns immer weiterhelfen bei Fragen. Vor allem die Möglichkeit eines tragbaren Wifi-Moduls war sehr praktisch, da wir Roaming Kosten sparen konnten. 
Die Wohnung war wie beschrieben und der Blick von der Dachterasse war einfach einmalig. 
Knapp 200m weiter war auch die Bushaltestelle mit der man ohne umsteigen ins Zentrum gelangt oder auch zur Space Needle.
Wir können die Wohnung uneingeschränkt weiter empfehlen!"
4814811,56170138,2015-12-09,27836534,Wayne,"The room is clean and modernized exactly as the picture shown and we have own private bathroom. The white/wooden stylish design of open kitchen, dining and living room is quite an unique and enjoyable experience. We are allowed to park our car in downstairs garage which is quite convenient.  The location is close to Pike Market with 5~10 min driving, also close to Trader Joy's, Safeway. It's quite hard to find a place which is close to downtown with such reasonable price and with such living quality!"
2399736,10703498,2014-03-03,4233041,Iris,"It was very easy to check in to Dahlia, and I felt at home and comfy there right away. The kitchen is spacious and had everything I needed to cook a great meal for friends in Seattle. The bedrooms were both simply and tastefully decorated, had great light, and the beds were very comfortable. The stereo system and TV in the living room were also a plus. Gil and Tom's unobtrusive way of showing guests how stuff works (like clearly labeling the different trash/recycling/compost receptacles) made it a very stress-free experience. Also, the neighborhood is GREAT. I was attending a conference in Seattle's City Center, and found it very easy to travel there and back on the bus. The neighborhood was beautiful and quiet and had fun bars/restaurants. Staying at Dahlia was definitely one of the best parts of my trip to Seattle."
2399736,10973486,2014-03-15,13093397,Claire,"Tom and Gil's place is an oasis. We used it as a relaxing and cozy (yet spacious!) home base for our Seattle adventure. The quiet neighborhood and lovely neighbors (Tom and Gil) made our stay truly refreshing. It was hard to leave.
"
2399736,11182440,2014-03-24,9462365,Joella (Jodie),"Our stay at Gil and Tom's house was wonderful! The home is exactly as depicted in the photos. The house was very clean. I was there with my adult son for 8 nights. The home is very convenient to bus stops.  It was very easy to get everywhere from this home. There is a very good coffee shop called Katy's within close proximity. Union Market at the end of the street for anything you may need including quick food and even clothing items. 
Tom and Gil have provided a very nice place to stay in Seattle. We never got to meet them but they did check in with us. The only thing that may be construed as a very minor inconvenience was the lack of a microwave. We heated things stovetop and in the oven. It just took a little longer than microwaving. Results are the same, maybe better? 
I highly recommend staying at Dahlia. It is very well kept. The beds were comfortable even for myself with back and joint issues. The home has a nice living room with TV,stereo, and books. We didn't use it as we were out exploring each day. 
If you are visiting Seattle, this is definitely a great place to stay. Very easy to get anywhere from here."
2399736,11312212,2014-03-29,2734499,Jason,This was a fantastic experience. Bare bone essentials in the house but everything you could possibly need. The big screen TV made my evening vegg time fantastic. We were nicely greeted by our hosts when we arrived. The hot water runs for days. It was convenient to have a washing and drying machine. Perfect location walking distance to lots of wonderful bars restaurants etc. I would highly recommend this listing. 
2399736,11471307,2014-04-04,10800060,Ahnie,"This apartment was perfect for our five day visit to Seattle. The location was within easy walking distance of lots of shops and restaurants. It was a good half hour walk to the downtown area of Pike's Place Market, and over an hour to the Space Needle. The neighborhood seemed safe and quiet and we didn't have any problems with loud noises late at night.
The kitchen had all of the basics-cookware, silverware, stove, oven, so we were able to cook meals easily. There is no microwave or roasting pans though. 
The rest of the apartment was clean and spare. The big screen TV was pretty nice!
I would definitely recommend this apartment for a visit to Seattle."
2399736,11563583,2014-04-07,10699269,Consuelo,"Just perfect! Feels like home!
Thanks Gil and Tom."
2399736,12023236,2014-04-21,5582685,Jake,"A very nice place in a nice neighborhood. Clean, comfortable and private. Convenient street parking and easy access to a bus that goes right to downtown Seattle in just a few minutes. Check in and out was super fast and easy. We met the host once, just by chance, and he was polite and friendly. I'd be happy to stay here again."
2399736,12300375,2014-04-28,11479222,Dave,"Gil and Tom's place was just as presented, clean, bright and comfortable. The neighbourhood is nice and quite accessible by transit. Thanks Guys."
2399736,13034080,2014-05-18,5399971,Justin,"We enjoyed our stay at Dahlia, Gil and Tom's first floor apt. The Netflix access and large tv were a great feature. As a heads up to other guests, the place could use a few extra furnishings like a table or drawers in the bedroom, someplace to set your clothes. 
Other than that, the apt is in a great neighborhood with access to multiple bus lines and within walking distance of several great restaurants including Skillet, a def must try! 
And if you stay here, don't forget to leave a message on the giant chalkboard wall!!"
2399736,13163217,2014-05-20,13956726,Xiaotao,"We had a wonderful weekend stay at Gil and Tom's place. Everything was perfect for  us: the location is great as it is close to all major attractions; the beds are comfortable; the rest of the place provide enough infrastructure to make us feel right at home. It was nice that we had access to washer and dryer within the unit. We really appreciate all the thoughtfulness that you have given to this charming place. Thank you for being attentive and responsive ... we run out of salt while cooking the first night, Gil came over right away and gave us some sea salt. Our girls really loved your creative idea of having a ""feedback wall"" in the hallway :) We would highly recommend this place to others!"
2399736,13252170,2014-05-23,2659966,Daniela & Ricardo,"The house was located in a nice neighborhood, close to downtown and equipped with all necessary implements for a nice stay. Gil and Tom were available at all times to help with any question or request. We recommend them!"
2399736,13417228,2014-05-27,2127135,Jason,"The location was great, we were able to get in, get out and get on our way around Seattle. The bedrooms are quite interesting and decorated accordingly. The house functioned well for us and the 1 bathroom was never an issue. We liked the backyard since we had a few sunny days."
2399736,13532912,2014-05-30,1689114,Myles,"This place had the most pleasant checking in and out experience I've ever had. Thanks Gil and Tom, for a clean and relaxing place for me and two friends. We loved Katys coffee place just down the street"
2399736,13684307,2014-06-02,12496496,Lauren,"We enjoyed our stay at Gil and Tom's. There were many positives about the place including easy checkin, spaciousness, comfortable beds, nice neighborhood (we paid 10.00 taxis to downtown and also took buses with no problem), quirky cool cinema serving food and alcohol a block away, and great TV with access to Netflix movies (thanks!) There is one issue that nobody has mentioned that was unpleasant and that is the bathtub...I didn't get close enough to determine if it was badly scratched up or dirty or both, but the black on the bottom was a bit of a jolt and shower slippers are needed. Other than that, we were very happy with the place and when we called Gil for top sheets, he responded right away and brought some over for us. "
2399736,14161199,2014-06-13,15786938,Bruce,"Dahlia is an awesome (website hidden) room, two bedrooms with queen sized beds. Kitchen with dining room space and a nice backyard. "
2399736,14337682,2014-06-17,12128321,Cobretti,Great place! Family loved it! 
2399736,15394794,2014-07-08,14163916,Amanda,"We were more than happy with Gil and Tom's pad, it was big enough for a family of four, very clean, and close to all amenities.
"
2399736,16006607,2014-07-20,453622,Luis,"We had a wonderful time at Gil and Tom's home. The house is exactly as depicted in the pictures. The bedrooms were very spacious and the bed were really comfortable. After a day of sightseeing, it was nice to come back and relax in the living room with a number of selections on the TV.  It was nice to feel like you had your own space while visiting Seattle. I love the chalkboard in the hallway with stuff that people have written. Also, Gil and Tom were very responsive to our questions.

The location is perfect, especially if you like to immerse yourself in a neighborhood, instead of around all the tourists. During our stay, we were able to walk around to a number of great establishments. Every morning, I would make sure to grab coffee and breakfast at Katy's Corner Cafe. Also, Skillet Diner, which was suggested by Gil and Tom, is absolutely out of this world. The people are great and the food is even better. We ended up going to this place a few times. There is also a local beer spot for hanging out. 

Transportation to all the sights is easy as well. The 2 bus is located on Union Ave and we were able to get to where we wanted to go. 10 minutes to Downtown Seattle. 

If I returned to Seattle, I would stay at this property in a heartbeat.

2399736,16653219,2014-07-31,14189264,Corey,"This listing was pretty accurate. This is a great location with convenient, free parking. The beds are comfortable, and the unit was well-stocked. Overall, very decent quality for an affordable price! "

2399736,17163877,2014-08-08,17833845,Jonny,"This Airbnb experience was amazing! Gil, Tom, and Jon made us feel so welcome into their place. During our stay, I messaged them to let them know we had used the last bit of laundry detergent, just as a heads up, and they responded so quickly saying if we needed any more they would run some down to us. The actual apartment was great, the beds were very comfortable, and everything was very clean. The neighborhood feels very safe, and is a short Uber, cab, or bus ride to downtown. Pike and Pine is definitely walkable. I'd definitely stay here again, and since I fell in love with Seattle this last trip, it will most likely be very soon! Thanks so much again!!"
2399736,17701663,2014-08-16,17511759,James,"Great place! While my friend and I were not home too much, we felt very comfortable during our stay. Gil, Tom, and Jon were very flexible with letting us drop our bags off prior to check in which was a big help. I used Uber for all my transportation needs (about $8-$10 to get downtown) which we found to be faster and only slightly more expensive than the bus. However, the busses were very close by if we decided to use them. The place itself was spacious and clean and our hosts were always available to assist if necessary. Thanks for a great stay in Seattle!"
2399736,17844104,2014-08-18,4180788,Michelle,"The listing was accurate and I felt like the previous reviews and the photos were all spot on. I was in town for a wedding at the Arboretum and I needed a place close by for myself and a friend. We had been looking for something a little more upscale, but given that this was an extremely busy weekend for the City of Seattle, pretty much all hotels and Bed and Breakfasts were booked. This apartment was just the alternative I had hoped for. Gil and Tom were super helpful hosts, flexible with us about our check-in and very responsive will all our little pre-check in queries."
2399736,18255694,2014-08-24,421170,Jody,Fantastic and peaceful little corner of Capital Hill. Just the home base we needed during a week of wedding craziness. An easy walk to Trader Joes and always had plenty of parking. Thanks again!
2399736,18551001,2014-08-28,11418206,Shannon,"Very welcoming, the keyless entrance was wonderful, parking was easy.  Kitchen was very sparse, no pan, no microwave"
2399736,20496550,2014-09-30,2494296,Eric,Luna Farm worked out well for our trip to Seattle. It was clean and was conveniently located near downtown. Be aware it is very basic with more of a hostel feel. The one perk was the giant TV with Roku access. The hosts were also responsive to any questions. 
2399736,20922601,2014-10-07,590624,Penelope,"Luna Farm was a great place to stay, close to everything, but quiet with parking.  Plenty of room (perfect for 2 couples) with a large kitchen and large living room as well.  The host and property manager were very communicative and great to work with"
2399736,21531185,2014-10-19,21367400,Evan,"We had a great time at this spacious apartment. Not having been to Seattle before, I wasn't sure if this was gonna be a very walkable location, but it turned out to be great! We were only about 15 minutes away from a ton of great bars and restaurants (had great Sushi and a couple stops at Elysian!!!). And we even walked over to downtown in only about half an hour.

The apartment itself was enormous and very clean. We didn't get to meet our hosts face to face, but their communication beforehand was great. I'd definitely stay here again. Thanks!!!"
2399736,22370245,2014-11-04,22298221,Gaby,"I loved staying at Luna Farm! The size of the apartment was perfect for the four of us and it was just as nice in person as it looks in the photos. I loved that we were able to walk to Trader Joe's for groceries easily and Chuck's Hop Shop for a few drinks as well. Our first night there was on Halloween and we got to see plenty of families in costume; the neighborhood felt very safe and inviting..When we arrived, there were half a dozen eggs, almond milk, spinach, and other groceries in the refrigerator ready for us to use. I would definitely stay here again on my next trip to Seattle."
2399736,22593607,2014-11-10,13370352,Russell,"Communication while setting up our stay was great! Jon worked with us on an early check in and was very helpful.  Easy check in and out.  The home was as listed.  Colorful clean and simple.  While we didn't use it much, access to Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu Plus was a nice extra.  Cool neighborhood.  Great Ethiopian restaurant and a great taphouse just down the street.  Only three miles from everything you want to do in downtown Seattle.  Easy Uber or bus ride to everything.  Free street parking if you do bring your car.  "
2399736,23205572,2014-11-25,16596295,Ashlee,"Luna Farm was the perfect home base for our short trip to Seattle. There were two couples, four of us total and this house was just the right match. The street offers plenty of parking along with easy access to local restaurants and shops. We did not utilize public transit as a personal choice, but feel it would have been adequate if needed. The space was neat, clean, and comfortable, much better than a hotel! There was sufficient cooking/cleaning products in addition to extras like coffee and tea! The neighborhood was very quiet and we experienced no difficulties. The beds and rooms were large and comfortable, overall a great fit! The hosts were readily available via e-mail and text and although we did not get to meet them, the house manager Jon did a great job of making sure our needs were taken care of. As first timers to Seattle, it was great to be able to get the full experience by staying in a local neighborhood. I would recommend this to anyone traveling to Seattle -- awesome experience!"
2399736,26368018,2015-02-10,26002228,Marisa,"We had a comfortable stay! The apartment was very clean and had what we needed. Our booking was accepted in a timely manner. The stereo had broken and I received a message from Gil offering to bring a new one immediately if we needed it.
Good to know we have a great first option for our next stay in Seattle!"
2399736,26542576,2015-02-15,22593882,Ericka,"The home is very comfortable and has everything you need. we enjoyed staying here accept for a few adjustments.
Location is really far away from tourist areas and the cool bar and restaurant scene. This is near a college is a quiet neighborhood... Nothing is walking distance, unless you are a serious urban hiker. Also, fair warning: driving in downtown Seattle is miserable...and the bus takes forever . 
Everything was great with this rental accept the refrigerator was gross, there was a huge pool of brown goo at the bottom of the fridge, splaters, smears and crumbs...and the microwave was not clean either.
It was kind of weird that there were no top sheets on the bed- just a comforter, pillows and a bottom sheet...so I'm hoping they wash the comforter between each guest? 
lastly, the couch is ""well loved"" and is not very comfortable.

The parking is in the back and fits 2 (3 If everyone parks nicely). However, there were neighbors/friends cars there the first day. There is no digital lock for the backdoor so you'd have to walk around to the front anyway. Street parking is good for the most part."
2399736,27001755,2015-02-23,25538905,Christina,"Luna Farm was a lovely, well-fitted apartment - perfect for a weekend trip to Seattle with friends. Four of us fit in very comfortably and had everything that we needed at our disposal. Communicating with Jon was great, his replies were quick and helpful. I'd definitely recommend a stay to Luna Farm to all of my friends!"
2399736,27227421,2015-02-28,27898372,Jennifer,Great place to stay. The neighborhood was excellent and the house was very clean and welcoming. I would recommend staying here and would stay here again.
2399736,27336411,2015-03-02,25305522,Lulu,"AMAZING! Jon was incredibly helpful and responded quickly to any questions or concerns I had. It was in a nice neighborhood close to restaurants, bars, etc. I highly recommend them!"
2399736,27974130,2015-03-15,4123020,Matt,"This was super easy to book, locate, access, enjoy. The host was very thoughtful in making all of that happen. Description and photos were right on with what I encountered. Had a great stay. Thanks Luna Farm."
2399736,28253805,2015-03-21,25759059,Amanda,We really enjoyed our stay at Luna park. The place was super clean and really conveniently located.
2399736,28606591,2015-03-27,26436595,Carla,"Space was great, easy and direct route to downtown. We had no contact with our hosts which didn't bother us. Would stay here again!"
2399736,29017977,2015-04-02,13326739,Lindsay,"This was a wonderful experience.  The house is lovely and spacious with beautiful art on the walls.  Everything is clean and well organized. It is in a quiet neighborhood yet walking distance to Capital Hill and right up the road from one of the city's coolest movie theaters and craft beer restaurants.   When we spent time in the city, we couldn't wait to get back to our charming cottage.  We were sorry to have to leave."
2399736,29500570,2015-04-08,27508248,Carissa,"We had a wonderful experience staying here! Beautiful place in a great neighborhood...Jon was very responsive and helpful, which really made a big difference for us. Would love to stay here again in the future!"

Love from Sibylle, Zurich"
2399736,30385622,2015-04-21,25433430,Corey,"Our stay at Luna Farm was great!  The space was clean and relatively spacious, and the back yard was a really nice perk.  Two colleagues and I were in town for a conference, and the three of us had plenty of room, one in each bedroom and one on the couch.  Our conference was downtown, and we had no problems taking the bus back and forth; there is a stop right down the block with a bus every 15 minutes.  There's also a convenience/grocery store on the corner, as well as a bar/bottle shop with a massive selection of craft beer.  We didn't meet Jon, but he was helpful and responded quickly to my texts.  I would stay here again for sure."
2399736,30620244,2015-04-25,29820104,Carol,"We loved staying at your place. And the chalk wall was excellent. We hope our daughter stays living where she is now, one block away, so that we can stay there again each time we visit. We liked the neighborhood cat that we met."
2399736,31338131,2015-05-04,30432725,Melissa,Cute house in a quiet neighborhood. Only 10 minutes from downtown and an easy walk to the bus stop in either direction. 
2399736,32572962,2015-05-19,21854498,Mitch,"This was a great place in a great neighborhood. The two bedrooms offered a contrast in styles and feeling between the fiery orange and the cool blue motifs. We appreciated the washer/dryer after being on the road for days,as well as the kitchen. Never saw hosts which was fine. Would stay here again!"
2399736,33081345,2015-05-25,2867457,Vickie,"May (phone number hidden)

The location was perfect. I liked the neighborhood and the close proximity to restaurants, food trucks, and grocery stores. Street parking was plentiful. So glad they had a washer/dryer. It was used daily.  I also liked that I could contact Jon for the couple of items needed and he responded pretty quickly.

The kitchen was pretty sparsely set up. The microwave had a major spill that was not cleaned up. I also ended up washing all of the dishes because the plates in the cupboard had remnants of food stuck to them. I washed all of the towels as well as they smelled mildewed. I also wish the bathtub had a proper stopper so I could take a bath.

"
2399736,33433769,2015-05-28,5394896,Charlene & Sammy,This was a very quaint house with all the necessary amenities and more. We would definitely stay here again.
2399736,33817917,2015-06-01,2994269,Daniel,The house was very nice and clean and it was very easy to find and access. 
2399736,34523076,2015-06-09,602696,Emilie,Superbe maison proche de Downtown. Très propre. Très confortable. Organisation parfaite. A faire sans hésiter!
2399736,35068229,2015-06-15,2530119,Nancy,"This was the perfect location to stay for our daughter's graduation from Seattle University.  It was clean, quiet and had everything we needed without any fancy frills.  There is street parking and the house is very private.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone staying in the Capitol hill neighborhood.  It takes about 12 minutes to walk to SU and I'm a slow walker. Thanks for everything.    "
2399736,36677995,2015-06-30,2295747,Warny,"Good, simple and clean. Expect no more than you see on the profile, but look forward to stay in a good value place that will make you feel comfy. "
2399736,37162680,2015-07-05,31454141,Tracey,"Our time at Luna farm was perfect!
The house was clean, comfortable and a very quiet neighborhood
My kids LOVED the chalkboard wall...we might have to make one at our house!
We loved the air conditioner too during the heat wave
We would definitely stay there again  "
2399736,37971517,2015-07-12,18700862,筠,My family and I really had a great time in the house. 
2399736,38278994,2015-07-14,4170486,Jake,Really enjoyed our stay here!  Everything went extremely smoothly and we were even able to drop our bags off early when we arrived in Seattle.  After coming back from a 7-day Alaska cruise the washer-dryer was clutch!
2399736,39170567,2015-07-21,31768352,Thomas,Nice accommodation 
2399736,39418670,2015-07-23,34315033,Ayelet,"Great place, comfortable, and spacious. The location is very convenient, quiet, yet central. Jon was very welcoming and helpful."
2399736,39900225,2015-07-27,5784370,Stephen,"This place was great, exactly as advertised, in a quiet neighborhood and close to enough to walk just about anywhere you needed to get to downtown. We really enjoyed the stay here and we'll be sure to book again for our next trip to Seattle."
2399736,41080889,2015-08-04,34217227,Morgan,"This Airbnb unit was basically as advertised--a clean, colorfully decorated, and comfortable 2BR duplex in a great Capitol Hill location.  The two beds were comfortable, and one of our kids even slept on the couch without any problems.  There was a parking spot reserved behind the house, two window A/C units in the bedrooms (for warm summer nights), free wifi, and basic amenities in the kitchen.  The digital lock setup worked well.  My only complaint is that we couldn't figure out how to use the TV, but that was a low priority for us anyhow.  Overall, a great stay and good value  for up to 4-5."
2399736,42247353,2015-08-12,17753969,Matt,Great little house in a cool area. There is a tap house down the street with 50 beers on tap and a different food truck there every night! Perfect!! Clean house with great TV options. Jon was a lovely guy and very helpful. Highly recommended place.
2399736,43036873,2015-08-17,33320001,Terry,"Luna Farm was comfortable apartment, with a great location close to downtown and we really appreciated the off street parking. They have added air conditioning which was most appreciated, especially the first night there. "
2399736,45368684,2015-09-02,5718874,Jeffrey,"Jon was very welcoming and patient with our questions, and provided a clean and spacious place for us to spend our vacation. Dahlia is a very comfortable home to stay in, with an excellent location (very easy to catch a bus into downtown, or to hire an Uber if you're in a hurry), and we're very thankful to Gil, Tom, and Jon for sharing their beautiful space with us."
2399736,45656278,2015-09-05,33320973,Paula,"Hosts were superb and tried to rectify issues quickly. 
Location was ok. Very residential neighborhood. Not a lot around. 
"
2399736,47146080,2015-09-16,34193694,Uta,"Prompt and friendly communication with Jon! He also helped us during our stay with some details.
We got, what we expected from the description and the fotos! There were also parking lots behind the house - great! "
2399736,47441098,2015-09-18,2775928,Jesse,"We had a really nice stay and I would highly recommend Luna Farm Gil Tom and Jon as great hosts! This spacious little two bedroom house was like a home away from home and very close to downtown Seattle if you have a car.  The location was convenient, our beds were super comfortable, the rooms were tastefully designed and everything was clean and organized well throughout the house. The house itself is cute and in a nice neighbourhood. The amenities were excellent although we didn't get to use them much because we were out exploring the city and enjoying the many attractions Seattle has to offer. What a nice spot! I totally recommend staying here with Luna Farm! Safe travels ~ Jesse"
2399736,48073127,2015-09-23,38404991,Kristi,"Great location, enjoyed our stay. Space was comfortable and generally clean, although could use a good deep cleaning. Kitchen was stocked with the basics. Would stay here again! Thank you"
2399736,48700914,2015-09-28,2146407,Heidi,The apartment had everything we needed for a weekend and parking in the area was so easy and convenient! I'd definitely consider booming again for a future trip to Seattle. 
2399736,50063871,2015-10-09,31748001,Mary,"This was a cute cottage as pictured.  Jon was welcoming and very quick to respond to texts.  He was flexible with our early flight arrival and  allowed us to check in early. We enjoyed sitting in the private front yard since the weather was beautiful but avoided the back since it included a view of the alley and trash receptacles. It could be very nice with a fence and a little maintenance and it IS the sunny side of the house.  The kitchen could use a couple more pieces of cookware, flatware, utensils, some paper napkins, foil, etc.  The bathroom was clean and large and only lacked kleenex and facecloths, which Jon brought over when asked.  The beds were comfy.  We wished for top sheets since the weather was unseasonably warm and the comforters were too much.  It would be nice to be able to kick them off and still have a top sheet.  We removed them from the duvet covers but it was a bit of a hassle.  
We enjoyed the location;  walked or used the #2 bus to get downtown and back.  Chuck's Hop Shop at the corner of Union was a great place with good beer and rotating food trucks.  The bus stop is just one block up and the Seattle Food Coop is within walking distance and is an awesome grocery!   "
2399736,50623975,2015-10-13,15903875,Catherine,"Lovely place to stay for a weekend.  The host had a quick response turnaround which is very appreciated.  The unit is very spacious and well lit (lots of sunlight during the day and lit doorways at night).  The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed (paper towels, dish soap, cutlery, plates, glasses, mugs, kettle, stove, oven, refrigerator, freezer).  The place was clean.  Wifi and tv worked great.  There is street parking - but if you find that parking is a bit tight for your liking, they also have reserved parking around the back of the house.  I also love how they had recycling as I hate making garbage in the landfills.  Thanks for hosting!

"
2399736,50949196,2015-10-16,9447718,Maria,Great place and amazing neighborhood. Not too far from grocery stores. Definitely we will stay there again! )
2399736,51748510,2015-10-24,12805375,Tyson,"The neighborhood is very nice. I walked around frequently and I saw cats and dogs and children and people on bicycles all over. It feels safe in the area. The house is within walking distance of many bars and restaurants if you want to go out. But there are many hills, so if you have a hard time walking it might not be as awesome as I thought it was.

I liked the space in the house, and everything I needed was there except for there wasn't any type of soap or shampoo in the shower. But they had a laundry and television with many streaming options. The kitchen had many things that I didn't use, but there were all sorts of things. The big closets with hangers were helpful. The house was a little dusty.

The house is easy to get in and out of with an automatic code operated lock, which I liked. "
2399736,52212543,2015-10-27,39828286,Inka,Thank you for a great stay in Seattle and being flexible with our check in! We loved the apartment and the vicinity. It's close to everything you need and the city centre is not far away either! Highly recommended!
2399736,53114320,2015-11-05,21540652,Marcus,"Very comfortable home, just as we saw in the pictures. Very quiet neighborhood. Comfortable bed. The green room does not heat up as much as the other rooms of the house but this is not a horrible thing. If returning to Seattle know a cool place to stay and rent again."
2399736,53597930,2015-11-10,10798781,Tim,This place was located in the cutest neighborhood. Very good location for a walk to Capitol Hill and Madrona Beach. The unit was incredibly cozy and very clean. Ubers to most point of interest cost 10 bucks at most. I highly recommend this place. It made for a very pleasant first trip to Seattle.
2399736,53959714,2015-11-15,7556498,Jane,"My partner and I enjoyed our short stay in Seattle at the Luna Farm. Luna Farm was nice and cozy with an ample 2 rooms at a very reasonable price. It's a quaint location near some great coffee shops within walking distance, like Tougo and Cortona. Most of our explorations with further out towards downtown, however, so it's a bit of a long hilly walk or take Lyft/Uber. As far as accommodations, the bed was really comfortable and the living room had a huge TV if you're staying in. Do bring your own toiletry amenities. This isn't the kind of place that is fully stocked with many bathroom or kitchen amenities. There is a washer and dryer which was convenient, especially drying some items dampened from the rain."
2399736,54258846,2015-11-17,13364462,Mitchell,"Our stay at Dahlia was perfect for our weekend in Seattle. It was in a great location for us, only a short uber ride from downtown and the stadiums. We will definitely try and stay here again the next time we come to Seattle. "
2399736,54844751,2015-11-25,25523355,Siobhan,"Fantastic place! Great location- we did not have a car but did not need one as the apartment is in a really good area- super close to the city and with great public transport only a block away. Highly recommend staying here, when I come back this will definitely be my first choice :)"
2399736,55185662,2015-11-29,4990046,Robert,"This rental is exactly as pictured/advertised. It is an older home in an established neighborhood with new paint everywhere, even on the ceilings and new vinyl floors in the kitchen and bath. The place was very quiet. It is an excellent value for the price.  The included off-street parking spot is a real benefit in a town known for it’s parking issues.

"
2399736,56044444,2015-12-08,34219067,Alannah,"We loved staying at Dahlia. Centrally located in Capitol Hill, a short Uber ride or walk (in nice weather!) from anything you could need, but still on a quiet, green, safe residential street. Keyless entry and parking were great, and check in/out was a breeze. The apartment is the ground floor level of the yellow house in the photo. It was clean and spacious and had everything we needed to enjoy our stay! Would definitely recommend staying here and would book this place again on future trips!"
2399736,56213821,2015-12-10,5672947,Chao,This is a gem in Seattle. Spacious with a cozy feeling. 5 stars. 
5446176,30453453,2015-04-22,28844128,Matthew,"After staying at Jordan's apartment I instantly loved Air BNB, an absolute palace, immaculate, fantastic location and easy to check in and out. Value for money was outstanding and the building facilities make the stay all the better.
If I'm ever back in Seattle, it'll be the first place I look up."
5446176,31019229,2015-04-30,9636598,Jason,Jordan was a great host and the condo and building could not have been nicer.   I would love to stay here again. 
5446176,32680462,2015-05-20,8356723,Yi Rong,Great apartment in great condition. Loved it!
5446176,33918586,2015-06-02,31348674,Chris,"Jordan communicated well and responded quickly to all questions and booking arrangements.  
The apartment and facilities were even better than described.  The place was clean, beds comfortable, kitchen fully equipped.  
The building is in an excellent location - easy to walk to a number of sites and restaurants. The included parking was a bonus and made it easier to have a car for my business meetings outside downtown. 
Nicer than a hotel and more relaxing to come back to after meetings. 
Would recommend this place and doing business with Jordan."
5446176,34612532,2015-06-09,34007267,Wilson,impressive is the only word that I can give
5446176,34937556,2015-06-14,28368326,Joy,"We felt very welcomed from the time we walked into the building, the concierge could not have been more helpful and welcoming. Then we went into the unit, it was just as it was advertised, clean, spacious and exactly what we were expecting. The neighborhood was walk-able and very close to the Pike Place market. With the amenities the building offered (restaurants, shops, parking), we couldn't have asked for a better situation. Jordan was always available when I had questions leading up to our stay. We will certainly come back next time we are visiting Seattle. "
5446176,35109347,2015-06-15,3501976,Rijesh,"Best location, can't beat the locale. Jordan was quick to respond Within 30 mins. Smooth Check-in smooth check out. No hassles.. I will be back at this place again. "
5446176,37752434,2015-07-10,32214081,Bo,"The information prior to arrival was perfect and all worked very well. The flat suited us and was situated in the central parts of town. 
We had a really nice stay!"
5446176,39000981,2015-07-20,32424130,Dave,"Great apartment, very convenient to top tourists attractions.  Very responsive with my needs.  I would definitely stay here again if I visit Seattle "
5446176,41746768,2015-08-09,30921666,Daisy,"This was furnished exactly as pictured, the floor plan was maybe a little different or the pictures are flipped.  It is a little cramped with 6 people if the couch is folded out, but with the couch folded up during the day it was a good size.

Everything was clean & nothing was missing.

The construction across the street woke us up earlier than we'd have liked on our vacation; we were keeping the windows open at night because of the (unusual Seattle?) heat."
5446176,50742932,2015-10-14,3634998,Jacki,"Fabulous apartment in great, central location downtown. Everything you could possibly need is provided and nicely decorated."
5446176,53676719,2015-11-11,29948914,Stephanie,"Well appointed, convenient to downtown, and warm atmosphere. Well stocked kitchen with all the touches from home. Spacious outdoor patio with great city views. Restaurant, bar, small grocery store, and coffee shop all downstairs. Fast and efficient check in. Jordan was quick and attentive with our questions. Looking forward to staying here again. "
7500728,41009011,2015-08-03,39352160,Casey,"We had a great experience here. The land is beautifully and inuquely landscaped. There are plenty of areas to relax outside. The studio itself is very well decorated. There was shampoo and conditioner, coffee, cooking utensils....anything we needed to be comfortable. It was hotter than usual that weekend, so the loft got a little warm at night. The owner promptly bought a fan for us. Communication with Briar was easy and fast.
It was a short drive into downtown, but we were happy to be in a suburban area rather than a huge hotel. We will probably stay here again if we're ever in Seattle. I highly reccomend it."
7500728,41471680,2015-08-07,39483201,Michael,"Very cute, clean and comfortable! After a bit of a rough start -- limited internet for the first day, only street parking -- we adjusted and had a good experience. The bed loft was nice and private, but you definitely need to watch your head (only forgot once). Classy decor. Great kitchen. An amazing amount of storage. The washer and dryer in the unit were perfect. The unit has everything you need for an extended stay or a pit stop in the middle of a longer trip. The grounds are filled with lots of plants and moss-covered furniture sculptures. Lots of privacy, too. Easy freeway access to Seattle and beyond, plus public transit only a few blocks away. The neighborhood is quiet and working class in a quaint kind of way. Our host was very responsive and helpful, and I'm glad we finally got to meet in person! We would definitely stay there again."
7500728,42025834,2015-08-10,21885794,Megan,"Although we never met her on our trip, Briar was really easy to communicate with! The Cottage is SUPER cute and a perfect size for 2 ! Everything was clean and the kitchen was well stocked. Also the light rail station is less than 10 minutes away; such an easy walk! There is a grocery store, coffee shop and many restaurants and bars all within a few blocks. I would highly recommend this space!"
7500728,42745254,2015-08-15,27624058,Alex,Briar's place was very nice and very close to downtown. Only a 15 min drive. Place was very clean as well. We had a great time staying at your place. 
7500728,43540944,2015-08-20,6392456,Shelley,Great cottage and location. 
7500728,44205924,2015-08-24,28932526,Megan,"We LOVED this place!  It was so comfortable and fun to stay in.  The cottage itself is pin-drop quiet, tastefully decorated and complete with everything you'd need.  It's surrounded by an amazing, peaceful garden.  The location was great, too.  Within a half-block is a corner with a few restaurants and a Victrola coffee shop.  And getting downtown was extremely easy.   Host was super easy and quick to communicate with.  We had a great experience and would highly recommend."
7500728,45119908,2015-08-31,39633909,Aria  Joe,Never met our host
7500728,46216086,2015-09-08,21580419,Jeremy,"Briar was a nice host and the cottage was clean, cozy and well-designed. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. 

The neighborhood wasn't as vibrant commercially as others in Seattle, but we really liked it. There were several fantastic restaurants nearby and we were within walking distance of the industrial are, which had some very cool stores and spots. Even capitol hill and other Seattle tourist areas were nicely within striking distance via Uber and buses.

If you're looking for a really nice, cozy, tasteful place off the beaten path but still accessible to wider Seattle, this is a great spot. "
7500728,47080323,2015-09-15,31458671,Ajani,"A great serene detached spot with a lot of personality. Clean and well maintained, it definitely provided a much needed break from long days of exploring Seattle. Super close to transit, as we used the light rail to get around everywhere."
7500728,49015933,2015-09-30,41826293,Ev,"Listing description was accurate. This is indeed a great little garden cottage, with a nice kitchen area and a loft bed, actually. Nice seating areas outside, as well. The weather was excellent when we were there, so we totally took advantage of outdoor seating. Briar was communicative; had a little issue with the key pad so we went ol' skool with a key, but she let us know what was happening. Also had a wi-fi issue the first day, but she let us know and had it fixed by the second day. No biggie on that; we were out sight-seeing!

Note to others--it's in the Beacon Hill area, which is a few miles south/southwest of downtown/Capitol Hill. Public transportation is probably the best way to go (if you drive, Beacon Hill to 15th which becomes 12th takes you to the heart of Capitol Hill and then shoot down any of those streets to downtown) simply because parking in Seattle is expensive. And if you drive the alt-route I suggest above you avoid the 5 which is heinous most of the time. There's no parking charge in the neighborhood where this place is, but you probably won't be in front (around the corner, actually) and streets are narrow. Next time, I'm totally going public transportation.

This is also a quiet residential area, and the main house in front has people living in it. They were very courteous and quiet, and we were, too. After long days of conferencing and sight-seeing, it was really nice to come back to this place, which is really private, and totally chill. We bought groceries at the Red Apple market about a half-mile down Beacon Hill and had food and snacks (and local wine!) waiting for us every evening. All in all, this was a great place and I'm very glad I was able to schedule it on the days we needed it. P.S. also had a great view of the Blood Moon on Sunday night from the back yard! P.P.S. the closet under the stairs is great, but if you're tall, be careful in there."
7500728,49781717,2015-10-06,21805831,Matthew,"We enjoyed our stay in this cozy little place. It is located in a quiet neighborhood that's close by car or rail to many of Seattle's major attractions. Be aware that parking is on the street but we never had trouble finding a spot less than a block away. We didn't meet Briar in person but she was a communicative and friendly host throughout our stay. Tastefully appointed, secure, and well-stocked with essentials, we would we recommend this place for sure."
7500728,50347398,2015-10-11,25557499,Ramon,Great place and really good location. The place was very roomy and checking in and out was very easy. 
7500728,51510447,2015-10-20,25910322,Thomas,"This was a nice place to spend the weekend, just a few blocks from the Beacon Hill Link Station. The cottage was clean, and the bed was very comfortable. The only drawback is the jet engine noise from the planes flying overhead. We brought a fan with us to drown out the noise at night."
7500728,52629019,2015-10-31,11018932,Stephen & Sara,"We had a great stay in this backyard cottage. It was comfortable and quiet, with a well-equipped kitchen and good wifi. We had our car and never had an issue finding parking on the street. Briar was quick to respond to questions and checking in & out was simple. All in all, a nice little place!"
1696015,10781410,2014-03-07,12000067,Els,"Het huis ligt werkelijk op een prachtige plek. Het is wel een wat ouder huis, wat op de foto's niet te zien is. Het heeft wat onderhoud nodig. Gastvrijheid wordt door de eigenaar heel belangrijk gevonden; het huis kent dan ook vele extra's. Helaas hebben wij wat ongemakken ondervonden; de gastheer vond dit heel vervelend en heeft ons een 'reimbursement for this inconvenience' aangeboden. Hij heeft toegezegd een cheque te sturen. Die is nog niet gearriveerd....."
1696015,11748954,2014-04-14,12755235,Katherine,BEST vacation and 1st time to Seattle!  This house was perfect for our family!  We had 10 people total and we all fit just fine.  The view cannot be beat!  The owner as well as the property manager were absolutely fantastic and very easy to work with as well as prompt and helpful.  My family and I would love to stay here again and would recommend this property and owner.  Thank you for making our trip so easy and wonderful!
1696015,12582458,2014-05-05,8534462,Daniela,"We had a fantastic time here. When the tide is low there's a nice beach in front of the home and when it is high, you get the pleasant and tranquil ocean background ambience at night. It's also really close to a Palisade, a great restaurant around the corner if you like to go out and comes with a grill if you'd like to BBQ on the deck. Overall a great experience and we'd definitely love to come back here again."
1696015,14739538,2014-06-25,14366401,Jaime,My family and I are so happy we decided to book this house instead of opting for separate hotel rooms. We felt the location was perfect and close to downtown without all the chaos of downtown. We had a fire by the water at sunset and enjoyed our company. Everything was clean and comfortable! Thank you for having us! 
1696015,15976060,2014-07-19,17039885,Angela,"The location is fabulous, the view phenomenal! The inside of the home is very well appointed and the furnishings not only eclectic and attractive, but surprisingly comfortable.  The sound washes right up to the lower patio at high tide and the binoculars provided made watching the wildlife and passing ships quite entertaining.

The home has the all the charm that comes with having an older home.  Since it is in the WA, there is no air conditioner and not all windows have screens, but the fans provided made some of the hottest summer days of the season comfortable, especially in the evenings when the air cooled.   The very rocky beach meant that we didn't walk the beach much, but certainly enjoyed sitting on the patio enjoying the breeze and views.

Overall we enjoyed our stay immensely and Mary was absolutely wonderful to work with.
  "
1696015,18875327,2014-09-02,15976701,Matteen,"The real truth:  the house was good, not great, but good.   but you are not renting this house for the house itself, you are renting it for the incredible view and the fantastic getaway feel it provides.

It's on a secluded road (use Apple Maps, b/c Google Maps sent everyone to the wrong place) It's on a secluded road, with a stunning view of Puget Sound, the view of Mount Rainier, the sound of the water, the seals, the birds, the air...

I built a fire each night in the firepit and we all watched the sunset...   We even saw the moonset the very last night...  it was great."
1696015,21697192,2014-10-22,11541905,Barbara,"The beach house is the perfect place for anyone who wants to kick back, relax, and enjoy the best views in the city.  The sunsets are spectacular, and while you have a lot of privacy, at the same time, you're only a short walk into the town of Magnolia and a fifteen minute drive into downtown Seattle.  The house itself has everything you'll need and lots of room for a lot of people.  The beds are comfortable, the kitchen is well equipped, and the sound of the tide lapping against the patio off the first floor gives you the sense that you're on your own private boat in the Bay.  To seal the deal, the host is very accommodating and easy to work with, and Mary, his property manager, is a sheer delight.  I would highly recommend this property to anyone who wants to make the most of their stay in the Emerald City."
1696015,21954047,2014-10-27,14253023,Joseph T.,"Absolutely sensational vista view and atmosphere! It would be perfectly summarized as a well-stocked home AND a get-a-away for relaxation.  Our accommodation was extremely well-prepared & make comfortable by Mary, the property manager, thank you very much!  As residence of both San Francisco and Honolulu's ocean view, our stay here gave us the added spectacular view of Northwest's beauty. "
1696015,27568466,2015-03-07,5909725,Paul,The reservation was canceled 19 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1696015,28034405,2015-03-16,639943,Shari,"We had a family gathering in Seattle and while my husband and I live on the Olympic Peninsula, it was too far to be traveling back and forth daily.  
This home was a great solution for us and we very much enjoyed our stay.
Our contact was Mary, the receptionist for the owner and she did a wonderful job of communicating promptly and answering any questions that came up.
The location is wonderful being right on the waters edge of Puget Sound.  The sight, sound and smell of the sea was charming and soothing.
The property is a very well equipped and a somewhat quirky older home.  It is actually two stories and there are 29 stairs to walk down to access the home.  This is something to consider if you have seniors as we did.  Someone in a wheelchair would not be able to get to the house at all.  I had forgotten to inquire so no fault to the owner.  And fortunately, our seniors where able to negotiate the stairs.
On the first floor is a very well stocked kitchen, something I greatly appreciated!  All the cookware, dishes, glasses, toaster, silverware, and knives, enough to cook for a group, which we did.  There was also one bedroom and a bath on that floor. As well as a large open dining room/living room with wide open views of the water as well as a fireplace and wood provided too!   In addition, there is access to a deck on two sides of the first floor.
On the lower level are another bathroom and two bedrooms.  There is a door through one of the bedrooms which allows access to the beach and a sitting area with a fire pit surrounded by several aderondack chairs.  Wish our stay had been longer to have been able to use it.
If you are looking for new and contemporary this is not the place.  If on the other hand you enjoy charming, quirky and older, then this might be the location for you.
One other thing I should mention is that the area where this home is located is down a secluded road with only one way in or out and there is parking for only one vehicle.  There is more parking on an adjoining street about a half block away.
All in all, we very much enjoyed our stay and would recommend this home."
1696015,32111606,2015-05-14,28998955,Dustin,"William and his assistant Mary were very helpful with everything my group needed for our visit.  We had plenty of wood for the patio fire pit, the kitchen had all the supplies we needed for cooking and serving, everything worked."
1696015,37073415,2015-07-04,32597425,Suzy,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Ocean Front Beach House.  The view of the Puget Sound is incredible, the house was comfortable and the neighbors were friendly.  I would absolutely recommend this rental and would come stay there again."
1696015,44917555,2015-08-30,20336586,Alan,"We had a wonderful stay at this great beach house right on Eliot Bay. On low tide you can walk along the beach in the morning. Sit out by the fire pit in the evening and look at the stars
The house is very well equipped. on private road. Very spacious with 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. Large outdoor grill and several outside sitting areas to eat meals and look out at the water
The hosts were wonderful and immediately responsive to any questions
We'll be back!!"
1696015,46125244,2015-09-08,31052694,Stephanie,"Great house!  Unbeatable views, comfortable furniture and beds, quiet but for the sound of the ocean.  Pretty conveniently located as well.  Would come back here in a heartbeat!"
1696015,52892304,2015-11-02,6975773,Vibhu,"We had a family get together here for Halloween with 3 kids under 5 years. The hosts were awesomely accommodating, allowing us to check in early and checkout late. The place itself is heaven - right on the puget sound (ocean with spectacular island views). The house is a bit old but very cozy and had everything we needed. Our family loved our 3 night stay here. "
38545,141073,2010-11-18,89954,Anji,"Just returned from Seattle and was so grateful to have found this location on Airbnb. The house is perfect! Very well done, clean, open and accommodating. The rooms are really comfortable, beds perfect! Great kitchen perfect for entertaining. The location is within walking distance to great restaurants, shopping. You could rent a car as there is parking at the house..but no need. Very close to downtown Seattle and the University area. Seth was a great host and a really great communicator.
Thank you!"
38545,171913,2011-01-18,316819,Jenny,"I just returned from a trip to Seattle with 8 of my girlfriends and I have to say that we really had a lovely time at 3815 Interlake Ave. Aside from being tastefully decorated and super trendy, it had adequate towels, sheets, kitchen supplies to accommodate all of us. 9 girls is kind of a lot (There was no extra person charge!)  The location was great too, really close to everything we went to- Pike's Place Market, Coffee Crawl tour, Fremont Troll, Gas Works Park, Space Needle. We also went to see the Harry Potter exhibit at the Pacific Science Center. That was alot of fun. And we ate dinner in the Fremont area as well (where the house is located). It's a really cute area!

Thanks again to Seth for accommodating us! The house was a great hangout spot after a long day of exploring the city. We really enjoyed our stay, it's perfect!"
38545,229570,2011-04-18,360444,Scott,"The house is very nicely appointed with upscale finishes and stocked with towels, toiletries, coffee maker, etc.  There were six of us who came to Seattle for a conference downtown. Since the house is situated only a block away from a bus stop, the commute downtown is approx. 20 minutes so there is no need to rent a car to get around. Also tons of restaurants and shops within a mile or two from the house. Seth was always very responsive and helpful when there were any questions needed to be answered. Everything worked out fine. "
38545,290146,2011-05-31,489296,Rj,"Great location!  Clean and inviting, excellent place to stay - feels just like home!  Would definitely stay again."
38545,316463,2011-06-15,642512,Anne,The Cube house was a great place to stay! We were a big group in town for a UW graduation and this house was a great place to entertain and house all our family under one roof. Location was great! It was very close to the Wallingford area for some great food and also very near the heart of the city. We enjoyed our stay and Seth was a wonderful host who was very quick to respond to any questions or concerns. Thanks Seth! Your house is amazing! We highly recommend the Cube!
38545,611325,2011-10-09,1118988,Hans,"House was great. Convenient, super clean and very cool! Was the perfect spot to put up some of our work team - particularly since it's easy walking distance to the Fremont office. "
38545,659571,2011-10-24,1257311,David,This is a beautiful and stylish modern home just a few short blocks from Lake Union. Very quick and easy access to downtown or university area. Three levels with a private master bedroom. Kitchen well appointed. Great off-street parking. Will stay here again. 
38545,697087,2011-11-06,1363298,Megan,"Comfortable bedding and awesome showers the biggest plus. Seth was communicative and remained available for questions.  If you feel like shelling out and have a cush place to stay, contact Seth and experience ~the cube!~"
38545,736506,2011-11-21,1410686,Lindsay,Awesome Host! Modern house with all the comforts of home! The kitchen is top notch and the decor is hip and trendy! Very close to everything we wanted to do! We will be back!   
38545,802241,2011-12-23,1403287,Dean,"I definitely recommend this place, as well as Seth as the host. He was great and timely with all the communication and info, and place was exactly what we wanted and expected.Great location, awesome 3 levels, with a charming balcony, we had no complains whatsoever."
38545,877060,2012-01-22,771999,John,"Seth has a fantastic place: spacious, super well appointed, and entirely comfortable. He's a gracious host, too, accommodating me at the very last moment. I hope a have a chance to stay here again soon."
38545,965150,2012-03-02,1226021,Todd,"Hard to imagine a better place to set up camp in Seattle.
Seth's place is everything, and more, that you see in the pictures.
Very clean and the location is perfect.  Centrally located.  

I also took advantage of the fact that his place is located a few short blocks from one of my favorite teachers Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche and his Nalandabodhi Center.

Seth was very gracious and responsive.  The only thing that made it less than perfect...... was having to leave it behind! "
38545,974101,2012-03-06,1824674,Benjamin,"I came home from a long deployment, staying in the Tacoma area, I wanted a little RnR retreat with my girlfriend but didn't want to travel.  Seth provided a warm and comforting environment, his home was immaculate, clean and modern.  He is an understanding host, and is very personable, I had no issues what so ever and I look forward to staying at his other residence."
38545,995715,2012-03-13,938249,Jordan,Once those floors got hot... total dream!  The house is AWESOME.  Great experience!

38545,1032932,2012-03-22,1921402,Olivia,"Seth was very accommodating!
The place was spotless and he responded in a very timely manner. He even asked if we knew the area. 
5 Stars!
Would definitely stay here again."
38545,1131455,2012-04-15,1820668,Tom,Great place to stay with family or group of friends. Easy to get downtown with buses. 
38545,1141261,2012-04-16,2128895,Cory,"Our stay at Modern and Green was perfect. The place was clean, well designed, and comfortable. The neighborhood is great and it is very close to a ton of fun stuff - we even took a nice walk to Gasworks Park and a long late night walk back from Dick's (driving wasn't an option). The communication with Seth was timely and effective. Book this place!"
38545,1180007,2012-04-25,2079867,Kaew,The house is perfectly fit our big family with huge space. The decoration is nicely modern. All facilities have served us so well. Seth has given us a nice stay.

Even though we did not get to meet in person, he was great to work with and really made everything go smoothly.

38545,1315233,2012-05-21,1778444,Nik And Amy,"We had an fantastic week staying at Seth's house.  From booking to check-in to easy checking and all the comfort and communication in between, this rental could not have gone better.  A couple coworkers and I shared the house during a business trip and were overwhelmingly pleased.  I highly recommend this house not only because it's central but because it's an insanely better value than any hotel in the area.  Thanks to Seth for clearly documenting everything and providing such a great overall experience."
38545,1716363,2012-07-16,1755632,Ellis,"This rental was perfect for my family. Its comfortable, has everything you need. Check in went as planned and Seth was responsive and available when we had questions. This house is in a great neighborhood - you can walk to the Fremont Troll, Gasworks Park, the shops and restaurants on Fremont Ave and 45th Ave. Its a short drive to Ballard Locks and Golden Gardens Park.  Its also easy to get downtown and to I-5.  We would gladly stay here again.

"
38545,2363469,2012-09-21,3455474,Noelle,"My parents, brother and I stayed at this house for 9 days and we all think that this house is perfect for us! The house is very clean when we arrived. The three queen size beds are comfortable with many pillows and clean linens on. The kitchen is well equipped with kitchenwares. And we like the modern style of the house!"
38545,2581675,2012-10-11,170746,Cindy,"We had a marvelous stay at Seth's. The house was comfortable & clean. The location is very convenient and the neighborhood is charming. Seth provided plenty of linens, towels and even little hotel soaps! He was very responsive and answered any questions we had. Would definitely recommend to friends & family. "
38545,2649030,2012-10-18,899589,Alex,"Unfortunately, i have to be the odd person out here. My wife and i stayed here Oct 2012 for my birthday and found it extremely disappointing. The house was dirty, in need of repair, and we didn't find Seth to be concerned with much more than to make sure he got his money. ( to be clear, he did offer to refund the $100 cleaning fee and send new cleaning crew.)
Although the house is obviously new and lay out exactly as described, it was pretty dirty upon arrival. (I was later informed by seth that the cleaner he uses had quit the day prior without his knowledge) There weren't things strewn all over the place, on the contrary the place was picked up but there was definitely a thin layer of film and dust on just about everything. 
The kitchen(which, to be honest was the main reason we chose this house) was pretty gross. The range was dirty, oven was in need of a thorough cleaning, the hood was splattered with grease, dishes were filmy and had food dried on them. the cupboards had fingerprints and food stuck to them, and the exterior of the garbage can was disgusting.
The bathrooms were also not really cleaned, more ""wiped down with a dirty cloth""
The house itself is in need of some repair, lightbulbs burnt out, door handles on some doors missing, ever wall in the place has black markings up and down it from previous renters luggage. 
Lastly, the mattress a couple previous renters raved about is an IKEA cotton slab similar to a futon mattress.
Since it was a late check-in, we didnt have a ton of options for the first night, we cleaned ourselves the worst of it and  I contacted Seth early the the next morning alerting him of the problems and that we all in all would just prefer to move. He offered to send out another cleaning crew(who in all fairness did a pretty good job)but was unwilling to refund us the nights not stayed because he needed to make sure they were rented and paid for. I, personally, don't find this attitude professional or acceptable. If someone was unhappy at my place and clearly wanted to leave and felt i had misrepresented the rental, i would by all means let them out and refund the difference. 
all in all we moved to a hotel, (FYI - the Four Seasons downtown is actually the same price/nt) the second night and ate the cost. it just wasn't worth the hassel.  The place looks like someone's private home gem in the pics, and with a little maintenance, would be great but as for now, it is a turn and burn style 100% rental property with a greedy host."
38545,2667242,2012-10-20,3630144,Jay,"Seth is very responsive and the place is really swanky.  So good, we're booking it again for 2 whole weeks!"
38545,2742306,2012-10-28,3960818,Armon,"Awesome place, and awesome stay!"
38545,4957316,2013-06-03,3922279,Robert,We had a great stay at Seth's place. It was a beautiful and comfortable house. So much to see/do in the neighborhood. Highly recommended.
38545,5078810,2013-06-11,1873634,James,"I had a great time staying at the house. My family and I stayed there as part of a celebration for my parents' 50th wedding anniversary. It was cheaper than getting three hotel rooms, and much more enjoyable. It's great to stay in an actual neighborhood and be able to walk to excellent restaurants, bars and coffee shops. The house is so well located that we didn't even need to rent a car while we were there. There are many bus routes nearby that can get you to most any part of town that you could want to go to. We also enjoyed walking around the neighborhood and seeing the many lovely front yard gardens. And oh yeah! Gas Works park - a short walk for a fantastic view of the city."
38545,5752847,2013-07-15,6358808,Jenny,"I recently rented Seth's house with my husband and his family. (7 of us). We were in the area for a wedding and found the house to be cheaper and a lot nicer than a hotel. The house is well equipped with everything you will need and in a great neighborhood. There are lots of options for safe and scenic running/walking routes from the front door and plenty of places to eat and shop near by.  Downtown is an easy 10 minute commute. 
I would absolutely recommend this place and stay there again. Seth is very quick to answer any questions you may have and a great host!"
38545,6453486,2013-08-13,3416191,MaraBeth,"We had a great stay at this location!  It was appointed with all of the necessities and fit six of us easily. We really enjoyed the modern design of the building, the openness and cleanliness.

The location was ideal -- one block from a major bus route, an easy walk to Fremont Center (& brewery), and another easy walk toward Wallingford (Molly Moon's ice cream). The parking space was a big plus, though we found the quiet street was also good for parking.

Highly recommended accommodations!"
38545,6652094,2013-08-20,1450466,Filip,"The modern house is not suitable for 3 adult couples but rather for a family with children. It has 3 bedrooms: one nice bedroom with a comfortable bed and adjoining bathroom, two bedrooms downstairs: one bedroom with a comfortable bed and a non-equipped room with a mattress on the floor and a bedside table with broken lamp. This room is only suitable for young childeren.
We were disappointed with  the last room and called Seth by phone to ask if he could help us, maybe advice about a hotel/B&B accommodation nearby. He was staying in San Francisco and said that he could do nothing  for us??  Later he sent literal the following message : I'm sorry you don't feel that the home is as described.  I e-mail airbnb and have been trying to reach them to see if they have any suggestions.  It might be possible to have a bed frame delivered tomorrow.
But after this message nothing happened??? Finally we found  for one couple  an expensive hotelroom downtown for the next nights.
Furthermore, the house only has 4 chairs to sit down. Consequently, you can not all sit down to eat and on the terrace you will found only 3 deck chairs. The rest of guests has to stand up for dinner, souper or breakfast????
Another minus was the smelly towels. We had to wash a few times before we could use them.
The description on the site is confusing:
On the right of the site there is mentioned as Bed type: real bed 
In the text you will found the following discription;:
Ground level has two bedrooms - each room has queen size bed, one opens up to a cute patio.....

Conclusion: 
it was our worst experience ever on customer care and welcoming.

We ( 3 couples) booked  for 5 nights the house of Seth and the price was :
Accommodation €1968  
Airbnb Service €118 
Total €2086

38545,9107265,2013-12-07,1485946,Tu,"For what it's worth, here's a review of Seth's pad coming from a Seattleite's perspective.  For reference, my wife and I work/live/play in Seattle, and are on the lower end of our 30's.

We recently found ourselves homeless for 4 days due to delays in the construction of our new home.  We saw that Seth's place was available for the dates we needed and immediately submitted a reservation request.  We received confirmation from Seth within 30 minutes, which was quite nice since we were in a time-sensitive situation.

Seth's town-home is really an amazing piece of property.  When we arrived the place was spotless, inviting, and incredibly spacious.  The kitchen has a great gas range and is more than adequately equipped with cookware/flatware to prepare any type of meal.  The leather couch in the living room is deceptively comfortable, as we spend many hours just lounging around like vegetable in front of his huge wall mounted tv.  Check the closets downstairs and there are a few throw blankets to cuddle up with.  Seth has radiant heating on the 2nd floor of his place.  If you haven't experienced the magic of radiant floor heating in sub-30 degree Seattle weather, you really are missing out on something special.  My favorite part of the house though was the shower in the master suite.  The shower has a rain-head with great pressure, and 3 body jets that hit you from the sides making it feel like you are standing in a car wash.  I came home from a long day of snowboarding during our stay and can tell you that stepping into that shower was sublime.  

As for the location, Seth's place is pretty much in the heart of Fremont.  It is situated on an incredibly quiet street with ample street parking which was great since we had 2 vehicles with us.  He lives minutes from some of the best places to eat in Fremont.  Here are the places that we ate at during our little stay-cation. Locals and tourists DO NOT miss the following, all within 4 min drive of the house:

I would recommend Seth's rental to almost anyone, as is location has so much to offer.  If you are like us and like music and nightlife, Fremont is home to numerous bars and live music venues merely a stone's throw away.  If you have a family and are traveling with children, Gas Works Park, the Troll, and the Zoo are all within a few minutes drive.  If you are trying to decide between this place and ANY hotel room in the city, stay here.  The a room at the 4-Seasons is at least $300 on a weekend, and does not come with 3 bathrooms.  A downtown hotel WILL charge you $80 per night to park 2 vehicles vs. FREE at Seth's.  Logistically, this house is in the center of it all.

Happy to give 5 stars for a great rental.

38545,9697980,2014-01-05,10956766,Steven,Seth's place was the perfect spot for my friends and I to take a short vacation in Seattle. The place was beautiful and tastefully decorated and I was met with the utmost professionalism from Seth. We contacted Seth relatively late as a last minute decision for a trip and he made every effort to accommodate us. If you are looking for a place to stay in Seattle I would definitely recommend contacting Seth!
38545,9946587,2014-01-20,879415,Christine,"Really cool, modern condo with a super quiet location (but just around the corner from bagels!). We met Seth upon arrival and he gave us a tour, great guy. The kitchen in this place is a standout amenity; it's massive, and well-equipped: Seth had just gotten all new pots and pans. But we also thought the rain shower lovely (he even provides organic toiletries) and the bed ultra comfortable. Oh yeah and the TV is huuuuuuge :) Highly recommended, particularly as a hotel alternative b/c downtown is 10 min away by bus."
38545,10171174,2014-02-03,1721643,Rosemary,"Our stay at Seth's house was great! The design of the house is beautiful and the location is perfect. We went to Ivan's salmon restaurant for dinner and Portage Bay Cafe for breakfast, both also highly recommended. Everything at this house was easy, and there are directions provided to make sure your stay is comfortable. "
38545,10241590,2014-02-08,6771585,Jason,"Seth's place is terrific - very comfortable, clean and upscale.  It is also nested near Wallingford and Freemont, two of my favorite Seattle neighborhoods.  It really is a great place and exactly what I was looking for.  And Seth has made the renting experience simple and streamlined, and was quick to respond to any questions I had.

I would highly recommend Seth and his property."
38545,10343308,2014-02-14,7490340,Ben,Seth was quick and very helpful with our last minute stay! House was awesome and very centrally located. Thanks again!
38545,10579400,2014-02-25,5872825,Marshall,"Place is fantastic.  Location is great.  In fact, location allowed us to explore an area other than downtown.   Would stay here again in a heartbeat.  Thanks Seth.  "
38545,10929751,2014-03-13,6112200,Ye,"Had a great stay at the house. The place is very nice, cozy and well-furnished. The  neighborhood is pretty nice and have some nice eateries nearby (paseo, revel, the whale wins). Seth is extremely helpful and responsive. Definitely recommend!"
38545,11501367,2014-04-05,7242027,Jason,"This is an easy story to tell. Arrived, stayed and left with no problems. Ideal cyclist location for exploring lake Washington / mercer island etc. A foodie would freak out at the two placed we went to right by the apt. The accommodations were wonderful, modern and comfortable. I would stay again. "
38545,12981577,2014-05-16,5697185,Erin,Seth was a great host and responded quickly to all inquiries! The place was just how he described and was perfect for our group.

38545,13875960,2014-06-07,12827392,Patrick,"It was a great experience staying in this condo. One of our guest has to arrive before check-in time so I emailed Seth. That is not a problem. The condo was ready and clean. It is spacious for 6 people. There is a reserved parking space in the back but most of the time we just parked on the street. We did not bother Seth at all because we do not need any help.
To perspective guests, the location is convenient but having a car is necessary. It is perfect for 6 adults, although there is an air-mattress in the closet."
38545,13971464,2014-06-09,1948456,Justin,My family and I (4 of us) had a very nice stay at this house.  It was really comfortable and in a great location -- quick to downtown and UW campus.  Seth was responsive from beginning to end.  Highly recommended!

Seth's instructions were meticulous, we got there, parked and got in without having to guess what to do next."
38545,15544373,2014-07-11,4333824,Justin,This is a great apartment in a cool part of Seattle. The house was super clean and well furnished. There was great communication with Seth before and during our stay. I wish I could have stayed longer.
38545,16608550,2014-07-30,15425425,Brandye,"Seth was great and very quick to respond to emails and text. His home was very nice and had everything we needed. The neighborhood was close to shops, restaurants and public transportation. We had a great experience!"

38545,17590178,2014-08-14,19337036,Jason,"Thanks to Seth and his place in Seattle we had a great first Airbnb experience. He was very clear in all his details, forgiving of a rookie mistake of checking in too early, and the place was not only just a described but great. Plenty of room and bed. Good wireless coverage. A nice kitchen and bathrooms. Private parking. And convenient to some great spots in town. Right around the corner from some great restaurants that we were able to walk to. We had a great time!"
38545,18112403,2014-08-22,10846086,Ryan,"Had a great stay at Seth's place in Seattle.   Really nice neighborhood and its close to public transportation.   Seth was easy to communicate with during the trip,  would definitely recommend.   "
38545,18937860,2014-09-03,14906206,Jeremy,"Stayed 12 nights in Seattle at Seth's home. The place was even better than the pictures. We found it in good condition, very clean and welcoming. I have nothing but good things to say about the home and Seth as well. He was very quick in responding to messages and was able to help with every issue and question I had. I would definitely stay here again."
38545,19200039,2014-09-08,18150048,Calin,"First time Airbnb user and the experience was excellent. House was exactly as described in listing. Host was readily available throughout my stay and I can't express how beautiful the space is. What an incredible location! No issues with parking whatsoever. 

"
38545,20384304,2014-09-28,21508168,Susan,"Our family had a wonderful stay in Seth's Wallingford, Seattle home.  Seth was very quick to respond to emails and texts before, during and after our visit.  We enjoyed the easy parking, amazing restaurants on 45th, great access to UW,  room to stretch our legs after a full day, fully equipped kitchen, giant TV, comfortable beds and amazing showers.   It was such a treat to have a large beautiful home to enjoy.  Thank you Seth!"
38545,22316735,2014-11-03,22310021,Eric,"Seth's place was great. The house was as pictured and we had no issues during our stay. We enjoyed the modern and very cool setup, and its location in the city made our sight seeing and travels easy. Seth was very accommodating for our group, as we were only able to stay for a 3 night visit, and he had prepared all the linens and towels in advance. Parking was not a problem, as it had a reserved spot in the back, and as other reviewers have commented, the steep gravel might pose a challenge for small or low to the ground vehicles. Our 6-person group really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this location for anyone seeking a nice stay in Seattle."
38545,22658418,2014-11-11,848479,Eric,The location was great . Seths unit was very nice ! The unit was not as clean as we are used to . 
38545,22951344,2014-11-18,2159920,Matsvei,An awesome apartment in a nice neighborhood. Me and two of my colleagues really enjoyed our stay. Key transaction went smoothly. Nothing to complain about. Will try to book next time I am in Seattle. 
38545,27489632,2015-03-06,21662558,佳,The house is big enough for a family like us. We spent 3 months in there. There's a lot of memories. The location is good too. It's very convenient for me to go to downtown Seattle.
38545,30748161,2015-04-26,29111671,Steven,"Host was very accommodating and was a wealth of information for the local area. Professional yet friendly demeanour. Eager to help out with problems and answer questions. Would recommend to anyone looking for a  house with modern decor, a spacious common area and a convenient location."
38545,35443799,2015-06-18,36083079,Reid,"Seth's house was fantastic, super clean, and a short walk from nearby coffee shops and good eats. If you're looking for a place in Seattle, this is it!"
38545,37377228,2015-07-06,15028995,Francine,Listing was accurate and the neighborhood was nice and quiet.  
38545,38400638,2015-07-15,9316775,Charlie,"Fabulous home!  Huge ""wow factor"" in the quality of the home and furnishings.  We really loved the neighborhood too!  Lots of great cafes and restaurants within a couple blocks.  For runners/bikers you can easily access the trail that parallels the waterway between Lake Union and the Ballard Locks.

Seth is a great host!  He communicates quickly with and is very helpful.  The house was immaculately clean and ready in every way for our family.  We had a great time staying in his home!"
38545,57742993,2015-12-28,4898363,Marjorie,"Great place!!  Beautiful, modern and clean!!"
3403858,15841182,2014-07-16,14678013,David,"Lauren & Matt accommodated our every need, made us feel welcome and at home. The house is nested into a great location in West Seattle.  You can walk up to California street and have great coffee or food at Admiral Bird or stroll down through the park ending up at Alki Beach for food, drinks and people watching. The warmth and charm of this older craftsman house seduces you, relax and enjoy."
3403858,16123306,2014-07-22,14652107,Tracey,"We can't wait to come back! Lauren was such a great host! She went out of her way to accommodate our family, even leaving special touches for us upon our arrival.  

The house is very well appointed for a family of four but could also accommodate four adults fairly easily. We have two young children (8 and 3) and the second bedroom was perfect for them with a twin bed and toddler bed. Although, I think Lauren mentioned being able to switch the toddler bed out for a twin if it isn't wanted.   

The bathroom is amazing and the large tub made bath time with the kids really easy. The kitchen is also very well stocked and we had everything we needed to feel like we were at home - which was really a major upside for us versus staying in a hotel. Our stay at Lauren's place was also the second leg of a two-week trip to the Northwest so we really appreciated having access to a high-end washer and dryer. 

The eclectic northwest decor makes the home feel posh but comfortable and there was plenty of space for us to all spread out. The home is located close to both Alki and Alaska Junction so walking on the beach or going to some of the great shops on California were a very short drive (less than a mile) away.  The water taxi to downtown Seattle was also a short drive. The neighborhood is safe and has a great family feel. The house also sits above the street so letting the kids play in the front yard without being concerned about traffic was really nice. 

Our family frequently rents vacation homes  on VRBO or Airbnb and I have to say this was by far one of our favorite places-to-date! The home was as it was listed and our host, Lauren, couldn't have been nicer.  You really cannot go wrong renting this home and we cannot wait for our next stay in West Seattle! "
3403858,16323009,2014-07-25,18169682,Maximilian,"We stayed at the curtis's House for 3 days and had a really Great Time. The Mixture of cosy and calm-down area in West seattle in combination with the opportunity to Access downtown by Public transportation so fast was the ideal Solution to experience seattle within three days.
The House is very well equipped and gives a very cosy feeling.
We definitly recommend Taking the Chance to Stay a view days at this lovely Place."
3403858,16487747,2014-07-28,2547661,Ray,"This beautiful, comfortable home was an absolutely ideal experience during my recent trip to Seattle for my brother's wedding. 

The owners were quick to respond and accommodating. The home itself was spotlessly clean and was decorated in a relaxed though classy style. In other words, everything is very nice, but in a way that allows you to put your guard down and your feet up. There were plenty of pleasant spots to relax. 

All the amenities were exactly as advertised. This home was ideal for our party of four, but could easily host at least a couple more guests. My mom, who has a handicap, had no difficulty getting around. She appreciated having her own half-bath off of the master bedroom. The main bathroom is spacious, with a large tub and shower. The kitchen is perfectly functional, which is really what you want from a kitchen. It was great having a washer and dryer right on the main floor. The patio is a marvelous sanctuary. 

We loved the quiet neighborhood, with its charming northwest bungalows set among the hills of West Seattle. The house is ideally located next to a city park that has one of the only remaining old growth forests in Seattle. A 20 minute walk through the park takes you just a couple blocks from Alki Beach, a super-cool spot that reminds me of Santa Cruz, CA. And West Seattle is a really cool place to explore. Among other things, there is a Trader Joe's just minutes away. Aside from that, though, there are lots of interesting spots that get little tourist traffic compared to other places in the city. It felt like the ideal urban neighborhood experience.

I only have positive things to say about our experience at this wonderful home. I think it's ideal for anyone with a family. I highly recommend it for your next trip to Seattle."
3403858,16671523,2014-07-31,16287121,Amy,"We had a fabulous time at this cozy West Seattle home!!  Lauren did an amazing job of communicating with us and making us feel at home during our first Airbnb experience.  We loved hanging on the wooden deck that stretches along the house.  In addition to the home being beautiful, spacious, and cozy, it's in a great part of West Seattle.  We hiked from the house through the woods of Schmitz park on to Alki Beach within about 20-30 minutes.  It was a perfect fit for our family of four with two small children!!"
3403858,17105657,2014-08-07,7459939,Katherine,"Our stay in Seattle was wonderful. Coming back each evening to the Curtis's home was so relaxing. We felt welcomed by the homey feel of their adorable bungalow. Sitting on the patio sipping coffee and tea at the end of an exhausting day or before a new day's set of adventures was such a pleasure! If we ever return to Seattle, we will definitely look for this home away from home again! "
3403858,18724346,2014-08-31,17848079,James,"Lauren did a great job communicating about her home and we felt welcome when we arrived .  She had plenty of nice touches for travelers, including maps and a coupon for local ice cream   Her home was exactly as listed and pictured, prepared well and very clean.  The West Seattle neighborhood is quiet and was nice for our small family.       "
3403858,38304205,2015-07-14,754679,Maurucio,"We had an amazing time!  The house is lovely. We especially enjoyed the deck patio.  All was spotless clean, quiet at night, beautiful walk to the back via an old-growth patch of original forest.  We highly recommend this place for visiting Seattle!"
6678058,37531189,2015-07-07,37089153,Christine,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying here for a few days, and were thrilled with every part of our visit.  The house is charming, set in a beautiful, peaceful neighborhood.  The apartment upstairs was incredibly clean and comfortable, with lovely views, a lot of natural light, a very cozy bedroom, and a thoughtfully-stocked kitchen.  Jeffrey and his wife were very warm and welcoming, and made us feel instantly at home. 

We were honored to be the first Airbnb guests at Petits Chênes Anglais, and cannot recommend it highly enough!
"
6678058,38218233,2015-07-13,27077800,Andrea,Lovely private studio in welcoming cape code home.  The bed is incredibly comfortable and the host has taken the time and care to think of every little detail to make you feel right at home!  There is a separate entrance and the space is exactly as shown in the photos.  The neighborhood is quiet and an excellent location to enjoy the surrounding neighborhoods and downtown Seattle. The host was friendly and even offered us a cup of tea!  I would highly recommend this place to family and friends.
6678058,38753253,2015-07-18,30757271,Mick,"Staying with Jeffrey and Deepa was more like catching up with old friends rather than staying in an airbnb apartment. Their warmth and generosity were evident from the very first meeting. Their local knowledge of places to eat and visit was also invaluable.
The apartment itself was beautifully presented, clean, private and well equipped for our five night stay. The bath robes were an added luxury. 
We were close to public transport via the 24 bus and more bus lines just down the street.
We loved staying here and hope to come back one day. We thoroughly recommend this airbnb apartment.
 "
6678058,40241926,2015-07-29,37156164,Kathy,"What an amazing experience from the second we drove up to the home. We were greeted by our host Jeffery Smith to a lovely room, with fresh flower, coffee and treats. Location is perfect just minutes away from Pike's Market, Space Needle and other attractions. My daughter Sarah and I had a memorable time. Thank you Jeffrey for being such a gracious host we will be back. My Best Kathy "
6678058,41101765,2015-08-04,36749844,Arthur,"This was a most pleasant experience. Our host Jeffrey was very helpful, and accommodating. The apartment is charming, comfortable, and very clean, located in a lovely upscale area.
Overall it was a wonderful four days."
6678058,42153751,2015-08-11,37231980,Tom,The apartment is awesome.  The location was absolutely beautiful.  It was definitely a solid launching ground for romping around Seattle.  Jeffrey was very welcoming and wonderfully flexible with my terrible communication.
6678058,42746283,2015-08-15,14754644,Teresa,"Jeffrey welcomed us and showed us the apartment.  He had great recommendations for restaurants.  The apartments was exactly as described.  Even though it was warm outside, in the upper 70's the apartment fans helped keep it cool.  When it is in the 80's the apartment was a bit warm.  The bed is a full size and so was a bit small for my husband and I."
6678058,42941001,2015-08-16,17225259,Jonathan,"Jeffrey was very helpful, kind, and responsive. His place is stylishly decorated and has all the amenities one could want. It has the feel of a luxury hotel rather than a mother-in-law studio. Not far from some great Seattle neighborhoods. We enjoyed our stay very much. "
6678058,43979439,2015-08-23,38169491,Elaine,"Jeffrey's studio was perfect for my husband and myself. A quaint and welcome alternative to staying in a hotel, and also less expensive for a week-long August visit.  The apartment itself is tastefully decorated, and comfortable.   Although the bed is smaller than what we are used to, we slept comfortably, especially after Jeffrey provided us with a 2nd comforter so we didn't keep pulling the original one off each other at night. Overall, we did feel like we were staying in a vacation cottage in a more remote location than just minutes from downtown Seattle. 

The location was perfect for our needs, although driving up/down the W Dravus hill can be quite intimidating the first few times.  But as we discovered during our week in Seattle, this is true for most of the Seattle neighborhoods. The neighborhood is beautiful.  Our son's apartment was about a 1/2 mile from Jeffrey's apartment, so our other 2 kids stayed with him, and we were able to easily meet up with them for our daily excursions.  From here we were able to easily get to all of our destinations in and around Seattle.

Jeffrey is a friendly and gracious host.  He helped us get our luggage up to the apartment on arrival, and down to our car on departure.  You do have to negotiate steps outside, and a flight of stairs inside to get in/out of the apartment.

The french pastries Jeffrey delivered to us on our first morning were a delicious start to our Seattle vacation.  And his restaurant recommendations were right on...'Un Bien' is the best sandwich place around.

We thoroughly enjoyed our conversations with Jeffrey.  We have some overlap in our careers, so hearing about his career and life experiences was interesting. 

We will definitely check Jeffrey's apartment for availability the next time we visit Seattle, and recommend it to any of our relatives and friends that may visit in the future. 

This was our first Airbnb experience, and our first visit to Seattle.  Thank you, Jeffrey, for making it an enjoyable one."

6678058,45998076,2015-09-07,6989949,Janet,"Tha accommodations were lovely! Spacious bedroom and bath, small but adequate kitchen and breakfast nook. Everything was very clean (and I'm very picky about that). Beautiful and super-convenient neighborhood. Jeffrey was  Ina business trip, but Dipa was a helpful host. Our experience was terrific!"
6678058,51322845,2015-10-19,5576156,Buffy,What a lovely apartment!  We came specifically to this neighborhood to be close to a friend who lived nearby.  Jeffrey even brought up freshly baked croissants on Saturday morning.  We were not there much since our friends were nearby.  Lovey.
4223597,22038051,2014-10-28,21789311,Gareth,"This was our first AirBNB experience and it was great!  The house was really nice, clean and welcoming.  We were able to walk everywhere we needed to go, easily making it to restaurants and touristy places.  We ran into one minor issue when we first arrived, we were uncertain which unit we had booked, but Scott was quick and responsive.  Coming from Southern California where rain is a novelty, we were excited to see a few rain storms while were there.  The big floor to ceiling windows were a big plus for storm watching and we appreciated the umbrellas that were left for when we ventured out.  Would definitely rent from Scott again."
4223597,24136493,2014-12-21,2789544,Susanne,"If you are looking for central but quiet retreat in Capitol Hill or Seattle this is it. Scott's place has the perfect location. We enjoyed very much staying here with our little girl - yes it is a kid friendly place - and made it home for 1,5 months. Scott equipped the home with everything needed and more, we could even do some serious cooking. He himself and Ryan have been wonderful hosts to us, being incredible responsive and helpful, while giving us the room we needed. I can recommend staying in Unit C, we enjoyed our stay very much!"
4223597,24409952,2014-12-28,22566524,Sam,"Great hosts and a wonderful setting. We loved the location. The apartment was clean, neat & well furnished. We couldn't rate it any higher. Would love to stay there again on our next visit to Seattle. "
4223597,31389609,2015-05-04,1602803,Juri,"Lovely place! Scott's apartment is in a wonderfully quiet yet central location (to Capitol Hill, which is what matters). Especially the living/kitchen area have a fantastic feel to them, being both sun-drenched and sheltered by the greenery outside. Definitely a recommended place to stay!"
4223597,32518924,2015-05-19,1592607,Zoe,"We had a wonderful stay for a long weekend at Scott's lovely place. The location is super convenient, lots of cool bars and restaurant in walking distance. Scott is also very accommodating and responsive to all our questions. Would definitely stay here again when we visit Seattle next time."
4223597,33642159,2015-05-31,14302534,Glenda,Scott made us feel very welcome. He was in touch throughout our stay. The apartment was very comfortable. We had a hot spell while in Seattle and the beautiful bedding was far too hot for us. A cotton blanket may be better for the warmer weather. The position of the unit was within walking distance to supermarkets and restaurants. A short bus into downtown was easy as well.
4223597,34187402,2015-06-06,11175142,Bruce,"Scott's Seattle ""Urban Oasis"" was all of that for our group of 4 active seniors, providing a comfortable base for exploring downtown Seattle.  We found it easy to walk downtown, enjoying Pike Place Market and the attractions at the Seattle Center (especially Chihuly Garden and Glass).  We also liked having a variety of  restaurants, markets and shops just blocks away.  "
4223597,36093008,2015-06-25,31346662,Marcia,"Scott had everything all ready for us.  Everything was so well explained and outlined for us.  It was great.  Loved the layout!  Was just perfect for me and my daughter.  The beds were soooo comfortable.  The kitchen/living room area was beautiful.  


"
4223597,37458595,2015-07-07,6352505,Darrin,"Fantastic location in the middle of everything, and great hosts. Couple of small downsides are 1) no bathroom counter space and 2) one of the bedroom windows opens up right into the gravel parking lot behind the unit. I do want to add that the upside down floor plan (bedrooms on ground floor) is great in the summer because the bedrooms stay much cooler."
4223597,41055113,2015-08-04,1604852,Lauren & Michael,Scott has a fantastic house. Our unit was very private in the very busy and eclectic neighborhood of Capital Hill. So close to some great restaurants. Worked at the Paramount Theatre and it was easy to walk to work every day.  Communication was easy with Scott. He even installed black out curtains to make my stay better. The windows are perfect opening from the top or side with screens so it was nice and breezy in the summer. The unit is very well thought out with laundry right outside the bedrooms and it is wonderful having a private bath attached to each bedroom. This unit comes highly recommended and worth the price.
4223597,42258560,2015-08-12,364178,Scott,"Scott's place was a perfect fit for our Seattle trip. The apt has newly renovated bedrooms and bathrooms along with a great shower. Also, the location is on point being in the cool capital hill area - super close walk to trader joes and amazing bars and restaurants. Scott was also felt very accessible even though we didn't need any assistance during or stay. Thanks for a great trip!"
4223597,44318381,2015-08-25,38552178,Andrea,"The location was great! We put money on an ORCA card to take the bus to the convention center, but found it was an easy walk and felt safe in the neighborhood, even at night. Capitol Hill is a very popular place to go for restaurants and fun venues. We were glad to have our bedrooms on the lower level, as the temps were very warm, so they stayed cool. We also appreciated having very separate bedrooms each with their own baths. This worked out great.
 I was a little thrown off on where the place was, as the front looks nothing like the back of the place.  Being new to the area, I would've liked a map with the grocery stores and a few restaurants marked on it. I did appreciate the addresses of places to go, and we were able to locate the coop.
I would definitely stay here again. "
4223597,46281191,2015-09-09,6807533,Michael,"We had a great visit. Unit C was exactly as described, with a nice kitchen / living area upstairs and the private bedrooms downstairs, which made it easy for us to socialize when we wanted. All the windows made for comfortable cross breeze on a warmer day.  And it was great to have a washer dryer in the unit. 
We were 1/2 block from the bus line downtown and walkable to many restaurants and bars. 
Scott's communication was excellent.  The self-checking was very smooth.  Definitely recommend. "
4223597,47063707,2015-09-15,10079203,Kim,"Scott made us feel quite welcome. He gave us all the information we needed for our arrival. The space is lovely and would work well for 2 friends (or 2 couples) since the bedrooms are separate and each has their own bath. Our only annoyance was that the bedroom with the queen bed had someone else's unit above. We could hear noises from their movements and talking. The neighborhood is delightful and and easy walk to shops, restaurants, and the downtown area. "
4223597,47535612,2015-09-20,3731437,Mike,"the place looked just like promised.. it was clean and just functional, but with NO extras whatsoever! besides the bed, the night tables and the dresser, we could have used a chair in the bedroom... a couple of extra blankets in the living room would have been useful... finally, we could have used a bit of kindness and some slack when my friend got very sick and we needed to stay an extra hour after checkout for the ambulance to transport her to the airport.. as a result, we had to rent other accommodations and stay in seattle an extra day"
4223597,48421396,2015-09-26,1466079,Maximilian,Great place with lots of space. If you need to go to SLU it's a bit of a hike but well worth it.
4223597,48887258,2015-09-29,3468536,Anna Hoai Thuong,"Charming modern home, with all the amenities we needed (and then some!), with very gracious and amenable hosts. The location is awesome, walkable to Pike, a plethora of nearby restaurants and night life. Street parking permit was provided, though it was a bit challenging at time to find a space. If you are planning to stick within the downtown area, I would suggest to skip the car. Thanks for everything!"
4223597,49882936,2015-10-07,38672635,Melissa,"We really enjoyed our stay at this home. The beds were very comfortable and the place was clean. It was a good location for us with great food options in walking distance. Parking on the street was a bit of a problem especially nights/weekends. I would suggest going for the parking pass if you want a guaranteed close spot during your stay. 

No issues! We would definitely stay again!"
4223597,50550750,2015-10-12,45460202,Laura,The home was exactly as described.  The place was very clean and the location was great – walkable to downtown and great food options in walking distance.  The communication with Scott was easy and he provided all the information we needed. 
4223597,53108249,2015-11-05,9554997,Travis,"My parents are the ones who actually stayed at this place so I asked them to write the review:

My wife and I just stayed at apt C in Seattle while on a 5 day trip to visit our son and his fiancee. When we arrived we were happy to find a very nice, clean and spacious, well appointed 2 bedroom apartment. It was in a convenient location close to plenty of restaurants and shops. The owner seemed to have anticipated  all of our needs, including fresh coffee beans complete with grinder! Everything we needed  was there. It was our first stay at an AirB&B. It was a thousand percent better than an expensive hotel room. We highly recommend it! Thank you!"
4223597,53607045,2015-11-10,44955696,Anthony,"Spent a few days in Seattle as a stop over to visit friends and family. Having spent a lot of time in Seattle in the past I wanted to be in Capitol Hill. Scotts apartment is the perfect base for exploring all of the amazing restaurants and bars close by and all within an easy walk. Downtown is a short walk away also. The apartment is perfect with two large bedrooms, two bathrooms downstairs and a large living/dining and kitchen upstairs. The apartment is near new and very clean and tidy. The beds are amazing I felt like I was sleeping on a cloud. Scott was so attentive and always responded to all requests very promptly and also just checked in to ensure we were enjoying our stay. I would definitely recommend and will stay on my next visit to Seattle. "
4223597,54145150,2015-11-16,1028355,Marsha,"I had a lovely stay in Scott and Ryan's unit in Seattle. It was such a great layout - both bedrooms downstairs and living room/kitchen upstairs. I really liked that it was very practical and charming with modern touches all around. The most important aspect was that it was SO CLEAN. The location could not have been any better, literally a couple of minutes to all of the awesome places in Capital Hill and less than a 10 minute drive to any area in downtown Seattle. Scott and Ryan were readily available to answer any questions and replied within minutes. I really did not want to leave and will be planning a future trip back very soon!"
4223597,55341275,2015-12-01,33371072,Margaret,"We loved this home. It couldn't have been more perfect for us. 

- It's removed from the street, so it's very quiet.
- Capitol Hill is a great neighborhood. Wonderful restaurants (the Coastal Kitchen has the best breakfast).
- The grocery store is a few blocks away in case you need anything.
- We loved all the small touches in the house. Scott provided hangers in the closets. Real wooden hangers, not plastic or wire ones.
- Each bedroom can control its own heat, which was lovely.
- The living room has several windows. The natural light is so pretty.
- The home is surrounded by greenery, which is so calming.

We loved, loved, loved it. "
4223597,56610295,2015-12-15,48877178,Diane,"When I walked into the kitchen and saw the coffee pot, a can of coffee beans and a grinder I knew I was in the right place. 
Everything was fine - easy to adjust the temperature in the bedrooms, well equipped kitchen, nice shower. "
4223597,58213152,2016-01-01,23216972,Ken,"We had a great stay. The house was in a great location and we ended up walking to some great restaurants. I recommend getting the optional parking, because parking can be a nightmare in that neighborhood because it is so close in. "
670056,2469960,2012-10-01,3067016,Fazlin,"me and my friends really enjoyed our stay at your house. the house was clean and felt very homely. the room was nice and the bed was very comfortable. the huge air mattress was also comfortable to sleep on. darlene was a nice host and she did her best to help us out and attend to our queries. we just wished that the location was closer to downtown, but other than that, we really enjoyed our stay. thank you darlene!"
670056,2649982,2012-10-18,1585315,Carolyn,"Great place, very comfortable, the neighborhood is quiet and very nice.  The TV is awesome and there is wi-fi. Tiki is a very nice hostess. Only complaints: the beds are very soft, the dining table is really a small bistro table with high stools--not useable for us old folks, there is no coffee maker and no microwave. Other than that, highly recommended! "
670056,3409326,2013-01-24,4680383,Gabe,"Darlene was a great Hostess!

Our plans to stay in Seattle fell thru and we were madly contacting people on AirBNB the night of trying to locate a place to stay. Darlene was super helpful, easy to communicate with, prompt and very thoughtful and caring. My wife and I have service dogs and she even put out blankets for our dogs to curl up on. Can't tell you how much that means to you when you've got a medical condition and people really get how important your dogs are to you.

Pros
Dog Friendly
Cute little house, smaller but plenty of space and well used and laid out
Great Amenities, well organized kitchen, laundry
Ok WiFi, not the fastest but totally workable
Quiet Neighborhood and nice, close to groceries and easy to get to and around.
Little snacks were left out for guests,
Cable and comfy living room for relaxing
Cozy bathroom. good hot water and plenty of it!

Cons:
None!
"
670056,3418678,2013-01-26,4680383,Gabe,"Darlene is a wonderful hostess. My wife and I felt very welcome and there were a lot of nice homey touches that were very appreciated such as coffee, little snacks etc.

Great little kitchen and laundry available.

Super dog friendly, Darlene even set up a dog bed for my wife's and my service dogs. Felt so welcomed! Would definitely visit again."
670056,4236432,2013-04-21,1904691,Marla,"I enjoyed my stay very much. The house was spotless, quiet and private. I felt comfortable in the entire house. Thank you.
 "
670056,5795625,2013-07-16,7229520,Dannielle,"I spent six days with Darlene and her daughter, TrishAnn.  I shared the main house with TrishAnn, meaning we shared the main spaces and bathroom.  It was great!  Such a wonderful alternative to a cold, sterile hotel room. The house is cute, the room well appointed.  There was absolutely no problem sharing the bath and kitchen (the water pressure was great!).  NIce little front porch area for relaxing and reading, great back deck space as well. This was so easy and comfortable I will definitely be staying here again."
670056,16639950,2014-07-30,18660978,Hermon,"Darlene was a very cordial host. We arrived late afternoon and we were promptly met by Darlene. The place was clean and inviting. Parking was plentiful on the street. The area was also quiet, safe and hospitable. When using only one of the rooms Darlene was kind enough to mention that we essentially had the home to rent while she stayed alongside the place in her own attached living space. The kitchen is nicely upgraded with a washer and dryer to use. It is colorful and clean. Wifi is provided but the signal is strongest in the living room. From the farthest room the signal is lost. The home is close to the main highway that easily takes you to downtown Seattle. It is also close to a collection of well known shops and nice places to eat. It's just far enough to be away from the hustle of downtown but close enough to get there and enjoy the flair of the city. "
670056,17249193,2014-08-09,4937053,Eva,"The house is very nice and clean. We shared the common space with one other person which was totally ok. The room was large and the kitchen very well equipped. For a longer stay I might rather consider an external cleaner than using the washing machine, but that was not an issue for us. Tiki leaves you pretty much to your own but is very available if you need anything. She was very nice. Distance to Seattle downtown is about 20 min by car without traffic and totally managable. Would stay here again."
670056,17989528,2014-08-19,20090997,Sandeep,"Great place. Everything was really neat, tidy and in good shape. Bathroom, kitchen and bedroom were all great. Overall quite happy."
670056,18215719,2014-08-23,13699129,Reinhold,"Darlene was very responsive and helpful during the booking, and friendly during our stay. The house is a 8-10 minute walk from the bus stop away (512 goes directly downtown, about 20 minutes). Its a quiet neighborhood, lots of trees and green. Her house has its own flair :) We didn't use the kitchen, but it seemed to have pretty much one could need there and it looked quite clean and in order. the room was not that clean, there was quite a bit of dust/webs at the not-so obvious places, behind the bed, on the inside of the roomdoor (!). The bathroom is a bit odd: it's divided in two parts, one with a basin etc., the other one with the toilet and bathtub/shower, and the connection is half-open. There's only a light lamp in the first part with the basin, which means that when showering/using the toilet at night, you have only a very dim light from what reaches the second part from the first one, which was a bit strange. As other's already mentioned, there is WiFi, but the signal is weak in the room. Overall, our stay was okay, but not mind-blowing."
670056,19315133,2014-09-10,16821924,Ruth,"We really enjoyed our stay here!  The house was clean and had a great TV and modern appliances. We only had a 15 minute walk to my daughter's place and seeing our 3 week old grandson!  We did have different opinions on the bed, my husband liked a soft bed.  We got along well with the woman in the other bedroom, she was considerate with the TV use, and quiet.  We appreciated  being given some breakfast food, Would stay here again!  Glenn and Ruth Euler"
670056,40783022,2015-08-02,37271483,Laura,"Had a very nice two week stay at Tiki's house while in Seattle. Quiet neighbourhood with good proximity to many shops, restaurants, bus routes and the highway. Also has a good space in the front yard to sit. Enjoyed lovely conversation with Tiki when our paths crossed, we would definitely stay here again!"
670056,44918985,2015-08-30,5790273,Aditya,"The listing description was very accurate, the room was great, and the host was very helpful! Host was very accommodating and kept the living space very clean. No complaints!"
670056,47152363,2015-09-16,16821924,Ruth,Darlene Tiki was there to welcome us and help with our luggage into the house. She had breakfast food available as we asked. The house is always neat and clean. We stayed here last September so knew what to expect. Really enjoyed the wifi since I recently purchased a tablet. The tv is excellent too.  Her place has everything we need  and is very reasonably priced!
670056,47585232,2015-09-20,44269966,Rachel,We had the house to ourselves because the 2nd room was rented out. I suggest getting the whole house to yourself or else you'll have to share a bathroom with them. The house was really nice and clean and we enjoyed the short time we were there. It wasn't that far from DT either so it made it easy travelling back and forth. 
7400955,41135148,2015-08-04,38859511,Devon,"Awesome house! Lots of room, and it's in a great location. The view of downtown from the balcony is amazing especially during the sunset. Lake Washington is only about a ten minute walk, Capitol Hill is only about ten minutes by cab at the most, and only about 15 to Pike Place and downtown. Check out the BBQ Pit on Cherry and Cafe Soleil if you're interested in some great Ethiopian food. Both within walking distance."
7400955,42010008,2015-08-10,38683734,Judith,"The house is very nicely located in a quiet and green neighborhood. A little supermarket and restaurants were in 10 minutes walking distance (as well as a Molly Moons ice cream place). 

The description of the house was accurate. We found everything we needed and felt very welcome with the family atmosphere this house has. Especially we enjoyed the great view on the Seattle Skyline from the balcony. Rooms had the perfect size, living room and kitchen were spacious and perfect to hang out. 

It took us about 10 minutes by car to be in the city center; bus stations are also close by and offer a great, reliable and cheap way to go to the city center, too. Buses left frequently."
7400955,55360872,2015-12-01,43503062,Elizabeth,"We felt very welcome into Ann's home. She left a bottle of wine and chocolates for us which was very thoughtful. The entry to the house was seemless, parking was never an issue on the street. The house was warm, although would be chillier towards the back of the house, it's older but cozy and well taken care of. We couldn't figure out how to turn on the light in the kitchen and Ann helped us right away. Washing clothes, dishes, using the TV, all no problem. We were traveling with a 7 month old and a 21 month old and the house worked very well for us. Two minor issues- there wasn't a flat sheet on our bed and the pans in the kitchen were all Teflon and older, no alternatives so we didn't cook much. 
Location: we loved the location in Madrona, great neighborhood, nice park down the street and great restaurants and coffee shops a couple blocks away. Also an amazing view of Seattle!! I loved sitting on the couch, reading and looking out the big picture windows at downtown Seattle while my kiddos were napping. Nice, quiet neighborhood. 
I would definitely recommend this house for a family. Ann was wonderful to work with. My brother-in-law, who lives in Seattle, even walked into the house and said, ""I would buy this house!"""
8555304,54060094,2015-11-15,48537368,Kim,I did feel welcome.  It was great to stay in her home.  They have a lovely and friendly dog was present and no concern at all.   The master was great with the bathroom in it.  They put out towels and toiletries.  There were a couple others staying there but we were all quiet and I never saw them.  Very peaceful.  Sadly I did get a parking ticket one night so be careful not to be too close to that fire hydrant in front.
9262389,54187035,2015-11-16,8849518,Ben,"We had a great stay at Kristin's place.  The decor is fun, the bed was comfortable, and everything was clean.  It was everything we needed for the night."
9262389,54406115,2015-11-19,42505466,Ray,"Loved this place, the large shower and comfortable beds made us feel right at home. Easy access to our room and was placed perfectly to enjoy the town! "
9262389,54910053,2015-11-25,12935750,Deirdre,My parents loved it! Such a cosy space and Kristin makes getting into the house super easy with the lock box on the door. It was a great place to stay and awesome alternative to downtown Airbnbs.
9262389,55753439,2015-12-05,2014510,Ginny,"This spot was perfect for our needs, house was adorable and comfortable. Kristin even had some lovely coffee for us to enjoy. We were able to let ourselves in upon arrival (10pm) without bothering anyone. We had a great, short stay. Location was great, had a few spots close for us to eat a late meal. "
9262389,55942682,2015-12-07,7318639,Ida,Kristin was very helpful and attentive and the place was great.  My wife and I stayed here with our 3-month-old.  It was spacious enough that she could sleep in a separate area and was not bothered by us being awake.  The fireplace was lovely.
9262389,56612356,2015-12-15,11234256,Elizabeth,"The Henry Hideaway is a lovely, comfortable basement apartment in a good location.  There is a wood burning stove and the hosts have provided books and board games for when the weather isn't the best. And there's a piano!"
9262389,56749256,2015-12-17,28371668,Sheila,"The Henry Hideaway is perfect. The photos don't completely express the comforts and attractiveness of this north Seattle neighborhood hideout. Excellent coffee, lovely bathroom, extremely comfy bed (we only used one of the two in the unit).  The pot bellied stove works great. Kristin has good dry wood and a starter to get you going.  We used it in the morning.  Perfect accompaniment to coffee and the news.  Current magazines, a bowl of ""cuties"" and CNN. All good.  We certainly filled in our Seattle family about the closeness and comforts of Henry.  Plus the murals are super! Thanks, Kristin.
"
9262389,56962039,2015-12-20,15192150,Fatima,We felt very welcome. The accomodations  were as described and the pictures were very accurate. We had a wonderful stay. 
9531,857976,2012-01-12,207057,Wendy,"My husband, 2 year old daughter and I stayed at the Sweet Orange for several nights.  It is a darling house, with everything one could need or want for a pleasant stay.  The gas fireplace was very cozy, and the beds were so comfortable it was difficult to leave them. 

I would happily recommend this place for short or long term stays. "
9531,1503834,2012-06-18,2085069,Diane,"What an incredible experience we had at the Orange Craftsman! There wasn't a THING the owner hadn't thought of to accomodate us and make our stay the most special of our 6 day travel across Washington from Spokane to San Juan Island. My mother, sister, 18 yr old niece and I were ALL impressed and we were all so sad as we left. This lovely little place feels like you are home the minute you walk in. It was very quiet and felt like a world away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Seattle. We got to meet the host and just loved visiting with her and hearing the history of the home when we asked her to share it with us. I told her I would return with my husband in the fall so he can enjoy this lovely little jewel in West Seattle. I couldn't recommend a place any higher than Sweet Orange! "
9531,2486942,2012-10-02,3509427,Gina,"The orange craftsman is indeed very adorable!  Cassie had everything that one would need in there and the house couldn't have been more charming and clean.  She was a pleasure to rent from.  The beds were extremely comfortable.  There are views of the Olympic mountains and Puget Sound from the deck, and the neighborhood is perfect for walking to all the restaurants, bakery's and shops of West Seattle.  Next visit to Seattle, I will certainly want to stay there again.  It could not have been more perfect.  Thanks Cassie!"
9531,9899101,2014-01-18,579253,Leah,"Wonderful place, lovely neighborhood. 
Great attention to detail and outstanding communication from Cassie. 
Would stay there again on a heartbeat. "
9531,10309408,2014-02-12,6724622,Joel,"This home is perfect.  Extremely clean and well maintained.  Beautifully appointed with wonderful furniture, amazing beds, and fine linens.  The pictures on this site do not do the place justice.  Sometimes pictures look better than the real thing, but this is not the case with the Sweet Orange.  It is even better in person!  Cassie was a perfect host, checking in via text to make sure we had everything that we needed or if she could help us in any way.  We can not wait to go back!  My only regret was that it was snowing when we were there and didn't have the opportunity to utilize the lovely deck that has a view of the water.  Next time! 
Thanks Cassie!"
9531,13784923,2014-06-04,5326609,Ingrid,"I returned to the Sweet Orange again this year. The home is absolutely gorgeous (I spent the first 30 minutes simply in awe the house). The care with which the detail and amenity of each room was furnished and decorated is surprising, and brings out all of its old world charms. It is comfortable, very clean, and provides you with all the things you need to feel like you are living in a second home. The house sits just behind California Ave SW, only a short block from Husky deli, bakeries, cafes, restaurants, bars, shops, and of course, Easy Street Records in Alaska Junction. Yet you would never know how close to the vibrant junction this home is, when sitting in the quiet and lush backyard garden. The highlight, I would say, is the deck overlooking the sound and evening sunsets.  Cassie is a friendly, generous, and kind host. She makes every accommodation to ensure her guests' comfort and convenience. I would not stay anywhere else in Seattle, and recommend this place to anyone."
9531,18991193,2014-09-04,7852290,Tanya,"Wonderful experience! Cassie is an awesome host and very detailed oriented from the local guide complete she created with maps and  thoughtful touches such as fresh half and half in the fridge and organic fresh ground coffee. The beds and bedding were extremely comfy like you would find in a 5 star hotel. West Seattle is super fun and amazing dining options are within walking distance from the Sweet Orange. Cassie must be a designer or knows one because the house is beautifully furnished and the paint colors complement each other so well. There is also beautiful views of the water from the dining and kitchen area. 
It was so hard to leave! We would absolutely re-book again!"
9531,20133760,2014-09-24,12649612,Teresa,"The Adorable Sweet Orange Craftsman was all it we hoped for! In spite of my Mom being in a wheelchair, the two little steps up on the porch were no problem, and the place was SO comfy and welcoming!
We arrived from the east coast on a late flight, and were just exhausted when we arrived. Everything was ready for us, including lists of places that would deliver food. There were yoghurts and fresh fruit -- just what we needed before we collapsed into our (REALLY COMFORTABLE!) beds.
In the morning, we discovered half-n-half and COFFEE - so welcome!! There were also common spices and all the dishes and pans we needed to make a few breakfasts there at the house. Trader Joe's was just a couple blocks away, as is the Sunday Farmer's Market. To our delight, the place was only a few blocks from our daughter's apartment. It looked further on the map.
The Sweet Orange is so much more convenient and spacious than a couple of hotel rooms would have been for the same or greater cost. And my elderly Mom was able to nap and take care of herself much more easily and enjoyably. The decor is classy and clean and cheerful, and I was even able to do a couple loads of laundry. 
Cassie thought of everything, even orange umbrellas for the inevitable Seattle showers. She even had shampoos and other toiletries, and a blow-dryer, in the linen closet.
Just note, the place is not technically handicap accessible (the single bath includes a tub, not a step-in shower). The third sleeping area is a twin bed on a little porch off the Master bedroom, so your extra guest or child will have to traipse through the Master (our 22-yr-old son chose not to, but was comfortable on the couch). This was thoroughly detailed on the web description, so we were okay with it.
We love West Seattle, and since our daughter and her new husband will be there for a while, we look forward to staying at the Sweet Orange again!
Thank you, Cassie, for making our first AirBnB experience such a great one!"
9531,21543788,2014-10-19,21418378,Maenad,"What an amazing place.  Close to everything, yet on a quiet street.  It was great to be able to cook when we wanted to, yet be so close to the junction to grab a quick bite.  The house is beautiful, I wish I had your knack for decorating.  It was a great place to launch my runs from, and close enough to run Alki and Lincoln Park.  The space was perfect, everyone had room to spread out a little.  Much more enjoyable than a hotel.  It was fun discovering how West Seattle has changed since we moved.  Thank you for allowing us to stay.  "
9531,22678209,2014-11-11,22169890,Eric,"Awesome! Your home was warm and beautiful. We appreciated the fruit and chocolate so that we didn't need to Trader Joes right after arriving. The whole experience was really inviting and wonderful. We had never been to West Seattle before, so had no idea how close it is to downtown. This would be a great place to stay for a football, soccer, or baseball game. Now we know. We would stay again in a heartbeat. "
9531,23319795,2014-11-29,5490100,Toddy,This is the place to stay in West Seattle. Cassie has thought of everything to make staying here 5 stars. My parents stated for five days instead of staying with us (too crammed) and let's just say luring them away from this cozy warm well appointed and beautifully decorated home was a challenge. It was all around lovely. Cassie is the best airbnb host and we will use this home again as soon as we can! 
9531,29816001,2015-04-13,25896657,Lisa,"Cassie met us upon our arrival with the most adorable pooch in her arms.  The house was absolutely lovely: cozy, warm, oh-so comfortable and beautifully decorated and appointed.  She even left fresh half and half and butter in the fridge and had a lovely selection of local teas and coffee to consume.  The neighborhood was extremely convenient to the business section of West Seattle, although the street was residential and quiet day and night.  Very walkable area and extremely close to the wedding venue for which we were in town.  Also, the house was an easy drive into downtown Seattle.  I would recommend Cassie's cottage to anyone who wants a darling home away from home, and would go back in a heartbeat.  I have some physical impairments, so the bathroom was tight but it worked.  Lovely place and lovely hostess.  "
9531,30975588,2015-04-30,26665606,Lisa,"The house is every bit as gorgeous as its photos.  Delightful warm touches through out, we had high expectations and they were really exceeded.  Kitchen is on the smaller side but fantastically appointed with great views. Great neighborhood, quiet but close walk to shops, restaurants, and bus line to downtown.  Quick drive to Alki beach or Lincoln park which we and our dogs loved. Cassie (host) checked in on us enough to make sure our stay went smoothly  and was helpful and responsive with any requests.  Overall a real gem, we would enjoy any future visit to West Seattle at The Sweet Orange. "
9531,34630162,2015-06-10,24169399,Tea Rose,"We had a fantastic week long stay at this beautiful and ideal house. Beautiful views, great location for restaurants and shopping in West Seattle, and a comforting home. Cassie was also particularly attentive and helpful in all ways we needed."
9531,35447715,2015-06-19,26822390,Ryan,Cassie was always on the ball and very welcoming.  It was a good location and a nice layout.  Will hopefully be staying again soon.  
9531,36378720,2015-06-28,31019555,Eugene,"My son and I were visiting Seattle for 4 days to visit colleges and also see family in West Seattle.  Our stay at Cassie's place was so relaxing and comfortable that it was tough to leave and go back on our college tour.  The house was immaculate, cozy, stylish, well appointed and very peaceful.  Cassie was attentive and well organized and our check in and out was flawless.  She even arranged for us to work out at a fabulous gym nearby with a free 2 day pass, which is important as my son and I are fitness addicts.  The highlight of our stay was laying out on the porch and getting a suntan while looking over the bay after a long day of touring around the city.  We'll definitely stay again when we're back in Seattle."
9531,36815364,2015-07-01,33541715,Yue,"Cassie's sweet orange is too great! Beautiful, clean, comfortable, every detail are always in good taste, photos and display the same! Cassie is very enthusiastic, we introduced details of house use! I will recommend to friends of sweet oranges!"
9531,40420858,2015-07-31,8240057,Janet,"No wonder Cassie is a ""Super Host""! From the moment I arrived until my departure, I was treated like a welcome friend. The house is charming and full of personal touches. Furnishings are beautiful but comfortable so from the moment I arrived I felt at home. And because the pantry was loaded with things a guest immediately needs, there was no need to run out to the store before settling in. It is obvious Cassie loves her home as well as opening it up to guests. The location is perfect, in a quiet residential area but walking distance to shops and restaurants. I fell in love with West Seattle and look forward to returning year after year"
9531,46691120,2015-09-13,12583886,Dani,"By far my favorite neighborhood in West Seattle & the cutest house on the block. The house is so charming and comfortable. A couple blocks from the junction bus to take you to the city, five minute drive to Alki beach, and my favorite bakery, bakery nouveau is two blocks away. We will most definitely stay here again next time we visit Seattle. The space, Cassie & her manager Morgan made this AirB&B experience perfect. Would recommend this place to a party or 2, 4 or 5. "
9531,48198425,2015-09-24,19814415,Nan," Having stayed at more then a dozen homes that we procured through Airbnb my husband and I ranked the Sweet Orange Cottage as one of our favorite. The cottage was not only beautifully appointed, spotless and fully accommodating, but Cassie was attentive and a delight to work with.  In addition, we very much enjoyed the location...walking to the shops and restaurants at the Junction, renting bikes at Alki beach, and riding the ferry to Seattle which gave us many more great day-long adventures. 
If we make it back to Seattle, we would definitely stay there again!"
9531,48575318,2015-09-27,43227813,Becky,"Wonderful place! Great location. Enjoyed meeting Morgan, very helpful and fun. Cassie was very nice to work with, made renting an easy process which I am very grateful for as my time was limited. Everything was perfect. Except the fact that we couldn't stay longer! So much to do in the Seattle area!"
9531,49776557,2015-10-06,1604933,Nancy,"This is the perfect vacation cottage!  Cassie was waiting to greet us and show us around her super cozy cottage.  Very welcoming.  This house is not only absolutely adorable (the decorating is amazing - color everywhere and so tastefully done) but thoughtfully equipped with everything we needed, and more.  And it is all nice stuff, not somebody's leftovers, as in some places we've rented.  We were able to enjoy the homey atmosphere (and the lovely yard) with our kids and grand-kids.  Oh, and the view!!!!  And, the neighborhood - so many shops, restaurants, bakeries and bars!  Just can't say enough!  Can't wait to go back."
9531,50102105,2015-10-09,8717743,Natalie,"This place is a gem! 
Cassie is a gem!
West Seattle is a gem! 
Already planning our next trip back!"

9531,52813180,2015-11-02,28371203,Alyssa,"The Sweet Orange was perfect! We are local west seattlites who wanted a beautiful place to stay for our wedding night, as well as a place for the girls to get ready. We were blown away with the how beautifully the house was restored and decorated. It suited our needs perfectly. Thank you so much to our host, it was wonderful :D"
9531,56955986,2015-12-20,21542474,Helen,"Where to even begin describing the AMAZING weekend we had at the Sweet Orange?? We live in Seattle and wanted to have a ""staycation"" in W.Seattle, as we rarely make it over to that neighborhood. The Sweet Orange was absolutely perfect in every way. It was BEAUTIFULLY restored/decorated (Cassie has an amazing eye for color and design!), absolutely spotless and extremely comfortable. The house has a lot of charm, a view of the water (we were pleasantly surprised to find out!) and is in a great location. We walked a couple blocks to The Junction and ate/drank/shopped our way through the fun selection of shops/restaurants located there. 

Cassie was an incredible host and fantastic communicator - someone needs to pin one of those ""super host"" medals on her! She responded to every question and request we had immediately (even while she was traveling to the East Coast on business), was super accommodating and provided us with detailed information that was much appreciated, as we were planning our weekend.

I can't recommend this house highly enough - we had so much fun staying in it, and Cassie provided us with a wonderful experience!! There is so much to do in W.Seattle - no matter the season. Huge parks, great restaurants, Alki Beach - a weekend was not enough time to even scratch the surface, and we have promised ourselves we need to make an effort to visit more often!

Thank you, again, Cassie - for playing a part in such a fun weekend!"

Whole for us ;) It's little bit far from downtown and public transport to there is every 30 min but neighbourhood is very nice and quit All stuff were working, bed was comfortable even the towels were prepared for us..     9/10"
8255196,48835343,2015-09-28,44852043,Vernon,Simo was always very quick to respond by texting.  The facility was fine.  bnB  ?breakfast?  Did have a dish of dry cereal but apparently the cereal and milk belonged to another person who was staying there so that needs to be clarified.
8255196,49400267,2015-10-03,6437803,Stacey,"Good, friendly check-in. Very nice people and easy to find unit. This is a basic room in a basic apartment."

The room was just what I needed for my trip: basic, clean, quiet, and in a safe neighborhood. "
1758935,8076063,2013-10-14,4407907,Jonah,"Beth was a great host!  Super nice & welcoming.  House was great, exactly as described, in a nice area near fun stuff to do, close to Lake Washington, good food & interesting neighborhood stuff.  Thanks Beth!!"
1758935,8231899,2013-10-21,9142772,Lara,"Beth was a wonderful host and we couldn't ask for a better first experience through AirBnB. We were traveling for a convention and although we had to change the check-in time and number of guests numerous times, Beth was extremely accommodating and flexible about any changes. She gave off a friendly, kind, and warm vibe that made the three of us feel right at home. The bed was extremely comfortable (it's described as ""firm"" in the description but it was fairly plush and SO COMFORTABLE) and the bathroom had one of those falling rain shower heads, which was AMAZING after a long day selling at the convention. The guest rooms are sequestered off in one end of the house next to the kitchen, and felt very private and nice as a result. It's a shame we didn't get more time to chat since we were exhausted from the convention (our day began at 3am and we checked in around 8pm at Beth's) but Beth was super understanding and respectful and gave us plenty of space to rest and relax. Beth's place is also conveniently located on a quiet street, about a 15 minute drive to downtown Seattle. I highly recommend Beth's place to anyone and will definitely be looking out for her the next time I'm staying in Seattle. A++"
1758935,8390355,2013-10-28,6134453,Tony,Beth was a great host!  Warm house in a great location. Very happy with our stay and would stay again!
1758935,8988772,2013-11-30,292519,Eric,"The bed is really comfortable, the wifi Internet access is fast, and the shower has a very good water flow...  Beth was warm, welcoming and kind to me. I wish I had more time to spend around the house, but I was working 10-12 hours a day during my week in Seattle. The neighborhood is only two blocks away from a large grocery store and other shopping. You can drive to downtown Seattle in 10-15 minutes via Rainier Ave, which makes the location really convenient for business travel. I would highly recommend Beth's house to anyone!"
1758935,9083180,2013-12-05,9218845,Lynn,"Beth was really nice, and she even had a talk with us!!! Her place was clean and tidy, and purified bottle water was served!!!!! She even served us with Ethiopian food!"
1758935,9570168,2014-01-02,10733288,Shai,"Beth is such a delightful and thoughtful host! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at her lovely home and getting to know her! The room is very cosy, the bed is very comfortable, lots of closet space and there are fresh towels and bottled water. The location is also very convenient and there are many good eateries near her place along Rainer Avenue South. We hope to visit her again when we are in Seattle!"
1758935,9881034,2014-01-16,9324440,Luca,"Beth is very very friendly and the whole house is very comfortable and clean. There is enough room for two.
Everything was perfect!"

House is very convenient with public transport "

1758935,10237284,2014-02-08,1245925,Lindsay,"I love Beth! Her house is comfortable, close to public transportation and very close to a Safeway. She's also a great storyteller with plenty of travel experience under her belt. Highly recommended!"
1758935,10353495,2014-02-15,11825396,Trinidad,"Beth was really nice, and did everything she could to make me feel comfortable, it was practically like being in a relative's home. I also enjoyed talking with her.

The room has more than enough space and is very comfortable. The area is very quiet, you have a grocery store quite near, and also bus stops to get to downtown in a short time.

I would return again, no doubt."
1758935,10398676,2014-02-17,880966,Mariel,"I stayed for two nights at Bethy's, and had a lovely time at her place. The bed was very comfortable, and the amenities were sufficient. There were plenty of towels and other nice touches in the bedroom, like bottled water. Beth made me feel very welcome. Thanks Beth! "
1758935,10472704,2014-02-20,9432787,Samantha,Beth was a great host--I would stay with her anytime. 
1758935,10541438,2014-02-24,9454532,Katie,Bethy was fun to chat with and very hospitable. Enjoyed our stay very much!
1758935,10619609,2014-02-28,1658704,Paul,We had a very quick overnight in Seattle.  Beth was flexible with our stay.  It was so nice to come into her home and smell delicious food being cooked.  She was warm and welcoming.
1758935,10688670,2014-03-03,11631799,Jed,Beth is a lovely host. I hope to stay at her place again in the future.
1758935,10952433,2014-03-14,12708778,James,"This place has nice homey feel, and it is clean. I enjoyed the great conversation we shared with the host and her friends in the evening. "
1758935,11012686,2014-03-17,8480653,Kervin,"Overall, Beth keeps a very lovely home. We stayed in the private room
for 3 nights. Beth's home is cozy and comfortable. Her home is
close to a grocery store; therefore, if you enjoy preparing meals, it
is very convenient. Also, like in Seattle, there is a Starbucks near
her accommodation and the bus to Downtown takes about 20 minutes. 

My friend wanted to add that she's so kind, that she even treated us to breakfast, coffee, tea, and cheesecake! :)

We enjoyed our stay in Beth's home."
1758935,11244162,2014-03-26,12151714,Dan,"Beth and her family were lovely hosts in our stay in Seattle! Her home and the AirBnB room were very clean and organized, with fresh towels, clothes hangers, and water bottles. There was even candy in a bowl and a ton of city guides for tourists. Beth was also kind enough to provide coffee and light refreshments every morning. 

Her home is located in Seattle's Mt. Baker neighborhood. It is a short 5 minute walk to numerous restaurants, Safeway, and the 7-bus line which will take you to downtown Seattle. Additionally, the Mt. Baker light rail station is roughly just under a mile away and it is very easy to travel to and from SeaTac and the city by taking the light rail/line 7 bus combo. 

In sum, I was very pleased with my stay at Beth's home and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to stay in Seattle for a fair price and away from the hustle and bustle of the city center. "
1758935,11290295,2014-03-28,5659173,Kati,"Beth's home was warm cozy and inviting. My husband and I booked this place and it is the kind of place you want to stay at when you are visiting as a tourist (which we were). In the room Beth left plenty of travel maps, and tourist guides. She also provided us with soft towels. The bed was soft and the internet fast. The home is close to public transportation (a bus going to downtown) and the local metro stop is also close by (its a walk but a nice one). Located in a very safe and secure neighborhood we felt safe walking to the house at night from the metro. You have to share a bathroom, which was very clean; but we didn't meet any of the other house guests. I highly recommend Beth's home for anyone looking to spend money on the food and sights of Seattle. Beth is a wonderful host and you will have an amazing time.  "
1758935,11310483,2014-03-29,13262005,Richard,What a great stay! Beth was extremely helpful and welcoming. She was beyond flexible about checking in. The room is perfect for travelers looking for a comfy bed and safe place to reenergize. Beth also goes out of her way to make you feel at home. I would stay here again in a heart beat if I had the chance! 
1758935,11388951,2014-03-31,13546154,Lucas,"Beth is a lovely individual with a lovely home.  My wife and I felt very comfortable at her place and she gave us fruit and coffee in the mornings!  A very relaxing quiet cottage indeed, just a couple miles from downtown too!"
1758935,11727687,2014-04-13,13928234,Margaret,We stayed two nights with Beth and I would visit again and recommend to others. The house was clean and our bed comfortable. I broke my arm on the way to Seattle and because of that spent less time there than I would have liked. She was very understanding. There is parking space too. Important for Seattle. 
1758935,11817297,2014-04-15,9760944,Laura,"We enjoyed Beth's quiet haven very much.  It was an easy drive to the City Center, without having to get on any highways.  Very accessible, private, and pleasant.  Thank you, Beth!"
1758935,12062078,2014-04-22,12743191,Aaron,"We stayed at the Ethiopian Cottage while visiting my sister during the day, and Beth was very kind and accommodating of our somewhat irregular schedule.  Additionally, the room was quite spacious and comfortable and had plenty of room for our toddler to sleep in a pack'n'play too.  He also loved Beth's nice porch and view!  Definitely a great place to hang your hat while in Seattle."
1758935,12229381,2014-04-26,802107,Em,"I really enjoyed my stay. Beth was a gracious host and a pleasure to talk to. She kept in good communication, and was flexible with my schedule. The room was clean, bed comfortable. Private bath was nice. We felt very welcome and slept wonderfully. I accidentally left my cell charger there and Beth notified me when she discovered it.  "
1758935,12264655,2014-04-27,14655935,Joulien,Beth was awesome. The place is very clean. She is very welcoming. Highly recommended.

1758935,12388187,2014-04-30,9730009,Tatiana,"Beth is very friendly and accommodating, she worked easily with our schedule, and even though I forgot to click ""2 guests"" instead of one, there was no problem when I let her know as soon as I realized the mistake. It is an easy to find location, close to downtown, for a great price and I would definitely stay with Beth again!"
1758935,12461504,2014-05-03,12158924,Daniela,"Even though we never met in person, due to my bad jetlag, Beth answered all my questions over the phone! The house is in a nice residental area and my room was extremely tidy and quiet! I really enjoyed having my own bathroom on suite and the privacy! All in all, I would not hesitate staying with Beth if I am visiting Seatlle again!!"
1758935,12706342,2014-05-08,15064826,Joy,Staying with Beth was very pleasant! We stayed there with our little two month old she was perfectly fine with us having our little boy there with us :) We only got to stay with her for one night but would love to stay with her again if we are ever in Seattle :) 
1758935,12842041,2014-05-12,3241487,Paula,"I had a wonderful time at Beth's house, she made me feel right at home.  She is a gracious host and very helpful.  I would stay at her home again in a heart beat."

1758935,13099935,2014-05-19,1125159,Vinh,"Even though my visit to Seattle was quick and brief - I enjoyed my stay at Beth's home.  The room and bathroom was clean and comfortable, and neighborhood is quiet and easy to get to. I would definitely consider staying again the next time I visit Seattle."
1758935,13200013,2014-05-21,15537151,Donald,"As my first visit through Airbnb, I had no idea what to expect and, frankly, has heard of some sketchy situations.

But this place was quite nice in every way!  Clean, orderly, easy to use, well-equipped, and secure.  Best of all, Bethy and her awesome family make this a pleasant personal experience as well as a fair, high-value business transaction.

Not that I used it, but there is a spacious private deck for smokers.

I was usually out or tied up and could not socialize.  But the public areas are welcoming and friendly; everyone here thinks we're all friends and neighbors for as long as we're here.

Also, by car this location is quite close to the center city and very accessible to Mercer Island.  I imagine it would work well by bicycle too for people who are used to urban cycling.
"
1758935,13435369,2014-05-27,15058106,Polly,"I was veery sorry that this  didn't work out--
I kept calling the number of Beth's cell phone for directions and a key, but she was in Canada where the phone did't work.  She had arranged for her aunt to make the arrangements but  I didn'tl'  have that phone number.  She was calling and leaving messages on my Reno phone.  
Finally Sunday night, right after we had checked into a Motel 6 in Renton- the aunt  called my cell phone, and we were able to talk--it was a misunderstanding .  I didn't have a computer or smart phone with me but did finally get help  sending an e-mail from someone at the information desk at the Folk Life  Festival.   I would like to get my money back!!
 "
1758935,13475158,2014-05-28,13343261,Ian,"Beth was very kind and hospitable! I only stayed one night, so I didn't get to interact with her much, but the room and shower were very nice and even came complete with guides and a list of amenities. She also personally showed me around parts of Seattle that I had yet to see. I would happily stay at her residence again and recommend her to anyone."
1758935,13618356,2014-06-01,9650328,Chathura,"Amazing place! Amazing and kind host! We stayed two nights at Beth's. She.kindly offered tea, coffee and snacks every morn ing. Good.Wi-Fi. The room was very spacious for two people including a walk-in closet. I highly recommend staying with Bethy!!! :-)"
1758935,13930986,2014-06-08,16003996,Andrew,"Lovely place to stay. The room and bathroom were perfectly clean and comfortable for my wife and I. Beth was extremely kind and welcoming. We stayed there for three days and we were able to lock our door and keep all our stuff safe and secure. We had a car, so I'm not sure what the transportation to downtown is like. However, if you are driving to Beth's house, you're smartphone might lose coverage a few times and give you confusing directions (I'd recommend a solid GPS system instead)."
1758935,14102540,2014-06-11,15149881,Ashraf,"Beth was very friendly, understanding, and welcoming!  The bedroom was clean, extremely comfortable, and quiet.  The bathroom was also clean.  I would highly recommend her for your stay in Seattle."
1758935,14556306,2014-06-22,14343262,Tzu-Hua,"We got to spend most of our stay with DD. DD was extremely hospitable and warm. We enjoyed the stay so much and could not have hoped for a better experience. The room looks just as advertised. This is the place we'd go if some day we visit Seattle again. Thanks, Beth and DD!"
1758935,14783401,2014-06-26,14343262,Tzu-Hua,Coming back after staying in vancouver for a few days is like coming home. Big thanks to DD for offering to pick us up and taking us to the airport the next day. What a good Airbnb experience.
1758935,14845380,2014-06-27,16683837,Logan,Loved our stay in Seattle.    They were very welcoming and helpful.   
1758935,14978831,2014-06-30,15913428,Niki,"Staying here was wonderful! Everyone was friendly and I felt safe and happy the whole stay!
"
1758935,15089164,2014-07-02,9837900,Dharini,"Beth was constantly in touch with me since she wouldn't be present on the day of our visit. Instructions were very clear, the room was neat and spacious. We stayed only for a night but I would definitely recommend the place to anyone who would like to spend time in Seattle. Her aunt was such a friendly and gracious host. Cannot thank her enough. "
1758935,15148670,2014-07-03,596226,Wally,"Nice clean room. Beth wasn't there but her aunt Dede was very friendly, helpful, and accomodating. I stayed just the one night because I was leaving early the following morning. I picked the location because it was just a 10-15 minute drive to the airport."
1758935,15179506,2014-07-04,15588207,Rita,It's a very good place for visitor to live.  It's near bus stop and light rail that it's very convenient to airport.
1758935,15227595,2014-07-05,16541214,Vinnie,"This was our first airbnb experience and I have to say that Beth and Dede far exceeded our expectations.  We were a little worried because our flight came in late at night but Beth said ""no problem!"" and Dede was there awake waiting for us to arrive.  Dede was exceptionally friendly and made us feel right at home the minute we walked in.  The room was clean and the bed was so comfortable.  Coffee and tea were prepared and waiting for us in the morning, too, which was a wonderful suprise!  I'd highly recommend to anybody!"
1758935,15547525,2014-07-11,17115693,Maren,"A friend and I stayed at this place for two nights and we definetely recommend it! It is easy to find and you can take a bus to Downtown Seattle. A Safeway is almost in front of it. We didn't meet the host Beth, but we met her aunt and it was a pleasure to met her. She is a really nice person. Our room was clean and big enough and we had a lot of clean towels. We got water to drink. Everything was perfect. I can't say a bad thing. :)"
1758935,15609943,2014-07-12,13503389,Chris,Aunt Dede went out of her way to make us feel at home.  I would stay here again the next time I am in town.
1758935,16270187,2014-07-24,17873490,Shaila,"True to many of the other reviews, DeDe was the person at the residence handling the reception of guests. She is great! A very friendly, welcoming host. We sat together and watched the news and shared viewpoints on the topics of the day. I needed to catch the bus to get to a museum before my flight, and since it was raining she offered to drop me off. She also offered to drive me around when I checked in, but I was really there for convenience, not to be treated like queen. If I had more time I would have opted to sit around and chat with her to learn more about the world and Seattle, unfortunately I was on a tight schedule :("
1758935,16349789,2014-07-26,3649801,Rachelle,Beth was away but Dede was very welcoming.  Quiet room and enjoyed my one nite.  Was nice to have off street parking also.  Rachelle
1758935,16434117,2014-07-27,17877538,Daniel Juyung,It was a great stay. I wish I would have stayed more if I had time. I met Beth's aunt and she was great. Thanks for the warm welcoming. She made a breakfast for me and we had a great talk. Thanks a lot!
1758935,16473756,2014-07-28,16507972,Edgar,"Beth was a great host. My son & I really enjoy our stay on the Ethiopian cottage #1. Nice, clean room & bathroom, great location. I will definitely be back to Beth's location on my future trips to Seattle. "
1758935,16658447,2014-07-31,2630353,Eric,"Great value- Ethiopian hospitality, comfortable room!"
1758935,16724303,2014-08-01,7903201,Michelle,"Our host, Dede, was exceptional. She was warm, welcoming, and more than accommodating. Venturing out for food, we went with her recommendation for a nearby Ethiopian restaurant. It was wonderful! One of the sweetest people I have ever met. 

As far as the room, it was clean, quiet, and comfortable. There were plenty of brochures about Seattle, too. 

I would highly recommend staying here. Everything about my experience was positive. Cloves in her coffee!! Delightful. Thank you, Dede!!"
1758935,16929530,2014-08-04,3598570,Chris,Beth was very welcoming and hospitable. The cottage was great! Very clean and comfortable with awesome views of the hills nearby. 
1758935,17019530,2014-08-05,18948177,Rosalind,Beth was really nice and welcoming! The house was in a good location.  It was easy to take the bus downtown and the cab ride back wasn't that expensive.  The room was clean and fit all our needs.  Would definitely stay here again! 
1758935,17201998,2014-08-09,10955848,Jae-Eun,"Perfect host, nice room, quiet area, and quite comfortable to take the bus. And the host was really kind and considerate. I strongly recommend here. By the way, bcz my sister and I are just 19, 22 years old, it's a little bit scary to walk around near the house in late night. Except that, everything was perfect."
1758935,17343395,2014-08-11,12851920,Jasmin,"Wow! What a warm welcome and lovely atmosphere at the ethopian cottage. We enjoyed our stay at Beth's a lot and would come back anytime. Easy parking, excellent facilities, good bus connection to city, shops close by. We found everything we needed! Thank you so much :-)"
1758935,17582790,2014-08-14,18898430,Liz,"My friend and I arrived for our two night stay to be warmly greeted by 
Beth and aunt Didi. Our accommodations where clean and comfortable and good value for the money. The location was very handy to various activities; ie. the lake and walking trails, the bus to downtown, and to Columbia City with its restaurants and shops.
The warmth we felt  and conversations we enjoyed with Beth and Didi and other guests made this a very enjoyable get away. I'll definitely stay here again when visiting Seattle."
1758935,17635587,2014-08-15,18422056,Chris,"I definitely recommend staying at Beth's place. The room was very comfortable, spacious and well-supplied. Beth was an excellent host and my friend and I really appreciated her hospitality. The location is good, with a convenient bus to downtown and a supermarket very close by. Thanks Beth!"
1758935,17742660,2014-08-17,9562877,미경,"Betty, we were really comfortable in your house and had great time in Seattle. You were so kind and nice. Many thanks again. And hope to see you again. "

Allez-y, voir courrez-y les yeux fermés....

 "
1758935,18569007,2014-08-28,4274504,David,"Great spot, host was very nice. Easy access to the bus for downtown, grocery store for food right there. Was a very hot day, but this room cooled off nice as soon as the sunset hit. Would stay again!"
1758935,18631016,2014-08-29,19708916,Mihae,"Beth was so kind when I arrived the place. Even though it was quite late evening when I got there.. She was a great host!
No need to say, the room was perfect ever. Well-organized and clean.
"
1758935,18709631,2014-08-31,1003888,Carmen,"Bethy was a perfect host. She let us come inside to drop our luggage off before the check-in time and was really welcoming. Her house is beautiful and very close to the 7-line bus that get you to downtown Seattle. The bedroom was clean  and big enough, even with a walk-in closet really helpful to put our bags in. 
I really recommend her place to other travelers. "
1758935,18849035,2014-09-01,17908717,Young Sun,"My husband and I had a great time in Beth's house. The house is very comfortable and clean. It is located in convenient place. I could easily get to coffee shop, supermarket and  bus stop. I accommodated in hotel another day, but I think the house was much better!"
1758935,18981684,2014-09-04,15814735,Yvonne,"Dear Beth,
thank you so much for everything-we felt very comfortable.
Nice room, nice house, near to the busstop, tea and coffee - great :-)
"
1758935,19198325,2014-09-08,16367289,Hendra,"Beth was really nice and welcoming us to stay at her cottage.  The room was clean and very comfortable, the location is very handy near supermarket, restaurants, public transports close to downtown and quite neighborhood. Thank you very much for Beth & Dede for the hospitality and we recommend for Beth's Cottage is the place in Seattle."
1758935,19380973,2014-09-11,20484102,Kirie,A lovely time with a lovely host :)  Great coffee and conversation. 
1758935,19443925,2014-09-12,20930155,Dianne,"My husband and I had a marvelous stay at Beth's  Ethipoian cottage #1. Very comfortable bed, super clean place in a quiet neighborhood, delightful host. Highly recommend.  We would stay here again with no hesitation."
1758935,19472929,2014-09-13,19692720,Mary,We loved staying with Beth. The house was wonderful and what we expected. Beth was so sweet with our 6 month old. And the location of the house was great. Just a 15 minute walk from the light rail and 15-20 walk to a downtown area with shops and restaurants. It was a great first time airbnb experience for us!
1758935,19666251,2014-09-16,12698833,Mareike,"Beth and her family are gorgeous people and extremely helpful! The room is very clean and comfy. We had a great time in Seattle, especially because Beth and her aunt Didi made us feel at home all the time! Thank you very much for your kindness- it was really great to meet you! We wish you all the best and definitely recommend your place! "
1758935,19929290,2014-09-21,13944629,Stephanie,"Beth is really a lovely person and a great hostess. We felt immediately welcome and also her aunt Didi spread us a great farewell. We had a great time in Seattle and can only recommend Beth's house. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was clean and there was even water and fresh towels."
1758935,20047247,2014-09-22,2158793,Stefan,"Beth was really friendly and the place was okay. It came in really handy that there was a busstop right around the corner. Beth even dried my wet cloth, which was very nice of her."
1758935,20637783,2014-10-02,5856413,Scott,"Beth is a very gracious host! When I arrived, the first thing I asked for was recommendation for an Ethiopian restaurant and Beth had a great place at the ready.  The night that I stayed also happened to be her birthday night and I was invited to share drinks and food with her family and friends which was very pleasant.  The room was stocked with water and snacks and the bed was very comfortable.  The walk in closet is sizeable and the private bathroom has everything needed although the shower stall is quite small. The view from Beth's porch is also spectacular and verdant (it is Seattle after all).

The neighborhood is by far the most interesting place I've ever stayed in while visiting Seattle.  The cultural melting pot is alive and well here and you can find any cuisine your heart desires within walking distance.  I walked several blocks at night with a full belly and hardly a worry.  

I will definitely be checking back here for my next trip; business or pleasure.  If you appreciate Hospitality with care, visit here."
1758935,21052039,2014-10-10,2542010,Claudia,"Beth é a anfitriã perfeita. O quarto é muito bom e da para ir a downtown de ônibus, super fácil. Pergunte a Beth onde fica a vista para o lago, a vista de lá é de tirar o fôlego. "
1758935,21210062,2014-10-13,20620416,Mark,Beth was a fantastic host & the room was excellent. Breakfast was laid on each morning and someone was always around to chat to about the city and the best transport options. Had a great time & would recommend this option to anyone. My first Air BnB and was not disappointed! Also the Saveway next door is amazing!
1758935,21614824,2014-10-20,22018728,Charles,"Great place and Beth is a great host. Clean, convenient. The private bath room is nice. Easy access to LINK train and the bus. Next time I visit, I'll probably reserve again."
1758935,21665167,2014-10-21,19728815,Pascale,"Beth was a great host, even though the way description was very good, we got lost, so she offered to pick us up, very gentle of her. The room was super pretty an clean! Next time I will stay longer than just for one night and I will definitely go to her again :) "
1758935,21702833,2014-10-22,19698964,Cynthia,"We enjoyed a lot our staying in Beth's house, she was very kind and our room was spacious and very clean."
1758935,21847287,2014-10-25,22378952,Stephanie,Stayed with Beth for one night for a conference held at the convention center and she was fantastic! The room was very clean and looked just like the pictures. We had our own bathroom and a large walk in closet which was perfect. Beth was extremely nice and welcoming and had coffee started for us in the morning although we woke up early in the morning. Conveniently located near the bus stop and Safeway which made it easy to get cash out for the bus and only a short ride into downtown. Would love to stay with her again if we return to Seattle.
1758935,22065394,2014-10-29,10654541,Faith,"The room looks just like the picture. It was clean, quiet and comfortable.  Beth was very accommodating.  She coordinated with me ahead of time to make sure she was there when I arrived.  She made me feel welcomed and safe!

The house is close to a grocery store and the bus line #7.  There are lots of cute restaurants nearby.  The bus is sketchy at night after 9 pm and I would strongly advise taking an uber or cab back at night.  I'm pretty comfortable with public transportation and the bus was fine during the day, but I do not think it's safe for a girl to take a bus or walk around the neighborhood alone at night there.  Even so, I really enjoyed my stay there and it's a great deal with very easy access to downtown Seattle.  "
1758935,22251711,2014-11-02,9226492,Cheryl,"Extremely hospitable!
Beth is also a great host and cook and took time to make everyone feel welcome!!
"
1758935,22436948,2014-11-06,15213902,Elodie,"Beautiful house and beautiful bedroom. Beth is a nice host and very warm. Grocery and bus are next to the house. We have spent a good time in Seattle.
We recommend Beth!"
1758935,22526984,2014-11-09,15090452,Bernard,Beth made us feel most welcome. We rented a room for two nights. The house is in a very quiet and interesting neighbourhood.
1758935,22755544,2014-11-13,18347638,Lynn,"I was welcomed by Beth in person - even though my flight got in late and I arrived at 10pm! She was gracious and the room and bath looked just like the pictures. Clean, quiet. Beth and DiDi were friendly and compassionate. I definitely recommend this for others."
1758935,22862821,2014-11-16,4798632,Robin,"Beth was a great host and very helpful! The room was great, it even has a bathroom in the room, which I didn't notice in the listing, so that was a great surprise! We also found the bed very comfortable. Couldn't have asked for more. "
1758935,23222853,2014-11-25,23627218,Isabel,"Beth war eine großartige Gastgeberin und hat uns sehr herzlich empfangen.
Sie war stets hilfsbereit und gab uns sogar auf eine kleine Tour durch Seattle.
Das Zimmer ist liebevoll eingerichtet und hat unsere Erwartungen mehr als erfüllt.
Das Haus ist sehr gut gelegen, mit einem Supermarkt und einer Bushaltestelle in unmittelbarer Nähe.

Wir würden jederzeit wiederkommen!"
1758935,23263781,2014-11-27,11755863,Niklas,"Unser Aufenthalt bei Beth war wirklich toll. Das Zimmer und Bad sind sehr sauber und wie in der Beschreibung. Busanbindung in die Stadt ist gut, Supermarkt zwei Gehminuten entfernt. Und: Beth ist eine sehr offenherzige, interessierte, lustige und lebhafte Frau, mit der man viel und lange reden kann. Absolute Empfehlung!"
1758935,23333656,2014-11-29,20162465,Emily,"We had a wonderful and comfortable time at Beth's - our own room, huge closet, private bathroom, and extra towels and blankets. Beth was a fantastic host - we arrived on the night of Thanksgiving and she had a gathering but was conscious of our exhaustion (offering food and the noise level died down at around 11 pm which was the perfect time for us to go to sleep). We had access to the entire floor which included the kitchen. We would like to stay there again when we get back up to Seattle. Thanks Beth!"
1758935,23550882,2014-12-04,23412334,Sicheng,"It's really good trip for us, a nice warm clean room with indoor bathroom, we love it so much! Beth is pretty nice and her house has a good view to look around the Seattle! Thanks her so much!"
1758935,23730886,2014-12-08,19218821,Florian,"It was our first time using airbnb and it couldn't have been better! Thanks to Beth for everything. The room was perfect and exactly as Beth described it. The communication with her was also perfect and we had nothing to complain about. I chose the place because i read all the previous comments and reviews which helped me a lot for my first time booking on airbnb and it was the right choice - me and my girlfriend had a great time at Beth's place. The environment was exactly as described - Safeway, Bus and Skytrain - everything very close to her house. So If anyone needs a place in Seattle - choose Beth! That's what I would do any time again :) "
1758935,23948498,2014-12-15,23166569,Sebastian,Home was very nice just like the ad post said it was close to the bus stop and other great stuff really enjoyed my stay 
1758935,24036699,2014-12-17,23011369,Inga Marie,We had a great night at Beth's place. It was clean and comfortable and nice to have a bathroom attached to the room. 
1758935,24129273,2014-12-20,8594687,Sara,Bethy was lovely and I felt very welcome. Thank you for having me. Bed was comfy.
1758935,24466588,2014-12-29,15654060,Nam Duong,No complaints. Everything is so perfect! Absolutely love the stay!
1758935,24628795,2014-12-31,15404746,Sarah,"Ethiopian cottage #1 was great! The bedding was clean, and the bathroom was convenient. There was also plenty of closet space, which was nice. Beth was great to talk to, and had some really great restaurant suggestions. The area was conveniently located in terms of access to Downtown Seattle (around a 10 minute drive). I'd definitely recommend Beth's place!"
1758935,24658679,2015-01-01,3790189,Carolyn,"Beth and her Aunt Dee Dee were most welcoming.  We waited a bit for the bed to be made, but were quickly made comfortable.  The bedroom was very clean, bed comfortable, closet large with lots of hangers.  We had a clean private bath in our room.  Coffee and morning conversation was stimulating.  Beth is well traveled and is open and friendly.  I would definitely stay in the Ethiopian Cottage again."
1758935,24849776,2015-01-03,24051375,Jasmin,"Overall, the stay here was quite enjoyable. It was a very convenient location, with easy access to the airport and downtown by bus and train. The directions provided were very helpful in finding the place. We were greeted warmly, and offered coffee and tea as soon as we entered the door. The complementary items, such as coffee, snacks, wifi, and toiletries, were greatly appreciated. The room and house were very clean and comfortable, and the bed offered a great sleep. The room is even more spacious than in the picture, with a walk-in closet to store bags and a lovely private en-suite bathroom. The one thing that would have made our stay better is if the room and house were better heated. We found that the central heating left the place not much warmer than outside, and we were continually chilled. Other than that, the stay was wonderful, and I would definitely return."
1758935,25201037,2015-01-09,23654300,Ting,"It was the amazing experience .We lived in Beth's house for five days.The house is clean and comfortable.And Beth is so kind and enthusiastic .If we go to Seattle,we will also live with Beth.Haha..."
1758935,25282602,2015-01-11,23578751,Regina,Great stay at Beth's house for the weekend. Close to everything. Very nice neighborhood. Very pleasant host! 
1758935,25376529,2015-01-13,9430526,Gabrielle,"Beth's public transportation directions to the house from the airport were super clear and helpful, even in the evenin time when I arrived to my room. My accommodations were well met, all was clean and exactly the way Beth described it to be in her host page. Additionally Beth is nice and offered me morning beverages the following morning before I embarked on my Seattle getaway. All in all she was a  mood aging and affable. Thanks Beth!"

We highly recommend this if you are visiting Seattle and need a place close to downtown (the bus is 2 blocks away and  a short commute to 4th and Pike st).

During our stay we were able to get great advice on Seattle life.

Thank you so much for your kindness and hope to see you again soon.

1758935,27872467,2015-03-14,25862485,Christina,"We could not have had a better experience in Beth's lovely home. The room was very comfortable, clean, and well stocked with towels, basic toiletries, and maps of the surrounding areas. Beth and her family were very friendly and we appreciated the toast and fruit that was made available to us. The neighborhood was very nice, and the walk to Lake Washington was absolutely beautiful. We would also highly recommend taking the bus to Seward Park if you have the time. Overall, we had a great first time in Seattle and a perfect stay in Beth's home. "
1758935,28101696,2015-03-17,28832570,文捷,"We arrived Beth's house in a raining afternoon, however, we felt so warm and comfortable in her place. She is such a lovely and sweet lady. Had a pleasant talk with Beth, shared our couchsurfing experience, and met other travelers in her house. Really really a nice Airbnb experience for me. "
1758935,28197572,2015-03-19,18203118,Henry,"Beth is kind, hospitable, and open minded. The space is spacious and comfortable. I am 100% satisfied. Thanks Beth!"
1758935,28241289,2015-03-20,10268859,Sawinee,"I love this place and the Host! Beth and DD, Beth'a aunt, are very sweet and very good host. We arrived later than plan but once we called arrival, DD came to open the house right away. Rooms are exactly the pictures display. It's clean, good temp, good size, and in quiet and safe neibor. We had cottage#1 with toilet, it's perfect! Transportation is not a problem, we easily drove in and have a parking lot. Then we took train to city, it's just 15 mins walk to Mt. Baker station or as reviewed, No.7 is right in front. We walked from train at 10 pm, nothing seems dangerous. Beth also invited us for breakfast, thank you very much :) We really really recommend this place for staying in Seattle! And we will come back here again. "
1758935,28437818,2015-03-23,29245159,Meghan,"Beth was a very nice host! The accommodations were just as we expected and we were very comfortable staying there! Beth was helpful in explaining the bus routes and suggesting places to visit. She was very welcoming, would stay with her again!"
1758935,28864238,2015-03-31,25334113,Diana,"Bethy is such a friendly host!  She made our first BnB experience really positive.  She's easy to get in contact with and is really pleasant to talk to when we have questions or just want to tell her about our adventures for the day. She is also quite knowledgeable about the area and has great advice about where to go, where to park, and what to see. 

The room is as shown in the picture and the shower/bathroom fits one person standing.  The house is within walking distance to a grocery store and some smaller restaurants.  If you're interested in indoor rock climbing, there's a sweet gym down the street-- 15 minutes walking, 4 minute drive? The house is also located within 5 min walking distance to the bus line, which can take you to the downtown area and save you time and energy on parking. 
"
1758935,29410876,2015-04-07,28375003,Clarie,"When my guest and I arrived at Beth's home, we were greeted by her sister as Beth was at work. While our interactions with Beth and her family were limited, they were positive. The room was clean and quiet. The neighborhood felt safe and was quiet. Beth was prompt in responding to emails. I would stay here again the next time I'm in town."
1758935,29553764,2015-04-09,19643290,Brenda,What can I say that hasn't been said before? Beth is an incredible person. She welcomed us into her home with open arms. She is very kind and easy to talk to. She made my first airbnb experience very incredible. She is very accommodating and flexible. She was able to work around our flight schedule and allowed us to check in and drop off our things before the usual check in time. I would recommend her to anyone in a heart beat. And I will most certainly stay with her in my next trip to Seattle. 
1758935,29647626,2015-04-10,30719272,Meredith,"The Ethopian Cottage was our first experience with Airbnb and we felt welcomed and at home!  Beth was delightful, other guests were friendly, the house was set up perfectly to fit guests' needs.  Great location, fast access to downtown either by bus, cab or Uber.  Friendly neighbor cat to greet us too!  "

There are many clean towels and bottle water. The only thing we didn't expect is the showering space very very small."
1758935,30219225,2015-04-19,29590211,Claudia,房東的姐姐人很好，很熱心介紹屋內的設施給我們，還説可以隨便用，咖啡、水果也可以自己拿來吃，還載我們到附近社區轉了一圈。房間十分整潔，設備齊全，很舒適。屋子的地理位置也算方便，巴士可到downtown
1758935,30277292,2015-04-20,25095460,美奇,Very good！在bath家住的很开心，温暖干净的房间，洗澡水很棒，床也很舒服。距离超级市场很近，吃饭也方便。Bath很热情，其他客人也很友好，真是愉快的体验。
1758935,30456243,2015-04-22,114298,Sarah,"Beth was a very accommodating host. We stayed at her place for one night in Seattle, and all the amenities she provided were perfect for our needs. This was my husband's very first Airbnb experience (not my first though:) and he was thoroughly pleased that we chose Beth's place. Thanks again Beth for hosting us!"
1758935,30618614,2015-04-25,26287627,Yuan,Beth and her aunt are really kind host who have been really helpful. It was a quiet and beautiful neighbourhood. The bed was super comfy！

1758935,31198134,2015-05-03,29880266,Tamara,"Sehe netter Kontakt, aber leider ist etwas dazwischen gekommen und wir konnten nicht bei Beth schlafen, da sie ihr Haus gerade gestrichen hat. Dennoch hat sie uns ein Hotel gebucht und bezahlt. Also war es völlig okay, wir wurden aber davon überrascht. Sonst kann ich sie weiterempfehlen :)"
1758935,31995301,2015-05-12,32168547,Tom,"This may very well be the best value in Seattle! Great room, spacious and clean. The house is only 15 minutes from downtown. Easy to find, easy to find parking.

Unfortunately, Beth was out of town. We had an easy time getting in though. If we come back to Seattle, I think we'll be coming back here to stay. 

My only regret is not getting to meet Beth. She was fantastic in all our communications."
1758935,32229922,2015-05-16,25723032,Lance,"Beth's place was exactly like the photos and a great place away from the bustle of the city - but still a quick 15 minute bus ride on the number 7. 
I would recommend Beth's to anyone visiting Seattle. "

1758935,32746807,2015-05-21,20703821,Brandi,"I felt very comfortable and at home at Beth's house.  Beth is very kind and was willing to answer any questions I had.  The room/bathroom were very clean when I arrived and the room has it's own lock and key, which made me feel safe in leaving any valuables behind while adventuring around Seattle.  Beth's house is located very close to a major bus line that drops you off two blocks away from Pike's Place Market and is easily connected to other bus lines that go all over Seattle.  Don't forget to get an Orca Card for easy payment if you plan on using public transportation.  I felt comfortable in coming and going as I pleased, so I felt okay about staying out a little late on a couple of the nights I stayed.  The neighborhood was peaceful, so this room is perfect for one or two travelers who like to stay in a quiet neighborhood.  Overall, Beth's Ethiopian Cottage #1 is lovely :)"
1758935,32879825,2015-05-23,66947,Dea-Anne,"Our host welcomed us and was lovely to talk with. She had our room so nicely done and many little touches like bottle water in our room was great.Thanks Beth it was lovely to meet you, your daughter, and Aunt.

1758935,33352856,2015-05-27,8254246,Gilberto,"Eu estive na casa da Beth por dois dias em Maio de 2015. Ela havia viajado e deixou sua tia para receber os hóspedes. Foi uma excelente experiencia pessoal. Conheci pessoas amaveis, atenciosas e muito receptivas. Tive tanta empatia, que fu conhecer a vida da comunidade etíope em Seattle, e essa foi outra expetacular experiencia.
Quanto a hospedagem, uma casa MUITO limpa e confortável num bairro residencial. Fiz novos amigos e conheci pessoas muito educadas e felizes"
1758935,33906691,2015-06-02,29772779,Marie,Den and I were made to feel very welcome. It was our first experience with staying at an Airbnb and we were a little apprehensive. We certainly had nothing to worry about. The room was exactly as it was described and very comfortable. Transport and shops were within walking distance. Beth was very helpful with advise on tours and transport. We will be back. Thank you for your kindness and assistance.

1758935,34817731,2015-06-12,34520978,Venessa,"Beth was responsive in replying to my questions as a first timer. We arrived and she was welcoming and kind. The room was as shown. We were allowed to store our beverages in her fridge, and she even set them out before we left so we wouldn't forget. Great place, good location, nice host. Would recommend. "
1758935,34886112,2015-06-13,33682358,Sarah,"The experience was amazing. We instantly felt at home as soon as we arrived.

Thank you so much!!"
1758935,35658338,2015-06-21,6422664,Laurie,"We enjoyed our stay at Beth's! We didn't actually spend a ton of time there because we were so busy going out to see all the sights, but we really appreciated having a quiet, clean, comfortable place to come back to every night. The bed was extremely comfortable! We had everything we needed. It was about a 15 min drive to downtown Seattle- a fine location. "
1758935,36117747,2015-06-25,33251746,Dani,"Beth is a wonderful, responsive host who opened her home to us.  The location was perfect and within a 15 minute drive to most places we wanted to visit, with a lovely Safeway just down the street.  The best part of the room was how quiet and secluded it felt and the queen bed was very comfortable.  Beth had coffee, tea, toast and fruit available for us for breakfast.  "
1758935,36731258,2015-06-30,6982551,Erica & Adam,"We had a lovely stay at Beth's. We were met at the door with a smile. There are a few other Airbnb rooms in the house, but we didn't see or hear any of the other guests. Plus, this room has a private bath, which is nice. Comfortable room!"

We enjoyed our walk from Beth's home to our destination each day, wild blueberries, strawberries and beautiful flowers growing everywhere.  Thank you Beth!"
1758935,37551566,2015-07-08,29058434,Jean-Yves,Beth is a wonderful person. She is welcoming and generous. She made us feel at home and even took time after work to take us around to places we wouldn't have visited otherwise and treated us to a drink. We were very happy to be at her place. We couldn't have asked for a better host.
1758935,37658183,2015-07-09,33518205,Sue,"Because of my schedule, I never actually met Beth, but she was extremely accommodating and helpful.  My room was spotless with generous space and private bath.  I had a very comfortable night's sleep and would gladly book another stay with her."
1758935,37731874,2015-07-10,28912544,Mara,"Beth was a wonderful host and her ethiopian cottage was a great place to stay while visiting Seattle. She was very welcoming and we immediatly felt at home. She even provided us with an extra matress, when my son decided to not sleep in the bed. When we met her in the street she gave us a lift and took us on a ride through the neighborhood. It was great to meet her in the kitchen or on the porch to chat a bit. And she really is open minded and interested. We also had all the privacy we needed and would always come back to stay with her."

Beth has basically everything prepared: toiletries, bottled water in the room, bread and fruits... If I'm visiting Seattle again I'll definitely come back. :)"
1758935,38499599,2015-07-16,32341840,Tereza,"The stay at Beth´s place was very comfortable. Everything was OK, Beth and her aunt are very nice. I would recommend this accomodation to everybody who wants to visit Seattle. It is easy to get there by bus, you don´t need car. We were very satisfied with this airbnb place. Thank you Beth."
1758935,39391059,2015-07-23,16318104,Angela,"Actually, we arrived at the house around 10am, DD checked us into the home, and we drop our luggage first and then go for tourism. The room is clean and is exactly like the description. And the house is not far from the attractions such as Pike market, if you can not drive, the bus is also nearby.  There seems some misunderstanding for her maid because our early arrival makes her feel confusing. Overall, it is a pleasant stay.

1758935,41189064,2015-08-05,27714846,Beth,"Beth was a wonderful host, helpful, easy to deal with, and made us feel safe and welcome.  The room was accurately described with everything a traveller could want and a very comfy bed.  Seems Beth has thought of everything!  Plenty of privacy and freedom to relax in the common areas of the house.  Unsure about the neighbourhood, but it seemed safe enough to walk around during the day, close to nearby shops and easy enough to catch public transport into the city.  Thanks for making our first Airbnb experience such a positive one, we would definitely stay here again!  ☺"
1758935,41615539,2015-08-08,35731755,Andy,Beth was awesome!!

We highly recommend staying with Beth - she is a great host - we lacked nothing!"
1758935,42381506,2015-08-13,3491796,Christina,"My boyfriend and i went there by car, free parking is possible. Bethy is a really thoughtful, friendly host and everything was great. She provides all you need, we didn' t miss a thing. We enjoyed to see another side of Seattle apart from downtown taking a walk through the neighbourhood, along the lake Washington to the seward Park, which was beautiful! Highly recommended."
1758935,42514975,2015-08-14,21382183,Tasneem,"We had a comfortable night at Beth's. Her place is just as described in the post. It's a cozy, neat, and tidy.

This being our first time using AirBnB, we were a little apprehensive about what the experience was going to be like, and we were excited to find that it was exactly like we had wanted it to be. "
1758935,43361301,2015-08-19,22972580,Christiane,"We stayed in seattle for only one night and we really enjoyed our stay with Beth and her aunt. We arrived later than expected, so no one was there to open the door,so we called Beth and she made the access to the building very easy and comfortable for us. The room was spacious and clean. They offered breakfast and hot coffee in the morning.
Unfortunately we didn't meet Beth in person but her aunt DD was there to help us with everything we needed. She even has taken us to the train station early in the morning, when the taxi we've ordered didn't show up. We highly recommend Beth and her aunt as hosts!"
1758935,44055737,2015-08-23,25145346,Karla,Great location! Asked Beth to drop off our luggage ahead of check-in time and she was very understanding. The room was clean and the bed was comfy. Overall great experience.

Overall, it was a really good experience!"
1758935,44342446,2015-08-25,25080471,Justin,"This was a great place to stay overall. I was only in for one night after arriving on a late flight into town. Beth was very accomodating and helpful with my travel schedule. While Beth and I only had a few minutes of personal interaction, I would gladly stay with her again. The room was tidy and clean, and there was an info sheet on the wall that listed the wifi password, guidelines for use of the kitchen space, and other really helpful info. The next day, I toured around the city a bit, and she allowed me to leave my larger suitcase in the house until I was ready to pick it up and move on later that evening."
1758935,44405535,2015-08-26,8218211,Don And Karen,This was our second stay at the Ethopian Cottage.  Bethy was ready for us with a wonderful smile.
1758935,45234280,2015-09-01,26989977,Beate,"Beth was a very warm and welcoming host. She is so easy to talk to and open for our questions. The room and private bathroom was exactly like in the description, clean and practically equipped with many hooks and place to put your things on. There were things for having breakfast and coffee and tea. Our first experiance with airbnb was really great and we felt very comfortable. Thank you Beth!"
1758935,45402568,2015-09-02,3731675,Amy,This is a lovely space and very comfortable.  Beth and Dede are very sweet!  Very close to public transportation and very easy to get around.

The listing was very clean. Cottage #1 has a bathroom in the room, which was very nice. 

Beth communicated well. We unexpectedly showed up early, and she was there to greet us. We had a very nice time. "
1758935,45811845,2015-09-06,645757,Mankit,It was a great get away for both of us. The place was neat and clean. Towels and essentials are provided. Great insulation and a lot of privacy because we have our own bathroom. Beth has been relatively prompt with the messaging.
1758935,46276398,2015-09-09,36023912,Cam Thuy,"We had a great stay in Beth's house. The room and communal area are very clean and tidy. Beth is a lovely person and was very helpful to us. Highly recommended! Cam, Phillip and little Ernie."
1758935,46477365,2015-09-11,30346342,Sven & Sarah,"Beth is a great and really friendly host. It was the first time we used airbnb and we were surprised, how easy it was, even though our plane was late and we arrived really late. Beth made us feel like home. "
1758935,46571712,2015-09-12,25944213,Lynda,"Thank you again for the place to stay. Clean, comfortable and convenient!  And thank you for allowing us to leave our car at your place for a week!!  That was so wonderful of you!  Your Aunt was an excellent guide through the city and so kind to drive us to the Pier!!  We will be back!"
1758935,47260704,2015-09-17,35201727,Janneke,"We hebben 4 nachten bij Beth geslapen. Zij was die avond niet thuis maar haar dochter heeft ons prima wegwijs gemaakt. De kamer heeft een heerlijk bed en privé badkamer wat wij erg fijn vonden. De andere twee slaapkamers die werden verhuurd die deelde een andere badkamer. We konden allemaal vrij gebruik maken van de keuken en iedere dag zorgde Beth voor een pot verse koffie. Vlakbij het huis is een plein met een grote winkel en wat fastfood restaurants en op loopafstand leuke restaurantjes. Downtown seattle is wel wat verder weg, lopend 2 uren, maar met een hele goede busverbinding. Al met al waren wij heel tevreden."
1758935,47671676,2015-09-21,39176653,Anna,"While we didn't see much of Beth during our stay, we felt very welcome and looked after. The room was simple, attractively furnished, clean and well stocked with maps and leaflets about attractions in the city.  It was easy to find the bus stop to get downtown."
1758935,47876283,2015-09-21,6083531,Don,Beth was very friendly in welcoming me and showing me the house.  The room and bathroom were very clean and comfortable and what I expected from listing.  Very good value.
1758935,48315792,2015-09-25,26562421,Randy,"Beth was very gracious and welcoming, despite our late arrival.  Our room was exactly as pictured and very comfortable.    It was a great base for our two-day stay in Seattle, in a nice neighborhood and convenient to public transportation.  We highly recommend Beth's accommodations and would definitely stay there again. "
1758935,49000636,2015-09-30,39628175,Teresa,"Beth was very warm & welcoming, she was very friendly & made us feel very welcome in her home."

1758935,50609635,2015-10-12,16908314,Justine,"Beth was very welcoming. Loved the room , perfect size and very private. Would definitely stay again! "
1758935,50660800,2015-10-13,24565127,Ming,"Though it rained two days during our stay in Seattle, we had a great night at Beth's house. The room is warm and clean. We really love the bed which is very soft. Definitely we will recommend this place to my friends if they travel to Seattle."
1758935,50825906,2015-10-14,16793088,Steve,"I absolutely cannot recommend this house more highly. Beth's house is beautiful, the room is extremely spacious and the bathroom an en suite so there is total privacy. Both Beth and her aunt are really friendly. Beth left bottles of water in the room for us and breakfast items out, and allowed us to keep our bags for an extra period of time after checkout.
All this for an exceptionally great value price.
Highly highly highly recommended."
1758935,50862838,2015-10-15,7138156,Chul,"Super clean room.
Super compy bed.
Everything is perfect."
1758935,51437249,2015-10-20,41221497,Aiko,"Beth was such a great host! We arrived late at night in Seattle and she was still up waiting for our arrival. She is a very nice and cheerful lady, not to mention she always has a pot full of coffee prepared every morning! Her place is well kept and it was very convenient to have a private washroom. "
1758935,52056637,2015-10-26,35507509,Sharon,Thank You Beth
1758935,53400963,2015-11-08,47513465,Maxi,"We can really recommend it! We had a very nice stay. Beth stayed awake although we arrived very late! 
Thank you! "
1758935,53639904,2015-11-10,47582674,Niklas,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Beth's place. I can only recommend it to everyone. Beth is very friendly person, the place is in a clean and proper condition and the location of the house is appropriate if you want to discover Seattle and its surroundings. "
1758935,54309984,2015-11-18,32747798,Cara,"Absolutely gorgeous place in which you could feel Beth's hospitality in every aspect of the house and room. Everything was noticeably clean, tastefully decorated, and exceedingly beyond our expectations. We were just expecting a simple room to lay our heads at night. Instead, we had the use of a full house that immediately felt like home.

The bedroom had a luxuriously, comfortable bed, private bath, and locking door to aid in any level of privacy. The bathroom was fully stocked with plenty of towels and toilet paper. The living room, dining room, and kitchen was open to our use and was always clean and stocked with tea and coffee for us.  Beth and her family were perfect hosts, offering the level of interaction with us as we desired. She provided advice in getting around Seattle and ideas of awesome places to visit.

The neighborhood always felt safe and was well lit at night. Easy to find by car and two blocks away from public transportation, the house was a ideally situated to explore Seattle without the stresses associated with intercity travel and navigation.

We would stay here again in a heart beat! Thank you Beth for making our stay more amazing!"
1758935,56259801,2015-12-11,48595083,雨昕,这是我们在美国度过最棒的一周，beth一家都非常的热情，房间很好，干净明亮舒适。地理位置也不错，没有市中心的喧闹，但是坐公交去市中心只要15分钟，很方便。门口的safe way特别不错，记得第一次去就办一张会员，是免费的。感谢beth一家人的热情接待。^_^
1758935,56790464,2015-12-18,19603343,Jenny,"The room was very nice, exactly as how it was posted. Everyone was very nice! I didn't realize that multiple rooms were being rented out though, so that was a bit a of a surprise. The soap bar in the restroom was also used. Other than that, the stay was very enjoyable and warm. Thank you!"
1758935,56952515,2015-12-20,35786429,Bob,Very nice home. Convenient for our needs. Clean and full of everything we needed. Although we did not meet Beth in person we were able to quickly communicate via text and phone and she was very accommodating to our needs. Thank you.
1758935,57206626,2015-12-23,45631648,Evelyn,"We checked in with Aunt Dede, she was very nice and welcoming. There was always coffee, milk, bread, pb, and fruit available. It was very warm and clean! Bus stops were close!"
1758935,57494117,2015-12-26,18722723,宝东,"Beth were wonderful hosts and room was exactly as described. Everything was perfect, Beth was very nice and (email hidden)ey gave me a lot of help, I'm very happy to live at home, The bed is very comfortable, the room is very clean, I would love to come back and stay here again if I had a chance to be back in Sacramento. Because my English is not good, so can only write these.
Thank you very much!

9929059,56359165,2015-12-12,2169120,Rob,Fantastic. Exactly as advertised! 
9929059,56976222,2015-12-20,43180939,Amanda,"James was a wonderful host and super accommodating. He made sure all directions and instructions for checking in/out were very straight forward and simple. He kept in great contact with me the entire time and was very easy to get ahold of. I couldn't have asked for a better host. The apartment was very clean and equipped with everything you need. Also, it is in an awesome location! Would most definitely stay here again!"
9929059,57492446,2015-12-26,51553886,Young,It was a really nice little apartment with kitchen and everything. Pleasant stay!
544433,1563397,2012-06-25,2350773,Cassie,"Our stay in Serina's apartment was absolutely wonderful! The location was excellent being right next to space needle and Seattle centre. If you catch the monorail from the Seattle centre it's takes you right to the shopping district and steps away from Pikes market or you can walk from the apartment which only took us approx 15mins.
The apartment had absolutely everything we needed, with so much attention to detail. From a hair dyer, ironing board, ipod dock to all the cooking utensils we needed.
On arrival we were welcomed but some fresh bakery goods and Serina also had a wonderful range tea and coffee for us. 
The apartment was spotlessly clean, beds really comfortable and fresh towels provided.
We definately recommend this apartment! 
Thank you Serina for such a warm, cosy apartment which made our Seattle experience so much more wonderful. We wish you all the best! 
"
544433,1624651,2012-07-03,2696771,Rachael,"Our stay at Serina's apartment was fantastic!  The apartment was really cute - great little kitchen!  And super clean. The location could not have been better. It was only a 5 min walk to the monorail to get downtown.  A 2 minute walk to the heart of the Queen Anne area. (go to Peso's if you like Mexican.  They have a great happy hour) 
Serina was the perfect host and so accomodating.  
She provided toiletries in the washroom.
(shampoo, conditioner, body wash, hairdryer)
The kitchen had everything you needed.  
We have a 3 month old baby, and Serina provided a change pad, baby wipes, and she even bought us some diaper rash cream and provided us with a few diapers.  
The baked goods from Macrina Bakery that Serina welcomed us with were amazing.  She even did light daily housekeeping.  (took the garbage out, brought new towels, vacuumed) 
We would stay here again - for sure.  You cannot beat the price per night of the apartment. You won't find anything that comes close. 
The location is SO central, and the apartment itself is great.  
Highly highly recommended!
"
544433,1700322,2012-07-13,1348738,Ernesto,"This was a hidden gem. The location was great. The apartment felt brand new, with all new appliances. It was like staying in a hotel with daily maid service, as Serina came in each day to change the towels, empty the garbage and simply ensure we had what we needed. The apartment had everything we needed in it. She even provided us with a library of her DVDs for our use.

During the check in process she had me sign a ""waiver""/contract type of document as to account for the items that were in the apartment, as well as serve as a tax document for Serina. I found it a bit strange since that's what I assumed airbnb's agreement was for - especially since a $300 deposit had been charged to me.

Apart from that, our stay was fine. It felt like home. It was uber clean. And we were comfortable enough to stay in to enjoy the apartment and cook nearly every day."
544433,1983467,2012-08-14,2871286,Frederic,Great apartment. Everything was perfect. Very comfortable and very well equiped. Location close to downtown.
544433,2064299,2012-08-22,1938288,Lorraine,The condo was everything we needed. The host met all of our needs & was available when we needed. It was clean & very well kept. It is walking distance to several attractions & a longer walk to other attractions. 
544433,2124732,2012-08-28,662669,Paul,"This was a wonderful apartment in a convenient part of the city.  Even though it's a one-bedroom apartment and smaller than our home, we never felt cramped.  In fact, it's spacious compared to a hotel room.

Serina was helpful and gracious and had clearly thought through all the details, so we really didn't have any problems.  We weren't surprised at all when we got to the apartment and looked around; it really is just as presented here.

It's extremely convenient if you're doing anything at Seattle Center (Space Needle, Chihuly Gardens and Glass, EMP, etc.)  We didn't mind the walk to Pike Place Market and there were a number of restaurants and convenience stores along the way in the Belltown neighborhood.  The free bus (Route 99) is a few minutes walk and can get you to the waterfront, Pike Place Market and Pioneer Square even quicker.

From the airport, we took light rail to Westlake Center, then got on the monorail to Seattle Center.  From there, it was about a ten-minute walk to the apartment.  Total cost: $5 per person!"
544433,2264706,2012-09-11,156832,Chiara,"Our stay at Serina's apartment was nothing short of wonderful. 
The location worked perfectly for us: close to downtown, the Space Needle and the Olympic Sculpture Park, yet in the middle of a nice residential area, close to many neighborhood shops and groceries. 
The apartment itself was perfect, and we felt immediately at home; everything looked brand new, very thoughtfully appointed and spotlessly clean; it was like staying at a four star hotel, only with an entire apartment (and full kitchen) at our disposal. 
Serina was a very sweet host, always helpful, responsive and very accommodating. She welcomed us with a box of pastries from the awesome Macrina bakery and a fully stocked coffee and tea set. She lives in the same complex so we could just walk over and knock at her door if we needed anything, which was definitely a plus. 
We couldn't have been happier with our choice and cannot recommend this place enough. "
544433,2312125,2012-09-17,737319,Kellee,"Serina's listing was amazing! It was impeccably clean with plenty of linens! Serina herself was a wonderful, communicative, reliable host who provided us with breakfast pastries, coffee, and even a bottle of wine :) I'd definitely stay here again, and I'd recommend anyone to book with Serina!"
544433,2340883,2012-09-18,3559550,Chandler,"Great location for Seattle Center and Downtown access.  Serina was very nice, and the apartment was as pictured.  Off-street parking garage was very useful and the access to the public bus lines was also great."
544433,2409687,2012-09-25,846595,Carter,"Great location and apartment. Serina was helpful and super nice. Only a few minutes from the bike trail along the water, the space needle and public market. She has safe parking available too. Had a great stay."
544433,2484733,2012-10-02,2405056,Jessica,"Had a great visit to Seattle and Serina's place was a good home base. Very clean with ample linens, hot beverages, and pastries! We were able to walk to the market and downtown areas in about 20 mins but we are from NYC and are used to lots of walking. There really weren't any great food options within walking distance. Serina had a parking spot in the garage for us which was helpful. Very comfortable accommodations!"
544433,2632923,2012-10-16,785465,Dave,"We had a great stay at 209 -- perfect location for a 1-week stay to attend a conference downtown, at a very reasonable price. The place is small but has everything you could want including fully equipped kitchen and washer/dryer. Serina was great and the place was very clean. We'll be back for our next visit to Seattle."
544433,2852366,2012-11-10,45570,Anasa,Serina was great. She was very helpful and very responsive. The apartment is super cute and very comfortable. We would definitely stay here again! Thanks Serina!!
544433,2863103,2012-11-12,724434,Lieghti,"This listing was great. It's walking distance to great restaurants and the Space Needle. Serina was an attentive host before and during the reservation. She responded to all of my emails. Check in went smoothly, which was a great after a long drive into town. 

I hope to stay here again when I come back to Seattle. I highly recommend this listing. "
544433,2910212,2012-11-18,4129051,Robert,"Serina's residence is wonderful!  If you are looking to stay right near the Key Arena, Space Needle, and within walking distance to great restaurants and bars, you should definitely stay at Serina's apartment.  It is so much better than staying at a traditional hotel and has everything you could ever need for a short or extended stay!"
544433,2952071,2012-11-24,4056707,Andy,"Serina's apartment was wonderful and she was very nice. The apt is cute and came with everything we could have needed. It's also in a great location, walking distance to downtown. Serina also left us with some wine that we were able to enjoy. We would definitely stay with her again. "
544433,3045825,2012-12-08,3849065,Max,"Great location!  Right next to the Space Needle, and a couple of blocks to restaurants.  Apartment had everything you could ask for."
544433,3197460,2012-12-31,91381,Antje,"Serina is an amazing host, very warm and welcoming. From the moment I arrived to the moment I left she made sure I was ok. I felt right at home. The apartment itself is absolutely lovely. It has everything one needs for a comfortable stay. It is also in a perfect location. Everything (downtown Seattle, nearby attractions, grocery store...) is within walking distance and also easily accessible by public transportation. I highly recommend this apartment and will stay there again when back in Seattle. "
544433,3224497,2013-01-02,4275974,Melissa,"Serina was a wonderful host, and I thoroughly enjoyed my short stay.  It was great to be able to walk up to the Seattle Center, and I was also happy that the Metropolitan Market was only about 4 blocks away...easily walkable, with a wide selection of organic groceries.  The entertainment system was top notch and there was even a good little selection of DVDs available.  The kitchen has a bare minimum of equipment, but it does have the basics covered.  All in all, a great city getaway spot!"
544433,3453808,2013-02-01,4398137,Paul,"I recently enjoyed an 11-day stay at Serina's lovely apartment. Contrary to other comments, the apartment is conveniently located to nearly everything in downtown Seattle if you are willing to walk (If not, grab a cab. You can get to Capitol Hill, Ballard, or Fremont for $7-$10). For example, Pikes Market is only twenty minutes away by foot. There are also dozens of excellent restaurants and bars within the vicinity. Want to eat in? Stroll a few blocks to Metropolitan Market and pick up groceries to cook in the unit. 

Be advised that you will be staying in the city. And as with any city, just be wary when out at night. Bring earplugs if street noise bothers you - This is an older building with thin walls.

I love Seattle and this apartment was perfect for my needs. Beat the hell out of hotel rates. Serina is a gracious host and her husband will help you with recommendations if you are fortunate enough to meet them both. 

This apartment is well worth considering for your trip. Especially for the parking convenience. 

Thank you Serina!"
544433,3503536,2013-02-09,4810733,Haejin,I stayed one week here on Feb. The place is quite & warm and close to Space Needle and Pike Place Market. Serina is a wonderful host as well. 
544433,3697805,2013-03-05,1681897,Christine,"My mom, son, and I stayed at Serina's apartment for 3 nights. We had a wonderful time, and the apt. is great!!! It is very well located, within walking distance to everything (major sites, transportation, grocery stores, restaurants, etc.). The apt. was super clean and very comfortable, had everything we needed, and Serina even had shampoo, conditioner, soap, laundry detergent, as well as teas and coffee for our use. Serina was extremely friendly, and brought us 3 pastries on the night of our arrival :). We also met her husband, and he provided great suggestions for eating, what to see and do, etc. Overall, I would highly recommend staying here, and would LOVE to return to Seattle and Serina's apt!!!"
544433,3728097,2013-03-09,4702233,Daniel,"The apartment was great! The location is very central, close to all the major sights. We were able to walk to everything and rarely used our car. The check-in/out process was very easy and Serina is great, very helpful. The internet and entertainment equipment is really good and easy to use, the kitchen has all the necessary utensils. Had a great time, would definitely stay there again."
544433,3876476,2013-03-24,2261214,Elissa,"Wow!  What a wonderful apartment and host!  My husband and I stayed here and it was our first Airbnb experience so we didn't really know what to expect, but I doubt we will ever stay in a hotel again!!!
The apartment was super clean, the bed was more comfortable than our own!, and it was fairly quiet too :)  The sound system is great, the kitchen utensils were perfect for what we needed to cook lots of fish, and Serena had left us all the necessities!  The parking space was just fine for our rental car, and proved to be very useful!!She had even been so kind as to leave us some fruit and some delicious pastries!! She was very sweet and thoughtful and I cannot recommend this apartment highly enough! It was not far from downtown and the bus took us about 10 minutes and was easy to find!  If we ever go back to Seattle, we'll definitely stay again!!  Thanks Serena :-D"
544433,3926922,2013-03-28,4925117,Macarena,"We had a wonderful stay at this apartment, everything went just perfect. Great location, super nice, clean, well equipped apartment. We would absolutely stay there again and highly recommend it.

In long: It looks exactly like the pictures, so no surprises there. It is very nice, everything looks fairly new or in very good shape. We spent four nights there, with my husband and one year old daughter and were very comfortable the whole time. The bedroom  is pretty big, is completely separated from the other areas and has a big closet. We had no trouble with noises at night or anything like that.
The kitchen was very well equipped, it had all the necessary things to cook a normal meal (pots, plates, knives, etc. and also olive oil, salt and pepper), plus a coffee maker (with coffee, tea and chocolate) and a dishwasher.
Internet worked perfect. There was also a TV, a DVD player player a sound system, plus some books and movies!
We found the location excellent, it is very close to the Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP, etc), which we visited a couple of times and it's a few minutes away from downtown by car, bus or monorail.
Serina was very nice to us and helped us with everything we asked for, plus patiently waiting for since we arrived 2 hours late!
Again, I highly recommend this apartment and would definitely come back.

544433,4523970,2013-05-10,574713,Paul,"Serina was an excellent host. Very thorough, the apartment was very clean, and the location was excellent. Highly recommend!"
544433,4689884,2013-05-20,6259807,Andy,What a great place to stay!  Serina is a great host and welcomed us when we got there.  We parked our car and walked everywhere.  Walked to the Market and Pacific Place.  Tons of places to eat nearby.  Much better than staying at a hotel.
544433,4805426,2013-05-27,131677,Christin,"This apartment was great for our weekend in Seattle.  The location is top notch and even though it's central to many parts of the city the area is quiet and I slept like a baby. Amenities were hotel-standard but better--think bath towels that are actually soft, a filtered water pitcher in the fridge, fresh cut peonies, and even a first aid kit.   

The apartment was super clean, the bed was very comfortable, and Serina really thought of everything that a guest might need to have during their time there. I would love to stay here again.

"
544433,4886615,2013-05-31,5090988,Cristina And Daniel,"Serina's place is great and she is a wonderful host.  The place has a comfortable bed, very clean bathroom and kitchen, washer/dryer, and parking!  We brought our six month old twins and Serina left a changing pad and separate trash can for the diapers.  Very  thoughtful.  Also appreciated the fresh pastries and the plentiful supply of hot chocolate, coffee and tea.  Excellent value and wonderful host."
544433,4946721,2013-06-03,891813,Stacy,"We enjoyed our stay at Serina's apartment. It was well equipped and pleasant had everything we needed, including toiletries, tea & coffee, a map of the area. Serina was only a few doors down and made sure we knew we could contact her if we needed anything. The location was close to restaurants and the Seattle Center and walking distance to the waterfront. We enjoyed our stay and I would recommend this place. "
544433,5003202,2013-06-06,3720053,Mercedes,"Serina's apartment was very nice, spotlessly clean, and every detail was thoughtfully attended to. Serina was also very gracious. I would stay again."
544433,5096993,2013-06-12,4755301,Fabian,"It's a great place to stay in Seattle. You can walk to the Seattle Center, Downtown, Pike Place Market and the waterfront. Public transport you reach in less than two minutes. The flat has everything you need and is very clean. Serena was a very kind and helpful host. If we come back to Seattle we definitely will stay at Serenas place. "
544433,5179010,2013-06-17,866340,Kunal,"Serina's place is right smack in the middle of Seattle downtown, close to all touristy places and only 20 mins walk to Pike's place. With parking available on property, it was a no brainer for us as we only wanted this place because of its proximity to everything, and of course the size and amenities. Serina was super helpful with all the questions and even bought is couple of amazing pastries from local bakery.  Thanks Serina."
544433,5311215,2013-06-24,5928875,Otik,"This was our first experience with AirBnb and if every place is like Serina's we'll definitely be looking here instead of hotels. First, the location is great, just a couple blocks from the Seattle Center. Having a parking spot was also wonderful since parking can be difficult and pricey in this area. Although the outside of the building is a bit run down, inside the apartment is very nicely done and spacious. The washer/dryer combo came in especially handy. Finally, Serina is such a great host. Besides leaving us some very tasty pastries on arrival, she brought us several kids movies for our boys to watch. 

We couldn't have asked for a better experience and I'll definitely stay here again when I'm in Seattle. "
544433,5388727,2013-06-27,7026288,Heidi,"I've been wanting to try out Airbnb for awhile now and Serina's apartment exceeded my expectations! Its in a fantastic location with great food (try Pesos Mexican on Queen Anne) and a fantastic market where she got us pastries for the morning. Getting downtown is a breeze and made it super easy for us to see and do everything we wanted!

The apartment itself is super clean and comfortable and Serina really did think of everything. I would definitely recommend checking Serina's place out and look forward to returning soon!"
544433,5458235,2013-07-01,6387167,Barry,"Serina was very nice and her apartment was perfect for my wife and I. Was very clean and a great location just maybe 10 minutes from downtown and only 3 blocks from the Space Needle and Mono-Rail. But if you really want to see something great, forget the Needle and instead do the Chihuly Garden and Glass exhibit next door. Much better use of time and money.
"
544433,5528241,2013-07-04,6696503,Theresa,Serina's accommodations in the Queen Anne area of Seattle were fantastic.  She was a wonderful host; very helpful and accomodating.  Her 1 bedroom apartment is near Seattle Center.  We walked everywhere and if we didn't feel like walking public transportation options were close by!  Good food and good sights are nearby.  Her apartment is in the best location.  We hit all the major tourist attractions on foot or via public transportation.  We loved Seattle and we loved 209 !st Street North!  Thank you Serina! 
544433,5631681,2013-07-09,2988245,Peter,"The apartment was just as described. It was a very neat and clean unit with all the amenities needed. For our particular vacation plans, the location was perfect! We were attending an event at the Seattle Center and the apartment was literally 2 blocks away. The free, off-street parking was a big plus since we did have a rental car. Keep in mind that this is an apartment in the city, there is the typical big city noise such as traffic, sirens, people walking by outside. None of these things bothered us in the least. We felt safe walking the neighborhood and there are plenty of restaurants and markets within walking distance. It was also an easy 1 mile walk to the Pike Market area of downtown. Once you learn the main routes, getting to and from the freeway and other main roads was a piece of cake. Serina was a great host and everything could not have went any smoother. We thank her for a great AirBnB experience and a wonderful Seattle vacation!"
544433,5751040,2013-07-15,5926719,Randy,"Staying with Serina was our first experience with Airbnb, and we were very pleased with all aspects of our stay in Seattle.

Long story short, the apartment was exactly as described and perfect for our adventures in a new (for us) city. We had everything we needed provided, and if there had been any other needs, Serina made it clear she was happy to help. She also recommended some great places for us to visit while we were in town. I highly recommend staying with Serina. "
544433,5850924,2013-07-19,7188022,Mylene,"Wow! What a great apartment. We stayed for 4 nights and were extremely happy with everything that this apartment offered. It is perfectly situated within walking distance to pike place and Seattle center. Not having to pay for parking was a huge plus.  The strawberry pastries that Serina gave us upon our arrival were delicious!  Serina is a great host. She is very helpful and easy to deal with. When we come back to Seattle, we will definitely be staying here again. "
544433,5907157,2013-07-22,5382024,Lynne,"Great apartment, very clean, very centrally located. We walked to Pike Place Market, attractions around the Space Needle (EMP, Chihuly Garden and Glass) and to the art museum. Serina was very welcoming and greeted us in person. The in-apartment washer/dryer was really nice to have. She even left us delicious pastries on our first day! Skip the hotel and gain extra space, quiet and a better location at Serina's place."
544433,5999273,2013-07-26,5202347,Ellen,"Location in Belltown super convenient to Seattle Center & Space Needle, Chihuly Glass and Gardens.  Ten-minute walk to Pike Place too.  Serina took great care of us.  Loved the breakfast pastries on day one, and she went above and beyond by even holding our bags to late afternoon for us on check-out day.  Would like to have had Cable TV (only analog of broadcast channels was available) but otherwise a great place to stay."
544433,6055490,2013-07-28,7376232,Nora,"The apartment is very nice and clean, and in a great location. You can walk to a lot of major attractions or down to the waterfront, and there is a lot of public transportation nearby. Serina is a great host! "
544433,6211330,2013-08-04,5277686,Joy,"My husband and I spent a very comfortable week in Serina's apartment. She is a delightful host -- available but not intrusive -- and her attention to detail in appointing this one-bedroom apartment is astonishingly thorough. We had what we needed in order to cook and clean (laundry too!) right in the apartment, and two grocery stores were within a few blocks. The location was excellent, as we were attending events in Seattle Center at McCaw Hall. It was an easy walk (10 min.), and it was great to be able to park our car at the apartment and not deal with parking and fees. In the ""above and beyond"" department, Serina has provided a nice assortment of DVD movies and a selection of books, both of which should provide most guests with some entertainment in quiet times. If I am looking for housing in Seattle again, Serina will be my first choice!"
544433,6386247,2013-08-11,2006941,Michael,"We had a great experience renting this apartment. It is right by Seattle City Center (i.e. - Space Needle, theaters, museums). Serina not only got us checked in, but bought us a blender to use and gave us some excellent tips for a trip to the wine country. Highly recommended. "
544433,6579919,2013-08-18,2753958,Charles,"Nice apartment setup. Location is within walking distance for visiting downtown Seattle, the Space Needle and Key Arena, with little hustle and bustle near the unit itself. Comes with kitchen, microwave, Keurig coffee maker, dishes, washer/dryer in the unit, and Internet access. Very clean. Serina answered all our questions and concerns. Would stay again."
544433,6842096,2013-08-27,419018,Judi,"The apartment was airy, the plumbing was nearly faultless and and Serina provided absolutely everything from tissues to makeup wipes to a well-stocked kitchen and laundry area.  The hi-fi equipment was tricky for non-geeks to figure out and a better manual was needed for it and for the clock-radio (which we never did figure out) but Serina was usually at beck and call.  Location was magnificent for Space Needle and museums and amusements near it, and for the theatre and opera complex.  In brief, we recommend the place highly."
544433,6916473,2013-08-30,6453750,Jack,Serina was a great host and the apartment is very close in regards to public transportation and the Seattle Center.  The apartment was very cozy and had everything we needed.  I highly recommend staying here if you are ever visiting Seattle!
544433,7064833,2013-09-05,5532477,Angie,My five day stay in Seattle wirh my boyfriend was perfect at Serina's place. We didn't even see another resident the whole time. It felt like it really was our home with lots of privacy. We went to Bumbershoot and the festival was literally three blocks away. Mecca cafe became our daily breakfast and there's plenty of stores around to make meals at home. The apt was perfectly clean and stocked with all the necessities. It was hard to leave to come back to LA! I would / am definitely planning on coming back! For my first airbnb experience this was awesome!! Thanks Serina!
544433,7157313,2013-09-09,7035494,Kate,Serina's place was great. She was super accommodating with checkin and gave us everything we needed. She even left us some delicious breakfast pastries.  
544433,7300465,2013-09-15,5664806,Miriam,My stay at Serina's could not have been better. The apartment really did feel like home and me and my husband were provided with everything we needed and more. The place was immaculate and Serina even provided toiletries and laundry detergent. The bathroom was well stocked with clean towels. She even gave us some yummy pastries upon arrival! I would definitely recommend staying here if you're in Seattle. Not only was the place a great place to hang out and sleep in but it was within walking distance to downtown and anywhere you could really think of! 
544433,7367480,2013-09-17,3274020,Alec,"This is a great apartment to explore Seattle from. It has all the necessities, is clean, and is in a great location. Serina was a very warm and welcoming host and even left us with some yummy pastries for breakfast. This is a great place to stay, especially if you're looking to explore central Seattle."
544433,7454756,2013-09-21,2256427,Joel And Lynette,"We booked this apartment for my mum and sister who came to visit.  The apartment was very clean and well appointed. There were extra amenities included, like toiletries and a Keurig coffee maker.  It was also really sweet of Serina to provide pastries for their breakfast on the first day.  We highly recommend this place!"
544433,7545831,2013-09-24,5550031,Elena,"Wow! We just loved Serina's apartment! It was clean, cute and perfect! Her spot is amazing, you can walk anywhere. We rented a car, and quickly realized that because of the location we didn't really need to as it is such a pedestrian friendly area and city!  Serina was a great host and got back to me quickly with any questions that I had. Serina's place had everything we needed! I would absolutely stay here again when visiting Seattle. "
544433,7689129,2013-09-30,799257,Andrew,"This place was amazing! It had everything. DVD’s, washer, drier, dish washer, heaps of towels, excellent cooking facilities and utensils, shampoo, conditioner, coffee, brand new slippers, you name it…
It was also incredibly clean, like it had been spring cleaned this morning.
It was close to transport, walking distance to downtown, restaurants and supermarkets nearby, walking distance to the Space Needle.
Serina was incredibly hospitable and friendly. Communication was excellent.
We had the perfect stay.
"
544433,7877158,2013-10-07,8343623,Ilda,"The apartment was very clean. Perfect for two people. Nice to have the pastry left by host for the next day breakfast. Great location.

544433,8275351,2013-10-23,7600993,Thuy,"Perfect location right next to the Space Needle & Key Arena. It's within walking distance to Pike Place and downtown. We parked at the designated spot ($5/day) and walked everywhere. The apartment had everything we needed and more. It was well decorated and furnished with a TV, free Wi-Fi, towels, shampoo, travel books, movies etc. Serina was the perfect host. She's quick with correspondence and met with us as soon as we arrived. She even left us pastries for breakfast. I would recommend her rental to anyone visiting the area."
544433,8377764,2013-10-28,628490,Maggie,"Serina was gracious and kind. Prior to our arrival, she provided instructions for travel from the airport using public transportation. She met us at the door when we arrived. While the building was more motel-like than charming, the apartment was clean, well-organized and stocked with thoughtful amenities including soaps, shampoo, coffee/tea and breakfast danishes! The location could not be better - easily walkable to the Space Needle, Olympic Sculpture Park, Pike's Market/Downtown, and central Queen Anne. Bus routes connect you directly with Ballard and other great Seattle neighborhoods. "
544433,8562725,2013-11-05,7512791,Miguel,"Me and my girlfriend had a awesome stay at Serina place it had everything we needed to enjoy your first time in Seattle awesome apartment, if we needed something she was happy to help and answers our questions about her place and Airbnb, ect. Everything was walking distance or a quick trip on the monorail, if you never been to Seattle this is the place to enjoy it. Thank you "

The apartment was in the perfect location. We rented a car, but left it parked at the apartment during our entire stay - everything we needed/ wanted was within walking distance. 

The apartment was very clean and well sized. The kitchen was fully equipped. There was a washer/ dryer combination unit, which was a life saver.

544433,9135369,2013-12-09,4938795,Scott,"Serina's apartment was an excellent place to stay! Everything was just as it appears in the photos, and the location was perfect...literally within a five minute walk to the Space Needle, Monorail, Key Arena, and plenty of restaurants and bars! Serina's a great host with good communication, very cool welcoming touches for our stay, and helpful local advice. We wouldn't hesitate at all to stay here again on our next visit to this incredible city!"
544433,9218243,2013-12-14,6370685,Marissa,"Serina was a great host! Only two blocks from Key Arena and a ten minute walk to downtown. Everything that was advertised in the listing lived up to my expectations. Although in town for work, my boyfriend and I attended a concert at Key Arena on one of the evenings and it was great to be so close and not have to hassle with parking and the crowds afterwards. I would highly recommend this rental to anybody who wants a great Seattle visit. Great Location and very clean and put together apartment. Slippers and Pastries on our first morning were provided and it was a great touch. This place is highly recommended. "

Amazing location, adorable apartment, and Serina thought of everything. Every toiletry we could imagine was available to us, and the complimentary coffee, tea, hot cocoa, and pastries were a great touch. As a former Seattlite, I'd highly recommend staying here for your Seattle vacation. "

544433,10202273,2014-02-06,3535767,Fei,"My husband and I spent 3 nights at Serina's apartment - it should have been 4, but our flight from the UK was delayed and we missed the connecting flight to Seattle.  Serina is a lovely host, and was very understanding and helpful when we arrived exhausted after 2 full days' travelling.

The apartment is spotlessly clean, comfortable and quiet. It was perfect for our needs, as was the location.  We walked to most places, but there are convenient busses on the doorstep, and a fabulous supermarket a few blocks away. We loved Seattle and wish we could have stayed longer.  We'd love to come back.  Thank you Serina for making our stay so enjoyable."

544433,10833986,2014-03-10,1645195,Elizabeth,This is the second time I have stayed in one of Serina's apartments for a conference.  The space was clean and had all that was needed for a four day stay.  I highly recommend and would stay here again.

544433,11311023,2014-03-29,10979629,Yingen,"My friend and I spent a wonderful time in Seattle. Serina's apartment is perfect for us. Everything in the apartment is clean and new. We felt like we were at home. Particularly, the apartment had a great location. We not only could walk to the Space Needle in 5 mins, but also could walk to the metropolitan market. There are lots of restaurants near the market. D line and 1 bus are very convenient to go the downtown or transfer other transportation. What's more, Serina is very nice and gives us many helpful advice for our trip! Thank you Serina~~!!"
544433,11456449,2014-04-03,2050609,Melissa,"A+ experience.  This apartment is spotless and rediculously close to the Space Needle and other activities in the heart of the Seattle.  You can walk to Pike's Place or head up to Queen Anne Hill to walk around the cute shops, etc.  Everything we wanted or needed was provided.  Our host was available, friendly and even let me borrow a yoga mat at 9:00 p.m.!  We had to leave super early in the morning so we didn't want to wake her to say thank you so...THANK YOU for the beautiful & clean place, perfect little mini-vacay and the yummy pastries provided for us!  We will return for sure!!"
544433,11542792,2014-04-07,4452015,Lynn,"Overall this apartment is a great deal. The location is good. Close to the space needle and walking to most locations including pike place market (about a mile). The rooms were simply furnished and the only complaint is the sofa/fold out- it is very thin and sagging. My husband and I had a hard time sitting on it- we would cave into the ground and each other. The hot water also did not last long. I had to boil water to finish the bath for our baby. Parking was also a little tricky. There is a garage across the street that isn't too expensive but you have to get a new ticket every 10 hours. Paid street parking is 4 hrs max during the day (except Sunday). We weren't able to use the parking available for the apartment because it can only accommodate a very small car (we have an outback). The parking situation meant we had to set an alarm to get up in time to move the car but overall it was manageable. Serina was very nice, brought us pastries, and allowed us to communicate via text messages for our convenience. "
544433,11618622,2014-04-09,1360465,Max,"Serina was a fantastic host. The apartment is setup like a true guest suite with all of the positive conveniences of a hotel, but none of the negatives! Fairly priced, nice neighborhood, great view of the space needle. Also, I had trouble unlocking the door to get into the unit (this was my fault) and Serina popped over and helped us get in. I recommend without hesitation."
544433,11687514,2014-04-12,12874474,David,Serina has a great space in an excellent location. It was very clean and she was most attentive to making sure our stay was perfect.

Thanks!"

Serina was easy to communicate with which is huge when traveling to a new city. She provides a manual in the apartment that is very valuable, providing all kinds of information about the city (and about the apartment itself). And, she welcomed us with a box of pastry! You will have a lovely stay at this apartment. "
544433,12253451,2014-04-27,14052560,Christina,"I loved the ease of booking with Serina since this was an instant book property.  With no need to go back and forth on emails, it made booking this place just as easy as booking a hotel.  

Upon walking in, there was a box with a delicious roll inside that was perfect for breakfast!  I thought this was a very thoughtful gesture on Serina's part.  

Great location - was able to walk to downtown and the bus stop for going to Capital Hill was only a block away.

There was a keurig machine for my morning coffee and the bed was comfortable as well.  

Overall it was a great stay and I highly recommend it!"

I would recommend highly to anyone staying in the area. "

Thanks so much again! "
544433,14411885,2014-06-18,564156,Steve,"Serina's Seattle apartment was simple, clean, affordable, and in a very convenient location. Serina was very organized and everything was as listed. The keypad on the door (no physical keys) is a nice small detail that makes a big difference in terms of convenience. While we did not need assistance with anything, it was nice knowing that Serina lives in the same building complex and easily accessible. Thanks Serina!"
544433,14550460,2014-06-22,12498029,Debra,We truly enjoyed staying in Serina's apartment.  It had everything we needed for our stay.  It was clean and inviting.  The proximity to all of the sites we visited was perfect.  Serina was even gracious enough to provide a ride to the Space Needle on our first night as I was a bit under the weather.  Serina is great and I wouldn't hesitate to stay in her Sparkling Seattle Center apartment again.

Serina was kind and always responded quickly to text questions. We hope to stay there next time we come up to Seattle. I highly recommend staying here if you are looking in the area.  "
544433,14965811,2014-06-30,8362771,Kristina,"nice apartment in a great, convienent location within walking distance to all the major attraction's in Seattle"
544433,15142984,2014-07-03,15961062,Melissa,"Serina's apartment is conveniently located and the parking spot was great. The check-in process was extremely convenient and we didn't have to worry about apartment keys the entire stay. 

I did laundry, so it was a plus to have the in-unit washer/dryer. 

Cute and cozy apartment in a convenient location for a great price. The additional fans in the unit were needed and great that they were provided as it was very warm temperatures during our stay.

Serina was very responsive and helpful prior to / during the stay. Would recommend her apartment! "
544433,15301978,2014-07-07,5363064,Brianne,"This listing was perfect for two people looking to explore the sites of Seattle. We were in town for a wedding, and this was a great alternative to the pricey wedding hotels. I was impressed by how clean and tidy the place was, and that it had a very comfortable bed. You have access to a washer/dryer , stove, and full size fridge -with a grocery store a 5 minute walk away, it was helpful to stock up on waters and snacks. The pastries Serina left were a great treat since our flight was delayed and we hadn't eaten in hours!"
544433,15572777,2014-07-12,14382806,Joann,"Thanks to Serina, I had a wonderful stay in Seattle while visiting my daughter and her fiance'.  The apartment was well-located, very clean, quiet at night, and very affordable!  Serina greeted me at check-in time and even left some goodies from a local bakery for my breakfast the next day!  I am certainly going to book this apartment again when I come back to Seattle! I have recommended it already to several others who want a nice place to stay!

544433,15667549,2014-07-14,6691355,Deborah,Very convenient to the Seattle Centre which was within walking distance. (Go see the Chihuly Glass and Garden exhibit if you are into large stunning glass artworks). The monorail also takes you straight into downtown Seattle and a short walk to Pike Street markets. The unit has everything you need and is clean and tidy and a good size. Serena is very helpful and easy to contact.  Thanks heaps.
544433,15949060,2014-07-19,7417331,Jerome,"Great location right next to the Seattle Center / Space Needle / Key Arena / EMP Museum. Belltown (dining), Downtown (shopping) or waterfront can easily reached by walking or public transportation. The apartment is very nice and clean. Well equipped kitchen with a washing machine / dryer. Serina is a super host - everything was just perfect. We had an awesome time in Seattle and were happy to have a ""nice little home"" to stay at."
544433,16338446,2014-07-26,13512037,Diana,"Serina made me feel very welcome, her instructions were very easy to follow and I had no trouble travelling by public transport. Clear instructions were also provided in a booklet. My appartment was quiet,spotless and very comfortable with a wonderfully fitted out kitchen. It is in a very interesting area, very close to transport,cafes and places of interest. I had a most wonderful week and cannot believe how kind, polite and helpful the people of Seattle are."
544433,16982265,2014-08-05,9892237,Deena,"Great apartment, great location -- Serina is a great host. We had pastries waiting for us when we arrived, which was a great welcome to have. The apartment is perfectly situated in Queen Anne, and the minute you walk out the front door, you see the famous, omnipresent Space Needle right in front. Serina also has mini-toiletries in the restroom -- a wonderful little touch. The apartment was clean, well-furnished and comfortable. The lock system (you get a code for the front door) is unique and incredibly convenient -- peace of mind that you couldn't accidentally lose the keys. We couldn't have asked for any more for our weekend stay!!"
544433,17200402,2014-08-09,4303655,Marissa,"Simply magnificent! The CLEANEST apartment ever! Walking distance to Science Space Center, EMP and the Space Needle and good brisk walk to the waterfront.  Serina was a fantastic host and attentive to every detail of the apartment.  You'll love it!!"
544433,17430706,2014-08-12,9337923,Tyler,"We had a wonderful time staying here.  We went to pike place market and picked up some fresh local food to cook in the apartment.  Everything worked out flawlessly, we highly recommend renting through Serina!!!!"
544433,17614486,2014-08-15,5635884,Daniel,"Serina ist eine sehr nette Gastgeberin. Das Apartment liegt nur wenige Schritte entfernt von der Space Needle und auch das Centrum ist zu Fuß gut zu erreichen, wenn man an den Piers lang läuft.

Das Apartment ist mit allem ausgestattet, was man braucht - auch der Film 'Sleepless in Seattle' gehört zu Inventar.

Ich würde wiederkommen! "
544433,17823478,2014-08-18,15400535,Dan,Wonderful place. Extremely close to some of the greatest parts of Seattle. Very clean and comfortable. Thanks Serina!
544433,18060025,2014-08-21,2976040,Aleksey,"Serina is a great host, you'll find everything you need in the apartment. And the location is really good."
544433,18519662,2014-08-28,14062411,Rick,Good communication. We had 3 units in the same building. 2 were fantastic and the 3rd one smelled like fish all week. Odd. Otherwise nice & clean. Great location. Safe.
544433,18869442,2014-09-02,249186,Laila,"Serina's apartment was perfect for our family trip to Seattle/Bumbershoot festival. The space was very clean and comfortable. We were greeted with some fresh baking which was a lovely touch. The Brita water filter and condiments/coffee were also very much appreciated. The location suited us perfectly, jut one block from Seattle centre and close to a few great grocery stores. We will definitely stay here again. "
544433,19066141,2014-09-06,5916535,Sarah,We einkotend our stay at Serina's apartment. She left some pastries for us for breakfast and they saved us since we arrived late. Very easy going and centrally located. I would definitely recommend it to others! 
544433,19263305,2014-09-09,16446063,Annie,"Serina was a great host and very helpful for my first time in Seattle! I had landed 4 hours before the check-in time at 4 PM and Serina graciously allowed me to leave my luggage in the garage until check-in time. The apartment was extremely clean and the amenities were very complete with shower necessities, towels, lotion, and even spare razors and makeup removers for those who forgot them! The location is in the lower Queen Anne neighborhood, right next to the Space Needle and the Seattle Center. I did not have a car in Seattle so it was still quite a bit of commute to Downtown and Pike Place Market (about 20-30 minutes) so if you're looking to mainly stay in the DT area, I would recommend finding a place there instead. However, if you do not mind the commute, this place is more than worth its price and Serina does her best in making it comfortable and homey for her guests. All in all, I had a very relaxing stay and would recommend this listing to everyone!"
544433,19513534,2014-09-14,15945666,Jo,"I simply could not have chosen a better place to stay for my first trip to Seattle! Serina has the cleanest apartment I have ever had the pleasure to stay in. It was way bigger than I was expecting with so much closet space to unpack and make myself really comfortable. The keyless check in was a breeze and I had absolutely no problems or issues whatsoever during my stay. The location was incredible - minutes walk to the Space Needle and EMP Museum and a lovely 20 min stroll to downtown and Pike Place Market and the waterfront, as well as a bus stop nearby to take you anywhere else in the city. One of the nicest things about Serina's apartment is the little things she thought to include to make my stay more comfortable - an umbrella, first aid kit, extra toiletries, all the little things you may have forgotten at home. I will recommend this place to everyone and will absolutely be back some day, as I have completely fallen in love with Seattle. Thank you Serina for having such an amazing place and for making my stay so comfortable :)"
544433,19766236,2014-09-18,5565502,Debbie,"Our stay in Seattle was fantastic. The apartment. Was just as described. In an excellent location, right near the Seattle Centre, but on a quiet and safe street. Serina even left us some delicious pastries and plentiful tea and coffee for our breakfast. We couldn't have asked for more. Great host, great apartment. Would highly recommend. "
544433,19923272,2014-09-21,15837939,Kaycie,Wonderful place to stay! Perfect location and Serina was amazing!
544433,20327569,2014-09-28,9401599,Anne,"Das Appartement sowie Serina als Gastgeberin  ist absolut weiterzuempfehlen. Zwar haben wir uns nicht persönlich kennenlernen können, aber Serina hat für einen absolut reibungslosen Ablauf gesorgt sowie einen herzlichen Empfang mit regionalem Kuchen und Blumen gestaltet. 
Die Bilder des Appartements sind absolut realistisch, die Lage ist perfekt und wirklich sehr zentral in Seattle - für uns als Fußgänger perfekt - aber auch Busse fahren direkt vor der Haustür.
Besonders praktisch war für uns auch noch die Ausstattung: gemütlich eingerichtet zum Frühstücken, großer Kühlschrank und: wir konnten vor der Weiterreise noch eine Ladung Wäsche in den kombinierten Waschmaschinen-Trockner werfen.
Alles also absolut top!"
544433,20547211,2014-10-01,6334566,Mario,"Super empfehlenswert! Sehr sauber, sehr großzügig, geräumig und modern eingerichtet, Schlafzimmer ruhig zu Parkplatz gelegen (Teppiche sind hier leider noch nicht 'out' - ist aber nur im Schlafzimmer vorhanden). Voll ausgestattet. Bspw: Inkl. Waschmittel für Waschmaschine, Kaffeekapseln, Regenschirm, Küchenrolle, Bügeleisen, Radiowecker, Seife, Shampoo aus dem Dispenser - wie im Hotel, ...  5 Minuten Fußweg zum Monorail und zum Space Needle. Zu Fuß zum Pike Place Market sind es ca. 20min am Olympic Sculpture Park vorbei. Restaurants innerhalb 2-3min erreichbar. Da auch noch ein Parkplatz genutzt werden kann, würde ich sofort wieder bei Serina buchen.

Highly recommended! Very clean and spacious apartment. Fully equipped (from detergent for the washing machine up to shampoo and umbrella). Perfect location to explore the city. Just a 5min walk to the Monorail or a 20min walk directly to the Pike Place Market - even the Columbia Center Sky View Observatory can be reached within a 40min walking distance. Kerry Park is a 20min walk away (A must see! Skyline with Space Needle, Downtown and Mt. Rainier). Finally there is a parking option available. This is great to explore the sights outside Seattle by rental car.
I would choose this apartment definitely again."
544433,20701917,2014-10-04,10851484,Maricris,"This apartment was in a great location. It was walking distance to many attractions - Olympic Sculpture garden, Seattle Center & Pike Place. We used the kitchen to cook crab that we bought in the market. I only discovered the nice neighborhood further down the street from the apartment. The local market there was awesome. "
544433,21070972,2014-10-11,12192769,Cindy,"Serina was easy to contact and greeted us when we arrived so we knew where to put the rental car to unload.  
We were very pleased with the place and she had two cinnamon rolls waiting for us.  They were delicious!

Loved the location and we had everything we needed.  We found slippers on the bed which we thought was an amazing touch.

Thank you Serina!"
544433,21338782,2014-10-15,20123032,Jamie,"Everything in the pictures and other reviews in completely accurate. The apartment was super clean, the bed was really comfy, closet was huge, and there were even pastries when we arrived! The neighborhood was perfect - really quiet, safe, super close to the space needle and everything at the Seattle Center, and really close to bus stops to go anywhere else. It's just a few blocks from the waterfront as well. 

Just one tip - make sure the fan in the bathroom is on when you take a shower, otherwise you will set off the fire alarm haha! 

We had a great time staying in the apartment an d would absolutely recommend it to anyone."
544433,21510291,2014-10-19,11917116,Dana,"PERFECT!!!!  We were in town for 2 days to see a concert and the apartment had everything we could ask for and more!  Thoughtful touches like  yummy fresh pastry to have with our morning coffee, eco-friendly toiletries, and even a nice selection of books!  The place was clean, comfortable and modern.  Step out the door, turn to your left and there is the space needle!!!  What a fantastic location!  One block from the Key Arena where we saw the concert!  Serina is super nice and approachable.  We will happily stay here again on our next trips to Seattle!  HIGHLY recommended!!!  Thanks, Serina!"

She allowed me to leave my luggage there before my check in time and let me check in early! When arrived, I found pastries on the table. Thanks, they were delicious! The place was very clean and had everything you needed. I would definitely recommend this place or come back! 
The space needle is literally 2 blocks away! I walked there! I ubered from here to pike place and it costed me no more than $6, cheap!

While not in the heart of Seattle, the apartment is right on the edge of downtown so it's a 20 min walk to Pike Market or very easy bus ride. We'd definitely stay here again."

Apartment is well appointed and perfectly located. 5 - 10 mins walk gets you to amenities and local attractions.

Loved the Keurig and pods! Check-in process is smooth and hassle free."

544433,25385003,2015-01-14,14281338,Emerson,"My girlfriend and I had a great experience in Seattle, thanks in large part to Serina's accommodation! The apartment had all the amenities you could ask for and was kept in great condition. Even when we arrived, Serina greeted us with some delicious pastries and left us to our own adventures the rest of the trip. A combination of great location (next to the Space Needle), privacy and everything you could need within the apartment makes this a highly recommended choice for a stay in Seattle. "

Serina has thought of absolutely everything to make you feel like you're at home away from home (complete with k-cups/Keurig machine, toiletries in the bathroom, even detergent to go along with the washing machine).  This was my first time in Seattle and her directions were impeccable, communication grand and location superb!  We were able to walk easily to the Space Needle (.4 of a mile), Pike Place Market and waterfront.  In addition,  Lower Queen Anne was a great neighborhood, complete with fabulous eats, coffee shops, etc.  Lastly, if you have a car, the parking was a deal, only $5 a day.  I highly recommend Serina's place, I would definitely stay here again!  "

Easily accessible from the airport by light rail/monorail. Everything was as advertised and comfortable. The check-in/out process was simple and Serina quickly answered any questions that I had. This was an awesome first experience for me using airbnb. I will definitely check to see if this location is available on my next trip to Seattle. "

She's been great !"
544433,27827592,2015-03-13,9979323,Julian,"This apartment was perfect for me. I love the area of lower Queen Anne/Seattle Center. There are lots of restaurants and lots of things to do. And I had business in the area. The apartment was clean and had everything I needed to make my meals. And it was quiet! I was too busy to get a chance to meet Serina, but we communicated a lot by text in a few days before I arrived. She was always very helpful and responded quickly."
544433,28121362,2015-03-18,4975176,Mary Katherine,"I was so happy staying at  Serina's apartment in lower Queen Anne. Not only is she super attentive and always gets back to you via email (within minutes), I was able to call her with other questions I had about the area and transportation. The apartment I was in was so comfortable: great living space, cable, wifi, coffee machine (she provided the coffee and creamer!), Britta water jug in the fridge... Plus you have access to all the normal comforts of an apartment that you don't have in a hotel: full kitchen, closets, washer/dryer + detergent (was great to do laundry while I was there!), dishwasher... Serina also provides little luxuries like super fluffy pillows and towels, mini shampoo, conditioner and lotion, even a spare razor should you need it. My favorite part? When I walked in, exhausted after a full day of travel, what was waiting for me on the counter than two delicious almond-filled pastries from a local bakery! So thoughtful, and some of the best baked goods I think I've ever had.

Serina's apartment was impeccably clean. The area is clean, very safe, and super convenient to anywhere you want to go in the city. Easy walking distance to downtown on a nice day or a two minute ride on the monorail. Great shops, restaurants and grocery stores nearby. I loved stay my there and will stay there again the next time I'm in Seattle. Highly recommended!"
544433,28265083,2015-03-21,17169463,Christina,"Sirena was wonderful.  The apartment could not have been set up better for travelers, every amenity you need and then some was provided. Very clean. Perfect location to get around the city. 
Such a great deal over a hotel!
Recommend arranging parking with her as well, very convenient. 
Would rent again! Thanks!"
544433,28603199,2015-03-27,27127145,Gladys,"The host gave great advance information and information in the apartment to orient us.   She also has provided everything you need to make your stay comfortable.   She goes beyond the usual to provide complete kitchen, toiletry and other needs.   There were even two umbrellas waiting for our use.  We particularly noticed how thoughtful she was in setting up the apartment.  Lots of little handy things and tasteful touches.  Neighborhood is as advertised.  Location great.  Quiet."
544433,29157956,2015-04-05,14239348,Alexandra,"Serina was fast to respond, extremely flexible, thorough, and very kind with words. We booked our trip well in advance and had absolutely no trouble when contacting her a week before our arrival. We arrived a bit late in the evening and weren't able to meet her right away, but were able to meet a day later when she had to come in to reset the wi-fi. She made sure to email me asking what time worked best for us for her to come by, was on time, and prompt!

The space is exactly as pictured. Very clean for an older building with new floors, cabinetry, and appliances. We stayed for a week and it was extremely comfortable and perfect for my boyfriend and I. 

There is no cable but she has a fun set of DVDs readily available. It's very close to the water, to the Olympic Sculpture Garden (gorgeous with gorgeous views), and next to many public transportation stops. Do be prepared for walking though! Great 15-20 minute walk to the Pike Place Market... So worth the walk through Lower Queen Anne, Belltown, and Downtown Seattle.

Very much loved our stay and will be returning. Thank you so much Serina and family!"

544433,30027188,2015-04-16,28940980,Joshua,"Serina was an excellent host. We felt right at home right away. Checkin was easy, checkout was easy. The apartment was clean and comfortable. The neighborhood was pretty nice. Easy walk to the space needle and the Queen Anne neighborhood restaurants and bars. It was also easy to hop the monorail downtown to the market and waterfront. Overall I would definitely recommend the apartment and would also recommend staying with Serina."
544433,30184196,2015-04-19,10734259,Evie,"Serina's place was absolutely perfect for what I needed, and she was gracious and responsive. She even brought pastries! I had a conference at EMP, so the location was amazing, and the apartment was equipped with any basics you might need, including toiletries, coffee, a washing machine, dishes and dishwasher, etc. I go to the same conference in Seattle every year, so I will probably aim to come back. 100% recommend."
544433,30661239,2015-04-26,18599210,Alex,We had an amazing time in Seattle. Serina's place was excellent. She provided all necessary items for a stay. As close as you can get to a hotel as I've ever seen at AirBnb. Definitely worth the really affordable price and close to all the places you'll want to see. 5 minute walk to the Space Needle.  Would stay again!
544433,30943117,2015-04-29,30444196,Nora,"Great place, clean and comfortable. Walking distance from several must-see places and good restaurants. Serena was an excellent host. She responded promptly and efficiently to a small issue with the bathroom. We enjoyed our time in Seattle and would definitely recommend this place. "
544433,31419869,2015-05-05,16770810,Marian,This apartment is sparkling and in an ideal position. Serina was on hand if we needed anything and the welcoming box of Danish was a lovely surprise. A short stroll to the Space Needle and a 24 hour supermarket. Towels and bed linen had a beautiful fresh smell. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. 
544433,31689385,2015-05-09,22894237,Veronica,"The place was wonderful!!! It was extremely close to the public transportation and only a mile away to the Public Market. Everything was provided that a hotel would provide, from a hair dryer, to hotel toiletries and even a Keurig coffee machine. There was even books and DVD's that we could use while we were there, and you better believe that we saw Sleepless in Seattle. 

Everything was detailed on the house rules, public transportation and much more in a handbook that Serina provided for us. 

Serina even met us to welcome us and had pastries for us! We would definitely stay there again. "
544433,32232512,2015-05-16,27148594,Kathie,"We were looking for a simple, reasonable room in a good location and that is exactly what we found. The place was clean and comfortable. Actually the location was great - an easy and fun monorail ride to downtown where all the fun touristy things to do were within walking distance. You really can see the Space Needle from the street and it's a short walk to the Needle and Chihuly Garden & Glass (fabulous must see). A few blocks to Petit Toulouse for a great breakfast. Serina let us drop our luggage off earlier than check-in time, which was really appreciated. If we're ever back in Seattle, we'd definitely stay here again."
544433,32494779,2015-05-19,21436477,Julie,"Serina made us feel very welcome, even though we arrived earlier than check-in time with our suitcases to store away.  The apartment's location was ideally suited to us being close to all the main city attractions that we had time to see.  The apartment was very comfortable and thank you Serina for the extra side tables - they were very handy!"
544433,32817512,2015-05-22,29535781,Kathryn,"Serina's apartment is quaint, charming, and cozy! The perfect amount of space for two. The apartment is super close (walking distance) to the Space Needle and Chihuly Garden with proximity to buses to downtown, so to say it's in a great location is an understatement. Serina was a kind and generous host always happy to answer a question or two and left my boyfriend and I a lovely box of pastries. I would definitely recommend this apartment highly to anyone looking for a quiet, nice apartment in Seattle. "
544433,33060088,2015-05-25,23125622,Jessica,"We had a great stay thank you. The apartment was very clean and tidy. The bed was comfortable. Lots of space for cloths and things.
Very good location for the folk festival and downtown in general. We would stay here again."
544433,33493209,2015-05-29,8907679,Tony, Well appointed apartment close to the Space Needle and its other attractions. Close to downtown by the monorail. We enjoyed the facility of the apartment and Serina was a very gracious host who was very accommodating. We recommend this apartment. 
544433,33654188,2015-05-31,28409636,Jody,We loved staying here. The apartment was perfect and cozy. We were is perfect walking distance to downtown and to neat restaurants and a great grocery store close by. The apartment was perfectly located and we felt at home. There was so much details to make sure we had everything needed for our stay. 
544433,33978992,2015-06-03,18945188,Rachel,This place was great. The perfect location. Restaurants are very close and you are right next to Seattle Center. The condo is very clean and you have everything you could possibly need. We will definitely stay again. 
544433,34129601,2015-06-05,14362440,Ken,Host responded quickly. Easy keyless entry to apartment with code.  Simple but clean. Great location. 
544433,34624839,2015-06-10,1102047,Peter,"Serina certainly made me feel welcome.  She left lots of good information on getting around town, grocery shopping, etc.  , and made sure to check in with me around the time of my arrival.  As she pointed out, it's not suburban living but it is convenient to downtown without the full hustle and bustle of downtown. It was definitely quiet enough for me.  I liked the market up the street at 1st Avenue North and Mercer. In addition to a full range of produce it has some nice take out items for those who are not inclined to cook.  The monorail at the nearby Seattle center is a great option for traveling downtown. There are not stops, and the downtown stop is right near the Westlake station, where you can take the train to the airport."
544433,34764559,2015-06-12,7667382,Anna,"Serina was a very great host. She gave us so many information. The location of the apartment was a dream, close to the Space needle and to Seattle downtown. Everything was close. We will come back once again. Thank you Serina."
544433,34944700,2015-06-14,29888347,Lisa,"The location was ideal for our weekend stay in Seattle. I was in town to run a road race that started just three short blocks away. In addition to its extremely convenient location, the apartment was incredibly comfortable and clean and the kitchen had everything we needed including K-cups and a Kuerig machine. That's even better than our set up at home! The bed was comfortable too so I was able to get a good night's rest before the race. Serina welcomed us warmly and then kept a low profile. She was available when we had questions, a wonderful hostess. We enjoyed all the thoughtful details. Thank you so much!"
544433,35212545,2015-06-16,31149285,Andreas,"Great place to rent for a few days. It had almost everything we needed and Serina greeted us on arrival. The place was clean and tidy, and the kitchen was great. She accommodated a late-notice parking request as well, which was greatly appreciated. "
544433,35373970,2015-06-18,19487610,Asia,We had a wonderful time at the Sparkling Seattle Center. Serina was an awesome host! The place is clean and close to everything Seattle. Very happy with our stay :)
544433,35936454,2015-06-23,33316955,Eric,"We had a fantastic time at Serina's place, and she was extremely attentive and replied quickly to my questions. The place itself is awesome as well. It's conveniently located, clean, and fairly quiet. Serina was very patient despite an initial miscommunication (which was my fault), and provided everything that she said she would. Serina was very respectful of our space, and had very clear instructions for how to get into and out of the apartment. We would absolutely stay here again if we visit Seattle again!"
544433,36081294,2015-06-25,8210101,Georgia,"Nice area, really close to the space needle and surrounding attractions. Easy walk to downtown too. Apartment was clean and spacious with good instructions"
544433,36261701,2015-06-27,26306060,Mike,"Overall a great stay in Seattle. Serina was very accommodating to helping us store our luggage while we went out exploring and took the red eye home on Saturday. We happened to catch Seattle in the middle of a heat wave but to anyone staying in this apartment, use the windowless air conditioner by cracking your door and having it face in towards the bedroom. We made the mistake of not doing that and it made it worse. 

Go to the Hula Hula for a night cap, karaoke and a good spot to hang with locals. Its also right by the apartment. Ubers are basically anywhere and they cost $10 to get anywhere each way."
544433,36942860,2015-07-03,28820101,Adam,Great central location in a wonderful neighborhood. The Space Needle is literally a couple of blocks away. The apartment was well-appointed and comfortable. Serina communicated well and was very easy to work with. I'd recommend this apartment for anyone traveling to Seattle.
544433,37553890,2015-07-08,16269281,Roger Kathy,"The host made us feel very welcome and comfortable. The bed and pillows were excellent!  Her recommendations were welcomed for restaurants. We had a wonderful time. We were 5 blocks from the Space Needle, centrally located. We walked everywhere or took the bus. We discovered a delicious diner, The Lucky Diner on 1st Ave & Cedar St. with all homemade comfort food - real mashed potatoes and generous portions."
544433,37939043,2015-07-12,6280056,Kristin,"This apartment is an excellent way to be super close to the major tourists attractions, Pike Place Market, and some of the most popular restuarants while avoiding the very high hotel rates in this area. (That said, after some exploring, we found there are better neighborhoods for affordable food, coffee, music, nightlife, and breweries, ie Fremont, International District, Ballard, but Seattle center is a good central home base for exploring all these neighborhoods, too. Especially on bike. Can't say enough good things about renting bikes from Zach at Pedal Anywhere.)

The apartment is neat, clean, and mostly updated, but you can still feel some of the character of the historic building - I think in a good way and more so than it appears in the pictures. But if you are looking for a super modern, high-rise condo type of place, this is not it. 

Serina was very professional, welcoming, and accomodating. This was our first time staying with someone who managed a lot of units, so we were not sure what to expect, but Serina seems to make time to be really responsive and give each guest and unit some personal attention."
544433,38273365,2015-07-14,33075654,Sarah,Serina was great with immediate feedback. Everything was clearly explained so the apartment was easy to get to and enter. Very cute and clean apartment. Also a great location to explore some of the main tourist attractions in Seattle. 
544433,38477843,2015-07-16,27759307,David,This is a fantastic place to stay in Seattle. The location is perfect for walk around sight seeing and also close to public transportation. The apartment is beautiful and well organized. We would not hesitate to stay again.
544433,38978290,2015-07-20,21087574,Niki,"It was a perfect stay in a perfect place! Me& my husband love it! Highly recommended!!! You've everything you need...very comfortable, fully equipped& clean...near to Space Needle&Downtown Seattle! If we're in Seattle again we would come back again! Definitely!!!Thx for everything:-)and the pastries...best Niki "
544433,39365792,2015-07-23,25882009,Andrew,"It was great having the apartment to ourselves and Serina's instructions were thorough and easy to follow.
The location was also excellent as it was close to wonderful attractions.
The apartment was clean but we did find that it had a certain odour that was rather distracting.
Thank you for having us and also for the lovely pastries waiting for us."
544433,39722895,2015-07-26,22990892,Lars,Serina hat uns einen tollen Aufenthalt in Seattle ermöglicht. Bei der Ankunft lag ein Karton mit lokalen Köstlichkeiten von einem tollen Bäcker als Geschenk im Zimmer. Die Lage der Wohnung ist super zentral direkt neben der Space Needle.
544433,40194905,2015-07-29,23986561,Venessa,"Serina's apartment was fantastic.  Clean, great location, and comfortable bed. It was a breeze checking in and we really appreciated the little gift she left for us. Thanks Serina!"
544433,40570339,2015-08-01,31183461,Al,Serina was a wonderful host. The apartment listen was spot on. The neighborhood was vibrant. Lots to do. 
544433,41306486,2015-08-07,90231,Jill,"Baked goodies were awaiting us when we arrived. Everything was as promised and the location was in a great neighborhood with lots of restaurants and a huge supermarket and separate drugstore close by. The Space Needle was very close with its various other attractions and the RapidRide bus went past the front door. The waterfront was within walking distance. Downtown was also  close.
Apartment had everything we needed as well as fans and air conditioning for the heatwave we encountered. "
544433,41919408,2015-08-10,19479208,Dan,The appartment was very nice.  Entry light was out which made it harder to see to enter code.
544433,42381536,2015-08-13,31190300,Claire,"Serina made us feel very welcome leaving a box of yummy pastries for us in arrival. There was information about the area in the apartment and leaflets about local activities too. The apartment was spacious and more than comfortable for 2. There was no air con which meant we were a little warm on an evening and leaving the windows open meant it was too noisy (we're not used to any traffic, it's probably not that bad) The location is good for exploring if you don't mind a bit of walking, we easily managed it and didn't catch any busses. The area felt quite safe as its close to Space needle and on a main road and there wasn't any homeless people hanging around. Serina gave us good instructions about how to find her place and how to get to/from the trona station and airport, seamless trip, thanks "
544433,43212466,2015-08-18,28413227,Coby,"Great, great stay.  The place is stocked like a hotel, with the pivacy and homeyness of an apartment.  There is no personal clutter or anything like that.

Neighborhood is as good as it could be for the price.  Felt safe and its a short to medium walk to many places you'd like to go (Space Needle, Pike Place, Shopping, Restaurants)."
544433,44278059,2015-08-25,27231220,Rory,"Nice clean and comfortable apartment. Close to all the main tourist attractions (Space Needle, EMP) and easy enough to get about from using public transport for places further out like the Zoo or Safeco field. I would stay here again if I ever returned to Seattle. I didn't get to meet Serina but she responded quickly to any questions I had and was helpful in letting me store my bags when I arrived early. Thanks Serina."
544433,44897352,2015-08-30,33073735,Chris,"This was my first time using Airbnb, and I was a little nervous not knowing what to expect; I shouldn't have worried. 

Everything from the amazingly precise directions, to the delicious welcome pastry made my friend and I feel comfortable and welcome. 

As far as the place itself, we loved it; can't say enough good things. If we ever need a place to stay in Downtown Seattle in the future, we would definitely try here first. "
544433,45458957,2015-09-03,28973041,Chris,Great location and very clean. The bedding is very comfortable and Serina is very welcoming from coffee to welcome pastries. I would recommend this listing to anyone visiting Seattle. Thanks again Serina!
544433,46862598,2015-09-14,23664776,Tess,"Finding the apartment was relatively easy and it was lovely to find two delicious cakes waiting for us. The apartment is very comfortable and had everything we needed including a safe. The apartment is in a fantastic position, being a 5 minute walk from the Space Centre and therefore, the monorail into the downtown area of Seattle. The area felt very safe. We really enjoyed our stay in Seattle and we would like to thank Serina for making the apartment was comfortable and we really can't fault it."
544433,47453076,2015-09-19,7180191,Thomas,Good communications and good welcoming pastries.
544433,48268703,2015-09-25,34611290,Paul,We enjoyed our stay at Serina's apartment. It was comfortable and clean. We did not get to meet Serina as entry is via a keypad code.
544433,48493104,2015-09-27,28765041,Robert,"Great place, good location, wonderful host"
544433,48972854,2015-09-29,45091623,Kyndall,"The space was as described, clean, and in a phenomenal location. Everything was great, highly recommend."
544433,49314531,2015-10-03,32964922,Bobbi,"Serina was a gracious hostess, providing a small box of pastries to make us feel especially welcome, and supplying a great list of recommendations upon our request. The apartment was in a great location, clean, comfortable and exactly what we needed for our stay in Seattle."
544433,49589016,2015-10-05,33815655,Jay,"The location is pretty convenient,only 5 minutes walking to space needle. The bus and monorail are also easy to take.
Room is  clean and well-appointed . Serina provide the detail instruction for transportation ,buying and parking.
I lived in.seattle for 3 days and the apartment make me feel comfortable after every day's travelling.I will choose the apartment again when i go to seattle again."
544433,52569123,2015-10-31,11372797,George,"First of all, Serina is the BEST HOST EVER!  My stay was a bit unique in that I stayed at her place for 30 days.  Serina’s place became my home for a month!  Whether you are staying for the weekend, a week or a month Serina’s apartments are in the perfect location!  You get the feeling that you’re NOT in the big City and yet 2 minutes by Monorail you ARE in the big City.  It was the perfect blend of having your cake and eating . . . I ate the whole thing!  North of the property there are plenty of places for dinner.  Looking east from the property you see the Space Needle which is 10 walk.  2 minutes south on the Monorail, takes you to the heart of Seattle’s Downtown Financial District. To the west about 15 minutes’ walk are the islands of Puget Sound.  What more could you ask for?  A great host, a great place to stay, make for a great vacation!  When I come back to Seattle hopefully I will be lucky enough to get to stay with Serina again! George"
544433,53053625,2015-11-04,22580897,Michelle,"My boyfriend and I had a great stay in Serina's cozy Queen Anne apartment! The location was perfect and central to everything we needed. Serina left tons of information for us and detail directions to get around. The apartment had everything we needed and more. Highly recommended!
"
544433,53873427,2015-11-14,8428796,Sam,Clean and spacious. Location was great.
544433,54306874,2015-11-18,4266945,John,"Great location and convenient set up, the combo washer-dryer was a 1st for us, but worked perfect.  Serena had some great artisanal bread waiting which was fantastic.  Restaurant recommends Rachael Thai and Toulouse Petit are near perfect. Can't recommend any more highly.  Only potential for some with health issues would be steps to entry door."
544433,54974016,2015-11-27,16595216,Lynn,"Serina is a wonderful host. Prior to our arrival she contacted us to make sure when we would be arriving and upon our arrival she greeted us and presented us with a small tray of baked goodies. Communication between Serina was really convenient, if the place is missing something like plastic wrap, or extra bags, contacting Serina is really simple and she responds very quickly. The location itself is great, as soon as you step outside the building you can see the space needle. Walking downtown takes no less than 30 mins. Overall, a wonderful place to stay at."
544433,55347217,2015-12-01,32557189,Sarah,"Serina was a brilliant host. The flat was clean and comfy and well located to downtown--just what we needed! Checkin procedure was easy and convenient and the guest information Serina provided was complete and helpful. It was the little touches like extra toiletries, kitchen supplies and tea/coffee which really made this a friendly and welcoming stay."
544433,56477193,2015-12-14,44223305,Nico,"Serina was an excellent host for my girlfriend and I on our trip to Seattle!  We met up with her shortly after our arrival, and were welcomed with some pastries and an incredibly helpful welcome guide to her inn.  Not only did it clarify any questions we had about our stay, but it gave us some ideas and options on what to do and where to eat during our stay.  If there we had any questions, she was available.

This was our first time in Seattle, and Serina's hospitality at her inn helped the entire trip be enjoyable :)

When we plan our next trip to Seattle, we'll definitely be looking to stay at her inn again!"
544433,57746270,2015-12-29,2688045,Jessica,"Great Experience! Serina was extremely helpful and friendly, we met her upon arrival. The apartment was great! So close to everything, would definitely stay here again"
544433,58116451,2016-01-01,15219937,Chrystal,Serina is a very nice host. The place is in a great location and was clean. With all amenities.
1789341,11954857,2014-04-20,12487517,Kathryn,"Our extended stay worked out perfectly.  The home is in a very quiet, safe neighborhood.  There was adequate parking on the street, so your car can be just steps away.  The home was very functional, clean and stylish.  Our requests for additional kitchen tools was immediately and cheerfully addressed.  Amelia always responded right away, and was a pleasure to work with.  Highly recommended."
1789341,18296137,2014-08-25,12548629,Kimberly,"Amelia and Marisa were extremely hospitable and accommodating hostesses. I stayed at this location for three months (quite a long time) and whenever I had a concern or question for them they addressed it as soon as they were able. They even addressed a few things that I informed them of but didn't expect them to fix. The unit was in good condition and clean when I arrived, and was stocked with toilet paper, paper towels, and cleaning supplies. Amelia and Marisa even provided a second queen bed so my roommate and myself could convert the living room into a second bedroom for the summer. They also gave out advice and recommendations on where to go in Ballard and Seattle as a whole. Since I was staying in the area for three months I was hoping to find a living situation that did not require needing to purchase furniture or any big items, but allowed me to feel like a local. Amelia and Marisa provided the perfect solution."
1789341,19069623,2014-09-06,10715744,Tammi,"We absolutely loved staying here!!  It was super comfortable and we had everything we needed.  We loved the neighborhood and were able to walk to most places from here - Ballard historical district, Ballard Locks, and even the zoo (which was a workout but so worth it for the gorgeous views!). The bed was definitely more comfortable than a hotel and we slept great!  This was our first Airbnb experience and we hope to never stay in a hotel again!  We chose this place to get a real-life feel of Seattle and we certainly got it!  We are planning to move here next spring!!!  We will definitely recommend this place to any friends who want to come visit your beautiful city!  Thanks again!!  "
1789341,19608233,2014-09-15,19473453,Athanasios,"I had a great time staying in this Ballard home. Amelia was a good, attentive host. I mostly kept to myself, but when I had any questions, she was quick to respond. The space itself was very well maintained, clean and comfortable. The kitchen, bathroom and linen closet were well-stocked with the basics, so that when I arrived, I felt right at home."
1789341,21378583,2014-10-16,19818631,Tim,The house was perfect. Everything was superclean and super well done. There was even some nice food and drinks in the fridge. I was there for almost a month and I felt like it was home. When I did have a couple of small requests they were handled immediately. Five Stars!
1789341,21684017,2014-10-21,22379059,Aliscia,"Amelia was an awesome host!! While planning our stay, she responded quickly to my emails and answered all my questions. The house was adorable and perfect my husband and I on our anniversary trip to Seattle . Amelia even checked with me after we settled in to make sure we didn't need anything or have any questions about the area. We would definitely recommend the house !!! Thanks again Amelia !!!"
1789341,21850368,2014-10-25,2479220,Kevin,"I was very happy with my stay in the ""Modern Classic~Convenient~Priv Home"".

Thanks to Amelia for the ease of check-in and responsiveness."

1789341,24584544,2014-12-31,20731759,Jack,Excellent location and a comfortable home. It made our extended stay in Seattle a super visit. Hosts were gracious and helpful with questions and responses always prompt. Our first experience with AirNB and even better than we expected. 
1789341,32459406,2015-05-18,3063988,Florence,We had a wonderful time at this place. The place was clean and quiet. The house had everything we needed. We actually extended our stay from 30 days to 34 days. The neighborhood was wonderful. It was very easy to walk to everywhere. Ballard is a great neighborhood. We will certainly visit again.
1789341,33127015,2015-05-25,31601138,Mike,"This place was delightful.  Amelia left a welcoming note with chocolates, and everything after that was just a little better than expected.  Condiments, spices, coffee filters, band aids, energy bars, 
excellent bed and bath (although the tub is plumbed backwards, you're not out of hot water, twist the valve clockwise!). Surprisingly private even with the adjacent living spaces, great safe neighborhood with ample street parking, walkable to downtown Ballard and other shopping.  Problem with coffeemaker was resolved immediately.  So glad we found it, can't wait to return."
1789341,40706462,2015-08-02,766515,Kelly,"Amelia was the greatest! The house is beautiful and in a fantastic location. Super close to a bus that takes you directly downtown, easy walk to several great grocery stores and nearby Downtown Ballard. We had everything we could need for a several month stay and felt right at home. The place was very clean and the bed is comfy! Amelia even upgraded us to faster internet. We want to come back!"
1789341,49098035,2015-10-01,5191108,Laura,"We had a very comfortable and pleasant stay for the month of September at Amelia and Foxy's ""Modern Classic-Convenient Private Home"" in Ballard, Seattle. The apartment with two private outside entrances was clean and nicely furnished. The people in the adjacent main floor unit and in the basement apartment were very quiet. The residential Ballard neighborhood is very walkable and the bus was close. We rarely used our car. We would gladly stay here again if we have the opportunity. "
1789341,51905074,2015-10-25,31845638,Allan,"Everything worked perfectly at Amelia's. She wasn't able to meet us but she has a complete guide waiting for her guests as they arrive. Everything you need to know is there. Place is exactly like the pictures, wi-fi works great, has a complete kitchen and washer and dryer. The neighborhood is also excellent: quiet and we felt very safe. A few blocks away you find a fantastic supermarket (Ballard Market) and major bus lines are very close to the house. Bottom line: would definitely recommend it!"
1789341,54512417,2015-11-21,35569592,Joanne,"Very cute! Has everything you will need. The washer and dryer are a big plus. Bed was very comfortable. Amelia was wonderful, she was able to get me a bicycle to use during my stay as well. I will see if this place is available for future stays. Thanks for everything Amelia!! "
1789341,55104133,2015-11-28,8694861,Dennis,This listing is a charming and spacious duplex apartment located close to the shops and restaurants of Ballard. Amelia & Foxy welcomed us to their apartment on our second day and helped us understand how to use the smart TV. The apartment is well appointed with all the necessary kitchen and bath accessories and the bed was soft and comfortable; the apartment was warm and cozy during a chilly week. We will re-book on future visits to Seattle. 
7745016,42968315,2015-08-16,7690746,Jane,I had another great stay at Jessica's lovely house! Jessica was a great host and the house was very neat and clean. Would definitely stay here again! 
7745016,49062563,2015-09-30,21450911,Jon,"Nice place to stay.  Quiet neighborhood, clean room, comfortable bed, walking distance to the Light Link Rail.  Just what I was looking for.

Due to circumstances, I didn't get to spend much time getting to know Jessica, but what little time I had was delightful."
1602421,9274047,2013-12-17,10336152,Colby,I enjoyed my stay at Bob's home. He was very welcoming and helpful with setting up my arrival to the Seattle area for an internship. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend his place to a friend. Overall a good first experience with airbnb!

1602421,19702724,2014-09-16,67167,Andreas,"Bob's house is a funky one.  And although I was away on a workshop for most of the day during my stay, I felt that he was always happy to have a chat, answer some questions or even play a board game or two if that's your thing. I loved to hear Bob playing the piano and singing some tunes!

Greenlake is a very nice neighbourhood; easy to get around with the lake just a stone's throw away and the bus stop around the corner."
1602421,19914677,2014-09-20,14432638,Craig,Bob is a great host! Very energetic and friendly! His house is quite cool and located in a great (email hidden)ry central. Definitely recommend!
1602421,20113416,2014-09-23,720303,Amy & Jeff,"Bob is a lovely host - very friendly and helpful. He was available for chatting and we found him to be personable and positive. The cats are affectionate and we enjoyed them. The neighborhood is beautiful - make sure to walk around the lake. There were also some cute restaurants to discover. There were two other guests staying at the house and there was a young lady staying in a room on our floor. The decoration of the downstairs could be described as cluttered/funky-there are a lot of personal items, artifacts from different eras along with Bob's piano and instruments. We were lucky enough to hear Bob play a bit of piano. The restroom is located downstairs and guests from the upstairs come down and cross through the living room and kitchen. We shared the bathroom with several people but it was vacant when we needed to use it. Everything was quiet in the mornings with exception of us making noise using the antique doors and creaky stairs. I was amazed we couldn't hear the people downstairs when we were upstairs which is a plus. If you come from a place where recycling is optional you can learn from Bob how everything can be recycled or reused. Everything seemed in line with the price point and we appreciated Bob's helpfulness."
1602421,24171606,2014-12-21,25074796,Saleh,The reservation was canceled 8 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1602421,24261021,2014-12-24,15324330,Max,"Bob was a warm and welcoming host whose house really feels like a home. I highly recommend this place, especially for a university student, since it is so close to a bus stop. 

"
1602421,28774628,2015-03-30,23501313,Catherine,"Bob was a fantastic host!  Though he was not home the day I arrived, he was available via text to assure me I could get into his home with ease.  The helpful signs around the home allowed me to successfully navigate inside the house the first few days.  
Bob is very welcoming and always willing to chat to you about your day!  Game nights (optional, of course, but highly recommended) are great to help you feel at home and welcome.  
The neighborhood was cozy, safe, beautiful, and Greenlake is no more than a 3 minute walk away!  Such a perfect location!
The only drawback I have to say is that the shared bathroom is downstairs, but I enjoyed having my own room and large closet.  The ceiling in the room narrows significantly- so watch your head if you are on the taller side!
Though there was a full house of 2 other guests for the remainder of my stay, the room is situated above the front of the house and was quite during the evening even when people were over.  
"
1602421,32084988,2015-05-13,31546044,Elizabeth,"Bob was a truly warm and wonderful host, and made me feel completely welcome during my stay.  I especially enjoyed being able to chat with him and to nab some time with his friendly cat."
1602421,42423715,2015-08-13,5610190,Nicole,"This was a great place to stay and Bob was incredibly friendly and hospitable and most importantly, the place was clean. I enjoyed staying in this neighborhood north of the downtown area as downtown can be highly congested and very touristy.  Bob's place is located near a beautiful lake and a 5 minute cab ride away from the super cool neighborhood of Fremont. I found myself spending more time in Fremont than in the downtown area as it was full of great night life, food, bars and it's where the locals hang out at. I would definitely stay here again."
1602421,42927167,2015-08-16,39734061,Jonathan,Great neighborhood and host
1602421,43251635,2015-08-18,4365905,Heather,"Bob was very friendly and flexible about checking in. Everything was well labeled and easy to find. The low, sloped ceiling was a little inconvenient, but as advertised. Overall, we had a positive experience. Thanks!"
1602421,43464689,2015-08-19,39088749,Markus,"Staying with Bob was great! He was very accommodating, even though I only gave him one days notice. The bed was very comfortable, the occupants of the house were nice and courteous, and it feels very homey."
1602421,43595790,2015-08-20,5743994,Lionel,"I arrived in the evening and left early in the morning, so I didn't get to take full advantage of the place.
The location is great.  A quiet street just north of Greenlake, which is a fun neighborhood with a great park, a public pool, and all the usual amenities.
Bob seems like a really nice guy. I was only there a very short time, but Bob communicated well and was genuine and helpful.
Everything was clean. Good water pressure and hot water in the shower.  I didn't have time to make use of the shared kitchen, but it was in good shape.
I enjoyed my stay, and would stay there again/recommend it to friends."
1602421,44035379,2015-08-23,34744126,Robert,"This home is very cute and situated in a great location. Nearby are plenty of great places to eat and hang out, including the awesome 24 hour diner Beth's, about a ten minute walk away, and getting to the city center was quick and easy. The home has several great common areas, but the backyard really takes the cake, with tons of seating in a great setting. Bob is a friendly and very helpful host, and his cat is friendly too! A highly recommended place to stay in Seattle."
1602421,44648371,2015-08-28,20817172,Peter Pi-Te,"Great location and peaceful home vibe, such a pleasant stay, Thanks to you Bob."
1602421,45284258,2015-09-01,32873206,Vivian,"This was our first Airbnb experience and Bob made it fantastic. The house was easy to find, and was a convenient 10 minute drive from downtown.  The room we received was exactly like in the pictures. The house had a very comfy, homey vibe to it. At the time we stayed, there were a few other guests present as well but it did not cause any problems. Everything in the house is clearly labelled for easy access and we really appreciated that. Bob himself is an artistic soul, very easygoing and very talented. One night he played a song he invented on the piano for us. He also has a well behaved and friendly cat. I would highly recommend staying with Bob if you want to visit Seattle!"
1602421,55343073,2015-12-01,35310940,Mark,"Great time in Seattle, in the best neighborhood!

Bob is a great host, always makes you feel welcome!

I'd recommend Bob's AirBNB to anyone!

Thanks!"

3821663,18632337,2014-08-29,19934852,Ben,"Darcy was great, unfortunately there was a last minute complication with our room. She went above and beyond to provide an alternate room even though it meant money out of her pocket. We look forward to staying with her next time we're in Seattle!"
3821663,19421685,2014-09-12,18270632,Kari,Beautiful location and perfect getaway! 
3821663,20025981,2014-09-22,7660173,Patricia,Great experience. Never met Darcy but the bar staff were friendly and helpful making getting the key and access easy and smooth. The location puts you in the heart of Seattle. Stay here to truly experience Seattle. Apartment was beautiful and immaculate.  I highly recommend staying here.
3821663,20593844,2014-10-01,557574,Jonny,"I was able to get a room for two night on just a few hour notice. The building was very shabby sheik with a good view of Pioneer square. This spot is very central for all of your traveling needs. Lots of great restaurants, bars, shopping, and the water front in walking distance. Everyone was friendly and very accommodating."
3821663,20874982,2014-10-06,21855161,Alexandra,Didn't meet Darcy but the key pick up was easy. The location was perfect!! Better than we even realized it would be! The apartment was cute and clean. It had everything we needed. Would definitley stay there again! Highly recommend it!
3821663,21535484,2014-10-19,21289023,Lissie,"Loved this place. We stayed for 2 nights. The apartment was SO clean. It is above two bars, so if you need total silence to sleep, don't come here on a weekend. Centrally located in a fun part of the city, lots of restaurants and bars around. The bed was nice and soft too. We really enjoyed our stay. Oh, and if you're easily freaked out, this place is in fact haunted. "
3821663,21732763,2014-10-22,18362667,Melanie,"Nice location up above the bar. Great apartment, much bigger than we had expected. Didn't meet Darcy, however the bar staff made us feel really comfortable when we arrived."
3821663,22006582,2014-10-27,4508853,Elizabeth,"We enjoyed our stay at the apartment.  The bed was very comfortable, the apartment was light and airy, it was easy to find and centrally located.  Darcy was able to arrange for parking, which was very helpful.  We were worried the bar below might be loud, but we couldn't hear anything and it was quiet."
3821663,22466477,2014-11-07,14250409,Jenny,"I would recommend staying here.  The check in process went smooth and the staff is very friendly.  It truly felt like I was apartment sitting for a good friend, everything you needed was provided. great location, walking distance everywhere. I came for a conference and I could walk to there, it was great."
3821663,22651967,2014-11-11,8763031,Becky,"My husband and I had a wonderful time in Seattle at Darcy's. The location was convenient walking distance to Century Link, Pike Place and downtown shopping! There were lots of greats bars and places to eat near by as well! The only down side to this place was it is next to a nightclub and a very old building so my husband were unable to get any sleep on the Friday and Saturday night with theistic going until 2am and then the fights and drunks on the street until 4am"
3821663,22721878,2014-11-12,992113,Vicki,Awesome apartment.  Everything was perfect.  Would love to stay here again.  Didn't see any ghosts :( 
3821663,22907094,2014-11-17,18065244,Mary,"Darcy and the staff of the Merchant's Cafe were extremely welcoming and friendly! My boyfriend and I were able to walk to all the Seattle sights, and the location was extremely convenient to the Link Light Rail Station (for transportation to SeaTac Airport).  The place is near a club which plays loud music on weekend nights and has a loud crowd outside, I slept fine, but if you're a light sleeper it might be a problem.  The area is a little seedy at night, but I felt safe walking with my boyfriend.  Overall, the apartment is spacious and well furnished and pros definitely outweigh cons of this place!  We'd stay there again in a heartbeat."
3821663,23106077,2014-11-23,7571678,Kevin,"Darcy is a great, friendly host. The cafe/bar downstairs is very convenient for leaving bags or picking up keys whenever you arrive. The building is very old but the rooms have been nicely redone, keeping a lot of the original features. The location is super convenient if you plan to catch rail to SeaTac."
3821663,23197063,2014-11-24,21127377,Orhun,"My brother and I came to Seattle for a night to go to a Seahawks game and this location was perfect. The apartment was exactly as advertised and the whole visit was great. Parking is always an issue on gamedays, but Darcy was able to arrange a discounted parking pass across the street. "
3821663,23608321,2014-12-06,21645075,Erik,"This is a beautifully appointed place above colorful Pioneer Square with high ceilings and a lot of natural light. I did not get to meet Darcy in person, but she was very responsive and helpful. No problems checking in or out. There is a bit of noise at night from nearby nightclub, but it did not bother us. Lots of restaurants nearby."
3821663,23952604,2014-12-15,23573933,Natalie,"What a fun place to stay in Seattle. The apartment was adorable and kept very true to the historic charm of the building. As other reviewers have mentioned it does get noisy on the weekends as there are bars right below but we brought ear plugs and were just fine.

Thank you for a fantastic stay.

3821663,24126233,2014-12-20,8588927,Isabel,"The location and apartment were perfect for what I was looking on my last minute trip. Great size, clean, and cozy. The bartender at Merchants Cafe & Saloon showed me to the apartment and explained any pertinent information. Being able to leave my (email hidden) was convenient. "
3821663,24202477,2014-12-22,11065347,Ellis Rae,"Darcy was extremely helpful and the rooms were beautiful. We ended up staying in two of the rooms above the Merchant Cafe, and they were both great. Everything was working properly, the rooms were as depicted, and the location in Pioneer Square was close to everything we wanted to do."
3821663,24413835,2014-12-28,23124571,Jennifer,"Darcy was great, and the fact that the apartments are run through the cafe downstairs makes it very easy to coordinate checking in and out. I loved the apartment- it was quieter than I expected for being in such a major location in Pioneer square. It was spacious and clean."
3821663,24493394,2014-12-29,12983293,Michael,"Great, comfortable room right in the heart of everything. We were only there one night, but came back a couple days later to stay at another room in the building. Parking wasn't even a problem, even though we were downtown on a game day. Perfect for sightseeing. "
3821663,25455531,2015-01-16,25966937,Thomas,"Really really great place to stay. Clean, Central and stress free check in and out. My first air bnb experience and I'm entirely convinced. Had a great day/night in Seattle and sill definitely use again. "
3821663,25547847,2015-01-19,24639363,Claudine,"I booked Darcy's apartment for my parents' visit. They stayed for 3 nights. We arrived at Merchant's Cafe, which was downstairs from the apartment, at around 8:45pm to pick up the keys per Darcy's instructions. The bartender who handed us the keys was warm and friendly. Darcy also took the time to meet us and give us a tour, which was a pleasant surprise, as it was kind of late.

We all loved the place. It looked exactly like the photos. I even told them I wanted to stay here for the next 3 days, and they could stay at my place instead. :)

The apartment building is in the heart of Pioneer Square, so it has its pluses and minuses. It's close to a lot of good restaurants. It's also within walking distance of the International District, which is awesome, as my parents love dim sum. And if you're a Seahawks fan who wants to go to a game or just be super-close to the action, look no further!

The building interior has so much character with its very old-fashioned decor. The apartment unit itself is 3 floors up, and there are no elevators. It is very spacious and really well put together. Everything my parents needed and more were provided. A fridge, a TV, a nice bed, a comfy couch, towels, extra blankets, coffee...

All in all, they really enjoyed their stay here. Thank you so much, Darcy!"
3821663,25985932,2015-01-31,22280684,Lucas,The apartment was awesome! Tons of space and very high ceilings. The bartender who helped me with getting into the apartment was very friendly and helpful. 
3821663,26494346,2015-02-14,10898534,Nick,"It really was a lovely place, but it was definitely a difficult sleep. Very loud area. Maybe it is just because we live in a quiet area and aren't used to booming music from a nightclub below. Bring earplugs if you want to sleep. Great location in a historic building. Clean and kept up well."
3821663,26936239,2015-02-22,25904709,Kelly,"We had a great first experience with airbnb and Darcy. The apt was clean, charming and very close to great things to do in Seattle. We had a great time at the Merchants Cafe next door too! The neighborhood is very noisy at night but the location made it worth it. "
3821663,27387686,2015-03-03,4191336,Kelley,"We really enjoyed staying here. The pictures are an accurate depiction of the apartment. I was worried about the noise, after reading other reviews, but we bought ear plugs and it was fine. We really only heard the street noise on Friday night. The rest of the nights were pretty quiet. Monday morning is trash pick-up day, so the garbage trucks were SUPER loud in the AM. The neighborhood is up-and-coming. There are a few AWESOME restaurants and cocktails bars really close, but there is a questionable street crowd hanging around as well. It really didn't bother us (being from San Jose, we're used to the homeless crowd). 
Check out these super close places:
Damn the Weather - Cocktails & Late night food
The Pharmacy - Awesome Underground Bar 
Casco Antiguo - Mexican Food
Alstadt - Great Bar / Bar food 
You're walking distance to the water front, Pike Place Market, and Belltown area. We walked all the way to the Space Needle (40 min. walk). The apartment was clean when we arrived, the bar staff was very welcoming. Overall, we had a great stay and would definitely stay here again. "
3821663,28700219,2015-03-29,26024788,Daniel,"The apartment was as described, clean and comfortable! As others have mentioned, it is sometimes noisy at night. We had a great time!"
3821663,29443833,2015-04-07,29758761,Lynne,"Listing description accurate.  Apartment matches host's presentation.  Very convenient to public transportation, air, rail and bus.  Convenient to dining, shopping, sight-seeing and stadiums.  Neighborhood residential housing consists of missions and thus many homeless people; some panhandling but not pushy.  Immediate area is very loud both day and night, expect to be sleepless in Seattle.  Overall good experience with accommodations."
