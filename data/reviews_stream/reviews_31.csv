3811872,33337367,2015-05-26,33941417,Julia,I found this experience to be good. The house was quiet and kept clean and everyone I encountered was friendly.
3811872,35857688,2015-06-22,20785442,Luis,Excellent experience!!! It's a big house with a beautiful view!!! The neighborhood is quite and peaceful!!! All the house is clean and good environment!!! 
3811872,37101378,2015-07-04,11025810,Tf,"A strange but generally positive experience. This large old home – clean but worn – functions as a hostel in an older residential part of Seattle. The house was often very silent throughout whether it be day or night. Several long-term guests seemed to spend significant amounts of time in their own bunks while others were scattered through the common spaces talking quietly or working on their devices solo. I often felt like I was in an offbeat monastery. 

There are many rules and guidelines, which were clearly communicated (as well as important with so many people sharing a common space), but I never felt fully comfortable during my short stay. Perhaps I didn't spend enough time there to fully understand the vibe of the house. It was a quiet space in which to sleep however. 

I never met the hosts, but they were always in communication to make sure everything was fine. "
3811872,37412457,2015-07-06,37019159,Esben,"The neighbourhood was nice with great areas for running close by, however, grocery shopping, UW and Seattle city center is quite far away."
3811872,40963383,2015-08-03,34546436,Mary,"I had a wonderful experience at the Crayola House. Everyone was so kind and welcoming, and there were always new people around to meet. Even though there were several people in the same room, I felt like I had plenty of privacy and could fall asleep easily. The location was extremely safe and convenient, with multiple bus stops, parks, and grocery stores within walking distance."
3811872,42144987,2015-08-11,34913039,Nathan,"CrayolaHome is a warm and welcoming listing, which allows you to see a side of Seattle probably not seen by those staying downtown. Fresh linens, towels and blankets were provided and the people you'll meet will no doubt be the highlight. Recommended for those that want to see some of the northern parks of Seattle with the option of still heating into downtown."
3811872,42752730,2015-08-15,25041200,Jessica,An interesting stay for a nontraditional traveler.
3811872,44481774,2015-08-26,20365218,Johann,Das Hostel war sauber und gepflegt. Die Mitbewohner waren sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. 
3811872,48827919,2015-09-28,44833877,Jason,"Easy stay. They were very thorough with instructions and there are signs to explain everything, everywhere. I liked the vibe of the house, met a couple other guest but none of the residents or Leah but had a great experience. "
3811872,56344689,2015-12-12,27910555,Timothy,My experience was overall good. Beautiful neighborhood. Confortable house. But wifi did not work and some rather unfriendly guests. Still a nice experience and a good value. 
59838,154475,2010-12-15,275493,Jon,"Sally's Urban Oasis was great. It was comfortable, clean and in a very convenient.  It is so nice to have a place to settle into and get comfortable rather than feel you are camping in a hotel room.  Sally and Darik were easy to deal with and quick to get back to us when we asked for a next day rental. I would stay there again.

"
59838,156860,2010-12-21,309130,Kathryn,"The stay was wonderful!  Very comfortable accommodations.  Great location.  Darik and Sally were accommodating on our extra needs.  We look forward to staying at one of the properties again.

59838,228429,2011-04-17,83038,Emilie,"Great place- clean, quiet, great location."
59838,534941,2011-09-15,1118024,Kase,"Darik and his group were great to work with, start to finish. They were very professional, laid-back, communicated really well (which was a worry with me being on the east coast and booking the place just hours before my trip), check-in, etc. was a breeze, and the place in itself was gorgeous -- great location, great decor, and a great place to come back to after a docket of meetings and appointments in the downtown area. 

I hope to be back that way sometime in the near future. And when that time comes, I'll definitely be trying to book this place again. "
59838,730230,2011-11-19,832446,Elizabeth,"I couldn't find any decent hotels under $700 during my recent trip to Seattle, but luckily, found this great place on AirBnB! The hosts responded to my request immediately and sent me a detailed description of the place, including directions and how to access the apartment. For the cost (2 bedrooms/baths), amenities, and ease of access to downtown and other parts of Seattle, I think this place is a steal. Note that this place seems to be an actual residential complex with this particular apartment set-up as a vacation rental.

That being said, there were some things I didn't like:
- One bedroom faces the street and another shares a wall with the neighboring apartments. I found myself bouncing between the two bedrooms as I was frequently woken up in the middle of the night to either drunken screams from the street or music blasting from the neighbors. 
- The alley behind the building where the garage entrance is attracts a lot of shady folks. 
- When I left Seattle and dropped my rental car off at the airport, I was greeted by two Seattle detectives. Apparently, they mixed me up with someone else at the apartment complex who had done something bad the night before. I don't know how or why they thought I was involved, but it was pretty unsettling to be met by cops on my way out of town. "
59838,851347,2012-01-09,813896,Coilin,"This place was absolutely perfect--just 5 minutes walk from downtown, yet quiet, safe and relaxing. Our stay here was completely hassle free, and the apartment was comfortable, well-equipped and in perfect condition. I recommend this place to anyone who wants the luxury of a hotel, only with better amenities and for less money."
59838,1102339,2012-04-09,623235,Michelle,"Great apartment, very central to the downtown area.  Bright and clean.  Kitchen was surprisingly well-stocked.  The host helped us out with some initial internet issues extremely promptly.  Would definitely stay here again."
59838,1372767,2012-05-29,2156340,Dianne,I stayed with three other women for a mom's retreat. It was perfect! The layout was wonderful and the full kitchen helped keep our eating out costs down. I  highly recommend this place!
59838,1553928,2012-06-25,1928005,Brooke,Great location and awesome place. It was like staying in a hotel but more homey with a nice kitchen and any amenities you could hope for.
59838,1990417,2012-08-15,1433666,Pam,"The room is beautifully detailed with Ikea furnishings but smaller then images reveal online. Kind of misleading. Kitchen, dining and living area are open consept and space is efficiently used. Kitchen has modern stainless appliances and stocked well.  When the sleeper sofa is open it takes up the entire living room area.  Otherwise the unit Sleeps 6 comfortably but only has one bathroom so trying to get 6 adults showered in a timely fashion is difficult. Also is not airconditioned but Seattle is usually a temperate climate. We just happened to visit during an unusually hot heat spell. They did provide fans for each bedroom and for the small living room.dining area.  Open windows provided loud street noise :-(  The recreation room is on the main level and does not provide a pool table as it is advertised. Not very clean area and open to anyone entering the building so not very private. Rooftop grilling area is nice but be cautious and careful because renters bring their dogs up to roof to do their duties. An area with artificial turf is provided for the dogs on the rooftop for the apartment complex. As for location : Excellent, we were able to walk to all venues.  Pikes Market place, Chihully art exhibit a must see. Underground Seattle was a must do, Pioneer square has great shops, and many very good restaurants within walking distance. Be sure to bring walking shoes, Seattle is very hilly, similar to San Francisco. Very easy to contact Darik with any concerns.  Also contact between Darik before trip was appreciated and never felt we were forgotten. Loved Seattle area. Will return again. Would definitely reserve this unit again but not for 6 people, 4 people max would be more comfortable. "
59838,2015543,2012-08-17,3179610,Dwayne,"The location in Belltown is perfect, and the weather in Seattle was beautiful but hot, which challenged those staying in the front bedroom by the street. Two choices at night: windows closed to get rid of street noise but bake, or windows open and hear all the traffic.  Most of the time, I'm sure it isn't a problem, particularly in Seattle..

So many dining and bar choices nearby, the beds were comfy, the place was finely stocked, and check-in straightforward. And much less cost than a hotel.

We walked to the Space Needle, Pike Place Market, and the waterfront.  Did I mention it's a great location?  It is Belltown, so there are panhandlers and homeless folks wandering around at night, but like everywhere they're more a nuisance with begging than anything else.  


"
59838,2785702,2012-11-02,2818830,Cronan,Great location and facilities. 
59838,2874360,2012-11-13,1902391,Dan,"Great condo as advertised. Perfect location and EASY check-in/check-out process. Thanks.

Darik was easy to get in touch with by phone or e-mail.

There was minimal street noise and the building was *very* quiet.

Beds seemed to be memory foam and might be firmer than you're used to. We slept fine the second night after we realized the heat was turned up high in our room.

It was a bit strange having sliding doors with no locks on the washroom and one of the bedrooms, so don't expect it to be sound proof.

There were absolutely no hiccups in our stay there and we would stay again."
59838,3153208,2012-12-25,3261918,Brandon,"Fantastic location and a beautiful condo for our stay in Seattle.  Located on bus routes, with grocery store across the street and restaurants nearby.  This condo is so close to town that walking everywhere is a real option if you dont want to ride the bus, we were amazed at how awesome the  whole set up was.  Within the condo there is everything you need, I even used the gym which was empty when I went for walk on treadmill which is always nice.  Also check out rooftop if you want to see the skyline, bbq, or just buy drinks from soda machine.  Keyed entry made the place very easy to enter and safe at same time. I have nothing negative to say it truly was a family Oasis for us.  Thank you to Darik and everyone at Airbnb, I cant wait to use this service again on our next trip.

Mahalo, Aloha, and Happy New Year!
Brandon"
59838,3347069,2013-01-14,863252,Dustin,Great location with free parking. Check in was very easy. Only thing we did not like about the apartment was the bathroom door. It did not offer a lot of privacy. Other than that it was great. 
59838,3565451,2013-02-18,413713,Emily,"If you are visiting Seattle, this is a wonderful place to stay. It was very central to the sights of Seattle, as well as very close to public transportation. The apartment itself was stocked with anything you would need during your stay, as well as very clean. The building was safe and the area surrounding it seemed to be as well. This is a great find in a wonderful city!"
59838,3683337,2013-03-04,4630543,Brian,"Great location, great accomodation.  Parking structure is a bit tight, but serviceable.  Loved how close in walking proximity the Seattle Pike Place market is.  Great for those visiting in town for a weekend.  

Thanks again!"
59838,3762019,2013-03-12,1382258,Marsha,"Great place downtown Seattle. There was a bit of a hiccup that prevented us from checking in at our scheduled time, but the owners were great about getting in touch with us as soon as they could. We were driving in, so as soon as our phones were back on we had multiple messages and emails!

Two comfortable rooms, nice kitchen and the apartment was quiet. Great stay!"
59838,3846350,2013-03-20,5039257,Jon,"I stayed here with my girlfriend and another couple and all four of us absolutely loved it! The apartment was beautiful and the location was perfect! Just a few blocks to Pike Place, Shorty's (go here if you like interesting, fun bars), Mama's (great Mexican food - and I'm from L.A.), and a ton of other really unique, exciting restaurants, tours, bars, and sights. The rooftop is awesome - 2 bbqs, tons of space, grass, great view of the city to help you get a grasp on where you are in relation to everything, and the potential to meet some really wonderful neighbors. 

The space was very modern and well furnished. The kitchen was fully stocked with cooking utensils and had everything we needed from pots and pans to a blender and a martini shaker (seriously, think of something and the they've probably got it).  

The pros far outweigh the cons, but if I had to list any downsides, they would be that, as a few have said before, the bathroom is a little inconvenient (it has a sliding door that's extremely light - so much so, that it can feel like you're in the middle of the living room) and that the hallway exiting the elevator can smell a little funky (it's right next to the trash shoot and recycling). That said, I would absolutely stay here again and these were just minor things (said in the interest of ""keeping it real"" - as the kids say). We didn't have any problems with noise from the street, as some previous reviews have said and actually only heard anything when we had the windows wide open (even then, the city sounds were soothing).

Lastly, Darik and Sarah were extremely helpful and thorough throughout the whole booking process and they were both extremely gracious hosts in accommodating us with our travel plans. We all had a truly wonderful time in Seattle, largely due to the location and conveniences provided by the ""Wonderful 2 Bedroom Modern Oasis."" Do it!"
59838,4031684,2013-04-04,647857,Graham,"Seattle Oasis was a great base for four co-workers attending a conference in Seattle. The location was awesome with tons of great restaurants nearby, and the rooftop patio was a great place to unwind after the drive down from Vancouver.

I'll echo what others have said about the bathroom door - it might be OK for a couple or a family, but it was a bit weird with a bunch of co-workers. If you stand in the right spot, you can actually see into the bathroom with the door closed. A proper locking door would be a good upgrade.

We had a problem with the electronic door lock when we arrived (the batteries were low and it wouldn't open). Derik came right down and took care of it quickly.

Overall, we were extremely happy with our stay and I'd definitely book the Seattle Oasis again."
59838,4243377,2013-04-22,4811675,Vivian,"Darik and Sarah were wonderful hosts and made everything extremely easy for us! The apartment is beautiful, clean, and in the perfect location. We had clean towels which were a nice bonus! I highly recommend renting from Darik and Sarah!

"
59838,4292683,2013-04-25,3738659,Carline,"Very good place, well located, very clean, with good services (sports room and billiards in the ground floor, and a nice-good-equipped rooftop with barbecue, deck chairs...).
The minus problem was the bathroom's doors: ""japanese panels"" don't offer lots of intimacy..."
59838,4571933,2013-05-13,5424516,Jody,"Our condo was very clean, nicely decorated and the beds were comfortable. The unit was well stocked and we had everything we needed for our weekend stay. We easily walked to all the attractions and there are many great places to eat within blocks of the unit. Also we enjoyed relaxing on the rooftop, it was a beautiful sunny weekend!"
59838,4672366,2013-05-20,4251191,Tina,"We loved our stay! Everything was as described, the location was perfect, and check-in was seamless. The beds were comfortable, and the entire apt was spotless. I would definitely recommend Darik's place and would stay there again in a heartbeat!"
59838,5358992,2013-06-26,4240429,Jason,Nice clean apartment with lots of public transportation right at your doorstep. We enjoyed our week in this apartment and would recommend to anyone traveling to Seattle. 
59838,5980631,2013-07-25,2708375,Candace,"Check-In was easy.  Great location.  Clean and cozy.  Coffee pot was broken and was not replaced for us but being in Seattle it wasn't too hard to find a good cup of coffee.  However, when we called maintenance they came up to take a look and walked in with out knocking (they thought we had checked out even though we had 2 more days there) The place is smaller than the pictures make it appear but there was 6 of us and we were totally fine--just had to have a shower schedule.  All things considered, we would definitely stay again. "
59838,6609055,2013-08-19,4430565,Jane,"Great location central to everything and apartment was clean and fully stocked. Be warned, apartment is on the 3rd floor and right outside is a very noisy bus stop and road but it may have been particularly noisy because we were there at the same time as HempFest! Also, it being Seattle there was no air conditioning and the apartment was stiflingly hot - but keeping the windows open meant super noisy....I would definitely return to this apartment but not in the heat of summer."
59838,9495096,2013-12-31,395877,Adit,"This place was perfect for my stay in Seattle. It's very close to numerous restaurants, coffee shops, and great eats. 

Darick took care of everything and the place was very neat and clean. 

Highly recommend staying here!"
59838,10339614,2014-02-14,8143384,Paul,Nice place once you arrive in the apartment. In a student building. Very close to downtown. Underground parking a plus.
59838,10673895,2014-03-03,2646829,Lauren,"Our stay was fantastic! The apartment had everything we needed, and were able to sleep 6 comfortably. The location was perfect - we were able to walk everywhere and feel safe no matter what time of day. We were even able to utilize the rooftop patio area and had a lovely time bundled up around the fire pit. A great alternative to a hotel room. The apartment definitely felt homey and comfortable. "
59838,11172532,2014-03-24,11465539,Leshu,"Clean, comfortable, and well-located, the apartment was a great place to stay. All details were sorted, making arrival straightforward and easy. As the apartment faces the street, some might find the noise a problem, but that is often a personal matter. I would definitely want to stay here again if I were to return to Seattle. "
59838,11713114,2014-04-13,3459194,Quinn,"My colleagues and I had a wonderful stay in Darik's condo while at a conference in downtown Seattle. The kitchen was very well-stocked and we were able to save a ton of money by preparing our breakfasts and lunches at the condo. The condo was a few short blocks from the downtown hotels and it was nice to have a walk built into our day. We had some lovely meals in the Belltown neighborhood. We fit four people and though cozy, the pull out couch was helpful. The host was very responsive and helped us out with an early check-in. Thanks for a great stay! "
59838,14267633,2014-06-16,13062813,Mark,"The Host was communicative and helpful. The apartment was very nice, comfortable for 3-4 people. Great rooftop for larger parties. Neighborhood was great location for being walking distance to many places, though there are a number of homeless in the area."
59838,14726334,2014-06-24,2886092,Abir,The reservation was canceled 53 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
59838,17738176,2014-08-17,2191855,Mel,"Had a lovely time in Seattle! The apartment was beautiful and well stocked (we had pretty much everything we needed to cook seafood on the rooftop grill). It was also centrally located, so we could walk to most restaurants, Pike's Place, and even the ferry terminal to get to Bainbridge Island.  I loved reading the guestbook for suggestions from previous guests. Very helpful!

We had six people staying at the apartment at full capacity, so it was a bit tight on space, but it would fit four or five people very comfortably! My only warning is the lack of privacy in the bathroom (sliding doors with a tiny crack on the sides), but it wasn't really a problem in my opinion. Plus, there's another bathroom downstairs in the lobby if you're in an emergency.

Thank you for the space!"
59838,18646452,2014-08-30,13007791,Nick,"After having stayed at Seattle Oasis's Ocean View at Belltown Courts, this place was a disappointment. They were priced relatively the same but different in care and feel. 

The TV, bathroom fan, Internet, and main room light were all not working properly when we arrived and were not able to be fixed before we left. The unit was serviceable but was stuffy and had a lot of street noise. 

The unit has great appeal and met our needs although the value of the unit was not there as compared to the Belltown Courts unit. "
59838,18791016,2014-09-01,1002779,Megan,"This was the perfect location for our long weekend in Seattle. Belltown is a walker's paradise! The apartment is super cute and there's plenty of room for four people. Plus, the towels and robes were luxurious! The apartment building is quiet, and there's a lovely rooftop terrace with a view of the bay. Checking in and out of the building was a breeze thanks to the excellent instructions we received from Seattle Vacation Rentals. I highly recommend the Seattle VR app which includes local recommendations, such as the restaurant Local 360 which we loved. We will definitely try to stay in the same apartment on our next trip to Seattle."
59838,19119449,2014-09-07,15398868,Giovanni,My stay was awesome. Te place was very clean and in a great location. I would definitely go back. 
59838,19411115,2014-09-12,17946030,Iain,"Very nice apartment and central location. Check in info was second to none and made finding the apartment Very easy and stress free.
Many thanks Darik. Will book again if we are in Seattle"
59838,19508881,2014-09-14,12649803,Kacey,"The place was great! Very clean, and well decorated. All check-in and check-out instructions were easy to understand. So many things to do in the immediate area and the place was perfect!! "
59838,19924609,2014-09-21,15911821,Andrea,The condo was lovely and the location was great. We were extremely comfortable and found the amenities wonderful. The building is incredibly quiet. 
59838,20138056,2014-09-24,2538622,Bram,"Great compact apartment in Downtown Seattle at walking distance from Pike Place Market. Kitchen equipment is just fine for cooking basic meals. Mattresses were very comfortable, the street in front of the apartment complex can be a bit noisy with traffic 24/7."
59838,20278681,2014-09-27,2284696,Ray Bee,"This apartment is in a very good location , we walk everywhere, 1st and 2nd ave have a lot of good restaurants and bars.
Apartment is clean , and comfortable. Good quality of towel."
59838,21686134,2014-10-21,835353,Laura,"Really nice apartment in a great neighborhood in Seattle! Check-in procedure was easy, apartment was clean, and the roof deck is amazing. Thanks! "
59838,22103229,2014-10-30,13928133,Priya,The apartment had everything we needed. Location was great- close to cafes and restaurants. Check in/ out was easy. Would definitely recommend. 
59838,22445780,2014-11-06,5689471,Andy,"There wasn't a host per se. It was all ""electronic"" making this feel more like a self service hotel. The staff was available via email and phone so questions were promptly answered and everything was as advertised."
59838,22959902,2014-11-18,4076730,Omri,"The check-in process was very smooth but it was automated. This is more like staying at an apartment hotel than a traditional airbnb but it was great for our purposes. The apartment is nice and in a great location. The shower is great, the beds are comfortable, and the kitchen has everything you need if you want to cook. Darik left some nice amenities for us including maps and some bottles of water. There are plenty of extra towels and the internet/TV work well. They were very accommodating about a late check out as well and overall were very pleasant. "
59838,23541705,2014-12-03,24340585,Daniel,"Nice little welcoming package was ready for us when we got there. The place was very clean, and included dishes and glasses, etc (essentials you would need.) Nice part of the city, within walking distance to many cool restaurants. View from the rooftop is great! We would stay there again."
59838,23903373,2014-12-14,22557885,Anita,"The apartment is just as good as it shows on the website 
My family enjoyed our stay and we would love to stay here again !"
59838,24062415,2014-12-18,23051616,Jeff,Nice place.  Would stay there agin based on the location... Good amenities and wonderful organization throughout.
59838,24104933,2014-12-20,8132198,Judit,"The condo is very clean and in great condition. It is well-stocked, and the directions are clear and easy to follow. Great location with lots of good restaurants nearby. You can hear your neighbors (if they play music, the walls are not particularly soundproof), but they weren't loud late in the evening. The doors to the bathroom and second bedroom are frosted (and are sliding with some gaps remaining when closed!) and don't provide the best privacy. Great choice though for a stay in Seattle!"
59838,24325505,2014-12-26,10949242,Stephanie,"Great location and accurate description before arrival. We were right between downtown/Pike Place and the space needle, about half a mile from each, so we were able to walk to everything. There is some street noise being on a busy street, but that's the trade off you will have to make for a great urban location.

The place is a small two bedroom, but had everything we needed including all of the kitchen stuff, linens, and towels. As mentioned in other reviews, the bathroom door is funky, see through, and there is a gap on both sides when you close it, but oh well. The apartment has some signs of wear and tear but not too bad. Having the gym there was also convenient and we used it. 

The hosts were responsive both before we arrived and while we were there. I definitely recommend this in lieu of a hotel if you are looking to have a kitchen and more space, if the price is comparable."
59838,24658619,2015-01-01,6096451,Edgar,"Very responsive team available at all times to help and answer questions. Walking distance to everything, great location. There was a smell in the hallways of the building but luckily, it didn't enter the room."
59838,24956768,2015-01-04,23647839,Megan,A great location and a lovely apartment!!!
59838,26014261,2015-02-01,122944,Tom,Great stay and fantastic location!
59838,27833890,2015-03-13,26544183,Dennis,"Darik and Sally made everything seamless. The apartment maintained a well groomed and spacious feel, all the while having one of the best locations in Seattle. Whenever I had a question, they did not hesitate to respond and help out. It was a great stay overall!"

Great first airbnb experience. Darik really has his business down to the tee. Prime location. Nice 10 min walk to Pikes Place Market or the Space Needle. 

Check in was a breeze, and like the other reviews state, it's all automated or done over the phone. If you know how to follow directions you shouldn't have any problems, as he has them step by step. Easy, covered, secured garage parking was a plus. 

2 bedrooms with 2 queen beds, plus a sofa couch fit 6 perfectly.  No need to fight over who gets the bed, becuase the sofa couch was the most comfortable pull out bed I have ever slept on.  

Kitchen was stocked with all the necessary utinsels. Plenty of towels, and extra sheets. 

Cool balcony to hangout on. Me and my friends used the gym and the roof top deck. 

Overall great experience here. Would definitely recommend this to my friends and family! "
59838,28985510,2015-04-02,23829766,Hemant,"We arrived late at night after 11:00pm and were tired after a long flight. We had some trouble getting into the condo building and parking at first and had to make more than a couple phone calls to find our way in. 

Our stay however was excellent. The place was clean and the host very responsive to any questions.. we almost didn't need to call them.
Of the bedrooms is slightly smaller than the other, but it worked out ok for us. 

The location is great. Walking distance from Space Needle and other attractions and also the Pike Place Market which is just a few blocks from the place. Its actually centrally located."
59838,29660430,2015-04-11,6687021,Kara,"We enjoyed our stay very much in the apartment. It was a great location and had everything we needed. The beds were great and the place was VERY clean. We had 5 people with us and it was a bit tight but plenty of room for just sleeping. The roof deck was also great for a sunny day! The only one thing that I would say was that the apartment was a bit dated.  The toilet, while very clean, had warn marks on the seat and the floors had been badly scratched.  I would recommend staying here again regardless. A wonderful stay! "
59838,30482268,2015-04-22,20577693,Frances,"Upsides: The apartment is very nicely decorated and there was a nice welcome tray awaiting us.  Kitchen was fully equipped and beds were comfortable.  Very spacious and clean.
Downsides: The building (hallways and entry) was loud, smelly, and dirty.  The street noise was so loud  on  Monday night until about 3 am, so sleeping was impossible.  The apartment itself needs some TLC.  Towel hanger fell off wall when I hung up my towel, curtain hooks falling off, blinds bent and broken, soap dispenser in kitchen broken."
59838,32461051,2015-05-18,27296190,Michael,"Check in was relatively easy. The description was very accurate. Overall I had a great Experience. The rooftop patio is AMAZING and single handedly made the trip for us. 6/10 for neighbourhood, 9/10 for location, 9/10 for amenities

9/10 overall"
59838,36125042,2015-06-25,18098508,Kim,"Darik was an amazing host. We were travelling for business, so weren't sure how airbnb would compare to a hotel, but it was great. Darik sent very thorough and clear check-in instructions, directions, etc. Before we arrived, there was a good amount of communication via email so that we knew just what to do. We parked, got the keys and into the garage in less time than going through a hotel front desk.  The condo was spacious enough for all of us. The furnishings were modern, the beds comfortable, plenty of coffee, free beverages and a light snack were waiting for us. It was very clean and we felt welcome.
It was a hot day in Seattle, but there were plenty of high quality fans to cool us and we enjoyed sitting on the balcony and watching the city scene below.  There are plenty of restaurants for dinner, lunch and breakfast within 2 blocks. You can also walk to the Public Market, one of the city's main attractions. Easy to get to the ballparks or downtown.
"
59838,41724041,2015-08-09,28279238,Jesse,"Great spot for our vacation. Walking distance from Key Arena.  Was clean & ready for arrival.  Looks bigger in pictures than in reality, wasn't an issue & we had 5 guys staying. 
All we could have hoped for.

"
59838,47268076,2015-09-17,19793906,Christian,Awesome stay.  Very professional experience and very friendly. 
59838,48983613,2015-09-30,2559473,Alex,Anthony's place is very clean and modern.  It's also very centrally located and near many great restaurants.  I highly recommend his place.
59838,49419749,2015-10-04,30974971,Mel,"Great condo! Very clean, close to everything. Loved all the amenities. Darik and everyone at Seattle Oasis were communicative and polite. Would definitely stay here again. "
59838,51427840,2015-10-20,18169934,Jack,This location was great. Only a few blocks from the needle and pike place market along with many bars on 2nd avenue. The place was clean and very nice with plenty of space for four people.  The only weird part was the sliding door in the bathroom that didn't lock. Everything else was great. I wish we would have spent more time on the rooftop. We didn't go up there until the last day. I highly recommend this place. 
59838,52182949,2015-10-26,8249489,Rebecca,The host canceled this reservation 51 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
59838,53052862,2015-11-04,10761145,Elise,"We had a pleasant stay at the apartment. There was a welcome package for us to enjoy and a lot of extra information. Parking really came in handy!
The apt is located quite central, everything is walkable. Overall, a good experience."
59838,53385223,2015-11-08,16325775,Ryan,"Great space, clean, up to date. The location was the stand out. There were lots of great restaurants and bars at our doorsteps.  Definitely would recommend or have a repeat visit."
4360604,28470088,2015-03-24,23275272,June,"Noel is a very nice host. Warm house clean room, we feel so welcoming all the time and willing to help when we have any problem. She picked us from the airport which so appreciate due to i have 2 BIG luggage! Ha! I would love to come back again for my next visit!"
4360604,28654990,2015-03-28,27052989,Hannah,"Noel is a wonderful host whose kindness and humor exceeded our expectations. On the first day, we arrived at the wrong house about 10 blocks away, but she picked us up with her car. Upon arrival, we were provided with keys and the wifi password, as well as a document that describes things around the house: coffee maker, laundry machines, etc. and nearby restaurants. She was also quick to provide us with necessities such as towels, and was down to talk about virtually anything. We even watched standup comedy together.
 The neighborhood was quiet and lovely, and the home itself felt spacious-- we were free to watch TV and use kitchen amenities. She was so welcoming that I instantly felt like it was my own home.
She has two cats, and the description provided by other guests for them are accurate. I'm not usually a cat-person but the cats were super sweet and lovable. 
Overall, the stay with Noel was an amazing experience, and I hope that future guests also get to experience this as well! "
4360604,28878444,2015-03-31,22462543,John,Noel was very welcoming--a great host. The room was small but comfortable. We enjoyed our stay.
4360604,29805356,2015-04-12,30915805,Kim,"Lovely host! Me and my boyfriend were very welcomed at Noels place, eventhough we only booked one day in advance.
Whether you want to chat with Noel and sit in the cosy living room or if you want to stay in your room and enjoy some peace and quiet - both is possible. We would always go here again and can only recommend a stay with Noel and her two great cats."
4360604,33422107,2015-05-27,32862906,Ellen,"I appreciated Noel's flexibility with my last-minute request and with my deciding on a second night. I felt welcome and comfortable. The room was cozy and the high bed gave me a fun feeling of being in a compartment on some kind of conveyance going somewhere. The bedside lamp was a nice touch. The cat is beautiful and very affectionate. The house is on a little street not far from a small field with a pond, as well as cafes, restaurants, pubs, a theater, and stores that have just about everything a traveler might need. Nearby buses take you to the beach, to Green Lake and beyond, or along Phinney Ridge and to downtown. Noel is clearly a mover and a shaker and I wish her all the best in this and future endeavors. Thank you!!"
4360604,33488589,2015-05-28,32862906,Ellen,"I'd happily stay with Noel again. Her understanding and warm welcome helped me turn a stressful point in my trip back into the adventure I was seeking. The room was a fine place to concentrate, and we found an instant balance of me being left to my own devices (laptop and cell phone!), chatting in passing, and enjoying some music we both love. That she was willing to change plans and host me at the last minute is highly commendable and was a great relief to me when I wasn't seeing anything else I could afford and travel to in time the first evening. It's also a great value, and I would like to see more Airbnb hosts offer such reasonable rates."
4360604,39329162,2015-07-22,38038226,Michelle,"We had a great time staying with Noel and the kitties. The house was spacious, clean, and inviting. Our room was comfortable and served as a great home base. There was a grocery store nearby and we cooked a few meals in the kitchen. Backyard patio was great to lounge in. There are many restaurants, coffee shops, bars, shops, and bus stops nearby. Neighborhood was quiet and downtown was about 30 mins away. Noel was a great host. Very friendly, helpful, and professional. Mako and kelly were sweethearts as well. I definitely recommend staying here and would come back again. Thanks a bunch!"
4360604,41062521,2015-08-04,28256615,Wei,The place was exactly it was described and it really good condition. House was really clean and comfortable. The cats in the house were friendly and sociable. Noel was quick to reply me with any inquiries I had. Would definitely stay here again if I'm back at Seattle.
4360604,49413991,2015-10-03,254235,Andrian,"A wonderful quiet place in our most favorite neighborhood in Seattle!
We spent a couple of days on our way out of the city (moving back to California), and it was a beginning of a very smooth transition.
We highly recommend this place to anyone who's looking to enjoy Greenwood spirit. Definitely, Chuck's Hop Shop is a must for anybody new to the area, as well as Neptune Coffee & Mr Gyros - all local treasures, all within walking distance."
4360604,49700374,2015-10-05,5538786,Brad,Noel was very welcoming.  Very down to earth and gracious. Great place to get around Seattle from - especially being able to walk to good restaurants in her neighborhood. 
4360604,50957115,2015-10-16,45217956,Brenna,"This was a great place to stay! Noel and her kitty companions made me feel very welcome without being intrusive. Noel's pleasant demeanor and easygoing attitude make being in her house a delight! The house is right in the middle of everything, close to fantastic food and activities. The house itself is sunny and inviting. Thanks for the lovely week,  Noel!!"
4360604,51557525,2015-10-21,6694231,Joshua,"All around really wonderful experience. Noel, and her adorable cats Kelly Belly and Mako all made us feel very welcome during our stay in Seattle. She was in close communication with us throughout our visit making sure we would have an easy time getting into her house as well as offering the use of all the amenities in the kitchen, her cozy lounge/sitting area, and plenty of delicious tea. It was such a pleasurable experience, and the neighborhood was super quiet which was awesome after having days packed with activity both in Seattle and out at the national park. Thank you so so much Noel for having us!"
4360604,52776895,2015-11-01,43141689,Kelly,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Noel's. She was a warm and fun hostess and made me feel welcome immediately. Her home was exactly as described right down to her friendly felines. The house is in a great location and walking distance to the Greenwood neighborhood with a lot of great restaurants and coffee shops and a great women's spa and sauna. I spent a week there as a 'quiet retreat' and that is exactly what I got! Thanks Noel :)
4360604,53032738,2015-11-03,44193515,Shannon,Noel really is the hostess with the mostest. She lives in a great part of town- restaurants  right down the street. Her cats are awesome and she was incredibly welcoming. Exactly what we were looking for. Thanks for everything Noel!
4360604,55082345,2015-11-27,44097025,Andreas,It was such a nice place definitely worth the price! Noel completely opened her home for us! Great host! I recommend it to everyone visiting the city!
4360604,55207719,2015-11-29,45562831,Matthew,"My friend and I had a lovely time stating at Noel's. It was easy to find and was a pleasure staying there. The place was clean and comfortable, and Noel was helpful and available for anything. And of course the kitties were a plus!"

8409941,54422141,2015-11-19,49136419,Mike,This was my first Airbnb experiece and Dario's place will make it hard for others to compare This place is better than advertised.  It's very quiet and very clean. The bed is very comfortable and the whole room has a nice relaxing feel to it. But the best is the (email hidden)tually the shower. That thing is amazing!!! Just what I needed to end a long day with!  
8409941,54561933,2015-11-21,49136419,Mike,I really enjoyed staying here. The place is super clean and comfy. The shower was a godsend dealing with my hurt back. I would stay here any time I need a place. 
8409941,54939463,2015-11-25,43147319,Mohammed,"This is the best house I had ever live in. Dario was really good person and he respond all my message immediately. Also, what I liked in this house how clean is it and really quite area. Thank you Dario and thank you Airbnb.    I will be more happy to live in this house again if I plan to come to Seattle, it will my first choice. "

8409941,55760203,2015-12-05,37199235,Nancy,The Seward location and house are ideal.  There is the attention to detail that I have seen in your other places.  I would choose to stay here whenever it is available.  Unfortunately that is not often.
8409941,56708232,2015-12-16,30153228,Tom,Communication was easy and the space was just what we needed. It was a great option for our quick overnighter. 
8409941,56864856,2015-12-19,49280786,Chenghuizi,"This is a very nice house to live in. The location is near to the Lake Washington. I went to the Seward Park by foot and enjoyed my day there. This is an awesome Airbnb experience for me. Thank you, Dairo. "
8409941,57314515,2015-12-24,6091393,Mireia,Dario's place was a perfect choice. The house is in a quiet area near of the city center by car. The house was clean and the included breakfast was a good tip.
2352218,11677007,2014-04-11,9583162,Bernard,Kay was a wonderful host. Very prompt in answering any questions i had. Space was clean and well put together. Definitely would recommend her place to anyone visiting the area 
2352218,12321739,2014-04-28,108689,Anne,"I very much appreciated my stay at the Wedgwood Retreat in Seattle. The ease of making the arrangements including getting the key and check out were super helpful for me on this trip. The space was warm, clean, private and as shown in the photos. It exceeded my expectations in terms of value. It felt like I had a thoughtfully put together apartment all to myself. I will definitely consider this space again, when the opportunity arises. Thank you, Kay!"
2352218,12668255,2014-05-07,12436654,Jaclyn,Kay was great! Very accommodating to our late arrival and had cute helpful notes around.  Also left us a little welcoming basket that happened to have my favorite tea as well as a little map for the restaurants and pubs in walking distance.  The space was clean and well put together in a lovely neighborhood.  We happened to be in Seattle during surprisingly sunny and dry day and we enjoyed walking down to the park.  Comfortable bed and excellent water pressure.  Will definitely stay again - cannot imagine a better airBnB experience.
2352218,12760052,2014-05-10,9831910,Kari,Kay was great! Her attention to the little details made a big impression on us. We had a small hitch on our last day but Kay and her daughter were extremely helpful and made it smooth sailing. We found the Wedgewood Retreat to be clean and comfortable. The location was great for us. We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others.
2352218,13159883,2014-05-20,1858568,Alison,My stay at the Wedgwood Retreat was perfect! Kay was a wonderful host and met me when I arrived even though I was an hour early. The space was perfect with more than enough room and fun details everywhere.  It is a little chilly but Kay addresses this with heaters so you can adjust the temperature to your comfort level. The kitchen is well stocked with everything needed to function on your vacation and even includes some wonderful teas and snacks! The neighborhood is not that far from a lot of tourist locations yet quiet enough that sleep was no problem for this very light sleeper! I plan on staying here again should the opportunity arise!
2352218,13677379,2014-06-02,14509154,Amanda,"Kay was friendly, welcoming, and was very helpful in answering any questions we had about her place or Seattle and the surrounding area in general. We were initially concerned that there was not a way to make coffee, but when we arrived, Kay had fitted the place with a french press and even provided some nice organic coffee. The coffee was only one part of the warm welcoming basket we received at the Retreat, which certainly added comfort to our stay. It should also be noted that there are shampoo, conditioner, and soap provided in the shower. The place is just as it is in the pictures, so there are no surprises. It is a basement, so it can be a little cool, but there are plenty of heaters and Kay and her daughter were very careful about making noise. We had no problems sleeping or having our privacy and the bed is very comfortable. There are bus connections to downtown and the U-disctrict, but it is probably most convenient to have a car here. Tucked in a pleasant green neighborhood, the Wedgewood Retreat is truly a cozy place to end the day. "
2352218,13967341,2014-06-09,7366439,Tanya,"Kay was a very gracious host and had great communication skills. I rented the place for my brother and sister-in-law while they were visiting me, and they had a great time.  "
2352218,14685164,2014-06-24,5559883,Sarah,"The Retreat was charming, the location was perfect, and the hosts are wonderful. I would highly recommend this to anyone staying in the area."
2352218,14839598,2014-06-27,65865,Sophia,"What a quaint, lovely place! It's not too far of a drive from downtown Seattle, but it's like living in the woods next to the lake. Tons of trees, a quick jog to the trail by the lake, super quiet neighborhood, interesting houses, tons of greenery and summer blooms. 

Kay's home may be in the basement, but it's set up very cozily, with warm throws, pleasing deco and lots of comfy couches and seats. What I appreciate is that she doesn't skimp on the details. She set up a little basket of snacks (nuts, breakfast cookies, Teavana tea bag, Starbucks coffee), which was a very grateful touch for me, having had a long and busy travel. There are dishes, cups, good towels, a microwave/convection oven (nice!), induction heater, lovely-smelling lemongrass soap, pretty much anything you need. 

I didn't meet Kay, and she gives me the privacy I needed. This place is my top choice the next time I'm back to Seattle. Thank you, Kay."
2352218,15761686,2014-07-15,2007933,Valerie,"I did not have the pleasure of meeting Kay, but her basement apartment was quaint and cozy. Her daughter Emily followed up with me to see if I needed anything when Kay was out of town and Kay offered to put a list of sights to see together for us while we were in Seattle. Although I did not spend too much time at the retreat due to wedding obligations, my time in the apartment was enjoyable and pleasant. We hope to be back. Thanks,Kay!"
2352218,15988610,2014-07-19,3444330,Levi,This is a wonderful place located really close to everything and yet still far enough away that you really feel the retreat. Kay is a wonderful host and has really appointed the place well. It is perfect for a couples getaway. 
2352218,16255191,2014-07-24,16508800,Chen,"The place is very clean and nice, and Kay is a most wonderful host. I enjoyed my stay there very much! 

"
2352218,16929379,2014-08-04,6858699,Maggie,"Such a great location for a weekend in Seattle! The retreat was perfect for us, we were only in town for a short time and were able to come and go as we pleased! It was the little things that make this place special, like the welcome basket, Seattle tour guides, the fluffy towels, and even the shampoo/conditioner provided. It's your own space, separate from the main house and we loved it! Highly recommended! "
2352218,17004590,2014-08-05,104584,Rosanna,Kay was so helpful and accommodating. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at her place and would certainly stay here again on a return trip to Seattle. It's a great place for a great price!
2352218,17165662,2014-08-08,17582550,Alexandra,"This location was perfect for our quiet, 2 night stay split between visiting friends up in Kenmore and sightseeing in downtown Seattle! The bed was comfortable, the retreat was clean, and everything was as advertised. Kay was a lovely host and welcomed us with the information we needed but then gave us the privacy and quiet we needed for this visit. "
2352218,17297178,2014-08-10,12932928,Natalia,This place was a retreat indeed! It's a quiet and clean place in a very chill neighborhood. We didn't meet Kay but everything went clear and smoothly. After long days out exploring the city it was great to go back to this place. 
2352218,17615514,2014-08-15,15656226,Danette,"Pros:
Its location is very convenient, not far from Downtown Seattle, restaurants and malls nearby. Quiet neighborhood, nice little apartment, comfortable. Host is friendly and easy to get in contact with. Get greetings from Mocha, the host's cute cat.
Cons:
Can hear upstairs' footsteps, noise from bathroom(maybe water pumping)."
2352218,18549861,2014-08-28,12990124,Serge,"Lovely place, very cozy and very clean. Super comfy bed! Kay took care of all the little details to make sure I felt at home. I even had a handsome feline visitor. :)"
2352218,18808449,2014-09-01,3020568,Jesse,"This was a wonderful place to stay! Kay was very easy to communicate with, and it's a really well kept space. Comfortable bed, and a really beautiful yard (the hammock is quite nice!). I'd definitely stay here again when in Seattle."
2352218,19606315,2014-09-15,594768,Anne,"No problem parking or getting into the apartment.  Everything clean and spacious.  Kitchen equipped with basics.  Cool inside, but heaters provided. 
everything as described.  Close to main streets, but quiet residential area.  Comfortable.  
"
2352218,19981630,2014-09-21,5003847,Cecilia,"Two thumbs up for the Wedgewood Retreat! It was spacious, very clean, and cozy and a great place to land after a couple days in Olympic National Park. The pictures don't do it justice. The neighborhood was convenient (we had a rental car so I'm not sure about public transportation options) and quiet. Kay was very responsive and although we didn't have a chance to meet her, she provided helpful tips for our visit to the area and to Olympic National Park during our pre-trip communications. The bed was comfortable, fluffy bedding & towels, lots of space heaters around to take any chill out of the air (usually only had to turn one on for a short while), nice lighting throughout the retreat, plenty of space to store your luggage and belongings, large full-power microwave, etc. Many nice little touches and thoughtful instructions/suggestions. Yes, you do hear some footsteps and normal living sounds sometimes from upstairs, but this is expected in a basement apartment and was not an issue; made it feel even cosier, in my opinion. Kay & her daughter make an effort to keep noise down and, in fact, ask you to put a pinwheel outside the door in the garden when you leave for your day's explorations so they can do any loud household chores upstairs while you are out. Very considerate! I'm a cat lover and wish I had met the handsome grey cat who lives upstairs & who is mentioned in some of these reviews; I did see him sunning himself on the front porch. Another time, perhaps! The Wedgewood Retreat is a fantastic value for the price. I would not hesitate to stay here again and recommend it to family, friends, and fellow airbnb-ers. "
2352218,22563030,2014-11-09,3217622,Sarah,"This was a very nice, convenient cabin-type accommodation.  The bed was comfortable, and the unit itself was very functional.  I really only needed a warm, easy place to stay in a nice part of town, and Kay's place fit the bill perfectly.  There was a great coffee place (Van Gogh) about a mile down the road, parking was easy, and I had no issues.  All in all, very pleasant.

Also, I heard no meaningful noise from upstairs -- maybe some footsteps, but nothing I would call bothersome at all."
2352218,22817903,2014-11-15,23587089,Layne,We had such a wonderful time here! The place was very warm and cozy and we felt right at home. Beautiful yard with lots of space to park out front. Really great area and it was relatively easy to find. I will definitely be looking Kay (who was incredibly helpful and nice) up again next time I go to Seattle.
2352218,23405635,2014-11-30,7679810,Ed,Kay's place was wonderful. It was in a very peaceful neighborhood and the retreat was very spacious. We had a great time and will definitely recommend it!
2352218,23864937,2014-12-13,21944757,Richard,"Our experience at Kay's was overwhelmingly  positive. The place was exactly  as described  and beautiful. Kay has obviously put much  effort  into  making this retreat  a home away from home. Although  we didn't  meet, Kay was  a lovely  host, providing necessities as we needed  them  for bad weather. The bed is super comfortable and she provided a hamper of small complimentary snacks. Kay's place was extremely clean, well heated and protected from the weather,  even though we stayed during quite intense storms. Although we didn't have a chance to meet her personally, Kay was responsive and caring. Upon returning one night,  we found glowsticks and head torches had been placed in a waterproof bag on the door handle while we were gone. This was in preparation for a rather large storm that was predicted to knock out power. It's this kind of thoughtfulness you can expect if Kay is your host. We loved staying here and would love to come back here on our next  visit  to Seattle. 

Just a short note, if booking this accommodation with  no car  and you plan on  using public  transport, take the 522 bus to Lake City Way cross 125th Ave and then the 65 bus from in front of Subway, which will drop you off around the corner  from  her place. Public  transport went smoothly  with us. 

Once again, thank you for your hospitality Kay,  this is the place everyone  should choose! :)"
2352218,24602569,2014-12-31,24260777,Loren,"The Meadowbrook Retreat was exactly as advertised and more! We found it to be very comfortable, clean, practically bursting with amenities (free wi-fi! coffee! all the cooking needs we could want! travel guides and brochures!), and in a location that perfectly suited our needs (quiet neighborhood, ample parking, near enough to downtown and other fun neighborhoods, and also close to where our friends were staying). With our car, it was super easy to get from the Retreat to anywhere in Seattle. We met Kay on our second day in town and were very pleased with how nice and accommodating both she and her daughter were. In fact, they were so quiet that, with the exception of occasional footfalls from the upstairs, it really felt like we were in our own home/apartment (I actually worried that *we* were too loud sometimes!). 
We would definitely recommend this location to future visitors to Seattle."
2352218,25220493,2015-01-09,4917676,Winter,"I travel all the time and have stayed at Airbnb places all over the world and found the Meadowbrook location perfect for our stay in Seattle. It was clean, neat, and well organized.  I could see care and attention to detail that made for a wonderful stay. Thank you!"
2352218,25344758,2015-01-12,2315832,Abbie,"We stayed in Kay's very pleasant basement apt while on a whirlwind househunting weekend. Everything was comfortable and easy, from the Mr. Coffee K-cup coffee machine and quick-boiling hot water kettle to the magnifico convection/microwave to the excellent bed and full-size closet and dresser. As described, the kitchenette has the basics of two sets of flatware, 2 mugs, 2 glasses, 2 bowls, 2 stoneware plates & 2 each salad-size and dinner-size plates, saucepan and skillet for the portable burner, etc. You won't be doing major cooking here, but you will enjoy the space and the terrific neighborhood. We appreciated the fluffy bath towels and the cozy seating of an evening. Wi-fi is strong with no hiccups. Cafe Javasti on 35th is a great coffee shop abt 10 min. walk away, and a nice QFC grocery store is a stones-throw further. You can zip around town by bike or bus, and it's easy to get everywhere by car as well. Kay made sure we had everything we need, and we really enjoyed chatting with her when she came by to introduce herself. Everyone should have the pleasure of a stay with Kay!"
2352218,25684565,2015-01-23,24950835,Patricia,"I so enjoyed the restful, spacious and comfy setting at the Meadowbrook Retreat.  The neighborhood is peaceful with green spaces and big bodies of water nearby.  Kay is so kind and  thoughtful in communications.  I'll be back!
"
2352218,26277390,2015-02-08,27020080,Sandra,"The Meadowbrook retreat was perfect for my stay in Seattle while doing a yoga workshop just down the road. The place was quiet, had all the amenities that I could need and was in a lovely neighbourhood with some great coffee shops close by. The apartment had a lovely selection of unusual books on the area that I wish I'd had a chance to look at.  I didn't get a chance to meet Kay on this occasion as I was out all day but she was very helpful in providing good directions to her house and making me feel welcome by email."
2352218,26963876,2015-02-22,3711271,Jerry,"Nice place to stay! We have a very good time in Kay's house,The room is super clean and very comfortable bed. everything was great!  Highly recommend."
2352218,27293149,2015-03-01,2985175,Christine,"Kay communicated well with me in advance of our arrival and provided us with lovely accommodations! The basement suite was cozy and comfortable, and perfectly located for our needs. The kitchen was also surprisingly very well-appointed and would have worked well if we needed it to cook. We had a great time here and will return on our next visit to Seattle!"
2352218,28434509,2015-03-23,2163609,Phillip,Kay's meadowbrook retreat is 15 min north of downtown Seattle and it was exactly what we were looking for. A nice space with a comfy bed and a backyard to wind down in after traversing the city. Kay left a bunch of reading material to help acquaint us to the city and before arriving she wrote me a couple of detailed emails on suggestions of where to go and eat. I would definitely stay with Kay again.
2352218,28728262,2015-03-29,28529343,Carolyn,"My flight arrived at 10 am and Kay was kind enough to let us check in a couple hours early and even had the heaters on in the rooms to warm up the floor. The area was cozy, had a little kitchen with a Kurig, and had a seating area."
2352218,34325549,2015-06-07,33195246,Gary,"Everything was great. The space is larger and more generous than expected. We loved the outdoor area to sit with a glass of wine.  It is completely relaxing after being busy all day. The kitchen is also very good and would have everything you need for an extended stay. 
The retreat has very easy access to get into Seattle and the area nearby has restaurants, a Safeway market and good coffee shops. "
2352218,35309199,2015-06-17,24284918,Will,"Very welcoming host, easy to communicate with.  Small and quiet location in the city.  Both met and exceeded our expectations."
2352218,36396622,2015-06-28,19202476,Peter,"Our experience at the Meadowbrook Retreat was fantastic from the first day to the last. Kay welcomed us upon arrival and made sure we got settled with ease. You have an entire floor to yourself, and the space is more than generous. The neighborhood is also quiet and peaceful. All I can really say is that coming ""home"" was very relaxing every night during our stay in Seattle. Thanks again, Kay!"
2352218,36844768,2015-07-01,1624396,Hartley,"The place was super cozy, it almost felt like staying with a relative or old friend. Kay was great with communication and responded quickly when our plans changed and we needed an extra night. The area is quiet and there are a few eating spots within walking distance, definitely check out Green Lake if the weather is nice! It was a great place to use as a base for exploring Seattle."
2352218,37846108,2015-07-11,17207870,Taylor,"Kay and her retreat were amazing!  First, I was having a bike dropped off using Pedal Anywhere.  It got there before me and Kay was kind enough to bring it in.  Shortly after I arrived she came down to show me around the place, see if I needed anything, and of course share the bike situation.  She was very very nice.  I didn't see her any time after that, but she checked up on me which was kind.  

This place is very cute and has the works.  There's a microwave (which apparently has functions like an oven), refrigerator, hot plate, pans, plates, bowls, silverware, etc.  They even had olive oil, pepper, salt, popcorn, coffee, and tea!! This was really nice since I was staying the week.  The bathroom was also stocked.

The bedroom was very cozy and comfortable.  I was able to unpack my things and make myself at home. 

The Seattle center could take up to 40 minutes to get to via bus, so keep that in mind if that's what you're planning.  I happened to be in the U-District every day and it was a beautiful ride using the Burke Gilman.  Also, a nice ride to Fremont. 

I would definitely return to her place again. "
2352218,38749389,2015-07-18,36481223,Hector,"We would like to thank Kay for the hospitality and for sharing her home with us. The MeadowBrook Retreat was a perfect fit for us , it had everything we needed for our stay in Seattle. We were very comfortable first off , the retreat is very close to downtown , we traveled maybe about 10 mins to get where we needed to. Kay , responded to our text messages , she would accomodate us with certain things( Iron and Ironing Board) we needed help with. Overall our trip was great , I would recommend the MeadowBrook Retreat for anyone visiting Seattle. Thanks Kay! "
2352218,39170860,2015-07-21,31242068,Justin,"My host was excellent. There maps, guides, recommendations, helpful notes, etc. The kitchen and bathroom were well-organized and the furniture was arranged nicely. The home was very inviting, private, and comfortable. Kay is an Air BnB pro. She does an excellent job with her place. "
2352218,39795263,2015-07-26,6980552,Lauren,"We had a great stay at Kay's Meadowbrook Retreat. After arriving in Seattle later than we had expected and wanting to make it to the baseball game on time, we were not able to check-in until after midnight. Kay was very accommodating to this, she made changes so that we could access the suite easier and even left some lights on both inside and outside of the retreat so we could find our way. We had very comfortable sleeps both nights and appreciated the welcome basket with tea and coffee in the mornings! The location was perfect and was an easy commute to downtown Seattle. We had a great stay and would definitely stay again! "
2352218,40959320,2015-08-03,9297227,Yiva,The instructions were straight forward and we had no problems getting in. The unit was cozy and had everything we needed. The neighborhood was nice and close to the beach and local pubs and restaurants.
2352218,41326980,2015-08-07,11578516,Briana,"The Meadowbrook Retreat was wonderful! Clean, spacious and well organized. We really appreciated the available kitchen supplies and thought that the basket of coffee, tea and popcorn upon our arrival was a nice touch. The basement was very quiet and we only occasionally heard footsteps (and paw steps from the cat) upstairs. Kay was a lovely host and promptly responded to all our questions and texts. Thanks again for letting us stay in your home!"
2352218,42143478,2015-08-11,13163347,Courtney,"We really enjoyed the place. It was clean, comfortable, cozy, very conveniently located to the various north Seattle neighborhoods and also quite close to the college as well as the city. We found it very easy to get in and out during our stay and parking was ample and the retreat was in a quiet, safe neighborhood. The bedroom was spacious and we slept great despite our 3 hour jet lag.

Kay was also very helpful. We're planning on moving to the area and she was kind enough to stop by and answer questions we had about Seattle as well as offer some suggestions and insights she had as a long time resident of the area. We really felt welcome!"
2352218,42863613,2015-08-16,22758779,Elizabeth,We enjoyed our stay here.  Everything was neat and in great order when we arrived.  We were very pleased with how well equipped the kitchen was - we even managed to bake some blackberry turnovers with the wild blackberries we gathered from the parks. 
2352218,44304254,2015-08-25,25495995,Sabrina,"We had a great time in Seattle and Kay was such a nice host. She welcomed us so warmly on our arrival and showed us around. The apartment looks exactly as seen on the pictures. Guests also have different options of using the garden. We had a nice talk and she was intrested and nothing but nice! 
The appartment is well equipped with everything you need during your stay. As it is a basement apartment you have to know that you might have to deal with several spiders. 
The neighborhood looks very beautiful and safe."
2955782,13370638,2014-05-26,4048149,Stephanie,"The apartment was exactly as shown; could not have asked for more! It was clean, well-appointed and just perfect for my trip! The location was ideal as I needed to be walking distance from the Space Needle (for work). You're also right in the hub of shopping and 3 blocks from Pike's Place. TONS of restaurants within walking distance as well. Could not have asked for more!

Jordan was an awesome host! He responded very quickly, left very clear instructions on checking in and out and was super friendly :) 

Will definitely rent again when I'm back in Seattle!"
2955782,13809026,2014-06-04,14880438,Anna,The reservation was canceled 11 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2955782,15761224,2014-07-15,7857391,Saccha,"My roommates and I were super impressed with the accommodations... I am already quite picky already, but when it came to comfort and convenience, my needs were met.. I mean, you can't find a better place that is in the CENTER OF EVERYTHING!! Jordan's apt is equipped with everything!!! And Jordan is a fantastic host... If you are considering every staying in Seattle, contact Jordan NOW! "
2955782,15969223,2014-07-19,15649408,Brad,"We had a great stay in this apartment. The location was great, it's right downtown and near the light rail station. Getting the key was a non issue, which is always nice with Airbnb stays. The apartment was clean and nicely furnished."
2955782,16202760,2014-07-23,10920075,Adonis,"If anything, the location of Jordan's condo is just about perfect for any visit to Seattle - middle of downtown, walking distance to Pike Place Market, only a quick monorail ride to the Space Needle and Seattle Center, and right next to the Westlake Station for the light rail to the airport, also a plus. 

Even then, the condo itself is great. It's clean, comfy and full of home amenities making it great for our 4 night stay - kitchen, television, wi-fi, etc., and I appreciated how Jordan provided clean towels, toiletries, blankets and an air bed. 

Jordan was also always easy to communicate with and quick to respond to any questions we had, making our stay even more comfortable and reassuring. If I'm ever in Seattle again I'd definitely look this place up again. Thanks for everything, Jordan! "
2955782,16332270,2014-07-25,18666060,Brooke,"Jordan has a beautiful place with a perfect location. My husband and I had so much fun being able to see everything we wanted within walking distance. Jordan had great, clear instructions on everything for us- making our first airbnb experience a breeze! We will definitely be back."
2955782,16462037,2014-07-28,15402080,Matt,Fantastic location.  Comfortable and clean place.  Good communication from the Host (Jordan).  I would stay there again without hesitation.
2955782,16636115,2014-07-30,1604986,Sara,"Absolutely perfect! Jordan's place was right in the heart of everything we wanted to do in Seattle. It was beautifully appointed, had everything we needed, was convenient, and overall had a wonderful experience. Would highly recommend staying here. We walked nearly everywhere- especially close to Pike Place and city landmarks!"
2955782,17172426,2014-08-08,12929482,Sabrina,"Jordan has a great apartment right in the heart of downtown Seattle! We loved staying there especially being so close to the Market and all the great restaurants. Jordan got right back to me with any questions I had during our stay, as well as giving us all the information we needed before we arrived. We had a great experience all around!"
2955782,17442224,2014-08-12,3627544,Melissa,"Jordan's place was perfect for us. It is centrally located to Pike's, shopping and restaurants. It's also 1 block from the bus to most popular downtown locations. The bed was super comfy as was the couch/futon bed. There are plenty of parking garage options in this area which is nice since we had a car. The entry way for the building is at the beginning of a small park, so there was some noise in the evening into the night, but that was easily solved with earplugs which I never leave home without. 

Communication with Jordan was seamless and the check-in/out process went off without a hitch. Overall a nice place to stay if you are buzzing around downtown."
2955782,17693103,2014-08-16,7613736,Melissa,"We were pretty stoked on Jordan's place. It's just a few blocks from Pike Place Market and a million other things. We walked to the Space Needle but we also took advantage of the monorail, the light rail, the bus and basically every other mode of transportation besides a car. Couldn't have asked for a better location and although you're smack dab in the middle of downtown, the building is very secure and feels very safe. The light rail from the airport drops you off a block away from the apartment and it was so easy to navigate. A+! If he'll have us back, that's where we're staying :)"
2955782,18610069,2014-08-28,17295567,Billy,"Jordan's apartment is beautiful and I had a great night experience staying there. The concierges were all very helpful, agreeing to look after my bags for a few hours after I checked out.

I was very happy with my stay here and would recommend it to anyone. This is the sort of Airbnb that provides hotel style luxury for much better value."
2955782,18873428,2014-09-02,15198046,Kacie,"Jordan's apartment could not have been in a better location!  Right in the heart of everything!  We were there for 6 days (without a car) so it was great to be able to walk anywhere we wanted to go, get groceries, make food at home, and even do a  load of laundry!  His place was comfortable and perfect!  I HIGHLY recommend, you absolutely cannot beat the location!"
2955782,19292196,2014-09-09,5299678,Vinay,Jordan's place was exactly as it appears in the pictures and a great place to set up as home base for a trip to Seattle. The balcony was great to get some air and the rooftop had a rockin' view of the downtown scene. Jordan was great about working with us given our Saturday plan to visit Mt. Rainer and let us have the keys early since we wouldn't be back in time to pick it up form the concierge. Even parking wasn't too bad in the nearby streets as Sunday is free and with the 8 am limits it got us out of bed and more time to enjoy the city. Jordan was quick to respond to my initial inquiries and I'd definitely try to stay here again the next time I visit Seattle. 
2955782,19419487,2014-09-12,16875162,Anh,"The location was great! Everything is within walking distance. However, with it being downtown, there were a lot of homeless people near and around the vicinity. The only drawback."
2955782,20112821,2014-09-23,2149956,Kitt,"Jordan's apartment is bright and clean and the entire interior of the building seemed brand new.  The door staff were engaging and helpful.  WiFi and facilities were very good.  Plenty of comfortable bedding.  Jordan had left us a nice note on arrival, and we left him one on departure as well.  The neighborhood reminded me of Union Square in NYC, and seemed to be the hub of transients in the core of Seattle.  With ping pong, chess and foosball tables all around, and a friendly city patrol presence, we found the park always busy and happy with music and smiles.  Perfect location for the Theatre District, the Public Market, the airport train and Monorail, branded store shopping, excellent restaurants, and the best museums.  Would gladly stay there again.  Good vibe."
2955782,20391735,2014-09-28,16266344,Malcolm,"Jordan's place was incredible, awesome location. Jordan was very easy to work with and his instructions were spot on. Would highly recommend to anyone who has plans on visiting Seattle..."
2955782,20781781,2014-10-05,21659870,Tonye,"This was my first experience with airbnb. I  arrived late and had a minor issue with access to the facility but other than that it was an overall great experience. The location was spot on and the apartment was nice, clean and well furnished. Jordan was very professional. Highly recommended."
2955782,20979851,2014-10-08,12061803,Ilona,"Jordan's place was absolutely incredible - set in the heart of Downtown, mere minutes from any Seattle attraction you can think of. We stayed there for two nights and never had to cab/uber anywhere. Moreover, the apartment is a block from the train station - such a breeze. The doorman/secure access to the building is another plus - we felt very safe at all times. The unit itself is gorgeous, very quiet and luxurious. Aside from hearing one neighbor open his door once, there was absolutely no other noise, which is incredible given that the building is in the middle of hustle and bustle. I think it's a perfect place to stay if you want to enjoy Downtown as there are numerous restaurants and bars right outside the door, not to mention Pike Place Market and amazing shopping. Oh, and do go to the deck on the top floor - the view is breathtaking! 

Jordan is an incredible host - he was very accommodating and answered all questions within five minutes via email. We couldn't have asked for a more enjoyable stay or a better host! "
2955782,21114010,2014-10-11,22045230,Vinh,"Nice apartment with great access to high end shopping, restaurants, bars, and a short walk to pikes market. Apartment looks exactly like the photos. Make sure to bring your own toiletries (shampoo, toothpaste, etc) as they're not provided. I would recommend to not bring a car as only pay to park options exist. There are several metro stops very close to the location. Also, this area had a lot of homeless people if that makes a difference. Overall great air bnb spot!"
2955782,21759502,2014-10-23,2872483,Ingeborg,"Eine super und saubere Wohnung mit guten Matratzen und genug Küchengeschirr zum Kochen. Die Wohnlage ist einmalig. Wenn man sich an Obdachlose stört, nun ja, die sind viel in der Gegend. Uns hat es nichts ausgemacht, es ist nur traurig. Alle Touristenattraktionen sind innerhalb von Minuten zu Fuss zu erreichen. Ein Auto braucht man nicht. Vom Flughafen nimmt man die Light Rail ($2.75) und die Endstation ist nur ca. 3-5 Minuten von der Wohnung entfernt. Besser kann es nicht sein. Das gleiche mit der Metro, welche zur Space Needle fährt. 
A super and clean condo. The bed and the pullout sleeping sofa were comfortable to sleep on. The shower has nice pressure and quick hot water. Plenty of towels, bedding, pillows, hangers. I loved the gas stove. Jordan provides enough pots, pants, silverware, dishes, so that one can cook meals. Our first task was grocery shopping, a terrific food store was approx. 5 minutes away. We ate breakfast every day at home. Jordan's home could not be in a better location. Everything is minutes walking time away. If you want to get to the Space Needle, take the Metro, the station is a block away and the Metro ride took about 5 minutes. All other tourist attractions, we walked to....ferry building, the big wheel, stunning library, famous Seattle Underground, Pike Market where they throw the fish......all only minutes away.  And if you like to spend money on clothes or shoes, all well known stores are right there.  If you have time, go and see a theater show.   Thank you Jordan for offering your home as an Airbnb. "
2955782,22118790,2014-10-30,3238447,Gayle,"Location could not be more perfect- just a few blocks from the market, a stone's throw to the Monorail and Seattle Center, and close to the convention center.  The condo was exactly as pictured and listed.  It was very nicely furnished and amply stocked.  Having a washer and drier in the unit is fantastic, especially traveling with kids."
2955782,22154779,2014-10-31,259158,Marc,Jordan has a really ideal place for visiting downtown Seattle. Perfect for a business trip! Apartment was clean and amenities worked great
2955782,22276159,2014-11-02,18955798,Jen,"The condo was so nice! Jordan was very helpful with all of our needs. He text me to check on us throughout the trip. The space had everything we needed, plenty of clean towels and sheets. It was also very clean. And quiet, You could not hear any noise from the neighbor
. We were right in the middle of downtown, close to all shopping, food, bars, dancing. We will defiantly come here next time in Seattle!

2955782,23685448,2014-12-08,3441090,Catherine,Unbeatable location. Clean and modern apartment. We would definitely stay again!
2955782,24501424,2014-12-29,4176836,Doug,"Location is awesome to explore downtown, pike place and belltown. The unit is a little barebones, but in nice shape. No view, but you won't be there much anyways. Very secure building. Host was very responsive to sheets that were missing the first night, and in general was very responsive in all communications."
2955782,24789454,2015-01-02,20588922,Yvonne,"Fantastic location, just a couple blocks away from Pike's Place. Very central so you can take the light rail from the airport and get off the last stop to walk there. The apartment was comfortable and most importantly- clean! Jordan was very quick with his responses, I was able to get a text from him within 10 minutes! We really enjoyed our stay."
2955782,26065190,2015-02-02,1160919,Eran,"What an incredible place. Location, Location, Location!!! The apartment is very cool and hip. Great decor and a kitchen you'd love to cook in - while enjoying company. Very comfortable bed to rest in after a day in the city. I would love to come back. Jordan is a great host and responded immediately! Thanks Jordan."
2955782,26375344,2015-02-10,2631065,John,"Jordan's apartment was great - very clean and modern. It's right across the street from the Westlake Station, so getting to his place from the airport was a breeze. Checking in/out was super smooth and the concierge was wonderful.

I would definitely stay recommend staying at Jordan's."
2955782,27941424,2015-03-15,1160919,Eran,"This is the second time I stay at Jordan's place. Love this place. As always go  to my favorite restaurants and coffee shops. All within walking distance. Great place to stay.
Thank Jordan.

Check-in was easy and the condo was the perfect home away from home! If I'm ever in the city again, I'll definitely be returning here! "
2955782,28539476,2015-03-25,29317983,Linda,"An amazing location!! We felt entirely comfortable in this apartment, and we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. It was convenient to be able to cook our own crab Newberg with ingredients straight from Pike Place Market. The apartment was spacious, and we felt welcome."
2955782,28694201,2015-03-29,6635622,Catalina,Jordan was a great host - he kept in touch throughout the visit to make sure my stay was perfect. The apartment is well-described and perfectly situated 2 blocks from Pike Market. 
2955782,29170834,2015-04-05,3058126,Nicole,"My coworker and I stayed at Jordan's apartment for a conference we attended and had a great experience.  The location is literally in the middle of everything and very walkable.  We easily walked to the fish market, light rail stop, monorail to the space needle area, and many other local destinations.  The apartment was modern, comfortable, and clean.  It was handy to have a full kitchen and washer/dryer in the apartment.  Jordan was responsive and helpful such as accommodating our late arrival plans and adding another night at the last minute.  The concierge at the front desk was also helpful in directing us to the nearest grocery, etc."
2955782,30282898,2015-04-20,26655572,Susan,"As first timers in Seattle, this place was perfect! It's close to all the great restaurants and Pikes Place. The apartment was spacious, clean, and very comfortable. We would definitely come back for our next visit"
2955782,30929279,2015-04-29,8238590,Danielle,"Location could not be better. A few blocks from the Seattle Convention Center and Capitol Hill neighborhood. The space was basic with nice appliances, and had most of the things we needed. In-unit laundry and iron were much appreciated (great for wrinkled suits after traveling). Bring a hair dryer if you need one. Mattress was very soft and I happen to prefer firm, but my partner though it was comfortable. Overall it was very convenient for our conference and our host was incredibly responsive!"
2955782,31640634,2015-05-08,2218433,Michael,"Jordan was very accomodating with easy, fast communications and handling my needs (late arrival) effectively. The apartment is awesome! Clean, spacious, comfortable and modern. Nice balcony too. Ideal location in downtown/central Seattle - could not imagine a better spot. Will absolutely stay here anytime I return to Seattle. Thanks Jordan!"
2955782,32460518,2015-05-18,8938500,Marybeth,Key pick-up was easy.  Jordan responded immediately to every question we had during our stay!!  And there was coffee!!!
2955782,33266520,2015-05-26,29473686,Gasper,"Jordan did a great job of coordinating the key hand off with his help on our arrival.  Condo was clean and comfortable, gave us room to stretch out and the location was beyond convenient.  Made great use of the K-Cup machine. A Viking Stove, I always wanted one made me wish we had cooked more.  If we are ever in town again this is the first place we will try to stay.  "
2955782,33908048,2015-06-02,5633241,Mohsin,"Jordan's is a wonderfully spacious and perfectly located apartment, in a well maintained and safe building. I stayed with a few friends for five days and am leaving with lovely memories. Would definitely recommend it to anyone!"
2955782,34636056,2015-06-10,26325716,Aric,"Jordan's place was exactly as advertised and a perfect fit for our family (me+wife+3.5 year old).  While only a 1 bedroom, the spacious living room provided the needed roominess for our family.  His apartment is well situated in downtown with easy access to all the wonderful attractions in Seattle.  We had a wonderful time and can't wait to come back!"
2955782,36192757,2015-06-26,32986479,Sunny,"I couldn't imagine a more perfect accommodation in the heart of Seattle!  The apartment was immaculate, very modern and Jordan's hospitality was wonderful!  We were greeted warmly and answers to our questions were seconds away!  We will DEFINITELY stay at Jordan's again!"
2955782,36369696,2015-06-28,10978288,Brannon,Jordan made our stay hella easy. The place is in a prime spot. Everything is walking distance. I would definitely recommend this unit to anyone visiting Seattle. 
2955782,36888067,2015-07-02,34881368,Scott,Jordan's place was super easy to get to from the light rail and was conveniently located to all the things we wanted to do.  Michelle made the Check-in and key transfer a smooth process and was there to provide her foodie wisdom :)  I highly recommend Jordan's place and will be sure to visit again!
2955782,37257459,2015-07-05,29538272,Jon,Jordon was super easy to deal with.  He responded to any questions in minutes which was really nice.  The place was beautiful inside and had things like coffee and sugar and cream.  Its equipped with super nice appliances and obviously has been remodeled and it was nice to have a washer and dryer.  The location is amazing as he is just a few minutes walk to the Pike market.  Its in a historic building which is very cool and it has security.  Stay here!
2955782,37796769,2015-07-10,35924608,Jim,"Fantastic city location.  3 blocks from the Pike's place farmer's market, which is across the street from the original Starbuck's as well as a terrific french bakery.  Also across the street from the Westlake Mall and the monorail to the Seattle Center where the Space Needle is located among many other interesting museums.  Just outside the door there is a small urban park with a sensational stylized water feature, ping pong tables, as well as very tasteful and interesting entertainment.  There are terrific restaurants very close by offering all types of very good food.  A terrific condo safely in the middle of all the city has to offer.   "
2955782,38099651,2015-07-13,4805135,Emily,This location is simply amazing! I would highly recommend Jordan's place to anyone visiting Seattle. We had an amazing weekend and would gladly stay here again when visiting Seattle next time. 
2955782,39154136,2015-07-21,31022049,Carole,Jordan was a great host. Responded very quickly to any questions. Location of the condo was the Best to see Seattle. Quick access to public transportation and also to airport. 
2955782,39428582,2015-07-23,37786842,Michael,"This location is AWESOME! You cant beat it, and you wont find prices better. We originally had a hotel booked for almost twice the cost we paid plus half the amenities.  The place has everything you need and is super close to the super market and pikes market.  Building is very secure with a friendly door staff. Easy to check in and easy owner to work with. Would definitely book again.  "
2955782,40364592,2015-07-30,7467848,Jim,"Jordan's apartment is the perfect place to call home during a visit to Seattle.  The apartment is as described (clean, modern, well appointed) and the location couldn't be better.  The building is also very secure.  Being across the street from the Westlake transit station made getting to and from Safeco Field for a Mariners Game a breeze.  The building is adjacent to Westlake Park which has been outfitted with tons of games (ping pong, shuffle board, foosball, bean bag toss, etc) so the boys had a great time there while we got coffee at the Starbucks across the street.  Not sure if that's just a summertime thing but it was great.  Jordan was an excellent host.  I would definitely stay here again."
2955782,40911348,2015-08-03,9011449,Rick,"Listing description is accurate. Jordan's assistant, Michelle, made everything go smoothly from getting us the key on arrival to letting us check out late for a late flight home. The location is about as good as it gets........a few blocks from Pike's Place Market, great restaurants, the water taxi to West Seattle, Monorail to the Space Needle, in short, a terrific downtown location. On arrival at SeaTac airport we walked to the Light Rail and took to the last stop at Westlake station which is conveniently located across the street from Jordan's digs which made our arrival and departure easy, easy, easy. The A/C works like a charm if you need it; the Wolf stove, refrigerator, makes the small kitchen a big plus; free coffee and a Keurig coffee maker is available; a great place to stay. We'll be back."
2955782,41212098,2015-08-05,28805083,Stephanie,"Wow what a great place! Jordan was prompt and responsive during scheduling. The location was absolutely prime, you can't ask for anything better."
2955782,41730621,2015-08-09,11036100,Ray,"This is the nicest Air B&B unit we've stayed in. The place is really nice and the location is unbeatable, right at Westlake Park, within a couple blocks of EVERYTHING in downtown Seattle except Pioneer Square, and that's an easy walk. The kitchen is incredible, the bathroom is nice, the bed and furniture are comfortable, and there's plenty of room for guests to store their stuff.  And Michelle couldn't have been easier to work with

I'd frankly be happy to live here... We'll try to book this place again when we're next in Seattle. And a couple of local friends stopped in for a quick visit and asked for the listing to recommend to other visitors..."
2955782,42412968,2015-08-13,16402893,Brian,"Jordan's place was exactly as described and perfect for what I needed. It was located very close to to everything, including the conference centre where I was attending a conference. The place was clean, the bed was comfortable, and the kitchen was really nice. Michelle, who let me in to the place, was lovely and helpful.  "
2955782,42760305,2015-08-15,13646102,Ellen,"Jordan's place is great!  In the heart of Seattle, walking distance to everything.  His apartment is really nice, we loved coming home after a day exploring to cook dinner and relax there.  Grocery store is a block away.  "
2955782,43371927,2015-08-19,28821918,Mary,"The plusses:  the location is absolutely superb, the building is secure and the apartment is spotless.  There is a full kitchen and washer and dyer.  Check-in is simple, and Jordan gives you contact information in advance.  What could be better:  the furnishings, while functional, are sparse.  The TV only receives CNN, Fox, some sports channels  - no local network TV.  3 of us had plenty of room to sleep, although despite instructions, we couldn't figure out how to work  the double pull out couch.  Other than the kitchen counter and a roller TV cart, there was no place to eat a meal.  Overall, we felt as though we were staying in a wonderfully located bachelor pad.  With all the fees in addition to the price, a decent hotel room is likely in the same price range.   All in all, we  enjoyed our stay including the  location and ease of this apartment, but wish our host would update to provide a few more comforts."
2955782,44403125,2015-08-26,27384076,Nicole,"Jordan's place is awesome. This was our first stay using Airbnb. The location is ideal, being centered in the middle of downtown just four short blocks from Pike Market. Jordan was extremely responsive and the exchange of keys with Michelle was seamless. She also made wonderful recommendations for restaurants. If I'm ever in Seattle again, we will definitely look to stay at Jordan's place. "
2955782,44884504,2015-08-30,28468317,Stephanie,We were met by Jordan's assistant who was very helpful.  Location perfect for all city attractions.  Description accurate. Thanks for a great stay Stephanie 
2955782,45763882,2015-09-06,5604215,James,"What a great place to stay in Seattle! Jordan's apartment is very clean, spacious, quiet, well-stocked, and has a comfortable bed. And what a location! We couldn't have asked for a better place to launch our explorations of the many interesting neighborhoods and sights of Seattle. The apartment is a quick walk to many excellent restaurants and Pike Place Market. Within a block are bus stops, a light rail station, the monorail, and streets with designated bike lanes. Jordan and Michelle made the check-in and check-out process super easy and convenient, and they responded quickly to questions. We are very pleased with our experience renting this apartment!"
2955782,47743658,2015-09-21,34144466,Olivia,"Had a great time in Seattle. Jordan's place a few blocks from Pike place and still close enough to walk to major attractions. Communication with both Jordan and Michelle was easy and they responded very quick to any inquiries. The apartment was very clean, neat and had just about everything we needed. I would recommend staying here."
2955782,48236380,2015-09-24,34698949,Giancarlo,"This place is a MUST if you're going to Seattle. Prime location, right downtown just blocks away from Pike Place Market. Clean and tidy private apartment, incredibly spacious. Everything was as described by the hosts. Will definitely stay here again."
2955782,50446568,2015-10-12,11211664,Emily,"Fantastic location, and close to everything. 

Lots of little perks like snacks, cream, and coffee was very much appreciated!"
2955782,51016049,2015-10-17,1720,Ryan,"What a beautiful place in an absolutely perfect location. My wife and I stayed here for a week while I was at a meeting at the convention center. It's a short walk (3 blocks) to the convention center and 3 blocks to Pike Place Market. The apartment was clean, safe, and comfortable. The concierge was a nice ""safety net"" and was always very pleasant. Highly recommend."
2955782,51647267,2015-10-22,45901984,Tracy,"Jordan's place at the Seaboard building was great! It was clean, organized, comfortable, and a FANTASTIC location. It was super easy to walk to a lot of major sites, and most other areas were a short uber trip away. The apartment was nice and spacious, with everything you might need, and the bed was comfortable, there was really nothing missing. It was also a nice bonus that not only was there cable (Directv), but also Netflix, Hulu, etc. available on the tv. I would absolutely stay here again and highly recommend. "
2955782,51930546,2015-10-25,8336410,Megan,"Apartment is in a great location--very easy to walk to many sites around town.  Apartment was clean and spacious, and we enjoyed watching a free movie through the cable service.  Jordan was quick to respond to my questions."
2955782,52926852,2015-11-02,46722816,Kim,"This Apartment locates at the best place in town. Pike Market and Pioneer Square are both within 15 minutes walk distance. It's tidy and clean with every function you may need. We got the keys at the front desk which servers most time in a day, that could allow you to check in at anytime fit for your schedule. Thanks for the host to let us enjoy two great nights here."
2955782,53603251,2015-11-10,44185795,Jennifer,This downtown condo was perfect for my husband and me! We walked everywhere. The front desk people we were great. The condo was clean and had all the comforts of home. We will definately stay there again.
2955782,54149048,2015-11-16,30018754,Janelle,Had the pleasure of staying at this lovely accommodation. Excellent locations and spotless apartment! We throughly enjoyed our stay and Jordan was very attentive to all our needs. Excellent communication and such beautiful  place! Absolutely loved the kitchen!! Thank you again for making our Seattle trip so memorable! 
2955782,54488647,2015-11-20,21454105,Bernie,"Great apartment, located perfectly for business or leisure travel. Central downtown location is great for shopping, theaters, and business. Transit connections and Uber availability are great - no need for a car!
Will definitely stay there again when I need to be in downtown Seattle. "
2955782,54795318,2015-11-23,25117480,Victoria,"We had a fantastic stay! The location could not have been better; the apartment was only 2 blocks from Pike Place Market, so it was walking distance to Belltown and the International District and an easy bus ride virtually everyplace else.
The beds were comfortable, the apartment was clean, and communication with the host was very easy.
I highly recommend! "
2955782,55184317,2015-11-29,1485537,Cody,"My wife and I loved Jordan's place. The location was great for anyone wanting to explore downtown on foot. The apartment is in a quiet, secure building. I was really shocked at how quiet it was. The apartment was very clean and Jordan left some tea and coffee for us to use. I'd easily stay here again."
2955782,56546103,2015-12-14,49859052,Warren,"Beautiful room in the most ideal part of downtown. Only a few blocks to Pike market and one block from the Linc train to the airport. The apartment was well furnished, most items seemed new or barely used. Facilities were well maintained and the fully stocked kitchen had almost anything you could want if you chose to cook. Nice touch to add coffee and tea. Plus, had some beautiful candles brining when I arrived!"
2955782,56877143,2015-12-19,21385768,Bradlee,"Absolutely amazing location - hoping it doesn't become too popular as I certainly plan on returning this year. It's cozy, but spacious. The ability to cook your own food and wash your clothes, alone, was priceless.

Jordan was personable, accommodating and more than flexible to my ever changing schedule. By far one of my best stays in Seattle!"
2955782,58019391,2015-12-31,49980,Victoria,"Excellent stay at Jordan's apartment. Perfect location for going around Seattle without a car--- Westlake Station is just a block away (Link to/from airport, Monorail for Seattle Center, as well as buses), and numerous bus stops and the streetcar to Lake Union are within a few minutes' walk. For food, Pikes Place Market and a Kress supermarket are just a couple of blocks down. The apartment is also within blocks of wonderful high end shopping, as well as a Target and a Walgreen's for more common needs.
Having a kitchen allowed our family of three to occasionally make meals when we decided not to eat out, and a full size washer and dryer in the apartment was a major plus. We comfortably slept in the queen-size bed, while our child used the sofa. The apartment was clean when we came in, and great communication with Jordan and his assistant Michelle throughout the whole process. This is the apartment to stay at, if one were to visit Seattle!"
1356339,7404208,2013-09-18,2025358,Ashley,"Apartment was great! It was modern, clean, and in a great location! It was about a 20 minute walk right to pike place market in the heart of Seattle. Will definitely be staying here every time I go back to Seattle."
1356339,7494494,2013-09-22,3561311,Elisha,"My best friend and I had a fabulous time staying in this unit. Autumn is such a sweetheart and very attentive from answering questions through emails, returning calls, escorting us to the apartment and she even conveniently lives in the same building. The neighborhood is awesome. Capitol Hill has to be one of the best neighborhoods Seattle has to offer. The  location, the property manager Autumn and even the unit itself..... Was just absolutely amazing. Overall it was a fabulous place to stay. I highly recommend booking this property as well as others Autumn has to offer."
1356339,7695262,2013-09-30,6182867,Joanna,"I had a wonderful experience staying in Autumn's beautiful apartment in Capitol Hill. It is in a great location, within walking distance to downtown and a lot of fun bars and restaurants. The apartment was gorgeous and maintained very well, an extremely comfortable place to stay! "
1356339,8267138,2013-10-22,388693,Pauline,"Autumn was very friendly and responsive throughout. The listing was very comfortable and very well located! It's close to many bars and restaurants on Broadway and on Olive. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Thank you, Autumn! "
1356339,8500583,2013-11-03,334973,Eddie,"had a wonderful first time stay in seattle. you really cant do better with this location whether you want to walk the broadway, pike/pine strip and anywhere downtown or drive. we rented a car for day trips and parking was a bit of a challenge but never more than 4 blocks away. the area is safe that i never had a second thought.

the flat easily accommodates 2-4 and we had no trouble with noise, smells, etc. the living area is spacious and it was nice to have separate eating space / chill out space that you certainly dont find in a hotel. the kitchen has most any utensil needed and a spice rack! no more stealing salt or sugar packets! :)

the space is really ideal for those who want to venture into the city and have a real homebase to return to. 

autumn provided us with a 2nd key to the bldg midway thru our visit which was really appreciated. her tips on local dives, bars and sights (watertower!) were spot on. i will definitely be back!"
1356339,8833261,2013-11-20,3682060,Nicole And Jamie,"This is a great apartment tucked into the Capitol Hill neighbourhood, close to lots of great coffee and restaurants.  The apartment was safe, easy to find, and Autumn was really great for our unpredictable check in.  We chose to have a parking spot and it worked out perfectly.  The apartment was just as described; spacious and clean with great amenities, and a fantastic view. I would recommend this apartment to anyone."
1356339,9139479,2013-12-09,2675119,Valerie,"My husband and i recently stayed here. This is great apartment in Capitol Hill. You really can't do better with this apartment -- Very clean, modern and centrally located (close walk to Broadway, melrose market and all the touristy spots by car). We rented a car during our stay here, parking was a bit of a challenge -- never no more than 4 blocks away. And, if you follow Anthony Bourdain's shows a neighborhood bar, Sun Liquor, that he recommends is right down the street, as well as, Tops Pots doughnuts  :) Autumn is also a great host, very helpful and accommodating. "
1356339,9244273,2013-12-16,651331,Chris,"Super nice condo! Location is central to everything. Autumn was a great communicator.

Couldn't be better if you're looking to stay in the Capitol Hill area!"
1356339,9764077,2014-01-08,10365742,Camilo,"Great location, beautiful space and decoration, excellent neighbourhood, what else could you need?"
1356339,10211793,2014-02-06,2446528,Darren,The place was exactly as advertised and Autumn did a great job of check in and check out. I highly recommend. 
1356339,10361199,2014-02-16,2034264,Lara And Chad,"424 summit was a lovely place to call home. my husband, two-year-old toddler and i stayed for a week and we found the place to be quite comfortable. i specifically chose the unit because it appeared clean and uncluttered, and for the large bed and comfortable linens. i was pleased to find that all of the pictures are true to life! the location is wonderful - extremely convenient and enjoyable. 

we arrived during a cold spell and found that the baseboard heat in the bedroom wasn't functioning properly. autumn quickly addressed the issue and had a repair man replace the unit within 24-hours. impressive! furthermore, we found that the room stayed plenty warm with only heat from the living room, so it was no inconvenience, whatsoever.

the unit also had toddler-friendly aspects: plastic utensils, plates, cups and a high-chair, as well. it was a real treat for him to feel like he had some things that were special for him.

the unit is managed like a traditionally-managed vacation rental (i showed my drivers license and signed a form when we checked in, we had house manual emailed to us the week prior, etc.). no complaint, i only mention it because it just feels less ""airbnb-like"" to me, compared to other experiences.

i would and will absolutely stay here again when we come to visit seattle!"
1356339,10472440,2014-02-20,1348696,Amy,The apartment was everything we imagined and more! The bed and linens were so comfy; I swear we felt like we were at the W. Would definitely stay with Autumn again.  Check in and check out was a breeze as well.
1356339,10737346,2014-03-05,7371056,Ryan,"Really great apartment, and Autumn was in good contact the whole time--from planning our stay to departure. We'll definitely come here again next time we're in Seattle. Especially loved having a kitchen so we could have a couple nights in and make use of the Pike Place Market, QFC, etc. "
1356339,10969655,2014-03-15,9703150,Tyler,"Amazing again.  That's like 6 out of 6 times now or something.  Autumn and Melissa even left me a wonderful $20 gift card to Top Pot Donuts for being such a good customer.   Also, I accidentally had someone park in a space i thought was open and left with my friend to go see a movie, which happened to be another persons parking spot.  Totally my goof, and Autumn went above and beyond to help me rectify the situation.  The customer service is just fantastic."
1356339,11124610,2014-03-22,4680755,Samuel,"ideal location (just one short block from Top Pot Doughnuts too), all modern conveniences, friendly and helpful host, super comfortable bed. generous 'gift' of a bottle of wine and some cookies was a real treat (not that I drank the wine).  small hiccup with the shower on the first day, but was quickly resolved by Autumn.  although the $25 fee for being ""checked in out of hours"" was unnecessary given that all the information was provided within the apartment.  not prohibitive, but perhaps just emailing or texting the door codes and leaving keys in a key safe (like many other airbnb'ers do) would be a better solution to the $25 fee.

would most definitely stay here again myself and would recommend to others when visiting Seattle"
1356339,11368611,2014-03-31,7181514,Nicole,We had an excellent stay at Autumn's apartment in Capitol Hill. It was clean and in such a great location. It was perfect for exploring the neighborhood and easily accessing all of the Seattle attractions. Autumn was wonderful and extremely responsive while we worked out arrival plans. I highly recommend staying here and would definitely do so again!
1356339,11591120,2014-04-08,3829212,Aibo,"The place is very clean and the location is perfect. I'm glad I didn't book a room with any hotel while staying in Seattle. I'd definitely choose this place again for my next trip to Seattle. The whole experience is wonderful. Besides, Autumn is very friendly. :D"
1356339,12844442,2014-05-12,390844,Leigh,Autumn's place was amazing and she was so nice pointing out some great neighborhood places when I arrived. I'll definitely be staying again the next time I'm in Seattle. 
1356339,13895051,2014-06-07,12587758,Luke,Great apartment in a great location! Very nicely furnished/decorated and well provisioned. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.
1356339,14625621,2014-06-23,1140193,Adrian,Autumn's apartment was great. It was close to everything and had everything we needed. Even camping utensils. The only negative was that there was construction next door that starts at 7am during the weekday.
1356339,16073249,2014-07-22,9016856,Matt,"The apartment and location were great. Everything was accurate in the listing and we were met at the correct time for check in. We loved the included A/C unit and ceiling fan as it was very hot during part of our stay.  And the bed was very comfortable. Only problem was the massive construction project next door, right outside our bedroom window. We know there is not anything host can do about construction, but it would have been nice to know ahead of time, so we could at least get some good earplugs.  Also, the hot water in the shower was a little inconsistent, and the TV remotes were not always effective. But overall, a great place to stay. "
1356339,16538361,2014-07-29,10364253,Lauren,"This place was great! The host is so organized and everything was set up and ready to go! Everything was so easy, including the keypad entry. We had four people stay in the apartment, two on the pullout and one in the bedroom. The pullout was very comfortable. The apartment was spacious and the kitchen was filled with everything we needed. When I originally spoke with the host, I thought we had reserved a space with a balcony and when we arrived with had a different unit. Turns out, we weren't in the apartment often (doing so much sightseeing!) that it didn't really matter. The bathroom was small but had everything we needed. 

Most importantly, the place is centrally located. We were able to walk to all great Cap Hill areas, great restaurants nearby (for breakfast, check out Glos! right down the street!), there was a convenience store a block away, and we could walk to the space needle and down to the water as well (longer walk). 

Our trip to Seattle was a dream...we had such a wonderful time and this place made it easy to achieve all of our to-do list while we were there.

Thank you!"
1356339,18627733,2014-08-29,17945339,Lewis,The place was really clean and had everything we needed. Really no problem at all. Would definitely re-use when the time comes.
1356339,18980398,2014-09-04,5525239,Zyanya,Apartment was perfect! Thank you very much!
1356339,19590252,2014-09-15,15886244,John,Host Autumn provided a wonderful welcome with plenty of helpful tips re local area facilities and highlights along with Seattle tourism suggestions. The apt. was well presented with quality fittings/furnishings and in a prime location. Thoroughly recommend for a comfortable stay. 
1356339,20142599,2014-09-24,19133070,Thor,"Autumn was very nice and friendly and the apt was very nice. She moved us to an apt on the other side of the bld. due to construction next door and it helped, but you don't want to stay and hang out all day, the banging will get to you. This is the first time I have used Airbnb and it was a nice change from hotels, the only thing I missed was an elevator. We had one issue while we were there, but Autumn resolved it quickly. The location is great, lots of places close in walking distance. If you have a car, I highly recommend purchasing the parking, There is a fair amount of construction going on in the neighborhood, so street parking is limited."
1356339,20329349,2014-09-28,3330076,Sondr,Fantastic! Autumn was really on top of things and made sure she was totally accessible if we had any questions. The bottle of wine was a nice touch! Great neighborhood convenient to all sorts of great food and adventures on foot. Nice modern kitchen made feasts with goodies from Pike Place Market really fun to prepare. Highly recommended. 
1356339,21342526,2014-10-15,20702325,Katarzyna,"Autumn's apartment is very cozy, nice and clean. King size bed was so much comfy! Very nice location. Capitol Hill is one of the best place how to get to downtown. Take bus number 8 and you will be in 10 minutes near Space Needle.  "
1356339,22425329,2014-11-06,7512123,Steve,"We had a great stay here, the apartment was spotlessly clean and had everything you could need. The unit is centrally located in a beautiful neighborhood . The unit has an optional parking space which is a major convenience in this neighborhood. We will defiantly stay here again. "
1356339,22703933,2014-11-12,6715205,Hoan,The condo was very clean and modern and it accommodated us well. It was close to everything we wanted to do in Seattle.  You have a nice view of the Space needle. We enjoy the spacious king size bed but be careful if you have more than 2 guess.  The pull out sofa was not the most confortable mattress to sleep on. Overall it was a great place to stay.
1356339,23220626,2014-11-25,23490523,David,"Autumn was a great host, very responsive when I had questions or needed help. Her associate Matthew gave us a warm welcome to the apartment, which was spotless and beautiful. Even though it had one bedroom, three of us slept here comfortably with the foldout bed in the living room.

The neighborhood is ideal: leafy and charming, and very quiet at night. But it's also just a few blocks to Broadway in Capitol Hill, which was full of great restaurants and cafes. This apartment is a great base for anyone visiting Seattle. I would definitely stay here again."
1356339,23779292,2014-12-09,24503487,Art,"Autumn was very welcoming when she met us at her Airbnb listing. She made sure to meet us and explain every detail about getting in and getting situated into the apartment. The place is newly renovated and looks amazing! Everything is clean and well organized. I felt like we were in an extremely fancy hotel. The room has a great king size bed and the pull out sofa is comfortable as well. Extra towels, soap, shampoo, conditioner and bedding linens are included. Another welcome addition is the bottle of wine on ice! Any questions I had were quickly answered by Autumn via text message. This listing is close to plenty of restaurants, coffee shops, grocery stores and bars. It's about three blocks from Broadway in Capitol Hill where there are many things to do. Two short blocks from Top Pot donuts and coffee. The other direction hosts Analog coffee shop.... amazing! The neighborhood is charming. I would definitely recommend this to anybody looking to stay in Seattle. On my next visit to Seattle I will look into this listing before any other."
1356339,25218697,2015-01-09,3697460,Dona,Cristi was wonderful! She welcomed us into the apartment and told us about the most amazing spots in Capitol Hill. Our unit had a great view of downtown and the space needle. Everything in the apartment was very clean and comfortable! We stayed in for a night and were able to cook a delicious dinner! The bottle of wine left for us was also delicious :) this was a last minute reservation and they accommodated our early check in also! Thanks autumn and cristi! 
1356339,25292207,2015-01-11,3751164,Su-Feh,"Christi met us at the apartment with great cheer and made us feel very welcome. She gave us lots of good information about the neighbourhood. The chilled bottle of wine waiting for us was a lovely touch. The apartment is as it looks in the pictures. Very beautifully furnished, very clean, very comfortable. We were there with our two teenage sons - despite the snug fit in the living room (we brought an extra blow-up mattress and sleeping bag because the boys would not have been comfortable sharing a pull-out sofa!), we managed to be comfortable. The master bedroom is far enough from the living room that adults could have a bit of privacy. The neighbourhood is wonderful. Lots of cool restaurants, bars, boutiques, cafes. A doughnut shop!!!!  Though the kitchen was very well-equipped and made me wish we could have stayed longer to cook something more substantial than breakfast!"
1356339,25668357,2015-01-22,26081102,Paige,"Staying at this airbnb in Capitol Hill was a pleasure! Autumn and her assistant was very accommodating and met me later that originally planned. The house was perfect- central to everything, clean, and had an amazing view of the space needle and Seattle sky line. I didn't want to leave! When I come back to Seattle I definitely want to stay in this apartment!"
1356339,26979006,2015-02-23,997691,Debra,The communication with Autumn about the apartment before and after our arrival was very timely and accurate.  Autumn is a very friendly hostess who will provide you with whatever information you may need about the area.  The apartment is open and bright and has a balcony with a really nice view.  It has been thoughtfully furnished and has everything necessary to prepare meals.  Upon arrival the apartment was ready for us and very clean.  We love the Capital Hill neighborhood because of its proximity to numerous great restaurants and entertainment venues.  There is a small market and wonderful coffee shop just a couple blocks from the apartment and a large full service market just a few blocks up the hill.  It is a very walkable area to parks and downtown.  We just park our car and walk every where.
1356339,27890957,2015-03-14,21401883,Sven,"Autumn could not have been more helpful. We agreed on a check-in time that was convenient for me. When we met, she talked me quickly through the few things I needed to know about the apartment and also told me about amenities and highlights nearby. The place is gorgeous (exactly as in the pictures), and the location is amazing."
1356339,28602975,2015-03-27,5805346,Karen,"With all our traveling along the west coast via Air Bnb, this place was the best! Even though the other were really, really good, this unit just had a real good feel and flow in how it worked.  It felt like a place where somebody really lived in.
Autumn was fantastic where communicating with her was so easy,  and she also exudes enthusiasm that you know she loves hostessing. Also was willing to give advice etc on what, where to go. Nice.
"
1356339,29543757,2015-04-09,11277939,Hannah,"We had a lovely visit staying at this apartment. Cristi, Autumn's associate, checked us in and provided lots of guidance to what was in the neighborhood. "
1356339,29826909,2015-04-13,25709658,Deanna,"ABOUT THE UNIT:  The unit and neighborhood is precisely as the pictures show and description says.  The unit is clean and in new/great condition.  There is a cleaner that comes in prior to check in.  Linens and towels are turned over after each guest + hotel-esque soap and set up is ready for you.   There is a bottle of wine, 2 sets of house keys and a Welcome binder that is in the kitchen for you.  Talk about welcoming, thorough and professional!   Contents include: welcome note, unit features (heater, appliance info, neighborhood information, transportation information).   I couldn't be more pleased.  The neighborhood is charming.  The building is an older one and this unit is a new reno project.  I stayed here for the long weekend and it was perfect for exploring Seattle and feeling part of the friendly, hip, historic, and vibrant Seattle community. 

ABOUT AUTUMN:  She is the best!  Professional.  Welcoming.  Efficient.  Accommodating.  Communicative.  Sweet.  The booking process is seamless.  Reminders are sent via email.  Communication method is your preference: air bnb message, email, call, and text.  I prefer text and Autumn provided expedient, clear, and friendly hospitality.  I honestly felt like I was visiting a friend once my plane landed in Seattle.  She meets you at the building to go over any questions and we had an awesome conversation and I was able to ask a local about fun, must-see, must-eat, must-do spots for visitors and for locals (which is my preference).  Autumn gave great suggestions and was just a joy. I highly recommend renting with Autumn because she makes the logistics of your trip easy and welcoming. 

NOTE 1: Check-in as at 4pm.  While they can sometimes accommodate an early check in, they may be able to arrange dropping your luggage off (as space permits).  Just ask Autumn.  She provides easy directions on how to do this.  Then go up to Broadway Street or to Volunteer Park to check out the many hot-spots and the local charms of the cute neighborhood known as Capitol Hill. 

NOTE 2: X-street to the building is Republican E Street.  Its literally 25 steps from the building.  There is a Pronto station where you can rent a bike for 24 hours or 3 days.  This was PERFECT!  We biked the neighborhood and then one morning biked to Pike's Place Market.  There's a drop off on Pikes and 3rd, near the Ross Discount Store.  This was a memorable and active way to see the city and just enjoy the air and all the flowers along the way.  "
1356339,30561009,2015-04-24,29759585,Stephan,"Autumn couldn’t be nicer. When we met, she talked me quickly through the few things I needed to know about the apartment and also told me about highlights nearby. The apartment is amazing (great view) and looks exactly as in the pictures, and the neighborhood is great. I would definitely stay there again."
1356339,30995579,2015-04-30,10875755,Clint,"Great location!!   The best thing about this apartment is the location.  Very walkable to great restaurants, parks, shops.  Great views of the Space Needle.  Most days we walked to Pike Place Market and then hopped on the 43 bus for the trip uphill back to the apartment.
Autumn was quick to respond when we had a small issue and helpful with restaurant suggestions.  Overall a very pleasant stay."
1356339,31207297,2015-05-03,12066134,Kelly,"Autumn was great to work with and was very easy to get ahold of/communicate with upon arrival. The apartment is in such a nice quiet location and really makes you feel like you're at home. It was perfect for our girl's trip and even allow us to have a nice night ""in"" watching movies and enjoying pizza delivery. Having Top Pot Donuts down the street doesn't hurt this place either - double bonus! All of the natural light streaming through the unit is really nice. The building is super quiet too - we only saw one other occupant the whole length of our stay. The location is good but please realize that it is still a bit of a walk to things like the Space Needle and quite the uphill climb on your return trip. "
1356339,32684512,2015-05-20,29537290,Claudia,"Our stay was wonderful, Location could not have been better!  There were no surprises and the apartment was everything the listing said it was.  We were able to walk to great places to eat and drink, literally down the street.  Already looking forward to our next stay and hopefully at one of Autumns listings."
1356339,33266192,2015-05-26,5790371,Wesley,Excellent experience and overall great space and location. Will definitely recommend this location to others!
1356339,33535378,2015-05-29,16079489,Rick,"To start off, Autumn met me right at the apartment to check in.  She was friendly and accommodating, and even hooked up the air conditioner at my request, just in case!  The apartment was clean, stylish, and comfortable, and we were welcomed there with a tasty bottle of chardonay and some unique sodas in the fridge.  The bed and linens were super comfortable, and all the bathroom supplies, towels, etc were high quality.

The neighborhood was great!  Lots of stuff going on, only a few blocks from a high quality grocery strore (QFC) and shops/restaurants on Broadway, as well as over on Olive Way.  And of course, we had easy access to the rest of the city via the Pronto Bike Share system, with a station right next to the apartment! (although I agree with other posters that the bikes are great for getting to other parts of Seattle . . . not quite so much for the uphill climb back to the apartment)

In sum, this apartment was the perfect spot for my girlfriend and I to relax together, while easily exploring Seattle!  Thanks Autumn!"
1356339,34205201,2015-06-06,14056727,Cicek,"Logement était bien décrit, nous nous attendions tout à fait à cela.
le lit bien confortable, le petit balcon est bien sympathique, pas de bruit . Quartier  est résidentiel mais pas loin des commerces et des cafés etc , on se sent en sécurité.
ça nous est arrivé de rentrer  femme, seule vers minuit, sans aucun soucis."
1356339,35668426,2015-06-21,1156849,Caroline,this apt was exactly as pictured (very nice) and was in the perfect location for us.  we had the best weather and the best time in seattle...highly recommend it!
1356339,36513629,2015-06-29,8679184,John,"Autumn was an excellent, communicative host that generously greeted us at the unit in the late evening. We felt right at home as she showed us the place and offered us points of interest in the area. We would gladly stay again!"
1356339,38699762,2015-07-18,5303315,Steven,"Great place! Was met promptly at 4p, got a tour and a bottle of wine, and then got to experience all the Capitol Hill has to offer. Apartment was clean, well appointed, and has everything you need. Close to lots of great bars, restaurants, coffee places, etc. Would definitely recommend and be happy to stay there again!"
1356339,39911024,2015-07-27,3627070,Cheryl,"The Summit Avenue apartment was just as advertised. It was clean and lovely, with ample clean towels, and many little touches that made it homey.  There are portable air conditioners, which we really didn't need because it was quite cool while we were there.  The patio off the living area was a great surprise, and great for breakfast on a beautiful Seattle morning."
1356339,40591567,2015-08-01,1996328,Joshua,"Fantastic location, host extremely helpful and accommodating. Apartment clean and well maintained, even a welcome bottle of wine. Would recommend when visiting  Seattle. "
1356339,41733608,2015-08-09,30131757,Chris,Great location exactly like the l pictures.
1356339,42867481,2015-08-16,5374821,Jesse,Host was extremely welcoming and provided a ton of insight into what to do in the city.
1356339,45937529,2015-09-07,35376655,Jim,"Although we had a hard time making a connection for checking in, Autumn was very accommodating when we arrived early.  Would definitely work with her again."
1356339,48989230,2015-09-30,36043235,Tim,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! The apartment was clean, comfortable and well prepared for our week long visit to Seattle. It is in a convenient location, with groceries and transportation nearby. 
Thank you!
"
1356339,50176906,2015-10-10,38313895,Sonja,"We had a fantastic stay at this apartment- a great location, easy to get around and views of downtown.  The checkin process went smoothly as Autumn provided us with detailed instructions as she couldn't be there at the same time. Autumn popped by later to the apartment to check if everything was ok. I mentioned that the floors could do with a clean (we had a baby crawling around) and she arranged for the cleaners to do this the next day. A lovely spot and we would recommend. Thanks"
1356339,52576403,2015-10-31,40488810,Kye Jin,"숙소설명은 정확하였음.
문 앞에서 약 5분 정도 기다렸으나 SMS로 상세한 설명을 해줘서 잘 들어갈 수 있었음."
1356339,53637655,2015-11-10,21750477,Shannon,"Autumn was a great host, easy to communicate with and flexible with our check in times. The condo is quiet, clean, bright and was perfect for our group of 3. We enjoyed some home cooked meals and were within walking distance to local restaurants, grocery stores, parks, downtown and the space needle. I highly recommend this spot and I look forward to staying here again."
1356339,54028101,2015-11-15,37675512,Reese,"Great location in Capitol Hill. Close to many restaurants, bars, and coffee shops.  The apartment has everything you need and Autumn was an awesome host. Definitely would recommend to anyone staying in Seattle. "
1356339,54646467,2015-11-22,5641744,Brian,"Nice apartment and a great location.  This is a fairly quiet street, but walking distance to great restaurants and bars."
4725935,23802962,2014-12-10,3494816,Suso,The neighborhood is in a good place .safety . i didnt see Michael . but Leah and Austin . his roommates are nice people . easy going .
4725935,24206559,2014-12-22,24765738,Yihui,房源描述准确。地理位置很好。最后一天乘船迟到，房东亲自驱车带我去，人太好了！
4725935,25361247,2015-01-13,24972326,Dani,"I loved my little nook! It's a great lil' hobbit space, if you just need somewhere to stow your stuff and rest your weary head at night. The listing is completely accurate - you get a bed-sized nook, an adjustable bed lamp, and a couple shelves and a dresser for your stuff, and the hosts nail up a sheet partition for privacy. For the price of a hostel, you get a private space, comfier bedding, and you don't have to worry about locking up your stuff every time you leave. For me, this was totally worth it. 

Bring a sleep mask if you stay in Part 4. The overhead light is left on at night so guests can walk down the stairs without tripping (safety first!), and it's kinda bright. But again, hardly a big deal, when you're paying so little. 

Plus the neighborhood is wicked cool (I spent 1 day exploring Capitol Hill alone - there's loads to do) and it's a 5-10 minute walk to a bus to take you to Seattle Center/Downtown.  

I only met one of the roommates while I was there - Austin, who was perfectly friendly. 

I had read reviews about the shower pressure before I came, so I was pretty much prepared for the worst, and therefore wasn't disappointed by the shower. It's basically a warm to hot mist that comes out of the showerhead. I have short, low-maintenance hair that was under a hat for most of my trip because of winter, so I didn't mind the shower. It's absolutely fine for giving yourself a scrubdown - it just takes a little longer to wash off soap than a regular shower, but it's warm + steamy all the same.  

I highly recommend this place, and would happily stay again :) "
4725935,25801654,2015-01-26,10949666,Smita,"The stay was very comfortable. Perfect for if you are just looking for a place to crash for a few days. Leah and Mike were great hosts, and were always up for a good conversation. The location is really good, just 2 blocks from broadway, and a short walk down to downtown. Good bus connectivity nearby also. Would definitely recommend this place to folks visiting Seattle for a short stay."
4725935,26037054,2015-02-01,25546169,Bobby,"Although my stay was short, the accommodations were great. Very clear, simple instructions from the owner. Provided everything necessary for a good night's stay.

Would definitely stay again."
4725935,26199461,2015-02-06,26863158,Seba,Nice place! The people is very friendly. The place is very similar to the description so is ok for me. I like the shared staff because somebody always can forget something. 
4725935,26377769,2015-02-10,1326395,Catherine,"The host was really welcoming, the house was easy going. Austin was awesome about buying a hairdryer when I asked about one. It felt a lot like staying at a youth hostel--everyone respected privacy but was accessible for conversation. Folks weren't around that much--but then neither was I. I was doing a training. There was a curtain in front of the nook space so that created some privacy. I'd say the biggest downside was the parking. There is very little parking in front of the house. My final day I had a note on my car because clearly I was in the neighbor's space but it had been late at night and I had been too tired to hunt for a space. "
4725935,26475980,2015-02-13,10260880,Perrin,I grabbed a last minute room with Michael & Leah. They quickly pre-approved my booking and emailed me exact times when the room would be prepared. I arrived and Leah had everything comfortable and setup for my stay. I need a simple place to crash while working in the city. I would recommend this host to anyone visiting the Seattle area. 5 stars for sure!!! 
4725935,26748273,2015-02-18,17566922,Meredith,Very quiet space. A cozy little nook. Very comfy. Easy to walk anywhere. 
4725935,26990127,2015-02-23,1289708,Brice,"4 jours très agréables à Seattle et particulièrement dans le quartier de Capitol hill. La communication avec Michael était au top et m'a permis de facilement m'organiser depuis la France puis le Canada. L'arrivée et l'entrée dans la maison  furent donc très faciles. Le coin chambre est très sympa, on s'y sent vraiment à l'aise. De la place pour les affaires et un rideau en tissu pour l'intimité, aucun soucis. Coin cuisine très pratique, toutes les commodités sont là. Et en plus leur maison est très bien placée: au calme mais à 100m de Broadway (magasin QFC très bien...), à 10' à pied de Pine et Pike street pour sortir (concerts au Neumo's...) et le Volunteer park est à 2 pas (jolie vue sur Seattle depuis la citerne d'eau, fun!). Retour à l'aéroport de Tacoma en 1h30 (bus 49 + link light train, easy!). Salutations à Austin et Leah que j'ai croisé! Et merci à Mike. Brice"
4725935,27440773,2015-03-04,7598843,Danielle,"This place was amazing, easy to travel to and from, close to a lot of good food and bars yet still on a quiet street. Leah was amazing with communication leading up to my arrival. The space was super private even though being a shared space. Shower pressure was good!!"
4725935,27624299,2015-03-08,6671256,Sam,Michael was a fantastic host!  Very clear on instructions for check-in and the bed was very very comfortable!  I would stay again without hesitation.
4725935,28052174,2015-03-16,3332050,Joanna,Listing was very accurate and realistic.
4725935,28464457,2015-03-24,25807355,Anne,"I knew that I'd be in a shared space & had no qualms about that (especially with how affordable it was). What I didn't realize was how many other rooms they had to rent out within the apartment. I thought I'd be sharing a bathroom with 3 other people & it was actually anywhere from 5-8 people. It wasn't horrible since I was really only there to sleep, but just something I wish I had known beforehand.
The bed was comfortable & the blanket over the window helped keep it dark when I needed it. Sometimes noisy & not a ton of room to put your stuff, but it could have been worse."
4725935,28608288,2015-03-27,27972908,Gavin,"Exactly what was expected. No complains about the shower, would stay again."
4725935,28884460,2015-03-31,28292880,Cassandra,"Very cozy and quiet space! Really great location, anything you need within walking distance, and lots of thrift shops and record stores! Michael was a really great host, and unfortunately I didn't get a chance to meet Leah but she made everything very easy for me to check in and out! Bathroom was very clean, shower worked perfectly. Would absolutely stay here again :)"
4725935,29159297,2015-04-05,23794822,Anne,"Great location, you can walk to explore the city from there. Nice hosts. Good and accurate descriptions. I would stay there again :-)"
4725935,30738081,2015-04-26,28830313,Leonardo,"my 3 nights were ok, the description was proper and leah helped me always that i asked"
4725935,30947132,2015-04-29,29448069,Shoko,"It was on the great location !!
I liked staying there!!"
4725935,32515270,2015-05-19,98427,Terry,"Leah was very friendly and flexible with by my dates and arrival time. The neighbourhood of Capitol Hill was easily my favourite in Seattle and has a wonderful variety of eateries, thrift shops and coffee stands as well as being easy to get around. 
The house is fairly clean and is a small maze of stairways and doorways that is easy to navigate with the instructions given. My space was a small nook on the third floor which felt private enough, but unfortunately became a little less secluded when the push pins that were holding up the sheet separating my corner started falling out of the ceiling. 

Everyone I met in the apartment was very friendly, though they were all fellow travellers. I arrived a few minutes before my scheduled time and although the host was home when I messaged her from the corner she still preferred to put my key in the mail box instead of handing it to me in person. I'm sure they are quite busy with all of the rooms being rented out, but it is that personal touch that has kept me coming back to this site. I don't fault their efforts, but if you relsih the opportunity to interact with locals this may not be the ideal place for you."
4725935,33246213,2015-05-26,29817268,Penny,"I really enjoyed my stay.  My host made an effort to provide some privacy in a shared space which was greatly appreciated and worked great.  The place was clean, the bed was comfy (really impressed that I had multiple pillows on the bed) and all emails before I arrived were polite, helpful, and clear regarding what I needed to do when I arrived.  There was also an informational booklet that was a great reference.  The location was perfect - close to Broadway which has several good places to eat and there was a really good grocery store very close by.   My experience was very positive!"
4725935,34004812,2015-06-03,32279139,Sann,"Great location and great hosts! Descriptions of a quaint, older home were accurate. Had everything I needed apart from head bandages. Kept banging my noggin on the slanted ceiling."
4725935,34442988,2015-06-08,32371832,Mike,"Everything was great, well-organized and totally as advertised.  Recommended.  "
4725935,35502283,2015-06-19,30404074,Karev,Super nice place and kind host.
4725935,35930295,2015-06-23,9089524,Erin,"Austin was the one present during my stay and he was very welcoming and hospitable, giving me great recommendations for what I was feeling on doing that day. The cozy little attic area was perfect as my stop off place while running around Seattle as it was central enough to head to whatever area I felt like exploring. The communal areas were clean and welcoming. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in the cozy little attic. "
4725935,36194320,2015-06-26,33462249,Alan,"The hosts were excellent.  Michael was away but communicated well, and his roomates Leah and Austin were able to assist with any questions or concerns.  The neighborhood was really nice."
4725935,36531723,2015-06-29,32220931,Kyle,"Michael was out of town, so I communicated with his roommate Leah.  She was excellent.  She promptly answered any questions I had by text.  "
4725935,37660842,2015-07-09,4655626,Philippe,Beautiful place in a really nice location.
4725935,38848953,2015-07-19,34029309,Oliver,House is very convenient to the everything. Great area.
4725935,39218413,2015-07-21,21130699,Adam,"It's a nice place! Those rooms are really clean, nice and comfortable for staying! And roommates are pretty nice! the location is really convinent to visit downtown ladmarks. In addition, they offered AC so even though it's preety hot I still slept well! 
Thank you Mike!
这家公寓在距离上十分适合短期室内旅游的人们，在这住的几位平时都见不到，都有自己的事情，但是从房间非常整洁来看他们肯定经常打扫所以这个性价比非常好了。除此之外厨房也可以使用，而且有共享的食品，都非常方便我们。但是因为我住的地方是用帘子隔开的床位，所以独自旅行的女生要考虑一下。总的来说这个地方相当不错。"
4725935,39661980,2015-07-25,5189845,Grant,Room was just as described. Great Host and Communication!
4725935,40116645,2015-07-28,36224594,Alyssa,Extremely helpful and easy-going hosts. The house had a wonderful set up in a great location. I would definitely stay here again!
4725935,44029980,2015-08-23,4985832,Sven,"Unfortunately I had no chance to meet Michael or Leah. 
The place was very well located and the neighborhood is really nice. 
They provided me with very detailed arrival and departure information so everything was perfectly organized. 
My bed was on the top floor of the house in the alley and the other guests with rooms had to pass by all the time so better don't be shy. I also had a car and to find a free spot in the area is rather hard. 
But I just needed a place to sleep and therefore it was great.
Thanks!"
4725935,44584032,2015-08-27,5531202,David,"Leah was extremely friendly. The space was small but exactly as described and a great value. An awesome location right in Capitol Hill, which is a great area for bars and restaurants. I was able to do laundry in the building which was very useful for me."
4725935,46217871,2015-09-08,24229707,Jie,This place has an unbeatable location right in the middle of the great neighborhood of Capitol Hill. I was able to get to most places on foot or by bus. Michael and Leah are cheerful cool people and the whole process was very smooth.
4725935,46814435,2015-09-13,12267415,Ben,"AirBnB on autoPilot! 

The hosts have this down to a science, and you can tell they have done this before.

Everything is organized for your stay (likely hours before you arrive), and your name is on your room! If you ever have a question during your stay like: ""What's the deal with the kitchen? What food can i eat?"" you can consult the handbook (because each room comes complete with one) or read one of the many useful notes placed around the apartment.

Yes, you could ask any of the fellow airBnBers or Mike or Leah, all of whom are very nice, but the very cool thing about this place is that you don't have to. 

Your stay can be completely independent of anyone else, if you want it to be! I would encourage talking to any one you can though, as everyone I talked to was wicked cool!

Great stay!"
4725935,47960795,2015-09-22,35150205,Uula,"I loved this place! I actually went camping for a week after my stay and came back for another night, and it felt like coming home. Leah and Michael (who was around only the first couple of days) are such great hosts and want to make sure you are having a good time. the house is clean and quiet, and the corner where the bed is has enough privacy. the location is also perfect and there is definitely something for everyone. all in all, I had a great stay!"
4725935,48314634,2015-09-25,43301005,Diogo,"Great host, made me feel really welcome and comfortable."
4725935,48804423,2015-09-28,7903956,David,"Entire process was very smooth and easy, thanks to detailed information/instructions from the hosts. The whole house is clean, welcoming, and comfortable. Down side is that there is one bathroom shared between about eight people. "
4725935,52719382,2015-11-01,608367,Brendan,Super organized. They have Airbnb down to a science. 
4725935,53525230,2015-11-09,47281032,Nicolas,"Very nice place, the organisation is perfect! Thanks Leah and Mike!"
4725935,56064110,2015-12-08,14171907,Jonathan,"Michael wasn't there at the time, but I did briefly meet his roommate Leah. She was wonderful and kind! 

The place is located in a really great part of Capitol Hill, and it's really convenient to get around. There are plenty of restaurants and shops within just 5 minutes. It took me about 25 minutes to walk all the way down to Pike's Place (just to give you an idea).

The apartment itself was great! I met a few really nice folks that were traveling as well, as there is a living room that everyone can socialize in. Everything was clean and prepped when I got there, and there were signs regarding pretty much everything within the home. It was quiet and everyone staying there was respectful.

Awesome place to stay while you're in Seattle!   "
4725935,57079896,2015-12-21,39976274,Graziana,"I had a great short stay! Since I had booked Leah gave me exactly all the info that I needed for checking in and out, and also during my staying she was always ready to answer my questions. At my my arrival there was umbrella, mask and earplugs, very thoughtful. The bed was cozy and warm! Great location too, easy to reach and you can get to downtown also walking if you don't mind, I did it by myself safely. If you are comfortable to stay in a shared room, you ll have a very good stay!"
4725935,57398871,2015-12-25,49039847,Hsin-Han,"Nice host, close to the spot, I like it so much "
1589681,48832101,2015-09-28,40812770,Bernadette,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Ballard Cottage. The room is clean, quiet and comfortable (especially the bed). The hosts Heather and Grant could not have been more hospitable and accommodating. They are really willing to go the extra mile to make sure their guests are happy and have everything they need. They gave me great suggestions for parks to visit in Seattle and also let me know that one of the days was Smithsonian sponsored free museum day! Their recommendations really made for a great weekend. The location is prime with tons of shops and restaurants in Ballard within walking distance or a couple minutes in the car. The Sunday farmers market is great and less than a mile walk. I had a great time in Seattle thanks to Heather and Grant!"
1589681,49170654,2015-10-01,44813408,Jeremy,"Heather and her husband were there when I arrived to show me around, answer questions, and introduce me to a few of the cats. They quickly ran through all the important info, then left me to settle in. I didn't see them again while I was there, but Heather was very quick to respond to messages.

The Airbnb is a converted garage next to a house in a cute and quiet residential neighborhood. It's about a mile walk downhill to most of the shops and bars in Ballard."
1589681,50117570,2015-10-09,11685379,Liang,"Heather was a good host and responded very fast to help us complete our reservation. 

When we arrived, her husband showed us around the cute cottage and their yard plus some handy tips to help us to enjoy our stay and explore this wonderful city. 

It's a quiet and peaceful place to stay and easy to access most areas around Seattle.  

In addition, you might have some little kitty visitors around late night or early morning. So... if you love cats, this cottage could be one good place to stay for your next journey in Seattle ; ) "
1589681,52749969,2015-11-01,5837399,Momen,Great location very close to the heart of Ballard. The place is adequate for a couple that want to stay close to the best area in Ballard where most restaurants are. Walking distance to ballard's farmers market
1589681,54198587,2015-11-16,48510801,Antonio,Super great people. The place was very warm and cozy. Bed was surprisingly very comfy. 
1589681,54478611,2015-11-20,5209655,Laura,"Heather's place was great! Check in and check out were a breeze and she was very easy to communicate with. The bed, even though it is a pull out couch, is super comfortable - overall a lovely, quiet place to stay in Ballard! "
1589681,54650678,2015-11-22,35888656,Jacque,"Great place to stay, very comfortable and in a great location. The hosts were very friendly and helpful. I would say that if you are allergic to cats you may want to avoid this, as their kitties are in the area. But if you are a cat lover like we are, then it is fun to have little furry friends around! We would definitely stay here again! Oh, and ample free parking is a huge plus!"
1589681,54994991,2015-11-27,36480558,Mary,"Our room was like a studio apartment, behind the main house facing their gardens.  It was very private and quiet.  You slept on a comfortable Queen hide-abed.  The unit also had a small refrigerator, toaster oven, coffeemaker, and a microwave oven for us to use, with all the necessary silverware and dishes. 
  My husband appreciated the complementary bottle of wine and beer.  I loved the good selection of teas.
The location is in a nice residential neighborhood, yet near many wonderful restaurants in the Ballard area.   
We enjoyed our stay.

1589681,55140891,2015-11-28,20972964,Marie,Lovely place!
8392661,47587199,2015-09-20,19140751,Brian,"Renting this place was very easy, and Tracey was very easy to work with and communicate with. I was able to get ahold of her very quickly, and she was very helpful in recommending places to eat. The place was as described and very clean. I would stay here again."
8392661,48344043,2015-09-25,29965909,Sean,"Excellent place, very clean, cozy, and quiet.  The apartment is very new, callbox security system.  Tracey is very helpful.  I had some logistics challenge at the trip, and she offered a solution that made my trip very smooth.  I can't thank her enough.  "
8392661,49293674,2015-10-02,44889045,Kyle,Tracey was very accommodating at this clean and large studio apartment. Definitely would recommend!
8392661,49692360,2015-10-05,20950836,Karen,Tracey was a great hostess.  Everything was exactly as described.  She worked around my schedule both to drop off the the keys and to pick them up when I left.  Very accommodating.  We had one problem - the Internet was hit-and-miss the first day. Tracey was on it and got it fixed for the remainder of my stay.  I was impressed. I loved the underground and gated parking.  I definitely recommend Tracey's Airbnb apartment.
8392661,49854389,2015-10-06,44348850,Brian,Great location. Very clean. Nice place. 
8392661,50522571,2015-10-12,44885473,Alex,"Our host was flexible and accommodating. Tracey took the time to call us in advance and set up a key exchange and when we weren't able to meet to make the exchange she made sure we would have access to the suite and had a back up plan in case the initial plan did not work.

Her description of her suite was also accurate.  Her place was clean, she laid out toiletries and clean sheets and had everything we were looking for.  She even laid out some snacks and tea for us."
8392661,52089998,2015-10-26,44365780,Igor,"It was just perfect! 
Tracey is a incredible kind person who was already at the place when I got there and gently showed me the apartment and stayed in touch for the whole trip. Whenever I needed to talk about something with her, she answered really quick. 
The place looks exactly as the photos show. I really liked there. Very comfortable!! I even wanted to live there because it's felt like I was in my home!
I really recommend this place!  
Thank you for everything Tracey!
Really hope to return to Seattle and if I do, I'll certainly book your apartment again!"
8392661,54128613,2015-11-16,46404686,Johnny,"The place was conveniently a mile away from the century link field, but there were a couple of hold backs.  Trying to find parking was a nightmare, we had to park a couple of blocks away. The apartment building was nice and room was clean but the heater did not work and made a funny noise. One blanket was provided and still was a bit chilly inside of the room and you could hear everything from the outside, people screaming and the cars passing by which made it hard to sleep at night. The next morning I was trying to look for coffee pot and a glass but wasn't easily accessible. The WiFi was also extremely slow, I had a tough time trying to stream the NFL game off of my computer since there is also no T.V."
8392661,54326680,2015-11-18,14416487,Nick,Tracey was a vigilant communicator: she messaged us before we arrived and before we left to coordinate key exchanges. Her unit wasn't too far off the beaten path and offered all the basic amenities we required. Nice place to rest between adventures.
8392661,54837567,2015-11-25,47776187,Philipp,The host canceled this reservation 92 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8392661,55414774,2015-12-01,39856126,Paola,"This was our first time using Airbnb, a new experience and we enjoyed staying at Tracey's, she contacted us to arrange our check in, she was patient with us even tough keep changing the time to meet her. The place is cozy :) two turn downs for us, parking is outside in the street - gladly we found parking  right outside the building-and second the restroom was a bit dirty -toilet and bathtub- overall the apartment is nice . We will consider this place to stay again! "
8392661,56606611,2015-12-15,17199783,Amanda,"Tracey was such a great host! She was flexible with us on our arrival and departure times, very friendly, and readily available to answer questions. The apartment is exactly as pictured...really clean, well-stocked, and great location (about 10 minutes to the heart of downtown via Uber). We would love to stay here again!"
8392661,57128277,2015-12-22,4326815,Erik,"When traveling, all we need is a bed and bathroom, and we're good to go. This listing had both of those things for much less than some others in the city, so it worked out. The apartment is exactly as pictured, but note the bed is very firm, and the pillows are very flat.
Due to scheduling issues, Tracey needed to push out the check-in time over six hours, and was unable to meet up before or after our stay. We had a car and plenty we wanted to do around the city, so happily this wasn't an issue.
Parking is curbside, and can be tricky to find, but there are no duration limits. When we'd head downtown, we'd just take an Über for under $10 (typically cheaper than parking)."
8392661,57483283,2015-12-26,7377492,Jason,"Before we arrived, Tracey was courteous and flexible with us. Our flight was delayed and we arrived later than planned, and it was not a problem for her. The bed was fine, but not particularly comfortable.

The one major issue that we had during our stay was access to the building. In order to come and go, we had to call Tracey on the building intercom so that she could buzz us in. We warned her that we were going out and might be back pretty late, but she assured us it was no problem, we should call whenever we came back to be buzzed in. Unfortunately, that did not quite work out. We arrived, called, no answer. Tried two more times, no answer. We were stuck outside in the cold at 1am.

By pure luck, a different tenant came out of the building after about 5 minutes. Seizing the opportunity we grabbed the door and went in (but felt really sketchy). After 2am, over an hour later I got a text from Tracey, asking if we had gotten in.

Nowhere in Tracey's listing, nor in my communication with her before I arrived did she indicate that I would need to call her every time I wanted access to the building, nor that there were particular hours when I would not be able to access the building. This was a major problem for us, and I would recommend that future guests clarify these requirements before booking."
8392661,57881821,2015-12-30,21711089,Annie,"The building is safe and secure. Parking is on the street which I don't have a problem finding a spot. The place is also quiet, but the heater kept going on and off, hard to sleep at night. It will be nice to have some more glassware. The place is 15 mins away from downtown. "
7836953,55408606,2015-12-01,47027970,Joe,"We found this home to be a great place to stay for our visit to Seattle.  We had 7 people and the house accommodated us well.  The 3 bedrooms are large, the living room is large, and the dining room and kitchen are very functional.  It is in a great location with easy access to downtown, the airport, and to the West Seattle beach.  It sits on a hill, so from the dining room you can see the top of Mt Rainier, and from the dining room and living room you can watch the ferry crossing from Fauntleroy to Vashion Island.  The neighborhood is very quiet, and there was parking for our 3 cars - one in the driveway and two on the street in front of the house.  The bed in the master bedroom was comfortable, the hosts made us feel very welcome, and we were happy with our stay.  I'd recommend this house, and would stay there again."
6481764,36696250,2015-06-30,22969521,Andrea,"This is a terrific house! We traveled to Seattle for a long weekend with our 13 month old daughter. The house had everything we needed for her: pack-n-play, high chair, stroller, toys and books. And the yard was perfect for her to run around and play. We all enjoyed picking fresh raspberries from the garden. The house also had everything else you would need to cook meals, including a good selection of condiments. It happened to be one of the warmest weekends in a long time (80-90s) and the house did get pretty warm, especially the upstairs bedroom. We spent most of our time in the Ballard/Freemont area, but it was also very easy and quick to get downtown (we rented a car). Jared was very quick to respond to my questions and extremely helpful. The welcoming bottle of wine and coffee was a nice touch! I highly recommend staying at this house."
6481764,37347325,2015-07-06,35137603,Jim,"My family and I stayed in this beautiful house in Seattle, it was everything it says in he overview and more!  The location is excellent, close to downtown with local shops in easy walking distance. The house itself was beautiful, and very well laid out, with three good sized bedrooms and lovely places (inside and outside) to sit and read, watch TV or listen to music. It had everything we needed and my daughters had great fun on the fooze ball table in the basement! Our host Jared had everything organised for our stay and we didn't want for anything.  We would highly recommend this house for any families that want more than a hotel room to help the, enjoy a visit to the lovely city of Seattle with its many attractions. "
6481764,37996449,2015-07-12,35150342,Rachel,"This was an amazing experience for my first airbnb! This home is just beautiful and the whole hosting experience was wonderful. Jared and his ""caretaker"" :-) contacted me well in advance so we all knew what to expect upon arrival and whilst we were staying there. The home is in a fabulous Seattle neighborhood and I loved being there - so much so that I think I will look for a post-doc in the city when I graduate! Staying with Jared is a fabulous experience that is organized, respectful and informative (house manual is awesome as is the basket of local maps and books). Thank you Hawkins' family for the lone of your home and also the lovely welcome gift. You guys rock!"
6481764,39192708,2015-07-21,6905467,Sylvia,"The house was exactly as described, and we enjoyed our family enjoyed our stay there very much.  The home is well-furnished, very clean and comfortable, with some beautiful modern design features.  The upstairs master bedroom is especially well-crafted, light and airy.  The beds, bedding, household appliances and equipment were excellent. The local contact person, Jennifer, was very welcoming, accommodating and helpful.  The neighborhood is tranquil with ample street parking and within a short drive to Greenlake, Ballard and Fremont. "
6481764,39437939,2015-07-23,937521,Andrew,"Jared's house worked very well for us. It was clean and comfortable, and a short drive from Ballard restaurants and amenities. It's particularly suited to families with young children, as it contains lots of toys and amusements for kids, and a bunkbed. Our six-year-old spent 48 hrs playing Monopoly with his grandmother, and cleaned house!"
6481764,39942412,2015-07-27,27001145,Thanhhang,"Beautifully decorated home. Felt very welcomed, relaxed, and had everything we needed and more"
6481764,41088488,2015-08-04,35376950,Jan-Patrick,"We, a family of five, had a great experience. The house is perfectly located, bright, warm and offers everything one needs. Within minutes we were in Ballard for dinner or shopping. Equally fast, we were at the beach enjoying a sunset. Overall, we felt home away from home and thank our hosts for opening their house."
6481764,41949359,2015-08-10,1845479,Alexander,Jared has a wonderful house and we really enjoyed our stay there. The location of the house is great and communication with Jared was hassle-free. I would definitely recommend this place to others and would stay there myself during my next trip to Seattle.
6481764,43765528,2015-08-22,34781858,Thomas,"Jared's house worked perfectly for our family of 5.  We arrived late (after midnight ) and he made arrangements for us to get the key easily.  The house was comfortable and clean and perfectly located for activities in Seattle and the surrounding area.  We were able to take a quick drive into the city for Pike's Market, the Space Needle and a few museums and we also were able to go to Bainbridge Island and Mt Rainier.  And it was nice to come back to the quiet comfort of Jared's home in Ballard.

Thanks Jared "
6481764,44315995,2015-08-25,7919379,Breanne,We had a great stay at Jared's place!  It was comfortable and welcoming.  The space was nicely decorated and we felt like we really lived in Seattle!  We could walk to some cute places and the house was only a short drive to downtown Ballard and the beach.  Jared was quick to respond and Jennifer was super helpful with any questions and with letting us into the house. I would highly recommend this place!
6481764,44717339,2015-08-28,41551955,Chris,House was awesome!  Perfect fit for our family of four.  Great location with some excellent restaurants just a short drive away.  Host was very communicative and responded quickly to questions.  The pictures match the house exactly.
6481764,45381848,2015-09-02,24885420,Patricia,"We had a wonderful stay at Jared's home; there was a bottle of wine to welcome us and the house was lovely, very clean and comfortable. We found everything we needed and absolutely enjoyed the garden. The neighborhood is great, a quiet residential area but within walking distance of Ballard with its many shops and farmer's market. We enjoyed going to the locks and cruising the area. We also took the bus to go downtown, very easy and the bus stop is only two blocks away. We had a great time!"
6646843,42459413,2015-08-13,6865729,Elena,"We had a great time, the apartment was clean and comfortable, in a pretty neighborhood, entry and exit went without a hitch. Yoav checked in with us to make sure we had everything we needed. Thanks!"
6646843,42849210,2015-08-16,1804151,Maricella,"Very nice home and great neighborhood!  It was perfect for our family trip.  The home was clean and fit our needs for the 4 of us perfectly.  Yoav was very communicative throughout which was much appreciated.  They gave great recommendations on things to do nearby, especially indoor activities when we experienced a rainy day.  We had a great time visiting Seattle."
6646843,43381656,2015-08-19,16865334,Brett,"A very cute, cozy apartment in Ballard! A little far away from the main action of the neighborhood, but that also makes it a nice, quiet retreat from the busyness of the city. Easy access to downtown by public transportation was a huge plus. Yoav was great to deal with and even bought an iron/ironing board when we inquired about it. "
6646843,43931171,2015-08-23,13168190,Bradley,"This was a great duplex in Ballard. There was one small bedroom, a living room with a sofa/futon that pulled out to a bed, and a small dining table (two chairs), a nice kitchen, and a good bathroom. Our family of four (two adults and two young children) stayed there in August for four days and it was a good size for us. We had a car with us, and street parking was easy to come by.

The house was in excellent condition and clean. In the bedroom, the hosts left space for us to unpack into closets and shelves. There were dry supplies (e.g. pasta) in the kitchen, though we brought our own food and mostly ate out. The wifi worked well. We didn't turn on the TV, but there was one in the living room. There was coin-operated laundry available on-site. I believe it was $1.25 to wash and $1.50 to dry. Detergent was available in the laundry room. We did one load and had no problems.

The hosts were extremely organized, thorough and accommodating. When we said we'd be arriving quite late, they went ahead and set up the sofa bed for us. Given the fact we had sleepy kids with us, this was really a boon as we could go straight to bed upon arrival from the east coast. They also provided very detailed information about the house, how to check out, and a map of Ballard. Checking in was also very easy!

We have no complaints whatsoever about this experience; indeed it was better than at least our last three hotel stays! This was my first time using air b&b and I can only hope that additional experiences are so positive."

6646843,44642465,2015-08-28,5241895,Mark,We enjoyed our stay and look forward to another opportunity to visit Ballard and the great location of this home.
6646843,45093029,2015-08-31,35236117,Karen,We stayed here for a wedding in Ballard-parking was good - close to stores and restaurants. Nice space for 2 people.  We would stay here again 
6646843,45603222,2015-09-04,962428,Melanie,"We had a very comfortable stay at Maya & Yoav's flat. The neighbourhood was great and Yoav was very responsive to questions and requests, including providing a crib with linens for our baby. We would definitely stay again."
6646843,46133309,2015-09-08,37080017,Melinda,"I booked this flat for my family to stay at over labor day weekend. It is within walking distance from my condo- great location in Ballard near downtown, grocery store, coffee shops, restaurants, etc. Yoav & Maya were very welcoming and easy to deal with- even offering to set up the futon for us prior to our arrival. The flat was clean, cute and cozy. Sleeping accommodations were a bit tight for 4 people but perfect for 2 or 3. I would book this flat again for future visits!"
6646843,46562843,2015-09-11,43697791,Bryan,It was such a pleasure to walk into the unit and find a bottle of wine on the table next to the property instructions.  Thank you!  
6646843,46972922,2015-09-14,43131094,Jason,"Maya and Yoav's flat was such a great place to stay. The place was clean, cozy, and in a wonderful neighborhood. It was nice being outside of downtown but still being highly accessible. It only takes about 10-15 minutes to get to the heart of the city. The town of Ballard was such a nice surprise to us. We ended up spending most of our time there. The shops, restaurants, and breweries were all within a short drive/walk. "
6646843,47965741,2015-09-22,37053176,Gerardo,"Maya and Yoav were awesome hosts. They left instructions on how to explore the area and about all the cool things to do in Seattle. The house was perfect, included laundry and dishwasher. Everything was very clean and comfortable. The area is very quiet and we slept well every night."
6646843,48467662,2015-09-26,36426128,Kyle,This place was great. Cute little house in a nice neighborhood in Ballard. I was left some welcoming libations by maya and yoav. Thank you. 
6646843,48724416,2015-09-28,38786937,Jared,"Great stay, great hosts."
6646843,49356782,2015-10-03,42623646,Dixie,"This was our first experience with Airbnb. Maya and Yoav were responsive, wonderful hosts. The house was cute and comfortable. The location was perfect for us, we felt a part of the neighborhood immediately. It was within walking distance to everything we required. We thank Yoav and Maya for all their attention to detail and for welcoming us into Airbnb.  We will be back!  "
6646843,50316229,2015-10-11,43623971,Clint,"We had a great experience renting from Maya and Yoav. The flat location allowed for easy access to the area. The flat itself was kept and furnished well. There was even a welcome gift waiting for us. This was a great weekend stay and more than affordable. Thanks for the great accommodations and flexibility with our checkout time. 

- Clint"
6646843,50866829,2015-10-15,6807695,Julia,"The flat was comfortable and a good place to stay.  My husband and I enjoyed walking to nearby coffee and eateries ( we LOVED Bitterroot BBQ), as well as being a very short drive to other places.  It was great to be able to have the comforts of home (roomy shower, coffee maker, etc) while away.  We found a great map with descriptions of places to eat and drink, which was a very helpful starting place for exploring the area.  
One thing that I will note: in the morning for a few short minutes it is easy to hear the neighbors leaving for work.  This did not impact us too much as we fell right back to sleep, but it was noticeable.  We didn't hear them anywhere else in the house, or any other time of the day, though."
6646843,51334814,2015-10-19,45022395,Kristen,"Maya and Yoav's flat was fantastic for our stay: it's nicely located in an adorable neighborhood, walking distance to a ton of restaurants, bars and shops in Ballard. It was clean and safe and adorably set up for our visit, and they were accessible to answer any questions that arose while we were in town (or offer good local restaurant recommendations!). Definitely recommend staying here on your trip to Seattle!"
6646843,51825991,2015-10-24,5495850,Kate,"Such a perfect, cute apartment for my quick trip to Seattle. The apartment was clean, and everything worked smoothly from the wifi, to the tv to having a hot shower each morning! Loved the location and extra touches Maya and Yoav put in to make it special. Thanks! "
6646843,52116784,2015-10-26,45289523,Darian,This was a perfect little place for our family of four!  Cozy and quaint with everything we could need between a full kitchen to comfy beds and even a tub for our little ones to end their busy days in.  We felt very welcomed by Yoav and his polite and friendly boys who came by personally to gift us a bottle of wine (Yum!) and a few sweet treats for the kiddos!  Highly recommended and we wouldn't hesitate to return.  Thank you!
6646843,53343302,2015-11-08,37824218,Jennifer,"Maya and Yoav were wonderful hosts who were extremely accommodating. The flat was clean, comfortable and very cute, plus the location was perfect for my visit. Looking forward to coming back to Seattle and booking this flat again."
6646843,54055580,2015-11-15,398199,Jen,"First of all, it's red! How can you NOT love it? The cheery color was perfect in the gloomy weather. The inside was cozy and warm, a nice place to put our feet up and relax after a long day of walking around in the rain. It's only a couple of blocks to Ballard Market, an amazing local grocery story open 24/7 chock full of good stuff. We didn't have a car, so we alternated walking and Ubering to all the bars and restaurants in the Old Ballard area, depending on how cold it was or how tired we were. Maya and Yoav also recommended Morsel for breakfast, which is only a few blocks away and had delicious biscuits. There were also some great breweries within walking distance. Overall we really enjoyed our stay. We never actually met Maya and Yoav but they communicated with us before and during our stay so that we had everything we needed. "
6646843,54484319,2015-11-20,10858510,Danielle,"Maya and Yoav's flat is just great!  It was easy to get to, easy check in, and the laundry room was appreciated.  Ballard is one of my favorite neighborhoods, and this was a great location to experience it."
6646843,54710646,2015-11-23,9575804,Collan,The house was cozy and close to everything that Ballard had to offer. It met my needs perfectly. 
6646843,55098910,2015-11-28,22259112,Philip,"Yoav was a good communicator and we had no issues finding and getting into the house. The description was accurate. The location is great. We walked to Ballard Market for coffee, and Veraci Pizza among others. We had four people and the unit felt a bit tight, but worked fine for us since we were out and about during the days and really only sleeping there."
6646843,55455554,2015-12-01,47923892,Chris,House was close to many Ballard and Fremont neighborhood restuarnts and breweries.  Easy to find and plenty of parking.
6646843,55884198,2015-12-06,3268301,Lalo,"I was looking for a place to hide and get some work done on my laptop, and I wanted to be able to do fun stuff in the evenings.  Sweet North Central Flat checked all the boxes! Private, comfy, all the amenities you need to be happy, and a 15 minute stroll to Ballard Ave's bars and music and restaurants. Trader Joe's just down the road too.

Maya & Yoav couldn't have been any more helpful; there was even a bottle of wine waiting for me upon arrival! This was a great little working retreat for me. Thanks!


"
6646843,57661086,2015-12-28,3339560,Antonio,"Maya and Yoav were super friendly and attentive to our stay! They checked in with us, and made sure we were comfortable and happy with everything. There place is super cute, quiet, and in a great location! 2 minutes from a great market and walking distance to great restaurants, bars, and cute shops."
7459637,41833066,2015-08-09,747668,Megan,"We had a bit of trouble getting in the house and no one answered the number we were given. Once we were finally in, though, the house was comfortable and ready for us. We didn't realize it was a 3 story townhouse so we had to do some exploring to find things. Maybe because of the acoustics in the townhouse complex we woke up more than once convinced that someone was in the house. It sounded exactly like someone walked up the stairs and was opening doors in the hallway. It was very creepy. All in all, though, it was a good price for one night. "
7459637,42922239,2015-08-16,39525290,Stephane And Kelsey,"My boyfriend and I travelled from Vancouver to Seattle for a few nights and we absolutely LOVED Kristina's house. Very very clean, safe feeling, and has that comfortable homey feeling..something that is important to feel when you're away from home. Beautiful kitchen and family room - very spacious. The bedroom was comfortable and cozy.  The house was in a perfect area with lots of parking directly infront and lots of restaurants/coffee shops/Convenient stores around within walking distance. It Was a quick Uber ride to downtown ( about 10-15 minutes (12-15$ roughly) very close to all the essentials. Kristina and Colin were very accommodating and asked (multiple times) if there was anything they could do to improve our stay. Upon arrival, there were some delicious breakfast items left on the counter for us -very thoughtful.  They answered any messages promptly even though they were also on vacation.  Very pleasant to talk with. I Would recommend this home to ANYONE interested in staying in Seattle and we will hopefully be back one day. Wouldn't change one thing about our stay. Thank you Kristina!"
7459637,44033241,2015-08-23,41276167,Tess,"This home is very relaxing and comfortable, and the hosts will make you feel right at home. Kristina and Colin made sure we had all the information we needed prior to our arrival and that we knew how to contact them should we need anything else. But we didn't need anything as they made check-in and our stay really easy.
The town home itself has a cozy, comfy interior with a nice kitchen and spacious living room. And it's located right near some really amazing restaurants and shops. 
Kristina and Colin really make you feel welcome. Among the particulars were breakfast snacks, clean towels, soft bedding, as well as coffee, coffee filters and a coffee pot (which is really important to me since I was departing before the coffee shops opened).
Overall an exceptional experience with outstanding hosts. Highly recommended. (I did not get a chance to use the public transit from here, but it looked like you could get on a quick bus ride just about anywhere, including downtown Seattle)."
7459637,46044111,2015-09-07,41177134,Peaches,"Kristina and Colin were great hosts! They were very helpful throughout our whole stay, and even prior to our trip they were super easy to contact and got back to me very quickly with answers to any questions/concerns I had. 

We landed in Seattle a few hours earlier than our check in time, but Kristina graciously allowed us to come by the house to drop our suitcases off, which we greatly appreciated. Their home was just as they had described it and they had created a folder with very helpful information about the home, transportation, and different things to do in Seattle. They had breakfast goodies for us on the counter and coffee was provided as well, which was great!! 

The check in/ check out process was a breeze and we had an amazing stay in Seattle. I would definitely recommend staying at their place if you are coming to the area. It is a short drive (~15mins) to Downtown and there is even a bus stop super close to their home. This was the first time I had ever used Airbnb and it was an amazing first experience. Thank you Kristina and Colin!

3354614,14846440,2014-06-27,17130709,Krissy,"Erika was very gracious and helpful on our vacation. The spot is a short walk away from the beautiful Lake Washington, and the best breakfast spot we believe in all of Seattle (check out Hi Spot Cafe.) The room itself if huge, the bed is amazingly comfortable and the water pressure in the shower is something that came straight from my dreams. I hope to be back soon!"
3354614,14897040,2014-06-28,14013675,Katie,"Erika's unit is an idea place to stay if you have a family or a larger group - it's huge! My boyfriend and I only stayed one night before an early morning flight, but we were so happy to find a place that was comfortable and relaxing. We enjoyed roaming around the neighborhood for the evening, visiting the Central Cinema and some cool local bars, only to come ""home"" to a quiet night of retro TV. Everything in the space is clean, and many of the fixtures and appliances are new. 

Erika herself was a warm and accommodating host. She let us drop off our bags before she got home and walked us through everything: how to use the remote, the internet, the X box, etc. Thanks, Erika!

One word of advice: the neighborhood is mostly nice, but it looks like there are some areas where things get a little patchy. Nothing too crazy - just be generally streetwise and you'll be fine. "
3354614,15012654,2014-06-30,2370863,Stacy,"Staying at Eric's place was great! I was confused about finding the home, google maps had me turn right instead of left.  But Erika was helpful in getting me to the house.  
There were lots of toys for my children to play with. And plenty of room for all of us to enjoy.  
There are also great places to eat just down the street and bus stops right in front of the house that go to downtown Seattle."
3354614,15360429,2014-07-07,2258831,Nicole,This was a lovely place to stay and our host was very communicative and let us know exactly where to go and where everything was. I would recommend this place.
3354614,15706839,2014-07-14,2548811,Kathrina,"Erika's place was spacious, highly affordable, clean, and modern. We appreciated that she walked us through everything (wifi, appliances, where she kept extra bedding, etc.). Her place was also centrally located, which was convenient. Thank you Erika. "
3354614,16316650,2014-07-25,13312250,Bryne,"This is in a very nice neighborhood about a 10-minute drive from downtown.  It is a basement apartment, and the ceilings are a bit low for someone very tall (over 6'5"" or so).  The apartment itself is spacious and comfy.  Erika was a gracious host and made herself available for any questions/requests.  Overall, a pleasant experience!"
3354614,16427183,2014-07-27,17875807,Alex,Erika was a vers friendly and helpfull host. She showed showed us nice places in the neighborhood. There was also a nice Garden by the House and de enjoyed sitting in the sun. 
3354614,16621729,2014-07-30,15541586,Geoffrey,"Erika was a great host.  From the moment we arrived, she was welcoming from the get to and accommodating from the start.  Her location is removed from downtown but easily accessible from her house using the bus stop located out front that will take you right to Pine Ave.  We enjoyed our stay in her place.  One thing, since the rental is below the house, you can hear foot traffic but not at night when your ready to sleep.  I would recommend the place as its clean and neat.  "
3354614,16738117,2014-08-01,7650772,Mhark,Erika was an amazing host. She was very helpful with being so informative on travelling around Seattle and where there a great places to eat. I would definitely stay here again.
3354614,17060359,2014-08-06,15739380,Tanya,The place was lovely and Erika was a very kind and attentive host.  It's exactly as pictured - large and spacious with a comfortable bed - in a beautiful neighbourhood in Seattle.  Five minute walk to amazing shops and restaurants.
3354614,17127526,2014-08-07,18739159,Katie,"This was my first Airbnb experience. It was a lot less awkward than I was expecting; in fact it was pretty great. Erika was a wonderful host. She walked us through everything about the place and gave us two perfect recommendations for our evening. The neighborhood is in an amazing and convenient location. We were able to walk to an awesome wine bar and had happy hour at a restaurant that were both recommended by Erika. We were in town to watch a show at a local theater, and then took a $10 cab ride back to Erika's from downtown (SCORE!). The morning we walked to a local brunch spot and enjoyed some food and breakfast cocktails. The rental is exactly like it's pictured. It is clean, fresh, well decorated, and super accommodating. Book it and enjoy! :-). "

3354614,18882133,2014-09-02,3251339,Betty,"Erika was wonderful. We had a quick chat on the phone and was able to coordinate everything over the call. I stayed with my boyfriend and three other friends. The rug added an extra level of comfort for those crashing on the floor. Noise levels during the night was super quiet. The color schemes for each room were wonderful. Although we didn't spend much time in the place, it was a great home to come back to after going to PAX for four days.  I recommend staying here. It's in a perfect location. Not too far away from downtown Seattle but far enough for the noise level to be quiet enough to sleep. "
3354614,28583141,2015-03-26,12343126,Thomas,"Very nice and big apartment as described, Erika was very friendly and recommended us good places to visit is Seattle. Great stay !"

I stayed with a friend, the place is spacious and the two sleeping areas work well. I'd definitely recommend staying with Erika in Seattle!"
3354614,29629263,2015-04-10,27232491,Js,"I think Erika was one of the best hosts although it was my first time to use airbnb.  everything was good including location, the house, the city, and public transportation. we felt so comfortable that we couldn't  stop making noise. (I was very sorry about that) nice stay!"
3354614,33721212,2015-05-31,12828170,Jessica,"Erika was a great hostess and very accommodating.  We had an open dialogue and my husband and I really enjoyed our time at her home.  The unit was huge, well decorated, clean and private.  It was a real treat to be able to wash clothes as well.  The neighborhood and neighbors in Madrona were great as well.  Really enjoyed the wine bar on Union and pub quizzes in Madrona Ale House too!  All in all a great experience!  I highly recommend Erika and her home!"
3354614,34743733,2015-06-11,34858343,Cheryl,"Erika made me feel very welcome. She greeted me at the cab and was kind enough to guide me (and the cab driver) to the apartment.  The apartment was huge and more than enough space for 1 person, so definitely large enough for up to 4.  I was in town for a conference in downtown Seattle and it was ~$1-15 for an Uber one way downtown which was a 15 min ride.  There's a bus stop around the block and I used that to connect to the Light Rail that goes to the airport. Overall, pretty good!"
3354614,36095218,2015-06-25,9355611,Skipper,"Erika was a super host.  The space was awesome and super clean.  There is a big living space that had access to a TV with tons of movie options on it as well as netflix.  The space was plenty cool during the summer.  The bed is cozy and the pillows are really comfortable.  The bathroom is roomy enough for multiple people to get ready in and the bathtub/shower is immaculate.  Loved loved the location, its quite close and easy proximity to downtown and others areas of Seattle.  Erika was also available for any questions that came up during our stay just relating to seattle/traffic etc...  Would stay at her place again next time we come to the area.  "
3354614,36463424,2015-06-28,14640153,Rene,"Great host. Great spot! Loved our stay. Would highly recommend. Could not have picked a more perfect area to stay in. Close short uber ride to convention center, downtown, and even closer restaurants/bars. "
3354614,36782404,2015-07-01,16530814,Andrea,"Loved our trip to Seattle and felt very comfortable at Erika's.  It's a safe, cozy space in a warm neighborhood.  Thanks for everything!"
3354614,38410994,2015-07-15,31245433,Virag,"Erika was welcoming, she was very responsive to questions and check in with us before we got there. She offered advice on where to go and what to see. Her place is inviting, spacious and comfortable, it was a great spot to recover in after long days of touring Seattle. The neighborhood was a good surprise with its many Ethiopian restaurants within a few blocks of Erika's place - our family loves Ethiopian food. We were very satisfied with our stay, thank you Erika!"
3354614,38669640,2015-07-17,12560705,Daniel,"Erika was a welcoming host. She was flexible about checkin time, accommodating, and responsive. 

She provided some great recommendations and cues to explore the neighborhood, which was very helpful since I'd never been on this side of town before.

Very accessible to downtown/etc,  via cheap uber rides.

The place is spacious, charming and very comfortable. I was in town for work and looking for a place to chill out at the end of the day, and get to get a sense of the city vs being stuck in a hotel, and this was perfect. 
"
3354614,40581707,2015-08-01,33125835,Emily,"My boyfriend and I were here for a week and we had a not so great experience. The listing description was very accurate accept for the fact that the amenities were very poor. No paper towels, toilet paper or silverware when we arrived. It was incredibly loud above us considering this is the basement of her home. The noise and amenities were the biggest issue. I was told there was no AC in the space and asked if I should bring a fan. I was told no and that it stays very cool downstairs. Not true. It was extremely warm which brought on a lot of moths. The neighborhood was awesome and the bus stop was across the street which was great. I would only recommend staying here if you have a very short trip to Seattle. "
3354614,41093860,2015-08-04,36003347,Ashley,"This was an extremely clean and private spot in an awesome neighborhood. Erika was very accommodating and overall a great hostess. She was willing to work around our schedules as we were flying in from across the East coast and didn't know what to expect in terms of public transportation and travel times. The space was really spacious and well-decorated, and we had a very comfortable overall stay. Thanks again for having us!"
3354614,42395223,2015-08-13,16252282,Matthew,"Erika's place was pretty nice and in a good location. You'll stay below her house in a renovated basement living space.  As listed, there is no kitchen or anything, but it was an enjoyable house to stay in. 

You can hear almost everything upstairs that is happening and I assume the same can be said for the people upstairs hearing us. So when we came home one night late and were talking, we got a message the next day that we were too loud.  So I think a library voice is needed not to be heard in this house.  

Like I said, location and house were very acceptable.  Seattle is beautiful in August and every day was gorgeous.  

Erika might need to reevaluate how she interacts with guests.  At one point while we were out on our day, we received  a text from her in which she stated that her internet and TV were not working and asked us more or less what we did to mess up her internet, suggesting we changed her password through the TV or something bizarre. Instead of just talking through the issue, she got very accusatory immediately, which isn't good for someone hosting people trying to have a stress-free vacation.

Also, my friend was out in Fresno for business so we had him join us in the apartment.  Erika greeted me by saying we needed to leave because we had 7 people and only made a reservation for 2.   I correctly showed her we had a reservation for 4 and added a person. Again, she needs to learn not to freak out and create a stressful situation when it can be talked out like adults.

This may have been her first hosting gig and I know she has children so she might have been overly stressed, but if you are going to host you need to relax a little more and don't accuse us of changing your wi-fi passwords and overbooking by 5 people (she counted the uber we got from the train station driver in her calculation).     Lastly, we had a private place but one of her kids was in our space downstairs when we got home. Normally I wouldn't care but she had been kind of mean towards us before that so I thought it was odd she couldn't keep our space private.

I think her place is nice and she could be  a good host. The last few days went fine, as did checkout. Hopefully she makes improvements."
3354614,48942494,2015-09-29,33571357,Jack,"The listing description was very accurate and we had a lovely stay! The place was in a very nice and beautiful area.

We relished our time curled up on the couch in front of the fireplace. The suite is decorated in Piper's special touch and looks and feels high end. The bed is very comfortable and provided a good nights sleep. The location of the suite is another bonus, very close to great shopping at the University Village shopping center. We would highly recommend the Green Suite and hope to go back sometime soon!   "
48848,140866,2010-11-17,277102,Ruta,The Green Suite was a perfect getaway. The interior design was a refreshing quality of contemporary accents. The fire place was a huge plus!....

Impeccably designed, cozy, stylish and warm, the accommodations were perfect for our quick visit to Seattle. I wished we could stay longer, to better get to know our hosts, to enjoy the comfort of staying in, preparing a nice meal for visiting friends, getting the kids ready for school, yard work... Oh, wait... We instantly did feel at home. On a lark, we watched Singles (1992) using the Netflix access with the provided blu-ray player. So, we geek-ed out on a bit of modern technology while luxuriating in the simple warmth of our beautifully designed household. I also have to say how grateful we are for Kent and Piper generously allowing us to bring our dog. It is such an excellent gesture to be dog-friendly, and to accommodate responsible pet-travelers in that way, without anxiety. We hope to stay again. Thank you Kent and Piper. We highly recommend the Green Suite."
48848,261131,2011-05-12,506966,Julie,"Piper has created a truly lovely place to stay.  She has thought of pretty much everything you could possibly need on top of being a fabulous hostess!  We really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend it to anyone else.

"
48848,598164,2011-10-04,454905,Patricia,"Fantastic in every way. great location. COMFORTABLE bed, wonderfully equipped kitchen (although true chefs may want to bring their own knives) quiet and beautifully decorated. fast internet connection, blu ray disc player. No IPOD connection, so bring your own if that matters to you, although we enjoyed the jazz and blues CD's on hand. I will definitely stay again. I don't have a dog, but all the floors looked easy to clean, in case of pet accidents."
48848,744540,2011-11-26,451668,Kimberly,"We had a terrific stay with Kent and Piper at the The Green Suite in Seattle. It's a beautifully done and inviting apartment. As soon as we arrived we felt immediately at home also thanks to the fact that Kent and Piper have thought of everything – there were shampoo and soaps in the bathroom, (environmentally sensitive) detergent for the washer, freshly ground coffee for the coffee maker and logs waiting for us in the fireplace. The perfectly designed kitchen, stock of board games, WiFi, bathtub and flat screen TV are enough to keep anyone happy on a rainy Seattle day. The nearby lake is also perfect for a relaxing walk. We highly, HIGHLY recommend the The Green Suite to any and everyone! "
48848,803405,2011-12-24,1257311,David,"Excellent experience!! The apartment is clean, cozy, private, everything worked perfectly. The host is pleasant and attentive, but not obtrusive. The place looks exactly like the photos. Super convenient private entrance and only two blocks to the lake. I plan to stay here again.   "
48848,1273089,2012-05-13,2258713,Lisa,"I stayed in the Green Suite for a full week back in May.  It was perfect!  First, We got in late and Piper made it easy to get into the apartment without waking anyone up.  Second, the apartment is beautiful, exactly like you see in the pictures.  Third, the location is great.  It's near all the major roads and highways which makes it easy to get to downtown Seattle, the airport or anywhere else you might be traveling.  Lots of good grocery stores around to stock the fridge and restaurants.  We covered a lot of ground so this was a perfect launching pad for our adventures. "
48848,2181747,2012-09-03,3181130,Molly,"Piper and Kent were wonderful! Very communicative and gracious.
The place was fantastic too! Exactly like the photos. We would come back again! Thank you Piper and Kent!"
48848,2578198,2012-10-11,2083631,Lois,"We stayed four weeks in the ""green suite"" and found it to be exactly
as advertised. It was well located, comfortably decorated, and in a safe family neighborhood. This was our first experience using Airbnb and it was very positive. As ""seniors"", we would definitely recommend to others!"
48848,4252961,2013-04-22,4954251,Cherie,"Loved our stay at the ""Green Suite""!  The location can't be (email hidden)ose to a large park, bike trail, shopping and the U of W. Situated in a lovely residential neighborhood with on street parking directly outside the apartment.  The owners live upstairs so if there are any issues or questions, they're close by.

The apartment was very comfortable, clean and more than adequate. Cutely furnished with a great closet so you can feel really settled.  The bathroom has a heated floor and a very modern sink/shower with also great storage for toiletries.

We hope to stay at the ""Green Suite"" again when we're in Seattle visiting our adult children!"
48848,5096367,2013-06-12,1555998,Genevieve,"We had a great time at the Green Suite!  Piper and her family were excellent hosts and provided everything one could need.  The location was awesome: quiet, near trails and parks, easy parking, etc.  The apartment was very roomy and well-suited for our traveling family.  We really appreciated Piper + Kent's home away from home. Thank you!"
48848,5211720,2013-06-18,6296692,Susan,"Our stay at the Green Suite was wonderful! The place looks just like the pictures. We loved the decor of the place. Made us feel right at home. The heated bathroom floor was a bonus. Piper was a wonderful hostess. We were having a little trouble with the TV and she happened to be upstairs so she came down right away. Credits to her adorable daughter for helping us figure out the cable issue. She's a smart little one. We were out and about almost all day while we were there so unfortunately we didn't get to take advantage of the spacious kitchen or the fireplace.

The neighborhood is very nice and quiet. It's a great location and not too far from downtown Seattle. You won't regret staying at the Green Suite! (:"
48848,5261403,2013-06-21,2494180,E Patricia,"500 words are not enough to write about our experience in the Piper and Kent's Green Suite.  It should be called Green Sweet because it is one of the best places we've stayed; modern and very clean.  The place is immaculate and so comfortable.  It is nicely decorated and it has everything you need for your stay.  It is perfectly organized and it has extra everything: blankets, towels, pillows, etc.  The kitchen has everything we needed for our stay and more.  

The apartment is airy and open, we kept the windows open whenever we were there trying to enjoy Seattle's (website hidden) and eating there was a delight.  It felt very much like home.  

We rented a car and drove throughout the city and its outskirts.  Driving to the city's center was quite fast, regardless of the traffic.  There were nice places to shop for groceries around including Whole Foods, and Target wasn't that far either.  There are several parks around that we visited (we follow some of Piper's recommendations), as well as restaurants for either breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  The area was really quiet at night, so we were able to sleep peacefully after a day of excitement in Seattle. 

We were glad to recycle and compost and kept the Green Suite green.  

Our only regret from our stay was that we couldn't extend our vacation any longer.  I would definitely consider staying at the Green Suite again when we visit Seattle again.

Thank you Piper and Kent for helping our vacation be even better!"
48848,5289690,2013-06-23,2533382,Peter,"My in-laws stayed with Piper and kent and they absolutely loved it. Lovely flat, very clean. Nice location in a really lovely area of Seattle. Would definitely use them again! 

Peter"
48848,5433762,2013-06-30,6428523,Donald,It was very nice and quiet and clean.  In a great location and the renters were very nice and helpful. 
48848,6952011,2013-09-01,3023653,Jackie,"Just a WONDERFUL two month experience ! The Green Suite is spacious and decorated with flair and care. Piper and Kent are truly dog friendly, not just dog tolerant, and the nearby off leash dog park and beach are amazing.

You will need a car, but the location is so close to everything! Every Seattle friend who visited remarked  on the quiet location and clean air. Loved returning to this wonderful place after an exciting day spent exploring Seattle.

Piper and Kent are very responsive to any questions or requests but  totally respectful of one's privacy.  Really felt  like my pup and I were in our own home.

Loved this place and my hosts so much that I will be returning for three months in 2014. You can't go wrong by booking the Green Suite. Don't miss the Saturday Market Dinner at the Sand Point Grill and shopping at City People's !"
48848,23742000,2014-12-09,6877259,Jarry,It was such a great experience in the green house. The place is modern designed in every details and is located in a nice and peaceful neighborhood with park and ocean views just in walking distance. The hosts have provided every help I needed but leave me to have the quiet enjoyment. The good living leads me to have a very good impression for city of Seattle. I want to say thank you and all the best to Piper and Kent! 
48848,24884032,2015-01-03,10815446,Douglas,Great stay.  Our German Shepherd puppy loved the place--very close to the amazing Magnuson Dog Park and the hosts were totally dog friendly.  The suite was super comfortable with outstanding amenities.  I love staying at a place that's nicer then my own!  Great Lake Washington and mountain views as you walk the quiet neighborhood.  We will definitely look for staying at the Green Suite the next time we visit Seattle.
48848,30072569,2015-04-17,21781121,Gregory,"My husband, baby, dog and I had a wonderful 3 month stay at Piper & Kent's great Green Suite. Piper & Kent were both very accommodating and quick to respond about replacement lightbulbs etc. The location was wonderful and very close to a wonderful park on Lake Washington. It was a very comfortable apartment with plenty of space. The kitchen had all necessities! Thanks for the hospitality, Piper & Kent!"
48848,36664022,2015-06-30,4180788,Michelle,"I arrived at Piper and Kent's place and was traveling with my elderly mother and our little Shih Tzu dog. It had been a very long and hot day driving to Seattle from Eastern Washington and although the temperature was also unusually high in Seattle, the Green Suite was excellent - refreshing, cool, and very comfy. Piper and her charming and knowledgeable daughter met us at the apartment to help us with entry and keys and then they gave us a lovely tour of the digs to help us get settled in. They were very kind, welcoming, and hospitable. Love, love, love the space and all of Piper's attention to detail, style, and sustainability. Especially loved the kitchen and awesome spa bathroom, as well as the lovely neighborhood, views of Lake Washington, the close proximity to the Magnuson Park dog run, and the beautiful blue hydrangeas outside the apartment entryway."
1696194,11284007,2014-03-28,3115578,Emma,"We very much enjoyed our stay on the ocean front, talk about location, location and location. Both the mornings and evenings sun rise/ setting was spectacular. The kids loved the fire pit every night, s'mores galore.
Thanks"
1696194,14527470,2014-06-21,16339986,Anis,"The whole experience was surreal. Just so happened that Bill was there my arrival night and helped me settle in, showed me around the property, even invited me to join them for a fire.
The place was great, nice and clean. Very relaxing.  Had everything I needed (towels, extra blankets, pillows, etc) and then some. I found the most delicious tea in the cabinet.
The neighbourhood was great, really quiet and the neighbours were nice.  Just a 10 minute walk to the Albertson's for groceries, and the pubs, restaurants in the neighbourhood. 
My whole experience here was just amazing and I am definitely going back. "
1696194,14619828,2014-06-23,15232248,Taylor,"I could not recommend this listing more highly.  The location is absolutely gorgeous.  Panoramic waterfront views, surrounded by mountains.  The host was very nice to work with as well."
1696194,15049270,2014-07-01,12095957,Rita,"The Ocean Front Beach Bungalow was one of the most wonderful places I've ever stayed in my life.  The waves from the Puget Sound splash right up against the patio at high tide -- they lull you to sleep at night and greet you in the morning.  There's always something to watch, the boats, the birds, the shifting sun on the mountains, the lights of the city.  The cottage itself is adorable -- small but well-crafted with everything you need.  The immediate neighborhood is a lush green park with residential areas beyond, plus the center of Magnolia is a short walk away with a wonderful farmer's market on Saturdays (great food, fun local music).  And all the fun of downtown Seattle is just a ten minutes drive.  William and Mary made sure our needs were met without being intrusive.  I can't say enough to recommend the place.  I'd stay there again in a minute."
1696194,15905945,2014-07-18,255230,Sylvia,"My husband and I had a wonderful time at the Beach Bungalow.  We were in town to visit friends/family for a week and ended up inviting many over to visit while we were there and they all loved it, too!  It was 90 degrees in Seattle that week and it can get toasty inside but the lower level stays cooler.  We ate at Palisades/Maggy's twice which is just around the corner but the path to walk there is a little difficult so we drove.  We barbecued one night when 3 others came over and the kitchen is well stocked and barbecue works well.  Sunsets were gorgeous and it was fun watching the cruise ships.  The hosts communicated efficiently and gave us 2 free nights when they made an error on our booking.  They were very gracious.  You do share the patio with the renters next door so there may not be a lot of privacy if they are outside on their side of the patio at the same time as you."
1696194,16903878,2014-08-04,16823851,Angela,"Wonderful place to stay in Seattle! It was a great location, in a really safe neighborhood. It was tranquil and serene, and I loved the view of the ocean and hearing the sound of the waves from the downstairs bedroom.  The kitchen is stocked with everything you would need. Ample choices for sleeping arrangements: a VERY comfy king bed, queen air mattress, and queen mattress in the loft. The fire pit was awesome, and the owners even provided all the wood for fires overlooking the beach. We will definitely be staying here again the next time we visit Seattle!"
1696194,17336137,2014-08-11,12416198,Katy,Just getting home after a wonderful week in Seattle. The bungalow definitely made this part of our trip worthwhile. You cannot beat the view. The sunsets are amazing. The host is very communicative. The price is right. Would definitely recommend!
1696194,31932629,2015-05-12,16925177,Amy,"The Ocean Front Beach Bungalow was exactly as described. We did have some difficulty finding the house. One Google maps app told us it was on the upper part of the street then another showed it on the lower, where it really is. The view is amazing. We even caught a glimpse of Mount Rainier on a few of the clear days. And we had everything we needed -- even skewers for s'mores! Because it's right on the waterfront, there isn't anything within walking distance, but there are amenities a short car ride away. And the trip into the city is very easy. William was a great host, accommodating our early check in and late check out. The house was exactly what we wanted: a quiet ocean getaway in the evening after a day of sightseeing. The only thing it needed was a pair of binoculars so we could be sure those were seals we spotted in the water."
1696194,36674445,2015-06-30,4014840,Johanna,Perfect beach cottage near downtown Seattle. We really enjoyed our holiday here. The views were amazing!
1696194,47719076,2015-09-21,41322077,Stefanie,"The house is perfect for relaxing at the water's edge. Great fire at night, wonderful grilling equipment. Everything we needed for a fabulous stay in Seattle."
1696194,49777960,2015-10-06,17796573,Heather,"Excellent from start to finish. William was very easy to work with and got back to me right away when I contacted him. He provided great information for what to do in the surrounding areas and let us check out late on our last day. Huge help with our two boys in tow. The views from this property are unparalleled. Nothing fancy about the front ""deck"" area but all the fixings for great fires and smores. I would be so content waking up to the big windows and sounds of the water every morning. Bedroom was beautiful and the living area was small but very well equipped. We would definitely chose this area to stay again and have wonderful memories after staying at this property! "
6954984,55514900,2015-12-01,43007304,Kasi,"Jennifer's place was BEAUTIFUL and in a great location.  We had so much fun while staying at her place on Capital Hill, and were able to walk everywhere.  Perfect place to stay whether this is your first time in Seattle or not, we felt very safe and enjoyed the neighborhood very much."
6954984,56143712,2015-12-09,23993647,Jonathan,"Staying at Jennifer's apartment was a terrific experience. Just as stylish and comfortable as expected from her posting and very conveniently located within Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. Moreover, Jennifer was very quick to respond to any questions that arose. Overall, a terrific experience. "
6954984,56561017,2015-12-14,12149838,Justin,"Jennifer's apartment is top notch, it's a very safe quite building in a really fun part of town.  My girlfriend and I had a wonderful visit and only wished we could spend more time.  She has a very well outfitted kitchen and we slept very well in the comfy bed.  She also arranged parking for us which was a huge relief because parking can be a challenge in the city.  Definitely recommend and look forward to visiting again."
1956094,9513520,2013-12-31,10684008,Anne,"Brian's suite is great! Perfect location in Ballard, just a short walk to the main drag full of restuarants, shops and bars. We didn't get to meet Brian as he was away, but Bo showed us in and gave us a helpful list of suggestions for the area. The suite is spacious, comfy and well put together. Felt like a home away from home!"
1956094,9985169,2014-01-23,1716772,Tristan/Robert,"Great place. Very clean, spacious, and comfortable, with many thoughtful touches. Brian was very considerate and easy to communicate with. Sensitive sleepers might find the furnace a bit loud, but earplugs helped a lot. Would definitely consider staying here again."
1956094,10159197,2014-02-03,790129,Daniel,"Brian was considerate and communicative prior to our stay, and left no unanswered questions regarding the property and our stay. The room we stayed in was cozy, comfortable, and spacious. We were also pleased that Brian was willing to accommodate the short length of our stay (just one night), which was an issue with other hosts."
1956094,10439598,2014-02-18,9038323,Dena,"What an awesome space! The bed was super comfy, and the kitchenette was more than sufficient. Brian was easy-going and flexible with our uncertain schedule, and was able to let us add an extra night at the last minute. LOVE the fact that he allows folks to stay for just one night. We will definitely consider returning next time we're in the area!"
1956094,10538117,2014-02-24,5580192,Alex Leigh,"Brian was easy to communicate with, and very helpful with any requests or questions I had. I love Ballard and for those who always breeze past it on the way too or from Seattle's downtown core, I highly recommend stopping to check it out. Brian's place is within walking distance of downtown Ballard and all it's awesome boutiques, restaurants, and bars and his basement suite is roomy, with a really comfy bed, and a great wall of boardgames for those so inclined. Would definately stay there again. "
1956094,10711419,2014-03-03,1126217,Randy,"Brian is an excellent host and his apartment is wonderful!  We spent a night here in Feb 2014.  The apartment is huge, the bed is comfy, and Brian thoughtfully has a coffee maker, microwave, and mini-fridge.  The location in Ballard is a ""10"".  My wife walked to our dinner reservation on Ballard Blvd., less than a mile away.  We plan on staying with Brian every time we go up to Seattle from Portland!"
1956094,11035354,2014-03-17,12972233,Nancy,"This was a very nice experience.  The finished basement was a good size, very clean, good amenities. It was quiet, in a nice neighborhood.  Brian was an excellent host. I highly recommend to others and would gladly stay there again."
1956094,11194947,2014-03-24,12991684,Jennifer,"The basement was very nicely finished and comfortable. We had a separate entrance and it felt very private which was nice. We enjoyed a movie on the projector and appreciated the toys available for our toddler. My only problem was with the bed which was soft for my taste. 

Ballard was a great place to stay. It was about 20 minutes from downtown and had some good breweries and restaurants. We would like to stay here again. "
1956094,11231635,2014-03-25,13042531,Andrew,"Brian's place was absolutely fantastic! The room was very comfortable and easily had space to sleep four adults. This was my first trip to Seattle and I had no problem locating Brian's place or getting around. The neighborhood is friendly and fun, and the house is located only a short drive from the locks or Gasworks park. I highly recommend staying here if you're visiting Seattle! "
1956094,11440388,2014-04-02,12544815,Leif,"This was our first AirBnB experience and Brian set the bar extremely high. He curated a very comfortable, thoughtful, and all around pleasant experience for our 3 night stay. The basement was clean, comfortable, spacious, and quiet. The location was perfect and within walking distance of downtown Ballard or a block away from the bus stop. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend a stay here to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Ballard."
1956094,12322272,2014-04-28,963408,Paul,"I stayed at Brian's place with two friends after we did a walking tour of Ballard's microbreweries.  His basement apartment was perfect for what we were looking for.  Brian was out of town so we never actually met, but he left excellent instructions about the place and a ton of information about things to do and places to see all around Ballard and Seattle. His basement apartment was very clean and in a great, quiet neighborhood. I will likely stay here again on my next trip to the Seattle/Ballard area. Highly recommended."
1956094,12679637,2014-05-07,10335166,Liz,Great spot! Took a lovely stroll down to Ballard for dinner and had great accommodations for the night. Brian was so flexible with our late arrival and we even became friends with the cat! Thanks again!
1956094,13124809,2014-05-19,3383070,Anne,Brian's place was clean and comfortable.  I had everything I needed for my night in Seattle.

Another good experience.  A nice, clean, comfortable, quiet space.  I hope to stay there again.  Lovely neighborhood!  Excellent host!"
1956094,14261963,2014-06-16,11417527,Donna,Brian was very informative and helpful; he gave us good guidance to make our way through the neighborhood with advice on where to eat and get supplies.
1956094,14411417,2014-06-18,16356688,Michelle,"Brian was friendly and easy to communicate with, and the place was simply furnished and exactly as pictured. Great neighborhood, great overall experience! I certainly recommend."
1956094,14785358,2014-06-26,15833585,Camille,"First AirBnB experience! Brian was really easy to communicate with prior to the trip and answered all my questions regarding ammenities, location, public transit, neighborhood - your typical stuff. He also offers a great deal of visitor materials for your trip.

ROOM: This is a basement unit, but you enter through the back of the house and only share the mud room with the rest of the house. It is essentially your own entrance, so if you want to stay low-key you can - plus Brian didn't seem to be home much during our four day stay. The room is massive and true to the description provided. 

LOCATION: A beautiful residential area! I'm grateful we rented a car because although there are bus lines nearby, it could take up to an hour to get to somewhere of interest for us - Fremont being much closer. And the Ballard district is just over a mile. Parking was easy, we did so in front of the house just as Brian promised. Parking was also relatively easy everywhere else we went.

OTHER: There is no lock on the door that connects the mud room to the basement. I was traveling with a friend, so this didn't bother me. If I were alone, it may be a different story. You can hear people's footsteps from the main house. It was loud and at times we could hear indistinct talking, which was not such a big deal. We would get in late at night and heard most of it only during the early mornings. 

I would definitely stay again. Thanks for a great stay!"
1956094,15131233,2014-07-03,10161779,Erin,"My family had a great stay at Brian's place. It was our first airbnb experience and we weren't disappointed. Great location (15 minutes to everywhere we wanted to go: Mariners game, Pike Place Market & ferris wheel, ferries) - seemed safe and lots of great shops and eateries nearby. Brian's basement was a great space for our family (mom, dad, and 5 & 7 year olds) -  lots of space for them to move, lots of (much appreciated - thanks!) toys and family movies to watch with the projector. Brian was a pretty much invisible host (I never saw him and hubby bumped into him once) but super easy to stay in touch with and quick to reply to texts asking for advice on where to eat, park, anything really. Also really appreciated the use of his back yard so kids could run around and we could enjoy a relaxing drink. Thanks for the great introduction to Seattle and airbnb, Brian!"
1956094,15520611,2014-07-10,16719119,Kathryn,"Brian is a great host.  He was quick to respond to my messages, and provided great suggestions for places to go and things to do in the area. The basement space was perfect for our one night stay in Ballard. Highly recommended."
1956094,15831526,2014-07-16,15479219,Jen,"Brian's basement apartment was great! The keypad lock system was great especially for us since we checked in later in the evening. The apartment was spacious and clean. The bathroom was stocked with clean towels and basic necessities like shampoo and soap. The projector was AWESOME for watching movies and hanging out on the couch. the space was everything we needed. We were able to come and go very easily. We would on occasion hear footsteps upstairs, but nothing bothersome. We would stay here again."
1956094,15944972,2014-07-18,14761367,Neha,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1956094,15978524,2014-07-19,17673003,Susan,"The neighborhood was great to walk around and there was plenty to see along with great restaurants and shops to explore. We also took the bus downtown which was easy. The space was clean and as expected; plenty of room for two of us. After a day out and about it was very comfortable to spend time relaxing at the house. The bed was comfortable and we felt at home. Nice to see a cat around and overall a wonderful experience.

1956094,16209381,2014-07-23,16394028,Ginger,"Brian's place was exactly what I needed. Convenient, quiet and comfortable. I took full advantage of the DVD projector, nice! He notified me in advance of a broken appliance and offered several solutions to accommodate my needs until repair was possible. Very gracious and much appreciated. Overall a perfect stay."
1956094,16251917,2014-07-24,522924,Jessica,"Great location,  beautiful garden, and bunnies! He was very good at communicating."

The area was spacious, cozy, and very convenient for using the bus system. Our boys especially enjoyed the toys and DVD projector. Beautiful neighborhood and an enjoyable walk to the Ballard locks. We were 110% satisfied with the accommodations and the host. Brian was very easy to communicate with prior to and during our stay. Thank you!!"
1956094,16543586,2014-07-29,2035925,Sam,"Lovely house, private basement flat with comfy bed! Brian very hospitable - helpful instructions on the local area (which is very nice). Great host and a great stay! "
1956094,16683541,2014-07-31,14689513,Pagaka,Brian was a great host. I appreciated his respect for our privacy. The space is cozy. It's located at a great location. 
1956094,16905711,2014-08-04,7154780,Joy,"Brian was away when we arrived but he provided us with very detailed instructions of how to get into the house and how to get settled with a list of  popular places, where to eat, and transportation methods. The privacy we had was exceptional. We loved his cat, Le Tigre, who minded his own business just as we did. The basement itself was very impressive, a lot of the amenities provided were extremely thoughtful and we thought the place was very clean as well. The place looked pretty much the same as the photos and the neighbourhood was quiet and reserved. It was a very good location in terms of local shops as well as the drive down to downtown Seattle and the airport was not bad at all. It's definitely a solid choice in terms of privacy and comfort."
1956094,17440232,2014-08-12,4670624,Jeanie,"I had an amazing time while visiting. Brian was away but made sure I was well informed of everything before arriving. The place is lovely, spacious and very clean. His notes and little welcome packet was helpful and definitely made things easier. Ballard is a great town! I would highly recommend staying here. "
1956094,18525232,2014-08-28,14315837,Blair,"This was a really comfy and big space near downtown Ballard.  We explored a lot just walking around.  We suggest the locks for sure.  The basement had a lot more than expected - lots of kitchen items, projector, toiletries and one of the best beds I've slept on.  So comfortable.  We hung out in the backyard both nights and had a few drinks (enjoyed the rabbits and cat - was missing our dogs back home).  Very quiet side street.  Would definitely stay here again.  Our first airbnb experience was great!"
1956094,18790580,2014-09-01,11000425,Julie,"Brian and his girlfriend were wonderful hosts! They said hi when we crossed each others paths but also respected our privacy. They provided us with a handy write up about the neighborhood, restaurants and brewery's to check out. The basement was very clean and all ready for us when we arrived on Friday afternoon. The description is very accurate. The basement was spacious, cool and dark (perfect for sleeping in). They have a fantastic selection of movies and games. The projector screen was really fun! The couch, bed and areo bed we all very comfortable. Brain provided sheets, pillows and blankets for the bed and areo bed that were super cozy. Brian provided clean towels and the shower has an awesome shampoo/conditioner/body wash caddy! The little kitchen area was very handy. We loved the neighborhood. There are so many rad restaurants and  shops within walking distance. I would highly recommend staying here and if I am back in Seattle I will stay here again! A cute bonus are the rabbits outback and the adorable kitty cat :) "
1956094,19249229,2014-09-08,15392052,Nancy,Brian has a great spot which is large and as advertised. My friend and I felt quite comfortable there and would definitely stay again. Brian responded to questions promptly. 
1956094,19540263,2014-09-14,20181438,Christine,"What a wonderful experience in Ballard! The place was great and so spacious, really close to the shops and restaurants in Ballard. Highly recommended!"
1956094,19709546,2014-09-16,5825506,Amy,"We loved Brian's place in Ballard! Very comfortable & quiet accommodations in a great neighborhood. Brian's thoughtful and thorough recommendations for everything Ballard and beyond had to offer helped us get the most out of our stay, and he was a very agreeable, easy-going host! We became good friends with the bunnies on the back deck and found it hard to say goodbye. We'd for sure stay again!"
1956094,19965833,2014-09-21,20828990,Sohel,"This was our first Airbnb experience and the stay at Brian's place has definitely helped reinforce the use of Airbnb for our future trips. Brian communicated with us in a timely manner and provided all the necessary information needed for our stay prior to our arrival. The place is exactly how it has been described in the listing. It is cozy, clean, spacious and well lit with lots of natural light, giving no indication that this is a basement room. The beds (including the aerobed) were quite comfortable. Its also kid friendly with variety of toys and movie selection to keep the kids entertained. The location (in Ballard) is easily accessible via public means to and from downtown Seattle and it is located in a quiet neighborhood. The vicinity to Ballard locks is also a plus. I definitely recommend this place if you are considering staying in Ballard while visiting Seattle."
1956094,20061748,2014-09-22,21270869,Rosemary,"Great first stay in an AirBnB room. Everything was exactly as described by Brian--private, clean, comfortable, quiet.  A nice air mattress was set up for me, the third person.  We especially enjoyed watching a movie on the large screen, with the very comfortable couches. My brother in law used the free weights the next morn, which was nice. If you are taller than about 5'10"", note that the ceiling is low in a few places--my bro-in-law had to duck as he passed under the air ducts. Wifi was fast and convenient.  And of course, Ballard is a great location.  It was a 5 minute drive to the restaurant area, and the next morning it was a straight shot to downtown on 15th Ave.  A great stay overall, and a good price. "
1956094,20131327,2014-09-23,1776713,Caroline,"Brian was a great host. The place was ready for us upon arrival and was very comfortable. He even set up an airbed for us. The sheets and towels were soft and fresh and he left a detailed list with helpful information about the house and the neighborhood, including recommended dining options. Overall a great experience and I would definitely stay again! "
1956094,20388934,2014-09-28,18820458,Crane,We really loved our stay at Brian's. The space was very comfortable and had everything to fit our needs for the night. It was very conveniently located for ease of access to different neighborhoods in Seattle. Definitely would stay again.
1956094,21174239,2014-10-12,7660653,Beth,"When we arrived, my husband was impressed with my skills at finding us such a great place. It was exactly as listed. We weren't in Seattle for long, but this was an ideal place to stay. The location was great - easy to get to public transportation or you could walk if you feel like a longer stroll. The finished basement was clean, comfortable, and inviting. Thank you, Brian! If you are planning to stay longer than we did, there was lots of Seattle-specific travel literature provided. "
1956094,21320514,2014-10-14,20179676,Andy,Very good with communication via text. Answered all of our questions throughout our stay. Very accommodating to our needs. Clean and spacious private basement 5 minute drive to downtown ballard. Would stay here again. 
1956094,21589669,2014-10-20,8858298,Brian,"We didn't get a chance to meet Brian, but his cat LeTigre was there to meet us and send us on our way for trips out. The neighborhood was quite nice and close to a few shops. We mostly hung out with some friends on the other side of town so we didn't spend a lot of time or around the house. I  personally enjoyed the projector and comfy couch the most. "
1956094,21900714,2014-10-26,9104393,James,"We had a great weekend at Brians home in Ballard! Although we never got to meet Brian, he still served to be an excellent host. The house instructions were simple and straightforward and he provided us with everything we needed for the weekend stay. There was also a super awesome collection of strategy board games in there (i went geek mode). The location was convenient and was close to everything my gf and I wanted to see in Ballard and the surrounding area. Overall, an excellent stay at Brians!"
1956094,22858688,2014-11-16,15962628,Tyler,"Brian was great at getting me the information I needed before arriving. Although he wasn't available immediately upon my arrival, he greeted us and offered tips for the neighborhood once we'd crossed paths. The space was clean and spacious just like in the pictures. The description matched perfectly. The neighborhood was also beautiful and not far from Ballard hotspots. "
1956094,22969253,2014-11-18,5252016,Alan,Very nice and cozy place to stay. Comfy bed and good shower. Exactly as described. Would recommend!
1956094,23141429,2014-11-23,11308417,Alexandra,"What a wonderful home!  Brian was a great host. He was very quick to respond and provided great instructions for getting to, and entering the home. The basement is completely separate from the rest of the home; it's like a wee flat with all the necessities. There is a wonderful kitchenette, with all the provisions you'd find in a kitchen. Brian thoughtfully put out extra bedding for my son and niece, 14 and 15 respectively. The basement was extremely clean and looked exactly like the posting. There were so many things to entertain: projector movies, a fantastic selection of music, and an array of board games. My son, who is a history buff,  said we were meant to stay there, as there were a great selection of WWII board games and movies. The home is in a great neighborhood and very close to downtown. We went to the UW football game Saturday night, and the Seahawks game on Sunday. Perfect location. Brian cheerfully greeted us in the morning, and my kids walked out saying how much they loved their stay and how cool Brian seemed. That speaks volumes...they are both teenagers. We will definitely book there again and highly recommend it to others. Thanks, Brian!  Cheers, Alexandra, Cole, and Courtney"
1956094,23238930,2014-11-26,7129902,Karen,The space was very nice. Clean and cozy.
1956094,24315837,2014-12-25,25015507,Natalie," My parents, my husband and I stayed here and it was a perfect place for us to stay.   Brian made it really easy to come and go at odd hours without bugging him, which was what we needed as we were spending most (late) evenings over at my brother's house, which was within walking distance.  The kitchenette was pretty minimal and if you actually need to do cooking you will need to inquire about using the larger kitchen.   Brian was a very clear communicator."
1956094,25552438,2015-01-19,25013682,Michael,Our stay was just perfect.  Brian provided us everything we needed and was available by text if we had any questions.  The space was very comfortable and convenient.  We had a great weekend.  Thanks very much!
1956094,26408974,2015-02-11,3597702,Joseph,"Brian's place was exactly as described. Easy check in and in a great neighborhood. There is a ton of floor space and although we were only there a night, I think it would be great for a longer stay."
1956094,26762898,2015-02-18,7074218,Amy,"Brian left great information about the area, which helped us get familiar with the neighborhood. His charming cat was a wonderful greeter, too. "
1956094,26943416,2015-02-22,7064551,Nicolle,Super easy and well set up! We had a great time in the Ballard neighborhood. Loved the coffee set up and the outdoor space. 
1956094,28771008,2015-03-29,13358406,Alissa,"We had such a great experience staying at Brian's. The place was bigger than expected, clean, and very nice. The shower was awesome. Would love to stay here again!"
1956094,29806654,2015-04-12,30095777,Joseph,Great location with plenty of living space and privacy. Clean and organized.
1956094,30886056,2015-04-28,4276028,Melissa,Brian was very helpful and friendly. The space was spacious and comfortable in an excellent location. Thanks again Brian!
1956094,30968856,2015-04-29,4276028,Melissa,Thank for everything!
1956094,32685980,2015-05-20,23466317,Alex,"Brian's space was clean and comfortable. The bed and air mattress were both better than some hotel beds I've slept on before. The location is great; you can walk to downtown Ballard or catch a bus anywhere else in the city from the front yard, essentially. Brian was very friendly and accommodating, and even offered us a ride back to the airport. All that said, I'd stay at Brian's again just for the terrific shower. "
1956094,33372917,2015-05-27,16972140,Deena,"I really loved the neighborhood, and the rabbits and cat were a cute touch! Brian was very friendly when we came, but we didn't see each other after the first day. The basement had a really nice setup, and it was super convenient to have two beds (one ended up being comfortable for me, while the other was best for my girlfriend). One thing to note is it has low ceilings! I'm 5'7"" and I very easily touched the ceiling. An issue I had was that there was a little less privacy than I would have liked-- the key to the basement was jammed into the lock, which made the door difficult to fully close, so we found the door open on a few occasions when we arrived or woke up. The bathroom window didn't have a covering, so although the window wasn't facing anything besides the back yard, it still felt weird to not have the option to have full privacy in the bathroom. There was also a vent in the basement that was really loud, so whenever the heater was turned on at night or early morning, it would wake us up. Other than that, it was a great place, really spacious and comfortable, and a wonderful location, and I would definitely stay there again if those issues were fixed. "
1956094,34569487,2015-06-09,9357701,Jt,"What a big space and what a lovely part of town! Brian was a gracious host, he provided a clean and comfortable environment. He was very prompt in responding to any communiques and helping us with anything we needed. Le Tigre was quite the lovely outdoor and cat and indeed, the shower was great. I would most certainly stay here again when I visit Seattle next. "
1956094,34659379,2015-06-10,33533871,Diane,Very nice place to stay clean and comfortable. It met our needs for our evening in Ballard. Neighborhood is nice and walking distance to downtown. We did not get to meet Brian but he had everything in place and was responsive when we had questions about our stay. 
1956094,34990283,2015-06-14,20821020,Natalie,"Brian was an amazing host, and the space we stayed in was far beyond our expectations. Every detail added to our great experience... The projector, the comfy couch and bed, and spacious room... We couldn't have imagined a better place to relax after picking up my sister from UW. 
Brian also kindly went above and beyond to return a makeup bag that meant a lot to me! Thanks again!"
1956094,35661944,2015-06-21,32020438,Jamie,"This was my first Airbnb experience. Brian was great. Although we never met he was VERY accommodating. We had our agenda and he had his I'm sure. Brian's place has big, very clean, quiet and very close to the bus line. We talked about staying again if we were in the neighborhood. "
1956094,36520988,2015-06-29,29352914,Kaneeks,"The house was in a great neighborhood, easy to find and navigate through without GPS!  Brian made a great map of things to do, and places to go. His place was very kid friendly, I made dinner for my boys, we watched movies and made ourselves at home for the night."
1956094,39052653,2015-07-20,5131561,Michelle,We had a great time staying at Brian's! Very comfortable set-up in the basement in an awesome neighborhood! He had great suggestions on things to do and places to eat and drink in the area which was super helpful! 
1956094,39257997,2015-07-21,2957765,Sam,Great. Easy. Convenient. Comfortable. Clean. No problems. :) Loved how quiet and dark the bedroom was. Slept well.
1956094,39346141,2015-07-22,38694191,Nanci,We very much appreciated Brian's quick response to our request.  The location of this home allowed us to walk to local stores and it was a perfect starting point for bike riding around Lake Union.  The home was very quiet and the bed very comfortable.
1956094,39925629,2015-07-27,32995727,Kim,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and it was a very positive one. Brian was great at responding to texts about anything, including tips about the area. There were helpful notes posted with relevant information about the place (how to lock up, magazines about the area, etc.)The place was very clean, comfortable and we particularly enjoyed making friends with Le Tigre.  Thanks for making our stay in Seattle great! "
1956094,40956755,2015-08-03,594342,Doreen,"We did a quick overnight and this listing was perfect. It was clean, comfortable, easy to find. Brian has a small makeshift kitchen area with everything needed to do a quick meal. We traveled with our son and Brian set up a nice aerobed for him. If we were to use AirBNB again in Seattle, we would book this (website hidden): We never met Brian because he respectfully left us alone. "
1956094,41101672,2015-08-04,18359972,Sara,"Fantastic location for a visit to Seattle. We took the bus from right near the house to downtown rather than battle traffic and parking and were please with how smoothly that went. Ballard is scenic and gave us a nice idea of that modern-mixed-Victorian residential part of the city. The local food options were fun and trendy too; we lucked out for an incredible breakfast and coffee at The Hen. Brian's suite was fine for a night, and our young kids loved all the toys. Thanks for a positive first experience with airbnb!"
1956094,42682136,2015-08-15,20812212,Yongmi,"Brian provided a lot of information about the unit and the area, check-in was smooth and we liked the neighbourhood and the easy transport connections downtown. However I couldn't call the place clean. The shower, bedding etc. were fine but the windows, windowsills, and shelves had been neglected. Dead flies, and some live moths, too. Definite basement smell. "

1956094,44026477,2015-08-23,40790787,Becca,"Brian was an excellent host. The basement was a great deal and had everything we needed. The ceiling was not too short, which another reviewer said it might be. This spot is the perfect place for a family to stay. My 4-yr-old asked Brian if he had any airplane toys and when we got back from our Seattle adventures several little planes sat on the welcoming table. It was a super sweet gesture that he went and found them for my little boy. I recommend this spot to anyone wanting to stay in the Ballard area."
1956094,44250978,2015-08-24,41920731,Emily,"Great location, huge space that is well set up for a quick layover in Seattle. Ample parking, easy access to coffee shops and parks. Very accommodating host who even set up a *nice* air mattress for our additional people. Thanks Brian!"
1956094,45729630,2015-09-05,41858866,Meghan,"Staying at Brian's home exceeded all expectations. Brian was kind, polite, and helpful. Most importantly, we felt we were more than welcome here. This place felt like home. The basement is spacious; the queen size bed is super comfy; the yard is ideal for a BBQ on a beautiful day. We hit the jack pot with this place! All in all, we will never stay at a hotel again if we can help it. Fantastic place! "
1956094,45861577,2015-09-06,1177672,Haven,"Three of us stayed at Brian's finished basement in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle overnight on Labor Day weekend.  The space is large, clean, quiet.  The location is very good, about a mile from good shops, bars, and Sunday outdoor market.
We met Brian briefly just before we left, and he gave us suggestions for touring the area."
1956094,46172070,2015-09-08,18778605,Robyn,Brian's private basement was perfect for us! It was clean and large and extremely comfortable beds and couches. All the amenities you would need. We had the pleasure of meeting Brian when we needed a favor and he was very accommodating. For three women traveling alone it was a very safe environment and neighborhood. This was our 2nd airbnb experience and we were delighted. Highly recommend. 
1956094,46296298,2015-09-09,40108215,Kathy,"Brian was a very good host- allowed our privacy, and was available to speak to when we were there. Very comfortable beds and great amenities! Loved the privacy!"

1956094,56546872,2015-12-14,4498015,Rachel,We had a relaxing time in Brian's basement! It was very private and spacious and easy to come and go late at night.
1956094,57074752,2015-12-21,370685,Paul,Great location and super clean place. The house looks haunted in the photo but it's just Seattle weather.
1956094,57810822,2015-12-29,617386,Chris,"Brian's spot was great, conveniently located close to all the great spots in Ballard. The sheets were amazingly comfortable and it was a good private stay. We thoroughly enjoyed it and will use it again."
1956094,57971077,2015-12-30,32643281,Janellah,"Great and cozy little place in the basement, very good location for those exploring Seattle. The best part was the projector provided because my friends and I had so much fun watching movies and relaxing after a long day out in the city. Kid friendly for those with kids! The host was very kind and easy to contact."
1781723,13110915,2014-05-19,506949,Christina,"Desdemona's home was wonderful! Unfortunately, she was out of town while we were there so we didn't get to meet, but she was very easily reached by cell. The house itself was very clean and neat, and the bed super comfortable. The neighborhood is great, too. A lot of places to explore, including coffee shops, bars, and restaurants. We didn't have a car, but it was still very easy to get around. We'd absolutely stay here again. "
1781723,13438051,2014-05-27,1420262,Shannon,"The experience of staying at Desdemona's place was wonderful. This was our first time visiting Seattle, and after doing some research, we zeroed in on Fremont because of its close-but-not-too-close proximity to downtown and after reading that it's a fun and artsy neighborhood. 
The house is about 2 blocks away from every bus route and store/restaurant we needed. It's also within very comfortable walking distance to some very nice bars on 36th street.

Desdemona accommodated us very professionally, giving us all the information we needed to access and stay at her home. She had prepared bus maps and information on local sights, and was very quick to respond to any communication. We only briefly saw her, as she was out most of the time, but her home is also very well equipped for privacy when needed. The home is supremely clean and tidy and has modern updates and a full kitchen, which was great to cook in, and there is plenty of common space where one can rest their legs from a long day in Seattle."
1781723,13496301,2014-05-28,7678373,Neha,"Loved our host. She was super hospitable and very friendly and accommodating. Her place is beautiful, well kept, and well located. Would not hesitate to stay here for a second!"
1781723,14208205,2014-06-14,6903424,Janna,"Desdemona had extremely good communication. Her place is easy to get into, and in a great neighborhood. You can walk to some nice places in Fremont from her place, and easily catch buses into other neighborhoods. My stay with Desdemona was very short, but comfortable, clean, safe, and welcoming."
1781723,15005106,2014-06-30,16726939,Kelsey,"This place was great! It is clean, well designed, and in a great location. It worked out perfectly for us! Thank you so much for the hospitality. We wouldn't have changed a thing. We will definitely revisit next time we come into town! "
1781723,16294254,2014-07-25,7027881,Emilio,"My wife and I really enjoyed our 10-day stay at Desdemona's. Her house is lovely, clean and very comfortable. Plus it is in a fantastic neighborhood, with yummy food and with easy access to public transportation. We did not meet Desdemona in person (she was out of town): we communicated mainly via airbnb messages/email.   She is super organized: she provided all the relevant information before we arrived and was always ready to address any questions we had while we where at her place. I would highly recommend Desdemona and her house.   "
1781723,18486483,2014-08-27,19069422,Maria,Desdemona was great! Very organized with detailed and specific instructions given. Her house is beautiful and spacious. Very clean house. Beautiful kitchen.  Comfortable bed although right at the front of the house so you can hear some street noises. Not really anything to bother me or worry about.  The neighbourhood is very quiet anyways. I stayed for 2 days and only physically saw Desdemona once just before I was leaving since she was away for the majority of the time that I stayed there. But she was great. .. checked in on me a couple times via text to make sure everything went smoothly. Texted me when she came home for the night and had gone out for a bit and had left the lights on at the house so I wouldn't be concerned when I got back.  Very thoughtful. Good location.  20 minute bus commute to downtown. Close to multiple bus stops.  Relatively convenient. 
1781723,19352417,2014-09-10,63815,Ruth,Great space in a wonderful section of Seattle.  User friendly and street parking was not an issue. All as presented on site
1781723,19491804,2014-09-13,20640343,Natalie,"Impeccably clean, modern interior (which I love), comfortable accommodation, exactly as described.. actually it did exceed my expectations. The host (Desdemona) was the most gracious and welcoming, caring about her guests. She sent me several messages so I knew exactly what to do and where everything is. 
The neighborhood was excellent, in the heart of Fremont, close to all the important places and restaurants (and close to my work)."
1781723,42110730,2015-08-11,27283459,Alexandre,We enjoyed our stay in Desdemona's. Her house is spacious and comfortable. the neighborhood is lovely and quite ! 20 min to go to the downtown !

She was out of town during our stay so we were unable to meet her however, she was very communicative through email and provided us with all the amenities we needed.  We would definitely stay here again."

1781723,45072119,2015-08-31,20311658,Simon,"Desdemona's place is really lovely and right in the heart of Fremont. Loads of cool stuff is walking distance. The room was great and the bed is super comfy. 

Desdemona herself is awesome - when we messed up on our Amtrak tickets she phoned the train company for us and sorted it all out. Desdemona = awesome!"
1781723,45814187,2015-09-06,239757,Soo,"Desdemona's house is in a great neighborhood and had all the amenities listed and pictured. We didn't see Desdemona much but she was accommodating and flexible with check-in and check-out.  I really liked everything about the place except that it was not so clean.  The tub and toilet needed cleaning and there were quite a few fruit flies about, which made eating in the house a bit annoying.  Otherwise a good value..!"
1781723,46280959,2015-09-09,38287014,Becky,"Desdemona was fantastic. The day before we arrived, she sent an email that included all of the special instructions we needed. It was super handy! 

We didn't get to see much of her because we were off adventuring, but when we did, she gave some great food recommendations and was incredibly friendly. And, after my shampoo leaked all over the inside of our toiletry bag (!) she offered to launder it for us. When we came home that night, it was hanging on our door handle, all clean!!

I would 100% stay here again. "
1781723,47310907,2015-09-17,12661920,Alex,"Desdemona's place is really beautiful, everything you could need and in a nice quiet area. Unfortunately we were on a tight schedule so didn't get much chance to see Desdemona as we arrived late and left early the next day. She made us feel welcome and we had a good nights sleep. "
1781723,47431489,2015-09-18,44053023,Alberto,"La habitación y la descripción en general es bastante precisa, hay mucha intimidad porque está en pisos independientes con respecto a la anfitriona. Desdemona fue muy eficiente a la hora de darnos instrucciones y consejos sobre la casa, fue muy hospitalaria y nos dio toda la ayuda que necesitamos (por ejemplo para cocinar nos facilitó todo lo que necesitamos, y la cocina está muy bien por cierto, tiene de todo). 
En cuanto al barrio, es bonito y muy tranquilo y hay restaurantes curiosos, está un poco apartado del centro aunque bien comunicado con buses. Repetiría sin duda."
1781723,48289840,2015-09-25,35812175,Mary Martha,I loved the neighborhood and that I could walk to downtown Fremont if I wanted. There were great food options nearby too. Desdemona was kind and hospitable. Thanks for sharing your space!
1781723,50183584,2015-10-10,31958446,Mike,"Desdemona was a fantastic host. Incredibly accommodating with a lovely home. Stay here if you can, it's a great find. "
1781723,50760469,2015-10-14,42333268,Michael,"Desdemona's home is nice and quiet and in a good neighborhood. She was great about leaving instructions for our arrival and making ourselves comfortable. The kitchen is huge and very modern. If you're looking for a very soft bed, this is the place for you. If you're 5'9 or taller, watch your head when exiting the shower!"
1781723,50856259,2015-10-15,7920609,Harshith,"Staying at Desdemonna's place was great! The neighborhood is quiet, but there is so much to do within a few minutes walk (Fremont Brewing Company, The Troll, Paseo's, etc.). Parking was easily and readily available on the street side, and the instructions for keyless house entry were very easy to understand. The house itself is very spacious and the room is spacious as well. It looks almost identical to the picture except now there is a small desk in the room. Desdemonna provided me with an iron and ironing board for my clothes, which was much appreciated! The bed was very soft and the bathroom, while separate from the bedroom was easily accessible and perfectly adequate with a shower. Overall, it was a great stay. "
1781723,50995739,2015-10-16,37371654,Michelle,"This house is amazing and desdemona was a lovely host, we arrived later than expected and needed to stay another night the room was booked out but she made room for us in another room anyway, we are very thankful other wise we would have had to leave early. 

The house is in a great location and has everything you could possibly need 
Would definitely recommend."
1781723,51192856,2015-10-18,10920782,Shawn,"This is a great room with a very nice host. We had plans of our own so we didn't see her much, but we enjoyed a clean and comfortable space that we could come and go from independently. Location is ideal!"
1781723,51682726,2015-10-22,34699619,Ryan,"Desdemona was a great host! She was very friendly and accommodating. The house was clean and had everything you would need for a weekend stay. The bed was super comfortable and house quite, which made for a great nights sleep. The neighborhood was in a great location, and a simple bike ride to local cafes and breweries. I will definitely consider staying here again if I am in the Fremont area!"
1781723,51759833,2015-10-24,11431389,Dominica,I had a great one-night stay at Desdemona's house.  We met only briefly but she was very friendly and welcoming.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again or recommend this as a place to stay.  Thank you!
1781723,51801821,2015-10-24,15246140,Mike,"Desdemona was super nice and let us arrive late.  Her house and neighborhood are as good as it gets with lots of Restaurants and establishments and good access to other areas.   Brought back lots of good memories and my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed itl  Room was big and bed comfortable.  Great Kitchen.

Thank you Very much!

Christine and Mike"
1781723,52618782,2015-10-31,31419418,Rachael,"Desdemona was absolutely lovely and the room is exactly as pictured. Her home is beautiful and on a quiet street, but not too far from all the activities going on downtown. Her instructions were clear and although we didn't get to see her much, our encounters were always warm and welcoming. Thank you for hosting us!"
1781723,53279928,2015-11-07,47226814,Md,We had a list of instruction sent before we came in and it was the perfect note that we could have. We hardly saw Des during our stay. There are couple of fantastic restaurants around her home. We had nice time out here and we felt at home.
1781723,53735717,2015-11-11,4873409,Ryan,Great room with comfy bed in a superb Fremont location.
1781723,53867644,2015-11-13,12181464,Rumbi,We made a last minute decision to stay in Seattle and Desdemona was very quick to respond and accommodating. Her home is in a vibrant and fun area and I wish I could have stayed longer. Her home was clean and quiet and had everything we needed. She is a fantastic host and I definitely recommend staying here!
1781723,53933833,2015-11-14,6212932,Janet,"Desdemona was super responsive even as we were booking the day before our stay and her instructions were really helpful. The room (and rest of the house) is lovely, cosy, and clean. The bed in the bedroom was ridiculously comfortable as well. Desdemona also gave us some nice recommendations for what to do in town during the rainy weather. Thanks for a great stay!
 "
1781723,53987183,2015-11-15,43489383,Lindsay,"Desdemona was a great host; helpful and informative with household stuff, bus lines, local eats, and was very gracious and accommodating! The room was exactly as pictured, spacious, uncluttered, and cheery and the bed was beyond comfy! The bathroom was also beautiful - it's a lovely and comfortable home.
The neighborhood was great and felt very safe, though to be sure, the parking situation got very tight the second it became weekend, which Desdemona also warned us about in advance!"
1781723,54327430,2015-11-18,46736898,Carl,Great place. Quiet and in an excellent location. Owner is friendly and accommodating.
1781723,54418521,2015-11-19,49095992,Lynsey,"Desdemonas house was beautiful. We never actually bumped into her, but her home was just perfect , plus the bed in our room was the absolute most comfortable bed I've ever slept in! The location was close to everything, just ideal. We'll definitely try to book the guest room here again when we come back to Seattle. "
1781723,54455465,2015-11-20,21342645,Elissa,"We arrive to Desdemona's in the evening and arrived early the next morning. We were able to find a parking spot right next to the house. The house was very clean, bed was comfortable, and neighborhood was quiet. It was nice to be able to walk to the nearby restaurants for supper. "
1781723,54961648,2015-11-25,23065011,Lydia,"Such a lovely home in a peaceful area. 
We found this place no problems and headed straight into down town via the bus. We never met Desdemona while we stayed there but the house was so nice, clean and welcoming. 
The bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in so nice! 
Would recommend staying here! "
1781723,55665455,2015-12-04,26276739,Rachel,"Desdemona was very welcoming and let us check in early. She also offered us the room in the basement if we preferred to each have our own rooms.  

The room was clean with lots of storage space. Seattle was colder than where we are from so the heater kept the space nice and warm. 

Highly recommend staying with Desdemona. I would love to stay here again for my next visit in Seattle.

1781723,56286891,2015-12-11,50184784,Tess,"Hi! Desdemona's home was warm, lovely and inviting "
1781723,56735055,2015-12-17,18097612,Lianne,"My experience here was wonderful! Desdemona's house is clean, well set up for guests, and in a great location! I would definitely stay here again if I return to Seattle."
1781723,56806267,2015-12-18,50075094,Marc,"Desdemona was very organized with all the information we needed to know about her place. She sent me an information sheet before check in which was very helpful. We were able to run into her when we arrived. She was very nice and welcoming. The room was perfect, especially the conveniency of the nearby bathroom. I'd highly recommend this place."
7807090,47280723,2015-09-17,30372497,Tina,"This apartment is perfectly located. It's easy to walk to Pike market,Space Needle, pretty much anywhere.  The apartment was clean and comfortably furnished. My family had a wonderful time stay in Jordan's place! Thank you!"
7807090,52504168,2015-10-30,2980222,Sarj,"Staying at the Arthouse was great!  Jordan was prompt in replying to my questions and made the whole process of renting the apartment easy. Our group was in Seattle to attend a conference at the Bell Harbor Conference Center and the Arthouse was the perfect location, only a couples minutes away using the Bell St. pedestrian bridge. Check in was a breeze using the instructions emailed to us. The apartment was as described, it was very clean and comfortable with plenty of room for 3 people. Wifi service was fast and reliable and the kitchen was well equipped. The sky lounge was awesome, luckily we got to use it between the rain in Seattle!  Overall we would definitely recommend staying at the Arthouse apartments and we plan to use it for future visits. "
7807090,55099833,2015-11-28,42048229,Karen,"This place was great. Well equipped kitchen  for a small family we even cooked Thanksgiving dinner!  View was awesome as was location. Walked to Pikes,  Space Needle and Ferries. Lots of resteraunts and bars close by.   Some street traffic noise but no more than expected for an urban location."
8342429,52759782,2015-11-01,45000955,Susannah,"This place is nothing short of amazing!! It could not have been in a better location. It was super clean and very welcoming. Rad view of some interesting buildings and a 15 min walk to all the stuff we wanted to do. Thank you, Jordan, for hosting us. It was an excellent first time in Seattle!"
8342429,55434415,2015-12-01,47868885,Jesse,Jordan was kind open and easy to coordinate with. The studio was as advertised. The neighborhood was energized and convenient. The studio was everything I needed for my Thanksgiving week.
8342429,55627800,2015-12-03,47744818,Alexander,"Jordan was very friendly and welcoming, he provided us with all the information we could ask about. The studio is clean and it feels like home right from the first moment. The view from the window is great. Location is walking distance to coffee shops and restaurants. I would definitely stay there again if traveling without a car. There is a slight difficulty with the parking, but we managed."
8342429,56307430,2015-12-12,11614414,Matt,"Jordan was super friendly and punctual. He left a wonderful list of local things to check out and left his info in case of emergency.

The apartment is in a great downtown location, so you can easily walk most places. If not, there are plenty of public transit options. The space is quaint and cozy. I highly recommend staying at Jordan's space next time you're in Seattle."
8342429,56729966,2015-12-17,1363491,Amanda,"Great little getaway! We stayed here 3 nights and were able to pack a lot into our short stay because of the location. So glad we didn't rent a car, the train from the airport was so convenient. Plenty of restaurants and little markets close by to grab waters, snacks, etc.  We would definitely stay again. "
8342429,56924470,2015-12-20,25441899,Victoria,"Jordan is so accommodating! And so kind! Everything listed is accurate and more. Great location. Quiet. Space is comfortable, inviting, and has lots of natural light. Thanks Jordan!!"
8342429,57302352,2015-12-24,2330563,Briah,Jordan was easy to get in touch with and responded quickly. The apartment is cosy and in a great location. Large windows make the space feel open. We easily walked around the neighborhood and grabbed a car if we needed to go farther.  Great spot! 
8342429,57925843,2015-12-30,17454665,Susie,"The listing was accurate.  It was easy to find and Jordan was pro-active about contacting us about our arrival time.  He had a friend meet us with the key and it was a pleasant, comfortable meeting.  I had questions about the TV, and Jordan's responses were prompt via texting.  The studio was clean, bed comfortable and kitchen useable!  We were able to make it dark for sleeping and opening the windows during the day was bright!  It's a block away from the movies.  I saw Star Wars while I was there! My local friends were able to find me easily.  There are restaurants and bars within minutes walking!  Fantastic location!  You do not need a rental car when you are staying here and I turned in my car just down the street at Hertz. Thank you.  I will be back for sure!  I love Seattle! "
140331,327296,2011-06-21,683888,Karyn,"This lovely house is on a hill in the woods with lots of beautiful plantings: a beautiful way to start the day before heading into the more urban parts of the city. If you like quirky art, you'll find many displays ranging from lovely to silly. The bed is very comfortable, and the room is large enough, as is the bathroom. I had a good time."
140331,336136,2011-06-26,591586,Claire,"Wonderful experience! The room and private bath were super comfy and perfectly equipped. I had everything I needed for a week's stay. The house and property are amazing...art everywhere, great books, sweet dogs, secluded spot in the middle of the city. Jana is the ultimate host and made me feel completely at home. Thank you so much! Hope to visit again soon."
140331,354765,2011-07-05,180428,Julian,"My partner and I had a wonderful time staying at the MetroBilly Retreat. Our experience was probably heightened by the fact that it didn't rain once during the time we were in Seattle. But a big part of the charm was definitely because of the metrobilly experience. The room is super comfortable, full of interesting art and books, and our hosts were full of great advice, conversation, and patience. The house is also in a nice area, minutes away from the bus stop on Madison Ave that will take you downtown. There are excellent restaurants close by, and you can easily walk to the beach."
140331,374147,2011-07-15,684791,Jeanne,"My stay at the ""Metrobilly Retreat"" was a fun, funky and fabulous!
Jana and Hahn were quite nice, the dogs were awesome, and I felt quite at home without any of the weirdness I feared there would be staying in someone's home - very casual and comfortable. 
Thanks for a great experience!"
140331,377344,2011-07-16,816810,Scott,"Really great first stay with airbnb! Didn't know what to do after getting off of the plane into Seattle and Jana was the perfect host! Helped me get to the house as well as plan the rest of my trip! Incredibly hospitable, wonderful little private space!"
140331,383463,2011-07-19,758224,Tim,"Although we never met Jana, she left us all the info we needed to have a nice stay. The room with attached bath was spacious and clean. The private entrance and access to laundry facilities were nice features. The location was several blocks to the bus and the neighborhood retail district and not as convenient as other places that we have stayed, but the neighborhood was safe and convenient to the downtown, Lake Washington and the Arboretum."
140331,398271,2011-07-26,264433,Kate,"My husband and I really enjoyed our seven night stay at the ""Metrobilly Retreat"". Jana was a wonderful host, allowing privacy but being there if we had any questions about Seattle.
The location was perfect for us, near our son who lives in the Capitol Hill area.
We particularly liked having our own entrance and the bed was very comfortable.  The room with all its artwork and books made it feel like home.
Ed and Kate"
140331,403627,2011-07-28,868558,Rahul,Jana was kind enough to allow a very late check in due to flight delays. Very recommended. 
140331,407168,2011-07-30,827016,Tamara,I never had the opportunity to meet Jana.  Seattle was a quick stop on my way to Canada but we did connect via email and phone.  The room was great and it was a great place to stop and rest.  Very easy access to downtown for sightseeing.   Would recommend to anyone staying in the Seattle area.  
140331,415116,2011-08-02,785981,Meaghan,"WOW. Our stay at the Metrobilly Retreat was perfect. We loved everything about the room, the neighborhood, Jana, the dogs and the instant community of artists and like mined individuals that we met. THE place to stay if you want to be instantly immersed in the Seattle community. The house is within walking and running and/or biking distance to cafes, the arboretum, Washington Lake and public transit lines."
140331,425794,2011-08-07,694254,Cindy,"Great location, great room!"
140331,473881,2011-08-25,741118,Lana,"Nice house and nice host, they even helped me by arranging to have some groceries in the fridge upon arrival. I wish the host were home during our stay, though, as it was not that much fun with the dog sitter.  The room is very cosy with great books and a fun bathroom. I also liked having our own entrance through the mud room. The house is in a quiet and beautiful residential area. Getting to Downtown or Seattle Center by bus requires a 10-15 min walk to the bus stop and then a wait for the bus, as the buses are not very frequent.  The reward for walking all this way is seeing the gorgeous houses and gardens and feasting on delicious blackberries, which grow like weeds in Seattle."
140331,485674,2011-08-29,276584,Ashok,"Our first time using airbnb, and thankfully Jana's place was as advertised.  We both enjoyed our stay there and the room was comfortable, though we did not linger after waking.

We did not get to meet the hosts (and dogs) because they were away.

"
140331,500575,2011-09-04,610427,Samina,"We had a lovely time at the Metrobilly Retreat -- the location was great, accommodations charmingly quirky, and really cozy.  It was a change for us big city folk, and the experience encouraged us to slow down, read some the fascinating books (from their broad collection of what must be over a thousand) and connect with nature.

If you're seeking an authentic 'Portlandia' immersion, this is it!  Hopefully the next time we head back thataway, Jena and Hubby will be around."
140331,563427,2011-09-24,440960,Prescott,"The place felt like home from the start. With a private entrance and en suite bathroom, it was truly luxurious and convenient. Great space with plenty of room, a comfortable bed, and gorgeous leafy suburban setting.

Jana was a great host, very communicative and welcoming. She even gave me a ride downtown one morning! The dogs are super friendly and she'll provide everything you need around the house.

All in all, it's a great spot to relax and catch up on some sleeping and reading. I only with it was a wee bit closer to downtown —  it's a long walk home if you miss the bus."
140331,592265,2011-10-03,989097,Frank,"What an awesome, cozy place.  The bed was very comfortable and we slept very well.  The location was excellent as well. Great places to eat within walking distance and the neighborhood was beautiful.  Definitely will stay here again in the future when we visit Seattle."
140331,738777,2011-11-22,1410282,Susan,This was a perfect spot for someone like me who just needed a private bedroom to sleep in. I brought y hotspot and was set for tea at night and coffee in the morning.  Don't worry if you forgot something to read-- you are in a great library!
140331,766608,2011-12-05,894166,Sophie,"MetroBilly Retreat was a fun place to stay. It was spacious enough for us to not feel too cramped. Bathroom was a good size as well. Was a very good value to the cost. It would be best for early risers as we could hear dog running around and folks walking from house above (studio is a basement apartment) at 7AM.  We only stayed one night so it could've been just that morning...

Jana and husband were good hosts and very accommodating. Locations is really beautiful too. Overall, they have created a really cool sustainable/urban space that is super affordable and enjoyable to experience.

Thanks, Jana!
"
140331,831563,2012-01-03,539954,Lynette,"I was so comfortable and cozy at the Metrobilly Retreat! I never wanted to leave the comfy bed or stop reading from the great selection of books they have available in the room. Jana is super friendly and helpful and Helmut and Cosmo are so adorable!! Their home is beautiful, interesting, full of life and set in a friendly and quiet neighborhood. The walk from the house to the bus stop (or back home) was always a pleasant experience, especially when the sky was clear and the stars were shining. I had a wonderful experience thanks to these amazing hosts!!"
140331,885107,2012-01-27,979233,Celine,"I drove into Seattle, sleepy and loaded with luggage. Jana met me at the door and showed me around and let me get settled in right away! She also made sure to warm up the room before I got there. The room is very comfortable. It was a warm and inviting place to come home to after a long day exploring Seattle in the winter rain. The water pressure in the bathroom is strong and I never rad out of hot water. The dogs are sweet as can be too. Added bonus! There are loads of books and magazines to read. The neighborhood is very safe and picturesque. Cafe Flora, Mountain Flow Yoga and Hi Spot were my favorite local spots. And there are multiple bus stops located near the house. Enjoy!"
140331,894804,2012-01-31,1515251,Colleen,"This place was perfect for my needs -- very comfortable, private entry, and great bathtub!  Jana made it very easy to move in and everything was provided for.  It's very convenient to the Capital Hill neighborhood which was important for me as I was visiting family in that area.  I plan to stay there again on my next visit to Seattle. Loved the artwork too!"
140331,983485,2012-03-09,1160814,Aimee,"We had such a lovely time at Jana's Metrobilly home! Her home is beautiful; full of character, artwork, books, and warm energy. She was so helpful and accommodating with the booking and even offered to mail me some school work that I left behind. I wish we had gotten to stay more than one night. Thank you Jana for the great stay! "
140331,1023042,2012-03-20,1671292,Ben,"It was great to stay at Jana's and Hahn's Metrobilly Retreat. ""Retreat"" is really the right word to describe this metropolitan hideout. Located in a dead end street of a very nice neighborhood I enjoyed a calm and restful stay of 6 nights. The basement room with separate entrance and bathroom is just perfect. Wifi works great, could use it to skype back home to Germany - only videostreaming with YouTube would get stuck sometimes. The bed was very comfortable and there was a small desk to do paperwork. Just what I needed. Always found a parking spot for my huge rental SUV, never took me more than 15 minutes to get anywhere downtown in Seattle (by car). Wish I would have had more time to go running through the neighbouring arboretum. Jana was a really nice host and it was great meeting her. I enjoyed the complementary blackberry tea. Ideal for 1-2!"
140331,1038496,2012-03-24,1387352,Andy,"Jana was great and very accommodating! We loved the room and the location is very hard to beat! Very close to downtown and Capitol Hill, very close to University of Washington. We had a great time! Thank you Jana!"
140331,1044720,2012-03-26,1829301,Melissa,"This was my first time booking with airbnb and I didn't know what to expect. Thankfully, Jana made the process as seamless as possible. So, I decided to book reservations for two nights while I toured Seattle. 

Jana was actually out of town the weekend I stayed, but her husband, Hahn, was there to welcome me. He even grabbed some of my bags and brought them to the room when I arrived. I got in about 9:30 p.m. and was starving. Her husband recommended a nearby Japanese restaurant and then called them to tell them I was quickly heading over. Within 20 minutes, I was at Maneki (Japanese) in the International District for some good grub and VIP treatment.

The bed was comfy, the location was excellent (to Pike Place, the Space Needle) and the room is as advertised in the photos (there is a desk at the foot of the bed now). Also, they left copies of a couple Seattle weeklies to check out event listings. For taller guests, you may want to consider the elevated tub/shower. I'm not even 5'6"" but brushed my hand against the ceiling while in the shower. I'd say there was at least another foot between my head and the ceiling, but it's just something to consider.

A big thank you to Jana and Hahn for making my stay cozy!

140331,1087814,2012-04-05,1720144,Douglas,A very enjoyable stay.  Loved the room!  Thank you Jana...
140331,1120533,2012-04-12,1600735,Christopher,"Jana and Hahn were both very pleasant, and super helpful. The home is very nice and their dogs are adorable. We stayed for a full week and really liked the location. Bikable to all downtown locations (watch out for some scary hills though). We would definitely stay there again."
140331,1185484,2012-04-26,2093994,Elise & Sarah,"We had a lovely trip to Seattle which was made very comfortable by Jana and Hahn. 

The room was very clean and quite, plus you get a huge bath all to yourself which we took advantage of for sure. A short walk to buses and local shops surrounded by lovely tulips and leafy streets made us feel relaxed each day we went out.

Couldn't have asked for a better first stay for Airbnb will definitely use it again and would highly recommend a stay at the Metrobilly Retreat.

They also have two lovely dogs that are very well trained."
140331,1221829,2012-05-03,2014019,Robin,"We stayed with Jana for our five day house search in Seattle and it was a wonderful experience. Every other time we've been in Seattle, we paid for hotel rooms and this was much more comfortable. It was very reasonably priced, the room and bathroom were very clean, and we had all the amenities we would have received at a hotel anyway (coffee pot, tea, lil snacks, clean towels, and toiletries) but with our own private entrance. It was even very conveniently located to the bus line, the arboretum (great for running/biking) and several cute cafes and restaurants, so we were able to walk to breakfast and lunch. "
140331,1253932,2012-05-09,2139779,Ruth,"Best introduction to Seattle we ever could've hoped for - Jana is a warm and engaging person who welcomed us into her home and couldn't have been a better host. She made sure we had everything we needed, drove us into town if she was going, and gave us tips on where to eat and areas to check out which all turned out to be fantastic. We came in spring while the front garden was in full bloom, met her two excitable but very friendly dogs, and stayed in the room pictured which was also an awesomely stocked mini-library of sorts! (The room and the whole house is beautifully decorated, btw). En suite separate bathroom with hot water every morning and toiletries and a hair dryer were provided, along with extra blankets should we need them. I only met Jana's husband on the last morning but he seemed very friendly and nice too. This is an excellent place to stay. Thank you Jana and Hahn!"
140331,1267141,2012-05-12,1617597,Natalie,Great place and great hosts....the bathtub alone is worth the price!
140331,1287480,2012-05-15,2091023,Laura,"The room was very comfortable and cozy. It was clean, the room was large, and we had our own bathroom and private entrance. Jana was very nice and helpful, and quick to respond to our messages. The only thing was that the bus stop is uphill several blocks away, so I recommend having a car."
140331,1899181,2012-08-06,2442639,Max,We loved it at Janas and Hahns place. The house is very centrally located and surrounded by trees. The two of theme are very friendly and helpful hosts! Seattle is a great place to visit and we would definitely stay with Jana and Hahn again.
140331,1979238,2012-08-14,1453736,Jean,We were greeted very well. We particularly appreciated the availability of bicycles.
140331,2018797,2012-08-18,2665656,Julia,"Staying at the Metrobilly Retreat was lovely!

We arrived in the evening and Jana was just finishing up the room with clean sheets. We were excited to meet the dogs right off the bat and chat a bit with Jana. From there, our schedule got a little crazy! We saw Jana again a few days later while leaving for Olympic National Park at 5am. 

The location was perfect; we found that their lovely home was pretty centrally located to all the places we needed to be that week! With a separate entrance through the bike room, we were able to enter/exit whenever we needed. There was always a spot to park our tiny little rental car on the street leading up to their place too!

The room itself was also lovely; comfy bed and a tea kettle in the bathroom! The shower can be a little short for anyone over 5'5, but you can make it work! The walls are lined with fabulous book - seemingly every topic you could imagine!

Overall, we thought it was the best place to stay in Seattle! We'll be moving the the NW in a few years, and it was the perfect way to experience the city. We felt like we were coming ""home"" each night, which made our trip so lovely!"
140331,2077357,2012-08-23,3213347,Carol,"The location is great - close to the buses, the lake, and the restaurants and bakeries on Madison Street.  The neighborhood is very quiet and green, a little oasis in the bustle of Seattle.  The bed was extremely cozy; the only drawback for me was a musty smell in the bedroom probably from all the old books that line the walls."
140331,2097306,2012-08-26,2196583,Viktoria,"It was very great to stay at Jana house.
The room was very cozy and comfortable. The location is really great. Very green and quiet. There are a couple of restaurants and busstations close to the house.
Jana, her husband and the neighbour were so nice and helpful. They gave us informations what to see in Seattle. (The Watertower has a really nice view.) Jana offered us their bikes. The two dogs were very friendly and welcomed us, too.

We would like to stay here again!
Thank you Jana for the great time at your lovely place!"
140331,2247436,2012-09-10,2935222,Ally,"While we had less than 24 hours in Seattle, the metrobilly retreat was by far the best place to stay!  Jana and her husband weren't around when we checked in but she emailed us detailed directions and we felt very much at home in their basement apartment.  We couldn't believe how quite and peaceful the setting was considering how close to the city the house is.  Also- the location is fantastic, what a cool neighborhood and downtown was an easy short drive.  If we ever come back to Seattle we would love to stay at metrobilly again!"
140331,2272139,2012-09-12,3112290,Joanna,The reservation was canceled 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
140331,2280391,2012-09-14,176393,Paul,"We enjoyed our stay, a quiet basement room with private entrance, walked to the bus stop one afternoon, about 5-10 mins and the downtown bus (11)  took about 25mins at rush hour. Would definitely stay there again. As a cyclist I knew it was the place when we opened the basement door and saw about 8 bikes hanging up...."
140331,2305712,2012-09-17,1827721,Shari,This was a great funky little place. It was comfortable and clean and just what I needed.
140331,2382130,2012-09-23,278812,Ken,"We really enjoyed staying at Jana's house.  There was a bit of a flub when we first arrived, which was that Jana's cell phone had died and she was not home when we got there.  But her warm demeanor and many apologies when we did meet made us feel good about booking our stay there.  (We also were able to munch on some of her apples and a plumb from her trees while we waited, a fact that went a long way in dispelling our rumbling bellies.)  The space is interesting with artistic flares to appreciate and ponder, and has a vast amount of books to wade into.  We even, upon having an unexpected extra day back in Seattle, were able to book with Jana again without any problem.  We would definitely stay with them again!  "
140331,2748781,2012-10-29,617281,Megan,"I stayed for two weeks in the Metrobilly retreat. It was a great place for such a long stay. It feels like it's in the forest, far from civilization, yet just a few blocks away you can find French restaurants, wine bars, the best veggie restaurant, and public transportation. Jana and Hahn were very gracious and friendly. 

One recommendation would be to rent a car in the winter. I did so and it was worth it, since the place is up a little street that gets dark in the winter. Bikes would be awesome, too!"
140331,2863337,2012-11-12,3725606,Erin,"Fun, funky bedroom with a private entrance and a big, luxurious bathtub. Awesome library, and the Bed. Is. So. Cozy.  Ive already booked my next stay.
"
140331,2958421,2012-11-25,176393,Paul,"Our second stay at Metrobilly--love it there--great location, quiet, close to bus stops and an easy walk to my girlfriend's daughter's place. Five minutes or less to a bakery/coffee shop. Private entrance and private bath meant we come and go as we choose without bothering anyone"
140331,3267933,2013-01-04,4357424,Amanda,"Mertobilly for sure!! It's like a little bit of country dropped right in the middle of town, even down to the dirt road. I would love to see it in the summer when everything is in bloom as they have a large garden and lots of landscape with all kinds of different baubles and eye-candy. 

The room is the perfect size for 2 and there is a little desk at the end of the bed to set up laptop. There are all kinds of things to look at in the room as well, not just books. My brother had a blast checking out the stuff in the room. He found a Spirograph like the one we had when we were growing up in the 80's and there is an old miners hat sitting on the window ledge. If you like books, you will be impressed with the variety of books from all around the world. The bed is quite comfortable too. I usually have trouble sleeping in strange beds, but fell right asleep and slept well on this one.

The owner seem to be very ""green"" as in sustainability, recycling and up-cycling. The lighting in the bathroom consists of one ceiling light which makes it difficult to apply makeup as there is no vanity light. What I did was bring one of the lamps from the bedroom into the bathroom and set it up in the window ledge which helped a lot. If you are tall, like me, you may have trouble taking a shower as the tub is elevated which makes the shower head even lower on the wall. I ended up taking a shower on my knees most of the time so I could get my head under the water. It would be much easier for someone with short hair that could just face the shower head and bend forward into spray. 

They do have two dogs, that never come down into the basement, who you can hear running around upstairs and barking every once in a great while. I have dogs so it didn't bother me at all.They are very nice and well behaved. 

Other than the lighting and shower head thing (which wasn't that big of a deal), we had a WONDERFUL stay and our host, Jana, was AWESOME!! Thank you :)"
140331,3295032,2013-01-06,4550511,Alicia,"Metrobilly was the perfect place for my partner and me for two nights.  We booked on short notice but Jana responded quickly to our inquiry and was warm and welcoming throughout the stay.  Clean, tidy, private, and cozy, we really enjoyed the little hideaway in the lovely Madison neighborhood.  I would certainly recommend it to anyone else! "
140331,3602526,2013-02-22,1857087,Peter,"Jana and Hahn were a lot of fun.  Great conversation, eclectic knowledge and art and life, bicycles!!, positive, and the space is cozy and fun.  Easy access to the suite from a separate door made coming and going at all hours smooth and disturbance free.  I really enjoyed roaming the bookshelves.  I'll very certainly be back to see them again."
140331,4062897,2013-04-07,326056,Jacob,Awesome little place. Felt like home as soon as I walked in the door. Jana is a fantastic host and her house is equally amazing. 
140331,4174557,2013-04-15,1152366,Fanny,"We had a great time at Metrobilly Retreat, definitely a unique atmosphere, a nice hood and the best sleep ever :-)
Fanny & Rob"
140331,4260831,2013-04-22,5680285,Kathrin,"i had a very nice stay in the metrobilly retreat - even though i never met Jana as she was travelling as well that weekend. 
room is very cozy and exactly like on the pics - i felt at home immediately. the bus connection to downtown is good as well, just walk a few minutes to the madison street and you can catch the bus to downtown.
if i ever go back to seattle i will definetely stay there again!
"
140331,4535692,2013-05-11,6004102,Kimberly,"Metrobilly Retreat is amazing! My husband and I had a great stay. It's super private with its own private entrance. Jana provided us with a keypad entry which made it even easier. We felt like we had our own little apartment! Parking was easy and very close to ALL of Seattle but still on a quiet street. The property is absolutely beautiful - such lovely flowers. We spent the whole time looking for an apartment of our own, which can be very stressful. The ease of staying here made us feel much more relaxed. THANK YOU JANA! Hopefully we'll meet you next time we visit :)"
140331,4889768,2013-05-31,1819314,Jody,"Jana's Metrobilly Retreat is a quiet, clean, private spot in a convenient location. The bedroom and bathroom are spacious. The setting is charming with gardens galore. We loved staying there and hope to return soon. Thanks!"
140331,5072020,2013-06-10,6717045,Cassi,"Jana and her place was great.  She accepted our last minute request to stay and was so nice about making sure we'd be comfy.  We met her adorable pups who gave us a nice welcome. :)  We got to meet her as we dropped off our luggage before we were out and about exploring the city!  It's in an awesome location and parking was no problem (I love not paying the 30-40 parking fees that we would at the hotels).  Totally felt like we were staying at a relative's house.  The bed was comfy, warm and fit both my fiance and I.  I loved the side entrance so it felt like we weren't bothering anyone when we came in late at night.  We'll definitely stay again next time we are in town.  Thank you for making our first AirBnB experience a great one!"
140331,5133435,2013-06-14,6549265,Amy,"I came to Seattle from Oklahoma to look for an for an apartment for my my husband and I- which was incredibly stressful to say the least. Jana's Metrobilly Retreat was the perfect peaceful and cozy home base to regain our wits after being out all day looking at apartments. We never had a problem with parking or getting into the place and we felt very secure tucked away in the neighborhood. I am go glad we chose to stay here- Metrobilly Retreat is the best. 
Thanks Again Jana!!"
140331,5172791,2013-06-16,1865787,James,"Jana was an absolute delight of a host! Very very accommodating last minute and even ensured we had a extra air mattress for my gf's mom who accompanied us last minute.  

Excellent communication, very responsive - we were very happy to connect with Jana. 

The only downside is that the room was a bit pricey for the accommodation - smelled a bit like mold or dust , perhaps all the old books in the room are giving it a nice musty smell. We just had to crack the windows and all was good. 

Overall though quite happy."
140331,5208812,2013-06-18,6036160,Xavier,"An amazing place. Great books and plants. You can be have privacy if you want, if not jana is very friendly and accommodating. I will go back next time I'm in Seattle - definitely. "
140331,5314523,2013-06-24,2128842,Colleen,"The Metrobilly is an ideal, laid-back spot for resting your head in Seattle! Jana and Hahn are great hosts--very knowledgeable about the area (and beyond) and communicative--and the room itself is clean, cozy, inimitably decorated, and fabulously lined with books of all persuasions! Highlights: the large bathtub and availability of bikes with which to explore Capitol Hill."
140331,5508050,2013-07-03,3212200,Jane,"We stayed at Jana's for four days, and it was great! She was a lovely host, and the room was exactly as described. We had a lot of privacy and were free to come and go without worrying about disturbing anyone, which was what we wanted. It was close to town, close to a good bus route, but also set back in a very quiet neighbourhood with lots of trees. I would recommend it to anyone, and I'd stay there again!"
140331,6109653,2013-07-30,6827604,Rebecca,"Jana and Hahn provided such a lovely getaway, tucked back but not too far. They were easy to get in touch with when you needed them, but the basement location provided optimal privacy.

Superb decor... like a cabinet of curiosities! These people have a sense of humor and killer style. My partner and I really appreciated the library after a couple full days of walking. I made it through ""Like a velvet glove cast in iron"" and he started browsing a Droog design book only to buy his own the next week. There's something for everyone in that collection. Thanks for sharing Jana and Hahn!

Bus navigation was super easy. As you might expect Sundays are a slow day for the buses. The walk to the stop was in a safe-feeling, good-vibing neighborhood. We did have a little trouble finding food on a budget within a mile radius but everything we did find was quite tasty.

Overall, awesome! One question still lingers... what is the space-age aluminum ""case"" next to the bed?"
140331,6137229,2013-07-31,5146614,Kasia,A lovely hidden location in Seattle just a short distance from Madison lake. The decor was quirky and fun and we had everythig we needed. Would definitely stay again in future.
140331,6276180,2013-08-06,1917271,Julia,"We had a lovely stay at the Metrobilly retreat. The area we stayed in was pretty self-contained with en suite and separate entrance so it felt very independent. Although we only crossed paths twice, Jana was charming and happy for us to breakfast in her kitchen. Not a super-central location but there are some nice cafes in walking distance (up a hill or two) and the beautiful Arboretum close by which was a lovely green escape ."
140331,6561444,2013-08-17,7364459,Herb,"Jana and Hahn were very good hosts.  The space was as advertised and very private.  We loved the available washer and dryer ... It came in handy after we were over a week into our trip.  Downside?  Well, it was kinda hard to find the place and it could be a little better lit at night to make the pathway to the private entrance easier to manage.  Overall, a wonderful and stimulating place to stay!  E"
140331,6694058,2013-08-21,6076936,Xia,"People told me that it's hard to walk around Seattle, you need a car. I disagree with it. The bus can take you to most of the tour places! The place I lived is about 15mins waking to the bus station. 45mins walking to downtown (I like hiking :P) lovely dogs! Nice people! Antique stuff~ And so considerate! The first place got a kettle that I can boil water~private bathroom!  There is couple nice restaurants around as well!"
140331,7840686,2013-10-05,8179042,Elizabeth,"Jana and Han were incredible hosts, their creative and inviting energy could be felt the second you step foot on their property. 

The room was cozy and set up with everything I needed and more! I took a full 30 minutes admiring the books and the art when I arrived.

Jana was super responsive to any questions I had and even tipped me off on fun art events happening around town. I emailed Jana to see if she had a spare hair dryer I could borrow and the next thing I know, there is a hair dryer at my door! 

I was lucky enough to meet Jana and Han my first night in town. I wish our schedules had crossed more after that! I am remiss I didn't get to give a proper good bye before I left. 

Capitol Hill, downtown, and the airport were all very easily accessible by public transportation. The short walk to and from the bus was a nice way to start and end my day. And the local neighborhood was great too. 

Thank you Jana and Han for making my trip so lovely and easy!! "
140331,8469690,2013-11-01,7976268,Zachary,"Lovely place, is as advertised.  Host, Jana, is very kind & helpful.  Would certainly stay here again."
140331,9266246,2013-12-17,8374626,Zach,"Jana and Hahn were ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!  Both of them are wonderfully nice people and I couldn't have asked for better hosts.  A bit about my trip: I was in Seattle for 6 weeks without any real family or contacts, which you can imagine might be a bit daunting.. however, Jana and Hahn quickly made me feel at home and helped to make my experience an amazing one.  While they were extremely respectful of my privacy, I never felt as if I couldn't get a hold of Jana if I needed to.  The house is in a great location in the Madison Valley area, near the centrally located Capital Hill; I was able to easily navigate the area and get where I needed to go in no time at all.  Both Jana and Hahn were great sources of information on things to do and see and helped to provide a great insight on the city itself; if bike riding is your thing, be sure to talk to Hahn.. he is quite a wealth of knowledge when it comes to the routes around the area (and pretty much everything else, as well).  The room/bathroom was nice and clean when I arrived with a wealth of things to read and plenty of space.  In addition to the washer/dryer that I used frequently, Jana made it clear that I was free to use the fridge and upstairs utilities whenever need be.  Also, Cosmo and Helmut (their pups) were awesome housemates as well.. be sure to ask to take them for a walk! That is an experience in itself!  

I would HIGHLY recommend staying at the Metrobilly Retreat if you are looking for a place to stay for a Seattle trip... you won't be disappointed!  As I mentioned before, Jana and Hahn were the perfect hosts and I would gladly stay with them again in the future.  If you have any specific questions about my stay, please feel free to contact- I'd be happy to answer!  "
140331,9956364,2014-01-21,10701066,Benjamin,"As the many reviews attest, the Metrobilly retreat provides solace in the heart of major metropolis. I had an automobile so transportation wasn't an issue. It's less than 10 minutes by car to the Capital Hill neighborhood, which is where my obligations took me. 

The room itself is cozy, clean and spacious with all the amenities of home. It's in a basement, but I didn't experience any of the mustiness that some of the other reviewers mentioned. Everything is dry, ventilated, and clean. There is even a full-sized bathtub. The only consideration might be the low ceilings, which I had no problem with. 

My schedule was extremely busy when I visited, so I scarcely interacted with the hosts, but they were very welcoming and provided excellent communication throughout my stay. 

Not much else can be said except that the Metrobilly Retreat is a 5 star experience! "
140331,10700167,2014-03-03,3054047,Arianne,"Jana's is exactly as advertised! My husband, baby and I had a lovely few nights, and I took the bus in and out of downtown for a conference. Given the price, it's a great deal--the only hitch is that the is too low-ceilinged for a six footer, though I would still stay there again anyway. Jana and her husband are lovely. The neighborhood is full of interesting houses and hills. 

"
140331,11128782,2014-03-22,4005460,Niklas,"I very much enjoyed staying at the metrobilly retreat. The house is located in a very nice and calm neighborhood. There are a couple of nice restaurants and cafes nearby. The next bus stop is a five minute walk away. 

The room is nicely decorated with lots of interesting and cool details. The bed is super comfy. 

I'd definetly stay here again. "
140331,11798606,2014-04-15,12271153,Aimee,"Jana's place was great! I stayed for 3 weeks while working in town and it was a home away from home. She thought of every detail; from fresh flowers in the room on arrival, to a little tea corner with an electric kettle. She was an absolutely delightful host, always available with helpful info and places to check out. Really enjoyed getting to know her and my time there. Highly recommend!!"
140331,17831962,2014-08-18,15279715,Katie,"I was looking for a cost effective and comfortable alternative to a hotel, that provided me with some local knowledge but still afforded me privacy and space. Jana's place was perfect, she was contactable when I needed her but when I didn't I had my privacy. On the run up to my stay Jana was really helpful in providing me with all the information I needed. I really enjoyed my stay here, the room was comfortable and is exactly as the photo suggests.  The neighbourhood is safe, quiet and residential. The house is a short walk (~10 min) to a good selection of restaurants and bus stops that serve downtown, Seattle centre and the U district regularly until late. There's also a convenience store here and a supermarket within 20 min walk/short bus trip. All in all, a great stay!"
140331,18030258,2014-08-20,709056,Brad,"Jana's home is gorgeous, peaceful, restful and wonderfully enchanting. It sits in a mini-urban forest of sorts, with so much festive plants and trees. The room itself is filled with a fascinating library--science and philosophy enthusiasts will rejoice in it, and the decor is truly one-of-a-kind. I slept deeply and generally felt rejuvenated each morning. Loved it!"
140331,18182956,2014-08-23,18099804,Lauren,"My boyfriend and I had a brief but excellent stay at Jana's place in Seattle. Jana made us feel at home immediately, although we were out and about so much we didn't really cross paths too often! The room is very comfortable, quiet and private. We loved the quirky decorations and had everything we needed.
The house is in a quiet area of town near Lake Washington. Although we didn't have a car, there is a bus stop nearby that takes you downtown or to Capitol Hill (which is also walking distance) so we just allowed 30mins to get into town and once we were out we planned to stay out!!
The only slight setback was that we found the bed so comfy that we struggled to get out of it in the mornings!"
140331,18589485,2014-08-28,20261740,Zongjin,"Jana's house is great!! Very beautiful designed! Jana provides us everything we need. Very convenient. And the location is very convenient. It is both ok to take a taxi or a bus. At the first day, Jana also drives us to downtown. She is really a nice person! She introduces us lots of attractions and tells us how to get there. Really enjoy a happy time. I will choose here if I come to Seattle again!"
140331,18986880,2014-09-04,13759323,Nathaniel,"My girlfriend and I rented with Jana for a whole week while we enjoyed a vacation in Seattle. The room was great. Very private, with a private entrance and private bathroom. Jana was very welcoming and accommodating. She let us bring our luggage by early so we didn't have to lug it around town. The room and bathroom were very clean and had a unique rustic 70s charm, with lots of books to browse while unwinding in the evening. Jana was a great resource for helping us get around town and letting us know all the good events going on. She also had updated maps and bus routes, along with tourist attraction info available in the room. 

The neighborhood is a nice, quiet residential neighborhood. Jana's lot has great gardening and trees that make her house feel like it is in the middle of the woods. Even though she is in a quiet neighborhood, you are only one bus stop away from downtown. Definitely grab a coffee from the Essential Bakery before you head down there. "
140331,19198948,2014-09-08,5782550,Cheryl,"We were in Seattle for a wedding -so we were in and out constantly. The room had very easy access, was quiet, and perfect for us. We even met the dogs with our big dog and tails were wagging!
I loved the glasswork that was around the room and property and such a wonderful random assortment of books within the room.
Only saw our hosts once (we were coming and going constantly) but had a delightful conversation - they are a great couple."
140331,19362282,2014-09-11,1702349,Annie,I had a fantastic time at Jana's Metrobilly Retreat. The room is beautiful and comfortable and there are so many things to look at and admire just there. I spent most of my time in Seattle exploring the local art scene and Jana gave me some lovely tips and advice what to see. The neighbourhood is great. There are some delicious restaurants and cafes within walking distance. All in all it was just perfect.
140331,19555155,2014-09-14,1234683,Fatos,"The place was very comfortable and clean! Its almost like a private apartment, with it’s own private entrance. Jana was very helpful in making sure we had everything we needed. I would definitely stay here again.

140331,20036284,2014-09-22,134603,Simon,"Jana and Hahn were great hosts and I loved the room. It gives you a feeling of your own space with your own attached bathroom and private entrance. The room was also decorated awesomely.. everyday I would notice something new. There was also a lot of interesting books to read. This had turned into a list of things I like.. and here are a few more.. nice warm showers, fast Wi-Fi, unique yard layout, nice kitchen! Only downside I found was the location wasn't as walk friendly (it was super safe and pleasant but in terms of walking to a grocery store or more than a few restaurants) as some places in Seattle, but Araya's nearby has some real good spicy vegan Thai food!"
140331,20591947,2014-10-01,1312047,Tim,"Jana was great. I was headed out of a town and got a last-minute request to continue some work for a few more days. I emailed Jana, and she was incredibly helpful with my and her schedules. She got the room ready as soon as she could and was great about keeping me posted. When I arrived, I got right in easily. After a few minutes, Jana came down to greet me and give me the lay of the land.

To enter, you come in through the outside door and walk a few feet in to the basement, where to door to the room is. So your door isn't directly to the outside, making it a little more insulated. I liked that. The room is an eclectic room in the basement lined with bookshelves full of interesting titles surrounding a very comfortable bed. The eclectic artistic touches pop up  in the room and the attached bathroom. I thought it was great and would absolutely stay again.

The house is near the Bush School, and it's easy access to shops and close to the lake. I walked up to a nearby park and gardens, and the Madison park beach and shops are a short drive bike ride. So it's a good base for visiting. Since it is a basement apartment, you have normal basement apartment things: the ceiling is slightly lower, the windows let in less light much of the day, and you'll hear foot and paw steps up above from the pups. Usually in shorter intervals, and it didn't bother me, but worth noting if you want absolute silence. 

Jana was responsive and friendly. I met some of her friends who had stopped by when I arrived, and it's just a great group of people. I was there for only about 2 1/2 days and working much of the day, but I enjoyed my stay and am glad I got a chance to explore that part of Seattle a bit."
140331,20678660,2014-10-03,21929342,Akhil,"Jana is awesome! Super nice, clean, private and unique! She had an art show and had really cool work. She was so kind an i think were going to stay here again soon! 6/5 stars!!!"
140331,20801043,2014-10-05,21986787,Sandra,"I had a great time. Jana was very sweet. The room was very tranquil and quiet. Loved the Cosmos theme in the bathroom. The only downside was that I could not get a signal on my phone. I have TMobile. But that's not her fault, just an observation for others. I will be back when I have more time to explore all of the books. "
140331,22112225,2014-10-30,2093586,Angel,"The location and room and Jana are all fabulous! The house is tucked away at the end of a quiet little street in the middle of a very nice area of the city. Capitol Hill and Downtown are both very accessible from the bus routes near the house. There are three stops (that I used) within about a half mile from the house, and they're all a pretty easy walk. The buses usually run every 15 minutes until it gets late - then they switch to every 30 minutes. You can walk to Capitol Hill as well, but the walk there is up a pretty steep long hill. 

Check out the Central Co-op (about a mile and a quarter away - bus or walk) for healthy food and local produce. Just around the corner from the co-op is Seattle Yoga Arts, which offers a new student 3 classes for $30 special - pretty good if you're in town only a short time.

The room itself is very comfortable. The space heaters keep the place as toasty as you want it and the bed is super cozy. And the book selection is ridiculous! From obscure music to Eastern philosophy, yoga, math (and being a mathematician), classic novels and how-to manuals - they've got so interesting many books! And the decor is equally as interesting - lots of really cool and quirky art. 

I couldn't tell from the pictures, but the bathroom is attached - so it's all yours and you don't have to leave the room to get to it. That goes a long way in making it feel like you've got your own space. 

But if you have the chance to get to know the hosts and their sweet pups, you totally should! Hahn was out of town when I was there, so I didn't get a chance to meet him, but Jana is a super cool lady and a very kind soul. I'm really glad to have met her and I'm so happy I stayed here!"
140331,22607786,2014-11-10,22825035,Ariana,"Jana and Hanh were incredible hosts. Even before reserving their listing, Jana maintained constant contact with me about costs, location and other meticulous questions I had. The private room was cozy and welcoming. It wasn't far from downtown at all and very easy to travel to the districts from where we were. During the mornings we explored the surrounding area, it was perfect to explore with a cup of coffee from the local cafés only a few minutes from their place. although we didn't talk for long, the several minutes we caught them packing for a cycling marathon the night before they were really fun to talk to (and their dogs were so friendly!). Would definitely recommend to people who want a relaxed spot to go back to after adventuring around the city."
140331,23001573,2014-11-19,23542822,Bryan,"Had a great experience, super friendly and even got a ride on the way to the store. Lots of cool books in the room. Great spot, plan on returning."
140331,23207858,2014-11-25,22085067,Joaliné,"The room was really comfortable, it is a cozy space, the bed amazing, the bathroom really spacious and all decorated very nicely. It was kept warm when the temperature outside was cold, so we knew that when arriving we would feel at home, with everything they promise in the description of the retreat. Jana was really kind and helpful with directions, and with getting a cab to get to the airport early in the morning.  Dogs are really lovely, super educated as well. The location is good, with a maximum of two buses you can get to most areas of Seattle, and Jana provides with maps and information so that you don't get lost, which can happen if it is your first time in Seattle. Would definitely come back to Metrobilly retreat if in Seattle."
140331,24233583,2014-12-23,23542822,Bryan,"My second stay at the Metrobilly lodge & resort was great. Very warm room, very nice people, no complaints whatsoever. The primary color scheme going on in the bathroom is great and you'll learn a lot of science facts looking at the shower curtain."
140331,24716472,2015-01-02,9723805,Bracy,I very much enjoyed Jana's retreat.  The place was very cozy and clean.  The bed was comfortable.  Jana was very respectful of our privacy which was much appreciated.  I will definitely stay here again when visiting Seattle.
140331,33287273,2015-05-26,23892345,Marcel,Great place to hide out in the city.
140331,33543926,2015-05-29,4534285,Shinnosuke,Jana is such a great host. She is very friendly and easygoing. Her house was clean and interesting. I loved the bathroom! It's so huge! It's located in convenient place and nice neighborhood so you can enjoy walking too. Our experience in her house was wonderful!
140331,33602048,2015-05-30,4952267,Donald,"Metrobilly (perfect description) Retreat was even better than our expectations. The funky, wooded, secluded setting in the middle of Seattle's urban commotion is a spacetime warp. The house is buffered against the city by its gardens, lush undergrowth and various ""green"" projects, including an impressive collection of fine bicycles in different stages of production and repair, plus our host's artwork. Our cozy room (with its own library!) was private and comfortable (great bed) and the attached large bathroom and separate entrance made coming and going easy. Despite the apparent isolation, East Madison St. with its many cafes and restaurants is a only short walk away. Our hosts Jana and Hann were attentive to getting us settled in while in the midst of their own very busy lives. We will definitely want to stay again on our next visit to Seattle."
140331,34014032,2015-06-03,4896601,Tobias,"Jana's has been a perfect base to explore Seattle. The place is spacious, super cozy and great to get some rest from the more hectic life downtown. Both Lake Washington and the city center are within walking distance - if you don't like walking: the bus just takes a few minutes. Jana was very welcoming and helpful and gave us a lot of information on the area and helped us planning our travels in Washington state. We'd definitely recommend staying at Jana's!"
6837751,35618790,2015-06-20,12682803,Lisa,My hosts were very gracious and the location is perfect. I would stay again in a hearbeat.
6837751,35883476,2015-06-22,27228400,Cheng,Very nice experience living with Cody and his Mom. The house is pretty nice! Strongly recommend!
6837751,36329244,2015-06-27,35928395,Fang,"Cody and R are the best host I can ask for. They tried their best to make me feel at home, and I did feel really glad to meet such nice people like them. The description of the home is accurate. The house is great and well-decorated. Everything you need for living will be provided. They even got up early and baked delicious breakfast for me. The location is good, walking distance to University of Washington. And it only costs $8 if you Uber to downtown. Cody is super considerate and responsive. He told me everything I need to know before I arrived and replied really quick(like always in 5 minutes) on Airbnb message. Besides, the neighborhood is very safe and convenient. There are lots of yummy restaurants locate in the area. In all, I highly recommend everyone to try this excellent place in Seattle!"
6837751,36618839,2015-06-29,36442994,Nic,"Cody, was an amazing host for my first AirBNB experience.  Along with fresh flowers and a cookie in my room, they even made me breakfast.  He far exceeded my expectations.  The house was great and in a good location, close to downtown in a beautiful neighborhood.  I would go again anytime.  "
6837751,37399983,2015-07-06,34018937,Suvir,"Living with Cody and his family was a great experience. I stayed with them for a few days as I was moving to Seattle from elsewhere. I enjoyed a wonderful breakfast every morning and a very well stocked refrigerator at all times of the day. I felt very welcome and ""at home"" throughout my stay. They are very thoughtful, polite and helpful. "
6837751,38560475,2015-07-16,35741464,Andrew,"Excellent location and comfortable accommodations! Kristin was sick during her stay there, but the hosts were so generous and took great care of her! "
6837751,38656891,2015-07-17,31396006,Laurel,"This was an excellent experience from the moment I reserved the room. Cody was very responsive and helpful with directions and accommodations. When I arrived, his mother greeted me in this beautiful home! She was very helpful with recommendations for things to do and also made a delicious breakfast the next morning. Overall, my stay was a wonderful time. Thank you for such hospitality Cody and family!"
6837751,39058084,2015-07-20,6723225,Raf,Thanks a bunch Cody! 
6837751,39455816,2015-07-23,37792993,Charles,"What an outstanding experience!  Not only were the accommodations perfectly adequate, the host(s) were warm and welcoming.  This was my first experience with Airbnb and Cody and Rosie helped make it a great one.  Looking forward to future visits!"

They were very welcoming me and made my memory so special and breakfast that Rosie made for the guest was amazing.
The house is very clean and beautiful.
I just want to say thanks for giving me unforgettable memories in seattle!
I wish I could see Rosie and Cody again :)"
6837751,42725331,2015-08-15,7116977,Mark,"This was overall a very positive experience. Cody and his mother were both very lovely and sociable, were welcoming from the very beginning. My interactions with them were wonderful. The breakfasts were nice, and they were very accommodating to my early morning starts.

The location is very close to UW, and a short bus ride away from downtown. Transportation to and from their home was very easy. The room was comfortable, and the home was lovely.

Highly recommended."
6837751,43284173,2015-08-18,4746579,Brenda,"Cody and his mother were absolutely fantastic in all ways - everything from pre-arrival communication to a warm welcome to pleasant conversation. Their cozy home is a perfect, relaxing base for Seattle exploration. I highly recommend!! "
6837751,43709363,2015-08-21,37792993,Charles,"Once again, I had a fantastic experience here and plan on booking again on my next visit.  The hosts are gracious and accommodating.  The room is comfortable and the location is outstanding!  "
6837751,44074689,2015-08-23,12639838,Beat,"I had a wonderful stay with Cody and his mother. Unfortunately I stayed just two nights and I wasn""t often at home. Was warmly welcomed and had some good chats, everything was like in a hotel (shampoo ready, water bottles, free coffee etc etc!) and the breakfast was nice too! The house & the room was very clean!

10Min by bus to the broadway of capitol hill, 30-40min walk. Excellent location if you wanna enjoy capitol hill.

Would recommend to everyone to stay with them!"
6837751,44356879,2015-08-25,41100382,Jay,"I had a wonderful experience with staying with Cody and his mother at their beautiful home. They were both very courteous, and made my first airbnb experience quite memorable! I would definitely stay with them and again and would recommend them to others looking for a comfortable stay in a historic home just minutes from downtown Seattle!"
6837751,44712677,2015-08-28,41299906,Andres,"This was my first stay in an Airbnb.  Talk about setting the bar high.  The house was simply beautiful, pristine and impeccably well maintained.  Cody and his lovely mother were the most accommodating, welcoming and gracious hosts one could ask for.  The neighborhood was filled with beautiful homes and plenty of stores, restaurants and shops.  The house was located across from the I-5 which made it extremely convenient for me to get anywhere in my rental car and for the record, I didn't hear or notice any noise coming from it.  Even without the numerous lovely and thoughtful fine touches(fresh baked cookies and a mint in the bedroom, fresh fruit and croissants accompanied by fresh juices in the breakfast sun room) I couldn't recommend this home enough.  Thank you both again for such a memorable visit."
6837751,45595969,2015-09-04,576014,Nathan,Terrific overall experience & location.
6837751,46356432,2015-09-09,43537630,Chris,Cody and his mother were nothing but wonderful! I enjoyed chatting with both of them Chiaki and her sister from Japan. I will always cherish the opportunity to meet these awesome folks.
6837751,47121503,2015-09-15,43817570,Carl,"Best value in Seattle.  Spent a wonderful weekend staying with Cody and his Mom. 
 Perfect location just minutes from two busy bus routes.  The 49 bus takes you to downtown via Broadway in 10 min.  The 76 will get you to the Space needle in the same time.  Both buses run at night and over weekends.  Very easy to get to all the sights and back.
The house is beautiful in an older stately neighborhood. 
Stayed in the single room which was perfect for my needs.  Comfortable bed, television and night light.
Shared bathroom lovely.
Also included is a delicious  full continental breakfast served on the enclosed back patio.  A very elegant and relaxed way to start the day.
Wonderful hosts.  They lead busy lives so you'll hardly see each other.  Warm and interesting company for delightful conversations.  Both go out of their way to make your stay pleasant.  Cody organized an Uber ride and made sure I got up at 3:00 am to catch my flight.  Will definitely return with my whole family partly just to visit them again.  Cant thank them enough for the superb Seattle welcome and stay. "
6837751,47846873,2015-09-21,43885599,Ali Sinan,"This was my first Airbnb experience, and it was fantastic! Cody and her mom are amazing hosts, and I had a very good time staying with them for 4 nights. The house is located very conveniently 1 block away from a bus that runs through UW and Capitol Hill. In addition, it is very easy and pleasant to walk to the campus area. I would definitely recommend staying at this place."
6837751,48107272,2015-09-23,42089512,Michael,"This place is a treat.   I came in tired and dirty after backpacking for a week, and a warm welcome from RosaLee and a hot shower eased me back into civilization.  The room is small but sufficient. The bathroom terrific.  A special treat is the sunny (yeah, even in Seattle) nook/porch set aside for coffee and a juice in the morning.  Cody was very responsive and cordial. Great touches abound, including chocolates, cookies, a robe.  The area is upscale residential, very near I-5, tho the sound of traffic was not a problem.  Its proximity to Lake Union and the Burke-Gilman trail, and the University of Washington made it an excellent base for bicyclists. I’ll be back.
"
6837751,48813645,2015-09-28,12115074,Kameron,"Cody was a graceful and generous host during my weekend in Seattle. Located in Portage Bay, his family home is quaint and homey. I truly felt like a Seattle resident staying in their home, which made my stay even more fruitful. I highly recommend booking a room here! "
6837751,49567321,2015-10-04,43879318,Michael,I truly enjoyed my stay with Cody and Rosalynn. Their home is exquisite and I appreciated the details like chocolate next to my bed and freshly baked muffins and a stocked mini fridge in their breakfast room. I would highly recommend their place.
6837751,51512326,2015-10-20,3817547,Russell,"Absolutely amazing hosts!

Cody and his mother are truly great airbnb hosts. The room and the sun room are both perfect.  Not to mention the little treats.

Location wise there is plenty within walking distance and only a short drive/bus to main attractions.  Completely safe area with plenty of parking and very easily accessible.

I would definitely stay here again"
4653552,25549486,2015-01-19,2113481,Lyndee,"Lela's space was just what my family needed.  We live in Seattle and are doing some work on our house.  We needed a place for a couple of weeks, and Lela's duplex was so much better than a hotel room.  

We have three kids and a dog and didn't feel crowded. We did bring in an air mattress so our 8 and 10 year old boys didn't have to share the bottom double bunk, but it would work for two smaller kids. The kitchen was great, the essentials were provided.  The beds and furniture were all very comfortable.  

Being so close to Green Lake and Tangletown was awesome.  It was fun to walk our dog and explore the neighborhood.  It would be even better in the summer!  

Lela was friendly and kind and checked in to make sure everything was OK.  


"
4653552,27601258,2015-03-08,27904624,Sue,Wonderful Greenlake location and easy parking was a relief for weary travelers with kids in tow.  It was a great space with a modern kitchen and two nice sized bedrooms.  We didn't know we would be treated to supplied to make a nice breakfast!  We will certainly be back.
4653552,27782406,2015-03-11,26383615,Peg,"The apartment met our needs perfectly.  It was very clean.  There was plenty of on-street parking.  The host was gracious, friendly and accommodating.  The amenities were exactly as described.  We were within walking distance of Green Lake and the walking trail.  There was easy access to the I 5 which was important to us because we had to drive to a downtown hospital daily (to visit our daughter and new grandchild).  Grocery stores were close so we could prepare meals onsite.  We would definitely stay here again when visiting family."
4653552,28660608,2015-03-28,27800744,Margaret,"Lela, who actually goes by Kathy, was a fabulous host. The space is nice and comfortable (great bed) and worked great for me, my husband, and our three kids. The Green Lake neighborhood is beautiful. One really nice touch is that Kathy left us bagels, cream cheese, butter, pancake mix, maple syrup and coffee for our first breakfast.  This saved us from having to search out a grocery store that first night. I really appreciated that!  I would definitely stay here again."
4653552,29097910,2015-04-04,15544209,Paul,"We stayed at Kathy's place for 7 nights with our three young children. The apartment was very kid-friendly. Location was perfect with Green Lake one block away and our new favorite donut place, Mighty O, a few blocks away. Kathy was a great host."
4653552,30237366,2015-04-19,27481405,Chris,"Great, cozy, clean and comfortable. Amazing location by the lake. Even had breakfast waiting for us in the fridge. Highly recommend ! "
4653552,31713163,2015-05-09,30193954,Kim,"Lela (Kathy) did a wonderful job making us feel very welcome.  Fruit, juice, coffee, and breakfast items were waiting.  The apartment was spotless and very very comfortable.  Kitchen...STUNNING.  The neighborhood was great.  Very walkable.  Nice little market, bar/restaurants, coffee shop and Mighty-O Donuts. (Just go get the donuts, seriously).  Parking, which can be an issue in Seattle, was always available.  I would definitely recommend for a family of 4."
4653552,33357191,2015-05-27,27358005,Patricia,We traveled from Southern OR coast to celebrate our grandson's 4th Birthday. The home was cozy and clean. Kathy (Lela) was very accessible and pleasant. We were greeted with a wonderful breakfast basket with local products and that was just a nice touch. Location! Location! Location! Greenlake literally within footsteps and all it has to offer both little and bigger kids alike. We enjoyed our stay completely.
4653552,34555262,2015-06-09,33067289,William,"very accommodating host, clean apartment, and great location right on green lake."
4653552,35336505,2015-06-17,29831937,Valerie,"Lela's home was very clean with a lot of open space. The location is great—very close to the water and the neighborhood is quiet. It's also only about a 15 minute drive to downtown (when there's no traffic). Although she wasn't there this time to greet us personally, she was very responsive any time I had a question. She left us a great assortment of breakfast food, including local coffee, bagels, fruit, and orange juice. She also provides towels and toiletries. If you're settling in for a quiet night, her TV has tons of channels. Overall, the 5 of us had a nice stay there. "
4653552,35638174,2015-06-21,389293,Andy,"Lela's place is in a great neighborhood.   Super close to Green Lake which is a great spot for a relaxing walk or to sit on the grass.  The place is cozy with a nice kitchen, and her package of breakfast items makes things easier for sure.   The washer dryer was handy as well.    Shopping is relatively close (you need a car though) and there were a few restaurants within walking distance that were fun.    Drawbacks ?  The disposal in the kitchen didn't work while we were there, which was icky.   The trash can is a bit small and with 4 of us it overflowed and the bag didn't stay in it really well so it was hard to take out.  Little things, really.  Overall it is a great place, people are nice, and the location is fantastic.  Bus if you want into the city is nearby, and that was handy as well.  "
4653552,35776303,2015-06-22,29345163,Kimberly,Apartment was lovely and comfortable - great Green Lake location.
4653552,36364575,2015-06-28,14857216,Katie,"Location, location, location! This apartment is right in the heart of Tangletown and a block up from Greenlake which was perfect for our family who has two young kids. We walked down to the lake everyday and could also walk to coffee, dinner, parks, etc. 

Lela goes by ""Kathy"" and was super friendly and welcoming. Her top apartment was comfortably furnished, had a gorgeous huge kitchen and was nice and bright. Almost too bright - with that Seattle sun coming in through the bedroom windows from 5 am - 10:30 pm. That took a little getting used to for my kids. I appreciated how stocked the home was with the little things, laundry detergent, shampoo, soap, cleaner, all the kitchen utensils one might need to stay a week. Kathy supplied fresh coffee, orange juice, fruit and bagels as well. Very sweet. 

We would definitely recommend staying here and would love to come back ourselves. Thanks Kathy!"
4653552,37155462,2015-07-05,4452397,Viral,"Overall the experience was great. The place is nice with a couple of minor quirks (see details below), Lela was a great host, and the location is fantastic.

Lela's description of the place was accurate, including the fact there is no A/C. I'm thinking that in most cases an A/C is not required in Seattle, but we just happened to be in Seattle during the worst heat wave in history. If you are someone that can't handle the heat and are coming in the summer, please keep in mind. One minor issue we had was that the bunk bed in the second room creaked quite a bit, even with minor of movements; if you're a light sleeper like myself, this could be very annoying.

Lela was a great host. As mentioned above, we were in Seattle during a heat wave and Lela was very understanding and helped us get a couple of fans for the place, which I'm sure she'll make available to others in the future. Beyond the, place was neat, instructions were clear and communication was great.

Finally, in regard to the neighborhood, the place is a block away from Green Lake, which is a great spot for water activities, walks along the water or just hanging out in the sun. The neighborhood has a couple of nearby spots for coffee, lunch, dinner, etc, but nothing too exciting (though the nearby Donut shop was amazing). The neighborhood is not central to a lot of areas in Seattle, but if you plan on driving the whole time, its not a bad drive to get around town."
4653552,38380387,2015-07-15,31469946,John,"Lela was on vacation while we were there but she left bagels, cream cheese and jelly along with mixes for scones.  We enjoyed our breakfasts made from these things.  The neighborhood was quiet and nice.  Walking distance to the lake.  Very nice and roomy.  Everything was great. She had purchased a very nice blow up mattress since we weren't sure how the sleeping arrangements would be.  It was probably nicer than some people's beds."
4653552,38704605,2015-07-18,31422276,Stephen,"We have a great time at Lela's Apartment. The apartment was clean and breakfast was provided in the refrigerator (bagels, cream cheese and orange juice). The rooms and the bathroom are great with enough bed sheets and towels. The neighborhood is nice and quiet. "
4653552,38850153,2015-07-19,24601049,Selina,"Lela's house is great! She has such a chef kitchen and everything you could think of. July Seattle was super hot,but there was no ac. Overall was great! Thank you Lela "
4653552,39620151,2015-07-25,33583767,Nicole,The host was very accomodating and the location is premium. Very nice furnishings and we couldn't be happier. 
4653552,40560087,2015-08-01,28523646,Carol,"The listing was as described and we were very happy with our stay.  We found the accommodations to be clean and very comfortable and we loved the neighborhood.  It was quiet and a short walk to Greenlake, Park.  Also within walking distance there are restaurants and a few shops.  Lela left a welcome basket with a scone mix, jam,  coffee and juice which we really appreciated.   We would definitely stay here again. "
4653552,42513128,2015-08-14,24987123,Matthew,"Perfect stay, location couldn't have been better.  Walking distance to the lake, grocery, and mighty-o donuts.  We stayed four nights and didn't even need a car.  Everything's right there, and the 16 bus to the Space Needle stops a block away.  Perfect."
4653552,43228937,2015-08-18,33970179,怡貞,"Great house,great owner-Lela.We had a great vacation at Lela's house."
4653552,44279059,2015-08-25,29801910,Susan,"Lela is a gracious and welcoming host; the  apartment is exactly as described and shown in photos. The apartment is spacious and was comfortable for the four adults in our group; we prepared some meals in the gourmet kitchen and everything we needed for cooking was available. We were able to do laundry and iron as needed.  The location is one block from Green Lake and we walked around the lake every morning. The cafes and shops at Green Lake are abut a ten minute walk.  We will be returning to Seattle a lot in the future and if Lela's apartment is available, we hope to use it again. This was a lovely home away from home and I highly recommend it.     "
4653552,44654766,2015-08-28,28997522,Tammy,Lela was a great and made us feel very welcome and at home. The addition of yummy breakfast foods and juice was a very nice touch. The space was very comfortable and just as described.
4653552,44884275,2015-08-30,28997522,Tammy,"Lela greeted me upon arrival and made me feel right at home. She showed me around the space and told me to ask if I needed anything at all. The space was very comfortable and as described. She left bagels, juice and more for us to have in the morning without having to worry about running to a market which was such a nice touch. Plenty of towels, comfy beds and plenty of room to relax in the living area. If ever in the area again I would definitely try to stay here. Take the time to walk up the hill to Mighty Os for some spectacular donuts, a coffee at Fix and try the market for a selection of local beers and wine."
4653552,47143233,2015-09-16,29260946,Roland,"We had just a gread time . We felt us at home there.
Everything there was so nice and beautyfull. And it was so quiet.
So how i said, we had a gread time in Seattle and in the Apartment from Lela. 
Hope one time we can come back on this very nice place Greenlake to the aparment from Lela Thomson."
4653552,47693170,2015-09-21,15153880,Marsha,"Lela did a great job in making us feel welcome by providing a few of the needed items for breakfast (i.e., bagels, cream cheese, apples, etc.)  The place was very clean and prepared for our arrival.  There was a lovely kitchen - our visit was so short - we didn't have a chance to really use it but lovely.  Overall - the place was GREAT for our needs.  So close to the lake for a morning walk and close to Tangletown for dinner and breakfast.  Love the area!!!"
4653552,49978223,2015-10-08,25407066,Tania,"The place was excellent. I stayed there with my spouse, my brother and my mother during a family vacation and it was plenty of space for the four of us. 

The location, right by green lake, was great. A lot of walking around the lake! There is a bus stop close by that took us directly downtown which was really convenient.

"
4653552,50362453,2015-10-11,32989025,Adam,"What a great experience! In addition to being clean, comfortable, and in a great neighborhood, Lela was a very inviting host. The kitchen is outstanding and we greatly appreciated the coffee and bagels in the morning. We mostly ate out while exploring Seattle but next time we're up there I plan to utilize the AMAZING kitchen space. I heartily encourage anyone needing a place to stay in Seattle that they consider Lela's lovely home."
4653552,51169576,2015-10-18,995189,Nick,"Great second floor apartment in a very quiet section of Green Lake.  We were in Seattle visiting family for a long weekend and there was plenty of room for the whole family to gather around the table and in the kitchen.  Location was great for getting downtown to see the sights - easy access to both I-55 and 99.  Easy on street parking, lots of natural light (every room had windows on two sides, and its up high on a corner lot so very open).  All-in-all a very nice place to stay!"
4653552,52034063,2015-10-25,22615584,Deborah,The apartment looked just like the pictures.  It is a very nice place and we had a wonderful time staying there!  Location is great.  I would love to come back the next time we are in Seattle!
4653552,55211393,2015-11-29,45945925,Nancy,"Lela was warm, welcoming and helpful.  We rented the apartment so that we could enjoy a Thanksgiving dinner reunion family and friends.  The apartment was comfortable and the kitchen spacious and easy to cook a large Thanksgiving meal.  The refrigerator was also spacious.  The location is beautiful.  We will definitely return to this Greenlake Apartment and will recommend it as well!
"
4653552,57148978,2015-12-22,12931011,Brittany,"This is a great place, highly recommended!  Can't beat the location, the proximity to Greenlake is amazing!"
6958603,37807634,2015-07-10,36854716,Zachariah,Everything was awesome! Deck was even cooler than it looks in the pictures. Room was very clean and shared bath room was not an issue at all. We loved the rabbits and chicken.  And it's walking distance to whole foods for a fun dinner to take back to the deck! Would definitely look to stay here again on a future trip to Seattle. 
6958603,38027505,2015-07-12,36038897,Megan,"We absolutely loved this space! The grounds surrounding it are very nice, with friendly bunnies that love to be pet and happy, well cared for chickens and their charming coops. The room and private deck were very clean, well decorated and comfortable. The hosts were friendly and welcoming and obviously care very much for their little sanctuary in the city. I would definitely stay here again :)"
6958603,38315989,2015-07-14,23574301,Neil,"Jean-Marc's apartment was cozy, clean and beautiful! The patio was also amazing. We enjoyed the area of Queen Anne very much and found it very accessible to the rest of the city - we love to walk, and it was under an hour to downtown (with some stops along the way). Would definitely recommend!"
6958603,38538728,2015-07-16,37268219,David,The rooftop was just what I needed for my brief stay in Seattle. I like long walks so for me it was close enough to walk to the city center/ space needle area. The bed was comfortable. The host was friendly when we briefly met and gave us our privacy for the rest of the stay. The room and bathroom were clean. The patio was lovely at night.
6958603,38763906,2015-07-18,4707637,Andreas,Staying on the rooftop was great. The room is cozy and it is nice to enjoy the evening on the balcony. Jean Marc is a great host and communication was easy. We will stay at his place again in a few days and are looking forward to it.
6958603,39309554,2015-07-22,21053665,Treva,Excellent Stay! Loved the domestic wildlife and the bed was superb. Deck overlooking the neighborhood with mini lights was a delight! Many little touches to make one feel welcome!
6958603,39969595,2015-07-27,6990239,Margaret,"This is a nice space in a good location. The room is comfortable and clean, and was equipped with a very nice air conditioning unit. Fast Internet too! I especially appreciated the easy check-in and check-out. Thank you! "
6958603,40247683,2015-07-29,23047406,Ashkan,Jean-Marc was awesome! I got the pleasure of meeting him on my way out and he was pretty cool! I love the location of this home and everything it has to offer including the bunnies! I hope everyone goes and stays at this property! It is truly awesome! Veryyyyyy comfortable bed! Thank you so much for sharing your place with me!
6958603,40940359,2015-08-03,20695957,Stephanie,"I absolutely loved the rooftop room! I was so sad to leave. It's such a cute, cozy room and I loved the patio and the view. This home is in a great location with easy access, just minutes from the places we wanted to go. This space was clean, quiet, and welcoming. I would certainly recommend the rooftop room!"
6958603,41969465,2015-08-10,35481674,Ivan Ho,"Room was as described, no problems encountered. There is a bus stop only 3 minutes walk away where you can take a bus to downtown in 15 minutes."
6958603,43084469,2015-08-17,38162148,Quinn,Great experience. Room was as described and clean. 
6958603,43409758,2015-08-19,1190318,Meredith,"We had a wonderful stay at the rooftop room! As the pictures show, the property was so unique-a little urban homestead right near Kerry Park (which has a wonderful view of the city and Rainier) and also not far from Ballard (which boasts great restaurants and breweries!). The bus stop was right across the street which helped to avoid parking in the city. There was no trouble in using the shared bathroom, we only saw one person staying in the wagon once. All and all a great stay!"
6958603,43669726,2015-08-21,39903522,Becca,"This is an adorable rooftop bedroom. We loved returning to the little oasis at night and find the patio lights lit. It's all very charming! 

The location was great as well- and bonus, we had no problem finding parking! 
"
6958603,44314339,2015-08-25,36889229,Nellie,"We didn't see much of our host, but we didn't need to. Everything was in wonderful condition, ready to use, and clear. The room was SO cute and comfortable. Parking might be hard at times, but we always found a spot within a few blocks. Neighborhood felt very safe, too."
6958603,44662001,2015-08-28,9566776,Laura,"Jean-Marc's place was great! What a cool little spot. Jean-Marc was friendly and helped us with parking when we arrived and we bumped into each other a couple of times through our stay. He was keen to make sure we were enjoying our stay and check if we needed anything or had feedback. The room itself was as described, clean and the bed was comfortable. The shared bathroom was no problem. We enjoyed our exclusive use of the deck - a great spot to sit and read or do some yoga. Public transport close by.  We definitely recommend this spot for anyone wanting to see Seattle. Oh and the bunnies were the cutest!! "
6958603,44929736,2015-08-30,32575264,Marleen,Very nice place and rooftop! Would certainly recommend this place.
6958603,45396986,2015-09-02,3463232,Robert,Jean-Marc responded quickly to all communication. The room was clean and comfortable and in a good location. The house was charming and I'd love to return.
6958603,48126631,2015-09-23,16430300,Ann-Katrin,"Had a wonderful stay at the rooftop room! Enjoyed the huge terrace especially:-) Everything was very clean, room and shared bathroom! Check in was very easy and Jean-Marc was a really nice and friendly host. Just got to talk to him once but enjoyed the chat in the front yard. Getting to downtown Seattle is also extremely easy by bus or if you're willing to walk a bit you can also make it through the northwestern neighborhoods in direction Seattle Center in about 30-40 minutes (a bit hilly though, but nice walk!!) The gypsy wagons in the yard look amazing too. Guess you can't do anything wrong here;-)!! "
6958603,48439908,2015-09-26,14790387,Alessandro,Really nice place to stay! comfortable and clean.
6958603,48886557,2015-09-29,30860321,Mickey,"The hosts were very friendly and accomodating. The room was very nice and clean, the bathroom was also very clean and had body wash and shampoo but mind you it is a shared bathroom with the other guests of the other rooms there. The rooftop had a very nice view and the overall place had a cute theme. They had rabbits and chickens in the backyard but weren't disturbing or in the way. They have good wifi and everything is simple, a place just to have a good night's rest. "
6958603,49611587,2015-10-05,34290162,Tom,Everything was exactly as advertised and the location was perfect.  Was able to walk most anywhere in Seattle from there.  Spectacularly clean and comfortable and my own private deck. 
6958603,51618548,2015-10-22,42951879,Lauren,"I had a wonderful time here. I was greeted by the host and his family - his daughter was sweet enough to offer me a beautiful flower picked right out of their garden! The room was clean and had everything I needed, I spent most of my time there on the wonderful deck, which has a fantastic view of the sunset. It was quiet, private, and easy to get to from many areas in the city. "
6958603,52281884,2015-10-27,22454134,Danny,"Loved it. Room was small, but comfy and clean. There was street parking, just ask him where you can and can't park. 

Jean-Marc's place is great and I would definitely stay here again. The only hard choice would be whether to stay in the rooftop room again or try out the wagons.

"
6958603,55114804,2015-11-28,16059491,Muhi,"Jean Marc was nice and the room was perfect. Knowing the property shared the bathroom was my only worry but it turned out it is accessible and the property was conveniently located. The place was clean when we arrived and is really unique with the bunnies, dog, chickens, swing and amazing view. I highly recommend you staying here if you are looking for a unique and alternative experience. "
6958603,57723372,2015-12-28,484587,Yuebo,It's a really lovely stay during Christmas. Smooth self check-in. There are even cute rabbits and chickens.
6958603,58378794,2016-01-02,50616204,Zoey,We loved how cozy and unique the place was. The room was very clean. The bed was super comfortable. We felt at home! Never any noise problem. The view was wonderful. We felt so welcomed and even were permitted to pet the bunnies. Had a great experience and would definitely come back if we ever got the chance.
2804399,13119322,2014-05-19,133117,Jacob & Kori,My stay was short and sweet in Seattle with this welcoming family. The accommodations were great with a private bedroom and full bathroom on the 2nd floor. The house is walking distance from a few food options and a quick drive to the heart of the university district. I would definitely recommend staying here!  
2804399,13771301,2014-06-03,16050573,Anna,"Rooms are spacious, light, private and very clean. Delightful neighborhood with lots of interesting yards. Great for walking. I very much enjoyed my 4 nights and will stay with Meg again when I am in Seattle."
2804399,14002905,2014-06-09,16403426,Jason,Host's were great.  Very clean and quiet.  Nice neighborhood as well
2804399,15596484,2014-07-12,17317748,Rashmi,Meg and Gary were very kind and generous. It was a pleasure to stay with them. 
2804399,16303819,2014-07-25,16832885,Alan,Our host was outstanding. The guest bedroom was very clean with plenty of  space.  It was exactly as advertised. The neighborhood was pleasant with a nice park nearby. It was easy access to the rest of Seattle.  If available I will stay here again when in Seattle.
2804399,16430887,2014-07-27,18112400,Eva,"Very hospitable - friendly. Suite was large, airy and clean although the floor was a bit cold (could use some area rugs). Espresso in the am was 5 stars."
2804399,16626646,2014-07-30,17795311,Warren,Meg was a perfect host for us.   The room and bath were beyond our expectations.   Everything was spotlessly clean and we had full privacy.  I know that we will be returning to Seattle and Meg will be a the top of the list for us.   5 stars all the way!!
2804399,17230896,2014-08-09,7114571,Danny,"This place is nice.  The location is fine, close to U-district and conveniently located along the 72 / 73 bus lines.  Being tall, I felt somewhat cramped in parts of the area because it's basically an attic with lower areas where the roof slopes down, but overall everything was okay.

Also, Meg let me check in early which was awesome because lugging around a suitcase on vacation really sucks.  Day-saving."
2804399,17663829,2014-08-15,7835081,Hilary,Meg made me feel very at home! The room was spotless and exactly as described. Meg went above and beyond by offering me a list of sights to see while visiting Seattle as well as making sure that I knew how to use the pubic transport. I would definitely stay here again when in Seattle! 
2804399,17898083,2014-08-18,15104333,Dale,"Wonderful neighborhood. This was just what we needed. Quiet area, clean towels, friendly hosts.  cheers."
2804399,18099711,2014-08-21,20182186,David,"This is a very nice space in a quiet, family neighborhood close to downtown Seattle with easy street parking available right in front of the home.

Meg is very experienced with hosting and made our first experience with AirBNB a positive one, taking time to educate us on the AirBNB process.

Breakfast is self-serve with basic options.

I would recommend this location as a great place to stay in Seattle for a good night's rest in a quite, family community with nice accommodations."
2804399,18358313,2014-08-25,12216664,Jean-François,"Meg et Gary sont très aimables, ils ont accepté de nous recevoir moyennant paiement Air B &B, dans leur maison familiale, de nous loger dans la chambre spacieuse de leur fille absente, parmi ses affaires.
Bien accueilis par Meg à notre arrivée, nous n'avons pas eu d'échange au cours de notre séjour.
Il est facile d'aller à Seattle par le bus, c'est une ville agréable avec de fabuleux musées."
2804399,18821380,2014-09-01,18425826,Bill,"Very nice stay with plenty of space and comfort.  Quiet neighborhood. Meg was extremely helpful in providing information regarding Seattle and all there is to see and do around town.  Was directed to the best breakfast places, bike shops, places to see; which when having a brief stay in a city was incredibly helpful in maximizing my time spent in the city.  STRONGLY recommend!"
2804399,25569264,2015-01-19,25803493,Abby,"Meg, thanks for letting me stay on such short notice. It was perfect for me. The accommodations were just as described and cozy. I will definitely come back!"
2804399,34991527,2015-06-14,4938692,Martin,"This is a very comfortable lodging in a charming neighborhood. The upstairs flat has a sitting room welcoming you as you reach the second floor landing. It has a table and chairs that look out the window. A spacious bedroom with a very comfortable bed is through the doorway. The bedroom has a chest of drawers and a large closet, along with two chairs and a small table, and still lots of space to move around. There is a refrigerator in the adjacent room with a sink, hot pot to heat water and a usable counter. Meg stocked us with coffee, fruit, cereal, yogurt and packages of nuts. The separate toilet and shower is practical for couples.
The wi-fi worked well, and the area had lots of sights, restaurants and other shops within comfortable walking. Access to public transit buses was a plus.
Meg has put together a wonderful flat, and we look forward to another visit to Seattle, and our newest favorite Airbnb."
2804399,35433196,2015-06-18,25749987,Sarah,"Nice accommodations, quiet neighborhood.  My in laws enjoyed their stay a great deal.  Thank you Meg!"
2804399,36625288,2015-06-29,36366614,Vince,"Meg made me feel very welcome and the accommodations were great. I had the entire upstairs including shower and bathroom in the bedroom. I had privacy coming and going but Meg was available to give advice on directions and free parking locations downtown. Starbucks via coffee, milk, yogurt, granola, and fruit were available in my room as well. It's a great neighborhood in North Seattle just a few minutes from University Village. I would definitely stay here again."
2804399,38921115,2015-07-19,2363111,David,"I had a wonderful time staying on the top level of Meg's beautiful home. The location was perfect for my needs. The room was large, comfortable and sunny. Having a sitting area and a breakfast nook was a great luxury - far more spacious than any hotel could be at this price. Thanks so much for everything!"
2804399,41751786,2015-08-09,33363957,Tsung-Chien (Jonathan),"This was our first experience with airbnb and we had a wonderful stay at Meg and Gary's lovely house. The room was clean and comfortable, and the neighbors are friendly. I will definitely stay with them next time if needed. Highly recommend!"
2804399,42190501,2015-08-11,13424438,Howard,"Meg is an excellent host with great attention to detail so that experience and amenities were excellent.  Check in was a breeze.  The neighborhood is beautiful, quiet, and well located in Seattle."
2804399,43267219,2015-08-18,38100297,Robert,"Pleasant stay in the north of Seattle. We came with 3 Persons from Europe and had enough space. This flat on the second floor was neat, hospitality and trust of Meg more than usual. We´d come back if we were in Seattle!"
2804399,44417190,2015-08-26,35098932,Lynn,"We chose this accommodation due to its close proximity to the residence of our son and family. We also liked the good reviews.

We  were very pleased with the demeanor of our host, Meg. She seemed genuinely interested in us and made our experience much better.

The space was quite adequate and the bed very good. Likewise, with the breakfast, although I would have liked to have had fresh fruit such as bananas provided.

The space was a mismatch for us due to the steps outside and the narrow, steep stairs to the room. Also, I am taller and I kept banging my head on the sloped ceilings. Due to these inconveniences, I would have to say we probably won't be back to an otherwise delightful lodging."
2804399,44776232,2015-08-29,36890358,Larry,"This was our first airbnb visit, and Meg was a wonderful hostess who patiently explained airbnb rules and the rules of her home.  She has a beautiful home in a quiet neighborhood, and the two-room suite plus bath is very peaceful and private.  The sitting room is perfect for reading or catching up on work through wi-fi.  The bedroom is roomy and has a small fridge.

We're going to check here first for a place to stay the next time we're in the area.
"
2804399,45109286,2015-08-31,38939432,Adrianus,"We had a lovely stay at Meg,s place. We had lots of privacy and the rooms were really good. Meg has been very helpfull explaining what sites to visit and how to get trough seattle by bus. In one word great!
The house was really nice and friendly, beds were good. There were a lot of brochures and tourist books available as well.  Thanks Meg,
Hope to be back one day, regards,
Adrie Bakker"
2804399,46203024,2015-09-08,41280485,Xinran,Meg's rental has everything you need. It's only ten minutes drive to downtown. The communication with Meg was nice. 
2804399,47073055,2015-09-15,41553990,Michele,"Meg greeted me upon arrival and explain the house rules, parking and offered tips for restaurants in the area.  This was my first stay with Airbnb, Meg was very welcoming and made me feel very comfortable right from the start.

The suite was spacious and very comfortable, it fit my needs perfectly.  I couldn't have ask for a better experience."

2804399,51555984,2015-10-21,45034414,Allen,"This was our first experience with Air B&B.  We will definitely be using it again, and will probably stay with Meg again when visiting our son.  Her home is in a lovely neighborhood with downtown bus service two blocks away.  We were very satisfied and comfortable with our stay.
Renting the entire upper floor gave us privacy and room to spread out.
Meg was very helpful in providing information about the Seattle area."
5229971,26339769,2015-02-09,20664910,Andrew,"Nice place. 
Definitely worth the price but just that. Host was great and very organized in the whole experience. Great location which made the house and the stay well worth it. Great place to stay if youre looking for a clean place on the beach but not necessarily a luxury spot."
5229971,26569717,2015-02-15,26821942,Tara,"Bow's place was amazing!   I couldn't have asked for more,  the instructions were very clear and easy to follow for ease of use with the apartment.  It was super clean,  clutter free,  open spaces with great style!  The location was great to wall to bars,  coffee,  dinner and the beach.  Fun people watching from the large open balcony.  I would def go back to Bow's.  Thank you so much!   -Tara and Kristin"
5229971,37125645,2015-07-04,1663263,Eric,"I picked this place because summers are incredible in Seattle, and Bow's place was right on the water. Communication from him was prompt and instructions for what to do were very clear, and I loved the views from the hammock (and the balcony outside is huge as well)! The place was clean and neat, and there's a lot of great dining options and fun things to do just outside the apartment. I'd definitely stay here again, and would recommend my friends and family to do the same. Thanks Bow! "
5229971,45996223,2015-09-07,37271611,Staci,"The apartment was spacious, clean and in a great location if you like an active neighborhood with restaurants and coffee shops just around the corner.  We went to Bumbershoot at Seattle Center and found the drive to and from was very easy.  Bow suggested a good and free parking lot about a mile away from Seattle Center, which was perfect for avoiding the traffic and paying through the nose to park.
We also had a really nice view of the beach from the balcony.  We really enjoyed our stay."
5229971,47772687,2015-09-21,14058795,Ted,Very good experience. Only my second time using AirBNB and it was wonderful again. Apartment was exactly as described and Seattle was wonderful. Instructions were clear and it all went very smoothly. Thank you!
5229971,48909439,2015-09-29,42426567,John,"We loved the location on Puget Sound, very close to restaurants and great for walking. The unit was clean and easily accessible although somewhat noisy from the street. The only drawbacks were lack of TV and there was a strong musty odor that necessitated the patio doors and windows being open constantly.

Other than that, the host was very accommodating and the availability of a parking space was a very much welcomed perk.

We would certainly consider staying there again."
6350606,35832551,2015-06-22,33785836,Glen,"Absolutely beautiful place in an incredible neighborhood.  Felt sincerely welcomed and then was left to my own devices, which was perfect.  A beach park just steps down the road, quiet neighborhood, all the space and amenities you'd need."
6350606,44331685,2015-08-25,9312983,John,"Holly had someone meet us at the house (on time!) and show us around.  The house is a cute, spacious one bedroom in a secluded, quiet residential area a block or two from Lake Washington and north of downtown Seattle, off Sandpoint Way.  Seattle's long hiking trail, the Burke-Gilman, is at the end of the block.   It is easily accessible to the University District (also Husky Stadium and Wallingford/Freemont Dist's) and to I5.   It has, beside a good grill in an inclosed back yard, a well supplied kitchen and is very close, w/o real traffic, to the Metropolitan market, Seattles best, not counting the Public Market.  It has all the usual electronics and serviceable laundry machines.

I left my cell phone behind and it was overnighted to me promptly.

Nothing but good words to say, and will want to rent it again next time in Seattle."
6350606,45507757,2015-09-03,41765662,Justin,"This home was absolutely wonderful, our host left us a nice instructional paper on how to use the features of her home, and made us feel very welcomed with a bottle of wine and access to her Netflix account. The description of the house is not misleading whatsoever, it was beautifully decorated and big and open and very clean. It had a lovely backyard that was well-maintained and the neighborhood was quiet and just a street away from a waterfront park. Our host left us her cell phone number and allowed us to contact her if we had any questions or concerns. All in all it was a great experience, and I would definitely recommend it to anybody looking to stay in the Seattle area. "
7858454,47540878,2015-09-20,43532066,Marissa,"I booked this place for my parents to enjoy a few days ahead of my wedding. The place was adorable, cozy, and Kelly did a great job of leaving helpful tips and instructions in the house, directing them to local resources. Nice touch. She was very responsive and did a great job setting up a very beautiful, easy, charming experience for my family (newbies to air bnb). Very happy customers. Highly recommend!"
7858454,49141274,2015-10-01,21805474,Piya,"Kelly was there to recurve us made us a cup of tea as well which was very welcoming , stocked some essentials which was very thoughtful . The house was clean warm cozy well kept and well stocked "
7858454,52269211,2015-10-27,36707682,Matt,"Great property and terrific host, Kelly went out of her way to make sure we knew and understood the property! The home is exactly as advertised. Metropolitan Market is a short walk and is like a 24-7 mini-Whole Foods. Can't wait to stay there again on our next visit! "
158953,403029,2011-07-28,803426,Dave,"We first reserved the guest bedroom, but then reserved the master too, so we could have the whole place to ourselves.  This place is great! Within about a mile, there is a golf course, beaches, tennis court, coffee, bars, bread makers, cupcakes, stores, gas stations... it's like staying in a small town, right over the W. Seattle Bridge, minutes to downtown! There's a great Irish pub, great sushi, great pizza... without the hassles of city parking. It's the perfect location, and Meg is great, too! We will definitely stay with Meg again on our next trip to Seattle!
"
158953,540744,2011-09-17,1012541,Carissa,We rented the main bedroom at Meg's house mid week and ended up with the whole cottage. It was just as wonderful as we expected. Such a cute place with lots of character. Large yard to enjoy coffee in the morning and close to everything. We loved it!
7204672,43530436,2015-08-20,17917551,Vickie,"We enjoyed staying at Deb's house! We were the 1st family to stay at their house and Deb did a great job! Nice, very quiet neighborhood! House was very clean, orderly and nicer than pictures on listing. Deb was very good about texting us to make sure everything was okay. We would definitely stay there again!"
7204672,43982689,2015-08-23,39155024,Lindsey,The host was very welcoming and kind. She contacted me promptly and was warm and professional.  The property itself does NOT disappoint!! Very spacious and lots of community space to reflect on a wonderful day spent exploring Seattle.  The house was very clean and comfortable.  The location in Magnolia is peaceful and in walking distance to several beautiful Seattle parks.  Nice to have a easy free parking spot too.  I also appreciated being in walking distance from a cute little coffee shop as well.  
3144597,13462765,2014-05-27,15782790,Stacey,Nash was the most gracious host.  She was very helpful and accommodating.  The room was great and bed very comfortable.  I had a wonderful stay.  
3144597,13723787,2014-06-02,2205509,Grace & Jared,"My boyfriend and I stayed with Nash as we were moving to the area and trying to find an apartment. She was wonderfully flexible and communicative as we has many schedule changes. She gave us a lot of very helpful info about the area and tips for our search. We ended up staying more nights because it was such a good set-up. The location is a block from a Safeway, and walking distance to coffee and food, and not far from
Capitol Hill and downtown. There was ample street parking. The space is small and simple but all that we needed and the air mattress is surprisingly comfy. We highly recommend staying with Nash if you need a base in the Seattle area!"
3144597,14141619,2014-06-12,16590900,Bill,"Comfy, clean room just as advertised.  Easy walk to Capitol Hill bars and restaurants."

3144597,14310040,2014-06-16,10779593,Zed,"Nash was accommodating towards our needs and provided good insights on what to do while in Seattle. Her dog is friendly and we never heard a sound the entire time!

The room is bright and clean, and airbed comfortable enough for two people. Overall, the house is spacious and a 5-10 minute walk to the bus stop, with a direct bus to the light rail. A note to drivers, do make sure to ask Nash if a specific spot is OK to park!"
3144597,15102794,2014-07-02,669633,Igor,"It was great staying with Nash - clean room and amenities, comfortable bed, close proximity to downtown.  All questions were resolved in a warm friendly manner.
 Cute white terrier was a great addition to hospitality.
Would recommend this place to friends for staying in Seattle.
"
3144597,15272744,2014-07-06,11660630,Steve,"We had a great stay here. Close to downtown, 1 quick bus ride a couple blocks away. Nash was polite and accommodating. "
3144597,15507924,2014-07-10,17262147,Tim,"Nash was great and very hospitable.  The air mattress was surprisingly comfortable and very easy to sleep on.  The location is ideal for getting to downtown quickly or to Madison Park to the East for good eating and lake views. 
I would stay here again, and recommend the Sweet room near Capital Hill to anyone. "
3144597,15582659,2014-07-12,15202227,Rick,Nash is a great host and her house was very clean and was as described. We had a very pleasant visit over 2 days and talked for hours. We will definately visit again when in the area.
3144597,16774251,2014-08-02,16245938,Kristy,"We had a great time on our short visit. Nash is a friendly host and her pup is very sweet! The location was perfect-just a short bus ride to the lake, great food, downtown, and parks."
3144597,18197622,2014-08-23,15155164,Margaret,"Nash was considerate and flexible-- my partner and I had a late arrival time and she was very understanding and willing to work with us. The space itself is lovely, and couldn't be more conveniently located! The bed may be an air mattress, but it was more comfortable than many regular full beds I've slept in. 

We found it very easy to explore Seattle without a car due to the proximity of the home to several major bus lines. We didn't spend very much time in the space because we had such full days planned, but we were made to feel very welcome and I'd strongly recommend Nash's place to friends in the future!

"
3144597,18420872,2014-08-26,18516871,Kat,"Nash was very welcoming! At first she was unable to be meet me since I had a later flight but she made sure to accommodate me regardless. She has a very friendly dog who was welcoming as well. Her home was nice, neat and cozy! The air bed was more comfortable than my own actual bed! Her home is in a great neighborhood walking distance from many shops and eateries but away from the street buzz. "
3144597,18790393,2014-09-01,16069384,Aleks,The room was great.  Neighborhood was quaint and close to downtown.  Nash is super friendly and accommodating.  Would definitely stay there again.

She was super nice and flexible so we got to see her although our flight was delayed and we got to Seattle way later than planned. Nash was really welcoming and her dog was super cute too. We felt really comfortable, also she's super close to downtown. Thank you Nash for a great stay :)"

Room and house are both nice, with an adorable friendly dog too! Location is decent, quiet leafy neighbourhood close to downtown, easy bus links and shops very close by. All in all a fantastic stay, thank you!"
3144597,21643647,2014-10-20,2138563,Amelia,"Nash was a delightful host - she accepted a last-minute request from us, as we had to travel to Seattle on short notice. Her home is centrally located and beautifully appointed, and Nash took time out to chat with us and even give us some recommendations about local restaurants to check out (and some less hilly options for my morning run!). "
3144597,22309345,2014-11-03,2967735,Valeriia,"Nash attentive and friendly host. her house is very cozy and bright, we had a wonderful time.

3144597,25363787,2015-01-13,25209271,Ulises,"Nash place was an excellent option to explore Seattle. She was very understandable and keep communicated with us to coordinate our arrival even when she was not at home at the time we arrive. The room is small but very cozy and comfortable and Nash makes everything to make you feel more than welcome. The house is located in a nice neighborhood with many restaurants and some bars within walking distances Downtown Seattle is easily accessed by bus, we even walk a couple of times down there. It is definitely a place to consider if you want to explore Seattle, we did not spend too much time in the house since we were out all day long but Nash keep contact with us with notes and recommendations for things and places to visit."
3144597,25635390,2015-01-21,8369586,Brandon,"Nash was an excellent host. She was very friendly, kind, accommodating, and helped with all questions I had as far as getting around the city, sites to see, great food. Her house is located right in the heart of Capitol Hill, so everything was very close and accessible. Also, there is plenty of street parking if you have a car. The room was a nice size and very clean with a great view. I had a very peaceful sleep. She has two an adorable dog who is very lovable. I would highly recommend Nash as a host for other travelers."

I felt comfortable in the space and even shared some great conversation. Would recommend!"
3144597,28481705,2015-03-24,9279156,Jennifer,Nash is a very welcoming uncomplicate host and she makes an early arriving on the day possible for me. She also has a very cute dog!
3144597,29596481,2015-04-10,8378035,Toni,"Staying at Nash's house was the perfect choice for Seattle. 

The room was very comfortable, the air mattress was as good as a real bad, (if not better) and the house is just lovely! 

The neighbourhood is very sweet with pretty views all around, and it's very close to all the restaurants on Pike (Or coffee options). As well as all tourist attractions you'd want to see. 

Nash is very friendly and easy to talk to, she and her son made being on my own feel less lonely. Rye, the dog was the sweetest little thing and enjoyed a pat- what a cutie! 

Looking forward to staying here again when I return to Seattle in the upcoming future :) 

Thanks for everything Nash! "
3144597,29992822,2015-04-15,7760640,Tyler,"Nash was extremely nice. We arrived late and she was very accommodating. We not stay long, only a few days and only used the room to sleep. It was clean, and very inviting. Great experience. Thanks Nash for letting us stay in your beautiful home."
3144597,30389258,2015-04-21,13311189,Sarah,Nash was a very accommodating host and the location in the neighborhood was perfect for getting downtown and other central neighborhoods quickly. 
3144597,30925665,2015-04-29,18345166,P,"What a delightful stay, extremely convenient location, kind and accommodating host.  The sleeping room was beautifully clean and comfortable, and the facilities included a wonderfully strong shower.  I also appreciated the use of the kitchen for my morning coffee, and more, perhaps, if it had been needed. Thank you, Nash!"
3144597,33922375,2015-06-02,31649952,Benjamin,"Nash was very welcoming and kind, and was able to be very accommodating for my arrival and departure times. The location was great, being in a nice neighborhood situated a moderate and enjoyable walk from the city. The room was bed were very comfortable. I really enjoyed staying there! Nash also had good advice for getting around and things to see. "

3144597,34714419,2015-06-11,210842,David,"Arrived early and was able to get the key easily.  Spent four nice nights in the room before my trip.

The room, bedroom, bed etc were as expected and were absolutely fine. 

The place is a short walk to Capitol Hill which is a haven for great places to eat, coffee, cupcakes, books, records, and other things!"
3144597,35932190,2015-06-23,19260259,Holly,"Wonderful stay, felt extremely welcome, room was just enough for my trip as I was meeting friends for a wedding and not spending much time indoors. Nash, was always available for questions and process was extremely easy. Nash is very friendly and hospitable. Air mattress was good quality and comfortable. I was provided my own towel & use of half the bathroom. Everything was clearly laid out regarding stay. Neighborhood was quiet and safe. Not far from some small coffee shops & grocery stores. I would definitely stay here again! "
3144597,39410532,2015-07-23,3997742,Sarah,"Simple, straightforward, well-lit room in a lovely neighborhood, about 20 minute walk to Capitol Hill. It's a small room, but it was all my friend and I needed for our 3-day stay; we were gone exploring most of the time. Nash was great and easy to talk to; she gave us a number of helpful recommendations for day trips and such. And her dog is adorable! Before booking, note that this room has an air mattress, not a regular bed. "
3144597,40652230,2015-08-01,21228618,Steffi,"Nash was a very accommodating and wonderful host. We were able to let ourselves in and out easily, and it was nice being greeted by her cute little terrier (so well-behaved!). The air mattress was comfortable, and stay inflated for our 3 night stay. Nash prepared for us a list of bus routes within walking distance and nearby places to help us get around easily. We particularly enjoyed her recommendation of the cafe, Queen Bee; their crumpets are a must-try! A fan was kindly provided to help us get through the heat wave going through town. While we didn't see Nash very much, she was friendly to talk to when we had any questions."
3144597,41779504,2015-08-09,6412191,Dan,"My room with Nash was very nice and well located for my plans. Although I was too busy to spend time with her, I felt welcome and everything went smoothly with the logistics of my visit."
3144597,46283618,2015-09-09,38801641,Rebecca,"We were moved to her son's room which was great since there was a bathroom right outside the door.  I was in town for Bumbershoot, so my friends and I had some late nights, the downstairs room was also great since I did not feel like we were disturbing anyone.  I would defiantly stay again.  And the little time I talked to Nash she was lovely"
3144597,46896829,2015-09-14,3619122,Vivek,"Great location- in a very quiet, leafy neighborhood, Safeway/Trader Joe  nearby, yet 15 minutes walk to the Capitol Hill clubs/fun. Nash is a great host and Rhy (the dog) is adorable!"
3144597,47827077,2015-09-21,8536142,Stefhan,Nice quiet private room with an adjacent bathroom in a quiet neighborhood convenient to public transportation and a number of restaurants on Capital Hill. 
3144597,47990049,2015-09-22,40875778,Hiromitsu,"Nash hosted me at her son's room which is private and comfortable place. Good access to Capitol Hill and Pike Place Market, and very calm and green place."

3144597,49121167,2015-10-01,7776627,Elizabeth,"I enjoyed my stay at Nash's place.  The room and bathroom were private.  Her kitchen was a joy to use and her dog is a cute and quiet fellow. The area is a pleasant, quiet neighborhood close to several bus routes, a nice little park and a YMCA.  Several options for buying groceries are within walking distance. Nash is a lovely and calm person with whom I had several interesting and engaging conversations.  She was also very respectful of my need for quiet times. I'd consider staying there again in the future. "
3144597,53175844,2015-11-06,6959744,Ellie,"Nash was a great host and the private bedroom and bathroom were spotless and very comfortable. The place is just a walk from capitol hill which has loads of cool bars,  shops and restaurants. I could not tell recommend this room and host highly enough! "
3144597,54443762,2015-11-20,8618406,Karen,"Nash is a friendly host and our conversations interesting! Unfortunately, our time didn't overlap much, as I usually got home after Nash went to bed, and she was up and out of the house before I woke up. But she was easy to communicate with about my needs, which she accommodated generously.  I slept well each night, and liked that the private bathroom was next to my bedroom. The room itself is separate from the rest of the house because it's on the basement level, so it felt very private. Parking was easy to find closeby, but be careful not to block the brick part across the street next to the park (I received a ticket for parking on an ""unmarked crosswalk,"" even though I didn't block the wheelchair ramp, I didn't know this was considered a crosswalk :( ). It's convenient to Central Co-op and Trader Joes, and Ritual Yoga also nearby has a great special of $40 for a month unlimited- the myofascial release classes were a godsend. Nash's dog Rhy is a sweetie, and in all it was a friendly safe place to stay with a great deal of privacy. Thank you, Nash!"
3144597,55740839,2015-12-05,25098379,Scott,Great place and I had a great stay. Nash met me as planned.  The house is warm and she was very welcoming. Her dog is very friendly! The neighborhood is nice and the house is close to shopping. I had plenty of room and plenty of privacy. 
9596,315791,2011-06-15,522027,Michael,"The minute we step foot down the stairs of the Urban Cottage, we felt right at home.  Cozy, nicely decorated with all the amenities one can ask for.  Nice to look out the windows from the ""living room"" to see greenery.  Urban Cottage was comfortable for the 3 of us--we were on the move, and there was room for one more!  We loved the the neighborhood and the surroundings and enjoyed the easy walk down to the park.  Whenever we left the cottage to go into town, we were always happy to come back and feel at home and enjoy the peacefulness.  We thank you Joyce for your warm hospitality!  "
9596,532874,2011-09-15,423381,Lynne,"Great location.  Walllingford is close to downtown, the Burke-Gilman trail, lots of shops, etc."
9596,1789555,2012-07-24,62825,Gen,"Joyce was an amazing host from the get go. She's very keen on providing you with answers to all the questions you may have on Seattle. Her house is centrally located and stocked with all the amenities and comforts one could dream of (hot tub included). She has a natural way of making you feel welcome and at home, and will even bring you eggs and muffins in the morning. We couldn't have been happier with our stay!"
9596,2010546,2012-08-17,2831020,Erik,"We stayed in the down home for one hot week in Seattle with 4 people. Joyce gave us sightseeing tips on the day of arrival. The house is complete, nice furniture in style. During our stay, Joyce gave us fresh fruit from the garden and was there in case of questions. 
We enjoyed our time in Seattle and if we have new plans to visit Seattle we look forward to stay again in the Down Home."
9596,2037777,2012-08-20,2497314,Barbara,My son and I had a perfect stay at this apartment.  Joyce is a wonderful caring host and had everything we needed for a late arrival.. Milk and coffee were in the refrigerator for the morning.  The location is excellent.  It is walking distance to several great neighborhood coffee shops and to 45th street where everything is happening.  It is a great neighborhood for walking and you feel very safe.
9596,2228152,2012-09-08,2497314,Barbara,Nice place to stay.  Joyce is wonderful and helpful.
9596,3189281,2012-12-30,100754,Teresa,"Our stay was not the usual Airbnb experience, nor it seems a usual stay with Joyce. The bed squeaked horribly, the hot tub was not on during our stay, the coffee pot was not functioning, there were quite a few cob webs about, the bed was not a tempurpedic as advertised and had mildew under it on the plywood base, we had a squirrel chewing in the wall every night and our host changed her ""house rules"" 1/2 way through our stay to add on $75 more for a pet fee and state that the hot tub was normally off during the winter months AFTER we sited our grievances. Thankfully Airbnb takes a ""snap shot"" of the listing when you book so we were not charged.  The ONLY house rule when we booked was ""n.s.""...that's it. We sent photos to airbnb and described the situation. Airbnb refunded about 1/3 of our stay, our host gave us $40 in cash & champagne but we don't drink. We would not stay there again. P.S. Watch your step on the way in..very steep and dangerous, not for someone with any kind of mobility issue."
9596,5472435,2013-07-01,458032,Erik,NIce place. Great location. Easy walking to restaurants and coffee and Gas Works Park on the lake. Quick and easy trips to the city.
9596,5860044,2013-07-20,5536377,Wendi,"My girlfriends and I had a wonderful stay in Joyce's home. We had the main house and this down stairs apartment. Everyone enjoyed the lovely garden, neighborhood and of course the classic turn of the 
century home. 
Joyce was helpful and welcoming. She made us feel right at home. "
9596,7477095,2013-09-22,524675,Sally,"My husband, son and I really enjoyed our time in the downstairs apartment in Wallingford.  Joyce has made the apartment welcoming, comfortable and created a lovely homely atmosphere with character of a country cottage.  The beds are really comfortable and the place is quiet at night - I had some of my best sleeps here during my 1 month long USA trip.  Her place is set in a beautiful garden and tree lined street and yet, up the road there are an array of great shops, restaurants, galleries, parks and the Fremont Troll.  I loved staying in the Wallingford / Fremont area plus the bus is 2 minute walk and a 15 minute ride downtown to the major attractions of Seattle.  

Joyce is also a helpful and fantastic host and she will give you lots of tips of things to see and places to eat and shop plus maps!  We highly recommend!
"
9596,8093141,2013-10-15,8989897,Karla,Joyce was a great host and more than accommodating to our group. The welcoming wine and bread were a very special touch after our long drive. We appreciated the hospitality. Thank you for allowing us to use your home during our trip. - the Canadian Crew.
9596,8404754,2013-10-29,8391378,David,"We enjoyed an long week stay at Joyce's place.  It is a quiet location central to great shopping, bus lines and wonderful restaurants.  It is easy to catch a bus downtown and to other locations in Seattle.  Everything was as it is described in her description.  The bed was very comfortable, the kitchen is well equipped and the living room is spacious.  There is also Internet and satellite TV.  We were not disappointed and would do it again. "
9596,14601155,2014-06-23,1382567,Isabel,"Hi, we had a good experience at the down home. It was clean and Joyce was responsive and accommodating."
9596,15856660,2014-07-17,4913051,Mary,"Hi,
Joyce was an excellent host.  the down-home flat was clean and met our needs very well while attending our son's wedding in Seattle.  Seemed like anything that came up whether we needed needle and thread or bandaids, iron, ironing board, it was available.  The front patio was great for morning coffee and the weather made it exceptional.  
Joyce was very responsive to emails and phone calls etc.  and quickly took care of any issues.  Thankyou to Joyce.  "
9596,16199821,2014-07-23,291456,Dennis,"The place was great, clean and well prepared. Joyce left us to ourselves which was very welcome. The apartment was spacious enough for all three of us and the price was really great. Fresh water was provided via a Brita Water Filter, I think I might have to get one of those now :) Definitely recommended to live here if you're in the area."
9596,16895496,2014-08-04,3270997,Jimmy,"This was my first time ever staying in a basement. It was an interesting experience. Joyce left us a small bowl of fruits and the local paper and was hands off for the rest of the week.

The apt was neither too close or too far from any of the popular spots. If you're thinking of napping or sleeping in bring earplugs. There were moments when I thought the tenants above us were moving out and about to fall through the ceiling. Very efficient use of space."
9596,18245969,2014-08-24,7943476,Victoria,"The place was lovely and the beds soooo comfy.  We didn't actually meet Joyce, but she left fresh picked plums at our door. 
It's a great location. Close to good restaurants/coffee shops/bars. The bus links were adequate,  but i am a Londoner and used to great public transport.  
Very friendly place.  I would recommend you stay here.  "
9596,18876750,2014-09-02,5743413,Tawna,"The apartment was nice and comfortable. Plenty of room for my husband, myself and his mother. The only thing to consider is that the stairs into the apartment are very steep, so be aware if you have young children or elderly. Otherwise it was perfect for our needs. Joyce has put together a nice little spot for her guests. It is central to all of the Seattle hotspots. Definitely would stay here again, if we find ourselves overnighting in Seattle again. Thanks Joyce!!!
"
9596,20041707,2014-09-22,7433793,Peggi,"Had a  wonderful time.... Joyce was kind enough to have baked us a delicious loaf of bread, which we devoured! We didn't  want for anything.  Place is very clean and comfortable, the beds were absolutely WONDERFUL! Great location. We plan on staying again when we come to Seattle to visit family!"
9596,20425660,2014-09-29,19534115,Lisa,This is a great basement apartment within walking distance of great stores and restaurants in Wallingford!  We loved our time here and Joyce even welcomed our Golden Retriever with open arms (and dog treats)!  
9596,33513624,2015-05-29,31459664,Rob,"My daughter and her three friends had a great experience in the down home. The apartment was spacious and clean with several very comfortable beds. Joyce was a great host who offered advice about navigating the area and made sure they had everything they might need during their stay. She even brought down some breakfast on the first morning before they had a chance to go shopping. Parking was available on the street and the location was within walking distance to Fremont and the bus stop. 

Five Stars. 


"
9596,35371555,2015-06-18,10927,Shelly,"The listing was confusing for us.  The host's attempt to list 3 different units with a single listing creates complete confusion.  The pics show the outdoor amenities that are not made available to each of the 3 units.  We thought we would return each afternoon after a day of site seeing and relax outdoors.  Use of the outdoor amenities were restricted from the tenants of the down home unit.

There are a set of concrete stairs without handrails that are not shown in the listing's pics. Tenants of the down home basement apartment are required to use the concrete stairs to gain access.  My parents are elderly and were not able to safely maneuver the concrete stairs that were necessary to get from the street to the house and then to the basement apartment.   Had a pic of the concrete stairs been in the listing, we would have booked elsewhere.  We left early due to the stair issue and the safety concern for my parents

The basement apartment was clean and the kitchen had awesome utensils.  The beds were extremely comfortable.  It was nice having WiFi.  The location is close to public transportation and the neighborhood is quiet.  It was super convenient to have the washer and dryer access.  "
9596,35796900,2015-06-22,28922079,Sheryl,"The downstairs unit was perfect for me and my two girlfriends! We stayed for three days and walked to Fremont street and Gasworks park easily. Lots of shops and music venues in walking distance, surprisingly easy parking and a little neighborhood grocery store just a short block away. The neighborhood is very quiet and safe and the house was also very quiet and peaceful. The unit was very clean, there was fruit and coffee waiting and Joyce was available for any questions or concerns. "
9596,36199982,2015-06-26,4334768,Claire,"Joyce was nice, she made us delicious scones for our arrival. The place is pretty much like in the photos, great use of space in that apartment and very comfortable beds. The location is good because north south buses work well in Seattle. The Wallingford street area is nothing to rave about, but Fremont at the bottom of the hill is really great."
9596,37451062,2015-07-07,226321,Nancy,"We had a great time at Joyce's cozy and lovely basement bungalow. She was very accommodating and gracious and had great suggestions on places to visit. Most importantly, beds were first rate and location is perfect for exploring Seattle.  "
9596,38495776,2015-07-16,33112782,Tom,"We absolutely loved staying at Joyce's basement apartment. It was exactly as described, and super cozy. The apartment is very close to a great commercial strip on N 45th St. that had great restaurants, bars, and shops. And it is about 1 mile away from Gas Works Park, which HAS to be one of the best parks in Seattle, amazing views! We were sad leaving, it was such a great area!"
9596,39150036,2015-07-21,15429488,Philippa,Wallingford war uns sofort sympathisch. Alle Gärten und Häuser sind liebevoll gestaltet und wirken einladend. Für die heißen Sommertemperaturen war Joyces down house perfekt. Wir waren drei Generationen und fünf Personen (phone number hidden) und 72 Jahre). Joyce hat uns sehr herzlich empfangen und uns mit den perfekten Tipps für unseren Aufenthalt versorgt. Danke an Joyce. Wir würden sofort wiederkommen. 
9596,40324696,2015-07-30,5747922,Eddie,"Joyce was an excellent host during my stay in Seattle. She provided me with all of the necessary information to make the most of my trip; nice restaurants, places to visit, things to do etc. The apartment was furnished with everything I needed and was very comfortable.

I would highly recommend staying in this accommodation. Joyce is a fantastic host and she was kind enough to arrange my taxi to the airport on the morning of my departure."
9596,42822293,2015-08-16,3741475,Trang,"We stayed in the basement of Joyce's orange house and it was cozy and just right for us, a family of three. Everything was clean and we had the amenities we needed. We used the bedroom and my daughter used the pull-out bed. The small kitchen was useful for quick breakfast in the morning before we went out and about. 

It's centrally located, west of campus and north of downtown area. It was a quick drive to everything. I highly recommend it as a place to stay for a couple or small family."
9596,46893251,2015-09-14,20362062,Nancy,"The down home, central and fab was the perfect location with a lovely, inviting yard in a lovely neighborhood.  The apartment is lovely and super clean.   So nice to be in a daylight basement on hot days!   Thanks, Joyce"
9596,48032697,2015-09-22,38596972,Jenni,"This was our first Airbnb experience and it could not have been better.  Everything was exactly as shown in the photos, the apartment was quiet and very comfortable.  We loved the neighborhood and it was very central to everything.  We were able to walk or take a short Uber ride to most everything we wanted to see and do.   Joyce was very responsive to our questions and an excellent hostess, although she was not in town while we were there, we did appreciate her leaving us snacks, fruit, etc....and we enjoyed meeting her adorable dog, Cleo!  Thank  you Joyce :)"
9596,48414088,2015-09-26,11654970,Carla,We had a great experience at Joyce's place. It was just as the photos depicted. Great location and Joyce got right back to us making our check in and check out a breeze. Quiet home in quiet neighborhood walking distance to restaurants. Very easy commute to downtown Seattle. I would recommend  this location without a doubt. 
7971334,44080592,2015-08-23,5919863,James,Will was a great host. Nice little space in a good neighborhood. Close to everything. 
7971334,44722090,2015-08-28,4313225,Andi,It's in a quiet neighborhood and fairly close to downtown/attractions. Will made it easy to check in and check out. Also you have a private bath.
7971334,44848142,2015-08-29,42076963,Enzio,Very nice and welcoming host. Clean and cozy room. Very convenient location.
7971334,45005917,2015-08-30,31305437,Bryce,"Will was a great and welcoming host.  The room was as stated, in a nice central location and a great place to crash."
7971334,45325420,2015-09-01,17604534,Kathryn,"Will was very welcoming. The room was cozy and private. The room was very close to downtown, and there were some lovely parks nearby as well."
7971334,45609843,2015-09-04,20909348,Heather,"Great location near good bars, coffee and breakfast.

Room was simple, clean and comfortable. Nothing flashy, but did the trick.

Didn't meet the host until the end, but we weren't there long. "
7971334,46027490,2015-09-07,42078558,Lawren,"Will was a friendly and gracious host. The location was great and just as advertised. I would recommend staying here, especially to 20-30 somethings looking for a nice, convenient place to crash."
7971334,46220313,2015-09-08,4682738,Catherine,"Will was great! Very flexible. I was in and out so didn't interact with him much, but he was available and the location is great. "
7971334,46522032,2015-09-11,42505018,Andrew,"Great location! Close to lots of wonderful food, coffee and entertainment and nice walk to the harbor. Will was very accommodating, when our flight came in late he not only had no problem meeting later then our agreed upon time but also gave us directions to his place. When we arrived he showed us to our room,(very comfortable and clean) and helped us with suggestions and directions to places around town. Would stay anytime I am in seattle! "
7971334,46680546,2015-09-12,43784546,Aaron,Really nice guy with great communication !  Unfortunately something came up last minute and we could not stay there !  Would definitely attempt to stay there again ! 
7971334,46946383,2015-09-14,2432721,Parker,Excellent place exactly as described. We loved it!
7971334,47133314,2015-09-15,43090520,Alex,"Will was a great host.
We had a pleasant but short stay and Will helped us with every question that we had."
7971334,47218277,2015-09-16,33171718,Naomi,"We had a lovely stay in Seattle thanks to Will's hospitality. The space was quiet, clean and cute in a lovely neighborhood. Will was very friendly and welcoming. "
7971334,47333649,2015-09-17,6300429,Nicolas,"Will was not exactly welcoming but was happy to answer and give advice when asked about restaurant or such.
About the room, here are the good and bad in our experience.
Starting with the good, it is close to Trader Joe and Biocoop (about 10min walk) and probably 20min walk to get to Broadway Ave of Capitol Hill. The bed is comfortable and the bathroom was clean. The “window” give on a quiet back alley.
However, the room is a basement as more than half the wall of the room is belowground. The bathroom is not “our own” as it was used by others in the house (there goes the “romantic” of the room); we had to ask for toilet paper and there was only one towel instead of two. We can use the kitchen but the sink and kitchen counters were very dirty, so you don’t really feel like cooking anything. I also doubt it is possible to walk downtown in 30mn (though a bus can get you there in less than that).
Overall, in spite of the little note on the wall of the room where Will wishes his guests to have a 5 star experience in his room, we can only give a 1.5 star experience. It’s ok for one night and the location, especially because the night was at $52 (however, Will has since increased his room price to $129 per night which I believe is way too much given the room and facilities).
"
7971334,47520236,2015-09-19,420291,Saima,Will's room is clean and cute. It was great having our own level with a private bathroom. The area is very quaint and quiet. Will was very helpful in answering our questions and we felt right at home. I'll definitely come back if I could. 
7971334,47856321,2015-09-21,39178611,Travis,This was a great spot near downtown that my girlfriend and I used as our base when we weren't out exploring. Will was very polite and quick to respond to all communication. 
7971334,47941982,2015-09-21,33474096,Wade,"I really liked Will's place. The bed was super comfortable, so much so that I slept in accidentally. The location was also great. I was 10 minutes from where I needed to be the next day in the middle of downtown."
7971334,48350051,2015-09-25,44026773,Luis,Neighborhood and house was very quiet which worked great for me.  I was here for work so peaceful place to recharge fit the bill.  However parking is on the city street and more random than expected so be aware you may have to walk some to get to the door.
7971334,48777332,2015-09-28,43647591,Alex,"The room was what I expected (size, comfort, etc.), and Will served as a great host. Really comfortable room and the price was excellent. Had an awesome experience. "
7971334,49164174,2015-10-01,44468371,Adeline,"Will was a fine host. He gave us great recommendations on cool places to eat and drink. The room was comfortable, and the private bathroom was a definite plus. The apartment is ideally located. It's in a quite alley way away from traffic, yet very close to the animated Capitol Hill."
7971334,49401135,2015-10-03,32486035,Brandon,"Awesome place! Very welcoming and nice. The bedroom and washroom are nice, clean, and private. The neighborhood is also fantastic and located near any type of stores you could need. "
7971334,49689259,2015-10-05,44526735,Kadie,"PRIME location. Walking distance to coffee shops (try Queen Bee), grocery stores (Safeway), poppin' nightlife and restaurants. The bedroom and bathroom are the perfect size for 2, you'll get the whole bottom floor to yourselves and it's totally quiet. We had the BEST weekend at Will's, for sure would stay again. Thanks Will!"
7971334,49845570,2015-10-06,39071409,Cory,I arrived late around 9:30pm on a Sunday.  There wasn't very much parking at that time because everyone is at home then but during the day there were plenty of spots. Will was welcoming even though I had showed up late. He showed me to my room and was happy to recommend any restaurants if I wanted. The room and bathroom were clean.  The neighborhood was very nice and safe.   I slept great. 
7971334,50522440,2015-10-12,7003907,Juju,"Nice location and neighborhood. The unit was kind of hard to find but Will was easy to contact so he met me by the street. 

There were couple things that weren't accurate on the listing: 

1) Based on the listing, I was under the impression that I was getting a private unit with it's own bath. When I arrived Will told me that the landlord's friend was given my room so I was offered another room with a shared bath instead. He apologized for the mix up but after arriving from a 10 hour flight, I just wanted a bed to sleep on. The bed sheets didn't seem laundered. The bathroom was a bit dirty, but I guess that's expected when it's shared. 

2) ""Free Parking on Premises"" listed on amenities. I was told to park on the street. I arrived late Friday evening and was lucky to find an open spot on the street. 2nd night had to find parking a few houses down the street. 

Overall my experience was okay, I wasn't expecting 5-star experience. I just needed a cheap, no-frills place to sleep for a couple nights which is what I got. Will was a gracious host and was very helpful."
7971334,54296362,2015-11-17,8913827,Srevatsan,"Will is a great host. The first day i was suppose to reach his place at 10:00 pm, instead I reached at 11. He was awake and was completely fine about the delay. On the last day while I had to check out at 3:00 pm, I picked my luggage back only at 7:00pm and he was really nice about that. 

The room is a compact and a neat one. It is well priced for the size. Has good heaters and such and is private. "
7971334,54964878,2015-11-25,35179841,Daniel,"Will was very accommodating and getting settled down was straight forward. This place is located in a the prime area, so walking down to the streets to shop or eat was a breeze! 

The only downside I personally feel is that the bathroom, or rather the bath tub could do some servicing, as the water took forever to be drained out. "
7971334,57176817,2015-12-22,41559674,Mayumi,"Wii and his house was totally great !!
That's why he's gotten ５star experience. 

 I was really satisfied staying there as feel like I'm in a my house .

The location is so convenient to access anywhere downtown, Capitol Hill and so on.

Of course, l'll recommend his house !!
"
7971334,58090220,2015-12-31,52110292,Garima,Very comfortable. Room was pretty cosy and well maintained. 
6938103,38063830,2015-07-12,26918452,Sonya,"Brady provided all necessities for a comfortable stay. The room was comfy and quiet and within walking distance to activities at the University of Washington.

Brady was friendly, always responded quickly and was flexible in adding additional nights when plans changed.  "
6938103,38660929,2015-07-17,9073481,Chris,"Brady was a friendly and clear communicator, so I had no problem checking in and getting settled. The place is pretty much as pictured. Comfortable and homey, pretty close to some parks, restaurants and bars, and a short bike ride (and reasonable walk) from UW. The backyard is the best element of the place (for summer), a great spot to sit in the afternoon or evening and enjoy the space. The bathroom is shared with guests in another room, and both rooms connect directly to the bathroom, so privacy is not absolute. Was fine for me but could be an issue for more private folks."
6938103,41809998,2015-08-09,38112995,Randi,"Brady was very accommodating and really helped make our stay nice. The room was clean, the cats are cute, and he even provide snacks! Great place to stay for the university district. "
6523393,38148941,2015-07-13,21790315,Rachael,"I stayed here with one other person for a few days on our road trip up north from LA. We were Christy's first AirBnb-ers, and her space was perfect. It is the apartment underneath the main house which is accessible from the front gate as pictured, as well as the back gate that leads out to an alley connecting to the street. Everything was very nicely furnished, and although we didn't use the kitchen on this part of the trip, we noticed it was very well stocked (including even extra items such as a juicer and blender on the shelf) and would be a great place to cook meals. The bathroom was very clean, and the couch was mega-comfortable.
Christy was very sweet. She gave us a tour of the place upon our arrival and gave some recommendations for eating spots in the area. Her two dogs are so cute and really friendly.
Although you can get a guest parking pass that allows you to park on the street overnight, parking is really tough in this neighborhood (and just Seattle in general it seemed). We knew someone living in the neighboring apartment who let us use their space, so luckily we didn't have trouble with it. If you're bringing one or more cars, I'd ask about alternatives to this street just in case.
Overall, we liked the little apartment very much, especially its location. It's a short walk down to Lake Union where one could enjoy the view and look at the waterfront houses. Good eating places in the area too, and it's close to neighboring areas/attractions. Thanks Christy!"
6523393,39038349,2015-07-20,9494235,Antonina,Christy was easy to get a hold of and responded to questions quickly. Great location. You get a whole apartment to yourself. There is a kitchen and a great lounge area. Highly recommended. 
6523393,39307953,2015-07-22,24040753,Ben,"Fantastic little apartment in a nice neighborhood. Great hosts, great stay."
6523393,39566533,2015-07-24,38788076,Majid,"Christy responded to every question I had very promptly, and arranged for my arrival to be quick and easy even though she couldn't be present at the time. The apartment is cozy and private, and very close to coffee shops and restaurants on Eastlake. I felt right at home the two nights I spent there and will definitely stay again if I have the opportunity."
6523393,39941002,2015-07-27,3064455,Alison,"This was my first Airbnb rental, and what a great experience it was! My husband and I and our 2 little girls stayed in Christy's apartment, and it was absolutely perfect for us. The aparen't was very clean, spacious, nicely decorated and had everything could need. Christy went out of her way to make our stay great, from getting us a pack n play and extra mattress for our girls to turning on twinkle lights when my husband and I were enjoying the garden during one evening. 
The neighborhood was very safe and cute with restaurants, bars, coffee shops and little markets right around the corner. And it was a quick 5 minute bus ride into downtown.  
Traveling with 2 babies can be stressful, but it was definitely a positive experience staying at Christy's."
6523393,40281124,2015-07-29,1559052,Maggie,Communication with Christy was a breeze. Her beautiful basement apartment is located in a very easy part of Seattle to get to and from. The buses are close and run frequently just a block away. I would recommend her BNB to any of my friends without reservation. 
6523393,40769444,2015-08-02,36698299,Kami,"Loved this place - totally convenient to downtown, and zipcars on the next block"
6523393,40936428,2015-08-03,748845,Vanessa,"We had a great stay in Christy's downstairs apartment. The house is in a quiet neighborhood but close to everything we needed. The front garden is so pretty and her two cute dogs welcomed us when we came in! The apartment itself is cozy and had everything we needed, including being pet friendly! 
We didn't do any cooking but there were lots of tools and supplies should you need to. There were four adults in our group and two of us were more than comfortable on the large L-shaped couch. Christy left an extra mattress for us just in case but we were fine without it! 
Thank you again! "
6523393,41951503,2015-08-10,34948070,Sean,The description was spot on and the place was very spacious! I would definitely recommend this place to other people!
6523393,42869649,2015-08-16,12340206,Beth,"The host made my 3 friends and I feel very comfortable and welcome. The airbnb was very clean, private, and cute. The listing description was accurate, and the host family (living directly above through a separate entrance) was very sweet and accommodating. The neighborhood was very clean and attractive, walking distance from some cafes, bars, and the waterfront. "
6523393,43084264,2015-08-17,11415475,Randy,Very nice place!  Great location and neighborhood.
6523393,43686819,2015-08-21,26019364,Alex,great location.  hosts very attentive and welcoming.
6523393,44188350,2015-08-24,40401090,Laura,"We absolutely loved this unit and Christy was an exceptionally accommodating host. The apartment was very spacious, reasonably quiet, and private. We didn't even have the chance to take advantage of its full kitchen and comfortable living room. It's in an excellent, central location in the greater Seattle area

This will be my first stop when looking for a place to stay for future trips to Seattle."
6523393,45374422,2015-09-02,683292,Leo,"I booked Christy's place for a whole week for my parents' visit. We live just down the street and it was superbly convenient.

Christy was incredibly flexible in meeting us for the keys so we could stock the space prior with fun things that they love prior to the their arrival. Christy's family is just precious and all of them are incredibly welcoming, and that includes the dogs!

The space itself is adorable, a fully self-contained basement apartment with good light. It was very quiet, clean, comfortable and my parents instantly commented on how cozy and usable it was.

We are people who love to cook and Christy has stocked the space full of cooking utensils and appliances, which made it very easy. We made a few feasts!

My parents, during the stay, always commented on the place's quietness, and comfort. ""Much better than staying at a hotel"", they said.

I'd highly recommended staying here or, in our case, book it for your visiting guests. Thank you, Christy and family!"
6523393,46125089,2015-09-08,35035792,Kirinina,"I booked this great place for two of my family members who wanted to visit me. Christy and family were wonderful. I told them I was their neighbor and they invited us over for the 4th to see the place early and get to know them, and to make sure the accommodations would suit my family. The place is a one bedroom basement apartment with a private entry, kitchen, living, and bath. It is spotlessly clean, and very awesomely decorated with a fantastic mural in the bedroom. The bed is super comfy- So I was told, as was the huge couch. They have thought of everything someone would need, from extra towels to  all the normal kitchen equipment. They are easy to get a hold of, and wonderful to chat with. We are definitely booking again for my family's next visit!"
6523393,46632887,2015-09-12,17384855,Lindsey,"We had a great stay here. The apartment is clean, large, and well-stocked with linens, kitchen items, and maps/brochures about Seattle.  Communication with the owners and check-in/out was easy. We especially appreciated Christy providing a pack and play for our young daughter to sleep in. The apartment is just a few blocks from a ""pocket park"" on the water, a lovely coffee shop, a park, and a convenient bus stop to downtown. This apartment is below the owners' home and we heard some noise from above, but you wouldn't expect from the the owner's description. Great neighborhood and apartment!"
6523393,48654258,2015-09-27,41112217,Steven,"Great location. Easy access, good communication, place was clean and very well kept. The hosts make sure you have anything you might need! Very friendly, pleasure to meet them as well. Highly recommended! "
6523393,49154718,2015-10-01,18874365,Corey,Such a great neighborhood and family! We were able to walk a lot during our trip! The basement apartment is a perfect size for 2-3 people! They were also very accommodating and responsive! Thanks so much!
6523393,49348807,2015-10-03,18209201,Jamie,"This was a really cute, clean basement apartment, just like the pictures show (quite large also!).   I was really only there to sleep since I was in town for work, but was cozy and comfortable. The neighborhood, a few restaurants and coffee shops less than 2 blocks away, easy access to freeway, etc.  Easy check-in and check out. "
6523393,50706920,2015-10-13,45698275,Aaron,Christy and family made us feel at home for a week.  Great location and even parking is available on the street!  Just ask for a parking zone permit to hang in the car.  Quiet neighborhood and excellent play area at the park nearby.  Loved the stay.
6523393,51399125,2015-10-19,7107599,Gerrit,"I had a great experience staying at Christy's place during my first trip to Seattle. The place is beautiful, the location was perfect, and everything is as described in the listing. Christy was very accommodating and we felt very comfortable during our stay.

I would highly recommend this place!"
6523393,52945368,2015-11-02,33523260,Mark,Everything was great with Christy. She was very responsive and accommodating. And the apartment had fruit snacks!! Highly recommend this one. 
6523393,53096222,2015-11-04,46183843,Kyrsten,"The location was amazing - literally 5 minutes from downtown, 10 during rush hour. We got to and from Bellevue and the U District easily, too. The had Cliff Bars and fruit snacks and apples to eat, which was really great and a pack and play for the little ones. The furniture was nothing spectacular, but comfy enough (my husband loved their furniture). Communication was quick and when we realized there wasn't a DVD player for a movie night, Russ brought down their personal one. If you're a light sleeper or need absolute silence - they have a small dog that barks whenever people come to the gate and small (adorable) kids who run around a bit upstairs, so you'll hear pitter-pattering. We didn't mind the noise at all, though, it certainly wasn't overwhelming and it stopped plenty of time before bedtime. The bathroom and floors were very modern and nice :) We would definitely recommend the place!"
6523393,54170029,2015-11-16,6991537,Rachel,Staying here was fantastic! Christy was very friendly and the space was great. It was perfect to be out of the center but still close enough to enjoy it. 
6523393,54539785,2015-11-21,34778870,Kyle,This place was more than what we expected. It was close to everything and the host even let us extend our stay. I will definitely book here again.
6523393,54729211,2015-11-23,22461881,Andy,Everything was accurate.  Great little apt right in the middle of the Eastlake Neighborhood.
6412566,36461622,2015-06-28,36083329,Ellen,"The place was great. It was easy to find, close to the airport and all of the attractions in Seattle and the view is even better then the picture. It was quiet and we felt safe. Would love to come back again if ever in Seattle again. Very nice indeed."
6412566,37177412,2015-07-05,34267873,Vanessa,"We loved staying at the Sunset Grotto! The rooms were very nicely decorated and Krystal was a great host. She is very prompt with all questions and concerns. The location of the Grotto can't be beat- close to the beach, the Junction, and a short car ride to downtown."
6412566,37812290,2015-07-10,37013610,Eddie Sungsoo,"Amazing location, amazing place. 
everythings are ready for the guests.
I would traveling Seattle again for just stay in this place."
6412566,38674661,2015-07-17,25546242,Ted,The place had amazing views and was in a great part of West Seattle!  It was definitely functional for our quick trip to Seattle. 
6412566,38764073,2015-07-18,33687719,Nicholas,"Great communication before arrival, nicely labeled entrance and parking spot, clean, nice view. No complaints"
6412566,39050821,2015-07-20,36535720,Douglas,Krystal was a great host and we enjoyed our stay at the grotto.  Great location.  Convenient to restaurants on California Ave.  Good view of the Sound.  The grotto is comfortable.  we slept well on the bed.  shower was solid.  The communication on entry was clear.  All around great experience for those seeking a quiet place to say when enjoying West Seattle and the surrounding area. 
6412566,39311633,2015-07-22,36884900,Anita,"Krystal was most accommodating and Sunset Grotto was  true to the description  put forth.
A  colorful sunset view and a good night's sleep was  a fine start to my Seattle visit."
6412566,39706919,2015-07-25,5672885,Erika,Our stay was very enjoyable and had all of the amenities we needed including a comfortable couch and large screen TV. The apartment is the downstairs level of a family home with a private entrance from the backyard and a parking spot in the back alley. Check-in was very easy and Krystal was prompt in getting back to us whenever we had any questions or concerns. The location was great and very close to Alki beach. 
6412566,40805578,2015-08-02,27608127,Richard,"This is a both a terrific space and location. I rented the lower level of the house, which consists of private entrance, bedroom (real bed), living/family room, kitchen area w/full size fridge, utencils, plates, glasses, etc., plus bathroom. Very comfortable and clean.  Also a welcome letter from the host, which made it clear how to reach them with any questions or trouble.  Location is close to the beach, downtown & Freeways, plus neighborhood shopping.  This was a good experience and I would both recommend this listing to others, and come back."
6412566,41790093,2015-08-09,37185304,Tinashe  & Aimee,"The place delivered everything that was promised. Parking was great, proximity to the beach and the city was perfect. This will be our first choice when we visit again!!"
6412566,42865178,2015-08-16,36423495,Mary,"Krystal was a great host. She is very friendly and easy to communicate with. Always texted me back within a couple of minutes. The grotto is very nice and comfortable and in a beautiful, safe neighborhood. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. I definitely want to go back next year if my relative still lives in Seattle. "
6412566,43423335,2015-08-19,17939272,Laura,"The Grotto was all ready for us when we arrived, after a looooong delay at the airport! We were so happy with the accommodations and the location is close to the most wonderful bakery on California Street.  Krystal gave us our privacy, which was much appreciated. "
6412566,43729374,2015-08-21,9861226,Maude,"Great appartment in a quiet neighborhood, located only 15 minutes (outside of rush hours) away from Pike Place Market, Olympic Sculpture Park and other fun Seattle attractions. Krystal was very accomodating, easy to communicate with and replied to all our questions super fast. Our only complaint would be the bugs: we spent very minimal time in the grotto- literally left around 8-9 am and came back around 10-11 pm at night - but we still had an encouter with 4 big spiders on the bedroom wall...so if spiders are not your fave, bare that in mind!"
6412566,44837279,2015-08-29,41708343,Myles,Krystal was great and supplied an extra cot and sheets for us. The apartment was awesome! The restaurants near the Alki beach were fantastic and the view was amazing.
6412566,46178472,2015-09-08,9121756,Alex,"We had a wonderful time in Seattle, the place was just what we needed with a little extra. It was spacious and clean. Krystal even provided clean towels and soaps. We were given ultimate privacy and left to explore the city. She was quick and fast with a response to text. I would definitely stay again if I travel to Seattle anytime in the future. "
6412566,46431393,2015-09-10,43007473,Ashley,Krystal's property is an incredible place to stay and has quite the view of Seattle from Alki Beach. I will recommend her place when asked always. Krystal was also very inviting and helpful in assisting us with our needs while visiting. 
6412566,47375945,2015-09-18,867351,Rv,Neighborhood is nice. View from front window great. Garden path confusing after dark!
5433597,29770006,2015-04-12,12711617,Milie,Arnaud was a very good host! He came to meet us and made sure we had everything. He was very responsive to any question we had and promptly ordered things as needed for the house. The house was very clean and in a very cute neighborhood. House is very modern and up to date! Would stay here again. Only thing was the water pressure in the showers were very low. 
5433597,35666466,2015-06-21,30775163,Lindsay,"Arnaud made us feel very welcome...he even met us at the house because we must have been brain-dead from the long trip and couldn't find the key.
The house was very well described and equiped.  Great location, very clean and spacious.  Nice outdoor patio with seating.  "
5433597,38389462,2015-07-15,19310750,Amber,"Property was as it appears in the photos - very modern and clean with a well-appointed kitchen, three bathrooms, and laundry.  Appliances, fixtures, etc. appeared new.  The location was excellent, with very convenient access to both I-5 and Aurora.  Only 7 blocks from the zoo, and also an easy walk to various restaurants in the neighborhood, including those along Green Lake if you're willing to walk a little farther.  Phinney is a very busy street at nearly all hours with buses, etc. so if you have to have the windows open when it's hot there will be traffic noise.  Only other downside was that street parking can be a hassle - you could always find a space, it just might require some searching.  Arnaud was available to answer questions promptly via text.  "
5433597,39735285,2015-07-26,29632130,Brianne,"We really enjoyed our stay at Arnaud's town home. It was in a great location. There is so much to explore nearby - the lake, the zoo, the shopping. The space worked well for two couples, and it was a plus to have our own bathrooms. The kitchen was well equipped. Arnaud had set out a bottle of sparkling water and sparking wine for our use, and complimentary coffee, too. We felt very welcome. Would certainly stay there again!"
5433597,41736412,2015-08-09,1649864,Kara,"Arnaud was a wonderful host. He gave us great recommendations for places to eat in the neighborhood and was flexible with our check-in and check-out time. The house is lovely, very comfortable and we would definitely stay there again. The neighborhood is really nice as well, with some great brunch options nearby and we had no problem finding street parking. If you're considering staying here, I'd strongly encourage you to do so. "
5433597,50755022,2015-10-14,22137210,Doug,"Great house, in a nice neighborhood in Seattle.  Pretty quiet but only 15 minutes or less to downtown Seattle.  Thanks."
5433597,55189181,2015-11-29,881457,Aaron,"Great neighborhood, wonderful home, fantastic hosts, very easy and useful communications / instructions!"
146301,3347737,2013-01-14,3189926,Catherine,"This place was great! Laura was communicative and very easy to deal with. The house was perfect for our needs and was prepared with lots of thoughtful touches! There was a small gift basket with snacks, the dish washing liquid and laundry detergent were environmentally friendly and the home felt welcoming and clean. I would definitely recommend this property to anyone wanting a place to stay in Seattle!"
146301,4733390,2013-05-22,2127619,Scott,"West Seattle and this cottage were perfect! Having only stayed in Seattle ""proper"" before we found the location much nicer and easier... having a parking spot is a plus! Our son was delighted to find a toy box (I would have never noticed it!) and as my wife put it, it had everything we needed for a last minute family trip. Thank you!"
146301,25569586,2015-01-19,21465532,Hop Alex,"Great, quiet neighborhood. Laura requested an extra cleaning fee even though we scrubbed her floors and took off our shoes. Even though there's no clause saying we can't have a small gathering, she will assume a party if there is a lot of trash, which is understandable. Laura won't have problems with you, just don't create a lot of trash. "
146301,33108736,2015-05-25,30738977,Jennifer,We had a great stay at the Full Moon Cottage. The home was well prepared for us and everything we needed and expected was there. Laura was very prompt is answering questions prior to booking to make sure it was the right place for our Seattle visit. 
146301,33799351,2015-06-01,2094605,Tony,"This is a wonderful house, beautifully appointed with special touches by the host.  It is conveniently located in walking distance of beautiful downtown.  We plan to stay here again."
146301,36211847,2015-06-26,3681973,Greg,"Accurate description, great value. We have two small children and naps/bedtimes weren't disturbed by either of the neighboring businesses. The host went out of their way to accommodate us and we appreciate it. Would recommend"
146301,36691989,2015-06-30,28365744,Donna,Everything was just wonderful. Met our needs completely and provided a great place to explore Seattle from. Laura gave completely sufficient instructions and was excellent with communication. Thanks so much. 
146301,50510718,2015-10-12,42225964,Laura,The beds were comfortable the house was warm and the location was the best! I recently stayed at Laura's cottage in west Seattle and we all really enjoyed our stay. The one thing we loved most was you can literally walk down the street to get anything you want from the best bakery in the world to art supplies to entertainment. It's also not a bad drive to downtown Seattle.
146301,51135642,2015-10-18,40830700,Heidi,"We had a great family trip! The house was well equipped with plenty of towels, blankets and other homely amenities. The house is in a great location too. Thank you!"
146301,55741592,2015-12-05,1264352,Rachel,"The home was very nicely arranged, and the hosts made us feel very welcome. Everything we needed for our stay was provided. We definitely enjoyed our stay. "
611500,1988037,2012-08-14,2732574,Yoshie,"There are mainly five reasons why you should stay at Keith&Cherie's place if you were still wondering where to stay.

1. They have clean& big bedrooms with comfy beds
2. It's at very convenient location: between downtown Seattle and Sea-Tac
3. They help you with transportation to/from the city or to/from the airport
4. The host is very helpful, responsive, and responsible when you need help
5. Keith and Cherie are super chill!

There are more reasons, but I rather let you discover when you actually stay there:)

Thank you so much for your hospitality and friendliness!

"
611500,2045142,2012-08-20,1303542,Frank,"Although our check-in time was uncertain, Keith made sure he was there to greet us for our late check-in and also took the time to show us around the place. The place was much more preferable to any hotel in Seattle and close to downtown. Had everything you may need for your stay, including Wi-Fi and a full kitchen. I'm not one to usually leave reviews, UNLESS someone truly deserves one (good or bad). This is one of those times, I give Keith and his place a very high recommendation. Wish other hosts/businesses could learn from him."
611500,2101904,2012-08-26,1580549,Megan,"Keith and Cherie were very kind, helpful hosts! The location is good, a few blocks from the light rail (Mt. Baker station) and bus lines, which can bring you easily downtown. The beds were comfortable."
611500,3218505,2013-01-02,3939885,Simon,"We booked 3 nights over New Year for family of five and only stayed one night. The details on AirBnB sounded nice, however the apartment was of a very poor standard and would need a lot of work to bring it up to an acceptable level.  Issues included worn furniture, heavily marked carpets in all bedrooms, worn out flooring in kitchen and open study area next to lounge (study area was being used by owner for storage). No dining table or chairs in the apartment.  Kitchen old and needed a good clean, was poorly equipped and short of china, flatware, cooking utensils,  no kettle or coffee maker, (although coffee maker left on doorstep later that evening).  Odd collection of old mugs. There were disposable plates and cutlery that we could use. 

No sign of washer and dryer mentioned in description (but we did not ask about this). There was no place to hang up clothing in two of the bedrooms; doors to wardrobes were all locked.  Water did not run out of sink in one bathroom.  Description stated 3 bathrooms but there were only 2.  Bathrooms, bedding and towels were clean.   
 
The owner, Keith, does seem a nice approachable man and we did reach an agreement regarding a partial refund, and AirBnB helped expedite this.

Overall a big disappointment 
"
611500,4230161,2013-04-20,5836316,Rich,"Keith is a warm and engaging entrepreneurial spirit with deep connections to his neighborhood in Seattle's wonderfully diverse and energetic south end. The accommodations were generous and perfectly situated for us, close to downtown and the Central District and every kind of shop and service we required.

Our group of three travelers were booked to perform at a nearby  music venue and the location could not have been more convenient. Keith was attentive and flexible with our schedule at check in and check out.

One tip, Keith's spot is about 6 blocks from the Beacon Hill light-rail station which provides frequent service downtown and to the airport from about 6am to 12am every day.  This is a great way to  get in and move about the town."
611500,4908032,2013-06-01,5787935,Peter,Kieth and Cherie made my trip to Seattle both dynamic and fun. I have no complaints and would recommend staying in their home.
611500,5139444,2013-06-14,6883032,Brian,"In a fun neighborhood. Clean, private place to stay."
611500,5828750,2013-07-18,6883643,Anna,Reasonable price and good house. We were very comfortable there with our big family. The distance from all major sight seeing was surprisingly short. Very convenient location. Kids loved the fact that every room had a TV and Netflix. Thank you guys for hosting us!
611500,6166929,2013-08-01,7766772,Sam,"The place was great, and perfect for our group of 8 people.  Cherie was an amazing host and stayed in contact with us throughout our stay even helping to make sure we all got our spare car keys after we left one set at the house.  Thank you for helping us to have a great night off."
611500,6809190,2013-08-26,6949805,Fred,great spot in an interesting neighborhood. Lots of space good for groups . very clean and easy check in . Prez and Cherie were real nice 
611500,7135227,2013-09-08,7208060,Andrea,"There was a big group of us staying at Prez and Cherie's, and I know that can be a lot to handle.  Prez showed up early to let us in (we'd been on the road for quite a few hours), and showed us around.  We were ASTONISHED by how clean and well stocked the place was.  We have rented other places before, but we have NEVER, NEVER, NEVER had a place stocked with coffee, water, A HUGE BOWL OF CANDY (AWESOME!), amenities, and so many extras.  It was truly like being at home and a great experience after being on the road for so long.

The beds were super comfy, the extra bedding and linens were clean, and the bathroom was well stocked with anything we could have forgotten.  The bedrooms are tidy, there is tons of room to hang stuff, and a lot of provided hangers and places for shoes.  We had one person without a bed, and Prez brought over not one, but two air mattresses for us to choose from. 
There are tons of dishes for use, a blender, toaster, microwave, and every other appliance you can imagine, so this was great for breakfast in the morning, snacking, and preparing snacks for the road.  Also, there were FRESH FLOWERS on the table.  I wouldn't have been surprised to see fake ones, but the fresh flowers were such a great touch and showed that Prez and Cherie really cared.

We didn't get the pleasure of meeting Cherie, but we did meet Ali, Prez's dad, and he was the most dapper, sweet, and handsome gentleman.  He drove all of us ladies (and one guy) to a wedding, picked us up on time, and told us a bit about the city.  It was a fantastic experience and made our trip stress-free.
If you rent from Prez and Cherie, I would suggest Prez's towncar/party bus service for getting around.  

We had a fantastic time, and I plan on going back to Seattle soon.  I will never get a hotel again as long as Prez and Cherie have places listed to rent.

Thanks again, Prez and Cherie for a FANTASTIC place to stay.  We appreciate it greatly and would definitely recommend your place to anyone!
