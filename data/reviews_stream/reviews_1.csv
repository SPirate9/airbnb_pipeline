1707064,53970852,2015-11-15,44530339,Brad,Great location for exploring the City and what a great apartment.  We had a lot of fun at the upstairs lounge and the bartenders are very friendly.  Nothing but positive things to say about our experience.  
1707064,54462077,2015-11-20,27100505,Alex,"Amanda was very accommodating.  Every question/concern I had was addressed promptly.  She was very friendly.  The apartment was clean, conveniently located, cozy, and very well decorated!  It was a nice place to settle in for the night after a busy day in Seattle.  I would highly recommend this location to others.  "
1707064,55426531,2015-12-01,5564915,Yijing,"The apartment was an absolute delight. It was not a huge place but has everything we needed. The location was perfect. Walking distance to Pike's Place and downtown malls. So much great food around the neighborhood! Cory and Amanda also gave us a list of restaurants and go-to places in Seattle, which was really thoughtful and helpful! Unfortunately we didn't get to meet Cory and Amanda much personally (since we were having a blast exploring the gorgeous city). Thanks for giving us such a beautiful memory with Seattle!"
7219838,42473773,2015-08-13,38510581,Justine,"Alexa was awesome! Communication about key and address were clear, and it was easy to find/get in. The living room where we slept is big with lots of space for 3 of us. Alexa left us fresh towels and made us an air mattress. She also gave us some tips for where to eat/drink. We had privacy even though it was her living room. I'd recommend it for sure!"
7219838,42642008,2015-08-14,22886163,Lucy,"Alexa was really easy to coordinate with and made it easy for me to arrive on my own schedule. Her place was a quick cab ride or bus ride from the downtown area. She wasn't home when I arrived, but left a note with where everything is. She was very welcoming but gave me ample privacy, even though i was staying in the living room. Overall my stay was very comfortable."
7219838,42770624,2015-08-15,40537207,Everett,"It's a night in her living room, nothing fancy, and is just right for us as traveling students.  The host seems to be busy the day we stayed so there wasn't much interaction between us.  The bathroom is a bit messy but the living room, kitchen and dinning room are clean.  Overall it's a pleasant experience."
7219838,43468600,2015-08-19,7443798,Jennifer,"Alexa was very accommodating and communicative. The place is exactly as pictured. I loved the air mattress and the great Washington air filtering through the ajar sliding glass door. Older building but looks to be tons of younger, educated recent college grad types. Felt safe and did the trick. Thank you Alexa for hosting us. "
7219838,43563611,2015-08-20,40810925,Kirbie,"Very clean and tidy, close to downtown Seattle which was great! 
Alexa was very kind and allowed us to come and go as we pleased. 
Prefect for a one night stay, thank you! "
7219838,44080409,2015-08-23,31293590,Khaled,"I stayed at Alexa's living room for one night. It was comfortable and I had everything I needed. Alexa is a nice host, we didn't get the chance to talk much, but her home is comfortable, and the instructions she gave to access her home were clear and convenient."
7219838,44845867,2015-08-29,3276682,Eva,Alexa picked us up from The train station which was lovely. The apartment is a bit outside of downtown but there is a direct bus just outside the house. The air mattress was quite comfortable but the apartment could have been cleaner. 
7219838,45296306,2015-09-01,37642629,Kamal,"I stayed for two nights at alexa's apartment and it couldn't have been better. She made me feel welcomed and already had the air mattress  out and a clean towel out for me when I arrived, she even had the Wifi password ready for me. She gave me specific instructions on how to get into her house when she was not home which made things much easier. Alexa herself suggested a couple of areas I could go for some food, and even gave me a ride over to where they were. Overall for the two days that I stayed, this could not have been much better."
7219838,45730691,2015-09-05,41919689,Alex,"The listing was just as described, and Alexa was very accommodating for me and my two friends with me. Neighborhood was good, and solid location for getting to downtown Seattle. Thank you Alexa!"
7219838,47290458,2015-09-17,3547821,Joanna,"Alexa was very responsive and communicative. My friends and I did a Pacific Northwest trip (Portland --> Seattle --> Vancouver) from LA. Her apartment was very lovely and comfortable. She was also dogsitting and he was the sweetest pup ever :)

I absolutely loved the neighborhood. I just had to go for a morning run! We took a lyft to Pike street, which took less than 10 mins. Got off at Pike and Boren, and walked to the Pike Market. About 15-20 min walk!"
7219838,48475373,2015-09-26,10515115,Maril,We had à great stay. Good location but the appartement could have been à bit cleaner. Alexa was à great host thouhg! 
7219838,50155094,2015-10-09,18397991,Johnny,"Great  Stay! We booked the room last minute, and Alexa had the place ready (super Clean)  with all the accommodations we could need. She was friendly and gave us advice for things to do. Highly recommend her :)"
7219838,52201200,2015-10-26,47327550,Desireé,Alexa was very flexible with time and let us stay with less than 12 hrs notice. She provided bedding and some toiletries. It was a great first experience with AirBNB!
7219838,53426854,2015-11-08,23083512,Christian,Everything was great. Alexa was very helpful.
7219838,53868486,2015-11-13,48719768,Kieran,"Alexa was very kind and accommodating with my late inquiry about the room. I requested to book the room the day I needed it, and she was able to let us stay on such a short notice. The place is clean and organized and it feels very comfortable. Alexa does a good job of making the place feel cozy. 
Alexa was very kind and helpful and was able to give us a couple tips, as it was our first trip to Seattle in quite some time. 
Even though we didn't spend much time at the apartment, I enjoyed the time that we did and I would definitely stay here again!"
7219838,54833188,2015-11-23,49554341,Andrew,"Alexa was a great host! She took me in last minute  and was super laid back. Her place was clean, bed was comfy and her dog was great. She let me use the shower and even provided me a towel and soap/shampoo. I would definitely recommend her and would stay there again! "
7219838,55733443,2015-12-05,44602830,Thomas,"Alexa was a friendly, responsive host. The apt was comfortable and in a good location. Enjoyed my stay and would recommend."
7219838,56699374,2015-12-16,45477270,Brett,"Alexa was a great host! She had everything ready to go when I arrived and her pup gave the sweetest little welcoming. I felt extremely comfortable staying there the few days I did.

5319948,27080008,2015-02-24,8755193,Gary,Devin is an awesome guy and communication was a pleasure. His place is on a quiet street and the inside is beautifully decorated and clean. There is a nice patio in the backyard complete with a grill. Devin went out of his way to ensure that our stay was comfortable and enjoyable. We did not get the chance to meet him but he seems like a super interesting guy and we would definitely stay here again. 
5319948,27298902,2015-03-01,27218006,Will,"Devin was a great host. Despite never meeting him in person, I found him to be very welcoming and genuinely interested in helping us feel comfortable in his house. He was very responsive and was willing to work with me and remain flexible in terms of scheduling, despite the deadlines that AirBnB had set. His house was super clean and it was a really easy place to settle in to. "
5319948,27420447,2015-03-03,27753349,Mason,"We stayed at Devin's place for two nights and had the place to ourselves.  It was cozy and clean, and Devin was a welcoming and accomadating host despite being out of town at the time of our stay.  He reached out several times to make sure we felt at home.  Access to the washer and dryer was a plus.  Overall a great stay."
5319948,27782192,2015-03-11,1192364,Muriel,"Hello, 
I stayed at Devin's house for 6 nights as I was looking for a new place to leave in Seattle. His house is super cute, super clean and comfortable. I stayed in the bedroom on the main floor witch is in the back so it's very quiet, the bed is great and you'll have your own bathroom with a bathtub!  Devin's was very welcoming, he called or text me many times to make sure that I was enjoying my stay. So even if he's not at the house you can always contact him, he will respond right away.
I will definitely stay at devin's house again."
5319948,28431337,2015-03-23,28593178,Ky,"I highly recommend Devin's home to anyone interested in spending some time in Seattle. My girlfriend and I visited Seattle for 3 days and we needed an affordable place to stay. After requesting a booking, Devin promptly replied and gave us all the information we needed to start planning our trip. Although he isn't in town, he makes sure he is readily available if you need him. The house was absolutely beautiful. It was neat and tidy with a lot of cool decor and art. We really enjoyed the sunroom and spacious backyard. There were some people staying in the basement but Devin informed us beforehand and we did not mind. There are lot of markets and really good cafes within walking distance. The house is in north east Seattle I believe so it was less then a 10 min drive to get into the city. Overall we really enjoyed staying at Devin's home. If you are interested, just email Devin and you will see how great of a host he is."
5319948,28822060,2015-03-30,29169312,Patrick,"The best aspect of this place is the location you are close enough to the city to easily get down to the city, but far enough to not have to deal with all the headaches of staying in the city. The house was exactly as pictured and it was clean when we got there .Devin was a great host even though he wasn't there he answered our questions quickly anytime we texted him. We also had plenty of privacy from the other guest that was staying in house.This was a great place to stay for a incredible Seattle experience. "
5319948,30298690,2015-04-20,28451157,Yunzoo Amy,"I stayed at Devin's house over two week for my vacation in Seattle. It was absolutely lovely to stay in his house. Love interior, kitchen, back yard, location, and even his collection of art book! 
Everything was exactly what I expected from pictures. After couple of days of staying, the house made me feel like I'm in real home. Because this is not a hotel, I worried about bathroom ware and kitchen appliance as I was staying long term, but everything what I need was already there. So convenient place. Moreover, the high speed wifi service is just fantastic! As long as Devin's house is on Airbnb, I definitely want to back at his house to enjoying my vacation in Seattle.

2주 좀 넘게 이집에 머물렀는데, 프라이버시도 괜찮고, 교통도 편리하고, 근처 노스게이트라는 쇼핑몰도 걸어서 10분 거리입니다. 무엇보다 집 주인이 먼 거리에 있지만 언제든지 연락이 가능해서 머무는데 불편한 점 도 없었습니다. "
5319948,31902344,2015-05-11,25913186,Amanda,"Devin's place was great! My husband and I were in Seattle for a three-day visit, and we found that this room was perfect for our needs.  The room and house were comfortable both as a place to visit the area (convenient to the city) and a place to relax and unwind (when we'd visited enough!).  Devin and Kush were wonderful hosts with helpful ideas about places to eat and go.  We highly recommend this place!"
5319948,32251382,2015-05-16,17168875,Stephen,"I stayed for a week in Devin's house and everything was perfect! Devin and Kush are warm, friendly, and personable hosts. They regularly checked in with me to see if everything was going well and were always available to answer my questions. They recommended local stores, restaurants, and other places for me. The place is in a quiet, relaxing neighborhood with ample parking and a short walk to the bus stops. The house is clean and the room/bed are comfortable. Access to the kitchen, living room, studio area, private bathroom, and backyard made me feel cozy and at home. "
5319948,32542470,2015-05-19,25420644,Emily,"Devin sent a really thorough welcome message that answered any and all questions we had. The house was lovely. The backyard was super nice. We liked how funky the decor was, and how kind Kush and Devin were."
5319948,36769209,2015-07-01,30492330,Pablo,"We've stayed at Devin's place for over a month while looking for an apartment in Seattle. Felt at home immediately, and having to leave hurt a bit. The house has everything you need, is cosy, clean and big! Having an awesome computer there to use was a big help for us! Most of all we'll miss the garden. We were spoiled by the weather this month and spent a good deal out there. Just lovely. Also the location is super: far enough from the city to be superquiet at night, yet so close at the same time. Hop on the bus on the corner of the street, hop of downtown! 

Before we arrived, we received a long welcome mail where every question we could've had was answered.
Kush was a super host and made sure everything was there for us and had tips and tricks ready to help us get around the city. Kush, you're a great guy, thanks for everything! 
Based on the couple of times we briefly met and the evidence all around the house, Devin is an awesome guy with a heart of gold. I could spent hours listening to him, I'm sure he's got quite some stories to tell! Even when he wasn't around, we knew he was available by phone 24/7, but we never needed to ask anything. 
Thanks guys!

As per them:
Julie was welcoming and accommodating. She encouraged us to make ourselves comfortable, use the living room and kitchen areas, and all common area. The neighborhood was safe, and parking on the street was very easy and quite safe.

Julie was very helpful during the entire stay. She always asked if we need anything else. She was easy to communicate with prior to travel and during the stay. The accommodation was very pleasant, spacious, cozy, comfortable, gorgeous, nice homey feel, comfortable beds. The neighborhood was nice and easily accessible to restaurants, downtown etc.

The description of this venue is accurate. It is smartly designed and very artful. I highly recommend this airbnb.

Thank you, Raman."
6558980,44301205,2015-08-25,36501494,Yusuke,"The best thing I experienced is Julie. She is very friendly, always asks about my convemience and provides anything what I want which measns not only any amenitys but also any information for living there. Her sincer hospitality didn't make me, from Tokyo, feel isolated. Our conversation, even thoug we couldn't have so much time together because of the differece of our work and living hours, is very interesting sharing our life stayle, culture and other topics each other. She is a lady of great capacity. The location is perfect as the resident and access to anywhere. It's very convenient for me that the bus stop is very close. The unit is very new, beautiful and clean so that I feel confortable and can be relaxed. I can use the living room, bed room and bath room for my own and also it's very convenient to use the kitchen, refrige and landry. The skyview from the roof top is awesome. Anyway, almost 40 days stay there has passed so fast. I would like to stay there if I coould have another chance to ome to Seattle. I highly recommend to stay the unit with Julie's great hospitality. 

約４０日間の”ホームステイ”でした。何より　ジュリーさんの付かず離れずのホスピタリティはとても心地いいものでした。建物は新しく、専用のリビング、ベッドルームにバスルームに加え、キッチン、冷蔵庫、洗濯機、乾燥機も使えましたので、何の不自由もありません。WiFiももちろん使えます。アメニティも補充してくれます。ロケーションもダウンタウン、パイクプレイスも徒歩圏ですし、バス停も近いので便利です。スーパーや飲食店も周りにたくさんあるにもかかわらず、辺りは住宅地で静かです。 何か判らないことがあったらすぐ尋ねられ、ホテルのように孤立感が無く、シアトルの人と知り合いになれるというのは最大の魅力では無いでしょうか。またシアトルに滞在する機会があれば、是非お願いしたいと思っています。"
6558980,47975648,2015-09-22,8897973,Raman,"I arranged the accommodation for one of my visitor. Her comments are as follows:

Julie was very welcoming host. She gave lots of helpful hints about transport, food and local points of interest.
The apartment is in a quiet neighborhood with nice restaurants nearby. The place was clean and well equipped with even small utilities like wi-fi, iron, hair dryer though there was no wooden flooring in bedroom area (basement). The kitchen, at the top floor was well stocked with vital amenities and Julie's friendly nature made the stay very accommodative.

Cons:
There are couple of issues though trivial like kitchen at third floor seems a little uneasy to reach from basement which is the bedroom area.
No locking options in lobby/basement for valuable items.
 "
6558980,51447530,2015-10-20,42853591,Krista,"Julie is a fantastic host. She greeted me warmly and answered all of my questions as I had them. What stands out for me is that she offered to get anything I needed for the mother-in-law unit (an extra trashcan, a microwave, blankets, etc.). She made sure that I was comfortable and felt welcomed. 

Something to be aware of is that the pictures are of a stock townhome from this complex but the place is nearly identical. As mentioned in previous reviews, there is no carpet in the bedroom. However, the bedroom and living room above it have its own separate climate control. Because of that, part of the floor is heated! 

Julie's home is clean with minimal decorations and a modern feel. The neighborhood is quiet and safe; it is within walking distance to bus stops and downtown. There's also lots of coffee shops, restaurants, and bars a few blocks away. It's a great, secure location. For nights in, the WiFi is incredibly fast and the bed is soft and very comfortable. The view from the roof is to die for. 

While Julie was often busy with work and her personal life, it was always a pleasure to speak with her at the end of the day. This is a great place and I highly recommend renting from her! "
6958436,41116044,2015-08-04,378293,Camilo,"It was a lovely experience. I kinda wish I could've stayed longer. The area was full of great restaurants and within walking distance to everything. The place had a great airy vibe. The hosts were organized, affable and accommodating. "
6958436,51857699,2015-10-24,3830116,Giovanni,"Cool position, pretty apt, terrific host! "
931758,8715407,2013-11-13,3200540,Claudia Catherine,"Appartment exactly as described. Accessible host, answer all the questions quickly. Check-in and check-out fast and easy. | Apartamento exatamente como descrito no anúncio. Anfitrião acessível, respondeu todas as perguntas rapidamente. Check-in e check-out rápidos e fáceis."
931758,11485043,2014-04-05,11931586,Dan,"The apartment was excellent, exactly as it looked in the pictures. This building is located in the perfect part of town if you want to walk to Pike's Place Market, the Space Needle, the water front, excellent restaurants, shopping...pretty much anywhere. The amenities are very nice, and everyone in the building was friendly and helpful. Check in/out was a breeze. 

We flew in and took the light rail train from SeaTac airport to the last stop, which was about three blocks from the apartment building (for $2.75, about a 45 minute trip). It could not have been easier. We had a great time!"
931758,11909522,2014-04-18,5338780,Hector,Great Location!  Excellent service and directions.  Felt at home with the stellar hospitality!
931758,13214403,2014-05-22,2108625,Cat,"This apartment was great! Very close to the convention center, lots of amenities. The location seriously couldn't have been more perfect. There's a UPS right across the street, shopping center and movies within 2 blocks. Very easy to get a cab, and pretty close to all the touristy stuff without being too close for comfort. The apartment itself was very comfortable, great beds, two balconies. I stayed here with a couple other grad students and it was exactly what we needed. Thanks!!!! I would definitely stay here again. "
931758,13465414,2014-05-28,5443997,Jasper,"The apartment was very nice and luxurious. It had everything we needed, is very nicely located in the city centre and within walking distance from Pike Place Market. We had access to an indoor pool, gym, lounge and roof top terrace which was great. We used a handy app with necessary information about the apartment and building. We stayed there with six; that was OK but two people slept less comfortably in the living room. There was no sofa that could be used as bed; there were simple foldaway beds instead. Except for that we had a great stay!"
931758,16810953,2014-08-02,19021691,Taylor,The place was amazing a nice view of the space needle and close to restaurants. I would recommend this to my friends. 
931758,16992561,2014-08-05,17264097,Russ,"Everything was as advertised.  The concierge was expecting us and had our package ready to go.  The accommodation was exactly as described and the location was probably better than we were expecting.  We did not have any interaction with Jordan, beyond the initial reservation phase, but only because there was nothing to discuss.  All in all a very good experience and we will use both airbnb and Jordan again."
931758,17511105,2014-08-13,16535460,Michael,"Jordan was great through the whole process of renting his Air bnb apartment.  This was my first time using Air bnb so I was a little nervous at first , but working with Jordan alleviated any of the concerns I initially had.  He was very open and responsive with any of the questions that I had about checking in/out , the unit itself, and the surrounding area.  We were traveling with our small niece, and Jordan was very helpful to ensure she would have proper accommodations in the unit.

The unit we stayed in Seattle were just as the pictures showed, clean and ready for us when we arrived.  Checking in/out was very easy with all of the information Jordan provided prior to our trip.

I would definitely recommend working with Jordan, and this unit."
931758,18875791,2014-09-02,1011518,Ryan,"The apartment was excellent inside, and Jordan did a great job making it easy and friendly.  Very responsive to questions and making sure special requests were perfectly satisfied.  And, of course, the location is excellent."
931758,20362773,2014-09-28,20814590,Megan,Condo was great. Great location and easy check-in and check-out. 
931758,21103987,2014-10-11,6771536,Matthew,Great apartment and very central location (just as advertised). Beautiful large space that comfortably slept six. Jordan was helpful and provided us with instructions for parking and checking in. The concierge was extremely friendly and welcoming. Would definitely come back to this spot.  
931758,24576622,2014-12-30,24601911,Jenny,This was a last minute booking for a quick overnight trip to Seattle during the Holidays.  The overall process was easy and the unit lived up to it's description.  The photos should probably be updated only because the Space Needle is no longer visible from the property due to Amazon building a new building adjacent to the building.  Everything else was as described.  Thanks for a great stay! 
931758,29813071,2015-04-13,3033492,Amber,"Very comfortable apartment, just as advertised, even for 5 people. Ideal downtown location, near to everything you may need in walking distance. By following the instructions on the app it was very easy to check in, and when questions arose response time was fast. If you plan to arrive early or leave in the afternoon, there is no place to store your luggage so I would advise asking for an early check-in or late check-out during your booking."
931758,31112921,2015-05-02,19850928,Son,We had a great time staying in the apartment.  Both the check-in and check-out process was very streamlined and straight forward.  The apartment itself was in a great location and was very clean.  I would definitely consider staying here again when I am in Seattle.
931758,31589333,2015-05-07,30655169,Bethany,"The apartment we rented was just like the listing said, very comfortable, close to a lot of amenities and right downtown. the neighborhood is fairly upscale, if that's what you want. security in the building is good and parking was easy, but getting to the garage takes some getting used to as it is on a one way street. pike place is very close, as is shopping and eating opportunities. overall, it was a pleasant and easy experience.  Jordan communicated well and gave me all the info I needed for the stay."
931758,32751746,2015-05-21,7873614,Christine,"Jordan & Stay Alfred provided thorough, detailed instructions as to how to find the location and how to check in. Normally, I assume that photos on Airbnb make a place look better than it actually is, but the room, pool area, and deck were exactly as pictured in the listing. I was very pleasantly surprised. With the kitchen and washer / dryer, as well as free amenities like shampoo / conditioner / lotion, this setup gave us more bang for our buck than if we had stayed in a hotel. The location was wonderfully close (easy walking distance) of the waterfront, Pike Place, the Seattle Center, and Pioneer Square. We had a great time."
931758,33670409,2015-05-31,13413359,Hannah,Was just as expected. Had a great time 
931758,34018901,2015-06-03,33601915,Marti,Our host made us feel very welcome!  The instructions for the apartment were very clear and easy to follow.  The neighborhood was perfect.
931758,34422343,2015-06-08,30812969,P.T.,"Highly recommended! This apartment is in the perfect location for visiting Seattle and is clean and comfortable, the service we received was top notch and the facilities are wonderful. We had a great stay!"
931758,41740131,2015-08-09,19589730,Dane,"Thank you very much for the room. It was exactly what we needed. I It was exactly as described. Very clean, with a good location. They were also very responsive when I had questions. "
931758,43443651,2015-08-19,11046870,Joanie,"The location was superb. The building staff were very friendly and helpful. The parking, building access and check in were all as advertised and easy. These are my pros. My cons:  the ""city views"" were mostly obstructed by a newly built high rise. Which was still under construction - the noise of said construction  (primarily back-up beepers of scissor lift and forklifts) woke us up both mornings at 6:30 am.  The unit was not the one pictured.  This 2 bedroom 2 bath was much smaller and had a lot of cosmetic issues:  stains on carpet,  gouges in drywall, broken handle on pocket door in master bath, broken drawer in kitchen, 2 of the three lights on fixture in 2nd bath were missing and there were stains on ceiling over dining table, TV console was scratched and damaged and the little matt th tv sat on was frayed and looked ugly. All the mini blinds in unit were bent up on the edges and looked ugly.  Probably the most bothersome was the pervasive smell of old cigarette smoke which may have been coming from next door neighbor - the smell was strongest when you opened undersink cabinets in master bath. But after a day out and about the first thing you smell when opening the front door was old nasty cigarettes. I feel this unit was over-priced due to the  cons I listed.  I also feel that almost all of these cons could be easily and cheaply fixed if the owner cared about making sure he was offering quality lodging at a premium price."

931758,52292145,2015-10-27,47060848,Rachelle,"Thank you! My family had so much fun! We stayed there Oct 23-27. We are a family of five plus a small yorkie. Though we don't have the space needle view, the city view specially at night certainly makes up for it! The view is beautiful! I love how accessible our hotel is to everything! I also love the fact that we are just a floor up from the amenities. The kids had so much fun with their night swimming. Across it is a mini area to take the dogs to do their business. Aside from the perfect room location the 2 br room that we got is so clean. It has everything that we need and it feels like we never left home. Jordan is very helpful too! Their team really did great. I also appreciate that they allowed us an early check in w/o any cost. Our family will definitely come back again!"
931758,57459293,2015-12-26,29602367,Esther,"This unit is akin to longterm corporate housing.  The condo unit is clean and neat, but pedestrian.  The kitchen has pots and pans, dishes and utensils, but it lacks cooking oil and any spices (other than salt and pepper).  The knives are dull and need to be sharpened (making them dangerous).  The unit is also managed by Stay Alfred, which describes itself as a corporate manager.  Nothing wrong with the unit, but it was not what we expected.  Normally, our Airbnb stays have been second homes or run by families.  The location is excellent and in the heart of downtown Seattle.  Walking distance to the Pike Marketplace, Whole Foods and clothes shopping.  The location is also across the street from the USDC, which would make for an excellent war room for litigators and lengthy trials.

The reception and unit is ""cold"" and uninviting.  For example, shampoos and conditioners are in little bottles like in a hotel.  This place is strictly business.  Again, nothing wrong with the place, just different from our expectations."
1742425,8701707,2013-11-12,1340034,Tiffany,"What a beautiful home located just off the freeway within walking distance to UW, the Burke Gilman Trail, and everything I needed for my visit to my daughter in school. Christine even welcomed me with bagels (which my daughter loved!) and OJ. Loved the luxurious soaking tub and the kitchen had everything you need to cook a gourmet meal. I think I found my go-to lodging in Seattle!"
1742425,9485643,2013-12-30,869514,Harvey,"A lovely private residence, well designed w careful attention to details, in a quaint neighborhood near UVillage Shopping, what more does one need!
On a recent last minute visit to Seattle we were delighted to find this little gem. With its upstairs open loft bedroom & morning skylights, this cute bungalow is perfect for singles or a couple; though our daughter slept upstairs with us/ the steeper stairs would not be appropriate for small children.
The beautiful white marble bathroom w deep soaker tub will be enjoyed by anyone not rushing to shower. As for the kitchen, how can you tell the owners love to cook..this layout is top notch! Though we didn't cook, the owners kindly allowed us to use this exquisitely designed space, including Americano's from the delux built-in. 
Would we recommend staying here, yes!  Picture a friend or associate allowing you to use their place while out of town....double yeh! 
Thank you Christine."
1742425,9905521,2014-01-18,6813430,Yamila,"I don't know where to start! Christine's place is more than I expected. It is beautiful designed home in a lovely neighborhood. The place was such a great escape. Everything was spotless clean. Christine was such a nice host, leaving some food and drinks for me. The house has an amazing coffee maker, an adorable bathtub,  high speed internet, great tv, heated floors...and so much more! Im so happy I choose this place and I will come back next time im in town!"
1742425,10167108,2014-02-03,11702042,Shane,"A really great space! 
Used pretty sparingly as I was there for work but it had all the luxuries of home...a well appointed home, not necessarily mine :-). 
Had a couple good soaks in the tub and loved the heated floors and built in coffee maker in the mornings.  Great space to relax and a short bike ride down to University Village for food, supplies and shopping. Right near the Burke Gilman trail made the commute to my work sessions easy.
Great spot and Christine was flexible when my train was late getting in. Easy in and out.
A good intro for my first airbnb."
1742425,10305283,2014-02-11,4076370,Sri,"Loved staying at Christine's place! Very clean, quiet, comfortable and easily accessible to various highways and neighborhoods.  Highly recommend! "
1742425,10393123,2014-02-17,2750389,Jessica,"The most exceptional place! Amazing location, super homey. Couldn't recommend enough."
1742425,10505893,2014-02-22,2170246,Tamsen,Great location.  Fabulous kitchen with every acoutrement you can imagine.  Beautifully appointed bathroom.  Charming design overall.  Christine was charming and helpful and very easy to communicate with.  It was a pleasure to stay at Christine's bungalow!  
1742425,10926587,2014-03-13,11636305,Michael,"Christine's private little house is in one of our favorite Seattle neighborhoods. Great walking, good bus connections, convenient to shopping and University of Washington activities.  We had everything we needed and particularly enjoyed the high end kitchen complete with Italian cabinetry, marble counter tops, heated tile  floor and a number of ""exotic"" (to us) appliances.  We also appreciated that Christine recycles and composts.  A cherry tree in the back yard had just started blooming in her inviting, private backyard. Although we didn't spend time in the yard we enjoyed seeing it from the little nook off of the kitchen while we drank our morning coffee. 
Some of the design features of the house were a bit awkward for us.  We are  spry seniors but were not completely at ease, especially at night, using the stairs to the upstairs bedroom, which are steep and have no railing. A deep soak tub was the only bathing alternative.  Getting in and out was awkward. The bathroom sink had no plug available for shaving or washing and we missed hooks and towel racks. The bed was very comfortable but the bedroom itself was awkward to move around in because of the low, steeply slanted roof on each side of the bed.  The many skylights are visually delightful, but the shade cords dangled in the minimal walking space next to the bed and the shades did not block light efficiently.  If you need darkness to sleep well, we suggest you bring eye masks.  

For the several days we were there, it was a treat to try out new things and experience living in a more artistically sophisticated house than we are used to. Christine was very responsive, helpful and easy to work with. Although we would not recommend the house for seniors or children, we might choose to stay there again and would encourage anyone interested in spending time in that area of Seattle to consider Christine's place. "
1742425,11103674,2014-03-20,2750389,Jessica,"Have stayed at Christine's place now 3 times, I believe. She is so great, the place is gorgeous and it's extremely comfortable. It's the best."
1742425,11775103,2014-04-14,13646102,Ellen,"Just came back from a wonderful stay here.  Christine was there to greet us and was a phone call away after that, though everything went so well we did not need to call her.   Her home is in a lovely neighborhood close to UW which my daughter was there to check out.  Close to everything and a lovely oasis to come home to.   Very well equipped kitchen so we enjoyed a lot of relaxing meals 'at home' after a day of sightseeing.  Highly recommend the city bungalow, you won't be disappointed."
1742425,12616473,2014-05-06,568675,Melanie,"The City Bungalow is in an ideal location, near the U.W. as well as a large shopping area and the Burke Gilman trail, with easy walking to these locations.  Christine met me upon my arrival and took me on a tour of her home.  Everything one could possibly need was there and I was given access to the entire kitchen including condiments for cooking.  The home is well appointed, especially the kitchen and bath, with updated appliances, counter tops and fresh paint throughout.  Christine put me at ease immediately and was easily accessible via phone had I needed her for anything.  The attic bedroom with it's slanted ceiling required being careful if you are tall but was roomy and well lit with several wonderful skylight windows.  At 72 I was a bit worried initially about climbing the stairs to the attic as they are quite steep with no hand rail, however it was easy to navigate with several ledges to hold onto so I had no problem and feel that if I can manage, then so will most others.  I highly recommend Christine as a generous and friendly hostess, as well as the City Bungalow for a convenient place to call home, when away from home.  When I return to Seattle again I would enjoy staying at Christines!"
1742425,13422199,2014-05-27,3240723,Mark,Great home. Great host.  Great location.  Would gladly do this again.  
1742425,14731931,2014-06-25,12052623,John,"Christine is a generous host and has a comfortable home, on a quiet residential street.  Two blocks to the Burke-Gilman Trail, walking distance to the U Village, Met Market, and public transportation.  Her home was very clean and well appointed.  One caution:  several steps to get up to the house and more steps to get to the second floor bedroom.  Other than that, I would highly recommend this home as the place to stay if you are wanting to be near UW or Children's Hospital. "
1742425,15135009,2014-07-03,8735559,Dawn, Christine was a welcoming host.  She was generous in showing us her kitchen and indicating which items we were permitted to use.  She worked with us when our arrival time became many hours later than we had anticipated.  Her home is clean and well decorated.  The kitchen and bathroom are gorgeous.  My husband especially appreciated watching the World Cup on the large screen tv.  The house was in a great location for us.  While visiting friends in the U District we were able to walk to their home. 
1742425,15697799,2014-07-14,16666099,Aimee,"We had an absolutely delightful stay in Christine's home.  Her house is clean, cozy and has an amazing kitchen to cook in.  The neighborhood is very beautiful and within walking distance to fantastic grocery stores, shopping, and restaurants.  Christine is so friendly and gave us lots of recommendations for fun weekend activities, trails to hike, and places to eat.  I would definitely recommend staying at her house.  Its such a beautiful cozy bungalow in a beautiful neighborhood.  I will absolutely stay here again when I return to Seattle! "
1742425,15857228,2014-07-17,2192558,Amanda,"Christine's listing was very accurate and the neighborhood was wonderful.  Far enough from Downtown to be quiet and peaceful, but close enough to be able to get there in just a few minutes, by car.  Christine was very helpful in getting us settled.  The neighborhood's electricity was out when we arrived and it was in the middle of a rare Seattle heat wave, so it was a bit hot in the house, but Christine provided fans and the bedroom was able to be cooled well by the AC unit up there.  We would definitely stay in the bungalow again if we were visiting Seattle!"
1742425,16209399,2014-07-23,16496092,Vanessa,"My husband and I had a great time staying in Christine’s lovely bungalow. She was very helpful and gave us a welcoming tour of the place when we arrived. Though the weather was hot on our first day, she provided fans and opened the windows for us to cool it down. There’s also an AC unit in the upstairs bedroom area. The bathroom was nicely remodeled and luxurious. The deep soak tub was nice for a relaxing bath but a little hard to get into if you are petite like me. It’s not ideal if you like to take showers but it’s manageable. Not only was her kitchen gorgeous and well-appointed, she was thoughtful enough to leave us some bagels and other accompaniments to eat during our stay. We enjoyed eating at the large dining table. The kitchen nook is also a nice place to sit while savoring a nice cup of joe from her fancy built-in coffee maker. The steps to the bedroom in the attic were a bit steep but there was ample room and the bed was comfy enough. Just watch your head as the ceiling is slanted on both sides. There’s a flat screen TV in the living room for entertainment which was nice to help me unwind after a tiring day of exploring. The location is fantastic because it’s not too far from downtown and it’s within walking distance to the University Village where there are tons of shopping and good food. Grocery stores are also nearby. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. There is ample parking if you have a car. All in all, I would recommend staying here for its great location and splendid accommodations!"
1742425,16458062,2014-07-28,10267834,Martin,"Everything was as described. Christine was very welcoming and helpful when needed. Upon arrival she was there to show the whole place. The home itself is very welcoming, perfect for a couple. The bedroom head space takes a little getting used to, but nonetheless was good.  "
1742425,17090368,2014-08-07,13904750,James,Christine and her house were perfect for us. She was available to meet us right when we arrived in town and gave us a thorough and quick review of the house. Location was ideal for our UW med center appointments and runs on the Burke Gilman. The house was very comfortable and the kitchen so fun to cook in. Thanks Christine for the best place we've found to stay for our annual appointments. 
1742425,17446578,2014-08-12,17236148,Timothy,"The experience staying at Christine's bungalow was great. The price and location were right for the wedding reception I was attending in NE Seattle. Rates for hotels during the high-season in Seattle were approaching NYC levels. This proved to be a great alternative. The house is located walking distance to great shopping and restaurants near the University of Washington. The Burke-Gilman trail that goes around Lake Washington is just a block away, which was wonderful for running options.

She met me at my arrival and check-in was a breeze. The house has a great kitchen so you have the option to cook your meals- and Christine generously offers any of the spices/food in the fridge for your use. There is also a washer and dryer available. There is an A/C unit in the upstairs loft-style bedroom, which not all Seattle homes have. 

The only negatives were the shower and the headroom in the bedroom. The shower really only works best as a bath, as other reviewers have mentioned. Also, the bedroom has slanted ceilings that you need to stoop down to walk through. Other than those two minor things, the bungalow is wonderful. 

"
1742425,18247368,2014-08-24,17725465,Edward,"We can't thank Christine enough for allowing us to stay at her place in Seattle. Her kind personality was a big factor in selecting where to stay for our vacation. She responds and provides answers to our inquiries in a timely manner. The place itself is located in a quiet neighbourhood and is also very close to the university shopping market. Arriving at the house, Christine greeted us and showed us around the house before taking time to bring us up to speed with the area (and what to do!). She also  brought out a couple fans that helped ventilate the attic bedroom which was very thoughtful. The pull out sofa bed was a bit dated so we didn't use it. The soaker tub lived up to its name but was a bit tedious to use the shower head (water would be all around the ledges which we had to wipe). The living room was nice and cool; with the giant tv with hd channels, it was a great addition to end our night. The furniture fixtures and kitchen kept a modern and inviting vibe in the house. We were sad to have to leave at the end of our vacation... Thank you Christine!"
1742425,18532545,2014-08-28,3676526,Joan,"Our stay was great. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance and the kitchen at the apartment is fabulous. We were in town for a conference at UW and walked there every day. Christine was very responsive throughout our stay and made check-in and out easy. The shower is a bit crazy (you have to sit down), but once you get used to it, it's no problem. "
1742425,18885238,2014-09-02,1723609,Khanh,"Easy check-in and check-out. Christine was very thorough showing us each room and how to work appliances, etc. We did not do any cooking, but kitchen is fully stocked with cookware and everything you need. The bathtub is wonderful for soaking. We didn't have problems showering, but water does get everywhere if you stand. Tub is very high so was hard to climb into if you're short, but manageable.  Attic bedroom was a bit musky. We had to open the windows to have better airflow. Ceiling was low so we had to watch our heads in the bedroom area. Convenient location, close to shops. We had a car and got to downtown very quickly. Overall a pleasant stay and very affordable. "
1742425,19226291,2014-09-08,11273255,Chad,"Was a great little house to stay in. Well kept and clean. Walking distance to the Huskies stadium, a nice mall, and grocery stores. A great stay in Seattle. Would stay here again."
1742425,19877812,2014-09-20,18888263,Janakiram,It is a good experience staying at the place. Host is quite welcoming and nice. We enjoyed staying here.
1742425,20159478,2014-09-24,17219077,Ekambaram,Thank you for your warm welcome and providing the accommodation.
1742425,20499433,2014-09-30,4201602,Julia,"Christine was welcoming and very open about letting us use the kitchen -- having an espresso machine and fresh half and half was a huge perk! Cute house in a convenient location -- right next to the Burke Gilman, and to family whom we were visiting. 
A few caveats: The bathtub is hard to get in and out of (even for physically able people) because it is high. The attic bedroom, while charming, was a bit stuffy, and would not be great for people taller than we were (I am 5'7"" and my husband is 5""8""). "
1742425,21263682,2014-10-13,4580133,Matthew,"Christine was very communicable via text and email, with prompt response times. She made the check in very easy for my late arrival. The house was immaculate and very modern, especially the kitchen and restroom. 

The description is just a tip of the iceberg, once you get there, you're in for quite a treat! The soaking bathtub is AMAZING. The fixtures are are new and the layout is great for 2-4 people. I stayed by myself, and loved the amount of room based on the cost per night.

The neighborhood is so quiet and serene, that it's nearly tranquilizing. The yard is nice in the back, and the overall zen of the house is very relaxing."
1742425,22569514,2014-11-09,962245,Jerry,"This was my second stay at Christine's place... its in a perfect quiet neighborhood and a lot of amenities either a short drive or walk away. She has made a very beautiful space and makes you feel at home when she welcomes you. The kitchen is amazing by the way, I wish I knew how to cook more to really use it. I normally dont like to spend a lot of time in the bathroom, but the soaking tub was something I got used to, just have to slow down at times in life. Internet gave me a bit of issues at times, its still high speed but can either go in or out or maybe just dropped. I'm a heavy user as I work online so most wouldn't notice probably. I would highly recommend staying here, beautiful space at a great value."
1742425,23922887,2014-12-14,24494661,Annie,"Our host showed us how to use the kitchen appliances - the expresso machine was not so easy - and told us we were free to use all the ingredients stored in the fridge and in the closets. It was very generous. We felt very welcome. The house was warm and the TV was great. The night was quiet. We slept well. We liked the privacy. It felt like home. When our children came to visit we used the big table and the oven.
There was always place to park almost in front of the house. We walked several time to the University Village, along the trail.

"
1742425,26505753,2015-02-14,2750389,Jessica,"Christine is absolutely the best host I have encountered! Sweet, friendly, prompt in her communication, just the absolute best. Her house is a STEAL for the price and is lovely and clean and perfectly located. I have stayed here several times and it is, hands down, the very best airbnb experience!"
1742425,28268600,2015-03-21,11937431,Roger,"I had a nice time at the house.  It was very cute with living, dining, kitchen, and bathroom on the first floor and an upstairs bedroom.  A little strange to go downstairs to get ready for bed and for baths, but easy enough once you arranged yourself properly.  

The neighborhood was very nice - it was spring and all the streets were lined with cherry blossoms.   It took me about 20 min to walk to the UW Student union where my conference was.  A super-duper Miele coffee maker made my mornings easy (also heated floor in the kitchen for morning bare feet!).  Christine was very flexible, since I arrived later than expected.  She  left the key for me - but called me to give me house details.   

She has a tenant in the basement - I got to talk to her and pet her cat, altogether a very friendly and  enjoyable time."
1742425,28712984,2015-03-29,12290634,Elise,Excellent flexibility & comfortable house.

1742425,31379787,2015-05-04,17575268,Samantha,"Thanks so much to Christine for the quintessential Seattle bungalow experience! The house is beautifully decorated and it is in a wonderful, relaxing area of town.  I will definitely be back. "
1742425,32781543,2015-05-21,21490844,Jessica,"This was a very nice place to stay for a few days. Christine was attentive and communicative to all questions along the way, e.g., how to fill the espresso maker, etc. One thing to be aware of is that there is a downstairs tenant that accesses her space through the back sunroom, so she does have access to all of your space. Now I only saw her a couple of times, and she was very friendly. We were not at uncomfortable with that, but it's an FYI to future renters."
1742425,34555006,2015-06-09,1851755,Peter,"Christine was gracious and made sure we have no problems with the house rules and appliances.  Her kitchen was well stocked with cooking utensils, silverware, dinner ware, glass ware, coffee, and sundries.  Christine was responsive when we had a question.  Otherwise, she and her downstairs tenant let us be. The neighborhood is amazingly quiet for a big city like Seattle.  No one disturbed anyone else.  It was a really pleasant stay."
1742425,35910354,2015-06-23,25914123,Joyce,"The City Bungalow was perfect for our Seattle stay.  Everything was as described.  Christine showed us everything about the property to make our stay pleasant and invited us to use items in the pantry and the refrigerator.  While we didn't do any cooking there as we spent meal times at our daughter's house a few blocks away, the kitchen was amazing.  I did look forward every morning to a cup of coffee from her built-in Miele coffee/espresso maker.  The location was perfect in a quiet neighborhood.  We would not hesitate to stay here again.
"
1742425,36424777,2015-06-28,34403504,Anica,Our experience was great! Christine was very helpful and courteous and the place was perfect for us. I would definitely stay here again in the future.
1742425,37568276,2015-07-08,16720877,Judy,"This is a beautiful home in a quiet neighborhood.   Christine was wonderfully helpful in the details of our booking the home.  She also had some food available in the fridge when we arrived - a nice touch for a late arrival.  

My only caution for future visitors:  The stairs to the upstairs bedroom are steep, and the only bathroom is downstairs.  Also, the big tub is fairly high off the ground.  Wonderful once you are in it, but could be daunting to someone shorter than me, or someone not so agile.  "
1742425,38126217,2015-07-13,33399128,Jamie,"Christine was very easy to get in contact with and met us at the property for a quick tour and intro to the house. The property was in a nice, quiet neighborhood and was great for a couple of days. "
1742425,39758832,2015-07-26,2189423,Seraphina,"Nice place in good neighborhood 
Very near the university village. Responsive host . Recommend it for couples."
1742425,42627550,2015-08-14,10077697,Ryan,"This was a wonderful AirBnB experience. The high season in Seattle had prevented us from finding anything that would work well for a business event of mine. The location, price and beauty of Christine's small place were a life saver. She is extremely organized in how to utilize her house, which is really helpful. The neighborhood is excellent. Overall, an exceptional stay!"
1742425,44011433,2015-08-23,12032926,Immanuel,"The home is well-appointed, the kitchen in particular is very modern, and the location is very good, especially if you are visiting UW. Christine is a very responsive and flexible host and made the experience a good one. The ceiling height is as advertised, so anyone over 6 feet tall is probably better off sleeping on the sofa bed!"
1742425,45270969,2015-09-01,8903350,Griffin,"The home was very clean and well stocked. Christine was there to greet us, showed us around, and made us feel welcome. The neighborhood was very quiet for the five nights we were there, and although there was some construction at nearby houses, nothing kept us up or was too loud. The bed was fairly comfortable and there was an adequate supply of sheets, towels, soap, etc. The tub did not have a showerhead for our stay, but that was just a minor inconvenience."
1742425,50639102,2015-10-13,27684830,Yuxuan,Very nice experience.
1742425,56938520,2015-12-20,22496121,Xiaowen,"Christine's place is very spacious, clean, and also tastefully decorated. I'd like to mention a few things I personally enjoyed very much. The heating system is quiet. It keeps the bathroom warmer and the bedroom slightly cooler than the rest of the house, which feels very comfortable to me. Thumbs up to the coffee machine that makes delicious espresso.  I don't know about other people, but I also enjoyed the slightly unconventional bathtub. And the bed is super comfy! Just be careful with the low ceiling in the bedroom, and the narrow stairs leading up to the bedroom. (These are accurately described in the listing, so no complaint there.)"

This being our first stay through AirBnB, we were incredibly impressed and will have a hard time replicating the experience. The room comfortably slept the four in our group and the building had great amenities. The location was perfect, we walked from the airport light rail link station and to all of the major attractions. Definitely will be back. "
8100190,53068733,2015-11-04,572161,Jessica,"The StayAlfred arrangement was stellar - easy check-in and out, accommodating staff (on-site and via phone), clean space, beautiful view from the unit, snacks (!), great location for my conference, and very helpful concierge. Would stay here again in a heartbeat. Thanks much."
8100190,53369227,2015-11-08,5098496,Chloe,"We had a great stay in the apartment! It was very clean and modern, and located in a great part of town- very convenient to downtown and to Capitol Hill. I would definitely stay here again the next time I am in Seattle. "
8100190,54120828,2015-11-16,3392854,Darrene,"The condo was new, well-appointed, clean and comfortable. The common space--gym, top floor common room and roof deck were excellent. Great views and if it is not raining, this is a place to grill a meal or cook in the common large kitchen and enjoy. It's a great place and location.  Please note all of Jordan's listings are not a traditional AirBnB option. Our unit #1808 was one of several that Stay Alfred--Jordan's co-owned company--has in the Premiere on Pine. You are not assigned a unit until about a week from your stay. The confusing part is the Stay Alfred representatives on the phone; while very professional, I received contradicting responses about: 1) how to get an early check-in without a fee (even if I wait until the night before and unit isn't used, and not in need of cleaning); and 2) whether the building concierge (great ones during our stay) would be able to hold our luggage prior to check-in. All along I was told to call on these, but when I did, the Stay Alfred representative said this was never an option even though I had been told on 2 other occasions it may be but not know until closer to our stay.  Since Stay Alfred owns multiple condos in multiple building in Seattle, Jordan has a lot of listings, but the pictures will not necessarily match your unit, only a reflection of the units in the building at which your are browsing. You never speak with Jordan; just the representatives. I'd come back for sure, but not waste so much time with calling--as instructed--when it didn't matter."
8100190,55420947,2015-12-01,27077478,Erica,"Everything about this location and apartment surpassed our expectations! Perfectly nestled in the heart of the city and a short distance from Capital Hill! My family and I couldn't get over how much fun our stay in Seattle was :) 

Thanks, Jordan for the great hospitality and rapid responses to our few questions. If ever in Seattle, we will be sure to stay here again!

6847052,38437940,2015-07-15,37250910,Tom,It felt like home.  Chelsi and her partner are as open and welcoming as could be.  They went far out of their way to make me feel like part of their family.  The room was just as described.  The neighborhood is a wonderful cross section of West Seattle.
6847052,39093059,2015-07-20,8016562,Audrey,"Chelsi and Jeremy were great hosts!   Their home is lovely, they and the other guests were friendly and welcoming.   I enjoyed my stay and when I come back to Seattle, I will definitely be looking to stay here again.   Jeremy and Chelsi also made us all dinner, which was delicious, made sure I made it to my train and were very accommodating.  Thanks guys, I had a blast!   "
6847052,40800912,2015-08-02,10635764,Tanja,"Chelsi & Jeremy were fantastic hosts. The bed was heavenly comfortable, ambiance of home is peaceful, modern while also rustic. We thoroughly enjoyed our three nights and we would absolutely stay again and recommend to others. "
6847052,41836994,2015-08-09,24980752,James,"Chelsi and Jeremy were such wonderful hosts. It was my friend and I's first time in Seattle and they were such a perfect introduction to the city. They were warm, friendly, helpful and welcoming me and my friend to the city. The home was very comfortable, especially the beds. The neighborhood is really beautiful with convenient access to downtown and all the major tourist spots via the water taxi. I would definitely recommend this place for first timers to Seattle or to anyone who has been there and would like an amazing environment to call home for the time being. Thanks, Chelsi and Jeremy for all warm hositality :) I highly recommend this place to stay in Seattle. "
6847052,43598117,2015-08-20,22285755,William,"Great hosts!! Communication was fantastic. Made us feel at home. :) They were fun to socialize with. Bed was super comfy, they put out a great breakfast! Highly rated!! Thank you 7 Leaf!"
6847052,45646887,2015-09-04,17112540,Greg,"I had a wonderful experience Chelsi was really sweet. They provided coffee, continental breakfast, and towels in the morning.  The place was extremely clean and well kept. "
6847052,46782617,2015-09-13,26644805,Lisa,"Chelsi & Jeremy were out of town for the weekend, so it will as great to meet them before leaving. The condo  was like staying at a friends.  It was close to Alki Beach, farmer's market and great food."
6847052,47311687,2015-09-17,22514663,Mary Anne,"Though I only stayed for one night, I had a great time at the 7 Leaf B&B.  As I had a limited amount of time to explore Seattle, Chelsi was proactive in giving me recommendations on places to eat, things to see and tips on transportation.  The chef had whipped up an awesome salad (that looked as good as it tasted) before I headed out for my half day of sightseeing.  I learned quickly to be respectful of his work space (the kitchen) and washed my hands in the bathroom instead and would recommend doing this as well if you stay there.  After a long day of sightseeing, he was kind enough to bake some delicious cookies and cook bacon for a midnight snack.  As I was leaving the country the next day and my flight was too early for him to cook me breakfast in the morning, he offered to cook me breakfast at 1am before I went to bed and it was great!  I came to the 7 Leaf B&B for a unique experience as I do not smoke or consume cannabis in any fashion.  The hosts are very professional and I never felt pressured to partake in smoking.  I actually really enjoyed the late night conversation that I had with the host and other guests and learned about cannabis in a non-judgmental environment.  I would definitely stay here again in the future."
2277640,12520865,2014-05-04,14992870,Kate,"Kate and Danny go the extra mile to make your stay fantastic. The space is a perfect launching pad for your exploration of Ballard and Seattle. Quiet, clean and comfortable with lots of extra touches and charm. We stayed in the space for a friends 40th bday celebration. Kate left a sweet card, chocolate and wine! Much more than a place to sleep. "
2277640,12906589,2014-05-13,13426963,Theresa,I booked this suite just a few days before my parents arrived to visit me in Seattle. Kate and Danny have been so helpful and organized everything in such a short time. The place is really great and everything was so clean. My parents had a really great time there and I would definetly recommend it to friends or other families. Thank you so much again Kate and Danny!
2277640,12938154,2014-05-14,10699701,Nicky,"What fantastic hosts they have thought of everything.  It's a great neighborhood, easy parking and easy to walk to bars and restaurants.  The guest suite is beautiful, clean and to everyone's taste.  I highly recommend it and will be back again.  Thank you both for a wonderful stay."
2277640,13022123,2014-05-17,9689129,Matt,"I had a great stay at Kate and Danny's  suite in Ballard. Their communication was quick and clear. The unit was super clean with plenty of space to spread out. Coffee and snacks were provided and was a nice value add. The location in Ballard is superb, but the hi light was the warm cookies left by the door on Thursday! 
I would definitely stay here again."
2277640,13158951,2014-05-20,14614837,Sherry,"Kate and Danny were incredibly sweet and friendly and excellent hosts for my friend and I! The neighborhood is great, parking is super easy, and the space is really nice and clean. It was perfect for the two of us with a queen bed and futon. "
2277640,13254316,2014-05-23,4731278,Sharon,"I highly recommend this private suite. Kate and Danny are exceptional people.
They are genuinely invested in their guests. They live in a great neighborhood and they have a spacious, comfortable, quiet suite to share. They provided snacks and drinks and gave me a gift certificate and coupons to a local businesses.
Kate and Danny helped me with catching the bus (about 35 min. from downtown), directions, airport transport and check-in. One evening I came home to fresh chocolate chip cookies!! It doesn't get any better than this!
I regard Kate and Danny as friends and would come back without hesitation.
  "
2277640,13483056,2014-05-28,5003760,Coco Loco Jewelry,"Excellent Hosts! It was like we had our own private suite in Ballard. great Location, plenty of parking and very comfortable. Kate and Danny were so welcoming, accommodating and generous. Thank you so much for a great AirBnb experience. I would definitely recommend this place and will most likely stay here again next time we are in Seattle :) Thanks guys! See you next time."
2277640,13576987,2014-05-31,11108773,Ryan,"It was a great place to stay. Both Kate and Danny were very nice and responsive during the entire process and helpful exploring the city they love. Everything was clean and as explained in posting. The area the house is in is a short walk from a great shopping, food, and late night. I could continue but all of the experience was great. "
2277640,13798957,2014-06-04,15689597,Kris,Kate and Danny were very warm and inviting hosts! Their place was very clean and spacious and we really appreciated the added bonuses like breakfast items and the Keurig coffee! Their house is in a great location and we enjoyed exploring that area of Seattle. We would not hesitate to stay there again when we visit Seattle! Thanks again!
2277640,13970723,2014-06-09,4192878,Danielle,"We enjoyed our few nights in their home. It was tidy and had water, oatmeal bars and fresh fruit in the other room.

It was private, cosy and in a good location. Close to Delancey and The Fat Hen and a lovely bakery! The bus stop was quite close, too which was convenient.

They kindly gave us some Lyft discount cards and asked if we needed anything to make our stay more enjoyable.

We would stay again!

Thanks guys!

Danielle & Adam"
2277640,14158548,2014-06-13,6624536,Collette,"My parents stayed at Kate & Dann's suite while they were in Seattle visiting my husband and me. They felt it was very comfortable and was a great location. Had everything they needed and lot's of nice personal touches like coffee, tea, fruit, oatmeal, etc. When my parnets come back to visit they hope to stay here again!"
2277640,14451478,2014-06-19,16574651,Claire,"We had a fantastic stay at Kate and Danny's suite.  From beginning to end Kate was quickly responsive, kind, and accommodating.  It's the bottom floor of their house so you get the local feel while visiting - great neighborhood and close to so much.  Definitely take a walk to the Fat Hen for breakfast.  Really nice space, comfy bed, plenty of towels, some snacks, and a much appreciated Keurig machine! :)  Great outdoor space as well.  Parking was never a problem.  If there's anything you need, Kate will work with you.  We felt like we were staying at a friend's house. Highly recommended."
2277640,15138406,2014-07-03,8032862,Meghan,"My fiance and I had a great time when we stayed at Kate & Danny's!  The downstairs suite was super clean and comfortable and they were both very welcoming.  The fridge was stocked with a few snacks and bottles of water which is always nice!

The house is a short walk to a few restaurants & bars, but the ""old"" Ballard neighborhood was about a mile away - a quick cab ride, or walk on a nice day.

We arrived in Seattle really late, but the house was easy to find and easy to get access to.  Kate was also very communicative leading up to our stay, so there were no surprises.

I'd stay there again anytime!"
2277640,15261986,2014-07-06,5741737,Selena,"Kate, Danny and Falcon were wonderful hosts! We were in town to celebrate my birthday, and their hospitality was so appreciated. The suite was very comfortable and spacious for the two of us. Their home is situated in a beautiful neighborhood with many activities within a short distance. I would definitely recommend staying with Kate and Danny, and will likely stay again when we're in the area again."
2277640,15579211,2014-07-12,2368444,Jae,Loved the neighborhood the most! What a lovely part of Seattle. I enjoyed the little cafes around the area and Ballard. I also liked how clean it was. My mom is very picky when it comes to cleanliness and she thought it was very clean! There is plenty of room and closet space. I had 4 big suitcases and boxes to prepare for my wedding but it was still enough space. We had a little trouble with wifi but they fixed it immediately. They also check in with you to see if you need more snacks or anything. They do have a dog but he does not bark so I was not disturbed. The place is a little humid but Seattle is a humid place. 
2277640,15678950,2014-07-14,15137870,Kate,"This private suite was just as advertised - extremely clean, bright & charming! A bonus on this hot weekend in Seattle: the suite was air conditioned too!! Kate & Danny were extremely responsive and informative - we had breakfast at one of their recommended spots (The Fat Hen) and it was lovely (and just a short walk from their house).  They also offered water, coffee, fruit, granola - it was very nice. I would highly recommend staying here for your next Seattle visit."
2277640,15913810,2014-07-18,148474,Kathleen,"The place was accurately described in the listing and well-suited for our needs. The breakfast nook and small refrigerator was a nice touch as it allowed us to have our morning coffee as we arranged the day. The neighborhood was nice, both quiet and quaint, with convenient access to downtown Seattle on the Rapid Ride and a scattering or restaurants within walking distance. The hosts were very friendly, providing us with information about their city and advice about what to see and how to get to certain locations. We really enjoyed our stay there and would recommend it to others."
2277640,16065477,2014-07-21,15279756,Andrew,"My wife and I loved staying with Kate and Danny! Their place is really cute and cozy and the room is identical to how it appears online. In addition to the bedroom and bathroom there is also a second room with a futon, fridge and microwave that we used for our meals as well as to lounge. We came to Seattle during a warmer time and we were glad to see a small fan in the closet that we could use. They also have air conditioning available, but it wasn't warm enough for us to need to use it. The neighborhood they live is also really excellent, my wife and I walked and drove around it for hours; it's great if you love exploring nature! Kate brought us fresh picked blueberries midway through our stay and we loved them! I highly recommend booking your next Seattle Airbnb with this couple!"
2277640,16775661,2014-08-02,7836123,Kerrie,"Wonderful place! Clean, quiet, spacious, and very comfortable! Would definitely stay again!"
2277640,16977325,2014-08-05,15153120,Michael,"Ok, first of all Seattle during clear summer days makes Kate and Danny's job easy.  Their home is in a perfect neighborhood to access all of the cities abundant charms and still enjoy easy quiet time.  The suite is so comfortable you will not want to go home, and my wife who is picky (Martha Stewart is her hero...seriously) was super impressed.  The fresh picked berries were not a surprise due to earlier reviews but put a sweet sweet capstone on our trip.  But where my highest kudos comes in is that they did not ""HAVE"" to do everything they did from planning, suggestions, berries, Uber coupons, communication, and most importantly giving us the space to feel as if their home was our home, but they did.  And they did this in a way that was easy unforced and unobtrusive.   We cannot wait for our next trip to Seattle and when we do we hope this lovely, and yes ""Private"" second home is available."
2277640,17204973,2014-08-09,10090834,Dina,"Our Stay at Kate and Danny's place was the perfect start for our trip through the USA and Canada. We enjoyed our stay in the beautiful and comfortable suite and loved the quite area! If we're happen to be in Seattle again one day, we'd definitely stay there again."
2277640,17437320,2014-08-12,1228090,Meg,"Kate and Danny's Private Suite couldn't have been a more perfect place for my boyfriend and I to stay in Seattle. It's impeccably clean, private, and quiet, plus it has one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. Communication was super fast and friendly, and every detail (coffee! fresh fruit! extra blankets!) was thoughtfully taken care of. The neighborhood is also great-- with plenty of bar and restaurant options within walking distance. We'd definitely stay again, and recommend it to friends."
2277640,17688015,2014-08-16,3677394,Lindsay,"Kate and Danny were excellent hosts.  They stayed in touch ahead of the booking date, and provided helpful information.  The suite was spacious and meticulously maintained.  It had air conditioning, too, which is just unheard of in Seattle - it was amazing on the hottest day of the year!  Everything was just like the pictures."
2277640,18006585,2014-08-20,5556065,Britta,"Nice location, my daughter loved the park on the next block. Very comfortable. Quiet neighborhood, and the only sounds we heard were faint footsteps overhead occasionally. Nice to have fresh fruit, oatmeal, hot beverages in the morning. Recommended!"
2277640,18189827,2014-08-23,19011584,Shuang,Excellent!
2277640,18309367,2014-08-25,15372014,Iris,"It was our first Airbnb experience and it couldn't have been better. Clean, spacious room in a very nice neighborhood. Great restaurants nearby and walking distance to Ballard Locks. Kate and Danny were very welcoming and gave great advice for Seattle. Light breakfast provided was perfect after the long flight. I wish we had stayed longer!"
2277640,18620102,2014-08-29,17345303,William  F.,"Gracious and cheerful hosts welcomed us into their suite, a ""home away from home.""  Quiet neighborhhod nw of Seattle.  Exceeded our expectations, and this was our first airbnb experience.  They are welcome in our home any time.  Nancy and Bill"
2277640,18711105,2014-08-31,11271994,Hila,"Kate and Danny were awesome hosts! They were never more than a text message away with local recommendations and helpful information. The suite was perfect for us, very comfortable, and spotless. We totally fell in love with the neighborhood of Ballard. Not knowing much about Seattle before the trip, I'm so glad we just happened to end up staying in this beautiful, charming neighborhood. We wandered the area and enjoyed seeing the community gardens, gorgeous views of Seattle, and the lovely Golden Gardens Park, as well as all the great restaurants and bars. We also did a kayak tour with Ballard Kayak located in Golden Gardens Park--highly recommend. We'd stay here again in a heartbeat!"
2277640,18938548,2014-09-03,15937836,Taggart,Kate and Danny were very accommodating and the apartment was very nice and clean. Easily accessible to the D-line bus. Would highly recommend.
2277640,19038203,2014-09-05,19711408,Erick,"Awesome, amazing, and fantastic. Very neat and clean with extra amenities. It seems like they thought of everything! Great area in Ballard and only a 20 minute bus to downtown. Highly recommended! "
2277640,19421057,2014-09-12,6808127,Jeanine,The stay was so easy. Sleeping soundly was a joy on the comfortable bed and quiet location. And there was always the perfect parking place available right in front. 
2277640,19713887,2014-09-16,21234516,Jill,Kate and Danny were great hosts! Their guest suite is a cozy home away from home getaway. Their location in Ballard was convenient for all our planned activities. I definitely recommend staying with them!
2277640,19927276,2014-09-21,12097150,Carmen,Kay and Danny were great hosts. They made our stay in Seattle WA a pleasure. We enjoyed staying at their cozy suite. 
2277640,20493553,2014-09-30,1495386,Gregory,"Kate and Danny are great hosts with a beautiful apartment.  The location in Ballard is close (3 blocks) from one of the best pizza parlors in Seattle, and a terrific bakery, bar and breakfast/lunch restaurant.  The bus to downtown Seattle is also 3 blocks away, and a 30-35 minute ride.  Uber and Lyft services are readily available too.  I had a car for part of my 7-day visit (easy street parking), and really only needed it to visit Boeing's manufacturing facility in Everett - a highly recommended tour!  The Ballard Sunday farmers market has the best looking vegetables you will ever see, and the area along Ballard Ave, more fine restaurants.  All in all a terrific base to explore the Seattle area."
2277640,20680036,2014-10-03,21962139,Tina,"We had an excellent stay! Kate and Danny were gracious hosts and made us feel very welcome. This was our first airbnb experience and we were fortunate enough to have Kate and Danny as are hosts. The rooms very very clean and comfortable, and the other amenities were just perfect for our stay. The location was ideal for us as well, with great coffee and food within a short walking distance. Thank you for the great conversation, as well, Kate! We may very well be back!"
2277640,20737649,2014-10-05,937329,Jennifer,"We had a great stay at this spot! Exactly as promised, extremely clean, lots of useful amenities (iron and ironing board, coffee, nice hangers in the closet, etc) and it was very easy to communicate with the hosts. They were very accommodating regarding our late arrival and early departure. Located in a beautiful, safe, and very walkable neighborhood in Seattle. Highly recommend!"
2277640,21030903,2014-10-10,19387101,Becki,"Our experience was great.  The information we had when we came in (where the suite was, restaurant recommendations, house rules, etc.) was very clear and well displayed.  The suite was just as described.  I was traveling with my brother, so they had the 2nd room with a futon set up for us on our arrival.  When we told people where we were staying we got a lot of comments like ""I don't want to have to stay somewhere where I have to have a conversation with someone"", ""I don't want to have other people around an bugging me all the time"".  Let me just say that this is NOT how Kate and Danny operate.  They touched base a couple times throughout the stay to make sure everything was okay, but they weren't dropping in all the time ""bugging"" us.  They also made it clear that they were around for any questions/recommendations.  We had our week packed full of stuff and were really only at the house to sleep, so we had to ""set up"" a time on the last day of our stay just to ""meet"" the people who provided this amazing house.  When you stay in a hotel you risk getting a room near an elevator, or with loud people above you.  You won't have this problem here.  Don't get me wrong, from time to time you will hear them walking above you, but couldn't hear anything else.  It was very quiet and peaceful.  Kate and Danny thought of everything to make the stay great.  They provided basic toiletries and a blow dryer, they had a mini fridge and microwave, city guides in the rooms, water, granola bars, fruit, tea, coffee.  It was all very well thought out.  The 2 rooms and bathroom were very spacious and clean and just as advertised.  Parking was always available on the street right in front of the house.  I would absolutely recommend staying here.  It was nice and close to downtown Seattle (15-20 min drive max for us even in traffic), easy access to I-5, a lot of cute restaurants in the area.  Thanks so much for opening your beautiful home to us Kate and Danny!"
2277640,21145006,2014-10-12,21194653,Jennifer,Thank you so much for hosting my friend and I. I loved your house and the neighbourhood so much. Everything was super clean and thank you for all the resources for traveling around. I will sure be back to stay at your place again. It was a great first airbnb experience.  I really recommend staying there.
2277640,21314292,2014-10-14,428327,Jennifer,"Our stay at Kate and Danny's was great!  The space is very clean and comfortable.  I only met Danny, and he was very friendly.  We will definitely try to book their place again if we need to be in Ballard.  Highly recommended!"
2277640,21408548,2014-10-16,22459016,Cary,I had a 100% positive experience. The accommodations were just as they were described. Everything was super clean. Access to the house and all correspondence was easy and effortless. Kate and Danny are charming. I'll be back.
2277640,21513521,2014-10-19,9738554,Becky,"Kate & Danny's place was super cozy, clean, and spacious. They provided water bottles and granola bars for us too! One thing to be aware of is that you enter through the front door of their house and they live upstairs. But this was never really an issue for us as we had complete privacy. "
2277640,21743847,2014-10-23,12138871,Alexandria,staying with Kate and Danny was amazing! their little downstairs place was so clean and fresh. the bed was so comfy and warm. I loved that they provided us with slippers to wear and lots of coffee and tea and granola bars. I also enjoyed the yard we had access to. Kate was so easy to get in touch with before we arrived and during our stay. I only wish we had run into her and Danny and falcon earlier in our stay because they were so friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend staying here. it feels homey but still clean and professional enough that I could still feel like I was away on vacation.
2277640,21868348,2014-10-26,10284066,William,"Just like the description/picture - super clean, welcoming downstairs suite in a house in a quiet residential neighborhood.  Nice amenities with the coffee machine & fixings, granola bars, bottled water.  Hosts were there if we needed them, but otherwise unobtrusive.  Keyless entry was great, especially since we were coming back quite late at night."
2277640,22188415,2014-11-01,46980,Barbara,Kate and Danny's place is exactly what they advertised: a private suite in charming Ballard! Everything was very clean and our hosts were very accommodating to help us with little things. There are excellent places to eat in the neighbourhood as well as a bus into downtown and a car rental within minutes. Great place at a fair price!
2277640,22644331,2014-11-11,19933485,Cynthia,"What you see in this photo is what you get, PLUS lots more! Kate & Danny's place is wonderful; great neighborhood too. We felt secure, it was quiet and they keep this place immaculately clean. There's more to the place than this photo, another whole room with Kuerig machine and snacks and they left things in the frig to make it all complete. We slept like babies and had plenty of space to give each other room. We were visiting relatives who lived nearby and we stayed for 4 nights. We will go back again and again because of the convenience and how comfortable we were. We were way more comfortable here than in the many hotels we have stayed in. We highly recommend Kate & Danny's place."
2277640,22956711,2014-11-18,5462960,Alan,"Kate and Danny were very considerate hosts and our stay in Ballard turned out to be a very pleasant one, despite some unseasonably cold weather. The modern downstairs space with efficient heating certainly helped combat the wintry conditions. We liked the location which was close to the main “Rapid D” bus line from downtown Seattle and we also made use of the little food extras, and coffee maker provided in the living room. A number of restaurants and cafes were also within easy walking distance of the house and our hosts provided written information on these businesses. 
I should also add that the accomodation was spotlessly clean and Kate was very responsive in making sure that we did not run low on the coffee - two enthusiastic coffee drinkers here.   "
2277640,23069425,2014-11-22,6949029,Judith,"The accommodations were great, matching the description on the website.  The location was perfect for us--close to our daughter's place in Ballard and close to downtown.  The street was quiet and parking was readily available.  Love the access code entry system.  It is much easier than a key.  Only suggestion would be to provide a chair in the entry way to sit on while taking shoes off and putting them on."
2277640,23235785,2014-11-26,17590842,Vickie,"Wonderful private perfect clean
And that's just beginning "
2277640,23587257,2014-12-05,38157,Annie,"Perfect Airbnb stay!  Kate and Danny are warm and welcoming, as is the space.  The bed and bedding are high-quality and comfortable, the sitting room / extra bedroom is outfitted with a mini-fridge, keurig coffee maker (complete with both tea and coffee cartridges), fruit, food bars, basic dishes and utensils, and nice big filtered water pitcher.  They are located in a clean quiet neighborhood with plenty of parking (we had 2 cars and easily found spaces for both).  The keyless entry made it so that they simply gave us the code and we lived there for four days without even meeting them until we finally made a point of saying hello in person upon check-out. They are a super friendly young couple with a terrific and mellow dog, Falcon, who have clearly put a lot of thought and effort into creating a comfortable space. Thank you, Kate & Danny!"
2277640,23764724,2014-12-09,21699745,Sarah,"Kate and Danny were extremely welcoming and had so many great recommendations for places to eat in the area and where to go. While we never actually met (there's a private entrance) I knew Kate was only a text or phone call away. There was a little coffee maker, mini fridge, and microwave and she even set out some oatmeal and granola bars for us for breakfast! I stayed here with my boyfriend and we were ""those guests"" who accidentally spilled red wine and it got on the white sheets! Needless to say I was mortified. Kate was super chill about it and I left some money for her to be able to replace them since there was no way it was going to come out. Overall it was a great cozy getaway to Seattle and I would highly recommend staying here :) "
2277640,24485891,2014-12-29,11136794,Kari,"We had a great time visiting Seattle. Our accommodations were perfect. It was great to have the 2 separate rooms so one of us could sleep late and the other could read, drink coffee, listen to music, etc. Extras like coffee, cream, some breakfast items were much appreciated. Our bed was very comfortable as well.
We loved being close to some restaurants that were within walking distance. The neighborhood was quiet and fun to explore and walk in.
We will definetly return to this cute and cozy and comfortable airbnb."
2277640,25285542,2015-01-11,25272525,Jill,Great space in a cute neighbourhood. Rooms were bright and clean and the bed was very comfortable! We would definitely stay here again.

2277640,30165084,2015-04-18,30743434,Brian,"Unfortunately, we did not get to meet Kate & Danny, but we had a lovely stay at they place.  The suite is very private, clean and quiet.  The neighborhood seems very pleasant.  Kate was very responsive to all of our texts.  Thanks for a great place to stay!"
2277640,30821237,2015-04-27,31179424,Bonnie,"Kate and Danny were excellent hosts!  Every detail of the home was thoughtfully arranged to make it feel welcoming and comfortable.  The rooms were clean and beautiful.  My daughter slept on a futon in the second bedroom, and she was very excited to have the kitchenette in her room!  

The neighborhood is convenient and pleasant.  Restaurants, an ice cream shop, and a little market are all within a mile or less, and the neighborhood is lush with flowers and gardens.

Our hosts were professional and easy to reach whenever I texted or emailed.  I highly recommend this suite for a getaway in Seattle!"
2277640,31189770,2015-05-03,11919262,Erin,"Our stay in Kate and Danny's suite was very enjoyable. The bed and pillows were incredibly comfortable and the bedroom has wonderful natural light. We also liked that they kept a fan in the closet which we always like to use at night for a little white noise.  The bathroom also had a lot of natural lights and the shower stream was nice and strong.  We appreciated having the second room to store all our stuff, and it was very helpful having the mini fridge and a Kuerig for some late night hot tea and snacks.  We did hear a little bit of noise from above, but it wasn't anything that kept us awake at night.  The neighborhood is fantastic.  Parking was a breeze, and we were easily able to walk to several delicious neighborhood restaurants (at Kate's recommendation).  Communication with Kate was always quick and friendly.  Overall, it was a great stay.  "
2277640,31934091,2015-05-12,26294754,Madlen Und Basti,"We stayed 4 days at Kate and Dannys beautiful appartment and couldn't have found a better one for our very first Air'bnb. Kate and Danny provided us with everythink what could be needed plus cereals, coffee, tea and a variety of caring products. 
The bed was very comfortable (we also found some sweets and lot's of information material beside it :) ) and the sleeping room has a direct connection to a pretty garden space.
Bus connection to downtown Seattle is just four blocks away, but also Ballard (market street) is worth visiting). Highly recommendable!"
2277640,32163272,2015-05-15,28276901,Thomas,"The place was comfortable and clean and had everything we needed for our short stay. The area is nice and relaxed with access to downtown on the bus. 

Met Kate briefly and she seems very nice. 

Would recommend this place for a few nights."
2277640,33087986,2015-05-25,29459597,Celina,"Kate and Danny were terrific hosts and the suite was lovely.  It was spacious, clean and inviting, and Kate and Danny left us granola bars, fruit, and oatmeal, along with coffee and tea.  There was even gourmet chocolates on the bedside table!  It was so relaxing to come back to this space after exploring Seattle.  Would highly recommend! Thank you Kate and Danny!"
2277640,34292034,2015-06-07,1804341,Nicholas,"My wife and I had a wonderful time staying in Kate and Danny's suite over a long weekend in early June. They were very gracious hosts, happy to chat with us about the city and their favorite spots, but also respecting our privacy. The suite was immaculate and they included some thoughtful touches like chocolates in the bedroom! The neighborhood is ideal for those who, like us, don't want to be right downtown. It is quiet and residential feeling, but there are a couple of fun restaurant/bakery/bar strips within easy walking distance. There are also two bus lines that will easily get you to downtown and to Fremont.

There is still plenty of Seattle left for us to explore, so we hope to be back!"
2277640,34637497,2015-06-10,31490321,Bb6kayo,We stayed at Kate and Danny's for a couple nights on our trip and it was our first Airbnb experience. The ad was everything that we thought it would be and more. A very professional level of cleanliness and a very nice level of privacy considering you're in the same house. The location is a short drive away from everything we wanted to see and the neighborhood seemed pleasant as well. Kate was quick to respond to my questions and was helpful. Would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting this area and in this price point I think you can't beat it! 
2277640,34935460,2015-06-14,27848133,Marianna,Our hosts were very communicative and accommodating. The suite was charming and very clean. We were very happy with this reservation and would highly recommend to anyone! 
2277640,35241892,2015-06-16,23497269,Fiona,"This recent trip to Ballard was lovely and Kate and Danny were great as hosts! Kate was very helpful with navigating the neighborhood and provided some great recommendations. The accommodation so comfortable and convenient for our stay. The suite had everything you could need in a visit, with a few extras! It was cozy, clean and quiet, and in a great location (close to nearby bakeries and access to the bus). We enjoyed our stay, and I would definitely return! Highly recommend!"
2277640,35639753,2015-06-21,14654030,Erin,"Everything was exactly as described.  I really enjoyed my 2 night stay.  Chocolates, fresh fruit, coffee, tea, and drinks were provided.  The neighborhood is quiet and there is plenty of parking.  Downtown Ballard is about 1.5 miles away and is easy to walk to (or about a $7 cab ride).  Easy access to public transportation as well.  I didn't spend a lot of time in the suite, but it was very comfortable.  I would definitely stay here again."
2277640,36423003,2015-06-28,28580919,Serena,The place was lovely and cozy.  We would definitely stay again.  Kate and Danny were very accommodating and very friendly.  Everything that was listed was included and more.  
2277640,36675449,2015-06-30,12703445,Heather,"Kate was very welcoming and easy to communicate with. She checked on us to make sure we had everything we needed. Her place was very very clean and just as described. It was perfect for our short stay in Seattle. There was also plenty of parking on the street. Thank you, Kate for a great stay!"
2277640,37143289,2015-07-05,8739423,Janet,"We spent two restful nights in this clean, comfortable, cozy suite in Ballard. Kate and Danny provided clear instructions that made check-in seamless, and generously gave suggestions for places to eat, best places to view fireworks, etc. This quiet residential neighbourhood includes some interesting little eateries just a few blocks walk away. We had a very positive experience, and would definitely stay here again."
2277640,37707820,2015-07-09,17087406,Lottie,"Kate and Danny were wonderful hosts. They sent us a helpful guide book with local restaurants and events before we arrived. Efficient in all planning and details. Plus the place was comfortable and soothing decor, everything very convenient that you might need. Exactly as described in their posting. They were friendly and welcoming, but respected our privacy too. A lovely neighborhood, pleasant, friendly; people say hello to you as you walk around. FREE PARKING--amazing in Seattle. Short drive / bus ride to downtown Seattle. Would definitely stay there again."
2277640,38423038,2015-07-15,36554689,Margaret,"This was our first experience with airbnb and Kate and Danny made our trip very enjoyable and we highly recommend it to others.  They were organized, accommodating and friendly and we appreciated the easy access with the keyless door entry, safe and clean environment and resourceful welcome letter."
2277640,38993972,2015-07-20,2515813,Donald,Great location and wonderful apartment.  Will be sure to book here again next we are in Seattle.  Thanks Kate & Danny
2277640,39345381,2015-07-22,2781248,Tyler,"Kate and Danny's place was so incredibly easy and comfortable. Everything is extremely clean and well kept and the location makes it very convenient to get to all parts of Ballard, Fremont and Phinney. We could not have asked for a smoother experience!"
2277640,39744005,2015-07-26,31474799,Lois,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The rooms were very clean and nicely decorated.  We especially appreciated the quiet setting.  The free street parking was readily available.  The fresh fruit, snack bars and filtered water  made us feel welcomed.  I would definitely stay again."
2277640,40130355,2015-07-28,6967207,New,The rooms were clean and comfortable.  We were out sightseeing so only used the suite for sleeping .  We received email confirmation prior to our arrival in Seattle and instructions.  Since the living space was separate and our stay was short we didn't require anything else from our hosts.
2277640,41733919,2015-08-09,30858985,Christopher,"Great place to stay in Ballard. Apartment is exactly as described, along with special touches such as coffee, granola bars, and water bottles. Quiet, clean, and spacious with two very accommodating hosts. Would definitely recommend to others. "
2277640,42129918,2015-08-11,4451032,Nina And Ben,"We had a wonderful time staying at Kate and Danny's. The suite is just perfect, with every little detail covered. There was everything we needed for a good breakfast, chocolates by our bedside and all bathroom toiletries taken care of. Also lots of reading material on Seattle, which was a great help. The suite is spotlessly clean, I mean it shines! It was nice to be able to use the back terrace to drink an aperitif after a long day exploring Seattle. If I was returning to Seattle this is the only place I would stay, you will get better service than in any hotel. Thank you so much Kate and Danny."
2277640,43091103,2015-08-17,22045230,Vinh,Place looks exactly like the pictures. Host is very easy to get a hold of and communicate with. The area is not to far away from downtown and has some great areas for food and drink. Would recommend renting a car if you're going to stay here.
2277640,44107562,2015-08-24,33524151,Raven,"The property was lovely and very comfortable. I thought it was really thoughtful that fruit, toiletries, and visitor's guides were available in the property. We really loved the location, and the neighborhood was great for walking to local shops and restaurants.

I would definitely stay again and would recommend to others visiting the area."
2277640,44899654,2015-08-30,12033185,Susana,"Great accommodation. Pretty location in a quiet neighborhood. Extremely clean. Loved the coffee, tea, fruit and snacks!"
2277640,45479878,2015-09-03,13503947,Grace,Wonderful stay at Kate and Danny's. Everything was clean and just as described. Kate was so very accommodating and a pleasure to work with. Hope to stay there again when visiting our college kids:) 
2277640,45925268,2015-09-07,31072942,Josh,"We absolutely loved our stay at Kate and Danny's beautiful home in Seattle.  The home is located in a charming, quiet section of town but is either walking distance or a very short drive or bike ride to lots of great neighborhoods, including the main Ballard area, Fremont, Green Lake, and others.  The accommodations are spotlessly clean, very comfortable, spacious, and well-appointed.  Kate went very far out of her way to make us feel welcome in the city and at her home.  We really can't say enough about how much we enjoyed our stay here - by far our best Airbnb experience, and very highly recommended."
2277640,47389990,2015-09-18,2117910,Andrea,"Kate and Danny have been great hosts! The place looks just lovely. They put a lot of thought into it and every single detail. The appartement was very comfy. Although there is no possibility to cook, you don't need to be hungry - just follow the recommendations Kate and Danny will give you where to find good food. We tried some and they all turned out delicious! :-)
We met both and they are just so nice and friendly and took good care of us and made sure we have everything we needed. I really would stay at their place again!"
2277640,50683695,2015-10-13,748769,Joe,Had a wonderful stay at Kate and Danny's.  Apartment was spotless and very comfortable.  Kitchen had great coffee and breakfast food.  Will definitely stay here again!
2277640,52857144,2015-11-02,690927,Julie,This Airbnb was even better than described!! The hosts provided very clear information in advance and great suggestions for enjoying our time in Ballard
2277640,54861256,2015-11-25,6949029,Judith,"We are repeat visitors at Kate & Danny's apartment.  This apartment is a great home base to explore Ballard, Seattle, and surrounding area.  The listing accurately describes the apartment (including the ease of parking on the street in their area).  The keypad entry is a very convenient--you do not need to worry about a house key.  The list of places to eat and drink is very handy.  
"
2277640,56313444,2015-12-12,1767541,Dann,"Kate an Danny's place was great! Clean, and quiet, and just what I needed in a great location. I'd definitely stay here again. "
6795678,35883165,2015-06-22,17272258,Kari,"My partner and I stayed at this incredible spot just outside of Capitol Hill in Seattle for two nights and were very impressed.  The apartment is quiet and private with a separate entrance and easy street parking.  Inside there is a full living room, kitchen, bathroom, study area, and bedroom - and all are modernly decorated and fun.  The king size bed was more comfortable than my own bed at home, and the bedding was perfect for the climate during our visit.  They had breakfast foods, coffee, juice, tea, etc. for us.  They thought of everything and we had a great experience staying there.  The price was spot-on and I would book this location again in a heartbeat.
Thanks Blair and Kate!"
6795678,36600705,2015-06-29,36011119,Kaitlyn,"Everything about this apartment was wonderful! It is just as clean and cozy as the pictures. It was spacious and comfortable, with lovely decor. The location was perfect for my family and I, and it was very convenient for getting to the places we needed to go! I loved the urban, modern vibe that it offers and it was a perfect location to stay in the city of Seattle! "
6795678,37259798,2015-07-05,13584066,Eileen,"Blair and Katie were amazing hosts.  I visited with our French exchange student and both of us loved having our own little apartment from which to come and go. The apartment is spacious, very clean, and extremely comfortable. Better bed than any hotel (or my own for that matter.)  The little touches meant a lot - like an offer for ground coffee and cream, and a paper on our doorstep in the morning.  Blair & Katie were extremely responsive and went out of their way to help us feel at home.  The location puts you within walking distance of downtown Madrona and just steps away from a 10 minute bus ride to downtown."
6795678,37682278,2015-07-09,21936526,Martin,"Blair and his family were extremely welcoming.  They provided us with some eggs from their chickens, a bottle of wine, and some other foodstuffs to get us started.  We were there on the 4th of July, and Blair gave us great advice on where to see fireworks.  Overall, our stay in the apartment was superior!  

The apartment is very roomy, the kitchen is well-equipped, and the location is very convenient for the Capitol Hill neighborhood.  Plenty of parking on the street in front of the house, and a nice grocery store just a few blocks away.  We would definitely recommend this location!"
6795678,39657424,2015-07-25,23213901,Vladimir,listing was accurate
6795678,39957756,2015-07-27,19341036,Christopher,"This is a really lovely apartment! The shower is one of the coolest I've ever been in; the design is unique and the stone-work floor is super comfortable on your feet in the morning.

To enter the place was a piece of cake, and Blair left really clear instructions. There were a few goodies in the fridge for us as well, and the unexpected highlight was opening the door one day to find chickens just roaming around.

The hosts were wonderfully communicative, reaching out throughout our stay to offer help and responding quickly to our requests. They were awesome.

I would definitely recommend staying with Blair. My only note would be that you can hear the people upstairs walking, so if you're a light sleeper, you should take that into account. I'm not sure how much noise we made going in the other direction, but we certainly tried to be cognizant of it after we realized the clarity."
6795678,40260329,2015-07-29,13897410,Emily,"Great communication with Blair, he was quick to respond and made us feel welcome. The apartment space was clean, bigger than I anticipated, and comfortable. We both loved the funky shower as it had great water pressure! The bed was very comfortable and we both read in the main living area. There's no tv but we didn't want one. Fridge and cupboards had misc items like non-dairy milk (almond I believe?), tea, coffee, basic spices, etc. We weren't in the home much and were enjoying Seattle's food! "
6795678,40631918,2015-08-01,37065236,Emily,We had an absolutely fabulous experience staying with Blair and Kate. Their private basement apartment is perfect for anyone looking to stay in Seattle and have your own place. The neighborhood is adorable and their property is fabulous. No complaints at all!
6795678,40961509,2015-08-03,1679583,Nick,"Great place! I highly recommend it to anyone seeking an affordable, hip, clean place to stay in Seattle."
6795678,41641224,2015-08-08,10132822,Jean-Louis,"Brand new apartment in Seattle. Very cozy and confortable. Shower and Kitchen are very nice and there is enough space for 4 people. The description is totally accurate.
Highly recommend especially because Blair and Kate  are very nice hosts. They are very helpful and responsive to help at any time. They have a small kid who spent time playing in the back yard with my 2 kids.
Kate even took time to bring my wife and kids to the beach.
Thank you very much."
6795678,42276723,2015-08-12,36087797,Drew,"This was our first airbnb experience and it was great. We enjoyed the location and felt like were coming home at night. Easy cab ride to city center, downtown, etc., but far enough away to escape the city hustle. "
6795678,42732950,2015-08-15,3107255,Sarah,"We had a great time staying in Blair and Kate's basement apartment. It was just as the pictures show inside, and they had thought of everything when it comes to amenities. The bed was very comfortable, and the shower.......amazing! Of course now I'm home our shower feels like a dripping tap in comparison!! Thanks for a great stay. We really enjoyed meeting your family."
6795678,43012065,2015-08-16,41098436,Emi,"私たちは間違えて、この場所にたどりつきました。
間違えた場所に来て、どうしたらよいか途方に暮れていた私たちを暖かく迎えてくださり、本当に感謝しております。
何も食べず、夜遅くに辿りついた私たちに、食料の入った冷蔵庫や冷凍庫にあるものを食べても良いと言ってくださり、お部屋もとても広く、過ごしやすくて、快適でした。
次回もシアトルに行く時は、アクセスもよく、優しいホストがいらっしゃるこの御宅にぜひ伺いたいと思います。"
6795678,43513647,2015-08-20,37695593,Brian,"Everything about this place was as advertised! Blair and Kate were very welcoming and accommodating, the apartment was massive and beautifully furnished/maintained, the location was in a cool neighborhood just outside of downtown, and they actually might have the best shower in the state of Washington. Really enjoyed the stay and would recommend it to anyone heading to Seattle - thanks Blair & Kate! "
6795678,43827127,2015-08-22,16782566,Kyle,"Blair is the man! Super accommodating host in a great neighborhood not too far from downtown. Apartment was super clean and tidy, with plenty of space. They even hooked us up with a bottle of vino and some organic free range eggs for breakfast! To top it off, Blair mailed a some stuff we left behind back to NYC for us. What more can I say! Oh, and washer/drier was clutch for cleanin clothes mid trip. CLUTCH"
6795678,44156415,2015-08-24,37947440,Marianne,"We stayed 2 nights in Blair's basement apartment. It is exactly as pictured in the photos and very clean and comfortable. The refrigerator was stocked full of goodies including fresh eggs from the resident hens (who we happily visited) and everything else one could think of, including a lovely bottle of wine. Unfortunately for us, we had already stopped at the grocery and picked up quite a few snacks and our busy schedule didn't allow for us to take advantage of all the wonderful items left for us. As noted in the profile, Blair left us to our own devices, other than to check on us when we arrived to be sure we had everything we needed and a run-in in the garden where we said our hellos. I had emailed ahead of time asking for restaurant recommendations and Blair came through with terrific ideas. Le Pichet was perfect for my French boyfriend and even the Pink Door, supposedly fully booked, squeezed us in on Saturday night for my birthday dinner, so kudos to Blair! We had a rental car that was easily parked outside the house, but we took the Uber car service everywhere so we didn't have to deal with parking. The house is located on quite a busy thoroughfare, but is very quiet inside. We did notice some street noise in the master bedroom, so we just used the fan in the bedroom closet for ""white noise."" Same with the small amount of footsteps we heard upstairs.  There was no concern there, as we knew ahead of time it was a basement apartment. Everything was top-notch - couldn't have asked for a better place to stay!"
6795678,45514138,2015-09-03,5570563,Owen,"This is one of the most beautifully kept Airbnbs I've stayed in. It was clean, organized, and VERY well furbished. The huge bed is very comfortable, the desk was wonderful to get some work done, and the living room is a great gathering place. A++ home, I'd live there! 

There was a very small con to staying here. The noise from above. The Airbnb is located underneath the main house, where walking, running or talking is heard VERY clearly through the ceiling. It was quiet at night, and in the early AM, so it was completely bearable. 
"
6795678,46160912,2015-09-08,40291242,Jennifer,We really enjoyed our stay. The place was very clean and it was quiet. I also appreciated that the host left a list of things to do in the area. We would definitely stay there again. 
6795678,46915580,2015-09-14,40984298,TaeHee,The apartment was very clean and comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet and an easy $15 Uber ride to downtown.
6795678,47376700,2015-09-18,38289182,Michael,"I can't say enough about how outstanding our experience was at Blair's. It was our first time booking with Airbnb and it exceeded our expectations immensely. Blair initiated and maintained contact before during and after our 3 day stay. We were greeted by a complimentary bottle of wine along with a detailed list of  useful activities and amenities to make our stay as agreeable as possible. And it was just that. Blair gave us several great recommendations which included a visit to the serene Madrona beach/park area which was a close walk away, as well as the nearby Tallulah's restaurant which had a great modern-fresh menu and stellar craft beer selection. The place has a comfy king-sized bed, washer and dryer which we were able to make use of, towels (beach and bath), full kitchen, and a pretty nice grocery store 3 blocks away where we bought groceries and cooked half of our meals while in Seattle. We took Uber several times from the house and made it downtown in 15 minutes during rush hour. Staying at Blair and Kate's place truly felt like home (the chocolate chip cookies they brought us didn't hurt either) and they  went out of the way to make our stay in Seattle one of the best we've had travelling.

6795678,47718848,2015-09-21,41308906,Marjorie,Well appointed and comfortable apartment. Cleverly designed and soacious. Did not feel like a liwer level apartment. Quiet for an urban neighborhood. 
6795678,48904775,2015-09-29,24552594,Maria,"Overall a great experience! The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed, close to some nice breakfast/brunch places, and about 25 min bus ride to downtown.

Blair was very responsive, always available to help and provide sight seeing suggestions since it was our first time in Seattle."
6795678,49558543,2015-10-04,23131290,Lucia,"The days in Blairs house are so comfy just like at home ! Even though I think myself is good at home design , I have to say I learned a lot from them. Blair's home design of color and function are very good taste and smart!  And they are very very very very nice people! The only regret of our trip is we have no chance to spend more time with them. Something urgent happened to us, we have to do 1 day earlier check out, that's all ourselves reason, I didn't expect them to refund the money, what they really don't need to do . But they refund the money to us! Thanks is not enough for me to express my appreciation. 
Next time I went to Seattle , Blair's place is definitely my first choice!"
6795678,49934145,2015-10-07,36471262,Greg,"Blair was great to deal with from the first communication. I was in town for my son's birthday and Blair gave me suggestions on where to go and what events were going to be in town when I was in Seattle. 
It was easy to find his home and the unit was as described, very clean, big king size bed and a great shower.
The location was walking distance to Seattle University and the surrounding area. 
I would highly recommend staying at this unit if you are visiting Seattle."
6795678,50810798,2015-10-14,9542652,Jason,Blair's place was awesome! The shower was very funny. Had a good laugh when we arrived. The place was completely spotless when we arrived. Bed was super comfortable. Thanks for the great experience :) 
6795678,51372130,2015-10-19,2563814,Scot,"One of the best AirBnB stays so far. Blair made us feel very welcome. We loved that there was a keyless entry, and the apartment was fantastic. Waking up the next day, we were greeted by Blair and two croissants. Our weekend was pretty packed with activities, but Blair offered to give us tips and suggestions on what to do if we needed them.

I would highly recommend this AirBnB and would most definitely stay there again when I'm in Seattle."
6795678,52097283,2015-10-26,29069405,Mary,"Thank you the place is lovely.  Blair gave great directions for 2 country seniors from a small coast town the big city is pretty scary.
the apt. is great very clean, well stocked if you were to cook, very comfortable king bed, and cool shower. The whole place very well done. We enjoyed our week end with our granddaughter at Seattle U. Would recommend this place to anyone coming to Seattle. Nice area close to down town."
6211882,32288093,2015-05-16,29803546,Satadru,"Jeff is a very friendly and welcoming person.  He has a big and pretty townhouse. I spent about a week on the ground floor of the house. It has a bedroom and attached bath. It was very nice. The place is in Beacon hill, which is a quite neighborhood of Seattle. Very well connected to downtown both by bus as well as train."
6211882,33154416,2015-05-25,21153217,Tony,"Jeff was out of town during my stay, so his roommate acted as my host. He was very easy going, friendly and shared lots of common interests. Very spacious and nice townhouse. Conveniently located next to a public transit. I look forward to returning again in the future!"
6211882,43034502,2015-08-17,32235999,Rhys,"Very nice space, bed was a little hard but kitchen, bathroom, and neighborhood were all great, and Jeff was very accommodating."
6211882,43540726,2015-08-20,40023450,Hyejin,"I really love this room. It was so clean and made me relaxed. Two bus stops are only 1minute away by walking. It takes about 15-20minutes to go downtown without transfer. Jeff is very kind. If I have the chance to go to Seattle next time, I will choose this room again :)"
6211882,44038302,2015-08-23,7661744,Raghunath,"Jeff's guest room was ideal for me to stay over during the weekend. The condo is very accessible, both by public transit, and if you have  a car.  He had all the essentials one would need when on travel. The  Parking was a non-issue as well.

Jeff was a great person himself. We were hoping to hike together before I left, but my plans changed in the last minute. Thanks again for hosting me, Jeff!"
6211882,44586023,2015-08-27,41480244,Olin,Jeff's place was great.   10 minutes from downtown.  10 minutes from the baseball stadium.  Great location.  Next time I go to Seattle I'll try to stay there again. 
6211882,46249658,2015-09-08,43386204,Henry,Jeff was a great host. Very fast to respond and offers a very nice room.
6211882,46634636,2015-09-12,27050505,Arthur,"This listing is a good fit if you just need somewhere to lay your head. Having a queen bed and private bathroom is fantastic. There was street parking available, but it was definitely limited. It's nice and close to get downtown, it was a $6 uber ride one way, or the bus is handy to the unit as well.

Common area is a bit sparse but the kitchen is very nice, and Jeff and his family were great hosts. Having the key to come and go and know my belongings were locked up was very reassuring.

"
6211882,46979255,2015-09-14,36396120,Ping,Nice host and good location. Very clean and beautiful. I would like to stay there again if I will go to Seattle.
6211882,50843841,2015-10-15,42073225,Wennan,I had a great experience. The house is really nice and is close to bus stops. And the hosts are very friendly and helpful.
6211882,51360709,2015-10-19,30737472,Kylie,"My partner and I were in Seattle for 3 days to find a home before our move from Kentucky a week later. This task was extremely stressful for us because we both had never been to the city and it was extremely last minute. Our stay at Jeff & Ying's was perfect because they were very detailed and we were given a key to the front of the house and our bedroom so we could come and go easily. The listing is extremely accurate, but Jeff & Ying went above and beyond by leaving us chocolate on our first night ;-) I would recommend staying here if you are coming to the city without a car because the bus is on the same block. We also were very pleased with the local restaurants within short driving/walking distance. When family & friends come to town, I will be recommending Jeff & Ying's space for sure!! "
6211882,51849079,2015-10-24,10557936,Elizabeth,"Jeff was gone but my husband and I enjoyed meeting his wife, Ying.  The location on north Beacon Hill is close the highways to shorten my husbands commute to Mercer Island, and to downtown by light rail so I could enjoy a day downtown at the art museum.  The home is very clean, new, and well kept.  The room is a nice ground floor bedroom with an attached full modern bath.   The bedroom is near a sort of busy street so expect to hear some street traffic.  Nothing that kept us awake, however. We had no issues finding street parking in front of the condo.  There is another person living in the home other than the owners but she is a lovely person who's room is two floors above you. The only negative is that there is no TV in the house so there is nothing to do in the evenings.  The house is rather spartanly decorated (no pictures, no TV, one couch in the living room, no curtains) because Jeff and Ying are waiting for their furniture to be shipped from overseas.  The kitchen is well stocked. We enjoyed our stay"
6211882,54507127,2015-11-21,20059453,Zane,"Ying (Jeff's wife) was so welcoming, nice and accommodating.  It was an extremely clean environment with easy access to major bus lines that could get you anywhere in Seattle.

I was here for an med-school away rotation at Haborview (email hidden), excellent location for both. 

I would definitely stay here again without hesitation."
4340410,21930725,2014-10-26,22861447,Andrew,"Andrew's place was very clean, and welcoming! It was very comfortable  and we felt right at home! The condo is located in a great neighborhood with great restaurants within walking distance, and was a very short distance from downtown Seattle. Also, there is a lot of public transportation nearby and a bike rental right across the street. We would definitely recommend it and stay again!"
4340410,40759191,2015-08-02,5325886,Evelyn,The location was great for where I needed to be. It was easy to get to with a lot of street parking. Andrew was also super accommodating since we arrived really early that day and he let us check in early. He also checked in with me a lot to make sure we had everything we needed. Great host!
4340410,40931176,2015-08-03,19290062,Blair,"Location is directly below major freeway #5.  No air conditioning, and suite was 86 degrees when we arrived.  Opened the window to cool it down but had to shout at each other with the window open due to freeway noise.  There is a tower fan provided.  One towel and one facecloth was provided for my wife and I.  The shower curtain is extremely dirty at the bottom from.  There appears to be a dog that resides in the residence as there was hair found on night stand and dog food present.  I should have inquired about this more carefully with my (website hidden) is being acquired off of Amazon, i think, and channel reception was so very poor we could not watch any.  This was our first time having experienced coming into someone's home where they typically live every day and simply moved out for the night to allow us to stay there.  We will be more selective in the future."
4340410,48970120,2015-09-29,44896191,Eugene,"Location is great for us (2 adults and 1 child), it's right outside downtown, roughly about 3.5 miles, so we avoid all the traffic but close enough to get in and out of the city. Place is located just north of downtown. 

The living area is nice and cozy. It is located under a freeway though. You can hear it in the living room but it's pretty silent in the bedroom. If you plan on sleeping in the living room couch and a light sleeper this won't be the ideal place for you. Bedroom is nice and quiet. I slept well throughout my stay. 

Everything was described in full detail and exact to the tee so there's no confusion at all. There were some minor issues with the sink but we were notified before hand and didn't effect us at all. Our overall experience was great and will book again if we come back to the Seattle area. Great communication before and throughout our stay. "
4340410,57933328,2015-12-30,38004930,Francine,"The place was neat and comfortable. The place smelled musty, like sweaty feet when we walked in. We opened the window in the living room but it was so loud from the traffic since the place is right under the 15 freeway. Was hard to hear one another. The fridge was dirty. The bathroom shower is very little and small flow.  Parking was on the street under the freeway because the host had his car parked in the space in the parking garage. Our car was safe. But there is a homeless camp right there. 

The location was great and convenient. We had a late lunch at the cafe across the street when we first arrived and watched the Seahawks game. We are runners, so we ran from the place to nearby parks and trails. That was nice. The description also says right on the Lake, it's not. It's across the street with businesses and residential in between. No view of the lake from the place. "
8653843,50812268,2015-10-14,46120594,Wei-Cheng,The owner is very nice and friendly. the house very clean I like here 
8653843,51563328,2015-10-21,42028924,Jean-Baptiste,"Gayne is probably one of the best host. She is very helpful with everything so you can feel comfortable. She always asked me if I needed a lift and even dropped me downtown on my first day in Seattle!
The room is cosy and as described, the house is pretty well-furnished so you will not miss anything.
The neighborhood is quiet, really close to Green Lake and only 15/20 min away from downtown by bus (which stops very close to the house).
Do not hesitate and say hello when you see her!"
3426639,15243267,2014-07-05,17457228,Kelsey,"Leah was super helpful and gave great recommendations of places to go. The location is great—it's in a neat neighborhood with lots of things in walking distance.  Room was clean, bed was super comfy, and I have only positive things to say about our experience! Would totally stay here again next time I'm in Seattle!"
3426639,15564547,2014-07-11,16755792,Fred,I needed a very last minute booking and Michael was very swift in replying and dealing with. Really appreciated it. Can't leave much of a review as I got there at midnight and left at 9am. Host was nice enough to provide donuts in the morning. 
3426639,16124869,2014-07-22,7666223,Angel,"Very welcoming place, full of friendly people ready to share a glass of wine or diner with you. Though the room reminded me of my student years (very basic, just a bed and shelves), this was all I needed to stay for a couple of nights, at a cheap price in a beautiful residential area were you will sure have very pleasant walks. Close to Capitol Hill lively district, but also a couple of blocks away from a big supermarket, 5 mn walk from buses. Last but not least, I was a bit worried that noise in the house would be an issue (the room being adjacent to the kitchen were people go back and forth) but as soon as my light was off, never heard a noise (and I am very sensitive)."
3426639,16528227,2014-07-28,1998488,Jenni,"Communication was great and I was made to feel really welcome upon my arrival. The room was very basic, the bed super comfy and I had everything I could need. The area is full with awesome things and is in close walking distance to lots of nifty sights. Thanks for having me on short notice too!"
3426639,16803424,2014-08-02,4052537,Cameron & Kelly,I had a wonderful experience staying with Michael. Excellent communication and welcoming procedures. The room was clean and well lit. Little things like fresh flowers was a delightful touch. Leah another house mate was exceptionally helpful. Thanks.
3426639,16940219,2014-08-04,17885173,Scott,"The room in Capitol Hill Excursion Part three was just as advertised. Its a clean private room in a shared house within the great neighborhood of Capitol Hill. My girlfriend and I stayed for a weekend and were real happy with how close the house was to all the good restaurants and bars in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. I never met Michael, but interacted with the other roommate Leah who was friendly, considerate and accommodating. "
3426639,17133542,2014-08-07,13059079,Stephanie,"Simple room with a nice view in cute house in unbeatable location. We loved the area, fantastic view over Seattle and so many fun things to do, good cafés, good Pinball bar, fun shops etc... All housemates were very friendly. The shower was not that rich in water, which we didn't mind much, but good to know if morning spa routine is important for someone. We were out and about a lot so we appreciated the simplicity, and would stay again when visiting next time. "
3426639,17581072,2014-08-14,11081353,Daniel,"Michael, Leah, Nick, and Austin were a pleasure to stay with! My brother and I actually didn't end up spending much time in the house, Seattle kept us very busy, but we always felt welcomed and well accommodated. Our late check in and early check out times were no problem and our hosts were kind enough to leave us fresh towels to shower with and a list of things to do in the city. 

The house itself is pretty old, with low water pressure, squeaky doors, and all the little quirks that go along with an older building. Nothing that was a deal breaker for the week we stayed though. If you are looking for a very reasonably priced private room and some great, personable hosts that are genuinely interested in helping you have a comfortable and fun time then this is the house for you!"
3426639,18259943,2014-08-24,6313579,Elaine,"It was very easy to connect with the hosts, grab keys, and get adjusted in our room. The room pic is accurate and it is set up well for 2 guests sharing the room. Great location and easy stay! I didn't see hosts too much,but they were friendly when I did! "
3426639,18730979,2014-08-31,4296293,Barbara,"The host and his roommates were very prompt in helpful with email communications before and during my stay.  The location is very good, close to amenities and transit.  Neighborhood is urban and full of construction and diversity.  House and room description are accurate, though this is an older home in decent but not excellent repair.  When I was there the shower water supply was inadequate to wash my hair, but host is tring to remedy situation.  Shared bathroom wasn't sparkly clean but adequate (C-)."
3426639,18890763,2014-09-02,18696159,Keya,"Listing was in a great neighborhood and the room was accurately described. It's small, but was totally adequate for our purposes and the hosts were friendly, too."
3426639,19033551,2014-09-05,8284455,Errol,The room was exactly what I was looking for. Great neighborhood and an all around good experience.
3426639,19227514,2014-09-08,20408169,Liz,"The host was great! Very attentive and responded quickly with any questions that we had. They were very welcoming and it was a pleasure to stay with them! We weren't in the house very often, but when we were everything was great. The location was a perfect walking distance to the local coffee shops/restaurants and we both would definitely stay there again!"
3426639,19350394,2014-09-10,7967727,Helen,"Leah provided excellent response time and was very friendly when we met, as was Michael.  The location is very handy to a good walk downtown.  Thank you"
3426639,19444331,2014-09-12,16751138,Veronika,"Leah and her roommates were open-minded, polite and supportive. They recommended us nice places and activities in Seattle. The appartment had an awesome location very close to entertaining bars and in walking distance to downtown. Thank you for letting us stay with you! "
3426639,19641594,2014-09-15,20942487,Geoff,Host provided some pretty awesome donuts. Place was clean and comfortable. Good location.
3426639,19751122,2014-09-17,19742253,Meg,My hosts were very helpful and informative. The listing was accurate and the location can't be beat!
3426639,19966221,2014-09-21,1336537,Masha,"I had a wonderful time in Seattle - the host is very friendly, room is quiet, the bed and comforter are comfy  and warm. The house is shared by a group of roommates and temps, so there a plenty of interesting friendly people to talk to. The only downside is lack of shower - I actually just opted out to use a cheap spa nearby instead. The house is lived in but not dirty. For the price it's great deal and overall a positive experience. "
3426639,20058760,2014-09-22,4791001,Beatrice,"Michael was awesome! The room was as described, clean, comfy, with a big window and fan for AC. Location is super convenient in Capitol Hill. Highly recommended!"
3426639,20711619,2014-10-04,1673459,Nicolas,"The house is well located, and the hosts definitely very, very nice - I only met Michael, and we had great conversations. The only average point is about the cleanness - kitchen and bathroom could be a little cleaner. The bedroom is rather small as well - there is not more than what you seen on the picture. But if you only stay for 2 days as I did, it can be a good choice."
3426639,21111131,2014-10-11,8961346,Mary Anne,"Perfect location, accessible to everywhere, and the housemates were all considerate and answered all the questions I had. I would certaintly stay here again. "
3426639,21454787,2014-10-17,5744863,Alina,Cute cozy room and very nice hosts. Just what we needed. Thanks!
3426639,21690227,2014-10-21,11340165,Alex,"The host/hosts made us feel very welcome. Everyone was quite friendly and easy going. Although there were several people residing in the home there was no issue with using the bathroom or the kitchen. The location of the house was in a great spot and just a couple minutes walk to lots of restaurants and shops. We drove to Seattle so finding a parking spot near the house was a little tricky at times as street parking is limited. The hosts responded to questions fast which is a major bonus :) The room is a little tight for two people but is manageable. The only issue we had was the water pressure in the shower. Our hosts did warn us before hand regarding the shower as what comes out is almost a fine mist which doesn't really do the job of getting any soap off. Luckily neither of us are too fussed about most things, but if you're the type of person that needs good water pressure then you might want to keep this in mind when booking. Other than that we had a fine time staying here and felt very safe and welcomed. "
3426639,21759159,2014-10-23,12477204,Emily,"Nice, neat place to stay for a night on Capitol Hill! Lively, very convenient to downtown. I didn't get a chance to interact with Michael and Co. much because I was just there overnight for work, but they were really helpful with directions and there for me if I needed it. I'd totally recommend staying here!"
3426639,21920468,2014-10-26,22695011,Samantha,"My partner and I had a great time! The location was really perfect, the room was pleasant, and the roommates that we met were very nice and welcoming."
3426639,22050863,2014-10-28,22848070,Tom,"Was quite pleasant, they were available whenever needed yet provided privacy too.  A good experience all around, even the shower water pressure."
3426639,22741058,2014-11-13,17660903,Laura,"We stayed in Michael and Leah's place for 5 nights and it was a great base to explore Seattle. The location in Capitol Hill is great, easy to walk around, near lots of restaurants, bars, shops etc. and also walking distance to downtown. The room itself is snug but fine for a short stay, fit 2 people and all of our stuff (just). The house felt a bit like a student share house but the housemates were all lovely and welcoming and very happy to give us tips and recommendations. Thanks guys!  "
3426639,22935880,2014-11-17,23682496,Gregory,"Listing description was very accurate.  Very easy process, exactly what I wanted.  I met one of the hosts who was very welcoming.  Great location!"
3426639,23613139,2014-12-06,3077649,Chuma,I wish I lived here. 
3426639,24060383,2014-12-18,14557538,Lea,"Communication with Michael was great, we got clear instructions on everything we needed. We did not see anyone else at the house, all roommates were pretty quiet.
The room was fairly small but was just fine for what we needed. Clean and comfortable, located close to a lot of cool shops and restaurants, a wuick bus ride to downtown also. Overall a good experience!"
3426639,24316794,2014-12-25,3750891,Ahmed,"friendly roommates, awesome location and the room was comfortable, cozy and affordable. Would definitely stay there again!"
3426639,24680198,2015-01-01,19478364,Naomi,"My stay here was wonderful and cozy! The room was always perfectly warm and sleeping in the bed was like sleeping on a cloud. Also, you really can't beat the location -- it's truly in the heart of Capitol Hill, Seattle."
3426639,24947001,2015-01-04,3909562,Tawnee,I loved my little nook! Was a perfect location. And a very good price! surprisingly warm in the house. The only problem again was the water pressure from the shower but I was already knowledgable about the situation. Would stay there again if the shower was fixed. Also getting the key and finding the room was easy thanks to Leah! Very welcoming and let us jam out on their guitars! 
3426639,25067807,2015-01-05,20088184,Kevin,"Unfortunately we were just in for a quick nights sleep and didn't have time to meet the hosts or any of the other guests, but the house was exactly as advertised. We really enjoyed the 3rd floor room with a great view of the city. Amazing location too especially at that price. 

Rooms are a little small but we had no issue with that. Our only real complaint is the water pressure in the shower. To say its low is an understatement. Its really more of a fine mist that makes it difficult to get anything more than your face and hair wet. It was actually easier to just use the faucet as more of a pseudo bath. Oh well we didn't let it  hamper our stay in Seattle!"
3426639,25428304,2015-01-15,8836557,Hayley,"Cute place in a great location! I stayed here for two nights when I just got back to Seattle and it was perfect temporary place for a Seattleite. Can't beat the location. (I personally love Capitol Hill!) The room itself was pretty cozy. I had the attic room shown in the picture and the bed was so comfortable . As of my stay, the hosts made it clear that they had read the reviews with regards to the water pressure in the shower and were addressing it. And by my last night, they had it fixed! Nice people, comfortable place. It's like staying at a friend's house. "
3426639,28543469,2015-03-25,26790857,Sally,"We had an enjoyable stay. Leah was very helpful and available on airbnb message since we didn't have a US number. She quickly showed us where the washing machines were when we asked.
The house is well located in a quiet and tree-lined street very close to all the goings-on in capitol hill. 
The house was welcoming with a great lounge and comfy sofas. The bathroom was clean, shower was powerful and worked easily. There was even a drawer of complimentary toiletries and bits.
I would definitely come back and stay here if I am I  Seattle again."
3426639,28685661,2015-03-28,23539969,Carlie,Great Capitol Hill location! Comfortable bed and overall great experience. 
3426639,30332549,2015-04-20,6376715,Erika,"Joe and I felt welcome from the moment we walked in the door. The listing was very accurate - a comfortable and quaint space in a phenomenal location. Michael's neighborhood is super cool. Joe and I had fun exploring the culinary delights, arboretum, and farmers market. Both our room as well as the rest of the home were clean and inviting. "
3426639,30802746,2015-04-27,29486533,Kevin,Amazing neighborhood! Walking distance to great restaurants and nightlife. Downtown and other attractions was a short Lyft away. Our hosts were accommodating and even mailed out a forgotten item after we left! Staying here really enhanced our Seattle trip. 
3426639,31660789,2015-05-08,31592846,Taiki,"Stayed two nights at Michael's place, to meet my friend and do sightseeing in Seattle.  Michael and leah were quick to respond to my questions.  I enjoyed staying this place without no worries and problems.  Room itself was good for us, just staying and sleeping here.  Access to Downtown was very convenient, very close to the bus stop, and could find nice restaurants near here."
3426639,31919347,2015-05-11,13615642,Gwen,Everyone was extremely welcoming and flexible with our arrival and departure time. Michael and his roommates are great hosts that made us feel right at home. Thank you!
3426639,32093354,2015-05-13,12263334,Aurel,"Me and a friend stayed in Michael's room for two nights in order to explore Seattle. All the important sightseeing spots in downtown were easily accessible within 30 minutes by foot. We didn't meet Michael himself but his flatmate Leah was very friendly and obliging. The room itself is not very luxurious but if you want to see Seattle and you plan to be often on the move, we definitely would recommend this place!"
3426639,33259812,2015-05-26,30928697,Sean,"Quality place to stay in Seattle, easy to get to all major destinations by way of bus or walking. Our Hosts were very accommodating too. They even bought some communal doughnuts and coffee in the morning. Great Place to stay."
3426639,34140426,2015-06-05,5834264,Marie,"Michael and Leah were very good at communication. They emailed us information on how to get to the house, the description of the house, the rules and also how to check out. Leah was the one taking care of us as Michael was travelling. We had a very good interaction with Leah. There was a binder with the roommates recommendations in Seattle and it was just perfect. The location is great, very quiet and also really close to Broadway street, with grocery shopping, restaurants and bars. We had a great experience thanks to Leah and her roommates."
3426639,35074320,2015-06-15,27162212,Nick,"Great place to stay, and hosts to match.  Very easy to get in contact with, and eager to help however they can.  Worked perfectly for what we needed."
3426639,35649130,2015-06-21,8712612,Alex,"We had a great time staying with Leah and Austin. They were great hosts. We got to enjoy the city and this prime location. Honestly, for the price we paid I really can't complain. I would stay here again. "
3426639,36024010,2015-06-24,7022436,Jessie,We had a great stay in Michael's room! The location was wonderful - just a short walk from a number of bars and restaurants and also walking distance from many other Seattle sites! We loved the house itself too - it made us feel comfortable to know that they clearly have airbnb guests all of the time. They were very organized and made it an easy process for us.
3426639,36214914,2015-06-26,16119611,Nina,"What we love most about our experience here is the way they communicated with us, from thr time we booked until we left the premises. Everyday we would receive a message asking how our day went and every text we had was answered quickly. We are very happy with our stay in Seattle with Leah, Austin and the other flatmates, and we will definitely book here again when we are again in Seattle. Thank you so much for the welcome Starbucks coffee roast and pressor, we are able to have that wonderful coffee experience right inside our room."
3426639,38264964,2015-07-14,26022976,Hernan,"Michael, Leah y Austin siempre estuvieron disponibles y fueron muy amables durante nuestra visita. La ubicación de la casa es excelente, pues está cerca a muchos restaurantes, un supermercado y una estación de bus pero a la vez está ubicada en una calle tranquila y silenciosa. A pesar del fuerte calor que hacía en Seattle durante los días de nuestra estadía, nuestra habitación tenía aire acondicionado, lo que solucionaba el problema. 

El lugar siempre está limpio y cuenta con una cocina con todo lo necesario para guardar o preparar nuestra comida. 

Recomiendo el lugar y agradezco a los anfitriones por ayudarnos a tener unos días increíbles en Seattle.
"
3426639,39024334,2015-07-20,9579731,Rachel,Good neighbourhood. Nice house. Only downside is one toilet for multiple rooms and very busy with people coming and going. Great communication from hosts and really helpful. Would recommend as a budget option. 
3426639,39532538,2015-07-24,2969348,Charlotte,"This is a great place to stay, a lovely area that felt very safe to walk around at night on my own. There is a huge grocery store right around the corner, and plenty of bars and places to eat nearby if you want.

The instructions and communication I received before and during my trip wete top notch, very thorough. I got a pretty good nights sleep although I needed ear plugs because of the sound of fans going in the room next door, this was no trouble though, and I found the bed to be comfy.

I also enjoyed talking to the other Airb'n'b-ers and the guys who live in the building, particularly as I was travelling on my own. I'd definitely reccommend this place to solo travellers, its safe, friendly, and you get lots of information and help."
3426639,40091199,2015-07-28,32909642,Edward,"my friend and i had a great experience here! everything was in place for us when we arrived. it was clean, the hosts were friendly and accommodating, and everything was as expected from what we read in the manual. i would definitely recommend staying here! the only concern is parking, which we were warned about beforehand by the hosts. parking is limited, but we made it work! despite the parking issue, i would still come back to stay here because everything else was just perfect =)"
3426639,40582494,2015-08-01,6123622,Michelle,"Leah was very communicative and check out and in was a breeze. The home is incredibly clean, well located, and we felt very welcome. Little signs explaining how certain aspects of the older home work and spare toiletries and food were a nice touch. Definitely an affordable way to see Seattle.

The cons are the room itself. We were in Seattle during a heat wave and the air conditioning did very little to cool the room down. Sleeping, napping or just being in the room was plain uncomfortable. That being said, if you're just looking for a place to crash at the end of the night, and are more concerned with price than comfort, this might be a good fit for you."
3426639,41073254,2015-08-04,25776143,Siqi,"It was great staying with Michael and Leah in Capitol Hill! The room was small but very cozy and had everything we need. We loved our experience at Seattle very much. I highly recommend staying here. The house is close to a lot of attractions and has a big grocery store just a few blocks away. What's more, Leah gave us a 50% discount to the SEA on our departure! "
3426639,41592270,2015-08-08,32597888,Julien,"Evyrithing was so easy! We really felt at home during our stay, the house was really clean.
We had been able to do everything by foot and Capitol Hill is really a great place to live in. 
"
3426639,42621658,2015-08-14,40889843,Yao,Micheal's place feels like home. It's cute sweet and quiet. It's absolutely an awesome place to stay. I'll came back if i even stay in Seattle again. 
3426639,44301553,2015-08-25,5531202,David,"Leah was very welcoming and friendly. The house is in a great location, a short walk from many restaurants and bars in Capitol Hill. At one point during my stay, the light bulb died, but Leah provided me with a new one almost instantaneously. Would definitely recommend!"
3426639,44688077,2015-08-28,13326226,Colin,"It was a great place for the value, perfect for a no-frills traveller!

There was minimum interaction with Leah, but all the instructions are directions are clearly written for us. There was also tea and coffee, so you just have to make them yourself in the morning if you want to.

The room was a little stuffy in the afternoon and the aircon smells a little weird, but it would not be a problem if you had gone out before 12pm and come back after 8pm. For the amount I paid, I would say this is a very good experience and definitely value for money.  The bed and sofa was very comfy and I loved it. "
3426639,45367981,2015-09-02,4052244,Nicholas,"The place was awesome just as described! Very comfortable and close to everything I wanted to see. The host even checked up halfway through to make sure everything was going well, very accommodating."
3426639,46136172,2015-09-08,2111544,Katie,Great place to stay for a quick trip! Michael and Leah made the experience seamless -- we even got a ride to the airport. The location was wonderful and central for exploring a full breath of Seattle. Capital Hill had some great spots to explore as well. Thanks for helping make our first stay in Seattle as successful one :)
3426639,46977094,2015-09-14,43312326,Neeraj,"Nice and comfortable in a great neighborhood, as advertised! No interactions with hosts or guests, but everything was very smooth."
3426639,48117453,2015-09-23,2821356,Hugh,Leah was available to provide any information required.  Nice house in quiet location.   A few minutes from main thoroughfares.  All facilities available.     Great value particularly for someone like me travelling alone. For me it was close to the family member I was visiting.   It was nice to meet other airbnb guests which I probably would not have met had I stayed in a hotel.    Would stay there again. 
3426639,48323130,2015-09-25,2821356,Hugh,Very comfortable room. House had all facilities.   House in very quiet street yet minutes from Pike & Pine Sts. Loads of restaurants locally.   Leah very helpful with information on local area. Other airbnb guests friendly.   Recommended.  
3426639,49072246,2015-09-30,358847,Fouad,The room description was accurate and there wasn't any interaction with the hosts. The place kind of spoke for itself through little signs and notes hung everywhere. The room was spacious and put together well. 
3426639,53651497,2015-11-10,23338488,Ken,"The host was very hospitable, but with little contact. Every thing is laid out and fairly self-explanatory. The place is in a very central location, it seemed as if everything was in walking distance with light rail and train stations about a mile away. 

The room was spacious and sufficient for my needs. I would recommend anyone staying there."
3426639,54767684,2015-11-23,1409323,Nikki,"The room was exactly as described, clean and spacious. The location was in walking distance to good eats and bars, with a quick 10 minute drive to other fun neighborhoods in Seattle. Would definitely stay again!"
3426639,55237614,2015-11-29,25363995,Howard,"Mike and Leah stayed in constant contact throughout the process and answered all questions. The room was just what I needed, warm and quiet.  I would recommend this home to any traveler that needs a place to crash.  Reminds me of the Hostels in Europe.  I will be returning!  Thank you Mike and Leah for sharing your home with me.
Blessed be,
Howard
"
3426639,55835148,2015-12-06,9613139,John,I had a great visit at Michael and Leah's place.  They make sure the room and their house is very welcoming for guests.  The bed is warm and comfortable.  Had a great visit.  Cool part of town as well.
3426639,56285925,2015-12-11,38677430,Saetbyeoul,"The room makes me feel at ease. Room is very clean !! I want to live there!!   
i wish coming again later:) and i love Seattle!! Thank you "
3426639,56532405,2015-12-14,12347322,Zachary,"Leah was very responsive and attentive. When I had questions she was prompt and concise.  Pleasant exchanges. 

Good location. 

Mixed feelings about the space--I didn't feel like it was a great value or particularly nice. Just outside the door is a sheet partition with another mattress on it that is presumably used for other guests, which was unoccupied while we were there. Nonetheless it detracted from the space and gave it more of a college roommate feel. 
I'd check to see how many other guests are staying with them if this might be be an issue for you.
Bed was comfy. Room was clean. 

Bathroom is also located downstairs which was a bit of hassle. Had instructions to wipe down the shower with a  squeegee and bleach after each usage. Feels like your living in a COOP rather than paying top dollar for a room when you encounter things like this. 

House does not have the most inviting smell. There' s a lot of carpet, so I suspect that's the culprit. 

We were asked to prep the room and empty the trash, which may sound petty on my end, but when you are paying for a hospitality service this is the kind of thing that I think guests shouldn't have to worry about or concern themselves with. 

While we were in Seattle and wanted to run around in the city there were times when we felt like we'd miss some rule or get something wrong and offend our host.
There were more rules and things to consider than in any other AirBnb I've ever stayed at. I don't think we had any infractions but it was a distraction from our stay in general. 

If this was about $25 less expensive I wouldn't say much on a negative front, but I think it ought to be far more hands off for the guests and offer a bit more in terms of privacy. Rather than cramming guests wherever possible."
3426639,57317167,2015-12-24,50056881,Meg,"Leah had great instructions and signs around the apartment to make it very easy to get settled in. 
I loved having my own private little space to come back to each night.
The room was furnished with plenty of towels, a locking cabinet, plenty of clothes storage, and even a little tea/coffee kit, umbrella, and city guide."
9711153,55708718,2015-12-04,4779945,Ashok,"Great experience. Cam has a charming cottage that is warm and comfortable. Super clean, great location, easy parking and a super-friendly host who ensured I had everything I needed and was very easy to communicate with. She was very accommodating to changing plans. Look forward to staying again at Cam's place when I am in Seattle next."
9711153,55772076,2015-12-05,2403057,Alan,Camellia's setup was really nice--all the fixings were ready & convenient. Great part of the hill & affordable. She was very communicative & generous. Would definitely return!
9711153,56635652,2015-12-15,50613206,Josh,Staying at Camellia's cottage in Capitol Hill was well worth it! She is very helpful and her cottage has all the amenities a person could need. It is also a short walk to many of the bars and restaurants on Cap Hill which was pretty cool.
9711153,56690892,2015-12-16,16053668,Thomas,"Clean, friendly, and a very good location. I would stay here again for sure. "
9711153,56834763,2015-12-18,4779945,Ashok,"Lovely neighbourhood, lovely cottage, lovely host. Great experience as always...my home away from home in Seattle!
"
9711153,57193548,2015-12-22,18256528,Devin,"Camellia is a wonderful host and really helped me out of a jam when I (like a dope) was stranded in Seattle waiting for my passport to be shipped to me. Her place was beautiful, clean, and an overall most excellent stay especially for that price! 

Thanks so much Camellia! I'll be sure to say Hi next time I'm in town. "
4251235,27839662,2015-03-13,27448934,Susanne,We didn't meet the host and all arrangements were done through a 3rd party. This arrangment still worked well and we had easy instructions and access to the apartment.
4251235,29725903,2015-04-12,5424794,Tesalia,"All around, a very good experience, and quite accurate in its description.  Check in, use, and check-out were all very effecient and the representative of the listing agency was very responsive and helpful on the phone.

"
4251235,30794571,2015-04-27,30054221,Paul,Listing description is accurate.  The place is nicely furnished.  Phenomenal view of the harbor.  Quite happy with the experience and how easy it was to get checked in and out.
4251235,47265834,2015-09-17,5617068,Connie,Great location.  Beautiful view.  Lovely apartment.
4251235,50275354,2015-10-11,20631334,Kristina,"This was my 5th time visiting Seattle and this is by far my most favorite place that I stayed. Short 5 minute walk to Pike Place and the waterfront. Even a doable 20 minute walk to the Space Needle if the weather isn't too bad.

The pictures of the unit on here do not do it justice. The view of the waterfront was absolutely stunning! 2 large bedrooms and 2 full bathrooms allowed my family of 6 to stay comfortable. Plenty of extra sheets and towels were provided as well. They even had a filled britta in the fridge, a small gesture that was much appreciated after our travels!

Amazing place to stay- highly recommend!"
4251235,51757309,2015-10-24,11103631,Rachel,"My colleague and I were traveling to Seattle for a conference and stumbled upon this listing – and we're so glad we did! The apartment was exactly as described: super clean, easy to get to, great amenities and right in the heart of downtown, with gorgeous views of the water. We arrived late in the evening and check-in was quick and painless, as there's a 24-hour concierge for key pick up. Would definitely recommend this apartment and Sea to Sky Rentals when planning a Seattle visit. "
4251235,53172929,2015-11-06,41572270,Gary,A wonderful space to hang out and relax in. My mother and her best friend had a wonderful stay in this unit. I would not hesitate to arrange another stay here for my out of town guests and hope to do so again! Thank you!
4251235,55711531,2015-12-05,11308417,Alexandra,What a wonderful apartment. The view of the Seattle waterfront was amazing. Checking in with the building concierge was easy. Great use of space...two full bathrooms!  Loved it. Will stay again. 
609610,1816640,2012-07-27,3028020,Robin,"Laura and Karlo were amazing hosts. The apartment I rented was clean and warm, with its own entrance, bathroom, a fully loaded kitchen and all the things you would need for a long term stay in Seattle (although I was there for only 3 days). What really made my stay in this B&B so nice was all the little details and the kindnesses of the hosts, from picking me up at the train station (only 5 minutes from their home - but nice when lost in a new city) to guiding me on efficient ways to travel (20 minutes by bus from downtown), free internet, fresh eggs from their own chickens, and even introductions to their friends who happen to be in my same industry. Overall I had a lovely stay and would return in a heartbeat."
609610,1864976,2012-08-01,3034349,David,"This was a great place to stay! It's in a more residential area, a place you might not head if you were just looking at downtown Seattle. The walk to the light rail station is quick and easy - we had no problem returning from downtown to drop our stuff before heading back out to dinner, for example. The light rail tickets are very inexpensive for a day pass back and forth.

The apartment itself was great - a full kitchen makes breakfast super-convenient before hitting the road (even more convenient if there are fresh eggs from their chickens, which we had one day!) Full size bed plus a couch that could fold down, plus another couch, so plenty of seating area and such. Wifi made life easy as well.

Our hosts were very helpful and informative, quick to provide any information we needed, etc, as well as being generally nice people."
609610,1887001,2012-08-04,727329,Tamar,"Lovely place, lovely people. We felt at home right away--welcoming hosts,   small touches like fresh cut flowers, comfortable beds (with the best pillows ever), fully equipped kitchen, delightful garden,  We felt lucky to have such a beautiful place right in the city."
609610,1918109,2012-08-07,2028311,Adam And Abbey,"Laura and Karl were fantastic hosts! We couldn't have asked for a more conveniently located and adorable place to stay in Seattle. Laura and Karl even made themselves available to give directions and ""tourist advice"" throughout our stay. They were super friendly and extremely accommodating (going as far as bringing us a fan in the hot weather)! The apartment is very cozy, spacious and clean! We, once again, had another amazing experience with airbnb.com! I hope to reconnect with Laura and Karl again in the future! ~Abbey and Adam

"
609610,1964118,2012-08-12,663370,Jorge,"Laura has a wonderful warm and generous spirit and was quick to give us insider information on the local neighbourhood and immediately set us up with provisions for an impromptu sunset picnic. Who could ask for more? The only draw back was that we only stayed one night. Given more time, this would certainly have been a five star experience."
609610,2003697,2012-08-16,2466046,Jason,"This review is a little overdue (sorry Laura that it took so long), but Laura and Karl were excellent hosts and were very accommodating during my stay. The apartment was clean, spacious and very pleasant. They also live a short walk away from a really cool and lesser known part of Seattle that I enjoyed exploring. The transportation to the downtown area is also easy. "
609610,2175179,2012-09-02,3354923,Tiffany,"A nice, comfortable, and convenient place to stay near the city, but outside the bustle of downtown. It was nice to have a more homey feel, rather than a hotel. The host was very helpful and friendly! It was a good deal for the price. The backyard was pleasant and I loved the chicken coop! The area is full of nice little ethnic eateries and shops. We used a car for all our transportation, but taking public transit was an option. I am not sure I would feel comfortable walking around the neighborhood by myself at night however, being a woman and a more car-oriented community. The space was large enough to comfortably fit a few people. The fully stocked kitchen was a plus. Our only complaint was that although the shower was big, the shower head was difficult to use as there was no hook for it. "
609610,45862065,2015-09-06,42435944,Bonnie,"Laura was a wonderful host, and made us feel very welcome.  She left a map of Seattle for us, a great supply of organic food for breakfast, and she was available to answer questions and generally make us feel at home.  She wonderfully anticipated all of our needs.  The suite was funky, eclectic and fully outfitted.  If was also in a fun neighbourhood, 15 minutes from downtown, with a grocery store only a block away.  My only regret is that we did not stay longer.  I also really appreciate Laura's focus on minimizing our ecological footprint through eco friendly products, and a focus on recycling."
609610,46042475,2015-09-07,27199696,Emma,Laura was such a joy! She has such a welcoming energy and her studio is so incredibly inviting. We felt so cozy for our short stay and thought their location was brilliant. We loved visiting neighborhoods she suggested and hearing about how she helped create the home she always wanted. I hope everyone gets a chance to stay with Laura!
609610,46329292,2015-09-09,31439090,Andrea,"My husband and I did not get a chance to meet Laura or her husband, but they had wonderful communication with us the entire time we were there. The apartment is roomy and has a private entrance. The kitchen is large, fully stocked and would be easy to make your own meals! My husband and I drove up the street a little bit and found a cute area with a lot of restaurants. We had a great dinner and stopped at the grocery store nearby to grab a bottle of wine. We had a nice time in the apartment drinking wine and playing games together. My only complaint would be that the walls are a little thin. We had a great stay though!"
609610,46647709,2015-09-12,28724309,Megan,This is a very charming and spacious apartment. It was very easy (15 minutes) to get to downtown Seattle. But the best part was the old town feel of nearby (1 mile away) Columbia City. A small-town-neighborhood near a large urban center--pretty ideal!
609610,46949815,2015-09-14,42545849,Demetrius,Our host made us feel very welcome.  They communicated with us to make sure we were ok.
609610,47391283,2015-09-18,16252650,Erin Grey,A great place to stay in Seattle. Plenty a room with thoughtful amenities. There's plenty of light and a great energy at this place. I would definitely stay here again. 
609610,47771048,2015-09-21,42717794,Peter,"The listing was very accurate to the place when we showed up. Clean, tidy and it felt like home when we walked in. Even though we didn't see the owner or the care taker as she was working, it was nice because we had our privacy."
609610,48906976,2015-09-29,42612645,Don,The description was very accurate and the neighborhood was very cool. Nothing I've ever been to before 
3811955,19175692,2014-09-07,5257167,Larissa,House was fantastic.  Beautiful views and they did a great job making sure the room and linens were clean.  Everyone was very friendly.  
3811955,20077088,2014-09-22,13358446,Robert,"staying here was a highlight of my seattle experience. . i met many interesting people in the ""crayola house"" and the host made me feel very welcome."
3811955,21725105,2014-10-22,11807724,Jack,"Amazing experience. Wasnt at the house much, but when i was everyone was friendly and kind. They had house gatherings and fun stuff going on. Highly recommend! :)"
3811955,22725204,2014-11-12,23440851,Jayne,"Love love love the Crayola House!!!!! Great house, even better people, very safe, and good location. As a single female traveling alone, not once did I feel uncomfortable here. Definitely recommend!!! Oh and sheets are super soft. "
3811955,25289072,2015-01-11,13951278,Joy,"Great communication before and during my stay. The dorm room and bed were comfortable and clean. Beds are first come first served, so a picture of a top vs bottom bunk in the listing may not correspond to the bed that you get. (very minor point, which did not detract from my stay!) The house is cozy but palatial in that there's plenty of common space in which to relax. Really a great value with the economy of hostel accommodation but the resources of a house. Best of all were the interesting, friendly people who I met during meals! I'll definitely stay at Crayola House when I'm back in Seattle."
3811955,26550896,2015-02-15,6420101,Ellie,"I had a great 2 months at the Crayola house. It's a friendly, welcoming place to stay, and despite there being a lot of people in the house it functions very smoothly. Leah is a wonderful host and goes out of her way to make sure every guest is well looked after. I would definitely recommend staying here! "
3811955,27231363,2015-02-28,7693924,Drew,Awesome as usual.  Such a great house! 
3811955,27819408,2015-03-12,22088336,Michael,nice quiet stay.  good location.
3811955,28184024,2015-03-19,28928489,Radhika,"We did not meet Michael but a long time resident gave us a tour of the house and told us everything we needed to know. The room was as described. The bathrooms were well-labeled with cleanliness protocols. The neighborhood was nice, with a great view of Seattle and Mt. Rainier.  The other residents in the house were welcoming and generous. They invited us to a Pi Day party and cooked dinner for everyone in the house. They suggested multiple things to do in Seattle and provided maps and bus routes.  It was very easy to communicate with Leah when we wanted to extend our stay by a few days. Overall we had a comfortable stay at the Crayola Home. "
3811955,28506974,2015-03-24,7693924,Drew,"Great as always!  Also, this was the first time I got to spend the weekend around the house and it was so much fun!  They organized an awesome bonefire/bbq for the whole house.  Such good people!"
3811955,30588809,2015-04-24,12958880,Vishal,"I stayed here for only 3 nights and I think it was not at par with the AirBNB experiences I had elsewhere. It is a big, dark and cold house with several rooms. The shared room had 8 bunk beds with weird curtains on them (I assume for privacy, but rooms get dark and uncomfortable). The coffee machine is very old and there are lots a lots of instructions on walls, for just about everything. On the other hand it is easy to get to using public transportation and has some great views of Mt. Rainier."
3811955,32660558,2015-05-19,33409194,Aditya,I had a quiet place to sleep for a couple of days. Everything was as advertised. I would gladly stay here again if needed.
3811955,34680274,2015-06-10,30678145,Ben,"I had an excellent stay at the 'Crayola House'. Leah was extremely helpful in responding to email and leaving instructions on tne house (it's huge, so they were necessary!). I enjoyed talking with the myriad guests that call the place home and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for cheap accomodation close to all the good stuff in Seattle."
3811955,41121226,2015-08-04,16910877,Jennifer,"My experience at the Crayola house was fun! I took up a bottom bunk in the corner which was covered with a sheet so it was like I had my own tiny little room. There are a lot of other travelers who stay here who are very kind too! The whole house had a bbq, movie night, etc. Made me wish I stayed a bit longer than the 4 days that I did. Access to bathrooms, the laundry room, and kitchen were all very convenient. There are directions for everything so it was easy to do what you had to do. The view from the living room was an added bonus! I could only imagine how it looks during the winter. Because the weather was really hot when I went, the rooms were a bit warm. But each bunk is equipped with a fan, as well as fans for the whole room so it was ok! "
3811955,41678419,2015-08-08,36383433,Chris,"Leah was filling in for Mike, and made sure to send very good directions and instructions. She also was very good about responding quickly and was very easy to deal with. Aside from a couple issues, I slept well and appreciated the stunning view and how large and clean the building seemed."
3811955,43417527,2015-08-19,40146898,Carly,The house was clean and organized. Leah was very easy to communicate with. I used the place as a place to sleep while I got to know Seattle so I never used the kitchen but it looked nice. Would highly recommend to any passing traveler. 
3811955,44365532,2015-08-25,7605708,Jian,"Hi 
i had very pleasant stay at the Crayola House.
I arrived on saturday and immediately received a tour in the House and was invited on the weekly bonfire.
The rooms were ok ..just shown as in the pictures. "

3193738,20740695,2014-10-05,2446528,Darren,"I stayed on the boat for the summer of 2014 and loved every minute of it. Amelia, Foxy, and Marissa were amazing hosts and even welcomed me with a birthday cake and extra decorations for the day I arrived. They provide a very detailed binder with all the info you need for living on a boat and the surrounding area. They were immediately responsive with any question I had and checked in regularly to ensure everything was going well with my stay. Which it was because I was living on a boat in Seattle for the summer :-) As indicated in the title, the Deck is huge and provides an amazing view. Perfect for morning coffee and lazy day on the hammock. The inside is very nicely decorated and very cozy. I loved sleeping in the lofted bed and the ever so slight movements of the boat lulled me to sleep nightly. I will stay here again as soon as I can. "
3193738,23435864,2014-12-01,14655122,Jessica,"The houseboat was very cute and charming with a well-equipped kitchen. No oven but there is a small convection oven/microwave. Excellent location near lots of shops and restaurants. Amelia was quick to address any questions and concerns. Houseboat life is definitely a change of pace! The bed area doesnt really stay warm, so we ended uo sleepubg in the futon which was really the only negative. Great experience overall, once in a lifetime.  I think it would be amazing in the spring and summer. But still beautiful views of the lake and the city. "
9236961,55292032,2015-11-29,22066101,Jason,the room was completely clean. I liked the apt a lot. The owner will not present at any time. 
7760836,45998529,2015-09-07,20960625,Alexandra,Jenell was a great hostess! She showed me the place and let me be. She was available if I needed anything and very accomodating to me as I was on business. If I came to Seattle again I would use the airbnb 100%
7760836,46979103,2015-09-14,43320982,Esteban,"Jenelle is a wonderful hostess. Everything was as described on the profile page for her unit. The location is incredible for someone who's brand to Seattle, easy access to most tourist attractions and lots of things are within walking distance just like she described. Unit is really cozy and nicely decorated with an incredible massage chair that we absolutely loved!

Jenell was very accommodating and was quick to reply to our requests and questions. I would 100% recommend her and would definitely consider using her unit again even for my regular business trips to Seattle. We had access to absolutely everything we needed and we couldn't have asked for a better experience."
7760836,53269952,2015-11-07,12571855,Ellen,"Jenell was timely in response if I had questions, and she checked in with me to make sure I had everything I needed. She also received feedback very well. The apartment was just as described. It is in a perfect location with access to restaurants, waterfront parks, and downtown. It is also situated on a major bus lines so you can get to just about anywhere. "
7760836,54946879,2015-11-25,7380426,Jessica,"Very comfortable, just like being in my own home!  The bed is super comfortable with soft, quality linens. Location is great! There's a grocery store downstairs with a decent wine/beer selection and the apartment has the easiest wine opener I've used in my life (game changer)! The apartment is equipped with toiletries, extra bedding, cleaning supplies.  And I can't forget how friendly and hospitable Jenell is!  "
7760836,55751679,2015-12-05,49913028,Jared,"This was my first time using AirBNB and Jen really made it an easy and smooth experience! She was able to help us with our odd check-in and check-out times with flexibility which was a big help. She also checked in with us multiple times throughout the trip to make sure everything was going well. She was a great host! The listing was equipped with everything just as described. Great neighborhood and location with great walking distance to everything we had planned (concert, markets, restaurants and bars). Great spot to stay! 4 1/2 Stars"
7760836,56619724,2015-12-15,814978,Daniel,Had a great experience! Great location.
7902137,43207823,2015-08-17,41573327,Ignacio,"I had not planned my first few days in Seattle very well, so it was  10:30pm on a Sunday night, with no place to stay. I took a look online and found Matt's place. Matt took me in on such a short-notice and I really appreciated it. I later found out that I was their first guest and additionally, that he had agreed to take me in a day earlier than his anticipated opening. Matt was very friendly and wanted to ensure my stay was great. It was awesome!

The room the was very clean, the bed was nicely bed, and I kind of slept 10 hours that night. Obviously the bed was comfortable :)  What I really did like was that there was a separate door connecting the room to the bathroom, and if you're like me and wake up in the middle of the night, it was very convenient. 

In the morning, Matt offered very kindly to make me breakfast, but I declined as I had slept far more than I had planned and it was close to noon at the time.  I did however try some of the Tunisian candy they had just gotten. We said our good-byes and I walked to downtown (under 10 minutes).

I would definitely stay here again as Matt was very welcoming, the place was very clean, and the location was central to downtown and capitol hill. Absolutely perfect!

 "
7902137,43587986,2015-08-20,23676152,Hilary,"Matt was very enthusiastic，the room was really great. We like this place, if we went to Seattle again we will live here again."
7902137,44053352,2015-08-23,32499509,Angela,"Great location within walking distance to downtown, lots of great food and places to go out at night. Bed was very comfortable. Matt was very nice and welcoming. He made a good effort to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. He even took the time to show us around town. We would definitely stay again on a future trip.  "
7902137,44271782,2015-08-24,22099249,Vaidehi,"Matthew was wonderfully friendly and helpful! He was kind enough to make us a delicious breakfast before we headed out as well. The room was very comfortable and clean, and the location was fantastic. "
7902137,44494580,2015-08-26,41087941,Stefan,"Matt's place is very well located, footsteps away from downtown. He was very welcoming and helped me to find my way around in Seattle and the U.S. in general. I stayed for two nights, and both evenings he invited me to a delicious dinner (though I guess you can't count on that :-)). The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, especially the almost new bed sheets are very comfy."
7902137,44622738,2015-08-27,42438191,Ning,"Nice room, clean & near to the downtown. Matthew is very helpful, he provide us a lot information of Seattle. Good!"
7902137,45317211,2015-09-01,41744058,Joshua,Matthew was a very accomadating and friendly host. Respectful if privacy was needed. Enough space in the room for luggage and 2 people. Everything was in working condition. Overall a pleasant stay.
7902137,45530296,2015-09-03,5431303,Greg,Great location. Comfy bed. Plenty of bagels and muffins for a quick breakfast.
7902137,46017702,2015-09-07,15125918,Esha,"The apartment was in a fantastic location next to a lot of really good restaurants and bars in a  happening neighborhood, Capital Hill. The apartment was still very quiet at night and had a comfortable atmosphere inside. Matthew was very accommodating in sharing food, utensils, toiletries, advice. "
7902137,46456349,2015-09-10,43632646,Michael,We enjoyed our stay very much. Matthew was very friendly and accommodating to special needs. Free breakfast was a bonus. 
7902137,46772790,2015-09-13,14370445,Fanie,"Matthew is a great host, very welcoming and enthusiastic. He has a lot of good tips on the neighborhood and recomemded us a long list of great restaurants. The appartment is well located, in Capitol Hill and 20 min away walking from the Pike market. 
We definitely felt at home and would come back again without any hesitation :)!!"
7902137,47080124,2015-09-15,41940988,Rohan,"Matthew was an excellent host. He is very friendly and made me and my brother feel welcome into his apartment. He also provided snacks and even offered to make breakfast, which was very thoughtful. The room itself was great. Bed was very comfortable. If you're looking for a place to stay in Seattle, definitely come here!"
7902137,47334124,2015-09-17,44127563,Matthew,"With this being my first AirBnB experience, Matthew has set the bar very high for my future AirBnB hosts:  the location, the close proximity to public transit and local landmarks, the room itself - including its price - all made my 3 day/2 night stay one of the most relaxing vacations I've taken in awhile.  His recommendations were spot-on, his directions were clear and precise, and his flexibility was most appreciated as a traveler new to the Seattle area.  If I ever had a question, he was only a text away.  (An added bonus is definitely Matthew's cooking...definitely do NOT skip breakfast if he offers to cook for you!)

Definitely will be back...hopefully sooner rather than later."
7902137,49123576,2015-10-01,29900077,Joonhwan,"I stayed 10 days in this room. Matthew, the host, was mostly on a travel during my stay. He was very hospitable and ready to listen to my concerns willingly. Without his presence, it was basically a private unit for us, which was a plus side for us. 

The location of the site is also great. It is on an edge of the Capitol hill with convenient access to downtown and SLU as well as Capitol hill.

Overall, I highly recommend this place for a short stay in Seattle."
7902137,49399905,2015-10-03,23012466,Bryan,"One of the best Airbnb experiences I've had (and I'm pretty picky). Matt was a very accommodating host, ensuring I was well taken care of throughout my stay. Even though I didn't get to meet him in person (he was out of town so I had the entire place to myself), he was very responsive on texts. I would definitively stay here again the next time I visit Seattle. "
7902137,49799213,2015-10-06,10257887,David,"Matthew is everything you could ask for in an airbnb host and more. His apartment is within walking distance to lots of great bars and restaurants. If it’s not walkable, the bus stop is close by at the corner to take you right into downtown. Some places nearby that I enjoyed were pie bar, taylor’s shellfish farm, and unicorn bar. The bed was comfy enough for me to sleep like a bear for 8 hours and the bathroom was easily accessed. Be mindful of your hair because the tub wouldn’t drain from being clogged by the previous guests. Other than that, the room was clean and cozy. On the last day of our stay, Matthew was kind enough to pick us up from Kerry Park and take us to Paseo for some amazinggggg cuban sandwiches. He’s very knowledgable about the Seattle and told us a lot of cool stories. Later, he was kind enough to drive us to the train station so we wouldn’t have to stress about being late to our flight. He definitely goes above and beyond for his guests. I would definitely recommend this place because the host will make you feel right at home."
7902137,50526003,2015-10-12,32868105,Mei Mei,"The room is comfortable and nice exactly the same as in the photo. It also is a very convenience place, 30 seconds to the City Market which is a small store, and 1 min to bus stop No.43 and 47 both are to downtown. Pubs and restaurants are just nearby. I had a great stay with Matthew and he is a very kind and thoughtful guy, he asked me if I have any idea to improve his room in order to get PERFECT! :) and he really took my advises and take actions!! AMAZING!!"
7902137,50735898,2015-10-13,11373184,Evan,I had a great stay at Matt's apartment.  It was very conveniently located to restaurants and bars.  The room was very clean and organized.  Matt even had breakfast foods for the morning.  I'll definitely be staying here again in the future!
7902137,50757493,2015-10-14,40130687,Andrew,Great hospitality. Great location and an extremely comfy bed. Would recommend to family and friends traveling to Seattle. 
7902137,50993003,2015-10-16,38510593,Edgar,I was in Seattle two nights on business and I picked Matthew's place based on location. I was able to walk around to everything I wanted to see. Matt was an awesome host with great recommendations and even joined us for drinks on the final night. Loved the breakfast in the morning. Comfortable bed and space. The free parking was a great perk too. Can't say enough good things. I would totally come back!
7902137,51364150,2015-10-19,45854380,Tony,"The place lives up to its title! The location is unassailable -- it's just a few blocks to the downtown business district (and Pike Place and the ferries) and just a few blocks to the hipster district on Capitol Hill. The neighborhood is well-lit, active, and I always felt safe. No need for a car -- but you can walk downtown and rent one if you'd like.  

The room itself is clean and comfortable... a nice soft bed and the bathroom is conveniently next to it.  Luggage rack included! Matthew is an accommodating and engaging host, full of good pointers about where to go and what to see, and generous with breakfast (and even dinner) options. No wonder this place is always booked.

I heartily recommend this airbnb to anyone spending some time in Seattle. "
7902137,51479345,2015-10-20,17000116,Michael,"Matt was very welcoming- he even offered me some of his dinner. Friendly guy, great location, and comfy bed. "
7902137,51660056,2015-10-22,4474861,Kelly,"Matt was a very friendly and prepared host-I even got to pick out which kind of pillows I wanted to sleep on! His apartment is located in a great area--surrounded by plenty of restaurants, bars and coffee shops, and an easy 20 minute walk to the heart of downtown. Definitely recommend to someone looking for a place to stay in Seattle. "
7902137,51876619,2015-10-24,46590536,Srinivas,"There are some hosts who do an impeccable job of maintaining a fine place (excellent location, all amenities). And then they go a few steps further and make it a memorable experience with their helpful nature. Always available to solve your problems, offering suggestions and yes sharing interesting life stories. I would strongly recommend a stay at Matt's place."
7902137,52121068,2015-10-26,18985157,Suzanne,"What a dilemma! I don't want to give Matthew the glowing review he deserves because I want to be able to stay there on my return trips.
Matt has provided a very comfortable place. Everything about it is comfortable, relaxing, welcoming.
The location is perfect for anyone. For me it is ideal. 
Shops, stores, restaurants, bars are an easy walk. Cherry Street Coffee a block away makes the best satiny lattes. Pie Bar across the street is so good. Matt has lots of snacks available also.
( If Matt is cooking eat there! He's a creative and wonderful cook. )
So one couldn't ask for more with the place and the location.
And then there's Matt. He's a very caring, funny, interesting intelligent person. On top of that he truly wants your stay to be flawless. He's very knowledgeable about the Seattle. He has lots of printed information available also. He solicits and sincerely considers suggestions for even the slightest improvement. 
I can't imagine a better host exists!



Lots of snacks are available. "
7902137,52458090,2015-10-29,47273190,James,Awesome host and excellent location. Thanks so much for your hospitality and the free breakfast!
7902137,52878500,2015-11-02,18281578,Ben,Best place to stay in Seattle! This is what Airbnb is about. Thanks again.
7902137,53095380,2015-11-04,47824811,Chad,Matthew made my stay very comfortable and provided a very nice and clean environment.  The location was perfect and within walking distance to multiple coffee shops and restaurants.  This was my first AirBNB experience and I will have to admit... it was a very positive experience.  I will definitely stay with Matthew again on my return to Seattle.  
7902137,54058711,2015-11-15,48594551,Mazen,"Matthew truly understands the true spirit of airbnb. From his on point suggestions for nearly anything you could possibly want in the city, to the effort he puts it to make you feel welcome. Would definitely recommend. "
7902137,55037912,2015-11-27,16395548,Junyang,Very nice place and convenient.
7902137,55113610,2015-11-28,45048337,Seong Won,His apartment is very close to washington convention center so i was easy to find his place
7902137,55473344,2015-12-01,16395548,Junyang,"It was a great stay at Matt's apartment, besides Matt is very nice and warm to his guest and took me to try new restaurant around the area.
Definitely will recommend anyone that interested in staying in Seattle to Aibnb with Matt."
7902137,55830383,2015-12-06,19258568,Satoko,"From late night arrival to early morning departure, my schedule was packed, but Matt was very kind and understanding. He is very well-prepared to welcome guests, and despite my busy schedule, everything went so smoothly and comfortably. If you are traveling for a conference/work at the Washington State Convention Center and still want a feel of local life, homey comfort and kindness, I highly recommend Matt and his place. Thank you Matt for everything! I had a productive and fun stay. :) Look forward to returning for more! "
7902137,56306374,2015-12-12,41410477,Sybil,"
Could not find a more welcoming host at a better location. Walk everywhere, close to whatever you want to do and see in Seattle. 
Felt like being with family."
7902137,56536052,2015-12-14,40438463,Linda,"Matt was a superb host from beginning to end. He made us feel very welcomed. Although we barely saw Matt, he was a great communicator and offered tips on fun things to do and places to eat. We had a really nice stay, our bed was super comfortable, and location was great. His apartment is clean and welcoming.
"
7902137,57062623,2015-12-21,38715890,Wanqi,"This place is nice and clean, and everything we need. Walking distance to space needle (20min) and some other attractions. Mathew is a nice host too."
7902137,57231541,2015-12-23,37184423,Arabelle,Amazing whirl wind experience of Seattle. Matt went literally out of his way to make our stay special. Would highly recommend this place to stay. 
7902137,57490959,2015-12-26,6735917,Akasha & Prince,Matt was a super accommodating and engaging host. His place is inviting and the location couldn't be more central to literally everything you could want to do or see. We would most definitely stay there again. 
3891695,18447567,2014-08-26,15605108,Cassidy,We had a wonderful stay at this charming condo. Just a block away from Pike Place Market. Great water view. Check in and check out very easy. 
3891695,18635194,2014-08-29,16663338,Emilie,"Nice, new, accommodating and flexible! I booked this for my boss since he isn't very good at navigating the interwebz. 

He was happy with the location and availability to respond to questions or concerns as needed (no concerns though!)

Thank you!"
3891695,18837082,2014-09-01,2628436,Heather,"Great stay!  The location could not have been more perfect for wandering on foot, so we didn't even rent a car.  Stumbling distance from Pike's Place & Belltown.  The apartment was just as described - immaculate, modern and comfortable.  The lack of A/C wasn't a problem as the night air cooled things down plenty.  Miranda was super communicative throughout - from pre-visit info to check-in, even calling to see how things were going mid-stay.  Would definitely stay again!"
3891695,19098000,2014-09-06,20224150,Devina,"Miranda was a wonderful host! We weren't flying in until almost midnight that day, she was more then accommodating in meeting us late that evening to check in. The condo was very cute and centrally located, perfect for our short stay! "
3891695,19288938,2014-09-09,7964199,Mark,Our stay at Miranda's apartment was perfect! She was so accommodating to our schedule including checking out at 6:30 in the morning to catch a ferry to Victoria! The apartment is in a great location right near Pike Place Market. Wouldn't change a thing!
3891695,19553441,2014-09-14,20333505,Rupert,"Beautiful view of Elliot bay. Everything as described. Excellent location right next to pike place market, spent many mornings grabbing breakfast and exploring the neighborhood. I would highly recommend this over hotel accommodation. Plus, mike and Miranda were very wonderful hosts."
3891695,19803851,2014-09-18,18416431,Todd,"Great location, beautiful apartment and gracious host.  Would book again in a second."
3891695,19958153,2014-09-21,20739952,Matt,"Overall we were very satisfied with our stay here.  The location and views were great!   We enjoyed watching the ferries on the bay and walking access to the Aquarium, the Great Wheel, Pikes, Downtown and other locations.   We rented a car, but really didn't end up needing it and could have foregone the activities where we used it or taken alternative transportation; likely for less money than we spent on parking.

Miranda was helpful and responsive to additional requests we had during our stay and checked in with us through the duration to make sure we were satisfied.  I would stay here or in one of her other units again.

One critique is that 'sleeps three' is a bit ambitious for the space. The couch does not fold out so my son ended up sleeping on the floor next to the bed.  We made it work, but 3 adults would be a really tight fit."
3891695,20433153,2014-09-29,20290212,Rachel,"Miranda was very friendly and able to accommodate my early check in time! The space was very nice as well as location. Overall experience was amazing. Next time I visit Seattle, I will be looking forward to staying at any of her locations!"
3891695,20587379,2014-10-01,15164874,Carl,Miranda was a great host and apartment was in a good location!
3891695,21300230,2014-10-14,21351635,Nicolle,"This was our first experience with Airbnb, and Miranda and Michael made everything so enjoyable and easy. The apartment was beautiful and had the great view they promised, and it was very easy to walk down to Pike Place Market. Going anywhere else required a bit of an uphill trek, but it wasn't bad once you got used to it!
The few minor issues we had were very quickly and efficiently resolved by Miranda and Michael - and they were incredibly accessible as well!
Overall, a GREAT experience!!"
3891695,21499381,2014-10-18,842419,Ben,"Miranda was an excellent host, with the utmost attention to good customer service.  All of our special requests were met, and we had a great stay in her well-appointed apartment downtown."
3891695,22346695,2014-11-03,23056464,Nick,"Miranda was a fantastic host. The apartment had a nice view, very clean, and good location for downtown activities "
3891695,22602009,2014-11-10,18221689,Brian,"Miranda is nothing short of excellent! The property was accurately described and in the perfect location.  Click the ""instant book"" button  -- you won't regret it!"
3891695,23076537,2014-11-22,5436444,Suzanne,"I didn't get to meet Miranda because I got held up at the airport with baggage issues, but she was very accommodating in arranging the key exchange so I was still able to check into the apartment immediately upon arrival. The apartment has an amazing view, even better than the photos show. The kitchen had everything I needed for my week-long stay, and the smart TV works perfectly with my devices. This is a great location, walkable, very convenient for exploring Belltown, downtown, Pike's Place market, and the Elliot Bay trail."
3891695,23661133,2014-12-07,16901817,Anna,"Great experience! I always got responses to my messages within minutes. Directions were perfect and check-in and check-out quick and smooth.
The place is adorable, very comfortable. View is stunning!
Location is fantastic. Pike market is a block away, with lots of places to eat, and it's great to even just take a stroll. Walking distance from the Koolhaas library (wonderful), SAM, Olympic sculpture garden........
Seattle is really a great city. Highly recommended. 

Thank you so much!"
3891695,24421108,2014-12-28,20451331,Gerwin John,The best host ever. We were welcomed warmly and they just attended to us genially. The place is very clean and centrally-located.
3891695,26607700,2015-02-16,4858305,Robin,"The apartment was great, and the location couldn't be beat! Easy walk to Pike's market and great food (which is both good and bad because I gained 5 pounds in the 5 days I was there). Also, there was everything we needed in the kitchen to cook some of the wonderful fresh fish and food we found at the market.

We felt very warmly welcomed upon our arrival and appreciated the accommodation of a late night check-in. Miranda and Michael were great hosts. 

The only thing that was a little less than ideal was that the downstairs neighbors seemed to hear us walking around the apartment in the morning. We are early morning risers and would be up, showered and out of the apartment by 8am on most mornings. Once I knew the noise was bothering the folks underneath us, it made the stay a little less enjoyable as I was worried about tip-toeing around. Other than that, it was a wonderful apartment and stay. 

I would highly recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle.

3891695,28173941,2015-03-19,28111532,Michael,"Eve made us feel very welcome and even allowed us to check in 5 hours early. She left some snacks and a bottle of wine with a nice note. This apartment is in a perfect location for many attractions. Pike Place market is one block away, yet the apartment was quiet and had an amazing view. It was also in a very secure building. My wife and I walked everywhere we wanted to on our trip with no problem, including to and from King St. station, the Space Needle, and our favorite sushi joint in town.  "
3891695,28291549,2015-03-21,17433906,Jessica,"Eve was so great and the apartment was PERFECT! We were right near all of the places we wanted to see (Pike Place Market, The aquarium, and lots of shops). She accommodated our late arrival and left us a bottle of wine! The apartment was spotless and the bed was comfy. It was nice to have a place to do our laundry after a long drive/flight. If I come back to Seattle I will definitely stay here again. Thanks, Eve! "
3891695,28878660,2015-03-31,19619819,Cathy,"Incredible view, perfect location, just like the pictures.    Eve was a wonderful host.   Our flight was cancelled, and rescheduled flight came in much later.    Eve adjusted her schedule with no complaints.   When a traffic accident closed roads and prevented her from driving in to meet us, she Ran a full mile to meet us and get us into the apartment.     Eve was prompt in replying to our questions and gave us good recommendations for local restaurants and shops.      The apartment was very quiet with modern appliances.  There were two fans, and one window that could open, to reduce the heat as there is no air conditioning.    The location was perfect for us, within walking distance to most places we wanted to go, so we did not have to rent a car.    "
3891695,29714440,2015-04-11,30848108,Chris,"We really enjoyed our stay.  This location is perfect, a block or two from Pike Place Market.  View of the sound was amazing.  The apartment was clean and had a lot of amenities.  Eve went out of her way to make sure we were 100 percent happy and she always made herself easily accessible.  I would definitely recommend this place and will check there first on our next trip to Seattle."
3891695,30131741,2015-04-18,18069168,Sean,"The pictures on the website are true-to-life. Clean, well stocked and great view of the harbor. Sup location. Never had to get in a car for 4 days. Lots of great restaurants and great attractions nearby. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Hostess was punctual, courteous and friendly. Communication was excellent!"
3891695,30371461,2015-04-20,5887546,Perry,"After an incredibly positive recent Airbnb rental experience with Eve there was never a question who I was contacting when I needed another place to stay in Seattle for several nights.Once again any question or need was taken care of in a responsive manner by Eve. The location of this rental puts you right next to Pike's Place with great food, coffee, and shops sleepwalking distance away while somehow being super quiet considering how close it is to this energetic area. Great views of the water make it a cozy place to call your temporary home in Seattle. "
3891695,30696192,2015-04-26,29197011,李,The unit location is very good. Away pick market around 200 meters. There can get to every places only walk to. But apartment wall is vey thin.  The bed is small for our family. Eve is very nice. This is perfect vacation for our family. 
3891695,31739852,2015-05-09,2356845,Frank,"This well-appointed one-bedroom is perfectly located at Western and Lenora, steps from Pike Place and the waterfront.  Restaurants, bars and shops are all around.  The nice view of Alki Point and the Sound is an added plus.  Wi-Fi was fast and reliable.  The TV has Smart-TV with Netflix and other options, as well as some antenna channels.  The new pillowtop queen mattress makes for a good sleep.  Eve happily accommodated my early check-in.  Check-out was simply a matter of leaving the key and locking the door.  Eve was a gracious host, and I certainly would stay her flat in future visits to Seattle."
3891695,32906526,2015-05-23,23895324,Arnoud,"Great appartement in down town Seattle! We really enjoyed the view of the harbor and the fact that pike market is very close. The appartement itself was well furnished and comfortable, ample space to store your clothing, nice bathroom. Eve showed us the appartement and made us feel welcome, she was flexible whith the check in time preponing it a little to accomodate our early arrival time."
3891695,34962105,2015-06-14,24425157,Matt,Great apartment next to Pike Place with awesome views. Clean and modern. Eve was very helpful and always quick to respond on any questions. Great restaurant recommendations too. Definitely recommended. 
3891695,35295582,2015-06-17,30425886,Jared,"The apartment was great. It's a cozy, modern getaway high above the city streets, and the views of the water from the window were fantastic, particularly around sunset. Eve (the host) was good at communicating with us during our trip to make sure everything was going well, and she left a bottle of wine upon our arrival. We were in town for a conference at the convention center, and the walk to and fro was ~15min, which worked well and gave us some good exercise in the morning. It was so nice to have such a calming place to come back to, with a beautiful full kitchen where we cooked our meals. We certainly recommend this apartment! The only aspect that we weren't huge fans of was having to pretend to know Michael (Eve's partner?) personally, if we ran into anyone in the halls of the building. This made us feel like we were sneaking around at times -- hoping we didn't run into anyone so we wouldn't have to fib if they asked us who we were -- but that never happened and it wasn't a big deal. This seems pretty standard with most urban AirBnBs from what we've heard, just a heads-up for any first-timers reading this review. Another heads-up, the neighbor below apparently is a bit finicky with noise - we didn't have any trouble but if you like to make noise at night, maybe choose another place. All in all, we loved the apartment and had a lovely stay. Again, we would definitely recommend this place if you're visiting Seattle."
3891695,36376089,2015-06-28,30619187,Shiming,Great apartment and very nice host!
3891695,40123779,2015-07-28,277708,Cassie,"We loved our apartment in Seattle! It had such a wonderful view, and was centrally located to everything you want to do in Seattle.  We had everything we needed, they even left a bottle of wine for us!  Communication before and afterwards was perfect.  They even made arrangements to have us check in early, which we really appreciated because we had to drop off the rental car and we had a lot of bags that we didn't want to drag around downtown Seattle. We were able to walk almost everywhere, or Uber was always readily available if we needed to go more than a few miles. I highly recommend this property for your stay in Seattle!"
3891695,40381348,2015-07-30,2107034,Meytal,"The flat was exactly as expected, clean and comfortable with a beautiful view. Eve was easy to communicate with, very generous (gave me a bottle of wine to welcome me) and flexible on meeting up with me when I arrived to hand over keys and show me the flat.  The location is perfect. An easy walk to Belltown, Pike Place market, pioneer square and the waterfront.  I'd definitely stay here again!  Thanks Eve."
3891695,40900825,2015-08-03,32163023,Reed,"Awesome location, great view. Unit is as described."
3891695,41430737,2015-08-07,38440371,Siobhan,"We felt very welcomed at Pike's Place, and arrival went very smoothly.  We were given a bottle of wine and suggestions of where to go to get coffee, as it was late.  The apartment is beautiful, better than the photos.  The view is amazing, and the location is great.  We enjoyed going to the market for breakfast just a few blocks away.  The place was clean and airy, and we had good fans as it was a hot spell in Seattle.  We were very comfortable.  Everything was wonderful, and we intend to come back."
3891695,42146079,2015-08-11,36661937,Colleen,"This place was excellent, the view and location were unbelievable.  Close enough to walk everywhere, Pike Place market, shopping,waterfront and only about a mile down to the stadiums.  We were greeted out in front of the building to show us where to go.  Any questions we had were answered quickly.  
You definitely won't be disappointed."
3891695,42566323,2015-08-14,31309833,Jean,"From the minute I booked the apartment, Eve, Michael and Morgan were in touch with me on the details and they continued to be accessible throughout our stay, responding to questions usually within minutes.  The pace was beautiful, luxury high rise, great location down the street from Pike's Peak Market.  It really couldn't have been nicer and if we're back, will definitely stay.  They are true professionals and were helpful in helping me decide which place they have would suit our needs. So, while I can't imagine this place not suiting everyone's needs, if it doesn't, get in touch w/ them and they will be able to place you."
3891695,43271826,2015-08-18,38792430,Tina,Apartment was beautiful and clean with great views.  The location could not be better for exploring downtown!  
3891695,43816853,2015-08-22,43080,Gregg,Morgan was a terrific host and the apartment was great.
3891695,44755255,2015-08-29,27892959,Nancy,"The condo was even better than the pictures - a better view of the harbor, and a balcony.  It's right next to Pike's Place Market and just across the street from the Aquarium, harbor cruise boats, and restaurants.  Two blocks to the ferries and convenient walking distance to all of downtown.  We enjoyed watching the cargo ships and ferries coming and going in the harbor."
3891695,45286286,2015-09-01,22244087,Sinae,"We had an amazing stay.  The location was so convenient - just a few blocks from the harbor, Pike's Place, and the rest of the downtown.  The views from the apartment were spectacular - unobstructed views of the water and of all the ships coming and going from the harbor.  The apartment was very clean.  Morgan was an excellent host.  She was responsive to all my messages, and even went out of her way to meet us earlier than we had originally planned since we were able to get into the city earlier than we anticipated.  The next time we're in Seattle, we will definitely book here again! "
3891695,46136817,2015-09-08,24978305,Jamison,Great Location! Morgan & Michael are great host and very responsive.  Made it easy to get into the unit and helped me with an early check in. We didn't rent a car because everything we needed was short walk or $5 dollar Uber. The unit was very clean and had everything you could need. The view of the water and ferris wheel was great. I would definitely stay again!
3891695,47906761,2015-09-21,44334648,Nick,"Daniela's place was perfect for my weekend in Seattle.  Exactly as advertised - clean, comfortable, beautiful view, and within walking distance of the major attractions downtown.  You won't be disappointed!"
3891695,48139535,2015-09-23,44389522,Ron,"Daniela made my first experience with AirBnb a great one. The communication was great and she gave very clear instructions with the check-in process. The unit itself has a fantastic view if not PERFECT VIEW of the Seattle bay. The location is perfect within a few minute walk your in the middle of the action. All the tourist destinations, top restaurants, shopping, Pikes Place etc. You really can't beat the location. We walked for the most part, and one day rented a car @ Enterprise Rent-A-Car to do the Boeing Factory tour as well as other places that requires a car. Then return it to the downtown location and walked back. Don't need a car here, Uber is better and cheaper compare to renting a car / paying for parking. The Unit itself is very clean, Clean Towels, Clean Bed sheets, and in-unit laundry, full kitchen with clean kitchenware etc. Even when there was a small hick-up with the internet Daniela got on the phone with the internet company to fix the problem right away. Within a few minutes the internet worked again.  I would come back again. Like other people mentioned, the picture of the unit doesn't justify how beautiful the view actually is. Day or Night. "
3891695,48343873,2015-09-25,40697745,Patrick,Great.   Loved it
3891695,48770167,2015-09-28,26440787,Nate,Daniela did an excellent job making herself available and making sure our stay was as comfortable as possible. The unit is great - the view truly amazing. Would defiantly recommend to anyone looking for a great Seattle experience. 
3891695,49150535,2015-10-01,5357577,동현,The sunset view was truly fantastic! We truly enjoyed staying and would love to come back again. Perfect location to explore downtown Seattle.
3891695,49946032,2015-10-07,45365164,Jacqueline,My host provided great instructions on getting to the airbnb. The neighborhood is fantastic. I was literally walking distance to Pike's Market. 
3891695,51222710,2015-10-18,32426669,Catherine,"Daniela was very friendly and accommodating - she met us in front of the building and let us in though we checked in quite late. The unit was neat and tidy, just as pictured. The photos on the site, however, do not quite capture how great the view is! Awesome location for first time visitors to Seattle - you can walk most places."
3891695,55036540,2015-11-27,778243,Mark,"We had a great trip and loved this condo and location. While we ran into a couple of snags upon our arrival Jocelyn was available by phone and graciously remedied all problems promptly...quite late at night I must add since our flight was a bit delayed. Thanks Jocelyn! This place was awesome in all aspects...high floor, nice view, quiet, nice kitchen with everything you'll need, perfect location, amenities, centrally located, near the major transportation, museum, car rentals, Pikes, restaurants (one next door Von's 1000 Spirits is great! Try the pasta!), gym, sauna, pool (in other building), dishwasher, fridge, washer, dryer, etc. Wonderful trip will be back! Thanks!
"
3891695,55856296,2015-12-06,49931038,Tara,"I had the most amazing time at your apartment. Everything was better than described and the views were phenomenal. It made my first real experience a great one and I plan on renting this unit again. Check in and check out was also easy, which made the experience that much more enjoyable. "
3891695,56856906,2015-12-19,30899944,Sean,"The place was fantastic.  They left me a bottle of wine, and the view was stunning.  On top of that, Lecosho, one of my favorite restaurants I've ever been to, is right at the bottom of the building.  I don't think the location could be any better.  Everything about this experience was wonderful."
7071331,37417821,2015-07-06,36639583,Ramona,"The room is nice, the house is in a good neighborhood, and the hosts are easygoing. "
7071331,38193406,2015-07-13,37064458,Xuong,"Danielle stayed in contact throughout our visit to the house.  She really helped by answering our questions and concerns about our late evening arrival and made sure we had access inside.  We were glad she had set up an air mattress for our 2 boys to stay in the living the first night.  The next 2 nights we had our boys join us in our bedroom.

Danielle was a very caring and easy-going host and especially understanding of our boys' playfulness at times.  Her home was kid friendly which made sense since her 3 year old was also there on some days.  

Overall, the location of the house was very close (about a block walking) to a Metro Bus ride (about 30 minutes long) into Seattle.  This was a great way to sightsee without the hassle of driving through traffic and expense of parking.  Certainly Danielle also made the effort to accommodate our family's needs in the cozy space especially with all of us sharing a bathroom.

The accommodations were adequate for the price. Positives include: parking space in front of the house, access to washer/dryer & kitchen, safe clean environment for kids, pet free for those allergic to animals, and fairly quiet neighborhood setting.  

Things that could be improved include: 
Noisy doors when closing or opening and door knobs that were noisy when turned.

"
7071331,38649887,2015-07-17,12630167,Diana,"Danielle is a very friendly host, who was welcoming and nice.
The room has everything you need.
Good safe neighbourhood. Good distance to Seattle downtown if you drive by car.
We had a good time and would recommend Danielles room!
Thanks"
7071331,39113126,2015-07-20,15948633,Samantha,"My stay at Danielle's was perfect. I did not get to meet her, but she did well giving me updates and providing all the information I needed for check-in. The room was as pictured and very clean, there was plenty of parking, and the home is near a gas station and a Fred Meyer. I would stay here again!"
7071331,40250992,2015-07-29,32153718,Jim,Absolutely amazing time at Danielle's place. Lots to see and do within a one mile radius. She was more than accommodating!
7071331,41262396,2015-08-05,26721805,Baptiste,"Danielle's place is very perfect on many different levels !
The house is very close to north cool neighboorhoods, her place is quiet and calm with some space to park easily.

The house is perfectly clean and tidy, our bed was confortable and the room very cool.

Danielle is very discreet and busy with work so we don't saw each other a lot but she was very friendly and totally (and quickly) available for all questions or to make feel ourselves confortable.

I highly recommend !"
7071331,41661661,2015-08-08,38604631,Lindsay,"It was a pleasure to stay with Danielle during my short trip to Portland. Her apartment was clean and matched the description. She was very friendly and available to chat with us about our itinerary. Although we did not take advantage, she also made it clear that her kitchen was free for us to use as we pleased. Danielle was at her home to let us in for check-in and coordinating check-out was fast and easy. "
7071331,42158400,2015-08-11,30983040,Naomi,"Danielle was away during our stay, but we had everything we needed. The neighbourhood is quiet with a nice brew shop within walking distance."
7071331,42489367,2015-08-13,39981912,Sean,"Staying with Danielle was great! The room was comfortable and clean, and she was very kind and understanding when we booked last minute and arrived a little late, made sure we could get in and had everything ready. Would definitely stay again, thanks!"
7071331,44374750,2015-08-25,13376464,Katie,"Danielle is an amazing host! We stayed with her when we moved to Seattle from the midwest, while we looked for an apartment, and she gave us some great advice about the neighborhoods and fun places to visit. She was so welcoming and fun to chat with at the end of the day, but also gave us our space and was very considerate that we were exhausted from our trip at times. We were so lucky to have a chance to stay with her!"
7071331,45340167,2015-09-01,42524325,Lindsay,"Check-in was easy; Danielle was welcoming, friendly and helpful. The room was cute, clean, and as described. Great quiet neighbourhood a short drive from downtown. Would stay again."
7071331,45635951,2015-09-04,25402613,Tim,"I got to stay with Danielle for a number of days. She's sweet as can be and made sure everything was in order well before I arrived. She is a busybody, but puts hosting you on top.

There were quick replies before, during, and after my stay. The house is in a small quiet neighborhood with parking right outside the house. The room and bed are clean, towels provided, bathroom and shower access right outside your door.

Very easy location to get to, bus routes were close by.

Book this! You won't be disappointed!"
7071331,45911363,2015-09-06,39666906,Tess,our stay was short and sweet! danielle let us stay super last minute and was very accommodating! house is cute and only about 20 minutes from the city! thanks again danielle!!
7071331,47543574,2015-09-20,42996323,Anna,"We enjoyed our stay with Danielle and her son! Her house was tidy and toddler friendly, which was perfect for our fourteen month old daughter. Her dog was sweet and kid friendly, and unobtrusive. We felt safe walking around the neighborhood to the park and nearby bus stops. There is a nice coffee shop in walking distance, as well as a Safeway, gas station, bar (21 and over only), and bus stops. Danielle was not home when we arrived, but she had communicated with us before-hand and provided a hidden key. She responded promptly to our texts when we were planning our stay. We would stay with her in the future, and recommend her place as a simple and cozy resting place."
7071331,48818973,2015-09-28,44025081,Boris,"Danielle was welcoming, friendly and helpful. The room was clean and as described. Nice quiet neighbourhood. The busstation is just around the corner - perfect! Everything was fine! We would definitely stay again, thanks!"

7071331,49865777,2015-10-06,20952899,Jack,Nice quiet neighbourhood. Room was comfortable and clean.
7071331,50117248,2015-10-09,22642249,Dan,Comfortable room in a family house. We didn't see a lot of Danielle during our brief stay but she made it clear that we could make ourselves feel at home. Check in/out was straightforward and public transport into the city leaves from the next block. 
7071331,52630865,2015-10-31,33779243,Siserra,"Perfect in every way. I moved to Seattle from out of state and stayed with Danielle for two weeks while starting my new job and apartment hunting. I couldn't have picked a better place or hostess!
Location: safe and friendly neighborhood. A ten min drive to Ballard and other fun spots - I work in Everett and it was just a 30 min drive to and from work. Just a couple minutes walk to cute cafes and Chucks Hop Shop. I had my own parking space and left my bikes outside without any worries. The room faces the backyard, so there aren't random strangers walking past the window. 
The space: sooo cozy! Charming and very open, hardwood floors and lots of closet space in the bedroom. The string lights, instruments and little trinkets all enhanced the cheerful vibe of the place. Clean but lived in and homey, shower pressure was awesome, great book selection.
The hostess: Danielle is a pretty amazing human being. She is super genuine, warm, mellow and hilarious. She had great suggestions and advice about my Seattle exploits and welcomed me along on adventures of her own. She is down to earth and intelligent - getting to know her is good for the soul! Hands down my favorite Air B&B experience. :)"
7071331,53544546,2015-11-09,23231673,Iris,The room was nice and clean. We enjoyed our stay with Danielle! 
7071331,54361924,2015-11-18,4873409,Ryan,"Danielle and her son were great hosts. They both did their best to make us feel at home :) The shower broke the day we arrived, which Danielle told us ahead of time and she arranged for my wife to use the shower of the lady who lives in the downstairs apartment. There was a friendly dog visiting, too. "
7071331,56234134,2015-12-10,50280260,Sherri,The host canceled this reservation 13 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7024684,50749164,2015-10-14,39871758,Russell,"We had a great time in this wonderfully charming remodeled home overlooking Seattle in the historic Capitol Hill area. It's easy to get about either on local streets or I5. Perfect location.

Manuals for the house are everywhere."

7024684,52046807,2015-10-26,35674114,Rebecca,Jonathan and Tamaras house was amazing! It was even more beautiful in person! They provided a guid to the area and responded to my questions quickly.  I didn't want to leave!
7024684,52836479,2015-11-02,16142009,Clark,"Great communication throughout!  The house was spotless, well-located, and even better than advertised.  We would definitely stay there again.  Not an iota of negative feedback from us!"
7024684,53496211,2015-11-09,13008640,Kimmy,"My group of 6 had a fantastic experience in this beautiful home!  We were in town for a weekend and were a part of a nearby show.  We were all so impressed with the space, we each had our own room and total privacy to wind down each night after long days.  We used Uber and Lyft to get around, and everything was about a 10 minute car ride from the house.  All of us agreed that we would definitely stay here again, we had no issues with the house at all and Jonathan and Tamara had everything prepared and were very helpful.  Thank you for the wonderful weekend!"
7024684,54144781,2015-11-16,47184254,Jonathan,"The house was huge and beautiful, and in a great neighborhood. If anything, the listing undersells it. Definitely a great place to stay in Seattle."
8884826,56231817,2015-12-10,50747235,Jay,"Had a great stay! The description of the home is accurate, it's modern, very clean and comfortable. The house is in the Central neighborhood which is a historic residential area near downtown..found many interesting stores and restaurants conveniently nearby in Capitol Hill and there's a nice park and coffee shop a block away. Good communication with hosts and they gave helpful tips what to see and do in town. Thanks, would love to visit again!"
8884826,56648515,2015-12-15,38644015,Karen And Jerry,We loved staying at Ken and Layna's lovely townhouse in Seattle. It was beautifully appointed and spotlessly clean. We would love to come back and stay again at the townhouse and experience another season in Seattle. It was close to downtown and there were plenty of cute coffee shops and parks within walking distance which we loved. Ken and Layna were very prompt in communication and we would highly recommend staying at this property.
8884826,57820245,2015-12-29,43456690,Zoei,"Although we were not able to meet Ken and Layna in person as they were overseas, they were still quick to respond to all of our questions. They had someone else help us check in, so the check in went by very smoothly. The house is homey, and the fireplace was very well appreciated especially on cold rainy days. Place was newly renovated and overall is just in a really really great condition. Would most definitely come back again if I were to drop by Seattle again! 
Thank you Ken and Layna! "
6807884,35436403,2015-06-18,7900395,Louie,"This is my third time staying at one of Eve's properties and the experience is always first class.  Eve's hospitality is great, so much in fact, I'm coming back next week!"
6807884,36052250,2015-06-24,35605738,Rosemary,"There are few words to describe how unbelievably happy I am to have chosen Eve and Micheal to host our stay in Capital Hill, Seattle, WA. 
I had been searching for days for places near downtown Seattle, but we were traveling during a very busy week (golf tournament) and the accommodation availability was scarce. Also, I had sent several requests along with my questions, (without payment, I may add) to other hosts, but many never responded and others answered days later with a negative response. So I thought I may have not been taken seriously because of my lack of commitment, so I did what I normally would never have done. I paid in advance. As soon as my transaction went through for Eve and Mike's place, I received a phone call from Eve. She was incredibly informative and sounded so eager to provide me with answers to any AirB&B questions as well. In other words, to say she was great is an understatement. The studio apartment was wonderful, newly remodeled, clean and very spacious, with washer and dryer, iron and iron board which were all very important since we travel very light. There was also a Plasma TV with Netflix, Hulu, Yahoo News, etc. which we ended up using once in our 6 day stay. They also had Wifi that worked very well for us. The location was perfect, Capital Hill is the best kept secret. My husband and I had one of the most exceptional culinary experiences in this foodie paradise. "
6807884,36644148,2015-06-29,3812822,Monica,Great place to stay - would def stay again! 
6807884,36919287,2015-07-02,7900395,Louie,Eve is a great host that will go the extra mile for you.  She knew that I preferred cool temperatures and went out to go get me a fan for the room.  Great hospitality!
6807884,37800228,2015-07-10,1809814,Ted,"Had a great stay! Central, clean, and Eve was very helpful and receptive to requests. I'll be staying with them again if I'm able."
6807884,38181947,2015-07-13,21787396,Blanche, We enjoyed our stay in Capitol Hill. Our unit was very clean and tidy. Eve was great at helping us with our needs. We will definitely come back. 
6807884,38547682,2015-07-16,23968597,Shawn,Alex and Michael's apartment in Capital Hill was great! Great communication during the booking process and leading up to check in. Alex even checked in with me during my stay to see if I needed anything. The space was great and clean and the building new and modern in the heart of Capital Hill within walking distance to everything. I highly recommend this apartment and I look forward to staying here again! Thanks Alex! 
6807884,38736833,2015-07-18,3831866,Kristen,Great apartment in the perfect location for our visit.  Couldn't have asked for more!
6807884,39538978,2015-07-24,22092940,Kristine,"This place was exactly what I needed for my stay. I needed a place for 5 days for a business trip, and thankfully I found this gem.

Prearrival: when I booked my reservation, Eve sent me the most throughout list of instructions on of the location, amenities, check in, and check out. I knew what to expect going in. 

Arrival: before hand I let Eve know of my time range for checking in (6:30pm-7pm Monday) She greeted me outside and escorted me to the apartment. 

Actual apartment: I honestly wish it was my place. It was clean and simple and have everything in the pictures except for the couch. I just someone broke the old couch so she got it replaced, so at least I got a new couch! She took pictures before my arrival so she can post updated ones on Airbnb. 

Note that most places in Seattle do not have A/C, so on a summer day it can get a little hot, but that's expected anywhere. Also this location is by the freeway so you Can get residual noise from the streets, but if you close the windows, it's not an issue at all. 

Everything worked great! I washed my clothes and took comfortable showers in the bathroom and watched Netflix when I wanted to wind down. The blinds next to the TV got stuck at the top, but I didn't mind, I let Eve know and she was willing to come by and fix it. But since I wasn't home most of the day and it wasn't much of a nuisance, I didn't have her come by. 

Definitely take advantage of the rooftop views and the location on Capitol Hill! 

Overall: I would definitely stay at this place again! The location, price, and amenities was perfect, and Eve's communication throughout my stay was superb. Thank you again! "
6807884,39952189,2015-07-27,5612574,Stephanie,"Eve and Michael's place accurately depicted in the pictures. It was very clean, comfortable, and in a great location. Eve checked in with me regularly to make sure we got in and that we were enjoying our stay. Make sure to read the instructions and house rules carefully, as there is a lot of information (house rules, etc.). 

I have no complaints, and I would stay there again. "
6807884,41383164,2015-08-07,36535553,Paige,"We had a great time staying here! Morgan was the host that helped us while we were there to make it a great experience.

I arrived with my boss for a conference. The location was great because there were coffee shops and restaurants right there and it was a pleasant easy walk to the Convention Center where the conference was being held.

Morgan met us with newly-purchased pillow and sheets for the surprisingly comfortable air mattress I had requested since my boss and I don't share beds :)

The apartment was immaculately clean, well-equipped, and comfortable. It was bright and breezy.

Morgan arrived with just one set of keys when she met us, and since we had different work schedules, we really needed to come and go independently so were a bit worried. My boss was also nervous about being hot (Seattle was in an unusual heat wave and, typical of Pacific NW apartments, there's no AC) because she has an illness which makes her heat-sensitive.

When we told Morgan about our concerns, she was super nice and understanding. We texted and worked out a solution, and when I returned to the apartment she had left us an additional box fan, extra key, and a surprise bottle of wine!

Thank you for hosting us. We had a perfect experience."
6807884,41769697,2015-08-09,14050870,Amy,"The rental was fantastic. Very new and great for 2-3 people. The location is really great. It sits right on the edge of Capitol Hill and is only a short walk to downtown. The immediate area is awesome. Half a block (maybe less) to Starbucks Tasting Room, shops, and really great restaurants include Sitka and Spruce which is right across the street. I would definitely stay here again. "
6807884,42860099,2015-08-16,30384420,Scott,"The place was great, we couldn't have picked a better spot for visiting Seattle for the first time. It was located in one of the coolest parts in town, and centrally located to everything.  The only thing better than the spot was Morgan. She was super accommodating when our flights got in late, checked in on us during our stay and give her local recommendations. She also provided us with an inflatable bed, to accommodate the 3 of us. I highly recommend looking into one of her spots before you travel to Seattle.    "
6807884,44010786,2015-08-23,13111411,Erica,"It was a perfect location! We walked everywhere. We were able to eat dinner and go out right by the apartment, and three people using the space to sleep didn't feel too crowded. Morgan was flexible with my check-in time and very quick to respond. One of the rules about the use of the building through Airbnb felt a little aggressive, but I'd consider staying here again on my next trip to Seattle! "
6807884,45251411,2015-09-01,34312382,Michael,"Had a great time at this apartment! Everything is within walking distance, so many restaurant options and a great little neighborhood. The freeway can be loud, especially at night, but closing all the windows makes for nice city ambience."
6807884,46217235,2015-09-08,42786824,Silvia,"Miranda contacted us promptly and the arrangements to gain entry to the apartment were easy and painless. The apartment is in a fantastic location; close to restaurants and bars and we were able to walk to most places. The apartment was clean, well laid out and had spectacular views. We were a little disappointed that this was more of a studio and the bedroom was not enclosed, but we we able to make the space work for the three of us. Great place overall and I would definitely stay here on a return trip! "
8132007,46650072,2015-09-12,15973925,Daniel,"Host made us feel welcome, we rented the top half of the cottage for a week.  It was a private unit so we dint see much of each other but it was a beautiful location and the area has lots of places to eat.   Kitchen was well stocked with dishes and pots and pans.    Right next to the beach, on the water taxi busline which was nice.  I would definitely rent this place again in the future rather than a hotel room.  If your looking for a place on the beach, this is a pretty good choice and a fair price."
8132007,47526657,2015-09-20,5804106,Jonna,"We loved our stay in West Seattle. So easy to get to and from the city where my son lives. Sandra greeted us with a huge smile and a wonderful home to set up in. The photos are realistic and the beach was absolutely wonderful. We enjoyed many a sunrise and sunset there. The basics: There was room for two cars in the back of the house, kitchen: more than enough room and supplies, 1 and 1/2 bathrooms--great. Shower is in the clawfoot tub and a bit short for the men in my family but manageable. I am looking forward to heading out to Seattle again soon and would definitely hope that Sandra's cottage would be available."
8132007,48919596,2015-09-29,43382764,Kelly,"I had a wonderful time during my stay on Alki and in Seattle. Sandra is very nice and was very accommodating especially when I had to change my reservation dates less than a week before arrival. The cottage is very cute and quaint and in a perfect location within walking distance of restaurants, public transportation to downtown Seattle and just across the street from the beach and fabulous views. The cottage was clean and stocked with everything I needed including some toiletries and even water and coffee. I would definitely stay here again the next time I visit. "
8132007,50125340,2015-10-09,45385170,Bryan,"Sandra is great and so is this house!  My folks were in town for a week, and since we live in West Seattle this was absolutely perfect.  It's a  lovely home,  in a quiet neighborhood by Alki beach, who could ask for more? They loved it, and I thank you for your hospitality!"
8132007,50485782,2015-10-12,18775532,Kelly,"Sandra was very welcoming and accommodating. The unit was just as described. The location was perfect, in a nice, quiet neighborhood, but only 1/2 a block from the beach and two blocks walk to good restaurants. The dedicated parking spot was great, but there was plenty of on street parking as well. The kitchen was well stocked and the furnishings were modern and comfortable. It has cozy beach cottage feel. I would definitely stay here again!"
8132007,50809113,2015-10-14,21331270,Paula,Sandra really tried to meet us and make us feel welcome.  Our tight schedule made that difficult.   She was still very accommodating.  She left us water in the fridge and some chocolates.  She left us notes for dining and hiking recommendations.  The house is really cute.  Its a few steps from the Alki beach.  From the porch and front room you can see the water.  The neighborhood is pretty quiet and peaceful.  Its walking distance to a number of restaurants.  I would stay here again.
8132007,52085023,2015-10-26,44383994,Ruben,Out host went out of her way to welcome us as she waited for our arrival.  The area was very nice with the beach very nearby as advertised.  The building is older but neatly renovated.  The stay met our expectations just as she advertised.  Communication was outstanding.  An overall positive experience.
8132007,54005601,2015-11-15,19737189,Dan,Sandra's beach home was perfect for our two week visit and we would most certainly try to book this place again
8132007,55370147,2015-12-01,2797121,Michele,"I stayed at Sandra's home with my family (3 twenty somethings) during Thanksgiving weekend.  I live in Seattle, but could not accommodate my out of town guests  in my own residence. The home was exactly as described and pictured.  It was perfect for our needs.  We arrived late Thursday night after cooking and eating dinner at my home.  We spent the next day just hanging out all day long in the house with 3 additional family members.  There was plenty of space for rest, reading, conversation, eating, and even doing some homework.  We especially loved the large living /dining room area, and the the separate sitting areas off of the main bedroom as well as in the entryway. We also really appreciated 1 and a quarter bathrooms. The house is decorated tastefully and definitely has good energy.  On Saturday we ventured out and enjoyed walking along Alki Beach; just a block away. Some of my group sat outside for a bit on the front porch with a view of the water. West Seattle is a great location because it has a feeling of being slightly removed from the mainland yet all of Seattle is literally a hop, skip, and a jump away. Saturday night we drove to Pike Place Market; also just a 10 or 15 minute drive.  Sandra was extremely friendly, welcoming, and responsive to all of my questions and needs.  I asked for a DVD player before we arrived and she provided that on schedule.  We had a fabulous time.  I highly recommend Sandra's place.  It was the perfect stay-cation for my family."
8132007,56380029,2015-12-13,34390207,D J,"Sandra's beach cottage was exactly what we needed, and exactly as described. We spent almost a full week in Alki, and the beach cottage was the perfect landing place. We were a party of three, and there was plenty of space. Sandra was fantastic, and was very flexible in allowing an early check-in and late check-out to better accommodate our arrival/departure schedule. Thanks Sandra!"
9823290,56225772,2015-12-10,13392445,Jeanne,"This was exceptionally clean and well appointed room - everything i needed was available.  Convenient to downtown and my work in Renton, without having to get on the highway.
Janine the host was very welcoming and i felt at ease in their home, while having my own private space."
7249508,39353608,2015-07-22,28713439,Dimitrios C.,"Katrina was an amazing host. Promptly responding to any requests or questions, she was there to ensure our stay was most memorable. We even checked in late in the evening and she was there at a very short notice to accommodate us. Her place is immaculate and decorated with taste. Both the bedroom and the living room have an amazing view of the lake. I most definitely recommend this listing."
7249508,40504130,2015-07-31,38353556,Melvin,"She met us at the unit and went over all the details. She had soap and bath products available and even had coffee and filters.
Katrina was a delight to deal with and was readily available.
The unit itself was very well located and was within walking distance to the city center . A whole foods was just down the street.
The place itself was in a-one condition and had all the amenities.
I am a firm believer in airbnb.
Thank You Katrina

7249508,41820822,2015-08-09,31186452,Louis,"Katrina has been a wonderful host. Despite some changes in my schedule, she kindly accommodated both check-in and check-out time for my convenience. She promptly responded to my inquiries as well. The unit was in excellent condition. Unlike other places where photos and the actual room might be different than you expected, this unit is exactly as I imagined it. It's at one of the best core spot in downtown! The scenery from window was amazing too. 
I wouldn't hesistate to revisit this unit again. :)"
7249508,42444054,2015-08-13,34708261,James,"Excellent nice place
No hassles"

7249508,43569891,2015-08-20,25998742,Ken,"Nice spacious unit in a central location to the Market, Cap. Hill and many other areas of Seattle. Despite construction (not uncommon in Seattle) this was a very quite space. Katrina was well organized and polite. "
7249508,45388423,2015-09-02,27566940,George,Best host of all time! Extremely responsive and a great place.
7249508,46024595,2015-09-07,27195451,Erika,"Katrina met us when we arrived to make sure we had everything we needed. Communication was prompt and she was accommodating for our earlier check-in time. There were three of us staying, so we required extra sheets and an extra blanket for the couch. Katrina dropped some off for us within  a few hours. The couch was very comfortable and an adequate substitute for a bed. Location of the listing is ideal for exploring downtown and our primary mode of transportation for the weekend was walking.  We had a great trip and would definitely consider staying here again."
7249508,46550217,2015-09-11,19643079,Luke,"Apartment was exactly as advertised.  My wife and I walked everywhere, very centrally located!  Checking in was a breeze, as was checking out.  Katrina checked in via text while we were there, to ensure everything was ok.  Would definitely stay here again."
9183380,55830511,2015-12-06,49205973,Joshua,The listing was accurate and this was my first time using AirBNB. Jocelyn was an excellent host and the view from this apartment is second to none. A beautiful and safe complex for an amazing city.

3994397,36485153,2015-06-28,32568947,Jenna,The room was beautiful and inviting! Fran made us feel super welcomed and we both felt very comfortable there. The skylight was a treat and the neighborhood was great. Was walking to some cafes and bars but not terribly so. Public transportation is easily accessible though. We especially loved the super friendly puppy that greeted us in the mornings. Really great home!
3994397,38574982,2015-07-16,37028106,Wolfgang,It was a pleasure for us to stay at this nice and idylic location in Seattle. It is located at a quit silent residential area and a little bit far from down town. The room is very nice furnished and the bed is very comfortable. A terrace and a big garden is reachable from the room.  So you can stay here much more than 1 night as we did. Next time in Seattle we will come again .... Thx 
3994397,39093443,2015-07-20,23432364,Lauren,Fran was extremely kind and her was home was beautiful with a spectacular deck..we enjoyed the great neighborhood..lots of good food and local shops..and it was close to the beautiful beach and Lincoln park..we had a an amazing time!!
3994397,39587320,2015-07-24,6917772,Richard,"Fran's home in the West Seattle hills is a quiet retreat from the busy district. The comfortable room opens onto a private deck with great views of the area. 

Fran is a relaxed host who made feel very welcome. The home is well decorated and full of great art. The personal details are reflect Fran's creative life. 

We had a wonderful and far too brief day in West Seattle. We'd love return and we'd love to stay at Fran's place again. "
3994397,39819644,2015-07-26,37710393,Kevin,"I loved the room.  Very clean with a nice deck with flowers and a skylight over the bed.  I also really like the location in West Seattle which was conveniently located near the course I was taking, and also Lincoln Park and some great restaurants.  The Host and her dog were also very nice and she gave me some great restaurant suggestions."
3994397,40300730,2015-07-29,39852037,Robert,"This was my first Air BNB experience and because of the wonderful hospitality I received this will not be the last. The house and room were beautiful, the hosts were very friendly and helpful. They even offered to pick us up from the airport! I would recommend this listing to anyone looking to stay in West Seattle."
3994397,41008267,2015-08-03,3256216,Donna,Fran and Naomi made us feel right at home. The room was beautiful. The deck off the room was great to hang out on. The house is immaculate. We were a couple of blocks from the bus line and used it regularly. 
3994397,41281083,2015-08-05,39551038,Tom,"What a great find!  The room and adjacent deck are nicely separate from the rest of the house and we felt like we had our own private suite.  In the morning I went for a run down to the beach and the surrounding neighborhood is lovely. Fran is an excellent host and we really enjoyed talking with her.  And Maggie the dog gets ten stars, such a sweet pooch!"
3994397,41556376,2015-08-07,8894813,Ben,Sweet good vibes and feeling comfortable and at home brought good sleep after a long flight. Greeted by a friendly dog but never saw the lovely hosts. So grateful for the easy trust! 
3994397,41562282,2015-08-07,40500119,Lena,Fran was very accommodating. We got in late (midnight) on a weeknight and that was fine with her. The neighborhood was nice and quiet and a short drive to beautiful alki beach. The room had its own bathroom with a shower! Gigantic room. Very clean. Comfortable bed. Gorgeous backyard. All in all a great first air bnb experience. 
3994397,42014551,2015-08-10,30692617,Leo,"Fran and Naomi were lovely, they are a very sweet couple that made us feel welcome.

7275464,38459696,2015-07-15,35664887,Jay,"I just got a chance to catch up on things after a week attending an event up in Seattle.  

The Private Studio was very cozy and modern.  The entire place was as upscale as any 4+ Star hotel rating if not higher.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is visiting and wants his/her private studio in the backyard of a Capital Hill suburban home.  I come and go at my own convenience with a private entrance and a backyard to relax to.

In addition to the awesome private studio, Bobby, the host was super friendly and helpful.  I have a bag full of dirty clothing, which I need to have clean so I could wear them for the next several days; there were no laundromat nearby and Bobby offered to clean them for me while I had to rush out to attend the events that I was up in Seattle for.  This was above and beyond what was called for and Bobby doesn't have to do my laundry, but he did and I am grateful.

Thank you for a wonderful place for me to be able to enjoy and get to know Seattle."
7275464,38663857,2015-07-17,30851696,David,Great little studio in a quiet neighborhood. Very nice and modern finishes. There was even a Guinness waiting for me in the fridge!  ;)
7275464,44147216,2015-08-24,501330,Aaron,"Perfect visit to Seattle. The Studio is lovely, bright and clean. The bed is VERY comfortable. Bobby was a perfect host - always available but not intrusive. Location is fantastic (food and coffee). We love the shower (very nice size) and all of the bath products.  "
7275464,45293371,2015-09-01,29702757,Brian,"Great little studio super close to downtown.  Loved the contemporary design.  It was a welcome surprise to find some cold beer in the fridge, and good stuff at that.  Thanks Bobby!"
7275464,47164953,2015-09-16,10285131,David,"Awesome private studio in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. It had everything we needed for a nice week exploring Seattle! 

Host was very helpful with information prior to the trip and welcomed us on arrival. The pre-stocked fridge with some beer, cider, and water was much appreciated! Otherwise the host was completely unobtrusive and we had a nice, quiet stay!"
7275464,48004476,2015-09-22,5610926,Janine,This in law unit is perfect! Two of us stayed so comfortably with more then everything we needed. Bobby had wonderful recommendations which made navigating the neighborhood easy. We walked everywhere and took a lyft if we needed too. Thanks again! We had a wonderful stay
7275464,49121799,2015-10-01,41575136,Alex,"Bobby is really nice, we had a wonderful stay. You can reach bus stop by walking 5m”, 10m” walking to supermarket & restaurants. It takes 15m” to downtown by bus. 
The studio is new and comfortable. It even has a 3m2 storage, where you can put all luggage in! Please double check if you need to take a powder adapter if you come from overseas:）
Bobby人很nice，值得推荐给大家：）步行5分钟就有Bus Stop，10分钟有超市，餐厅。15分钟Bus可以到Downtown。房子很新，设施也很齐全，舒适。
还有一个大概3m2的储藏室，我们六个行李箱，妥妥的全部放进去。因为中国电源不一样，提醒大家带一个电压转换器。
Bobbyが優しくて助かりました。ここに泊まって良かった：）交通が非常に便利です。歩いて５分でバス、１０分でスーパーマーケットとレストランに着けます。お部屋がきれいだし、住み心地良いと思います。必ず皆へ推薦します。3m2の貯蔵室もあり、大きな荷物を全部取り占める！"
7275464,49813407,2015-10-06,11180795,Robert,"I can't more highly recommend this Capitol Hill property.  It is located on a quiet street but you are minutes away from some of the best that Seattle offers.  Bobby is an excellent host, responsive and informative.  The studio is compact and the ability to switch between a comfortable bed or sofa makes the most of the space.  This quiet, private studio is a perfect space to base the exploration of Seattle. "
7275464,50511316,2015-10-12,6415406,Daniel,"Perfect for our mini vacation. Very clean, provided soap, shampoo, towels, paper towels, clean sheets, etc. Met the owner at the last day, very nice guy. As others mentioned, he had free beer and water in the fridge."
7275464,51382618,2015-10-19,46227121,Stacey,"Bobby was a very good host, very responsive and provided great info about the cottage and the neighborhood. We enjoyed the cottage, it was small but very clean and modern and had everything we needed. The neighborhood was great too; we didn't rent a car but were able to walk to the local spots for coffee, yoga and food as well as to the arboretum which was also close, and could hop on a bus to get downtown. We would definitely stay again next time we are in town. "
7275464,53549710,2015-11-09,28177163,Kayti,It was a great house. Exactly as it looks in the photo. The hosts were very kind and helpful. We have family in Seattle and plan to stay there again when we are in town. Great location. 
7275464,54238222,2015-11-17,43815818,Sally,Bobby was an excellent host and communicator with many helpful suggestions. The location was as described in every way and very clean.
7275464,54807003,2015-11-23,22760670,Curtis,"This was a super nice place. Clean and new, exactly as described. It's very quiet but also there are good restaurants just a few blocks away. The host, Bobby, was super nice. We had a problem with the cable TV and he called us back immediately and got it fixed."
208356,504276,2011-09-05,1027846,Gentry,"Dirk and Jaq were the perfect hosts. They made the stay easy and convenient and were very helpful with local directions to great food in a nice neighborhood. The room was quiet, clean and comfortable--everything we needed for a great weekend in Seattle. I would encourage anyone who is up to being hosted in a pleasant place by wonderful people to give their loft a try!"
208356,525215,2011-09-12,517812,Shelley,I had a great stay at the artist loft.  It was clean and quiet with a super comfortable bed and big fluffy towels.  The location was very convenient for walking and cycling around town.   Dirk and Jaq were great hosts. They were available to answer questions and were very friendly.   I'd definitely stay at the loft again and would recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxed and cool place to stay. Thanks!
208356,537917,2011-09-16,459611,Charles,My stay at the loft was ideal.  The loft is located right downtown.  I usually stay in a hotel.  It was nice to have my own space.  The bed was ultra comfortable.  The best thing about the space is that it is collocated with an art studio.  I had the chance to speak with one of the artists and explore their works.  
208356,555125,2011-09-21,1144873,Kayleigh,"The accomodation is exactly as it is described on the website - a clean, modern studio with a shared bathroom and kitchen area. Wifi is very good connection and extras were included in price - towels, sheets, shampoo/conditioner etc.

The location is right next to International District station making it easy for the airport. For getting into town, we would advise looking up bus routes as we weren't too clear and ended by walking, but this was only a 25 minute walk.

Our hosts were very friendly and happy for us to get in touch if necessary."
208356,578391,2011-09-28,937102,Elizabeth,"My friend I are so glad we got to stay at the Contemporary Art Loft. We were there for a week and definitely recommend this place! Dirk and Jac are friendly and helpful; even with everyone’s busy schedules, they regularly checked with us via text to see if we needed anything to make our stay more comfortable. Like another reviewer mentioned, nice fluffy towels and a comfy bed are much appreciated. 
The working artists who we met during our stay also made us feel welcome; we even got to attend an exhibition opening! The room comes with a map showing the art galleries within walking distance so you can create your own art tour.  Dirk gave us a nice tour of his new gallery - we really appreciated his insight into the local (and national) art scene. 
This is an excellent location for getting around town without a vehicle; we took the Light Rail Train from the airport to the Intl. District stop (Jackson and Fifth). Even though it was 11 p.m. when we arrived, we felt safe enough to walk with suitcases in tow, to the loft (which we were relieved to find out, is just a short, one-block uphill walk).
Pioneer Square and the Zeitgeist Café are an easy five minute walk and from the Jackson and Fifth intersection we never had to wait very long to catch a free city bus to get around town (there’s a “free fare zone” downtown and drivers usually let you know where to get off to stay in the zone). 
We were there on a Seahawks game day, which was fun – the area is transformed. You can hear the roar of the crowds wherever you go and a sport’s pubs seems to be on every turn. We strolled down to First St., next to the stadium, during the game and found some neat art galleries that were open on a Sunday. We also discovered the Pyramid Alehouse, where we enjoyed the game on TV with a microbrew–while listening to the crowds in the stadium across the street. 
We started every day with a coffee at the Panama Hotel – friendly service and delicious mini-cinnamon buns. We also visited the coffee shop on the corner, across the street from Uwajimaya that serves “bubble” or Bobo Tea, a hot Chai Honey-Latte with little balls of soft tapioca at the bottom that you drink through a big fat straw - fun and delicious! The food court at the Uwajimaya was perfect to pick up a light meal to bring back to the Loft or to get breakfast on-the- go (we especially recommend the puff pastries at Yummie House Bakery in the food court – to die for!)

208356,590161,2011-10-02,1172258,Vincent,"Wonderful and accomodating host.

very nice, clean and quiet place.

Close to the bus tunnel for easy transportation.

Definitely value for money.  "
208356,595797,2011-10-03,1226776,Elecia,"We had a great experience staying in Dirk and Jaq's loft space. It is in a great location, within walking distance to everything we needed. It's really close to public transit, too. Dirk was available to help us with directions and to give us recommendations on where to go.
The space was very clean and cozy, the bed really comfortable. There is an iPod dock in the suite which was a really nice touch.
We highly recommend this space and are very grateful we had such a great place to stay in Seattle."
208356,607456,2011-10-07,1092943,Judy,"The place was very nice and clean. Close to Pioneer Square! Nice hosts, very accommodating!"
208356,615796,2011-10-10,1207191,Rob And Clare,"Dirk and Jaq's space is unique, modern and very clean. Their recommendations for restaurants and coffee bars were excellent. This is a great location for asian cuisine and public transport connections. We are keen walkers and found that downtown and Belltown were within reach on foot. Buses, trams, trains and Zipcars are readily available if you're heading farther afield."
208356,618853,2011-10-11,1095706,Konrad,"Dirk gave us a great introduction of Seattle and supported us very well.
We really enjoyed the room and the location."
208356,626770,2011-10-13,255008,Troy,Jaq and Dirk were super easy to communicate with and the place was clean and exactly as it looks on the site. I did not meet either of them but all was very smooth and professional..
208356,635020,2011-10-16,1032107,Clive,"Dirk and Jaq were very helpful in securing the loft at short notice. It is conveniently located in the international district and served my needs well. It is very private and I only saw Dirk one time in the loft and again with Ted, their dog in the coffee bar nearby. The amenities are neat and clean but you do need to remember to take your keys with you to the communal  bathroom or you will be locked out. The stairs were a challenge for me as I had my ACL replaced 4 months ago, but that is Seattle for you."
208356,667533,2011-10-26,1006110,Patrick,I met Jaq on the day of check-in. She was extremely friendly and even helped me carry my belongings up to the studio. Access to the building was very easy and the space was extremely neat. The location is also ideal. My friend & I ate in the neighborhood at a fantastic Chinese restaurant. I would definitely use this space again! 
208356,673016,2011-10-29,305796,Lisa,I loved this cozy loft. The location is really convenient to the train to the airport and places in downtown Seattle. There's some great sushi downstairs and the bed is comfy. I'd def stay here again.
208356,684874,2011-11-01,1338129,Jordan,"Great room, super location"
208356,703383,2011-11-08,917824,Minah,"The place was perfect.  The neighborhood has some great Japanese restaurants.  And Dirk and Jaq are very informative and available. (quick email responses!)  Transportation was really easy and cheap.  The place is exceptionally clean and well organized.  I will stay there again.  Thanks, Dirk and Jaq!  
"
208356,729722,2011-11-19,1338892,Jos,"Hi future Seattle visitors! The loft is and is at a great location: close to town, public transport, lively area. I was heartily welcomed by the Dirk and Jaq who were both busy to get an exhibition outside Seattle on the road the week following my arrival. The size of the room is adequate and I especially liked the autumn leaves on the trees visible through the window. The climb up the stairs to the sleeping level was rewarded with the most incredible comfortable mattress I have ever slept on. Regretfully this is not available in Europe otherwise I would order one right away! If ever I return to Seattle I'll stay here again."
208356,735170,2011-11-21,1370875,Noah,"Fun place-really nice for a short weekend in Seattle. Interesting neighborhood, good food, REALLY comfortable bed. No full kitchen, so don't expect that. But the loft if a great base downtown for your Seattle adventures "
208356,742492,2011-11-24,819138,Andrea,"Excellent location, kind and helpful hosts."
208356,743874,2011-11-25,1432776,Kim,"No complaints here! Loved our stay. It was quick, easy, clean and convenient. Would definitely stay again. Thanks guys!"
208356,784226,2011-12-13,1288059,Bert,This place was amazing!  I got it literally last minute and Dirk and Jaq were extremely gracious and accommodating.  Would recommend highly to anyone visiting Seattle.
208356,787531,2011-12-15,341922,Ernie,"
Dirk was personable and helpful in orienting us to the building.  Good place for our short stay at a reasonable cost.  It was convenient for us as we had an early train to catch and their rental is just three blocks away from the station.  We did not have the opportunity to try them but there are several Japanese restaurants within a block.   
The ladder to the sleeping loft works for guests with good balance and agility (especially so in the middle of the night).  Shared bath is down the hall as is the kitchen.  The bed was comfortable and everything was clean.  The building was secure.  I would recommend their place."
208356,804012,2011-12-24,1490944,Annette,"I stayed in Dirk and Jaq's loft for a few days before christmas and really enjoyed it! They are ever so nice, cooperative and helpful. The loft is very practical and clean and provides everything that you need to feel comfortable. You share the restroom with other artists in the building.
The location of the loft is just perfect. Just a three minutes walk to the tunnel bus system to get into the center of downtown Seattle which takes also only a couple of minutes. The busses within the downtown area are free between 6am and 7pm. From the same station you can take the Light Link Rail which takes you straight into Sea-Tac airport in 30 min!
Thanks again, Dirk and Jaq, it has been a great stay with you and I will certainly come back again. I can definitely recommend their loft!
Best regards, Annette"
208356,841079,2012-01-06,1255282,Rain,"This is a lovely artistic loft! Very clean and have lots of privacy even with shared bathroom. Dirk & Jaq are really helpful with the process of getting there and hand you the key. The artists in the loft are so nice and friendly. If you ever have the chance to see them you will know. They are so warm and willing to help and chat! Beautiful place with beautiful people! 
Highly recommend! "
208356,855509,2012-01-10,321857,Arvind,"Clean, spacious and great location! Jaq and Dirk were very helpful with giving us some orientation as well. The bathroom is in a common area but it didn't look like anyone else was living in the other studios.. we didn't encounter other people in the 4 days (besides Jaq and Dirk a couple of times during the day.) Loved it!"
208356,863493,2012-01-15,938145,Jon,"We really enjoyed our stay.  It was a fantastic location, the room was great, and there was plenty to do within walking distance.  Jaq was super nice, as was her dog Teddy.  We would gladly stay there again."
208356,878839,2012-01-23,1587903,Ním,Location and space were great. Be sure to check out the sushi place downstairs.
208356,892766,2012-01-30,1655804,Sara,"Dirk and Jaq were wonderful hosts, very easy to contact and didn't get upset when Chinese Lunar New Year traffic set us back almost 2 hours. The space was clean and comfortable, with great advice and a good central location for an evening in Seattle, but it still felt quiet and intimate. The stay was wonderful, the bed was glorious, and I now aspire to build a loft bed in my home! Thanks, Jaq and Dirk!"
208356,911686,2012-02-10,1413031,Edward,Very conveniently located near buses and the downtown. The room was comfy and looked just like the picture. My only regret is I can't sleep in the loft bed anymore :-)
208356,921089,2012-02-14,542548,Shary,Thank you Dirk and Jaq for your lovely loft space in downtown Seattle.  Your location is perfect for a good walk to numerous must see sites in the area.  The Sushi across the street was fresh and delicious.  The free parking around the corner was another bonus.  The bed is like sleeping in a cloud.  I can't wait to return for another visit!
208356,926727,2012-02-17,1606701,Jonathan,"Very comfortable accomodation; convenient location, and Dirk and Jaq very friendly and accommodating. Exactly like in photo."
208356,928420,2012-02-18,1097314,Anna,The loft was exactly as pictured and perfect for 1 or 2 people. The space is spotless and very comfortable. It's in a convenient location with lots of parking outside. Dirk and Jaq were excellent hosts with lots of information about the space and surrounding areas. My only wish is that I stayed longer!
208356,937486,2012-02-21,1482914,Anson,"Great little place to stay. Clean, comfortable, and fairly close to the downtown area. The space was more than ample for the two of us. Bed and bedding was comfortable and more than large enough. All the necessities were provided like towels, soap, shampoo. Overall a great place to stay at a great price."
208356,942690,2012-02-22,399099,Helen,"A very quick response to our last minute trip down to Seattle! Lovely, comfortable room with very helpful hosts! Close to downtown Seattle with  good restaurants nearby! Especially Maneki for good, cheap Japanese food! Highly recommended! We'll definitely be back!"
208356,944995,2012-02-23,555271,Debra & Peter,"We had a great time in Seattle! The loft is in the middle of Chinatown/International districk, just a couple blocks from King Street train station (including Amtrak) and it is within easy walking distance of downtown. The apartment is very simple and streamlined, but the communal kitchenette includes use of the fridge, microwave, electric kettle, & toaster oven. The ladder on the loft was a little scary for me first thing in the morning, but the mattress is firm and very comfortable. The Grand Central Arcade bakery (Pioneer Square, 214 1st Avenue South) was our favourite haunt for tasty local treats. There are lots of interesting Asian restaurants nearby, many with very reasonable ""happy hour"" specials. .."

They are creating a second space and I've booked a stay in Room #2 for one night of April and May.  Can't wait to sleep under the sky light and wake to the morning light.  The kitchen is a bonus and the shower is great.  It is in a perfect location in downtown Seattle, which is extremely hard to find.  Very European."
208356,982430,2012-03-09,1629290,Tim,"Jaq & Dirk's place was great! It was super clean, in an ideal location (near the Light Rail, train, and ferry stations, and a short walk from downtown), and they were very helpful and made us feel really welcome."
208356,989506,2012-03-11,983942,Christine,Jaq was super friendly and there to greet and show us around when we arrived. There was everything we needed at the place. It was easy to get to and fairly close to the core of town (via car) but also walkable. It was an overall great experience. 
208356,994130,2012-03-13,1629290,Tim,Staying at Jaq & Dirk's place was so great we came back and did it again on our way back down the coast (see other review for more info...or save the time and just go ahead and book it).
208356,1009260,2012-03-17,1750509,Katie,"Great space, as others say ladder feels a bit dodgy on the way down.  Very immaculate clean and comfy beds.  Everything you need."
208356,1018497,2012-03-19,1131565,Carol,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I loved the airtist loft which was impeccably clean, walkable to downtown Seattle, a block away from the light rail, secure, and tasteful with lovely artwork! It's your own private hostel. The bed was very comfortable. Be sure to read the guest guide book that Dirk and Jaq provide with maps of the galleries in the area and their local favorites. I had a lovely stay! Would love to come back."
208356,1037740,2012-03-24,1893346,Savannah,First time in Seattle and This was a really lovely lof! The location was perfect and Dirk and Jaq were really helpful with the information book in the room and great about keeping us up to date. I will definitely stay here next time Im in town!
208356,1043485,2012-03-26,465591,Peter,"It was a great location and a nice cozy place to stay.  The hosts were very helpful and nice people.  However, the loft experience (going up and down the ladder) was not for me.... Overall it was very good."
208356,1057177,2012-03-28,2005324,Micah,"Only stayed for a quick one night stay, but I loved the location and the room.  Couldn't be more convenient one block away from the light rail.  Travel to and from the airport was seamless!  The accomodations specifically were great -- very private, extremely comfortable (memory foam mattress and pillows more comfortable than any hotel).  Dirk and Jaq were very responsive and friendly.  I wouldn't think twice about staying anywhere else in Seattle!"
208356,1059449,2012-03-29,1972693,Rachelle,"The room was great, I really enjoyed my stay here. The location was also really great, close to King Street station, and Int'l district station. It certainly made my first trip to Seattle comfortable and fun. I never got the chance to meet Dirk and Jaq but they made the process very smooth, and enjoyable. "
208356,1067246,2012-04-01,346689,Mara,"I recommend this place for its comfort, convenience and value. The room is quite spacious and the mattress in the loft is excellent. Jaq and Dirk's thoughtful attention to detail meant that I had everything I needed
during my stay. Their restaurant recommendations steered me toward two of the best Japanese meals I've had in a long time. "
208356,1080427,2012-04-03,46773,Kerwin,"Had a great stay at the Artist Loft last weekend.  Jaq was very helpful with pre-arrival emails and when I wanted to extend my stay another night.  (Thank you Airbnb for the assist).

The bed was extremely comfortable, but I have to admit, I fell asleep on the little couch watching tv, and slept an entire night there quite comfortably with their fleece blankets and area heater nearby.  Everything was efficient and well laid out.  The reception booklet was very helpful with transit and property info.

If you are using public transit, this place is literally at the heart of Seattle's transit hub.  You can catch tram, buses, amtrak one block away.  Its just south of the main business district downtown, and an easy bus ride to Pike Place Market, Belltown, Seattle Center, shopping and the bars/pubs.  I didn't explore the International District much, but there is plenty within a couple blocks.

The place was absolutely quiet the three days I was there, and Dirk was the only person I saw in the hallways the entire time.

On street parking over the weekend was actually plentiful, right in front of the building.  Meters run 8am - 8pm Monday to Saturday. Sunday is free.

This place works exactly as advertised, and is sort of dreamy for the artist type!  I will definitely stay here again for future trips, and can recommend it to you.

Thanks Dirk & Jaq for putting together a great place to stay in Seattle!"

Even though we never got to meet Dirk and-/or Jaq everything went smoothly and we felt that we were well taken care of:-) Nice guestbook with lots of information on the neighbourghood. Parking was easy and free at night. Better cooking facilities could have been nice (no cooking plates), but we managed alright.
Overall a great place to stay, and I wouldn't think twice about returning."
208356,1117318,2012-04-12,1928674,Meagan,Great location and hosts! Would most definitely stay again at the lofts. Thanks!

208356,1147513,2012-04-18,1767427,Dovile (& Kestas),"Me and my boyfriend were travelling and stopped by Seattle, where we found a great one night stay, which was at a convenient walking distance from city center, in a smart-way prepared room with all that a traveller might need during short stay. The appartment was very clean, shared bathroom and kitchen as well, that we freely used at our needs. The host was very nice, he even gave lots of advice for a one day experience in Seattle which we gladly enjoyed. Honestly, I was pleassantly surprised with the comfort of the bed they provided. I slept like a baby, and it was really convenient and soft, even on the upper part of the loft. Thank you again, I shall gladly recomment the place as moreover, it was also a very good price deal. :)"
208356,1169257,2012-04-23,2007052,Jeremy,"My Girlfriend and I were planning a trip to Seattle to visit my sister and we were ecstatic found Dirk & Jaq's loft listed on Airbnb just three blocks from her apartment. The reviews were so positive that I was excited, but a little skeptical about what we would find when we arrived. There was nothing to be skeptical about, the loft was fantastic. It was clean and comfortably furnished and the bed was fantastic.  I wasn't too excited about the prospect of shared bathrooms, but they were also spotless and well appointed. 

Unfortunately we weren't at the building much, except to sleep, so we didn't have a chance to meet Dirk & Jaq, but our stay was great and we will definitely stay  here next time we are in town. "
208356,1215290,2012-05-02,1814764,Mioara,"We spent a week at the loft and would come back again. The loft was a nice, safe, quite and clean place located within walking distance to downtown. Dirk and the artists were very friendly and helpfull. We could adjust the room temperature as desired. Kithen and bathrooms were very clean."
208356,1238754,2012-05-07,1911966,Erin,"Everything was exactly as described in the listing.  I had the place with my mom over the weekend and it was very quiet -- we heard some voices down the hall on Friday, but other than that, there was no one else around.  The bathroom is big and clean and the towels were great.  The mattress was really comfortable and climbing into the loft was fun.  The only downside is that heat rises, so it gets stuffy up in the loft when you're sleeping.  Turning on the air vent seemed to mitigate that.  Overall, thumbs up -- I'd definitely stay there again."
208356,1268303,2012-05-12,554420,Bethany,"Great place! Just a 15ish minute walk from the market and close to the water - very convenient to downtown. I didn't feel 100% safe walking back after dark alone, but cabs are easy to find."
208356,1281114,2012-05-14,714693,Jana & Stephen,"This little loft made the perfect spot to crash in the International District when I stayed there this May. It's on the upper floor of what looks like a business building from the outside. Upstairs, the shared areas are a little bit echo-ey, and the room feels a little bit sparse--but it's exactly like you see in the pictures, which I really appreciated. The bed was super comfortable and felt a little like sleeping in a treehouse, especially with the little window right next to it. :)  There was a bit of street noise, but still much less than what I would expect from a busy weekend in a downtown part of the city.
Outside, the area is a nice, clean block of the ID, has coffee nearby, and we had no problem finding parking, though that may have been because of the late, late hour. Speaking of which, I really liked how the key system works: the hosts place the keys to the building and to your room inside a little lock box with a code, then they emailed me the code so I could retrieve the keys and check in whenever I wanted, which worked perfectly! Two thumbs up."
208356,1293298,2012-05-17,1729860,Damian,"I really enjoyed my 3 night stay in the loft. Dirk and Jaq responded quickly to my many queries and provided a lot of helpful and accurate advice and assistance to make my stay in Seattle run smoothly.  The loft is comfortable and secure and the bed comfortable.  The shared kitchen and bathroom was spotless. The loft is really well located, close to the rail and all the sights of the southern CBD.  Thanks Dirk and Jac, I really had a great stay and would definitely return."
208356,1310641,2012-05-20,2121287,Teresa,"Just like the pictures!  Nothing to hide.. not even a dirty spot.  Never had a problem with restroom usage.  Staircase to the room is not a problem at all, I even had a 40 lb luggage and had no problem carrying it up.  It's handicap accessible also."
208356,1335075,2012-05-23,1656057,Kenny,"Everything was just as neat and tidy as described and showcased in the pics. Only a 15-18 minute walk to the convention center/downtown. I never felt like I was in a dangerous neighborhood. The loft is pretty, beds are cozy and it's definitely a sweet deal! Also, Jaq was very helpful in giving me a quick rundown of the city (was my first time in Seattle). If I'm ever in town again, I'll look them up!"
208356,1350970,2012-05-26,1095519,Joanna,"Cute, modern artist loft. It's modern but lacks that home-ey feeling. I didn't like sharing the bathroom with others, and meeting business sales men in the kitchen. i wished he didn't ask so many questions about my occupation, if i were a doctor or technician. But Dirk and Jaq were nice and pleasant! "
208356,1360757,2012-05-28,395819,Evan & Kim,"My wife and I came to Seattle on our way to Yellow Stone. We arrived to their home at 7am. Although, check in time is not until 4pm but they were nice enough to let us use their facility to freshing up after a long fly from Hawaii. Their place was very clean, spacious and centrally located in downtown Seattle.  Everything is within walking distance, the bus and light rail is only a block away. We have enjoyed our short stay at their place and we would recommend this place to everyone. 

Thank you Dirk &  Jaq for your hospitality.
Take care."
208356,1381243,2012-05-30,427592,Jason,"Love the location of Dirk and Jaq's loft! It was super easy to get here from the Seattle airport via the Link, and staying in the international district added loads of good Chinese food to our trip. Dirk and Jaq were perfect hosts, the bed was exactly what a tired traveler is looking for and as a bonus there is a Caffe Vita only a few blocks away! Thanks Dirk and Jaq!"
208356,1391680,2012-05-31,2477141,Mona,"Jaq and Dirk are great hosts and the room was very nice. The
ladder to the sleeping area could be a problem for some. The location was terrific for us--with light rail 2 blocks away. Don't miss the ""Chihuly Garden"" at the Seattle Center. Great ethnic eating
nearby.   Mona Onstead"
208356,1430817,2012-06-07,1620066,Jackie,"Great value.  Very clean.  We stayed here for 4 nights while visiting Seattle on vacation.  We arrived early and were able to drop things off in our room early, which was very helpful.  This was the perfect places for us to stay while on vacation - we could walk/run everywhere we wanted to go.

We didn't find the neighborhood intimidating at all...Obviously there are some city areas that you may not want to walk alone at late at night.  We had no issues - no one even spoke to us outside.  Of note - it was VERY loud one weeknight (trash collection/street cleaning for several hours) - I would guess this is a rare occasion.  "
208356,1446681,2012-06-09,2547465,Summer,"I traveled Seattle from Los Angeles by talking train alone. After 34.5 hrs in the train, I arrived Seattle around 8:40pm and luckily I chose this place; because it's only 0.4 miles away from the train station. And I also walked to Pike place from here, very very convenient location,  The room is very clean and neat. Even if you fly to here, you can take "" sound transit"" from airport  and get out "" international district or Jackson street. then just walk couple minutes you will arrive here. Overall this is a very safe, quite, convenient location to stay with. I didn't have chance to see Dirk and Jaq in person, but they were really nice when I called them."
208356,1464253,2012-06-12,1635557,Cate,Dirk and Jaq were wonderful hosts and very accommodating. They were super helpful with things like a last-minute iron request and coffee recommendations. The space was clean and comfortable. We'd definitely stay here again.
208356,1489199,2012-06-16,1771379,Sheri,"We just finished a tour of British Columbia with night 1 and night 10 at Dirk and Jaq's artist loft.  The description and pictures of the property are completely accurate - centrally located just two blocks from SkyLink and Amtrak in the free bus zone and in the heart of the International District with a potpourri of ethnic restaurants, art galleries and other interesting attractions like the Klondike Gold Rush museum.  The bed, linens and towels are first rate.  Don't worry about the shared bathroom.  We saw no one during our stay and the shampoos and other bath amenities were perfect since we were traveling with none of our own.  There is a small TV with satellite, including HBO and free WiFI.  If you have trouble with steps, don't choose this loft as there are a lot of steps to get to the room and you have to climb steps into the loft to sleep.  We followed Dirk's suggestions for coffee at Zeitgeist and dinner at Shanghai Gardens (2011 and 2012 readers choice for best Chinese Restaurant in Seattle) - loved both.  Definitely a do-it-again if traveling through Seattle.  Book early, this one is sure to fill up fast."
208356,1516047,2012-06-19,2344624,Rebecca,Dirk was great!  He made an excellent recommendation for dinner and we loved Maneki.  The neighborhood is super fun and the space is modern and clean.  One of the artist-residents was very friendly and introduced himself.  We had a great chat.  This was an idyllic airbnb experience!
208356,1541140,2012-06-23,2285152,Daniela,"my first airbnb experience and it turned out great: communication went perfectly, they answered really fast. the loft was as discribed and like the whole place really clean. loved staying there."
208356,1578704,2012-06-27,1896237,Brooke,"I loved staying at this great location in Seattle! It was even more perfect than I had imagined it would be as it was so close and accessible to everything we had planned while staying in Seattle. Also, the room and bathrooms were exceptionally clean - definitely a must!

Thanks Dirk & Jaq!"
208356,1581502,2012-06-28,2441984,Kaitlyn,"Will definitely be staying here next time I go to Seattle! It's in a nice location, and the loft was well kept and safe. Dirk and Jaq were very kind and helpful hosts."
208356,1591199,2012-06-29,37709,Seh,"We were in Seattle for only a day and this suited us really well. It's near the train/bus station, is a great starting point to walk to Pioneer Square and Pike Place, and was very clean."
208356,1625091,2012-07-03,2723315,Minjoo Grace,"Even though I haven't met Dirk&Jaq while I'm in Seattle, I'm sure they are really nice and friendly. The contemporary artist loft was amazing. It is in amazing location in downtown and lots of public transportation. It is just near China town and it was pretty easy to find the location. Me and my friend were only travelling in downtown Seattle and it only took less than 15 mins to reach this place. This place was super clean and neat. The bed is so clean and tidy, the washroom is big and new, and super clean. We were so tired from the travel and we relaxed in this place with cozy bed. This is rare chance that you and your friend can make amazing memories in artistic place.:) 
Thanks Dirk&Jaq for offering such a great place.
I'm 120% sure that I will be staying in this place if I go to Seattle again. and I will !

Thanks again!"
208356,1661852,2012-07-09,1456721,Bonnie,"Artist's Loft in downtown Seattle was a perfect stay for our 3 nights in at this most interesting of cities perched on hills overlooking beautiful Puget Sound. Close attention was given to all details we could need in the room, kitchen and bathrooms and our friendly host, Jaq, was readily available if we were to require anything else. A most convenient, comfortable stay!"
208356,1680768,2012-07-10,2696140,Joe,"The loft was reasonably priced, very convenient to downtown and provided a comfortable nights rest.  Dirk & Jaq do a great job of having everything setup and making it an easy self check-in process.  They were also gracious enough to send me a text to let me know the room was ready earlier than expected.  Overall, enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend it for others visiting Seattle and looking for a place close to downtown.  Cheers!"
208356,1690395,2012-07-12,2555591,Jenny,The loft was perfect!  Great location and very clean!  Would definitely stay here again! 
208356,1701936,2012-07-14,208600,Laura,"A great place to stay in Seattle. The place is a fun loft set up with nice, airy rooms. Plus it's just two blocks from a light rail stop and a quick walk from other good sites in downtown. I'd definitely recommend it. "
208356,1712391,2012-07-15,928128,Christopher,"Fantastic location near the light rail, easy walking to anywhere downtown.   Really enjoyed staying here for the night, interesting lofts that are clean and organized."
208356,1730807,2012-07-17,2459143,Eric,Great place and wonderful hosts.  Had a lovely time and really enjoyed the experience.
208356,1745711,2012-07-19,2350867,Bronwen,"I had two nights here. The location was perfect for me with very easy access to the train and bus terminals. The loft was very clean and comfortable, great shower area as well. Barely saw another soul. I was very happy with it and would stay again.  The area is quite noisy at night but I sleep in ear plugs anyway so wasn't a problem for me."
208356,1803233,2012-07-26,2282077,Ryan,Great room and building. They were very quick to respond with any questions. The check in and out process was extremely easy. 
208356,1811699,2012-07-27,881239,Sarah,"Super smooth system - easy check in/out, great communication, great location - couldn't have asked for anything better! Thanks!"
208356,1830363,2012-07-29,2650359,Louisa,"This is a really cool loft in downtown Seattle.  Very clean and tastefully decorated.  Jaq is a great communicator, and everything went very smoothly.  Thank you!"
208356,1854331,2012-07-31,2895634,Kate,We enjoyed our brief stay at the studio.  The whole concept was modern and urban: the check-in/out process was super easy with the lockbox and pin number.  The communal bathroom and kitchen were clean; it is a smart idea that promotes the co-op mentality.  Thanks for making our stay easy breezy.
208356,1867233,2012-08-02,2235381,Chris,Dirk and Jaq's loft is very comfortable and in a great location.  Everything went smoothly.  I will definitely book again next time I am in Seattle.
208356,1881381,2012-08-04,1993094,Christine,"Dirk & Jaq were excellent hosts, they provided us with a wealth of information on sightseeing. The loft was more than enough room for us and the shared kitchen/meals and bathroom area worked well. It was an ideally situated, near to public transport and the CBD.  Chris & Robert Ballarat Australia"
208356,1902240,2012-08-06,1583710,Danielle,"I had a great stay in the artist loft. It was hot as blazes the weekend I was there, so I was very grateful for the 2 fans that were provided. As well, Dirk and Jaq installed an air conditioner in the common area to help cool things down. I was pleasantly surprised by all the amenities that were provided- shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and tons of kitchen/food items. The loft is located in a great location - tons of delicious dining choices within walking distance (try the Tamarind Tree!) AND the light rail/buses are essentially right out the door. "
208356,1923181,2012-08-08,2578196,Andy,"The location is superb.  Everything was smooth.  I got a chance to meet both Jaq and Dirk which.  If you are not familiar with Seattle, just know that it can be hilly at times so just make sure you know you are going to be trekking at times.  Facilities are very clean and well kept.  Probably the best value in the area.  You probably cannot find a better deal.  The building they are currently in continues to raise the prices on a yearly basis and to help offset some of the costs, they have opened up two airbnb rooms.  So by staying there, both parties win. You get a great deal, and you support local artists.  Cheers!"
208356,1963052,2012-08-12,3175509,Matt,"Our stay in Dirk and Jaq's loft was excellent. The space was clean, comfortable, and exactly what we were looking for. We ended up having a car, unexpectedly, but street parking out front was no problem - just had to plug the meter!"
208356,1975163,2012-08-13,3137200,Zahi,"Dirk and Jaq where very accommodating and friendly.  The room and the common areas (kitchen and bathroom) were clean.  They were even responsive late at night. The location is good, and the room was very nice.  I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to friends. 
"
208356,2026840,2012-08-19,2308917,Adam,"We had a great time in Seattle. We really enjoyed the room and everything was as advertised. The bathrooms were really clean and the kitchen was orderly. Dirk was super nice and great with helping us find places to eat and making sure we had everything we needed. My only criticism would be that it would have been nice to have an ac window unit because of how hot it was. I know that it's only a handful of weeks in the summer that you would even need it, but it still would have been nice. Everything else was great. I would recommend this room to my friends. Thanks.   "
208356,2052930,2012-08-21,649493,Kevin,"Went to Seattle with my girlfriend Ellen for a wedding. We stayed at Dirk and Jaq's place, it was clean and easy to get to. "
208356,2090064,2012-08-25,2609477,Amanda,"This place was perfect! And surprisingly secluded and private too. Exactly what we needed after a day of busy city seeing. Never got to meet Dirk and Jaq, but they were on top of informing us about how to get the key and such. I would totally stay there again. Be aware though, if you are a light sleeper, leave the window shut, the bus depot is conveniently close, and early morning squeaky breaks were not how I wanted to wake up.  "
208356,2151968,2012-08-31,2488379,Rebecca,"Dirk and Jaq's place is cool and urban. Very clean, neat, and well-designed. We were a bit worried about street noise, as it was noisy when we got there, but things quieted down after about 10:30 pm. We missed meeting Dirk and Jaq, but they gave us very detailed instructions, so it wasn't a problem."
208356,2190275,2012-09-04,2442440,Vincent,"My friend and I had a blast over the weekend meeting up with friends at the Penny Arcade Expo and touring Seattle. The room was very comfortable and overall great. If I decide to come back to PAX next year (or Seattle specifically for any other reason, maybe) I will definitely check to see if either of these rooms are available. Worth every penny. 5/5"
208356,2227521,2012-09-08,1622586,Marion,"We had a wonderful stay at Dirk and Jaqs apartment. Everything was very well arranged, including the description of the way from SEA-airport to the apartment. Very clean and cosy. Thanks a lot!"
208356,2236232,2012-09-09,473655,Carol,"Dirk and Jaq's place was great. It's centrally located in chinatown or International District as it's known. It's very close to the stadiums, bus lines and the metro/rail which can be taken from the Seatlle airport. The loft is small, but perfect for us since we were out most of the day and just needed a place to sleep. There's a kitchenette and shower/restrooms in a large, quiet communal art studio. Jaq and her dog were super nice and I would definitely stay here again. Btw, Tsukushinbo and Maneki are great sushi restaurants and are less than a block away. A must try restaurant is Sitka & Spruce in Capitol Hill. Everything we ordered was mouth-watering.

208356,2315937,2012-09-17,2707960,Jasper,We really enjoyed our stay here. Super clean space with all the amenities needed for a comfortable stay. We never met Dirk and Jaq but they were very communicative on email and clear on details before our arrival.  There is a booklet with lots of info and maps in the room too that was great to have  recommending cafes and places to eat nearby! Although there is lots of parking around we preferred to park in a secured parking lot not far away. Would definitely return here! Amazing value too.
208356,2352346,2012-09-20,2538878,Scott,"We needed a place to stay the night in Seattle on our epic trail from China back to Lubbock, TX. Dirk and Jaq's place was so great that we wished we were staying additional days. We loved the layout of the room and the loft space for the bed. Speaking of which, the bed was amazing (my wife prefers hard, I prefer soft...somehow the mattress was both at the same time). 

Dirk and Jaq are quite good hosts, they provided excellent communication and even were adaptable to some of our special needs (e.g., no internet available in china right before our stay). Our stay was so short we didnt get to meet them, but they were very friendly over the phone and in email contact. They also provided an excellent guide for guests in the room. Almost anything you could need was available in the room from an umbrella in case it rains to great wireless internet to towels and so forth for the bathroom/shower. Hopefully we can come back with more time available to make more use of the guest guide. We only had time to catch breakfast in the morning after our stay and their recommendation was superb (Grand Central Bakery).

The loft is in a great location very close to light rail/bus stops and the amtrak station. We walked from the amtrak station with 2 carry ons and a large luggage each and we didnt feel that the walk was difficult or strenuous. The SeaTac Airport is easy to get to using the light rail stop near the building. We didnt mind having the bathroom shared with others it was very quiet the night we stayed and it basically felt like the bathrooms were ours. The bathrooms are very clean and well prepared for guests. After a month in China, we really enjoyed having an american shower experience.

Overall we were extremely pleased with our stay. The only downside: we only stayed one night! Highly recommended"
208356,2377754,2012-09-22,3612497,Kelly,"Our stay with Dirk and Jaq was fantastic!  I could not have imagined a better first Air BNB experience and I am happy to say that it definitely exceeded all expectations :) Their loft was beautiful, clean and the location could not be better! Thank you D & J!!!

208356,2484029,2012-10-02,2019532,Sophie,"We had a great stay at Jaq&Dirk's place in Seattle!
Thanks again to Jaq who was very kind and helpful."
208356,2505452,2012-10-04,2059378,Vickie,"Great location, reasonably priced.  About 1.5 blocks from a major transit center - you can take the train from Seatac, with a 2-minute walk to the apartment.  Also 3 blocks from Salumi (foodie heaven run by Iron Chef Mario Batali's family). Walking distance to Belltown, Pioneer Place, etc.
Bring your bike - there are quite a few hills, but Seattle is a great biking town -- with many miles of uninterrupted bike paths along the water."
208356,2516727,2012-10-05,3704935,Catherine,Awesome place to stay in a great neighborhood. Jaq and Dirk were super friendly and accommodating. I would definitely recommend staying here when visiting Seattle! 
208356,2579628,2012-10-11,2035928,Eva,"This is a really cool loft, very close to the light rail station (with direct connection to the airport). I saw Jaq briefly when I just arrived, and she was very friendly. Everything was easy to find and I've already recommended the place to people."
208356,2610692,2012-10-15,2458090,Aaron & Bonny,"Dirk and Jaq's loft was in a great, central location and had everything that we needed for the final night of our honeymoon.  We would definitely stay here again in the future."
208356,2662925,2012-10-20,2671766,Jason,"The loft was extremely clean and inviting.  As expected of artists, every little detail (e.g. heaters, fans, lights, etc.) in the room and common area is well thought out and taken care of.  As an example, a small vent sends a puff of warm air as you enter the bathroom so it's never cold even at 2am.  Jaq was very prompt and friendly throughout the booking process, pre-arrival, and during our stay.  I had a very pleasant time, and would definitely return if I visit Seattle again."
208356,2694805,2012-10-23,2144154,Deb,"This is a great place to stay in Seattle--I enjoyed it a lot. My only reservation is for folks who are very tall or have problems looking down from a height. 

The bed is up in a loft which is 8 good-sized steps up a ladder--your head will be very near the ceiling (I'm 5'4"") when sitting in the bed. In order to get in and out of the loft, I found I had to go up and down by looking down at the ladder (and thus down from the height) to make sure my feet found the rungs to step into. However, the loft railing runs alongside the bed--so no worrying that you might fall out and go anywhere!

Having said this, everything else was perfect. The place is sparkling clean and cozy, the neighborhood very near public transport and the ferries, plus there's a cool coffee/tea shop up the street at the Panama Hotel. You are located in the Japanese sector of Seattle so take advantage of the area including the huge Asian grocery that Dirk pointed out to me. 

The apt's temperature can be controlled by the occupant. Dirk and Jaq respond quickly and are fantastic to communicate with--I even met Dirk as I arrived at the apt; he was replacing the fire extinguishers with new ones.

This apt loft has my full recommendation, but note the reservations above and take your own personal situation into consideration. -djs"
208356,2815833,2012-11-05,1360936,Mark,"Nice, clean place and good location.  Just as advertised.  Really happy with the stay."

208356,2842176,2012-11-08,4061561,Pia,"I really enjoyed my stay here. Both the room and the building were spotless and well maintained. Dirk and Jaq were great to deal with. The room was comfortable, airy and warm with plenty of amenities. The loft bed was a bit scary with the ladder, and when you're up there the ceiling is a bit low, fortunately I'm short so I was able to sit up without bumping my head (taller people may have to hunch over) but the mattress was amazing and I had a really good sleep. The location is fantastic, a couple of blocks from King Street Station in the ID. If you like sushi there are three spots on that block, including one downstairs that was brilliant. Despite being right in the city, the area was pretty quiet. I recommend this spot, especially if you don't mind a good scamper up a ladder before bed.  "
208356,2866687,2012-11-12,1486169,Diane,"Convenient, clean, and reasonably priced. We were pleased with our stay. Thank you."
208356,2966160,2012-11-26,3841530,Heidi,"Excellent place to stay! The room was cozy and the bed was comfy. We had everything we needed! The loft was also a short walk to all the necessary sites: waterfront, ferris wheel, Pike Place, aquarium. Highly recommended!"
208356,3035366,2012-12-06,523764,Jennifer,Jaq and Dirk returned our messages very promptly. The lofts are located steps away from the light rail to the airport and city bus lines. The loft was set up very comfortably with an awesome memory foam mattress. The shared areas were cleaned daily. It's a pretty unique experience and we recommend it.  
208356,3045547,2012-12-08,1321548,Jesse,"Great little loft for an excellent price. Extremely close to Pioneer Square and downtown. I especially appreciated their little book of recommendations. Very thoughtful accommodations in general. 

(ps, there is a little fan up by the lofted bed - use with caution! It vibrates the bed in such a way that I thought the place was built above a nightclub! It took me a little while to figure out that it was the fan causing it, but it was fine once I shut it off.)"
208356,3074574,2012-12-11,4324942,Bryan,If you're looking for a fancy place then look elsewhere but if you need a clean and quite place to crash that is close to public transportation then this should be on the top of your list.
208356,3189117,2012-12-30,1435831,Jen,"This was a really charming loft in a great location - right in Japantown with loads of restaurants, close to all forms of public transport, and easy to walk to and around downtown. 

The space itself was clean and cute. We were the only tenants so the first night was very quiet - we noticed on the second night that the loft drywalls were very thin, so getting a good night's sleep requires considerate/quiet neighbors. 

Sharing kitchen and bath was not a problem by the way  - easy access.

Great experience overall. I''d stay here again!
"
208356,3235337,2013-01-02,517812,Shelley,This is my second time staying at Dirk & Jaq's loft and had another great experience.  The loft is perfect and Dirk & Jaq are great hosts.  The loft has everything you need and is in a great location. 
208356,3266508,2013-01-04,3977537,Dominik,My girlfriend and I stayed at the loft for 2 days and nights and we thought that it was truly amazing. The rooms were very clean and well appointed. But what we appreciated the most was the way everything has been organized. If you have a look around yourself you will find little notes in every corner that tell you what to do. Jaq and Dirk really seem to put a lot of effort into their rooms so that guests can feel comfortable. Both of us recommend staying here and we would definitely come back for a visit in Seattle. 
208356,3311520,2013-01-08,4462379,Francesca,"An excellent place to stay in Seattle. Particularly appreciated Dirk and Paq's wonderful recommendations for nearby coffee places and local sushi. They were so helpful, and it was so nice to stay in a place peopled by local artists. Much more of an experience than staying in some characterless hotel.
"
208356,3360421,2013-01-16,1999941,James,"Great place, very well thought out ! everything you could need, very clean !"
208356,3403974,2013-01-23,2543,Mike And Fabian,"What a fantastic place in Seattle to stay at. The studio is spacious and everything is provided from fresh towels to tea. Convenient location too, bus is right there. Many thanks for having me, it was great! "
208356,3433408,2013-01-28,791954,Fiona,"This was perfect! The location is central - near the station and public transport., and walking distance from downtown and the convention center. The loft is simple but comfortable. Jaq is charming and the restaurant recommendations were very good. I would certainly stay here again."
208356,3459316,2013-02-02,3013239,Jared,"We had a great stay at this cool artist pad. We had a lot of privacy, and the location was really nice -- very close to a ton of awesome Japanese restaurants. The space looks exactly like the photos. "
208356,3503754,2013-02-09,1615090,Jennifer,"This was my second stay at this unit.  Jaq and Dirk are friends and have thought of everything, down to the minisoaps!  The loft bed is comfortable, the desk was perfect set up for work, the location is close to the international district and Pioneer Square gallery area, with safe on the street parking.  This spot is now my go-to place to stay when I return to Seattle!"
208356,3586532,2013-02-19,4944443,Lily,"Thanks to Dirk & Jaq, we had a cozy place when we stayed in SEA. The Japanese restaurant you recommended is so nice. Thanks!  "
208356,3632092,2013-02-26,4364502,Tanya,"Dirk and Jaq's space is awesome! 

Great location for getting around Seattle, amenities and house rules clearly and thoughtfully located and labeled so that you know how to find and take care of everything.

I'd recommend their lofts to anyone looking for a good launching pad to explore Seattle!"
208356,3680349,2013-03-03,729212,Stephen,Great people and the place was clean and as advertised!  Good location just a minute or two walk to downtown.  Jaq gave us a tour of her studio; very interesting and a marvelous painter.  We will have to buy one soon!
208356,3702473,2013-03-05,5140572,Neal,"The loft was just as convenient as advertised, and even had a quiet heater that enabled us to turn off the noisy built-in heating. The tea and ground coffee etc available for guests was a great additional touch, especially after the nearby coffee shop is closed.  Expect a bit of exercise climbing into the bed, and bringing any luggage up the front stairway."
208356,3768125,2013-03-12,5272704,Megan,"Nice, clean loft equip with warm fuzzy blankets and a space heater. There is a mirror, desk, TV (we didn't use it), leather couch, coat hangers.

 The bed is made of memory foam and has a window to look out of.

The building is located near the downtown, the Bolt Bus (1 block), and city buses to Fremont.

There is a kitchen with a fridge, toaster oven, and microwave. There are two bathrooms and they are both cleaned daily. You are provided with towels, a housecoat, and there is a blow dryer in the washroom.

Dirk and Jaq were accommodating by allowing us to drop keep our bags in the main room of the building even after check out time.

Thanks Dirk and Jaq!
"
208356,3844661,2013-03-20,4784244,Linda,"This was my first time using airbnb and I was so pleased with the room! The location is fantastic and it's super close to any form of transportation you need to get around the city; we never had to walk more than two or three blocks to find a bus stop or light rail stop that took us directly to the all the wonderful neighborhoods Seattle has to offer. The loft and common areas were clean and had everything you need for a comfy stay. Overall, fantastic (and cheap!) place to stay for a few days in Seattle!"
208356,3873170,2013-03-23,2401868,Nathaniel,"Dirk and Jaq do a great job with this space. It was everything I needed, hospitable, clean, unique. I was very comfortable and would highly recommend staying here. "
208356,3971928,2013-04-01,1814558,Tu Tram,"I had a great stay at Jaq & Dirk's loft in the International District in Seattle. The room was clean, the bathroom was clean and the building is very quiet at night. There are notes everywhere, please read them, it helps in knowing that the place is kept clean by others being clean, so you should do the same, especially in the bathroom.   I met Jaq before I left and she was very nice! The building has been renovated, so everything is in pretty good shape. Would stay here again!"
208356,4176673,2013-04-15,3705152,Anthony,"Jaq was super friendly and a great host.Thank you for helping us with the details on how to get around.Very clean and great (email hidden)ry happy with the stay and would recommend staying here.

With the essential amenities we didn't have to worry about if we forgot anything, and the location is just one block away from the LINK station (and lots of bus lines). It's quiet, and very well maintained. I'd recommend to everyone."

208356,4327986,2013-04-28,5345940,Joanna,"My friend and I enjoyed this spacious, modern loft and comfortable bed. The location is in a pleasant and safe neighborhood and Dirk & Jaq were so helpful with places to check out. "
208356,4367521,2013-04-30,3647961,Belle,"My husband and I stayed for one night and had a good experience. The loft is central location, easy to find, close to amenities, reasonably quiet given location, in a secure building, clean and comfortable room, quality bed and linen, clean and tidy shared bathroom and kitchen, excellent communication by the hosts. Very good value. We would happily stay again."
208356,4398600,2013-05-02,1816659,Lisa,Great place near the train station and downtown.  Super clean and organized. Hope to be back!
208356,4527518,2013-05-11,544165,Konrad,"We had a perfect week in Jaq and Dirk's artists lofts. Our room was nice and clean, with the loft bed and window. It was centrally located in downtown Seattle next to all buses and trains. Walking distance to pike street market and settle art museum and starbucks(es) ;-)
We loved Seattle and would love to come back!"
208356,4559110,2013-05-12,719996,William,Everything was great!
208356,4627284,2013-05-16,6082680,Belinda,"This was a wonderful place to stay at.
It was a very comfortable bed and very clean and neat room.
Had all the basic necessities, ie towel, toiletries, hair dryer.
Very close the buses and link rail which is literally 1.5 block away.  
Close to nice places to eat.  Quiet in general except for the occasional seagull  outside in the morning.  Otherwise I would highly recommend for anyone."
208356,4712568,2013-05-21,6108876,Piotr,"We stay for two nights, the location is very good, easy access to many interesting places. Jaq is very friendly host. "
208356,4738117,2013-05-22,2477872,Timothy,"Very well set up and accurately described. Easy in, easy out, great location. Thank you!"
208356,4774906,2013-05-25,5480380,Steve,What a great neighbourhood to stay in.  The international district has some great Asian food and is great for a stroll to the Seattle Art Museum and Pikes Markets.
208356,4963428,2013-06-04,5686174,Madeline,"I stayed in the loft for 9 nights, it was excellent! Perfect location, very easy to walk to downtown and lots of excellent places to eat and shop close by. Dirk and Jaq were lovely, very helpful and friendly! I would highly recommend staying here to anyone!"
208356,4993764,2013-06-06,95110,Km,"Great space, everything was as described. As a light sleeper (and jetlagged), I especially appreciated the good blinds, nice bedding, and fan in the loft area. Proximity to the airport LINK train and an easy process for self-service late-night check-in made this a great option for us. We recommend walking over to Kobe Terrace Park to see the community garden (including chickens!)."
208356,5012075,2013-06-07,350836,Rand,Great value - comfortable and close to Amtrak station
208356,5079092,2013-06-11,1099663,Joy,"My friend and I enjoyed our stay at Dirk & Jaq's loft.  It was clean, airy, and well-stocked w/ toiletries and kitchen necessities.  It was conveniently located to the Link station, which quickly took us to & from the International District to many parts of Seattle (i.e. Westlake, University, SODO, and Sea-Tac Airport)...and even a short distance away from Safeco Field- home of the Seattle Mariners.  

Overall, we enjoyed our stay here and would definitely come back to stay with Dirk & Jaq for our next Seattle trip."
208356,5118272,2013-06-13,6504901,Peter,"Great location, clean and quiet room, great bed!"
208356,5246920,2013-06-20,6017077,Kristen & Matt,"We found the contemporary artist loft to be just what we needed -- a comfortable, affordable place to crash after long days walking around Seattle. Jaq and Dirk were both very gracious hosts, and the guidebook they provided was really helpful. The Japanese restaurant around the corner (Maneki) was so great, we went there twice. The location is great. We would definitely stay there again.  

A couple of things that would be good to know: the ladder to the loft is really quite steep. If you have trouble with heights or plan on being tipsy, or if you are someone who frequently has to visit the bathroom during the night, you might want to think twice about staying here. Another thing worth mentioning -- more than one person told us that parking our car in this neighborhood was a bit sketchy. Apparently there are a lot of break-ins at night. We didn't have that problem, but I was pretty nervous about it. If you can avoid having a car in Seattle, you're better off. The public transportation is fantastic and easy to use. "
208356,5312362,2013-06-24,6072304,Marcel,"Thank you very much for my stay in the room! It added greatly to the pleasure of visiting Seattle. Everything was squeaky clean and in perfect working order. Your little notes added a nice personal touch. Within a day it felt like home.
I liked: the efficient ""upstairs"" bed leaving much more room than the average hotel; french bakery and asian supermarkets within two blocks to get daily food-stuff; bus/link-line station just one block away; 20 minutes walk to Seattle center.
Thanks again! Marcel"
208356,5426038,2013-06-29,540836,Don,"Spotless, quiet, perfectly situated and outfitted! THIS is why I use Airbnb and recommend it to all of my friends and family!  A perfect getaway in Seattle and this place is to thank!"
208356,5529587,2013-07-04,1101671,Michael,great place to explore seattle. met the host once at arrival. everything was just perfect! 
208356,5637443,2013-07-09,4660810,Ashley,"I had an enjoyable stay at Dirk & Jaq's studio apartment.  The room was spacious, clean and nicely furnished.  The room comes with air conditioning, which is really appreciated after a long day of walking about the city.  I especially enjoyed the great quality of the mattress and the unique sleeping environment with the short ladder up to the bed.  It feels like you're in a tree house - very cute & cosy.  The kitchen is available for use and the bathroom has plenty of space as well.  I also liked the location of the apartment - nice and close to getting the bus as well as the light rai transit to the airport.  It's also convenient to great restaurants and the waterfront.  I would definitely stay here again and may do so in the future.  Just love Seattle!  Thanks D & J."
208356,5682056,2013-07-11,7095094,Anita,"Very clean - plenty of room.  The bed, though in the loft accessed by the ladder, was comfortable.  The room looks exactly as in the photograph and the bathroom is just down the hall.   Jaq was very helpful in recommending restaurants and the place is convenient to the International District and the ferries.  We have not a single complaint and enjoyed our stay (quick, only one night) very much."
208356,5710922,2013-07-13,1741351,Smeeta,"Jaq's place was exactly what we needed for our couple of nights in Seattle. Check-in was very easy and Jaq was present and available to answer questions as we needed. It was convenient to all the places we needed to get to and very clean and comfortable. The loft may be a bit of a challenge to get up to on the ladder for people who are not too agile, but once you get up, the bed is super-comfortable. We slept very well and would stay there again. Thanks Jaq!"
208356,5734176,2013-07-14,639935,Lydia,"Clean,functional and very conveniently located close to the light rail station. An easy walk to Chinatown, the International District and Pioneer Square and a 10-15 minute walk or a quick subway ride to downtown. Met hosts briefly."
208356,5749273,2013-07-15,5813787,Pal,"Spending a night at Seattle's Downtown - we were to be going to San Jose, California by train (yes, train :) next morning -, Dirk's and Jaq's Contemporary Artist Loft was a perfect place for my wife and me; The accommodation was just a block or two away from the train station, and the room was nice (and definitely unique :) and clean. Thank you very much Dirk and Jaq for your kind hospitality!"
208356,5961341,2013-07-24,5242362,Phil,"Jaq's loft is awesome. Super clean! Very convenient to everywhere in Seattle. Located near the hub of public transportation, we were able to go somewhere cool every day for $2.50 round trip (with transfer).
The International District is a great place. Many restaurants and bars, coffee and bakeries within a few blocks. It takes about 5 min to walk to Pike Place Market. 
The loft was cozy, comfortable, and exceptionally clean. We highly recommend staying there and would go back. Jaq was very hospitable and flexible. Best experience I have had with online room renting. "
208356,6022822,2013-07-27,5522575,Jeff,"This is exactly what I was looking for, A nice place to rest my head while trying to be an ""express"" tourist. I loved how most everything was within walking distance. Dirk and Jaq were very helpful and accommodating, I would definitely use them again for my next trip to seattle. "
208356,6047134,2013-07-28,2057343,Matt,"Great stay. Room looks exactly as shown. Jaq was a kind and honest host. Did everything they said they were going to do promptly. 

The location is awesome. It's right in the heart of downtown and is walking distance to the water and sports stadiums. Very nice room. Unbeatable for the price. Would stay again. "
208356,6080374,2013-07-29,7188562,Joshua,"Dirk and Jaq's loft is the perfect place to crash when exploring the city. It's clean and perfectly appointed, located in the Seattle's International District with lots of great Japanese restaurants within walking distance. When we checked in, Jaq was working in her studio down the hall and was nice enough to tell us about the city, make recommendations and show us some of the really interesting pieces she's working on. 

We stayed on a busy Saturday night in the city and even though the building is a functioning studio for artists, we found the place to be quiet and comfy. If you're traveling by train, the loft can't be beat - we were able to keep our luggage there after checkout and pick it up on our short walk back to the Amtrack station. 

All in all, an affordable alternative to cookie-cutter downtown  hotels than are never that great anyway. A great place to use as a home base, freshen up, and crash in a clean, cozy bed while experiencing Seattle."
208356,6217400,2013-08-04,6813753,Sue,"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Seattle. Dirk and Jaq were wonderful hosts. Very easy to get anywhere around Seattle from this location!
"

The location was fabulous - right by the train station. Dirk & Jackie made excellent dinner recommendations too! Thank you!
208356,6297692,2013-08-07,1988491,Kathrin,"Dirk and Jaq's place was clean and comfortable. It was very nice that we could bring our luggage earlier and the location was convenient, too. 
I just thought that it would have been nice if we had actually met Dirk and Jaq because that's what I like about airbnb...getting to know people from different places. 
If you're just looking for a good place to stay in Seattle, I can recommend the loft!"
208356,6340918,2013-08-09,6137941,Jeremy,"We had a great stay here. Perfect location in Seattle's historic Japantown. We walked to the ballpark (15 minute walk) Pike Place Market (20ish minutes) and more. Also there is excellent sushi right around the corner at Maneki. The room itself was clean, bright and comfortable. Bed was comfortable too. We would definitely stay here again!"
208356,6368884,2013-08-10,4941564,Patrick,Wonderful location! Close to public transport and a 3 min walk from the bolt bus stop.

208356,6419893,2013-08-12,3948263,Arielle,"This location was so wonderful. My boyfriend and I were in town for a wedding, and we were very pleased with how close it was to the link station and the venue! Also, we walked to Pike's Place in a short time! It's a fun walk. 

The room was clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay again."
208356,6462412,2013-08-13,2969575,Julian,We didn't end up getting to spend nearly enough time in Seattle due to a scheduling conflict but this place was clean and well located. Very professional check in and out.
208356,6568175,2013-08-17,7838389,David,"Dirk and Jaq are a totally nice couple.  Gave me much information and advice about my stay.  They really have it together to make the visit comfortable. Sad that I had to cancel because of my business.  But, for sure I will contact them again the next time I am in Seattle."
208356,6659601,2013-08-20,7239989,Laurel,"This is a super clean, quiet and convenient place to stay with easy access to Union Station and within walking distance to the Ferry Terminal and the Downtown free ride zone. Communication with Jaq and Dirk is fast and clear. The key access sequence is easy, too.
A big added bonus is the excellent selection of Asian foods available within a couple of blocks.  
"
208356,6867401,2013-08-28,3869825,Fabio,"Very cute and well keeping place. 
Sadly we did not meet the hosts, but we felt like home. 
Attention for details and instructions, impeccable like all the loft.
Close the Chinatown and LINK station. 
Very clean instalations, confortable bed. Silent place. WiFi nice and strong.
The bathroom outside the room was no problem to us, and again, very clean with nice towels.
We highly recommend staying here.
Be aware about the entrance stairs versus luggage."
208356,6898369,2013-08-29,7837448,Elisha,"Our stay here was wonderful! The hosts were dry organized, as their recommendations in the brochures they left for us were great! And they always have us a quick reply! Would definitely stay here again! "
208356,6945258,2013-08-31,8252893,Steven,This was a great place to stay. It was cute and clean and everything was within walking distance. Had lots of amenities I wasn't expecting like a robe and and binder full of recommendations for popular destinations and restaurants. Didn't actually meet Dirk or Jaq but they were very helpful and quick to respond when I would message them. I highly recommend staying here!
208356,7032626,2013-09-04,5973861,Travis,"Nice place to stay. Easy to check in and out. Great location near light rail station. Bed was surprisingly comfortable, but that loft ladder might be pretty tricky for anyone with mobility issues, just a heads up, but no problems for us. "
208356,7067690,2013-09-05,7229098,Richard,"The loft was exactly as the hosts stated. The location was good for walking down town or taking the light rail. There are quite a few great coffee shops, art galleries and a charming community garden within a 5 minute walk. It was not noisy at all on the Labor Day weekend we stayed. I would stay here again! contemporary art loft downtown [#7]"
208356,7101019,2013-09-06,522287,Johnny,"the artist loft in chinatown was really cool and comfortable.   the location was great for finding some late night chinese right down the block .  the Westlake beef soup was awesome.   so the loft was an easy walk to bakeries and then off to pioneer square the next day.  the unit and community bathroom and kitchen were well equipped , super clean and and everything is clearly marked and labeled for no confusion among other guests or tennants.  my girlfriend liked the french press coffee maker.

208356,7142102,2013-09-08,8132868,Sunny,"We had a great experience here!  The room was spacious, very clean and comfortable.  We loved the neighborhood--although visitors should note that it's probably not the safest location for a single traveler to be walking alone at night.  We recommend zeitgeist coffee in the neighborhood and waking to a mariners game!"
208356,7197000,2013-09-10,7630747,Nathan,Nice and clean. Very well located. Shared bathroom may put off some but excellent value overall. Nice hosts.
208356,7228721,2013-09-11,8503308,Angela,We went to Seattle for the night to see a baseball game. Great location. Less then a mile walk to the stadium.
208356,7362724,2013-09-17,7094238,Ana,Really nice and clean space.  I felt very comfortable and Jaq and Dirk were both very friendly and answered all my questions via email and were available via text if I needed them during my stay.  It was nice to be so close to the train station and bus stops--could get around town very easily!  
208356,7428268,2013-09-19,458400,Alex,"I love this apartment! The location is superb –– I arrived at the Sea-Tac airport, hopped onto the LINK light rail and the apartment was just a 3 min walk from the station. Room was very clean and the internet was reliable. Shared bathroom was super-clean and almost always empty. Only thing to take note is that the ladder is rather steep so you need to be extra careful when going up/down from the loft. Other than that, this place is fantastic. Will definitely stay there again the next time I'm back!"
208356,7432741,2013-09-20,7170140,Mercedes,We stayed at Dirk and Jac's loft in September 2013.  The accommodations were exactly as described in the Airbnb website.  Any questions we had were promptly addressed by Jac and Dirk.  We stayed in both of their lofts and each one was terrific.  The loft was centrally located to everything we wanted to see.  We only had to rent a car one day to go to Rendon.  Jac and Dirk were great hosts.  
208356,7483055,2013-09-22,2663047,Carole,"We stayed here at the beginning and end of our trip to Seattle and Vancouver, Dirk And Jaq were really easy to deal with by email/ message and it was super easy to find from their great directions.
We enjoyed the sty there and would stay again."
208356,7509938,2013-09-23,485054,Robert,"Dirk and Jaq are great communicators and everything went smoothly. very convenient to the train, right in Chinatown, it  was a convenient comfortable stay"
208356,7550004,2013-09-24,274427,Geri,"My sister and I stayed here twice. This is my second review. The fact that we liked it enough to return says a lot. But again, the shower was wonderful, the room well thought-out and perfect for a short stay. Not fancy, unless you count the art, but plenty of room for baggage etc and moving around which is sometimes not the case in Airbnbs. I like the place and will do a third stay next time I'm in Seattle."
208356,7579014,2013-09-25,2663047,Carole,"The loft was in a great location for arriving from the airport and really close to the Amtrak station too. Also easy to get around on foot and by bus.
Jaq and Dirk were really well organised with information for us to get from the airport and it was super easy to get the keys.
Everything was really clean and the bed was really comfortable.
We met one of the other artists and she was really friendly and gave us some really good info too.
"
208356,7742452,2013-10-01,8090195,Jennie,"Dirk & Jaq's place was an awesome location in downtown Seattle. Super close to the train station to/from the Airport and within walking distance of all the great downtown Seattle spots (Pioneer Square, Pike Place Market, Belltown, Capitol Hill).
The hosts were incredibly accommodating with leaving luggage prior to check in/after check-out while I wandered around the city.
Would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to check out downtown Seattle!"
208356,7783842,2013-10-02,8753568,Lisa,"We had a fabulous stay at the downtown artist loft-it was central to everywhere we wanted to be!  The space was great-the pictures told the whole story.  Just what we needed after a fussy stay elsewhere.  Everything was clean, comfortable and accessible.  Space was ready early, communication was great and when we asked to keep our bags in the common space for the day-no problem!  Loved Seattle and the loft!"
208356,7796396,2013-10-03,8331192,Stephanie And Ryan,"Jaq and Dirk have a really lovely place in downtown Seattle. It was perfect and convenient for us as we had to get to the train station, just a few minutes' walk. Jaq was unbeleivably helpful in mailing me my replacement phone that was supposed to come during our short stay, but didn't arrive until we were well on our way to california! Thanks a million, Jaq! 

The Space was very clean and tidy, with all kinds of nice extra ammenities. Highly reccommended. "
208356,7962096,2013-10-10,8085895,Karen,I recommend this loft. It's in the middle of a lovely area. We ate at Maneki sushi around the corner. Plenty of tables on a Tuesday at 530pm. It got busy around 6. Very charming and tasty. The community garden up the street is a sweet sight. We picked up a copy of the Stranger and saw that one of our favorite bands was playing at Chop Suey that night. The loft is only about a mile away from that very fun and dive-y East Asian themed music venue. There are a ton of coffee shops near by and a cool guitar shop almost at the water. I think Seattle is obsessed with coffee. I'm probably not the first to notice. All coffee shops had a long line at 930am. It's a beautiful and very safe feeling area to walk in. A bit of a line at the bathroom in the am. I was surprised as it was so quiet that I didn't realize anyone else was staying near us until the morning shower rush. Over all I recommend it! Just plan ahead to wait for shower and coffee and parking and you will be happy. Everyone in Seattle seems pretty happy in fact. Must be a secret ingredient in the coffee.
208356,7983918,2013-10-11,7360319,Lindsey,Neat little loft in the industrial district. Near a really good dim sum restaurant and park. Public bathroom was kind of strange for me personally but it was very clean.Ladder to bed is a little scary as it is quite steep but all in all it was good for our short stay. 
208356,8047116,2013-10-14,7885640,Matthew,"We found our room to be inexpensive, clean, and perfectly located for exploring the International District. I'd happily book again."
208356,8119444,2013-10-16,6495915,Hanne,"The room was quite big, clean and had everything we needed. The shared bathroom and kitchen as well.
We never met the owners, but communication was easy through email.
The location of the flat is quite good, not too far from the city centre. There are many restaurants in the neigbourhood. We even found a free parking space!"
208356,8249380,2013-10-22,5778701,Jill,"This room was fantastic. I loved all the little helpful notes everywhere and Jaq helped me find the location when I first arrived via text. If I return to Seattle, I will most definitely stay again."
208356,8369233,2013-10-28,8617374,Mary,"Great location to visit Seattle on foot. With the light rail from the airport, walking distance to Pikes Market and buses only a block away, we got along in the city great. Local dining and shops were delightful.     "
208356,8455424,2013-10-31,7609499,Mackenzie,"We had a great time at Dirk & Jaq's place! Very Nice and clean also it is good chance to try out how loft place like, Very fast responds and helpful comment. although we didnt have chance to see them but everything is ready for me to stay. "
208356,8491243,2013-11-02,9602082,Kevin,"Cute little place RIGHT next to the metro. It is super convenient to get around that way, definitely recommended!"
208356,8541137,2013-11-04,2403221,Alex,"We liked it so much the first time (Aug 2013) that we decided to stay again, this time in the other loft room (same building, same floor). Again, the place was spotless, including the shared bathroom and kitchen which is so hard to come by. The location is perfect and you are going to save $ on parking. We also love the modern, simple, bright atmosphere of the loft. Will definitely stay there again."
208356,8756386,2013-11-16,9699471,Tingting,Great location with easy access to transport to various parts of Seattle.  Lots of good restaurants in the vicinity. 
208356,8931647,2013-11-26,2886161,Kait,"What a fantastic setup - perfect walking distance to Pioneer Square, Belltown, Capitol Hill, and much more. And...it's right next to public transit and the Amtrak (email hidden)us great coffee at Zeitgeist! 

Dirk & Jaq are wonderful hosts. I got the chance to speak with Dirk right as we dropped off our luggage. He's such a nice guy and has great tips for what to do in the city. Would definitely stay again the next time we're in Seattle. "
208356,9054823,2013-12-03,9585686,Jing,"Dirk & Jaq were really nice and considerate. We kept in touch via message throughout the trip and they were prompt in informing us of confirmations/check-in/check-out details. Furthermore, I came to understand that they are really talented and humble individuals as well!  I had a great time in Seattle staying at their artist loft.  The place is located conveniently a block away from the International District Light Rail station, within walking vicinity to bus stops, Uwajimaya market/Kinokuniya bookstore, and plenty of good Asian restaurants (Mike's Noodle House 全記麵家, Maneki, etc.) You could take the bus/light rail ride for around 10mins to get to Downtown Seattle; and if you really wanted to, you could also casually walk there in about 20-30mins (though not recommended.) From SEA-TAC, it would take about 30-40mins ride to the loft via the Light Rail, and only costs $2.75 one way! Again, I cannot emphasize anymore on how conveniently Dirk & Jaq's loft is located near downtown Seattle. I would personally come back and book with Dirk & Jaq in the future if I visit Seattle again!  :)"
208356,9095915,2013-12-06,120935,Ethan,"This rental is my new favorite! I have stayed in around 20 airbnb rentals all over the US and this little loft is now on the top of my list. First, it is the perfect size for one or two people. There is a shared kitchen and bathroom and I rarely ran into anyone in the entire building.

The location is divine especially for someone like me who loves international foods and culture. I also was using public transit while in Seattle and the rental is a stone's through away from a major station for trains and buses. I took a direct train to the airport in just a 30 minute ride. 

I will definitely stay here again.
"
208356,9101261,2013-12-07,7729437,Christine,"The room and location I thought just great!  We walked to market! plenty of restaurants and parks near by.....Need to be okay with a shared bathroom, but all very clean, clearly noted and really nice.  Even though we didn't get to meet Dirk and Jac, the communicating with us was also great.  The only thing that didn't have a sticky communication not on it was the suggestion to not use the lofted heater....we did and it had a bit of a noise to it.  There was an additional floor heater which we missed.  Considering how well everything else was sticky noted, I know this was an unplanned oversight!"
208356,9115992,2013-12-08,9729931,Michelle,Great stay! Thanks Dirk and jaq. The location was perfect and so handy to the light rail. We would definitely come back.
208356,9219785,2013-12-14,7275219,Grace,"The suite is comfortable and clean, just we expected! They left great signage everywhere so it was really easy to navigate and feel comfortable. We chose this place because I had to catch a 6:30am BoltBus and you cannot find a more convenient location! It was less than a 5 minute walk down the hill, into the Starbucks at Union Station, and onto the bus, which is especially handy at 6am :) Communication was great and it was really simple checking in and out, and Jacq emailed me to touch base while we were there. Great experience, will definitely book again!"
208356,9274379,2013-12-17,6485116,Craig,We had a great time at Dirk and Jaq's place on our last visit to Seattle. The room was neat and comfortable and we felt right at home. The location is perfect for anyone arriving by bus since it's just minutes from the Boltbus stop and King Street Station. We would certainly stay here again the next time we are in town.
208356,9327941,2013-12-21,1855755,Mary,"This was an awesome place with very clean amenities. The location is interesting as well, if you walk a block in any direction you can find small places worth stopping in. "
208356,9336447,2013-12-22,247147,Zoe,Very clean and comfortable space. Checking in was a breeze. Thanks for the great stay!
208356,9422910,2013-12-28,6223738,Kelly,"The studio is fancy and comfortable. My friend and I stayed for 2 nights, it was not so long time but we had a great time at the place. And also the location is very nice. We could go to downtown and the premium outlet so easily from the apartment. I strongly recommend this apartment. :)"
208356,9460490,2013-12-30,8861013,Janine,"Die Unterkunft ist so wie beschrieben und die Hosts sind sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Ich persönlich fand es ein wenig kühl v.a. im Badezimmer (hatten außen um die 7°C), da es nur kleine Heizungen gibt, die über Strom betrieben werden und die Decken sehr hoch sind. 
Die Lage ist so, dass man die Sehenswürdigkeiten zu Fuß oder über die nahe Ubahnstation leicht erreichen kann. Wir fanden die Stadt allerdings nicht soo überzeugend, es gibt zwar viele Kunstwerk etc. aber sehr viele Verwahrloste Menschen und ein Geruch von Fäkalien etc. in den Straßen..."
208356,9514062,2013-12-31,6608765,Lindsey,"Great location! Perfect for seeing the Seahawks play, 5 min walk to the stadium. We didn't see anyone else in the building so it was quiet. Room was clean and fresh. If we ever come back to Seattle I will definitely stay here again. Great price compared to the hotels in the area. "
208356,9585675,2014-01-03,6461225,Jess,"The loft was wonderful and clean. Great location to everything, especially enjoyed all the international food close by. Although we didn't meet Dirk and Jaq they contacted us to make sure that everything was ok after the first night which was very nice. I would recommend staying here if you are in Seattle."
208356,9834613,2014-01-13,10737944,Young Hoon,"Here is simple space but there is everything in the room.
So we don't feel uncomfortable at all.
Also it's easy to handle all of the equipment of the loft.
There are two excellent sushi restaurants around the loft.
The ladder to the loft is pretty steep and also heating system is not perfect.
However it'll be best choice if you think the price.
Anyway having good memory in Seattle, I came back home."
208356,9879870,2014-01-16,2076601,Sarah,"Dirk and Jaq's artist loft was spotlessly clean, easy to find, and only a block from the Link Rail station. The kitchen and bathrooms were spacious and almost always unoccupied. The neighborhood was a little on the sketchy side in the evening, but I felt safe enough during the day walking by myself. It is fabulously close to the Pike place market and waterfront. I would definitely recommend this loft and would stay here again in a heart beat! "
208356,9893072,2014-01-17,10552821,Kelsey,"Great cozy room! The only thing I did not like was the parking. I had to get up early for my meter. The bathroom was down the hall and would rather have it right by me! But if you are interested in staying in a sweet city like apartment with flat screen TV and awesome interior design, it is great for a night. They were great when I had questions, responded as soon as possible."
208356,9917806,2014-01-19,11018401,Ben,"This space is exactly what it says.  In the heart of downtown, easy walking distance to transit (literally a 3 minutes walk from LINK), restaurants, bars, and cultural venues.  A friend and I were looking for a place to crash in Seattle for one night and this was perfect.  No frills but still very nice, incredibly clean and run by expert hosts, which made all the difference.  Dirk and Jaq are easy to work with and very quick to answer any questions you might have.  Thanks for a great space in Seattle!"
208356,9936701,2014-01-20,3395830,Rue & Mickey,Clean and convenient! Enjoyed the loft very much.
208356,10030486,2014-01-26,11603103,Dayeun,"I stayed at Dirk & Jaq's place for one night   before catching an early morning bus to Vancouver. Overall, it was a great stay. It is very close (2 min walk) to the link light rail that takes you from or to the airport. Also, if anyone is taking the bolt bus to go to Vancouver after your stay like I did, this is the place to stay! This place is closer to the bolt bus stop than any other hotels/airbnb places in Seattle. 

Dirk&Jaq's loft was spacious, clean, quiet, and there were lots of heating and lighting. It doesn't have a closet except for a wall-mounted hanger. It was ok for me but people who will stay for long-term might have to consider. The bed was comfortable and and of course had new bed sheets! The shared bathroom and kitchen were also clean and nice. I will definitely stay here next time I have to find a place to stay in Seattle."
208356,10059841,2014-01-28,6416589,Adam And Arthur,"This spot is a no-brainer. Book it already. Clean, quiet, private, conveniently located - with extremely friendly and helpful hosts - this is what Airbnb should be made of.  Dirk and Jaq have this place dialed in. Such a comfy bed, wireless, fridge access, spacious bathroom, cable tv. What else do you need. A short 20 minute walk to Pike Place Market. TONS of delicious sushi options right outside your door.  Will definitely be booking again."
208356,10087767,2014-01-29,3681539,Hugo,"Dirk and Jaq's studio spaces are wonderful places to stay. I met Jaq and she was lovely, even though I was very tired. I booked here very last minute and they were exceptionally accommodating to my needs, allowing me to drop off my bag before check in, and being in message contact the whole time. The studio itself is immaculately cleaned, and the bed was awesome (firm but with memory foam). The location was perfect for me as the Bolt Bus stop is literally a block away. You can easily walk into Downtown- to Pike place and beyond. Also some very cool coffee cafés and galleries nearby which are mentioned in the welcome pack. If I return to Seattle I will be staying here! "
208356,10110193,2014-01-31,4196470,Nicholas,"Dirk and Jaq's space was a great base for our brief visit to Seattle.  The building is incredibly close to the King Street train station, which was one of the reasons we chose to stay there.  On top of that, the loft space was extremely clean and exactly as pictured.  Due to differing schedules, I did not meet Jaq in person, but she was an excellent host, going out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed for our time (including loaning us a phone charger after we lost ours).  I look forward to returning sometime to check out all the contemporary art galleries in the area.  The bed was cozy and very comfortable, tucked up at the top of the ladder stairs!  "
208356,10184605,2014-02-04,11383820,Leela,"Great place to stay! Loved everything! It was so easy to get to everything King Street station, Light rail from the Airport, and Downtown. Cute little cafe up the road and restaurants all around. My room was clean and so cozy as was the bathroom! I would definitely stay here again. Jaq and Dirk were so easy to contact and got back to me pretty much instantly! Loved it thank you so much! "
208356,10210503,2014-02-06,11167615,Ryan,"My stay in this gorgeous loft was the highlight of my Seattle trip by far! These lofts offer privacy and comfort like no other. Why bother going to a hotel when you can get the joy of urban living just a short walk away from all that Seattle has to offer. 
If you are a traveller who prefers not to have to be buddying with your host your entire stay (introverts, don't be ashamed), or would prefer your own private space, this may just be ideal. Don't misunderstand,  Jaq did come by to check on my arrival and give me the run down, and assured me that she and dirk were only a phone call away, but outside of their all encompassing guidebook, you should find yourself needing very little. Would stay again!

Also, fun tip: Fuji restaurant, located directly across from the entrance to the building has a delicious happy hour and excellent sushi offerings."
208356,10261506,2014-02-10,10715098,Brian,"I had a wonderful stay at Dirk And Jaq's -- the room had everything I needed (except a box of tissues!)  Perfectly clean and tidy and with all the amenities and privacy you'd want.  The building is a quick walk from downtown (and easily accessed via the Light Rail from the airport) and the restaurants nearby were incredible.  

I'd love to stay here the next time I'm in town!"
208356,10328409,2014-02-13,2109448,Yannick,"Great place in a very fun part of town, clean and well organized.  I just wish the windows would have a bit more sound proofing – don't forget your ear plugs."
208356,10392577,2014-02-17,6430627,Gillian,"Stayed at D&J's for 2 nights. The space is exactly as shown in the photos. The location couldn't have been better—it's within walking distance to the Pioneer Sq and many cool shops & eateries. Both mornings I walked to a nearby coffee shop recommended by the hosts and enjoyed great coffee with my breakfast. The Union Station and the Amtrack Stations are literally 5 mins walk away. There are actually 2 bathrooms (one with shower, one without) so I never have to wait for the washroom. If I were to pick something negative, I'd say the floor in the unit is concrete and there is no central heat. It can quite cold in the winter but the space heater was enough for me. Also, I hear people coming in & out throughout the night, although I hear them only when I fall in & out of sleep. The place is very quiet the other time."
208356,10489648,2014-02-21,2539446,Lavinia,"Really clean, simple and nicely done for a studio transformed into a living space! Enjoyed the bed up the ladder, felt like a kid again sleeping on a bunk bed. (watch for your head ;)) Location was great, we walked every where. And had the pleasure to meet Jaq upon our arrival, very friendly!"
208356,10532306,2014-02-24,264923,Tracy,"Really great place to stay in Seattle. Super clean, right next to the International District station, and has the most COMFY bed ever!! 

There were quite a few artists around during the day and they were all very friendly. 

"
208356,10737637,2014-03-05,2257969,Katie,"The space was great: clean, comfortable, and in a an awesome location (if we hadn't been staying here, I might not have gotten to spend much time in the international district). I really appreciated all the little guidelines about the heaters, towels, what supplies to use, etc. Everything was clearly communicated. When our travels were delayed, Dirk and Jaq offered help and advice, and they checked in a few times throughout the trip to see if we needed anything or had questions. I will definitely recommend this spot to friends who are coming to Seattle. For us, it was much nicer than staying right downtown. There were interesting coffeeshops and great restaurants (the bahn mi at Sub Sand and sushi at Maneki were especially memorable) within a block or two, and it was easy to figure out both walking and bus routes to the convention center, at which I was attending a writing conference. I was so much happier than I would've been at an overpriced hotel near the convention! While I wish we could have met you both, it was nice to meet Jaq and I really appreciated the excellent stay in Seattle. Thank you."
208356,10803101,2014-03-08,4070914,Erin,"Dirk & Jaq have thought of EVERYTHING you would need as a guest. Not only is their place nice, clean and convenient, but we really appreciated their recommendations for local restaurants, art galleries, and businesses. They were super timely about responding to questions, and went above and beyond to make sure we were happy and safe. "
208356,11036405,2014-03-17,13029288,Erica,"This was a great spot to stay in. Very close to downtown Seattle and parking was super easy. There are also a lot of places to eat, we found a pho hoa three blocks away. The hosts were great, they have thought of everything you need as a traveler like towels and a folder with restaurants and maps. I will definitely recommend this place.  "
208356,11097360,2014-03-20,12523197,Xiao,"This is absolutely a wonderful place to stay! And it  is located in a very convenient neighborhood with food, market, transportation, and everything!"
208356,11293675,2014-03-28,5244681,Gabriela,"I am super thankful that I was able to stay at Dirk and Jaq's place in Seattle.  I had an unplanned trip to Seattle so needed to find accommodation within a short amount of time.  They replied to my request within a few hours and provided me with all the instructions I needed to access the loft.

The place is located in a great neighborhood within walking distance of the many great things the city has to offer - I only wish I could have stayed a few days longer.

I highly recommend this location - the attention to detail is great and communication with Dirk and Jaq was super - nothing left to the wind!

thank you for everything!!!

Gabriela"
208356,11399069,2014-04-01,2592211,Joelle And James,"We were only able to stay for a short night, but we found the artist loft to be very comfortable, conveniently located, and equipped with just what we needed. Communication with Dirk and Jaq was pleasant and easy. We would happily stay here again. "
208356,11442017,2014-04-02,3260057,Alex,"Great place. Clean, comfortable and private. They were thorough and clear about policies, checking and checking out. It's close to great food and walking distance to downtown. I would definitely return to stay here."
208356,11645405,2014-04-10,1110276,Helen,"Lovely location, within walking distance to downtown and waterfront. Large and cozy room and bed was super comfortable. Easy to get to and find, especially if one does not rent a car. Would love to stay there again if I am in Seattle. "
208356,11704877,2014-04-12,14003589,Rachel,"Although our stay was extremely short, this place fit the bill!  The space is unique and the room was clean and very functional.  The bed is lofted and very comfortable.  The bathroom is down the hall and it is very large and clean.  This was a fun and unique place to spend the night and I wouldn't hesitate to come back.  Although I never met Dirk & Jaq, they were very helpful and excellent communicators!   "
208356,11752076,2014-04-14,3686947,GiNell,"Dirk and Jaq's loft was a fantastic place to stay during our trip to Seattle. The room was clean and quiet, and had an amazingly comfortable memory foam mattress. Food in the area is delicious, including what's said to be the best sushi in the city. We were able to walk most places (Underground Tour, Pike's Market, lots of restaurants and bars), but when we did take the bus it was easy and required very little additional walking. I recommend buying an Orca card if you plan on taking the bus a lot--makes things really simple."
208356,11797277,2014-04-15,5786194,Gina,"Great loft in a great location. The room was very clean and it was functional, located in a very convenient neighborhood. I'd definitely recommend it!"
208356,12077811,2014-04-22,3120827,Leon,"Jaq's apartment is so cool. This is our first time to stay in a loft. The whole area was so clean and bright. The bed on the second floor was so cosy.
We talked a little with Jaq, she was so nice and so kind. She told us that on sundays the parking rule in Seattle, and shared the feelings she thought about Seattle underground tour. All that made us a good journey in Seattle.
The place is near to the bus and train stop, transport is so convinient.
If one day you travel in Seattle, this is a good place to stay."
208356,12331401,2014-04-29,12162346,Cathy,"Clean, quiet, and convenient! Would definitely stay there again! "
208356,12494108,2014-05-04,5367096,Lars,"It was a nice stay at Jaqs & Dirks Loft. It was quiet, clean and central in the town. thanks for staying. Recommendable. Best Whishes."
208356,12605571,2014-05-06,4854635,David,"Dirk & Jaq's place was awesome! They were extremely easy to communicate with even before we arrived. Everything in the loft space is so well organized and clean. The place itself is in a great location because it is so close to everything that you'd want to see in central Seattle and it's extremely easy to jump on the highway.

Bed was comfortable, towels were great, all shower products were wonderful and the kitchen was spacious and organized. We also got to meet Jaq for a few minutes and she was extremely sweet.

I would recommend this place to friends and we will definitely stay here again when we visit Seattle--which will most likely be very soon. "
208356,12672446,2014-05-07,13013228,Charlie,"Loft is in a good location, in a quiet and safe building. The whole place was clean and tidy and although we only stayed one night, but it was great for our needs - comfy bed, TV, fridge/freezer etc. Would recommend for those who don't necessarily require extensive cooking facilities."
208356,13037210,2014-05-18,13831611,Maja,"This was a wonderful and enjoyable stay. Dirk and Jaq were wonderful hosts, very accommodating! I would def. stay there again...will also recommend it to all my friends. "
208356,13066533,2014-05-19,5149916,Jacqueline,Dennis and I returned to the Artist Loft to a different apartment and it was as nice as the first one we stayed in. Once again we had everything we needed and we had a great night's sleep which was important to us.
208356,13150361,2014-05-20,14175306,Heather,"Loved staying at jac and dirk's! The space is really well set up in a great location in Seattle. The bed is unbelievably comfortable and bathrooms are clean and well stocked. We took their suggestions for food and had some great meals. 
Thanks!"
208356,13226473,2014-05-22,15410718,Ian,A fantastic space close to downtown and managed by great people. Lots of nice restaurants nearby and close to Pioneer square. Well laid out with a lot of thought about the needs of guests.
208356,13401715,2014-05-27,10122018,Lance,"The place was outstanding.  Enjoyed every minute of it.  Dirk and Jaq leave enough notes in room, kitchen, and bathroom to address any questions or concerns. Above all else, they were most kind to leave an umbrella in the room for a visitor's use - do all the little things to make for a terrific stay. "
208356,13494649,2014-05-28,828390,Paco,"Dirk and Jaq were so helpful for my arrangements to stay in Seattle. What a great loft, and the location is outstanding."
208356,13567490,2014-05-31,13560967,Lynda,"We never met the hosts but when we had questions or needed something, they responded very quickly to our emails.  They were very welcoming.  "
208356,13675700,2014-06-02,14601003,Mike," This place is really great.  I did not have any direct contact with the Dirk & Jaq, but none was needed.  All the information you need is instructed, as you go. Be it by email, notes, etc...
  If you're coming in by train, going to either of the ball parks, this is the perfect Airbnb location.  I saw people parking and walking further away for the game.  You're that close!  The sushi place downstairs was awesome and affordable too.  "
208356,13973818,2014-06-09,15499156,Judith,Very cute and convenient room close to King Street Station. This was out first airbnb experience and Dirk and Jaq made it very easy by providing lots of information ahead of time and through notes at the building. Thanks!
208356,14096155,2014-06-11,13713887,Gerard,Place worked great. Clean and quiet. Thanks Dirk and Jaq
208356,14222855,2014-06-15,13148573,Mika,"Dirk  & Jaq's artist loft was so clean, quite, and cozy. I felt as if I was at home. 
I was in Seattle to see the baseball games. It was very close to the stadium area and safe.
Why not?"
208356,14284578,2014-06-16,1227867,Noel,"Exactly as pictured/advertised.  I came up from Portland to see a few baseball games.  Since I was taking the train, this place fit the bill perfectly.  It's a few blocks from the train station, and maybe a 10 minute walk from SafeCo field.  It's not a place where you'd want to stay for an extended period of time (which they don't allow anyway), but perfect for one or two nights.  "
208356,14473986,2014-06-20,15263955,Maria,"This was our first experience with airbnb and it was a good one.  The hosts were accessible, very informed and responded to questions promptly.  We got to meet Dirk, he was very nice and made us feel welcomed.  The space was great and exactly as it was described on the site.  The neighborhood was very central to public transportation which made site seeing easy.  The one difficulty about the neighborhood was finding a breakfast place!"
208356,14534548,2014-06-21,16688482,Brie,We had a great time. Very easy and next to amazing restaurants. We could walk everywhere which was very convenient. Definitely recommend. 
208356,14920155,2014-06-29,16064353,Nathan,"Dirk and Jaq have a gem of a place in the Int'l district. This was our first time using airbnb and they made it wonderful. While we didn't get to meet them in person, communication through the app was a breeze. Will definitely stay again next time we're in Seattle."
208356,14964409,2014-06-30,15101594,Brittany,"Clean, excellently located and walkable for most of downtown.  We would absolutely stay here again! Jaq even allowed us to store our things for a few hours since our train didn't leave until 2."
208356,15140282,2014-07-03,11092534,Xiaoyu,"Dirk & Jaq's place is super clean and it's looks exactly same as the picture they upload. It's not that hard for me to find a free parking space in front of the building. Besides, they are really good host. They response from Airbnb app very quick. All in all it's a very pleasant stay."
208356,15171371,2014-07-04,8476285,Kira,"We had a short (one night) but very nice stay at the loft. Dirk and Jaq messaged us when the room was ready early and we were able to easily pick up the keys on site when we arrived. The room was clean and was as described, and the bed was comfortable. There was a booklet of information (with a couple suggestions for nearby coffee spots, etc.) on the desk. There was an air conditioner in the room to keep it cool, though we turned it off overnight since the fan was quite loud. We would stay here again!"
208356,15221664,2014-07-05,14814330,Steven,"Great location. Interesting airbnb experience here
"
208356,15389727,2014-07-08,11206434,Brianna,"Jaq quickly responded to every communication we sent and was always flexible and accommodating to our shifting travel plans. The artist loft was comfortable, clean, and amazingly well located to the public transportation. All of our needs were met--from extra blankets to AC to shower toiletries. I highly recommend this space for anyone who craves privacy and a comfortable get-away when exploring a new city. "
208356,15511738,2014-07-10,16114731,Eunchong,"정말 편안했습니다. 방도 괜찮고 조용하고 시설도 좋고, 다만 화장실이 따로있어서 조금 불편했고 방안에 신발을 신고 들어가서 한국인에게 불편할 수 있습니다."
208356,15533616,2014-07-11,3782347,Gasser,"Le logement est comme sur les photos et bien placé par rapport au transport en commun.
Dans le livre d'instruction Dirk and Jaq ont laissé des bonnes adresses.
Le quartier le soir est pas très recommandable.
"
208356,15745390,2014-07-15,785166,Melissa,"This loft was exactly as expected: it was very clean and the accommodations were excellent. It was great to have access to the kitchenette and though the bathrooms/shower were down the hall, there was never a wait. The location is ideal as it is a mere two blocks from Amtrak/Bolt Bus. Being in the international district and Pioneer Square is fantastic too, since there are many new restaurants and shops and you are away from the craziness of downtown and Pike Place Market. However, it is only a short walk if you want to get to those destinations and there are many transportation options close by, like Car2Go, ZipCar or public transit. I would definitely stay here again!"
208356,15956311,2014-07-19,12897824,Michelle,"We loved this loft. Great space, nice shared bathroom, and very organized process with detailed - and very responsive - communication from Dirk & Jaq. The location is convenient to everything we wanted to see, and there were many kitchen/bathroom extras available for us to use. Everything was just as promised in the listing. And when I messed up the Direct TV access, Dirk popped in to fix it at my convenience, exceeding my expectations.

The neighborhood was bustling at all hours, and the very short walk to and from public transportation access usually involved interaction with street/homeless people. I'm sure this is the case in any downtown  lodging, but I found it unsettling at times. However, the loft was a wonderful space to return to each evening after the craziness of a day in the city and dealing with the throng of other summer tourists. 

If you're committed to staying in the downtown area, this is a fantastic property!"
208356,16077618,2014-07-22,11247732,Sarah,"Dirk and Jaqs loft was great, the moment we arrived we were completely happy with the place! The concept of the room is great, we had plenty of room, a couch, a desk and a bed and pillows which were both comfortable and clean! The bathroom down the hall was also clean and very convenient. The directions from the airport to the loft were easy to follow and getting the key wasn't a problem! The place is in walking distance to all that we wanted to do and the area was safe enough coming home at night. Would happily stay here again!"
208356,16335755,2014-07-26,12200127,Joe,"What a great little place this is. A short walk from downtown, close to major public transport, clean and comfortable; Dirk & Jaq make it really easy. The room is very economical with space but that's a good thing. Shared bathroom/shower but that's clean and in good working order too. We were lucky enough to meet Jaq and her dog Teddy. She's super friendly and super helpful, he's just super cute! Not that we needed anything, but nothing seemed to be too much trouble - communication was great. A great setup indeed and highly recommended."
208356,16621769,2014-07-30,1723521,Anahita,"This was a nice spot for our brief stay! We loved the downtown location and the clean, bright feel of the loft space."
208356,16678726,2014-07-31,1615090,Jennifer,"Jaq and Dirk's loft is one of my favorite spaces in Seattle.  A wonderful space, great central location, and especially wonderful hosts!  "
208356,16781091,2014-08-02,7903201,Michelle,"What a fantastic space! No detail overlooked, and everything was perfect. The bed had to be one of the most comfortable beds I've slept in on vacation, ever. The system of check in was flawless, as well. Also, I had no trouble finding a parking space, right across the street. Excellent experience all around! Thank you!"
208356,17085642,2014-08-06,13416006,Samuel,"Place was wonderful. Very clean and everything well-organized. Didn't get to meet the hosts, but were very accessible by email/text and the key drop worked perfectly. Place is just a few blocks from train station and easy walk to everything you'd want to do in downtown."
208356,17117558,2014-08-07,18491429,Kristen,"Great location, only a short walk to Safeco to watch the baseball game, very convenient. The loft was very clean and looked exactly like the pictures. We were able to find free parking easily just a block away. We will definitely stay again!"
208356,17332904,2014-08-11,12859820,Mitzi,"This was our first Airbnb experience.  The space was clean, comfortable and super convenient to all of the sights.  We are looking forward to one more night there before catching the train at King Street Station.  Dirk and Jac are easy to reach and very friendly and helpful."
208356,17442784,2014-08-12,16787242,Maeve,What a wonderful place to stay. The building is in a great place in the international district and within walking distance of anything you could want to do in Seattle! The bathroom and kitchenette are clean and convenient. The loft itself was quaint and so comfortable after a long day of exploring. We slept like babies in the luxurious bed. We can't wait to plan our next stay in this loft.  
208356,17559934,2014-08-14,16051062,Kevin,"A perfect first Airbnb experience. Awesome room, awesome location, awesome hosts. Will definitely try to stay here every time I visit Seattle."
208356,17617485,2014-08-15,14702967,Grace,"The room was exactly as described and shown in the pictures! We easily found free parking right outside the doorsteps. Facilities were extremely clean and when we arrived at 4pm, Jaq was in the room making sure that everything was in order. I would definitely stay here again! "
208356,17815705,2014-08-18,12859820,Mitzi,Our second visit to Dirk and Jac's studio.  We again found it clean and comfy.  We were happy to meet Jac this time and sorry to have missed Dirk.  This has to be one of the best places to stay when visiting Seattle.
208356,17952786,2014-08-19,17323452,Daniel,"Dirk and Jaq were great hosts. Their communication was great, including public transit information. The loft was very clean and tidy. Their lockbox system made it easy to get our key any time. They allowed us to drop off luggage early in the main room which is monitored by a security camera, and that was really helpful for us. We would definitely stay in this location again."
208356,18017221,2014-08-20,10089095,Chenlu,It was a very nice stay at this cool modern comfortable loft. Jaq was so nice to give us a lot of tips & helpful notes. Thank you so much!
208356,18076835,2014-08-21,16290546,Lara,"Really great little place. Convienent acess to building, clean, confortable and cozy! We only stayed the one night, but It was great. I would definitely recommend the space. Thanks! "
208356,18296971,2014-08-25,11580025,Jackson,"Dirk and Jaq were very professional and seasoned hosts.  Their attention to detail and use of helpful notes around 519 studios shows that they have considered every potential guest concern.  The facilities were very clean and the artists in residence were friendly and courteous.  We enjoyed meeting Jaq and Dirk (and their dog) in the building, and we appreciated their many helpful recommendations for the neighborhood.  "
208356,18406803,2014-08-26,12598664,Corrie,"We arrived after 4PM and were gone before 6:30AM the next day, so we did not get to meet Dirk or Jaq, and we were not in the room all that much, since we wanted to see as much of the area as possible in the very little time we had. Dirk and Jaq gave us stellar instructions for everything we needed to know about their space, from getting there to how to use everything in the loft, and there's a lovely binder on the desk with maps and local tips. The space was clean and modern, and was honestly the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. We had a 7AM train to catch so the location could not have been better. Thank you for hosting us!"
208356,18526167,2014-08-28,15166711,Riccardo,"L'esperienza presso il loft di Dirk & Jaq è stata molto piacevole: tutto corrisponde a quanto indicato nell'annuncio, tutto molto funzionale e ordinato. Il quartiere è molto bello e abbastanza tranquillo (diciamo in linea con il resto della downtown di Seattle).
Ci sono vicinissimi all'appartamento due ristoranti giapponesi ottimi, un hotel/bar storico, fermate dei bus per tutte le direzioni e fermata del tram veloce per l'aeroporto, tutto a 5 minuti a piedi.
In 15 minuti a piedi si arriva a Pike Market e al Safeco Field.
Dirk e Jaq sono molto disponibili sia di persona che a comunicare tramite il servizio di messaggi di airbnb."
208356,18621409,2014-08-29,17848990,Brittany,This was my first Air BnB experience and it was a great one. Everything was as described and it was a lovely place to spend the night. Dirk and Jaq made sure every detail was covered- from towels to maps of Seattle. I would highly recommend this loft and would be glad to stay here again. Perfect location coming from the Bolt Bus and to the sports arenas. 
208356,18978998,2014-09-04,12868604,Gene,"Great place, convenient location. Definitely would repeat the stay next time in Seattle. "
208356,19053375,2014-09-05,9153677,Kristin,"Dirk and Jaq were very accommodating and helpful hosts.  We arrived earlier than expected and they showed up within minutes to let us int our room and drop our stuff off.  They had great suggestions on where to go for food nearby and just made things really easy.  The accommodations were great too.  Very private, clean, and simple with an extremely comfortable bed-- I believe it was one of those fancy memory foam mattresses.  LOVELY.  The location couldn't have been more convenient for us-- just a few blocks to the train station, sports stadiums, and all the best asian food in town.  We intend to make this our regular place when we go to Seattle in the future."
208356,19325026,2014-09-10,18835699,William,"Everything was fine -- arrangements for arrival and departure went smoothly, the room was comfortable and clean, and it's close to the train station and within walking distance of main tourist attractions .  I would stay there again when visiting Seattle."
208356,19410977,2014-09-12,17902306,Su Nandar,"Our first airbnb experience was a great one, thanks to Jaq & Dirk's beautiful room! It's exactly as shown in the photo. The loft is really clean & we really enjoyed our stay.

And the place is like 2 min walk away from the International District Subway / light rail station. It was such a convenient location for us to explore Seattle with public transport. There's great coffee 2 doors down from the loft and great Chinese food around the corner as well! 

Jaq & Dirk take care of their guests really well too. They anticipated your needs &  provided everything from towels, hair dryer & toiletries to cups & bowls. 

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle! "
208356,19514617,2014-09-14,3354640,Andrew,Had a great stay!

208356,19723695,2014-09-17,5191675,Tiffany Elizabeth,"Wonderful stay! Super clean, private, and conveniently located. Ran into Jaq briefly and she was really nice and helpful throughout. I appreciate all the communications re: house rules, the surrounds, and even the directions from the airport via public transport. Would definitely come back again for another stay. Many thanks! "
208356,19817667,2014-09-19,3752825,Del,"We had a pleasant stay at Dirk and Jaq's rental. It's in a good location, close to the Downtown/Pike Place Market area. We had a chance to meet Jaq, who was very nice and offered themselves if we needed any help. Overall, the rental meets all of your basic necessities, was very clean, and includes two umbrellas you can borrow in case you get stuck in the rainy Seattle weather! "
208356,20005369,2014-09-22,15766863,James,"This studio flat was brilliant for our three days in Seattle. It's 3 mins walk from International District tram station making it very well connected to Sea/Tac; the bus station and downtown. Or you can walk ten mins down to the seafront where the piers are.
The room was spotless, comfortable
and easy to relax in. It had all
I needed.
The bathroom again was spotless and functional so it as ways to keep clean. There was tons of shampoo etc products for guests, hairdryer and iron.
I would definitely stay again and recommend to others.
Although we didn't meet Dirk and Jaq, I felt like we did because they were great hosts and were bang up to speed with their communication and the process for staying there.
A very tight run ship.

208356,20412696,2014-09-29,4205197,Cristina And Steve,"If you want to stay near Pioneer Square, this is a good choice. Very clean, good shower and Wi-Fi. Hosts communicated well by email. Location is near lots of bus routes, 2 blocks from light rail and short walk to Pioneer Square. Short walk to Wing Museum which is well worth visiting. There are lots of homeless people in neighborhood but it did not feel unsafe. "
208356,20631614,2014-10-02,1778265,Maggie,"Dirk & Jaq's place was the perfect launch pad for a day in Seattle! Clean, quiet and central. A $5 cab to the nightlife at Capitol Hill or a beautiful 25 min walk through downtown Seattle to pike place market. Be sure to grab pastries and coffee at Fuji Bakery just around the corner to fuel your adventure! Thanks Jaq & Dirk. "
208356,20819796,2014-10-06,12863397,Eli,This is a great location.  All of downtown Seattle is right there.

208356,21423943,2014-10-17,1552178,Guilherme,The loft was beautiful and very easy to get to from King Station. Jaq was very helpful on the way giving me tips on Seattle and how to get to her place. It was a short taxi drive to Pike Place Market and other not so far from Belltown either. I had a really good time here.

The pictures on the wall and careful and detailed guide book and momoes were just perfect for us. Definitely recommended.
208356,21941071,2014-10-27,4784443,Kevin,"As I reached the front door of DIrk and Jaq's studio, I opened up my inbox and easily found the instructions to enter the building. Once I entered the door to our loft, I was greeted with useful information if I had any issues with the place. They provided a clean room with towels, a comfy bed with clean sheets, and nice furniture to sit on. I also met Jaq right before we checked out. Jaq gave us every useful tips on how much time we should give to catch out flight at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Thanks again for the advice, Jaq!

 I'd definitely recommend booking a room with them."

208356,22825087,2014-11-16,19407904,Omar,"Everything anyone could need was provided.  Although it was compact, it was cozy and comfortable.

We really enjoyed our stay and highly recommend booking this place for your stay."
208356,22977843,2014-11-19,237074,Penny,"This is a great place to stay. The location in Chinatown/International District and the arts district is fun.

We liked that there was a variety of green, black, and herbal tea available in the kitchen, including organic options. The location was perfect, within walking distance of Benaroya Hall, lots of good restaurants, and the best bubble tea in Seattle. We enjoyed meeting Jaq and had a lovely stay."

Didn't meet Dirk, but did have a chance to meet Jaq.  She was incredibly friendly and very accommodating to my needs."
208356,23681773,2014-12-08,7673572,Leonora,"Accommodations were as described and excellent. 2nd time staying at the loft. Clean, comfy, and cozy for 1 or 2 people. There's something wonderful about watching the night traffic go by as I fall asleep. Don't worry there's a window guard to prevent any accidental falls out of the bed. If that's not your thing, simply close the blinds. Already thinking about a third stay."
208356,23861105,2014-12-13,18799094,Alana,"I absolutely loved my stay in the International District. The loft is in a very convenient location, with a very short walk to the Light Rail station, many downtown buses and the ferry port is only a 10-15 minute walk away.

As for the loft itself, the bed and the room were very comfortable. Access to wifi was great. The communal kitchen area and bathrooms were very clean and everyone in the building was respectful of leaving the room as you left it. All in all, I would totally stay here again."
208356,23939366,2014-12-15,9918673,Karissa,This place was perfect. It's within a mile to all the major sites and right down the street from the train. My friend and I had a great experience and the place is as accurate as its listing. 
208356,24012144,2014-12-16,15622469,Claire,It's a great location! The station is three minutes walk and there are plenty of restaurants nearby. The room is clean and everything is very organized. Really nice vibe:)
208356,24024567,2014-12-17,23075063,Per,Great experience. Wonderful accommodations. Had a perfect experience.
208356,24068186,2014-12-18,15581338,Teresa,"Dirk and Jaq's place was conveniently located in International District, hop and a skip away from major attractions and public transit. While we were only there for one night, we had a very comfortable stay - the loft is definitely recommended for single or a couple of travelers seeking for a clean, comfortable stay right in the heart of Seattle. "
208356,24138116,2014-12-21,22931091,Crystal Weijia,3 nights! awesome! the place is right next to the light rail station and it is convenient to go around the city by train or bus. The place is clean and quiet! highly recommend
208356,24364667,2014-12-27,11137661,Riann,"We had a great stay at Dirk & Jaq's loft. Unfortunately we were only passing through for a night - we would have loved to have stayed longer. Loft is as described, good location and clean. "
208356,24506979,2014-12-29,25073837,Sandra,Perfect! This was our first airbnb experience and it was so so easy and comfortable. Hosts are great and easy to get in touch with. Everything was as described and a  perfect location for a Seahawks game. Will definitely book here again. Thanks!
208356,24592013,2014-12-31,7361571,Laura,Dirk and Jaq were great host. Even though we didn't get to meet them communication was excellent. It was a great experience for our first time in Seattle. The place was clean and cozy and the bed was comfortable. There was a set of keys for the entrance and the individual rooms which made us feel safe. The loft is perfectly located near a light rail for easy transportation access. Highly recommended place! Thank you so much for everything Dirk and Jaq.
208356,24830973,2015-01-03,18106017,Eric,It was great staying here. My girlfriend and I really enjoyed the privacy that this Airbnb offered. 
208356,24915509,2015-01-04,21016987,Tiffany,Great location and place
208356,25069885,2015-01-05,24196671,Jason,"Very clean and well organized, will recommend to friends!"
208356,25124947,2015-01-07,21022589,Roger,"I had an excellent experience at Dirk and Jaq's place, and I highly recommend this place to travelers seeking a convenient location to explore downtown Seattle. The loft was impeccably clean, well lit, and well furnished. There is no bathroom in the bedroom itself, but there are two of them in a common area just out of the door (one of them with a marvelous shower), where you will also find a full kitchen with shelf and fridge space reserved for guests. I didn't run into other guests during my stay there, and had the place pretty much to myself.

Communication was also excellent. Dirk and Jaq were very open and very responsive, and clearly care a lot about their guests' comfort.

As you can see in the picture, you have to climb a ladder to get to your bed. It's really no problem, but it may present difficulties for guests above a certain age or with locomotion problems. The couch is pretty comfortable though.

You'll be within walking distance of downtown Seattle and really close to two important train stations. Amtrak buses and trains to Vancouver and other destinations leave from two blocks away. There are also good restaurants nearby. Dirk and Jaq's recommendations, which you will find in a folder in your bedroom, are worth heeding.

In short, highly recommended.

208356,25268107,2015-01-11,20952519,Rachelle,"Our room was clean, organized, and exactly as pictured. Parking can be a little tough around this area especially if there's a sporting event going on, as it is located right by the stadium. Aside from that, the loft is in a very nice area. Would recommend staying here! "
208356,25329464,2015-01-12,148408,Adam,"Though I was only passing through Seattle, I really enjoyed staying at Jaq and Dirk's artist's studio. Affordable, clean, and comfortable. Great location in Chinatown, close to both Amtrak and the Link light rail. I didn't meet Dirk or Jaq, but Jaq was very communicative and the many helpful notes around the space made navigating the space easy.  Would definitely stay again! "
208356,25424987,2015-01-15,5284021,Sonialy,"Staying in Dirk and Jaq's loft added to my Seattle experience. The place is so cozy and well put, I wish I could live there! Not to mention it's very conveniently located  if you're exploring downtown Seattle, and we didn't have to take any public transportation. I got to meet Jaq, who was very welcoming as well. Even though it was a very short stay, it was well enjoyed. "
208356,25538824,2015-01-19,22931813,James,"The host has a great system for getting the keys, clean room, nice bed. Super cheap and private. close to alot of great sites. I didn't get to meet my host but i really enjoyed this place. "
208356,25650852,2015-01-21,26423826,William,I had a great experience. It was my first time in Seattle. It was really close to everything from the stadium to pikes market. The room was very spacious and had a very comfortable bed. The whole place was really clean and very accommodating. The next time I am town I would definitely stay here again. 
208356,25681243,2015-01-23,2263224,Marion,"The place was very clean, and everything was supplied! One of my best airbnb! They were very attentive and helpful! And the location was perfect. "
208356,25814570,2015-01-26,4046935,Scarlett,"Jaq and Dirk are really great hosts! They thought of everything in advance and pass on the information through detailed messages, notes and guidebooks. Had no trouble finding the place, checking-in, dropping luggage, finding stuff that came in handy like hairdryer and other necessities. The place is classic, clean, safe and within walking distance to chinatown. Had the pleasure meeting the hospitable hostess and adorable puppy Teddy. It was a really pleasant stay."
208356,25932456,2015-01-30,12149838,Justin,"I stayed at one of Dirk & Jaq's loft apartments for a week and it was perfect.  Clean, quiet, comfortable, good wifi, and a great vibe in a very cool part of town.   Sushi next door was amazing and the food in the neighborhood was a highlight for the whole trip.  Also hit up imperial foot massage on my last day to unwind and that was a good decision too =)  lots of neat art galleries around which were fun to browse (the apartment is actually in an artist loft complex).  I met Jaq around the building but they were generally very hands off beyond ensuring I was happy and comfortable.   They have a helpful binder in the room with suggestions to check out in the neighborhood, I personally recommend Salumi for the best sandwiches ever (lots of pork fyi).

Overall 5 stars as an airbnb."
208356,25971577,2015-01-31,16051062,Kevin,Great stay again. The location is excellent and the accommodations are great. We will definitely stay at Dirk & Jaq's whenever we are in Seattle.

208356,26340236,2015-02-09,15095919,Viktoria,"I arrived at the Artist Loft way ahead of the check in time and, after a battle with the key box - my own fault, I was able to leave my luggage in the kitchen to free myself to city exploration and fun. I was initially concerned about leaving my laptop in the kitchen with no place to ""hide"" it or lock it up from the other guests in the apartment complex, but it worked out very well.  

Although the room, as well as the common area (kitchen and the bathrooms) seemed very modest, I was pleasantly surprised by the wide selection of bathroom supplies and the addition of small, but pleasant details to the room: a bathrobe, a clothes hanger, etc. Everything was clean and convenient. 

Jaq ad Dirk not only answered my messages very fast during the trip planning period, but were also friendly and helpful once I arrived. "
208356,26359345,2015-02-10,25702071,Anne,This place was very conveniently located to the train station and since we were only in town for one night and we're traveling by bus that was very helpful. Jaq was very helpful and nice when we would run see her in the building. We would definitely reccomend this place.

Loved that it was easy to locate the keys ourselves and entering and exiting was not a problem. Dirk and Jaq left a lot of tourist guides and maps, as well as provided a helpful guidebook for guests! Loved the recommendations, and the Japanese restaurants in the area were awesome :D"

208356,29062879,2015-04-03,29416742,Elvia,My daughter and I really enjoyed our stay in Seattle while we toured Seattle Universities.  The loft location was within what felt like a five minute walk from the train station.  This was fantastic as we planned on walking a lot!  The loft itself was wonderfully simplistic. We would have liked to meet Dirk and Jaq during our stay but our schedules were off.  We are looking forward to planning another trip this year and look forward to meeting Dirk and Jaq on our next visit!
208356,29274100,2015-04-06,366776,Beau,"This place is great! Very clean and everything you need for a great Seattle trip. Close to the LINK, downtown, great Chinatown restaurants, hip foodie spots, galleries. My gf was concerned about the shared hall bathroom but it ended up being a fun flashback to our dorm days. Again, this place feels so new and clean. "
208356,29741355,2015-04-12,17224667,Erika,"I came to Seattle for a  5-day conference, and since I knew that I wouldn't be spending hardly any time in my room, I didn't want to spend money on a hotel.  Dirk & Jaq's studio is clean, quiet, safe, and exactly as described!  This is the perfect loft for up to two adults.  It is very close to the train and bus station.  I would definitely stay here again for a future Seattle visit/conference!  Jaq was always very helpful and responsive to any questions.   "
208356,30003651,2015-04-15,25280352,Mark,"This location was perfect for us, within walking distance of both the light rail from the airport and the Amtrak station, where we took the train for Vancouver.  Interesting neighborhood, room exactly as described. Bed extremely comfortable, and climbing into and out of loft no problem, even for 60-somethings. Appreciated having a sofa, a desk and ample light and power outlets, as well as wifi. Will definitely recommend to others.
"
208356,30283670,2015-04-20,26764516,Brooke,"Dirk & Jaq's place is a great loft studio. It's cozy, super clean and has all the necessities.  The location is great...just minutes from the sports district and from downtown/pikes place.  
It was quiet and I felt very safe at all times, since I was traveling to a new city alone this was especially comforting.
Dirk & Jaq were also in communication and checked to be sure I was getting around okay and if I needed anything. Which was nice.
I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Dirk & Jaq!!!"
208356,30517974,2015-04-23,30675028,Chia-Chi,The room is extremely clean and nice. Every rule is clearly wrote on notes and posted next to the facility. And the bed is very comfortable.
208356,30862927,2015-04-28,8923922,Kirsten,"The space was everything that we needed for a 4 night stay in Seattle. It's right by the International District and the Link light rail station. We could walk to everything we needed and take a cheap Uber ride to anywhere we wanted to visit.

Despite having tall ceilings, the room is fitted with a heater and radiator that made it nice and toasty very quickly. Every little detail is taken care of; there were plenty of blankets, outlets, glasses, a spare charger, a comfy mattress, band aids, and neosporin for our trip. 

We only bumped into Jaq twice during the whole stay but she was quick to communicate via the airbnb app.

Super hosts! Would definitely recommend!"
208356,31025365,2015-04-30,447599,Michele,I spent 2 nights in Dirk & Jaq loft. Everything went incredibly smoothly and worked out in a fantastic way.

208356,32018769,2015-05-12,16069723,Feroshia,"Thumbs up to Dirk and Jaq for making it really easy to land and get comfortable. The loft was only 2 blocks away from the train/bus station and provided a lovely ""art space"" for me to work on my book. The bed was comfy and the desk perfect for getting down to work. Bonus - I had sushi across the street and was able to find a fun underground food court just blocks away that had some amazingly good and affordable options. "
208356,32163333,2015-05-15,17237942,Martina,"The description of this essential place was accurate. Excellent in terms of location. Many art galleries and restaurants close by. Quiet neighborhood.

We would return later in the weekend for a longer stay, but the lofts are perfectly suited for a weekend getaway in Seattle. "

208356,33138205,2015-05-25,16215445,Lorie,"Staying here felt like my own little Seattle pied-a-terre! The loft space and building were very private and quiet, so traveling in a pair would be fun and ideal.   Only the occasional siren was heard outside, as it's located at the edge of downtown, just blocks to Amtrak and Boltbus. Access to a sparkling clean kitchen and full bath, shared by artist tenants during the day, was very convenient. Delicious Japanese dining steps away! Dirk & Jaq's instructions were clear, simple, and welcoming. Every detail has been thought through---will stay here whenever 2 of us visit Seattle."
208356,33312730,2015-05-26,32281813,Sophia,"We enjoyed our one night stay in Seattle! Dirk & Jaq let us drop off our luggage early to roam the city before checking in.

I got there in the evening, so I tried a famous historical Japanese restaurant nearby, that was amazing experience for me Japanese! The loft is very close to the station, the train and buses are very convenient to get to the business district in only a few minutes. 

I enjoyed the two different types of district in one business trip. Thanks!

Everything was very clean and well kept. Jaq and Dirk made it very easy to communicate if we had any questions. Our intentions were to visit Seattle for the Mariners game, but we ended up seeing so much more of the city because their location is central to everything. Easy to walk everywhere. Will definitely AirBnB here again! :)"

Next to transport links and close enough to the buzz of the City but without the noise. Thanks again to Jaq and Dirk. We would recommend it to anyone young or able. (for the mezzanine) the shared shower and kitchen were not an issue at all, clean and quiet with lots of extras provided. 
We would stay again if ever in Seattle.  "

208356,36257676,2015-06-27,2130808,Jessica,"Jaq and Dirk's loft is just as described. Excellent location, quiet, and everything you need. Easy check in/out process. Highly recommended!"
208356,36360617,2015-06-28,26877145,Jessica,"As my first Airbnb experience I have to say I was impressed with the ease and simplicity of it all. Our hosts were very thorough with the information through email and had a quick response time to any questions asked. We never met in person but conversing with them through email made us feel welcome in the loft. Check in and out was easy. The room itself was very clean and exactly like the pictures showed, the bathroom and kitchen areas were well kept as well. The neighbourhood was conveniently close to the bus and train loop, which made travel easy. We were also in walking distance of the sports stadiums which was a main reason we chose this loft. Overall we had a great experience staying at Dirk and Jaq's place, and would not hesitate to use the space again."
208356,36673300,2015-06-30,15970775,Carla,"So convenient! It took all of five seconds to get from the Bolt bus stop to their place. The room is awesome, with air conditioning, the cutest bed loft (which feels like sleeping in a private and comfortable treehouse), and everything you need from a guidebook to tons of outlets. It feels like staying in a cute and personal hostel. The place is so efficient and prepared for guests. A sign will tell you what to do right when you need it. It's centrally located so you can walk downtown and check out one of the many restaurants or bars they recommend."
208356,37603239,2015-07-08,28469864,Jingjing,"This is such a cute place!!! I didn't get a chance to meet the host but they are ready to response whenever you send messages. This place is safe with all the doors and locks. You can hardly ever feel there are other people living in the same building. Everyone is quiet and respectful. Location here is great since it's near to major attractions (within 15mins drive) and more importantly, it's right next to the best Japanese food I've ever had. And the street parking is not very difficult to find. "
208356,38250191,2015-07-14,27265693,Dylan,We had a great time! Clean and convenient!
208356,38446590,2015-07-15,29917265,Sara,"Nice room, clean, very good location.
Good and secure system with The keys, clear information and good advice About coffee bar etc"
208356,38502889,2015-07-16,34328773,Laura,"Beautiful little loft! I was going to a concert at Century Link and it was perfect walking distance. It's in a great neighborhood. Would absolutely stay her again.

208356,38695553,2015-07-18,29352618,Adriana,My experience here was great! I really liked how everything was clear on house rules and procedures. Everything was laid out very simple. The best part was how close the listing is to LINK light-rail. We really enjoyed the food culture in the area above everything else!
208356,38825343,2015-07-19,8981638,Hwee Sin,"Easy to access the apartment and to drop off bags off early and leave bags for later. Security was good as were the amenities. Neighbourhood was ok, but avoid certain streets closeby. "
208356,39264304,2015-07-22,28548318,Peter,"Great place to spend some nights in Seattle. On the edge of Chinatown and close to the first skyscraper of Seattle. Arriving late at night and going out for some late dinner was somewhat challenging on a Monday night as the neighborhood between the loft (very good) and downtown was a bit tricky. During the day and early evening we did not have any problems like that. The loft itself is very nice and well taken care of. Dirk and jaq made sure we had everything we needed and we felt very comfortable in the loft. Sharing the bathroom was not a problem, there is not a lot of people around when you typically need them. Would surely come back if we ever visit Seattle again."
208356,39727118,2015-07-26,12764581,Priscilla,"Everything was organized and clean. Dirk and Jaq left great tips and instructions for a nice, comfortable stay."
208356,40137675,2015-07-28,37741300,Liam,"Was extremely simple to get the keys, instructions were clear. The loft itself was very clean, and the hosts were very accommodating when I left my sunglasses up in the room after I had left, would definitely book again."
208356,40193146,2015-07-29,24123120,Todd,"Great place, clean easy to get key from. Clean and very comfortable bed!!!  "
208356,40437274,2015-07-31,32525474,Elizabeth,"The artist loft in downtown Seattle was a good experience for our first introduction to AirBnB! The hosts provided excellent communication from the start and I felt confident about the whole process. They allowed us to drop our luggage off earlier and even invited us to attend an arts festival going on this week! The building and studio were exactly as they had described. The location served us well because of the close proximity to the train station. My advice is to plan your eating schedule well as we discovered many nearby restaurants/cafes close after the business crowd leaves the area (by 5:30-7pm). As this is a shared space with working artists, the notes in the kitchen and room were helpful. The studio was very clean, comfortable and the bathroom was very clean too. The one item which I hope can be added to the room is a circulating fan in the lower part to move the cold air from the window A/C up to the loft where we slept. There was a small fan by the bed but that just blew the hovering warm air on us and the cooler air stayed below. Overall, we had a good experience and nice time. Thank you very much! "
208356,40719350,2015-08-02,30554095,Jason,My wife and I were very ecstatic with our decision to stay. The location and price were phenomenal. Everything was as described in the listing. We were given everything we needed to have a very comfortable stay and would definitely come back again.
208356,41082524,2015-08-04,31495507,Pieter,Clean room and bathroom. Just the perfect location if you are travelling by Amtrak. A lot of restaurants in the area with KauKau being our favourite. Not too far from downtown. Good info binder in room.
208356,41200541,2015-08-05,18166483,Jimin,"I stayed only one night but had a good night. Clean, comfortable flat and there was everything I need."
208356,41574382,2015-08-08,27796945,Carmen,"Der Aufenthalt bei Dirk und Jaq war wunderbar, es ist alles perfekt organisiert, sauber, gemütlich und freundlich. Die Location ist perfekt im Zentrum gelegen und schnell vom Bahnhof erreichbar. Ideal für einen Städtetripp in Seattle. Vielen Dank für die Gastfreundschaft!"
208356,41720078,2015-08-09,22544471,Dan,"My fiancé and I came to Seattle to see Taylor Swift Live! The Artist Loft was perfect for our stay in the city- just a quick walk to the stadium. This place would be perfect for anyone visiting Seattle for a Seahawks game. The tv and cable worked and there were plug-ins all over the place. You can even put leftover food in the fridge down the hallway!

Thanks for having us!"
208356,42008068,2015-08-10,33279593,Robin,"Our room rental from Dirk and Jaq was extremely convenient for our short stay in Seattle.  The location was perfect for our need to accompany friends to King Station (for the train) and Union Station (to catch public transit to the airport), as well as for our departure on the Bolt Bus.  We also enjoyed the close proximity to Pioneer Square.  The room and building were exactly as described by our hosts and were well kept, clean and bright.  Jaq gave us excellent directions for getting to the artist loft as well as for accessing the keys to the building and our room.  As shown the space is small, but the couch and chairs were very cozy and nice for watching a bit of TV, there is an ample desk for any work someone might need to do, the wifi connection was very reliable,  and the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable.  Although the bath facilities are not private, we found them very convenient, clean and accommodating.  Fresh towels in the room and all the soaps, shampoo, conditioners you need in the bath.  The air conditioner was much appreciated on the warm summer night we arrived.  Thank you Dirk and Jaq - your little airbnb worked out just right for our needs"
208356,42128803,2015-08-11,21407600,Trevor,"This little artists loft was clean and comfortable. It's about a 20 minutes walk to pike place market, and close to public transit as well. My wife and I were only here one night and we didn't use the kitchen, but it looked nice and in working order. Dirk and Jaq were very accessible and answered all my qyestions. We had a nice stay and enjoyed the city if Seattle."
208356,42299672,2015-08-12,960556,Calvin,"This is the second time I've stayed with Dirk & Jaq and I will be back for sure. The location is ridiculously convenient for Mariners/Seahawks games and check-in is a breeze. Cleanliness of the  room, kitchen, and bathroom is excellent and the bed is large enough to fit two adults comfortably. No problems at all with the internet, TV or air conditioning. Dirk & Jaq are great with communication too. I couldn't think more highly of this property in terms of value for money. Thanks again."
208356,42867255,2015-08-16,2360903,Nina,Very cute apartment -- clean and neat. Signs around the apartment help make sure everything runs smoothly and stays clean. Enjoyed my stay here!
208356,43114593,2015-08-17,17683454,Maggie,Great affordable option to stay in downtown Seattle.  Clean and convenient! 
208356,43245689,2015-08-18,35821815,Brooke,It was a nice place to stay. The loft was really comfortable and it was very clean. I wish the bathrooms were closer to the room. 
208356,43623358,2015-08-21,17477014,Kyle,"The host made stowing our bags, acquiring our keys, and entry from the light rail extremely easy. Everything was well documented and simple to use. Loved the little touches, the experience was seamless! Also, this part of the neighborhood was really quiet, and we had no hesitations about walking from our room into the city."
208356,43755359,2015-08-22,22643931,Jewels,"We had a great stay! Dirk and Jaq did a great job of giving us all of the information we needed upfront and also checked in with us once we were there to make sure we had everything we needed it. The room and space was clean and the perfect setting for our one night stay.  We were able to walk down to Pioneer Square, Occidental Square, and Pike Place Market from there and took a cheap cab home from the Chihuly Glass Museum.  Would definitely recommend this room for anyone else looking for something simple, clean, and accessible."
208356,44112041,2015-08-24,34441589,Anne,"I never met the hosts, but access to key was easy, and plenty of friendly notes explaining all I needed to know. I enjoyed the selection of teas and good coffee. Good 'hood for me as able to walk to train station next day. "
208356,44298619,2015-08-25,5205088,James,"Nice clean quiet functional room, not far from rail link to the airport, with access to shared kitchenette and toilet / shower room. Walkable to pioneer square area. You do need to be able to shimmy up a steep ladder to bed! There are a few house rules. Bed is very comfortable I slept like a log! Thanks guys. "
208356,44634618,2015-08-28,27261181,Doris,"It's a special room, and very convenient to downtown or other places."
